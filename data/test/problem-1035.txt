“Yes, I absolutely do, I have… I have read about pizza.” He felt silly saying it, but it was the truth. He was familiar with the concept, through reading, but he hadn’t actually tasted any.
“Oh no, I absolutely do, I love it. That was my introduction to good music, you see. Bach…” Draco waved his hands over his now empty plate. “Laying in my bed, hearing the Goldberg Variations for the first time, it was a revelation. Mary thought it would be relaxing, but it was the most stimulating experience I had had in years.” It had actually been a little too stimulating, in a sense, but Draco saw no reason to tell Kenny that. “And then Mary said I could explore music as much as I pleased because I had enough money that it wouldn’t really affect my budget much, and so I did.”
“Of course she has a phone, she’s a muggleborn! She stays in touch with her family, you know. And how else would I stay connected with her and Ron while I’m stuck here in the muggle world? I can’t exactly owl them, you know.”
Draco assented. He was a little amused, though, by the mix of authority and attempt at not overruling Draco’s independence. It was exactly like Mary (oh, he hoped she was okay) had told him they were taught in nursing school. He couldn’t remember madame Pomfrey caring much what the patient wanted, come to think. She knew what was best for you, and that was that. But then again, madame Pomfrey had never been to muggle nursing school.
“Former nazis?”
“I think that’s a great idea, but I don’t see why you want to wait until you come back. I mean, doing it in person would be best in one way, I guess, but that will also take years, and how is that worth it? You can have her number, and then just call her. And I think you should.”
“No – we actually had a cook, and she wouldn’t even let me in the kitchen. And then I was at school, with no opportunity for any cooking at all, and then I fell ill. There was never really a chance to learn – or a call for it, either.”
It was a Tuesday late in September. Harry was over, they had eaten dinner, and now they were just hanging out in the living room, talking about that day in May, when Mary had collapsed.
“Exactly! And that is precisely why Binns needs to go!”
“Fuck if I know. Do what feels right, just do something, don’t stop growing, but figure it out yourself. I mean, it should be your job, finding out, shouldn’t it. Hell, I bloody well don’t owe you figuring it out for you.”
All this time, as information came dripping in, as improvement happened slowly, he was waiting for his mother to come visit him. He was sure she would find a way to pretend to be a muggle, even if it took her some practice to do it, but he had been completely out of it for seven months, surely that would be enough time? Unless she had been caught while practicing. That was a disturbing thought, but there was nothing he could do to find out. His mother never came.
“So, you may want to look this up properly later. I may get things wrong, okay? Precision is not my thing, as both you and Hermione like to remind me.” It was lovely how close Harry felt to his friends still, confident that they would still be there in the same way as before when he returned from his exile. Draco was barely even jealous, it was so uplifting.
He found the names of records that sounded interesting in Rolling Stone Magazine, and Mary bought what she could find in the record store on her errand day on Thursdays. She made a neat stack called Draco’s favorites, and put the rest in heard and unheard stacks. That lasted about a month. When the stacks had multiplied and were could in no way be kept neat anymore, she alphabetised the lot, leaving room for a lot more.
It started with this conversation, though, while Kenny was chopping carrots for a soup. There were a lot of carrots – Kenny was fond of making a lot of meals at a time. Beside him were several leeks and a little pyramid of potatoes.
“And there he was, Harry Potter,” Draco said, wildly. “And I was all ‘why is he helping me, why is he being so nice to me?’, but also I was too shocked by everything to even properly notice. It was strange, very strange.”
“I normally would not do this prior to diagnosis, but if I am right, then... no time to lose.”
“That’s actually fascinating, but I don’t really see how that made you such a genre tart.”
“MOTHER, you say I am not allowed to shout at guests, not even EVER, not even Frieda when she PINCHED me, and now YOU are doing it”
Slowly. And she had said he would be getting better slowly. So, more of the same, then. Bed, sludgy thinking. Surely better, though. Getting better. Than getting worse. Even if it was still hard. To think. To move. To everything. Don’t move, she’d said. The nurse. Mary. Not like madam Pomfrey. Not at all. This one looked short, and dark, and round-faced. Pomfrey was tall, and blonde, and her face was a bit square. So, different. But maybe a little alike. Kind and firm. He hoped. That’s similar. He heard her now, in his room, doing something that produced a gentle clicking sound. Soothing him, making him sleepy. Hypnosis, he thought. That’s the muggle version of. Umh. Of mind control. Spells. Those spells. Yes.
“They come out and bounce around in there instead of the heat, I think,” Harry tried. “Going through the food, heating it up?”
Then, while married, the wizard would either have loose connections on the side, though how that would be accomplished outside of school, Draco didn’t really know, or he would find a steady boyfriend, who mostly would not live with him, though there were exceptions to that, too. It hadn’t occurred to Draco that this was something to be questioned, as it seemed to work out, but… things were different in the muggle world.
“Do you have a cellphone, Harry? Call an ambulance. Right now. I’ll just. Fuck.” And then Mohammed started moving Mary around, placing her in an odd sideways position, tilting her head back slightly, and then leaning over her as if to give her a hug, but stopping over her body, keeping himself very still.
Draco felt dizzy, like he’d just landed after a side-along. Too fast, too much. He was still trying to piece together Harry’s rapid-fire phone talk, and now… decisions? About something else entirely?
He had not just been tempted, as he had often thought about it before, he had been threatened, threatened with the withdrawal of a father’s love. His mother had made sure he knew he didn’t have to, and he hadn’t had to, not in technical terms. He had also also known his mother had wanted him to do the opposite thing his father did, but there was no threat in that. His mother’s love was unconditional, after all. The choice, in the end, had been very easy.
Even thinking about it hurt, but the song helped, howled grief where he couldn’t. There were a lot of songs about war. He knew, of course, that muggles had wars too – they had been taught that the Grindelwald war had sparked a massive muggle war as well, but here it was in front of him: Bob Dylan’s anger in Masters of War was fierce and just in a way that said a war was clearly going on as it was written. Redbone sang about how everyone was wounded at something called Wounded Knee, “you and me”. Iron Maiden had so many songs about the horrors of war that he just about lost count.
“Reading,” Draco insisted, when they talked about what he wanted. “I mean, reading heavier things, like history.”
Draco made space. He could not stop looking at Mary. He had missed her so much – she had been there constantly for years, and then just got taken away with no warning. And he knew she would be home with Vicky, recovering, but he hadn’t known she would be well enough to come see him! It was a surprise, the best surprise.
Draco frowned.
He didn’t have a muggle disease after all. What he had was a very rare disease of the magical core, which made it react to magic as it happened around him, or as he tried to do magic himself. Apparently this had made him worse and worse over time, ravaged his body almost to the point of death. It could no longer handle even non-magical activities or stimuli, and it would take a long time to recover.
“You thought it was just love songs? Her love songs are good, though.”
“Within the last three?”
“My mother would probably sit down and plot to make it happen, though, if she was sure I really wanted it.” Fresh waves of laughter from both of them at that. Harry didn’t know Narcissa well, but he probably knew the truth of that. Calming down, drying slight tears of hilarity from the corners of his eyes, Draco said to Kenny,
Draco thought perhaps his brain must be addled by too long among muggles – he hadn’t even thought about how the situation could be construed that way for someone who hadn’t been party to his and Harry’s conversation. He groaned.
“You should ask Harry, not me. I mean, he’s one of the ones you’ve wronged, and if I got the story right that’s not just on a group level either. Oh, fuck this shit. I’m getting too upset. You two should talk it out, because I keep wanting to run this entire fucking thing when it’s not actually about me. I’ll get us all some pizza, and you two can talk for a bit. Sound good?”
“Yes. Artificial coma, Mary calls it.”
“I get that, but – ”
“My shit is mine to work with,” Kenny said gruffly, decapitating a carrot, “and as Harry has been telling me, I have a job to do there, so fuck me, I guess. And your shit is yours to work on, and I won’t, well. Try to tell you what to do. I’m sorry I did, earlier, I shouldn’t have. And I know you had distanced yourself from that shit, and that you were upset about being taken in by it. Fuck, you told me as much already, I just assumed it was more, like, garden variety bigotry, I guess. So I’m actually really sorry about ignoring that, too.” He still looked thunderous, though.
“Oh, I can.” Harry had no business sounding this amused, but Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care right now.
“I already knew I detested what he did, and what he made me do, too, I have known that for years. He raised me with the belief that what one did to lesser people didn’t matter, you know, that kind of thing. Ugly beliefs that I’m really glad to have shed, but that I shouldn’t have had to shed in the first place. They shouldn’t have been there! What right did he have to raise me to think of other people as worthless? As things that needed removing, not as people? It’s… he had no right.”
“I don’t think we ever really knew each other that well to begin with, you know.”
“Now, I’ve been dying to ask about your music collection, if that’s okay –”
“That’s nice. I mean, the music is the important part, for me, but good lyrics can only help. A bad text can certainly ruin the entire song.”
“I can’t say I know, exactly, but I suppose she was in a bit of a hurry. I know she mentioned needing to find something that was empty already and without lots of things that could get in the way of getting it immediately. That must have made the selection smaller. And I expect my mother had additional instructions about the place. I assume the lovely view is her influence.”
Being moved, carried, every step an impact that seemed to hurt his very core. Clicking, voices, more clicking. A strange humming, then, and shaking and moving. His eyes fluttering open to see two worried, blue eyes and a dark, blond beard - “oh, shit, he’s awake, hey, Mary! MARY! Is it safe to give him some more…?” “Yes, 5 ml, do it, now!” And then it was over.
And thank you for reading.
He missed his mother, too, fiercely, and worried for her. He was glad she had sent him here. “To die among muggles,” she had said, but clearly she had also understood that there was hope of survival and recovery, or she simply wouldn’t have done it. He was glad she had made that decision for him, and felt chilled when he realised there was no way that would have been possible if his father hadn’t been in Azkaban.
Draco did, in fact, want some tea or something, a whole lot of somethings, but he found himself shaking his head nonetheless, in a feeble attempt at taking back control, maybe. “Later,” he said. “Tell me about your idea first.”
Well, not the war Kenny was talking about, to be sure, but he had fought in a war. Not that he could tell Kenny that either.
The horror of the machines. The horror of the tubes. The beard, which no one here was going to understand the wrongness of. But mostly, the tubes. How they went into his body, to force it to live, pumping, making him half muggle machine himself. And all the time he could not move.
He didn’t only read sci-fi, though, he read everything and anything that wasn’t too heavy a read. Mary soon learned that he would try anything once. Reading Jane Austen had him thinking that muggle and wizarding culture had been closer two hundred years ago than they were now, and he wanted to share Pride and Prejudice, especially, with his mother. Reading George Orwell made him see similarities between muggle and wizarding politics he hadn’t considered before. It also made him dream up a book where Winston Smith worked at the ministry of magic, and where the department of mysteries were actually doing things to change the past, which again made him think about how le Guin named one of her protagonists George Orr, and how that story was similar, yes, surely she had read Orwell, surely this was a reference, oh, he was happily drunk on the discovery for days, it felt like he had finally gotten enough of a grip on a piece of muggle culture to see the connections.
(See the end of the chapter for
Still, even Lucius, so acutely aware of power, had to really squint to see those power differences from above, Draco realised. Lucius had good instincts for these things, and he was good at squinting, and at using that to his advantage, but the power differences still weren’t really visible until he looked for it. He tried to tell Mary about his father, but it was hard to find the right words.
“It’s not,” Kenny agreed. “I don’t know what you did, exactly, and I’m not sure I want to, honestly, but you need to make amends, if that is even possible. I can’t believe Harry is helping you!”
“No, we did not know what was wrong with me. My mother tried to figure it out – there was an entire parade of healers. She only found the right healer just in time, really. It wasn’t like that for you?”
“How am I supposed to know?”
“I mean, what I’m asking is, who normally comes to help you with things if Mrs. Williams is sick? I’m assuming you still need regular help with… things.” That last was said while gesturing vaguely at Draco’s body, and the wheelchair beside the more comfortable chair he was sitting in. He would probably have felt insulted at that, but he was way too exhausted.
Draco knew when it came down to it he himself was somewhere in the middle of these approaches, had a tendency for both, but had generally chosen to be like his father, much good that had done him. There, in his sick bed, in an apartment he hadn’t seen yet, in a muggle town he knew nothing about except it didn’t have wizards, he promised that he would endeavor to be more like his mother. More logical, even when logic defied feeling and demanded sacrifices, and more loyal to the people that mattered the most to him, whatever that might look like. And he would apologise to his mother, too, for not appreciating her enough when he was younger.
Find help, yes. He should find help. How did one go about finding help? Rolling back out on the veranda and shouting, perhaps? There were plenty of people out there. Would the building receptionist let them in? Oh, the receptionist, that was who he should call for help, with the thing in the hall that wasn’t exactly a telephone. He rolled out into the hall and was thankful that the device wasn’t too far up. He hadn’t used it before, but he was used to technology now, he used a lot of it, surely it wasn’t that difficult. Ignore the heart beating its way out of his chest, now, ignore the fear that she might be gone, too late, too...
“Oh! Mary. Mary Helen Williams,” Draco answered. Harry repeated that into the phone. Mohammed was still on the floor with Mary, doing Merlin knows what, but he supposed the man knew what he was doing, and certainly better than any of them.
“Vicky, was that it? Is it okay if I look around to see if I can find her number somewhere?” Harry asked. “Mrs. Williams… Sorry, Mary, she may have left it somewhere. Does she live here too, or…? Okay, cool, where’s her room? I’ll go do that, then.” Ten minutes later Harry had not only found Vicky’s number, but called her. By the sound of it she had already received a message from the hospital, and was going there as soon as she had someone to watch her daughter.
“Do you have a pill you take when you’ve done a bit much? Because if you do, then you should probably take one now. Oh, good, you do. Do you have access to it, or do I need to hunt down the medicine cabinet? Good, then. Need any help?”
They decided she would call him every Sunday at one o clock. Sacred time, she called it.
She wanted to learn everything about Draco’s life too, and predictably, she was interested in the dilemma about talking to muggles about his life, too. It wasn’t like before, not exactly, but she still felt like his best friend, still felt like his ally.
“Something nice for Mohammed, for his help on Thursday. And Kenny. And you, of course.”
But mostly it felt like slipping away, falling backwards into nothingness. It felt like time happened and didn’t happen, a whole lot of both, of greyness that was both time and space. It lasted forever, until it didn’t.
“Huh. I suppose I do think of all the pureblood marriage stuff as old-fashioned, not just bizarre. I mean, also bizarre, sorry, Draco, but they are. But in an old-fashioned way. What was this book, then?”
But the reason why this is hard to write is the main reason I am writing it. Which is why I appreciate everyone reading so, so much. Thank you for letting me tell you this story!
Harry had been right, Kenny had decided to stay. In fact, he did not appear to have even considered leaving for good. He had come back later the night of their argument carrying three big pizza boxes as a peace offering, and said he was interested in talking more about it all later, but that he absolutely didn’t want to put any pressure on Draco about these things. And then he had apologised to Harry, and the two of them had promised to talk. In the time that followed that day Kenny and Draco had talked too, here and there, but it was more like the slow conversations about power Draco and Mary had been having, stretched out over weeks.
Kenny laughed mirthlessly. “Sure, and I’m a Liverpool supporter. Pull the other one.”
“You grew up with muggles! Of course you should know!”
He crossed his arms, looking like a stubborn four-year-old. Draco wasn’t going to argue with him in the first place, but somehow seeing a sullen Harry was a little bit endearing, and it was tempting to poke just a little more, like he would a friend. He reined himself in. There was something important here, something similar.
Then, while eating, they talked about what they wanted to do when they got better.
And that’s when Draco broke, a torrent of tears, a weird roar of grief coming from his throat, more felt than heard, except from somewhere very far away. Harry’s hand was on his back, but that felt far away too. Forgiveness had happened to him while he wasn’t aware. Forgiveness wasn’t just a hypothetical about what he deserved, it was a fact, there whether he felt he deserved it or not.
He could look around his room, too, which was interesting at first. It had a big window that followed the entire wall to the left of his bed, and when the curtains were open, he could see the sky. There were two doors, one to the hall and one to his bathroom. He really wondered about muggle bathrooms, but there was no way to ask about those either. There was also a big closet and some shelves, and a low table with two comfortable chairs.
“I did, and I thoroughly wish I did not. Though I suppose it was instructive. He was one of the people who really made me aware of all the hypocrisy going around there.”
Draco had a rest, and then picked up a book about a woman who was time traveling or perhaps mad, it wasn’t quite clear. The future she went to was clearly better for her, because the society she grew up in was so very bad. He wondered idly if the USA was still like that for poor people. He couldn’t seem to find anything recent about it. Most of the books he read about the USA had scientists in them, and they seemed to be doing alright for the most part, but that made sense, they were experts. Not on top of anything, but very far from the bottom.
“The thing is, I know this guy, Kenny. Great guy. He used to be my carer, actually. He’s a nurse now, he wasn’t back then, just worked for me on the side while he was doing nursing school. So, umm, I know he’s good at this kind of stuff, and won’t mess you up with bad advice or bad care, but yeah, he works part-time at the hospital, so he couldn’t be here all the time, but I was thinking, what if we call him, and then hears if he’s interested? He could stay here as well. I mean, he’s living on his sister’s sofa after his asshole of a man cheated on him, so you know, he’d probably be pretty delighted with the situation, to be honest. But mostly I just think he’ll be exactly what you need.”
Apparently the argumentative child was removed by wand. She had a point, Draco thought. Sabine. His own first daughter was to be named Sabine, after Pansy’s maternal grandmother, he’d known that forever. And now there would never be a Sabine Malfoy in the world as he thought there would be, but instead the world had a Sabine Flint. A fresh wave of grief over the loss of Pansy washed over him. Apparently he had lost her conversation too, and he only heard parts of Pansy and Hermione’s conversation as it happened.
Draco ate his soup in silence, mulling it over. And then after the meal, he added it to his list of things to do when he returned to the wizarding world. There were many things he could not fix, but surely this was something he could at least affect.
“Oh, I admit I am absolutely musically promiscuous, and I see nothing wrong with that either. Being prejudiced about music sometimes seems like it’s some sort of ideal, frankly – ”
So, that was a chapter. Balancing these three points of views is tricky, especially in an explosive conversation like this. I don't think i could have done it without Harry's temper.
That was strange to Draco, because Harry looked perfectly well. He looked completely healthy, and Draco had thought about how much he wanted to be that healthy, ever since he first saw Harry again. And he still wanted that, of course. But apparently there was still quite a lot of managing, and not overdoing things, at Harry’s level. And apparently Harry had a pattern of overdoing things. Which, Draco tactfully refrained from pointing out, Harry has always had.
“That makes sense. But, just to be clear, when you say marry her off, you mean they just… decided for her? Not give her a choice or anything?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“They are so… but habit is… and very strong, you have to understand”
“Safe and sound,” he said. “And really glad to see you! I worried,” he admitted, though surely she had known he worried. She smiled with the functioning part of her face. “When I get better, I can come visit you.”
“He said it himself, kind of. It’s like he’s trying to decide how I am supposed to react to something that happened to me. Like, just as if because he’s on my side he gets to do that. Just because he cares more about politics and all he gets to just know what it is I should say or how I should hold my grudges and that it’s wrong to forgive you or whatever. To be fair, I think that’s why he left, though. Because he realised he was doing that. So that’s something, at least.”
“Okay, yeah, I thought you might. At least you’re not hyper, that’s a much worse sign. Hey, Draco, please let me know if I explain to you stuff you already know, yeah? So. This means you will need to do some extra rest for a few days. Which may be fairly hard as there will also be some demands on you, like some changes in your routine because we don’t know each other that well yet, and because I’m not here all the time like Mary is.”
“So, well. Thank you for being here. And I hope you will come over after I don’t need your help, too. For, well, for tea. And conversation.”
A second article detailed experiments with placing patients in magical stasis, with no success. This experiment was allowed only because the normal odds of dying, and the suffering nature of that death, were so high.
Blink.
Why, he wondered as he watched the man, was Harry Potter in this muggle town, distinguished only by its lack of wizardkind? What was he doing here? Escaping the press, maybe – he had always tried to do that at Hogwarts, instead of trying to use it, which would have been the sensible thing to do. So maybe that was it. Hastings was certainly a good place for it, if so. Harry interrupted his musings:
“That makes sense, I didn’t think about that. I’m glad he did, though.”
“Oh, and yours. Just hearing it… just… the last time I saw you, you hadn’t been able to speak for months, and before that your voice was so very weak. You sound like yourself again, Draco, and I cannot describe how wonderful it is to hear… of course, I knew you were better, I had an owl from Ms Granger, and she told me you were safe and sound, which was such a welcome message, as you can imagine, hearing you were alive, knowing you were on your way to recovery. And then she explained the entire situation over tea when she came here to help me with the phone, of course. Such a lovely young witch. She taught Tippy as well, who seems to have a knack for technology, who knew. And I understand that you have the company of Mr. Potter while convalescing, that’s lovely. Tell me everything!”
“I’m okay. It is my first trip outside for a lot of years, and I am just… very happy.” He smiled at the child, who smiled back, not seeming to mind at all that she was constrained with straps. She had a pink toy in a soft-looking material, and its ear bore evidence of many hours of chewing.
“Oh, and then we found a cleaning lady who was also willing to do some food prep and such until the application for carers from the city went through, so I had most of the help I needed, and Ron went back home, and there I was, you know. Alone, but still. Able to go out a bit in my wheelchair. Money certainly helped, though. I didn’t have to spend anywhere near as lavishly as you did, but still.”
As it turned out, Mary had had a stroke, which Draco actually knew about – one of those had killed his grandfather Abraxas, who had died tragically early at 82. Even with the war, most people had at least one living grandparent, but Draco had none. His main association with strokes was ‘deadly’, so it did not exactly feel like good news. “She’ll be fine?” he kept asking Harry, who waved him off while listening to Vicky.
“Faster is probably better. I don’t know much about phones, anyway, I just chose the same type Harry uses, the Nokia 3310, so it would be easy to learn, you know.”
He supposed he would find out what muggles did about stairs eventually, but not yet, because even with the chair he wasn’t supposed to go outside for another year or two after first leaving bed. No, he would have to spend time learning things like how to use the toilet again, and move around in his apartment a bit.
“I really am sorry, you know,” Hermione was saying. “I didn’t realise there were reasons why your husband couldn’t know, why you wouldn’t tell him. I wasn’t implying that you were stupid, not at all, I just didn’t understand what conditions you were working under – I still don’t, but now I know that I don’t know, which I suppose is a bit better, anyway.”
“He is in prison,” Draco snapped.
“Oh my god. Oh fuck,” Kenny was saying, and a faraway part of him told Draco that he was about to lose Kenny’s friendship, was in fact losing it this very minute. Fair enough, he thought, fair enough. He had never deserved Kenny in the first place, had only ever had him in his life because Harry had vouched for Draco, implicitly if nothing else. While it was hard to disgust a man like Kenny, it was certainly possible. You just needed a past like Draco’s. He was disgusted with himself too, but his own disgust didn’t signify anything, of course – it had certainly been thrown around enough, and wasn’t that exactly the problem.
“Okay, so, are you feeling more tired than usual after doing your morning stuff today? Less? About the same?” Kenny asked when they were done.
“In the kitchen,” Draco gasped, waving wildly in that direction.
Harry was laughing hysterically now.
“Sabine, you will leave the grownups alone and go play something quiet, do you hear me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Then it all wound down. Vicky said “Sure, I’ll call you about that, Kenny” about something Draco had missed. Harry said how lovely it was to meet “the famous Mary” - they hadn’t talked that much, but he had been listening to her talk to Draco. Mary said Draco mustn’t come visit until he was absolutely ready. No pushing himself too far for her. And then Draco thanked them all for coming, and somehow he didn’t feel tired, just shaky with gratitude. He went to bed and fell asleep halfway through The Division Bell, saving the mix tapes for later. What was a mix tape? Must ask Harry. Harry.
Eventually Mary introduced options for lighter activities, and tried to figure out what he liked – how about reading? What would he like to read? He had no idea what sort of reading materials muggles might have – did they have books at all? He couldn’t remember – but Mary got him a stack of various colorful but eerily unmoving magasines, and promised more of whatever type he enjoyed, and that later, when he was better, they could do the same for books. What would muggle books be like? He couldn’t begin to guess.
“Oh crepe,” Kenny swore jokingly. “No, we can swing that. Breakfast in bed or at the table?”
“Well, yes, but you and Weasley were romantically involved, so that’s a little different.”
It was an ongoing conversation, one that was held a bit at a time, over several months. And throughout he was getting better. He was having showers now, sitting down, only needing help with his hair, and drying off after. Every other part of showering he could do on his own. And one day, one day soon, quite likely this summer, he could go out among the muggles for real, armed with all his new understanding of the world.
He got through four or five books a week. Some were gotten from the library, but most of them he bought. Mary would order them for him at the bookstore. Handily, most books had a list of names of other books by the same author, or similar books by the same publisher, so he didn’t seem to run out very often.
“Oh, okay, I can do that, but why would...”
“I’m so sorry, Draco. That’s horrible. I didn’t know. We’ll need to fix that.”
“Ice cream?”
The next time he woke up he could feel someone in the room with him. He didn’t want to open his eyes quite yet, didn’t want to show that he had moved into being awake now, but somehow he must have given it away, because someone made a humming sound and there was a shuffle and then a few footsteps, and then a cool hand on his forehead.
“Well, yes, in general, but that’s fairly simple to fix, really. Arthur Weasley has been doing this thing for years with bigger muggle things where he just uses a preservation charm around the bits that have electricity. It’s an easy fix.”
“But, how can everyone just… not know?”
“Five minutes,” Harry told Mohammed. “Five minutes and they’ll be here, the operator said. They are on their way, they’re nearly here, she said. Started out the minute I told them where to go.”
“Hermione, wait,” Harry broke in. “You need to get one for Parkinson as well. Well, Pansy. Pansy Flint, now.”
“Oh. Good. I. Yes. Tell her to tell my mother I love her, too, please. I mean, obviously she knows, but. Still.” His mother would be very surprised to have a missive from Hermione Granger, of course, but not, he thought, displeased, not at all, especially given the content of the message.
He would listen to music not only in his bedroom, now, but in the outer living room, and he had set up shelving for his still growing CD collection, and a separate player with big speakers. He would also sit in the inner living room reading, or working on a big puzzle that would take up the table over the weeks it took him to complete it. He would sometimes even roll his wheelchair into the kitchen if Mary was there cooking or something, just to chat. The kitchen elves back home never let him do that, not even when he was small, but this was a kitchen built for humans, and Mary liked the company.
“Magic as a technology, now that is a very interesting thought.” Of course his mother caught that, he thought fondly.
Blink. Blink.
Harry called the hospital, who would give them no information about Mary because Draco and Harry weren’t Mary’s next of kin. Harry left a voice message on Vicky’s telephone instead. And then they rested, Draco in his bed, Harry on the sofa, with a pillow from Kenny’s bed.
“Yes, let us do that for Mary, send her flowers. And unless chocolate is too strange, could we do that too? Mary really likes the belgian seashell-shaped things, filled with nougat, do you know what those are?”
“Certainly, what do you want to know?”
“Apparently I didn’t have to either. Not that I was consulted. I was asleep for the first seven months of the whole thing.”
And then, once out of bed, there would be a wheelchair, which he gathered was a chair for getting around if you couldn’t walk. The chair part of that was familiar enough – Tracy in his year had used a charmed armchair that floated over the ground to get around – but wheels seemed a bit silly, because what on earth would one do about stairs? He’d heard often enough that muggles were obsessed with wheels, though, because they didn’t have magic, so probably that was it. There would also be a thing called a walker, which apparently didn’t walk, but instead had wheels on it, too.
“That actually makes sense, you know. I’ve never heard anyone but the Ravenclaws saying he needs to go, well, of course Hermione, but you know. And to be honest, I figured it was just because they were all swots who were hot for more schoolwork. But Draco, your soup is getting cold, you should finish it before solving more of the world’s problems.”
“You what?!”
Harry went on. In the period of maximal suspicion, homosexuality had been forbidden among muggles in most countries – though actually, come to think, it had been forbidden in Britain before that, for hundreds of years, fuck, this story wasn’t as tidy as I thought, sorry, Draco, anyway, and remained so until not that long ago, really, don’t look so horrified, it’s still, like forty years since it has been actually illegal.
“So what I want you to do is, drop the heavy activities for a few days, just drop them entirely. Yes, including showering, I’m sorry. I’ll help you get clean, but I know it’s not the same. And if you feel yourself getting tired during light activities, like reading or listening to music, then you stop and do some extra actual rest. Can you do that for me? Well, actually, scratch that, can you do that for yourself?”
“I don’t know. But before that, as long as you married and didn’t make a fuss, apparently a discreet relationship on the side was quite acceptable for much of history. And if it wasn’t, it was because fidelity was important, not because of homosexuality, you know?”
“We brought strawberries,” Vicky said. “Mary said strawberries was important on Draco’s birthday.”
He’d been out here for a while now, he thought. Better see whether lunch was ready. Getting up, he discarded the blankets, and then, letting go of the armrest of the chair, grabbed on to the door to the veranda. Once through the door, he let himself fall into the wheelchair that stood there waiting, turning it on and placing his feet on the footrest. And then, the technology familiar by now, the motor propelled him ahead through the living rooms, into the hall, and from there he used the joystick to turn left to enter the kitchen, before stopping with a shout.
“If it helps, this will make me a lot more comfortable with the entire situation, which I need to be in order to ask for help. So please stop protesting and help me find the number for someone who sells good chocolate. And then, having bought you chocolate, I will hopefully feel up to asking for help figuring out muggle money things so I can pay you back the money you’ve spent on me this far, too, and paying Kenny for his work, too. So you see, we very much need to order this chocolate”
Draco snuck his handkerchief out of his pocked, dabbed at his eyes. If birthdays were about being seen, like he had thought earlier, then he absolutely was being seen.
No one really understood here, no one really could. It was an enormous relief to have Harry now, who understood quite a bit of both the muggle and the wizarding world, but actual understanding of his whole situation would be impossible. Harry had not grown up a wizard, the muggles had never been alien to him the way they had been to Draco when he came here. And he had never gotten much sicker than Draco was now. That part of the experience was not shared. Harry had not been as isolated, he had been able to call his friends the whole time, even if he could not see them.
"True enough, that's power too. But Draco, are you feeling okay? You look a bit pale, maybe you should lay down for a bit? We can always talk more about this another time."
“I’m so glad. I have been so worried! Sometimes I convinced myself you must be dead, other times that you must be better, but lost without a way back, caught among the muggles forever. Of course, your mother did let us know it would be years and years before you could come back, but still.”
The receptionist, not Mohammed this time, but a petite blonde named Tina, waved at them and told them good luck. The door swished open on its own accord as he neared it. He had gotten close enough for that to happen last time, too, and he had nearly jumped out of his chair in alarm. This time he knew what to expect, though.
And unlike Mohammed, Draco could not hold it together until the ambulance people had left, he just let out a howl, and then clamped down on it, embarrassed.
Kenny had made tea, and a huge cream cake with strawberries. It was excellent. Draco spent most of the time talking to Mary – every word out her mouth took extra long, because something had happened to her facial muscles. “Stroke,” she said, looking quite put out. “Mess up. Everything!” And then, “Glad you. Are. Safe. Dra-a-aco!”
“I have seen that type of thing before, you know. It was all too easy to believe.”
“Actually, I know one thing that changed the muggle marriages and all, between then and now. There was a big gay scare, in the late 1800s.”
“Yeah, I get it, I get it, it’s just so fucking weird. And now we’ll have to keep talking about it in this weird way… and Kenny doesn’t know, but he knows something…”
“Oh. Alright, we can… talk when you’re ready. If you want to. Some other time. I really did not mean to, either, we were suddenly… just in the middle of it.”
Eating breakfast at the long table in the dining room, him seated at head of the table, watching the table stretch out in front of him, and his parents to each side. Scratch that, scratch that, never quite like that again, even after he returned home it would not be quite like that. But perhaps the food…
Back in the living room, the big one with the sea view, Harry was on the sofa, frantically pushing buttons on his bright green little phone with his thumbs. Draco couldn’t understand how Harry could write text messages that fast – not just the fast tapping, but hitting the right one of the tiny buttons, and knowing which one had to be tapped how many times to get which letter, or held in for the number, or… Draco could write text messages, of course, but a short one took him several minutes. Harry insisted it was just practice, but Draco could not see how he would ever get enough practice to text like that.
She could have taken Draco and fled, surely. Oh, he would have resisted that, and probably put both of their lives in danger in the process, but Narcissa was a smart woman. Surely she could have potioned him into obedience or unconsciousness. She could have stolen the ancient Malfoy portkey collection, so they wouldn’t know which one she had used, and then apparated from there. The apparation traces would be gone by the time they figured out where they had gone unless their luck was very bad. And then they could have lived out the rest of it somewhere. A sleepy greek village, or a big muggle city somewhere. There were certainly enough of them.
“She did, and thank you for that, I appreciate it a lot. I have enjoyed that view a lot, especially before I could go outside. I only started outside excursions this summer, you see, and it’s still only once a week.”
His mother called him just three days later, when he was having lunch on the veranda in the crisp October air, a woolen blanket over his legs, and the apology list he was working to the side of the table, safe from any accidents of broccoli soup. He struggled inside and let himself fall onto the sofa before answering.
“No, that’s just it, I couldn’t. It wasn’t about priorities. I mean, I understand that it looks like a ‘moral choice’ or whatever, and that I made the brave or heroic one or what you might call it, but the thing is, it really doesn’t feel like a choice in the situation. It feels like there is only one single possible course of action. And somehow people always… ughhh, I’m not saying you’ve done anything wrong now, right? I’m just saying I’ve had so many people saying the sort of thing you just said, that it’s a choice, that it makes me sort of… sick. Frustrated. I don’t know. It just doesn’t feel true. Like, at all.”
“He sounds like a proper dick,” Kenny answered, “but it’s okay to have complicated feelings about this stuff, you know. Be mad at him and care about him at the same time. He’s your father.”
“You were screaming,” Kenny said, pushing a glass of water to Draco’s lips while supporting his neck. Draco sipped, throat feeling sore, as if the smoke still reached him through all these years.
“Vicky does,” he answered, “but I don’t know how to call her. And she’s Mary’s sister, so… oh no, she doesn’t know, does she? And I don’t know how to call her! She should know her sister is… sick. Oh, I hope she is just sick.”
“Want to go back in? We can, you know. This is still a huge success, having been outside among people for the first time in years.”
The worst of it was that he had already missed seven months, and it was now mid-june, 2002, as opposed to november 2001. He had been kept in an artificial coma as even doing what he was doing now, thinking, small movements, that kind of thing, would have made him worse, apparently. This infuriated him, but he couldn’t have said why. It certainly wasn’t Mary’s fault. She had stolen those months in a sense, he supposed, but only to save his life. She certainly seemed to know what she was doing. A competent muggle – not something he had been prepared for, though he supposed they must exist.
“Hello, Draco. Normally I would run wand diagnostics first, but I don’t dare to do that now, it is simply too dangerous in the state you are in. We will need to start with questions,” the healer said. “I understand you can’t talk anymore, but blink once for yes, and twice for no. Otherwise, just conserve your strength as best you can as we go through this. Can you do that?”
They arranged that the chocolate would be delivered on Monday. He gave the address, and the bill would be delivered with the chocolate, but discreetly under the smallest basket, as that was for him. He thanked her nicely, said goodbye, and pushed the right button to hang up. He beamed at Harry.
“Don’t. Worry.” Harry insisted. “Just don’t. This is fine. This will all be fine. You will have your mother back, on phone, at least. And others too, probably. Who do you miss the most?”
“Sure, that sounds lovely. Wake me if I fall asleep, though, I’m still a bit off after the weekend.”
Harry’s voice wove in and out. “Yes. No, not conscious. I don’t know… No, or, I can’t tell? Just one second, though. Mo, is she breathing? Oh, apparently yes, but weakly. Yes. Yes, he placed her like that already. I don’t know shit about it, but I know he’s done a first aid course at least, for work, so I guess he knows what he’s doing, to some, ah, extent? Yes, umh. Into the elevator once you get there, and then top floor, and then you see the door, we’ll keep it open. Yes, still unconscious, no changes there. No, I don’t actually have her name, I just happened to be here, I was just… Wait a sec. Draco, what’s her name? Draco? Hey, DRACO! What’s her name?”
“Thank you. Maybe I will.”
The slight update of that amendment had come at fifteen, after months of Draco pining after Sebastian Rosier, because having a thing for boys didn’t excuse him from marrying a woman and producing heirs. Pansy would be free to pursue her pleasure elsewhere as soon as the heir thing was done with, of course.
“Hello?”
Blink blink blink blink blink blink -
“Ugh, my Aunt Petunia loved that Jane Austen shit.” Harry’s face turned ugly for a moment. “The BBC-series, I mean, she probably wouldn’t have read the books. And I know the things she likes aren’t bad just for her liking them, but it just massively pisses me off. Sorry, not your problem.”
They agreed Kenny would start at once. Kenny would go get a mini fridge and a microwave the next day, which he had off, and then Harry would be there the next two when Kenny worked, just in case, and also they would have to get Draco a phone, but make sure he didn’t have to learn all the new things at once and get plenty of rest, and…
Blink.
It had started out over two years ago with just small things. Dizzy spells that almost sent him off his broom until his mother asked him to please don’t fly until they had figured it out. Tiredness, soreness everywhere. Sicking up everywhere if he tried to apparate or floo. And then he had just remained at home, trying to take walks in the garden, and frequently failing, getting the occasional visitor, reading books and writing letters. He had deteriorated further, until he couldn’t reach beyond his room, and letters were beyond him, but he stayed in first his chair and then his bed, propped up on pillows, rereading children’s books he had loved as a child, because that was all he could focus on, and it was something. He had been miserable enough about it at the time, but he missed it now – the sitting up, the books, the light from the window. The trays of food, already cut up, easy to eat. The elves magicked the food right into his stomach now.
But Harry hadn’t realised. Harry, and Hermione, and probably plenty of other people outside his circle, had assumed that Pansy had been his girlfriend. Somehow that felt like it cheapened their relationship – what a curious thought, why would that be? There was nothing wrong with having a girlfriend, or getting engaged to your Hogwart sweetheart. A lot of people did that, and went on to have excellent marriages. So why did he feel such resentment at the thought of having been assumed to be one of them? It didn’t make sense, not at all.
“Without even a wand… I don’t know whether… even… ”
“Thanks!” Kenny beamed. “Learned from my grandma, at first, and then from cookbooks and stuff. It’s a satisfying thing, really. Do you cook? Before you got sick, I mean?”
Draco didn’t, but he nodded all the same. It made sense – it was what he was used to. As long as you married and made your tidy and proper contribution to the gene pool and the social stability, why wouldn’t you have your lovers of whatever gender you preferred? This was how he had intended to live his own life, his life with Pansy.
“No, once we found a place, Ron took me shopping for new clothes, and then I was exhausted and he went shopping for some other things I might need, without me. He had only ever been to muggle shops to browse, never to find specific things, well, except for the supermarket, and he’d never gone alone before, so that was a bit of a challenge for him. He really did it, though. I wish I had the energy to be with him in the electronics store, he was still ecstatic about it when he came back. Seeing that would be fantastic.”
“Yeah.” Harry had a tired half-smile now.
“Great, just great. Have you ever been exposed to fumes of fiendfyre?”
Nazi. Draco froze, and something in him came crashing down. Because no, that was not exactly what he had been, of course, but also, yes, that was exactly it. A nazi. That was the muggle equivalent of what he had been. He had been that, he had, and while he had regretted a lot of what he had felt and done, and regretted it hard, too, he had not really seen it like that before. Nazism, though, he had read about, in his history books, in newspapers, he had read Orwell’s essays analysing it too, and he had been just as disgusted by the whole thing, as any sane person would be, and yet he somehow hadn’t seen the very obvious similarities. He had never thought to compare it to what he had done, what he had been, and now the word was here, connected with him, and there was no defense, none, because it was true, wasn’t it? It was just... true.
His mother had invited Marcus Flint for tea? That hurt. But oh – of course she would have needed to invite Flint, too, or he might not have been too keen on Pansy going. This way, though, Marcus himself was included in a small conspiracy – and if the story came out, they would know exactly who had leaked it, and Marcus would know that, so most likely he would keep his mouth shut. And if he didn’t, well, Pansy, whom his mother had always doted on, would have some big ammunition for whenever she needed it in her marriage. Trust his mother to set up a situation that had only upside no matter how it went, even if she had gambled with what she had clearly considered his secret.
“No, not exactly, it’s more an expression, to show that they like everything in between, see.”
“I’ll stay,” Harry had said after the ambulance people had left. He said it firmly, aggressively, almost. “Unless you actually kick me out, I’m staying until I am positive that you’re okay. Mo needs to go back down to the reception, but I have time. Nowhere I need to be. I’ll stay.”
“Most wizards, and especially purebloods, learn a lot of family history. Which not only makes the rest of the history a lot easier to learn, but mostly one will learn that in the process, too. I mean, I know about the goblin wars mainly because I know what various ancestors of mine were doing at the time, how they were involved. Which means the people who don’t have that family history will end up with no historical knowledge whatsoever, or just what they’re able to pick up. Which again, oh no, which again means that the history that is known, that is spread around, is absolutely told from the top, from the ones who are proud of it. That is… not good, not good at all.”
Kenny seemed taken with Draco’s CD collection, enthusiastic about the pizza, and ready to ask Draco about a thousand questions about his daily routine. He was confident that they could make this work for a while at least, as long as they employed some strategies to make Draco more independent around meal times. Was he able to operate a microwave if it was placed at a good heigth? How about the fridge, could he access the lower shelves of the fridge? Hmmm, too bad. What if they got a mini-fridge to place the day’s meals in, making sure it was easy to open? Worth a try, certainly.
Oh good, so his mother was plotting. And being very tight-lipped about it, as always. He was glad it wasn’t all gardening and reading and having tea with people, although of course that was nice enough. Come to think, the having tea with people probably was politics too, it always was.
His father was a lot less logical than his mother was – his hope wasn’t informed by things like what are the odds, or what is the healer’s professional opinion. No, Lucius was all feelings, and propriety, and a strong, intuitive understanding of power dynamics. He never would have sent Draco here – people might think it improper, it would weaken the family’s position, and so Lucius would not even have entertained the thought that it might help, the very concept would become too absurd to consider based on the things Lucius did consider, instinctively. Narcissa, though, had trusted knowledge, and given Draco a chance to recover.
“No, I want…” He wasn’t sure exactly what he wanted, except seeing all the people. He spotted a big model of an ice cream hanging on a café. Many things were different between the muggle world and the wizarding, but surely that one was universal. “Ice cream? And sitting in the sun and eating it?”
“Politics? Oh, yes, you have the Malfoy Wizengamot seat. I somehow forgot that was your responsibility now, until I am old enough.”
Then they sat down on the balcony with their mugs of tea, and Draco tried to pump Harry for all the information about muggle technology he had been longing to know, only to find that Harry was quite useless as a source of information. The microwave was short for microwave oven, he said, which meant it was an oven except it used microwaves to heat the food, not regular heat, Harry supposed. He absolutely could not explain what those microwaves were, though, so that wasn’t very helpful at all.
“I am.” He beamed. “Slowly, but, yes.”
“Oh. Well, good, do you know what you would like to try, or should I just buy a lot of halves and we’ll see what you like? Like, a selection, I suppose?”
The pizza was good. Draco tried everything, but he especially liked the one with just mushrooms and cheese. Harry offered to teach Draco how to operate the microwave, looking slightly wary. He was probably afraid that Draco’s inexperience with technology would give his wizarding roots away, Draco decided. Little did Harry know that Draco was now well versed in muggle technology, he even had a technological bed. Well, he wasn’t about to argue about that in front of Kenny, so he just thanked Harry. He wanted to show Harry how well he could master new technology anyway. He really was living the muggle life, or the indoors version of it, at least. There was still a lot he didn’t know (driving a car seemed quite difficult, for instance, and he would probably need several tries to drive it in traffic), but a microwave didn’t sound like much of a challenge.
He didn’t answer. Clearly he wasn’t meant to have overheard that, any of that. He pretended to be made of stone until he heard the little click that signaled the end of the phone call. He was still a bit new to phones, and she knew that, so surely Hermione would just think that he had forgot to push the button to hang up. He had just learned he should last month, so that was plausible enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
Blink. Blink. What on earth. Who would ever, even. He thought he could hear his mother choke back a sob. Oh, mother. The indignities. You suffer for me. I love you.
“But then I came here. I had been so sick, and Mary was looking for things to bring me some joy as I was stuck in bed that also wouldn’t exhaust me, and she asked if I liked classical music. And I didn’t want to say I didn’t know one type of music from the other, so I just said yes.”
“Perhaps, but Mother, I really think I only figured out something that muggleborns have known all along.”
Over dinner they talked about the book, more about music, and then about Draco’s mother, though he got a little snarled up when he said he missed her a lot. He couldn’t tell Kenny just how long it was since he had seen her, after all. Still, Kenny didn’t appear to notice. Oh, he needed to ask Harry how he had presented all this to Kenny.
The way the magic avoidance was accomplished was generally to somehow find a muggle, preferably a nurse, give them a lot of money, and propose they care for the patient until recovery was accomplished, far away from wizardkind. Absolutely no magical items should come with the patient, and they should not even bring their regular non-magical items, including clothes, as they would have been exposed to quite a lot of magic as well. Failure to comply with this was likely to be lethal, the letter stressed.
“Oh, okay, so three rather large gift baskets, then,” she said. Harry made a choking sound, and when Draco looked at him, Harry was stuffing the arm of his sweater into his mouth to keep from laughing out loud.
“Mary used to have errand day on Thursdays, and.” Draco felt weirdly shy about his request, but surely Kenny would understand. “And she would get me magazines and a new CD.”
“I don’t know a lot about muggles, but I think the ‘strict parents’ excuse can cover a multitude of sins,” she mused. “It also has the benefit of being true, too, for the most part. I mean, imagine Narcissa if you decided you wanted to buy, say, a muggle motorcycle at fifteen. There is no way she would have taken that well.” Neither would most muggle parents, but she had a point.
“I don’t believe in bad genres. Besides, country especially is so varied. You can do so much with it.”
The setup for reading was a strange one: He would sit up in the odd bed, a magasine resting on an equally odd table before him, which had a horisontal surface, but also a connected part which could be tilted, and that tiltable part could stick out over his bed when he wanted – the table did, of course, in true muggle fashion, have wheels on it. So he could put a magasine on the tilted surface and read, when the angle was right and his bed was positioned right with the remote control. Mary had to adjust that part of the table for reading, though, and he found himself wishing there was a remote control for that as well. He was adapting, he thought, surprisingly well to muggle life.
“I’m not taking physics or chemistry or any of that stuff, I’m taking English and French and … ”
“Well, I haven’t been to regular school since I was ten, have I? I went to Hogwarts instead, didn’t I? So I got two halves of an education, and they don’t fucking fit all that well, to be honest.” He sounded quite upset, actually. Draco hadn’t realised that either.
Harry winced. Ah, yes, it made sense now, that Harry was trying to get them off the topic of nemeses. Enemies were perhaps a better word. Clearly Kenny had heard about him, a collection of stories he was only now connecting to Draco. Draco had stepped in it, and no mistake. He nodded stiffly.
The muggle was wearing pastel pink, but the similarity with his old teacher stopped there, thankfully. She was perhaps his mother’s age, though of course it was hard to tell with muggles because of their shorter natural lifespan. Her dark eyes looked kind behind brown, framed glasses, and her skin and hair were brown, too. “Oh, wonderful, you are awake! I am Mary, your nurse. Don’t try to speak yet, or move at all. You won’t succeed, and you will make yourself very sick by trying. You are still very ill, but you are getting better slowly, and you will probably keep getting better and reach a full recovery, or close enough. I will give you information little by little, day by day, because you’re still very weak, and too much information at once can be confusing. But you can trust that I will give it all.”
“But, what are the microwaves? And what makes them wave-like?”
“I’m sure we could do the same thing for Parkinson as for your mother. I don’t know what the plan is, exactly, but Hermione seemed completely confident that this wouldn’t be very hard. Are you and Pansy still...”
Draco must had looked a bit worried at the last, because Harry said “he’s just hot air, you’ll get used to it. He’s a total Hufflepuff, I promise.”
“I’m so glad you have Harry,” she answered. He knew that tone.
Also, as I have mentioned before, this story is own-voices. That means that writing some parts is pushing my own buttons really hard too.
There was “Tracy Davis, a crow animagi, can you believe?!” and “Yes, Daphne and Theo seem really happy together, and now she’s pregnant again, as a matter of fact we’re having them over for dinner next Thursday, I really must remember to dealcoholise some of the good wine, it’s better when it’s done a few days in advance, you know.” and “Oh, and Astoria Greengrass is getting married to Fitz Flitwick, you know, Ravenclaw, a year over us, nephew of our teacher, not the side with the goblin ancestry, obviously. An excellent match, everyone says so.” And “Greg was here just last week, he is Sabine’s godfather, you know. He really seems to be doing much better. He says seeing a mind healer is very helpful.”
Draco nodded. This made sense.
Then, apparently, the family would just have to wait for the patient to make their way back to the world in a five to seven years’ time. This approach normally had a survival rate at about 50%, but in Mr. Malfoy’s case, the letter helpfully informed, that estimate would have to be considered rather lower because the illness had progressed this far before it was discovered. Thankfully a nurse who had already succeeded with such a patient had been found for him, which could be assumed to make his chances a bit better, but of course it was impossible to know for sure how much that would affect the outcome. Cheering, he thought, bleakly. On the other hand, he was clearly over the worst, and Mary was nothing but optimistic, so he could probably assume his chances were back up to the normal fifty percent, at least.
“That makes sense. But even if it feels like it’s your fault, well, most often these things are a lot more complicated. I bet there are several other people who feel just as guilty about it, that’s usually how it goes with these things.”
In the living room, Harry was sat with a large, purple mug Draco hadn’t realised he owned, steaming, holding the booklet for The Spaghetti Incident CD by Guns’n’Roses. Not Draco’s favorite CD, but he still felt a lurch in his stomach, a fear that Harry would have damaged the booklet. It was easy to do, at first, with CD booklets, trying to get them out of their case. Harry was wearing the head phones too, hooked up to Draco’s CD player. His head was tilted back, his eyes half-closed. Draco deliberately rolled into view. Harry gave a gratifying little jump, and put the booklet aside, threw off his head phones.
“I can hear you. Mother, and it is so very good to hear your voice,” he said.
“I am sorry,” he apologised hurriedly. “I got too excited. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about this stuff. I couldn’t very well ask Mary about how electricity worked, she might realise I wasn’t a muggle. I don’t want to be burned at the stake!”
“Yeah, I guess. I mean, nazis, really, but the thing is, I don’t get how you can just move away from that and be, you know, so cool with it? As if it doesn’t matter anymore because you’ve changed your mind a bit and realised the people you wanted dead were actual people all along, you know? You just move on now. You just get to move on. That’s not right, somehow, sorry.”
“No, I just read a lot, and it was an aha that sort of happened based on lots of knowledge from other people.”
The slow drip of information
“Well, I am trying to learn about muggle history, because… I can feel the edges of it, right, in things I read and the lyrics of songs, and I just want to understand it, I need to. There has been muggle wars too, and I keep seeing it refered to, and trying to understand it without the context is hard. And, and, and I just had at one point this realisation that there is a whole parallel history that I know nothing about… I want to learn.”
He opened his eyes to darkness. Closed them again. He still felt tired, worn out beyond anything he could have imagined before all this had started to happen, but instead of feeling like he was falling down, sinking into the sludge of his mind, he felt strangely bouyant, like he was rising up. The pain was less all-compassing, somehow. It was still hard to think, but it felt possible. Merlin. Possible. It had been a long time since anything felt possible.
“They were strict and absurd, and feared a lot of things they didn’t know,” he settled on. “And they hadn’t been exposed to music, or what little they had been exposed to had been very bad, and so they just didn’t approve of it in general. And I didn’t make a fuss – it wasn’t like I knew what I was missing, after all.”
The other man looked mollified, in spite of the clumsily delivered apology, offering a sad smile in return. Sometimes Draco wished he was able to deliver every line with a punch, like his father was. Well, Lucius never would have apologised for something like this in the first place, so that was neither here nor there, and a punch of any sort would be unlikely to help the situation, come to think of it. What would his mother do, though? Just be graceful about it all, he supposed. Allow mistakes. Be discerning about what to share and who to share with, but when she did decide to share openly, fully – she would open her entire heart to the conversation, both in speaking and in listening. That was who he wanted to emulate – and who he had been learning to emulate, a little. He hoped. He needed to ask her about that.
“Thank you. I suppose you couldn’t have known that. And thank you for wanting to save me when you thought I was a prisoner in my own home. The truth is, with another man, I might have been.”
Then the chocolates arrived. The baskets were not for concealment of the gift, as Draco had assumed, but for display. Surprising, but quite lovely, he thought. Kenny was excited about his, but also insisted that it hadn’t been necessary, and didn’t this situation serve them both, after all?
“I’ve seen them, I think. Look, I can call the flower people and ask them if they also know how to go about getting chocolate delivered?”
And so they did that too, finding the number for the flowershop in a big, newspaperlike book with extremely thin pages. Draco hadn’t known he owned that book – he thought he had read every book in the house, but this one he had not even seen. “The biggest, loveliest bouquet they can make,” Draco insisted. “With yellow roses in it. Yellow roses are her favorite.”
“Well, I wasn’t about to let him know that, was I? How stupid do you think I am, Granger? So now you’ve moved on to insulting me instead of my husband, is that it? Well, if we’re done being polite, not that you ever were, you can take your phone, and stick –”
“I’m not… cool with it,” was all he could say. “I’ve been learning, while sick. It’s not enough, though, I know that.”
“I read this book,” Draco would often say, “this muggle book – ” And usually Harry would laugh at Draco’s sci-fi adventures, but admit he hadn’t read the book in question. He wasn’t big on reading, generally he prefered to just watch a film for entertainment, and even that made him restless. He had seen a lot of them when he was too ill to do much. Draco hadn’t, he had gotten dizzy whenever he tried and given it up.
“Hey, so, if you’re okay with it, we’ll just start off by Hermione owling your mother to let her that you’re safe, alive, and partly recovered, and that we have found a way to establish regular contact. Oh, and that we will probably be able to establish contact sometime within the next week. And then Hermione will call me later and we can get into the details. How does that sound for you?”
As Harry was talking, Draco was belatedly struck by the strangeness of having Harry Potter in his living room. He looked more grown up, but not very different, except for his muggle clothes. He was wearing jeans and a forest green hooded sweater, and a light brown leather jacket over that. The jacket had seen better days, but the rest of the clothes looked neat enough. He had a pair of big earphones slung around his neck, and somehow he looked too large for the space, so much taller than Draco in his wheelchair, so much taller than Mary, too, so much broader than… well, anyone Draco had seen in years, certainly.
