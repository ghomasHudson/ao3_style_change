, Draco once wrote to Harry, in a lovely letter that Harry still keeps folded up in his wallet, preserved with a multitude of charms so he can carry it around like the secret love he’s harboured for Draco these long years, maybe even forever, maybe even since Draco first shot up into the sky on a broomstick with a stolen Remembrall and he went flying after.
Harry tears his gaze away from the befuddling scene unfolding before him and reaches out to grasp Draco’s wrist. ‘What’s happening?’ he asks.
They had a favourite place - a small, charming Italian restaurant - that they would go to after a long day wandering up and down streets and dropping into bookshops and cafes and galleries. There’s some irony in having Italian food in Paris, but it really was the best place to sit and watch the world go by - with large, curved windows that would open in the summer, so Draco could smoke without having to sit outside. They also had really, really good coffee.
Draco manages to compose himself by the time Astoria releases him. He adjusts his shirt and waistcoat, drawing himself up to his full height as he turns his attention towards the binder Stephen has set upon the desk.
Malfoy gives him a scathing look. ‘Oh, sure, Potter,’ he says, voice dripping with sarcasm. ‘I’ll just stroll up to the Dark Lord, shall I? Tell him I’m not interested in his little side-quest anymore, thanks ever so much.’ He shakes his head. ‘You really have less brains than a flobberworm, Potter.’
‘Piss off, Malfoy,’ Potter says fondly, and this time he slaps Draco’s leg with the flat of his hand. ‘Come on, I’m getting hungry.’
Draco smothers his laughter by taking another sip of his martini. ‘Oh, but isn’t that your speciality?’ he grins, and Harry doesn’t need to be Legilimens to know what scenes are flashing through his mind. ‘Broken toes?’
Draco’s eyes are wide in the dark. The moon is bright but there are shadows everywhere and Harry can’t see, can’t tell what Draco’s thinking, doesn’t know anything except the thorny garden in his chest that overflows and fills him up until he’s choking on the many-petalled bloom.
‘Sorry Harry,’ Hagrid says, very earnestly. ‘You really aren’t very tall, are you? Well, anyhow, you
Harry’s brain screams - and he bites the thin line of his lip, ‘but I don’t think you should. Don’t lay a feast out for me tonight, not when I’m feeling so remarkably greedy.’
Harry knows it’s not one reason. It’s a hundred, a thousand reasons piled on top of each other, and Ginny’s just had enough of it - the fights, Harry’s temper, his out-of-control magic, his nightmares, the way he doesn’t sleep, the way he doesn’t talk about things that normal people talk about.
Hermione looks thoughtful for a moment, then angry, and then her jaw hardens with determination. ‘Nobody’s bothered to charge Lucius with the kidnapping and attempted murder,’ she says. ‘So that’s not part of the plea deal. He can be charged with that and we can put him away - for good.’
One attack leaves him covered in harrowing scars down the back of his skull and neck. The wounds make even the Healers blanch, but Draco looks Harry straight in the eye, insults his hospital buzzcut and hands him a hair-growing potion.
‘S’ unpleasant,’ Teddy confirms. He props his chin on Draco’s shoulder and peers down at the letter. ‘You shouldn’t be up so late, Uncle Draco. Sleep’s important.’
Harry kisses the top of Draco’s head affectionately. ‘Nah,’ he says. ‘Always thought you were too tall to qualify as a twink.’
Victoire meets them next to a rollercoaster that winds and weaves through the woods, wearing a Minnie Mouse headband and a mustard-yellow shirt that reads
‘And so polite,’ Michelle praises, wiping her ruby-red lipstick off his face with a thumb. She towers a good three inches over Harry, dark-haired and outrageously stunning for a witch her age. Sometimes she feels a little larger than life. ‘You are my favourite boy. I love it when you come visit.’
There were nights when Draco would get quiet, and his eyes would take on a haunted look, and he would say horrible things about himself that made Harry want to cry or scream or shake Draco until he stopped.
, and she talks at a volume usually only achievable with a Sonorous. ‘It looks good, but if there’s almonds, I’m going to need to make a run for Madame Pomfrey.’
It feels a little bit like being back at Hogwarts, only without the bullying and hexing, but Harry’s not sure he’s happy with that. This is Malfoy’s party. He should be sitting at the centre of it, not off to the side. But he doesn’t say anything, and enjoys the gentle buzz of alcohol as it overtakes him and makes all the sharp edges of the world smooth and lovely.
Malfoy tilts his head slightly as he studies Harry carefully. His eyes are so pale they might have no colour at all.  ‘You are?’
‘Harry James Potter,’ she pronounces, attacking each syllable with perfect accuracy. ‘I have a bone to pick with you.’
Draco’s smile slips out of his face and his gaze is more intense than looking directly into the sun. ‘I want to build a forever with you too,’ he says. ‘If that’s something you still want.’
It sits on the top of a hill with a view of a nearby beach, with a tiled roof, white-washed walls, a delightful brick chimney, and a cerulean post-box out front which Harry helped paint by hand. If Harry turns to the left, he can see the moonlight reflecting off the sea, and the foam glowing silver over the briny water as the waves rush towards the sandy shore. There is a copse of trees just behind Draco’s house, and beyond that, the steeple of a church that rings out just a little too loudly every Sunday.
not the Chosen One, saviour of the wizarding world, defeater of the Dark Lord himself.’ She reaches forward and takes his hand, squeezing it slightly. Her palms are soft, and her grip is strong. ‘And, unlike a certain buffoon I am inordinately fond of, I was never considered the best tracker in the DMLE.’
Harry’s jaw drops. ‘As in, fucked Oliver Wood into a three-day stupor, Blaise?’ he utters. ‘What - why didn’t I recognize him?’
‘I’ll just be up for a little while longer,’ Draco manages to say through the tightness in his throat.
‘Oh, I’ll make them care,’ Hermione says, like it’s a threat, and it probably is, because she’s an absolute terror to behold once she channels all that rage and stubbornness into her work.
‘Yes,’ Draco replies, each of his words pronounced with great care, ‘but I thought that was just the result of unresolved sexual tension.’
Harry watches and waits as the pieces of the puzzle come clicking together for Proudfoot. The Auror’s face pales, and his outrage and confusion turn slowly into guilt.
The ledger flicks forward a few pages. Proudfoot’s jaw twitches as he adjusts his grip on the volume, sitting up now in the chair. His brow is furrowed all the way up to his hairline.
Narcissa’s gaze slides off Harry and settles somewhere behind his shoulder. ‘So thoughtful of him,’ she says, as though Harry hadn’t said a word. ‘Draco was always such a thoughtful boy. A good boy.’ She lifts her cup halfway to her lips, then sets it back into the saucer. ‘Too good,’ she murmurs. ‘Too… too good.’
Warmth bleeds into his cold, empty life. He adopts a cat. He makes friends. He learns how to make potions that clear acne and soothe rheumatoid aches. He learns how to find a space in this new world and its new rules.
Pansy barks out a laugh and rolls her eyes. ‘If?’ she says incredulously. ‘You’re Harry fucking Potter. You can Apparate along ley lines. You had such a high case rate when you were an Auror that you broke the record. And even if you weren’t Boy Wonder, Potter,’ she adds, shaking her head, ‘you two are locked in an orbit that not even the Dark Lord could break. You were made to find each other. To be together.’
He’s read the Auror reports three times. Unspeakable Zabini owled them directly to him after their meeting in Harry’s classroom. The leads are solid - Lucius
Hermione rubs her hand over her eyes. ‘Ron’s taken the kids to stay at the Burrow,’ she replies. ‘A couple of people are coming over later to… to figure our next steps. I don’t want them to- I just want them somewhere safe.’
Luna puts on another kettle. Ron holds Hermione tightly as she begins to cry, tears dragging black tracks of molten mascara down her cheeks, her shoulders shaking with wave after wave of shuddering sobs, a dam finally rupturing after being filled to the brink, and this is how Draco knows that these are the first tears she has shed since they took Harry away.
He’s never been good at untangling, or clearing up his messes - since he was just a child, his approach has always been to just shove it somewhere and deal with it later.
‘I don’t want to know,’ Teddy cuts him off with a disgusted look. ‘Also,’ he adds, frowning at each of them in turn, ‘one of you
; shaking hands clenched into fists, singe-marks on old floorboards; and afterwards, Harry’s wiry body leaning into Draco’s, his voice muffled by the lapel of Draco’s coat;
This is not a Ginny-bashing fic - Ginny is a badass and generally a good-time gal and also is Worried about Harry because 50% of this fic is people worrying about Harry and then 50% is a 'Where's Draco mystery'.
‘Auror Smythe, is it?’ he asks, as pleasant as a diplomat making their first introduction. ‘My family has come a very long way for this wedding. I don’t think they appreciate you making us lose face in this manner on such an important day. I really think it would be in your best interest to just leave. You really don't want to escalate this any further.’
‘Ah, yes,’ Narcissa says, setting down her glass. ‘Then you have not seen the redecorations. Please,’ she says, rising to her feet in one graceful, liquid motion. ‘I must show you how lovely they are. Draco chose them, you see. He has such excellent taste.’
Luna comes by on the third day. She presses a kiss into Draco’s temple, hangs a charm above his bed (all glittering crystals and pieces of brilliantly-coloured wooden beads), and reads him an entire issue of the Quibbler, cover-to-cover.
Neville plucks the butterbeer bottle and raises it up in a toast. ‘Horcrux privileges,’ he salutes, and downs half of the bottle.
The reverse-engineering hasn’t gone all too well. He’s thrown countless variations of protective spells together onto his model - the glowing orb that Ron is gawping at - that he knows will reproduce the effects in the manual, but none of them
curse?’ he exclaims, whirling upon Proudfoot. Even with the cosmetic charms, Blaise towers a good foot over the older wizard. ‘In what fucking realm of reality did you think
Ginny clucks her tongue and shakes her head as she watches him go. She looks so much like Molly that it makes Harry’s heart twist out of shape. He wonders if there would be anyone alive who could tell him if he looked like his father - or his mother, even.
‘Destroy it,’ Draco says firmly before Harry can open his mouth. A dark cloud flits over his face, drawing his eyes into shadow. ‘I was not the only person forced to work on that thing. It might not use any Dark magic, but a thing stained with that much pain and death is bound to grow cursed over time.’
The wall behind the settee folds outward like crisp paper, revealing a second, smaller apartment, lit by a hundred lights embedded into the walls. There are papers scattered over the small cot in the corner of the room, over the desk, on the floor, and pinned to the walls. Draco kneels on the ground and Lucius stands above him, his wand pointed at the back of his son’s neck.
Draco’s impressed upon Harry the importance of never showing up empty-handed, so Harry picks up a bouquet of  peonies and a box of lavender macarons before Apparating directly to Narcissa’s front door. He rings the doorbell and steps back, tucking the macarons under his arm and readjusting his grip on the flowers. They still need some time before they bloom properly, but an afternoon in some water will do the trick just fine.
A familiar weight presses against the small of Harry’s back. ‘Come on,’ murmurs Draco, just beside Harry’s right ear. ‘Blaise will take care of the rest. Let’s go home.’
He drops his phone by his head and pulls the covers over his chin. He listens to the wind batter the walls of the building and watches the snow fling itself against his single-glazed windows. He should turn the heating up but he cannot find the strength to move further than this safe cocoon of lavender-scented detergent and fuzzy socks. Artemis curls over his head and licks his brows in a valiant attempt to cheer him up, and it almost makes him cry harder because of how much this silly little creature loves him.
Draco’s face, already so pale, turns nearly bone-white. He presses his clenched fist against his mouth, his eyes wandering towards the fire as his expression turns hunted. ‘I can’t say I’m surprised,’ he says softly. ‘My father usually gets what he wants.’
Draco wrinkles his nose disgustedly at the mention of the phenomenal unpleasantness that was Dolores Umbridge. ‘Only because I was an insufferable git obsessed with winning approval of anyone in power. Next excuse.’
The first time Harry meets Daphne Greengrass is at Goldren’s country house in Dorset. Draco’s moving out to Cornwall to open up his own apothecary, so Goldren’s having a big, no-expense-spared party for the newly-qualified Potions Master.
He already knows he’s going to say yes. How could he not? It’s the perfect job. He’ll be going back home, to the one place that never asked him to be anything but himself. He will finally be doing something useful with his abilities, nurturing instead of tearing things down, helping instead of harming.
‘Now then children, let’s not fight,’ George says lightly. ‘Harry, sit down before you pass out or sick up. Ron, shut up and go make us some tea.’
Harry slots the stems of both drink glasses through his fingers and shakes Daphne’s hand. As soon as Harry’s palm touches hers, a shock of energy snaps up his arm like he’s been electrocuted. He yanks his hand away with a wince.
He is quicksilver. He is the gasping white froth that rides the dark ocean waves as they roll into shore, and as certain as the currents that run deep beneath the surface.
‘Don’t gang up on me,’ Harry says, levelling a look at Draco, who only smiles innocently back at him. ‘Two against one is unfair.’
Draco shakes his head in exasperation, but the corners of his mouth are tugging upwards into a smile. ‘Well, Daphne?’ he says, glancing at their old classmate. ‘Are you pleased with your experiment?’
Harry only knows the person who stole the Remembrall from Neville, who sneered at Harry’s friends and called them nasty slurs, who stomped on Harry’s nose and left him to choke on the blood. He doesn’t know this Malfoy, who writes things like,
Neville ducks down to give Ginny a smacking kiss on her cheek. ‘I’m on it, babe,’ he promises. He winks once at Harry before heading back into the house through the conservatory.
Draco braces himself on the sink, his hands bracketing Harry’s thighs. ‘Really?’ he smirks. ‘I’ve had remarkable success so far.’
When Harry’s eyes start to burn uncomfortably from staring at the same report for too long, he takes a self-inking quill and some parchment out onto the balcony and writes a stack of letters to officially request information from the Aurors who worked Lucius’s case all those years ago. At least one of them should be able to point him in the right direction.
‘Stephen is their New York liaison,’ Astoria chimes in. She slings her arm through her husband’s and looks up at him, full of love and pride.
Smythe glowers at Harry. He pulls his wand out of his holster and strides towards the nearest cabinet. ‘I’m afraid we’ll have to inspect them,’ he announces.
Draco arches an eyebrow at Harry. ‘Now, I could be losing my memory in my old age,’ he says, ‘but didn’t you run a club in fifth year where you taught a bunch of incompetent children to duel Death Eaters? With surprising success, I might add.’
Harry’s too old for this level of stress. McGonagall is going to kill Harry. She’s going to rip his spleen out and make him eat it. That’s if the Burns family don’t order a hitwizard on him first. ‘
‘Might have to do a bit of running between the two,’ Teddy replies, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms over his chest.
‘And what happened to me is not your fault,’ Draco says. ‘There was nothing you could have done, Pansy.’
Harry stares at them, wondering why he’s suddenly reminded of the Weasley Twins (which picks at old scars he’d rather leave alone), or why he feels like he’s back in the workroom in the Department of Mysteries, stuck with a bunch of swots who want to spend a perfectly good summer arguing the mechanics of time versus death.
They’re out with Luna at Daphne at Fortescue’s, when a gaggle of witches stop at their booth on their way out. They’re so young, Harry is certain he’s seen their faces in the Hogwarts graduation ceremony last year. They press up against the table, giggling, pushing copies of last month’s Witch Weekly into Draco’s hands and asking him for his autograph. Draco’s smile is pinched as he complies, but he’s perfectly polite.
‘To answer your other question,’ Harry says, ‘apparently Draco’s not been turning up to work for the past week. I think he’s probably gone to De Haan to escape the heat.’
Crabbe had his own family whispering poison into his ear, his own twisted understanding of the world, his own desires that drove him down that awful, terrible path. And at the end of the day, they were all children made into cannon fodder by the people who should have kept them safe.
Draco feels a part of his heart cave in, an overripe fruit pressed too hard beneath an unforgiving thumb. He reaches across the table to take Hermione’s hand in his. ‘Less of that, please, Advocate Granger-Weasley,’ he says. ‘You need rest.’
‘That was quite an impressive display, Potter,’ says Malfoy’s voice from above him, the usual bite somehow missing from his words. ‘Would you like to set the Department of Mysteries on fire next, perhaps?’
They sit in comfortable silence for a while, watching the stream roll by. There are butterflies flitting over the sparkling water, a whole flock of them dancing over the water’s edge and skipping over shining pebbles. The wind picks up, and the treetops bend and dance in time. The sky is a feather-brushed array of brilliant blue, and the clouds are beginning to take on a golden hue as the afternoon grows old.
‘A ring?’ Harry utters, his heart fluttering in his chest, but before he can say anything else, Ginny tackles him off his chair and onto the ground, the force of it sending his glasses flying off his face and skittering into the kitchen.
Draco’s shoulders lift in a bone-weary sigh. His gaze wanders over Pansy’s shoulder and he spots Harry standing there in the archway with the tray in his hands.
‘Yes, well.’ Malfoy sighs heavily. ‘I’m not exactly welcome in most wizarding establishments. And they do a good chai latte here.’
Harry’s gaze drifts away from his guests, outwards to the edge of the table where the light is dimmest - and there he spots Blaise and Charlie sitting together beneath the branches of a young lemon tree. Blaise’s hand is curled within Charlie’s palm, his face soft and unguarded and his eyes wide and almost fearful, even as Charlie reaches up to cup his free hand around the back of Blaise’s neck.
It’s a beautiful afternoon. From Harry’s classroom, he can see the Forbidden Forest stretch out onwards, the leaves so bright the forest seems aflame. He’s got one of the windows cracked open, cold, autumn air drifting in and bringing with it the sweet smell of damp leaves.
Harry feels his shame spread through him, locking his joints and churning his gut. Since Harry set foot in Hogwarts, Neville’s been nothing but nice to Harry - because he’s a good friend and always has been. He’s always been kind and honest and selfless and helpful.
Harry’s Anchors are at their lowest setting so that he can feel as much of the Lopez Panic Room as possible when he starts weaving George’s spell. There are a multitude of charms keeping the apartment running. Each and every one of them whisper to Harry as he treads over the ornate rug towards Narcissa’s living room. It’s unpleasant - there’s a ringing in his ear and an ache building behind his eyes, but he can still focus through it.
’ He pulls their clasped hands up to his chest, where his heart hammers away as though eager to escape the confines of flesh, blood, and bone. ‘What about Ghent? What about when I told you I wanted to build a forever with you? Did you think that was unresolved sexual tension?’
‘If I let myself have this,’ Draco says softly, sadly, ‘I shall lose you as soon as you sober up and come to your senses. I can’t lose you, Harry.’
‘I’m going to murder the first person who attempts that,’ Daphne says calmly. It does not sound like an empty threat.
‘I’ll find him,’ Harry says, because that’s how they are, him and Draco, Draco and him. ‘I always do.’
Draco stares at him. ‘No, Potter,’ he says, resisting the urge to flick the other man in the forehead. ‘That is not how potions work.’
‘I want this,’ he says. ‘Every Christmas. For the rest of my life.’ He sighs, and his breath curls in visible plumes of moisture against the icy air. ‘Promise me we’ll spend them all together, until I’m old and decrepit, and you have to carry me everywhere with your big, strong arms.’
‘Per-fect,’ Healer Thompson says, tapping her clipboard again. ‘Is it the address we have on record for you, Professor?’
But he won’t. If he does, he’ll never stop running - and he’s done enough running for a hundred lifetimes. Besides, he has someone waiting for him.
But he also remembers that one moonless night he sat drinking in Draco’s Muggle apartment (the telly playing in the background, empty wine glasses on the kitchen table, the quiet rumble of Artemis purring away contentedly). He remembers the quiet confessions whispered to him on the floor in front of the sofa, words that ripped through his heart and left a bitter taste in his mouth (
‘Harry.’ Draco lifts Harry’s hand off his chest and turns it over so that he can kiss into Harry’s palm. ‘Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. The only person who is responsible for this scar is the person who cast the curse.’
Harry wonders if perhaps it is the change in a person that makes one seek places of light and warmth, or if it is the warmth and light of a place that might change a person. He thinks about Draco, that first night at Costa’s, and his heart twists savagely in his chest.
‘It’s going to be alright, Harry,’ Hermione says, softly, with undeserved kindness. ‘He’ll pull through.’
given you Power of Attorney in the case that he is unaccounted for forty-eight hours. As such, all ledgers are now available for your inspection.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘Not the way I get angry,’ he replies. ‘I’m better at cooling down usually, but it’s so loud in there with all the spells and it being a wizarding inn and all the wands and just-’ he breaks off, feeling stupid.
Draco closes his eyes, feeling suddenly overwhelmed by the mountain of emotions building up in this tiny room. He thinks of the silence of Grimmauld Place, a corpse gutted of its heart and soul. He thinks of the way Harry
Harry suddenly knows, with horrifying certainty, that all those failed dates and awful lovers don’t even matter, because he’ll never fall in love with anyone else. But he can’t say it. He just doesn’t know how to put those words into motion, not when he doesn’t know if he deserves it yet.
‘Oh, I’m sure I understand,’ Draco snorts. ‘I’m pretty fucked up too. Maybe even more fucked up than you.’
Except then Malfoy appears, pale and skeletal, twitching from curse damage, and the crazy bastard lies to a room full of Death Eaters.
‘I’m fine, Harry,’ he says out loud. ‘Besides, you look far more handsome when you aren’t emulating a mother hen.’
, rising up around him in a tidal wave - the gentle warmth radiating from his body, the cold press of his fingers against the back of Harry’s hands, the slope of the bed that gives way to his weight, his magic enveloping them in its soothing embrace, the blurry shape of his shoulders and the rise of his cheekbone and the dip of his cupid’s bow.
Harry drags his too-long hair out of his eyes and casts his gaze upon the fruits of his labour. Rolls of parchment are stacked to Harry’s left, ready to be sent off to Blaise for processing. He’s listed everything he can about the case - the gruelling investigation that led him from Belgium to France, the spells and modifiers involved in locating the panic room, the precise methods used to open it. He has yet to start the report on the raid - the duel, the curse, the improbable Apparation.
The corner of Blaise’s mouth tightens. He shifts his weight again, dancing from one foot to the next (an old nervous tic from learning ballet under his mother’s strict instructions). ‘They’ll let him out if he agrees to another modifier tattoo,’ he reveals, wincing even as he pronounces the words. ‘One that cuts him off from his magic. All his magic. Permanently.’
Draco’s fingers flit over the fern leaf-shaped pin at his throat as he surveys his reflection gravely. It glows the same colour as his eyes - a silver starburst against the severe black of his formal robes. It was a gift from Andromeda, a going-away present given when Draco first left England.
He moves out of the Manor as soon as his house arrest ends. The further he gets from that horrible, Dark-stained place, the lighter he feels - so he keeps on going, and going, until he finds himself a small, cheap apartment in Muggle London. He is not permitted to use magic until after parole, and yet the restriction is more a relief than a burden. He doesn’t fit very well in the Muggle world, but he adjusts rather quickly. The anonymity is freeing. He can rebuild. Reinvent. Become something different.
Everything seems more saturated, somehow. Harry feels as though he has fallen into a pocket world of sweet moonlight. He can feel everything and yet, somehow, the only thing he can feel is
Draco’s breath catches in his throat. His love for Harry has deep roots, and he feels them reach further down towards his core as he looks into those lightning-green eyes, pinned down by the intensity of that unflinching gaze. ‘Why?’ he whispers.
Michelle’s forehead wrinkles. ‘Ah, no,’ she replies with a slight shake of the head. ‘I do not have it. But it should be with the Paris lawyer.’
‘I can’t change our past,’ Draco tells Harry, ‘no matter how much I want to. But,’ he adds, his voice taking on a hard, determined tone, ‘you’re not going to be a tragedy. I’m not going to be a tragedy. We’re going to have
Pansy has no idea what he’s trying to do, of course. He hopes she won’t ask too much about how far he’s gotten with the case. There are things he just can’t tell her - things that he’s had to keep secret as soon as he started working for the Department of Mysteries. Things about the black lines of ink tattooed onto his arms, and the other things he’s learned how to do.
‘You haven’t responded to any of our letters,’ Ron says, relentless in his tirade, ‘haven’t been answering any of our calls - I had to resort to talking to Pansy. Daphne and Luna were supposed to go on honeymoon, I’ll have you know, but instead Daphne’s here trying to keep you from-’ he breaks off, blinking at the papers scattered across the bed and table, and then up at the glowing structure floating in the middle of the room.
, of course, you mean the Dark Lord trying to murder you on an annual, semi-annual basis,’ Malfoy said dryly, tilting his head to each side in emphasis.
He leans into the gentle hand pressed against the small of his back, humming happily as it slides over to his waist and pulls him close. Draco has gained most of the weight back, under Healer Thompson’s strict potion regimen. He is a solid, warm presence at Harry’s side, his magic a sanctuary amidst so many wand-users.
But there, above Draco’s lip - a tiny scar from where Teddy accidentally flew his broom into Draco’s face ten years ago.
responds to Hermione. Not once since the trials has Draco missed a message. As loathe as he is to admit it, his Draco-on-vacation theory is looking a little shaky.
‘Yeah,’ Harry says. ‘I can Apparate from Brussels to, er, maybe the opposite side of the Forbidden Forest, and that would be a pretty great way to stick it to the Ministry after the whole arrest shitshow, but it’s hardly ideal if I’ve got to be in the Great Hall before breakfast starts every morning, y’know?’
He peels his jacket off his shoulders and throws it over the only available seat left - which, incidentally, is next to Blaise. The Unspeakable rises smoothly from his seat, striding into the kitchen only to return a moment later with a plate of food for Charlie.
‘Yeah, he hasn’t written to me, either,’ Harry nods. ‘But he does go off the grid from time to time.’
He starts with the Anchors. They hum softly against his skin, further down into the fibres of his muscles, and he lets them spread outwards through his veins - that soft, quiet brush of snow-soft magic that’s become as familiar to him as the weight of his glasses. Then, he reaches outwards, gathering in every last whisper and scream of magic woven into the fabric of the apartment, letting it dig with talons and claws into his magic until he can taste the heat of burnout in his mouth. He can taste the spellwork on the magical portraits, the protective charms keeping the wallpaper new and the floors clean. He reaches and reaches and reaches - until suddenly something chimes in harmony with the vibration of his Anchors.
Harry can’t seem to find Malfoy anywhere, after the trials. He’s nowhere and everywhere at once, and it’s infuriating, because all Harry wants to do is return Malfoy’s wand.
‘Oh, we’re quite alright now,’ Daphne tells him with a smile. ‘I’m still working on a cure, but between my research and Goldren’s treatments, Astoria’s as healthy as the next person. But we’re not talking about my sister. Will you Transfigure that glass in your left hand into a goldfish bowl for me, please?’
‘Merlin,’ Harry utters. His eyes feel too hot and too heavy for his skull. As he looks back up at Draco, his vision grows blurry. ‘
‘Three litres of blood,’ he responds, when Hermione asks him how much blood he found in the panic room. He looks mildly nauseous, then, and adds, ‘There was more in the bathroom. Six litres, total.’
‘Would the Wizengamot even care what happened to an ex-Death Eater?’ Draco says, his voice lead-heavy with resignation.
rendered asunder by miles and miles of ocean and land separating them) is to ask for a gift that the universe is not ready to give someone as undeserving as Harry.
It is simple enough work finding the corresponding dates. Like a blackbird perched in a tree, they are easier to find once you know what you’re looking for. Draco cross-checks them with the Malfoy family ledger, bending slightly over the table as he runs his fingers down the records lightly.
Pansy sits on the steps of Grimmauld Place, cat-eye sunglasses perched on the top of her head as she leans back to soak in the rays of the late afternoon sun. A glossy shopping bag is perched on the edge of the very top step, the White Company logo embossed on its side. She grins lazily at Harry and Draco as they approach and wiggles her fingers in greeting.
Paris is a place that unfolds slowly, revealing secret compartments only after you’ve unlocked everything else and fallen a little in love with what you find there. Perhaps there’s some magic in that, the kind that Muggles talk about, not the practical kind that Harry uses when he’s cleaning his dishes or fixing his broken glasses.
‘Hm,’ says Daphne. Her eyes travel from the Transfigured glass bowl to Harry’s face, and then over to Draco. ‘Alright, then, Harry. My hours are Wednesdays from two and Saturdays from eleven. You will show up promptly on time.’
‘Bureaucrat,’ Harry replies. He nods towards the bartender, gesturing at his now-empty glass of whiskey sour. ‘I’ve stepped on some toes recently.’
P.S. In case any of you are wondering, Artemis is not living with Draco in Brussels because Artemis wasn’t exactly a kitten when he was adopted and passed peacefully at the ripe old age of 21 (at Draco’s best estimate) surrounded by lovely things and his favourite brand of catnip. Also, I’m gonna go back and edit Aretmis’ gender for consistency once this is all done because apparently I can’t remember anything, my brain is a sieve, wow.
having anything to do with that nasty, pathetic excuse of a wizard. Lucius deserves to rot in Azkaban for the rest of his natural life for what he did.
‘You captured Rowle after six days’ pursuit,’ the Unspeakable replies, as though that’s a suitable explanation. ‘Surely two weeks is ample time to conduct an investigation.’
, and he’s never wanted anything more than he wants this forever, this beautiful quiet tea-in-the-morning, sunshine-through-drawn-curtains forever, and he is so full of light and love that he might burn into cinders and fly up through the chimney.
He made a promise to Harry, years ago in a dingy alleyway stinking of piss and cheap booze - and he does not break his promises.
‘I don’t mean that,’ she sighs, leaning forwards to rescue Harry’s hair from her daughter’s grasp. ‘You’re burning the candle at both ends. I know you’re young, and single, and popular and this is just, I don’t know, a quarter-life crisis or whatever Ron says it is. But I don’t think you’re happy. I don’t think it’s healthy.’
Perhaps it is morbid curiosity that drives him to walk deep into its ruins, or perhaps he is a glutton for punishment these days, desperate for barbs to dig into old sores. It is all still ash and decimation, and Harry doesn’t know if the old beast has opened its doors to a single soul since the day of the Battle.
‘He did,’ Andromeda states flatly. ‘As difficult as it may be for you to comprehend, my cousin was neither villain nor hero. He was just a boy who loved his family, trusted in them deeply. He never thought they would tell him lies, corrupt him, and twist him to their agenda. But they did. They planted rotten seeds in his heart and let them grow.’
Draco’s smile fades and he narrows his eyes slightly. ‘But how did you find the room?’ he asks. ‘It’s hidden very well. No spell can locate it, modifiers or not. I’ve hired the best Cursebreakers to try.’
while Draco reshelves the non-fiction section. His hair is almost too-long, falling into his eyes as he worries his bottom lip with his teeth.
Draco drops his head onto Harry’s shoulder and sighs. ‘I do apologize for keeping you away from your students,’ he murmurs.
Draco places a thin chip of ice between his lips. It’s all Harry’s allowed for the time being, until his organs grow back. Cold water slips down Harry’s parched throat, soothing it momentarily. This is part of the routine too - Harry opening his eyes, trying to speak, and coughing helplessly until Draco feeds him ice. It would be pretty pathetic if it wasn’t for the fact that it’s a bloody miracle that Harry’s here at all.
Ron’s eyebrows shoot up. ‘Oh!’ he cries. ‘Yes!’ He claps his hands and laughs. ‘Oh, why didn’t we think of it before?’
‘Now I understand Icarus’s folly,’ he whispers into the crook of Harry’s neck. ‘I, too, would set myself aflame, singe my skin with molten wax and burnt feathers, to kiss but one divot -’ his hand sweeps down, fingers splaying possessively at the small of Harry’s back - ‘here at the base of your spine.’
Draco nods and makes a soft, humming noise in his throat in distracted agreement. His fingertips twitch in an aborted movement, but as always, the scar is safely hidden under the long sleeves of his button-up. ‘The Mark is on the wrong side,’ he says. ‘I must admit I am rather surprised they decided to include that in…
It is quiet in Grimmauld Place as Draco drags the nib of his quill against parchment. It is a good letter. An effective letter. It has hard edges and polite threats, and just enough flattery to sweeten its bitter medicine.
He loves Potter. He loves him and will always love him, even after death, even after they have both become ashes and atoms floating in the great expanse of the quiet universe.
When they were six, they used to play together in the Manor gardens, collecting flowers and peacock feathers to make bouquets for Astoria. Astoria was too small, too weak to be allowed outside, so Draco suggested they bring the outside to her. But that was before Lucius decided that flower-picking was unseemly for a Malfoy and forced Draco to take up potions and duelling instead. Any friendship that Draco might have formed with Daphne was extinguished quickly.
‘You can’t do this,’ says Hermione, the warrant still clutched in her hand, her knuckles bone-white. ‘
Fortunately, he doesn’t have to wait to find out, because Draco clears his throat loudly, drawing all the attention to him.
And Draco is lovely and patient and beautiful, and he smiles like Harry is the most wonderful thing in the world.
‘Well, clearly I’m not,’ Pansy retorts. She lurches to her feet, wobbling a little on her ridiculously tall platform shoes. ‘Got you a get-well-soon present,’ she says brightly, shoving the shopping bag into Draco’s hands.
‘Oh,’ says Narcissa softly. She looks at Harry, tilting her head slightly. ‘Did Draco tell you to come too? He asks Pansy to come by on weekdays, you see. Did he tell you to visit too, Mr. Potter?’
He knows it’s not even six in the morning in England, but Harry didn’t sleep last night. There’s a rush of adrenaline that always hits him in the first few days of working a case, and it usually makes him restless enough to pace around his suite. Besides, as far as he’s concerned, Blaise deserves to be woken up at the crack of dawn with an international Floo call for the absolute hell he’s put Harry through these past few days.
phone,’ corrects Harry, wondering how Ginny’s managed to make it through this many years with Hermione as her sister-in-law with this sort of vocabulary.
‘If you end here, then all you will have accomplished in your lifetime are the things your father wanted you to,’ she says, full of fury (but not against him,
Harry shakes his head, still feeling a bit lost. ‘Yes, but Ron’s not trying out for the Tornados, Gin.’
A strange expression grows behind Blaise’s carefully maintained mask. ‘You’re a feral creature when you’re in love,’ he says, and he almost sounds impressed.
‘Not too bad, actually,’ comes the easy reply. ‘We’re coming onto exams in two weeks. It’s chaos and misery in the castle.’
From across the table, Andromeda smiles at her boys fondly. ‘I’ll go see if Teddy’s ready to wake up,’ she announces, and glides off into the other room.
that?’ Harry asks. He transfers one of the drinks back to his right hand, relishing the sensation of the cool glass against his burnt fingertips.
Draco meets his gaze for a second, and though he schools his expression as masterfully as befits the heir of the house of Malfoy, Harry can see the devastation in his eyes - that horrible, yawning sorrow that he’s seen in Hermione’s face and Ron’s and sometimes Andromeda’s, when she glimpses the many scars on his wrists and forearms. Except this hurts the way none of that hurt, because this is
‘Shall I tell you something else I noticed in that ledger there?’ Draco asks Proudfoot. ‘Each of those twelve payments perfectly match the cost of ingredients delivered to Selwyn Thestral - all save one. A payment made precisely one week before the Diagon Incident. And isn’t it funny,’ he adds, soft and dangerous like a knife kissing a bared throat, ‘that that last payment is probably large enough to buy a house in Surrey? Maybe, say, one like the house Robards bought that same year?’
‘I see,’ says Andromeda. ‘If this is the measure by which you judge others, then it seems my nephew must be martyred to be worthy of your consideration. Thank you, but I think I have enough martyrs in my family.’
- and makes a big deal of preparing afternoon tea for them. Harry manages to negotiate control of the teapot from the overly enthusiastic House Elf, and herds everyone into the living room. The sky is a little overcast, and the muggy heat belies a possible thunderstorm later in the day, but Harry’s got a strict temperature-control spell on in his living room to keep it nice and cool in the suffocating summer.
There is a parliament of owls waiting beyond the wards of Grimmauld Place. Harry can feel the impatient crackle of the Floo about to flare to life. The world will descend upon them with all of its chaos soon enough - but for now all Harry wants to do is lie here in the sweet pool of Draco’s magic and know that this delight of a man has moved heaven and earth for him - to know that he is so loved.
inside of me, let it spread its sickness inside of me. He wanted me there in the darkness with him.’
He thinks of Malfoy on the train, eyes bruised and face twisted in fear, frustration, and rage. Malfoy’s foot coming down on Harry’s face. Malfoy’s wand whipping out towards Harry, his face contorted with fury and hatred.
Harry feels ugly, cold panic slither down his throat, building frost in his stomach. He forces himself to remain calm, forces himself to meet his fiancé’s panicked eyes and smile calmly.
‘Is this your attempt at small talk? You’re abysmal at this.’ Malfoy leans forwards and the light catches in his eyes. He’s so damn pretty, all silver and white-gold, soft and sharp all at once.
, you’d think that being stuck under six feet of rubble and debris for three days with six broken ribs and a metal bar shoved through your torso is a sufficient level of sacrifice and heroism.
Malfoy’s eyebrows arch. They’re a few shades darker than the shocking colour of his hair, but lighter than his lashes. Harry has no idea why he’s noticing these details now.
Harry grins. ‘Merlin, Daphne. You had me worried there for a moment that the Sorting Hat should’ve had you for Ravenclaw.’
Proudfoot sighs again, heavily, and turns on his heels, facing Harry properly for the first time since he walked into the Great Hall. ‘I’ll give it to you straight, Potter,’ the senior Auror says. ‘Malfoy’s gone missing, and we’re pretty sure he’s up to something.’
‘You interrupt me another time and I’ll hex your balls off,’ Harry says, pointing at Draco’s irritably handsome face.
The shop assistant is crouched behind the counter, unpacking something out of boxes. Harry glimpses a navy-blue, cable knit sweater and a shock of white-blond hair.
The taste of rubble and ash on his tongue triggers something in his mind - a raw, untreated wound - and suddenly he is fighting for breath, delirious with pain, choking on the stench of decay and burnt flesh, staring up in a darkness that is nearly impenetrable, knowing that he will die here, he will die underneath this brick and mortar and plaster and wood and steel, bleeding into the broken earth, and nobody will find him, nobody will miss him-
‘Have you heard anything?’ Hermione asks, for what might be the hundredth time since Harry’s arrest.
He holds out the macarons and flowers and smiles apologetically. ‘I know I should have owled,’ he says, ‘but I was in Paris and I thought it would be nice to drop by and see how you were.’
Malfoy turns his hand over, his long fingers encircling Harry’s wrist. The lights dancing over his body shudder out of existence, the spell coming to a close.
‘I wonder how he knows I like cars,’ Arthur says halfway through dessert, which is when Hermione confesses they’ve been writing regularly and Malfoy asked her what Arthur might like from the Muggle world.
Harry growls in affirmation, lifting his head off Draco’s shoulder. He swivels around and leans back against the sink, folding his arms over his chest. Draco lowers his chin slightly and watches him through his long, pale lashes, a fond smile curving his lips upwards. Harry wants to kiss him. Harry always wants to kiss him, though, so he pushes through the urge with practiced ease.
When he finishes, he turns the letter over and looks out past the doorway, into the darkness that stretches out in Grimmauld Place.
Draco looks unconvinced but says nothing to argue against Harry. He presses his teeth into his lower lip, taking a deep breath as though to steady himself. Harry reaches over and takes his hand, squeezing it in what he hopes is quiet reassurance. Draco flashes him a grateful smile, and Blaise rolls his eyes again.
Draco’s expression is a wreck of grief and pain as the Aurors cast horrible, invasive searching spells on Harry’s body. He shouldn't have to see this, shouldn’t have to watch. Harry tries to breathe through it, tries to sink down and focus on the Anchors. Their magic
Harry sighs heavily. He puts his glasses back on and sits up straight in his chair. ‘Is McGonagall going to order me to get rid of the tank?’ he asks Neville.
, and that simply won’t do, because then I find myself watching Weasley and Longbottom do their adorable little newlywed dance and all I can think about is you.’
‘Thank you,’ Draco sighs. He pulls away slightly, tilting his chin to meet Harry’s gaze. Dark, hair-thin veins spread out beneath his eyes like deep cracks forking over an icy pond. ‘For being here with me. I missed you terribly.’
The nurses blush and giggle each time Harry accompanies Draco to his check-ups. The papers print tear-jerking fluff pieces about the tortured boy forced into servitude under a monster - a very Blackbeard, Beauty-and-the-Beast tale that could not be further from the truth.
‘These curses were designed to hurt,’ Healer Thompson says, her face grim. ‘They can keep a person alive while inflicting the worst kind of torture upon them. I have not seen these sorts of injuries since the War, and I have certainly never seen them inflicted by someone on their own son. In my professional opinion, that requires a certain level of barbarity that I have rarely witnessed in my long years of working on this ward.’
Harry’s never heard Draco speak of the War like this before - awful in its unflinching candour. It’s not that Harry’s forgotten about the dark stretch of sixth year, nor the awful, unforgivable things that Draco has done. He can’t ever forget Katie floating in the air above as though underwater, her cheeks as white as the snow whirling around her, the chilling pitch of her scream. And he’ll never forget Ron - Ron’s eyes rolling into the back of his head, Ron’s pulse fluttering hummingbird-frantic beneath his fingertips, the blind panic of nearly losing yet another loved one to something stupid and senseless -
They push into the shop, marvelling at the sudden rush of warmth after the biting cold outside. It’s not terribly busy, but there’s a bit of a wait as they stand in line to order their drinks. Harry squints at the menu while they wait, before giving up and pulling off his glasses to wipe them clean. It’s a bit of a bother not being able to just spell them clean, but he can hardly do that in a room full of Muggles.
Neville’s family were never truly quite as well-off as the Malfoys or the Blacks, but they were comfortable enough to buy an Unplottable space of land in Wales where neither the National Trust nor the seasonal tourists would stumble across them. It’s a lovely little cottage for a young couple, but Ginny assures Harry that it’s fitted with the right charms if it ever needs space for more -
Draco’s hand is a vice on Harry’s arm. ‘These claims are outrageous,’ he states, his voice shaking with barely-contained anger. ‘Plenty of Aurors have done far worse in duels, and I don’t see you arresting them for it.’
‘Mr. Malfoy,’ she greets, pushing her spectacles back up from where they’ve slid to the tip of her nose. She smiles as she takes in Teddy’s appearance beside Harry. ‘Oh, how lovely. Is this your family?’
- and various charms dangle along the windowpane, glinting and sparkling slightly. Harry recognizes them as the ones Luna sends Draco each time he moves into a new place.
‘What the fuck do you think, Potter?’ Malfoy says. There is a strange blankness to his voice, one that makes Harry want to run in the opposite direction. Another tremor shudders up from his elbows, making his hands twitch, and he grimaces, baring his teeth.
Narcissa sips at her wine. ‘Go on,’ she says, gesturing at Blaise. It’s the same, strange, polite gesture Harry’s seen Draco produce a hundred times.
His fingers are gentle as follows the knobs of Harry’s spine down to his shoulder blades, gentle as he guides Harry’s head downwards to press their foreheads together. Harry can feel Draco’s breath on his face, coming in soft puffs, and Harry feels the air come shuddering up out of his lungs as he tries to clamp down on the sobs threatening to spill out of him.
Harry moves before his brain can catch up, vaulting over the back of the settee in one smooth, well-oiled motion.
Harry lifts his shoulder in a half-shrug. ‘It was just some personal research,’ he says. ‘Nothing official.’
. Someone at the Bureau claimed that Draco didn’t have the appropriate paperwork for his rarer ingredients, which was laughable, of course, considering how many weeks Michelle and Draco had spent filling in forms and owling at least five different departments before they finally got the approvals in. Michelle descended upon the accuser with more righteous fury than all the archangels in heaven.
Harry brings up his hand to press against his bare neck. Even without the aid of a mirror, he knows that the tattoo is gone. Relief shudders through him.
Harry realises he’s never actually witnessed Blaise angry before. Frustrated, yes. Perhaps even worried. But never angry - and certainly never angry on Harry’s behalf. It feels reminiscent of being at the brunt end of Pansy’s aggressive affection, and his head spins from the whiplash of realising that Blaise Zabini might actually be his
‘Oh, stop,’ Michelle laughs. She purses her lips as she sweeps her gaze over him. ‘Ah, so handsome.’
Harry Apparates to Cornwall in time to prevent the Aurors from heading to Draco’s house to tear that apart as well. They have no warrant, no paperwork, nothing to authorize them - nothing but a single anonymous letter with garbled, nonsensical accusations.
‘Your family is insane,’ Draco says, grinning at Harry. He tilts the bowl of roast potatoes towards Harry’s overladen plate. ‘Do you want some of these, by the way?’
- by Harry’s godson, who promptly snatches the toy dragon out of his hands and starts very loudly voicing his complaints about the anatomical inaccuracy of the dragon. Apparently, there are
The Greengrasses, it seems, hearken to a tradition older than even the stilted customs of the self-proclaimed pure-bloods. The wreaths that hang at each entryway sing with a magic that is wild and delightful and
‘He’s actually much better than he used to be,’ Harry tells Andromeda. He picks up Malfoy’s cup carefully and taps his wand against the porcelain rim. He waits until the spell takes, feeling the minute vibrations spread throughout the small cup, before handing it back to Malfoy.
‘Yes, exactly,’ Blaise says. ‘For the past few years, we haven’t really been concerned with their efforts, since they’ve been pretty consistent at blowing up each attempt. But then last month a modified Time-Turner went missing from the Department of Mysteries. It isn’t functional, of course - hasn’t been since the attack of ‘96 when you and your friends wrecked the Time Room.’
The pleasant lines of Stephen's face begin to harden as his eyes glide over the documents. He mutters something under his breath, and though Draco has little-to-no understanding of Cantonese, he knows the intonation of a swear word when he hears one.
The next few chapters are going to take a lot of choreographing, and it’s going to get a lot more graphic/gruesome, so I might have to change my ratings/tags. Bear with me, I promise there is sweet sweet sweet fluff on the horizon. Also, in this house, we use Chekhov’s guns - still more juicy juicy plot to come.
‘It means I need to speak with my family,’ Stephen says grimly. He shakes his head as he pulls out his mobile phone and begins to type into it. ‘I think we’re going to have to delay the honeymoon indefinitely until we sort out this mess.’
‘Right,’ says Harry brusquely. ‘That’s enough.’ He pulls his wand from its holster and slams a privacy spell down between them so quickly it nearly takes the girl’s nose off.
She interviews one of the Belgian forensic wizards responsible for doing a post-incident sweep of Narcissa’s flat. His report was never submitted to the Wizengamot, so Hermione takes great care in making him inform everyone of his findings.
‘Nice to see you again, Harry,’ Daphne says, smiling with only the corner of her mouth. She extends her hand.
That, at least, Harry knows to be true. There were a number of nameless lovers who drifted in and out of Draco’s life - nobody permanent, of course, and plenty of them were Muggles who came upon him in the bar he worked or at the coffee shops he frequented. Harry never quite understood back then why Draco never found someone permanent.
‘I’m so sorry,’ Harry whispers. The bones in Malfoy’s wrist feel as delicate as a bird’s wing in his grasp.
None of them are particularly young anymore, but in this moment, they almost feel like teenagers again, sitting together as the music slips into something a little sweeter, a little slower - and it makes them nostalgic for a past that none of them share, but one that could have been.
‘The key difference, Mr. Malfoy,’ says Smythe, archly, ‘is that those Aurors used wand magic - proper wizarding magic. Mr. Potter used
‘He placed the knife here,’ she says, setting the tip of her nail against the soft, vulnerable place at her throat. ‘I was not afraid to die. But my son would not listen.’
Ron is a veteran at taking his children to fair rides, so he knows that too much motion on a full stomach leads to a very quickly emptied stomach, and apparently hasn’t packed enough wet wipes to deal with it, so they are all banned from the roller coasters for at least half an hour. Teddy and Victoire, who played Chaser against each other all through school, have an epic showdown shooting basketballs into wobbling hoops while an awestruck crowd watches on.
- and Molly makes Draco swear on his life that they will not have a winter wedding, or she’ll never knit him a Christmas sweater again. Fleur pours out champagne for everyone and they have a civilised little toast about it, and Hugo quietly informs everyone that he’d like to be the ring boy, please, if everyone’s alright with that, and Draco looks like he might cry a little.
‘You need a way to pick the lock,’ George says. He slaps the manual against his palm. ‘We already know all the spells that won’t work on the Panic Room. We just have to find the right combination of spells that
Luna sighs and takes his hand in hers. ‘You know that’s not true,’ she says gently. ‘Just write him something,’ she tells him. ‘One of your lovely letters, perhaps. I think he’d like it very much.’
Malfoy’s letter finally arrives on the day that Harry qualifies as an Auror. It comes with a box of chocolates, wrapped up with red and gold ribbons and with a card that reads:
Harry narrows his eyes at Draco. ‘I thought we agreed never to mention the Shacklebolt incident ever again,’ he says. Two months ago, he made the front pages by stomping on Kingsley’s wife’s toes during an extremely poor attempt at the foxtrot, halfway through a benefit for war orphans. Thankfully, both Shacklebolts forgave him for his two left feet.
‘Teddy!’ Draco gasps, throwing his hands over his chest as though he isn’t clothed in perfectly acceptable pyjamas.
Harry sees Hermione’s eye twitch, and realises that she’s about to launch into full Advocate mode against Blaise.
Harry holds up a finger against his lips and shakes his head, miming silence. He pulls his wand out of its holster and waves it at Pansy’s extractor fan. There is a mild chime, and then the awful tension that’s been bothering Harry since he got here unravels.
‘I knew the Panic Room was in Narcissa’s apartment somewhere,’ Harry explains, ‘so when I felt your magical signature, I knew it had to be there - and that you were locked in there.’
‘Why haven’t you looked like this before?’ Harry demands. ‘You’re always… I don’t know.’ He gestures lamely, failing to find the words for Malfoy’s general snooty, annoying presence.
Kingsley climbs quickly to his feet, his expression is openly horrified as he takes in the restraints bracketing Harry’s arms. The man who was ranting angrily at the Minister of Magic turns on his heel, his features finally swimming into focus.
They roll Draco away, casting diagnostic spells as they go, and Draco is so pale and limp and quiet between them that Harry wants to scream.
Teddy cries so hard he nearly drops the rings, but Hugo lunges for them in time and gets mud all over his trousers. Rose spells Hugo’s suit clean and then kindly hands Teddy a tissue to wipe his face with -
‘Thanks Gin,’ Harry says, smiling at her. ‘I will.’ He lifts the phone up and tilts the glowing screen in her direction.
The firelight is amber as it lines the planes of his face, dipping in beneath his cheeks and brushing at the lines that bracket his lips. Draco always holds himself in layers of sarcasm and biting wit, but Harry watches him as the mask comes completely off and Harry feels that same shifting of the earth beneath his feet, and gravity readjusts to the earth as it turns off its centre. And then Draco is looking at Harry like he deserves this, deserves to be looked at like he matters, and it makes Harry’s mouth go bitter and his stomach twist savagely.
Draco presses his palms against Harry’s cheeks and presses his forehead against Harry’s and Harry feels a very different sort of ache grow within his chest, mingling with his grief. Draco is kind and clever and beautiful and perfect. The world tilts beneath him and he falls forwards into the vastness of his emotion, and it frightens him, but he can’t help it, because this is how they are, him and Draco, Draco and him, and he’s been headed here since he read Draco’s heartlines transcribed in that lovely letter.
Draco, which is why he’s here, trying not to throw himself into the gutter in an attempt to roll away from all this awkwardness.
‘Well, it’s been a long time since I last visited properly,’ Harry says, bending his head in apology.
‘Alright, what’s this then?’ he asks, nodding his head towards the open bottle of champagne. ‘What’ve I missed?’
(Chapter 7 will be a little on the long side, so bear with me while I work through the chewy ooey gooey stuff. As always, I work un-beta'd and it is a hot flaming mess - like me!)
Proudfoot’s eyes dart between the contents of the volume, Draco’s hard expression, and Kingsley’s exhausted slump in his chair. His grip on the ledger tightens, the leather binding of the book squeaking in protest. Blaise paces back and forth behind Draco, a restless tiger in the corner of a cage.
Draco’s eyes search Harry’s face. ‘I recall you telling me that my magic was soothing to you,’ Draco says slowly. ‘I presume my magic is compatible with yours. Is that why it was the best choice?’
Apparently Malfoy wrote Arthur a letter too, containing a clipping of a Muggle newspaper advertising a motor show.
Prentis snorts. ‘I don’t. Marie gets to buy me nice mugs now because she knows you won’t blow them up. Speaking of significant others,’ she adds, closing the file and setting it aside, ‘are you off to see that nice boy of yours this weekend? You didn’t bring your weekend bag today.’
One of the girls whispers something into her friend’s ear, laughs, and then winks at Draco as she hands him her copy of
Malfoy laughs, or at least, tries to. The sound is a hollow, jarring thing. ‘Circe, Potter,’ he says, his eyes too wide, too dark. ‘Didn’t you know? It’s all part and parcel of serving our Dark Lord. Torture and death. Death and torture. ’ He leans his head back, falling into the shadows beneath the sink, and he stares at Harry with those too-wide eyes. ‘I think I’ve had enough of the torture bit.’
The apartment needs to remain under Stasis, so Harry checks into a nearby hotel. He barely tastes the complimentary breakfast in the morning, throwing the tasteless coffee back as he frowns at his haphazard notes.
The rain grows torrential, so they abandon dinner plans, opting instead for takeout at Draco’s tiny, rundown flat. Potter’s sweater is absolutely soaked through from their mad dash in the rain, so he peels it off with great effort and drapes it over Draco’s radiator to dry. There is a flash of skin and lean muscle.
Draco is out of his seat before Harry can even move to help him, hurrying across the space and gathering up his best friend into a tight hug. ‘Hush, darling,’ he murmurs. ‘It’s alright. I’m here, see? I’m fine. Everything’s fine now.’
him, and it doesn’t make any sense, doesn’t she know what he’s done?). ‘And that’s not right, Draco. You have to prove that you

Proudfoot grabs Harry by the elbow. By now, every last soul in the DMLE knows that Harry can wandlessly Apparate, but they both play along as Proudfoot twists on his heel and pulls Harry into a jarring Side-Along.
He hears a slight shuffling, a soft murmur, and then a series of sharp clicks sound out as the locks on the door spell open. The door pulls open to reveal Narcissa, looking a little paler than usual but every bit as beautiful as when Harry first saw her. She seems to freeze in the doorway as she stares at Harry.
confirm that a Lopez Panic Room was indeed purchased by one Draco Malfoy to be installed in the apartment of one Narcissa Malfoy.’
(Some nights, even here, where the sweetest memories are drained from every last prisoner, Harry still dreams of a ballroom full of flowers. In those dreams, he dances in the circle of Draco’s arms, spinning and spinning and spinning until the world turns into a ring box filled with tiny chocolates. When he wakes after those dreams, Harry stands by his cell window and yearns for a warm smile and glittering, silver eyes.)
He doesn’t ask for it, though. Not even in the honey-sweet moments when they sit together by the river and watch fireworks explode in the sky, when Draco’s thumb strokes patterns into the nape of Harry’s neck. Not afterwards, when they drink champagne in Draco’s bed and grow giggly off the bubbles - not even when Draco presses his hand against Harry’s cheek and
He pushes Harry back with enough force to separate their bodies. The haze of desire lifts off Harry slightly, but not enough to stop him from locking his hands around Draco’s wrists.
‘I do,’ Harry says sorrowfully. ‘But I’ve already got honey parsnips and carrots. I can’t finish both.’
Draco turns his cheek so that it rests against Harry’s arm. His eyes are aglow with their own light, slivers of captured moonlight to appease the sky for the waxing of the moon. ‘I’m just surprised by the fact that, out of the two of us,’ Draco says, gesturing between their bodies with his hand, ‘
The bathroom door opens and Draco appears, hair damp from the shower, his cheeks flushed blossom-pink from the hot water. His eyes settle on Harry and suddenly he is more radiant than the sun, his lips curving upwards into a smile as he walks towards Harry’s side of the bed.
‘When I first saw Harry,’ he says, clutching at his jug-sized serving of beer, ‘he was only a tiny little thing. I knew then that he needed a lot of love to grow big and strong, so I did my very best to love him as much as I could. And though Harry’s still just a wee thing -’
Harry raises his eyebrows inquisitively at Draco and the other man tilts the bag so that Harry can see the carefully wrapped candle hiding inside. Draco loves his scented candles - a remnant from the days he used to live in that little flat in Muggle London before he passed his parole.
Malfoy stares at him with an expression of faint bemusement. ‘I can’t drink,’ he says. ‘Alcohol interferes with my potions.’
Some days he trips up, and the happiness dissolves like a lump of salt in a vast lake. He grasps for it but comes away with nothing but empty hands and a savage burning in his lungs.
‘Oh, I heard,’ Daphne says, pulling a lilac envelope from her pocket. She waves it at Harry accusingly. ‘Work. The very same work that was responsible for placing you in Diagon Alley on-’
Something in Kingsley’s face softens, and in his eyes Harry sees a heart-breaking combination of sadness, betrayal, and anxiety. It is the look of a man who has just been shown the rotten core of all that he once believed in. He finds that he has no anger for Kingsley - not even disappointment. He finds, in that bruise-tender place within his heart, nothing but gentle sympathy and pity.
‘Oh,’ says Neville, blinking. A frown flits briefly over his face, and then he rubs the back of his neck. ‘Right. Sorry. Let me know if you change your mind, though,’ he adds, managing another friendly smile before he leaves.
Harry’s brow furrows slightly as he processes the information, stowing it away in the web he’s been crafting in his head. Another piece to add to the complex tapestry - another step closer to finding Draco.
Harry is in the hospital cafeteria with Daphne and Luna, sipping at a cup of appalling hospital-quality coffee when Daphne’s token chimes. She looks up at Harry and nods a silent confirmation.
Narcissa answers the door after a brief delay. She’s got a pashmina shawl draped over her, but Harry can glimpse the purpling bruises on her shoulders beneath the sweep of cloth. He thinks back to similar bruises glimpsed years and years ago, scattered across a teenage boy’s skin, and feels his stomach turn.
Harry whips his head around, staring at the Unspeakable. The man stands by the door with his hands tucked into his pockets, watching Harry with an unreadable expression.
Blaise pulls out a notebook and something that looks like an old-fashioned Muggle pen (with a screw cap and metal nib) but is charmed to never run out of ink. He crosses his legs, flips open his notebook, and leans forwards slightly, marking the beginning of the interview.
‘That’s because I’m not a hormonal teenager with an anger management problem,’ Draco replies with all of his usual snark and none of his bite. ‘And I’ve learned quite a deal of patience over the years, putting up with you.’
He sighs, sets down the letter, gets to his feet, and walks over to Pansy. He pulls her into a tight hug. She’s smaller than she looks, more delicate too, so she hides it with her flashy clothes and her ridiculous heels. She’s always been the sort of person to cover up her fear and love and worry with a mask of frivolity and petty cruelty.
‘Are you familiar with panic rooms, Professor?’ Guy asks, plucking the paper from his brother’s fingers. He folds it neatly and places it on the desk. ‘They’re a Muggle concept, but every old wizarding house has something similar built into its core. A panic room is a fortified room to hide within, in case of an attack or storm. They’re usually designed to be impenetrable - steel walls, fingerprint scanners, all that stuff.’
Harry feels his eyes prickle with tears he can’t afford to shed. He pulls Draco’s hand into his lap and covers it with his other hand. ‘Hold on to me,’ he says, ‘and I’ll hold on to you.’
‘I dun like hairy caterpillars,’ he mutters, sounding cotton-fuzzy from sleep. ‘S’not nice. Not in my socks. They were in my
‘Bloody hell, mate,’ Ron whistles, long and low. ‘You should’ve seen it. Snape’s got nothing on Blaise when he’s proper ticked off. Blaise starts listing off every single case of improper conduct Proudfoot has been involved with, every grey-ish spell he’s cast, every single dodgy associate, every time he’s looked the other way when someone powerful’s done something illegal. I might’ve felt a bit sorry for the poor bastard, if he wasn’t genuinely an incompetent sod.’
Draco looks up at Harry. An ugly, purple-green bruise spreads over the rise of his cheekbone, and there is a cut at the top of his hairline, but he is there, in flesh and bone. Not dead.
- something strange and old and woven between the two of them from the moment they met in Madam Malkin’s, a prince and a poor orphan. Or perhaps their love was already seeded when they were but carefree children, chasing each other on broomsticks in an early Autumn sky.
The boy behind the bar knows Draco, so he gives them all doubles for the price of singles - except for Draco, who’s still on potions, and gets a Diet Coke instead. The bartender is cute, in a button-nosed, doe-eyed kind of way. Harry’s sort of come to the realisation that maybe he finds boys cute too, after a few confused moments in the trainee locker rooms and maybe three bizarre dreams about Oliver Wood, but when Draco’s friend passes Harry his number on a coaster with a wink, Harry has to politely tell him that he’s very much not single, but is flattered anyways.
She covers Harry’s hands with her own, squeezing over his scarred knuckles, over the harsh, white letters carved into his skin. There are scars on his wrists too, and more tracking up his arms beneath the sleeves of his shirt. There’s a reason Harry left the Aurors behind - ten years’ worth of reasons. She and Ron saw the worst parts of it, the drunken nights and the string of nameless lovers, the horrific injuries that only got worse after Ron left the Aurors and there was nobody left to watch his back.
Draco shakes his head slowly. ‘Even if you’re good at locating magical signatures,’ he says, ‘mine would have been so faint it would have been barely recognizable.’
Draco arches a single eyebrow, clearly unimpressed with Proudfoot’s display. He gestures wordlessly with his wand at a heavy volume on the desk, sending it flying over to the Auror with a flick of his wrist. Proudfoot catches the book at the very last minute with an audible
It doesn’t make sense, though. He quit. He stopped doing stupid, reckless things, stopped overworking, and putting himself in dangerous situations. He’s got his Anchors and he’s got Daphne and he doesn’t blow anything up anymore.
(He hails from one of the oldest magical families in Barcelona, but - like Draco - he has long since drifted from his point of origin. He gave his enormous inheritance away to war orphanages and charities and married a Venezuelan wizard who occasionally likes to perform in drag at the local gay bar. He also has two sons, both adopted from Muggle orphanages that did not know what to do with their random bursts of accidental magic, and has named each of them after prominent scientists. Draco likes to attend their music recitals from time to time.)
He loves this house. It isn’t quite Grimmauld Place (which he’s now handed over to Teddy, who really should have been the rightful heir to the Black fortune all along) and it isn’t quite Godric’s Hollow either, but it’s
But he also knows that the well of Draco’s love runs deep when it comes to Pansy, and that there is nothing that Draco would not endure for the sake of his best friend, so he holds his tongue.
Draco likes being happy. He works very hard at it. He places the deep well of darkness aside, refuses to live in the bog of his awful past, and instead twists his misery into humour like a jovial flick of the wand at a Boggart. He surrounds himself with lovely things, purges his life of anything that might link back to the Manor, to
They climb the stairs through the empty, quiet house. Draco leads the way, because he’s seen Harry’s room before. He’s dragged Harry’s inebriated ass into bed too many times to count, after one too many drinks on a night out. He knows the way even in the dark, his steps sure as he finds his way up each creaking stairwell, and the way he moves with such familiarity through Harry’s home makes Harry’s heart
the same as that quiet, subdued hum that he heard in Narcissa’s wall. It’s been driving him insane. He’s slept a total of three hours, napping sporadically whenever his headache gets blinding.
‘The potions I’m on help a lot, but it’ll be three years left before I’m back to normal,’ Malfoy says, taking the cup from Harry. His wrist twists, and the cup tilts in the opposite direction. His eyebrows climb his forehead as he stares down at the undisturbed tea. ‘I say, Potter, that’s an impressive stabilizing charm. Weren’t you terrible at Charms?’
