“Then it is hopeless?” Harry could hear the disappointment in his own voice.
Harry sat with them both for a while, stroking Fang and trying to avoid any errant drool.
“Very generous of you.”
“Fuck,” Harry breathed, somewhat overwhelmed by the offer.
Malfoy was silent for so long Harry didn't think he was going to answer. He knew he could’ve, understandably, offended the man by bringing up the War, though even if they were both completely sober Harry likely wouldn’t’ve been overly concerned about causing offence. To his surprise, Malfoy seemed to have genuinely considered the question.
Draco’s hand drifted from Harry’s hand to his wrist—but then he flattened his palm to Harry’s cheek, and they were kissing, and Harry went all lightheaded.
“Just till I get in,” Harry promised a bit roughly.
“I was practising all day, and I wanted to show you how it was going.”
“Fine. Whatever,” he drawled. “Not as if you didn’t return the favor this morning with a proper fucking.”
There was a moment of silence between them wherein Draco caught on to what he meant, and then seemed to be peering at Harry with some new level of respect—and also a touch of amusement.
Harry also recalled exactly how key Malfoy, and his wand, had been to achieving a real defeat.
“You aren’t trying to get me drunk, are you?”
“I could pop by next week, if that would give you enough time? In the meantime, I’ll try to come up with a way for you to contact me—I have a Muggle address but the post seems a bit—”
With tired interest, Harry watched him arching out of his pants and, despite his concerns, was immediately hurrying to get out of his own.
Should he really be considering meeting him again? In light of his dreams, and his guilt over what had happened, Harry wasn’t sure. For several weeks now a small bit of his mind had been trying to warn him that perhaps he should take over the project on his own—and not let Malfoy get any more involved than he already was—but he wasn’t fully sure about that either.
Harry snorted. “Very far from it… Alright, then. What about the secrecy?”
The first hour or so, they spent their time going over the theory behind Draco’s new spellwork, and there was a peculiar awkwardness between them that Harry didn’t understand—but the nervous tension was turning his stomach inside out.
Alone in his sitting room, Harry cleared his throat as his cheeks warmed, but Draco was still writing.
Harry apologised at length for being late, and explained about the Dementors as well, but Cassie waved off his apologies, so they got right to business.
“Er.”
“You look as if you’re being tortured, Harry. Relax and try to have fun, won’t you? It’s meant to be a celebration.” His fiery-haired fiancé gave him a strong shove to the back, propelling him in the direction of the bar.
“And not Zabini?”
“Bad?” Draco queried lightly, sliding up his own trousers again.
Why was Malfoy going off into the forest, today of all days? He looked relatively normal but maybe something was wrong with him. Harry doubted very much now that Malfoy was actually up to anything nefarious but it also wasn’t completely outside the realm of possibility—
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I’ll do some additional reading as well when I can spare the time—” Malfoy went on.
“Oh, well that’s one thing I can definitely help with—it’s what I do here, among a lot of other things of course—oh! Socks! We
Draco finished helping to tug Harry’s shirt over his head, and the long slim length of his cock brushed up against Harry’s front as Draco stepped out of his trousers entirely. They undressed with surprisingly little hurry. It all came off so naturally that Harry didn’t even have the chance to feel very awkward about standing completely naked in the middle of a library.
“There wasn’t the time to make any. Honestly, I hadn’t expected you’d want to do this so soon, or I might’ve been more prepared.”
“…then I might need you to order for me.”
With a frustrated groan, Draco slowed the undulation of his hips.
“I’ll make a deal with you, Potter. I will deign to give your futile little pet project some of my very valuable time and attention, and in return…”
Harry glanced down to where a patch of magical warmth tingled on his now-spotless shirt. “…Sorry.”
“—let me fuck you?” Harry breathed roughly.
“I might’ve always been, you know.” Harry smiled at them both in wry amusement.
He nearly choked again.
It was too hot, but Harry refused to lose the press of smooth skin on his, palming at the small of his back to pull him insatiably closer—and though he’d argued he couldn’t, was soon thrusting up harder to meet the uninhibited force of Draco’s hips.
“Harry, I’m so sorry—it’s my twin sister, you see.”
Ron wandered their way then, tossing another arm about Harry’s shoulders. Thankfully he kept most of his weight to himself this time.
They could’ve each stayed in their own if they’d wanted, but Draco hadn’t suggested splitting up, so he didn’t either. As this one was Harry’s creation, there were a lot more warm colours to it—browns, reds and ambers—than Draco’s, which were usually shades of grey, black and white, with only the occasional pops of bright colour.
Groaning, Harry hurried to align his cock with the perfect pucker of Draco’s arse.
to light their way instead.
He waved him off to do up the belt himself, and Harry settled for joining him a step or two up for a kiss. Draco pressed into it for the space of a second, but he pulled back straightaway, taking a few quick steps up to the tapestry-lined corridor at the top of the stairwell.
“Well enough.”
Draco hummed blankly, not really pulling his gaze from the fire.
“I thought this might be useful—and give our owls a bit of a break. What do you think?”
Draco’s hand stilled on his mid-swish.
“Go home, before I make you stay.”
Harry nodded, quirking an easy smile. He couldn’t recall ever properly smiling at Malfoy before, but stranger things had certainly happened to him.
Harry’s cheeks burned where his shame painted them.
“…Probably not.” Harry might’ve been grinning, if he hadn’t quickly pressed his lips flat together to reign it in.
“It’s not, until we get on increasing the number of locations—then it could become quite a lot to keep up with. Unless—there may be a way to connect them all to the same enchantments…”
As the conversation petered off, Harry became sure they would now part ways. He even considered grabbing a glass for Ginny, if only to make up for his behavior at the wedding a few months ago—but Malfoy proceeded to distract him with a question.
Harry really couldn’t let that stand. “Misery? You're the richest, possibly luckiest prick I know. What d’you have to be miserable about?”
“If you—? Malfoy you don’t
Draco moaned very loudly for him, a pointed nose pressing to his cheek, and Harry ignored an intense breathlessness to kiss him, lightheaded as Draco drew out his slow riding.
Beyond the already uncomfortable secrets he was living with Harry knew he needed to talk to her, and about Draco—or at least, what he had been working on with Draco. She’d expressed her concerns to Hermione and Ron, but Harry was a little irritated that she hadn’t just asked him directly—even if he was just as guilty of avoiding conversations with her these days.
“You’ve been using more neutrals…I think you might’ve actually learned something.”
“Let go, Harry,” Draco urged, lips dragging against the shell of his ear. “Let me make you come.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Laughing abruptly, Harry willed himself not to think about exactly how talented Draco’s smug prat mouth actually was. Perhaps he had been spending a little too much time with the former Slytherin lately, and his moral deficiencies were starting to rub off.
“Merciful fuck,” Draco panted.
“What way?”
Things had felt a bit dire after the Memorial, and still his dreams seemed intent on torturing him.
A hazy nervousness ran through him—but it appeared Draco was too tired for nerves. He whispered a spell that unbuttoned Harry’s shirt and pushed it from his shoulders, tracing his fingertips slowly down over the slight muscle of his abs with obvious interest.
“You’ve been rubbing on my cock for twenty minutes, do you really need to ask?”
“We went to Hagrid’s looking for you after the afternoon speeches, but he was asleep. We found your note—”
Swallowing, Harry muffled a quietly pleased noise and Draco moaned again.
That was rather concerning.
“What idea?”
“As I will ever be.”
“Well, I know what a light is,” Draco drawled wryly, clearly lost.
“You are not,” Draco scoffed at him.
They took a break for tea and food before they got into the casting, but it was getting later in the evening and Draco was anxious to get started, so they made it as quick as they could.
He found it impossible to ignore now that his Patronus was a little less bright and a little more ethereal with each casting. His memories had not changed, and Harry felt as though he himself had not fundamentally changed, so he could not pin down what might be causing the disruption. He only knew if it continued he would need to look into it, and preferably before it began hindering his ability to do his job.
“I said I might have a glass of wine; would you like one?”
friends.”
Draco pursed his lips thoughtfully. “Ideally not. That is—if I can sort out a way to insert them all at once, then it might not take too long at all, but I’ll need to head back to the library to do some reading.”
“There’s er. The interview rooms, I suppose?”
After a short debate, he agreed to trust Draco to side-along Apparate them closer to wherever he was taking them for lunch. They found a low narrow tunnel in which to avoid being seen disappearing, and beneath its graffitied arch the sound of the rain was much louder.
He shook his head, trying to steady out his breathing. “You?”
They were stopped in the entryway. Draco had to nudge him from behind, and still it took another moment to move his feet, but he tried shaking off the weight of memory to cross the room to the corridor of back offices.
“Take your time, do it properly.”
“I’m going to dribble if I don’t slouch a little bit.”
He left the ‘don’t touch anything’ unsaid, but Harry didn’t have a death wish so he kept his hands to himself.
It occurred to him then that if Ron had dropped by at the same time just two days prior, he would’ve got quite the eyeful. They really should’ve been more careful—he was mostly ignoring the bit where he was bizarrely enthralled at the idea.
Then came the issue of how he could possibly continue working with Draco and
"Honestly, don’t you ever think about the fact that even the poorest wizard has access to just about everything they need to live?” Harry paused to sip through the bubbles in his glass before he continued. “Doesn’t it seem wrong to you that we have the magic and the power to help Muggles the same and we just… don’t.”
He groaned a warning, which only caused Draco’s cock to twitch harder into his next thrust. Harry had to grip at rather forceful hips to get him to ease off, just a for a second—then he willingly forced him just as deep, moaning.
As she picked up one of the larger volumes from an off-kilter pile of them, Harry’s stomach did an uneasy flip. Probably there was no real reason for him to hide what he was researching from her, but his nerves seemed to think otherwise.
He wasn’t sure he could ever fully forgive him for all that he had done, but Harry thought now that he might understand him better.
“Potter,” he gasped, and groaned again when Harry slowed his strokes. “
“Draco…”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry’s noises turned relieved when Draco let up enough to let him get at the other man’s trousers in turn. A whispered charm undid the buttons, so that all Harry really needed to do was push them down past Draco’s hips.
He went to open the door, but of course it was still locked, and he shot an impatient look over his shoulder.
“Take my time, but hurry, but not too much because my cock is too big.”
Sliding his fingers through silky platinum as his cock sunk deeper in slippery heat, he needed Draco not to stop. Maybe he could get away with thrusting into the ecstasy for a few more minutes, into the self-satisfied lilt of all Draco’s inciting moans. They were surely being too loud, but Harry hadn’t noticed anyone else around, and he was getting so close, so quickly—
He turned around, catching him by the back of the neck for a hard kiss.
“Keep going,” Draco demanded lustfully.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Should I keep going?”
There was a quiet moment as Draco absorbed this and Harry searched for his jeans—surely, his pants must be with them.
“Your bed is incredible, Malfoy.”
“Yes, alright,” Draco dismissed quickly, not quite meeting his eye. “Tea first. Then we can get into the gory details.”
“Yes, and we shouldn’t be here.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Harry muttered under his breath, muffled by the hand he rubbed tiredly over his face.
Draco bucked back on his finger as he came hard all over Harry’s sheets. Rather than pull out, Harry whispered a light lubrication charm and slid his index finger in to press with the middle into the same perfect place.
“Sounds reasonable.”
Quite unconsciously he licked at his lips as he worked open Draco’s trousers, and when he chanced to look up the shift in energy between them sparked considerably.
And Harry would inevitably need to see him again. He knew at some point in the not-so-distant future they would be planning a time to touch base on their progress. He would have to be in Draco’s vicinity, and somehow not think about all the incredibly naughty things he wanted to do with him.
Harry huffed a laugh, but on consideration, couldn’t really argue with Draco’s priorities.
Harry worked up to the base of his cock, tonguing at the honey collected there before he was murmuring over sensitive skin. “What do you want?”
“I don’t have much of an appetite today,” Harry admitted.
So he let him go, and Malfoy disappeared through the gates and out into the crowd.
“Isn’t it all pointless if we can’t work that out?”
Harry cleared his throat a little awkwardly. “Er, yeah…thanks. Trying something new.”
“What the fuck, Potter?” Draco panted when he’d found sense again.
“Can’t you just let it go?”
Harry only wanted to snog him more for it. “Fuck—alright. I know.”
Draco sent a look over his shoulder that threatened to pull him in all over again.
Draco chuckled as he set about playing at the head of Harry’s cock with his tongue. Harry got noisy again, but that only seemed to encourage Draco to tease more, until Harry was a flustered mess beneath him.
Harry moaned again, louder, as Draco had started biting down his chest, paying particular attention and sharpness to his nipple, catching it between his teeth and biting until Harry properly whined for him. Caught between Draco’s mouth and the ladder, Harry squirmed, his cock already aching for release, and throbbing at him each time Draco’s teeth pinched at his skin.
Whilst he was occupied with that, Draco went back to do a proper clearing of the bedroom, gathering up Harry’s things and his own—dirty laundry and all.
He braced a steadying hand on Draco’s hip, rocking his own to gently slide his cock in deeper, losing himself now in tight heat. If Draco took issue with Harry’s gentleness he didn’t complain, and when he turned his head, panting across Harry’s throat, Harry chased his lips to kiss him hard, his cock twitching eagerly inside. Draco met each of his drawn-out thrusts with low, enticing moans.
“You can’t be serious. Nobody goes into the Department of Mysteries at night, Malfoy.”
Listening to those same steps pace restlessly nearby, Harry waved his wand in careful motion for the last interlinked lines of Latin.
“A few of my former housemates are having a gathering. I’m shocked I’ve been invited.”
For his cheek, Harry purposefully drew the point of his teeth as he pulled up. Draco hissed tightly, but he was already sliding back in, his cock twitching tellingly stiff.
It would not have been possible for Harry to properly express how surreal it was to have Draco Malfoy sitting in his dusty little kitchen. Rather than try, he focused instead on charming the teapot to fill with boiling water as he collected some cups from the cupboards by hand.
Beyond the match of their smirks, when their eyes met Harry saw a flash of fear in Draco’s. It wasn’t there long and Draco broke eye contact immediately, but Harry’s smirk faltered and he took a deep breath.
Draco tipped his head back to expose even more of his throat before he shared his thoughts. “The good news is I think I’ve finally got the figures right—enough I can start weaving them all together again.”
If how he felt now was any indication, Harry would need to bring a backup potion or two.
“It is better than what it’s replaced,” he dismissed coldly.
Someone had undone the spells behind the magically generated parlour music, in favor of taking up the violin and launching into a series of more danceable tunes. Before long another guest had joined in with a small concertina and together treated the room to a few reels, and a jig or two.
Harry shrugged. “Worked for me, aside from the waltzing bit.”
Eventually Draco summoned the energy to pull away from him, and lead their way back down to the kitchen. On the way, they were both rather determined to ignore the element of nervous energy edging between them as they walked.
“Good evening, Potter.”
“Harry…oh
Draco groaned deeply, shifting one hand off the basin’s ceramic edge, far more daringly balanced as he reached between them, stroking firmly at his cock and intentionally smearing a few impatient drops over Harry’s abs.
“Yes. Now, if you would.”
“And yet, here you are, doing precisely that.”
“You’re presuming that it ever went away.”
“—then I had to take a broom up and go all over the ceiling charming gum out of the rafters. It was a bloody mess.”
“Only returning the favor,” Draco replied casually. “Have a lovely morning, Potter.”
“Potter? What the fuck are you doing here?”
They Transfigured from four-thirty until nearly seven, and by the time he was finished with his last Harry was quite tired of curtains.
At some point, Draco had summoned tea and sandwiches from the kitchen, and they’d both eaten as Draco went over a number of spells that they could practice individually that might eventually be worked into the whole enchantment. It was also becoming clear that it would likely take Draco several months at least before he was closer to being able to test it all together, and would likely need more time yet to revise the mix after.
,” Harry cursed again breathlessly. “I’m going to come.”
“Harry, you hardly ate breakfast.” Ginny’s concern was showing.
Harry drew a little star under the question and used the pad of his finger to erase her question mark. He left the light on, so as to draw her attention, and set it on his bedside table so he wouldn’t miss any further messages, or forget to pack it.
Sitting up, a puddle of ivory silk settled around his waist and Harry shrugged. “It’s never worked that way, there’s usually got to be a snake about and I don’t know too many snakes. I’ve not had a reason to try since…everything happened. I had no idea.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco’s tone held an edge of tightly veiled anger—but then it wasn’t really Blaise he was angry with.
“I’d no idea you were so traditional, Potter.”
Harry made the rounds with hugs and greetings, before slipping off to find Ron and Hermione—only to find Ron sitting at a corner table with George, going over a long sheet of words and numbers that made Harry’s head hurt to look at.
Two hours later Draco returned from the library with a small armful of note-covered scrolls.
Sometimes, later into the afternoons at the Ministry, he would daydream about Draco walking in as he had earlier that month…but Draco’s birthday was only once a year.
Clumsy from sleep, it took him a moment to find the coordination, but then Harry was trailing his palms down the smooth stretch of Draco’s back and beneath a thin layer of sheets to the perfectly bare curves of his arsecheeks. He palmed them a bit excessively before he forced Draco firmly down, pulling them ever-tighter together. Draco’s rhythm sped under his hands, a rising urgency, and in their quick escalation they filled the room with heavy gasps of exertion, an abundance of groaning, and the soft sound of shifting sheets.
He was a bit caught off-guard by exactly how prepared Malfoy turned out to be for their meeting.
“Harry
As the night progressed, as with any good wedding reception, the revelries intensified, plied by many a drink and the increasingly raucous nature of the music.
Harry hadn’t considered the possibility of going the night before, however—
Draco hissed a quick breath, and moaned just after. “Don’t stop. More.”
As Malfoy had so succinctly put it, he needed more information—information he couldn’t find in any of the books on the shelves at Malfoy Manor, nor any other magic library.
Malfoy pulled the music box off the table, and Harry shook out the bag, situating it so its open top faced him.
“I’m only kidding. Whatever you’ve got is completely fine.”
“That’s good news. Is there anything I can do to help move things along?”
"I don't spend much time thinking about the poor at all, much less the
to have a foot in both worlds. Almost too lucky.”
Fighting off his fluster, Harry checked the time on the café’s wall clock and started.
And then he left.
Harry’s world faded dark with rising ecstasy when Draco used his hold on the rail to bounce himself a bit on Harry’s cock.
“Sit down, Potter,” he drawled a bit hoarsely. “Before you fall down.”
Savage cut him off with a look that seemed to indicate he ought to reign in his Thestrals a fair bit, and Harry took a deep breath. He forgot, sometimes, that he was not meant to be taking control of his own training sessions. It was only a bit force of habit for him to want to get to the bottom of a problem.
“Yes, sir,” he teased.
Harry wandlessly summoned the other cup and tried to ignore the warmth collecting in his own cheeks.
“Oh gods
Harry was still trying to process what was happening in that moment. “But I don’t—I didn’t—”
“I know,” he admitted into the night, quieter and more earnestly.
“Thanks, Malfoy.”
“Don’t mention it,” Harry teased against the flushed wet skin he was marking.
“Let’s.”
Harry frowned. “I don’t understand. Isn’t that what we’ve been working toward?”
“Hermione mentioned last month you were owling about the Protean Charm—what’s all that for then?”
“I’ll help however I can, of course…” Cassie still looked hesitant, and Harry imagined that might have something to do with his being especially cryptic.
“I’ll let you come on my arse,” Harry offered in quiet English, ignoring a spike of uncertainty in his enthusiasm. “Promise you won’t go too far, and I’ll let you come right on my arsehole.”
“What’s the matter? You don’t like when I turn the tables?”
“Ah, yes. I’ll just waltz right into the Department of Mysteries, where I don’t work, and proceed to go wherever I please.”
He nodded absently, though his focus was far more on his notes and questions. “If I’m following you at all… a lack of permanent housing and a lot of stipulations to accessing it in the first place is what’s leaving so many people on the streets? I’ve noticed a number of small, er—encampments, I suppose—around the city lately.”
Harry did his best.
“You might’ve.”
“Hn,” he protested, nuzzling at the nape of Draco’s neck sleepily.
Draco drew in a shuddering breath. “
They’d tried it in the water first—but Harry hadn’t been able to thrust hard enough to satisfy either of them, so they’d let it all drain out.
‘Potter’s a
‘Please, don’t,’ came Bellatrix's voice.
‘That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.’
‘No. Stop. I’m not asking
‘No,’ Harry rushed out. ‘You haven’t been.’
how should I know? My bet’s at the Quidditch Pitch. I mean, for some wild reason he got chosen to be our Captain, remember? Come on, Crabbe, Goyle.’
Draco knew his parents and their friends were big fans of the Dark Lord, so it made sense that their secret club choose his symbol for their tattoo.
. Your idea, you know!’
Granger raised her hand. ‘The only people who can see Thestrals are people who have seen death.’
‘We won’t take away her kid, ma'am, but I think it could be very helpful if you came along.’
‘Has anyone actually looked into the emission of Little Rico’s Pizza? Someone should ask Desirée… And by the way, doesn’t Stanley Blake, from Christie’s Coffee on the Corner, take trips to the mainland all the time? I think we can arrange for him to take a few tulip bulbs back…’ He waved a hand. ‘Regardless, the local Parks Department crossed a clear line.’ His fingers curled into a shaking fist. ‘These decisions aren’t yours to make, Heidi. We all pitch in to keep Brookley presentable and we can’t decide – on a whim! – to splurge the whole budget on extravagant flower bulbs for Diana Drive. Personally, I think daisies are just as nice and they grow for free.’ Draco’s eyes lit up for a joke, the way a dragon’s chest lit up before spitting fire. ‘Of course, this only applies if the local youth keeps off the lawn… Brandon!’ Sniggering to himself, Draco whirled his chair to the window with a flourish, and put his feet up on the windowsill. The golden microphone followed every move he made. ‘In other news: suspicious activity has been predicted to occur around noon near the Quidditch field. Our local interpreter of the stars warns us to avoid being seen near there today. At Regency Park, to the right of North Road –’
Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
“It’s fine, I understand. I’ll be upstairs.” Draco said stiffly, not looking at any of them as he hurried out of the room. The stairs creaked eerily as he walked up them, trying to ignore the sound of hushed voices from downstairs. He wandered down the hall, not knowing which room to go into. Finally he stopped at a room marked Regulus Arcturus Black. He frowned, he didn’t know much about Sirius’s brother. He hesitated a brief moment before pushing the door open and stepping inside. The room was covered in dust, and looked as though no one had been in there for years.
Draco did see Harry after. Only it wasn’t how he had expected. Everything had happened so fast Draco wasn’t really sure anything had been real at all. First he and Harry were searching for the snake, which they of course did not find. Second the whole school (besides a few Slytherins) had all rallied together to fight off the dark lord and his followers. Then Harry and Draco had gone into the forest and watched Severus get attacked by a snake. For a few seconds there Draco had been sure he was dead, however he shakily raised a vial to his lips and dragged himself to his feet looking around. Draco had run to him immediately, wanting reassurance that he was going to be okay.
“Shite, sorry.” Draco muttered, brushing himself from off the floor.
“We have to tell Mcgonagall.” Hermione replied. “We’re wasting too much time just standing here doing nothing.”
“Hey.” Harry said, coming in and giving him a quick peck on the cheek.
“Oh, it’s you.” He turned to face Severus, who had just appeared from behind the tall trees in front of the mansion. The man seemed to have a talent for making appearances at dramatic moments.
“Oh, sorry. Should I tell you about the wards now in case…” she trailed off and Draco didn’t catch what she meant until her eyes filled with tears and she closed her eyes.
“Er, right. Can you walk?” Draco was finally able to draw a shuddering breath into his lungs and he stood, not looking at either of them.
“That’s amazing, and you’re happy right?”
Draco swallowed and glanced at Pansy. She looked uncomfortable, kneading her hands in her lap.
He ignored the way his chest ached as she said his name. “Alright then. I’ll send you the signal soon.” He took out his DA coin and nodded at her.
“Where’s Luna?” Draco asked when he entered.
Sincerely,
“I hate her!” Luna said very loudly one day, while they were studying in the library.
“No! No not-”
“Hey…” he said, pulling her into a hug. “It’s going to be okay.” She pulled away after a moment.
“I-I’m sorry. It’s…” His voice shook. “Potter. It’s Potter. It always has been and and-” And what? It always would be? That wasn’t true, right?
“Yeah, yeah I’m ready.” He twisted his hands together and did his best to put on a convincing smile. She nodded and stood, pressing a gentle kiss to the top of his head.
“Luna.” Draco began. “Do you fancy-”
“Is that an invisibility cloak?” he asked, eyes widening in amazement.
“You’re thinking of someone.” Luna said quietly. Everyone stared at her, and then turned their gazes to Draco, waiting for confirmation.
“You don’t know that.” Luna snapped, she used the same tone Draco had often heard when she was furious with him. Hermione blinked and opened her mouth to reply, however Luna was already following Ginny out of the room.
The plan immediately went to complete and utter shit. For one thing, they hadn’t even been planning to pull the whole thing into motion for a couple weeks. However his dear Aunt Bellatrix had sent him a vast amount of concerning messages regarding the impatience of the dark lord, and both Draco and Hermione thought it best to just do it immediately. The dark lord had begun threatening his mother.
“So?” Draco asked breathlessly. Potter placed a hand on the small of his back and drew him even closer. Draco couldn’t breathe. He was going to pass out on top of Potter because of how fast his heart was going. Could one go into cardiac arrest from feeling so much at one time?
“Sounds like Harry. It was his idea wasn’t it?” She wasn’t looking at him, instead she was studying the couple a few booths away. They were holding hands, and after a brief moment of staring intently at each other, they began making out. Draco felt a pang and swallowed, trying to ignore the pain in his chest.
Draco was so bored. He knew writing these letters was a terrible idea. Anyone could come and find them. But it wasn’t like it was a secret that he and Harry were enemies. Even the seven years must know that they despised each other. Because they did, despise each other. What was he even thinking? He had more important things to worry about than Harry bloody Potter. Ugh, Potter was probably doing this on purpose. Drawing all of this attention to himself to try and distract Draco. He needed to focus more on his studies, Granger had started to pull ahead of him.
“I know.” He did his best to smile convincingly. Apparently it was enough to convince his father who left with that same excited gleam in his eyes. After several minutes of lying face up on his bed and doing his best not to cry, he got up and decided to write a letter to Luna. She was the only one who knew about his feelings for Harry. He couldn’t bring himself to tell his friends just yet. Although he had a feeling some of them probably suspected by now. He had a tendency to act a bit mad around Potter after all.
Dear Potter,
“Did you hear about the hippogriff!” she said tearfully, twisting her hands together.
Dear Potter,
It was only a couple weeks into summer and Draco was already miserable. He had barely seen his father and mother all summer, and thus he had no way to get Potter off his mind. They seemed to be fighting most of the time now. Over what he had no idea. Before this summer they had rarely fought. And even then it had all been in hushed whispers immediately quieted when Draco walked into the room. His father had promised that they would go to the Quidditch cup though. At least he had that to look forward to. The only thing he really had to distract him was Luna. They continued to write letters to each other over the summer and she told him all about the Quibbler and some bizarre stories about some sort of unheard of creature. Whenever he read her letters he was able to forget about Potter and his parents. For a little while at least. It seemed whenever he was trying to sleep and get some peace of mind Potter would always wander to the forefront of his thoughts. He never knew why this happened. Just that every night for Merlin knew how long, Potter had been the last thing he had thought about. Draco would have been more concerned if the feeling that came over him when he thought about Potter wasn’t so pleasant.
“Er, alright then. If that was all?” Draco stepped away, getting ready once more to leave. Before he could leave Severus pulled him closer and for a second there Draco thought he was going to be taken prisoner, but instead he hugged him. Draco stiffened, unsure of what to do. Fuck it. He might be dead in a few days. He threw his arms around Severus and buried his head in his shoulder. After a brief (or long, Draco couldn’t really tell) moment Severus stepped back and nodded at him. Unsure of what to say Draco nodded back, trying to pull himself together. Before he could change his mind he swung his leg over his broom and tied his bag around it. Looking at Severus one last time he kicked off from the ground and flew upwards. Leaving his home behind.
Dear Potter,
“Because he’s, he’s Harry Potter!” He fumbled with his robes, avoiding her gaze.
Hey guys! Sorry it took so long for this chapter to be out. But it's pretty long so I hope everyone likes it. I'm guessing the next chapter should be out in a week or so. Anyway, happy reading :p
When he was younger, Harry would’ve said something. “Need my measurements, miss?” or “My eyes are up here, you know.” Now, he was bored with all the things he could say and he was tired of picking fights. It had never brought him anything. He just wanted to stretch and jog and let people know they could tell him about Those-They-Did-Not-Name.
in a mood. This is my regular mood,’ Draco insisted.
‘Yeah, go. I’ll meet you there.’ Harry pushed Weasley away.
‘Taylor’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,’ Potter told her.
Bulstrode didn’t react in the slightest to Draco’s trauma. She took a deep drag from the pipe and kept the smoke inside her lungs for seconds on end, like it felt good to her to burn up her intestines, before slowly pushing out the smoke through her nose like a dragon.
‘Shut up,’ he mumbled, trying to make his way out of the compartment as quick as he could, but one of the twins grabbed his collar.
‘See!’ Harry called. ‘You do know it!’
Pansy stepped forward. ‘Jason threatened Draco first!’
‘Stop. Stop right there.’
Groaning in frustration, Draco yanked his arm away from Potter to Scorgify himself. He decided to shove back onto Harry’s chair, which was further away from the cauldron and The Threat.
were with her?’
‘Worried,’ Ethan Hanley, their Head Boy, incredulously repeated.
‘Ah,’ said Harry dryly, ‘there’s Hogwarts-Malfoy.’
‘That’s ridiculous, why would they keep you? It’s just a scratch, right?’
Draco sighed.
‘Eh?’ said Hagrid.
‘Oh Draco, come on! You can’t cry forever.’
She was showing him the book she’d gifted Draco that summer: Magic For The Hopelessly Romantic. ‘Basiatio,’ the paragraph read. ‘Kiss charm.’
Draco blinked at the door she just stormed out of. Tell the girls what? What did it prove?
Draco didn’t bother to hide his grin. ‘Dreadful news!’
Meanwhile, Pansy had picked up her cat and slammed open the compartment door. ‘I’m telling the girls!’
Draco smirked. ‘You have a plan?’
Harry shifted in his seat, tapping his fingers until Malfoy was done. ‘I didn’t read any fucking
. . .
Smirking, Draco bent over the map. It took him a while to figure out where their common room was and how many ways there were to get up to the next floor – and then he cursed, because Filch’s office was directly opposite the only stairs they could use.
As Harry let go, Draco drew a steadying breath. ‘Alright,
‘You – you – you…’
‘Yeah, that’s right,’ said Harry offhandedly.
‘Stanley got really angry with me. Mrs Evergreen, too. She sent me the most brutal letter ever, Harry. Even Helena was firm with me.’
Draco forgot what he was going to say.
Harry couldn’t help but snigger as he pushed open the back door. ‘If I’m not back in ten minutes, you can call Henry for back-up, alright?’
Draco glared at Nott and leaned back in his chair. Behind him, Crabbe and Goyle were trying to multiply a cookie. ‘Crabbe, Goyle,’ hissed Draco, ‘go find out what Umbridge did to Weasley and Potter.’
It thawed his frozen heart. All this time, he’d been quietly convinced he was only in the team because his father bought everyone those Nimbuses; it was only last year that they’d yelled at him for letting himself get distracted by Potter, and now they didn’t want him to quit for the same reason.
Draco poised himself like a true Malfoy and opened his mouth to tell Harry that a wizard never revealed his secrets –
‘They’re all darlings,’ mumbled Harry, stifling a yawn that escaped anyway. Before he could ask about the "I don't like it outside"-statement, Draco had moved on.
Theo snorted. ‘You’d know if you were.’
in a mood. Alright, go on then, I’ll follow.’
Vincent and Gregory were chuckling appreciatively at his words, as were a few of his other classmates. Noting the meekness of the laughter, Draco concluded that Pansy was late today.
‘Since when?’ growled Draco.
He looked worried, Draco noted. His nose almost touched the pages while he put his hands around his face to block the world out or laid his mighty arms on top of his head as if to force himself to stay put.
They reached the prefect bathroom, and as they changed back into their swimwear, Draco pondered Nott’s predicament.
. . .
‘How dare you, Potter, I never
Meanwhile, he was even more shielded off than usual: the Weasley twins kept marching ahead of him down the corridors, shouting things like, ‘Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through!’
Looking around, he made sure they were alone in the maze of the dungeons; him, Crabbe and Goyle. He took a deep breathe: ‘Aaaaaaayo!’
for him!’
Every other instance of supposed suspicious activity in Brookley suddenly turned out to be, well… not so bad after all. With all discussion out in the open, communication between citizens significantly diminished the evergrowing pile of unsolved cases. Who’d have thought?
‘Should I ask him out for you?’ asked Pansy, smirking.
‘Piss off, Potter,’ Draco snarled. ‘One of us has to make sure we beat your nerdy friend. I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed their bags by now. Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn’t Granger.’
‘Yes…’ A shark-like grin spread across his father’s face. ‘Tell me, Draco, who does Harry Potter love most?’ A cold wind swept through Draco’s heart. ‘Oh, and I do not necessarily mean love like your mother and I love each other, of course,’ his father sneered, as if that was impossible to imagine, ‘but more in the general sense of the word. Perhaps someone in his family? Or –’
‘Excellent! Draco, you next!’
’ he corrected.
As Draco hurried forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon, he saw Potter laughing. The Boy Who Lived jumped up to yell over everyone’s head: ‘Fate’s a pig, Dra!’
‘What are you doing?’ Draco snarled, grabbing one of the crown-shaped badges, so he could make out the words etched onto them: ‘Weasley is our king...’ He laughed loudly. ‘Oh, this is brilliant!’
‘Everyone’s worrying about me,’ Draco said. ‘Even Snape. Can you imagine Snape worrying, Barnaby, about anything, ever?’
‘How did you sleep?’ He put a tray of toast and the jar of strawberry jam in front of Harry.
really, really deep. You have no idea how bad it was, Potter, I mean, you weren’t there to see it. I was in agony.’
“Alright…”
This whole death eater is going to be harder than I thought. And believe me, I was already pretty damn sure it was going to be hard. You see the thing is, Snape is trying to help me, so now I have to have my guard up 24/7. Which is very exhausting. I don’t know why he’s trying to help me, I mean it’s my problem and the dark lord will probably kill him if he ever finds out what he’s doing. So why even try? But apparently he made some sort of vow with my mother. And why Harry, why. It’s as if they think I can’t do this myself. Okay I know, I can’t do this myself because I’m trapped. Yet I did find a short term solution and am currently working on the bigger picture. I mean so far the only thing I’ve come up with is to run away together, but something tells me that isn’t the brightest idea I’ve ever had. The other problem I have is you. I don’t like keeping this from you. I don’t know if you would understand, or if you wouldn’t. I’ve contemplated telling you just to see what would happen but I don’t want you to be put in danger because of me. So I suppose the only thing to do is feel guilty all the time. I wonder if you can tell if something is troubling me. If you can, you haven’t asked. Which is a good thing I suppose. It’s already hard enough keeping this from you, I don’t want to have to lie to your face. Even though I sort of already am. This is stressing me out further. I’m going to think of a solution now.
“I want to be with Potter.” he groaned and put his head in his hands.
(This letter is going to be considerably long so I decided to split it into paragraphs. Not that it matters since you shall never read this. I like things to be organized, alright?) The World Cup was fairly boring. Quidditch is...somewhat mediocre in my opinion. I know I play for my bloody team but honestly I have no motivation to keep doing so. As most things in my life are, it was my fathers idea. That’s not what I was going to talk about though. What I meant to say is quite terrifying. I think I finally know what my parents have been hiding from me. You and your little circle seemed to think my father is a current Death Eater. And I believe you are correct. I knew he used to be one, but he always told me he was under the imperius. So I guess he lied. I should have known, I know. My father lies about quite a lot of things. I need to apologize Potter. I was freaking the fuck out to put it plainly when you and your friends came running out of nowhere. I made some off hand comment about Granger. I don’t even really know what I said. Just that it must have been bad. I used that filthy word again. My fathers likes it when I do. But it makes me feel disgusting and rotting inside. By any means, I’m sorry nonetheless. I may not like Granger, yet I do not wish her any harm. I want you to know that I regret what I said. Even though it is highly likely you will never know my apologies for the things I say, I like to believe that you are actually reading these letters. It helps me sleep at night.
“What happens when young people reach...reach a certain age.” Snape took a very long, very deep breath and continued. “You see now that you’ve reached this age you need to know about…” He was drawing this out so long Draco was growing frustrated.
“Why do you look so down Draco?” His Aunt asked with a laugh, she came over to him and squeezed his shoulders all too tightly. “We are about to make history!” She threw her head back and let a laugh bubble out of her chest. Oh sweet Merlin he was so fucking screwed.
Hermione, Ginny, and Luna glanced at each other uncertainly.
“Alright.” Granger said, sounding a little confused. Weasley shrugged and the pair kept walking.
“That day. In the corridor.” Draco sucked in a shallow breath and wished he could see Potter’s face. He wanted to know just how close he was to him. Draco took an uncertain step forward.
“It is I! Severus Snape.” The drawling voice came from the hooded figure and Severus threw back the hood of his cloak to reveal himself. Shite. Was this a good thing?
Dear Potter,
Draco brightened. “You can ask me to do anything!”
“You-” He pointed at Draco. “Could be killed, or tortured. And you.” He whirled on Harry. “He is just another way for the dark lord to hurt you.”
“Come on boy!” Greyback called, baring his nasty yellow canines. “Show us where he is!” He. Dumbledore.
“Well we have Snape at least, he’ll help us get in right?” Harry asked, looking at Draco.
Sincerely,
Draco blinked. He wondered what was going on with her. Most likely it had something to do with Harry and Weasley, though something about that felt off.
“You’re up to something.” Weasley nodded furiously. “I know it.”
“Right this way then lad.” Tom nodded at him, looking him up and down, before motioning towards the stairs. “I’ll show you where you can stay. Got your money with yah?”
“I’m going to go visit her,” he said stiffly.
“I’m not the one who’s always picking on us for no apparent reason!”
“I don't know.” Draco said, doing his best to keep his voice steady. No one said anything for the rest of the train ride.
“Oh? Who?” he inquired.
“Single handed…” Potter repeated. Draco felt Potter’s breath on his cheek and every single thought about Sirius Black vanished from his head. Focus, he had to...Draco moved his foot slightly and it touched Potter’s under the table. He felt himself flush but made no move to pull his foot away. He wasn’t going to be the first one to do so. From the corner of his eye he saw Potter start to turn red as well, but he still didn’t move his foot. Draco turned and pretended to busy himself with Potions ingredients while really studying him. He gazed at the tousled black hair, and bright green eyes, the way he was biting his lip. Potter was...was- Oh Merlin’s pants. He was beautiful.
“Yeah, yeah of course.” Draco nodded, slipping his hand into Harry’s.
“So...I don’t know how. But the death eaters, they captured Harry. And when I finally got a chance to go see him, he told me to obliviate him.” He sucked in a breath, hoping she didn’t explode on him.
“So think about that, and try breathing again. And I’m going to try and legilimance you.”
“What was that?” Blaise asked shakily.
“Yeah mate come on we’re trying to sleep.” Theo mumbled. Draco hadn’t realized that he had been tossing and turning in his bed, clutching the letter to his chest.
“It’s Potter.” Severus pressed his lips tightly together and shook his head. “You’re distracted, I can tell.” Well, okay. It was Potter. But not in the way he thought.
He snorted softly. “None taken, it smells in here anyway.” He stood and offered her a hand. She took it and together they left the motel.
“There is not much room between the spaces of hating and loving one another.” She said simply. That was some metaphorical bullshit if Draco had ever heard any.
“Damn, it’s 8:30.” Draco glanced at the clock that had just appeared on the wall behind Harry.
If it was somehow possible, Umbridge’s eyes bulged further. She shook her head, a scary smile playing across her lips. “It. Was. An. Accident.”
Sincerely,
“Alright.” He shrugged and held the door open for her, not able to resist a glance over his shoulder.
“Brilliant! You did it.” He jumped up and grabbed Harry’s hands. Harry pulled him into a hug, grinning broadly.
Sirius Black was dead. His mother sent a letter and told him. Black was Potter’s godfather, he’d known that forever. If possible, Potter looked sadder and sadder every single day. He was always alone these days too. Luna said he didn’t want to talk to anyone.
“You two are kind of ridiculous.”
Draco made a noise in the back of his throat and smiled a little, shaking his head.
Sincerely,
I FINISHED A FIC GUYSSSSSSS. I'm very proud of myself, usually I abandon my fics hahhhh. Anyway announcement time everyone.
“Have you ever been to London?” Hermione asked, giving him a glance as they strode down the busy street. “Muggle I mean.”
“Severus left the other Death Eaters there, I don’t know what he’s planning but he must be thinking of something.” He said, trying to convince himself that Severus was actually on their side.
Draco could hear Harry’s swallow. No one spoke for several moments, then Draco gathered up the courage to ask,
Draco Malfoy
“Dumbledore, Snape murdered him.” His voice was flat as he rubbed a hand against his nose. “He’s dead.” He repeated. Hermione had gone rigid.
Dear Potter,
“What?” Draco felt like he was watching this whole scene play from above. This couldn’t possibly be happening. How was it possible for so much to go wrong in one night?
A few days later Draco received a letter from his father. Which was an extremely rare occurrence, so he tore the letter open with excitement. Only to be confused by its contents.
“I know, that’s what I thought too.” Hermione nodded at Ginny. “But there’s these numbers on it, under his name. It’s an address.”
“I’ll be better, I promise.” Draco said solemnly.
“No, I should go sit with the others.” Draco said sadly.
“Yeah, yeah of course.” He responded in a low voice. For the second time in an hour he was sure his face was on fire.
“What happened?” Draco asked, curious. Snape heaved a great angry sigh.
And Luna wasn’t even around to talk to him. He could send letters but that wasn’t nearly the same thing.
Malfoy
Draco
“Doing well Draco?” he asked softly. Draco pressed his lips together to stop them from shaking. Hot tears burned the back of his eyes and he squeezed them shut briefly.
“Draco.” she began, her voice quavered and she glanced over her shoulder. She shut the door silently and sat on his bed, drawing in a breath. Draco studied her face for any sign of what was going on.
I thought you were going to die there for a second. I mean, I’m fairly sure everyone thought you were dementor food. You fell and it looked like they were all going to swarm on top of you, and well, eat you. I’m just telling it how it is. You’re fine now. You ignored me as you walked out of the hospital wing with Granger and Weasley. Which is normal and to be expected. Something is very wrong with me, Potter. I felt happy when I heard you were okay. And I don’t understand why. I was happy that you were not dead. Why do I care, you might ask? Well to be perfectly honest I don’t even know myself. I don’t know why but I think I might care about you Potter. Not that it matters. I only care about you because you’re my enemy. That’s right. I have to go do some serious thinking now. I’m glad you didn’t fall to your death and imminent doom.
“Er-Can I have a room please?” he said slowly, not making eye contact. Thank Merlin no one he recognized was in here.
Sincerely,
Draco drew in a breath and took out a small knife. He slashed his palm quickly and held it to the house like she had said. Something in his chest pulled. Was that a sign it had worked?
“Sit down Ms. Abbott!”
“I’ll need to see it though. Why don’t you bring it to the shop?”
Sincerely,
“Oh...Guess it’s hard for her to accept that we’re really at war.” Draco shrugged, not knowing what else to do.
“That’s fine.” he said, swallowing hard. His heart was pounding so hard he wouldn’t have been surprised if everyone could hear. She pulled him into a hug before motioning towards the door. Together they walked down the stairs. Towards the dark lord. He was still seated eerily at the table, tracing his fingers along the smooth wood of it. He was so pale, nothing about him was human.
The dark lord is inside my house. I got home, and there he was, sitting at my dining table like it was completely normal for him to welcome me home. I’m so scared I feel like passing out. I can’t breathe, I can’t think. Why is he here? In my house. He smiled at me and I let out a squeak before sprinting upstairs. I half expected him to murder me as I ran away or curse me, or I don’t know. Do something. But he let me go. And now I’m sitting here, shaking and trying to think about something else. I know now that my father is in Azkaban. I missed my mother's first letter about that. I know that you’re the reason he’s there. And I mean, I feel like I should miss him. But I don’t really. I won’t be getting any more letters about  doing better in school, or trying to get you expelled. Maybe, for once I can have a somewhat normal year without my father’s expectations hanging over me. Although that is probably not true because for some unknown reason the dark lord is in my house. And-
Dear Harry,
For some reason that only made Draco sob harder. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. He knew that he and Harry were supposed to be together. But Harry didn’t remember that, and he never would. He would never know about their history together, about how they were so in love that they decided to go against Severus’s demand and stay in a relationship. How Draco had tried, and failed, to teach Harry occlumency.
“No, I think he’s going to pay.” Weasley drew his wand once again and he felt himself double over in laughter.
You’re worst enemy
“See what?” he asked, confused.
Pansy gave Draco a hopeful look.
“Of course it matters, I can’t stop thinking about it!” Potter also drew near him and Draco tried his best not to look like he was about to pass out.
“Oh, er...are you hurt?” Funnily enough, Potter’s voice brought him back to reality. His thoughts trickled down to a small stream and his vision grew less fuzzy.
“Oh, I’m very sorry.” she said, looking at the armor on the floor, sadly. She glanced at Draco and studied his face. “Something is troubling you.” She observed.
“It’s Black.” Snape said furiously. “We had him, and he escaped. It’s Potter’s fault. All his fault, just like his father he is. Going around doing whatever he wants, not thinking of the consequences. He could’ve bloody killed me but not like he cares.” Snape was throwing random ingredients into a cauldron and Draco wondered for a moment if he was making some sort of poison to murder Potter before he got back on the train.
“Yes! You drive me insane Potter! Every single fucking day, you drive me insane!” Oh no. Draco hadn’t meant to say that out loud. All the color drained from Potter’s face.
“Draco! Brilliant, the dark lord will be pleased.” She made a hissing noise in the back of her throat and made to embrace him. Draco resisted the impulse to flinch as she flung her arms around him and squeezed tightly.
“You’re not going to give up, and neither are we. We have the basilisk fangs so now more of us can destroy horcruxes. We only have two left.” Draco’s pain was fading and he struggled to sit up, vision blurry. Hermione had her hands on Harry’s shoulders and she was shaking him, hard.
“Luna?” he asked slowly, not wanting to startle her. He looked around for Madam Pince. She was nowhere in sight.
Draco felt hot tears burn the back of his throat, but he didn’t want to cry in front of Harry. Not right now anyway. When Harry was locked in a cell.
“I was all by myself, because Ginny and Neville left and I didn’t want to be alone in the dark-”
“Who is it?” he called, not really sure he wanted to know the answer.
“Do you?” she replied. No, Draco had no idea what the bloody hell was going on with him.
In February Draco took Harry to a lake, only to be attacked by some snatchers mere minutes after they had gotten there. The lot of them spent longer than Draco wished to admit thinking. They spent hours with books spread across the floor, pouring them. Draco soon discovered that Harry couldn’t focus for longer than 15 minutes. Which frustrated Hermione to no end but Draco found rather endearing.
Draco gritted his teeth and brushed past them. If he wasn’t scared out of his wits, he would’ve stomped up the stairs like a child. Once he got up the stairs he realized now was the time to bring the wards down. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and let the feeling of magic rushing around him overtake him. He felt a tingle pass through him, and he knew anyone else in the house would feel the same.
“Stop that.”
Many were dead and those who were still alive seemed to have a haunted sort of look in their eyes. Draco had hardly recognized his own reflection when he starred in the mirror the morning after. Though now after a few months of mind healing and quiet conversations he was doing much better. He hoped others could say the same. To be perfectly honest he didn’t know what he was going to do with the rest of his life. So it was a good thing really that he was going to go back to school with Harry and the rest of their friends.
“I’d like a word with you Draco.” Came Severus’ stern voice. Shite. He was here too? Finally, Harry came into view. He ducked out from under some curtains, looking puzzled. He mouthed something to Draco but he was no good at reading lips. He settled for gesturing wildly with his hands, not quite sure exactly what he was hoping to convey to Harry.
“Come.” The dark lord stood from his seat and turned to face them, his red eyes narrowing in on them. Draco walked unsteadily towards him, already pushing up his sleeve. As soon as he got within arms reach of him, the dark lord roughly grabbed Draco’s arm and placed the tip of his wand to it. Draco didn’t have time to think what would happen before a sharp, stabbing pain was making its way up his arm and the mark was spreading over it. He nearly passed out from how badly it hurt, and looked quickly away when he saw it. It was disgusting. He would never be able to get rid of it. It was always going to be there, taunting him. And he couldn’t do anything about it.
“Well I wasn’t, alright?”
“You both are incredibly stupid.”
“Like what?”
“Right.” The owl was rather handsome, with a lovely pattern of brown and black patches across it’s back. Draco quickly untied the other letter and motioned towards the door.
“Not yet.” Each word was drawn out slowly from Severus’s lips, every syllable made clear on his tongue. Not yet. As all of them headed back to the castle, Draco continued to check the coin when he hoped no one was looking. Finally he felt the coin grow warm and he stiffened. Now didn’t seem like a very good moment for him to whip out the coin and read the message.
“Yes.”
“Er-yeah. But, I’m here now. And I’m gonna figure something out.”
“I’m gonna go.” Harry mouthed, and Draco nodded, trying not to look too disappointed.
“Oh don’t look like that, I’m not going to do anything.” Granger said testily, rolling her eyes.
“Professor Slughorn, I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?” Draco flushed and tried not to look incredibly guilty. He hadn’t been about to do anything terrible after all. What was the point of him being publicly humiliated? What was he supposed to say to this? He hadn’t said anything of the bloody sort!
“There’s someone else.” he gasped a little, aghast to feel tears coming against his eyes. Theo’s face fell, and Draco’s heart sank.
“Possibly.” They stared at each other and Draco raised his eyebrows, questioning.
“You know what Draco.” He took a step forward.
“The wrackspurt in your brain is very nice to talk to.” she said breathily. What the bloody hell was a wrackspurt?
You are not speaking to me. You’ve spoken to everyone else, even Severus. I couldn’t believe my own ears when I heard the two of you talking quietly in the kitchen. I didn’t make much effort to speak to you either at first. I had some weird chest pain, and my breathing became incredibly difficult. I stayed in there for a couple hours before Ginny pounded on the door and told me to get out before she broke down the door. I bet she would’ve. Hermione’s going to be okay though, I’m glad. I won’t pretend I wasn’t worried sick. Everyone’s still pissed at her though. I don’t understand why she would do something so incredibly stupid. I mean she’s literally the smartest person in all of Hogwarts. Hell I wouldn’t be surprised if she was the smartest person in the whole wizarding world. No matter. She’s safe now at least. I tried talking to you the other day, but you left the room right as I entered. I certainly helped no one told you about our history, and then what I did. I don’t think anyone would have. Hopefully that is. I wonder what you do remember of me. All the terrible stuff I guess. That doesn’t erase the sting I feel every time I see you though. You’re still beautiful. Merlin. I’m doomed. I’m going to go wallow now Potter. There doesn’t seem to be much else I can do at the moment.
Potter took a long look at him before turning and walking away. And any happiness that Draco had felt earlier vanished like an unspoken promise.
“Bloody hell mate he’s a creep.” Weasley muttered darkly. Granger was opening and closing her mouth in horror.
“They’re going to put one to death!” she practically shrieked. “They’re going to murder that majestic creature right here on school grounds!”
“I-” Draco started. Then warm hands pulled him closer and Draco couldn’t think of anything else to say. He was shaking again. And he knew Potter was too. He reached a hand to run his fingers through Potter’s hair, however he immediately yanked it back when he heard voices. Granger and Weasley. Of course.
“I’m sorry love, you need to obliviate me.” Some part of Draco had known that he was going to say that.
“Severus was here?” He asked, not sure he had heard right. Harry stared at him with an odd expression on his face.
“A while.” she admitted, looking down. “I wanted to explain but you looked rather angry.”
“Try it.” Draco said with a shrug. They were in the room of requirement, which only had two pillows placed on the floor. A very good place to try and clear your mind. But it wasn’t working very well for Harry. They had been at this for nearly two hours now and curfew was quickly approaching.
“Potter-”
“Well we couldn’t really talk much because the Death Eaters were there, but he told me to go hide. I don’t really know what that means though…”
“Er...I’m going to be fine guys.” Hermione blushed, and fixed her gaze on the ceiling. “Really.”
“I like Potter!” he said very loudly, then clapped a hand over his mouth in horror. Luna screamed in delight and wrapped him in a hug.
“I wanted to ask you a question.” he began. She nodded at him, waiting for him to continue.
“It’s your turn, you big grump.” Pansy stormed into the common room and crossed at her arms.
The very next day Potter dragged him behind some curtains. Draco had been alone, intending to go to the library to do some thinking about his situation. Er-or about Potter. That seemed to be where his thoughts always wandered anyway. Then suddenly a familiar rough hand had pulled him behind heavy curtains. And Draco hadn’t been scared, he had been thrilled.
“Yes, come here Draco.” his father beckoned him with a wave of his hand. Draco came to stand next to his father.
Draco couldn’t say anything. There was a lump so big in his throat he feared it would always be there. He just shook his head and held her.
“Ready love? I think Harry will be here soon.” A smile danced around her lips and Draco fought back a smile. To his great surprise and delight, his mother adored Harry. As most everyone did.
“We don’t know quite yet. The others wanted to make sure we could trust you before we all got together.” Draco blinked.
Draco
I thought you were dragon food. I thought the dragon was going to eat you and I would never get to see you again. I am thoroughly embarrassed of how I behaved while you were stuck in the arena with that dragon. I was sitting with Luna and Theo (Pansy and Blaise were off somewhere sucking face, it was rather an unpleasant sight to witness but that’s besides the point) and now I suspect Theo knows something is very very wrong with me. And, well, the dragon singed you. So I began screaming my bloody head off. Luna tried tugging on my sleeve to snap me out of it but I legitimately thought you were going to die. I have thought this many times before but never have I had to think I was going to actually watch you die. I may or may not have started sobbing. I hate you for making me feel this way, Potter. I wish I could go back to the days when I hated you, but now that I truly think about it, I don’t think I ever did. I’ve never hated you, and I don’t think I can. I mean I hate you for turning me into a love struck idiot. But I don’t actually hate you. This is all very complicated and I wish that I could forget all about you. I’m going to go drown in my own sorrows now.
“Yeah, she sure does doesn’t she.”
Draco Malfoy who is exhausted but still loves you quite a bit
“No it bloody wasn’t!” Hannah said louding, getting to her feet.
“Was that what you weren’t telling me?” she asked excitedly.
“Wards.” Breathed Draco, staring at the letter in awe. His heart was pounding very fast now, and his mind was racing in excitement. Ginny, who had come to stand at his shoulder to read the letter, frowned.
“Yes.” Draco replied, trying not to let the guilt creep into his voice. He ignored the painful twisting of his stomach. Right now was a moment for celebration, not sorrow.
He was about to suggest they part ways when Harry pulled him into a kiss. He tried not to burst into giggles as Harry tugged him closer and ran his finger down Draco’s cheek. He put his hands to Harry’s neck, heart beating rapidly. He had never known lips could feel so soft as his parted gently and allowed for Harry’s tongue to slip inside. Warmth came over Draco as he kissed Harry back and he tried to breath in the sensation of the moment. They pulled away from each other, both breathing a little harder.
Draco shook his head no. “But I can’t imagine it will be too difficult, at least now we know what we have to do.”
“I’ve been busy.” Draco said testily.
It wasn’t until Harry had mentioned something about Ravenclaw that Hermione had practically screamed with joy.
“I ran into Harry, his aura is very joyful.”
I do hope I do not have to deal with your insufferable presence when I go shopping in Diagon Alley with my mother and father. I remember last year I saw you, although I didn’t know who you were at the time, and what an annoying being you be on my life. I really thought we were going to be friends. Obviously that didn’t work out. But I am merely writing to tell you that I will be in Diagon Alley tomorrow, and you better not be there. I don’t want to get in a fight with you before school even starts. It makes a bad impression. Although you wouldn’t know anything about that. You certainly don’t seem to care what sort of impressions you make on anyone. Honestly you should’ve been expelled by now. That’s besides the point. I better not see you until September 1st. Who knows. Maybe I’ll get lucky and you won’t come back to school at all. Actually you need to come back to school. You’re my one true enemy.
“Er-I can I guess.” Draco hadn’t really been looking forward to this part, best to get it over with now.
“You make sure you read those.”
Draco’s heart dropped to his stomach. “Fa-father, Harry and I are supposed to be friends.”
Ginny rolled her eyes. “That can’t be, we know he’s not on our side now, he killed Dumbledore for crying out loud!”
“Is Harry still in your house?” She asked, voice shaking. His pulse quickened and he fought the urge to begin pacing the room.
“I can’t see you.” He interrupted, trying to keep the panic out of his voice.
“No.” he said in a low voice, running both hands over his face. It couldn’t be over so quickly. They hadn’t been together that long. How could he have screwed it up that fast?
“Come on, Harry’s got something to tell you.” she nodded at Potter. And then her eyes swept back to his. Bloody hell. Was he going to walk away without a scrape? Thank Merlin. Weasley was turning away and Draco would have done the same but he noticed something in Weasley’s fist. His newspaper. Now he knew it was stupid to get so worked up over something such as a newspaper.  But it was the first piece of mail his father had sent him in weeks.
“Go.” This time he pushed Draco away from whatever was happening. People were still screaming and duels had broken out everywhere.
“So I guess we have to plan a wedding then.” Harry said, wiping at his eyes. Draco laughed wetly.
“It’s alright, I know he’s terrible, believe me. Where are we going?” He was desperate to move on from the subject of his father. It always made him feel icy and slightly sick inside. Memories of long lectures about Muggleborns and bloody purity poked at his head. He shook himself a little, as if that would help get his head clear.
Draco Malfoy
A few days after Draco tucked the latest letter away Severus ambushed him in the library and scared the shite out of him. It was late, nearly 8, and Draco was reading up on charms when he saw a shadow towering over him. He almost screamed before Severus put a hand over his mouth and he realized who it was.
“They did.” He rapsed, suddenly overcome with emotion.
“Fine, fine. Jeez, Ginny don’t look at me like that.”
Sincerely your enemy forever and ever,
“You.” said Harry, opening one eye. Draco flushed and looked away. They were never going to get anywhere at this rate.
“Hermione Granger.” It sounded like Hermione, however Draco knew enough now about what went on during war to know about impersonations.
Harry realized what his silence meant.
“Some son you are. I just came to give you your going away gift. Since I did not get the pleasure of doing so last time.” His father smirked and strode over to them, not even glancing at Severus and Harry. With a jolt Draco realized the pair must be invisible.
She pressed her lips together and he could practically see her holding back another eye roll.
“Mhm?” Draco looked up from the notes he had been taking on his latest patient.
“Should we go knock on her door?” Ginny asked Luna. She nodded and hopped off the counter.
All three of them stared at her in disbelief.
So he found himself wandering the corridors at night, intending to return to the room of requirement. Not really to work on the wardrobe, the solution for solving it was fairly simple, he merely wanted to sit there so he didn’t have to surround himself with people he was constantly lying to. He hadn’t expected to get caught as he knew that Slughorn was having his little gathering this evening and students were likely to be around the area. However on his way to the room of requirement he realized too late that Ms. Norris had been tailing him. Bloody cat.
“Oi! Malfoy!” He had no idea which twin tapped him on the shoulder. Draco tried his best not to panic.
“What is it?” Draco swallowed around the crack in his voice.
Hermione shot him a grateful look before continuing. “The address is here in London, so I could walk there.” She explained.
Harry nodded. Drawing in a quiet breath Draco pointed his wand and whispered,
“Come in,” he said. His mother entered and shut the door behind her.
“Yes, obviously. Are you going to carry him or shall I?” He asked, giving Draco a slow blink.
Draco pretended his hand wasn’t shaking as he said, “Bombarda.” And the cell door exploded. Wow. Draco hadn’t actually expected this to be so easy.
“Hi.” he replied, following her gaze. A little ways away Potter stood awkwardly with one of the Patil twins. He tried to take in a steady breath and look as if he was unbothered. He was fine. Everything was fine. This was fine.
You’re friend Draco Malfoy
“No, it’s not.”
After a few days of worrying terribly, Draco realized the entire thing had simply been a false alarm. They put Potter on trial and everything but he got off. Something about Dumbledore, his mother had told him, but he hadn’t been paying attention. He was too excited by the fact that Potter was coming back. He practically flew up the stairs and flung himself at his desk to write another letter. Though right at that moment two owls came flapping towards his window and clicked their beaks noisily. Blinking once, Draco opened his window cautiously.
“Your father has displeased the dark lord greatly and-and he needs you to carry out a task for him. To bring-” She broke off, choking on the words. He reached a hand out to comfort her but she stood abruptly. She began pacing the length of his room.
“Oh.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked torn for a brief moment before speaking again. “Alright, but I don’t want him in the room when I tell you guys.” He jerked his head towards Draco. He felt as if he was being stabbed in the chest over and over again.
“Please don’t tell me you’re going to leave me too.” she said desperately, her voice tight with pain. Draco sighed and sat on the couch at her feet.
“What did they do to you?” Draco blurted before he could stop himself. Harry eyed him warily.
“Right. What did you want?”
Draco followed her out of the cafe, giving a small wave to the waitress who had gone to clean their table.
“Hello Draco.” she replied, giving him a small smile.
“Yes, that looks fine.” He said stiffly. Merlin, why was he so bloody awkward? For once he wanted to be able to hold a normal conversation and not sound like a bloody idiot during the whole of it. Harry gave him a curious glance and the corner of his mouth tilted upward.
“I’m sorry Luna, I can’t talk right now.” he said quickly, turning and practically running back to the dungeons.
“Thanks.” Draco said softly. She nodded and went into the kitchen.
“They don’t seem to like me very much. Everyone keeps telling me to stuff it when I tell my stories.” She rolled her eyes a little. “Most seem to be very close minded around here.”
It turned out Draco was actually quite good at tuning people out. He didn’t really pay attention to what was going on for most of the game, and by the time he came back to himself, it was already over. Draco had been planning to book it to the changing rooms but one of the twin’s voices stopped him.
“Draco you can open your eyes.” Ginny laughed. “It’s safe.” Draco felt himself flush bright red. Oh. He opened his eyes uncertainly and stared at the two of them. Luna was sitting on the counter, her ankles crossed. And Ginny was sitting behind her, chin resting on her shoulder.
Draco shuddered a shallow breath and stared at Luna. Her eyes were wide with fear.
Dear Potter,
“We aren’t ridiculous.” Draco snapped, rubbing at his temples. Great. Now he was getting a stress headache. Maybe this whole thing was ridiculous.
“Excuse me?” Potter hesitated, looking confused.
Dear Potter,
“Is everything okay with you?”
“Hello.” Granger said, turning pink as well. This day hadn’t turned out exactly as he had thought it would. After looking at them for a brief moment Draco turned and left, feeling irrationally angry at all of them.
“What did it mean?” He wished desperately that he could see his face so that he could pull him into another kiss to show him exactly what it had meant to him.
Draco felt something icy brush against his insides. That was true. He had never thought about that before. Someone should’ve noticed when an 11 year old girl was possessed and wandering around the castle covered in blood at odd hours. A newfound admiration for Ginny Weasley sprung up inside him.
“Er, that’s right.”
“Right.” Draco made to walk away but a strange sound stopped him. A rustling was coming from behind the corridor.
“Mmmm.” Alecto rolled her eyes and groaned. “The dark lord will not be pleased that this is taking so long. He wanted us to do other business tonight.” Her cold voice cut through the wispy night air smoothly. Other business? Besides killing Dumbledore? Wasn’t that enough for one night?
Draco was a Malfoy! He was in Slytherin! Betraying a friend would never even cross his mind!
The pendant simply wasn’t Potter’s to keep. If Draco wasn’t using it, it was supposed to go back into the family vaults.
It would turn out to be their most chaotic exam so far.
‘What was that? Who did that?’ said Draco, trying to wipe his hair clean.
Then one morning, Ulysses landed on his shoulder as if he’d never stopped doing it. It startled Draco so that a sausage slipped from his fork, flew across the table and landed in Flint’s lap; who looked so murderous that Draco quickly made a show of looking the other way. Taking the letter from the owl’s claw, he recognized his mother’s handwriting at once. He slouched in relief.
Draco whirled towards her. ‘What's next, Pansington? Running naked into the Forbidden Forest covered in gravy? Who knows where this ends!’
Blood stained Draco’s hands – Potter’s blood. ‘Harry, for Merlin’s sake, what did you do?’ Falling on his knees, he dragged Harry’s head on his legs and pressed his forehead against Potter’s. ‘I love you.’
have to be my date.’
, my tea’s practically coffee –
Madam Pomfrey put a cup of tea on the table and motioned at an empty chair. ‘Sit down, Draco.’
‘Oh, horrid fate!’ she replied, suitably affected. ‘Explains a lot, though, doesn’t it?’
His arm hardly hurt anymore, but when he twisted it into his shirt, Madam Pomfrey caught sight of his wince before he could hide it. When she got up to him, Draco grabbed his wand. ‘I’m going to Potions, madam, even if it’s the last thing I do.’
‘I will not,’ said Draco flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack. ‘I see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.’
Draco clenched his jaws tight and lowered his eyes. He wanted to play.
‘I want to see what’s happened.’
Malfoy scowled. ‘You mean, my mother?’
Slowly, Draco picked it up, took it in for a few seconds, then held it out to Pansy, as if she was the expert on prefect badge authenticity.
' Draco exclaimed. ‘What am I supposed to do with a boy? I wanted to be friends with him, not –’ Draco took another shaky breath, putting a hand in his side like he'd just ran a mile. ‘Oh Merlin, this is a disaster... He’s so
‘On my whistle,’ said Madam Hooch. ‘Three… two… one…’
Draco liked the echoing and the cavernous feel of the Boat House.
‘Sod off!’ snarled Draco, pushing Gregory away.
Draco wanted one. He would write Father at once.
Smirking, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and closed his eyes. The next half hour, instead of Arithmancy, Draco practiced French kissing. Harry wasn’t as naturally gifted with the skill as Draco’d expected from a celebrity – quite sloppy, in fact – but rapidly picked up on what Draco liked.
One of the tiniest first-years Draco had ever seen sidled up to Draco and held his sleeve. Terrified, he looked round at Pansy, but she was busy singing and playing the boss. He tried to shake off the little hand while screaming the next line, but it didn’t work; the girl only shuffled closer to him, singing softly to herself, ‘People want to know-o.’
“It’s freezing.” Pansy shook, wrapping her arms around herself.
“I know you’re there Potter.” After a rustling from above Potter was in front of them, holding a silvery looking blanket. Wait a second.
“I can see that Nymphadora.”
Fuming in his dormitory that night Draco stuffed the letter into his box while blinking furiously. It wasn’t fair. Draco had tried to do everything right so Harry would like him. And now his nightmare had become reality. Harry didn’t like him. Harry didn’t think Draco was good enough for him. Choking a little Draco swallowed hastily before anyone could hear him. He wiped the tears from his eyes and left to go join his true friends.
“It’s just me.” Severus said softly.
“You don’t have to explain to me.” Theo said with a shrug.
It wasn’t until a few months later that Draco absolutely lost what little peace of mind he had left. Luna had made some joke about house rivalries and Draco had been laughing along with Theo and Pansy, when a flash of light appeared. All three of them lept to their feet and started clapping excitedly. The band started playing and everyone was screaming in excitement. A scream sounded from the audience. And then another. And then the most guttural scream Draco had ever heard sounded from a little ways away. It was the 6th year Diggory had been snogging. He was screaming. Screaming so loud that it sounded more animal than human. Pansy clapped a hand to her mouth and muffled a scream of her own.
“Nothing to say now boy?” Lucius asked, eyes still glittering. Mutely, Draco fumbled for Severus’s arm. He had to get out of here. He nearly vomited all over his father as he was yanked away, twisting and turning. Severus must’ve deemed him unfit to apparate. Which was pretty true at the moment.
“Draco, we need to discuss something very important.” Lucius said seriously.
“Hey! I know where Harry Potter is!” He screamed at the top of his lungs, doing his best to look confident. He crossed his arms and glared at everyone, praying the lot of them could hurry the hell up. All the chatter in the room went deadly silent, and hundreds of heads swept his way. Draco blinked, then continued.
“Yeah, yeah I know.” Draco sighed. It wasn’t until a few days later that Draco began reading the books. One particular one caught his interest. A Guide to Gender and Sexuality Terms (what you should know). It wasn’t until page 136 of this book that it hit Draco. He was gay. And he, Dear Merlin. He liked Potter. No. No, that couldn’t possibly be what this feeling was. Sure he was gay, but he didn’t like Potter and his really nice hair, and eyes, and...Well fuck.
“Excuse me.” he said hurriedly. And sprinted up the stairs to the owlery.
Sincerely,
Hellooooo. Here's the next chapter! And I actually like this chapter somehow so I really hope you guys do to. Next chapter should be up in a week or a little longer than that. And please review because I love reading them! *sends love*
“Busy.” His tone was flat and he spoke almost in a whisper. Merlin, why was Severus always so dramatic?
“We wanna know why you’re messing with our brother!”
“No, no not yet. Dumbledore has fled the castle it seems.” Severus gazed at Draco with an expression that he was unable to read. Fled the castle...What the bloody hell was going on?
Three months later they got married on the front steps of Hogwarts, with all of their friends there. Hermione sobbed through the entire thing, Ron awkwardly patted her on the back and she blew her nose in his jacket as a response. He didn’t seem to mind much. The whole thing was really lovely, and Draco couldn’t believe he had somehow gotten happier in the span of one glorious day.
“Er, hi. Sorry about not getting back to you.” Draco said with a small shrug. Pansy shook her head and glanced around to make sure no one was listening.
In the chaos Draco took the chance to sprint after them, dodging curses all the while. He watched as Harry and Ginny were pulled into the fireplace, and disappeared. Where were Hermione and Luna? He wanted to stay and find them, but he knew that if he stayed there wouldn’t be any hope for him. He would be captured and sent to Azkaban, where he would be of no help to anyone. Among the curses, he apparated out of the ministry. Dear Merlin he hoped he didn’t splinch himself.
“You’re in, right? No backing out now, after I tell you everything, you have to stay with us.”
Dear Potter,
“You got it too.” Theo breathed, his eyes glistened and he raised the sleeve of his uniform to reveal a twin mark to the one on Draco’s own arm.
Ron and Hermione never had a wedding because they eloped only weeks after Harry and Draco’s. Molly was pretty pissed about that, but she soon got over it when she learned Hermione was pregnant.
Sincerely,
“It’s me.” Luna said, slipping out from behind a statue of armor.
“I know where Harry Potter is, and if you pardon me, I will tell you exactly where he is!”
Pansy sighed one of those extra dramatic sighs. “Yes, yes you better.” Draco gave her a small smile before dragging himself up and going out into the corridor. It was terribly boring walking back and forth down the corridors, waiting to catch someone so he could take points and perhaps feel a little bit better. He thought about what Pansy had said. She thought Theo had a crush on him! The very idea was preposterous. Of course Theo didn’t like him. She had to have been mistaken. Although she somehow had guessed that he fancied Potter, no idea how she had done that. He had done his best to pretend he hated Potter after all. Not pretend. He did hate Potter. He just happened to also have a small crush on him. Draco groaned and lay his head against the cool stone wall. This was ridiculous. Was his patrol over yet? It felt like he had been walking out here for hours.
Uncle Barnaby. I am sleeping.’
Smirking broadly, Vincent and Draco swung Nott back and forth by his arms and legs, lifting him a little higher in the air each time, while jeering to the beat of their swings, ‘Are you a witch or are you a fairy, or are you the wife of the Muggle Cleary – And one, two – THREE!’
‘That’s an easy one,’ he drawled, shoving down any feelings of betrayal. ‘His horrible hero-complex. You see, he feels responsible for every problem in Hogwarts, and I mean every problem. He does it every year, you know. In first year he had the illusion that an eleven year old would be better at stopping the Dark Lord from taking the Philosopher’s Stone than all of our professors together. Can you even imagine? The gall, you know? And during the Tournament he threw away his chances at winning, because he felt the need to save all four captives instead of just his own, when they weren’t even in any harm to start with. Who does that? He’s as arrogant as they get and he just can’t let an opportunity slip to show everyone how incredibly noble he is.’
, but you don’t hear me –’
‘Pick it up later? And do what? We’ve searched everywhere!’
Draco snorted. ‘Great… Permission to kill.’
Pomfrey all but rolled her eyes at him. ‘Just wait a moment, foolish boy, I’ll get you another sling.’
Madame Pomfrey hurried towards them. ‘What’s going on here? There’s no need to shout! Mister Potter, it is not visiting hours, I must ask you to leave.’
Draco would’ve liked a picture of the stunned look on Harry’s face.
His father pushed him along, away from the march, and sulking, Draco took off.
Draco almost spat out his tea, not even because of the old-fashioned word, but just the general idea of Draco Malfoy trying to
‘Don’t be a fool. I will make fun of you regardless. Show me the recipe.’
‘Episkey,’ Draco mumbled, pointing at his throbbing nose.
Draco lifted his eyebrows. At last Harry had actually come to ask Draco, like he had hoped so long ago.
‘HARRY POTTER!’ Professor McGonagall was running toward them. ‘Never – in all my time at Hogwarts –’ Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, ‘– how dare you – might have broken your neck –’
Delighted, Draco pretended to faint in terror again. And again and again. Glancing at the Gryffindor table he saw every Weasley watching him with a dark look on their faces, and even Potter sneaked a peek over his shoulder at him.
Blaise Zabini jumped on a table, pretending to be a choir conductor while stomping his feet as if he was soldiering on with the boy scouts. ‘‘
Pansy flung her arms around his neck and slapped his head a few times. ‘I’m proud of you, stupid tosser. You actually did it.’
‘This is perfect,’ said Harry, slouching against the table to gaze at the decorations. Suddenly, the worried frown reappeared. ‘Do you think I’ll get into trouble for not turning up?’
Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge, High Inquisitor.’
‘Just get me a book on Parseltongue! I hate you, Potter!’
Draco huffed and crossed his arms. ‘Well, I won’t be.’
.’ Harry nodded angrily at Draco’s arm. ‘Why are you trying to get Hagrid sacked? Buckbeak didn’t harm anyone before you came along. You shouldn’t have insulted him. If you didn’t talk every minute of every day, you would have heard Hagrid tell us you shouldn’t insult them.’
‘What?’ Pansy took a look too and Draco watched her eyes go big. She managed to muffle her laughter, dashing out again and almost stumbling over Nimbostratus.
‘What are you doing, Potter?’ said Snape, as coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four students.
is he part Bonnacon, or what?’ Draco swore a bit more as he used a quick drying spell, threw on his robes and grabbed the Hand of Glory. He whistled for Crabbe and Goyle’s attention and ordered them to keep everyone inside.
‘Though if his grades don’t pick up that may indeed be all he is fit for – ’
Draco shook the man’s hand. ‘How do you do, Mr. Yaxley.’
‘What an excellent strategy, Malfoy. Fight – flight – or
to snogging somewhere horribly romantic. It was not a likely scenario – not for a Malfoy in general and not for Draco Malfoy in particular.
‘Don’t say “god,” Draco, it’s hurtful.’
Waist-deep in the water, Potter stopped. The people at the stands started laughing, and Draco clenched his fists, swearing under his breath. ‘He’s a dead man.
‘Ah, don’t worry about it, mate, the whole story was yanked wildly out of context. I don’t even own winklepickers.’
‘Ah, no…’
‘Wait, Draco, why are you–?’
‘You know how much I love Potions, right, sir? It is my favourite subject, you see. My father–’
Harry grabbed the wireless and shook it. ‘Who are
Draco panicked seeing his own blood gushing from his arm. He’d never seen real blood in his life. He tried not to look at the wound, but couldn’t stop himself from wanting to find out how bad it was. It looked really bad.
Instantly, the Muggle slipped, as if the grass was made of ice or soap. He tried getting up, but kept slipping, and Draco laughed scathingly.
Harry folded, admitting in a mumble: ‘
‘Sure, babe, with what?’
Startled, Harry looked away.
Snape and Lockhart moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Draco caught Snape’s eye just when they reached Harry Potter. A malicious glimmer lit up in the professor’s eyes.
‘Ah yes…’ Closing his eyes in embarrassment, Harry nuzzled Draco’s nose. ‘I did.’
Draco glanced over his shoulder and quickly forced his head forwards again. The huge silver stag that had attacked him in third year had erupted from the end of Potter’s wand. It cantered the length of the Great Hall, and all of the examiners and students watched in awe. Draco could have dropped dead and nobody would have noticed.
‘Well,’ Draco drawled, ignoring the hands on his skin or the skin under his hands, ‘we’re just gonna have to see more matches then.’
Finally, Potter’s eyes fixed on Draco’s, mirroring the cold rage that Draco had been feeling for weeks. He let go of Weasley, and, as Draco’s heart skipped a beat, the two Gryffindors sprinted towards him.
‘Sir,’ Draco called, ‘sir, I’ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm –’
‘Noticed you weren’t at lunch.’
‘You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,’ Snape began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word – Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. ‘Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?’
‘Yes yes, my dear. Draco?’
‘Stupid idiot,’ Draco grumbled through gritted teeth.
‘Just play Exploding Snap with us,’ Gregory whined, putting the box on the coffee table they were sitting around. ‘We don’t want to follow stupid Potter anymore.’
‘Well, if you’re offering…’
Three people raised their hands: Warrington, Harper and the teeny-tiny first-year girl who had held Draco's sleeve on the first day of school. Snape ordered them to follow him to his office, and as soon as the wall closed behind them, the common room exploded again.
‘I don’t think any of it is true,’ hissed Stanley.
After almost two hours, Draco had to admit defeat. He’d played three rounds and he’d lost all three. He’d almost won the second one, though.
The office was waiting.
Treasuring the imagine of Potter pinned to Lockhart’s side, Draco slid back into the crowd.
‘Bargain.’
Pansy gasped. ‘St. Mungo’s! Oh dear!’
Anger and resentment had always been Draco’s best drivers, so he gathered he should embrace the feeling. Maybe if he got annoyed enough, it would drown out the hurt and embarrassment he felt. And maybe if he declared his hatred loud enough, everyone would forget how embarrassingly he’d swooned all over The Boy Who Lived – everyone including himself.
harm's way.’
‘Mister Malfoy!’ Professor McGonagall, in a tartan dressing gown and a hair net, was looking down at him.
‘It makes me wonder, Draco, did we not make ourselves
Harry tried to catch his arms. ‘I
‘My father – ’
The bell of Madam Malkin’s shop clanged on their way out. Draco felt like throwing something after them, but at that moment one of the shop assistants took him to the back of the shop, where he was put on a footstool.  She wanted to slip a robe over his head, but Draco quickly stopped her.
Before Draco could finish getting dressed, she got back with her supplies.
,’ Draco drawled, smirking with malicious glee. ‘Sort of proves my point, though, doesn’t it? Weasel, put those garlands a little more to the left.’ As Weasley dropped the garland in anger, Draco smugly put an arm around Pansy. ‘These house-elves are rubbish!’
Draco closed the book with a slam. ‘Uncle Barnaby,’ he hissed, feeling his cheeks burn, ‘no!’
‘The Boy Who Fainted!’ he concluded, before doing a dramatic impression of a swooning fit. The entire table roared with laughter.
Ten black-and-white photographs filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards’ faces and the tenth, a witch’s. ‘MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN,’ the headline read. A few of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.
. . .
‘There was a giant snake too and – guess what?’
‘I thought the box was locked. I wasn’t paying attention, I’m sorry.’
,’ he whinged, ‘
Draco nudged Crabbe with his wand, so he gloomily showed him the ‘P’ in the corner of their essay.
The boy was laughing at him now, but for once, Draco didn’t mind. It wasn’t a mean laugh anyway.
‘Right…’ Harry put his hands in his pocket, and turned to leave. Looking over his shoulder, his magnificent eyes swept over Draco from head to toe. ‘See you around, Malfoy.’
Draco gaped at him. He had no idea what that meant.
‘Do not underestimate me,’ Mother hissed. She was wearing her Medusa look and reaching for her wand.
‘No, thank you, madam. I just came to pick up something against… thoughts.’
‘Potter did an interview,’ she said. ‘Luna got me a copy. It’s her dad’s magazine.’
‘Where’s Hagrid?’ Potter asked.
‘Did you see Krum do a kickflip?’ said Longbottom’s dumb voice.
‘Realistic? You think it’s possible someone actually feels that? Naturally?’
‘I’ll see you around, Dra,’ said Harry. ‘Thank you.’
in the best dress robes ever made.’
us to do the things we did. We betrayed him.’
During lunch, the fourth-year Slytherin girls were having the giggles over the latest copy of Witches Weekly. Usually, Draco would have been all over them, too curious to let it go, but today he wasn’t in the mood.
Draco stepped backwards. ‘C’mon,’ he muttered.
She shrieked with laughter. ‘He’s stuck in a toilet on the fourth floor! He’s talking gibberish, you should’ve seen him, it looks –’
She frowned for a second to remember the song, then started:
‘Tower to E7,’ Nott said without missing a beat and Draco’s king got brutally slammed from the board. Draco flinched, looking over the game in bewilderment.
Draco grinned at his friends. They sniggered and started shouting too. The racket they made felt liberating after sitting in classrooms for hours.
With an excited whoop, Draco jumped up to inspect it. Nott’s entire mouth was gone. ‘Oy, that’s an improvement!’ Draco grinned while the boys guffawed. ‘How’d you do that, Zabini?’
Harry turned on his heel. ‘Fine, I’ll come back–’
‘Fine! I’ll allow you to leave,’ boomed Draco, ‘for the price of one dog!’
when the training started.
Draco stared his Professor dead in the eye. ‘No,’ he said emphatically.
Draco was relieved to see them. On his order, Pansy’d brought him some of his books, and all afternoon, he’d been reading about his injury and gotten increasingly more worried. The situation could have ended far worse if he hadn’t been healed immediately, and still, with poor aftercare, he could end up with a
‘Are you alright?’ Harry touched Draco’s chin, and nodded at the pile of books Draco had been devouring lately. ‘Did you sleep at all?’
‘There is this boy in my house…’ Draco’s voice trailed off as he wondered how to continue.
‘Sit down for a moment.’ His father pointed at the chair opposite him.
A cold wind blew through the classroom when a large, cloaked figure rose into the air.
‘I do. We will get her back soon, my heartbeat.’
‘How can all the Weasleys have caught the train except for one?’
Draco cried out in triumph.
‘Good morning, ma’am,’ Harry greeted the old lady. ‘I'm Auror Potter. Can I ask you something?’
‘Who?’ Pansy had the audacity to ask.
‘Harry.’
‘Harry, for Merlin’s sake!’ Draco couldn’t sit anymore and jumped up to pace the tiny space. ‘You are the
with me.’ Draco tried to leave the subject, but the words kept coming. ‘Honestly, I don’t understand what he expected. I was bleeding on the ground from his assault. My blood was literally on his filthy hands. What did he think? That I’d jump in his arms to elope on the spot?’
His father smirked, still looking at Draco with calculating eyes. ‘Pathetic,’ he agreed. ‘What about his desires?’
Horrified, Harry looked around. ‘You – ’ He burst out laughing, losing his concentration as he tried to hit Draco.
SPLATTER!
Harry smiled as he caught him. ‘Steady on… You should heed Mayor Trewlove’s advice, Draco. Keep your feet on the ground.’
do, but I refuse to read everyone's boring owl post every day. It's not exactly–’
Barney shrugged pseudo-carelessly. ‘Well, it might come as news to you, young man, but generally people – and when I say “people” that includes ghosts, shockingly – well, they do not appreciate being screamed at. Even when you want them to – ah, how did you put it? Oh, I remember –
Draco couldn’t make out the rest of their argument. He was straining his ears, when Potter loudly said, ‘Don’t start crying again.’
‘No, I’m not!’
There’d been a few glances from Zabini between Draco and Pansy, but none of the Slytherins had made any mentions about what happened on the morning after the party. It had been established – or at least widely accepted as the truth – that Draco and Pansy were an item now, although the only thing either of them did differently than before was call each other “boyfriend” and “girlfriend” ironically.
Longbottom whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. ‘Take him up to the hospital wing,’ Snape spat at some poor Gryffindor. Then he rounded on Harry. ‘You – Potter – why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.’
With a jerk of his chin, Draco beckoned him over in his most defiant way. Potter told his friends to keep walking, and as soon as they turned away, Draco jumped closer to seize his hand and yank him behind a tapestry into a hidden passageway. Once out of sight, Harry took over. Pressing Draco against the wall, he shoved his hands under Draco’s shirt and nuzzled his neck. ‘Hey Dra,’ he breathed with a smile in his voice.
Draco was slowly blowing smoke up at the ceiling, sitting with a foot up his chair and his cigarette-holding arm leaning on his knee. ‘I am staying out of it.’
Groaning softly, he opened his eyes. The light came from the common room window, the sun’s reflection dancing through the lake. He was on the couch, with Blaise Zabini draped over his lap. Zabini's head dangled on the edge of the couch, his arms were around Draco’s waist. On the floor next to them was a pool of vomit, smelling so heavily it made Draco feel sick.
‘Oh Merlin,’ he squealed, quickly putting down the cup before he dropped it to run his hands through his hair. 'Everyone was right.' He was just like Rotilda – like the Weasley girl! ‘How humiliating...’
‘Yes, you. I want to practice a new spell. Do you want to see it? Oh, silly me, of course you do!’
Malfoy shrugged. ‘It’s Brookley's local news station. Why? The frequency’s a bit of a public secret, do you want it?’
Draco was casually slamming cupboards. ‘You shouldn’t believe everything you hear, Potter. I made that one up. The interview won’t be about anything in particular. Listeners send me their questions in envelopes labelled “Interview” and I can’t read them until we’re live. That way the conversation will be as genuine as possible.’
Draco was disappointed. After the way his father had talked about the Unforgivable Curses, his hands were itching to try them. Knowing he had to really mean it, he already knew the perfect victim for his first Cruciatus Curse. Draco couldn’t wait to restore the balance in that fragment of his life.
. . .
Draco did not feel like discussing getting beat by Potter at Quidditch. It was a slippery slope to a fight about fair play.
‘Oh, he cares,’ said Tracey passionately and shouted louder.
Potter burst out laughing, he didn’t even hide it. It made Draco smile and try a little harder. ‘Or maybe you want to ask Trelawny? The inner eye sees all, after all.’
Zabini shrugged and helped himself to some orange juice. Tracey leaned over the table to shout at Pucey. ‘Adrian, darling, be a doll and ask your Gryffindor connection what’s going on! Adrian! Stop polishing that broom for one minute! Look around for once, love!’
The boy’s mouth fell open and he burst out laughing. He seriously burst out laughing – at something Draco said so offhandedly.
Draco was shaking his head with a little sigh. ‘Ah yes, my aunt… She was a handful.’ Harry snorted at the understatement. ‘You know, she liked to set Nagini on me just to watch me run,’ Draco mused. ‘At one point, my parents guarded me around the clock to keep her in check, even though it got them tortured themselves for neglecting their duties.’
‘At four in the afternoon, in the middle of Diana Drive, a Muggle was,
‘I ought to pay you for this,’ drawled Draco, and she clunked him on the head with it, almost giving him a concussion. ‘Ouch!’
‘Attaboy,’ Flint grumbled, slamming Draco’s painful arm before storming off.
‘Girl, your tights,’ Draco snarled through gritted teeth, because Pansy was wearing the sheer tights with bats on them that Draco loved so much, but she still didn’t budge. He sighed in defeat, closing his eyes in frustration. ‘Well… what shade?’
He wondered if Potter was awake.
With his eyes fixed on the stone tiles of the floor, he didn’t notice the group of students lulling around by the doors to the Great Hall.
Smirking, Draco sneered, ‘Why would you even lie about that? You have always worn that stuff.’
‘Montague,’ groaned Warrington. ‘Where’s Montague?’
Automatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore.
Draco scowled at her. ‘Right... Tracey thinks Potter is dating Chang to make
After Draco’d practiced his scales, as well as a composition by his great aunt Tiffany Malfoy III, he reckoned he’d practiced long enough to convince his dad he forgot Barney. He sauntered out of the library, then ran upstairs to the attic as fast as he could.
Pansy took the magazine and put it away with a stealthy look on Professor Vector, arriving at the classroom. Draco felt numb.
‘Shut up, Pansy! I hardly know the guy! Why in Merlin’s name would you think – ?’
Harry snorted. ‘Prick.’
‘You’re joking, Weasley!’ Draco shouted, swaggering up to them. ‘You’re not telling me someone’s asked
asked, but Draco generally wore people out, so they treasured the time Draco wasn’t talking to them, and they specifically never pressed the matter after he started a rant about the renown of the Yule Ball in contrast with the Malfoy standard. Half the time, Draco himself didn’t even know what he was talking about. Scaring people off came naturally to him.
The crowd gasped when the snake slumped to the floor, its eyes hooked on Harry like it awaited his further instructions.
Perhaps his mind drifted off for a moment when he was deciding on a wine to buy for Hermione, but he forgot where it drifted to. It didn’t matter anyway. He was simply scattered, because of the case.
He tried to look at her, but it hurt too much.
‘Chin…’ muttered the wife, touching her own chin. ‘It could be… Well, I never – Do you really –? Oh, I’m not sure, Bert.’
‘Slytherin score!’ came Jordan’s voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below, ‘bad luck, Weasley.’
‘I see why they call you The Chosen One!’ He grabbed Harry’s hands between his. ‘Ohh, you’re worth your money already.’
‘Draco…’ Pansy’s voice broke. She pulled him close, shaking from crying. ‘You stupid sod.’
‘What’s going on?’ Draco asked apprehensively, sitting on the edge of his chair. Visions of snakes and skulls, frantic crowds disapparating in a frenzy and the fearful faces of his parents crowded his mind’s eye. He didn’t know what to expect next.
Blissfully, Harry cupped Draco's jaw and smiled against his lips. ‘Fireworks…’
‘Yes!’ Harry moaned. ‘I wish I flew like that.’
He didn’t understand how someone could look so downcast for having an entire world to discover.
Harry jumped up. ‘No. No, I don’t, I just… remembered something. I left my – my book…’
‘You, Draco, are Sebastian and Charlotte combined. Merlin, my worst nightmare...’ With a huff, Nott yanked at Draco's arm again and went back to fixing his button like nothing happened. Draco blinked at him, baffled. The afternoon sun reflected on Nott’s hair like a halo.
‘Draco,’ said Zabini, looking like he was having a terrible migraine. He moved to lean his hand next to Draco’s face against the wall, cornering him entirely now.
‘Potter,’ he grumbled, accidentally crumpling the paper in his fist, as the whole of the Great Hall leaned forward to watch another seven owls landing amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.
‘With leggings?’
‘Mine then.’ Pansy shrugged, then got to her feet, slapping the grass off her skirt and making Nimbostratus meow loudly in protest. ‘Daddy?! DADDY!’
‘Ah,’ said Pomfrey with a strange expression on her face. ‘Right. Well, I’ll get you my books for you. I promise you can trust those too.’
‘Hers too,’ ordered Umbridge, and Bulstrode wrestled the wand from Granger too.
Harry fell quiet.
It wasn’t the answer he’d expected or meant to get.
Silence her,’ said Umbridge, ‘and anyone else you can find on this floor. Draco, Millicent, you two come with me.’
Being part of the Inquisitorial Squad turned out to be more of a chore than anything else. It was all fun and games to freely punish people, but all the other stuff that came with it just brought him down. It got infinitely worse when the Weasley twins decided to leave Hogwarts with a literal bang and blew up a bucketload of fireworks while inviting the entire student body to follow their example and wreak havoc. The school obliged and Draco and his friends were forced to clean up after them. As if Draco wasn’t wildly overqualified to be an unpaid janitor.
‘Prat,’ added the second.
‘I did,’ Draco said coldly, still looking away. ‘I just stopped after you left me to rot on that tower.’
His mother shot him a look that Draco did not miss, and his father smirked.
Draco wished he had a mask too. If he had, he could have joined the fun without being seen. Maybe he could ask one for his birthday.
Later that day, they had another one of their silly, purely theoretical Defence Against The Dark Arts lessons. The Slytherins pretended to read their textbooks while they drew comics, painted their nails, composed songs, plucked their eyebrows, wrote letters or did their homework for other lessons. Afterwards, Umbridge asked Draco and Pansy to stay behind.
At first Draco’s screams were more out of happiness and bottled up love than anything, but soon enough he started thinking about all the troubles the two of them faced. The tournament, the suffocating Gryffindors, the mutual hatred between Draco’s family and Harry’s friends and the way everyone was trying to keep them apart. In the end, it was hard to say whose screams were the most heartfelt.
‘Suit yourself,’ said Harry. ‘Well, I’ll er… I’ll be going then. Good luck on your show. Oh… you left the button on again.’
‘What? It’s just, you have the same –’
‘What?’
‘The injustice is glaring!’
With a flick of his wand, Harry turned off the wireless. He couldn't breathe.
you! I mean, I knew Hogwarts-Malfoy, the huge dirtbag! Who bloody hated me and tried to
‘I’ve grandchildren older than him.’
Pansy grumbled, ‘You may…’
Draco blinked in the dark and could vaguely spot the see-through outline of his Uncle Barney. He groaned, pulling his pillow over his head. ‘
‘All right,’ said Draco sulkily.
Draco tried to get out from underneath the Invisibility Cloak, but it was intricately wrapped around the two of them. It pissed him off more every second. ‘
Harry gasped. ‘I knew it! There
‘Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,’ sneered Draco.
‘“Sorry about that”?’ Harry didn’t step so much as fall down the few steps that lead up to his door. ‘You banished me.’
Crabbe and Goyle had succeeded in pushing Wood away.
Two pairs of eyebrows shot up in unison, before Prescott and Hanley shared a look. ‘Well, we haven’t been fully briefed,’ Hanley said pompously.
They were holding onto each other to stay upright as they stumbled upstairs, where three small rooms awaited. One of them carried a queen-sized bed, the other a sink, a mirror cabinet and a shower. The third room had a small single bed, surrounded by a wardrobe running all along the wall. The doors couldn’t fully open, with the bed blocking most of the room. Harry had plenty of questions about that, but he was too drunk and tired to ask.
‘Idiots,’ he growled at Vincent and Gregory as they watched Potter walk past in the East Wing, getting foul looks from nearly everyone. ‘If he did this on purpose, wouldn’t he be boasting about how he managed to do it? I would! As if he could have tricked Dumbledore. They’re always claiming he’s the most powerful wizard of our time, and now they all expect fourteen-year old Potter to have hoodwinked him? It’s ridiculous. They're all ridiculous, always have been.’
The desk chair was slowly revolving on the spot as Draco rotated out of Harry’s view, the microphone floating along with him.
’ – he could only say the name through gritted teeth, turning red with suppressed anger – ‘would destroy every comfort of our lives.’
‘Oh, I am losing my patience,’ said Draco, yielding him a hostile reaction once more.
‘Yes…’ The wife frowned. ‘Well, now that you mention it… It could be. Yes… You know, I wouldn’t be surprised, Bert, if that’s Andy. Actually, I’m pretty sure it is Andy, Bert.’
‘Harry!’ said Percy loudly. ‘For the hundredth time: no magic in the corridors. I’ll have to report this again!’
‘However,’ said Bagman. ‘Mr. Potter’s score is forty-five points.’
Panting, he leaned against the wall next to the attic door. This better be worth it, he thought, and he wondered why he even bothered trying so hard: Potter could forget about him and stop writing any moment. Then, he shook his head. He did this because he was bored, he reminded himself. There was nothing more to it than that, just plain, old, casual boredom.
Draco clenched the blanket even tighter, pressing his eyes firmly closed.
‘You became Death Eaters,’ said Draco helpfully.
The dog had been barking the entire time, so Draco conjured a sausage and bacon from the barbecue to appease him, but it didn’t work as well as he’d hoped. He tried to Obliviate the dog’s memory, grabbed its collar and made his way back through the forest in a conjured cloud of smoke. For good measure, Draco pointed his wand at the ground a few times to create a few empty explosions. The dog seemed dizzy.
Harry Potter was staring into space with a sullen expression. His friends were standing with their backs towards each other, like they were having a fight. Draco frowned.
Draco let out a short laugh, looking the boy derisively up and down. ‘Of course you are –’ He picked up the Gnat Heads to lay them on the potion’s surface ‘– two-comma kid…’
Snape stared at him. ‘Put that wand away at once. Ten points from Gryff–’ He looked up.
‘I didn’t do anything,’ Draco wailed. ‘We’ve ignored them for weeks.’
Draco slammed him away. ‘
In all of these, Harry got a small update on his own life. ‘Now, for an update on our local Auror Department,’ they all started. Harry had taken to grabbing his quill whenever he heard it, as nine out of ten times it would be followed by a word he had never heard before.
Draco crossed his arms. ‘I am a Malfoy. That hag has no power over me. I never agreed to more chores, I’m already a prefect, you know.’
As he moved in and out of the living room, the kitchen, the house, Harry caught bits and pieces of Draco’s wireless show. His name was mentioned a lot, interspersed with Amazing, Athletic, Astounding, Adorable, Angelic… When Draco said Harry had looked
‘Tripped over a tree root,’ he said angrily, getting to his feet again.
Draco sneered, ‘You fight with everyone you meet, you bastard.’ He sat down in an elaborate way, like a cat finding a good spot. ‘Only difference is they all bend over backwards to please you, and I don’t.’
A wave of heartache got stuck in his throat. He swallowed a sob.
The hat took a long time to ponder over which house Potter was best suited for.
‘Unfortunately, that concludes our evening special for tonight, here on News Treat Live From New Street. Sleep well and don’t forget to enjoy the little moments. Look after one another.’
‘I am
‘It is not for you to set conditions,’ said Professor Umbridge harshly.
attic.’
‘You know, she still thinks we are engaged.’
‘Your what?’ stammered Zabini.
‘Give me the tickets.’ He snatched them from his mother and indeed, Draco and his parents were at the second row, not the first. Draco had assumed the first row was reserved for the most important Ministry officials – he had definitely not expected any Weasley scum.
‘Hop along, now,’ said his father, ‘tell your friends.’
Back in the common room, Zabini hailed them jovially and told them they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration. ‘Do you want to sponsor with a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some Superior Red –’
‘You have told me this at least a dozen times already,’ said his father with a quelling look. ‘And I would remind you that it is not – prudent – to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear – Ah, Mr. Borgin.’
He knew that he was not the only one lying awake – he could hear Crabbe tossing and turning – but none of the others in the dormitory spoke, and finally, one by one, they fell asleep.
Draco knew to forge the iron when it was hot, and seeing the glint in his father’s eyes, he knew for certain the iron was hot.
It felt like the room crashed down on Draco. He pulled a straight face while the panic rose in his chest.
‘Suffer from brain damage?' Draco snapped back. 'You can’t even keep track of all your siblings, there’s
Fifteen minutes later, Snape arranged his essays and got up. Summoning a ladle, he fished the ring out of the potion and Draco sat up straight in anticipation. When Snape closed his fingers around the ring, a satisfied smirk crossed his face.
He allowed his fingers to touch Harry’s neck, running along his skin under the tufts of his marvellous magical hair. It wasn’t crackling now, but there was still a faint rustle coming from it. Carefully, Draco touched it, half expecting to get a shock, but nothing like that happened; Harry’s hair felt like any other, ordinary hair.
‘You should change the password,’ Potter grumbled.
Inside the office were Professor Snape and Harry Potter, facing each other with Snape’s desk between them. On top of the desk was a stone basin filled with silvery lights.
‘Finish him off!’ said Lupin.
‘Your friends will be up and back in their dorms in less than an hour,’ Pomfrey assured him. ‘And if I know
The sounds the four of them made were inhuman.
Draco wasn’t certain if he should be ducking away from Potter or if the boy was about to laugh. To make certain it wouldn’t be the first, Draco concentrated on remembering what he’d learned. Feeling slightly ridiculous, he started making the hissing noises the book taught him.
Draco frowned at the Quartz, which had taken over the blood red colour. ‘What did you do to my heirloom? I think it’s broken… Unwanted feelings are not supposed to look… pretty.’
They were all laughing their heads off.
‘What?’ Harry said.
‘I contribute!’ Harry scoffed. ‘I’m trying to get rid of the suspicious activity here. It’s Brookley’s citizens who don’t contribute to me!’
Harry didn't feel like explaining the functions of his expensive wizarding wireless, which found every and any station regardless of the frequency's secrecy, as long as someone said Harry's name.
Draco hugged himself, staring at the floor. ‘I think they’re killing Harry’s godfather,’ he blurted out, ‘just because he loves him.’ Ooh, he shouldn’t have said that. ‘
‘Excuse me, miss,’ said Harry dismissively as he charged on, but his path to the back door got blocked by Anita Rose, from The Taylor’s Taylor.
Draco’s mother smiled. ‘Exactly. You deserve a lovingly accepting friend, Draco. Like that spirited Parkinson girl!’
‘Now, you see, Draco, your mother and I cannot help but fear that you have fallen into an – ah – association which everyone near you must oppose.’
‘Tell me everything,’ Draco cut in, as he threw some books aside to sit down on a surprisingly comfortable rocking chair.
Draco’s mind kept replaying the scene over and over, as vividly as if Potter’s voice echoed through the corridors.
Lupin nodded compassionately. ‘He was… Next time, keep in mind that it’s not real. Focus on the funny image. What idea did you prepare?’
‘I’m not going. I hate people.’
When he got a surprising lack of retort to that, he whirled around to show his baffled nemesis a theatrical wink, and with his hands in his pocket he made his way to the Slytherin Common Room, whistling a tune of the Weird Sister’s latest album and feeling very proud for a change. Somehow, he’d managed to get The Boy Who Lived hooked on his search! Now, he could just lay back and wait.
Draco sniggered. ‘Not sleep here, silly… amzyust… gazzern streng.’
‘I’m not going with him,’ squeaked Longbottom and even Granger shuffled behind Hagrid.
Pansy seemed to choose her words carefully. ‘And that won’t involve Harry Potter?’
have a
‘Hardly,’ sneered Draco’s father. ‘You can go back to your own business, Barney, we have no need for you here.’
‘Wrong!’ Barney shouted, laughing manically. ‘We would buy them! Fully legal! Or we would receive them as gifts. You see, we were great friends with the wealthy and powerful Muggles. Obviously, we would never consider the poor sods equals – Merlin forbid, can you imagine that – and it would never in a million years occur to us to associate ourselves with any of the lower class Muggles – there was simply no reason – but we did very much benefit from our relationships with high Muggle society. In fact, one of your ancestors, whom I shall not call by name, had a lovely relationship to Maria Gunning, who was unanimously considered the most beautiful Muggle of the 16
