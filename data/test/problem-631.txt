She goes in, he follows.  What else is he going to do?  He doesn't have his wand and the place is swarming with Harry's sycophantic followers.  He'd never developed the talent to just wish himself away, though he'd long tried.
"So, we must sing for the Queen," Snape broke through his shadowed thoughts.  "Any ideas?  Though I am sure you will be shocked at this, I'm not much of a vocal talent."  He was perched on a log they'd levitated into the clearing since they couldn't seem to Transfigure anything here.  Snape suggested the magic of the place was already too chaotic, and such spells couldn't find the true form of an item to transform it.  So, they sat on rocks and slept on the ground.  Harry didn't mind too much.
"Yes, I'm sorry, but I have to go. You, outside of here, you need me. I need to go." He squatted down next to the small boy once again and offered a reassuring smile. "Just remember, I'm always by your side."
Harry chuckled and Draco soon followed. It was such a good feeling, to laugh with someone, that it caught him off guard. He dabbed at the corners of his mouth with his napkin, immediately aware of the comfort he felt in Harry's presence.
Harry's slit eyes rounded, and he quickly shook his head.  "People… I don't like people to touch me," he dropped his gaze, "but you, that's… good.  I like it when you touch me."
"Great," Harry ground out, "we have to break a secret code created by Hermione.  One that not even Voldemort or his minions could break."  He sat down in a huff.  "Good luck to us."
Luna smiles at the sound of her name on Pansy's lips.  It's just a breath, but the weight of it carries the significance of a sonnet, like her gazes, the rare smiles she would pass to Luna late nights at the newspaper setting up type-printing and sizing photographs.
It seemed fair.  Harry quickly tried to rifle through the pros and cons (mainly owing Draco) of this situation but the vow was so vague and he seemed to have an out for any request too nasty, so he decided to complete the spell.  How could he not if this was his one chance to help Hermione?  Didn't he owe it to her to do anything in his power?  He lifted his own wand and touched the tip to Draco's as a small burst of crimson flame tickled the joined ends.  "I do so agree."  And then as an afterthought, "so long as Hermione's life is returned to normal, I do so owe Draco Malfoy."  A small puff of blue smoke replaced that of the crimson flame and the minor vow was complete.
"I just want you to remember that if this works, and you do become their new master, well I just want you to remember your dreams and the way he makes you feel.  Remember that love and you won't be brutal."  She stopped speaking and smiled up at him.  Reaching out, she caressed his cheek, warming his cool skin.  "It isn't in you to be brutal."
Someday soon, Draco would throw off his veil of pompous pureblood superiority and race down the streets screaming to the world that he kissed Harry.  Tasted him.
"I remember Ron and Hermione running into the infirmary, yelling and screaming 'You're alive' and 'You destroyed him' and all I wanted to do was fade away." As Harry finished his story, the first telling of it in its entirety, the old sorrow roiled about, but it didn't weigh him down as it had before. He looked up and held those gray and amber eyes and felt he understood these men better. Understood himself better.
"Would you please share a drink with me?" Draco asked, turning on his allure.  He rarely bothered trying anymore, but something about this man just drew him in.  Maybe it was the situation, being out on the run, trying to live up his youth before he'd be tied down by the balls.  Maybe it was the magical flux that wafted off of his object of desire, something Draco has only recently learned to sense.
He was mid-transformation: snout lengthening, appendages twisting, hair sprouting over his entire body. The spell residue had been cleaned off by Draco, but Remus still whinged in anguish.
"What?  Really?  From who?" he asked eagerly, sitting up from his lounged position even as the stem dangled from his slack lips.
"Myself?" Draco asked, his voice high and breathless.  Yes… himself.  He could deal with this if he had to.  He had no idea what this new life before him would entail, but he was alive and that had to amount to something.  Being with Harry, well that would be his burden to bear.  Willingly.
One duck paddled alongside him and then scooted by when Harry twitched a hand.  His skin was deep brown.  His hopes had dried up.
"Another game?" Harry asked, quite hopefully, but not holding his breath.  Draco had already played three games with him, and that seemed to be his limit.
Harry cheered and dashed around, jumping in the air.  Then he leapt into Severus' arms and kissed him soundly, holding him tight.  He took his victories where he could.
Harry resumed his enthusiastic fumbling, one hand now gripping the base of Draco's erection as he swallowed deeper followed by a few shallow sucks of the head as Snape inserted another finger, then another, fucking Harry with them in a steady motion.
, but Draco had what he needed, and he couldn't be arsed to care about the foul fucker who hadn't even tried to save his Harry.
Harry faces the sea spread out beyond to the very edge of the earth.  "When he killed my mother, he split up his soul.  Part of it implanted itself into me."
"But then, I got caught in Potter's ritual and my entire feelings changed.  Lucius wasn't some God sent to deliver us!  Lucius was a man and he was power hungry and he was saying the same things the Dark Lord had, just a little less maniacally.  You see, Lucius had always been a better Slytherin than Tom Riddle.  Lucius was subtle; he was skilled at twisting people to his side.  He'd been enchanting people on a huge scale and that is why so many followed him.
Strong hands, normally sturdy in action, shook as they reached down to cradle the glassy ball between them.  The man suddenly felt whole, complete like nothing he could even comprehend before he discovered the orb.  Looking deep into the swirling mass of colours within, the man lost himself.  Nothing else mattered but the orb and its blaze of power.
Ron gave him a quizzical look, but soon played along.  "Oh, you mean the one that breeds more dark wizards than even Slytherin House?  Or maybe he was shipped here by Parkinson’s dad, just trying to marry her off to someone who could stand the extra pounds she packed on."  He laughed, but it soon died without any real amusement to it.
Talk about a raging subconscious. Remus snorted. Too many days discussing their plans to go to America must have overridden his usual wolfish dreams of chasing rabbits. But if something had to be raging, at least it wasn't his libido. He had no outlet for that, no dream arms to embrace him, only playful licks from dead friends. Sadly, he realised he hadn't dreamed of Tonks in months.
He climbed back up the stairs, taking two at a time, before slipping into his room, clicking the door closed, and leaning up against it with a sag to his shoulders.  This job was going to drive him 'round the bend.
"Can I at least make a fire call?  I can't leave the store unattended," he asked, words tumbling over themselves.
"She wasn't good enough for you.  I hated to see you waste yourself on someone of her… kind," said Lucius, and Draco was shocked he didn't outright say Mudblood.  Perhaps he didn't think he had Draco tamed after all.
"Stop squirming you foul poltergeist."  Snape yanked the rope and the glow intensified.  Peeves pouted, but abandoned his escape attempt.
He struggled to keep his mind focused, on task, and he believed he did an admirable job.  But all he really wanted to do was retreat to his safe place, the quiet haven where he could embrace his orb.
With every muscle pulled taut, he focused, pulled his magic into his hand, and gathered it like a beam of light, a laser of magic flooding into the wand.
All the while, during the short trek from kitchen to living room Draco wondered how Harry could be pregnant.  They were not planning such a thing; sure they'd talked about it, but had decided it wasn't time.  To his knowledge, Harry wasn't taking any of the special potions, and none of the pregnancy charms required for a man to carry a child had been cast upon him.
Remus offered to help and together they'd worked on one pile to break down the spells protecting it.  The clock's ticking added its own percussion to the scratching of quills and muffled irritation.  The pile contained the research and final procedure for the potion that would kill Voldemort.  Harry ground his teeth at their lost time.  They tossed those pages aside and tackled the next set and after another few hours broke the other pile's protection spells.  To Harry's relief, those scrolls covered the Dark Mark and the same Exchange Ritual Harry and Hermione had re-created from scratch.
Draco swirled the goblet, mixing the potion completely, and then handed it to Harry, who took it eagerly.  He stared into the swirling depths as if the truth or his future were held in the twisting fluid.  Then he lifted the goblet to his lips and drank it down in one continuous gulp.
Malfoy nodded and seemed to have divined some answer in his mind.  "Fine.  I'll do this.  I'm not sure how, but I will cure him, and he will tell us how to stop Lucius' curse and I can finally rid myself of this shit."
"Pretty boy or hero boy…?  It is so hard to choose," he chuckled.  The lock on the cage door rattled and then from beyond Rowle called out.
He woke with the afternoon's overpowered sunrays beating on him.  The windows had been glazed to prevent the harsh radiation from cooking the people inside, but Harry enjoyed the heat.  A soft rumble bubbled through his chest; someone was petting him.  He opened an eye and glanced down his body to find Luna sitting on his bed, running her hand down his side as she read a book.
Harry grew stiff in his arms and tried to move away, but Draco held tight.  "It's okay," he said, still petting his husband.  "Just tell me what happened.  From the top."  He let Harry lean back slightly and studied him.  His love's eyes were glistening, and his face was set like the tears were held in by pulling every facial muscle taut.  Draco smiled and kissed him gently, then grabbed Harry’s hand and led him to the sofa.
"Severus," he said happily and engulfed Severus into a hug.  Draco watched as Severus returned the hug, pulled Remus tight into his chest, held onto him like a lifeline.
Harry's eyes zipped around the room: one man by the bar, one woman on the chaise, two others at a table to his left, goblets half full.  He could smell their age, their amusement.  Rosebuds and cinnamon.
Moments passed and suddenly Harry snapped into motion, as if a Petrificus had just been released.  "No—nothing.  Just…."   He brushed his right hand through his hair, looking away.  Draco looked the same direction and saw the giant snake coiled up nearby.  "Snape," Harry called out, apparently not planning on finishing that train of thought.  "Do you know what those Fae did?  I feel…funny."
"Damned idiots, don't give a fuck about their pets," he snarled to himself as he passed two other healers heading the opposite direction towards Prep Room 5 of the Lakemore Magical Beast Health Clinic.
Harry groaned and tried to roll over, but pain spiked through his upper arm at the motion and the odor of the food sure as hell wasn't enough of a temptation for him to put forth the effort to rise.  The smell was terrible, like something found in the bottom of a pig slop that'd had a month of hot sun and humidity to ripen.  It smelled, literally, worse than shit.
In a reflection of Severus and Remus, Draco lifted up Harry's face and gently kissed him.  An intake of air from Harry gave away his shock, but he quickly kissed back, murmuring "Draco, oh Draco," over and over, composing the lyrics of the moment into an eternal melody.  Their mouths trailed over each other's faces, dancing across lips and cheeks, noses and eyelids.  Mapping, tracing, claiming if only for this one night.
"Hello, Potter."  Draco had touched up his eyeliner.  Merlin.  "Were you just in the Prefects' Bath?"
The two men stepped towards him and each dropped down to one knee in supplication.  Yes, this was right.  This was the way things should be.  Draco could feel the power lift and rise in Harry, his dark hair flailing about him in a hurricane of magic, his eyes glowing green with fire and presence.
This man, who clung to Harry as fervently as Harry clung to him, was an unexpected gift.  The clock must have tumbled to Christmas.  Though Harry'd never expected anything good his life again, he now held exactly what he needed.  A companion.  A living, breathing sanctuary who knew his past and still stood by his side.  Draco knew all his sins, and still wanted him.
"No!" Draco cried out, and he wasn't sure if it was to Tufts or the boy, but the boy lunged for the lynx, grabbing at ears anyway.
Finally, his worn body went limp, soft pants rippling through his chest, and as the seconds ticked past slow realization hit him.  Draco no longer sucked at his neck, and he'd just come all over his friend's hand.
He lay there staring up at the ceiling.  A sharp pain in his bladder urged him out of bed.  It'd been the only reason he'd risen over the last three days and he finally noticed his stomach's rumble.  He threw back the covers and caught a whiff of his body odor, stale and sweet, and he could just hear Draco scolding him on poor personal hygiene.  "Harry," he would say, "Though I understand your childhood left you with the social skills of a wild boar, I certainly hope I've had more of a taming influence on you.  Go wash."
"Your scar?  Well that is... ahem… unique."  Professor Slughorn blinked his large eyes.  "Why would he do such a thing?"  He pondered.
So Harry did, slowly, centimeter by centimeter he inched his finger into Draco's hole, all the way to his palm.  It was velvet softness inside, and Harry realized Snape must have cast a spell to empty him out.  So soft, silky, and then Harry pulled out and pressed back in, petting Draco from the inside.
"Hey Hermione!" he said, waving in return.  He waited at the corner and then they continued to walk down the pavement together.
"What? I'm hungry," he mumbled around a mouthful of pastry and cheese. "We missed dinner… and breakfast." After Goyle left and they had informed Mr. Popicon about the orb, they remained up late into the evening devising cunning and convoluted plans both Ron and Draco approved until Harry suggest something simple and practically guaranteed. Draco had pouted and even Ron seemed put out, but they both agreed on a simple scheme to get their traitor to reveal himself. Remus added his subtle touch to the plan, but had to leave that morning to return to Blumgeower Books or risk his job. Plus, someone needed to check in on Hermione, make sure she knew her guardian angels hadn't abandoned her in their crusade for retribution.
This couldn't be happening.  He'd come to the States for a conference for Merlin's sake; a safe, boring conference with other wizards and witches in pressed robes and a penchant for policy and law speak.  He'd gone to dinner with some of his fellows, and in a moment of camaraderie he'd drank too much.  He remembered now, some bloke hit on him and all he could think about was Harry fekking Potter back over the Atlantic.  He had a free pull, but all he could think of was what was waiting for him back home.
Nagini was the third Horcrux they destroyed, with a total of five of the six accounted for.  Using Parseltongue, Harry enticed her away from Voldemort.  It was their most dangerous mission yet, as Nagini rarely strayed far from her Lord and master.  Feeding the giant snake a poisoned cat did not prove difficult, but while she thrashed in throes of pain they worried the poisoning might fail.  They resorted to hacking at her body with the keen blades they were never without; the constant worry that Voldemort would come upon them nagging at their nerves.  Ron suffered a broken arm from the snake's convulsions, but it was a small price to destroy the fifth Horcrux.
"Actually," Draco drawled, "you would be surprised. Magical vampirism is rather prevalent amidst megalomaniacs who only want to increase their own power." He gestured towards Harry, towards his scars, to make a point. "However, the fact that its effect lessens as more people are cursed is definitely unique. I haven't come across that in anything I've researched."
"Well Harry, I think it will help keep out all the bad things… but just to be safe, I am going to leave something here for you… but only for a while." He collected his thoughts and dug into his pocket, pulling out a small figure of a gold dragon. "So I'm leaving this here. If you think you can't hold the wall, just grip this dragon and think real hard about me, okay?"
The slam of the door echoed through the open room and Draco crawled over to Harry, all legs and arms as he kept low to the ground.
The other man snorted.  "Even if you had, Severus and I could not have left without drawing attention to ourselves.  I am guessing that Granger understood that… Though, as I recall that last message, I think she did attempt to warn us in her own way.  We just didn't realise what she was trying to do."  He seemed thoughtful.
First Harry entered, a bright light bursting as he disappeared from the Land of the Fae.  Then Severus went.
"I didn't want to kill anyone," Harry said, looking down into his lap, his legs swaying forward and back.  "I didn't want to kill Voldemort, but something forced my hand.  Whether it was him or Dumbledore… I've never been sure."  He gave a self-depreciating laugh.  "And now I'm a mass murderer.  I've the power to kill without any intention and only in brief moments of frightful clarity do I fucking realize what I've done.  What a cruel fucking thing fate is.  Destiny.  It's all evil.  It's all a load of crap."
That morning Snape knocked and said, "Glad to hear you two made up.  Will you please join me for breakfast?"  Draco's face contorted as he tried to hold in a laugh.
"Yep.  Brings out your eyes." Draco explained as he cast a dewrinkling spell over himself.  A small fairy with a hot iron appeared and smoothed out the rumple marks in his shirt then disappeared with a faint tinkle.
Countless spells later and Draco was admittedly flummoxed.  After spending hours studying it, he'd only discovered that the spell was designed to solely be broken by the caster.  It was smart, it learned and adapted to all of Draco's assaults on it, thus denying him the opportunity to break it down to its basic layout.  This would not be a quick fix.
Hermione bolted from her seat and followed Harry up to the counter.  Without the usual numbers of people Draco could hear most of what they were saying, so he casually studied his drink and intensely listened to what Hermione had to say this time.
Draco throws his napkin on the table, an impotent action, but still Pansy flinches next to him.  Draco turns to storm away, but is stopped short, pulled tight by the Anchor around his neck.
"And you think you have a spell?  To get us back?"  He'd been pressuring Severus to answer him, but the wizard had kept avoiding that discussion.
"I would say 'get a room', but you already have one. Why don't we let you two have a moment and we'll come back later." He noticed they both ignored him and the three men left, chuckling.
Grabbing a whiskey sour he found a tiny table in the back of the club and sat to sip his drink under a hovering blue light.   Not five minutes passed before a hot, tall brunette man stepped within the pale blue glow and smiled.  Harry let his eyes run over the other man's body and felt himself smile back.
Remus found relief in the wastelands, where bare trees were propagating out of the dead earth and his memories of a long gone past blended with the temptation of unrealised desires. He immersed himself into the realm where he could forget about curses and lost chances and look towards a promise of spring rain falling upon the cold land, covering the world in forgetful petals fallen from fresh blooms, where everything remained tranquil in nothingness.
.  Someone was using the spell nearby.  He slowed his steps and moved silently forward around the corner of a hallway, until he stopped near the cracked door of the Potions classroom.
"Remus, I've been thinking..." Harry opened with, as he laid a plate of food before the scrawny man. Remus pulled up a chair and descended upon the meal, glancing up every so often to listen to Harry. "Malfoy and I have been spending so much time deciphering these scrolls we haven't had time to do any footwork. Would you mind helping us with it?"
He didn't know how this woman knew him, and he couldn't for the life of him place her.  Maybe his name and face preceded him, as it often did.   He
"Heh. Weakling wizards." The laughter and slurred words were casually tossed at the men as a walking corpse once known as Scrimgeour stumbled towards the artefact. Harry spared him a glance and icy horror swept over him at the monster the Minister had become.
"So, Malfoy.  Talk."  Harry sat in a chair next to Hermione's bed, holding the witch's hand gently in his own.  Ron scooted his own chair around to face the door, shooting the most scathing glare in Draco's direction.
The three goblins circled together, one of them nodding, the small-nosed one adamantly shaking his head, squeaking rather ferociously.  Was that even language?  The third goblin, one huge batwing ear torn, popped up his head and said, "It's a terribly outdated law, but you do have the right, wizard.  You must present—"
Was Weasley suggesting…?  Then out of the corner of his eye Draco saw something.  It was tiny and bounced upon the air like it was held aloft by spider silk.  It continued down the hallway, passing the suits of armor on its bobbing path.  A black butterfly.  A Hell Butterfly coming to tell Draco something from another world.
For the first time since the face-off in the core, Harry smiled. "Draco, I would appreciate that." He looked exhausted and drained, and Draco knew he was being eaten by guilt as well. The two men Apparated to St. Mungo's to visit their comatose friend.
Ron and Luna would be sickening if they weren't so discreet.  Whenever Harry caught them, they were smoochy and handsy and just plain icky.  But he didn't catch them often, so he thanked the ancients buried under the old hills of Britain for small favors.  He wasn't sure how Hermione felt about it all, but she hadn't attacked Ron with any more birds so Harry guessed she didn't much care.  He'd always wondered what she'd seen in Ron, talk about totally incompatible brains, but one could never explain love, or lust, or any of those hormonal responses.
Draco knew he could easily cancel his forthcoming appointments.  "I'll see what I can do, Weasley.  I have some important clients to meet, and I will need to find them an appropriate referral."
"And as you can see, Miss Garfield—" His wand swished through the air and the teakettle glided into the shape of a grey pigeon. "—it is all in the lower arc of the wand movement.  You must be smooth; stop treating the spell like you're threatening Mr. Artney with a Trelor Hex."  The pigeon strutted across the desk, cooing and pecking at stray bits of parchment.
Harry smiled over at Draco; the smile was incandescent, brilliantly lit by a thousand suns. It caused his heart to ache, tighten in his chest and refuse to beat. A beating heart would mean the passage of time, and Draco didn't want to ever forget this moment.
Sitting at his heavy, antique desk, rolling a Muggle pen back and forth across a piece of clean, white parchment, Draco reflected on Harry's question.  What
Pansy clears her throat and mumbles something that sounds like, "Well, I can agree with that," but nobody stops and stares at her, nor Millicent as she shovels enough food down her throat to sustain a small horse, and Draco can't get his brain around this meal of yams, boring cheese and stale bread.  He misses his clotted cream and fresh croissants.  Fresh fruits.  Flavor.
"At least the spells didn't backfire on me," he said.  Draco knew Harry had exhausted himself, but at least the rotten smell of his leg had disappeared and even if he wasn't completely healed, he wasn't in threat of death any longer.  Most of his superficial wounds scabbed over, and Harry assured him that the internal damage had been patched enough, but his leg still remained twisted and useless.
"Yes, yes.  I know he took out a city block in Toulouse, but he… he's just walking through.  Does he seem a threat to you?"
By the time Potterette returned, half past seven, Draco's nose was buried into another book and Tufts was sitting quietly at his feet.
Luna feels sorry for him as he tries to convince Draco the Pacifist that losing one's eye is not a big deal, and was, in fact, an unexpected gift.
"Trust me," Severus said and his voice was so tender and contained no judgment that Harry simply nodded and remained still as Severus' long fingers began petting his face.  With gentle maneuvers—that less than a year ago Harry would never have attributed to Severus—he removed Harry's clothes, item by item.  First his shirt, then his trousers and pants. Naked, he squirmed under Severus' hungry gaze.
"No… It's just… Nobody else is looking for him.  The man is missing and who knows what might have happened."  He threw his arms up in frustration.  "Plus, he isn't all that bad, Ron."
"I doubt we could tell you anything actual parents couldn't tell you," Hermione said, a little amused.
“I know, Harry.”  Draco’s chest tightened.  “I know.”  He urged Harry to his feet and led him to his bedroom and held him until the shakes gave way to sleep.  Draco stared up at his ceiling, mind shifting over different spells and potions that could heal Harry’s mind.
With his shoulder to the wall, he glanced into the room, the angle only allowing him to see Harry as his friend fell to his knees, eyes wide with shock and… what was that? Fear? Wonder? Draco wasn't quite sure, maybe it was all of those combined. Or maybe it was something more basic and primal.
The night was completely clear and the stars smothered the dark blanket of space.  There was a bite to the air and Draco wore his coat buttoned tight as he strolled to the pub.  Potter sat in the corner looking for someone.  When he saw Draco, he grinned and raised his hand, as if Draco hadn't been looking right at him.  Draco lifted his chin, and then wove through the half-full tables and chairs to join him.
It was only frottage and they even had a layer of cotton separating them, but Draco's blood had never raced like this before.  He knew that this was exactly where he should be, exactly who he should be with, as he whispered out Harry's name in release.
And now he saw something that might bring him that happiness, and he decided he would make his own choices.
Harry shrugs.  Everyone's already heard the story, but Billy is new to the crew.  "He had a good hand," Harry says with a chuckle.  Nobody else says a thing.
Kingsley looked at him as if he hadn't heard the empty greeting, as if something consumed every ounce of his attention. Refusing to meet his gaze, Kingsley's strong strides took him right up to Harry.
Their door swung open.  Snape held his wand aloft, the tip glowing beautiful, soft light.  Harry's eyes were drawn to the light.  Draco burrowed his head into Harry's chest, avoiding the lightening, avoiding the darkness, avoiding the world.
Turning his back to the bed, Harry tugged on his trousers, then his shirt, and without another glance, he left the inn's room for the Floo.
"I don't know.  Yes, I like him.  He… He grows on you, like an ugly van Gogh you walk by every day.  Eventually you forget how contrasting its parts are and just enjoy it for its whole.  And Christine—I will always love her.  But she's gone.  I think it's about time I get busy with life again."
The cute, young mediwitch came in, startling him from his nap, eyes darting to his twin scars instead of lingering there like they had when she first realised who her patient's guest was.  She didn’t bother delivering her flirty smiles and engaging wit anymore after the few short words he'd exchanged with her.  Luckily, she realized a lost cause.
"Malfoy," Harry said.  Startled, Ginny pulled away and stared at Draco, a fierce glint developing in her eye.  Harry grinned at her; she always was a fighter.
"Draco, thank you for meeting me," Harry said, smiling.  He offered his hand to Draco, who looked at it, frowning slightly.  Finally, Harry pulled his hand back, unshaken, and sat down across from Draco at their little table surrounded by mismatching chairs, a completely plebeian touch.  "Kingsley said you could help me out."
"Plincher, any news from your front?" Ron asked in his usual debriefing. He wasn't expecting much and only half listened to his colleague. His mind kept returning to the warehouse and the wizard behind the black-market artefact dealings.
And didn't they?  Harry glances in his direction and catches Draco in mid-stare, and he smiles.  Brighter than he smiled for Hermione.  Draco finds his own lips slipping into an easy grin and beside him he hears, "Oh, yeah.  Now I see how it is."
He rubbed at his lion head scar absently, feeling the rough, hard skin, catching it on the jagged edge of his fingernail.
"Okay then, we will let you go.  But if we find you've lied to us—"  Draco let the threat hang there and the fairy shivered.
"Both of your arms are in stasis because I did end up creating a new Mark."  Harry sighed.  "And I'm sorry for that.  But it needs some time to calm down… I think."
He continued to sit as minutes passed and finally Harry offered him tea.  Remus nodded dumbly.  When the tea was ready, Harry set it down in front of Remus, who took a sip, set the teacup back down and finally cleared his throat.
Draco smiled, accidentally showing some fang.  He looked away with a blush, working to retract his teeth.
Snape now dressed in trousers and short sleeved shirts, his bite scar a pale ridge across his neck and the Dark Mark leered at Harry, but Harry overlooked that tattoo with casual ease.  It meant nothing, not when Snape had loved Harry's mother; not when he took care of both him and Draco.
"Get him to swallow this now.  In ten minutes, give him the black potion and immediately drop three drops of Turgier on his tongue."  Gently he held up Harry's head as he poured the first potion in his mouth, rubbing at his throat to get him to swallow.
, and all you can do is laugh about it.  That is the very reason I can't support you.  You all thrive on violence, and where exactly has that ever gotten any of you?  Eyeless.  So blind no one can tell their arse from a hole in the ground."
"Oh," George said, "Follow me, then."  He did a flourishing bow, and gestured for Draco and Harry to enter the back room.
He knelt beside her, picking up her chilled hand, feeling for a pulse.  It was there, weak, but a testament to her life.
That afternoon Draco crawled out from under the cat, whose black-tipped tail flicked at the disturbance, and retired to the shower down the hall.
"You know," Harry said as he slurped a chocolate shake through a thin straw, "everything we do is a sad little parody of life.  I mean look at people, we go to the office, make love, raise a family, take care of our pets, drink milkshakes… it's not real living."  He looked over at Draco and Draco recognised this as one of those rare moments where Harry's lucidity sparked more clearly than even the sanest man he knew.  Perhaps it wasn't the fact that Harry was insane, but that his brain's scales couldn't keep balanced, that it let escape all of its lunacy in a big bout and then swiftly shifted to the clearest mind until more lunacy built up and tilted the equilibrium all over again.  Draco realized Harry's mind was balanced like a Japanese deer chaser.
"How you been, Draco," he greeted.  Any more familiarity and Draco was certain he would crack, without any preamble or warning, just like his wall had earlier that day.  He placed the pen down on the desk and smiled thinly at his old ally, without sincerity or any hint of camaraderie.
"No, send him in.  But make him wait for a while.  I want to finish some things."  Tyrone nodded, his expressionless face lifting slightly with amusement, and left Draco's office.
"I had plans to attend the symphony, but that can wait.  Is everything okay?  Harry, is the pregnancy going as planned?"
"Severus and I had been working on a potion that affixes onto Voldemort's soul and pulls it all into one place, with the added benefit of destroying it in the process, skipping this whole treasure hunt for his Horcruxes.  With Dumbledore gone, we just don't know where they all are.  We don’t have any more time to waste."  Remus stopped speaking and took another drink, a longer one this time, and sighed as he returned the cup to the tabletop.  He ran his finger over the smooth lip of the cup a few times before continuing.  "Severus had been taking Voldemort's blood under the guise of creating other potions for him.  Voldemort trusts him implicitly since Dumbledore's death, and Severus has had to do some terrible things to keep that trust."
Draco sighed.  "Alright.  I'll Floo Potterette and the mini-Potters and you can all have a lovely afternoon in my home.  Shall I make scones?"  He threw in the Floo Powder with a roll of his eyes.
of someone's hard cock so close to him frayed his nerves.  He resisted the urge to inch apart from Draco, to hide away, and instead gently brushed along Draco's forehead, trailing his fingers through his blond hair until he awoke.
But he had to wait. The plans, all of their intricate devices, had to play themselves out in this macabre parody of his life before he could act. And so he stood there under a dense copse of evergreens and ash, rain drenching the rolling hills torn under the feet of hundreds of wizards and witches. The cold glow of the sun, already hanging low in the sky, was hidden by clouds, casting faint but long shadows of bare branched trees, skeletal in their guise of mortality. It was picture perfect mayhem.
As he walked through the fireplace, he could barely hear Hermione's murmurs over Harry's loud tears.
Her left hand tried to speak but it only came out as a muffled, "Mrun urnn uh!"  She pressed her hands together even harder.
"Please keep the lights off, I don't want you to see me… what I really look like."  Demurely, Lily looked away from Draco's face, trailing his eyes down Draco's front.  Long lashes framed those brilliant eyes.  Again, Draco felt a surge of familiarity.
"You sure about that, Hermione?" CatBoy asked with a wry grin.  "You've recently made one devastating mistake…"
It was Snape, and that shook Harry from head to foot.  He sounded like he cared.  When had Snape ever cared?
That laughter again, and then a hacking cough.  Draco takes a step away.  Once the man steadies himself, he chuckles.  "Terrorists?  That's some Double Speak, 'taint it?  We don't much think that word o' yours fits.  Call a spade a spade, boy."  His eyes shimmer.  "Pirates, we is.  Outlaws, seeking our own form of justice from tyranny."  The weaving stops as the old sailor's zeal rises.  "We sail the Irish Sea, taking what 'tis we want, helping them who cannit help themselves.  We is gunna save this country from people like you."  He jabs Draco in the chest with his fist, still closed around the rope.  Not a punch; not a love tap, either.  Draco brushes the spot, haughty indignation etched in his expression.
"Fuck it," he muttered and leaned forward, embracing Harry in a rough kiss. It was embarrassing, how eager and close he wanted to be to Harry, how even in this moment of death, he could brush it all aside as insignificant when he had Harry in his arms. Between kisses, Draco breathed sweet words over Harry's lips; silent promises that he hoped fervently to keep once they saw the light of day. He never knew his heart could beat this fast.
And the fear grew as Harry began chanting and a robin's egg blue began to emanate from Harry's wand and fog over the man's body.
"Of course," Snape said, and Harry was surprised that he hadn't snapped or sounded annoyed.  Then Snape began to chuckle.
His reprieve hadn't lasted long and soon, without any finesse, he too was educated into the world of dehumanization, torture, and his own personal corner of Hell.
Then the smile broke out, the room seemed less dim, and the two men walked down the hallway together towards Draco's room.
Then everyone gets quiet and without even having to look she knows the Captain and his Captive have just walked in.  Harry's like that bloke Crusoe, and he's found his Friday.  Though Luna thinks they kidnapped Draco on Sunday.  Either way, it's obvious how powerless Harry had been before when she can see his strength now, with his right person by his side.
Sirius would have blown up with indignation for him, he knew.  He tried to do his best to watch out for Remus, even leaving him everything in the will.  But Remus' status as a werewolf disallowed him the honour of inheriting the Black holdings, so they went to Harry.  Harry did what he could to look after Remus too, but the last thing he wanted was to be taken care of by his inherited godson.  Remus could take care of himself.  He always had.
A chime rung through the air and the men looked up at each other, both with matching expressions of delight.  "Our guests have arrived," Remus said, a smile on his lips.
They'd decided that Harry would take the potion, get his crazy brain cured, and then they would contact everyone else.  No need to actually bring everyone in until the cracks were all plastered over.
The older man grew grave and nodded as if to himself.  He rose from his overstuffed chair and crossed the room to a very neat bookcase.  Pulling on a book caused a small 'click' and a hidden compartment was revealed behind the moved volume.
Snape sighed, a long, exasperated sound that almost reminded Harry of the bitter man he'd worked with to defeat Voldemort.
"That is not my job," he said simply, and fucking hell, didn't he wish he had something more glamorous than MMAD.  "This is my job, Potter.  To find people who flagrantly break the law and stop them."
Then something clicked, slid sideways just slightly and Harry could move again and his entire body went limp from the strain; Snape let his hand lose.
They had contacted Ron immediately, of course.  He'd Flooed in from Mexico, petting Hermione's hair with worry in one moment and in the next boiling with righteous anger about how nobody on this end was doing anything about it.  Harry withstood three hours of Ron's berating words for quitting the Auror Program, and when he finally burned himself out, they sat in sorrowful silence together.  But since Ron was knee deep in his mission, and he knew there was nothing he could do, he was forced to return to work, and Harry returned to useless pacing and avoiding attractive young men and curious medical staff.
"Harry!" he cried out, brushing away the purple spit around his mouth.  "Harry!"  This couldn't be happening.  Couldn’t be.  Everything he ever wished for was always ripped away, could the world be truly ruled by something so evil?
Remus nodded and looked away, cataloguing who was watching them as Duncan stood and left the Hook. One man wouldn't take his eyes off Remus. The man's name didn't immediately emerge from his faded memory but Remus did recognize him. A true salesman. Anything for sale to anyone. With a feral glare and a twitch to his lip he stared the man down and then left before anyone else pegged who he was.
"Thanks, Greg.  It's good to see you made it, too."  He smiled at his old friend without any condescension or superiority.  "Cassiopeia is perfect for you."
"Harry.  Good to see you.  Change your mind?  You coming back into the fold?"  Kingsley asked, grinning broadly, leaning across his desk for Harry's hand.
"Oh, for Heaven’s sake.  It’s a bed warmer, Potter.  You stick the Salamander Chip under your bedsheets on cold nights.  Every old wizarding household has them."  He sniffed, almost aghast at Harry’s ignorance.  "New ones are illegal to create, some idiocy about some salamander species disappearing.  Every suite in the Manor had one."  He stared off into space for a while, eyes unfocusing as a strange look Harry might almost akin to thoughtfulness appeared on his face.  It transfixed Harry.  Could Draco be a real person?  Not simply some being sent to test his patience by some trickster god?  "But none of that matters much now, does it.  They’re all gone along with the portraits, the artefacts, the library… the Manor."  Draco turned away and looked out into the night through the frosted window.
Clear, green eyes opened and looked up.  "Draco?"  The word had no strength to it, no backing of that tremendous will he knew Harry had hidden away.
"Oh, now Draco.  Don't think of it as stealing my husband.  Think of him more as my best friend, close roommate.  And truly, you can't steal him because he is already yours."
Remus practically fell through the fireplace and landed on the rug in an unhappy heap, wet robes dripping on the floor.
People die in wars.”  Luna nods at her crewmate and friend.  He'd always been an emotional boy.  “They make us out as criminals."  Spittle flies from his lips and rains down on the paper.  The picture of Draco Malfoy calmly nodding with a bucket of compassion in his eyes flinches at the abuse.  "We are the resistance!  They are in the wrong, not us."
He wished he could be like normal people—take his boyfriend skating, or window watching at Harrods.  Instead, he held a limp body in the dying hours of Christmas Eve.  Maybe, this year, he'd do it.  Watch the sunrise.
Once Draco realized Harry had figured out his secret and hadn't descended into crazed fear or developed a rabid desire to jab a stake through his heart, he'd relaxed and had given up trying to act superior.  Really, he was just a normal, average guy.  Well, as normal as a hereditary vampire could be.
"A charm.  We can communicate."  He looked over at the cat, whose orange eyes were staring right at him, digging their gaze into his heart, his soul.
Snape turned his head towards Harry, and Draco looked up confused.  They both went stiff; Snape's face revealed nothing, but Draco, Harry noticed, looked hopeful.  He wondered if they'd planned this.
Draco was doomed to never feel that freedom; was doomed to never have that kind of escape.  And as happens with all failures, those who can't do, teach.  With all of his expertise acquired on the subject of his failure, he became a foremost expert on Animagi.
"Oh Harry.  My Harry.  I'm so sorry.  So sorry we wasted all that time.  I wanted to be friends back in first year, but I was too stubborn.  Too stuck in my father's world.  I'm sorry we lost so much time."  Tears fell like spring rain.
"I haven't found out anything about countering father's spell."  He hated this feeling of failure.  He hated that he was babbling and that Pansy had but to lean there with her arms crossed and nod once or twice and his verbal drivel continued.
Nothing, nothing but pushy Americans, litter, piles of dog shit, and an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness.  Today was just not his day.
The agents Kingsley had sent contained the last of the underground wizard compound. Kogelmann was carted away, silent yet glaring daggers at Ron and the others. Harry, Draco, and Remus made their excuses after answering the agents' questions and returned to London together.
it. Sorrow brushed his already aching heart as he remembered creating the map with Sirius, James and Peter. Sirius, gone again. All of the hard work, all of the exploration and study and experimentation they'd done. The map was the final brush stroke to the masterpiece of their friendship. First it was their discovery of his lycanthropy. Then they had become animagi. And finally, the map. It should have cemented them together, tighter than any bond, and Remus had thought that it had. How had it gone so wrong?
They sat on the couch together by the crackling fire; two glasses of wine sat on the table as closely as Draco sat next to Harry.  In his childhood, Draco had wondered about love and sacrifice and fairytales.  He only had his mother and father and children's books as teachers.  One contradicted the other.  He'd always loved fairytales.
The cloth hung intact, like pristine lacework, so different from the ratty looking veil held by a similar arch sequestered deep within the Department of Mysteries. It stood solid and mocking, taunting Remus with secrets only it knew and would never share.
Building slowly, like a steam engine gaining speed, Draco felt his body crackle and pull.  Minutes crept by and an eagle called overhead, circling on warm thermals.  He never liked the sensation, it made him feel like he was falling apart, and wasn't that true?  His cells broke down, mutating from flesh to bone to sinew, and it hurt, oh did it ever, but it wasn't a physical pain, it was more innate, something deep within that was destroyed and reformed and made him feel like other than Draco Malfoy.
study Algebra.  Anyway, Hermione used this type of mathematical code in some of her encrypted messages to our spies and other operatives after she developed Equacrology."  Harry listened intently; he knew Hermione developed a new cryptographic code that was used during the war but he didn't know the intricacies of her system.  It never interested him enough for him to ask her about it.  "I only knew about it after we won, if you call a field full of dead friends a win…" Remus growled, then cleared his throat to continue, "because it was so top secret.  Not sure what it means though, but I know it is
"I can only imagine," Snape murmured.  The stew was almost done, and the salads were nicely arranged on three plates.
Sharp images of his mother and father wrapped together as his father drank from her popped into Draco's mind, and now he understood.  While feeding was better than sex… feeding and sex with someone you loved was something incomparable, untouchable by mere mortal standards.  And while this happened so quickly and in the most unexpected circumstances, Harry and Draco's first time together had been special, and Draco would cherish it, hoping and dreaming they had many more moments, days, years ahead of them.
Draco had compared the two letters, refusing to shunt the case off onto a lesser Hit-Wizard.  Both were crafted on readily available white paper made from bleached wood grain.  One had blue ruled lines.  The letters from both notes were cut from a variety of wizarding and Muggle publications.  He noted that in both pieces, the letters that made up Harry Potter were from
Finally, he saw them.  Two lumbering monsters were stalking up the lane towards him, their teeth bared, growling like beasts from the deepest parts of the Romanian wilderness.  Draco's heart skidded and he took a wary step back, digging into his pocket for his wand.
"Good.  Come on."  Draco held out the half-used roll of Muggle masking tape and Tufts walked over and leaned to touch it with his neck.  Seconds passed and as the familiar tug took them away to Bulgaria, Draco realized Tufts hadn't once pined over parting from his wife.
"I'll take the far one, I'm faster than you," Draco whispered with a twist to his lips.  Harry almost chuckled, would have if it weren't for the panic threatening to choke him dead.  They looked at each other, then Draco nodded, and they burst from the corner of the house.
"Draco.  Stop," he said kindly.  "You are not a monster.  You are Draco Malfoy, my friend.  Now, if you drink from me, will it kill me?"
Draco mock pouted.  "Then I can't charge overtime, Potter."  But even as he whined, he examined Potter's face, his tired eyes.  "But sure.  We all need weekends."  With a nod and a smirk to Potter's neighbor, he turned and walked away.
"Yeah, I'm ready.  And what do you mean the first part has plot?  I've seen this movie ten times and I tell you, the plot is all in the last five minutes where everybody dies."
Over his shoulder Draco sees some of the merry gang of the Marauders.  With Terry, Luna, and Laura are Hermione Granger and her pet twit Ron Weasley.  If that wasn't a mismatched pair…
It'd taken him a good forty-five minutes to shake off his tail and Draco ducked into the first bar he came across.  Really, his father had become far too watchful of him since he was released from Azkaban and placed on house arrest, and Draco didn't even want to dwell on the hints and suggestions that he should take a wife and settle down.  He knew the family patiently waited for him to find a wife to bear the next heir, but he wasn't about to just settle for anyone.  Plus, he would have to find a wife who didn't mind him straying on a perpetual basis.  Women just weren't his slice of cake.
"You're his daughter and he's so proud of you and he wants to be able to protect you.  He has to go, so he can come back to you and be with you forever.  Okay?"  She nodded and rubbed the snot from her nose across her sleeve.  Draco cringed, but continued to smile anyway.  Even his Scorpius had done that before they'd taught him such things were unsanitary.
But Harry wanted to understand him, because if he understood Draco and his choices—why he didn't kill Dumbledore, why he ran away with Snape, why he joined up with the Aurors—maybe, then, Harry could understand himself.
With a ready stance, he lifted his wand and began to chant the complicated sequence of words that Draco had taught him years ago, one that he'd recently had to use on a pesky bouquet.  Draco's eyes grew wide once he realized the spell Harry was using, then relief took over as the vines slithered away from their unending embrace.
"No small talk?  My, my Potter, already past the niceties of social convention I see.  Well, I must say I do approve.  Let's get down to business.  I have translated these papers.  A whole bunch of unconnected gibberish, if you ask me."  He handed the rolled up scroll he carried in his hand to Harry.
The doors banged against the stone walls, and Draco's heart wobbled between the stalled feeling of dread and the fluttery pace of anticipation.  Ida Hathaway walked through the open doorway with a slight skip to her step, and a bundle of long stemmed mushrooms in her hands.
Draco made sure the entire Great Hall was filled with roses and the path to the Apparition point, where they would leave for their honeymoon, was covered in different shades of reds and whites and pinks, the colors of love, fidelity, and purity.  He had visions of happily ever after as Granger threw variegated petals and Goyle slapped him on the back.  His friends were happy.  Harry was happy.  He was happy.  How could anything go wrong?
"Why you here, Malfoy?  It's," Harry looked up at the timepiece on the wall, "2 a.m.  I'm sure this could have waited till morning."
They lounged in bed for the better part of the morning until Snape roused them, saying they couldn't be laz-abouts all day, and they got up and each took his shower.
Ron had been completely consumed with his case in Mexico, so he hadn't visited Hermione as much as he would have liked. In fact, the last week had kept him away entirely. This did not make the redheaded man happy, as was made evident by the grumble and scowl he offered Harry as he threw himself into a chair next to Hermione's hospital bed. He reached out and more roughly than intended, grabbed his love's hand.
"I'm busy, Potter.  Get the fuck out."  He pushed past Harry and began organizing his potions ingredients by colour.  Black ashwinder skin.  Black eyeballs of the skurtim toad.  Black teeth of the kajo lizard.  Black intentions and black, oh so black, opinions of himself.
The light bulb overhead sputtered, flickered just a bit, but came back to full brightness.  Harry looked up at it, and wished upon it like a star.
Harry shuddered, having insects inhabiting his body didn't sound like a good way to go about his day, either.
She stopped dead in her tracks.  "And… you don't mind?  I remember when you about threw him into a pit of lava when he came onto you only a few months ago."
"We have so much to tell you, Hermione. Why don't we start from the beginning and then you can ask questions, okay?"
With effort, Harry had repositioned himself to lean against the very stone that once promised a gangrenous death.  Certain he had the strength to walk, he tried standing, only to fall back on his arse when he accidentally put weight on the leg.  Obviously, the bones within still rattled about in pieces.  He would need more than charms and a broken wand to fix that injury.  He needed Skele-Grow, and Harry didn't carry such specific potions with him.
They settled into silence, watching the sheep do nothing.  The Milky Way painted a swath across the night sky and Draco had to admit it was peaceful.
Within Kogelmann's possession was the key to the exit, where Agents Burns, Braithwaite and Meyers were found in a containment cell unharmed.
His lungs ached, his heart felt crushed, a flattened organ unwilling to pump blood.  He wanted to scream and wail, but he couldn’t do a thing.
The figure stopped and looked up. His vacant, opaque eyes settled on Draco. Draco couldn't read that expression because there wasn't one. There was nothing on that face. You couldn't even call it blank… it truly was… nothing. Blankness offered at least a sense of something hidden behind, tucked away, but here… Draco shuddered and realised there was nothing he could do. They had lost.
"Time is short," was all he said, yet his form gained more substance as he spoke the words. He nodded at Remus, urging him to do something… something Remus wasn't quite sure about. So he did just what Sirius suggested; he let Moony free and stopped fighting for the first time in decades.
"Which way did they go?" he yelled at one old man, who looked at him in fright and quickly shuffled away.
Teddy looked back over at the woman.  "Sure, I guess," he said doubtfully.  She hadn't seemed too noticeable to him.  She was maybe mid-twenties, long, brown hair, a definite harried look about her as she waited on her customers.  Nope, he wouldn’t have called her pretty unless he needed to lie to a relative or she was within earshot.
"We'll think of something," Harry said, already losing that brief spark of anger, of determination.  He pulled Draco to him and held him tight.  They'd gotten used to using each other for comfort in ways that would have shamed him in
They were all startled out of their glaring match when Crookshanks jumped down from the bed and ran up to Draco, rubbing between his legs, purring all the while.
The tightly tucked sheets were cool where Draco had wriggled in his toes.  The bright sun smiled through the window, lighting the room.  It felt like spring.  He couldn't resist smiling.
"Indeed, we will certainly have to determine how far this control extends.  And do mark my words, Potter, I will make you pay if you so much as attempt force.  In anything."  Severus looked over at Harry darkly, and Draco had to quell a desire to jump to the defense.
"Don't you care that I'm here, buying a wand from you?"  Draco tended to avoid such questions.  It was no mystery what the masses thought about him; his father did everything possible to spin his actions into those of a terrorist.
"Oh, fine really."  She tore her eyes away from Hermione and looked up at him.  "Oh Harry," she sniffed.
The undulating ground finally stilled, and Remus climbed unsteadily to his feet. A wave of dizziness caused him to sway, so he held his hands away from his body for balance. The table and chair was a pile of twisted metal and the remains of cardboard boxes floated through the air like fluff.
Then his world was scorched by a bright flash of pain originating from the tender spot at the back of his head.
The kiss, now that didn't come for some time.  First Draco recovered.  His broken bones and internal injuries completely healed within two weeks thanks to the marvels of wizarding medicine.  Next, he’d plotted endlessly, devising ways to get Harry to go on a date with him.  His plan would begin with assuring that Harry knew of his amazing assets: magical, financial, and physical.  He would lavish gifts on Harry, take him to the opera and expensive dinners—really drive home that Draco had everything to offer.  Then he would do something sweet.  Those emotional Gryffindors always liked a little romance; so Draco researched florists.  He was certain roses had to come into this story somehow.
section of the menu, "and this is curry". A long list of Spanish words held position on one side of the page.
"Harry was there, alive, but not conscious, and there were Aurors.  I couldn't do anything.  I tried to intervene, but they took him away and that was the last time I saw him.  And then Luna found out where he was and … well, you know the rest."  He blew his nose in a handkerchief, and Luna squeezed him tight.
They crossed onto the property from the shaded street, and Draco pulled short as Potter darted in front of his feet, almost tripping him.
He got up and threw himself on the couch staring into the flames.  "Sometimes I wish we had a telly," Harry whined.
It all happened so quickly, from Draco struggling against the shaft's dominion of Harry to its entire subjugation of the coven. It was hot, so hot, and Draco couldn't breathe. Then, in a separate instant, a loud click filled the room and everyone stumbled to the floor, panting, exhausted, released from the puppeteers strings. Draco almost fell upon Harry as he too was freed from the infinite power of the artefact.
"Would you stop that?" Draco pleaded. He cringed at the thought of the staff somehow dropping and losing its shackles, resulting in it blowing them both up, or even taking over their minds and magic, leaving them mindless zombies, or worse—squibs.
It only took a few minutes, and Draco found himself knee deep in Potters and other flotsam that drained in from the Potter's house.  Both wife and daughter hugged him, loved on him as Dean Thomas stood by and smiled at the reunion.  The boys were missing, apparently still flying on dragons.
and time is running out!"  Draco didn't know exactly how he knew this, he just did.  His intuition that had been nudging him since he hadn't received a letter from Harry six days ago had now turned into an inferno in his veins.
The air was crisp in the winter's evening, and Harry and Hermione were bundled up as they marched through the wet streets.  He wore a Weasley wool scarf and hat as well as his outer cloak, trying for a good impression of a toddler overly dressed by an over protective mother.
He watched it fly.  His first real success at a spell in this dimension, and he flew a rock to the other side of the earth.
"Potter, do calm down and explain yourself," Severus said.  He would not jump for joy.  He would not whoop his relief.  He would not show his excitement in any way.  But when Remus gripped at his arm, he couldn't help but glance over to his lover and offer a hopeful sparkle of his eye.  That would have to do.
And after.  What then?  He couldn't stay here in this secluded world, no matter the paradise it had seemed.  He was safe, but he wasn't living.  For a year now, he'd been standing still.  His contentment had turned into boredom and decay.
The fairy was male, though he wore a long skirt of spider silk.  His hair was yellow and spiked up in a mad array.  Instead of dragonfly wings, they were shaped more like oak leaves just turning into fall orange.  And he was approximately eleven inches high.
They shook hands, and Tufts butted Draco's leg with his head and proceeded to rub along it with his entire body.  He would have to launder everything with all of the cat hair floating about.
Remus turned and rushed out of the room, paying little attention to the route he took, just trying to escape that horrid cloud. Through one door he pushed, then down a hall he sprinted, skittering around a corner, through more passages, and then finally he paused for a breath of blessedly clean air. He leaned against a door, hunched over with his hands braced against his knees, gulping in deep breaths. It opened to his weight, spilling him into a small room.
He nodded mutely, and she turned and left, casting one more mischievous glance over her shoulder at her husband.  Surely, there was something here he was missing, and he hated being the one left out.
"But it was a gift really." Remus startled them all with his words. "I got to see him again and tell him how I really felt. It was a second chance and a part of me knew it wasn't anything long term. I knew it would be fleeting."
"Eat up, Potter," Malfoy said in a quiet, urgent voice, and there was more scraping and then the loud slurping of a starving beast trying to consume as quickly as possible before larger scavengers chased it away.
"Yes," Draco said, his own voice sounding flat and two-dimensional. He crouched down before the young Harry Potter, rough in his abuse, sorrowful in his loneliness. "I'm here to help you, but you have to work with me. Understand?"
"So, he came onto you again," Pansy asked.  Reclined against the door frame to his lab, she listened as Draco told her everything of the last few weeks, while she thrilled him with events going on in the world out there.  People disappearing, the censors, the restriction on marriage licenses.  He'd been pacing, wearing out the flagstones beneath the bottles of dead and pickled things.
"Yes, he goes by Tufts," she said with a warm smile, petting the long hair on the end of his left ear.  The purr grew loud.  Draco suppressed the urge to frown at the noise.
He stared down at Draco, his long body, the paleness of his skin.  He practically glowed in the early light, like some cocky, ethereal devil.  Harry's mouth buzzed with numbness from their kisses and he lifted his fingers to trace his lower lip where Draco had bit him.  Marked him.  Branded him straight to the centre of his core.
"Professor Argyle Popicon sent us to meet with High Priestess Apis. We are Remus Lupin, Harry Potter, and Draco Malfoy," Remus said into the dull blackness of the open door. The secrecy and ordeal to enter the place intrigued Draco, and he was more than a little interested in seeing what lay within.
"You don't know? Fucking get out of my mind! Get out!" The man screamed again and then Harry was physically knocked over, his body slamming into the ground with the force of a crash of rhinos.
Right there, before Draco's eyes, is the end.  The end of the violence, the end of death.  Kill one insane man, no, half of a man, to save many.  Could he condone such a thing?
"'This is a cursed, sentient artefact. Be careful. Its true strength is unknown, especially if all of its parts are reunited.
At the speed of thought, Draco shucked his jeans and stared down into the darkness where he could see a vague shape.  "On your hands and knees," and again Lily raced to answer Draco's demand.  He stared at the shape, butt tilted into the air, head down on the ground with mid-length hair fanned around him like a dark halo; his mouth watered at the sight.  He sank to the floor next to the wanton man and ran his hand through Lily's hair, then trailed his fingers along his spine, dancing across each vertebra.  He could feel scars crossing the soft skin and wondered at Lily's past.  Then Draco's fingers ran into the waistband of Lily's skirt and he bunched it up around his waist.
"Go to the MLE, the Aurors.  Don't just sit there, Harry."  Ron closed the last cage with a flick of the wand.  With everyone cleaned, fed and watered, Ron washed his hands and looked down at Harry, who had been mired in misery on the stool, staring at the note.
The globe of light floating over the table caused Draco's hair to glitter.  The man was still a bit of a mystery to Harry.  They'd become friends years ago by simple attrition.  There was hardly anyone of their year left that understood the horror of what they had gone through.  It started out with the Auror trainees meeting at the Stumbling Leprechaun when it had first opened.  Everyone was dumbfounded that Draco would even show up, but he was persistent.  He kept coming, using that damned charm and eventually everyone accepted him.  Harry was the hardest to win over, and he thought back to how he'd snubbed Draco over and over and was secretly ashamed.  But he hadn't known Draco then.  Well, honestly, Harry didn't know him now, either.
"Oh, so you do know of his immortality."  Harry doesn't seem surprised.  "Yes, I am…"  Then suddenly, Harry faces Draco again.  "But we've got something planned.  All the others are destroyed…. And mine…" he touches the leather, "well, let's just say that with Hermione on our side, we've figured it all out.  My Soul Patch,” he taps the eye patch, “keeps the power of the soul in check.  It sucks the energy from it, constantly gaining intensity as Voldemort's soul feeds it.  All that's left now is a small shard in my eye, a weak thing.  If we put Voldemort and the patch in contact, it'll activate, smothering both souls."
"See you at the Bildge," Laura calls as she continues down the street towards a cross alley.  "Everyone's expecting you, and I'll tell elaborate lies if you don't show up!"
Harry waited, swinging his feet to brush against the floor every time with a little 'whooshing' noise.  He was in Draco's room, where Draco did things like study Muggle comic books and other things like get dressed and sleep.  Walking around naked and … Harry got up from his chair and went to lie on the bed, burying his face in the pillow, sucking in Draco's scent.  It infiltrated his nose and raced to his brain.  Harry flipped his tail hard against the bed, then he rolled over, rubbing his back against the duvet, then flipped to his belly again, brushing his cheek over and over against the pillow, wanting more of that delicious smell.  A heavy purr rattled the air.
The wards surrounding the cottage and land remained.  The forest still contained the unknown, because Harry had never ventured there.  His world: it was microscopic.  It was safe.
"Draco, I'm coming in."  He twisted the knob, pushed open the door, and almost fell in his rush to save Draco from… flowers?
Near the entrance was a basket of fake fruit: apples, pears, peaches.  A broken rocking horse.  A painting slashed down the middle.  Detritus.  Leftovers of life he no longer had any part in.
The heat burns him, chars his core, his spirit.  He struggles to rise, to surface and breathe and he wants to live, to fucking live even in a shattered world.
At first everything fuzzed out, seemed to lose its form and definition, but only for that stark instant. In the next second, reality snapped back into crystal clear mayhem.
The man continued to stare into the crystalline sphere settled between his palms, no emotions on his face, only a thin line of silver drool trailing down his chin.
Lucius nodded, smiling at his prodigy of a son who had returned to him.  He turned his back on Draco as he poured the drinks.  A sign of trust he would soon pay for.  "I must say," he said, "I was beginning to lose hope, though I was impressed with some of your strategy.  The manor was a terrible loss, however.  That, my son, was a waste."  He lifted the drinks and turned towards Draco, who'd finished the last swoop of his wand and then drove his mind into his father's.
