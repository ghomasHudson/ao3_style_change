“Is there another village anywhere nearby? It’s just, one of my friends loves little places to visit and has already been here multiple times. He says it’s kind of lost its charm,” Harry says, touching his nose as if revealing a grave secret.
Draco shakes his head. “No. Someone has to have removed it.”
When Draco steps out of the bathroom half an hour later—naked but for the towel wrapped around his waist—the smell of coffee pulls him towards the kitchen. He rushes down the corridor, making a beeline for what he knows will be a perfect coffee. Harry stops him though, stepping in front of the mug with a hand raised. He pushes the hand into Draco’s chest, barring him quite effectively.
“I thought you lost them!”
Malfoy’s eyebrows lift, but Harry ignores them. They settle into silence again.
A gasp from somewhere in the room startles me. Footsteps come racing towards the bed I’m on, gaining speed as they travel.
Once Potter’s told him everything, Draco shares the little extra he knows. He’d love to get his hands on it again and run through more exams specific to Unspeakable work. Unfortunately, while he’s bed ridden he can’t see that happening very soon. Even so, there are multiple spells he’d like to try. On Friday, he had been distracted and a bit upset. He hadn’t been thinking straight and therefore not analytically. Not like Potter does. If he had, he wouldn’t have run away in search of Potter; he definitely wouldn’t have fallen into the damn hole.
“That’s not a bad thing!” Harry tries. “I actually liked it, you looked so happy and free.”
He’s like a child, latching onto their mother and determined not to be moved. Or a cat that only wants attention and naps. Harry doesn’t know whether it’s these comparisons or just his self-preservation slowly disintegrating, but something urges him to kiss the top of Draco’s head. Once the notion is in mind though, he can’t shake it. Harry sighs, knowing he’ll give in. He rocks Draco softly, making sure he’s asleep. And then he touches his lips to Draco’s forehead, quick and innocent.
“Sure you did. Sure you weren’t just wanking about Potter all morning,” he sneers. I roll my eyes and pack my bag for the day with the books I’ll need.
The audience groans openly at that, and cheer on Gryffindor even harder.
The door to the abandoned classroom bangs open, and Draco feels the ground rushing to meet him. He hits the stone floor hard, groaning as his stiff limbs move for the first time in over two hours.
Laughing, he responds with, “I’m sure you are. Ok then, why did I ask you here?”
“It warms up whenever I’m in the same area as my father. If we layered a charm onto it that read the temperature, we could see it rising before I could even feel it. If that was the case, we would leave immediately.”
the one who tried to jump at
I relay that to Hermione, and she hurriedly grabs at the notepad and writes it down, still standing. “Should he progress, or do we want to utilise him here?” I ask, thinking that she will have a clearer head than me. But why should she? She’s his best friend, and I’m… what
Draco doesn’t want to think about it though, and supposes he can add it to the ever growing list of things he’s ignoring. He swears, each day more and more things pile up. By the time they’re out of here, it’s going to be a mile long!
*~*~*~
“What do you say Draco spins this time?” Blaise asks the group, and everyone nods. Everyone except Harry, who can’t think of a worse idea, but no one seems to care.
“Fine,” Draco sighs. He falls forward, catches himself on the couch, and pushes up until he’s sitting on the cushions. “Better?”
“Here,” Potter says as he walks back in. He paces towards Draco with a wet flannel in his clutch.
“Eloquent as always, Potter.”
Harry nods in acknowledgment and is about to ask if he’d like one of his own, but decides it’s too friendly to ask something like that. Too casual and not teasing enough. “What were you doing?” He asks instead, trying to redirect the conversation away from his clumsiness and god-awful sweater.
Silence lapses over them. It doesn’t take long for Malfoy to break it. “It’s fine, once I have my energy back I’ll be able to do it myself.”
“Okay,” Draco responds without much thought. “Why are you telling me?” He adds when his brain leaves the pages of his book.
of all people to be trapped in the woods? That doesn’t make any sense!”
A crash from the kitchen startles Harry out of his thoughts and he turns. Malfoy is standing at the stove attempting to make a fry-up. He appears to know what he’s doing, even if he
The lifts aren’t that large, and there aren’t that many of them. It’s a problem normally, with so many workers trying to move about. It’s even worse with hundreds of people trying to get to the same floor at the same time. It would have made more sense to get a Portkey straight to the Department of Mysteries, but the wards prevent any form of magical transportation. The elevators will have to do.
“It’s another Muggle invention. Their photos don’t move, they’re just a moment in time where everything is frozen. Videos are more like our photos. They are essentially long photos. They have to be taken on certain devices, and can go for as long as the taker likes.” Her explanation doesn’t make much sense, but I think I get the gist of it.
Malfoy, arms laden with vegetables and meats, walks back to Harry and moves to dump the lot into Harry’s hands. Harry lifts an eyebrow and turns to find a basket. There’s a little stack across the walkway, and he jogs to get one. When he turns back to give it to Malfoy, it’s to find the other man casually floating one towards him. Harry frowns and races back to him.
let alone tackle that thing.”
“Oh who cares Malfoy! Just make the bloody drinks.”
“She’s breathing, Malfoy.” His stunningly green eyes sparkle, an unusual sight these days, unlike from our earlier years at Hogwarts.
Narcissa smiles, stacking them neatly and picking up the jelly beans. She opens the box and tips them out, waving her wand over them. About half change colour, lightening into a bright, unmissable orange. She separates them from the others and vanishes them, then selects one of the leftovers at random.
Much better.
He snorts gently at me, and I manage a soft smile. “Do you want to know then?” I let my mouth twist into what I hope mimics a smirk, although I’m not sure. As I’m waiting for him to answer, he takes a step closer to me. The scent of shea butter floods my senses, and I try to ignore the goosebumps breaking out on my neck. When I don’t take a step back, he takes another forward. Amber follows the shea butter, and I am suddenly intoxicated on the smell of Potter. I’m standing deathly still, not wanting to scare him away or give the wrong insinuation.
I exhale in relief. “Well, they now also know for a fact that I am with you.” I feel my cheeks hurt. “Not- not
“Not when it comes to Harry!” She sounds exasperated, like it’s the simplest thing in the world.
Tearing it open, he unfolds the parchment and starts reading. I scan it too, searching for something helpful.
I heave a sigh of relief as the tone shifts and becomes more inquisitive. “As you know, I Fell in the Manor earlier this year,” I start.
what you could be capable of.”
“Just here to dance, sorry.” He moves away, back into the swarm of bodies.
Malfoy blanches. “I don’t think I want to watch it.”
“…yes I know. We’re doing everything we can to make sure that doesn’t happen, and if it takes too long we will intervene.”
Harry hums. “You’ll have to make it yourself then, ‘cause I’m showering.” With that said, Harry turns around again and leaves Draco alone in the kitchen.
Not that Malfoy seems to notice Harry’s internal war. He just sits there, knees drawn up now that he’s finished his soup, staring into space. Harry looks at him, really
“Oh, shough off Pansy. I don’t want to talk about that,” I state, before leaping into a conversation about Quidditch. She gets the message, and happily takes up the small talk. Eventually, I zone out, and her light conversation fades to background noise.
“Move it?” Draco doesn’t see why he’d want to move it at all.
More bone pierces my skin, rising out of my back. I know it’s the last bit, the branches. This should be the easiest, with the bones here becoming thinner and shorter. And it is—for a while. Unfortunately, I underestimated how much grief the tiny bones with sharp edges would cause me. Tears start streaming down my face, leaving tracks in the blood that’s somehow become smeared there. My eyes sting and my hands shake, but nothing I scream stops it happening. The corners of the bones poke into my skin, getting stuck on it and pulling it off my back. I can feel as it tears and rips, causing more blood to trickle down my body.
She takes her muggle quill off the parchment and looks at me. “But you did. You got a letter to Harry, and you are
as. There’s nothing that can change that anymore.”
“Oh shite! I’m so sorry!”
“How are you?” Potter asks, hand resuming its stroking.
A sharp knock startles me and I inhale rapidly. The knock comes again, persistent, and I draw my wand from my robes. Standing mere centimetres from the intruder, I prepare a list of curses and charms to fire off, and I hold my breath, waiting. An impatient sigh fills the room, and the shadow moves closer.
“You’re being over dramatic,” Draco says.
“That’s dangerous,” Draco murmurs, leaning up to press his lips to his neck.
“And that’s ten points to Slytherin!” The commentator screams into his microphone.
, Draco had corrected himself.
“Draco?”
Potter’s skin looks so soft and warm, supple. His normally sharp jaw is relaxed, and his lips are parted on his breaths. Draco wants to touch them, to trace their shape with his finger. He feels his own breath morph into soft pants, and he has no hope of stopping himself from doing it. It was a lost cause really, something he was bound to give into the second he woke up.
Harry gasps for breath as they break apart, his lungs burning at the lack of oxygen. He can hear his pulse in his ears, blocking out everything except himself and Draco. After a second of harsh breathing, he feels lips on his jaw. It wrenches a moan from him as Draco nips gently, and then his mouth moves down to his neck. Draco sucks a mark into his skin, high up on his neck where Harry won’t be able to cover it. Harry can’t help the groan he releases, and tugs Draco back up to meet his lips again. Right where he wants him.
“I’ll see you in a few hours, Caelum.”  With a last hug Harry watched as his son practically bounced up the steps to his preschool.  He had been hesitant about sending the boy to school so early but after gentle prodding from Hermione and Molly and much internal debate with himself, he had given in and enrolled him in the half day program.   Harry feared it wouldn’t be long before he gave in to Caelum’s pleading and switched him to the full day program instead.
“Would you be willing to organize this?”
Kind of lost inspiration for this fic.  It’s a rather open ending but I’m ok with where it ends.  I have a vague idea to come back and turn it to a series in a while.
When he entered the conservatory, he was greeted by his mother and his best friend Blaise. “Good afternoon Mother. Nippy failed to inform me that you had called in the reinforcements to attempt to convince me to return to Hogwarts.” Blaise had been on the neutral side of the war refusing to declare an allegiance or even entertain a conversation with anyone who brought Voldemort or the need to pick a side up. Because of this he had no reason not to head back in September and was trying to guilt Draco into joining him in any way he could. Now that Mother and Blaise had joined forces he didn’t know how much longer he could hold out on his refusal. They were both forces to be reckoned with alone so together he had no chance.
Draco turns and hides his eye roll. He’d rather hoped he’d be able to ditch the other man, but it seems fate is against him. He sets off in a random direction, not really thinking about where he’s going.
“You’re beautiful you know,” Harry mumbles, burying his face into Draco’s shoulder and wrapping his arms around his waist.
I no longer feel much at all, just longing to be saved. Even if it’s by my previous enemy.
“Draco?” Harry asks, hearing the coolness I’ve forced into my voice. “Are you alright?”
Not being able to stand his inspection of my face, I pull the great doors in and glide out of the Hall. I walk briskly down the corridor and through to the nearest bathroom. The heavy door slams behind me and I cross the spacious, white and gold bathroom. Stopping in front of the mirror, I turn on the tap and freezing water gushes out. I let it rove over my hands, the water just cold enough to start aching. I splash my abnormally pale face and rake my fingers over my cheeks. I stare into my reflection and watch my Adam’s apple bob as I swallow. The pale skin lifts and drops in time, and I can’t help but think that my throat is quite slender and a bit pink. Ugly by all means. The sound of the door slamming draws me from my stupor, and I rush into a cubicle so as not to be disturbed. Footsteps cross quickly over the floor, sneakers squeaking on the tiles. They stop suddenly, as if the person wearing them is looking around the room. And then the footsteps pick up again, and I hear them approaching my cubicle on the far side of the bathroom. A shadow creeps under the blue door and I try to figure out who it is.
Minerva chuckled to herself.  She hadn’t seen this group so quiet ever before.  “You are welcome, and even encouraged, to return to your house common rooms if you wish to visit.  You do not need to wear the uniform though, just the plain black school robes that you should have purchased.  As long as it isn't inappropriate you can wear your own casual clothing beneath your robe.  The password for 8
“I like it better than bearing my soul via Veritaserum Truth or Dare.  Let’s do it.” Millicent agreed.
No one really knew how much he had accomplished so far as most of his experiments were inconsequential projects with no significant use.  He made a few of them taste better, removed a possible side effect or two, it was nothing that was going to change the world of potions.  There were however, two projects that were all his own and not just reworking of someone else’s discovery.  One he was finished with and was currently telling Theo about.  The other was almost there but he was stuck on where to go next.  He knew there was a way to accomplish it, but he was so lost in the desire to see it come to fruition that he was losing focus.  He needed a fresh set of eyes or to walk away for a while and try again later.  He had never wished more that Severus had survived the war, he knew without a doubt that he’d be able to point him in the right direction.
Ten minutes later found most of them back downstairs lounging on the couch and bean bags.  Justin, Ernie, and Stephen decided to stay in their room and the Patil twins decided to get some sleep and join the next time.  The Gryffindors (and Hannah) all changed into pajamas while the Slytherins remained in the clothes they had worn upstairs to begin with.
“Nah, you will be more than enough.” Harry winked at Draco teasingly.  “You can help Caelum and I bake cookies before everyone heads over.  Did you want me to apparate you down to the gate or anywhere?  I’m going to head out to meet Ron.”
Harry sat up suddenly in bed.  He smiled.  Godric, he had missed that bossy voice.  How had he gone so long without it?
Pansy winked and replied “Who says I haven’t already?” She then took a seat and pulled Harry down next to her.  “Potter, take a seat. Let’s get the party started.”
“Couldn’t hurt. I’m sure it will make things easier on us both and this place could use more than just well-aimed scourgify can fix.”
While most of the purebloods had indeed purchased muggle clothing before, it was generally the high-end variety.  That didn’t seem to be Harry’s aim so several of the group members were curious.  They all sat around discussing what they needed to accomplish before classes started up on Monday and in the end, it was a group of Harry, Hermione, Pansy, Draco, Theo, and Blaise that decided to go together.  The others agreed to meet them later that night at The Dragon’s Lair.
year.  “Is there anything else you are working on?”
Pansy cleared her throat and read the note aloud.  “Students, it is our hope you use the items inside to begin to repair and broker new relationships. It has been said ‘If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.’  Be responsible and we will see you on Monday. – Your professors” She then held up 2 large bottles of Ogden’s Old Firewhiskey adorned with bows.  “There’s a load of potion bottles at the bottom of the box too.”  She placed the bottles on the table and looked back in the box.  “Let’s see….there’s at least 20 hangover potions, a handful of pain killer potions, and –“ She gasped “No fucking way.  Draco, come here, is this what I think it is?”
What about house common rooms and year common rooms?  There are dozens upon dozens of unused classrooms.  Let each year decorate their room as they wish.  It stays theirs until graduation and then is cleaned back to its default before the next incoming first years come in to claim it as their own. No one is forced to join in, but as more do, the desire to see what everyone is talking about will win out so that most will at least check it out.”
As Harry stood in front of the mirror that night he vowed he would never again agree to any deal with Pansy without major stipulations or clearly worded promises.  He was clad in black leather pants so tight sitting could be an issue and a tight black t-shirt with a green foil image of a snake coiled around the side of it.  Sweet Merlin he’d kill her.  He heard the voices from downstairs calling him to hurry up and realized he was the last one to join them.  Fuck.  Now not only did he have to wear this out, he was going to make an entrance.  “Fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK! Parkinson!  I will get you back for this!” He bellowed as he opened the door to make his way downstairs.
“Oh, and Potter?”
“Tell me anyway,” I rush, too fast to keep up my pretence if nonchalance. Oh well.
Draco shakes his head. “That’s uhm, not what I meant to say.” Even though it probably wouldn’t be the worst thing to happen to him… Fuck, where did
“Are you okay?!” Harry murmurs, hands roaming over his face and cupping his cheek.
I flat the bowl in front of Harry, who puts the chicken into it and then slides it towards me. The lime juice tips itself in as Harry mixes in some paprika. I drop the chilli powder in as he adds some pepper.
“Five to ten,” Hermione replies. “You’d better get going if you want to make it all the way down to the Great Hall.” Harry thanks her and flees from the common room. He shouts a goodbye to Ron who's caught up playing wizards’ chess with Terry Boot across the room, before sprinting down the many flights of stairs.
“Well, you do. It’s just the other one is paperwork, and you hate it.”
Harry shrugs. “Well, yeah?”
Harry must be imagining it, but Draco’s voice drops at the end. It sends a curl of fire racing through his body. He pushes it away; there’s no way it was even there, and if it was, it wasn’t intentional.
“That was…”
“Done?” Potter asks.
“Draco, do you know what this could mean for the war?” Her eyes have lit up now, like she’s delighted with this turn of events.
“The wards would probably shred me into a million pieces. I’ve no doubt been removed.”
Harry shares a few of his stories too, after Malfoy begins one that he has to leave things out of more often than not and realises it’s not going to work. He tells Malfoy about this one case where he and Ron were investigating a unicorn trade, and how one of the criminal leaders nearly impaled himself on one of the horns.
“You like it too, by that sound,” Malfoy mutters, not facing Harry.
“Merlin,” I mutter, shaking my head. “Last time we tried we couldn’t tell the kitchen apart from a spice shop.”
Draco turns his wand in a slow circle, then waves it out into an arc. The same pattern as the spell used yesterday, but a beat faster. He never would have thought being an Unspeakable would mean being precise down to the
“Did you just-?”
Harry wants to mark him up, wants everyone to know that Draco is
“I reckon he must have volunteered for it too. He was practically bald to start with, so when I say he ‘lost all his hair’ it’s a very loose term,” Harry continues, taking a bite of his red apple.
Draco takes a step forward, arm reaching for the Cabinet’s doors. The smooth wood is soft and silky beneath his hand as he grips the edge of the door. His fingers dance across it, inching towards the swirling, silver handles. He wraps his hand around it, cold metal beneath his skin. He takes a deep breath, calming his racing heart, and pulls the door open. The inside of the Cabinet is just as perfect as the outside, and Draco takes a second to marvel at the interior. It’s so incredibly detailed and flawless; something born from magic.
“I figured that out on my own already. Unlike you, I am perfectly capable of understanding implications.”
He paces, cursing his own name over and over. Draco doesn’t deserve Harry’s care.
“Gorgeous,” Draco murmurs, lifting a hand to trail down his chest.
“Come on, Potter,” he grunts as he pushes himself onto his haunches. He settles himself just behind Harry’s cock, legs in either side of his hips, allowing his own cock to touch Harry’s for a second. “How are we doing this?” He wants to pick something that works for Harry, as a ‘thank you’ for the exceptional rimming.
I always come to the same conclusion though. The two terrible excuses for men know I won’t leave. They know that I know that if I was to desert them, they would track me. Voldemort would employ thousands of Death Eaters to find me, and to bring me back to him to die at his hands. Hours of torture would occur, worsened because of my father. I would be considered a ‘traitor’. I have nothing wrong with that last bit, of course. But I wouldn’t want to leave my mother. She would surely be punished for my actions, and I couldn’t let that happen. I wouldn’t ever forgive myself.
“I do! I take your advice more than I probably should,” I confess.
Harry returns the smile, gathering his famous ‘Gryffindor courage’. Here goes nothing.
They fall silent, and Harry’s glad he’s dropped the subject. He’s not glad that it’s a sore spot for both of them as that means Malfoy is also suffering, but at least they’re not dealing with it alone, unlike last time.
Harry takes a second to compose himself, breathing in deeply, before jumping off the stage and walking towards the Slytherin table. Behind him, he hears McGonagall trying to gather attention back to her, but he can still feel everyone’s eyes on him, so it doesn’t matter. He walks ever closer to the table, stopping right before Draco.
“Yes….and no. I just don’t really know what to do. I’m extremely honored that Kingsley is willing to waive N.E.W.T.s for us to join this fall but I’m also so tired of fighting. Hogwarts sounds great. A year to relax without Voldemort as a constant threat. But I’m worried that as bad as it was to be ‘The Boy Who Lived’ being ‘The Boy Who Lived Again’ will be even worse. I don’t really know what to do, Siri.” Harry replied.
“Well, we’ve tried all we can and there’s simply no way we can fit all the DADA classes Professor Daniels has on his schedule.  We thought about asking the ministry for a rotation of aurors to help out with the lower years but are wary of asking them for help again after the disaster their last contribution was.”
Caelum must come first no matter if we decide to pursue a relationship or not.   I think the best thing we could do at this point is put our feelings aside and focus on him and building a relationship for the two of you.  Maybe when that’s stable we can look at if there can be an us or not.  I doubt my feelings for you will ever really change and while I’ve gone on a few dates here and there with others, it’s not anything I’ve ever bothered with.
“Who said I know what I’m doing?  I’m just looking forward to getting pissed and watching you all make fools of yourselves.” Harry laughed.  “Well, considering we are supposed to get to know each other better, we could address the preconceived ideas we all harbor.  Anyone ever play Most Likely?” There were a few nods around the room, but most seemed unfamiliar with the game.  “It’s a pretty straightforward game and easy to catch on.  We all write down something on a slip of parchment that we think someone is likely to do.  We then mix them up and take turns reading them out.  For example, one might state ‘Most likely to run through the Great Hall starkers’, we then each quickly point at who we think that could most likely apply to.  For every finger pointed at you, you must take a shot.  You don’t have to vote if you are unsure, there’s no penalty.  Since the shots can add up quickly, we can just let the shots sit in front of us at the table and take them as we feel comfortable.  Gives us time to talk and get to know each other too during the game without getting black out drunk in 4 rounds.  If you don’t have a shot on the table you are welcome to drink one anyway.  It’s really just a simple game to see what others think of you, true or not.”
“As for the properties, I’m not sure.  I’d like to go to Phoenix Perch today and see what we find there.  I want to check out the house near Hogwarts and the cabin in Wales, but I don’t think I want to keep either.  I could either sale them and add the money to what I plan to disperse or gift them as well.  I don’t think I’ll know until I see them and see what kind of condition they are in.”
I don’t really know what to say or where to start.  I sat up all night thinking what I’d say and trying to get the words together but it all came out as some kind of verbal vomit.  An apology is the obvious go to but what exactly am I apologizing for?  I am sorry you were left alone and had to go through all of this without me.  I’m sorry I missed out on so many years of my son’s life.  I’m sorry he doesn’t know me as anything more than an idea of a person.  I’m sorry I hurt you by walking away.
Draco withdraws his wand from pale grey trousers, and starts calmly dragging it through the air around the door. Going through the extensive list of detection charms and spells that he has memorised is a long process, but the world around him blurs like usual and he doesn’t notice the time passing. The second that one of the spells he casts returns a purple glow, he steps away.
Malfoy laughs at that, and starts talking about his mysterious work partner. Harry knows nothing about this person, not their gender, name, hair or skin colour, nothing. Literally nothing. He understands it’s a security risk, and that the only reason Malfoy can talk about it at all is because they occasionally work together, but it still leaves a massive hole in his imagination.
So he doesn’t, and when Harry darts his tongue out to lick his bottom lip, Draco makes sure to keep ‘sleeping’. Harry doesn’t stop there though. His hand remains in Draco’s hair, threading through it and massaging his head, even as his mouth slowly moves. His lips leave Draco’s mouth, choosing instead to rove over his jaw. Draco wants to groan, to tip his head back and give Harry more room to work. He doesn’t though, keeping himself still and silent. Peaceful. Definitely not aroused.
“What do you think, Potter?”
He nods, giving in.
By the time Potter opens my door again, I am terrified that something’s gone wrong. Maybe Mother is dead? Maybe Potter was found? Killed? Maybe Father and Voldemort are on their way to my room right this second? Needless to say, I am relieved when I catch sight of the messy black hair. From where I’m lying on the bed, I can’t really see much. I force myself to sit up, the pain agonising. I clutch my back, trying to dull it a bit. This only results in making it worse. Quickly jerking my hand away, I groan.
Harry set down his towel a foot from Draco’s, and pulled a bottle of sun lotion out of his backpack.
like this situation. Luna may have been in Ravenclaw back in our Hogwarts days, but she doesn’t think this way. And Seamus… well, rest assured it isn’t him.”
Malfoy turns to look at Blaise, his expression hidden from Harry; after a slight hesitation, he reaches forward. Draco’s pale, delicate hands look beautiful next to the bottle. Harry shakes his head.
Still curious about the store, Draco moves up to the window. He doesn’t really want to break in—none of the lights are on, so it must not be open yet since it’s still rather early—so he instead settles for looking through the glass. The interior of the building looks neat and polished. At least, it would if it wasn’t covered in dust and looking extremely unused. It looks like it used to be a butcher. As he walks slightly to the left to get a better view through the window, Draco sees a poster. “Best Butcher, 1995”. Draco frowns, put on edge with this new information. Why would a village’s butcher have closed down? He looks around, hoping to find a person he can ask. He doesn’t. Eyebrows creasing, he turns his head towards the horizon. The sun has lifted towards the east, the sunrise staining the sky pink and orange. It’s beautiful, and he takes a second to stare at it.
“Quite.” McGonagall smugly hoped one or two of the first years drove the young man in front of her as crazy as he and his father had driven her over the years.
No one failed to notice how much meaning and emotion was behind such a simple sentence.  Harry had lived at a few different places yet he had never had a place he could completely call his own home.  He couldn’t recall the first year of his life at Godric’s Hollow and the Dursley’s was never even close to a home.  Hogwarts was the first place he felt he could call but it was never his.  So many others felt the same towards it.  Phoenix Perch he could call his own.  His cheeks had begun to hurt from smiling when he started back around the front to make his way inside.
He heard a pecking at the window and noticed the owl with a package attached to its leg.  He walked over to let the owl in and wondered who would have sent him something.  “Hello.  Aren’t you a beauty?  I’m sorry I don’t have any owl treats on me, but if you make your way to the owlery you’re welcome to rest and grab a bite to eat.”  He removed the package and noticed the handwriting on it.  Harry?  Why would Harry send him anything?  He placed the package on the table in front of him and settled into a chair to read the letter.
But then at the same time I remember who I was when I did walk away and wonder if it wasn’t for the best.  I don’t know if you realize how broken I still was.  I started drinking heavily but soon that didn’t numb the pain enough.  After joining the band, I discovered muggle drugs and never imagined they’d have much affect on me.  It didn’t take long until I was spending a few thousand a month on cocaine and sleeping with whoever happened to look my way.  The future I had always imagined for myself was gone so what did it matter if I screwed up whatever life I was faced with now was my thinking, I guess.
Harry nodded as he put the last few products he had in the box onto the shelf in front of him.  He then stepped outside, raised the wards on the bottom half of the property, and conjured a sign on the door that stated they would reopen at 2.  Just a few minutes later Fred joined him, and they began the trek to Caelum’s school.  The two made small talk after Harry asked about George and were halfway there when Fred broached a subject that was normally intentionally avoided.
Minerva felt a bit guilty asking but she really had no other idea what to do.  There was just too much to teach and not enough time in the day for one person to do it.  “Harry, I’d like to offer you limited employment.  I’ve talked to the board and explained the issue as well as your history with the D.A.  They are in agreement that your results there and in your own life speak for themselves.  You are a superb teacher and I hope one day to offer not limited but permanent employment.
Pansy knew Draco was nervous about a few of the shops and wasn’t sure if the shopkeepers would even accept his money but she didn’t mention it.  Instead she agreed and they set off to Flourish and Blotts to add the books new to the shopping list to what they already had from last year’s attempt at their 7
it is possible, I do not yet
“I’m honestly relieved to hear that.  I won’t lie and say the thought that you could have known and walked away not caring never crossed my mind, but I always hoped you just didn’t know.
She was still pretty confident that Draco was in fact Smoke.  Approaching him and asking outright would get nothing but a blank look and a denial she was sure.  Best to let that conversation wait at least a few weeks until they all got a little more comfortable with each other.  There was really no rush to solve the mystery and it was better to be patient and wait for results even if the urge to know was strong.  She knew it’d never cross Ron’s mind, but Harry might start piecing it together soon, so she’d have to watch that.  She could subtlety guide him in other directions and encourage his investigation of other people for now.
“They started wearing these a year ago as of the beginning of December. The bastards have been planning this for ages!”
Scowling, Malfoy drags his nails over Harry’s arm. “Scratch all your skin off.”
Draco swallows but nods, heart racing as he slides his finger into the opening. He pushes it away, looking into the wallet. Inside there is a £50 Muggle note, but that’s not what catches his eye. There’s a second inscription, this one written in black. It reads ‘
“Well, now that he is gone for a second you can ask me.” I can hear Potter’s shrug through the door.
Draco blinks furiously, trying not to cry at his love’s cruel words. “I’m sorry, okay. I don’t know what I’ve done to upset you, but I’m sorry.”
~~The End~~
Harry’s smile is wobbly, and Draco raises a hand to wipe his tears away. “I’m glad you like it,” he says, eyes shining with happiness even as he cries.
It makes his heart race in happiness that he can still do this; that even with the rug pulled from beneath his feet, he can still write up a Senior Auror-worthy report. Harry smiles and moves away, forcing himself to get on with it. He needs to shower, make breakfast, apologise to Draco, and focus a lot more on getting out of here.
“Let’s go,” he says, a tentative smile on his face. He doesn’t really feel it, but if it eases some of the tension Draco’s feeling, it’s worth it.
Once we eat and leave for our dormitories, I remember that our
“Malfoy. We need to get you out of here and into St Mungos,” Potter says, tone urgent.
Notes about Malfoy start piling up too, and Harry feels like he’s back in Sixth Year with an unhealthy obsession. Except now they’ve worked together for years, and he is obsessed in a totally different way. In Sixth Year, he was sure Malfoy was up to something. Yes, he might have gone to the extreme, and yes everyone thought he had a crush on Malfoy, but he didn’t. Now though, the Ferret is annoyingly fit and
“That would be excellent!  I’ll take a few days to decide what to do then send you an owl.”  The smaller goblin returned with the list and handed it to Ragnok for approval.  After a quick glance Ragnok handed it to Harry who simply folded it and placed it in his pocket.  He’d go over it with Sirius later because he didn’t think he could handle any more shocks alone.  “Thank you so much for all your help and your patience today.”  He gracefully bowed to the goblin and made his way out of the bank and began to return home.
Harry continued on adding “You could always offer up extra credit to the older years.  Prefects are generally busy enough with rounds and their own work but there are other responsible students who wouldn’t mind sitting in a room doing homework and keeping an eye out for trouble if it helped them.  Sit in a room for 5 nights and get a free pass on one essay.  There are only a few rooms that would need the oversight, and it wouldn’t be for long.  I think within 2 weeks you could cut it out and then have a house elf on call for each room.  If a student feels they are in danger or being bullied, they call out the name of the elf assigned to their room.  That elf alerts the closest adult and the problem is addressed.”
“That’s more than acceptable.  Now, as much as I appreciate all of your ideas, I’ve gotten way off track as to why I asked you up.  As I said earlier, I have received your schedule and noticed you aren’t taking many classes.”
“Forgetting Dumbledore’s last great puzzle, I’m proud of you pup.  I was worried you were beginning to let life pass you by.  Solving another riddle isn’t how I imagined it’d happen, but you’ve got a small spark back in your eye.  I’m happy.” Here Sirius paused. “Then I remember you’re moving out and I’m not.  It’s a very confusing ride you’ve set me on.” He winked and Harry laughed.  “So, let’s see the list of contenders and narrow it down for you, Prongslet.”
“Anyone care to help out those of us who are shit at potions?”  Seamus inquired.
“Sure, no problem. Thanks Sirius.”  He took Teddy from Sirius and placed him in the makeshift cot next to the table.  “Settle in because I’ve got loads to tell you both.”
Theo taking a seat next to Draco brought a smile to her face.  She had such an enjoyable day out with him today.  The two spent hours talking about history, famous authors, and customs both magical and muggle.  He challenged her brain in ways that no one ever had before and pointed out inconsistences in her knowledge that would have taken her a very long time to recognize, if ever.  Yet, he did it in ways that weren’t spiteful or sneering.  It had actually taken her a while to realize he was even aware of what he was doing as his redirection and comments were so gentle.  She smiled as she made her way closer to the duo.  While she couldn’t talk to Draco about she wanted to tonight, she could get to know him a little more and if spending more time with Theo was a consequence of that, then all the better.
“I’m not sure but hopefully it doesn’t require camping in the woods and living on the run again.” Harry joked.
In the end though, it was Ron who put us onto the right track.  I’ve never seen him so uncomfortable or cringed so much when he asked about our sex life.  Hermione was upstairs digging through the library after dinner as she normally did, and Ron and I were outside relaxing.
One by one they stepped to the door and paused as McGonagall cast the spell towards them.  Hermione was impressed by the creative entrance.  She had never thought passwords were very secure and it would be nice to be able to relax knowing no one could sneak in to cause trouble.  After she had been added to the wards protecting their new area she walked into the common room and looked around.  It was in the shape of a large rectangle with a loft area above that looked to house their rooms.  The seating area boasted two large windows with cushy looking window seats that over looked the courtyard below.  There was a sunken area between the entryway and the windows that had a large U-shaped dark grey sectional couch with pillows of various shades of purple and green.  The couch faced a large fireplace that was already lit.  There was a coffee table in the middle of the couch and a few bean bags dotted around in the sunken area as well.  At the other end of the ground floor she saw a kitchen area, a large rectangular table on one side of the room, and 5 smaller round tables closer to the large window on that side of the room that looked perfect for studying.  As she walked over for a closer look she spotted a small bathroom.  She noted 3 staircases leading upstairs, one near the kitchen area and the other two on each side of the living room area.  It was lovely and she couldn’t wait to see what the upstairs offered.
“Malfoy.” Potter flashes a smirk at Draco, who forces himself to calm down and think rationally. There’s no use being angry at the idiot when there’s a job to do. He nods curtly back to Potter and turns to face Robards again.
[A glass angel sculpture hanging over a city street at night]
“Let’s walk to an Apparition point, eh?” Draco asks, slinging his arm over Harry’s shoulders and gently guiding him to the door their friends just went through.
Draco sighs, he should have known Potter would want to do something like this. He’s always trying to get things written up so he can reread them. “As long as it’s a mind map, go ahead,” he says.
“At least get up and be presentable, Malfoy.”
*~*~*~
,” Draco murmurs into his ear. “Let’s get out of here.”
“Two weeks…” Harry murmurs, slightly louder. “Two weeks.” Again, firmer.
“She’s good, I think. She is very busy, and spends most of her time with some Ravenclaw girls.” Not an outright lie, she has been with Ravenclaw girls. I think. Potter considers this for a second nods.
“Two weeks… until what?” Hermione asks, although the lack of shine in Harry’s eyes is enough for me to realise exactly what he is saying.
Draco freezes. He’d hoped they wouldn’t address that. Wishful thinking. “If I remember correctly,
After a whole day of trying to pick apart wards—desperately looking for anything like Anti-Apparition ones—Draco is worn out. Not only were those not present, but neither were any
“You were a fucked up boy, a worse teenager, but you’re a
Madam Hooch blows her whistle, signalling the end of the match. Everyone flies down to the ground and shakes hands. Most of Gryffindor is gracious in their loss, of course, but some aren’t. It’s evident in their eyes, even if they hide it on their faces. Potter’s hand clasps around my own, and he shakes it firmly. There is sweat dripping down his face and through his hair. He smells like cypress wood, shea butter, and amber. I can see my reflection in his crystal green eyes and notice my mess of hair. He looks at me weirdly, and I realise I’m staring and still gripping his hand. He smiles softly before saying, “Nice one, Malfoy. I had no chance of getting to it.” I smile and nod away his congratulations.
“St- Stop, Potter,” he says breathlessly.
Harry finds the basket first, calling Draco over. It’s beautiful, hand-woven with ribbons winding through the bamboo. Draco’s heart clenches as he sees the two presents, sitting side-by-side in the tiny basket. He takes the moment, hidden from his mother by the tree, to kiss Harry gently. Harry’s hands rise up to his jaw, holding him in place for a second. When he pulls away, Harry smiles at him so sweetly he can’t think for a moment.
something I talk about.
His eyebrows come down, head tilting. “Malfoy, wait.”
“I do believe that’s my job.”
“Mr Potter,” she says, turning to shake Harry’s hand.
Malfoy immediately makes his way to the back of the store, and starts looking through the books there. Harry takes a second to gaze around the room, admiring the shop’s interior. It’s filled with ceiling-tall shelves, all packed to the brim with colourful books. The floor is carefully carpeted, footprints lasting only a second before melting away into the cream coloured carpet. The counter at the front of the store is on pale wooden floorboards, with a red rug placed beneath it. Harry blinks, spotting a coffee table off to the corner. His mind automatically remembers the mishap this morning, and feels his cheeks warm.
Malfoy sounds tired and defeated, like he expects Harry to belittle him. Harry’s stomach twists.
one and it worked! It came flying out of the charmed wardrobe and right into my hand.”
“That’s correct.”
I contemplate the possible changes, before giving up and listening to McGonagall’s speech.
Harry’s footsteps pound down the corridor, the noise reaching Draco’s ears easily as Harry jogs. Draco puts his book down—the one he started yesterday; it’s actually really well written for a change—and turns to look at Harry expectantly. If he’s found his present Draco will need to add
*~*~*~
Draco had felt tears prickling at his own eyes. His precious Harry, feeling so alone in the world…
Draco nods feverishly and slides his hands down Harry’s back to his waist. He loops his fingers under the band of his pyjamas and waits for Harry to nod. The second he does, he’s pulling the bottoms down over his arse.
“Where did you get that from?!” He snaps. If Potter stole it from him!
“Fettuccine Alfredo,” Harry answers, putting the remaining food into another bowl, covering it in cling wrap, and sliding it into the fridge.
,” Potter groans, and Draco’s stomach squirms at the sound, trying not to think of other ways to get him to make that noise.
Malfoy’s face darkens. “I can guess why they’d want me to die alone in the middle of nowhere. You, on the other hand…”
Draco smiles at him shyly, dropping his eyes back to Harry’s report. “This is really good. It sums everything up really nicely.”
Harry’s ears perk up. They’re worried about something not happening as planned, and it sounds time sensitive. He opens his eyes again and peeks around the tree he’s hidden behind. He scans his eyes over the people, hoping to gather any form of information. Nothing jumps out, their faces all cloaked in darkness. He does, however, notice that there’s
“Pride Month!”
could possibly mean. Fortunately for him, another Curse-Breaker turns up on the scene, one that actually works with the specifics of the curses. Draco gratefully relays his information to the dark skinned — and drop dead gorgeous — man, and walks back into the manor. He starts the slow process of checking each tile again, not wanting to risk anything happening. He’s made the mistake of trusting everything to be the same after the building was disturbed before, and he is never doing that again. So it’s back to prodding everything he touches with his wand first.
Harry pulls his hand from Draco’s hair and taps him lightly on the head. “No use telling you when I could show you.” He nudges Draco off him and onto the pillows.
. How could
Draco watches as Harry blinks his eyes open, swallows a few times. His voice is rough from sleep, dry. Draco feels kind of bad for waking him up, but needs must and what-not. “Nothing Potter, calm down.”
Draco nods, watching the dragon. It reminds him of skating, the way it floats. It also reminds of nights spent curled around Harry. “I had at least two of all of them.”
My mouth works open and close, my brain short-circuiting.
“Hmm.” The greedy bastard thinks about it, calculating in his head. “That’ll do nicely.” He nods, sliding the bottles across the counter and towards Potter. “Here you go, lad.”
“I am so sorry Draco…” he whispers. His thumbs start rubbing up and down, up and down, across my shirt-covered skin. I feel like the world is drifting away from me. Still in sight yet out of reach. My pathetic excuse of a father and his lord have destroyed my life. This is the last straw.
“And what exactly is that reasoning?”
Harry pulls away, licking his lips, and reaches for the waistband of Draco’s pants. His eyes flicker back to Draco, finding him nodding desperately again, and Harry pulls them down. Draco’s cock springs free, hitting Harry’s face. Harry would be offended, but now all he wants is to get it in his mouth. He wants to make Draco scream, after all. This is one way he can achieve that.
“I could never hate you, Draco,” he murmurs, breath warm on Draco’s skin.
“Don’t care,” Harry pants out. “As long as I can see you.”
clonked over the head, but he doesn’t stop running. He hates forests, and he wants to be out of this one as soon as possible. One thought that never crossed his mind though, is that because the forest is so thick, the snow isn’t getting anywhere near him. He could have stopped running ages ago, the second he stepped under the tree line, but instead he kept going. Harry pushes himself harder, willing his legs to carry him faster. He needs to get back to the cottage. The cottage is safe and warm. There are signs of life there, unlike the deserted and gloomy village.
“Malfoy.” Robards nods his greeting to Draco once he manages to direct his attention to what is in the room, and away from the decor. The movement wobbles Robard’s beanie, and he hurriedly pulls it back onto his head. It’s a beautiful deep blue, and perfectly acceptable given the 8 degree morning. The poor man must be freezing.
By the time dinner rolls around, they’ve achieved nothing else. Harry spent the entire afternoon with Draco on his lap, snogging him senseless. He wouldn’t have preferred any other way of spending the afternoon, even if the day is now completely wasted.
“Lovely to see you boys getting along,” Jenkins smiles at us from behind her immaculate desk, and the unusual expression nearly makes Draco choke. “Now, I am sure that you have both been briefed, and are ready to start. Tell me if I’m wrong?”
Draco takes a hesitant step towards his boyfriend, feeling the freezing water slide up his foot. He breathes in a sharp intake, but walks in further. The water is at his shin when he reaches Harry, who whips him into a comforting embrace. Harry’s head fits perfectly next to Draco’s, and they breathe each other in for a minute.
Draco blushes furiously, averting his gaze, before muttering, “Blaise thinks I’ve liked you for three years…”
!” Draco cries, arms clawing at Harry’s back and trying to encourage said movement.
“Thank you, Harry.”
Malfoy scoffs from metres below Harry, blowing the hair out of his face. Well, trying. It ends up stuck in the mud on his face. “I fell into this death trap is what happened.”
Harry wipes his bloody hand against his sweatpants and proceeds to quickly heal it. He’s had plenty of experience handling minor cuts and injuries, and while it is entirely possible that it could scar, it shouldn’t become infected or continue bleeding over everything. Harry shakes his head at himself and casts a shield charm, before he leans forward again to continue his work. He examines the rubble, eyes sharp and steady. When he hasn’t come up with anything, he rocks back and stands up slowly. His legs feel unsteady beneath him, and he shakes them out harshly. He pulls his wand from his hoodie pocket and spells the wall back together.
, we, because we are working this case together,” Draco says. “What else could I possibly have meant?”
I glower at her. “I may have been raised by a psychotic father who wants to help a void of a man commit genocide, but yes I know Muggle science.” I pause, wanting to add something to soften my tone. “Also, it helped keep me occupied while I was trapped in my room.” I especially enjoyed the psychology books, but I don’t see the need to mention that.
“Potter?” Malfoy’s voice is calm but unsure, and when Harry wrenches his gaze from his lips he sees worried eyes.
Without speaking, Potter shifts away and hastily pulls them down and completely off. He then throws them over his shoulder somewhere and does the same to Draco’s. Draco wants to chastise him for throwing his expensive leather pants onto the floor, by can’t find the words when he sees Potter naked. His tan skin continues the whole way down from his chest to his feet. He has a cock that makes Draco’s mouth water with need, the perfect length and width, and a lovely colour. His black hair is trimmed neatly into a small circle around the base, and all Draco can think about is taking it into his mouth.
Harry chuckles again. “I’ve also got coffee ready for you if you get up.”
“You have a thing for me begging, don’t you?” He asks, tipping his head back and offering his neck.
Draco sighs, places his finger over the part he’s up to, and turns to look at Harry properly. The sunlight hits his hair and it shines beautifully, and Harry has to tear his eyes away from it in order to focus. “What have you been thinking about?”
“We don’t have the time to discuss this,” Lupin says. His voice is amplified to fill the room, the outcome of a very strong Sonorous charm. “We need to keep moving,” he announces before disabling the spell. There’s no room for argument, and the army starts moving towards the elevators.
“Of course I do, you daft prat!” Harry says, squeezing his hand firmly. “It’s a masterpiece.”
“Yeah. You mentioned that you wanted her out with you.”
Draco dreams of Christmas with his mother. He dreams of sitting on a balcony in the Manor, with a tray of tea and cakes. She smiles at him, tells him to get over himself in the politest way possible. She takes his hand in hers, presses her mouth to, and puts it down to pat it. That’s the closest they ever get to affection or reassurance.
Nott’s eyes widen, his face paling. “D-days?” He mumbles. “How many?”
“You’re probably right,” Harry agreed. He walked over to the Dark walnut dining room, and shouldered on his backpack. Draco quirked an eyebrow at the excessive bag, and Harry shrugged at him.
Mother’s hand finds my hair, and she runs her fingers through it. “I’m here, Draco. Very much present, dear.” Her own tears fall out of her eyes, but I pointedly ignore the wetness I feel against my cheek. We don’t talk about things like this, so I don’t want to scare her off by acknowledging it. I might not be able to cope with that either.
“Mor—
Harry chuckles behind me, and he slots his chest to my back carefully. I shift my wings again, allowing him to not be slapped in the face every time they twitch. “Very well Dray,” Harry corrects. “Thank you for agreeing to this. Sleeping here,” he adds when I make a grunt of confusion.
Draco spends the rest of the day wrapped in a hoodie with the sleeves pushed up and a paintbrush in his hand. The hoodie came from the closet in the bedroom, and Draco doesn’t remember ever seeing it before. It’s definitely not his. The fact it smells kind of like Potter is irrelevant, and plays absolutely no part in him wearing it.
to hold and smooth over and kiss. And he will, one day—hopefully.
His lips meet Draco’s and it feels like fire. It feels like his skin has been set alight with fireworks and sparks. His lips tingle, his hands pushing into soft hair. It’s also water though. It’s drinking when starched, diving into the ocean on a summer day. It’s a scalding hot shower with hands slipping over skin. Draco moans under his mouth, and Harry slips his tongue between his lips.
“What
“What do you mean?”
to make himself worthy, but doesn’t want to think about it too strongly.
“Merlin! You’re freezing! Why didn’t you say anything?” I shrug his worry off and tell him that I don’t even feel cold. He doesn’t believe me however, and soon has cast multiple warming charms around both of us. I exhale slowly, and he takes that as thanks. Potter reaches forward and picks up one of his books, flipping open to a page that he marked. He catches my gaze and shrugs.
“Can’t.” He manages to pant out. “Will come too soon.”
Draco nods. “I’m not sure why, as technically it should be exactly the same—especially on this end—but it does show up.”
“In class I’ve been sitting by myself so I can concentrate, and you’ve been sitting with the Ravenclaw girls at meals. I wasn’t going to sit with them.”
“And?”
“Oh Draco, that was what Lucius wanted, not me. I always thought that was old-fashioned.”
“Did you bring money?” Malfoy asks, a pale eyebrow rising up his face.
She looks surprised, but somewhat pleased. “Take a seat, I’ll bring someone out in a little while.” She goes back to reading, making no move to get anyone at all. Draco doesn’t comment on it though, certain she’ll figure something out eventually.
Draco rushes through the corridors, twisting and turning and moving his gaze away from anyone else he happens to pass. The dark walls glow and he shakes his head, willing his vision to accustom to the light. By the time he gets into the correct room—and honestly, why wasn’t he told which room to go to—he’s out of breath and slightly flushed.
“She’s in a room upstairs, sleeping deeply.” His voice cuts through the silence and startles me. “I saw you looking, thought that’s what you might’ve been thinking,” he shrugs at me. I narrow my eyes at how easily he figured my thoughts out, but decide it’s ultimately not worth pondering over. We have always paid lots of attention to each other.
Potter instantly rolls over onto his back, tilting his head to look down at Draco in confusion.
“We’re pretty good, thanks,” Malfoy replies, and Harry’s not sure that’s 100% true. Not many people would feel this good after being forcibly removed from their lives and dumped into a not-so-abandoned area. “What about you?”
We lapse into silence, neither comfortable nor uncomfortable. I take this time to really look around at my work. The walls are stripped bare to reveal an off-white colour beneath, the removed carpet showing floorboards that are in a fairly decent condition despite their age, and the lack of dust and debris makes the room seem bigger and brighter. The only current problem needing fixing is that there is no bed.
Harry walks over to the door and opens it, holding it out for both Ron and I to cross through before following us out. Harry’s hand finds it’s resting place on my lower back once again, and he presses into me to direct me back down the stairs and into the drawing room. A month ago I would have kicked him and tried to get away; it’s amazing how quickly things can change.
He takes a breath, trying to keep calm. This isn’t going to work if he strangles Harry first. “I’m not so sure you do.”
“Feel better now you’ve got some new books?” He prods at Malfoy’s ribs, teasing him gently.
He pours his coffee into a normal mug—he’d cleaned them all last night after Malfoy went to bed, as funny as the snowman and Santa mugs were, he didn’t fancy a repeat—and breathes in the fumes. He loves the scent of coffee, actually enjoying smelling it more than drinking it. Unlike Malfoy, who would permanently have a mug in his hands if he could. Harry wonders when he found that out about Malfoy, but quickly pushes the thought away. If there’s one thing Harry’s learnt about
We work through the remainder of the steps, and eventually it’s simmering on the ‘stove’. I don’t see why we couldn’t magically cook it, but Harry wanted to do it the muggle way. Something about preserving the taste. I pull two bowls out of the cupboard along with the cutlery, and walk the long trek over to the dining room. Realising last minute that I really should’ve charmed the glasses to follow me, I scowl. I’ll have to do two trips. The dining table is massive, with torches in a line down the middle. Despite the muggle electricity Harry claims is in place in the house, it refuses to move the candles. Harry complains about it to no end. I set the table, or rather the two seats opposite each other at the end closest to the entrance, and leave. It may be better than the entrance way, but it is still dusty, and no amount of charms or manual labour can remove it. I’ve tried.
“Because.”
Harry shrugs on the red hoodie Draco had taken from him a week ago. It hasn’t been washed, and the smell of Draco is strong. He melts into it and allows himself to be happy for a moment. This isn’t something he normally indulges in, so he breathes in and closes his eyes. Draco would kill him if he saw Harry right now, but the thought only makes Harry happier. His heart stutters and then beats quickly, his chest lighting up.
“Two weeks until my father and his
“Well, that was… useful.”
Malfoy drops the whole lot of groceries into the basket and loops it over his elbow. He nods to the next aisle, and Harry shakes his head but follows all the same.
Fear boils down Draco’s veins. If Harry has found his paintings, he might have found the one meant to be

in the kitchen. Food is a fruit salad with toast, same as mine was.”
when you look like Lucius.”
It’s so bloody cold, and Draco is sick of everything. The bottom of the hole is just as miserable as it was yesterday, and the day before that. Draco wants to give up and just dig himself a grave and lie in it, but without his wand that would take too much energy. Besides, if he
Harry grins. “To make sure he doesn’t see what I’m about to do.”
“I thought I’d lost you,” I finally concede. A tear tracks down my cheek, leaving behind a shining trail.
Draco chews his cheek. “Well,
“Shouldn’t that make it perfect? Strength and endurance against the evil spirits?” I shake my head at him.
Harry scoffs, dropping his chest onto Draco’s and crushing him under his weight. He pulls him into a fierce kiss, teeth clashing with the force of it. The pain should make him wince, but it just increases the fervour.
Harry moves forward, ducking behind the Cabinet and pulling the hidden compartment open. He slides back out of the way, heart pounding in his chest as Draco takes his place. He watches with wide eyes and sweaty palms as Draco carefully puts the items inside, and then waves his wand again. He pulls on the blue magic, the gold looping them all together like knitting wool. Draco swallows hard as they successfully meld together, and a wash of blue light spills forth from them.
“I’m so close,” Draco says, tipping his head back so Harry can latch onto it again. He does, tongue swirling over his skin even as his hips grind filthily down on Draco’s.
Harry,” Draco says, teeth closing around it.
“Well, technically we are going in order to study ‘how butterbeer is like making potions’ or something,” he raises his voice an octave and signs air quotes with his fingers. Harry nods at Weasley and informs him that we are nearly done.
