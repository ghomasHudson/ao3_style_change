“I suppose it’s always an emergency, with the urgency of our investigation,” Malfoy commented, “But I don’t have any new crucial information. I’ve just been home alone all day with thoughts and speculations swarming through my brain, and you are the only one I can talk to.”
“I’ve been instructed to have all Aurors leave the building, Ms. Bloom,” Harry said, as professionally as he could, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any authority to go against direct instructions from the Aurors.”
“Harry…” she trailed off as she noticed his sudden anger, “Don’t be mad! We have no proof to believe these rumors!”
By the look Draco gave him, he knew that Harry was only trying to distract him, but he obliged anyway, standing up and following Harry to the dance floor.
Harry choked on the sip of water he was drinking, “Excuse me?”
“Albus Severus Potter!” Harry yelled from the bottom of the stairs, “If you and Rose don’t get down here now, you’re not going!”
“Cast ‘Protego Maxima’!”
“Dad? Can I talk to you?”
Harry nodded, “Of course, Aviary,” he turned to look at Draco, “Draco and I have been working together for months on the Imperius attack case.”
Harry began to think, without meaning to, about Malfoy. He had been raised in a similar situation and had been an arse for most of his youth. Harry now pictured the Malfoy he had recently befriended as an adult. What did it take to become a new person? And even as a thought in the back of Harry’s mind became to question whether change was really entirely possible, he couldn’t help but believe Malfoy wasn’t the same person and never would be again.
“Why can’t we go through the fireplaces?” Harry asked.
Harry turned to Ida angrily, “What does that mean?”
“Harry!” she looked as if she had been crying for hours, “Ginny is looking for you. She’s wondering if you are done with your statement.”
“We love you, mommy!” Lily burst.
“I thought we would be more comfortable up here, farther away from the main hall,” Harry stated. This room was the one they had spent the most time redecorating when they were renovating the house after the war. It was completely modernized, any trace of Black memorabilia gone.
“I really wouldn’t expect anything less, Malfoy,” Harry said, standing up regretfully from Murr to look at Malfoy.
Draco’s eyes widened as he realized something, “But Ron and Padma do.”
“Dad, things won’t be normal,” Al said, “You’re dating Mr. Malfoy.”
What did this say about Seb? He made Harry feel a way he hadn’t felt in a long time; completely understood and loved unconditionally. Isn;t that what he should be looking for, not the unreliable enigma that was Draco Malfoy?
“Hiya, sweetheart,” Harry said as he and Lily were wrapped in Rose’s arms. Smiling down at his niece, he felt like the world was making more and more sense.
“Mate, that’s fantastic,” Ron said, standing up and going to sit at Harry’s side, “And I mean that.”
“No worries, my dear!” Molly exclaimed, “You will be missed, but we understand the importance of opportunity.”
“Well, as much as I would love to hear you two talk about magical creatures for the next couple hours,” Malfoy said, turning to his wife and child, “I need to start this interview sometime today.”
“I still don’t want to place any bets,” Seamus glanced wearily over at Angelina, who was now talking with Bill and Lavender, “But I do think the Cannons will win. Don’t tell Angie. Blaise thinks so too,” he added as an afterthought, as if that confirmed the merit of his statement.
“Well, thanks for that,” Harry muttered, trying not to laugh himself, “Now just tell me about the stakeout.”
Seb nodded, “I understand. Of course I understand. I just..”
Then she stood up and made her way to the house, tree sweater reforming around her with a touch of a wand.
“What?” she asked.
Harry shrugged, “Probably not. But we’ve always made our own rules, haven’t we?”
“You’re right,” Harry took a large breath and turned away from his friends to face the fireplace once again, “Ministry of Magic, Brutus Savant’s office!”
“Where do we go to get away from the monster I call my aunt?” he said.
“Ida…” Harry began.
“Can I ask a question?” Harry needled.
“You can’t move at all?” Lily asked, her eyes wide.
“Let’s start with our family,” she said, “One of the oldest pureblood families in the world. By having the fortune of being born into such a prized family, I also gained the right to take over an organization my family has run for generations. My dear ina and ama decided about ten years ago that it was time to pass on Kareach to a new generation. Out of our family, which stretched across continents, Aries and I were clearly the two most viable options. It was decided that I would move to England, assimilate myself into wizarding society, and run the operation with Aries. After the fall of Voldemort, it was up to us to bring to life the ideals that supposedly died with him. Because of us, Kareach as grown to occupy purebloods from all over the world.”
“Harry, dear, food is almost ready!” Molly said over the sound of the loud argument between Ron and Ginny, “Ron, Ginny, you are adults!” she snapped. Turning back to Harry, she smiled, “Would you mind setting the table?”
“Thanks Ida,” Harry said, giving her a look that he hoped conveyed his gratitude. She looked weary for a moment, but then she gave him a soft smile that lit up her eyes.
“You’ve given him at least twenty ‘one more minutes’,” James informed him from his side. James was holding Lily who was squirming frantically in his grasp.
“Ron,” Padma snapped, “That’s circumstantial evidence. You know we have no proof he was involved. People can change, you know. Just take Nott.”
“I understand,” Healer Patrick said sympathetically, “However, now that you all know she is okay, I’m going to need you to clear out to give her the space she needs to recover.”
“Harry?” Aviary wondered, “Are you going to finish talking?’
Ginny nodded and said nothing. Then she enveloped him in a hug that reminded him of the hugs she would give him their first years of marriage. When their relationship was still new and filled with laughter and promise. When they thought there was nothing more to love than being with someone who brought you joy. The truth was, Ginny would always bring him joy. She would always be a huge part of his life. But maybe he needed to open his heart up to what brings him real euphoria. Whether that involved therapy and/or Draco, he did not know. What mattered was that he was now ready to find out.
Harry knew in this moment there was no more denying that Ida did it. Despite the fact everything about the truth felt wrong to him, he trusted Aviary. The seriousness and pure anger enforced in her words left little doubt in Harry’s mind that she could have been imagining Ida being the murderer.
“Hello!” Seb said brightly, “Mind if I sit?” he gestured at the chair across from Harry.
“Oh, Harry, you’re right,” Hermione said, “And I do wish to take a break from floo calls. I was at my desk responding to the French and Filipino ministers for hours! Thank goodness Ida was there to help. She took a break from her work to help me answer all of Janika's questions. I’ve been meaning to learn more Filipino due to all the times Janika calls. She is a very active minister and it would be much easier to take her owls without worrying about where Ida is at the moment.”
Draco obliged half-heartedly by letting Harry pull him away. The light streaming from the cracks in the stands made Draco’s face look mysterious and almost regal in the half-darkness, making Harry’s stomach do an unhelpful turn that distracted him from their conversation. Draco looked momentarily caught off guard. He stared at Harry for a second, then shook his head in anger.
He had been a disaster the night before. After the man, a bloke named George, had shown him to his room, Harry had collapsed on the floor in a fit of tears, blubbering to a complete stranger about how he had lost his kids, the love of his life and his friend all in one day. George had let him cry himself out before telling him he wasn’t in a position to give life advice. When George left, Harry sat in complete silence on the floor, thinking about how much he had fucked up. More than anything, he was replaying his kiss with Seb. Everything about it had felt wrong, out of place. For a brief moment, Harry had thought maybe being with Seb would solve all his problems. Seb was someone his family would support. It would make adjusting to the divorce and his new life much easier to have such a bright presence at his side. But maybe what Harry needed wasn’t a bright presence. Maybe what he needed was Draco. Not that that was ever going to happen. If Harry had learned anything in the past week, it was that he and Draco just weren’t a viable option now, or maybe ever.
The alarm began to blare a Celestina Warbeck song (Ginny says her hatred of the artist motivates her to get out of bed and shut the bloody thing off. They had a muggle alarm clock that Ginny spelled so that it only can be shut off by hand, not magic. It’s the only way she can get up). Ginny’s head shot up a second later, as she is anything but a heavy sleeper. She sprang out of bed, red hair flying wildly behind her, and slammed her fist down on the clock.
As Molly pulled back and gave Harry a small smile, Harry felt his heart give a tug. Through all of this mess, Harry couldn’t help think about the other thing in his life causing him extreme pain. He could hardly look Molly in the eye. He couldn’t break her daughter’s heart. Or the hearts of his entire family, from his in laws to his own children. Draco wasn’t that important to him. But a part of him nagged, what if happiness was?
Moments later, Harry, Aviary and Draco landed in front of Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Or, as what the muggles, Draco and Aviary saw, an empty alley between Number 11 and Number 13 Grimmauld Place.
“Harry,” Molly continued, softer this time, “I do not blame you for accusing Mr. Zabini. Although I do believe you should have talked to my daughter about it, especially due to their, uh, situation, it sounds as though you were trying your hardest to solve the case. Ron told me that the Aurors had reasonable doubt for them to question Mr. Zabini. And while Ginny is still upset with you, I think she is beginning to realize that she can’t hold this against you forever.”
Harry sat on the couch, waiting for Ginny to get home. He was trying to control his nerves by baking, a pleasure he hadn’t had time for in months, but it was to no avail. Harry hadn’t told Ginny he had been with the kids and Molly all day as she was at meeting after meeting, trying to figure out how to best move forward with quidditch after the fiasco that was her last match. He was planning on talking to her, really talking to her, as soon as she arrived. Maybe it was too soon, but talking to Molly and James had made him realize that anytime spent fighting with Ginny was detrimental to themselves and their family. She deserved a long apology and explanation from him. She deserved to know, as clearly as he could express, that none of what happened was out of spite.
With a shaking hand, Draco lifted his hand to card his fingers through the unruly locks. Harry jerked up at his touch, expression a mix of relief and fear.
Harry shot him another worried look, wiping his dirty hands on his filthy pants before grimacing. Extracting his wand, Harry cast a cleaning charm on himself, banishing the abundance of soil clinging to his person, before moving inside.
Hawthorn for cleansing and defence.
“He can flip pancakes in the air.
Six months.
Asshole.
Every time the were together, Draco could feel his hurts healing. There was something about being in Harry’s company that made him better. He began sleeping again. The kids even noticed that he was eating more, was present more often, the weight of grief and self-recrimination lightening. Lily and Cassie became inseparable, a scarily intelligent duo that he knew would take Hogwarts by storm once the summer was over.
Yuri conceded defeat with poor grace, darting off to steal Milas’ drink while he raged. Suddenly Draco was being pulled onto the dancefloor by Potter. He acquiesced easily, something in the freedom of Potter’s movement, even with the drunken disorderly behaviour, called to him. Draco was well past tipsy, alcohol buzzing through his veins and making his head feel light. They started off with an upbeat salsa, Potter's shirt gaping open and his jacket quickly discarded.
The manor was empty without Cassie and Scorpius to fill it with their life and noise. Draco worked tirelessly to distract himself. He tried to stay away from Harry, but knowing the other man was rattling around Grimmauld Place on his own too made it difficult. Draco was falling so desperately in love with the other man that all he wanted to do was be with him, always. Unfortunately, he was also deeply afraid that the curse would claim Harry if they spent too much time together. Already the curse had claimed Astoria when it shouldn’t, he was terrified that it would claim Harry before the end. Draco knew that he would not survive his heart breaking if he lost Harry, and so he tried to stay away.
“Of course mère.” He stood, working to maintain the regal bearing his father had been teaching him. He settled himself down primly next to her, taking in her sad smile as she brushed the hair from his face.
He will hum my favourite song.
The man's expression was hazy yet determined as he yanked the god awful tie from his neck and stalked over to Yuri. They couldn't hear the conversation, the music was a little too loud and a little too upbeat now that all the older attendees had left. It was an unspoken agreement that all of the young skaters would show up for the schmoozing and dinner, provided that the older people would leave them to their after party. The skaters worked hard and had limited opportunities for downtime. The competition was over, the medals handed out and tomorrow they would all be returning to their home rinks to prepare for the next competition. But for tonight, they were free.
His favourite shape will be a star.
His eyes stopped on Harry, who was lingering by the gap where they had entered the glade, his expression filled with love and affection. Draco was unable to resist the blush that crept up his cheeks. His heart yearned to take the other man in his arms, to profess his love, but fear kept him back. Fear that the curse would take something this precious from him when he was so close to having it. Fear that he would take James and Albus and Lily’s father away from them.
Draco exchanged a worried look with Snape. “What is it father?”
Somehow, he survived.
Everything passed in a blur after that. The numbness invading his chest once move as he watched the healer cast diagnostics, confirming that the cause of death was an accidental fall from the top of the stairs resulting in blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Once Astoria had been cleaned up and moved, by the house elves, to the private mourning room in the manor, Draco went to Cassie who was still playing happily under the watchful eye of Dippy.
He did tell her about the family curse, but assured her that while he might grown to feel affection for her, as she was a woman he would never be
Draco and Harry could only laugh at their antics shuffling the kids along to the floo so they could all disappear through with their luggage. Draco went first, ensuring that no one got lost on the way, though he felt uncomfortable leaving Harry on the platform to disapparate on his own, waiting anxiously for the wards to twinge and let him through after James tumbled out of the fireplace.
He glanced up to see pained understanding in Harry’s eyes. “She waited for her lover to rescue her, but he never came. No one came. In a moment of despair, on All Hallows Eve, she cast powerful wish magic upon herself so that she would never again feel the agony of love.”
He’ll be marvellously kind.
Regards,
Draco took another sip of tea. “As her bitterness grew, the spell turned into a curse, a curse on any who dared to love a Malfoy. I initially believed that only romantic love would be counted as a part of the curse. So while I loved Astoria, I was never in love with her. We had a marriage of convenience, but we became very good friends over the years.” His expression turned wistful as he remembered the good times.
Draco hated how much Harry glowed with his pregnancy, hated how in love with their unborn baby he was. It felt like Harry was willingly walking to his death, walking away from everything they had built together. He found himself unable to touch the swell of Harry’s stomach, leaving the room when Harry spoke gently to the babe. Harry noticed; of course, how could he miss the anguish that Draco was suffering under? But beyond calm reassurances that everything would be ok, Harry only watched him with patient eyes.
Healer Taylor tried to help, tried to get them talking about their feelings over the new baby. Unfortunately, Draco broke down in tears when the healer pressed too hard and Harry asked that she never raise the topic again.
“Draco? Draco!”
“If there is anything you need, let me know. Our boys are friends, and while we might not have been when we were kids, we are adults now and I am willing to put all of our history aside.”
The children as a whole are stunned, trading glances between Draco and Harry. Draco knew that his fear and worry were leaking out, carving into his face, while Harry was calm and quiet.
about his
“We have to get rid of it.”
"Will you be alright to come to King's Cross?" Draco pressed, worried.
“Draco, please.” Lucius lurched up, attempting to catch him in a hug but Draco shied away.
Occasionally Draco would have to interact with Potter in a public setting. They had been cordial since the end of the war and while he had grown to harbour a secret flame for the other man, he would never consider taking it further. It wasn’t worth the risk.
Draco could only blink, astonished that the Potters, who had such a tendency for irrationality and chaos, were being so sensible. It made him want to scream.
Harry went into labour just before midday on Yule. It was a mess of fear and pain and worry as Healer Taylor was called in to help with the birth. There was less drama than with Astoria, their child cut free from Harry’s body easily. Draco could not look away from Harry’s shining green eyes through the whole thing. It felt like Harry was reassuring him with his tight grip, rather than the other way around.
It was edging uncomfortably close to September first and his hopes diminished that the curse would be removed before Cassie had to attend school for the first time and before Scorpius had to go back for his third year. Over the summer, the bond between Scorpius and Albus had only gotten stronger and Draco was deeply worried that the Curse would impact his son in some way before he could get it removed.
He was swallowed once more by the image of who he had been crafted to be, only occasionally letting what little he had left of himself out. When he skated, he could feel, but this year it wasn’t working. Next, he tried to find himself in sex. In past years it had helped, but it didn’t seem to help now either. The act was empty of affection or truth. There was only release but he was so void of everything that the act felt pointless.
He looked back at Harry once more, seeing that the love had eased, his smile a little sad around the edges before Harry turned to move back into the woods, leading them back to the manor for lunch.
“Alright, I have some excellent readings from you. I am going to have to do some research to find the best way to resolve this. I will send you an owl once I have a solution. Please be patient, these things can take time but I can assure you, I will find you a solution so neither you, nor your children have to deal with this again.” Hallet extended his hand and Draco shook it gratefully before leaving to collect his kids from Harry’s place.
“What happened?” He rasped.
Lucius had told her the old story after they had wed and were trying for a child. He had thought it an amusing anecdote, but Narcissa was a Black, and Black’s knew the power of scorned women, knew the power of blood. So, she searched through the Malfoy family histories and found an alarming truth. One of every generation was cursed, irrespective of gender, their partner would die after producing an heir.
The hot press of their bodies together, the slick glide and breathy whimpers were exquisite. He had a momentary flash of green eyes and black hair as he looked down at Chris where he was pressed into the mattress but shook it off quickly. Draco took pride in being a good lover, even if there was no emotional attachment he was still quite capable of wringing pleasure from his partner.
"The curse…" James began, trailing off, and Harry smiled beatifically
“What do you mean mummy is dead? I saw her a few hours ago!” Her voice was shrill and Draco flinched when she shoved herself our of his lap.
“I know. You should have believed.” Draco replied, missing Snape’s wide eyed stare as he also sat in his chair.
Draco had been skating for his entire life, he had been born into it with his prima ballerina mother and figure skating father. His first memories were of being on the ice, his father relentlessly pushing him to do more, to be better, to go again. He had been shaped, over years, into a sculpture, the Prince of the Ice.
“I’m sorry Scorp.” He eventually rasped out. “I was wrong.”
“She is dead because of you.” His eyes were grey chips as he glared up at his father. “If you will excuse me, I have homework.”
Currently, he enjoyed casual sex with Chris whenever the chance presented itself, like now, for instance. They had just arrived for the World Championship and tomorrow they were both due to get back into their relentless training schedules. But for tonight, they were granted a little freedom.
“The optimal time would be Beltane. I know it is a little away, but considering the curse was placed on All Hallows Eve, I believe we need the boost to make sure that the ritual takes.” Hallet’s expression was sympathetic when Draco deflated.
Harry was wan and pasty looking, utterly pathetic as he accepted the glass so he could rinse and spit.
Blinking out of his reverie, Draco looked up, realising how close they were when he could see little flecks of blue and gold in Harry’s green eye. He spread his palm out over Harry’s chest, covering the tattoo and his heart.
“Her as her bitterness grew, the spell turned into a curse, a curse on any who dared to love a Malfoy. It is believed that only romantic love would be counted. You know I loved your mother very much, but I was never in love with her. I thought she was safe. I am so sorry Cassie, your mother passed away this morning.” He felt tears slip down his cheeks, unable to look his daughter in the eye, guilt overwhelming him.
It was bliss, perfection, unlike anything Draco had ever felt before. Harry was wearing the same robes that he was, which made it easy to slip his hand up Harry’s thigh to grip his bare hip. Harry moaned, rocking into him and causing their thickening cocks to brush together.
Hallet then stepped back, allowing them to work quietly through the list. Occasionally he would murmur the instructions, reminding them of what was next but otherwise, the silence was soothing.
She of course agreed and wished him luck.
"Have you participated in any rituals in the past few months?" She asked.
The idea sparked something tucked away in his heart, the desperate yearning in Potter's gaze filling him with fire.
The banquet was yet another tedious event. His mother and father lingering nearby to ensure that he behaved, that his smile remained fixed, that he obeyed. He had been wearing the mask of Ice Prince for so long that he was unsure who he was underneath it. Draco was polite and charming, easy-going and intelligent. Not only had he been trained in the art of figure skating, ballet and ballroom, but he had been taught by the best tutors that France had to offer. He could speak English as easily as he could French, he could also speak Spanish, Italian and conversational Russian. He had a bachelors degree in business from Paris Sciences et Lettres.
It was a week later that Draco met with the cursebreaker, Hallet. The other man was middle aged and rather weathered but was professional and soothing. He had Draco settle down in a small consulting room at Gringotts and explain the story one more time. Draco expressed his concerns that his children would already bear the curse and that he desperately needed it removed so that none of them would have to suffer again.
He had watched the other competitors, of course. You never knew what someone could be hiding, and felt his heart tug for the rookie Englishman. Harry Potter. The pressure crushed the other man during his free skate, as so often happened. Seeing the devastation in the other man’s liquid green eyes though, was saddening. He’d had such grace and conviction in his skating, but Draco had seen the hesitation before every jump, had seen how his heart wasn’t on the ice. Unfortunately, not everyone thrived on competition.
“My condolences.” The man offered his hand.
“I have to ask…” Draco trailed off after breaking the silence, his eyes tracking over Harry’s changed face.
Half an hour drifted by before Hallet stopped.
Draco blanched, Harry could only blink. "Excuse me?"
“Yes, thank you.” Draco replied, standing on shaky legs before settling into one of the chairs by the table.
"There was a curse on my family. On May first, a cursebreaker helped end the curse. Harry arrived at the end of the ritual and helped… finalise the breaking." Draco offered after a few beats.
He had to know this man, had to know the story of this broken angel. He was compelled to know what pain was hidden behind those emerald green eyes. He was contemplating how to insinuate himself into the other man’s life when he felt a body collide with his own. Looking down, he soon lost himself in shimmering green eyes and wild inky hair. He surrendered to the desire to run his fingers through the mess, knowing that Potter was probably too drunk to care and almost moaned at how thick and silky it was.
He was approached about two years after the war by Lord Greengrass. The man expressed an interest in creating a union of their families, to strengthen the business ties they already had. His youngest daughter, Astoria, was willing to marry.
“I don’t blame them, you have some great kids there Harry.” Draco offered with a soft smile.
They panted, magic sparking off their skin, little lights dancing in the air around them.
Suddenly Healer Taylor moved into his field of vision, a swaddled bundle in her arms. Harry’s eyes snapped towards it, accepting the bundle gently.
Harry trailed off, looking away, shifting awkwardly here he was straddling Draco’s hips. Draco could only think of one thing to do, so he reached out, wrapping a hand around the back of Harry’s neck to pull him down and into a searing kiss. Harry gasped and moaned, Draco taking advantage to plunge his tongue into Harry’s mouth.
He strode into the school, taking the familiar route to the Great Hall. The hall was filled with students, chatting over breakfast. His eyes roamed over the hall, taking in McGonagall rising from the head table. As silence rippled out from him, like a pebble dropped in a pool, he spotted Scorpius lurching to his feet at the Slytherin table, Albus beside him.
He was sitting down to dinner when his father strode into the hall. He was as immaculately dressed as ever, but Draco immediately knew that something was wrong. While his hair had been tried back neatly, it was dirty. There were dark smudges under his fathers eyes, and a sallowness to his skin.
Harry never offered.
Lucius and Snape both looked at him with wide eyes.
Draco believed for the first time that the curse had truly been broken and that their daughter was a gift from Magic. Life from death as Lily had said so many months ago.
Two mornings later, Draco, Cassie and Scorpius tumbled out of the floo into Grimmauld Place. The whole place was fresh and alive, Albus and Lily were bouncing by the fireplace and immediately latched onto his children and dragged them off. He trailed after them, discovering that they were leading him to a generously proportioned, old fashioned kitchen.
He desperately wanted Scorpius to have, to take what was right there. Albus and Scorpius deserved to be happy together, to have their chance. Draco’s grey eyes flicked back to Harry to see that same look on his face. Their fingers brushed together, sending sparks rippling up his arm.
Harry’s expression softened and he reached out to card a hand through Draco’s hair. “The curse broke, we both felt it. I will not die, my love. Magic blessed us with a child, why would she take away our joy?”
And then Harry moved.
“Draco, after this season ends, my family runs a BnB, so please come!" Potter slurred; eyes glassy. "If I win this dance-off, will you become my coach? I would give anything to learn from you."
something was very wrong. He flashed back to that quiet conversation he had had with his mother a little more than a year ago. It had been such an odd conversation, so very out of the blue that he had never been able to forget it.
"We can go this afternoon after we pick up the kids. James can look after them while I take you to St Mungo's." Draco pushed the sweaty hair plastered to Harry's forehead back.
“Oh Draco,” Harry’s palm was warm where it wrapped around his hand. “Of course I will help you. I imagine you don’t want anyone to know what is going on, so I will use the utmost discretion.”
Eventually they finished, settling down quietly by their bundles as Hallet finished working on stripping them all back. The cursebreaker set down the last branch, kneeling in the centre of the glade and began quietly chanting in latin. Soon, magic began to glimmer and dance over the grass, a small ball settling a little to the man’s left, a circle appearing between where Draco and his children were space out around the man and the edge of the trees.
“She waited for her lover to rescue her, but he never came. No one came. In a moment of despair, on All Hallows Eve, she cast powerful wish magic upon herself so that she would never again feel the agony of love.”
Somehow he found himself drawn into a conversation on the technical points of the difference between a toe loop and a flip with some idiotic hanger-on who had no idea who he was. It would have been refreshing if it wasn’t so terribly irritating to have to explain it to someone who obviously didn’t care.
Afternoon tea had been served and everyone settled in the loungeroom to catch up for a little while.
They had been a few years apart at Hogwarts. Daphne, the eldest and heir to the family had been in his year. He had helped Astoria over the years as a prefect and with her homework as a fellow Slytherin. They had gotten along relatively well, as well as he did with anyone else from his house.
The thought echoed through his head for weeks after his mother’s funeral. He never wanted to condemn someone to an early death. He never wanted to do what his father had to do.
“Draco.” Was all he had time to say before Scorpius and Albus arrived.
“Thank you Dippy, you may return to your duties.”
“Of course Lucius, anything you need. I am sorry for your loss.” Snape murmured.
Draco’s heart ached.
“No, you promised!” Scorpius extracted himself from the table, darting towards him, Albus in tow.
Hallet stood moving to stand over the little ball of light and removing his wand. He began chanting a different pattern, wand swirling in a clockwise motion as it pointed at the ground. Earth began carving itself out, creating a little hollow where the ball of light was and, when Draco glanced over his shoulder, he could see a channel being carved in the earth under the ring of light behind him. The earth trickled away, spreading itself over the glen and leaving behind the freshly dug divot and circle.
He finished the routine, his final pose perfectly striking. It showed off the long lines of his body and his sculpted muscles. His silvery hair slid back from his face, revealing his profile in all of its elegant glory. It had been immaculate, of course, his performances were never anything less. The sound of applause washed over him like the ocean at his mothers’ favourite beach. The soft susurrations fading into the background as he realised how empty he felt.
Dear Harry,
He was swept up in their chattering enthusiasm. Draco was astonished at how quickly children tended to recover. Then again, they weren’t dealing with self-blame and recrimination.
“I had a feeling you might say that. Anyway, once the chant is finished, the flames surrounding you should go out, indicating the ritual was successful. If the flames don’t, I’ll try repeating the chant a few times, but if that doesn’t do the trick, I will have to go back to the drawing board. This means another consult, more scans, and we try again. I am hoping that it won’t come to that, but I just want you to be aware of the possibility.” Hallet finished.
Draco groaned, pressing his face into the pillow. He had not slept the night before, plagued by memories of his mother and Astoria. Perhaps it was time to get another opinion on the curse, there had been a lot of developments in magic and cursebreaking since the curse had originally been inflicted. He couldn’t allow his children to go through this. They deserved a chance at happiness.
Draco looked up at his mother from where he was playing quietly with a toy wand. He was ten years old.
This particular Tuesday, he arrived later than usual, Cassie had been feeling difficult and contrary this morning, so they had breakfasted at home. The kids immediately abandoned him to find Harry on his own. Checking the kitchen first, he found it empty, the breakfast dishes washing themselves in the sink. Humming to himself, he prepared a tea tray to take out to the garden, knowing that Harry had been working on it lately.
Astoria fell pregnant a second time four years into their marriage and instead of divorcing her like her current lover had hoped, Draco embraced the child as his own, blood adopting little Cassiopeia. Astoria, of course, was furious with the lover that had potioned her to fall pregnant and had kicked the idiot to the curb, much to Draco’s amusement.
Harry ad his children departed the morning of the thirtieth. Hallet arrived at midday, as discussed. Draco, his children and the cursebreaker all trooped out to the glade that Draco had selected. Hallet was very pleased with his choice, settling his bag in the middle and handing them each a broad blade wrapped in silver.
“Thank you.” He murmured, reaching out to shake his hand.
Horror immediately washed over him. He was not in love with Astoria, he had grown to love the courageous, clever woman, but there was no romance there. The curse was only supposed to affect romantic relationships.
Her expression lightened immediately. "Well gentlemen, it seems that magic has blessed both your union and the breaking of the curse." She paused, a grin stretching across her face. "You're pregnant!"
I want you all to cut a branch of the flowering red currant that is long enough to create a crown with. Separately, I need you each to pick nine of the berries and place them in this bowl,” He offered a silver bowl, settling it in the earth of a near by garden bed, “I will crush the berries to make a paste for inscribing runes onto your skin. As with before, allow your magic to flow through you, to guide you.”
In no time at all, the pair were sitting in an examination room with Draco's family healer. Healer Taylor was frowning at the results of the comprehensive health scan he had just cast on Harry.
Well he wouldn’t make that mistake.
Harry’s distressed voice yanked him from his reverie, and he froze, staring into wide blue and green eyes. He couldn’t help but glance down, Harry’s lips perfect and pink, a light stubble shadowing his jaw line. Draco desperately wanted to kiss the other man with a passion he had never wanted anything before.
Everything was marvellously easy between him and Harry, they fit together perfectly and once more, the manor was a home, filled to the brim with laughter and life.
Draco nodded and smiled at the empty praise, keeping his expression vacant and pleasant. He accepted his Grand Prix Final gold medal for France with the grace that was expected. It was so easy to go through the motions, his mind no longer needed to participate. He was a slate and the only writing on him was from his father and mother. Draco didn’t even know what he would write, even if he had the freedom to do so.
James seemed to be the only one who shared his worries. They didn’t speak about it, there was nothing to say really. Harry was adamant that the curse was broken and the baby he bore was a blessing.
Draco could feel the tension leaving Harry’s body, arms tightening around him as Harry exhaled heavily. “Six months isn’t so long.” Harry commented lightly.
Draco had been inducted into the art of sex and skating by one of the senior skaters, Philippe, once he turned 16. The man had been thorough in his education of Draco, though the marks of his affection left scars on Draco’s heart that he refused to acknowledge. Since being with the man, Draco had never bottomed again. He was an exclusive top, as his father had clearly told him that even if he was a faggot, he at least shouldn't take it up the arse like some pansy. It had been devastating at the time to have his father speak like that to him, but over the years, Draco had become numb to it too.
“We have to get rid of it. The curse. It could kill you, I am not letting you die for this, for me. We already have a wonderful family. We don’t need another baby, Harry.” Draco shifted onto his knees before Harry, gripping his hand tightly.
This was the umpteenth time that he had woken to this and enough was enough. Harry could no longer escape the reality that he was sick and something was wrong. Filling the glass that now sat on the sink with water, Draco crouched next to his partner and waited for him to look up.
"Dad?" James' voice preceded him as he stepped into the room, handsome face creased with worry.
He could feel the magic flowing into him from Cassie and Scorpius’ hands, so he knew that the curse was lifted from them, knew that they were safe. The weight on his chest grew heavier, pressing him down into the earth until his vision began fading out around the edges.
“As her bitterness grew, the spell turned into a curse, a curse on any who dared to love a Malfoy.”
The remainder of the school year slipped by in a haze as he grappled with his grief and tried to care for Cassie on his own. He had no real family left, and the few friends he had had moved overseas following the war. He felt so very alone but was determined to do his best for his kids.
Draco exhaled as he jumped, spinning and flying through the air for his quadruple salchow.
In the months that followed, as he went from the Grand Prix Final to the World Figure Skating Championship, Draco slowly forgot about Potter. The man was like a dream, drifting away with the morning mist. He didn’t see the young man again, and after a while, he stopped looking for those green eyes or that wild hair. He won gold medals for France at every championship; the Ice Prince of France with his silver eyes, white-blonde hair, and lines that flowed like water.
In no time at all he grew to appreciate her brilliant mind and sparkling wit. He was still very gay, but Astoria was understanding, and they took potions to ease intercourse in order to produce an heir. He would take a potion to assist with performance, she to increase fertility.
“Of course,” He commented weakly, “Can you tell me anything about the ritual?”
“It claimed my mother, so I swore that I would never find love of my own. I never expected to love Astoria, I’m gay you see.” He finally explained and saw understanding light Harry’s face. “I don’t want my children to go through this. I don’t want them to be burdened by the guilt and the pain. I am hoping that maybe, a cursebreaker might be able to fix the problem.”
Al and Scorp both remained stoically neutral about the whole thing. The pair were more wrapped up in what was developing between them than anything else. They seemed to agree that the curse had been broken -Scorpius would not be pursuing Albus otherwise- but beyond that, they were teenage boys. Babies were not something the pair were interested in.
Rough hands brushed over his, wrapping around his wrists and pulling the away gently, so that Harry’s worried face came into view.
*****
He felt a mild flutter of alarm in third year when they had a class on hippogriffs, somehow, when Hagrid had hoisted Potter onto the beast, he had ended up backwards, flying around the school. Draco reminded himself that Potter didn’t fit the rest of the criteria, so dismissed the worry, accidentally getting himself hurt in the process.
and the music started. Stumbling out of his pants, shoes and socks, Potter stepped up to the pole and Draco’s mouth went dry. His thighs were thick and strong, lines perfect and clean with pointed toes the entire time. The man oozed around the pole as the heavy beat kicked in. His arse was immaculate and Draco felt the insane urge to bite it to see if the muscle was as firm as it looked.
“You never told me how the meeting with the cursebreaker went.” Harry commented as he wandered out of the room, ink stained shirt in hand.
The next minute, Yuri was stalking off and they watched, amused and horrified as Yuri plugged his own phone into the sound system and turned on… hip hop? Yuri knew nothing about hip hop. The brat threw a hissy fit whenever he had to go to ballet, let alone any other style of dance.
"Was broken." Harry finished. "The curse was broken, and magic blessed us with a child to seal the breaking."
"James, you're in charge for the next few hours," Draco instructed before the kids departed for their own rooms "I have to take Harry to St Mungo's, he's been feeling under the weather so he's having a check-up."
“Six months.” He eventually murmured. “He wants to do the ritual to remove the curse on May first, so there is another six months of waiting. I have a list of plants I need to have at the manor for the ritual.”
After a restless night, he dragged himself from bed, gathering up a listless Cassie and enlisting the elves help to have her dressed and ready to go.
Draco allowed the conversation to wash over him, grappling with his fears. Looking up, he saw the same worry reflected back in James's hazel eyes. There was little they could do. Harry wanted to keep the baby; he insisted the curse had been broken. Draco understood that they would both happily die to protect their children, but the thought that Harry might die because of him and his families curse was… Draco's heart turned cold at the thought. He would die, would waste away, if Harry died. Not even his children would be enough to keep him here without Harry by his side.
“So do you.” Harry replied.
He lurched up, darting after her as she ran, room by room around the manor. Eventually, she collapsed, sobbing in the main sitting room.  Draco approached cautiously, reaching out a trembling hand to stroke her hair as she cried. Eventually her sobs eased and she peered up at him.
It took Draco a few moments to realise what Harry was humming. It was the starting refrain from Claire de Lune. His mother would play it for him as a child and it was his favourite song. With shaking hands, he set the tray down on the little table and sank down onto the steps. Harry was still unaware, distracted by the determined rose bush, humming all the while. Draco’s heart clenched and his breath left him. The love spell from his childhood coming back to him.
“He will hear my call a mile away.
Harry barked a surprised laugh, grinning. “Yeah, she is a bit. Thankfully I never have to see her again. Because I was under the influence of Amortentia for our entire relationship, she lost all legal rights to everything. The kids, my money, everything she got when we were together immediately reverted to me. I asked the kids if they wanted to see her, but unfortunately, they hate her. She wasn’t the most loving mother and when they found out how she betrayed me, they all turned on her.”
Flowering red currant for the life and nourishment it represented. It was a hardy plant, strong enough to resist the curse. It offered a food source for spring fauna, allowing new life to spring forth.
Stumbling down the stairs, Draco collapsed next to her, frantically checking for a pulse, knowing already that the efforts would be wasted.
It took a year to plan the wedding and iron out the marriage contract; he happily left most of the planning for the event to Astoria whom he had found a fast friend in. She was very forward thinking and encouraged him to look outside the magical world for business ideas and investment opportunities.
“When is the funeral?”
“Is that why people hate us so much?” Draco queried innocently.
Oak for strength and good fortune.
He survived not murdering the Headmaster and the punishment that followed. He survived Potter turning up with his lackeys in his home and lying about their identities. He survived Potter dying, or not dying for that matter, in the forest and lying to the Dark Lord about it.
love with her.
He wished that love would stay.
The other man’s body was firm under Draco’s hands, muscles well-formed but hidden under his atrocious suit. The music switched up to a flamenco, then a pasodoble. Potter didn't miss a beat, easily switching from one to the other, just as he switched from leading to following with each turn. They didn't speak at all as they danced, the music was too loud, but their eyes connected and a spark burned between them. Draco could see longing and passion hiding in those green eyes and he was lost to it.
It felt like Draco exhaled and he was alone in the manor with Harry. It was harder to cope without the distraction of their children and Draco found himself in desperate need of a distraction. The business investments for his family were ticking along fine, so there was little to keep him busy there. Instead he reached out through his contacts; Draco had always been an excellent brewer but had never bothered to get his mastery. He found a potions supply company who were willing to take him on as a mature apprentice. In no time at all his days were filled with brewing and learning.
Draco did not suggest getting rid of the child again.
"Well, yes." Harry flushed.
“I’m sorry Cassie,” Harry turned to her, “I’ll replace the pot. Perhaps you and Lily can finish up in her room?”
“Yes please.” There was no accusation in Harry’s voice, just patience for which he was eternally grateful.
"Of course the curse was broken." Lily sniffed, nose in the air. "We were all there, we felt the magic breaking. It is only right that life should come from so much death."
“Dad? It’s time for us to pick Scorpius up from Kings Cross. Daddy come on. Out of bed sleepyhead!” Cassie crawled onto his bed, poking his cheek.
Magic was thick in the air as they stepped into the circle. The silence cracked by Hallett’s usual three claps. Their hair and robes rustled in a non-existent wind, magic tugging and curling around them. He directed them to kneel before their crowns as he softly began to chant in latin.
“We have extensive greenhouses, I can check but I wouldn’t be surprised if we had them all, or at least most of them.” Draco replied.
Once they had finished, he had them gather everything together and return to the glade. Hallet clapped three times as they stepped back within the circle, and the magic swirled around them once more. They were directed to sit in their section and begin weaving together a flower crown using what had been gathered. Their magic danced through their fingers as they worked, binding and weaving together their hopes and wishes, allowing the raw power to build and fill the circle.
One crystal clear thought penetrated his terror, and he voiced it before thinking on it at all.
Yes. This could work. He was uninspired for the next year, using up his last good idea to create the routines for this season. Now, he needed something fresh, something new. Potter called to him, and he hoped to find a new angle for next year. Inspiration could come from unexpected sources and this was definitely unexpected. He only hoped he remembered all this in the morning with the hangover he was likely to have.
“How are you doing Draco?” Harry asked gently.
“Come in Draco, take a seat, I am just finishing fixing breakfast.” Harry gestured to a spot to the left of the head of the table.
Their daughter shone with Magic’s gift.
Draco hated the gentle smile, the way he shone with the pregnancy. It made him sick to see Harry so in love with the baby. It was easier to focus on work, leaving after a quick breakfast and coming back late and tired. He had no idea what Harry did with his days, couldn’t remember the last time they were intimate or even spoke properly. It was awful to feel like an alien in his own home, but Draco couldn’t change anything. The idea of asking Harry to leave was utterly abhorrent, so they were stuck in an awful holding pattern until something gave.
“Thank you, Minerva.” He looked down, seeing Albus hovering uncertainly at the edge of their little huddle. “Al, will you help Scorp? Minerva, lead the way.”
"Did it involve intercourse?" She pressed.
“Thank you.” Was all Draco could choke out, distracted by the flutter of his hear at Harry’s touch.
The man hummed and assured him he would do everything he could. Hallet instructed Draco to sit quietly and try not to move too much while he cast a series of diagnostics. He tried, desperately to relax, to allow the magic to wash over and through him.
“Draco, thank you for meeting with me. I am sorry it took me so long to find a solution, but wish magic can be tricky.” Hallet explained.
The manor felt more alive than it ever had when Harry was there. The man was full of life and energy, breathing it into the walls and the earth. They spent hours going through the three greenhouses on the property, tracking down the different flowers that they would need and working to ensure there would be enough of everything.
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed with Astoria and Cassie, but eventually he realised that he was going to have to take a trip to Hogwarts. Scorpius had to know.
Holly for banishing malevolent spirits and the changing of the seasons.
The tone changed and the three reached out to settle the crowns around their own heads. Laying down and joining their hands, Hallet continued chanting, pacing a full circle around them between the earthen circle and their feet.
Draco’s father would murder him for wanting to take time off, but his mother might understand if he phrased it just right. He had some time to work it out still.
So they set to, On closer inspection, they found that the surrounding circle of trees had three of each, in a repeating pattern, to they picked their own Alder tree, moving clockwise as they removed small branches, allowing the magic to build around them. Each of the three Malfoy’s created their own stacks, bundles of branches in threes that Hallet would then strip of bark and twigs. Time ceased to mean anything as they worked, magic helping the children find what they need, washing over them all.
Draco looked at him in surprise before looking to where Scorpius was standing with Albus. They were quietly huddled together, the simple intimacy of knowing each other for a long time evident. As he looked closer, he could see Scorpius was holding back, could see the beginnings of the yearning he knew only too well in his son’s eyes when he looked at Albus. He caught when Scorpius looked away, and Albus gazed at his son’s profile, an expression on his face that he had caught Harry sporting occasionally. It was filled with affection, with longing, with patience.
The room went quiet for a moment and everyone stopped to watch as Potter put in a request for a song
The war happened.
Harry’s body tightened over him, magic bursting forth as he came, dragging Draco along with him. The shuddered together, skin to skin. The curse broken and a new wish filling the family line.
For a moment he thought of Potter, but he knew that Potter had green eyes, so there was no risk there.
Draco already knew that he preferred boys to girls, which was good considering he would have to marry a woman to produce an heir.
The months passed slowly as Harry swelled with their child. Lily was the most excited of their children, sharing Harry’s conviction that the curse had been broken. With a little time, she had Cass convinced as well, the pair filling the Manor with their enthusiasm for a new sibling.
"It happens occasionally, particularly with rituals, we get one every couple of years where two wizards end up having a baby together. I'll get some of the literature together for you and owl it over." She smiled, reaching out to shake their hands in stunned silence.
"There was an unforeseen side effect to the ritual you went under to break the curse." Harry sighed again, a smile curling his lips. "Magic has blessed me with another child. I am pregnant."
Slipping out of his chair, he knelt in front of Harry, who was crouched on the ground, and threw his arms around the other man. A sob wracked his body as Harry held him tightly, stroking his hair and murmuring sweet nothings into his ear.
They were shown to the room and Minerva left, granting them a modicum of privacy. Draco was astonished that neither Cassie nor Scorp actively blamed him like he did his father.  He guessed the difference was that Lucius refused to believe the curse and married the woman he loved, while he didn’t. He had grown to love Astoria, very much, but he had thought she was safe without the romantic aspect of love.
She knew she did not have much longer, Draco would be going to Hogwarts soon and the curse would drag her down. She and Lucius had fallen in love, and because of that, because she had made Draco, she knew her time was drawing to a close.
When Potter lay back on the pole, legs wrapped straight around it, toes pointed, his torso leaning down and arms stretched to the ground, his shirt finally slipped off. Lithe muscles encased in creamy skin. It was nowhere near Draco’s alabaster and silver tones, but delightful in its peach hues. It wasn’t until Potter twisted off the pole and out of the layback that the light caught the abundance of silvery scars tracing over his back and ribs that Draco’s breath caught.
“I have always loved the Draco constellation. The mythology surrounding it has always resonated with me.” Harry breathed, not moving away.
“Of course,” Hallet extracted a piece of parchment from the stack, “I would like to do the ritual at your home, where the family magic is thick and deeply embedded in the earth. Just before dawn, I would have the three of you lying down within a circle of cleansing flame, your heads in the centre and your bodies making the spokes of a wheel. You will be dressed in robes of simple white linen, for purity, with crowns of spring blooms, preferably daffodils, primrose, flowering red currant, star magnolia and Rhododendron. If you have any grown on your property this would be preferred.”
Lurching out of bed at the sound of throwing up once more, Draco darted into the bathroom to find Harry on his knees by the toilet, head half in the bowl.
If anything, the tension increased as everyone sat.
His heart stuttered painfully at Harry standing by the stove top, flipping pancakes in the air to the applause of the kids. Harry looked up to where he was hovering in the doorway and grinned. Draco’s stomach clenched. Harry looked different to how he normally did. The lightning bolt scar now stretched down and over his eye, causing it to turn an electric blue, the other still a rich green.
He wished.
“Darling, did I ever tell you the story of our ancestor Maria?”
“She’s dead isn’t she?” He was surprised at how calm he sounded. Coldness spread out from his heart, numbing his hands.
Ash for wisdom and knowledge.
“Hey!” He shouted. “James! Albus! I have told you before, no roughhousing in the house. Outside! No dessert tonight either!” The boys pouted but left.
The Easter break was scheduled to finish on May 1 of the year, so Draco sent a letter to Minerva, explaining the situation and advising that his children would not be able to return to Hogwarts until the second of the month. He explained the curse and his hope that the ritual would lift it but that he would need the children present to ensure the counter took. He explained that the cursebreaker from Gringotts believed this was their best chance.
Eventually the horde of locusts that were their children finished eating and drifted off. Leaving Harry and Draco sharing a pot of tea at the table.
Birch for rebirth and regeneration.
Astoria had been laid out, dressed in her favourite blue dress, the diamond earrings he had given her for their second wedding anniversary, the matching necklace from their fifth. Her hair had been brushed and curled the way she liked, delicate make up breathing life into her paling skin. Her eyes had been closed and she looked like she was resting, between breaths.
They returned to the manor where they ate a light dinner. Hallet instructed them to bathe well, first showering off the residue of the day, then spending some time soaking in a tub of their preferred salts and oils.
He swallowed heavily, memories crowding in from his childhood, what he was now inflicting on his children.
Draco, slid his fingers down Harry’s arse as they kissed frantically, moaning loudly when he found the man already prepared and waiting for him. He gasped when Harry batted his hands away, grasping Draco’s cock and pressing the head to his entrance. His breath stuttered and stilled as Harry sat back slowly, sinking down until Draco was fully encased in the other man’s body.
He stepped out onto the little porch and found Harry, on his knees, digging weeds out of the dirt. He was filthy, the tendrils of the rose bush he was currently battling stroking his hair and tangling in his clothes. But Harry was unfazed, humming happily to himself as he batted away the seeking vines.
Voldemort Returned.
Harry shook his head, smiling softly as Draco raked his fingers through his hair.
It was the middle of November during Draco’s first year. He had been settling in well with his house mates and classes, the only sore spot was his continued animosity with Potter. He had only ever wanted to be the other boy’s friend, had been looking forward to meeting him for so long. But then Weasley had gotten in the way and everything had been ruined. He couldn’t help but try and gain his attention any way he could, even if it was negative, it was better than nothing.
He woke, calm. Rising, he dressed in the robe given to him by Hallet. Draco stepped out of his room, seeing that his children had risen at the same time as he, the darkness of pre-dawn still heavy over the earth. Hallet met with them in the hall and the four of them made their way in silence to the glade.
Pleasure wound through him, magic rushing over and into his skin, the new wish embedding itself into his heart.
He had to laugh when Chris cut in and dragged the drunken man to a pole that had been set up in the corner at some point after all the stuffy oldies left. Draco was relieved, and disappointed, with the reprieve from the other man's intense attention. Potter had been considerate as a leader and pliant as a follower. The contrast was overwhelming, how easily Potter switched, shaping himself to the moment, the mood, the music. He had been willing to be whatever Draco needed and it was overwhelming to find someone who fit so easily around him.
“I heard you call, so I came. Hallet was finishing up the ritual when I arrived. You and the children were all out of it. So he and I took Scorp and Cassie back up to the house and put them to bed. James, Albus and Lily are all up there, waiting for them to wake.” Harry paused, flushing before continuing in a rush. “Hallet suggested that a good way to finish off the ritual would be for us to remain here, to… well… consummate things as the final banishment of the curse. I’ve been waiting for you to wake.”
He can ride a hippogriff backwards.”
“Was there anything else?” Draco asked after a few moments of silence.
The branches in the channel burst into flame when he returned to stand by Draco’s feet. A paintbrush in one hand and the bowl of crushed berries in the other, Hallet bent to paint runes on Draco’s feet, his hands, heart and forehead under the crown. He moved next to Scorpius, repeating the process before moving to Cassiopeia.
“What?” Harry’s voice was high and thin. When Draco looked at him, he could see Harry was protectively wrapped around his belly, looking back at him in a mixture of confusion and anger.
Primrose to represent Maria. The petals on the blossom stood for the various stages of life - birth, initiation, followed by consummation.  Then there’s repose and in the end, death. They hoped by use of Primrose, it would help encourage the death of the curse.
"I won, who cares?!" Yuri groaned. "Quit nagging, Draco."
He survived the final battle and the trials that followed. He managed to come through with his fortune mostly intact, and began working tirelessly to repair his damaged reputation.
Ida laughed, “I’m not sure I ever do,” she looked around for a second, then leaned back towards Harry, her face suddenly somber. “I technically shouldn’t be telling you this, but it happened again,” she whispered.
“Alright, Harry,” Draco emphasized, “Do you maybe want to head back to the Burrow since I made such a mess of your afternoon?”
Hannah, seated on the other side of Neville, rolled her eyes, “Neville, he gave you one Bat-Bogey hex. And anyway, it’s tradition in our family to hex whoever we become engaged to!”
Seamus laughed and gave his husband a kiss on the cheek, “No, darling, but I still fawn over you the most. We’re talking about Blaise.”
“Remmins's new partner. He was injured in the attack,” Ron said stiffly, “Fine bloke. Don’t know if he’ll make it.”
Smirking, Harry made his way to the table. He sat down in the chair across from Malfoy, who was so immersed in one of his binders that he didn’t even acknowledge Harry’s presence.
The summer went by in a blink, the promised owl arriving with the information packet for male pregnancies and births. Harry poured over it with Lily, while Draco stubbornly ignored it. All too soon, they were packing the children off to Hogwarts. James was entering his final year, and so was stressed about his NEWTs and pending career decisions.
Harry moved over to him, cupping his cheek once more, expression soft and understanding. “The curse only seems to take effect after they marry and have a child. Somehow, I don’t think we need to worry for a good long while with Scorpius. He knows about the curse and he wont risk Albus until it is broken. We have time.”
When they finished, Hallet walked around the circle, checking to make sure everything was laid out properly before clapping loudly three times. The magic that had been swirling and thickening through the glade stilled, almost as if it was holding its breath.
"So what happens next?" The tiny redhead began, peppering Harry with questions that he gladly answered.
“How did this happen?” Seamus asked.
“Figuring out my sexuality? How does shagging your friend help me do that?” he asked, confused.
Draco shook his head and began to walk across the room to the door, “Personally, I don’t think there’s anything to talk about. I had a moment of weakness. I shouldn’t have lost control of myself like that. But I was sad, and lonely, and you were there with supportive, and well,  friendly, words.”
“Everyone is falling in love,” he murmured as they walked, “It’s fucking fantastic.”
Trying to control his frustration, Harry said, “I don’t believe every article is on me, believe or not. And I only agreed to your article because I thought it would be better for me to give my own story before the Prophet came out with some wild version of me leaving the Ministry. They would have said I hate Ron or some insane rubbish like that.”
“I guess now we wait,” Harry murmured.
“You know what I mean,” Harry huffed.
Molly nodded, not looking entirely convinced, “Well, Harry, you know you can talk to me whenever you need, right?”
“Harry?” Draco whimpered, “I…”
“I was at a pub! A muggle one,” Harry thought fast, “With two trainees, Caser and Hedra. I knew they were going out last night and they had initially offered for me to join. I showed up and got pissed.”
“You better,” Neville mumbled beside him, “The last person Luna told me was untrustworthy was Hannah’s brother, and she ended up being very correct.”
“Hermione, that was beautiful,” he smiled at his friend, “But it may not be that easy.”
“James,” Ginny touched his arm gently and looked at him, “You have nothing to be sorry for. You actually took this much better than I thought you would,” she looked at Al and Lily, “You all did. Your father and I are beyond lucky to have children as wonderful as you three.”
“What does?” Harry glanced at her hesitantly, hoping she was not piecing together what he thought she was.
Ginny pulled a face and moved to say hi to Angelina and her father. Harry did the same, as Lily, Albus and James joined the group on the floor. Within seconds, Rose and Albus sprang to their feet and were off towards the backdoor. Harry knew what they were doing; Molly had wanted someone to de-gnome the garden, and he knew Al and Rose would volunteer. The two had taken to playing the game Harry had once played with Ron and his siblings while de-gnoming the garden, that being swinging the gnomes around and seeing how far they could throw them. Rose and Al had taken the game to the next level. They had made makeshift quidditch hoops that they would set up at various distances from the garden for different amounts of points. Harry admired the two’s ability to make a game out of anything; they had been making up games as a pair ever since they could walk. If Harry had thought he, Ron and Hermione were inseparable, he had thought wrong. Rose and Al were never not together if they could help it.
“I feel like I’m imposing,” Harry admitted, “I mean, I haven’t spoken to you in well over a month and then I show up on your doorstep.”
It took all of Harry’s energy to muster a concerned expression, “I come with some difficult news. A little while ago, I found Aviary outside my doorstep, passed out on my front porch.”
“An interview,” Draco said simply. His words still held just enough venom from his frustration that the Healer backed up a step, “I am interviewing trainee Potter here on the best way to relieve stress after a long work day.”
But even as he said this, Harry knew it wasn't completely true.
Padma nodded, “Leave it to me. I’ll get the bug on her straight away.”
“And now you love him,” James asked, eyebrows raised.
If Harry wasn’t mistaken, Padma didn’t look as upset as these words warranted. He knew Padma well enough to know she loved every aspect of her job, even the less glamorous parts. In all honesty, she would make a great Head Auror one day, much better than he would have. Harry may have been good at his job, but Padma was better; she was more diligent, eager and determined than anyone else in the department. Not that he would ever tell Ron that; he knew how much his friend secretly wanted to be Head Auror someday.
He smiled at her, looking much more at ease knowing they were excited to see him, “Great, Hermione. You are looking lovely.”
“It’s rude to stare, Potter,” Malfoy said, eyebrows raised, “Even Scorpius knows that.”
“Let’s head out, then,” Harry walked to the door and held it open as Lily and James went through (Lily running as fast as her little legs could carry her, James trying desperately to keep her from tripping on the front steps). Rose and Al went through the door sideways, Rose leading the way while clutching gigantic Darren’s beak. Harry breathed in the fresh air and let his face break into a grin. It was going to be a long walk, but he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Harry!” Ron caught his friend before he fell to the floor, “Are you alright?”
“Harry?” Molly said from the doorway.
Ginny let out a small cry and launched herself into her brother’s arms, shaking as she hugged him fiercely. Harry couldn’t help it; he began to cry himself.
“Harry, what’s going on?” She whispered, eyes alight with a concern she hadn’t given Harry in a long time.
“Absolutely,” Draco said from her other side, “She was your partner. You deserve to deal with this betrayal in any way you need to.”
“Saps,” Ron said, causing the whole group to laugh.
He wasn’t bluffing; taking the kids to the park could be long and tiring, but Harry adored it. The trek had become customary when Harry didn’t have training and Ginny was stuck at practice for the day. Although he wouldn’t dislike having Ginny there, it was nice to have a tradition between him and his kids (and Rose, of course, but she was practically one of his own). He also needed a good distraction. His first therapy session had been yesterday, and Harry could tell it hadn’t been a good fit. He had tried to disguise much of his past, but he soon realized that it was impossible to talk about going through a war when the therapist had no idea one of the largest wars in England had occurred. He ended up talking about his “fist-fight” with Malfoy in the bathroom for much of the session because it had been his most recent dream. Harry realized that he didn’t want to make up alterations about his past every week to have the therapist talk non-stop about a single dream. And besides, Harry already felt happier. Perhaps all he needed was more time with his kids.
The two laughed at this. Harry put one hand on Seamus’s arm and laughed himself weak into his shoulder.
“I’m not yet an old witch, Potter. I shall not be referred to as ‘mam’ until I feel it is right,” Patrick said swiftly, stopping abruptly in front of a door and walking in.
“Unless they haven’t had sex and they could still save some of Seamus’s sperm,” Draco finished bluntly.
“Aunt Ida tried to kill daddy?” Lily said, her eyes wide as she looked up at her brother in surprise.
“Uncle Ron!” Victore sang as he neared them, “Bill is supporting Puddlemere!”
“He apologized for being a Death Eater?” Ida said alarmingly, “I always thought he was one of those ex-Death Eaters who would go back to their old ways as soon as they got the opportunity.”
“He discovered what the poison from the Imperius attacks is!” Harry burst, immediately covering his mouth afterwards.
Harry shook his head. Honestly, if he told the story of Hermione’s pregnancy to Seamus, he would have to understand why Harry had taken a while to get back to his home. Harry opened his mouth to tell Seamus all of this, but something made him stop. He straightened himself and turned to face his friend.
Draco glared at him, “Don’t make me regret my decision to have feelings for you, Potter.”
Harry stared at her, speechless. Was Ginny giving him the same talk he had been planning to give her?
“I don’t know, let’s think,” Draco answered angrily, “Every time I talk to you, it’s something new. What are you going to do this time? Yell at me? Start ignoring me for a week for no apparent reason? Because you seem to be doing that a lot lately.”
“Yep. Just sitting there like she owned the fucking place,” Harry spat.
“It’s only for your protection,” Harry reassured, sitting down in a chair a couple feet away from the edge of the bubble around Seb’s bed.
“How was the bar?” Harry asked, propping himself up on his elbows as he turned to face his wife.
Harry just nodded as Draco paced the room. He was running one hand through his hair with an anxiousness Harry had never witnessed from him. He was eager, angry, beyond determined. Whatever he had found out was big.
“That was, once again, a full blown adventure,” he quipped, “Thank you, Healer Patrick.”
“I couldn’t agree more,” Harry concurred. He looked down at his own peach pie, “Since when do they have blueberry pie?”
She nodded, “Harry, he’s innocent. He volunteered to take truth serum and everything. Blaise wasn’t involved with any of the attacks and he worked diligently to try to prevent the one at the quidditch match.”
“But you pulled it off,” Harry commented, blushing slightly as he wondered what that implied.
“And we won’t tell anyone else,” Dean said, “But I think I reserve the right to if a victim is talking about having kids.”
“What we really need is a Harry and Draco wedding,” Seamus said cheekily.
“Poke fun all you want,” Draco said, “But if Vella was old enough, you two would have sent her to play tag by now.”
“That’s awful,” Harry said, shaking his head.
The dreadful silence was broken by the approach of Healer Brayan and Auror Savant.
Maybe Mary sent him a haughty look, but Dean was agreeing with him earnestly. Harry and Dean began talking about how Seamus had taken to staying up all night trying to predict what team would win the UK tournament (Harry was learning Seamus had quite the brain for statistics) when Harry spotted a familiar head of blonde hair across the canteen. Sue enough, as the man sporting the blonde hair turned to his side, Harry saw the unmistakable profile of Draco Malfoy standing near conference room B and looking up at the menu options flashing magically across the front of the food line in midair.
“Same here,” Harry said quickly, “Apparate to my house.”
Harry sighed, “I don’t want you out. I promise.”
“What the hell, Potter?” Malfoy accused, “At least warn me next time.”
“What’s it?” Harry tried to figure out what he could have said that had given Draco an idea.
Ida looked stunned at this. “You’re choosing me a trainee?” she blurted.
Draco nodded and stared back at Harry. Then he suddenly jumped off and walked out of the room. Harry looked at the empty doorway, trying to understand what had just happened. Did Draco know? Had looking directly at him been a mistake? But that was ridiculous in itself. He couldn’t go the rest of his life without looking at Draco.
Harry’s whole body seemed to thrive with the effort of trying to fight his non visible constraint. This was the worst form of torture, and he could tell Ida knew that. She knew all along that Harry liked Draco and that they were working together. He had told her he was gay before almost anyone. He had trusted her to understand everything he was going through. And now… now he was watching her torture the man he loved.
Dean picked up his slice of blueberry pie and took a bite, “I still can’t believe he’s allowed to coach a team with Angelina Johnson on it. She is far too good for him.”
“This is one of my favorites!” Aviary said giddily. She grabbed Seb by the hand and led him onto the dance floor.
“Harry, you ask that every bloody time. You know very well I am capable of watching my grandchildren,” Molly declared.
“Is it fine if I come in?” Draco asked. He looked absolutely exhausted. His eyes were bloodshot and his hair reminded Harry’s of his own throughout his childhood: wild with no sense of direction. Harry thought unwillingly about how attractive this was on him, then scolded himself for thinking of anything but Hermione at the moment.
“I…” Draco started, but the door flung open.
Seb beamed. His eyes lit up in a way that was somehow familiar to Harry, although he couldn’t place how. Then Seb ran a hand through his blonde hair and it hit Harry: Seb reminded Harry of Draco. Not their personalities, persey; Draco was far too confusing and unpredictable to be compared to the sunny, easygoing aura of Seb. But they smiled in the same way when they were truly happy, as if nothing else mattered but the person they were talking to at the moment. Harry tried to shake off this thought. Was that really what he thought of Draco’s smile? Since when? He turned his attention back to Seb, who was now describing how excited he was to hug his mom after he was released from St. Mungos. Harry reasoned with himself; the reason he liked Seb was because he was kind and selfless, the exact type of person he was drawn to. It had nothing to do with the fact his smile was reminiscent of Draco’s.
“Except for Reyes,” Draco put in bitterly, “For the coach of one of the best teams in England, that man cannot play. Just watching him yesterday brought tears to my eyes.”
“Harry, my dear boy! What brings you to my fireplace in this time of crisis?” Savant addressed him heartily.
“Really?” Draco asked.
“I think so. It seems like the best fit,” Caser confirmed, “I used to help Madam Pomfrey with quidditch accidents after matches, so I feel right at home.”
“You’re right,” Harry said.
Rachel signed, relieved to see that Harry wasn’t angry about her almost question. She hesitated, then said, “But you were so good! You were on your way to becoming Head Auror! I mean, Kingsley adores you.” Her words came out in a rush.
Shit. Harry had forgotten about that part.
Harry recognized the desperation in Ron’s voice, “Yes, yes. Of course.”
Harry felt a little off put by the lack of expression in Savant’s voice. He was used to the loud, booming abrasiveness of the man in front of him. This new Savant had seen and done things that had left him this new man, tired and broken down while still working at the dregs of night.
“Harry, not to be rude, but I’m not taking in anything you’re saying,” Draco gave a small grin as he stared not so subtly at Harry’s lips
“Ron?” she said again, her voice a whisper, “What’s going on?”
Her voice cracked at these last words, but she didn’t cry.
“Fuck that, Harry,” Aviary said, sitting down beside him. Harry looked at her in surprise. He had never heard her talk like that, “Be upset all you want. The man you like is continually putting himself in danger. I can relate.”
Ida pursed her lips and looked away, “Ron agrees with me, you know. He feels you are crazy to think you have an actual friendship with him.”
Harry smiled back and tried to ignore the small pang in his heart at Caser’s mention of his inspiration. He wished he had had parents to look up to and help influence his future decisions. Sometimes he felt so incapable of figuring out what to do with his life. Becoming a Healer was the first decision he felt that he really made for himself, and the choice had been more liberating than he could have ever imagined.
“Well, then it’s good you didn’t tell me,” Aviary shuddered, “Just imagine what would have happened if you told Ida and I?”
“Oi, Patil!” Harry said, “Do you want some help?”
He fought back tears as he looked wildly around the living room. He needed to talk to Ginny. Now. He was done with lying. Having Draco basically tell him that they would never be together had made more upset than he would like to admit. But as he stood in the home that no longer felt like his and yelled for his wife that he no longer wanted to call his own, he felt stupid. Stupid that he had placed his infatuation with Draco and his coming out together. He had, without meaning to, dedicated this discovery about his identity to Draco. That was wrong. Yes, Draco had made him realize he wasn’t straight. But he was a bloody fool to think that just because he liked Draco things would work out. And Harry did think that. As much as he had doubted the fact Draco would ever like him, a part of him had simultaneously imagined them ending up together. Raising their children together. Buying a house together.
“Albus!” Ginny scolded, “I’m not trying to protect you from hearing it!”
“Granger- Weasley… I mean Ron,” Draco emphasized, “I appreciate you saying all of that. I want to help in any way I can.”
With Ida and Aries now on the ground, Seamus and Ron turned to Draco and Harry respectively to reverse their full-body binding curses.
Harry sighed, “Okay. It’s true. I… like Draco.”
“No time. You have a statement to give, I have so many things to do that I can’t waste another second. Go to the first interrogation room. Aviary should be in there now, ready to take your statement.”
“Yes, you are,” Ginny said with a soft smile, “But you did hit your head on one of the boards in the room. The healer told us it’s nothing to worry about, but you have to take it easy until the swelling settles. So no jumping out of this bed and running around with excitement.”
Harry was awoken some time later with a sharp stinging in his side. He sprang off the couch and looked around blurrily for his wand.
Harry pulled away from the fireplace just in time. Aviary and Draco were watching him expectantly.
“My mother told me,” Ida continued, “Not to join the muggle-loving Ministry run by one of the greatest blood traitors of our time, Kingsley Shacklebolt. But I knew that being an Auror was a genius position. It was the perfect way to know everything the Ministry suspected. A way to control the attacks we had been planning for years from the inside. To prevent the Ministry from ever suspecting me or any of my family. And it worked. Me, as a respected Auror and Aries as a respected quidditch coach. Two people who were far from likely to be a part of a plan to demolish the muggle race.”
Ron looked at him, tears in his eyes, “What if Malfoy had died? Would you not blame yourself?”
Before Harry could stop himself, he blurted, “Surely that isn’t true? I mean, Malfoy can’t be gay, or bisexual, or whatever?”
“Mate, you do know it’s Sunday afternoon,” Ginny grinned, walking in to give Dean a hug.
“I know that, Harry. I’m just saying, think of yourself too,” Harry looked at Ida now. She seemed extremely uncomfortable. Harry realized that Ida wanted to talk about this even less than he did. This was her way of letting Harry know she supported him completely and wanted him to find happiness. Harry could almost laugh at how much Ida’s approach at a supportive friend talk contrasted Hermione’s, who was nothing if not direct and filled to the brim with the desire to talk about feelings.
Draco winced, “Are you upset? I should have let you tell her. But I felt so guilty with everything that I wanted Molly to know from me that I had nothing but good intentions.”
“None of this is your fault, Harry,” Luna comforted, “And they will be upset, but not at you. What’s most important is that they know as soon as possible.”
“Blaise was at the hospital the day of the Imperius attacks, because of a quidditch accident,” Harry said in a rush, “And he was in charge of the quidditch match! Now he’s taking charge of security, when he has been in Games and Sports his entire careers. None of it adds up, unless he’s involved in Kareach!”
Remmins nodded in agreement, “You were a fantastic Auror. We take your input seriously.”
“I’m not uncomfortable working with you!” Harry exclaimed, feeling extremely guilty at the accusation, “I don’t want you to think that.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “Aries will be far too unbearable. But let’s not forget Angelina and Oliver are still on Puddlemere. I don’t want to actively root against them.”
“Am I wrong?” James asked, eyebrows raised.
Aviary moved to steady him, “It’s a good thing, right?”
Ginny nodded. He could see her anger leaving, “You do, don’t you? I trust you enough to believe that.”
Harry opened his eyes and pulled away abruptly. He looked immediately towards where Draco was standing. Draco was staring at him, the same unreadable expression seemingly on his face. But Harry knew him too well. Even with the distance between them, he could see the sadness around his eyes, the slight shaking of his hand. He was upset.
“They would have,” Ida said, “But somehow, somehow, only you two did that. We’ve been planning for months to take out Draco. The main purpose of the hospital attack wasn’t to poison, but to kill Draco!”
The four of them stayed for about ten minutes. Healer Patrick had told Seamus that Dean would make a full recovery, but that he was going to remain in a deep sleep for at least a day. Hermione tried to talk Seamus into taking a break and getting a tea, but he refused to leave Dean’s side. She instead went to the canteen and returned minutes later with a tea, in which Seamus gulped down speedily. As they made to leave, Hermione and Ginny decided to stay behind with Seamus for a while, so only Ron and Harry left the room.
Harry reached for his fork and thanked Dean. He looked up to tell Dean his ranking of the canteen pie flavors, when he noticed Dean was staring at him absently, his eyes glazed over.
“Harry’s right, Aviary,” Ron interrupted, “You need to be protected. So do any other muggleborns in the Auror department. We can’t lose any more innocent lives that are in our control.”
Draco smiled, “You better. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Cheater?” Harry’s heart beat rapidly, “What are you talking about?”
“I see,” Ida said stiffly.
“That’s not true,” Ida whispered, “We could have gotten here sooner.”
“Aviary, it was never personal,” Harry explained, “We didn’t want to involve any Aurors, really, because we thought it would be too risky. We only involved Ron and Padma because we needed to.”
Malfoy looked at him with an expression Harry recognized as a mixture of excitement and worry. It was one he wore frequently.
“What?” Harry whispered back, shocked. “But we haven’t had an incident for months! The extreme safety measures were lifted from Diagon Alley!”
“Hello,” Harry said, more shortly than he had anticipated. Draco gave him a confused look while Blaise boomed back, “Potter! Great to see you, mate!”
“It is,” Luna agreed, “But it’s less heartbreaking if they find out from a friend.”
“What the fuck?” Harry snapped suddenly, causing Malfoy to take a few steps back.
“Nothing!” Harry burst, shoving his way between Ida and Seamus and towards the front door of the house.
Harry stared at his wife. It was all about to tumble out: his unhappiness, his confusion, his emptiness. But the look in Ginny’s eyes stopped him. They looked soft, worried, inviting. He didn’t want her to carry his own sadness.
“No,” he muttered, kicking at the coffee table with his foot in frustration, “But we can still trust her!”
“She’ll find a way, Av,” Harry reassured, “Padma won’t let her fear of human contact stop her from taking down someone who wronged her.”
“What is going on here?” Ron demanded.
Harry did choke on his mead this time, “What the fuck? I thought we were done with the third degree over my love life.”
Ginny looked pleased at this statement but didn’t say anything. This gave Ron a chance to jump in, “I hardly think Blaise’s opinion will make or break the match.”
Ida patted him on the back and gave a snort, “You don’t have to be queer to be able to identify a good looking bloke.”
She paused, her scrunched up concentration. “It can’t be,” she murmured.
“Draco!” he yelled desperately as he bent down next to Ron, “I know what to do,” he says to Ron, trying to keep calm and focused.
The one and a half year girl let out a loud giggle and then threw her hands up into the hair, indicating that she wanted Harry to pick her up. He wasted no time, bending down to hoist her onto his hip.
“And I love her!” George insisted, “But my wife is a quidditch player. Going against her team would be some kind of marital crime.”
“Sorry Seamus, but you are going to have to just come to the wedding,” Lavender said, “For some crazy reason, we thought of our parents giving us away before we thought of you and now it’s too late.”
Harry was only a page further into his book when the fire in front of him began to speak.
“I haven’t given up searching!” Harry retorted defensively, “I still look every night before I go to sleep! Ginny thinks I’m the world’s best student.”
The sight made Harry laugh. This laugh came with a surging feeling of relief. It felt so good to laugh after last night and this morning. He sat down at the table and took his own slice of blueberry pie (it was the only pie he would eat; he did suppose he was a bit picky) and began to eat.
Harry snorted, “It’s too late, anyhow. My kids are already too attached to you.”
Harry smiled softly and leaned into Aviary. She didn’t hesitate to lean her head on top of his.
“Albus!” she shouted, completely disregarding the rest of the family to get up and hug him.
“We didn’t mean to, Harry!” Aviary insisted, “We don’t think you are a fool.”
Harry choked on his own drink as she said this, “Why do I have to choose? What do I know about blokes?”
He watched as Ron’s head disappeared and then his entire body materialized moments later. He looked exactly how someone who had spent the day at an office who had captured a confirmed criminal would look. His hair was a disaster and his eyes were bloodshot. But there was more than that in Ron’s face, which is what made Harry believe this was about much more than Brayan. This was the expression Ron held when something disastrous had happened and he was feeling hopeless as to how to fix it.
“Well, off you go, Harry, Gin,” Arthur said, guilty avoiding Molly’s withering gaze, “Have fun with Dean and Seamus!”
Ignoring Draco while pretending life is normal with his wife proved to be much harder than Harry anticipated. Yes, his feelings were real. Yes, he had already told Ida and had consequently brought his feelings into the world. But he was not Draco’s person, and Draco was not his. For all he knew, Draco was in love with Blaise, a friend he had known since Hogwarts who was gay and nice and confident and so fucking attractive that Harry wondered repeatedly what Draco could ever see in him, Harry. A week had gone by and he had successfully ignored all of Draco’s angry calls and voicemails. He felt like a prat, but he couldn’t think of any other way to deal with his messy feelings without betraying his wife and family. And Ginny was great. She really was. The things he had felt after the attack had been enhanced by his insistent worry that Draco could have died. Yes, he was fully and hopelessly attracted to Draco. But that didn’t mean he didn’t love his wife, that he couldn’t make their, albeit rocky, relationship work. So he went through the motions of his life, spending as much time with his kids as he could. At the hospital things were  worse because every time he went anywhere near the canteen or the Ground Floor, he was reminded of Draco. As being those are the only two places he went for most of the week, his job was a new form of hell he had not prepared for.
Harry’s mood shifted as he took in this news. Healer Patrick was the head Healer of the Second floor, which dealt with magical ailments and diseases. Although Harry had yet to decide what department he wanted to work in after he completed training, working on the second floor was definitely on the table.
“Let’s begin,” Malfoy pulled out a quill and began to write, “How long were you an Auror before deciding on a career change?”
“Is she saying…” Ron trailed off, not able to finish his sentence.
Harry was more than surprised at the causal question. Hesitating, he inquired, “What does this have to do with my interview?”
Ida caught his eye and shook her head, “No worries, Harry. I agree with Ginny. My cousin is one giant wanker.”
Harry looked at the paper as Draco placed it down in front of him. He now realized the picture depicted a human that seemed to be unaffected with Chann. Harry’s stomach dropped as he began to read the side effects, which were both drawn on the person and described on the sides. The entire person was shaded a bright orange, indicating the tint of orange Harry had witnessed on every poisoned patient he had encountered. The eyes were labeled with the words ``glassy and distant looking before the seizure”, driving home the fact that this was exactly what Harry had feared. Chann was the poison Kareach had been using.
“Oh no!” Ida exclaimed, “Is she alright? We have a couple lower-level Aurors searching for her but they hadn’t found anything!”
“Harry!” he shouted, waving Harry towards him.
Sure enough, the newspaper on Brayan’s desk was of the interview Harry had done with Malfoy two weeks prior. To his surprise, the picture above the article wasn’t the usual cheesy affair that Harry associated with fuller Prophet articles. The picture had been taken of Harry smiling on his first day of training. He looked eager and happy, and not in an over exaggerated way. It had been taken by Hermione and Harry had submitted it to the Prophet, but he had been doubtful Malfoy would opt for the nice and put-together picture of him when he could only imagine how many pictures Brayan had submitted of he and Harry where Harry either looked exhausted or like he was overtly faking his smile. Apparently Malfoy wanted to give his article a level of sophistication, and Harry appreciated that.
“What if I say no?” Padma joked, “I don’t trust your taste in dresses.”
“It’s great to see you, Hermione,” he said. Hermione looked over at him and sighed.
“Nope,” Pansy said, throwing an arm around her girlfriend.
“Wasn’t planning on it,” Draco answered softly.
“Just act like I’m supposed to be here,” the person muttered. Harry could recognize that drawling voice anywhere. He turned to his right to look into the face of Draco Malfoy. His hair, blonder than ever, was drooping across his piercing blue eyes. He gave Harry a bright smile that made his whole face light up and made Harry’s brain spiral into overdrive. Malfoy reached out and placed his hand on Harry’s arm and gave a chirpy laugh. What in the hell was going on?
Harry crossed the room now, feeling the need to comfort her he has felt for years. He reached down for her hands and looked at her until she met his eyes.
“Much could happen to him if Aries is already there,” Harry said, his voice rising unhelpfully, “What if…”
Harry patted Remmins shoulder as he moved towards the door, “How are you doing, Gani?” Harry asked.
To Harry’s surprise, she didn’t look angry. She looked perfectly calm, sitting up in bed with her arms wrapped around her knees.
“Thanks, Rachel,” Harry said, smiling at her so she would know he wasn’t about to tell Ron she thought he was a poor Auror, “I’ll miss you too.”
“Look who’s here!” Padma announced to Ron as she sat down at her own desk and began organizing her paperwork into piles.
“Yeah, right,” James commented.
Harry gave a slight laugh, “If you would, throw in I think Hermione’s a wanker too. Might as well get the full truth out.”
“Hermione, I don’t think you want to know,” he insisted.
The urgent energy that had consumed the room when Draco dragged Harry in had dissipated. All was left was the nasty realization of what the poison was doing to hundreds of innocent people. The whole idea was so despicably genius that it made Harry’s stomach feel like it was made of lead. He couldn’t fathom the amount of people this poison could spread to overtime. Looking over at Draco, he could tell he was feeling the same thing; an all consuming sense of dread, anger and disgust.
“Uncle Harry!” Rose exclaimed, running over to give Harry a hug.
“The best of influences,” Malfoy sneered, but Harry thankfully detected no malice in his voice. Instead, he just sounded tired and a bit defeated. Harry had a strong idea why.
“That’s my fault,” Ron said, holding up his hands, “I really wrecked the theme we have going on here.”
Harry pulled back abruptly from her arms, “What?”
Malfoy nodded, looking half tipsy and half thoroughly pissed off. He took another long swing of his wine and swore, “Fuckin’ Prophet. I’m so much more than just a pretty face.”
“We are going to need your statement, too, Harry,” Ida said. Her arm was now wrapped around Padma, who was sniffling silently. Aviary and Ron had begun to bag evidence again.
As Draco gave him a small smile, Harry wanted nothing more than to crawl over and kiss him senseless. But, his desperate feelings aside, he didn’t think now was the time.
Harry shot a look of mock offense at her. “I don’t do that!” he said indignantly, “Just tell me whatever it is that you three need me to weigh in on.”
“Harry, you don't have to do this,” he said softly. The intensity in his voice sent shivers down Harry’s spine, “This is my job, my decision. I just got excited that someone else believed me. That doesn't make it right for me to use you.”
“I feel good about her,” Ida declared as soon as they were outside Savant’s office, “She reminds me of myself.”
“Oh yeah!” Al said angrily, “Brickston couldn’t find the snitch if it was the size of a blimp and had sirens attached to it!”
“A family operation! Of course!” Aviary shouted, anger now taking over her timid silence, “They took two jobs they knew wouldn’t associate them or their family with bigotry, and they hid! For years,” She looked from Draco to Harry, “You two could be right. This has to be much more than just Ida and her cousin. How else would she have pulled all of this off without blowing her cover as an Auror? I cannot believe her! Pretending to care and then going to plan new attacks!”
“I know,” Harry said desperately, “But I thought...”
Harry couldn't help it; he let out a loud giggle at this. Malfoy leered at him for a moment, then broke out into a small laugh that grew as Harry continued to laugh. Soon, they were both laughing uncontrollably, and only stopped when the bartender shot them an annoyed look. Malfoy took a breath to control his laughter, then turned to Harry,
“Why am I allowed?” Harry asked, “And why is everything so intense? Did the suspect confess?”
Harry was trying not to look at her. He couldn’t confess why he was so upset so he didn’t want Luna to see he had been crying. But Luna wasn’t looking at him anyway. She was staring out across the lawn. The silence comforted Harry in a way he couldn’t explain. He needed someone to just let him feel sad without an explanation.
“Yeah, Harry…” Ron started.
“A muggle shop?!” Harry exclaimed.
“Ruined our family?” Harry whispered.
“Actually, Molly…” he hesitated, not wanting to say he was leaving the Burrow before eating lunch, “I have to go. Healer emergency.”
“They’re stubborn but reasonable…” Harry murmured.
Harry laughed and reached for the whiskey again, “It should have. I’m never going to let you forget you ordered me garbage whiskey in one of my lowest moments.”
“Next Monday. Once again, good work. You are a promising healer. Mr. Potter.”
Harry shook his head, hurt, “How can you say that? It was never like that!”
“I sincerely have no idea, Harry,” Ron sighed heavily as he sat down on the couch, “I hope you don’t mind if I sit. I haven’t sat down in what feels like days.”
“There’s nothing more to talk about,” Ron said angrily, grabbing onto Rose’s hand, “I don’t want to talk to either of you for awhile.”
Minutes later, the two stood outside of Savant’s office. It was in harsh contrast to the last time they had stood here together. Then, they had both been clean and wearing robes. Harry became aware that he hadn’t showered in a day or two and that his hair was highly tousled from trying desperately to sleep for hours at no avail. Ida’s hair in the light of the hallway looked like she hadn’t changed the braids looped into buns for days. They hung limply at the sides of her head while strands of her dark hair stuck out every which way.
“Oi,” Ron said softly to them, “Harry’s awake.”
They were heading to Seamus and Dean’s house, a large flat in London. About once a month or so, Seamus and Dean held a little get together at their house for drinks and appetizers (the appetizers being mainly for Ron: most of the guests came from lunch at the Burrow and only Ron could be hungry after that). It was a tradition Harry was quite fond of. No one knew how to have a good time like Dean and Seamus. It was also a great excuse to have a kid-free evening where he saw many of his closest friends.
“I know,” James grinned softly, “I’m too good of a son.”
“You both probably think it is highly usually for me to invite Potter back here today,” Savant began, “But no one knows our dear Ida here as well as you, Potter! And, in all honesty, I get a little overwhelmed with all these Auror trainees. So many, all so eager!”
After a good thirty minutes of Brayan telling his side of Harry’s life story (from a man who had know Harry for only a couple months, he sure had plenty to say), Brayan excused himself after a nurse who had been searching for him asked him to finish the trainee class he had been running before he came sprinting to Harry’s interview. Once Brayan was gone, silence quickly consumed the room as Malfoy moved to pack up his things.
Harry felt the cold of his dread be replaced by a warm feeling of comfort. Draco was fine. Harry had been willing to risk his life to ensure that. Harry remembered the events of the attack as if through a bad dream. He had seen the spell being fired at Draco and he had acted without thinking. He cared about Draco in a way he had suspected for a long time. There had been so many signs throughout the years… he had pushed back any sense of attraction to males for so long that he didn’t know how to deal with it now. But now he felt exposed, open; he liked Draco. He was falling for Draco. He was the most confusing and complicated man Harry had ever met, but he loved that. Harry loved his passion, his bravery, his graciousness, even his stubbornness. Harry liked blokes. Well, he liked one bloke. One that happened to be Draco fucking Malfoy.
Padma gasped at this while Ida and Harry began to laugh. “I was only trying to help, Av,” Padma said defensively, sending a half-hearted glare at Aviary.
Seb looked up as Harry entered, “Back to watch me, I suppose? I knew I would be getting a babysitter today.”
“I know,” Draco said, “We need to figure that out before I call Padma.”
Ida looked impatient, “Because you need experiences with people other than the woman you’ve been with for most of your life! How are you to know anything about who you are if you have barely begun making your own choices?!”
“I understand you’ve had a stressful last couple of days,” she said, “But you can’t just make up some excuse and sneak off to a bar. We could have planned a trip to the bar with Ron and Hermione if that’s what you needed.”
“I have a wife, kids. I’m so afraid of destroying all of that,” Harry admitted.
Harry back away in alarm, “To see if you are alright,” he said defensively, “I saw you leave your seat and I assumed the worst.”
A knock sounded on Padma’s door.
Harry grasped onto his daughter. She was okay. He was okay.
“Harry!” he exclaimed, rushing over, “What happened! I tried calling back…” he trailed off when he noticed Dean and Seamus sitting next to Harry.
Harry saw a ghost of a smile appear on Malfoy’s face before he looked back determinedly at the menu and said, “So, pot pie or no?”
Harry shot Malfoy a look, and to his surprise, Malfoy actually seemed to adhere to it.
“Well, you have to admire the courage,” Harry quipped, “Not many people are able to call their own grandmother a naked mole rat. He was probably trying to get that off his chest for years.”
“Potter?” he said hesitantly, “What on earth…”
“He knows my fawning is purely friend-based,” Seamus explained. The group laughed.
“Oi, yes, of course,” Savant stammered, hurrying over to the table. After rubbing his eyes, he looked down at the papers Ida had spread across the table.
Malfoy kept his face blank as he stared at Harry. Harry began to feel he made a dreadful mistake. There was no way Malfoy would want his help, he didn’t even want Harry to know about the investigation in the first place.
“Aren’t we all,” Remmins murmured, holding open the door for Harry to go in.
“Well,” Ginny pulled back and looked at him, “Fuck him. Fuck Ron. Fuck anyone else who treats us like shit. We are going to figure this all out. And we will always have each other for moments like this.”
“I’ve been working on figuring out as much as I can,” Harry avowed, “And when have been talking to Ron?”
“We’ve already lost four muggles,” Padma added, “And who knows if we have even hospitalized everyone who was poisoned? We were in Yorkshire for hours trying to track down anyone who went to Sandy’s yesterday. Not to mention all the obliviating we had to do.”
“Can I come through?” Ron asked urgently.
“Goodness, Hermione,” Harry laughed, “I forgot how direct pregnancy makes you.”
The rest of the interview dragged on in a series of jaded questions and short answers. Harry didn’t need to make the interview his own; he hadn’t even been eager to go through with it in the first place. All in all, Harry was more than happy when Malfoy announced he had asked his last question and Harry was free to go. Harry was about to stand up when a breathless Healer Brayan ran into the room. Darius Brayan was the head of the Healer Training department; he oversaw the courses Harry took and had guided Harry through multiple hands-on practices with actual patients. Harry liked Healer Brayan, but he could be a bit overbearing at times. Brayan thought quite highly of himself, and it wasn’t hard to see why; Brayan had irrefutable good looks. With his curly dark hair, deep brown eyes and dark skin, he was the definition of a good-looking bloke and he knew it. He played into any attention he could get. Despite this, Harry still couldn’t help but like the guy; he was a brilliant teacher, being patient, kind and incredibly intelligent. However, Harry had a sinking suspicion Brayan’s sudden burst into the room had nothing to do with Harry’s training and a whole lot to do with the interview that was about to be published in the most popular wizarding newspaper in London.
“Harry, I guess that’s up to you,” Draco said firmly, “I don’t think anyone should know yet, as much as that pains me, but I can’t ask you to keep something like this from your friend.”
Harry snorted, “I have someone you could talk to if you want to hear about the tragedy of a straight life. My friend Ron has been complaining steadily for thirty straight years.”
“And no running into the hallway to snog Draco,” James said cheekily.
Despite his ongoing panicky thoughts, Harry managed to get into the match. Both teams were fascinating to watch. When one of Ginny’s chasers swung from her broom and managed to hit the quaffle in as the Puddlemere beaters aimed the bludger at her, Harry was so impressed that he temporarily forgot to look at Draco. He appreciated his kids' company for the further distraction. Listening to Rose and Al fight over the match was both hilarious and highly entertaining.
Just then, the phone booth reached the atrium of the Ministry. The doors opened and Harry followed Remmins as he made his way to the lift. Harry tried to ask more questions as they waited for the lift to reach the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Harry abruptly stopped talking when he saw the state of level two.
She moved to put her arm around James, but he pushed her away.
“I know that now,” Draco sat down on the edge of the bed, “Harry, when I saw Ida fire that curse at you last night… I felt like I was the one dying. The only thing I could think of us dying to save you. And then this morning… waiting to see if everything was okay… I’ve never felt so worried and restless in my life. You make me feel grounded, Harry. You make me feel like my life is worth so much more.”
Moving towards the door, Harry was hit by a sudden bout of nerves. Quickly telling himself to snap out of it, Harry pushed the door open. He had faced much worse than an adult Malfoy in conference room B; there was no reason for him to be nervous.
“Expelliarmus!” a shout occurred from somewhere behind Harry. He watched, with a renewed hope, as Ida’s wand went flying and ricocheted off one of the walls.
Seamus turned to his husband, “You too?”
“Mate, that’s because you really only dated my sister,” Ron said.
Harry knew it. All this time, Draco was right. He had been the only one to truly see what Kareach was and the threat it held. Now, because of that, he would pay the price.
“Are they okay?” Harry asked urgently, realizing he hadn’t seen them since Hermione’s hospital room, which could have been hours ago.
Harry looked directly at her, “As long as Draco needs me, it’ll always be mine to solve.”
“Ginny!” Harry yelped, releasing Draco’s hand and turning around to look at her.
“It really is a shame,” another voice Harry knew all too well came from somewhere behind slowly. He watched helplessly as Ida Reyes made her way into the room to join her cousin.
“Draco’s bug,” Ron explained from over Harry’s shoulder, “After the fighting ended, we realized you and Draco were missing. Padma went to her office to trace you. It took some time, but we were eventually able to pick up a signal.”
Harry explained what he needed to check, carefully avoiding Draco’s gaze, as it made him feel he was on fire. What was happening to him?
Draco nodded. He opened his mouth as if he was going to say something else, then closed it and looked down at his lap.
Al shot a glare at Scorpius and Rose, “I thought you two were supposed to be my best friends.”
James gave a short laugh, “Okay, dad. So she didn’t kick you out of the house yesterday?”
Harry checked back into reality to find Aviary peering into his eyes. Remmins was still standing at his shoulder, a ghost of a smile now upon his face.
Padma laughed, “It comes out every once in a while.”
“He was. I had to fight back my angry retorts after he insulted Ginny,” Harry said, hoping to convey this was the main reason he was upset. Not the fact that Draco and Blaise were probably more than friends and there was nothing he could do about it or about the fact that he cared for some reason. I mean, he didn’t like… no, he didn’t. He was straight. He was married. End of internal discussion.
“Was I ever livid?” Harry asked faintly, catching Ginny’s silent accusations and confusion as he looked at her momentarily.
Ron stood up and crossed the room to his sister until he was standing directly in front of her, “Of course,” he said softly.
“Who exactly are you, sir?” asked Malfoy, keeping his voice even.
“Thank you, Healer Brayan. That means a lot,” Harry told him.
“How could you tell?” Harry whispered.
“No!” Harry insisted, “But I’m in love. And that’s worse enough.”
“Fair point,” Harry agreed.
Harry crumbled to the floor and held on to Lily, who was now patting him on the back. The situation would have made him laugh if he wasn’t so sad at the moment.
She then rushed towards the hallway and continued to call Ron’s name, disappearing behind the swarm of frantic Aurors.
His insides were burning with the need to help, to fight this, but none of that mattered. Harry watched, his heart hammering, as the Kareach member turned slowly around to face Harry once again. With excruciating slowness, the figure reached for his mask and revealed his face. Standing before Harry was Aries Reyes.
“It’s a Harry-Draco situation!” Seamus whispered, “All the fighting and bickering was to cover up an undeniable sexual tension!”
“Exactly!” Ida turned to Harry, anger flashing in her eyes, “He lied. He has been lying for years! After some digging last night, I found out the real identity of his father. Brayan had told everyone that his real father was a muggle named Horacio, a man that was his stepfather for years before he died a couple years ago of an unidentified reason. Hours of digging lead me to his actual father, a man named Gert Foget. Harry,” she said, her voice taking on a tone of enthusiasm he recognized from whenever she solved a case, “Foget was a death eater. He died serving Voldemort. The inscription on his grave is, get this ‘Death for the right cause is the only pure way to die’,” she then reached for a small newspaper article, “Look at this! It says right here that ‘Foget’s son, Darius Foget, choose his dad’s inscription’. This was during the second wizarding war. Brayan would have been in his late twenties at the time!”
