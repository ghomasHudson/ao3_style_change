Don’t bring up Potter. Don’t bring up Potter who was just his type. Potter who was shaggable and didn’t hex him.
“It’s the phrasing that keeps it legal.  For the drinks we offer from the menu we had our solicitor draw up the phrasing.  As long as we say the phrase, ‘How would you like to feel’ and follow it up with “Would you like a potion for cheerfulness or whatever?”  It is verbal consent. It’s not different from ordering a calming herbal tea when you’re stressed. Or a coffee when you’re knackered. None of the potions are addictive and all of them, honestly, are less harmful than alcohol.”
“Did you just say you could have done without parents? Mr My-Father-Will-Hear-About-This?” It wasn’t the worst impression of Draco.
Roger followed Harry’s gaze to Draco.  “Oh, come on, mate.  It’s brilliant, isn’t it?  Pans, come on.  I haven’t slagged off anything you’ve brought.”
Finally, when Harry was about to shut down completely, Malfoy made their excuses. Outside the pub, Malfoy gripped Harry by his shoulder.
Malfoy chewed his lip. His lips looked soft. He probably used some fancy balm on them, made of unicorn tears or some shit. Harry ran a thumb across his own bottom lip.
“When was this?” Ron asked.  He had a box of every flavour beans that he was eating entirely too recklessly for Harry’s taste.
The private moment Harry thought guilty for observing, never mind that it happened at the dinner table, was over quickly. It morphed into one much more familiar to Harry. Hermione’s eyes widened, and she leaned forward, one elbow on the table, her hand covering her mouth. When she began muttering to herself, Harry couldn’t keep from grinning.
“Oh, Harry.” She stood and gave him a hug. She rested her head on his shoulder, and Harry’s arms came up around her.
“I’ll just get my quill so we can begin taking notes!” Hermione said before she dashed up the stairs to Ron’s old room.
Roger and Pansy continued to snap at each other.  Harry was having a terrible sense of dejavoo.  He and Ginny had bickered for three days before Harry finally gave up and tossed his Gryffindor bedding.  She didn’t want to feel like she was living at school any longer.  She wanted a grown up bedroom with grown up fixings.  Harry just wanted to feel at home.  He hadn’t realized his taste was juvenile until she'd said it aloud.
Harry shrugged, but the gesture was lost on account of the whole flying on a broomstick in the air chasing a snitch thing.
“Yeah, American.”  Harry said. “Thought it might be less complicated.  I’m pretty much only famous here.”
Dudley’s eyes darted to the other bar patrons. He dropped his voice to a whisper, “It’s.. genetic, your condition, yeah?”
Draco took a shaky breath, the only kind of breathing he seemed capable of and nodded.  But when Harry made to slide out of the bed Draco held on tighter.
Harry nodded. He needed a hangover potion. He sighed and fell back on Sirius’s bed, closing his eyes.
“Last time I saw Potter we were on the train together five years ago and believe me when I say it was the longest train ride I’ve ever taken.”
“Not only that, but we had this exact conversation two hours ago. You said we couldn’t be friends and that’s all there is to say on the matter.” Malfoy said.
Harry threw back his head and laughed.  Malfoy, no, Draco smirked at him. Harry stuck out his hand, “Friends?”
Shit. He knew that voice. It just had to be Weasley stepping in, didn’t it. A large boot planted itself near Creevy’s in Draco’s narrow field of vision.
Harry shook his head and took another bite out of his burger.  “I can tell the difference. I’d know if they didn’t.”
“You did? It was ‘mazin, it was. I mean, I was dying. And Harry just-” Dudley made sure there was no one overhearing them, he continued in a whisper “magicked them away.” He sat back in the booth. “It was incredible.”
The shower did very little to soothe his pounding head. The dreadful thing about drinking port was waking up the next day. He stayed in until the water turned cold. He trudged back to the spare room where he was staying to get dressed. His old school trunk was opened and its contents strewn about the room. He was grateful Millie and Blaise hadn’t found his room in such a state. He dressed and began putting things back in his trunk, deliberately ignoring a pile of sketches he’d drawn in third year of Potter in quidditch gear. It had been part of his planning for dressing as a dementor that year. He wasn’t sure where the dementor sketch had got to, he must have binned it. There was another similar pile by the bedside table, these of Potter meeting gruesome deaths in a giant hedge maze. Draco heard footsteps coming down the hall and hastily shoved them all back in the trunk.
Harry let that sink in and felt his rage start to slip away.  Draco was right.  Harry hadn’t even realized that’s what he was doing.
He’d contacted his solicitor to ensure he wasn’t breaking any laws.  Draco had a potions lab built into the back of the bar after he bought it.  He also happened to live above the bar, and ended up buying the building along with the bar. It was one of the things he was most proud of.  Combining potions with cocktails. He tapped the chalkboard with his wand and a lovely image of a cherry cocktail appeared in red and white chalk.
Draco flopped over onto his stomach and drew the covers up to his chin. His left foot had grown cold, poking out of the bottom. He pulled that under the covers too. The sun was coming up, filling the room with unasked-for light. Draco hated mornings. Even on his mornings off, he couldn’t sleep into a normal hour any longer. He was too used to his four am shift. He hated his four am shift. Draco stared absently at the window, willing the sun to die.
“I didn’t mean- that’s beside-”  Malfoy took a breath and said more calmly, “What I mean to say is that this is what I’ve been groomed my whole life to do. Most traditional marriages in the wizarding world are built on strategic matches, not love matches.  Putting obligation above passion. Any rational person would do the same.” Malfoy went on. “People are very practical, even Muggles like Ingrid Bergman.”
“We need to retain what is left of our image after the war destroyed it,” Laghari said. Se whirled and pointed a perfectly manicured finger at Harry, “An image you personally helped to build back up.” She paced behind Shacklebolt. “People need to believe their governments are productive in order for them to actually be successful. You are an integral part of that process, whether or not you like it.” Laghari said. “You are vital to the prosperity of the ministry and wizarding society itself, surely you can see that.”
Draco felt himself being nudged, quite rudely. He cracked his eyes open and let in the glaring midday sun. It was awful. He shut his eyes again, but only for a moment before he was prodded again.
They looked at each other, searching for the next chapter of their story.  Kingley hesitated but continued when Vera smiled, confident and hospitable.
“You think I should be more like you, Potter?  Sleep with half the muggles in London.  Meanwhile not getting involved with a single witch or wizard?”
“You thought-” Harry felt the rage welling up inside him again.  “Please let me know the next time you’re giving lessons in apathy.  Teach me how to be like you, The Great Draco Malfoy- Devoid of Human Emotion.”
“Haaaaaaaaaaarrrrryyyy”  Draco drew his name out, more filthy than anything Harry had ever heard.  Draco balled his hands into fists and hit the table softly.
“It’s called a Nordic Track.” Davies announced with pride.  “This is a vintage piece of exercise equipment, very popular in America.  They’re brilliant.  It’s all the rage with muggles.  Isn’t it Harry?”
“Right. You, sir, will go to Tesco to do the shopping.” Olivia grabbed a ballpoint pen and started jotting things down on a scrap of paper. She checked the refrigerator and the cupboards and wrote a few more things down.
“MORE LIKE STALLIONS, AMIRIGHT?” George shouted. He flicked his wand and a herd of horse shaped mashed potatoes galloped across the table to Victorie’s plate.
He wasn’t sure that what the young lady served him could be considered tea. It was closer to tap water with a leafy aftertaste. Draco wasn’t about to antagonise one of the few establishments that still allowed him in by sending it back. He drank the leaf water without comment. Blaise was to meet him a half past four and it was only a quarter after. Draco could make it fifteen minutes with no one noticing him, he was sure of it. Especially here. Most people in Knockturn Alley didn’t want to draw attention to themselves.
“I recite it every day before brewing.  I’m trying to do something good, you know?  Avoid causing harm. Think of it like a spa, only with beverages.”
With that, he left. Draco watched him go and calculated the chances of Potter finding out about the incident. It didn’t bode well for him. Yet another instance of Draco making a prat of himself in public. Requiring rescue from the still Golden Trio. Abhorrent, that. But there was nothing he could do about it, he thought glumly as he turned round the bend into Knockturn Alley.
“Right you are!” Mrs Weasley came out of the kitchen. “I had a few left from breakfast so I threw them in.”
Harry would never give up the passion he had with Ginny for some political alliance.  Her fire and wit, he couldn’t live without it. Just the thought of her sent his heart racing, the soft curve of her arse, the taste of her skin. The way she- Harry blinked.  That was it.
Potter paused. His brilliant green eyes widened behind his glasses and he looked askance. “Did you just say something nice about Hermione?”
Harry waited until they’d left. He tossed the journal in the bin and set it on fire. Once the fire extinguished, he crawled back under his covers and let the mortification wash over him.
Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes.  “I don’t actually need a flat. I couldn't stay in it without Ginny anyway.  I’ve still got 12 Grimmauld Place. How’d you find a wizarding flat in muggle London, anyway?”
Hermione let go of his hand and leaned back into the sofa, with a slight frown. She let the topic drop and Harry was grateful for it.
“She didn’t start a fight with you, did she? Though being a new mum, I doubt she’d have the energy for it. Did everyone at your school have mental hair?”
Draco poured a little cream to take the edge off. It was perfect. He had made coffee like a muggle. If only his father could see him now: in his muggle flat with his muggle flatmate and his muggle job, where he wore muggle clothing. A slow smile spread over his face as he caffeinated himself.
Dudley looked at Harry with awe. “You did? Your lot was right about you, weren’t they?” He turned to Malfoy again. “Somethin else, I tell you.”
Harry wasn’t sure Draco would come with him.  Ron and Hermione knew they were friends.  They accepted it.  There was one awkward dinner, months ago, where Ron and Hermione popped by unannounced to find the pair of them watching footy.  Draco had been mid insult when they stepped through the fire.  After a few moments of shock and a significant amount of awkwardness they decided to stay.  Wine made everything easier.  Harry didn’t remember much of that night.  There was a brief memory where he walked in the kitchen to find Draco shame faced, tears rolling down his cheeks across from Hermione similarly adorned.  He quietly backed out of the room and let them have at it.  Draco never spoke of it but afterwards, Hermione seemed to thaw toward him.
Laghari finally lost her composure. “Have some common sense, here Potter! We need you to make us look efficient.”
“WELCOME!  WELCOME TO THE FINAL PERFORMANCE OF BULGARIA’S OWN VIKTOR KRUM.  HERE IN THE TOP BOX WITH US TONIGHT IS KRUM’S FAMILY. ”
“Don’t talk about Madam Pomfrey that way.” He bit back, automatically. He sighed. Harry didn’t want to fight. Neither, it seemed, did Malfoy.
They made it through another chorus.  Harry began dancing, jumping and in general making a prat of himself.  The joy was unbearable.  Draco hated it.  He never wanted the moment to end.  The two of them could go on singing silliness forever and Draco would die happily.  Decorum be damned! He couldn’t help but be taken in by Potter’s enthusiasm.  The man was such a fool and so happy doing it.
“Because eet is too ‘ardy.” Fluer said, her voice hushed. “Now ‘urry so you can greet ta tante wiz out getting ‘er dirty.” She wiped Victorie’s mouth with a napkin. Victorie hopped down from her chair and ran out the door after Ron. Fleur followed them with effortless grace.
“It’s like just after the war, and I couldn’t go anywhere without being mobbed.  Neither could he. Only it was worse for him, people were trying to hex him.”
Harry nodded and followed Ron out to the den. Mrs Weasley now sat next to Mr Weasley on the loveseat, his arm around her shoulders. They spoke in hushed tones. Ron sat at the coffee table across from George and set up the chessboard. Ginny was half draped over Neville, on the arm of a comfy chair. Bill and Fluer were ensconced on the sofa beside Hermione, with Victorie playing with a toy wand at their feet. Each time she tapped the wand against its accompanying ball, it changed to a different colour, occasionally accompanied by a chiming noise. Harry snagged a chair from the dining room and sat in it backwards, holding his nearly empty wineglass in one hand and let the ambiance of The Burrow wash over him.
Longbottom was no longer the small chubby boy Draco had bullied in school.  If he was honest, the man looked quite fit.  He wasn’t scared of Draco, that was certain.  His face was carefully constructed with polite curiosity.  His brown eyes flicked between Harry and Draco.  How close they were standing to each other. Draco coughed and took a half step away.
Harry set his fork down as soon as the door closed. What he actually needed was a headache potion. He went back to bed immediately. He was so exhausted. Tired of caring, tired of trying. Tired of giving everything that he had over and over and over again, only to wake up the next day and find he had to start the same cycle over again. He felt like his well had gone dry and there was nothing left inside him but dust. But each day someone lowered a bucket expecting water. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could sustain himself on dust and guilt. Harry pulled the covers up over his head.
“Listen, I wanted to tell you-’ Jean stopped and tried again.  “I, well.  There’s no easy way of saying this, is there?”
“He is not,” Draco lied.  Potter looked like he was debating putting the book down.  “He looks as weedy and thin as ever.”
“Alright, my darling.” Ron said to Rosie. “I’ve gotcha. We’ll just kip off for a lovely nap. A lovely six or seven-hour nap. How does that sound, eh? Who knows, maybe we’ll get in an eight-hour nap.”
“Because I cannot fathom a reason why you would try to chat me up as you are both an officer of the law and romantically involved.  With a woman!”
Ron sat beside Harry on the edge of the bed and clapped his giant freckled hand on Harry’s shoulder. Ron looked Harry dead in the eye and said slowly, as though speaking to an especially dimwitted child, “No. I don’t.”
“Oh cheer up, love. I couldn’t be too bad. You were just kids, after all.” She patted his arm and steered him toward the checkout counter. “We’ll stop and get you a nice chocolate button, then, eh?”
A small and confused smile took over Mrs Weasley’s face. Like the one she had when Mr Weasley brought home a new muggle gadget. “I’m not sure what you mean, dear.”
They were kicked out of the cafe a few minutes later.  Harry hadn’t even noticed how late it was. They strolled together through the evening in Diagon Alley.  Lanterns hung outside the shop entrances lighting the way. A few had magical winking fairy lights strung along outdoor seating.  Harry preferred Diagon Alley in the evenings. Not only because he was recognized less often but it just all seemed so much more….  Magical. Strolling through the evening talking to Malfoy he’d never felt farther from Privet Drive.
“Dementors? No. They’ve been relocated.” Harry glanced at Malfoy, who refused to meet his eye. “It’s safe now.”
“One in every corner you can find.” Hermione replied, barely glancing at them. She pulled out a roll of parchment and began crossing things off. “Harry, I need you on toadstool duty next.”
Draco did not respond.  He had five minutes left before he needed to take over for Lou and he still needed to add the alihotsy he was muddling.  Pansy continued to swipe through potentials on her mobile.
Draco was grateful enough time had passed since the war that he was no longer hexed in the streets.  His gradual re-integration into Wizarding society didn’t seem as monumental as he’d thought it would in his twenties.   Life in the Muggle world had done him good. Mellowed him out, gave him perspective. Meeting Pansy at Flourish & Blotts ten years ago would be terrifying.  Now it was commonplace. They’d meet up just as often at random muggle bookshops. Pansy always said she accompanied him out of loyalty but never failed to leave a bookshop without a few tawdry romance novels.
Harry glanced out the window at the setting sun. “Oh, er.. Not bad, I suppose.” Harry grabbed another roll and coated it with butter. He tried not to focus on Ginny shouting at George in the next room over. He hoped she hadn’t brought Neville with her. It was awkward enough staying at your ex-girlfriend’s family gatherings after you’ve split. But having her bring her not-so-new boyfriend made Harry seem even more of an outsider. Not that his feelings should have any bearing on Ginny’s life. Not anymore. Christ, he was a selfish prat.
Draco didn’t want to stop.  He never wanted to stop.  He could spend the rest of his life watching those green eyes blown wide with lust.   He could die now and die happily.
The shouting drew quite a crowd. He heard the murmuring grow louder. Someone spit at his feet. Draco continued to stare at the ground. If this was how he met his end, it was a far better ending than he deserved.
Shit. Shit shit shit. Draco marched back to the potions room. He looked down at his simmering cauldron. After a minute or so, the timing charm went off, sending red sparks above the cauldron and letting out a lovely chiming noise. Next, it needed another four turns anti clockwise before he could stop and let it cool down. Then he needed to add the powdered moonstone. It would have to sit overnight before he could bottle it and then..
“Right there- mmmm.   Oh,” he was a little louder.  He made several breathy noises, his chest rising and falling quickly.
Potter merely shrugged. “Ginny packed them for me.  Besides, who brings pomegranates as a snack? At least you don’t need a knife to eat grapes.”
“I’m not following you, Malfoy.” Harry tried to sound casual. “Should I be? Are you hiding something?”
Draco was well aware of her bat bogey hex.  Blaise described it with such admiration Draco suspected the man had fallen a little in love with her sixth year.  Before everything turned to shit.
Hermione’s face grew more concerned as she read on. By the end, her mouth became a thin line. When she closed the journal, she looked at Harry with something akin to alarm.
“Nah, mate. Harry’s right, innit. That was my reaction too.” Dudley said, shaking his head. He looked back and forth between them intently for a moment. “How are things?”
Malfoy stopped smiling, his face pensive.  “What’s happening here, Potter?” He indicated the pair of them with his long elegant finger.
“But it, er, looks fine in the corner there, I suppose.”  Harry glanced at Draco’s horrified face.  “Or, it’s terrible?”
“I’m getting married, Drake.” Jean couldn’t keep the joy out of his voice.  He was putting forth quite a lot of effort to sound neutral.  Draco couldn’t decide if it was out of pity or some warped sense of professionalism.  “I didn’t want you to hear it from anyone else.  Thought it might be in poor taste.”
There was a beat of silence at the table. All at once, the Weasleys started shouting at each other. Fluer was the notable exception to this behaviour.
Draco held out his arm, the unmarked one. Potter glanced at him, questioning, and Draco nodded.  Potter gave a firm nod back and held his wand to Draco’s forearm. A rope of blue light slid out from the top of the wand onto his arm. Draco tried not to flinch at the near (but not quite) burning sensation it left.  The light wrapped itself around Draco’s forearm twice and then into the shape of the ministry seal over them. He hissed through his teeth as it sunk into his arm, glowing brighter for a moment before the light dimmed to a barely there glow.
“Shorts.. Shorts..,” Weasley thought for a second before resuming his yelling, “Shortened Life!  Life is Beautiful!”
” he imitated Draco’s pronunciation of the word. “Never once has Draco Malfoy spent his nights brooding over The Golden Boy.”
Jacinda waved him off. “Oh no. He and Olivia have got a flat here in London.” She finished the last of her drink. It was a pale yellow, bubbly something and smelled faintly of gin.
“Now you’re getting it,” Laghari said with a pleased smile. She woefully misread the timber of Harry’s voice.
Hermione perched on the edge of Harry’s unmade bed. Ron flicked his wand at Harry’s clothes. They flew into the hamper. He gathered up a pile of dishes and padded down the stairs.
Harry wondered if Draco had ever tried growing facial hair but wisely decided not to ask.  “Felt like it was time for a change is all.  I’ll probably grow it back.”
Draco glared at him. “I said: I. Should. Not. Have. Said. That. Lost your hearing along with your parents, Potter?” he sneered. Draco turned and moved farther down the aisle. He looked up at the blue signage for a bread aisle. Maybe if he pretended this wasn’t happening, it would stop happening.
Hermione’s cheeks coloured in the rapidly spreading silence. Ron’s eyes bugged out as he looked at his mother in horror.
“Shut it, you.” He said to Malfoy. He turned back to Dudley, “Things are.. Fine?” Harry had no idea where this was going. Was he asking about his and Malfoy’s relationship? Twice? What planet was he on where Dudley was concerned about his relationships? Reality felt another step back, like this day was looking through a foe-glass and everything was just a little out of focus.
“I got home and told Jean, the thing was we’d never gone to Paris together.  I mean five years together and we’d never once gone to see his family in France.”
“I am not interested in dating at the moment.   Pansy, have you failed to notice my very prominent homosexuality?  I seem to recall a terrible decision from fourth year where we decided to test that theory, met with disastrous results.”
“I can’t believe you’ve split up!"  she went back to the mirror to fine tune the fringe that had come out of place in her outburst.  " I mean, for pity's sake.  You had someone in your life! And you’ve let it go to waste.”
“Two weeks after graduation we were married.”  Molly continued. “I lost my two brothers in the first war.” Her eyes began to fill with tears.  “We lost our son in the second war.”
“Forget it.”  he said. If Malfoy was determined to misunderstand Harry’s every word there was no point in trying to explain himself.
“Hiya.” Ginny said cautiously, walking in. She looked stunning in a green strapless gown of some material that couldn’t be muggle. It seemed to flutter behind her for just a moment too long to be natural, like she’d just stepped off a broomstick. Neville, too, looked dressed up. Harry couldn’t remember seeing him in a suit or dress robes since the last Hogwarts Memorial gala he’d attended a few years ago. Seeing them dressed up together put Harry a little on edge. The rest of the family filed back to their chairs behind them. Mr Weasley conjured two more for Ginny and Neville. Night had fallen and Mrs Weasley lit a few extra lanterns while she was up.
Harry grinned and tugged him forward into the rest of the house.  Harry barely recognized the place.  Hermione had clearly been at work with the expansion charms.  The cottage looked more like a Tudor hall or something registered with the National Trust.  Huge brown beams led to a large vaulted ballroom where their sitting room used to be with beautiful hardwood floors.
Harry closed his eyes a moment to appreciate his own stupidity before he trotted to catch up with Draco.
“No, you didn’t.” Draco spat.  “I haven’t been up to anything.  I haven’t been rebuilding my father’s nefarious network of followers.  I haven’t been harassing muggles in the streets. I haven’t been up to a bloody thing.”
Narcissa Malfoy sat primly on the edge of the sofa in the very centre.  Her full skirted black robes draped elegantly on either side of her. Her back was straight, her ankles crossed, and her hands folded gracefully in her lap.  The hair that had once been black turned a steely grey with a white streak pulled up from her widow's peak into an elaborate bun.
“I mean, you know. What are you doing here?” The irritating man gestured broadly around them. He was impossible. Potter took a step closer to him. Draco swallowed.
Malfoy threw Harry a disdainful glance, “I’ve read them, you neanderthal.  That’s beside the point. Would you kindly shut it so that I can enjoy quidditch in peace?”
“Harry, we were really counting on your help.” Shacklebolt frowned. He leaned forward and clasped his hands on the enormous desk. “The Ministry needs your support. The public values your opinion too highly for you not to use it for the greater good.”
“Oh, come on Malfoy. You are the last person in the world who’d think I was perfect. You were taking the piss every chance you got. Or do you not remember when you made badges that said Potter Stinks and got half the school to wear them!”
The single pint Harry had at the Drunken Doxy had long since worn off. Along with the encumbrance that came with drinking in public. Harry didn’t bother with the light and made right for the drinks trolley Kreacher kept well stocked. He poured himself a generous measure of Firewhisky. When Harry first graduated from Auror training, he, Hermione, and Ron spent their weekends at Grimmauld Place plotting its renovation. Often interspersed with threats of total demolition from Harry. But life rather got in the way. He and Ron started to get cases. Hermione began working her way up the ladder of Magical Law. The plans never came to fruition. In fact, the only room that got finished was the master suite. They’d converted the entire wall facing the back garden into thick glass. They tore the old carpeting up to expose dark wood flooring. His four poster king-size bed was draped with deep burgundy curtains. It was sat in the middle of a deep fluffy white rug meant to resemble animal fur. There was a desk on the wall facing the street. Harry found himself watching the streets below rather than getting anything useful done. His bedroom also contained a fireplace, not hooked up to the Floo network. Eventually, Harry tired of standing in front of the glass wall and levitated his armchair over.
“We’ve already finished helping your nan.” Harry replied.  “What do you reckon, Ron? Think they can take us?”
“I’ve literally never seen you upset about Jean.  Not once! How is that possible?  Did you not care about him at all?”
“Obviously it would be a blank wall.  That was my first thought, of course.  A blank wall.”  It wasn’t.  He had no idea what Harry was talking about.
He stormed out, slamming the door behind him. The crowd of onlookers surrounding the Head Auror Office dispersed immediately, all looking terribly busy suddenly. Breanne had been waiting to take Harry to his next appointment. He stormed past her. Harry didn’t give a shit. He was sick of the ministry and its bollocks agenda. Ten years later, and it was the same fucking problem.
“I will not!  They need to know!  You think this will last forever? It won’t! You think your harmless arguments about horrible American exercise equipment are endearing but it’s not going to last.  Eventually you will be fighting over every fork and knife in this flat.  I would say furniture, BUT YOU HAVEN’T GOT ANY BLEEDING FURNITURE OTHER THAN THIS MISERABLE SOFA.”
Malfoy’s grin became rueful.  “I have to say that’s one of the reasons I was so keen on being friends when we were eleven.  I thought if I could have you as my friend I wouldn’t need lots of friends, because I’d have the best person in the world as my friend.”
Harry hesitated. Well. It was a muggle cafe, after all. It was fine. He was fine. “Harry. Harry Potter.”
The broccoli, shaped like pirates, now fought each other across the table and collapsed into a pile on Harry’s plate. Victorie giggled with delight. Bill and Fluer shared a smile at her giggle.
Five minutes later they reached the Port Key Arrival outside the quidditch pitch out of breath and grinning like fools.  Jean put his hands in his pockets and held out the crook of his elbow. Draco smirked at him and looped his own arm through. They made their way through the crowd to the Top Box.  If there were a few detours to dark corners to continue their previous activities, well Draco wasn’t going to complain.
“I’m serious!” Potter shouted.   They seemed to wilt under his fiery gaze.  “Honestly” he muttered, once they started dispersing.  “Sorry about that, Malfoy.”
consumed. Roger Davies got into an argument with George about the dangers of joke broomsticks. Davies recently transferred to the Wimborne Wasps after a few years with the Holyhead Harpies.  He and Harry had become friends when he played for the Harpies with Ginny.  He held very strong opinions on brooms.  Davies had done very well the last two years, becoming quite the popular public figure.  George didn’t give a shit.  Harry carefully avoided their argument.
He dimmed the lights in the kitchen after Mrs Weasley left, finding them a little too bright. Harry always resented doing the dishes for the Dursleys. Being made to clean up while they enjoyed ice creams and puddings in the next room. He suffered none of that resentment cleaning up after The Weasleys. They had given him so much. They’d been through so much on his behalf. Mrs Weasley had lost her brothers and a son in the wars he, albeit indirectly, caused. If all Harry could give her was a night off from cleaning, he was glad to do it.
Draco had been about to put her in her place with a smug “obviously.” when he caught the look on her face. His spirits sank. “Was I not supposed to?”
“Yes, Harry is rarely drawn to well dressed blonde men.” She said shrewdly.  Granger looked at Draco, really looked at him.  He fully understood in that moment why Wizengamot was terrified of her.  “Luc seems lovely.” she said.
Potter threw an angry glance over his shoulder at Draco before swiftly pecking the Weaselette on the cheek.
Hermione scoffed and stepped away, “I always think you need a hug, Harry.” She turned to Ron and handed him the journal. “I think you better read for yourself”
Draco bit his lip. This could be his way in. He also reevaluated his conception of mobiles. They weren’t sentient, of course they weren’t. They were communication devices of some sort.
“But that’s because you’re stupid.” Draco sighed into Harry’s shoulder.  Draco could feel the deep reverberations of Harry’s laugh.
He wove his way through the throng of blathered patrons up to the bar and queued for a pint. In twenty minutes, no fewer than five men came up to him, offering to buy him a drink. One man in a mesh top came right out and asked to take Harry home. It only added to the restless energy dancing in his veins. He sat at the side of the bar where he could watch the ebb and flow of the muggles to the entrance.
“I know, I know..” She sighed, “He’s never going to leave her.”  She examined her reflection in the display window, standing in different positions.  She squeezed her cleavage together. “What about a permanent engorgement charm?”
Harry remembered his awkward dates with Cho when she wanted to talk about Cedric Diggory. He couldn’t imagine how much worse it must be for that person to be your twin rather than your rival. There was so much to unpack. Could any relationship sustain that much pressure? Christ, how horrible.
Draco started giggling quietly at the thought of this muggle woman trying to comfort him. In a situation he could have fixed in a matter of moments. They heard another crash from the other side of the doors.
Harry was secretly grateful that Ginny was out of the country playing a match against Turkey.  Even though he was over it, Harry still felt flashes of guilt and embarrassment at the Weasley events she was in town for.
He thought of the way Malfoy introduced him to his friends. Bought him a drink. Made sure he felt safe when he left. “I wasn’t not on a date.”
Together, Hermione and Harry manoeuvred Ron to the front room. They plopped him onto the sofa in front of the fireplace. Ron grinned up at his wife. “Love you.”
“Shit.” Ron stood up and scratched his nose.  “Yeah, we went to a football match.  Me, Davies, Neville, Malfoy and Luc.  We’d have invited you but..”
Two loud things happened almost simultaneously that woke Harry from brooding. Not that he brooded, because, as previously mentioned, he was fine. The first loud thing was that Olivia called out, “Take away for Harry, Harry Potter.” The second was a loud crash from the kitchen immediately following this statement.
Harry nodded.  “Followed her, didn’t I.  Morbid curiosity I suppose.  I just wanted to see this place she was going to be living her Harry Potter-free life.  But it wasn’t her team mate’s flat. It was Neville’s.”
Harry ached for them all and what should have been. The lives they should have had.  He ached for Lupin and Tonks. For Teddy. For Colin Creevey and Dennis. They were only kids. Harry wiped a tear from his face. He flat out refused to think about Fred and George. If he had gone to the forest sooner, would Fred still be alive?
“Talk to you?” Draco stopped and turned to face him, at a complete loss. “Why on earth do you want to talk to me? And why is there a jumper section in this place? I thought it was a supermarket?” Draco privately congratulated himself on using the term correctly. “Why would I buy clothing from a place that wraps its veg in plastic? Do you understand this place, Potter?”
“Where is Malfoy living these days? Is he still in Wiltshire?” Harry asked carefully, dragging his eyes back to Olivia, who slid into Draco’s place across from Harry.
As soon as they landed, Ron emptied the contents of his stomach into the garden. The noise brought Hermione to the door immediately. The concern etched into her face upon opening the door transitioned into amusement. She snagged an umbrella from the entryway and walked over to the boys.
“Obviously. We are in a muggle club, do try to keep up.” Malfoy turned and disappeared into the crowd.
“You look really fit in muggle clothes,” the words spilled out of Harry's mouth without his permission.  He tried to ignore the flush in his cheeks.  And because he couldn't stop himself, "Like that leather jacket you used to wear."  He ran a hand up the back of his neck, "with the skinny jeans?"
Draco didn’t laugh.  Neither did Potter. They didn’t hex or curse each other.  Both their noses remained intact and unbroken.  Draco struggled a moment to identify the alien emotion he was feeling.  Sympathy. He was feeling sympathy. Specifically he was feeling sympathy for Potter.
Once they arrived at the DMLE station Harry led Malfoy to the Portkey Centre.  Harry nodded at the Portkey Officer and took the offered empty crisp packet.
After the plates were cleared, most of the Weasley clan settled in the den to shout their ideas for the cookbook at Hermione, who ignored them, deeply intent on her notes.
“Oh, not you too.” He rolled his eyes. “You could look less appalled, you know. I’ve enough of that from my flatmate.”
“Course it is.” Harry said, bracingly.  He glanced down at Draco’s outfit. His robes were a pale blue colour.  They had a high collar, and ended mid thigh in the front, but the back side had tails that went down past his knees.   The trousers beneath them were a fine dove grey wool. “That what you’re wearing?”
“Granger.” he said with some trepidation. He wasn’t sure what to do with his hands. Should he offer to shake hands? Stick them in his pockets? Would she think he was trying to go for his wand like Potter had?
Technically speaking they were potions and did not contain much alcohol.  But because of the phrasing, he could ask people how they wanted to feel and give them a potion to accomplish this.  Just this side of legal. He was very proud indeed.
Draco narrowed his eyes as he handed over the coins. He stalked out of the shop amid further whisperings. Just as the door closed, Draco felt something sizzle and fly by his cheek. He wished it was pure luck he’d taken to wearing one of the shield hats from Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes instead of wearing it for necessity. It took too much effort to maintain a shield around his person and still be able to manouevre the shops. The charmed hat would have to do.
“I don’t know what else to tell you, Draco.” Blaise paused. He clapped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I’m sorry.” Blaise looked at Draco for a long moment before he stepped into the fireplace and disappeared.
Honestly, Draco didn’t. Not that he’d say so to this man, who was clearly grieving. Draco couldn’t even meet his eyes. What was there to say? That it was true? That he regretted everything about his life? That he was sorry? As if that would make any difference. It didn’t sway public opinion at his trial and it wouldn’t make a difference now. Draco did nothing to defend himself.
Harry made his way back to the booth with his drink. He felt numb, but did his best to answer Dudley’s questions about Hogwarts. Malfoy picked up on his mood shift and shot him concerned looks through the rest of the conversation.
Hermione and Ron glanced at each other while the others were distracted. His arm draped across the back of her chair. He leaned in and planted a kiss on her temple. Harry watched the tension drain out of her shoulders. Hermione closed her eyes and leaned into Ron’s shoulder. He murmured something in her ear and she smiled softly up at him. Harry’s heart ached.
Harry should feel fine about it.  A dinner party was nothing to worry about.  But Harry rarely brought home dates.  Even more rarely exposed them to his friends.  They were mostly muggles and didn’t particularly matter.  Andrew was the first guy he’d brought home, so to speak.  The fame didn’t phase him, which was refreshing.  There was something about him that Harry found compelling, he couldn’t put a finger on what it was exactly.  Maybe the fine American accent or the fancy clothes.
Harry’s cheeks flushed.  His eyes darted around to the other patrons.  They were now drawing the attention of everyone in the pub.  Harry made sure his hands were clearly visible on the table top and his feet planted on the floor.  Watching Malfoy hitting the table repeatedly with his fists, throwing his head back moaning his name was a car crash Harry couldn't look away from.  One that made his toes curl and his mouth dry.
“I just-” Harry sighed.  “I never noticed it before.”  Harry lied. Dreams didn’t count, really.  “You looked a bit.. sad. I was trying to be encouraging.”
As they were passing Weasley Wizarding Wheezes George caught Harry through the shop front and gave him a nod.  Harry nodded back. He watched George’s eyes clock Draco beside him and raised an eyebrow. Harry tried to ignore the colour in his cheeks as George gave him a final querying look before he turned back to his customer.
“We order dinner and the conversation’s a bit stinted, so I ask her about quidditch in America. And out of nowhere I’m having a full meltdown.”
Draco hated the way it sounded coming out of his mouth, the waver in his voice.  Self loathing curled about his stomach, settling in like a heavy meal.
Malfoy continued on, as though Harry hadn’t interrupted. “Saint Potter, who hands out autographs to his adoring fans.”
Harry blinked at her and smiled back.  He sank into the seat beside Malfoy and stretched his legs out.
“Of course I know where food comes from. It’s just that I am never the one to get it. I get takeaway. Or go out.”
“Are you insinuating that if I do not immediately resume dating that I will be hit by a bludger and die?  You’re awfully optimistic today.”
“It just seems so..  Expected.” Malfoy offered.  “So.. tidy. You marry your best friend’s sister and everyone lives happily ever after.  That’s not you.”
“It’s alright, mate.” Ron clapped him on the back. “But I’m serious about the mind healer. You’ve got shit to work through.”
Laghari glanced at Shacklebolt, who watched Harry’s reaction carefully. She slid the parchment across the desk for Harry to see.
Harry glanced at him but was too wound up to allow himself to be calmed down.  “Do yourselves a favor!  Write your names in everything!  Every sodding book you own!  Otherwise you’ll spend thousands of pounds in litigation deciding who gets this copy of Quidditch Through the Ages.  Never mind it was given to me as a gift!”
Malfoy sat back in his seat and turned back to the match.  “No you’re not. It’d be all over The Prophet. Saviour of the Wizarding World marries a famous Quidditch Player.  There’s no way to keep that quiet.”
“I have decided.” he said in an American cowboy accent. “That for thuh rest awf thuh day we will tawk like thee-us.”
Malfoy was in Muggle clothes. And not even overly posh ones. Just an expensive looking tight t-shirt and black designer jeans. He was unrecognisable from who Harry knew at school and yet unmistakably Malfoy. No one else had his grey eyes. The high cheekbones and pointed chin. His beautifully pale collar bone that Harry wanted to-
Harry felt caught in the moment and their eyes met.  Malfoy tugged the left sleeve of his jacket down. A floral tattoo was poking out from the sleeve of his leather jacket.  He probably did understand, come to that.
“The oldest one is around five, you see.  And she drew a group of stick figures holding hands.  Two parents, the children in the middle. Well, I say children, they could have been anything really.  She really has the most awful sense of artistry. Then she wrote ‘my family’ at the top beneath the most ridiculous rendering of the sun I’ve ever seen.  As though the sun has a face, let alone a smiling one.”
Draco didn’t see how being alone could possibly be as bad as Pansy made it out to be.  Getting out of a dead end relationship wasn't letting anything go to waste.  He suspected her misery stemmed from the marital status of her lover more than anything else.
Harry made it out the door successfully this time. He wove between the crowd of Londoners, eyes darting across the building fronts. Looking for an alleyway he could use to appearate. A flash of blonde caught his eye and Harry glanced over to see a small gap between buildings. Perfect. Harry made his way over. He debated heading further in and appearating from behind the bins, but he was in a hurry and needed his wand for this. Harry transferred the bags to one hand and dug through his pockets. His wand wasn’t there. He swore quietly and shifted the bags again to search his other pocket. A wave of relief washed over him when his hand found the familiar Holly. He appearated on the spot with a loud CRACK and landed in The Burrow’s back garden.
Harry slept in the next two days. It felt glorious, luxurious even. He couldn’t remember a time in his life he’d been able to sleep as long as he liked for days on end. No Dursleys to cook for. No breakfast in the Great Hall. No Auror training. No office hours at The Ministry. No spending the weekend dreading Monday’s arrival. Just sleep. Harry checked his watch and decided not to get up yet.
Draco set up immediately. From years of disappointment in the selection of pre-bottled potions at Slug & Jiggers, he knew there was a market for them. He started with Pepper-Up Potion, which he happened to have everything he needed. Plus, it only took a few hours, which meant he’d have the first batch ready by the time Blaise was home. Draco lost himself in careful measurements, precise dicing, and perfectly timed stirring.
“Olivia,” he repeated. He gave her a lopsided grin and counted out the fifty quid. When a spot opened up at a small table, Harry sat and waited, his foot bouncing. It was going to be fine. Because he was doing fine. Ginny was fine. More than fine. She was getting married. He genuinely was happy for Ginny. Their breakup wasn’t exactly gut wrenching. It wasn’t even a breakup, really. After the war, they never got back together.They went out a few times, but it didn’t sit right. She seemed far away. Part of an existence Harry knew nothing about. A former life to which he couldn’t return. They mostly avoided looking at each other. When she made eye contact, there was no blaze of passion like before. Instead, Harry found pity in her eyes and he hated it.
Draco swallowed the horrible lump that had risen in his throat. He nodded, “Fantastic. Thank you. I’ll ow-write you. I’ll write you.”
“So what, you’re living as a muggle now?”  Harry looked Malfoy up and down, taking in the jeans, the t-shirt beneath his leather jacket, and christ he was wearing a beanie.  “And you’re with Jean?”
Ron eyed it disparagingly, “This seems like a lot of wasted effort.” But he wiped as Harry washed. Harry wondered if this was what it would have been like as a child of The Burrow. Washing up with a brother instead of alone. It seemed nice.
“I was only eleven when I first saw Arthur,” she said.  “We were in the same year at Hogwarts but I didn’t see him during the Sorting.  I was sitting at the Gryffindor table the next morning beside my friend Emily.” Molly turned to Arthur beside her and looped her arm through his. “And this man” she leaned her head on Arthur’s shoulder, “walked into the Great Hall, headed for our table.  I turned to Emily and said ‘You see that boy? I’m going to marry him.’”
“Oh!” the light came on. “That’s where I’ve heard the name! Harry, Harry Potter mentioned her. They’re friends, aren’t they?”
“I LOST MY BROTHER BECAUSE OF YOU!” He screamed at Draco, flecks of spittle flew out in every direction.
“Oh, piss off,” she said without any heat. “So what happened?” She found the remote and tossed that at him, too.
Sometimes Harry spent hours rethinking The Battle of Hogwarts. He could have worked harder, fought faster. How ultimately, Malfoy had saved Harry’s life earlier in the year. How Harry was only returning the favour for not identifying him at the Manor. What it felt like to have Malfoy’s arms around his waist, with the heat chasing them.
“You’re not coming with?” Draco may not have entirely succeeded in keeping the panic out of his voice.
Granger glanced at Olivia, who was pretending the Nescafe in her hands was the most interesting piece of literature she’d ever happened upon.
After a few minutes, Ginny cleared her throat. Harry’s stomach tightened. He watched her grab Neville’s hand. Neville who looked up at her as though she were Felix Felisis come to life. Ginny took a deep breath and tried clearing her throat again, more aggressively this time. Neville beamed at her and squeezed her hand. Did no one else see what was going on? Harry glanced at Mr and Mrs Weasley. Then at Bill and Fluer. At George. Finally, at Ron and Hermione. Hermione’s eyes were enormous, and she covered her mouth with her hands.
The mug in Draco’s hand dropped to the floor and broke, scattering shards of pottery about.  Granger whipped out her wand and waved it.  The mug repaired itself while Draco continued to gape like a fish.
“Er.. Sorry, mate. We meant to ask you along, too. Ginny got the tickets at a discount. She plays in the same league.”
Harry tried to suppress any secret delight that Malfoy tracked his dating life at Hogwarts. He sat up straight and fixed his glasses. Of course Draco paid attention. How else could he have humiliated Harry so astutely? The valentine Ginny’d sent second year still haunted his dreams. Not so much the valentine itself, but Malfoy finding it and then reciting it from memory.
“I’ll hold you to it.” Draco murmured.  Harry drew back to look at him.  He’d forgotten what they’d been talking about, lost in thoughts of nuzzling.  Draco’s eyes were dove grey with small flecks of blue around the rim.  Harry hadn’t noticed that particular detail before. How had he missed that?  The air was thick between them.  Harry opened his mouth to speak but found he had nothing to say.  Draco’s eyes flicked down to his mouth.  Harry’s stomach did somersaults.
Malfoy was right, though.  The match was on. Harry dragged his eyes away from the blue strands hiding beneath Malfoy’s beanie and forced himself to find the snitch.
Weasley turned to the onlookers, “Alright. Bugger off, you lot! No one’s getting their bollocks hexed off.”
“YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE” he screamed at the phone. Draco hadn’t realised they gave mobiles names, or that they had sentience. He wasn’t sure how he felt about this revelation. How could a small rectangle made of glass and plastic be offensive?
“Harry Potter, apologize to Pansy Parkinson?  What is the world coming to?” Draco said softly against his neck. Harry ignored the warmth that spread through his body at Draco’s touch.  He stepped back and cleared his throat.
Ron and Harry turned to the new voice coming through the field.  Teddy and Victorie came running up the path.
“Everything alright back there?” She glanced glanced over her shoulder, “New pastry chef.” Olivia turned back to Harry and whispered, “He’s a bit daft sometimes. He doesn’t even have a
Granger didn’t smile. She looked from him to his muggle friend and back to him. Some of the colour had returned to her cheeks. She stuck out her hand to Olivia.
Harry volunteered for kitchen duty. Mrs Weasley tried to take the plates out of his hands, but he ducked around her.
He coughed politely. They ignored him, naturally.  Draco’s eyes darted around the platform. The Ministry’s platform was just crowded enough that most people ignored him.  Only a few scathing looks were pointed his direction, upon recognition. Fifteen minutes until departure.
Harry nodded and Draco continued. “No marriage.  No children. We could catch a port key to Paris, floo to Fiji.  We were free! We could make love in front of the fireplace without having to worry about stepping on lego or storey books.  It was almost a relief to finally be with someone who was on the same page.
“Hand her over, love,” he said to Hermione. “I’ll take Rosie, you take Harry.” Hermione nodded and handed the screaming child over.
“I have been laid often and well Auror Potter!” Malfoy said loudly.  The noise in the dining card stopped entirely, all heads swiveled in their direction.
“Lovely to see you both.  Please excuse us.” Draco nodded at them and trotted to catch up with Harry.
Draco slid a drink across the bar to Harry who sipped it.  Delight spread over his face and Draco grinned. “It’s good, eh?”
Pomona Sprout sat down on the sofa at the same time as Herb.  They smiled warmly at each other. Their faces were covered in age spots.  Pomona’s hair was fading from steely gray to white. Herb had no hair left at all.  They wore the comfortable clothing of the elderly. Soft robes with large clasps in solid colours.  Pomona’s purple robes had cat hairs along the collar, as did the bottom of Herb’s cloak.
Draco had anticipated the answer was the same now as it was at age eleven. It still hurt to hear out loud.  He turned to the window.
“Sure it is.”  Harry said, absently.  He was leaning on the door frame with the curtain pushed back.
He blinked at her, startled. He didn’t know that, actually. And it threw him a bit to hear it announced casually, the same tone that Olivia would use to comment on the weather . His own mother had only said it twice that he could recall. Not that Draco didn’t know they loved him. He knew his mother loved him very much. It simply wasn’t communicated verbally, as very few things were. Draco’s family lived a life of implications and unspoken social constructs.
Draco couldn't stop the smile forming if he’d been stupefied.  “Cause I’m Mr. Brightside.” he joined in again.  He wasn’t as confident.  But he picked it up.  He’d finally got the last line when he noticed Harry had gone still.
“Right. Mary Berries. She is..” Draco chewed on his lip. “Irreplaceable?” he said slowly, relieved when Olivia agreed.
“I was looking after Theo’s children one day.  They sat at the table in the kitchen drawing pictures.  Terrible artists, I must say.”
Draco turned around quickly at the distress in Harry’s voice.  He watched Harry take a bracing gulp from his drink.
Harry flicked a finger at the gramophone. The needle returned to the beginning, and he listened to the song again.
Draco sprang up from his seat and ran behind the counter toward her. She clung to him, shaken, but not crying, thank Merlin.
Olivia’s face lit up like a Christmas tree. She gave Harry a full inspection, from the bottoms of his raggedy jeans to the tight fitting, if threadbare, t-shirt that wrapped around Harry’s biceps like clingfilm. She turned to smirk at Malfoy. “It’s interesting because Harry, here, doesn’t seem Posh at all.”
Her face fell with exaggerated exasperation.  “What would you know about tits, anyway. Should have asked Blaise.”
“You know what? Don’t worry about it.” Harry did a good show of pretending it didn’t gut him that his best mates to see the Chudley Cannons without him. Which was easy to do, because it didn’t bother him at all. Not one bit. Harry was fine.
“Well.”  Malfoy said when Harry lowered his wand.  Harry watched him tug the sleeve of his robes down.  “This is the part where you leave.” Malfoy said pointedly.
“You’ll be alright.”  Harry turned and placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead.  “You want tea?  I can put the kettle on.”
“Come inside, love” She waved her wand and vanished the sick. She and Harry each grabbed an arm and brought Ron into the cottage. Harry wandlessly dried out their robes and Hermione looked curiously over Ron’s shoulder at Harry.
“Harry, thank god!” Hermione exclaimed when he walked through the back door. “Just bring those in here.” Harry set the pastry boxes down. With a flick of her wand, Hermione sent the pastries dancing through the air and lined up perfectly on some fancy long rectangular plates he didn’t recognise. “I was expecting you fifteen minutes ago.”
“Thanks for seeing to Ron.” She stood up with Harry, letting Ron’s legs fall to the floor. Harry wrapped his arms around Hermione and she kissed him on the cheek. He turned to Ron, who was finally out cold, and smiled Harry’s first genuine smile of the day. Or week, if thought about it. Christ, that was depressing.
Draco shook his head, silently signaling Harry to shut up already.  Harry didn’t care.  “And then!  Then it’s six years later and you’re singing karaoke at a shop like a complete idiot and in she walks with the person she left you for!”
Hermione arched an eyebrow at Harry, who scowled at the filthy traitor that was his best mate. “It was fine, really.” Harry said.
“I tried to warn you, Minister,” Laghari said. Her long black hair fell down her back in perfect waves. “He hasn’t the slightest idea of the consequences of his actions in the matter.”
“THE FAMOUS HARRY POTTER JOINING THE TOP BOX AS WELL.  CHEERS, MATE! CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF MY, HARRY IS. WENT TO HOGWARTS TOGETHER.”
Kreacher nodded encouragingly, “Very good Master. Friends is good for lifting Master’s spirits.” He shuffled into the sitting room, muttering under his breath.
“Let it go, mate. Don’t get obsessed with Malfoy again.” Ron squeezed his shoulder. “Take a shower. Get dressed. We’ll swing by and pick you up for dinner later.”
“I wasn’t accusing you of anything! Jesus!” Potter shouted back at him.  “I was only making small talk.”
“Harry, her brother is your best mate.  It’s a wonder you’ve managed to avoid her for so long.  You’re practically family.”
Harry felt himself being manoeuvred. The pain in his forehead receded to the memory it was. He kept his eyes closed until he felt the cool night air on his face. He felt a brick wall at his back and took a few steadying breaths before he opened his eyes.
He got a quill out and tapped it against a blank journal. He’d start with first year. That was when everything started. Diagon Alley, Hagrid, The Owlery, Malfoy at Madam Malkins.
“You are going to love it, Draco. I don’t watch the normal one, though. That’s for pensioners. The Cats’ version is the ticket.”
Hermione pursed her lips and set down her mug. “Harry, I know this isn’t what you thought you’d be doing as an Auror. I don’t want you to think that you can’t talk to us about it. Just because Ron’s loving it doesn’t mean you have to, as well.”
He looked up to find Blaise Zabini standing at this side. Draco stood and shook his hand. “Please, sit down” he gestured toward the chair, “And no, I wasn’t brooding. I never brood.”
Harry grinned.  He was twisted around in his chair to see Malfoy.  The woman beside him was watching their exchange.
“Is that what you do, Malfoy?  Regulate yourself?  That’s why you’ve only been with, how many?  Is it none?  You’ve been with no one since Jean?  Because you’re in control of your emotions?”
Harry tilted his head and squinted.  He shoved his glasses up and settled down into the sofa with his arm around Andrew.  They looked very cozy for having been dating three weeks.  Not that Draco was keeping track.  Andrew turned and smiled up at Harry.  Harry brushed a stray lock of blonde hair out of his face.  Draco felt a bit sick.
Thankfully Draco let it drop.  They parted ways at The Leaky Cauldron and Harry stomped down all thoughts of Malfoy on a date in fit muggle clothing.
Olivia giggled, which hardly seemed appropriate given the situation. “Did you just call Franc a muppet?”
“We have a grinder for that.” She opened one of the top cupboard doors and pulled out a black and silver contraption with a cord coming out of it. “You just take the lid off, pour the beans in, and press the button.”
They left the party separately.  Draco said goodnight to Ron and Hermione before leaving out the front door and disappearing into the dark.  Harry watched him go and flooed back to Grimmuald place not long after.  He ignored all thoughts of Draco’s cologne and the way he’d moaned Harry’s name in the pub all those weeks ago.
They sat in silence, that Draco was more than willing to cultivate.  Potter, it seemed, couldn’t manage it.
“I can’t believe how wrong you are.  You’re muggleborn. Doesn’t that grant you some better understanding of how they work?”
“Ugh, don't remind me.  I will never get my first kiss back, Draco.  I’m just saying, you don’t want to wait too long, love.  Marcus Belby took a bludger to the head, died instantly only just last year.”
“Laars likes you!  You must be falling in love.  He only likes people in love.”  She turned away and went to answer the front door, another two glasses of champagne in her hand.  She was followed by Laars, who left a dusting of shimmering powder on Draco's shoulder.
“So how’re you, then?  No more blue hair?” Potter asked.  Draco felt Potter’s eyes roving over him.  Taking in the muggle slacks and form fitting high collared dress shirt with his sleeves buttoned to the wrist.  Draco resisted the urge to snap back that he wasn’t up to anything and Potter should bugger off. They were adults.  Potter wasn’t in uniform. Draco could be civil.
Jacinda looked up from her mobile with a puzzled expression on her face. “Question for you, who on earth uses newspapers?”
After reaching a satisfactory arrangement with Blaise, Draco returned to the Manor. To face a far less satisfactory arrangement.  He waited for the Ministry Officials to arrive with dread. Aunt Andromeda and his mother took the most illustrious of the Black Family heirlooms to the countryside in France. They did not list the items in the Assets his mother had sent to the solicitor.. Exuberant Ministry Officials seized many of the remaining Malfoy relics.
“I was livid and I asked her when she booked the movers but she wouldn’t look me in the eye.  Meanwhile I look like I’ve gone mad. And obviously this was going to be in The Prophet. Potter Gone Mental Over Failed Marriage. But in for a penny, in for a pound.  I asked one of the blokes shrinking my furniture when Ginny called them.”
Weasley stared at him in stony silence for a moment. “I know.” Weasley crossed his arms. “That’s one of the many differences between us, Malfoy. I would never abuse my position.”
Harry warred with himself for a moment. He wanted what was best for everyone. But it couldn’t be at the expense of losing himself. He’d already died for them once. Wasn’t that enough? It was time for him to live for his own sake.
“She’d already found a flat.  We’re in the middle of a row about this and the movers arrived. Movers!  They started magicking half the shit in our flat into boxes. Ginny had gone round and marked what she’s taking with bloody stickers!”
“Not necessarily. There are quite a few options included. I’ve organised them from most to least time-consuming.”
Eventually, he ran out of booze and crisps, which meant he ran out of writing power. He heard Hermione and Ron calling for him from the sitting room. He shrugged on a dressing gown over his jogging bottoms.
Once they were in the kitchen he began taking down mugs from the top shelf and handing them to Hermione while the kettle heated up.
“When you get to Azkaban, they’ll activate the dampener to replace the tracer I put on you.  They won’t give you any trouble.”
“I have to say, Harry, I’m disappointed in you.” Shacklebolt said. The Minister for Magic sat beside Harry’s direct supervisor, Head Auror Laghari. “I thought we could count on you.”
“That’s ingenious,” Hermione said. “I would never have thought of that. I followed the recipe in my cookbook to the letter.” She paused thoughtfully.
“Merlin.”  Draco shook his head.  He nudged Pansy to move over and grabbed a cutting block. “How can it possibly know if you’re muggle on a mobile phone?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “An orphan who also happens to be the most famous wizard of all time. And a fully grown adult.”
Hermione and Harry both turned to the NotPassedOut Ron Weasley, who shrugged. “He ws misr… misrble.”
Potter kept in step with Draco and they moved to another corner of the shop. “And I’m not following you.”
“Well, I wouldn’t have to if you would stop a moment and talk to me.” Potter looked around them, confused. “Why are we in the jumper section?”
“Really, Molly,” Hermione chimed in. “You’ve outdone yourself. What did you put in them?” She eyed the spoonful of mash carefully. “Are those scallions?”
“Er, no,” Harry said and shot a glance at Malfoy. “Cedric… wasn’t my boyfriend. We didn’t-” Harry’s mind went briefly blank. What was happening? How did Harry end up here? Having this conversation with Dudley Dursley and Draco Malfoy. He scratched the back of his neck. “We didn’t date or anything.”
“You’re not helping your case there, love.” She put her blond hair up in a bun and Draco could see the dark brown roots. She noticed his obvious discomfort. “Come in for a cuppa.”
Harry nodded. And the reality of the situation came flooding back to him. He’d just had yet another meltdown. This time in front of Draco Sodding Malfoy.
Draco hated this. What happened to cunning and cut throat Slytherins? Sure it was a stereotype, but he could really do with some callus backstabbing instead of this concerned friend nonsense.
The Ministry of Magic amerced much of the Malfoy funds. Despite this, Draco still had enough to get by without having to join the workforce. His mother had been wise enough to keep his trust in the Black family name.
Once they disappeared down the hall, Hermione collapsed on the sofa beside Harry. She leaned her head on the arm of the sofa and curled up on her side. Harry followed suit on the other end of the sofa.
“I haven’t tried one yet, but they smell delicious. Franc was just taking them out of the oven when I clocked in. I’ve had my eye on them all morning.”
Harry wasn’t sure where the words had come from, but when they popped out he was equally surprised to find Malfoy had accepted his invitation.  Here they were having coffee together. Like old friends. Not like bitter enemies who’d once tried to kill each other. It was... Odd.
“How dare you trivialise the war and the people we lost, THE SACRIFICES THEY MADE.” He stood up swiftly, knocking his chair back. “And how dare you try to manipulate me!” He turned his rage on Shacklebolt. “If you want the ministry to be appreciated by the public, MAKE DECISIONS THAT BENEFIT THEM!”
“I have to admit, she is formidable.  The Harpies would be nowhere without her.” Malfoy conceded. “That last match against the Cannons was brutal.”
“Harry!” Ron bellowed at him. Harry tried to ignore the awed silence that came over the pub as he made his way to the corner. The Aurors in the corner more than made up for the silence of the other patrons. They were not so much awed as pissed.
It was an adorable smirk. Draco hated it.  “I resent your tone, Potter.  Hurry up and pick something.”
“That is incredible.”  Harry licked his lips. “I mean, it’s not technically illegal, what you’re doing.  But it’s definitely dubious.”
“What would calling 999 do?” Draco asked, not understanding what on earth that collection of words could possibly mean.
If Ron thought a quidditch game would cheer Harry up he was dead wrong.  They didn’t have top box seats, thank Christ. Ron wanted to, now that he could afford them, but Harry didn’t want Lee Jordan pointing him out again.  He didn’t have enough energy to put on a cheery face and pretend he was having the time of his life. Particularly when his life was yet again falling apart.
Most of a bottle remained on the drinks trolley behind the sofa. Harry added to his tea. He kept expecting Mad Eye Moody to pop in through the flames. Or hear Sirius singing some muggle tune upstairs. Or Fred and George tossing him an extendable ear. Harry drank his way through his tea whisky combination and wondered what life had been like if he’d got to live with Sirius rather than the Dursleys. Ten-year-old Harry would kill for a chance to get out of his cupboard, let alone experience an entire house to himself. Twenty-seven-year-old Harry wasn’t sure which he hated more.
Draco held his wand tip to the board and white chalk modern calligraphy poured out forming "Cheery Cherry: a drink to lift your spirits."
Harry shrugged.  “The whole time we were together I knew it would end.  Everything always ends. I knew she’d leave me. Everyone I love leaves me at some point.”
It took a week before he worked up the courage to actually speak to her. Seven straight days of ordering coffee and mediocre pastries and hanging about in a cafe. He could have tried other places, he supposed. But he’d found this one. In that time, he’d learned that the woman he’s spoken with that day was called Oliva. There was also Kabir and Grace who worked the register. The pastries varied in quality day by day. From Olivia, he’d learned that on the better days, it was Agatha in the kitchen. The more dreadful pastries happened when Franc was in the kitchens. He’d also learned muggles loved mobiles. He wasn’t entirely sure what they did, but muggles were never without them.
“At least it’s not shit,” Ron said. He pulled the shirt off over his head as he walked to the bedroom.
Malfoy looked as though he would vomit for half a moment before he blinked himself into composure.  “The one with the Ministry tracer?” he asked faintly.
Harry appearated to the steps of 823 Dewey Lane. Hermione opened the door, Rosie in her arms. She took one look at him and called out for Ron. Ron came sprinting out from the nursery, with sick on his shoulder.
“But I never lost Arthur.” Molly said, her voice thick.  “Over fifty years we’ve been married, bless him.”
Draco ignored the barely hushed voices and made his way to the counter of Slug & Jiggers. He set the bundle of porcupine quills and the jar of dragon liver down. The shopkeeper put them on the scales to weigh them out. His eyes strayed to Draco’s wrist, where his robes had ridden up a bit. Draco hastily tugged the sleeve back down.
All the produce was covered in plastic. It was mental. He had to purchase potatoes that came in a plastic bag and then put that plastic bag in another plastic bag. Broccoli was covered in plastic that looked like it was moulded on. What kind of nonsense was that? Despite the absurdity of the packaging, Draco still found himself enjoying the shopping process a little. Particularly getting to use his ballpoint pen. He crossed potatoes off the list, gave the pen a satisfying click and tucked it back in the jacket pocket of this three-piece suit.
There was nothing for it: he’d have to get a flat. And he wasn’t sure that anyone in Wizarding London would let to him. Draco sighed. Muggle London it was.
The crowd erupted in cheers, the Top Box being no exception.  Harry glanced at Malfoy again. He was picking at black nail varnish.  He had painted his nails black. He had blue hair. He was wearing muggle clothing.  Who was this? How could it possibly be Malfoy?
“What of it?”  Malfoy’s posture changed.  He sat up straight. The sneer was back in his voice.  Harry didn’t remember it leaving but he was sorry it was back.
Draco thought back to his summers as a child hiding in the kitchens watching the house-elves create elaborate tea times with all his mother’s favourite French patisserie. He demanded to know how it was done and would spend as much time as he could get away with baking with them. Once his father caught him that all ended. Instead, he spent his summers being lectured about working beneath his station. And what the Malfoy name truly meant.
Harry scrambled off the bar stool to follow. He caught up to Malfoy at a corner booth occupied by two muggle girls.
“Oh, that’s-  Oh..” Malfoy whispered, his voice husky and soft.   He licked his lips and bit down on the bottom lip.  "Unnngggh." he moaned.
“Do not, for a moment think that because you do not see my emotions that I do not experience them.  I have a world of experience hiding them, Potter.  My life depended on it.  So you’ll forgive me if I don’t run about shouting every feeling I possess every moment of the day.”
There it was.  The heart of the matter.  “You’ve come to your senses and decided not to chase married men?” he asked.
Draco continued to ignore her and consequently got on the wrong tuba line. He knew he was meant to be on the Central line, but somehow ended up on the Piccadilly line. Then he didn’t know when to get off and found himself at the end of the line at a place called Cockfosters, which Draco refused to believe was its actual name. Someone was fucking with him. Some wizard or witch had recognised him on the tuba and transfigured the station name, just to throw him off. It was the only logical explanation. He waited until the platform cleared of Muggles (not that there were very many to begin with) and appearated back to Blaise’s flat.
“While you were having a mental breakdown and stared at the pavement for ten solid minutes.”  Draco inspected Harry.  “Can you pull yourself together?”
Draco allowed himself to get positively pissed. He dug through Blaise’s wine collection until he found a lovely, inexpensive bottle of port. The Dow’s vintage 1977 would do nicely. It was delicious with a delicate aftertaste. As though each sip was a drop of ambrosia doing a ballet on his tongue. He could think of no better way to spend a night alone. Well. Almost no better way. He briefly considered venturing out into the night to find someone to spend it with. Maybe someone with dark hair. And bright eyes. But Draco wasn’t quite drunk enough for those thoughts yet.
“Ah, well. That’s something, then.” He smiled at her and grabbed the bags of boxes of pastries off the counter. “Cheers!”
The server arrived then and delivered the Danish and coffee to Blaise. More batting of the eyes, ogling of the cleavage, and all around undressing with the eyes was to be had. Draco very much regretted asking to meet Blaise in a public place. It had been so long since he’d been out with his mates he’d forgotten how lascivious Blaise could be. It was almost as repulsive as going out with Pansy. He’d gone out with her once, and never again. Draco had no interest in watching her drape herself desperately over any lad looking her way in some sort of misguided attempt to make Draco jealous. At least Blaise was still clothed. Either way, his friends seemed to lack any inhibitions of their libidos. Draco, struggled to even feign an interest in finding a partner. It seemed disingenuous to attempt to meet someone, even if only for a night. Not in the Wizarding World, anyway.
“Yeah.” George stubbed the end of his cigarette out and vanished it with a wave of his wand. “It was just..”
“Do deculare”  Harry hooked his thumbs through the belt loops on his jeans and stuck out his elbows. “That ya ought t' see a movie with me tonaahyt.”
“Do try to calm down, Harry.” Shacklebolt said, resigned and exhausted in the face of Harry’s rage. “We’re on the same side here. We all want what’s best for everyone.”
Lovegood and Granger were now laughing. Draco shook his head. He tapped his wand against the board once more.  He turned to face the room and found a sea of confused faces.
Harry blinked a few times.  “That’s bollocks. We can be mates.  We’re both seeing people, there’s nothing romantic involved.  We're not even trying to kill each other anymore.”
Pansy drew herself up and looked down her nose at Davies in a spot on impression of Draco.  “That’s because I have impeccable taste.” she said in his drawl.  Draco narrowed his eyes at her.
“So, how are the Aurors treating you these days, Harry?” Bill asked, tucking a few loose strands of hair behind his year.
“If you don’t want to help me, the least you can do is bugger off,” he said. He turned and found his way out of the clothing and back to the food items part of the store. When he located the bread, he turned to find Potter still behind him.
Draco’s mouth thinned to a line, as he tried to tamp down on his frustration.  He shook his head and pointed at the image again.
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Just because they were muggles didn’t mean he had the right to use magic against them. Yes, he could solve this problem immediately. But it wasn’t his place. They were people just like him. Draco thought back to all the times Aunt Bellatrix had imperioused him. A shiver went down his spine. He could resolve the situation without magic. Somehow.
“Master Harry is letting Kreacher comfort the Mistress. Kreacher shows Mistress Black how Master Harry is-”
Draco shook himself and turned to the owner of the voice. A girl around his age in a jumper with a cat on it.
Eventually, his head began to hurt. He needed a coffee. Which required getting out of bed. Yet another thing Draco absolutely loathed. If he waited until eight, Olivia would make tea. Tea had caffeine which was supposed to get rid of his headache. The problem was, the last few weeks tea hadn’t been doing its job. Draco hated tea. If stupid tea could just give him enough caffeine, the first go round. Now he needed at least two, if not three, mugs of tea. Olivia bought him a coffee maker last week because of his rant about tea caffeinating deficiencies. Draco hated the coffee maker. Because he hated coffee, definitely not because he couldn’t figure out how to use it. Being awake was stupid and Draco hated that too. Draco rolled onto his side, his back to the window.
After a time, Harry sought the records Sirius loved. He suspected electronics wouldn’t work here any more than they did at Hogwarts. Thus, he wasn’t surprised when he stumbled upon a hand crank gramophone. He grinned half-heartedly and sorted through the records in the trunk beside it. Harry swapped them out after a few minutes because most were angry. He discovered one, though, that fit his mood. Harry lay on Sirius’s bed and let the words wash over him.
Thankfully they were interrupted by a booming voice permeating the air, “WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO FAWLEY STADIUM.  LINEUPS WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN TWENTY MINUTES.”
A few wizards and witches gathered around behind Creevy. Draco’s gaze swept over them, looking for someone that might step in, but his heart sank when he recognised most of them as the tutting patrons of Slug & Jiggers. Some of whom looked eager to get in on the action. He was entirely surrounded, but even so Draco didn’t reach for his wand.
Harry didn’t reply but he didn’t think it was that odd, not the bit about paying parents.  That was just weird. But an only child growing up on such a large estate was bound to be a bit lonely.  Mind you Harry would have swapped his cupboard and tormentors for an estate and paid mates any time.  He bit back another smile.
There was a small waiting room looking over the ocean where they sat on a bench.  Harry watched Malfoy’s reflection in the window. He’d changed since Hogwarts, since his trial even.  The pale blonde hair looked healthier than Harry had seen it in years. His fine features made a cutting profile. Somehow Malfoy had grown up when Harry hadn’t been paying attention.  He found himself oddly captivated.
Hearing the words out loud was unexpected. He’d always suspected they were using him for his clout. But to hear it acknowledged brought his rage in full force.
Harry took advantage of Draco’s open mouth to deepen the kiss.  It was Draco’s heart flying through the air.  It was a thousand stolen glances.  It was Draco’s hands slipping under Harry’s shirt and the groan Potter let out.  It was their tongues dancing instead of dueling.   It was Draco nipping Harry’s lip and him losing control.  Hands in hair.  Biting teeth and sliding tongues.  It was too much clothing and not enough skin.  It was every fantasy Draco had since he was fifteen.
“And you’re certain they’ve all...   Enjoyed themselves?” he lowered his voice to a goading whisper, “because no one would ever fake it with you, the Great Harry Potter, would they?”
Two hours later, Harry’s arse was sore from sitting at a desk for so long. He’d written about fifteen pages worth of note, with a few crap illustrations drawn while idly searching for words. He stretched, his back aching. Christ, how did Hermione do this all day?
Draco had been particularly thrilled when he discovered “beanies.”  They were Draco’s favourite accessory. Nine months out of the year Draco wore a beanie.  Only in the sweltering heat of London in the summer did he go without one. His favourite was black and a bit too large so that it slouched at the back of his neck. The most exciting part of wearing muggle clothes was wearing them in Diagon Alley.  With his hair covered by a beanie and his mark covered with muggle floral tattoos, Draco wasn’t immediately recognized as a Malfoy. A Death Eater. He wasn’t spat at or hexed. It was rather lovely.
It filled Harry with guilt. They had so much to worry about with their baby and their jobs; he didn’t want to burden them further.
Harry flinched at the noise. It took him a half a second to realise the shouting was joy and excitement. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and let the terror drain out of him. Voldemort was dead. He was not at Hogwarts. No walls were crumbling around him, nor spells flying overhead. This shouting was joyous, not filled with horror. Harry took another breath and opened his eyes. He glanced around the table, relieved to see that no one appeared to have noticed his small mental breakdown. The focus was still on Mrs Weasley and Hermione, who had stood up and were talking excitedly.
Hermione came running down the stairwell with an armful of parchment rolls, quills, and ink, only to find the dining room mostly vacated. She looked at Harry, a question on her face.
“A knife?” Draco shook his head.  Muggleborns. He slid his wand out from his pocket.  He tapped the pomegranate and it split in half. He conjured a bowl and flicked his wand.  The pomegranate seeds flew in a perfect arch into the bowl. A knife indeed.
He followed Harry’s sight line and found none other than Neville Longbottom arm in arm with Ginerva Weasley.  She was pregnant.
Draco’s heart sped up.  Why had Harry picked this song? Was he reading too much into things again?  Draco had to stop himself from over analyzing.  It wasn’t hard to put those thoughts aside.  Not with Harry Sodding Potter making a fool of himself in a muggle shop, doing his best to make Draco laugh.
Once everything on the patron side of Mood was set, Draco unlocked the door and flipped the switch for the Open sign in the window.  Pansy adjusted her cleavage in one of the mirrors on the wall. Draco tutted and went behind the bar. She joined him soon after and they finished mixing up their mixers.
Olivia correctly interpreted his reaction. Damn her. She bit her bottom lip to keep from laughing. After a deep breath she said, “Draco, you know I love you.”
The crowd erupted in cheers, the loudest coming from the group surrounding Draco.  The screen showed those in the Top Box and Draco began to panic. He slid down in his seat as the picture of the Top Box zoomed in closer and much to Draco’s dismay the black shaggy head in front of him was not a Bulgarian, but in fact Harry Sodding Potter.  Because of course it was.
Pansy squeezed his wrist (the right one) and delivered the drinks.  The night picked up fairly quickly, as Fridays usually did. By the time Lou came in Draco was ready for a break.  He went through the back of the bar to his potions room. He drew the curtain aside, the muggle repellent wards along the doors sent a cool chill down his spine as he crossed the threshold.  The room held only two cauldrons, and as such he only served two specialty “Mood” drinks a night. They were built into the wall, adjacent to each other leaving the wall to the right of the door as his workspace.
The crisp packet began to warm in Harry’s hand signalling the two minute warning.  He looked to Malfoy and they stood facing each other.
Dudley gestured vaguely with his hand. “You know,” he leaned in and gave Harry a significant look as though this explained everything.
Malfoy tutted beside him and folded his arms across his chest.  Harry continued to watch him in the window reflection, unable to look away.  The light was dimming and the horizon was slashed with deep oranges and reds.  On top of which Malfoy’s reflection hung, spectral and beautiful. Harry sighed again.
Too right, he had.  But Harry liked to think Draco wasn’t that person anymore.  “I dunno what to say, mate. That’s not who he is anymore. And the whole being mobbed bit, he gets it.  He didn’t have a choice in how he was raised any more than I did.  We were both a bit, I don't want to say brainwashed, but yeah.  Brainwashed.  Afraid of the future, afraid of letting people down.  We did what we had to.  He doesn't believe in any of that pure blood shite.  Not anymore.”
He spent the rest of the night listening to the drunken version of how they caught Rookwood. Desperately trying to ignore the hollow pit that opened up in his stomach. He should be happy for Ron; this was a monumental case for them. Christ knows Ron deserved it. The last of the Death Eaters finally in Azkaban. Fuck. Harry downed his pint. He should have been with them. Not at some fucking publicity stunt. It was a struggle to limit himself to one pint.
“That is fantastic!  It’s an at home projector.  You can watch a film on a wall.” Harry said, delighted and successfully distracted.
Creevy took a deep, shuddering breath. The wand at Draco’s neck shook slightly as Creevy lowered it.
The wave had begun near them in the stadium.  Harry and Ron stood to raise their arms along with the crowd and sat back down.  Harry slouched in his seat.
Harry snorted. “You’ll get used to it. I thought she’d never get over me and Ginny, but here we are.” At Ginny’s engagement party, Harry wanted to add. “What happened, anyway?”
“She was just going through the motions because I’m Harry Potter. And who wouldn’t want to marry Harry Sodding Potter, you know?”
Harry didn’t see why not. He shrugged and gestured that they follow him up the stairs. Ron eyed the clothes that were scattered on the floor of his bedroom.
Jacinda and Olivia sat in the middle of the curved booth, which put Harry and Malfoy at opposite ends, sitting across from each other.
Did they really need this conversation in the middle of a muggle supermarket? And why wasn’t Potter trying to hex him? “I shouldn’t have said that.”
It was Potter stopping, both of them somehow shirtless, panting.  Their cheeks flushed and lips swollen.  Harry hovered above Draco, briefly hesitant.
Harry ignored him and began scrolling through the songs on the karaoke machine. Overjoyed with his selection, he grabbed Draco’s arm again pulling him in close so they could both see the screen.  “Come on, you know this one!”
Draco gripped his wand, hidden from Olivia’s sight. His hand twitched. It was perfectly logical. He could immobilise the crazed chef with a flick of his wand. He could scourfingy the kitchen sink. Put a stasis charm on the pastries beginning to smoke in one of the ovens. And then obliviate the lot of the muggles. It would take him five minutes. This whole ridiculous situation would be resolved.
What would happen if he and Malfoy weren't enemies? What if Harry had shaken his hand that day on the train? What if he invited Malfoy to sit with him and Ron? Would he have? Was there any world where Ron and Malfoy could have been mates?
“Alright?” Potter said.  Thank Merlin he didn’t try to shake his hand. Draco nodded in greeting, not looking Potter in the eye.  He tugged the beanie down a bit.
Harry leaned his head on Draco’s.  “If you could get back together, would you?  Would you take him back right now?”
“Sing?  You expect me to sing?  Have you mistaken me for some other Draco Malfoy without a sense of propriety?”
Draco’s hesitation seemed to melt off his shoulders.  He glanced at Harry quickly. “It is rather, isn’t it?”
Harry watched Draco’s face grow apoplectic out of the corner of his eye. His two childhood tormentors in one place. How could Harry have ever thought this would be in any way beneficial for him? Of course it wasn’t. It was a horror from start to finish.
“Alright.  I’ve a port key”  He drew a bottle cap from his pocket and flipped it in the air. “We’ve got about five minutes.”
Looking at him Draco felt as though he had finally been shown what life was and his chest ached.  For all the lost time they could have spent fooling about instead of out for blood.  Life wasn’t heavy expectations from parents.  It wasn’t impossible tasks assigned to him by madmen.  It wasn’t desperation.  It was this.  Harry Potter standing on a designer trunk and jumping down to land on his knees, head thrown back yelling at the top of his lungs “Destiny is killing me!  Open up your eager eyes!”
“Sorry!” He said, as he scrambled to help her scoop them back up without dropping the box of pastries. She looked up at him, a bit lost. “Looking for the other knitting ladies?”
This party went far better.  Ron and Hermione’s new house was perfect: the epitome of an English cottage, complete with a cow named Lady.  Hermione lit the back garden with jars of the little blue flames she used to conjure at Hogwarts.  It was enchanting and nostalgic. Molly took Rosie for the evening so Ron and Hermione could have some grown up fun for the New Year.
“That’ll be five Galleons.” The shopkeeper glared at Draco and slid the parchment across the counter.
“Malfoy?” Her face was white as a sheet. Her eyes flicked to his bare forearm, taking in the new floral addition to his tattoo.
“Hiya.” Ginerva Weasley said.  She glanced between Draco and Harry.  Draco can feel the mild judgement at his presence radiating off her.  “How are you, Harry?”
“Are you thick? I’m shopping. You’re following me around, watching me put items into my shopping trolley. How do you not understand what is happening?”
Harry debated heading home after.  He had a sore back and was in dire need of a drink.  He wasn’t quite ready for the quiet of Grimmauld Place after the afternoon spent playing quidditch at The Burrow.  Ron, Hermione, and Rosie were knackered when they left. Rosie from being a toddler stuffed with cake. Hermione from being the parent on duty and Ron from getting his arse handed to him in quidditch by his seven year old niece.  Harry felt some residual adrenaline running through his veins in need of an outlet. Harry checked his watch. Draco would be at his pub for another hour.
“It’s just that I’ve colour coordinated your event schedule with their corresponding press releases and it might be beneficial if we could just-”
Malfoy caught his eye for a brief, unreadable moment and quickly darted away. His gaze slid over to Olivia and said ruefully, “I was a twat at school, is what he is politely implying.”
Draco wasn’t quite sure if he believed them, but he had more pressing matters to attend to. Such has his current state of undress. He glanced around for his shirt, but didn’t see it nearby.
As if that clarified anything at all. Sure, he’s heard the words before. He just didn’t have any context for them. She may as well have said “muggle place, like the muggle word.”
There was a long, heavy pause. The bumping base from the club blended into the background noise of inebriated arseholes and city traffic.
“Fuck, mate.  No wonder you weren’t at dinner Sunday.   Ginny didn’t say anything. I mean she looked a bit off colour, but honestly I thought she was knackered from quidditch practice.  I had no idea.”
“Fuck.”  Harry ran his hands up through his hair and sat on the steps.  He sighed heavily.  “Shit.  I’m sorry.”
Did Malfoy feel as trapped as Sirius had? Surely not at the beginning. But after sixth year, Harry knew Malfoy was miserable. Everyone was miserable by that time. Forced to deal with shit beyond what was should be expected of teenagers.
It was disgusting watching them haul away the Malfoy library in particular. They didn’t even have the forethought to pack the books into properly sectioned trunks. They waved their grubby wands and paid no heed to what went where. If the Ministry Officials were stupid enough to put
“Too much?” She looked about to say more but something in the reflection caught her eye.  Draco gave her a questioning look. She indicated something with her head. Draco’s eyebrows knitted.  He looked around them at the table of books.
“Oh, sod off you crazy old bint.” Harry yanked the curtains closed. “Kreacher?” Harry shouted. “Why did you let the old bat out again?”
“Nks” he muttered. He blinked a few more times before putting them on. Eyes finally adjusted to the light, Harry could fully take in the imposing presence of his best mate, the renown Auror. Ron crossed his arms and chewed his bottom lip. Harry followed Ron’s gaze to the half empty bottle of whisky and tipped over the mug on the floor beside the bed.
“Wizarding flats are hard to come by in muggle London, you know.”  Malfoy smirked at Harry, “though maybe not for you Potter.”
Harry shifted both his bags to one hand and grabbed her knitting tote with the other. He guided her over to the waiting group of ladies. Harry endured another round of what a nice young man he was. He turned down a few offers of tea and one offer to meet a single granddaughter. Harry checked his watch. Hermione was going to kill him for sure.
“It’s a nice place.” Harry spun around in the air, it felt great to feel the wind against his face.  He felt alive and free in a way that was becoming, sadly, less frequent.
Blaise brought him the cutting board with the venomous flowers. Draco dropped three at a time into the cauldron at thirty-second intervals. During which, Blaise suspiciously said nothing. Draco set the cutting board down and turned to face his friend.
Saturday morning, Harry woke up slumped over in the armchair. It must have been early morning, but it was hard to tell for sure. He stretched and rubbed his aching neck. He’s got to stop doing that. Harry grabbed the empty glass beside him and set it on his drinks trolley.  After he shuffled over to the walk-in closet, he dug around the pile of clothes on the floor until he found his pyjama bottoms and a probably clean-ish t-shirt. He swapped out his Auror robes for the comfy, not too musty sleep clothes and then firmly collapsed on the bed. The real question was how long Harry could lie there until his headache outgrew his apathy. He should really go over his schedule before Monday. Instead, he wallowed deeper into his blankets and stared out at the rain.
“Draco you’re thirty two.  It’s a bit soon to write yourself off as a confirmed bachelor." Harry chuckled softly. "Besides I was married and a fat lot of good it did me.”
“And if I am?” he sneered. “At least I know how to laminate pastry. Have you ever been to a real patisserie? Clearly not, or you’d know what puff pastry is supposed to look like.
“The difference is how uncouth it is to spit food into a bin.  I think you’re right, we could never be friends. I do have standards, after all.”
Harry watched Malfoy slide out of the booth and weave his way back toward the bar. Harry kept his gaze away from Malfoy’s denim clad arse. Denim and Malfoy were two words that simply do not belong in a sentence together. What would Lucius Malfoy have to say about his son in Muggle attire? Not that he would know, in Azkaban, for life. Harry vaguely remembered seeing in the Prophet that Narcissa retired to France. Mostly likely his parents hadn’t the foggiest.
Kingsley glanced at her, “That’s right.  Roberta.” he turned in his seat to face her directly.  “But I couldn’t look away from you. I can’t remember what I said precisely.”
Harry begrudgingly accepted the file, his heart sinking. It was thicker than last month’s. Which was thicker than the month before. Or maybe they were all the same and their perceived size seemed to increase in time with his trepidation. Or maybe Harry was losing it. “How many of these bloody events are there?”
He tried again the next evening, again venturing out in muggle clothing. He made it to the cafe where he had a minor breakdown last time. Now, instead of stalling in the window front like a nutter, he made it through the doors.
“Nah. If anyone asks where she is, I can just pretend I didn’t hear them.” George said. He didn’t quite manage a smile. George packed the box of cigarettes a few times. He slid a second one out and twirled it about on his fingers a few times before sliding it back in the box. He inclined his head towards The Burrow, “Reckon we should head back in?”
Harry couldn’t meet Bill’s eyes. He didn’t need more pity. Or concern. Or whatever might show on Bill’s face. He absently tried to tear the last of his roll, but found it gone. He scratched the scruff on his chin.
Harry slept in the next day, too. He woke around one in the afternoon and wrote a few pages of notes. Made a few doodles. Had a few drinks. A packet of crisps. Went back to bed. It was a rather dreary fall, which meant the sun wasn’t seen much in London during the day, anyway. Hours were hard to track. He wasn’t entirely sure how much time passed in this manner.
Andrew reached his arm around Harry’s waist and leaned in to whisper in his ear “I might just pop off to use the loo.” He pecked Harry on the cheek.
The bludger came back around, this time at Harry.  He zig-zagged through the air, losing it around a bit of thicket.
Harry and Ron grinned at each other. Hermione passed Rosie over to Ron, who bounced her on his knee. She made delighted gurgling noises at him and tried to eat Ron’s wedding ring. Hermione disappeared down the hall. She returned a moment later with a roll of parchment.
Draco accepted the bowl of lemons Pansy brought from the back.  She was out in classic Pansy style, bright red lipstick, black fringe, crisp white pressed shirt, skin tight.  The top buttons undone enough to where Draco could see to top of her red brazier pushing out, same shade as her lipstick.  He rolled his eyes. He sliced lemons while she walked about the bar taking the bar stools off the tables, setting them nicely down around the clean floors with a swish of her wand. Draco forced himself to slice with a knife instead of his wand.  He’d gotten good at it during his Year of Magical Abstinence. Now he kept up the habit. Not all his employees were voluptuous witches. It was a good habit to keep.
“Go on, you’ve a bestselling cookbook to write.” he told her as he filled one side of the sink with hot soapy water.
“It’s a square!” Weasley shouted, jumping to his feet.  He pointed a long freckled arm at Draco. “Square!  It’s Squared away! Squared away”
Harry plucked his t-shirt and sniffed. He flicked a finger across the collar to cast a quick scourfingy and rid himself of cigarette smoke.
He sat down at his desk. He swept some of the crumpled up pages into the bin. He spun in his chair and handed the journal to Hermione. “Your memory’s probably better than mine.”
“I dunno.  I don’t think cheating is what ends marriages.  It’s more like a symptom of a bigger problem, mate.”
Potter handed him a self-inking quill.  Draco signed the parchment in mid-air and then Potter tapped it with his wand.  The parchment went slack again and rolled up into a scroll of its own accord. Potter snatched it out of the air and tapped it with his wand again.  A clump of purple wax appeared while a small ribbon tied the scroll in place. Draco saw the ministry seal form inside the purple wax. Potter tied it to the leg of an owl Draco hadn’t even noticed was there and sent it off.
“Yeah, but Margie is on her way. That’s the owner.” Olivia pulled out her mobile again and tapped on it some more. “Actually, she was in the country this weekend and is stuck on the M25. She may not get here for a bit longer.”
Harry laughed.  “I can’t remember, honestly.  It was nice though. I was expecting it to be well Posh but it wasn’t.  It was normal, friendly-like.”
Harry scanned down the list and stopped when he found Memoir. “You think I should write a memoir? Is that wise?”
He wondered vaguely if that had been Malfoy he spotted today. It was a flash of blonde hair, exactly the right colour.  But Malfoy wouldn’t be in Muggle London.
“Fancy a cuppa?” Harry asked as he edged out of the room to give them some space. He couldn’t make out her words, but heard the amusement in her voice. He put the kettle on in the kitchen, snagged a few mugs and busied about with the tea. Hermione came and found him after a few minutes. “Thanks, Harry. I’m going to check on Rosie. I’ll be back in a moment.”
Malfoy rounded on Harry, indignant.  “Firstly I don’t see how that’s any business of yours, Auror Potter.  Second, we hardly know each other. We’ve been dating a month. I don’t want to marry anyone I’ve known for a month. Which is, I repeat, none of your business.”
He watched the traffic move through the cafe and thought, as he often did, of Potter. Draco made it through the trials in a haze. He had a hard time telling if the despair, humiliation, or relief were stronger. Most of the time, he felt numb. The families with loved ones who died at Hogwarts were the worst of it. They sat there in the front. Witnesses to his list of atrocities. Draco couldn’t look at them, he felt sick. He brought this on them. He alone let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Every single person who died did so because of him. The Dark Lord had been trying to get to Hogwarts for fifty years and it was Draco who finally helped him succeed. He was sure he was going to Azkaban for life, alongside his father. But then Potter happened, as he always does. With his unyielding heroism and ridiculous hair. Going around sticking up for people who don’t want it and certainly don’t deserve it. Wasn’t it enough Potter had pulled him from the fire? Couldn’t he bugger off and let Draco rot away in prison like a normal person? But nothing about Potter was normal, was it? Course not.
“Hadn’t noticed.  Check it out, it’s got a trap where if you touch it in the wrong order your fingers get coated in purple ink.”
“Is that what that is?” Blaise peered suspiciously into Draco’s cup. “I’ll pass. Is the coffee any better?”
Harry shrugged. He let Hermione bring him in and take care of him. Only much later did he wonder how Malfoy had known where Ron and Hermione lived.
“It is, truly.”  Draco said, turning back to his chopping block.  “It might be awhile before you connect with someone again.  Maybe even longer before you sleep with them. I think that’s perfectly normal.”
“Yeah..” Dudley furtively looked around the pub and gave them another significant look. “You know.. Things.”
Pansy’s eyebrows arched, made all the more impressive by her perfectly rendered makeup.  “How long ago was that?” she asked.
“Still,”  Potter glared at the people in the station again. Then he waved his wand and said something under his breath that Draco couldn’t quite make out.  After that no one around them seemed to hear anything they said. They got a few curious looks but no significant interest. Potter squared his shoulders and finished reading from the parchment.
Harry indicated an empty table for Malfoy to sit at. The car was about three quarters full.  Harry grabbed them sandwiches and a couple of butterbeers and sat down across from Malfoy.
“Old?” Harry replied in mock outrage.  He grinned and summoned two more brooms from the shed. “Well that settles it.  The Olds versus The Kids. You’re on!”
“Draco?”  Ron dodged the bludger as he took off into the air after Harry.  “Seriously, mate. You call him Draco?”
“But Jean didn’t want those things. He still doesn’t want to get married.  Completely opposed to children.  He has no interest in connecting with his family. He may have had a good reason for that, but I can’t say for certain because he never spoke of them.  But that’s another matter. What I wanted had changed, what he wanted hadn’t. I said ‘It’s over then, isn’t it?’”
Harry nodded and trudged forward to knock on the door. Malfoy melted into the shadows. Hermione answered the door and took one look at him before bringing him into a warm embrace. “Oh, Harry, darling, you look a mess. What are you doing here?”
Draco straightened his jacket sleeve again.  “Oh I said we could be friends. But he wasn’t interested.  I was a criminal, you see. And he was an Auror.”
“It will only be a year without magic.” He tried to sound bracing.  Harry clapped him on the shoulder. “You’ll be fine.”
Harry nudged Draco with his shoulder.  He handed over one of the microphones, nodding encouragingly.  “Come one, the words pop up on the screen, right there.   You have to have heard this at some point in your life.”
Draco looked down where Potter’s finger had just touched him. He slowly brought his eyes to meet Potter’s and raised an eyebrow. “Yes, well, it didn’t take the first time, did it?”
.  I asked him if he ever met Gilderoy Lockheart, Andrew didn’t even know who he was.  Born after Lockheart went mad.”
Harry shrugged and Draco didn’t ask any follow up questions.  He did, however, run his fingers up and down the neck of the bottle slowly. Harry trailed Draco's fingers with his eyes.
They spent the rest of the evening watching the match in deliberate attention.  When Krum finally snagged the snitch, Bulgaria was ahead seventy to fifty three.   The Top Box went wild with cheering. Jean popped back to the box to apologize to Malfoy for having to stay longer.
They were both trying to contain their laughter now. A shadow fell over their faces and they looked up to find Franc looming over them, his eyes bugging out of his head.
Fuck. How had he missed that? Of course Dudley wasn’t asking about his well being. He was asking about something that mattered.
Olivia waved her hand, “Oh pish posh. She’ll just be glad we solved the problem. She’s been looking for a reason to get rid of Franc, besides. Can you really bake?”
The next day, Draco was tasked with doing the shopping. Tesco had been mentioned often enough in such a casual way that Draco never found the right moment to find out what the word meant. The one time he’d asked Olivia nearly fell to the floor laughing.
“I was wondering if perhaps I could take you to dinner or get a coffee. Anything.” His voice sounded weak and pathetic. Draco felt unwelcome tears well up in his eyes, unexpectedly. He blinked them back and looked down at his feet. He willed his abhorrent emotions away and met her gaze. “I understand if you don’t, of course.”
“I would believe you more if we hadn’t found you passed out on the floor clutching Gryffindor robes, mate.”
“I see you’ve found the drinks.” Hermione said, kissing Harry on the cheek.  Her face was flushed.  A few strands of curls were spilling out of the enormous bun atop her head.  She was wearing a lovely dress of deep blue that sparkled when it moved.  Her eyes trailed Harry up and down with approval.
“What are you lot talking of so seriously?” Malfoy arrived at the table with the next round. He slid them each a drink. Harry’s was a pint of lager.
“Anyway, it started out fine.  Normal Great Britain v America conversations.  Do you have Tesco? No, do we have Albertsons? Trivial stuff.  What exactly is marmite?”
Draco sneered, “Please spare me the lecture on alcohol content, Millie. I’ve been drinking port since I was fifteen.” He looked at them fully now. Both in their clothing from the night before, albeit a little worse for the wear. He gestured between them. “Did you just get in? Is this a thing now?”
“Nothing. Merely enjoying the beginnings of your mating ritual.” Draco replied, looking down his nose.
“Gotta gotta be damned because I want it all.”  Harry sang even louder.  He didn’t need the screen.  Instead he watched Draco’s hesitation.  Draco had the microphone in one hand and was glancing between Harry and the screen.
“Right.”  The intensity of Potter’s stare was overwhelming.  Draco felt as if he were an insect pinned to the wall for scrutiny.  “Sign here.”
Draco selected the best of the sweetgrass leaves and tied four of them into four little bows.  Then he placed them in the pewter cauldron. The potion turned a more brilliant shade of green with each bow.  He was just setting a tempus charm when Pansy came through the curtain as well. She perched herself on the edge of his small work table.
“Sod off.”  Harry said without any heat.  “Oh this is brilliant!” he grabbed Draco’s arm and dragged him over to a medium sized box.  Draco assumed it was medium sized.  Larger than the last item.  Not as big as a telly.  He supposed that must make it medium.
At some point he must have dozed off again because the next moment Kreacher’s voice woke him up at the door. “Master Harry?” he wheezed.
“No, you’re not a simpleton. You’ve just led a very sheltered life. Honestly, I don’t know how you got on before me.”
Dinner went by quickly.  Minimal awkwardness there, thank Christ.  Luc was weird.  Something about him threw Harry off kilter.  But he had to admit Draco looked happy, really happy.  It was nice to see him content, Harry thought.  He looked good in his casual muggle t-shirt beneath a lovely cardigan and tight fitting jeans. Harry could never tire of seeing Draco Malfoy in muggle clothing.  Every iteration of muggle clothing looked fit on him.
Harry supposed he never truly appreciated Mrs Weasley’s cooking, not before the Forest of Dean, anyway. Hermione looked to be of the same mind. Sometimes they caught each other’s eye during family dinners at The Burrow. Particularly when Mrs Weasley served something with mushrooms. A fond smile between them, which was always followed by mouthful after mouthful of delicious food. When he and Hermione had spent months on end accio-ing fish and gathering mushrooms, Harry used to dream longingly of dinners just like this one. Not to mention all the days Harry spent hoarding food at The Dursleys. He tried to ignore that as much as possible.
“See you later,” Jean kissed Malfoy on the cheek. Harry looked away quickly.  After his departure Malfoy adjusted his beanie, once again tucking the blue hair away.  When the crowds began to disperse Harry stayed in his seat. He liked to let the stadium thin out before trying to traverse the crowd.  Malfoy seemed to have the same idea. Despite Krum’s victory and an overall fantastic match Malfoy didn’t smile. He kept sighing and picking at his nail varnish.  They waited until Krum’s family left before they began descending the stairs.
“What? Course, yeah.” Harry looked away and scratched the back of his neck.  “Mind you, when we were in Flourish & Blotts the other day I found a copy of
“Fuck.” Draco said loudly into the microphone.  He hastily shut the machine off.  They were coming over to say hello.  Draco glanced at Harry.  He put a hand on his shoulder and gave a little shake.  Harry blinked rapidly a few times and got to his feet.
Harry shook his head.  “I’m not who I was at eleven.  And I’m certainly not who I was at eighteen.  Neither is she. I think she feels obligated to be with me, cause I’m well…”
“Don’t I know it.”  Potter said. “Come on, then.”  he indicated the vibrantly magenta car two down from where they stood.  The Aurors posted at the entrance nodded to Potter, who nodded back.
“Because that’s what you do when a couple gets engaged.  You bring an engagement gift.  You would know this if you weren’t such an uncivilized cretin.”
“It just sort of feels like we were two sides of the same coin, you know?” Harry went on.  He glanced over at Ron who was giving Harry an uncomfortably shrewd look.
Jean’s fingers were just skimming the skin between the hem of Draco’s t-shirt and the top of his jeans when they were interrupted.
Kreacher opened the door and brought in a trolley laden with enough food to feed the entire Weasley clan. “You didn’t have to bring it up, Kreacher.” Harry said, apologetically, “I was just about to head down to the kitchen.”
“Oh, no!  Now is exactly the right time."  Harry practically shouted.  He was on his feet again, "Because now is when it’s easy and fun.  You’re having a laugh with your friends and everything is light hearted and wonderful!”
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, “I never said there was anything romantic going on.  You’re the one who keeps trying to chat me up, telling me I’m fit.” he hissed. “Just what I’m meant to do with that information, Potter?”
“Stop, please waste no more of my time.” He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting his hand drop. He opened his eyes and looked directly at her, “I have a tuba to catch.”
“Right.” Harry sighed. “Sorry I asked.” He dropped his bag at the bottom of the stairwell. “Will Master Harry be needing dinner?”
Harry had always known Malfoy was an idiot.  He was only proving Harry right. “She absolutely wants to stay.  I mean look at them. Wouldn’t you rather stay with Humphrey Bogart than whoever that other tosser was?”
The stairwell had nearly cleared out.  They were alone standing entirely too close together.  Draco swallowed. Then he turned round and stormed off.  Harry stood still for a few moments, waiting for his mind to catch up with his body.  What on earth just happened?
“But why didn’t he want me?”  Draco sobbed.  “Will I never be free of who I was at sixteen?  Will I spend my life alone?”
Draco’s eyes darted around for the tall, limbering frame of Weasley. What if Potter and Weasley were both here with her? Draco’s pulse spiked. Was he going to run into Potter with his friends? Draco wasn’t sure he could suffer the humiliation, as well deserved as it was.
“You’re missing the point, Draco.” She began tapping away.  “Alright, I’ve set you up a profile. Let’s see who we can find.”
“And you know.. I’ll call if I need you for anything… Specific. Yeah?” Harry scratched the back of his neck. “McGonagall will look after you. She knows you’re coming. Got a place for you in the kitchens and everything.”
The club suddenly seemed too loud in Harry’s ears. Everything became unbearable. Darkness crept into the edges of Harry’s vision. The thudding bass seemed more like pounding cellar walls. The changing lights like flying hexes.
Draco’s instinct was to take the piss, but somehow Potter just looked too defeated.  Draco didn’t have it in him to kick the man already down. Especially after his own recent disillusionment with love.
Luna was named the New Year Queen apropos of nothing at all.  Everyone knelt around her in a circle while she warded off Nargles only she could detect.  Everyone joined arms and formed concentric circles around Luna, dancing around her and Draco among them.  Harry had never seen Draco's face so joyful.  It was the kind of evening where happiness mixed into a deep terrible sadness that Harry couldn’t explain. Something to do with the dancing and the drinking, never wanting the night to end but knowing it would.
It seemed like an awful lot of work for a simple cup of coffee. Draco boiled water in the electric kettle. While it boiled, he eyed the coffee maker again. By the time the water was ready, Draco had decided he did not just hate coffee. He loathed it. And coffee machines, specifically. Instead of continuing to fight with the useless contraption, he found a cheese cloth. He draped the cheesecloth over the mug and held it in place with his hand. He held it beneath the cutting board and scraped a pile of bean powder onto the cheesecloth gently. Then he poured the boiling water slowly over the bean powder. Satisfied with his work, he shook the cheesecloth over the bin until all the bean-powder was off.
