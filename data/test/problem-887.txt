Draco hesitated, and then asked, “Too far?”
“Yes.” He looked Harry up and down and saw how tense the man had become. “Do you want to?”
"Are you certain you want to do this?" Ron asked, wanting to make sure Harry was absolutely certain this was worth thirty Galleons.
"You do realize that insane people think they're sane? Therefore, your perspective is really just that of an insane person."
Harry blushed and crawled up the bed beside Draco. He spent the next seven minutes trembling in Draco’s arms before pouring into his hand. But to Draco’s dismay, Harry performed a cleaning charm before he could get a taste.
Harry’s face went dark red. “Don’t tease me.”
He stared at the door and watched Harry walk out, tears dried on his face and blotchy cheeks.
“I know, but you can’t live like that. You need to relax. You’ll end up miserable, even dead if you keep stressing yourself.”
Draco froze and his hands gripped Harry’s hips, his thighs trembled slightly and his head tossed back as his body shot up. His back was arched and his lips were parted as he basked in the glory of Harry’s form. “Oh fuck, you cunning little minx. You’re really going to do this to me?” He knew it wasn’t fair. He knew he would cum and Harry wouldn’t. But he could never resist Harry’s body. He gave in. “I’ll have whatever you’ll give me, love.”
“I haven’t tasted you yet.” He said it so casually, as if it was a perfectly normal thing to say.
With some help from Hagrid, who couldn’t have been prouder of their plot, they learned to melt gold and silver.
A comment like that couldn’t be ignored. Especially not in the wake of Harry’s political gains. Word spread that a secondary case against him in regards to potential child abuse was to be started, given that The Cupboard Project will likely be voted into existence next week. It was agreed that there really was no stopping the department from being made, and the Aurors took that as a good enough reason to start up a case.
He blushed, panting and looking Draco in his eyes as he felt the last of himself gushing out of the tip of his cock.
“None.”
Harry’s green eyes had become dark with lust, as deep and dark as a forest at midnight. Usually they were vibrant and soft like a Zinnia. It was an amazing contrast. He was sweating and panting. His wild hair was everywhere and he looked absolutely pitiful.
Of course Hermione and Ron stood by his side and supported him, helping him, talking to him, they became a sort of therapy group. They talked about the people they lost, how they felt, they cried together, mourned together, got angry and depressed together. But by the end of it, they felt better.
Harry tossed his head back and his lips parted in a sharp gasp as the pleasure hit him. His hands flew to grip Draco’s hips and he listened to the man above him whine in pleasure. His thighs trembled as he felt himself slowly be taken inside of the warm wetness of Draco.
Harry wrapped his arms around himself shyly, “I’m cold.” He mumbled. The switch from the warm shower to the cool room was cruel to his skin.
Draco made good on his promise to carry Harry’s books around when he was released from the hospital wing. But it didn’t do much good since Draco seemed tired. He was falling asleep in class and at meals.
Draco gave a lazy smile. “You really are going to kill me.”
“Of course I do, how could I not? Seamus, I think I’m in love with you.”
The blonde grinned, "You really should say that more often."
Draco got a few presents and a chocolate cake. He was immensely happy with how it turned out. To him, it was absolutely perfect. Harry had gotten him three more pairs of scrubs and a few medical supplies he could use in his career as a Healer. He had also gotten him some flower seeds, “for the garden I know you’ll want to grow.” It meant everything to him.
Harry had been clouded by his own determination and felt only his own passion, but when they began to take questions, he realized that he was afraid.
Harry crossed his arms and looked away with pink cheeks. Draco was right. But denial is the best medicine. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“No, no. It's alright.” He bit his lip before giving a small smile. “Mind if I call you Draco? It would only be fair.”
Draco felt his pride swell as the boy under him was incoherently crying out in a mix of two languages.
Harry looked up and grinned at the news. “I was thinking we tell Neville that you and Hannah were talking, and she happened to confided in you about her crush. I think Neville only needs a confidence boost.”
Harry chuckled and grinned up at Draco. “Good. Because I’m already sucking your dick, and I think it’d be easier for me to do it if we lived together.” He winked.
Soon.
“Bloody heathen.” Draco mumbled.
“Uh, A-Alex. Alex Wright.”
He sighed and sat down. “You can’t tell me you aren’t feeling something. People died.”
As they got closer, a young Hufflepuff hesitantly approached them. “Potter?”
They ended up sitting on the sofa together and he had a house elf bring them some tea. His calmed his mother down and they sat in silence. Neither of them wanted to talk about what had just happened.
Draco chuckled, “I really doubt anyone is thinking of going against you for DADA professor.”
"Yea." Harry agreed. "Remember when it was so complex and exciting? It used to be so much fun." His old plots of tearing apart careers and livelihoods were something to reminisce upon. For as terrible as it was, he enjoyed it. Without it, Wizengamot lost it's fun. That old spark was gone and now it was only something he was tolerating until he finished passing through his department and Pawk's bill. That was all it was to him now, something to wait out. To tolerate. If he had a new opponent, someone to break down in order to further himself, he might have fun again, but the only remaining opposition were so simple and dull. No one excited him anymore. Not to say he wanted to fight or be challenged, but part of him would miss it.
Draco understood and put on a sly smirk. "I can wait."
Harry had fallen victim to only one prank. He ended up with his chair stuck to his arse for three class period before finally sending an owl to Draco to come help him. The prank had been pulled four years ago and he still hasn’t lived it down.
Once at night and once in the morning when he woke up. He opened his eyes and knew he was rock hard before he even moved. He couldn’t help it. He felt a bit dirty to masturbate to the thought of his friend. But by the same token, it was two of the best orgasms of his life. So he didn’t care that much.
They went to Andromeda’s house and spent the morning with her and Teddy. After lunch they walked around Hogsmeade and saw that some of their younger friends were already shopping for their next year at Hogwarts. When they returned home, Draco locked himself in the kitchen to make dinner while Harry talked with the map. Spaghetti was the first thing Harry taught Draco to cook, so spaghetti is what Draco made tonight. It had silently become their favorite dish because of the memory of them flicking noodles at the wall to see if they would stick.
Draco paused a moment and looked Harry up and down once more. This time his eyes were glazed over with suspicion. “Only fairies can use glamour.” It wasn’t a type of magic that humans could use. But faes were naturals at it, they invented it.
“Come on Draco, we have class. If you can go the rest of the day without falling asleep, then I’ll let you use your magic tonight. If not then we’ll wait until tomorrow.”
Draco told her all about his plan to make Harry his, and she loved it, proud to see her friend back to his old Slytherin ways but for a good purpose. She knew exactly how she needed to play Harry in order to mould him into Draco’s plan.
Harry looked back up and he seemed afraid. For one brief moment, everyone saw a traumatized child. A child who was scared and didn’t want to talk about what happened. Maybe that’s all Harry really was. A child who was still afraid.
Draco nearly growled and he bucked his hips at the attention. His eyes rolled back and he moaned out his words. “Oh, Harry.”
Luna thought it would be best to keep encouraging Dean and Seamus and let them confess on their own. That ended up being the most supported idea.
“Neither have you.”
Alex looked at Harry with wide eyes, full of interest and excitement. “Of course.” They knew exactly what this was. Harry had an agenda he needed pushed, and therefore, needed an ally in the media. Given that it was Harry Potter, they didn't have any doubts about whether or not the stories would conflict with their morals; they also knew it would boost their career to pump out important news.
“Of course. Are you alright?” She responded coolly, but in the inside she was bubbling over with excitement.
Nobody raised their hand.
“Why are you covered in soot? What have you been up to, sweeping chimney’s?”
The blonde couldn’t help but to grin. “So are you the big or little spoon?” He thought it was quite adorable that Harry slept all curled up.
Harry quickly nodded, growing nervous about where the conversation was headed.
Pansy raised an eyebrow and casually mentioned that the potion was Amortentia.
He went out into the common room and found his friends all gathered together at their usual spot on the three couches.
“My grandmother, she ..... she was old-fashioned. Strict.” Neville said, but it was obvious he wasn't comfortable talking about his own experience.
“Mr. Potter?” The Head Warlock asked.
“Say my name again.” He smirked.
For lunch, they went to a little restaurant in wizarding Paris. While there, Draco was followed by a few journalists, snapping pictures and asking about him and Harry. One had the balls to ask Draco if he and Lucius’ plot to manipulate Harry was working. Draco couldn’t hold his tongue. In a French that was much more proper than usual, he said very simply that he and his father were estranged, and that he danced with Harry because he bloody wanted to.
“See you, Draco.”
He took a few deep breaths and felt a bit better. “Tell him about me. Tell him all about me. Tell him that he didn’t die for nothing. Tell them that I made sure none of them died for nothing. Tell them that next year, my peers are going to take the Ministry by storm! Tell them that they’re planning to make a series of laws in Remus’ honor that protect the rights of those afflicted with Lycanthropy. Tell him that no one like him can ever be denied a job because of that. Tell Sirius that they’re going to implement a form of child protective services so that no kid can ever be hurt again.” Lily’s journal briefly touched the subject of Sirius’ childhood. “Tell my father that I fought just like he did and that no one else will have to die. Tell him that there will be no more orphans of war. Tell my mother that her siste-“ He cut himself off. His throat closed up at the mention of Petunia.
“I didn’t poison it, you prick,” Harry blurted out and Malfoy let out an exasperated breath.
Then, he remembered faintly that Malfoy had spoken of being required to kill.
“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,” sighed Harry, “I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ll continue on next year.”
Defeated, Harry let out a huff before sinking down onto the frigid castle floor and reaching into his robes for the Marauder’s Map in one swift motion. He pulled out the still blank, folded piece of rectangular parchment. Pressing his wand so that the parchment wrinkled under his pressure, Harry muttered the familiar oath,
Ginny brushed through the throngs of people; she had a blazing look in her face as she cupped the back of his head on either side and pressed her lips to his. An unparalleled feeling surged through his body. A prickly tingle roared to life in his chest and throat and head and stomach, then nothing. Harry could only focus on the opened mouthed lips pressed against his and what they must have looked like to everyone crowding in around the two. It was as if he had passed a movie on the telly and the picture displayed on the screen was the moment the protagonist finally managed to convince his romantic interest to attend the prom with him. Though he wasn’t the protagonist, instead he was the viewer, all too distant from the event to possibly experience the entirety of the protagonist’s fulfillment. And only then did his cheeks flush a deep shade of red.
“Harry smiled softly and replied “Goodnight, Hermione.”
“You want to nip this pureblood ideology by ending it with this generation,” said Harry, only now beginning to accept Hermione’s reasoning.
“Just tell me you won’t use that back again,” she demanded.
“I’m having a difficult time even trying to fathom what you expect from me. Whatever it is Malfoy believes, that’s for him to grow from,” Harry started defensively, “What, am I supposed to speak with him? Malfoy loathes me. That git would rather listen to a singing toad than me! Wouldn’t having Dumbledore intervene be the best option?”
“Yes, sir.”
She didn’t nod but turned back to Malfoy’s frame and resumed her spellwork. After what felt to Harry like an eternity trapped within Azkaban, Hermione waved her wand one last time and clearly proclaimed,
know that! Given his position, now would be the time to, I don't know, deradicalize him!”
“Believe what you want, it doesn’t change why I’m here,” Harry shrugged and placed the plate of food carefully on Malfoy’s bedside table, “I just want to talk. Really.”
The pair walked in silence. Besides him, Hermione ruffled through her bag, pulling out several sheets of paper at once, she began flipping through them while muttering incoherently. Harry stared forward, watching the torches flicker and grow faint as they passed by. Occasionally, the inhabitants of one painting or another would watch as they passed, and others would jostle awake the good number of paintings snoring rather noticeably, then try to fall asleep themselves before the snorers resumed sleeping.
Snape looked offended by this and opened his mouth to voice this, but Dumbledore continued, oblivious of Snape’s displeasure. “Specifically, you shall accompany Miss Parkinson on her nightly patrols. Additionally, you are to attend Saturday detentions, which will be overseen by Professor Snape.”
Harry scoffed, “You think I want to help Malfoy?”
can defeat—"
“You’re sorry? Sorry for what?” shrieked Pansy, “Sorry for what you said? Or sorry for almost
From somewhere behind him, Zabini cleared his throat and said, “We have to talk.”
Harry took some comfort in that thought, enough to subdue his lingering guilt. And, so, there he stood, forced to observe Malfoy’s pathetic breathing.
“I—” Hermione began.
Just outside the Hospital Wing Pansy stood leaning her ear towards the opening where hushed voices could still be vaguely heard. Upon his approach, Pansy straightened herself instinctively, but in the space of a couple of seconds the expression in her eyes betrayed what she had been doing, and the half-hearted plan Harry had conducted to spy on Malfoy and Zabini’s conversation died right there. Instead, he continued down the corridor, ignoring the suspicious stare that followed him. Harry looked back once, and in the time it took him to reach the now crowded Great Hall, Pansy had disappeared into the Hospital Wing.
For a long second, rage utterly consumed Harry’s thoughts.
“You’re dismissed, Potter.”
The day after the Gryffindor’s celebration party that left the vast majority of the house groaning and mumbling at the rays of sunlight that managed to infiltrate their dorm room’s window curtains, was a groggy one to be sure. Whereas his peers could alleviate their suffering with knowledge of their victory, Harry’s day had seemingly been overshadowed with dodging every question Ron sent his way concerning he and Ginny’s relationship status. In fact, the questioning had grown so constant that Harry had taken up tracking Ron’s movements on the Marauder’s Map to avoid his friend. The questions themselves hadn’t been too terribly intrusive if you were to ask Harry; however, his lack of answer, alongside their maddening frequency, is what drove to his current hiding spot between two bookshelves in the library. It was the last place Ron would check for him, of that Harry was certain. All too preoccupied with the Weasley siblings, what he had failed to anticipate was Hermione, who had dropped into the seat beside him with a purposeful air about her and sat silently flipping through whatever book she was invested in these days.
At that Hermione relented her struggle with Harry and instead hurried her pace to match Harry’s jog. “What’s going on?” She asked in between laboured puffs of air.
Harry remained motionless for a long moment, then mustered a faint smile, “The truth it is, then,” another moment passed before he continued as if he were speaking to a rather temperamental child, “I—Er, I suppose, it’s that as much as we have our disagreements,” he stated, gesturing between them back-and-forth, “I don’t want to see you become one of those Death Eaters, Malfoy, and I don’t think you want to become one either.”
“You’re brilliant, Hermione!” Harry finally exclaimed.
Once again passing suits of armour that seemed to leer at the pair in the now dark corridors and portraits still sleeping undisturbed as they ascended the floors. When they finally entered through the portrait hole Harry spoke up, “Why do you care so strongly?”
“I do... And I’m sorry I ignored you before. Now let me finish!” said Hermione fiercely as she practically sprinted up the staircase which led to the Great Hall, “Malfoy’s been passive in his assassination attempts, and they’ve been feeble attempts at that. If he’s really taken the Dark Mark, it’s probably meant as a punishment for Lucius Malfoy. He’s a git, but he’d make an awful Death Eater.”
“I can’t possibly what? Hermione said nastily, “I can’t possibly know how you’ve used it to gain an undeserved reputation for brilliance. Or is it I can’t possibly know that you would’ve nearly killed someone! Because I clearly did, I told you that book was suspicious!”
“This is the copy of
“Enough!” Harry shouted and the glasses that had somehow managed to remain on his face began to creep annoyingly down his hid nose bridge.
“No, please, just listen to him,” Hermione heaved a deep sigh clearly frustrated and returned walking up the next flight of stairs, “Have him rely on someone other than a Death Eater, just allow Malfoy the opportunity to change. If anyone would be able to, it would be you, not Dumbledore, not his parents, and certainly not his friends. It has to be you. You’re Malfoy’s juxtaposition, oddly enough that might just help you both to sympathize with each other.”
Harry had wondered how Dumbledore would receive news of Malfoy’s inflicted injuries. He could not imagine Dumbledore would respond with anything other than his consistently calm presentation, though Harry had never directly harmed another student in this way, despite the fact that he could not have known the intention of the curse. At least, that’s what he told himself. Although, any judge would sternly remind the boy,
“Why is that?”
That is what she had said. Well, it certainly was ‘sooner.’ Too soon. He had wanted to discuss things privately with Ginny, to figure out their relationship, but it seemed Ron unknowingly would not allow them the opportunity. Many things would have been much simpler if Ron had just outright rejected any budding romance between him and Ginny. Including figuring out his own doubts.
Within the Hospital Wing, he could hear an argument break out between the two Slytherins, and while their voices grew heated, their volume remained low, most likely to not attract the attention of anyone lurking in the corridors. Harry quietly stood up and inched towards the door to better hear their conversation, curious about what topic could possibly cause infighting among the singular-minded friends. He peeked around the corner, seeing the unoccupied white beds he silently reminded him Madam Pomfrey placed Malfoy further into the room.
and when that failed, I used
Harry managed to pass another group of students, disappearing around the corner that led to the Room of Requirement. He skidded to a halt besides the blank wall that stood opposite the ugly tapestry of trolls dancing a ballet, and tightly shut his eyes, pacing along the wall.
“Adalia Yaxley.”
Ron beamed and Harry’s heart sank pitifully into his stomach.
Harry scoffed, “I’m not
“Yeah.”
“Really? You don’t say, I’ve been wondering how I’ve managed to get these injuries,” said Malfoy sarcastically.
“I—” Harry stuttered, then went silent completely. It had always bewildered him when anyone phrased what he had suffered at the Dursley’s hands as abuse or neglect. An image arose in Harry’s mind. His uncle’s purple face transitioned to purple as he hurled insults at him, only concluding the scolding for any minute mishap to lock Harry in the dusty cupboard. In his pantheon of Dursley scoldings, he had never been struck, which made it all the more difficult to recognise his treatment as abuse. He’d imagine Hermione would vehemently refute this, and a traitorous voice whispered that she would be correct.
The air grew heavy and the sound of his steps were muffled by an ambient noise ringing through his ears. If any other sound existed, there was no way to tell. No matter how far Harry walked, he could not escape the ever-present darkness. Still walking at a quick pace, Harry scanned the area around him, consistently moving his head back and forth and back and forth as to not mistake anything seen in his peripheral vision. However, with every step towards the Hospital Wing, the darkness around him only seemed to grow more solid. Suddenly, behind him, before him, above him undefinable messy shapes came to life, hovering mere centimetres from his skin, and a cool dread seeped into every part of his being. Harry was certain he was going to die. One misstep was the only necessity to seal his fate. His heart thundered violently, without restraint, and every last fibre screamed at him to run. Run until he escaped the suffocating darkness.
that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?”
“I know.”
“Well, g—Wait. You’re Harry Potter.”
And she swung forward.
Pansy’s voice grew icy, “The difference between you and I is that I’ve never physically harmed anyone,” and with that, she stormed off in the direction of the hospital wing.
But his reassurance did nothing to satisfy the thoughts that flashed through Harry’s head like a trance.
Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “Seeing as we are nearing the end of this year’s term, I believe it would be appropriate for you to fill in Mister Malfoy’s Prefect responsibilities while he is in recovery.”
“She’s attending the match.”
Another second passed, though, Pierra was the one to speak up this time around, “C’mon stop giving the bloke such a hard time. Let’s spend some time in the common room before the others return,” she tugged on Adalia’s hand, which was tightly clasped around hers, then turned back to Harry, “Sorry about this. Nice meeting you, Harry.”
“There was some punching involved,” Harry shrugged, and Hermione giggled quietly.
“I am?” she asked before rolling her shoulder back and raising her chin up high, “Of course I am—Wait, does this mean?—I’m uncertain what it is you’ve taken from this conversation.”
to do. I wouldn’t expect you to understand!” Malfoy yelled.
“I’ve been meaning to talk to her,” Harry said with a smile that more resembled a grimace.
“And, thus the scarring,” Pomfrey concluded.
If she was shocked or angry with Harry, Madam Pomfrey certainly didn’t let it show on her face, instead choosing to fuss over Malfoy and casting healing incantation more advanced than bother Harry and Hermione had ever seen. Briefly, her hands paused above the sleeping boy and she asked, “What of these scars?”
Harry remained silent, watching Hermione debate what to say. Like clockwork, her face settled into that of determination and she told Pomfrey, “Malfoy had been wounded so that it would have been dangerous to move him, and Harry didn’t want to risk Draco dying while we sought your aid. So, I tried to treat his wounds with
“Leave it, Hermione,” warned Ron.
With Hermione’s semi-dismissal, Pansy turned on her heel and began towards the staircase without checking if Harry was following. The trio stood awkwardly, watching Pansy disappear down the corridor. Hermione and Ron fixed him with worried looks, which Harry ignored, choosing to instead trail after Pansy.
“Hello, Harry, I’ve heard you’ve had quite the unfortunate encounter with young Draco Malfoy,” Dumbledore peered up at him through his crescent-moon glasses with an unreadable expression.
Hermione, in turn, sighed, pushed away the book in front of her in favour of
“Yes. Thank you, Madam Pomfrey.”
Hermione considered this for a moment, then said “Well, obviously, I’d say your aunt and uncle never extended any sort of affection to you. On the other hand, Malfoy never suffered overtly bad parenting, thus he would be far more susceptible to manipulation, especially considering the person he idolises is also his manipulator.”
Dumbledore didn’t ask anything else, merely raised a singular eyebrow signalling for Harry to continue with his explanation. Snape, however, began pacing behind the desk and Harry suspected that he wanted nothing more than to strangle Harry for harming his prized pupil.
she said to the Fat Lady who huffed dramatically and swung open.
. He turned right at a medieval cage with a six-legged skeleton that twisted its malformed head when Harry passed by, took a left at the Vanishing Cabinet he swore Montague had lost the previous year, finally pausing at a nearby cupboard with acid stains that caused the wood to blister where it had come in contact with the solution. The cupboard door creaked open and Harry gently rested his book on the shelf eye-level to him, alongside a small birdcage with a handful of feathers left at the bottom, and slammed the door shut.
“No, it's his own fault he’s stuck in Azkaban because he’s a Death Eater! And you’re gonna become—”
he said tentatively.
“You’ll have to figure it out eventually. About Ginny, I mean,” said Hermione, casting a half-apprehensive glace at the portrait hole, “Sooner rather than later.”
Harry sent a frustrated glare towards the ugly tapestry opposite him, previously he would have laughed at the ridiculousness of a woven Barnabas the Barmy cowering before the trolls clumsily twirling about in the pink ballet garb, but now it only served to mock his failed attempts of entering the Room of Requirement. For what could have possibly been his millionth attempt, Harry fiercely concentrated on different variations of the mantra, which would allow him access to Malfoy.
“Where’ve you—? Why are you soaking—? Is that
Hermione looked at him with an expression that could only be described as contemptuous, “Who do you think cleans the castle? I do believe I told you of this.”
will listen.”
Surveying the common room, it was painstakingly easy to deduce that Hermione had confided in Ron and Ginny concerning his eventful encounter with Draco Malloy. The Weasley siblings shared an uncomfortable look, Ginny wore a worried expression, Ron less so but had his lips pursed, nonetheless. They all seemed to carefully study Harry as if he were a potentially dangerous potion that had been brewed by Seamus Finnigan. Their stares made him uncomfortable and he wanted nothing more than to crawl into some faraway cave inhabited by a dragon who would be delighted to tear him limb from limb. Maybe Harry was being a bit dramatic, but he won’t have thought his friends won’t have reacted so strongly, especially considering it was Malloy whom he had cursed. Although, he was fairly certain Ron had been secretly pleased by this news.
“Oh, like you’re one to talk! You’re nothing but a pathetic school bully,” Harry yelled back, which caused a good number of portraits to mutter indignantly about their disturbed rest.
Wanting to escape the intense atmosphere that surrounded him, Harry snatched a handful of bread rolls from the pile stacked neatly surrounded by a first-year group of students. As he turned to leave, a good number of annoyed protests followed behind him, while the rest sat in stunned silence, wondering if they had really just witnessed Harry Potter steal their food.
“I’m just surprised you didn’t go directly to the match,” said Hermione, unknowingly drawing his attention away from the architecture.
“Is there any truth to them?” She smirked and cocked an eyebrow, and Harry suspected she already knew the answer to that question.
When the clock struck noon Snape who had not spoken at all through the duration of Harry’s detention said coldly, “I think that should do for today. You will continue at eight o’clock next Saturday.
“I’m not quite sure what you’re referring to.”
“Look, mate,” Ron sighed dramatically, though concern was still prevalent on his face,” I’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great—”
“Er,” started Harry, recounting his encounter with the odd pair, “Adalia Yaxley and Pierra… Pierra—I don’t recall a surname.”
Pansy rounded harshly on him, shoving Harry so that he stumbled backward, twisting his legs together in his haste to steady himself before he could trip on his arse. He looked up quickly, expecting Pansy to have drawn her wand, but no such thing happened. Harry immediately regretted his blunt phrasing and Pansy trembling angrily in front of him didn’t resolve this feeling. Pansy Parkinson was a proud and cruel girl, but now she was terrifying. Although she could not have been much taller than Hermione, now she was gigantic not only in her stature but in the way her shoulders were drawn forward rather aggressively and her mouth pulled in a snarl and in the way her presence consumed the corridor so that Harry was frozen to where he cowered before her.
“Do you hear the words coming out of your mouth?”
“Then, what’s stopping you?”
Harry smiled faintly and shook his head at Seamus. Following Seamus’s invitation, Dean, Ron, and Neville glanced up and grinned broadly, obviously still caught up in whatever game they were playing. He had half-a-mind to join; however, they would be expected to attend Prefect duty soon enough, and resting before doing so sounded much more appealing. So, he continued to the boy’s dormitory.
“Why?” Harry inspected his robes and traced his fingers over what could only be dried blood and large patches of sweat trailing down his torso. “Yeah, I’ll change.”
“How original,” Harry said only mildly offended and turned to tug the scruff of hair that was resting annoyingly above his eyes.
There he sat wrapped in several blankets he had possibly stripped from the other unused hospital beds, and a glance around the room confirmed that notion. Amusingly, Malfoy appeared as prideful as ever despite his current circumstance and Harry could, to some degree, appreciate his consistency. However, the boy was still paler than his usual self if that were possible. His cheeks held none of the rosy pink that would typically stain one’s cheeks, nor were his movements without a certain strain, which upon observing made Harry cringe at the sight.
“Then, I suppose it went about as well as me visiting Malfoy,” Harry said sheepishly.
“Er, hello. Look,” Harry sighed inwardly at Malfoy’s unbridled anger, “I wanted to apologize. Properly that is.”
“Of course, you wouldn’t be. I can’t imagine the Wizarding World would be open to, erm, that sort of lifestyle in general, with all the stiffness around muggleborns,” she explained, “Pureblood families would probably see queer wizards as a sort of hindrance to their family lines.”
Harry nodded and retreated to the exit, but not before Snape called haughtily after him, “Potter, eight A.M, sharp. My office.”
“Yes, sir.” Harry quickly moved to stuff a bent card to mark his progress and hurried to the door, anxious to escape the stuffy office and Snape who, along with the ever-increasing number of dead animal heads, was the obvious culprit.
could do could possibly be wrong, no matter who you hurt!” said Pansy angrily, “I hate you! You should’ve been expelled! Had it been anyone else they bloody would have, but
“Yeah?”
“Can’t really blame you there, a little of the git certainly goes a long way,” she paused with a serious look on her face, “Anything else?”
Inside the dormitory, there were items scattered across the floor like a chessboard nearing the end of a game. Where the other boy’s spaces were tidied within reason, Harry’s four-poster bed and the floor beneath it laid strewn with the possessions he had been too lazy to return to its proper place. He chided himself momentarily for the mess but made no move to resolve the issue. Another day perhaps. Atop of his trunk, lay the bloodstain robes, now crumpled in certain places by what he knew was dried blood. Harry thumbed over the particularly flat stains, hardened by blood, and found himself disgusted by the texture. His hand dipped into the pocket, pulling out Malfoy’s wand. Tossing the robes aside, he studied the wand. It was simple in appearance, at least, when compared to his own. The wand itself was sleek, carved from fine quality wood, with a smooth black grip that gradually transitioned into a dark brown as his eyes moved further up the wand. It suited Malfoy.
A silence descended upon them, interrupted only by the footsteps, and shuffling of other students, and of Madam Pince who occasionally passed by, eyeing the students as she did so. With nothing else to do and lost as to write next for his Herbology essay, Harry scanned the library, occasionally letting his gaze linger on some minor detail he had not seen before. Across from him, sitting on the crammed together on the shelves, were possibly hundreds of books that looked as if they had managed to survive several centuries, at least, they certainly smelled like it. When Harry could not quite make out the titles of particular books, he looked upwards, examining the bookshelves’ top layer of dark wooden panels which jutted out like the edges of cobwebs between each spiral pillar. Above, floated golden chandeliers with similarly coloured candles that Harry suspected never required replacement.
“Will it help?”
“The Dark Mark would suggest otherwise,” Harry said stubbornly.
“C’mon, Hermione will give us an earful if we stay up here too long,” Ron said, turning to leave the dormitory, and Harry felt himself nodding along.
“Ha!” shrieked Malfoy before breaking into a nerve-wracking fit of laughter.
“Leave… Please leave,” Malfoy whispered intently, still staring at the wand in his hands as tears continued silently down the sides of his reddened cheeks.
“Err, no,” Harry said awkwardly.
“Shove it, Malfoy,” Harry sneered, snatching his hand away, “I came to
Malfoy seemed to think over Harry’s words over. Then darted from the confines of his hospital bed, surprising Harry as a cold and bonelike hand wrapped around his wrist a pulled him back with more strength than what Malfoy should have possessed in his current state. Harry felt him pulling on it to lift himself up, palms and fingers chilled so that they felt as they had been scorched with an icy flame, and then he tugged upwards so that he was now hovering their arms in front of his face.
“But I assumed that meant you two were an item.”
“I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to harm Malfoy,” Harry finally choked out.
“What?” he asked, still confused.
However, he peered over the magazine upon Harry’s less than subtle entrance, looking completely bewildered.
Harry meandered along the corridors, several groups of students overtook as he did so with some, mostly younger Gryffindors, glancing back at him as they passed by. A small urge told him to hurry along, and Harry imagined himself bursting into a full-throttle sprint towards the Gryffindor tower so that he might join the celebrations; but, he kept walking at the same pace, ignoring everything that told him to do otherwise. In every which direction, shadows, occasionally obstructed by the passing students, walked with, some, he noticed, were darker than others. His eyes passively traced along the edges of the shadows and he watched as they mimicked his movements, some quicker than others.
“I know that,” said Dumbledore softly, “I trust you have learnt something from this experience.”
He barged clumsily into the boy’s dormitory where Ron laid casually strung across his bed, flipping through the latest edition of
“Yes, I do, Potter, and it’s you who’s not listening. It’s
Despite the current circumstances Dumbledore smiled kindly at him and said, “That will be all, Harry.”
and stuffing his mouth with fistfuls of biscuits.
“You can’t help me. No one can help me,” sniffled Malfoy. A tremble possessed Malfoy entirely so that it was a small miracle whatever strength he had prevented him from completely folding in on himself. “I can’t do it. I don’t want to,” continued Malfoy through piercing sobs, “I don’t want to kill... and unless I do, he’ll kill me... My family... But, I... just can’t.”
Harry was stunned by Malfoy’s excuse and by the look on his face, Malfoy had immediately regretted what he said. “You’re mental,” he snarled. Harry had expected Malfoy to snap a defensive retort, but the boy remained silent and stared furiously at his hospital sheets, so he continued, “I didn’t know the impact of that spell, and I’m sorry! But you did! You know what an Unforgivable does and you
to follow such a radical ideology and a child bred to blindly follow said ideology; and given Malfoy’s habit to parrot his father at every opportunity, I’m prone to believe it’s the latter,” when Harry remained silent, she continued, “Honestly, it’s no small miracle you came out as sane with the way your aunt and uncle neglected you.”
“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. “We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!”
“You think I’m a Death Eater?” Malfoy shifted further away from Harry and attempted to laugh, but the sound that escaped his mouth sounded more like an angry sob, “You’ve gone mental!”
Falling.
There, branded upon paper-white skin, was a skill, composed of a faint red ink, with a snake protruding from its unhinged mouth. Harry knew had it been active the tattoo would turn a jet black, but inactive it was more similar to a fresh scar. Draco Malfoy possessed the Dark Mark; that's what he had suspected, and for the second time that day Harry realized that he found no joy when it came to Malfoy’s obvious torment. He had been right, and this proved it. Still, Harry was disappointed and confused at his disappointment.
Harry knew he wasn’t up to par with half of Draco’s previous lovers, but he took it in stride. “I suggest you be nicer to me, or I’ll learn to play with dick elsewhere.”
They would occasionally pull a few, but nothing too big. Strangely, McGonagall was thankful that they weren’t as bad the Weasley twins, definitely not half as bad as the Marauders.
Harry nearly paled. "What?" His stomach dropped and for a moment, he was terrified. The only way out of this marriage was Azkaban. He sincerely hoped Draco hadn't become that desperate.
The warm water caressed his body and made everything feel hotter. It allowed his hand to glide smoothly across his own length, his hips starting to buck.
“At the very least, I would like to lose my virginity to someone I’m in a relationship with.” Harry excused, making Draco chuckle.
good, but it was. Best risotto he’s ever had. It made him a bit excited for dinner. He would've scarfed it all down if it weren't for the presence of his mother and the weasel.
“Uh, a little over a year?” Alex sounded incredibly unsure about themself. Nobody was ever interested in them, only about getting the interview over with.
Harry’s face fell, “Well that isn’t right. That’s your home.” He was a bit upset for Draco, although he understood why the Ministry would make a decision like that, he still didn't think it was right.
He didn’t know anymore. There was no way to logic through the situation because it was so obscure.
Harry took a deep breath as he stared at the renamed incentive that he had very passionately developed in Wizengamot only a week and a half ago.
That night, before they fell asleep, their lover was the last thing they saw. Just like a sunset, it was a beautiful exit into darkness.
Three chapters later and the lawyer was spending his first night in the photographer’s flat. Things were getting a bit steamy, but he wasn’t sure that he was ready. Not only were his characters still new to their relationship, but he didn’t think he was very comfortable with writing the scene. So he had things calm down a bit and moved on to a scene about cuddling. He took a bit of inspiration from his session with Harry, but instead of being interrupted, they kissed.
“What?!” Draco whipped around and crossed his arms. “You thought Blaise was cute?!”
But if he had to share a bed with one person for the rest of his life, he would easily chose Harry.
Draco sat by him and rested his head on his lover's shoulder. "I think so too. You ought to work on something you care without straining yourself. You've already saved the world."
“I agree. I know someone who works for the Prophet that I trust to tell the story.” He chewed his lower lip a moment, almost struggling with what he wanted to say. This conversation wasn’t easy in the slightest but he knew they had to have it. “What should we say?” There was a lot that maybe they shouldn’t include. Like the details of their contract, so no one got any bad ideas of how Harry treated Draco.
Draco’s head snapped to look at Harry with wide eyes and pink cheeks. He may be a flirt, but he was slightly less confident in making such bold moves when it came to the more romantic side of things. His physical boldness really only ever shone in the bedroom. He looked around the table to see a few surprise expressions, but no one was as surprised as him, which told him that they knew of he and Harry’s arrangement. He accepted the handholding and began to eat, quickly losing any trace of shock.
Spending every second of every day together would get boring and vanilla. Having their own hobbies and lives that didn’t revolve around one another gave them things to talk about, and it made seeing the other after a long day even more sweet. But of course, spending a day together every once and a while wasn’t bad either.
She gave a sad smile. "Harry isn't happy about it either. The older members of the Ministry, the ones more likely to agree with Voldemort, this was their idea. I think the younger members saw this as something they could agree on; it wasn't worth fighting. I tried to tell them I had spare shacks you could live in, but they wouldn't listen. I think it's a petty form of revenge from the older ones. A way of embarrassing you both."
Draco took the whimpers as a good sign and sped up slightly. He was already proud by the way he had Harry making such dulcet noises. Bliss flickered in his own body. He felt as if he had somehow gotten closer to his own orgasm by pleasuring Harry. Seeing such an ethereal and beauteous creature revel in ecstasy, he should have known that would be enough for his form to find pleasure.
be okay. Never be afraid to tell me no. I’ll always respect that.”
“You’re my husband."
Apparently everyone had seen it, because all his friends gave Harry a knowing look.
“What?” He didn't see what was so surprising about it.
The blonde’s jaw dropped. “Only once. Don’t say it as if I do it often.” He mocked.
“No. I’m completely numb.”
It wasn’t as if he had never happened upon someone willing to sleep with him, but rather, he’d spent his teenage years in the middle of a war and never had the time. He’d also hoped that his first time would be with a romantic partner and not just a one night stand. Sex was vulnerable and nerve-wracking. He needed someone he could trust, and that couldn’t be a stranger.
“Yes, I should like to see those as well.” The blonde mumbled as he began writing on a spare piece of parchment, only to discover it wrote exactly like a quill. Upon receiving the standard pen, he was shocked to see it produced thin and sharp letters.
It took very little convincing for McGonagall to let Ginny return to her home one Saturday afternoon to be with her family.
“I suppose.” Harry mumbled, quite embarrassed. He wasn’t sure what had come over Draco, but he enjoyed it.
Harry let out a mix of a groan and a shout and his face pushed into the pillow while his back arched sharply. He was hit with a wave of pleasure that left him needy. It only took a few seconds before he knew he was ready. “Deeper, I can take it.”
Harry looked away and almost seemed to glare at the wall as his cheeks turned red. “You’re worse than a girl.” He mumbled.
"That sounds perfect."
“You don’t know that. I happen to know a few people who would kill for a night with you.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Whatever. I'll take insanity, at least then I'd never be bored."
Recently, Seamus had reached out to discuss their favorite novels. They realized they had incredibly similar tastes and went on to analyze and fantasize about their favorite characters together. Now Seamus wanted to meet in person because Draco mentioned Harry's suggestion of writing his own book.
With their hunger appeased and some water in their systems, they both felt a bit better. The next main issue their bodies had was the fact that they were both exhausted. Narcissa fell asleep while curled up in a plush hospital chair that was obviously made with the intention that someone might want to sleep in it. Harry fell asleep in a simple fold-up chair with his upper half bend over as his head rested by Draco's hand. He just had to be near the man to get some rest.
“I just ..... oral sex is like a sexual favor. I do it because I want you to feel good, because we both want it, and because we both enjoy it. I do it because it’s something I want to do
“It isn’t a competition.” Harry laughed.
Then he remembered the one time he almost did.
Harry listened. All this time he’s been sort of alienated to Death Eaters, it was hard to imagine them as multidimensional people with lives and feelings and passions. But perhaps it was easier that way. It’s easy to hurt a stranger, it’s easy to hurt someone if you don’t see them as a full person. Not to say he saw them as less than human. But he didn’t know their ambitions, families, he knew nothing about them besides their anger. It’s easy to hurt someone when they seem like a background character in a story with no backstory or life. It’s very easy. It was in that moment that Harry realized, if he ever needed to hurt Draco for some reason, he wasn’t sure that he could do it. He didn’t want to hurt Draco, but if he had to, he would hesitate first.
Harry cracked a smile, “I’m very aware of that, Draco. You aren’t pretty enough to be a damsel.”
“Is he messy?”
Draco only smirked. “But now it excites you.” He said matter-of-factly. His snooty pride and superiority were both shining through.
While he laughed, Pansy snatched the magazine and finished reading it aloud to the group. “This s-“ She cut herself off and gave Neville a knowing grin before returning to the article. “This sexy idol has become good friends with our number one bachelor and has entered his final year at Hogwarts, where it’s been revealed that he’s begun apprenticing in the hospital wing. With the nickname Nurse Malfoy, this blonde debaucher cou-“ Pansy busted out laughing but managed to get the last of the blurb out through her laughs, “this blonde debaucher could Slytherin our sheets anytime!”
It was so carefully thought out and socially perfected. Draco was momentarily confused as to why Hermione was a Gryffindor rather than Slytherin. He blinked in surprise and sent off a quick thank you.
- - - - -
Harry gave a nod and then hurried off to class, deciding not to think too much about it. It was a Friday, and he was planning on taking Draco with him to see Teddy on Saturday.
Harry shook his head at the idea. “What kind of idiot does that?”
“Not exactly, I do want to work. I definitely don’t want to marry someone because of their money, status, or family name.”
"Draco, shut the fuck up." Harry scolded.
When Harry finally calmed down, he said, “First of all, I am not addicted. Secondly, it wasn’t even my fault that I wanked it was all your bloody fault. Third, of course I flirted with you. You gave me an opening, so I’m going to take it. Fourth, you’re cute. Get used to my flirting now because it seems it’s going to continue for years to come. I’ll either wax poetic or try to sleep with you. There is no in between.”
Harry silently nodded and went into the kitchen, deciding on leftovers from the night before. He appreciated how Draco took his apologies. He was also grateful that Draco had interrupted, because he still didn’t know where he was going with the second one.
Draco noticed Harry’s flinching and hesitantly asked, “Are you alright?”
“Well thank Merlin I’m charming and good-looking.” Harry threw out without even thinking. He wasn’t sure why he was so sarcastic, but he was.
But beyond Draco's warmth, Harry could feel the blonde's collarbone under his hand, the expensive fabric of his robes, and most of all, the soft and steady hand that held his. It was all so strong and steady. He's never been so attracted to someone before. Never in his life has Harry wanted to bite another human before, but he had to feel the shoulder that he rested his hand on, between his teeth.
Draco found himself grinning. Maybe he does fancy Harry. Usually when someone complements him, it doesn’t mean as much as when Harry does. He wasn’t sure why, but Harry calling him beautiful filled him with excitement. He wanted to jump up and down and laugh, he couldn’t believe how giddy it made him.
“I want to help you. Neville fancies you but he says you’re out of his league. If you want, me and Potter have been aching to give him a push to finally ask you out.”
After presenting a list of each of their assets, Lucius tried his hardest to minimize Draco's personal property and get as much as he could under Harry's control. He was actively trying to make their marriage unequal. He wanted to give Harry the tools to ruin Draco's life with hopes that Harry still harbored anger and hate from their time at Hogwarts. He even tried to get Draco's personal vault as part of their communal property, but Molly was adamant in keeping it solely under Draco's name. In the end, it ended up being one of the only things he still owned. With the threat of calling off the marriage and selling Draco off, there wasn't a lot Molly could do.
He gave her the Skele-Gro after warning her that it would taste disgusting. She downed it all and then Draco left her to rest.
Wizards had a funny little version of a firecracker. It was a small ball that gave a loud yell and gave a bright spark whenever it hit it’s target. They were banned from Hogwarts for obvious reasons.
Harry spent the day in a frenzy. After breakfast, he rushed to the florist to put together the perfect bouquet for Draco’s birthday. He was out a few hours, but he finished just in time to run to the kitchen and bribe a few elves to let him sneak out some food in the morning for Draco. His birthday was on a Saturday so they didn’t really plan on going to eat in the dining hall. Draco actually planned to sleep in, and Harry planned to make Draco a nice breakfast in bed while he was asleep.
Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head. "By the way, where's my green hood?" He let Draco wear it once and he wasn't seen it since, except on Draco. Try as he may, he can't find it anywhere.
“So it would seem." Lucius shrugged as if it didn't even matter, as if he'd thought of that too. "There's a certain clause in existing marriage laws that came about when more progressive wizards decided that homosexual marriage should be legal. At the time, it never would have come to pass. So they did the next best thing. They created an immutable clause which states that any changes made to marriage laws will not affect existing couples. This meant that if anyone tried to make a homosexual marriage illegal, it wouldn't nullify existing marriages. And now, it means that your marriage can’t be nullified.” He put on a gleaming smile as he basked in his victory.
The blonde nodded, “Something tells me that even if I didn't, you'd find out.”
Harry didn’t think Draco could catch it. “Oh. Well. Your thighs. I don’t know.” He shrugged. “It was one day in potions class when you were bent over, and I saw your arse. And then I saw your thighs. I don’t know.”
She laughed and shook her head. “Is he always like that?”
“You’re all bark and no bite.”
Harry rolled his eyes but gave a smile. “You’re lucky you’re cute.”
“Love?” Draco questioned in a groggy voice as he slowly woke up. That was the part that stuck out to him. Though love wasn’t exactly a romantic nickname, it did convey at least a bit of affection. He was chuffed to say the least.
Of all possible reactions, Draco actually cracked a smile. "I'm sorry, did you say Lupus?" Somehow, he didn't expect that Harry would have named the hatchlings.
His signal was enough for Draco. Draco cracked a small smile and he crawled into Harry’s arms. “Careful, Potter, or everyone will think you’re in love with me.” He joked quietly.
Suddenly, a book came and hit him in the back of the head.
Epione grinned. "Oh, I'm prepared."
Harry took it and stood. "Thank you, Greenwood. Expect a new project soon." Harry said as he shook the man's hand and left. He already had a few ideas in his mind.
Harry nodded and then closed his eyes. “I- I want to do that again, sometime. Can we do that all the time?”
Draco smiled, taking then and opening the first one. “How to play Quidditch for dummies.” Draco eyes gave a glare but he was smiling, finding the book to be hilarious.
Andromeda gave a nod, “You’re welcome back anytime.”
The food was delicious though a lot more posh than the other aspects of their wedding. Draco was very adamant about the menu, for some reason. He insisted that they serve traditional dishes and Harry didn’t quite care. When he saw the list of foods were all French, Harry wasn’t surprised in the slightest. He found it oddly endearing. Draco had been raised in and very much admired French culture. But that was one thing that was difficult for the blonde to share with Harry. They can share books, necklaces, music, but culture was a bit more abstract. So with every holiday, and now their own wedding, Draco found his own ways to share this part of himself. Harry couldn’t name most of the food but he enjoyed every bit of it.
Draco couldn't help but to grin. The fact that his surname still meant something filled him with pride. Specifically, the fact that it meant something other than evil. He wanted to take the Malfoy name and change it's reputation to one of riches and elegance. He wanted to erase it's association with Voldemort and turn the House of Malfoy into a lavish and opulent one. Draco wasn't a gold-digger per se, but he was a businessman. He planned to replenish the wealth that was lost with the way the war ended due to his father's affiliations.
“No you don’t Harry, stop trying to sleep with my entire family!”
Draco decided to stay off to the side and relax on a large rock while the dragons wrestled with Harry in the water. They understood they were much stronger and larger than Harry, so they went easy on him, like he did when they were little.
He pulled Draco closer again and closed his eyes. He was wrapped in Draco’s warmth, scent, silk, aura, breathing, every fibre of his being was enveloped in the ambience of Draco. His senses were flooded and his mind was numb to everything besides Draco. It was silent and loud, paralyzing and liberating, fiery and mild, so pure and tragic. He burned and ached to confess, but he was chided by the powerful serenity of the room. He was trapped in a glass menagerie of love. He couldn’t move or speak, because if he did, he could ruin everything. But he had never been so free to display his love for Draco.
“I’m certain he knew.” Narcissa whispered. Her own voice was broken with sadness. “He knew it was too soon to say it.”
His jaw dropped and he almost looked concerned. “Draco, how much did you spend on this?”
Instead, he wrapped his hand around the necklace he wore and closed his eyes, besides the fact he thought this was a terrible time to give Harry a shock of warmth.
Teddy curled up towards Draco to try and hide from the new person.
Draco took pity on him and let his hand slide down Harry’s body, rolling over his abs, and resting by his cock. He used the pad of his thumb to caress the underside of him, making Harry whine and roll his hips into the touch.
Harry and Draco didn’t get much sleep that night. They didn’t really talk, they didn’t laugh, they didn’t cry, and they weren’t tired in the slightest. They were just silent and let their emotions sit inside of themselves. All the regrets and sadness that they had already shared. They let it be.
Many raised concerns that were genuine, some pushed to have the department dispelled, and others spoke just to have their name on the department's history. While many were legitimate, some were obviously more concerned with notoriety and image.
Harry only rolled his eyes. “Right, then you’d better look into rings. Hermione’s a size six.”
Harry was very excited to explain Christmas to Teddy, “Do you know what today is?”
Harry looked a bit confused but layed on his stomach. He was only wearing a shirt and jeans so Draco didn’t need him to remove any layers. Although he was hesitant about it, he would give it a chance for Draco.
“Then don’t ask questions like that. Use your imagination and I’m certain you could figure it out. Now come on, I want eggs and toast for breakfast.” He insisted, ready to start the day.
He found himself sitting at his kitchen table writing out his reply.
“Wait.” The blonde put a hand to his chest to stop him. “You haven’t finished.”
Draco was immediately interested as to how Harry was going to contact the dead using a piece of paper.
Part of Harry was floored by how they were casually shopping for a Christmas tree together and no one had noticed. He was also shocked by how natural it felt to do something so domestic with Draco. The overwhelmed employee who sold them the tree didn’t even seem to notice who she was selling it to and mindlessly wished them a lovely day before moving on to the next customer.
Harry was hurt. Typically their teasing in Hogwarts had never really bothered him. But this was beyond all of that. This dug deep into him and hit him in a weak spot he didn’t even know he had. He just gave a half-nod and walked out. He went into his bedroom, laying down and locking the door. He curled up and decided it was time for a nap.
Perhaps he didn’t get his mother’s brains.
Dean took a deep breath and decided to be brave. “I suppose not, so I made Seamus my boyfriend and we moved in together.”
Draco stared at him with a resting bitch face. He refused to give Harry a verbal response to play off of.
There it was. Another hint of shock to hit the members of Wizengamot. They couldn't believe the story they were being told. All that pain and suffering he told of, the anger and sympathy they felt, and now, they were being told of care. Genuine care.
“A bit, yea. It’s sexy, I can’t help it.”
Ron, meanwhile, was inhaling his food in the kitchen. “Get rejected?” He joked.
He never thought he would be physically attracted to Harry, but of course he was, Harry’s the most charming and hilarious man Draco’s ever met. Not to mention how gorgeous he is.
Andromeda looked inside and paled, “Harry! Where did you get money like this? I can’t accept all this.”
“I want to focus on The Cupboard Project. Pawk and Pansy have been informed of my doings in Wizengamot. I’m entrusting them to pick-up where I leave-off. I listed you as a friend for them in the media. You’ll still get stories about a Wizengamot, Alex, but they won’t be from me.” He gave a sort of sad smile. “Wizengamot never made me happy. I know it isn’t meant to be a happy job but it isn’t something that can satisfy me. But caring for orphans and saving people from abuse, that’s what I want to do. That’s what makes me happy. So I’m retiring.”
Draco could see that Harry was conflicted with something, so he sat by the Floo and turned to the other. "What's wrong?"
The two boys sat together on the couch, each occupied in their own little worlds. They had never been in the same room for so long, yet they were entirely unbothered by the presence of the other. It was nothing short of a miracle.
"I'll hex the daylights out of you, git."
Harry nodded, "I remember you told me about them. You said they're green because that's the color you think looks best on you." The blonde was a bit impressed that Harry remembered. As he went to clean his plate, he heard Harry comment, "I agree." Which gave the blonde pause as he turned to look at the other man. "My, Harry. Did you just flirt with me?"
Draco sighed, “Boring. I thought you were off having an affair.”
He wasn't proud of the way he felt, but for the most part, he didn't care at all. Not anymore. He used to care about the things he did. He cared about the effects his actions had on other people. Then he stopped, but was ashamed of the way he had stopped caring. His loss of compassion was mourned. But now, he didn't care at all. Now, it was only a game that he yearned to play. It was a once lively playground, empty and rusted.
"Want to kiss again? Two more and you'll have repaid your debts." He joked with a small smile.
Harry was taken aback. Was Draco seriously threatening him? “Oh, and why wouldn’t these spells books be in Hogwarts?”
“I thought I might’ve hurt you, with what I said.”
“Are you writing without looking?”
Draco was in love with the house. Harry thought it was alright. He wasn’t really picky, he could imagine himself living in it, and he loved the privacy and proximity to Hogwarts. He didn’t have to be in love with a house to know it’s what he wants. It felt right, and that’s enough.
- - - - -
“Need any help?”
. You’ve stood up for me so many times, when no one else would. You made me believe in myself, showed me magic.” He hesitated a moment. “I really don’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable or anything, but quite honestly, you were sort of like a mum to me. I didn’t really have anything like that until I met you. You cared about me, and for the longest time, I couldn’t figure out why. It made no sense that anyone would care about me. But you did. I don’t think you have any idea just how important you are to me. I was in a bad place, a really bad place. You got me off the edge more times than you know. I’m not one for dramatics, so you know I mean it when I say I probably wouldn’t be alive right now if it weren’t for you. So, thank you.”
Draco was having a lovely day in the hospital wing. Everything was nice and quiet, not too many people were in, there were a few colds going around but nothing a bit of medicine couldn’t help.
Draco smirked and tightened his grip. In the time between their grinding and touching, he knew Harry’s orgasm had probably faltered a bit, so he started off at a fast pace to see just how close he other was.
Harry seemed to think a moment. "I suppose I should explain the rules, here. Never approach a dragon, and you already know to stay out of the west end. Avoid the southeast as well. After courtship, a dragon couple will head southeast for a few weeks of sex. Dragon's are also incredibly vain. They bathe often, use leaves to shine their horns and claws, they also go into hiding to molt in private. That's done in the north, so avoid that too. The shacks are in the northeast, more east than north, far enough not to bother the dragons. There are signs showing you when you're getting too close to a forbidden area."
He had no idea that in that moment, James' heart shattered. Those words had absolutely wrecked him. Remus and Sirius took a moment to comfort him, continuing the conversation with Harry so he wouldn't suspect anything.
His eyes widened. “You freely told her all of the things she told me?”
“Is that how you feel?” Harry couldn’t help but to feel at-fault. He knew a scene like that couldn’t come from no where. Something about it was just a bit too personal, and he couldn’t help but to ask.
Little did Harry realize, there was a reddish-purple mark on the side of his neck. But everyone else did.
Draco stirred and slowly woke up. He opened his eyes and he furrowed his eyebrows. “What time is it?”
“And what
He accepted her offer and she got some house elves to prepare a room and get him some pajamas.
He wanted to forget, he so badly wanted to forget. If he forgot then he didn’t have to deal with it. Maybe he was just avoiding the fear. Maybe this was the way his brain decided to protect itself. By staying inside where there are no attackers.
“I don’t remember who’s idea it was to ruin Crow’s reputation but I was the one who dug up and leaked her failed St. Mungo’s reform. The idea was that no one would want to associate with her after the backlash, allowing Hermione and Pawk to emerge as her only friends so that she would use her influence with the older crowd to get votes.” He only gave a shrug, as if it didn’t matter that much. “Then I did the opposite with Luther, and that
He continued to stare at it, his gaze turning to complete and intent focus. His mind began to reel.
One day, Draco bursted into his and Harry’s dorm. His face was red and blotchy, tears were rolling down his cheeks, and he looked a mix of angry and sad.
He reached over and gently nudged Draco. “Draco, hey, wake up. It’s time to go see Teddy, yea?” He called softly.
She chuckled. “I didn’t even know you two were together. I meant it as a joke.” She looked Draco up and down teasingly. “You ought to step up Draco, or I’ll tell your mother to set you straight.” She joked.
She knew he would. “For being such a good sport, I’ll even go first. Draco has a serious fixation for your eyes. He loves them. Thinks they’re so sexy. He’ll go on and on about how beautiful they are. He even said eye contact with you is sinful.”
“We use magic for all the medical tosh, obviously. We aren’t as primeval as you think.”
Harry willed his away and Draco eventually got up to fix his in the shower. He had to spent his first day of break in the hospital wing. He and a few of his coworkers decided to meet up on the first day of break and brew a bunch of medicines so they would have a good stock for the end of year antics that always occur. Pranks, fights, even sleep deprived accidents. It’s unavoidable.
Harry’s squirming didn’t slow, but rather, turned into trembles and writhes as everything became even more intense. His eyes widened and his lips parted as he felt the rush finally begin. The rush that would take him to the end. He knew Draco was close, but not as close as him. A cry left him as his hands flew to grip Draco’s torso and nearly clawed at his back. His hips gave fervid rolls and ruts in a desperate search for the end. He was overwhelmed and his eyes rolled back some.
He traveled the path that he made for himself, following his plans of media warfare. Somehow, with each step, he doubted himself less and less. The Sorting Hat wasn't wrong to call him half-Slytherin. Maybe he ought to embrace it, rather than being the perfect Gryffindor that died with the war.
“I wasn’t a runt!” Harry was a bit insecure about his own height. Most men were taller than him and a lot of younger boys were too. He wouldn't call it a Napoleon Complex, but his friends do.
“Oh. Then perhaps I should mention everything else that happened.” Harry mumbled, a bit guilty at all the information he had been withholding. He told them about how he and Draco had been cuddling, laying together, going to sleep in each other’s beds, his Howler prank gone wrong, their Christmas together besides the massage and boner, he also decided to skip his experimentation with the dark arts and slight breakdown, but he did talk about how he has a crush on Draco and isn’t sure if Draco likes him back.
- - - - -
Harry couldn't help but to crack a smile. "I'd love to." He stood up and mumbled something about changing clothes as he went down the hall.
"How inappropriate?" He asked as they both went into the sitting room to take their places on opposite sides of the couch. This is how their nights usually went. For the past week they've found themselves sitting on the couch together after dinner, conversing.
The blonde smirked and sped up. He wanted Harry to be suddenly overcome with his orgasm, like Draco had been. He watched Harry’s head turn from side to side with his arm shielding his closed eyes, his hips rolled as quickly as they could, and his face twisted into something desperate. Whines and shivers flowed from Harry so easily. He felt the pleasure return to him as if they had never left off and he began drifting close to the edge.
The train ride was painful for Harry, but it was necessary. He rode from Hogwarts to King’s Cross Station. There, he and his friends said their goodbyes. Of course, no one really said goodbye. Goodbye means forever. Instead, they said, see you soon. That was much better.
Harry got up with a soft groan and the blonde pretended the sound didn’t give him a rush between his legs. He smirked to himself and tucked the bottle under his arm while he brought out the two glasses. He set it all out on the coffee table before the sofa and then went back to grab their houses. When he returned, the fire was warm and Harry was walking back from his bedroom with a small wrapped gift in his hand.
Harry on the other hand, was still a bit scandalized and embarrassed. “I was not!”
Harry cried out and his body shook at the rush of pleasure the moan gave him. It sent vibrations through his most sensitive place and he couldn’t handle it. “Fuck! Draco!” He nearly shouted the words.
Draco tended a bit to the food as he thought about denim, his silence letting Harry return to the book in his hands. Denim looked wonderful on Harry though it seemed entirely unfashionable. Part of him couldn't fathom why Harry would choose such a fabric but he also loved the way it looked and couldn't complain.
They were in a bubble. Just them. The outside world didn’t exist at all. There were no worries, hesitations, or doubts. There was nothing beyond the walls of their room. They were together, safe and sound in a bubble. Nothing else mattered.
Harry could only sigh and shrug in regards to the story. He couldn't be bothered with it.
Draco frowned and nodded. "Yes. I'm aware." It was a truth he didn't want to face, but reality had made it well known.
“I should have expected this. Once all bark and no bite, now the opposite. You’re far too desperate to do both.” He sounded as if he was crooning the words to some sultry song.
Draco let out a laugh and shook his head. “And you wonder why I”m so confident, you make it easy. But then again, with my arse on the line, it’s tempting to lose.”
He continued by saying, “That was ..... beautiful. You were supposed to embarrass him, not seduce him. That was poetic.”
Draco was hit by an overwhelming wave of pleasure. He threw his head back in a silent scream as he came into Harry’s mouth. He was silent only a few seconds before his body trembled once more and he began to chant Harry’s name in shouts that slowly quieted to broken whispers.
Ron took a deep breath. “It’s nearly time for lunch, I could help you cook.” He offered, “So long as you feed me.”
He sank down a bit deeper at Harry’s adjustment, his head tossed back and a cry fell from his lips. He finally found it. “Oh yes! You’re so sweet.” He began to squirm his hips around, grinding onto the length that rubbed him so well. He even loved the way Harry’s hairs scratched at his balls, greeting them with a rough pleasure.
“Seems you got a secret admirer.” Ron commented.
"I just, I. Uhm. I didn't think it through this far." His voice was soft and he ducked his head a bit, feeling a mix of joy and meekness.
Harry receives another letter from Draco and they spend Valentine’s Day together. Draco discovers he needs to teach Harry to relax.
Harry smirked a bit, getting an idea of what he was going to do later. “I like it when he wears silk and stuff like that. He has these pajamas, I think they’re his favorite, and it’s this kind of sheer pastel blue and it looks so good on him. And then I just wear a t-shirt and whatever pajama pants to bed and I look like a mess next to him.”
“Oh, I don’t know. I could do for a nice cuddle.” Draco tempted with a quirked eyebrow.
Pansy laughed and shrugged. "Legally, yes. Don't get all territorial just because his jeans fit him well."
“Wow. First you teach him to cook spaghetti and now this, slow down, will you?” She joked.
The Auror nearly chocked and gave a confused expression before quickly returning to a more neutral one. Still, it was littered with nuances of surprise and confusion.
Harry was serious, “I had never seen hair so blonde and light before. I thought it was beautiful.” He figured he might as well be honest since he had dug himself into a hole.
He looked down to see Draco’s arm was where Harry’s chest once was. “Oh.” He let out a breathy chuckle. “Sorry.”
Harry was hit with a wave of shock. Someone knew them. It was a numbness that momentarily took him over. Meeting someone who knew his parents had never turned out well. In his experience, they either want to kill him, or they end up dead.
Draco found himself of the verge of slapping Harry. He briefly considered it, but decided not to. “I don’t know what happened in that bathroom but you need to forget it! Get it out of your head right now because you need to stop this nonsense! You aren’t and never will be a murderer, the war is over!” He grew louder and was shouting by the end of his spiel, completely overtaken by his own emotions that had been brought up at the mention of his near-death experience.
Draco grinned to himself and paused, noticing in the mirror that his own lips had turned a velvety red from the kisses. He touched them and they felt warm. He liked it more than he wanted to admit.
“Then you should know I got on your father hard about that.”
They looked at few other decorations and Harry found himself a bit overwhelmed when he saw the wizard version of Christmas lights that were meant to be hung around a tree. It was little candles in glass bulbs, meant to rest on the branches. It looked very flammable and it was a nightmare Harry wasn’t willing to deal with. “We should really look into the Muggle alternative for Christmas lights. They’re a lot less dangerous.” Though he hadn’t really told Draco, his house had a bit of electricity.
Harry took a deep breath. It was over and he was married. He wasn’t sure how he felt. In fact, he didn’t really feel anything other than a misplaced sense of relief from the contract being finished.
Harry was done fighting. He had given everything, even his own life, to the war. Now, he wanted to repair things. He wanted to see things get better. He wanted simplicity. Amidst his writing, he came to realize that this was his second chance at life.
He then wondered how the book could have known about that. He looked through some more and saw that at the end of the chapter, there was a little blurb about how the author died of dragon pox, but through dark magic, was resurrected.
“Well, Harry, that depends on what you want to do.” She grabbed his wrist and lead him over to a bench in the corridor so they could talk. “Harry. If you want my help, I need to know your exact intentions and feelings. For starters, are you certain that you love Draco?”
Harry was a bit tanner than him, he always had been. Rough patches of skin like little deserts, a few freckles scattered and colored like soil, hair of dark little forests, the most enchanting oceans of green, small but defined muscles, there was a softness in those rolling hills. He had all the beauty of nature with the sweet reddish lips and wild curls of some Greek nature deity. Harry looked as if he belonged in a Renaissance painting that Draco would have bought to keep in his room, for his own pleasure. A picture of allure and charm that he could never touch. Something higher than him, greater than him, something to bring him to his knees to pine over for the rest of his days.
Especially Harry. He knew exactly how much it meant to Draco that he be a Healer at Hogwarts. Even if he wasn’t to take over the hospital wing, healing people matter to him more than any of that.
A small laugh escaped Harry. “That still isn’t much of an excuse.”
While Alex and Harry walked the line of pillowtalk, Seamus and Draco were all over the subject.
There had also been some new arrests in the hunt for dark witches and wizards. There were some small factions of Voldemort’s followers they hadn’t died out and still felt that they could continue without him. While they were arrested, a new inclusiveness was taking over Hogwarts. Young Slytherins were welcomed and befriended by the other houses instead of isolated and judged. Things had changed for the better and Harry couldn’t have been happier with the way things turned out.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, a bit bewildered. “And what exactly does a bottom look like?”
“Well if it’s any consolation, I’m glad it’s you. I’d rather this be handled by someone I know."
Very soon.
He moved his tongue faster, sliding in and out, licking around, exploring the new territory, and searching for sensitive spots.
He now had the ability to silently kill in a matter of seconds, and all he had to to was look.
Harry let out a whine and squirmed again. “Git.”
“Skincare isn’t a game.”
It didn't surprise Draco to discover that his father was scouring legal texts for a solution. He didn’t doubt his father also yearned for revenge against Narcissa and Draco. His only hope was using the money in his personal vault to find his own place and escape, until he received a letter from Gringotts informing him that his account had been frozen by his father. When he asked about it, Lucius had the gall to laugh and said he wasn’t going anywhere until he had his wine back.
“Why would you want to do that?” Part of him just considered it to be just a joke. But part of him didn’t understand why Draco would even consider doing something like that with someone like him.
“Alex, I’d like to ask you a few questions of my own.” Harry made himself sound confident, as if he’s done this a million times. Confidence, he’s learned, is very rarely questioned. “How long have you been working at The Daily Prophet?”
Harry only sipped his hot chocolate. “It’s too early for this.” Really, it was just a lame excuse to try to cope with the way Draco's flirting worked on him.
Draco only raised an eyebrow, not looking away from his writing. "Yes, but I actually had breakfast."
After extensive conversation the following day, Harry and the Weasleys felt pretty neutral about Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t a willing participant in the war or in his activities as a Death Eater, he’d even taken care of Luna while she was trapped in his Manor. Had they gone to Hogwarts in a world where Voldemort didn’t exist, they might have been friends. Nevertheless, Draco was also a victim in this marriage, and Molly wasn’t just there to fight for Harry.
His eyes widened as he looked around the room. Everything was so clear and sharp, rather than the light blur he was used to. It was suddenly so much easier to see and he didn’t have to squint or stare to take in details. He could finally take in features he never could before. The room was almost overwhelming. “Has that pillow always had dots?” He asked as he picked up a throw pillow that was covered in very small dots. He then looked over at Draco and meant to say something, but instead, he froze. “You have gingerbread crumbs on your lip. I can see them.” He had no idea they were there before.
“I’m sad of course. But I think we’ve had enough late nights discussing our feelings about what happened.”
The plan was for Harry to keep the map in his pocket so he wouldn’t have to explain why he was carrying it around.
“I don’t know. But I will eventually.”
Harry let out a chuckle. “Not so innocent now, am I?”
Harry didn’t respond, because Draco was completely right.
Draco quickly tore his clothes off and began stroking himself with his lubed hand, trying to get as slick as possible.
He felt the length inside of him slowly move further. He blushed and let out a soft moan.
They pulled away and Harry gave a nod. “I can’t wait to work with you.”
Harry’s eyes widened, “I-Inappropriate?” He felt like the conversation had taken a sharp turn from where he thought it was going.
"I-" He cut himself off and smiled, "Thank you Mr. Lupin, that really means a lot to me."
The enchanted quills were writing down every word Harry spoke, describing the scene and the emotions. To Harry, this wasn’t just a testimony, this was PR.
The blonde noticed and spared him a few glances. Part of him got worried as he only ever knew Harry to space-out when he was remembering unpleasant things or when he was overwhelmed, and this looked a lot like spacing-out. “Harry? Are you alright?” When the other didn’t respond he asked his question again and took the other’s hand in his.
Draco grinned, “Oh, have you heard the letters he’s written me?”
They both celebrated at the idea that their daydream of being coworkers at Hogwarts was coming true. It was as if luck was on their side.
Harry took a deep breath. “Draco, you are such a diva.”
"I skipped it."
Harry, meanwhile, was incredibly confused. As much as he wanted to ignore it, he couldn't get past he fact that he was fantasizing about curling up on the sofa with the man beside him. He's never wanted that before. Of course he's enjoyed having his significant other sit in his lap and he likes hugs, but cuddling was a concept too foreign and vulnerable. It was kind of intimidating to him. Yet instead of feeling uncomfortable or awkward about his thoughts they only made him feel warmer. That alone told him something was very wrong. Idle conversation continued as he tried to get himself sorted in his head.
He smiled and hugged her in return. “I’ve missed you.” He spoke in a soft tone, holding her close.
It was enough to jolt his senses and shift his focus. Once Draco was off of him, he started grabbing at his lover’s erection.
“Ah, no big deal. But we might should get you to a bathroom and clean you up.”
Draco was in a very similar conversation with Madam Pomfrey. “Basically, what I’m trying to say is, I’m very interested in being a Healer and I would like to see how you do your job.”
“I’ve got to get to your arse somehow.” Draco said with a chuckle. He then laid between Harry’s legs and set a hand on each thigh. He felt how tense the boy under him was. His eyes trained on his first target. Tight, hanging, darkly furred. He leaned in close and let his pointed tongue glide across Harry’s balls.
The afternoon went by innocently enough. Draco even got to feed Teddy a bottle of milk.
He found himself only centimeters away from Draco’s face, which was strange since earlier they weren’t so close. He leaned in without even realizing it.
"It was well. We accidentally planned out a bit of a potential book." He said before taking another sip. "I'm still on the fence about writing but I'm heavily considering it. Some reporters got a few pictures of us when we left. I wonder what stories they'll spin out of it." As his mind drifted, his disinterest changed to a small smirk. "I'm hoping at least one thinks we're dating." He couldn't resist the appeal of just a bit of mischief.
Pansy froze and her lips parted in shock. “That’s terrible.”
Draco held him tighter and closed his own eyes. “There’s no need, Harry. I’ll always listen if something’s wrong.”
They’d finally finished writing out plans for reporting, investigating, and prosecuting abuse. With two days left they were in the home stretch. This rough draft was meant to go through the entire department of magical law to edit it, Hermione and Harry were to review it once more, and then to Wizengamot and the Minister for approval. They were high on how close they were to finishing it all. Hermione was typing as fast as she could and Harry was reading off the final few paragraphs.
Harry let out a chuckle and went to wash himself off.
“Irrelevant.”
“Of course I will. I’ll send it out today if you wish. I’ll set the meeting for Saturday, how does that sound?”
“Alright, then don’t be disappointed if you get a Howler telling you you've got a nice arse.”
The two silently ate at the table while Ron and Harry continued their quiet conversation.
A satisfied smirk took over Harry face as Draco slipped back into his rough pace. He enjoyed the pleasure and listened to the glorious sounds behind him. In some sordid way, it was amusing. As if the sound of Draco was nothing more than entertainment, and Draco’s cock was the control that he was just learning to use with. He let out a low groan and a shiver ran through him as he really listened to how close Draco was. He heard trembling in Draco’s voice, the frantic need, the desperation, the way it cracked and jumped in pitch. It was like a song, the way his voice shook and changed key, like the little nuances of a singer’s voice. A melody of desire and orgasmic grief. Sweet music filled the room, and Harry reveled in the wretched song that echoed only for him.
Harry nodded, “So, how exactly has your family stayed pureblood all these years?” He wondered this since there were apparently only twenty-eight pureblood families.
Draco's eyes widened in surprise, enraptured by every word, holding on. He heard everything he's ever wanted to hear. So sweet and rough, selfish and pure, it sound like an adventure. With that, he knew his heart was stolen.
Harry stayed up an extra two hours, worrying about his thoughts and wondering what exactly it was that he felt. Draco stayed up late as well, but for very different reasons. He was far beyond figuring out how he felt, and instead, had to cope with his feelings. His current issue, however, was far beyond emotional. Really, Draco would have preferred emotions to his current predicament.
“Yea.” Harry sighed out the word and then looked away, blinking his tears away.
Last was physical touch. Harry tried little things such as holding Draco’s hand while they sat in the common room together, brushing against him while they walked, and of course, he inevitably gave Draco a couple more blowjobs. But that was mostly because he enjoys it just as much as Draco does.
“You’re right, you aren’t. But you don’t have to be to feel numb. Taking a life, whether they deserved it or not, whether you wanted to or not, is traumatic. Numbness is how you deal with the trauma of having killed.”
Draco nodded. He started saying an unfamiliar spell, made a motion with his wand, and aimed at Harry.
Harry shrugged, “I just get really cold. I think it’s from the cupboard when I was kid. It was so small and right by a vent, so it got hot easily. I think I got so used to the heat that I never properly got used to the cold.”
Harry smiled back, thanked him, and went on his way.
Perhaps none of them were ready for parenthood just yet. Maybe some of them never will be. But they have time. They have all the time in the world.
Harry nodded. “Yea. She also wants you to come around for New Years.”
Draco also spent his days keeping up with the new Wizengamot. He wasn't shocked to hear some new members were werewolves and vampires, but of the fifty members he was surprised to hear eleven were Slytherin.
“That’s wonderful! I’m happy for you two.” He flashed a genuine smile that seemed to relieve a nervousness he hadn’t even noticed they held.
Harry was having none of that. “You kiss me a lot. Made me less shy about physical intimacy. You’ve been my first ..... a lot of things.” He got a bit shy. “You helped me through a lot of dark things. You showed me how to be okay again. You care about me like no one else has before. You get mad when I do dangerous things, you love every part of me, it’s so unconditional. You try to make me laugh and smile when I’m upset. You were the first person to make me think about the future. I never thought about my life in five years, ten years ..... even one year. You were the first person to listen to everything, and accept every part of it. I’ve never been so loved before. Don’t sell yourself short. You’re phenomenal.”
“I mean,” Hermione said, nodded a silent farewell at the few house elves still working and turned, taking long strides towards the portrait hole, “Malfoy’s assassination attempts—”
Falling.
Silence fell between them, and Harry clamoured to alleviate his discomfort at Dumbledore’s cold assessment of Harry’s half-story, “It isn’t that I meant to have a duel with Malfoy. He just whipped around and tried to curse me, and...”
for themselves. For example, when did you decide you were attracted to Ginny Weasley,” she finished with a smug grin, to which Harry groaned, letting his head fall to the table dramatically.
“It’s none of your business who I associate with,” said Malfoy with a nasty sneer.
“My teammates are all capable players, sir,” Harry stated firmly.
Despite this, Harry dutifully presented himself outside Dumbledore’s office, knocked, and the lone gargoyle sentry scowled down over its beak deliberately before shifting to reveal the golden spiral staircase. He sullenly trudged upstairs until he reached the door, which knowingly swung open to reveal a frail Dumbledore who smiled pleasantly at Harry, nonetheless, and Snape adorned entirely in funeral-like robes, standing just behind Dumbledore’s shoulder. Snape lifted his lips into a sneer and his beady black eyes watched through the curtains of his greasy hair as Harry took hesitant steps in the office, pausing when he was only a meter from the grand desk carved from oaks wood.
The small sliver of hope he desperately clung to that this time he would succeed, that this time he would discover Malfoy’s surely malicious plans, vanished the moment his feet came to an abrupt halt and his eyes fluttered open to see the firm, doorless, stone wall that he had hoped he wouldn’t. Harry’s hard glare traced the creases in the stonework of the wall as if he could somehow will an entrance to appear before him. Then, sharp pain flared across his knuckles, when his fist slammed into the heavy stone that his eyes had assessed not a moment earlier. Harry regretted his outburst almost immediately, it was, after all, useless in the way that it did nothing to solve the issue ever so present in Harry’s mind, and it did nothing to satisfy his anger towards Malfoy, towards his friends, towards Dumbledore, towards Voldemort, towards everyone who looked at him like some kind of saviour. Like the Chosen One. It was an almost laughable notion. How could any sane wizard entertain the thought that he, a mere child, could possibly overcome the most powerful dark wizard of the modern era? Not when he could not even figure out where a snivelling, spoiled sod like Draco Malfoy had been disappearing to all this time.
“Potter?” asked Malfoy, his voice weak from sleep, while squinting in his general direction.
Confused, but nonetheless relieved by the sudden omission, Harry nodded and quickly turned to shove the unfinished essay into his schoolbag full of other crumpled parchment and textbooks. Hermione stood up and the chair scooted backward in accordance. Hoisting her satchel over her shoulder, Hermione strutted across the alongside the table, mechanically shoving ornately carved wooden chairs back into their proper position as she did so. Harry followed behind her, leaving the books he had snagged from the shelves on the table. The pair passed several rows of bookshelves with a few students still scattered about the tables where they sat engrossed in their own homework, while others sat chatting quietly, only pretending to read whenever Madam Pince passed by like some sort of grim reaper. Madam Pince looked up at the pair, looked at the window, frowned in a way that made the marionette lines around her mouth all the more prominent, then began to chide nearby students for not also leaving the library for the night.
She glanced from side-to-side in an over-exaggerated motion, “Seems as such.”
The first thing he noticed about her, despite the shock of white-blonde hair that could only ever be camouflaged by fresh snow, was the disproportionately large stormy-green eyes that seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of everything and anything. Fortunately, or unfortunately for her, this sat in direct juxtaposition with her overtly innocent appearance, which was only exemplified by the flowery white dress she currently adorned. Then, she fixed Harry with a rather accusatory stare and asked, more demanded, “Were you flirting with Pierra?”
“If this is about—"
For a moment, the room had gone silent, then Harry heard footsteps hurriedly approaching where he stood still spying on the two Slytherins. Panicked and without many options, he returned to his original seat against the stone and pretended as if he had dozed off, thankfully before Pansy burst through the entryway. She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw Harry’s poor attempt to look as if he hadn’t been listening. Harry cracked an eye open and found Pansy glaring at him through silent tears that slipped out of the corners of her eyes.
“You did?” Malfoy’s eyes wracked Harry up and down as if assessing whether Harry would attack him. Shifting his weight foot to foot, Harry glanced at the doorway and wondered if Hermione would be disappointed if he failed to endure another conversation with Malfoy. However, he had a feeling that enduring Malfoy’s company would be far less painful than the insufferable anguish caused by one of Hermione’s lectures if he were to go against her plan.
“Oh, and Mister Potter,” Pomfrey said, almost as an afterthought, “You’ll need to explain Mister Malfoy’s condition to the Headmaster.”
Harry’s heart constricted in his chest. “It came from a thrift shop, sir,” Harry invented wildly, then his face settled so that it remained expressionless.
“It’s not that I think you
s when the pair entered an unlit corridor, “It is Malfoy we’re talking about, not some Death Eater. I don’t like him any more than you do, but that doesn’t change the fact he’s only a teenager! Not some hardened criminal.”
Snape cleared his throat, attempting to redirect the conversation to their original topic, but Dumbledore seemed determined to deny Snape the opportunity. “Now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, anchoring Harry with the sensation that he was under an X-ray, “What precisely transpired in your encounter with Mister Malfoy?”
Harry leaned back in his chair, stretching his neck side-to-side while eyeing the frown that seemed to be stuck on Hermione’s face. At the very least, it made sense he supposed. Among the students, especially those of pureblood status, sex had always been something not to be discussed as if it were a dirty family secret, and only ever met with hushed, but solemn whispers. As such, it stood to reason that any deviancy would be met with scorn or worse. Actually, he could not remember any mention of homosexuality, at least among the boys, and if there had been such a discussion, he certainly was not an active participant.
Harry roared from the floor, waving his wand wildly and without caution.
“Your schoolbag, Potter,” Snape finally snarled.
of your schoolbooks. Do make sure to not leave any of them behind. I shall discuss your punishment with Dumbledore, and know that you’ll be lucky if I don’t—”
“Thank you,” she smiled softly.
“Ah, nothing,” the girl, now Pierra, smiled softly at the other girl and took her hand in her own, “Just waiting for you.”
used it!”
“Now Severus,” Dumbledore interrupted almost cheerfully. Snape continued to scowl but fell silent at Dumbledore’s request. “Harry, do be along, now. We shall settle this matter when you return; and do try to avoid any detours, “he finished with that omniscient look that Harry had grown accustomed to over all his years at Hogwarts.
Harry scrambled from his bed, accidentally tearing the sheets from the mattress in his haste and dashed across the room. Throwing the door open, Harry saw Malfoy loitering, almost patiently, on the tower’s stairs. He threw himself at Malfoy, but the boy dodged his attack and turned to meander down the steps with Harry trailing behind. Despite Harry's desperate sprint down the tower, Malfoy remained out of reach even at his fairly slow pace. Had he not been so absorbed with that fact that Malfoy had invaded his dorm room, Harry would have figured this odd. It seemed as if the tower stretched on forever with Harry rounding a curve only to watch as white-blond hair wisped just out of sight.
“There were students at school? During a quidditch match?” Hermione gasped sarcastically, “They might actually pass their classes.”
to Snape, who would undoubtedly snatch it away from him.
Several pairs of eyes, some more hostile than others, followed Harry as he abruptly stood from the table and made his way back towards the entrance. When he reached the entrance, Harry took an abrupt right.
“He’s what?” Hermione shrieked from behind him where she had stopped completely with her mouth agape.
before he had to brave Snape’s wrath. A minute later, he closed the office door behind him as Snape held out his hand expectantly Harry crossed the floor, taking Snape’s hand in his own firmly as a muggle would. Snape gawked back at him with an expression that bordered on bewilderment and outrage, and Harry quietly wished his face would remain stuck like that.
Hermione sighed and carefully explained, “Look, Ron told me I had been too harsh on you, and I may have chosen my wording poorly; however, I don’t believe I was wrong.”
Outside the library, the corridors were dimly and the shadows that fell across Hermione’s face, flickering suddenly along with the firelight, made her expression almost unreadable. Behind them, several students who had been forced out by Madam Pince strolled to the library’s entrance, muttered their goodbyes to the cluster of students, and continued their strolls to presumably wherever their dormitories were located. Harry's eyes flitted between the students as they did so, lingering for a moment on the ones dressed in Slytherin colours.
“Sectumsempra.”
“Yes.”
“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from somewhere out of sight, “Tell me what’s wrong... I can help you.”
For what was the first time since he has been hunting Malfoy, he wasn’t staring at the mundanely blank wall. When he dared to open his eyes, there, at last, was the door, which had evaded Harry for the past semester. Both confused and pleased, Harry wrenched open the door that led to the Room of Requirement and disappeared behind it before anyone could curiously peer down the corridor and discover the boy red-handed.
“Bring your schoolbag to my office. Now!” Harry felt his heart deflate. Snape continued, “And
“That’s where you’re wrong, Potter. You see, I, unlike you, am the one currently sitting in the Hospital Wing, because I, unlike you, am heavily mutilated, so I, unlike you, am the one who deserves the sympathy under these circumstances,” Malfoy said with a pleased look on his face.
“Of course? No? I—I don’t know,” frustrated tears threatened to escape from Malfoy’s eyes as he started up at Harry, “I just don’t…”
Then, he was drawn from his confusing reveries when with a pathetic shudder, Malfoy raised his eyes to see his reflection in the mirror that hung cracked and dirtied above the sink. Stormy grey clashed with the brilliant green eyes of their nemesis, and Harry knew that Malfoy had finally noticed his intrusive presence.
“He’s a Dark Mark,” Harry repeated slowly.
“Yes, sir,” said Harry.
“Draco, I’m just worried about you! You bloody git! You’ve looked like shit this entire term—”
“That’s—I can't believe it,” exclaimed Hermione
Ron sighed and reached over for the bag that sat at the foot of his bed. For what felt like an eternity in hell, Harry watched as Ron shuffled the insides of the bag until he finally pulled out his copy of
“It’s something I
Sleeping peacefully within the confines of their dorm rooms, students snored rather loudly, shifted about lazily in their beds, and dreamt mostly of bewildering worlds that defied the laws of physics but made perfect sense all at the same time. In the Hospital Wing, a lone boy sat up in his bed staring angrily at the floor with no one to share in his discomfort. His fingers lightly traced the newly formed scars that protruded along his body, and no matter how he loathed his marred torso Malfoy could not force himself to think of anything but the boy who left the permanent scars. Once again, the boy was reminded that he would never truly escape Harry Potter’s name, the thought of which made him want to hurl. It would still be a few long hours until Madam Pomfrey tended to him, so Malfoy could do nothing but sit and wait, wallowing in his hatred of the Chosen One although every part of himself knew
“Let’s get this over with,” Harry finally said, nodding his head towards the torch-lit corridor; to which Pansy gave him a look that gave him the impression that he were a spider that had climbed into her bedsheets, but, to Harry’s great relief, remained silent.
“During the term, I think he’s made two attempts. The first, with the cursed necklace and the second being the poisoned wine. Obviously, they were meant for Dumbledore, but both were unwittingly tampered with. I think Malfoy”s realized he can’t go through with it.”
As they parted ways, Harry found himself once again hurrying down the route which he knew would lead to the Hospital Wing. He passed where Pansy should have been waiting for him. Unsurprisingly the girl was nowhere to be seen. He was alone as he descended through the seemingly endless labyrinth of floors. While the corridors had been dimly lit when he and Hermione left the library, they were now almost completely entrenched in darkness, only ever lessened by the occasional window that allowed the moonlight to bathe everything within reach; and, Harry found as more time passed in his journey the more he looked at the windows with relief in his eyes.
Harry nodded, knowing Hermione wasn’t giving him the option to say no. As they trekked down the seven floors to the kitchen Hermione walked silently beside him, repeatedly glancing nervously at him then back to the floor. Even while Harry had never eaten that day, he did not seem to possess any sort of appetite after all that occurred, and his conversation with Malfoy following his wretched patrol accompanying Pansy had done nothing to alter this. Then again, their journey to the kitchen wasn’t exactly about getting something to eat if he were to go by Hermione’s jitteriness that reminded him somewhat of an alarm clock in the cartoons Dudley seemed to enjoy.
It was true. Tears streamed relentlessly down Harry’s face, and at that realization, Harry shielded himself with his arm and used the sleeves of his robes to wipe away any tears that persisted, which they did. Without saying anything else, Hermione pulled him into a warm hug and used her free hand to rub Harry’s back when his cries grew louder, and he began to tremble. At what, he wasn’t sure. He wasn’t the one splayed about on the tiled floor with fresh scars that marred his body. Harry despised Malfoy, but he still could not bring himself to believe that his hatred justified the harm his actions had caused.
A preliminary glance revealed the outlines of a shockingly white face, void of anything that would constitute emotion, appeared within his peripheral vision. It was as if time had slowed around that one image, and a second stretched onto eternity. There lying on the floor, almost completely shrouded in shadows, was a pale, almost blue face staring lifelessly at the ceiling. Harry snapped his head back towards the corridor, but unlike the image seared into his mind, nothing was there.
“A book. It was from the library.” Harry felt reprehensible for lying to Dumbledore of all people, but there wasn’t much he could do or say without exposing his possession of the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of
“Yeah, have a nice day!” Adalia chimed along brightly.
"But—"
“Nothing all that useful. I’m not even sure what I was looking for, admitted Hermione.”
. Understand?” snapped Malfoy, “So why don’t you just bugger off on some grand adventure and keep out of
visited Malfoy?” Hermione asked in disbelief.
remind you?” Harry narrowed his eyes at his friend who shrugged nonchalantly.
“How exactly do you expect me to go about that?” Harry sputtered, “This isn’t some sort of harmless game.”
“I’ve brought you some food,” Harry said lamely, attempting to smoother the increasingly wayward atmosphere and began to cautiously approach the other boy who seemed about ready to slug Harry until he turned black and blue and the various other shades his skin would permit.
Hermione’s eyebrows shot up, “You actually talked with him?”
“Yes, but Potter? What could you possibly want with him? He’s the reason you’re here!” At this Harry had grown ever more confused and wondered to himself if Malfoy had some sort of plan to kidnap him.
This time when Harry entered the common room only Hermione had waited up for him and he really wished she hadn’t.
“I’m not trying to kill him, I swear it,” Harry declared desperately at the same time, remembering the already spiteful rumours floating about the school.
“I have eyes, Mr. Potter, what I meant is the specific curse? Or were you not in attendance?” Pomfrey raised a questioning eyebrow, daring him to claim otherwise.
“Sessions?” Malfoy sputtered, using the distraction to subtly wipe away the tears that now stained his cheeks.
“It seems I should be asking you that question,” he responded.
He could deduce by the look on their faces that neither had believed a word he said. Harry could feel his throat drying as he searched for a sign of an indication that they might just sattle him with detention without prying for more details. He stared at Snape with desperate eyes, hoping against hope that had not seen the hesitation in hair—
“Yes, I did,” said Harry and shoved the plate out towards Malfoy.
“Then explain it to me, you twat!” Harry yelled back.
“Did you forget? You have detention and I’m a Prefect. Stupid punishment if you ask me,” snorted Ron, “Why is Dumbledore’s idea of detention is a bloody responsibility for us mature lot.”
had been his saving grace like cheats in a game, but now it felt as if an old friend had
When he found himself at the end of the corridor, the staircase stood waiting for him, and part of him silently wished that it had been busy helping some other students along. So, with a sluggish breath, Harry began his climb up the stairs, one tired step after another. Following what was simultaneously an eternity and a mere few seconds, Harry stood before the Fat Lady who stared down at him from her portrait.
, printed a dull-looking leather-bound book.
Hermione raised her head to look at whatever had caught his attention, and when she found nothing there, she hesitantly continued walking when Harry reached her. Thankfully, when they arrived at the portrait hole nothing else of significance had occurred, save for the occasional painting that hushed the pair.
And for the first time since the death of Sirius, Harry cried.
“Whatever,” muttered Harry, “As I’ve said—believe what you want.”
“Right, Professor,” Harry said with as much contempt as he could put in the last three syllables.
“And where was that, Harry?” Dumbledore spoke up for the first time since he greeted Harry.
“Oh, and the blonde one, I swear she was a second away from biting my head off for talking to the other one,” Harry chuckled at the memory.
Next to him, Hermione sighed bleakly and said, “In some aspects, our positions are fairly alike.”
“I cannot understand the house-elves any more than you can understand Draco Malfoy, “explained Hermione, gesturing towards the elves still at work, “But, I still
“No! You don’t deserve to get away with that! You go prancing around this school, Potter the hero, Potter the Chosen One, nothing
“That’s the thing,” said Harry, frustrated by his own lack of awareness, “I don’t know. In the bathroom, I wanted to be thrilled, because it was Malfoy, and he’s the one who initiated the duel, but if anything, it's exactly the opposite,” Harry rambled, not being able to contain his thoughts, “And when I visited him in the Hospital Wing—”
“Isn’t that what this was for?” Harry gestured outwardly, “To trap me into a conversation.”
“Do you now?” Malfoy said with such sarcasm that Harry would not have been surprised if venom suddenly burst from his teeth and soaked the hospital sheets draped around him so that they resembled more a toga.
“You sound like you plan to break up with me,” Malfoy deadpanned, and Harry fought back the urge to roll his eyes.
At once, ruby red ink sprung from the map’s centre to create the schizophrenic master plan of Hogwarts. Harry shuffled through the map, quickly scanning for Draco Malfoy’s identifying ink blotch. For a moment, when he failed to locate Malfoy, Harry felt certain that Malfoy currently resided in the room hidden behind the wall his back was currently pressed against; but then, his eyes finally settled on Malfoy’s dot, which resided in the boy’s laboratory, not surrounded by his usual gaggle of Slytherin lackeys, but by Moaning Myrtle.
Harry replaced his hand with his schoolbag and watched as his professor’s arm buckled slightly under its weight before he flipped the cover open and inspected the inhabitants inside. One after the other, Snape extracted Harry’s booked, examined their contents, and tossed them aside once he had ruled out its suspicion. Then, Snape pulled the last book, triumphantly looked at Harry, and returned to carefully examine Ron’s Potions book.
Suddenly, Ginny was in between the two, turning to Hermione angrily, “Sod off, Hermione! Would you rather Harry be the one lying in the hospital wing? I’m not surprised Malfoy had something horrible up his sleeve, you should be glad Harry was able to defend himself!”
Harry locked his eyes on the last few sentences he had managed to scribble out, scanning over the lines repeatedly until he abandoned his efforts to make the words registered in his mind. Instead, he lifted the quill from the place it had been resting for the past two minutes and rocked it between his figures as if considering his next words. Hermione shifted so that she was fully facing his direction, and Harry tensed, for whatever reason not ready to give the answer she was clearly expecting. He remained silent, still attempting to construct a cohesive thought, but the only thing he could accurately recall between all the harsh words, and even harsher fist that had struck his jaw, was his own anger and meagre tears that had managed to escape Malfoy’s eyes before Zabini had thankfully interrupted them.
“But you shouldn’t feel guilty about it. Without the Prince’s bezoar tip,” Ron drew his finger significantly across his throat, “I wouldn’t be here, now would I? Besides, by the sounds of it, Malfoy would’ve done worse to you, and he wouldn’t have been as mopey about it.”
Harry nodded, snatched his own schoolbag from atop his wooden trunk, and dashed back down the stairs with his bag and both copies of
“How’d
“Mister Malfoy needs bed rest,” Pomfrey shot a pointed look at Harry, “It would be the best for you both to leave for now.”
“Yes, and?” pressed Hermione.
Down the table, a few what he could only assume to be first years stared curiously at him, which he ignored in hopes to avoid another awkward encounter instead focusing wholly on the contents of his plate and how quickly he could consume them as to escape the growing number of eyes on him. Harry found himself clenching his jaw as he swallowed down his food and wondered what he should do when he finished. He could watch the rest of the match, but he was not quite sure how he would handle the disappointment in the stand if Gryffindor lost, nor the excitement from the Ravenclaw is they won. He could wait back in the dorms but figured it would risk the same problem only delayed by the time it took for the house and team to tramp upstairs. There was the Room of Requirement, which would be free from the occasional student or professor passing by, but Harry imagined a consequential nagging voice that sounded an awful lot like Hermione and decided against retrieving the Half-Blood Prince’s book.
The meaning of his words barely registered in Harry’s mind, who stood petrified at the sight of the bewildering scene set before him. It seemed unimaginable that Malfoy was crying—actually crying—with heavy tears streaming down his reddened cheeks and joining the flood of water that rose from the grimy basin. Harry wanted to laugh. Had he seen Malfoy absorbed by such anguish at any other point he would have, but standing there, watching Malfoy hurt alone, hidden away from his peers, felt painfully familiar. Normally, he would’ve taken some twisted sort of joy out of Malfoy, the boy who had harassed Harry and his friends so intensely that Dudley would’ve idolised the blond; Harry wanted to feel joy. Merlin, he wanted to sneer at Malfoy just so he could find pleasure in knowing that he could make Malfoy hurt like Malfoy had done to him all these years, but Harry was surprised when he had found no pleasure in seeing Malfoy in this pathetic broken state. In fact, a traitorous part of his mind instead urged him to comfort Malfoy and disgust settled in his throat at the mere idea, so instead he just awkwardly watched the pale body continue to sob and gulp in between pleas for some divine guidance.
With a deep sigh, Harry let the office door fall shut behind him. The hallway outside was completely empty, but that was to be expected during the final match of the term. It was odd wandering the completely empty castle, it wasn’t as if he had never walked through Hogwarts’ corridors alone; however, unlike many of his other adventures, it was daytime.
“You’ve not eaten yet?” she asked though it sounded more like a statement, “Shall we visit the kitchen?”
His tone was absent of malice. Despite his own agitation, still, Harry would describe Dumbledore’s demeanor as calm and part of him wished the expression of the ancient wizard matched his harsh words. Harry dug his thumb into the skin between the bones of his opposite wrist in a weak effort to prevent the spread of the painfully suffocating guilt that spread from his ribs that tighten and forced Harry to take tiny, tiny breaths. He hadn’t been punched, but the way his guts twisted around his stomach strained Harry’s already short breaths.
The girl shrugged, then said, “Sports, regardless if they are played by wizards or muggles, are intensely boring.”
“Why?” he croaked out after a brief silence.
“I came to return your wand,” he said in a hushed tone.
“Sorry, sir, you hadn’t clarified,” he snidely replied.
“Now that you’ve mentioned it, they did act as any other couple would,” said Harry thoughtfully.
“Harry, what’s happened?” Seamus Finnigan shouted his question over the million others, the gaggle of students asking a similar variation of Seamus’s. But Harry continued along the corridor, ignoring their questions as if they were non-existent.
“Fuck you.”
was his only hope of escape.
“You’re probably right…” Harry found himself saying, despite his conscience squirming slightly all the same.
Harry felt something flutter in his chest.
Harry coughed, trying and failing to clear the nervousness in his tone, “Yes, sir. I swear, I didn’t mean for it to happen, sir. I didn’t know...”
Falling.
Harry focused on his surroundings, trying to remember what had felt so real not even a minute. It was a nightmare that he was certain of. Glimpses of blond hair and hands around a neck flashed through his mind, but when he attempted to recall anything else the dream retreated further into his subconscious. Finally, Harry abandoned this altogether and returned his attention back to Ron who was still rambling about Prefect duties.
So, Harry wandered the corridors alone, descending through the remaining floors until he stood outside the Hospital Wing. The muted voices of Malfoy and Pansy drifted into the corridor, lingering for a moment in Harry’s ear, but his mind was still too scrambled for him to retain their meanings as if he were stuck rereading the same line in a book. Tiredly, he slumped down until he was seated against the wall outside the entrance. Across from him stood a massive arched door held up by attentively carved roman columns. During the nighttime, the door remained firmly shut and only opened when students began to pour into the Great Halls the following morning. Harry’s eyes traced the pattern in the door’s wood. The doors themselves were made from a handsome rosewood that contrasted the cream and bronze colours of the quartzite stonework.
“I’ve cursed Draco. I think he’s seriously hurt. Help him,” He frantically pleaded. Harry didn’t have to turn to know that Hermione was horrified by Harry’s claim. It was enough that she followed him silently towards the boy’s laboratory. Water almost completely engulfed the floor, glimmering lightly from the fire of the torches that lined the otherwise unoccupied corridor. As the pair trekked closer to the door, the water seemed to push against each step and splashes jumped in the air as they lifted their feet to take another.
Finally, Hermione pulled away from Harry. She seemed to have calmed down, her jaw no longer tightly clenched, and when she spoke her voice sounded almost motherly, “He needs to be treated by Madam Pomfrey,” she gestured towards Malfoy, “I’ve stopped the bleeding for now, but she would know better than I.”
! You must understand!”
“It doesn’t concern
Cautiously, Harry seized a nearby bust of an ugly warlock, whose nose was probably scattered across the floor, from a nearby crate, perched a dusty silver wig and a tarnished sapphire crown... Or was it a tiara? Atop the bust to create a distinctive marker, then sprinted back along the alleyways, nearly tripping several times over some discarded pieces of furniture or rare books that would send Hermione into a frenzy if she were to discover their post-kicked condition. When he arrived in the deserted corridor, he slammed the heavy door and checked over his shoulder to once again see a blank wall.
what had happened.
“Alright, Hermione, I’ll try. I promise you,” said Harry with a weird feeling in his gut.
you,” Harry shot her a sceptical look and Hermione amended, “Alright, well maybe I did, but Harry, I’m just really worried about, well, everything that’s happened... especially with you.”
It was no surprise when Harry got wind of the various speculative rumours concerning his relationship with Ginny Weasley. At least not after, a good number of girls had asked him directly several times over the course of breakfast, lunch, and supper; and a smaller number of boys either shot jealous looks his way or nodded their support in passing. However, he supposed his current predicament was far better than the prior gossip circulating of his involvement in the horrific scene of Dark Magic that had taken place not even a week ago Although the Slytherin students were still very much inclined to snidely remind him of Malfoy’s injuries.
“That’s my point,” said Hermione and cast
“In short, you think Malfoy is being forced into the Death Eaters by his father?” Harry concluded.
“You’re wrong,” Malfoy sneered at him, uncomfortably shifting under the bedsheets.
“Also, I’m sorry… for,” Harry gestured at Malfoy’s chest, “Yeah.”
“I tried to stop you using that bloody book! I told you something felt off about it! And I was right, wasn’t I?” exclaimed Hermione rather shrilly.
betrayed him. Regardless of his raging emotions, Harry defended himself against Hermione’s accusations, “I didn’t mean to! I wish I hadn’t hurt Malfoy, and not just because I’ve got detention until the end of term! You know I wouldn’t use a spell like that. Look, I’m sorry. I feel awful! But I was scared, and Malfoy was going to use the Cruciatus Curse. I panicked, alright? I was scared.
“This is all happening,” Malfoy gestured wildly, speaking with a frantic tilt to his voice, “Given the state of things. Muggleborns—mudbloods—are a threat to us. They always have been. There’s nothing you or any—”
Harry leapt to his feet and hastily barrelled through the corridors with his eyes still firmly glued onto Draco Malfoy’s name, only to redirect his attention when he tumbled downwards alongside an elaborate steel-plated suit of armour. The thunderous crash forced him out of his internal musing concerning the odd coupling. Scrambling to his feet, Harry fled from the corridor, leaving the crumpled mess of steel and bejewelled golden armour-plating in his wake lest Filch appeared to obstruct his investigation with the promise of detention. Harry continued down the marble staircase, almost tripping on his lengthy robes when he reached the last step but steadied himself without breaking his hefty strides towards the laboratory door.
“What?” said Malfoy, but the fear in his tone betrayed him.”
“Yes, but you've seemed to have forgotten that you, unlike me, are the one who started a duel in the first place and you, unlike me, attempted an Unforgivable Curse,” mocked Harry to which Malfoy grimaced.
Slowly, Hermione dramatically slogged across the red and golden carpet, and practically tackled one of the many vacant armchairs. Harry thought she had fallen asleep when Hermione responded, “I don’t want this war to go on forever. Pureblood families are intensely traditional, and I’ve always held the notion that people who cling so desperately to the concept of tradition are merely scared. Like many people, they’re scared because they were never exposed to anyone other than their immediate circle, and in this case it's muggleborns. Everyone else knows that blood lineage has no real impact on magical ability. And this stupid conflict continues because purebloods view muggleborns as outsiders, and muggleborns view purebloods as bigoted, which they definitely are. So, the proper way to do away with awful traditions is to show their scapegoat isn’t all that threatening. That’s why.”
“And had you not been stalking me for the entire year then maybe I wouldn’t have felt the need to use an Unforgivable Curse,” Malfoy defended.
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron’s absurdity, then panted out, “I need your book. Your Potions book. Quick... give it to me.”
“Leave!” Malfoy repeated with an ire that left no room for argument; and, so, Harry left with Malfoy’s eyes fixed on his back.
“Do you know their names?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry tried to say, but to anyone else, it sounded more like a strangled cry than anything of substance.
On the sixth floor, Pansy was leaning against the wall when Harry caught up to her, although she clearly was not pleased by their circumstances. When he stopped a foot or so from her figure, she pushed gracefully off the stone wall and joined him. A tense air fell upon the two and the only sound which could be heard was the echo of their footsteps, echoing down the long corridor. Along the walls, they passed sleeping paintings, who mostly remained asleep, while others cracked their eyes open to gaze suspiciously at the two students. Occasionally, they would pass an imposing suit of armour standing guard, but nothing out of the ordinary in such an unordinary school. Pansy was more subdued than she usually was, which Harry suspected was because she didn’t have an audience to watch as she lashed out, nor was she surrounded by the typical Slytherin cronies. Harry decided he liked her much more this way. She was certainly less irritating.
“Which, naturally, startled you into defending yourself,” inserted Dumbledore, “However, I would hope you would retain the awareness that the use of such destructive magic is impermissible. Indeed, I had hoped to impress upon you the corrupt nature of the Dark Arts.”
“No, I don’t understand, Draco!”
“What is it, Harry?”
“Hello, Potter,” the girl spoke up casually as Harry drew closer, “I suppose the rumours were true then.”
Harry wondered, mentally comparing Malfoy’s stature to his own.
“Ah, must’ve missed them all those times I slept at night. I’ll greet them next time around, if I’m awake that is,” quipped Harry to which Hermione rolled her eyes.
Hermione considered his question for a moment, then said carefully, “I don’t think a person’s attraction is something they can really
“Potter, you’ll be delighted to know—if I’m not mistaken—Gryffindor wasn’t utterly defeated,” said Zabini, flitting his eyes questionably between the two boys.
Harry slowed as they came into view of the arch-like doors that led to the hospital wing. Considering, what place within the castle might present the best hiding spot given he be flayed alive when news travelled about how “Harry Potter attacked that Malfoy boy.” He winced, knowing he was as good as dead, before advancing towards what would surely be his personal gallows.
“Funnily enough, I could have figured that much out for myself. Honestly, Harry, what’s gotten into you? Ron’s been asking after you all day,” she exclaimed, making a point to stare at him while he remained face down on the table.
. “You owe me that, at least,” joked Ron and he handed the book over.
“Does that mean...” started Ginny, still trying to catch his eyes, but Harry turned away, refusing to look at her.
“What do you want, Potter?” said Malfoy suspiciously, “Already returning to your vulgar stalking habits?”
“I wasn’t aware of…”
“So, is the match still going?”
Once again, Harry peered into the room, this time allowing himself to be seen by its inhabitants. Malfoy sat upright clearly shocked by the revelation of Harry's presence and Harry took an awkward step towards the other boy. As he drew closer, Harry could barely read fear flash through his eyes before Malfoy settled his expression into that of arrogant indifference.
“Yes.”
“And what about everyone else you’ll sacrifice for your sorry arse? Voldemort would happily kill them instead,” Malfoy flinched away, “Are they just cannon fodder?” When Malfoy remained silent with his eyes once again fixated downwards, Harry said dully, “I’m wasting my time. I should have just watched the bloody match.”
Finally, he reached the common room where Malfoy was waiting for him, devoid of any sign of physical excursion. The boy stood almost blankly, and Harry paused. He looked closely, but unlike the furniture in his room, Malfoy didn’t flicker against his backdrop. Instead, the boy seemed as if he’d been replaced with an ice sculpture, he was white, white not like snow, but as if Harry was looking at a painting where someone had taken a brush and blotted out the figure with pure white paint. Then, with sloth and mechanical motions, Malfoy drew his wand, and Harry realized why he had been in his dorm room. Harry launched forward and tackled Malfoy before he had the opportunity to curse Harry. His hands roughly clamped down on the thin neck with a python-like grip. Malfoy’s expression remained that of a statue, blank; however, he squirmed under Harry, using his hands to push at his shoulders.
“Here to finish off another member of Slytherin, Potter? Don’t think I won’t make what you’ve done to Draco look like a papercut when I’m through with you,” she sneered.
“So, help him!” Harry bellowed, throwing his hands up for emphasis.
“Anyways, let’s get going, you’re partnered with Parkinson and she’s rather nasty about, well, everything... So try to survive, yeah? Oh, and Hermione gets annoyed whenever she thinks Parkinson abuses her Prefect status, so could ya try to get her to not do that,”
“There’s less than usual,” said Harry upon fully entering the kitchens and watched as a few house elves scurry about in a frenzy, while some napped peacefully along the wales, and the rest were simply missing.
Upon their entrance, several heads looked their way, some voicing friendly greetings before returning to whatever they had been doing.
“Dumbledore can’t do anything,” his voice cracked, and Harry loosened his grip ever-so-slightly, “He’s a weak old man! You think
Most of the beds were left vacant, although there were noticeably one or two new occupants Harry had not seen before. One bed, the one he knew to be Malfoy’s, shifted slightly and a head appeared from the blankets tightly clumped together, forming a small mountain. White-blond hair that appeared otherworldly in the rouge rays of moonlight stuck out disobediently in every which direction, overshadowing heavy-lidded eyes that seemed confused by their surroundings. Despite his hair not being nearly as his own on a good day, Harry smothered the urge to laugh at his appearance.
“Why?” Harry asked anyways.
“Where is Madam Pomfrey?” asked Harry, craning his neck about.
“Still.”
A creak sounded from somewhere behind him.
“Harry,” Seamus practically yelled, waving him over to join the boys crowed around the fireplace.
“Hermione!” exclaimed Harry. He surged forward to catch her hand and pulled her up with him.
“Git,” said Hermione and he beamed at her.
“This is the Potion’s book you use in Professor Slughorn’s class, is it, Potter?”
Harry followed one of the many alleyways to his left that was marked by the bloodstained battle ax propped against an enormous stuffed troll in a pink tutu, quickening his pace so that he could find a place to conceal his own treasure without having to search the entire room to pinpoint the untrustworthy copy of
With trembling hands, Hermione pulled at her wand and began to mutter several incantations over Malfoy. The gnashes seemed to become more shallow wounds, but it wasn’t enough. Malfoy had suffered a tremendous blood loss, and despite Hermione’s impressive spellwork, Malfoy needed a more capable healer.
The pair nodded their thanks to Madam Pomfrey and shuffled to the exit.
At the last amendment, Snape perked up and a condescending smile, which resembled that of a hyena, stretched across his sallow face. A dreadful feeling settled deep in his stomach and Harry hypothesized what bothersome task Snape would conduct. Given the man’s affinity for creativity in the detentions he oversaw, something he lacked in his teaching, Harry wasn’t particularly eager to suffer Snape’s unpleasantness.
“Yes,” started Hermione, clearly annoyed, “However, it's the difference between someone who
As he rounded another corner, staring into the castle’s labyrinth, when Harry broke the silence, “I just don’t know what you want me to say…”
Realization finally hit Harry like a rocket launch and he desperately clamoured to Malfoy’s side. With shaky hands, he unbuttoned Malfoy’s once pristine dress-shirt to be confronted with deep slashes that ripped across Malfoy’s chest and abdomen as if a swordsman had ruthlessly attacked him. In a way, that
The common room was still pact full older students chatting lively with one another. Against the red and gold colours that adorn the room, a fire roared to life, which was currently being crowded around by several seventh and sixth-year boys tossing crumpled wads of parchment at each other, screeching whenever one hit its intended target. Meanwhile, girls of all years lounged in the padded couches and chairs that seemed to completely absorb the younger girls.
“They won?” said Harry with a strange mixture of excitement and embarrassment. He tugged one Malfoy’s hand still clasped in his own, and the boy stood up rather easily, only bumping Harry’s shoulder as he did so. Malfoy continued to his bed. With Harry’s eyes still on him, Malfoy sank into the bed, wrapping the already rumpled blankets around his torso. “I’ve gotta go, Harry said to no one in particular, still watching Malfoy who stared back at him, this time without the defiance he had grown accustomed to.
Pansy Parkinson had a rather unpleasant face, it wasn’t as if any of her features were particularly ugly, no, that wasn’t why, more so that she always wore a condescending expression. She had a small, upturned nose that was like a button sewn on a doll and seemed to possess a permanent sneer, making her appear more pug-like, which wasn’t helped by that fact her full lips were sure to follow suit. While her wide, deep-set eyes which currently seethe into him with undisguised hatred, matched the charcoal colour of her hair, and Harry imagined that she was stabbing him repeatedly in her head.
?” Harry frowned.
“Well, along with being his usual arsehole self, he,” Harry trailed off, choosing his next words deliberately, “I think he wants me to stop him… If that makes sense.”
Halfway up the staircase, a large explosion shook the tower, followed by both screams of terror and jeers. The latter most likely directed towards what he assumed was Seamus’s face blackened by ash. When the last shouts settled down, now completely replaced by teasing remarks, Harry resumed his climb up the tower.
“He—Malfoy seemed conflicted.”
Then, he was standing before the Hospital Wing. The field had disappeared along with the figure, replaced by the ordinary and comfortable corridors. After a deep and unsteady breath, he entered.
“S’pose those feelings are only natural,” said Harry in a rather off-handed manner, faintly recalling his uncle’s indignant rants whenever his eyes were accosted with the sight of a more feminine looking man, or his cousin’s liberal use of the words queer and bent.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” said Harry, which sent Malfoy into another fit of rage as he descended upon Harry, jabbing bony fists, elbows, and knees everywhere he could reach. Of course, Harry was a bit more prepared this time, bringing his arms up to shield his head, he kicked outwards, landing one foot in Malfoy’s stomach who groaned loudly and rolled over clutching his sides.
“I don’t think the question was all that difficult to understand. Your left arm. Show it to me.”
“And if I don’t want to?”
Harry nodded silently and a strange look passed between Dumbledore and Snape that he could not quite understand. As if unaware of the room’s tense atmosphere the portrait of Armando Dippet scorned that of Phineas Nigellus Black, who returned the insult with a rude gesture. It almost made Harry snicker, and he suddenly felt free of the oppressive weight that Dumbledore inspired.
“Yes, I do,” said Harry firmly and when Malfoy remained silent, too preoccupied with glaring glassy eyed at Harry, he continued, “Dumbledore can protect you; he can help your family. This isn’t something you
Meanwhile, sleep evaded Harry and he lay content to stare passively at the incessant lines that curved and swirled neatly within the wood covering of his four-poster bed. He had long abandoned the pursuit of sleep because the moment he forced his eyes shut his mind would force him to recount Malfoy lying unconscious in an ocean of blood creeping ever closer to Harry. Was that what war was supposed to be? Blood that poured through every crevasse sprouting into those crimson spider lilies reaching out to encompass the world. And who was he, a mere boy, to uproot those ugly flowers when he was the one responsible for their blossoming?
“Then don’t.”
“I’ve been under the impression that shrinks were a tad more subtle in their questioning.”
“Oh, my apologies,” said Malfoy in a fit of farce anger, “I was unaware we were all expected to adorn the mantel of the world’s saviour.”
“I’m sure they are,” said Harry stiffly, surprisingly making no effort to move past her.
“I don’t know. I might,” Harry said defensively, “Listen, with the Prince’s notes I’d never won the Felix Felicis. I’d never known how to save Ron from being
“Don’t scurry away just yet, Potter,” he hissed as he slowly dug his fingers into a vicelike grip, “Your pathetic attempts at playing the friend are rather insulting if you think I’d fall for them. Explain this! Explain that! I could explain all day and you still wouldn’t bloody listen.”
Harry heard the spiral staircase shift from behind as he started towards the common room, hoping to switch out of his dirtied robes and still have enough time to snatch something from the Great Hall. However, when he came upon where the castle diverged Harry paused, peering down the corridor to see a grand stairwell waiting patiently for him. He knew where it led. He could not muster any desire to return to the blood-splattered laboratory. Nonetheless, that didn’t prevent his traitorous feet from leading back to the still horrendous scene like a cruel siren’s call beckoning Harry to his downfall.
“Why don’t I believe you’ve attended my sickbed out of the kindness of your heart,” Malfoy finally said.
“Nor am I.”
The door groaned loudly, and Harry tore his attention away from the window he had been closely examining, to see a fringe of white-blond hair disappear behind the mahogany door. At first, Harry was only confused, but anger replaced that feeling almost immediately.
“No, you listen to me. You don’t have to go through with this. There’s a way out. Dumbledore—”
“And what’s that supposed to mean?” said Malfoy indignantly, refusing to let his eyes stray towards Harry’s face, and, thus, kept them fixated on the plate of food in his lap. Once again, he felt as if he were spying on Malfoy while the boy sobbed uncontrollably. Harry frowned.
Snape raised an eyebrow at that. “And why is the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?”
Ron snorted rather loudly, “Oh, that reminds me, Ginny’s been asking after you.”
business.”
“Go on, say whatever it is you’re thinking about so loudly,” he said awkwardly if only to relieve the tension that had built up in between their silence.
Harry stood frozen, unsure of what to say. Ron stared back at him with a meaningful look written across his face. Harry studied his friend’s face and cursed Hermione for possibly jinxing him.
And with that praise, Hermione beamed at Harry to which he returned a softer smile. Madam Pomfrey had once again returned her undivided attention to Malfoy’s treatment. That was most likely their queue to exit the hospital wing, but Harry and Hermione remained firmly planted in their respective locations, both watching Malfoy for any sign of improvement. Harry let out a soft sigh of relief as the blood returned to Malfoy’s face. He knew the sickly boy would survive their encounter, and that was enough to free Harry from the burden of guilt.
“Oh, I quite doubt you are, Potter,” snorted Zabini, ignoring Malfoy’s continued sputtering.
“That’s—” he paused, thoughtfully watching the elves. Occasionally, a few would raise their heads to send reproachful looks towards Hermione; despite her attempts to help them, her S.P.E.W. movement had fallen flat, not for a lack of effort, but for a lack of understanding. Instead of the obnoxiously colourful clothes, Hermione knitted in a vain attempt to free the house-elves from their bondage, they still were covered in what could barely be considered clothing. Then he glanced over to see Hermione watching the house elves rather dolefully, and it was evident to Harry that although she cared deeply for her cause, her neglect towards the desires for who she meant to represent had been the fatal flaw which shattered her plans.
“And you,” said Ginny, turning to him with a fiery scowl, “What is this about detentions?”
“It’ll most likely result in permanent scarring,” she whispered while purposefully avoiding Harry’s eyes.
As the world began to awaken with the sunrise the castle sprung to life with students pouring cheerfully into the Great Hall buzzing excitedly with anticipation for that day’s Quidditch match. When Harry arrived alongside a few other Gryffindor sixth-years who not-so-subtly ignored his presence altogether, seemingly due to his detention during the match, while a good number of Slytherins glared at him with an unrivalled fury. Word had spread quickly, and it would seem that neither Slytherins nor Gryffindors would be quick to forgive Harry, instead preferring to silently hate him in an ironic unity. The worst part was he could not blame them.
Eventually, they arrived at the boringly pleasant still-life, and Hermione stiffly tickled the pear, which more resembled clawing, but the pear transformed into the homely green handle, nonetheless. Harry supposed he could not fault a painting for accepting a liberal definition of ‘tickling,’ and followed closely behind the massive bush of hair that currently obstructed his view of the kitchen.
“I panicked—”
“Anyways, I might have suggested that Malfoy had replaced his father as a Death Eater to which he obviously denied; and I remembered when Madam Malkin tried to touch his arm, so I told him to prove me wrong. We got into a bit of a scrap—oh, don’t give me that look—and I yanked up his sleeve and he, erm, seems to have been branded with the Dark Mark.”
“Then
Hermione paused for a moment, then hesitantly said, “How am I supposed to know if you’ll even listen to me?”
“No, no, no, no, no, no,” Harry weakly murmured, brushing a deathly white strand of hair from Malfoy’s equally sickly face. “I didn’t mean to... I didn’t know.”
“Alright then,” said Ron, eyeing the three like he had expected for a duel to commence at any second, “Try to save your fists fights until we’ve a big enough audience to wager… Though, s’pose with my lucky streak, I’d probably lose a few galleons by myself,” he rambled on, thoughtfully, “So, best separate ‘fore that happens.”
Madam Pomfrey glanced up from where she and Hermione had been standing and fixed him with an icy stare. She lifted the skirt of her burgundy healer’s uniform and hurried over to Harry and usher him towards a freshly made bed further from the door.
“What do you think—? Nevermind! The ponce wants you for whatever bloody reason!” she practically yelled at him and resumed her furious march past him.
will talk, and
Harry spun around, shoving the Hawthorne wand in his robe pocket, and drawing his own. A flash of red hair caught his eye, and Harry felt his heart sputter to a halt, then pick-up a normal rate as his arm fell to his side.
After thirty minutes of Harry scribbling out what vaguely resembled a Herbology essay and staring blankly at the bookshelves across from him whenever he could not think of what words to scribble next, Hermione closed her book with a notable thud and Harry glanced sideways to see
Draco?”
The house-elves that had been frantically rummaging through the kitchen cautiously approached the pair with treys packed mostly with fruits and whatever else took minimal effort to prepare, which Harry scooped up and nodded to the house elves in thanks. Appeased, the house-elves returned to their original duties at a somewhat slower pace, but still glancing at Hermione suspiciously most likely due to her affiliation with S.P.E.W.
With that, Hermione shifted to face him. She looked absolutely drained, even her lively hair seemed to have deflated, possibly from the sweat that beaded her forehead. Still, she sighed and methodically stood to face Harry, “You’re crying.”
“Then why are you here?” Harry asked, confused as to why anyone would purposely skip their own house’s quidditch match.
“The truth,” said Malfoy suddenly and Harry felt as he had been struck across the face.
He tore his gaze away from the scars and focused on Hermione, who still sat leaning over Malfoy and inspecting her work. Harry slowly trudged towards her and rested his hand on her shoulder in a silent ‘thank you,’ She must’ve heard him, there was no way she could not with the way the water shifted and crashed back down after every step, but she still flinched at his touch.
Harry nodded and stood to follow Ron.
And Harry Potter, similarly to Draco Malfoy, was often guilty of the crime of ignorance.
in tow. Several students raised their heads to watch Harry barge into the common room and threw himself out the portrait hole, all in the time that they formed obnoxious questions that sat at the tips of their tongues. However, Harry was already hurtling down the seven-floor corridor before any of them had managed to voice their questions.
