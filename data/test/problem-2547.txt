"What do you mean their sign on you and marking?" Harridan said finding himself able to speak at last with the pair of Dominant Veelas calming down.
"I have not, at least I don't think I have," Harry answered.
"Well normally no for while it is called a Life Debt there is no way to claim the "debt." It just means you are connected to certain people, though if Heir Malfoy here is one that owes you a Life Debt it will create a strong bond between you two," Bonecrusher explained.
"Madam Burbage is correct," Bonecrusher said, "though there are sometimes when the ritual is used when a family member gives the artifact out to pay for some depts and the person they lend it to does not hand it back after the debt is repaid. As soon we are done here and contact Lady Baddling we shall perform the ritual."
"That is another thing it seems that young Miss Hermione came to Hogwarts under an assumed name for her results showed that she had a Glamour placed on her from her mother who is Dolores Umbridge," he explained. Hearing this a look of shock comes to everyone's faces as even Minerva votes to expel the girl for her actions. Having reached a unanimous decision Drake uses his position to summon Hermione Umbridge right to them as well as the girl's mother. As this was being done Severus adjust his Prince Lordship ring activating the Porktey and hopefully sending the boys to Gringotts to get a full Cleaninsing if not more.
Not trusting Dumbles to not read his mail he handed it to Draco knowing that his mate would have some way to get the letter to his father. Thinking of special treatment he also decided to talk to Snape since due to the gather notes on the Family Tree Potions everyone and not just his and Draco's allies knew they were parent and child. Though Snape's behavior to him in the class had not really changed he did not want Dumbles or someone to claim the Potion Master was misusing his position. Having a free period after lunch he sent Snape a message to see if he had some free time to talk with him, receiving a response back after his first-class that he free Harridan told Draco he would be spending his break with the man.
There was silence between Granger, Draco, and Longbottom as they got Potter upright and secured between Granger and Longbottom's shoulders, Draco still being too weak at the moment to do the job of carrying the unconscious boy as he limped after the group. Once they reached the Hogwarts grounds proper Draco saw Hagrid drop his crossbow and pull out a large pink umbrella, the oaf sent Draco a look before he aimed the umbrella at the castle and cast a spell that shot a white orb to one of the towers. "Well just wait here," the oaf said keeping a firm grip on Quirell.
"That sounds promising," Pamona said whose classwork mostly was done in groups, and even with the smaller class size than when she started, she had a hard time making sure the students did equal work. "I second the idea," she said.
"Nothing, normally, but you just brought a new Dominant Veela into the mix and by the look of it Harridan and Draco have not finished bonding yet," the girl said standing on her tiptoes to smack the back of both their heads.
Rather than going around smelling everyone in the library Draco quickly headed out of the room to spend some time with his friends enjoying the good weather before lunch. After a while, Draco noticed that some students had decided to spend their free time in a pick-up game of Quidditch. Seeing it as a way to take his mind off the new scent he was smelling around the castle; Draco decided to join in the game. Since the game was just for fun Draco was able to play his preferred position, Chaser. Also, since everyone was playing for fun they were not playing their standard teams leading him to, unfortunately, be on the same team as Potter, some Ravenclaw Beaters, Wood from Gryffindor as Keeper, and a Hufflepuff and one of his normal teammates as his fellow Chasers.
"Well Bill and Charlie I don't see you really interacting with and they have no feelings one way or another about you. Mr. Weasley is Mr. Wealsey he is not one to lie or act differently than he seems, his wife on the other hand is the one who wants to help Ginny brew the love potions to give to you. Fred and George are more interested in pranks and Quidditch than really anything, though they are smarter than they act. Having sussed out my real nature rather than the carefree dreamer I pretend to be. They also confessed to me as a way to pay back of seeing my true self that they are in fact both Aromatic Asexuals. Now, Percy is rather ambitious but is overall a decent fellow, quite unlike your friend Ron who is actually rather lazy and is rather selfish is more interested in your fame and money than you as a friend. He also seems to be involved in the plot to give you Love Potions being the one who will dose your food and drink when they decided to start doing it," Luna said making Harry's heart sink at what his best friend was really was like if Luna could be believed.
"I am guessing he did not give any specifics?" Charity asked.
"I am sure I can handle it," Dumbledore said with his Grandfatherly smile in place yet some strain showing in his eyes.
"Hello Gred and Forge glad you could make it," Harridan said dropping Neville's hand leaving the other boy to stand awkwardly before the two couches. Harridan pulls the twins into tight hugs as the last two guests arrive.
"Well and at the end of the last school year when I witnessed the Dark Lord rise again your father arrived to greet him," Harry said.
"Yes the pillows in this place are fantastic, very comfortable,' Harridan said as he snuggled into Draco's body producing a chuckle from his Mate.
"I'm a Veela?" Harry asked in shock,
on the top of his paper. "I can see some of you might be shocked by your grades this time around. During a meeting last night among the Head of Houses we have decided to start using a spell that will show how much work you put into your homework. This should not be a problem if you work alone, but if you are paring up with someone the spell will also keep track of how much effort you put into it. I had been shocked to find that one student had basically let another do almost their entire assignment, but what was worse the person who had helped them had filled it out with incorrect information, Due to this both students have had penalties added to their work earning a grade all of us Heads of House have agreed such an assignment deserves," Professor Flitwick informed them all making Harry do his best not to smirk at Hermione and Ron knowing the story had been about them and if what Professor Flitwick said was true the pair were about to find their GPA and rankings taking a nosedive with the assignments they had already turned into for grading. Harry hoped that Ron would now have an issue with Hermione doing his work for him especially as they had all been told that Hermione had basically turned in a paper filled with incorrect information. But seeing the expression on the redhead's face Harry thought it would have the same effect as when he had told Ron what Hermione was doing.
After Draco sent the letter he went in search of his other cousin who was attending Hogwarts. Luna was not that hard to find as she tended to hang out in a set number of locations. Thankfully he found she was not spending the morning in the forest for after the detention in his First Year he avoided the place as much as he possibly could.
"What treat you less like a Prince and more like a normal person for once," Goyle joked.
"Why what spell was it?" Granger grunted as she and Longbottom gently placed Potter onto the ground in a seated position,
"Yeah he took it a little hard to find out he had been sleeping with the man for years evidently Dumbles did not decide to let him know about that little detail.  Though I have wondered why neither of you noticed him on the map?" Harridan asked turning to the twins.
"I agree with your setting up a meeting with him then, for this plan can not move forward without me getting to know him. Do you think I should meet him in my mask or without?" she asked.
"Yes I do, you have been nothing but kind and caring for me despite our history," Harridan said snuggling up closer to the taller blonde boy. Draco smiled down at Harridan his heart soaring at the pronouncement.
"Thank you, Professor...." Harry said but had no idea who she was.
"Pansy be nice," Draco said as he rubbed his mate's back.
"What is it, Severus?" Minerva asked as Severus tried not to grit his teeth at the witch. For while she was a good teacher, the fact that she had basically ignored James, Sirius, Remus bullying him when he was a student, and now had no issue with him "bullying" Potter, and Longbottom just due to it being under Albus's orders.
"Let's see," Draco's father said pulling out a couple of rolls of parchment. "From the letters I received early this morning, you focused on one student who at the time could not be healed while leaving another who you could heal."
"That is the strange thing it listed him as only having Dad and Papa as his parents," Fred said shocking Harridan a little as he spoke out of turn.
"And her husband is just as bad," Draco said rolling his neck as he goes to take a seat in his favorite leather back chair in front of the fire.
The next issue saw Severus, Narcissa, and Lupin being officially brought in to cast the votes for Gryffindor, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. Knowing that he would be unable to vote as Slytherin Head of House and Gryffindor Severus beforehand had contacted Septima Vector, who taught Arithmancy and had been a Slytherin in her time as a student, to take his place in voting for the Head of House. Albus could only grumble under his breath as the four were sworn into their new roles on the board before Minerva asked if there was any new business. Severus immediately called for the re-installment of the Apprenticeship Program, and while Albus tried to veto it he could not overturn the Founder's vote and was quickly vetoed himself. Next to his shock, Remus called forth having the Goblins come check out both Hogwarts' Wards but also Professor Binns.
"Than I shall inform you that no punishment could be caused by you refusing to shake my hand since it happened during our second meeting. Now if you had refused to shake my hand if our first meeting at Madam Malkins if we learned each other's names it would be considered a slight to my House. But as I had not given my name at that meeting and had started to spout out my views without knowing any of your views it would be you that could have taken a slight at my actions," Draco explained.
"Alright Professor," Harry said as he and Draco followed her to the other Champions who had been seated next to the door. Harry took in Cedric Diggory with his date Cho Chang giving him and Draco matching shocked expressions on their faces. While Fleur and her date, Roger Davis, did not seem to notice mostly due to Roger seeming to be unable to look away from the part Veela girl. But Harry's eyes could only look in shock as he found Viktor Krum and his date, Hermione. Harry had to guess that he and his best female friend shared the same shocked expressions at each other's dates.
"So that is the reason for his change this year," she said.
After Harry had drunk all his first round of inoculation potions the person who had been treating Draco, having found out they were called Healers, not Doctors, had finished and the other boy was to be returned to Hogwarts. Harry felt a small pang at the news, he had felt it was because once Draco had gone he would be alone in the Ward, but as Draco Flooed back to the castle Harry actually passed out. Narcissa, who had been the person treating him the whole time he was there, began to worry that he was suffering an aftereffect from his earlier Magical Coma and tried everything she could to wake him back up.
"Dear Merlin," she said and without another word let go of his arm and ran from the Ward causing the other Healers and her husband to look at the closing doors with a look of shock and confusion. Narcissa let go all thoughts of proper protocol leave her mind as she ran from the room and to the nearest fireplace. She did not even stop as she lit a fire in the grate and threw some Floo Powder into the newly created flames calling out her destination.
One of the best things about Hermione not sharing who she was going to the Ball with was that it distracted Ron from trying to find out who Harry was going with to the Ball as well. Harry did notice that just like him on the actual day of the ball Hermione also had left early to get ready for the ball. Leaving the snowball fight that Harry and the Weasleys had been having on the grounds. Not wanting to been seen in his dress robes before the event Harry carried them in a bundle as he made his way to the empty classroom where he was to meet Draco. "Good your early," Draco said as Harry walked into the room. "I take it those are your dress robes lets see them." Taking them from the bundle Harry held the dark forest green robes and held them to his body. "That should be easy to work with," Draco said taking out his wand and summoning a dark yellow dress robe. "Alright sit down Harry lets see if I can tame your hair," Draco ordered.
"That's my Papa," Draco said sitting down at the table as Tom gave him and Harridan a knowing smile making Harridan blush a little.
Professor Dumbledore then took out his wand and cast a Diagnostic Charm on Quirrell. "Madam Pomfrey a second opinion if you would?" Professor Dumbledore asked as he looked over Quirrell's results. The Medi-Witch did as asked as she cast a spell on her passed-out co-worker.
"Only if you really want to," Draco said. Harry gave him a small nod as he began to tell the blonde about his life with the Dursleys and feeling Draco's body tense up at their treatment of him for some reason telling him some stories that he had never even shared with Hermione or Ron. "You must get away from there Blue Jay I do not care if they are your family no one should be treated like that," Draco said hugging Harry all the tighter as if wanting to be there and protect him in person.
"Than who was it?" Harridan had asked not yet fully comfortable with the man yet.
"Yes my son it seems was under several Potions and enchantments, and since we are currently bringing charges against the guilty parties," Severus said glaring at Albus "I can not and will not say anything more about it."
"Well more like one part of the session," Draco admitted shifting his gaze since he still could not move his body.
"But how, though?" Narcissa asked. "I know our Dragon is talented but to be able to throw off enchantments while you had not been able to do with your skill in such things."
"What the hell Potter?" Draco asked after looking over several pages.
"While it was shown that the bitch had put some memory charms us as well as blood adopting us."
"Well as in your memories with Draco you saw you could do things right with the right technique so I think what I plan to do with show you the other side. I take it you know a shield charm?" Snape asked.
," Draco growls as he glares at the other Dominant Veela which is too close to his Mate. The twins look between Draco and Fleur in confusion as the other girl shakes her head at them.
"It seems according to the results of the Charm Quirinus is giving off two life signs his own and someone named Tom Riddle," Madam Pomfrey said.
"Did you now?  Have you told anyone of this yet?" she asked.
"Well, you are not too bad when you are not acting, like a massive prick. Let's play it by ear," Harry said.
"We have a problem," Severus said shocking his fellow Head as he spoke as soon as he sat down.
"So my Blue Jay tell me more about you how is life with the Muggles you live with? Draco asked
Harry was amazed at the book which began to tell about the different way to prepare ingredients and why it was important to be precise in their prep. Giving an example of cutting up dandelion roots where if it was cut lengthwise the roots would cause a Potion to bond quicker while if diced would make it simmer and could ruin the Potion. "Okay so not having this book might have been one of your problems in brewing can I see your actual homework?" Draco asked after letting Harry read a few pages. Not wanting his rival to see his current assignments Harry pulled out some of his previous assignments, that he had put in his backpack incase the tutor had wanted to go over his old work. Taking the pile of Potions homework for the past four years Draco began to go over them letting Harry go back to the book.
"Well, to be honest, you might be. I have not had a chance to go through the whole list of stuff that had printed out from my earlier spell. But the test I am speaking of is one administered by the Goblins which might show the reason for your Magical Coma," Mr. Malfoy said. "And since you say you were brought up by your mother's sister this test would also be a way to find out a little about your Magical family as well," he said as he led Harry and Draco out of the small room they were into letting Harry see the counter that he had first seen on his birthday months ago with the Goblins still working at counting gold and jewels as if no time had passed. The three of them stood in line for a bit before a Goblin became available.
"We all know Mr. Krum had been put under the Imperious Spell from Barty Crouch Jr. Lucius what is your point?" Albus asked.
"Oh come off it Draco this is not how this usually goes usually I insult you you insult me we almost come to blows and then we kiss," Harry said with a slight blush.
"Wait? What?" Charity asked standing up and bending over the table with her hands pressed hard onto the surface to help ground herself.
"But I am afraid you are mistaken I am not Lord Prince my Grandfather cast both me and my mother from the family when I was still a student at Hogwarts."
"Let's see... think of it as one of the Muggle Deities.  Lady Magic is said to be a supreme being for all things Magical and she is said to work with others representing Death, Time, Nature or the Earth itself, Destiney sometimes called Fate, and some believe there is one that stands for Life as well," Charity said and sees the Goblin Healer give a small nod.
"I hate to ask but do you know anything about Hermione?" he asked fighting down a lump in his throat which had for once nothing to do with the girl's scent.
Harry screamed out as the hand moved into his head feeling as if he was losing himself. Then suddenly it all stopped. Harry whose eyes had been closed due to the pain had opened them only to see a startling vision of Draco Malfoy looking as if he was an angel all in white and glowing holding onto Normal Quirrel's hand. Even though Draco was the same size he always was and the Quirrells in Harry's mind were larger than normal Draco had no problem pulling the hand out of Harry's head. This strange vision of Draco had even managed to do it one-handed. Draco easily kept hold of Normal Quirrell's huge hand despite the other's struggling before the blonde sent Harry a smile and a wink. As Draco winked at him normal Quirrell vanished into a puff of smoke. Draco then cracked his knuckles before waving one of his hands causing the Quirrell copies to puff out as well.
"We believe it is the only way to prove to these to that we are not related to them," the twins said once more in unison.
Once more there was a little over a week before he had another dream with Draco this time Harry actually went right into Draco's arms. "Hello, Blue Jay miss me?" Draco chuckled
"No," Harry said as the third group went up to cast the spell.
"Thank you Silverwing," Bonecrusher said taking the packet and giving it a cursory look before placing it in a pile of other documents on his desk.  "Hello, again Heir Potter.  My name is Bonecrusher and I and my ancestors have been in charge of your accounts since their creation," the well-dressed Goblin said holding out a hand to shake Harry's with.
"Sure thing," Luna said airily as she snapped the book shut and handed it over. Pansy grabbed the book and pulled it towards her chest, only to find Luna had not let go causing her to pull the younger girl onto her lap. "I knew that would work," Luna said as she shocked Pansy when she made no move to get up.
"What's wrong with Percy's results?" Harridan asked concerned for the former Headboy.
"Yes I am a girl well spotted Ron but no," Hermione said.
"From what I read it is a signal of the presence of a Life Debt. You saving Harry's life from Quirrell connected you," Granger said.
"Where is that?" Harry asked having never known that the Hogwarts library had one.
"What makes you say that?" Ron asked.
Thankfully both of them signed their approval leading Bonecrusher to take him to the appropriate Ritual room leaving the pair behind. "Not to be rude but what would have happened if they had not agreed to have me take part in the ritual?" Harry asked.
"Not technically true, you passed out," Draco said though Harry thought he detected some good humor in the other's voice, not scorn or ridicule.
"Are you sure he was being truthful about that?" Bathsheda asked.
"Yes it is sir," Harry said, "is there something wrong Hagrid did not let me know of anything being missing."
"Why what is wrong with that?" Fred asked.
"What?" Harry asked slightly confused.
"Mr. Potter stop right there," Madam Pomfrey said pushing him back into bed.
When he was finished with his trunk Harrison left the rooms, but not before silently casting a spell Draco had told him about during their earlier meeting that would track if anyone but him entered his trunk. He then left down to the Broomstorage shed and collected his Firebolt to bring it up and store in the special compartment of his trunk that Professor McGonagall had added to it at the end of his First-Year so he could safely bring his Nimbus 2000 to the Dursleys without Muggles wondering why he was traveling with a broom or his family from forcing him to use it to clean their house.* On his way back to Gryffindor Tower with his Firebolt Harrison stopped at the Owlery to pick up Hedwig's cage so he could clean it a little before she would use it again. As he was lifting the cage from his spot Pansy walked in giving him a small nod but otherwise ignoring him.
Changing the Patronus cast by some characters to work better with the narrative.
"Thank you for sharing this with me," Harry said giving the Goblin a small nod of his neck.
"My Aunt and Uncle hate all forms of magic.  Even the street magic Muggles use like card tricks and have shown their dislike of me being Magical by treating me the same way Dobby told me he was treated by your family when I meet him," Harry said a hint of accusation in his tone.  Draco did not really know how to respond to that recalling the odd elf who thanks to an attack from his Aunt Bellatrix had gone slightly mad.  The whole of his family tried to leave the Elf alone only giving him the simplest orders but still found him "punishing" himself in horrible ways.
As he finished speaking the there was the sound of people Apparating in as the old bylaw forced the members of the board to appear unless they were sick or going to the bathroom bringing them in even though the normal Anti-Apparition Wards around the castle. The two other Heads of House and the six parents that made up the school board looked shocked to find themselves standing in the hallway outside the Transfiguration classroom. Drake Vansel, the current leader of the board was the first to collect himself to ask what was going on. " I am sorry for calling you all in but I think we need to discuss the expulsion of a student," Severus told them all.
"I would normally say yes, it would be a student to determine if they are turning in their work using proper sources rather than trust their fellow students. But I think using the Tracking Spell will help this, but it will also show that if students work together in either homework or class projects are doing the same amount of work so that we can grade them appropriately," Severus explained.
"That would be the nicest thing they would do.  Though there is a slight chance of them taking advantage of me during a Heat and having me be willing for once," Harry said.
"You can wait, Pansy." Hermione says. Pansy relaxes again, pushing Hermione's finger closer to her. Hermione can feel how wet she is, even without putting her finger inside of her. She slowly slips her finger in, Pansy moaning. Hermione pushes her finger all the way in, up to her knuckle. She starts curling and uncurling her finger, feeling every ridge inside Pansy. In response to that, Pansy pushes her hips towards Hermione. Hermione smirks and curls it faster, Pansy moaning in the background. She can feel Pansy loosening inside of her, knowing she's close. Hermione begins fingering her faster. Pansy feels a wave wash over her, tightening onto Hermione's fingers. Hermione smiles, then starts kissing her. Pansy unexpectedly flips her over, so that she's on top of Hermione. Pansy kisses Hermione passionately, playing with her clit. Hermione moans into Pansy's mouth, making her laugh. Pansy takes her hand away from her clit, pushing two of her fingers into Hermione. She moans loudly, making sure Pansy can hear her. Pansy takes her fingers deeper into Hermione, curling and uncurling them quickly. Hermione feels a tightening in her stomach, but Pansy pulls her fingers out. Pansy then slips Hermione's panties off and gets down on her knees. Hermione then suddenly feels Pansy's cold tongue slip inside of her, making her shudder. Pansy's tongue flicks in and out, to Hermione's pleasure. Pansy's free hand plays with her clit, bringing Hermione closer to her high. Hermione then feels relief wash over her, then kisses Pansy gently. They curl up in Pansy's bed, holding each other close.
"Pansy! Can you tell that I don't want to tell you what's wrong?" You scream, making sure she hears you. She stops in her tracks, a few feet away from you. "I don't want you to know! I don't want to tell you! Just leave me alone!" You shout, running in the opposite direction. She runs after you.
"I love you too, Pansy."
"Pansy." You say, her letting go. She looks worried. You take her hand and hold it, nodding.
"That one is quite difficult." She says, flicking her wand out. "But don't worry, I'll help." She says with a smile. Pansy rolls her eyes.
"Let's finish this in your dormitory." She says, whisking Pansy away. Pansy leads her in the correct direction of the dorms, making sure they don't get lost. Once they get there, Pansy locks the door to the dorm. There's no one in there but them.
"Or did I." She says, pulling Hermione into a deep kiss. Pansy wraps her hands around Hermione's dark curly locks, her hands getting tangled in them. Hermione can barely grab Pansy's jet black bob, but manages to do so. Pansy pulls away. "You taste amazing." She says to Hermione, who is left breathless. Pansy watches a blush form on Hermione's dark skin. Suddenly, Hermione has an idea.
"'Mione?" Pansy says. Hermione turns her head towards hers
"Why do you care about her so much? She's just a stupid lesbian who's in love with you." He says through his laughter. Pansy is filled with rage as she tries to calm herself, trying to use her words to fight rather than her fists, like you taught her.
"She will be here overnight, Ms Parkinson. In the meantime, I suggest you go get some rest." Madam Pomfrey tells her, patting her on the shoulder. Professor McGonagall walks up to Pansy.
"You wouldn't stop talking. That's the only thing that would've worked." You say, her laughing in response. She kissed your forehead and sits there with you. McGonagall walks up to the pair of you, headed for Pansy. She doesn't leave your side.
"Wait what is the incantation again?" She asks Hermione for the thousandth time. Hermione rolls her eyes, pointing to it again.
"Wait!" She shouts, but you ignore her. She stops running and watches you keep going, running up the stairs. She turns back around and walks to her dormitory, crying. She doesn't know what's she's done wrong, she just wanted to help.
"I hope you'd help me, that's what we're here for." Pansy whispers, taking out her wand. Hermione doesn't even look at the book as she casts the spell.
"Let's go, Hermione." She says, letting her robe pool at her feet. Hermione does the same, but then slowly starts unbuttoning her white shirt. She is now standing in her bra, skirt, and socks, walking over to Pansy. Hermione slowly unbuttons Pansy's white shirt, letting it fall to the ground. To her amusement, Pansy's bra is lacy, a fancy one at that. Hermione unclips it from the front, dropping it at their side. She slowly starts rubbing her fingers over Pansy's breast, avoiding her nipple. Pansy sighs heavily, waiting for Hermione. She then reaches around and unclips Hermione's bra, letting it do the same. Hermione then takes her hand away from Pansy's breast, sitting Pansy on the bed. Hermione straddles her, sucking on her nipple and flicking it with her tongue. Pansy moans quietly, egging Hermione on. She moves from her breast to her mouth, kissing her passionately. Pansy slips off Hermione's skirt, leaving her in her panties and socks. Pansy then starts sucking on Hermione's nipple, playing with the other one in her fingers. Hermione moans even louder, making Pansy laugh. Hermione takes off Pansy's skirt, touching her from the outside of her panties. Hermione lays Pansy down on the bed, slipping her fingers into her panties, rubbing her clit. Pansy moans, and Hermione takes her finger off and puts it by Pansy's entrance, teasing her.
"I love you too."
"What's wrong?" She asks you. You turn away from her, too embarrassed to say anything. She grips your shoulder and turns you back around to face her. She finally sees the dried tears on your cheeks, and her shoulders drop. Her face turns sad, sullen even. "You can tell me-" She begins, but you escape her grip and storm out, not sure where you're headed. She tries to follow you, but you don't let that happen.
"Why do you help her? I thought we were friends!" Draco shouts, spitting at Pansy. She gets even angrier and looks like she wants to tackle him, but realizes she can't, for she has to protect you. She holds you closer, trying to keep you as far away from Draco as possible.
"Forever for you is like 20 minutes, 'Mione." Pansy says with some frustration. Hermione signs, putting her forehead to the desk. Pansy keeps studying. "Apugno is the one where the birds attack people, right?" She asks, and Hermione shoots up. She has a huge smile on her face.
"Hey Pans." You say, and she starts sobbing. Draco gets back up from the floor that Pansy pushed him down on, coming face to face with her.
"I'm so glad you're alright. I don't know what I'd do if-" She says, and you stop her by kissing her on the lips. She kisses you back, but it's gentle. It stays very light and sweet as you pull away, looking at her confused face. You smirk.
You sat on the floor of the corridor, almost drowning in your own tears. You sobbed, every part of your body hurting. You tried to forget what happened, but you couldn't, for it happened every single day. Every. Single. Day. You saw someone coming from the other direction and you got up and ran. You went to your dormitory in the dungeons, trying to smother your cries in the sheets of your four poster bed. You heard a knock at your door. You walked over, wrapped in a blanket, and opened the door. It was Pansy Parkinson. You have had a crush on her since second year, which is the reason you get bullied. Draco and his goonies know you're gay, saying that you're a disgrace to the Slytherin name. Which is weird, since you could've sworn that Harry and Draco had something going on between the two of them. You went to shut the door, but she pushed it back open. You stood there, staring at her beautiful features. Her jet black hair that comes just below her chin, accompanied with a fringe that's so hot you may need to throw water over yourself. Her hazel-green eyes looking into your soul, they almost seem sad. You snap out of it and walk over to your bed. She follows, putting a hand on your shoulder.
"And you won't have to worry, I am going to talk to Draco and Professor Snape right away." She says, rushing off to get them. Madam Pomfrey leads Pansy back to her dormitory, making sure she's alright for now. Pansy sits on her bed, drawing the curtains. She begins to sob after casting a silencing charm. She can't sleep, for she needs to know if you're alright.
"So what if she's in love with me? What does that matter to you?" She says, picking you back up. "And for the record, I happen to be a stupid lesbian who's in love with her right back, Malfoy!" She shouts, running to the Hospital Wing. When she gets there, she is out of breath. Madam Pomfrey rushes up to her in confusion.
Pansy and Hermione have never been the best of friends, but still enjoyed the other's company. They sat together in the library, studying for the upcoming Charms exam. Pansy was having a bit of trouble.
"We are not friends anymore, Draco Malfoy! Bullying an innocent girl, and my friend, is unacceptable!" She shouts, Draco growing frustrated. He pulls you back to the ground, out of Pansy's arms. You fall hard, and hit your head. Pansy tries to shake you awake, but you're unconscious. Draco laughs.
"First off he was not a student when I put those blocks on him, which as I am his Magical Guardian was my right, but it was all done for the greater good," Albus said through gritted teeth.
"I don't have my own place, having taken up residence at the castle since I started teaching," Charity said rubbing the back of her neck.
"Well that is your right," McGonagall said before turning back to the rest of the board. "Hearing all this evidence that shows that Miss Granger-Dumbledore has been receiving special treatment I think the call for a vote to reduce her classes to just the normal core group with no electives detentions until class returns from the Yule break any seconds?" she asked
"That is good to know but I would not be just anyone's pillow only yours," Draco said giving him another kiss on his forehead. "Now, unfortunately, I have something that will ruin your mood," Draco said pulling out a page of the Audit of Harridan's Vaults which listed all strange activities or payments not approved by Harridan himself. Harridan skipped over some which were the payments for his school supplies while he read the others getting angrier and angrier as he went down the parchment.
"We wanted to speak to you about giving all the Muggleborn students a barebones Inheritance test so that we may see if they come from Squib lines or just new Magicals," McGonagall stated.
"Well during the time Ron and I were preparing your ingredients while you were in the cast and we did not take care to properly prepare them," Harry said.
"Just knock at the door with our feathered friend on my shoulder and ask to see Harry just to find out how they react," Charity said as she walked around to the front of the house and saw her guess had been right as she spotted the large number 4 on the door.
"I see no problem with it since no private information will be exchanged and he is your mate," Snape said.
"He had been missing over ten secondary, and two primary books for his subjects, and three secondary books dealing with Latin, how to write with a quill, as well as the book on protocol," Lucius said glaring at the Headmaster. "I have also learned a little more since my message to you earlier Drake. Wanting to find out what had lead to Harry slipping into a coma I took him to Gringotts to get him tested." Draco took great pleasure seeing the Headmaster gulp at this bit of news. "We found out that not only did Harry not get tested when he first came to the bank, after being so long away from the main public eye of the Magical World. Harry had a Horcrux attached to his very soul, I was listed as one of his Godfathers, but even more distressing was the fact that you Albus Dumbledore had placed blocks on his magic, skills and even stole from him.
"It is alright Nev," Harridan said as he grabbed the taller boy's hand and pulled him over. "I want to introduce you to my Mate," he said making both Pansy and Neville's mouths fall open in shock.
"Of course we have met young Heir. I helped your parents set up your Heir Vault shortly after your birth. I am Bonecrusher your family's account manager," the Goblin said getting out of his seat and bowing to Harry as Mr. Malfoy let out a small gasp knowing that Bonecrusher was the Prince of the Goblin Kingdon for all of Europe.
* listed as when it was the first cast not on the most recent cast hence why a spell that included Hermione was listed as the second item.
"She is my Great-Great-Aunt on my mother's side why do you ask?" Draco asked using his wand to attach the medallion he had been working on to the newly awaken Omega's right lapel.
"There is one way to find out if Papa's Soul connected us my Blue Jay," Draco said nuzzling the top of Harry's head with his chin feeling honored that Harry would be willing to deal with the pain to remain his mate.
Harry turned and pressed his left palm to the Alpha's cheek.  "Draco, I am not even fourteen yet and you can't be that much older I don't think we could do it. But thanks anyway," Harry said.
"Let's see if I can explain this properly. Most Magicals are considered truly adults when they reached the age of seventeen, however, a person who gains a secondary gender also considers adult so it is already could be considered a holiday for you but to keep the fact that you have gone through the change a Name Day celebration sounds believable," Luna said.
"You managed to handle yourself very well Cursebreaker William, but are you sure are willing to undertake your current assignment. Many of us would perfectly understand if you choose to turn it down?" Grindstone asked.
"Surely not," all but Draco called out at his pronouncement.  Draco could tell, by the newly awaken Omega's scent alone, that Harry was telling the truth.
"Sometime before we go back to Hogwarts I am taking you shopping for your own clothing Blue Jay, but until then I have some old clothing that I am sure that would fit you if that is alright," Draco said joining Harridan on the bed as he glared at the Muggle clothes.
"You do some good work," Luna said making Pansy blush a little. While her friends knew about her book, due to using it freely she had never really let anyone look through it before except her parents.
"Why would the Hogwarts library have a book on my family? Does it have books on all Pureblood families?" Harry asked as Draco left them alone.
On the night of his first tutoring session, he felt his hopes plummet as he saw the person tutoring in Potions was none other than his rival Draco Malfoy. "You can't tell me you need more help Potty. Word around the castle is that Professor Snape broke his own rules of giving special lessons to help you," Draco said.
"Unless you wish to skip breakfast I would suggest you pick this up later. I would suggest you go, for if you had recently gone through the change your body will need it," she suggested.
Pulling his arm out of Lucius's grip Harry ran to Draco and tucked himself into the startled Dominant Veela's arms. "Blue Jay?" the blonde asked.
Harry received a return letter from Ron on his second full day of Quarantine as Draco had been lead out of the room by a woman in a black robe wearing a monocle.
"I think we have enough of that topic," Tonks said, "do you have any other stories to share?" hoping he would not.
When he was finished with his trunk Harrison left the rooms, but not before silently casting a spell Draco had told him about during their earlier meeting that would track if anyone but him entered his trunk. He then left down to the Broomstorage shed and collected his Firebolt to bring it up and store in the special compartment of his trunk that Professor McGonagall had added to it at the end of his First-Year so he could safely bring his Nimbus 2000 to the Dursleys without Muggles wondering why he was traveling with a broom or his family from forcing him to use it to clean their house.* On his way back to Gryffindor Tower with his Firebolt Harrison stopped at the Owlery to pick up Hedwig's cage so he could clean it a little before she would use it again. As he was lifting the cage from his spot Pansy walked in giving him a small nod but otherwise ignoring him.
I may change the title to this later.
"There is nothing wrong Amelia in fact it is sort of good news," Severus said as Minerva had Leia get a note to Susan to come to meet with them as well.
"Sounds easy enough," Harry said as he holds out his left palm and closes his eyes not wanting to see the blood. He winces a little at the sound of Elmblossom's robes not wanting to get his hand sliced open.
"I know you wanted me to let you handle this Luci, but I think I should tell him the rest," Tom said bending his head as if asking for permission.
"Ah, so you would not know," Draco said as he began to run his fingers through Harry's hair again. "Alright, when a Witch or Wizard reaches a certain age if their family has some creature blood in them they will go through what is known as Creature Inheritance. Both of us are part Veela and at this moment we are going through what is called a Courting Dream where we get to know each other better," Draco explained.
"Very well, if you can provide the School Boards writ we shall begin," Grindstone said holding out his hand for the document.
"I can't honestly say for while his newly awakened Omega side has latched onto my Alpha he has not yet made up his mind about it yet, as far as I can tell," Draco said.
"Harrison will need to be under Nutritional Pottions for the next month but I was only given a week's supply," Charity explained.
"See Minerva everything is alright I shall get to work on the contract for the conditions," Albus said with a smile that made the hair on the back of Harridan's neck stand on end.
"Very well take the third door from the left, follow the corridor taking two lefts, a right, and finally enter the fifth door on the left-hand side," Grindstone said understanding the man's problem with Hogwarts's Medi-Witch as the Goblins having been consulted, as they were with each new hire at Hogwarts, had not wanted to give her the job. That did not stop Albus though as rather than using the normal Hogwarts vaults to hire the woman he had used his own vaults to hire her before he added her to the plan to be paid from the Hogwarts vaults for working at the Magical School.
"Good use it and I will let you see.... well the truth," Snape said finding strength as he lifted himself out of the chair and pointed his wand at Harry. Doing what the man had asked him to do Harry cast Protego and found himself seeming to zoom into the Potion Master's mind.
"Hello Harry or is it Harrison now?" a tall woman with long black hair that had curious white streaks in it asked.
"Give your Heirship Ring a kiss, give your full name, and state that you wish to claim all your seats for the Wizengamot," Draco instructed him.
"Not that I am complaining but what was that for?" Draco asked after Harry pulled away from the kiss.
"It is nice to meet you Jeffory, and you to Celia," Harrison said using a napkin to whip his hands before he shook Jeffory's hand as well as Celilas as they rushed forward to get a handshake as well. Both Elves were beaming as they left the room back to the kitchens to clean up a little while Harrison dug into his meal. He had taken a few bits before he snapped his figures thinking he should talk to the pair about what Dobby was doing in collecting his mail as well as bring up the trouble that the mad House Elf had said was going to take place at Hogwarts this year to Charity and Bathsheba.
"Oh, the daughter of your uncle who could stop by to make sure I was alright in one of my family's houses," Harry said making as if to shake the girl's hand. Luna looked at it for a moment before she extended her hand and almost crushed his hand in her deceptive delicate grip. "Nice to meet you, Luna," he said doing his best not to wince at her iron grip on his hand.
"Hello Draco you are not disappointed are you?" Harry asked in a soft voice.
"That is not up to you to Molly I have been asked to collect him and I shall," Tonks said giving Harrison's shoulder a comforting squeeze as she led them around Molly to an open grate and Flooed them out of there. Harrison was glad Tonks was with him as they Flooed for he had no actual idea where they were going. Stumbling out of the fireplace he was caught by a solidly built man who appeared to be in his lower fifties with his black mane of hair slicked back and to the side.
The next day of classes was rather strange for the Fifth Year Gryffindors as in Charms they were asked to see if they had all the books necessary for the class, which thankfully they all did before their homework was turned back. Harry saw once again he had managed to score a high EE grade for his paper, but as he was putting it away he heard Hermione let out an annoyed grunt. Looking over at her, Harry easily saw that her homework had been marked with an A while Ron who was not hiding his at all also had an A on the top of his paper. "I can see some of you might be shocked by your grades this time around. During a meeting last night among the Head of Houses we have decided to start using a spell that will show how much work you put into your homework. This should not be a problem if you work alone, but if you are paring up with someone the spell will also keep track of how much effort you put into it. I had been shocked to find that one student had basically let another do almost their entire assignment, but what was worse the person who had helped them had filled it out with incorrect information, Due to this both students have had penalties added to their work earning a grade all of us Heads of House have agreed such an assignment deserves," Professor Flitwick informed them all making Harry do his best not to smirk at Hermione and Ron knowing the story had been about them and if what Professor Flitwick said was true the pair were about to find their GPA and rankings taking a nosedive with the assignments they had already turned into for grading. Harry hoped that Ron would now have an issue with Hermione doing his work for him especially as they had all been told that Hermione had basically turned in a paper filled with incorrect information. But seeing the expression on the redhead's face Harry thought it would have the same effect as when he had told Ron what Hermione was doing.
On the day of the Hogsmead visit Harridan and Draco only visited the Magical Village to provide a distraction so Fred, George, and Blaise could meet up with the twin's parents to travel to Gringotts. Not wanting Ronald, Ginevra, and Hermione to ruin their entire day so after the group of mates had sent them a signal they used the crowds at Honeydukes to make a break for it. Harridan was rather glad that while he had once told his former friends that there was a passage between the sweet shop and Hogwarts he had never given them the specifics of its location allowing Draco and him to get away.
I might do a squeal chapter that takes place during the Second task but it is not set in stone yet.
"It could be a reason you came here," Draco said making Harry look up at the blonde as for the first time in his memory did not have a condescending smirk on his face.
"Are you not a little young Messer Potter?" she asked.
Vernon Dursley was furious as he drove his family back home from the bank. He had sort of been happy to see the freak of a nephew being removed from his home even if it was at the hands of another freak, granted one that did not look that bad but still. With the boy out of the house, he and his family had sort of celebrated for a bit only to get a call from the bank which had summoned them to an important meeting. Having been order them all there the three Dursleys had piled into Vernon's car and drove to the local branch of the Bank of England and had talked to a teller to ask about the summons. The three were told to wait for a bit, which turned out to be over an hour before they were brought into one of the bank's offices. Inside was a pair of men one looking to be about in his early twenties with flaming red hair while the other was an older gentleman in his late forties with slicked back jet black hair. "What is the meaning of this meeting?" Vernon asked in a harsh voice annoyed that he had been forced to wait so long in the lobby while others who had meetings at the bank had only waited five minutes at most.
"No, it is the truth here let me show you," Harry said taking out his bag and pushed over the first draft from his Potions homework of the year and the one he had turned in with Hermione's help which had Draco's notes on it.
"She is lying," Ron said once she had left the room.
Harry shook himself free from the thought as he gathered his own stuff and headed back to Gryffindor Tower feeling rather happy. Arriving back at the dorms he did his best to avoid Hermione and Ron for a bit as he made a beeline right up to the Fifth-Year Male's bedrooms. Seeing that no one had come up yet Harry could not help but basically skip to his area to put all his stuff away. Seeing the book Professor Snape had given to him that was supposed to teach him different ways to protect his mind Harry began to read the third chapter on the process that the book called Emotional Shielding. It sort of sounded like the Pureblood Mask that Draco had told him about, but rather than being emotionless the Emotional Shielding was putting up a shield of conflicting emotions such as love and hate and using them to prevent others from entering into your mind, or at least seeing stuff he did not want to share with anyone. As Professor Snape always accused him of being too emotional Harry thought this one might work. He would just need something that he both hated and loved to use as what the book called his Cornerstone. His mind instantly went to Draco and the feelings for the other which had done a complete 180 shift since he had started getting tutored by him, especially after tonight. Maybe he should teach the D.A. on how to cast a Patronus Charm, though next time he would not ask them what they were thinking about as they cast theirs. As if planning the meeting Harry took out his wand and went through the motions as he cast the Patronus Charm. To his shock, it was not his father's Animagus form that appeared as his Patronus but what looked like an Eagle Owl such as the one Draco had to deliver his post.
"Naming Day?" Harrison asked.
"And how has there been any favoritism to my daughter?" Albus asked no longer able to hide his relationship with the girl after Snape's blasted test.
Harridan and Draco's friends meet and then the Mates go shopping.
"Why?" Draco asked actually sounded shocked.
"You cook?" the Blonde asked arching an eyebrow.
"You looked so beautiful, like the depictions of the Angels of old," Neville explained causing Theo to blush a deep red and the gathered forest creatures to make sounds as if they were chuckling at the pair.
"Are you really going to eat all that?" Harry asked as two large full plates of food appeared before the blonde.
"How about tomorrow around tea?" Harridan suggested not wanting anything else to happen today.
"Tested?" Harry said.
Harry woke up feeling groggy in a comfortable yet small bed where his feet stuck off the end of it. "Ah Heir Potter you are awake," a soft yet gruff voice said from his left side. Harry spent a moment feeling around for his glasses before finding them on his right and placing them on his face. Turning to look at the speaker Harry saw it was a Goblin, but rather than the normal suits he had seen Goblins wear this one was wearing a light green robe with a pair of bones in the shape of a cross on there right side of the robes.
"Well Minerva," he grit out, "it has come to my attention that the majority of my students had one of their potions books left off of their book list. And it seems that it has been left off for at least seven years, maybe longer."
"How many times do we have to say this we are not related you, idiots," Fred said as he and George glared at them.
"You would have no chance if you tried to remove
"Oh you have no idea," Fred said.
"No, though I guess that is no great surprise considering I never learned my name as Harry until I attended Muggle Primary School just so I would respond to the teachers if called on and not raise any questions about the Dursleys," Harrison explained.
"A House Elf not the Prince-like the stories say," Draco said sounding shocked.
"What do you mean you are dead Harry?" Draco said as without even thinking about it pulled the brunette onto his lap.
"No I was eating with Bathsheda Baddling and she accompanied me," Charity answered wondering where this was going.
Harridan was also thankful to both his new dorm mates as they took in his state and would help him around the castle during the day. Harridan had found out that Michael was a submissive Vampire and the two would sometimes share the treats that Snape had introduced him to over the summer, and he was being courted by Padma Patil who was a Neko. Terry was just a full-blood Wizard though he did share that he was dating Susan Bones from Hufflepuff. Besides helping him to class his growing friendship with his fellow submissive gave him another layer of protection from his former friends in the Patil Twins as they all sat around him during History of Magic to make sure Ron and Hermione got nowhere close to him.
Blaise had been correct in his worry about the reaction Ron Fletcher would have after finding out his former "brothers" were the Submissives in their relationship with him. No one could ever claim that the Fifth Year redhead was smart but even his few supporters were shocked as at supper after the lessons with the Patronus spell he approached the Slytherin table. Both Draco and Blaise tense up a little seeing the shit-eating grin on his face as with only a moment of hesitation Ron sat down at the table across from Fred, Blaise, and George. "What do you want Fletcher?" Fred asked gripping his own wand under the table just in case as Hermione and Ginny sat down on either side of the pest.
"I so give it," Harry said almost in a growl as he crushed the Inheritence test in his fist.
"As if, I barely can do it myself I have not confidence in me teaching it to others," Harry said.
Charity flipped through a couple of pages in the notebook before finding the answer.  "As the Contract is illegal it already not valid, however, if say one of the parents or guardians sets up a new contract.  The example I found mentions the parents not having a Contract themselves and end up getting divorced.  A person will either have to turn to the Goblins for judgment on the Contracts or Lady Magic herself," Charity read from the book.
"Alright oh how do I put this," Draco said running his hand through his hair which showed Harry how serious this was for he knew the blonde was fixated on making sure his hair was utterly perfect with hardly a strain out of place. "Okay simple terms you know that each person who has access to magic is born of one of three cores a Light, Dark, or Gray right?" But Harry shook his head. 'Wow okay, he really did want to keep you ignorant of our world. Alright though they have no bases in how "good or evil" a person is but more on what type of magic that their bodies can channel the best. A person with a Light Core like my Mom and Dad finds it easy to cast Charms and Healing magic, while someone with a Dark Core like my Papa and me, are better at both sides of Dark arts both attacking and D.A.D.A. as well as body-based transfiguration like Animagus or Metamorphic abilities."
"Merlin you are wearing some snakeskin. That settles it right after breakfast we are going back to our rooms so you can put something that is not diseased on. Afterward, we will set that thing on fire," Ron said moving away from Harry slightly as if afraid the borrowed cloak would get him sick.
"It seems that Harry has presented and his Omega side sought me out last night. While this is rather abnormal the reason I would like you to meet with him is that due to his living arrangements he fears he would be either killed or raped by his family," Draco said not liking to share this but knew Luna would never agree to help if she did not have all the data. "As he has been living with his mother's family I suggested he move into a property of the Potter Line, but he does not think he should live alone. I was hoping you could talk to Uncle Xeno to either going to check up on him or moving into the property he chooses," Draco explained.
"Though it pains me to say this, it was my fault for the issue due to our first meeting. I take it you read about the about what can happen if you slight someone?" Draco asked.
"Strange, they may have forced me to do it but I like cooking as well," Harry said making Pansy wonder who he was talking about but thought better than to ask.
"Thanks," Harridan said giving her a smile "so does that help you?"
"But it did take, Love," Lucius said looking up into her eyes and making her heartbreak at the sadness she saw in them.
"Alright random examples Pumpkin Juice, or how about the fact that Hogwarts is set up so that the students basically try to one-up each other rather than have equally learning for all," Harry pointed out.
Feeling a little frustrated at the second book he pushed it away and pull up the last book,
Harry took his seat between his new Guardians as Elmblossom passed over the ring that had arrived during the ritual. The pair of Goblins had a quick conversation in their native language as the ring was passed over. "Well Heir Potter, Elmblossom tells me it was a good thing we summoned your stolen property through the ritual which has an automatic cleansing involved for it appeared that the Gaunt Lordship ring had a very nasty enchantment which if you had collected it in person would have killed you if you had put it on," Bonecrusher said. "It is perfectly safe to wear now as are all of your other Rings. All you have to do is to put them on one at a time where it will test your Magic among other things. If the Ring accepts you it will adjust to your finger otherwise it will slide right off. When you come of age your Heirship Rings will automatically shift into their Lordship counterparts. When that happens all you have to do is to move them to the finger where you decided your Lordship rings will be worn on. Now while you are firstly a member of the Potter family which would usually mean that is the first Ring you would try out since your test listed you as gaining the Slytherin and Gaunt line through Rite of Conquest they will test you first," Bonecrusher said pushed over the two Rings with the symbol of Ouroboros on them one emerald green the other one black. Almost as soon as Harry placed them on the ring finger of his left hand they adjusted themselves showing they had accepted him. The Potter family ring, Harry saw, was made of solid gold with a symbol of a lion on it, while Gryffindor which Harry thought would have the lion symbol had a sword etched into the silver surface of the ring. The Peverell ring was a pure black metal that Harry could not identify and had a symbol that made him think of the Muggle depiction of Death with its hood up. Once more the Rings accepted him as to Harry's surprised when the last Ring settled into place the two sets of rings merged into a single Heirship and Lordship Ring. Unknown to Harry, or anyone with the possible exception of Bonecrusher, as soon as Harry's had merged and settled into place a spark of magic was released.
"I don't get the reference, but no you will be fine after you are released from the Wards everything will return to normal maybe even a little better. If the non-Inoculations on your list of Potions are any indication," Healer Dickens said.
Draco cursed his fear of that blasted forest during the detention he had had with Harrison, but at least he found out that Heir Longbottom was on his side having seen that Harrison's so-called friends were bad news. Neville had even agreed to pretend Draco had scared him so Draco could get some alone time with Harrison, if only he had used it before they had found the Unicorn. Draco was so thankful to find out that Harrison had been saved by the thing killing the Unicorns having thought that Harrison had followed him as he ran to safety from its blood dripping mouth.
"What's wrong with cooking?" Harry asked as they left the main dorm and entered the castle proper.
Draco woke up the next morning from his sound sleep to the sound of a shout from his roommates.  As his body woke up fully he became aware of something really snuggled up to his chest.  Blinking the sleep out of his eyes Draco looked down only to see Harry Bloody Potter asleep curled up against him.  Though the scent he had been smelling was coming off his messy-haired rival Draco could not stop himself from calling out, "Bloody Hell Potter what are you doing here?  While Harry had not shown signs of being awake before that moment hearing Draco's voice caused his eyes to shot open in alarm.  Harry immediately pulled away from his face to take on a startled look as he fell off the edge of the bed.  Draco could not help but wince as he heard the other crash to the floor, but to his shock made no sound of pain from it.
Understanding what Harry was saying Draco hugged him harder.  "Then don't go back there," Draco said burying his face into Harry's messy hair and taking a deep sniff of the Omega's pleasant scent.
As they waited for the reply from their invites Draco took Harridan on a tour of the Manor as the submissive Veela had so far only seen the Floo room, Lucius's office, the library and the Owlery. When they reached Draco's bedroom Harry goggled at the room which was so large the entire second story of the Dursley's home could have fit inside of it. After he got over his shock he suddenly thought of something as he turns to Draco and asked, "Um where will be sleeping?"
"What are you talking about you nasty creature?" Lucus asked his smile turning into a sneer at the nasty creature who had addressed him so easily when it should be licking his boots for the honor of serving his kind.
"Dear Merlin," Professor McGonagall said as Sprout but a hand to her mouth seeing the man's second face.
Fred and George did not trust the man knowing that he would do something to help his two pawns in the duel, so they talked to their new friends to help them get ready. Harridan knowing that Ron might use spells he had learned last year, not to mention some that might be taught by Dumbles shared with the twins all the spells he knew outside those known by his Year Mates. Draco could only smile seeing how many spells Harridan knew and that he was willing to teach not only the twins but also himself and all their friends and allies under the supervision of Auror Shackelbolt.
"You are thinking too much of the Muggle World Harry," Draco said with a smile.  "Since you are technically the last member of your line you would be an Heir and could live in one of your family's properties."
"Surely not," all but Draco called out at his pronouncement.  Draco could tell, by the newly awaken Omega's scent alone, that Harry was telling the truth.
"You know for once I think I am going to try to do it on my own," Harry said with a small smile watching her reaction.
Harridan was the first to break the silence as he let out a small whistle at the results before he recalled the results of his test results at Gringotts. Turning to Draco he asked his mate, "Why are they listed as Weasley-Lupin here yet in my results they are just listed as Weasley?
"I so give it," Harry said almost in a growl as he crushed the Inheritence test in his fist.
"Some more dancing and a glass up Butterbeer," Draco said gently moving Harry away from his chest so he could stand up and pull Harry up after him.
"But why were you with her," Snape asked again.
"No that was just the story that leads to the inquiry," Lucius cut in. "Here look at this two students in a Sixth-Year Care of Magical Creatures class are working with a Hippogriff when something goes wrong as it clawed both of them. The Gryffindor student gets a simple healing potion and blood replenishers, while his friend from Slytherin is told that there could be poison on the creature's talons so was given a numbing potion as she closed his wound before putting a cast on their arm. Now how can two students get the same injury but get different diagnoses and treatments?"
Lucius was not happy that when he brought his evidence forward to Madam Bones in a private meeting sharing with her not only his untampered memories of being a spy for Minister Bagnold but also the results of his test from the recent cleansing, that she went to get Vansel cleansed as well. The three of them sat down and decided that for the moment to have Lucius and Vansel act like they were still enchanted while Amelia gathered evidence against Dumbeodre. While that was in theory well and good Lucius could not let one thing stand, and that was Severus getting paid out of the Potter Family Vaults. For the man was like a brother to him and while he knew the Potions Master's complicated history with both Lily and James he could never picture the man stealing from another family's holdings. Rather than risk using an owl, or the Floo to contact him Lucius used an old two-way notebook the pair had used while they had played spy against the dark lord.
"Very good I applause the steps you took Severus," Professor McGonagall said before turning to Madam Pomfrey. "Is the grading of their homework at all having a negative effect on your own job?"
"You can open your eyes now Heir Potter and begin to mix the solution," Elmblossom said.
" they all said making the twins snort and Blaise roll his eyes.
After taking the cleansing potions some facts come out and a student is expelled.
"He is here, Narcissa, due to a complaint I got about the Medi-Witch who is stationed at Hogwarts. Arriving there I found that she had not even treated him for an injury he received last night, nor had she properly done her job in collecting the medical history of another student which is why we are not alone," Lucius said before he introduced Narcissa to Harry.
"What is it Celia?" he said willing to be embarrassed than have to be referred to as Master.
"Ah good morning to you Miss Prewett-Fletcher," George said bowing her head at her.
When Harry arrived at the room Grindstone had sent him and two Malfoys he saw a Goblin dressed in a suit with a cape attached waiting for them. "Ah Heir Potter it is so nice to see you again," the Goblin said.
"Well Minerva," he grit out, "it has come to my attention that the majority of my students had one of their potions books left off of their book list. And it seems that it has been left off for at least seven years, maybe longer."
"Very well Mr. Malfoy what is wrong with you?" the matron asked in a very low almost hostile tone. Hagrid while not the most intelligent member of staff did, was one of the most friendly and caring so hearing the tone made him pause a little. With a look on his face, he leads Hermione and Neville out of the room, but rather than lead them that far he motioned them to be quiet and listened at the side of the door to the Wing.
"I just don't get it why would you be interested in me, if your creature is not leading you to me?" Pansy asked.
"Well as in your memories with Draco you saw you could do things right with the right technique so I think what I plan to do with show you the other side. I take it you know a shield charm?" Snape asked.
"And do what I don't have anywhere else to go. No other family.  Nothing," Harry said.
"Well it is technically still your tutoring session," Harry pointed out.
"If you know that why did you not come out and have our duel?" Harry asked.
"I have an issued," Filus said as Severus slipped back into his normal mode for such meetings as the topic reverted to what it had been basically all year. Of how to protect the students from Dolores Umbridge after someone had come forward about her use of Blood Quills during detention. After the news had come out all four of them had gone as a united front to talk to Albus to get her thrown out. But just as Severus had come to expect from the man the fool told them that there had been nothing he could do about it. Which might have been more believable if his eyes had not twinkled in a way Severus had long come to recognize as what was happening was part of the man's plan. Knowing that even if they have gathered concrete evidence against the woman Severus doubted the man would do anything to rid the castle of her presence.
"You're a pathetic excuse for a Slytherin, and for a witch!" Draco yelled at her, kicking her in the side once more. Pansy wanted to do something, wanted to get help. But she couldn't move. She couldn't leave you alone. "You're disgusting! Being gay is gross! And Pansy of all people? She would never love someone like you!" He shouts again, making Pansy go red with rage. You feel someone push Draco away from you, saving you. It is hard to open your eyes, but you finally do, seeing Pansy. You smile, pushing your head against her chest.
"You didn't want to be hugged, my mistake." Hermione says. Pansy walks closer to her, only a few inches away from her face.
"I love you." Pansy says. Hermione smiles.
"Orchideous." She whispers, making a bunch of flowers grow from the end of her wand, snapping off after a few seconds of growing. She plucks them off and holds them in her other hand. "You just have to focus really hard on making a certain flower grow, like these white carnations." She says, pointing to them with her wand. They are Pansy's favorites, but she didn't know that. Or did she. Pansy holds out her wand.
"Does anyone know where she is?" Pansy asks just about everyone. They just shake their heads, not even saying anything about you. She has asked everyone, but they still don't know where you are. Pansy is at the end of the Slytherin table, closest to the entrance of the Great Hall. Just then, she hears someone shouting outside of the Hall, and runs to see what is happening. She gets out there, and sees something she wished she'd never had to look at. It was you, being kicked and pummeled by Draco. Her best friend. She didn't know what to do, so she stood there. He began yelling at her.
Hermione and Pansy weren't always the best of friends, but were civil to each other. One day, when they are studying in the library, things change.
