When they walked in, Harry was somewhat disappointed to note that it wasn’t much different from their own room in Gryffindor, bar that it seemed slightly more spacious as it was rectangular in shape rather than circular.
That was the first thing Harry noticed once he stepped out of the fireplace. It was late, so he was expecting that Draco would at least be up and running about to get ready for work, but instead there was only silence that filled the flat.
like my father?” he asked calmly, but his voice was dangerous. His face looked disgusted even as he said it, as if the notion of being anything like Lucius Malfoy was deeply offensive to him.
“I don’t know,” he sighed. “I don’t want to lose him. Our entire relationship is really because of the game. He’s just too competitive and committed to quit, and I can’t bring myself to end it.”
“I had no doubt that you would,” Harry reassured him. “I meant that you’d have to come with me to the Burrow for Ginny’s birthday.”
“Draco,” Harry repeated, testing the name on his tongue. It was much more pleasant to say than
“Ravenclaw!” It finally was announced. “And their partner is… Hermione Granger!”
“I feel as though I don’t have a choice in this,” Draco muttered sulkily. Harry simply snorted.
Until the last day they were assigned together.
Except he didn’t take a seat and instead flopped face down into Draco’s bedding, inhaling the soft scent that can only be described as Draco.
“Uh, well. You see, love,” Draco started, smiling sheepishly.  “The car exploded.”
It was almost as if he could
Despite Harry’s defense against Draco’s accusations, he did feel really bad about messing up their project which Draco had spent weeks on, another product of their relationship, so he complied easily and walked out of the common room with the blond and headed to the dungeons.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked worriedly, taking a step closer and cupping his face. At least I can enjoy it for a while.
“I mean honestly, Potter, what’s the point of you coming when I’m already late? I thought they meant to send you in before work starts, but no, you sat there casually and watched me drink coffee. You could have
“Sure thing,” Harry nodded hesitantly, following his friend.
Eventually, they had all settled into some kind of civil, not-that-close-but-still-kinda friendship, and Harry was okay with that.
“No,” Harry breathed out with a small laugh. “Your coffee is over there on the table.”
“When I ring the bell, all of you should come back here,” The Malfoy matriarch commanded. “Then we can have snacks.”
“And?” Pansy drawled, raising an eyebrow.
Draco, who had been fumbling with the potion, nearly dropped the glass vial when he saw Harry. “Where is your shirt?” he asked, his voice sounding odd.
“Must you, dad?” James asked, dropping his head on the table.
“You can keep going,” Draco murmured, thankful for Harry’s control over the situation. It took a few seconds, but they managed to continue until Harry was buried to the hilt in Draco.
They shared a quick kiss, deciding there was more time for that later when they were alone, and began making their way to their shared room, far away from everyone else in the Manor. It was convenient for the time being, and they were planning on leaving for their honeymoon the next day anyway, spending it travelling wherever they wanted for a month.
They both enjoyed their food, talking about their day and catching up with one another; the usual stuff. The only problem was that Draco kept squirming in his seat. It didn’t sting like it did when he had just stepped out of the shower, but it definitely felt strange.
“Oh fuck,” Draco groaned, his hips bucking towards Harry’s mouth unintentionally. One hand came over and gave his cock an upward stroke before catching the foreskin between his thumb and forefinger, pulling it down with one stroke.
“By the way,” Neville said, peaking his blond heat through at the last moment. “Take care of him, yeah?” then he left without waiting for his response.
“Malfoy,” Bill said, taking a seat next to Harry. “He apologized.”
“Alright, you kids have fun,” she shooed him away. “Your friends look anxious to leave already.”
“Well I knew you were going to be family for a long time. But since you insist, Harry.” She smiled at him warmly. He was glad that his relationship with his mother-in-law was never sour. Not if how the initial proposal-fail was anything to go by.
you,” Harry emphasized, happy with the added heat that Draco was radiating now that they were close together. Draco blushed faintly, and Harry had come to the realization that he rather liked getting that reaction out of him. Perhaps he should do it more often. “Speaking of the party, we should probably head out soon if you want to make it in time.”
“Harry,” Hermione started gently. “You aren’t doing this because you like him, are you?”
Neville, for a start, was one of the first few people that let go of his grudge pretty easily when Draco started trying to help him. He was the one who willingly spent time with him outside of asking for favors without Draco going up to him for company, and he was the first to declare that he genuinely likes Draco as a person.
Harry rolled his eyes with a grin and tossed it back, only to realize that Draco was snickering behind him. “What?” he asked, refocusing his attention back to the blond.
“Later,” he confirmed, giving the other man another smile before they re-entered the classroom and took their seats.
“Maybe next time I’ll throw you in with the ferret,” Ron grumbled, plopping down on his seat once he handled his bags and helped Hermione with hers.
Harry winced. “I hadn’t realized...” he said, feeling truly awful. Sure, he didn’t like Malfoy at the time of his trial, but it was supposed to give him a second chance. Instead, it felt more like he was robbed of that.
“Poor ickle Draco,” Harry cooed, mussing up his hair, Though it was no longer slicked back harshly and settled loosely behind his ears, it was practically pristine and perfect. Well, at least it was until Harry got to it.
camp in your bloody living room until you learn to get up on time,” Harry threatened, standing outside the door to Draco’s flat. It was Wednesday and the sod decided it would be a brilliant idea to lock Harry out so he could get a few more hours of sleep.
“Yes?” he asked, carding his hand through Draco’s hair.
Harry wasn’t sure of what else to say after that, because he wouldn’t know. For all he knew, Malfoy could be wrong. But he could also be correct. All that Harry knew was that he didn’t want to leave Malfoy like this, and he wanted to help him somehow.
Unbothered by their comments, Harry ventured onwards. “See, you must be a magician, because every time I look at you, everyone else disappears.”
“Fishing!”
Harry, not paying that much attention to the words that came out of the exasperated Slytherin’s mouth, found himself leaning into the touch and sighing contentedly. “Feels nice when you do it,” he murmured, causing Draco’s lips to quirk upwards.
“Rainbow, of course,” Malfo-
“I actually hate you.”
“There!” Draco said triumphantly before bending down once again to check Harry’s reflection in the mirror. Seemingly deciding that the reflection was no longer good enough, he instead shifted a bit to the side and grabbed  Harry’s face, turning it to face him.
“Why not, sounds like fun,” Draco shrugged, enjoying his boyfriends reaction a bit.
Harry was overcome with the urge to remind Ron that it was very unlikely, considering the fact that Hermione was sat there happily, albeit a tad awkwardly.
Or at least, that’s what he assumed. When he offered the place to Andromeda over the summer since it was her family home, she said she didn’t want it because she’s let go of that part of her life already, and it reminded her of everything she stood against. But when Harry said it was alright, and he’d probably try to fix it up so that Teddy could inherit it in the future, she quickly offered to help remodel it, saying something along the lines of
“Okay,” Draco practically chirped, beaming at him. “I’ll meet you in the dungeons and bring you in.”
“Alright, alright,” Ron huffed. “And you better watch yourself around that snake.’
“Well, generally people would prefer to get nakes for sex, from my experience,” Harry smirked lightly, quirking an eyebrow at him. When Draco lightly slapped his chest, he chuckled to himself and reached behind Draco to throw the sheets over his shoulder. Immediately, warmth covered his body as he held it tighter across his body.
“You might,” the exchange student said, shifting uneasily. “I’m sorry, and I’d really appreciate it if you’d listen to what I have to say first before anything else, but I am sorry.”
“Okay, good,” Draco nodded seriously before turning to search for his morning drink. Harry found himself highly amused by how sluggish his partner was in the morning and watched him take a sip of his coffee.
Draco let out a deep, drawn out sigh, literally rolling out of bed and
“Harry!” He internally groaned. “Truth or Dare?” He glared at Justine Finch-Fletchy and cursed him mentally, trying to decide which of the two options might be worse for him.
Flipping open the cap of the bottle, he squeezed a large amount of lube onto his hand, producing a loud, squelching noise, and for the second time that night, Draco found himself breaking into helpless,awkward giggles. His eyes darted back towards Harry’s face to check if he had accidentally ruined the moment, and possibly annoyed him, but Harry was smiling back at him.
“Just go,” Hermione said exasperatedly, pushing the blond off his seat. “The teacher won’t be here for another few minutes, anyway.”
“Me neither, Harry,” Hermione said, furrowing her eyebrows while her eyes remained on the man in blue. “But you’re not wrong, there is something strangely familiar about him.”
“Relax,” Harry said, giving him a gentle smile. “Let yourself enjoy this.”
Based on the expression on his face, it looked as though he was expecting it to happen eventually.
Whenever Draco said his last name now, it sounded more affectionate compared to every other time he used it in their previous years. It was a welcomed change, something that could probably remind Harry of happier things in the future rather than every time they fought in the past.
“Sure, mate,” Harry shrugged. “But you do realize that you’re going to have to work something out with Hermione, right?”
“Alright then,” Neville nodded, and the three of them made their way out of the greenhouse. “I’ll take off first.”
“I- er,” Draco flushed, feeling his cheeks darken. “I want to see you.”
This was the longest the Hat seemed to take during this whole sorting, making Harry wonder whether there was going to be a hatstall for an exchange student.
“Wait, what you you mean
, reminding him too much of Lucius Malfoy.
“Great,” Draco sighed, “Because Muggles are really hard to do business with.” And with that, Harry broke into chuckles again, holding the blond closer, and that’s how they fell asleep. With no cable, a car with a flat tire parked outside, and random staple holes decorating their walls.
“Here,” Draco said, Transfiguring some sticks into a basket. Harry took it and they began searching. Not that Harry would admit it out loud, but it was actually kind of fun. There was some strange thrill that came with finding an egg.
“It’s not?” Draco asked, looking up at Harry without moving his head.
“Oh yeah?” He felt the blankets get thrown off them and saw a hand extend in front of him. When he glanced up, Draco’s hand was outstretched towards him, inviting him to take it, which he did. Gryffindor bravery and all that, he supposed.
Neville appeared looking rather sheepish with Draco, who trailed behind him with an awful imitation of Neville’s facial expression.
Draco’s insistence was strange, but it would be a lie to say Harry didn’t want to open it either. What’s one egg, anyway.
Even the sight of it was enough to make him turn red again.
“Is this your first time taking part in an exchange program?” Hermione asked the man seated next to her. “I heard that Beauxbatons offers a lot of these types of things.”
“Oi!” Ron squawked indigently. “I didn’t bloody
Draco’s response felt reluctant at first, but eventually Harry felt him push back and respond to the kiss. That’s when he figured it was safe to continue, moving his lips to deepen the kiss. Draco’s lips parted, allowing Harry to explore hesitantly. He was eventually able to build more confidence before the kiss became messier and they had to pull apart for air.
That was, unfortunately, probably still accurate.
“But I asked you to marry me,” Draco looked genuinely confused, and also slightly hurt.
“I’ll take care of him,” Harry promised. “Why don’t you pack your bags and tell your employer that I’m paying you for the rest of the night so that you could settle in and I’ll meet you back here when you’re done.”
Draco’s eyes him for a few seconds, a strange, guarded emotion in his eyes before shrugging and nodding. “Alright,” he agreed. “If I’m not back when you are, I’m housed of the second building to the left on the right side, third floor.”
“I cannot
Once the number was over, Kingsley went on stage to introduce the next set of performers, drawing the attention of everyone else as Harry stepped down and made his way over to Draco, who stood at the foot of the stage wordlessly.
“Well you heard the woman,” he shrugged. “Time to go on a diet.”
“No,” Harry groaned, thunking his head on the table. “It’s just a game, though. No harm, I just need him to lose.”
They spent the entire night together, occasionally choosing to mingle with their friends or greet their other colleagues, but they didn’t leave each other’s side once that night. Draco even got Harry to dance with him for a few songs, despite Harry’s reluctance. They both ended up having fun anyway.
“So,” Harry said once they pulled away. “What exactly is this plan of yours to start waking up on time? Because, as much as I enjoyed waking you up myself, you must see that I’m not exactly thrilled to have someone else do it.”
Despite himself, Draco found himself grinning at the memory before facepalming when Harry added, “Did the sun come out or did you just smile at me?”
“Cowards. The future generations are getting weak.”
And as he made his way down the hall, he knew that the heavy feeling he had was more than just missing the warm bed he recently left behind.
Harry suddenly realized that Neville actually gave the name of the person he was planning to ask out, and this gave him a sick feeling in his stomach but he chose to ignore it. So far he said that this person was a he, and he was in Slytherin. And that they got closer over the summer.
Harry’s small smile widened a bit, giving Draco a nod and getting up to join him on the dance floor.
“I think this year will be interesting,” his red-headed best mate said.
He chanced a glance to his side and noticed that not only his friends, but the rest of their year as well, were staring at him as well, as if wondering what the hell he was doing.
Finally, Draco stood up and walked over to where Harry and Ron were standing, moving in close, but not close enough to touch. Harry half-expected him to draw his wand and hex Ron.
“Oh c’mon, Draco!,” Harry was having fun getting on his nerves. “You could at least pretend to enjoy being on a date with me, unless you’re planning on chickening out already.”
, where I also post short fics not on my ao3 account <3
“Yes, sir?” Harry responded, already dreading whatever lecture the Head Auror was about to give him. It was all there in his tone and Harry knew that it was going to be a long day.
Harry nodded, understanding the implications of his statement. “I should probably go. I promised Hermione I’d put some effort into revising today.”
“Hey, Draco?” Harry asked after a beat of silence. Really, Draco just wanted to go to sleep. He was spent.
“For what it’s worth though,” Bill continued. “Everyone seems to be easing towards him slowly. He really is alright, and I think you should tell him you really have feelings for him.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Of course. But he’s also very kind and charming. Many people get on with him well, and he’s gotten more exposure to things since he’s been joining these exchange programs since his fourth year.”
, Harry thought. At least he knew that it would be safe to use his wand in any case, but that also meant that whoever that was lying on the ground was a wizard who worked as a Muggle prostitute.
Without even giving a chance for Ron to respond, he quickly turned around and began storming back to the castle.
“Perhaps,” Draco said airily with a shrug.
“But I could probably do it before class if you actually do get up, that is until you get the hang of it at least,”’ Draco conceded, not noticing the odd tone to Harry’s voice.
“It happens,” Malfoy glared at him. “It’s not always like that and I’ve been doing just fine without any charity, so I don’t understand why you’re insisting that I stay with you now.”
“Prat,” Harry rolled his eyes. “I was just observing the drunk Jenga players.”
“I would,” Harry defended his husband. He knew it was light banter, though. Draco and Ron have been getting on even better recently, playing chess and drunken darts at pubs together. They even share their odd relationship with Celestina Warbeck, where they hate her music but will not hesitate to break into song at any and every pub.
“Don’t worry, not tonight,” Harry murmured against his skin.
He walked slowly as he did, a million thoughts and possibilities running through his mind before coming to a final conclusion.
“Shh,” Hermione hissed, waving a hand at them. “Maybe their interest has to do with the Battle of Hogwarts. Either way, this is so exciting!”
Then, deciding he should just get it over with, he knocked on the door softly as to not surprise the man if he really was still asleep.
“I’m sure you’ll manage,” Harry replied breezily. “I mean, if it works, you’re going to have to teach me that trick after you show me.”
at all?” Pansy asked incredulously, facepalming. “There are books, Draco.
“Have you seen Harry?” Draco asked immediately, before hearing his mother’s voice reminding him of his manners. “Good evening,” he quickly added.
“Well, they did say we couldn’t stop until one of us loses,” Harry said slowly, already regretting this. “Unless you chicken out?”
“Ha!” Ginny barked a laugh while reading the note from her place behind him. “Well, at least we know what Draco would say,”
“I had to run after you after quickly explaining the situation to my mother, who smacked me on the head for you,” he said. “And then I had to bold up those stairs, why did we choose to have such a long stairway.”
“You poor, blushing virgin,” she snickered. “And yes, I must be this crass. We
“Why do you look so glum?” she asked without taking a second to spare a glance at him. Harry briefly wondered how she knew and entertained the idea that he was starting to radiate brooding vibes before answering her instead.
Draco nodded fervently, unabashed now that his head was swimming in pleasure and images of Harry’s whispered promises.
“Nothing, love,” He managed to choke out, placing a lingering kiss on the worrying blond’s forehead. “I was just thinking of renovation ideas.”
“I still had to wake up early,” Draco mumbled, kicking at the ground petulantly before lifting it up in one graceful sway and taking another step.
“Malfoy,” Hermione sighed, pushing Ernie to the front. He looked at her with desperation but her puppy-dog eyes were stronger. “No.”
“That, you do,” he said, kissing Draco on the lips once again.
“Of course I am,” Harry half expected him to bring up the fact that this was just a game, which often-times ruined his mood, but mentions of that from him were becoming noticeably less. “Never let it be forgotten that I am the reason this relationship functions.”
“Harry,” Hermione said soothingly. “I know it’s hard, but I think you should give yourself some time and space away from them. If they’re happy together, then wouldn’t it be nice if you could find a way for yourself to be happy as well?”
As the door opened wider, pats of the room were slowly revealed. He scanned the area warily before his eyes landed on a lump under a large duvet. The only sign that it was actually Draco under there were the few strands of blond hair sticking out from the top by the pillows.
or something?” This made Draco’s eyes snap open.
“Of course not,” Harry rolled his eyes exasperatedly at his stubborn friend. “I’m just saying there’s a very likely chance we’re wrong, and I feel kinda bad for antagonizing him when he hasn’t actually done anything wrong.”
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” He sighed, but he was grinning, excited at the idea of seeing Draco again.
“I wonder who I’ll get,” Hermione whispered excitedly, eyes darting across the students lined up in front. “McGonagall said we won’t be meeting them tonight because they want them to mingle with the other students. The Sorting will happen after tomorrow before breakfast where the Sorting Hat will also be the one to assign them with a partner, so the prefects are forcing everyone up a tad earlier to catch it.”
After that, there was a resounding thunk, causing the cutlery to jump a bit. And then another one, and another one, and another one. But that’s not what Draco payed attention to. Instead, he noticed the large, affectionate grin that creeped its way onto his husbands face, who pulled him into a hug and gave him a brief, discreet kiss.
“I still don’t think it’s a good idea to get him inebriated before the wedding,” Hermione sighed, taking a seat. “What if he falls in front of everyone?”
“Of course, thank you,” Robards said, dismissing them. “I expect the file by the end of the day.”
“Why?”
“Well, with all the time I spend with you, we might as well be that married couple that got together out of a pact,” Harry laughed.
“Mate. Malfoy? Lose?” Ron said incredulously. “Good luck, because we’ve all seen Malfoy play. There’s no way he’s giving in first any time soon.”
--------------------------------------------------
“Harry,” Draco moaned. “I’m close.”
“I think it would be fun,” Ron said, “But there’s not exactly any space in the Burrow.”
“Wait,” he breathed out, his voice sounding rough and foreign to his own ears. “If we’re going to do this, at least let me do this right.”
“Oh?” Malfoy raised an eyebrow, but his eyes were slightly wider and the the light blush dusting his cheeks darkened a bit.
Well, actually he could imagine what he’d have been like. He’d probably be exactly what Ron described.
When they arrived in the near-empty classroom, Draco immediately made a beeline for a seat near the front and in the corner. Harry followed him and occupied the only seat next to him before regretting it instantly. Kinda. He wasn’t in the mood to sit in front when he knew he would probably take a nap at some point, except he couldn’t exactly do that now since the teacher had an unobstructed view of him.
The blond head of hair made a movement that could almost pass as a nod, but Harry wasn’t too sure that he actually understood a word he said.
As it were, the 8th Years were given privileges since they were older. For starters, they were given a later curfew. They were also granted access to the Restricted Section in the Library, given that they had special permission from a teacher because it was related to their studies.
“I bought that hair potion I was talking about,” Draco explained, pulling something out of his bag. It was a glass container with a green substance inside. It looked rather appealing, in Harry’s opinion, but he trusted Draco’s judgement.
“Headmistress,” he smiled at her.
“We’re heading in early!” Draco called out to whichever staff or friend helping could hear them. “Let’s go. We should be rested for tomorrow.”
“Hmm- wha?” Draco mumbled drowsily, turning over to face Harry.
Finally, Harry unwillingly interjected. “That is hardly something that should be discussed at the breakfast table.”
“Does this mean you owe me a dance?” Draco asked with a grin, but his cheeks were back to having a tinge of pink on them.”Because if so, then I must reject if my feet wish to walk me into the new year.”
“It’s New Year,” Draco replied before promptly panicking when he felt Harry separate from him.
“Aw, you can’t blame us for your shite acting, sweetie,” Parkinson cooed, ruffling his hair.
“Maybe you should open it,” Draco suggested.
“He’s the son of a Death Eater,” Ron reminded him. “If your standards for alright are that he hasn’t killed anyone yet, then the bar is pretty low, mate.”
“Well, yeah. But I thought you wanted someplace different,” Harry shrugged.
“Fleur did the work,” Harry stuck his tongue out childishly.
Harry noticed Draco’s eyes soften a bit at what the kid said. He shook his hand and ruffled his hair affectionately before saying “You should join your friends in the hunt. Wouldn’t want to fall behind, would you?”
“Ah, but this assignment revolves around you getting your partner to work with you,” Robards grimaced. “I need you to make sure that Malfoy starts coming to work on time. Since it’s for work, I’ll be giving you a 30 minute window every day.”
“I’m sure Neville has that covered already,” Ron teased dryly as they slowly made their way on board with Harry feeling very reluctant to give up his search so soon. However, he realized that Ron probably wasn’t wrong about that. He wouldn’t be surprised if he was already sat with his old friends, or Neville and a mix of other people.
“Harry, look at what I got!”
In hindsight, Harry’s idea of waking Draco up a whole hour and a half before they actually had to be at work might not have been the best idea, but he wasn’t exactly known to have the best ideas when it came to Draco Malfoy.
flirting.
“Adelis, Sofia!” The first name was called, and a brunette witch in the standard Beauxbatons uniform gilded her way up to the front. It took a few seconds longer than normal before announcing, “Gryffindor!”
“Look, I have to wake up early to make it to the meeting place on time, but be free to join us tomorrow,” she said, getting up. “I’ll tell him you’re all good so he won’t be skittish around you.”
He moved his head at a teasingly slow pace, making Draco want to just thrust his hips up himself and speed up the friction against his skin. He felt himself starting to let go and finally just enjoy the way Harry felt and everything he did, until a hand reached down to rub against his perineum.
“Now, before we allow the new members of our student body in, I would like to prepare you in advance by informing you of the many new students that will be transferring in this year. Besides the first years, that is,” she said, and the hard-earned silence she procured just moments ago was blown in shambles.
“Sure, but only if you help me throw Neville in as well.”
“I’ll be in charge of gathering the Slytherins,” Draco stated before straightening himself. “But for now, I must get going. My mother is expecting me for supper.”
“I mean, if you’d like to apparate back to your house and come back later, it’s all the same to me,” Draco shrugged carelessly, as if he weren’t inviting Harry into his bed.
A sudden light of realization flickered in her eyes and she began looking at him with pity. “And you think the bloke he’s planning on asking out is Draco, right?” she surmised, and he could only nod sullenly. “Oh Harry,” she sighed. “It could be another Slytherin, for all you know. I mean, technically he’d have only just gotten to know all of the Slytherins over the summer.”
“Don’t pull your Saviour complex on me now, Potter,” Malfoy sneered, his attitude from when they were schoolboys returning, shifting uncomfortably under Harry's scrutiny and lack of response. "There's nothing that can be done."
“Maybe not what?” Harry grinned. “I think it looked fantastic.”
He felt curiosity creep through him but forced himself to shrug it off. No, he was not about to get into that. He was exhausted and frankly, he didn’t like the idea of paying someone to have sex with him. It felt wrong; like he was forcing them or something.
“He won’t even be the one walking down the aisle,” Ron rolled his eyes, pouring a glass of whiskey.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Draco forced a smile, silently willing himself to stop moving so often so that Harry doesn’t notice. It was bad enough that his nerves were beginning to get to him, there was no need to add the pressure of Harry knowing he was nervous.
“Besides,” Draco added, stepping into Harry’s personal space before wrapping his arms around his waist. “I don’t want to pretend that we aren’t dating.”
, were the only words that processed in his mind, and he felt his stomach drop.
“What are you going to do about this guy?” Ma- Draco asked, pushing the edge of his shoe into the shoulder of the fallen man Harry had stunned just earlier.
“Or you could give me the password and I’ll find my way in,’ Harry suggested, completely joking. Sure, he knew where they were, but he’d rather not be the only Gryffindor in there without a single Slytherin to back him up.
“All the better,” she smiled teasingly at him. “Maybe you’ll learn a thing or two from them.”
“I’m gonna beat your arse in this game, Potter,” Malfoy murmured, leaning into Harry and bringing his face close to his ear so that he could practically feel the other man's breath tickle his neck.
Harry sighed and got up. He wasn’t that hungry. He’ll probably just grab something by the kitchens later when he feels like it.
“I think I’m pretty content with my life as of now.”
--------------------------------------------------
“Do we really have to be naked for this?” Draco asked instead, beginning to feel self conscious. He drew up his knees until they were covering his chest, ankles crossed so that he wasn’t completely exposed.
“Draco,” he murmured deeply, his breath warm against his skin. In response, Draco turned his head just a fraction, only for his lips to be captured in another searing kiss, Harry wasting no time to deepen it. Using the hand that was around his waist, Harry turned Draco over so that they were facing each other, giving each other better access to one another.
“Okay then, just making sure,” Draco shrugged lightly in a rather un-Malfoyish gesture. “It wouldn’t look good for me to have dragged you to a boring party.”
“Malfoy?” Harry’s voice came out in a soft whisper and yet, despite the loud music blaring through the busy night street, Malfoy seems to have heard him perfectly.
“Don’t worry, we’ll take notes for you,” Ron said in hopes of cheering up his girlfriend.
Harry was exhausted.
Harry shrugged again. “I told you, Hermione likes him. Besides, she’s his guide for the next few months.”
Despite his discomfort, he began searching around. First he checked the kitchen, only to find that it was still clean and unused. He left the cup of coffee there and placed it under a stasis spell before searching the bathroom, which was also empty and, upon closer inspection, the shower was dry, meaning he hasn’t even gotten up to shower yet.
“I love you too,” It wasn’t something they said often, outside of their own bedroom at least. Normally it was reserved for when they were alone, or when things go wrong in the Auror department and Harry ends up in St. Mungo’s.
No, even worse. After bringing him lunch, he asked if he wanted to come with him to the greenhouse after and do some testing on one of the plants they’ve been growing so Draco could experiment on its leaves over the weekend.
It wasn’t anything he’d felt when he was preparing himself for Harry in the shower just hours before.
Harry thought, nodding his head a bit.
“See? It’s always nice to refresh your memory and remember the younger parts of our relationship.” Their kids, despite the disgust of seeing their parents kiss, gave Draco a grateful look. Seeing as Harry was finally content with all of the content he’d spewn out to made Draco blush, they were all able to engage in a normal conversation and catch-up with one another.
“I’ll pay for your time,” Harry pushed, not sure of why he was insisting. Anyhow, he felt that it was too late to take it back, so he continued. “Or even move in with me after this, you know?”
Oh yes, much to Draco’s deep embarrassment, Harry had begun dancing around him, slightly grinding his arse on Draco and shaking his hips ridiculously while Draco stood there helplessly as their friends and colleagues laughed, not unkindly of course.
He used his free hand to try and tug off Draco’s own shirt, fumbling a bit until Draco helped take it off himself, finally exposing him to the cool air in the room. He shuddered a bit, resisting the urge to look away once his upper half was exposed for Harry to see.
Finally, he opened his clenched palm and pinched the webbed skin between his forefinger and thumb for a final 5 seconds. “And voila!” Malfoy exclaimed.
“Just let me make sure that you’re safe,” Harry insisted. “At least by staying with me, I would know if something happened if you don’t come back.”
They both didn’t choose to leave Hogwarts either, so both of them were able to spend Christmas hols together. As for their relationship, they’ve still only gone as far as kissing and the occasional snog, along with hugging, holding hands, caressing, or anything in between. Something that both made Harry very happy, but also frustrated because he knew Draco wouldn’t go further, even in the privacy of their dorm rooms because to him it was all still a game. Just a game.
Harry opened his mouth to respond but was instantly cut off by Draco holding his arm out to stop the students who were following them from walking. “Hold on, the stairs are moving,” he informed them, then proceeded to give them a quick lecture about safety and the moving stairs in general.
“It’s a yes, you pansy,” Harry laughed, letting him slide the ring onto his finger. Draco had a matching one as well, as it turns out.
“Great,” Harry murmured, pulling his husband against his chest and wrapping his arms around his waist. “Because I’m knackered and I just want to have you all to myself for the rest of the night. And month. My entire life, really.”
“Well, yeah,” Neville sounded resigned. “But he’s a Slytherin, and you know how they can be.”
“Harry!” Neville called over, “We got a batch of Alihotsy and decided to plant them. Check it out.”
“I’m tired,” Harry suddenly voiced out. “I think I’ll try sleeping again.”
“That doesn’t count!” Harry protested. “You know how I get when he asks things of me.”
“Draco!” he said again, this time abruptly dropping the man’s head, causing his eyes to snap open.
“Say one more thing about ferrets or faeces, Weasley, and I’ll have you seated with mother, father, Xenophilius, Pansy, and Blaise,” Draco threatened, already moving the names to the designated table of torture.
“It feels like the walk I’m taking to my death,” Harry said. Worse than that, in fact. It felt worse than his walk to the Forbidden Forest. No, he was about to be faced with Narcissa Malfoy, the mother of his boyfriend who might just castrate him.
“Assignment,” Harry shrugged and, at Draco’s - understandably - confused expression, he expounded, “Robards told me that you can’t keep coming late to work, so I’m here to pick you up.”
“No need to baby me,” Draco huffed, protesting weakly but not quite pulling away. This time, Harry blinked and realized just how close they were seating to each other. In what seemed like a desperate attempt to change the topic, Draco added “You know, they’re probably assuming things since they know I was here all day.”
“Right,” Harry muttered, flushing. Suddenly, unsure of what else to say, he repeated his previously answered question. “Are you alright?”
He felt nauseous at the idea of walking up to the blond who was sat casually at front, completely unaware of Harry’s internal struggle. Hermione was turned to the side, facing Draco while turning her head just the slightest bit while mouthing “Get on with it!”
“What was it called again?” Hermione asked, her eyes screwed shut while she snapped her fingers as she tried to recall the name of the school. “Mahoutokoro! I think.”
There was a quick cheer after that and that’s how the game continued, prompting Harry to think that maybe Drunk Jenga wouldn’t be the best idea right now.
“I know you’ve had other partners before,” he continued, disregarding Harry’s question. “And I don’t really have the experience you do, but I’m not incompetent. I’m not.”
his story, do we?” Harry pointed out, causing Ron to give him a sharp. “Look, I just don’t want to make the same mistake I did with Snape.”
“Great. I’m driving.”
But when the other students filed in and Blaise Zabini took the seat behind Draco and the one next to him was filled in by Neville not long after, Harry was suddenly glad he was able to nab the seat next to Draco.
“Draco,” he said softly, pulling back the blanket. “Wake up.”
Thankfully, Sofia seemed to have that all covered. It seems she’s well aware of the prejudice against Slytherin since she didn’t seem confused, but her eyes immediately hardened once Ron insinuated that Draco was anything like his father.
“Remind him it’s Gin’s birthday,” Ron insisted. “They have some weird friendship, maybe he’ll agree.”
In a brief moment of bravery, he brought his face closer, searching for any signs of disgust or rejection. Instead, all he saw was Draco’s wide eyes searching him, somewhat anticipating whatever is about to come next. Figuring that was enough of an approval, he leaned in and pressed his lips against Draco’s cold ones.
Harry did his best to watch what he was doing, something that prooved to be a trying task once he found his eyes wandering towards the pale fingers that worked their way through his hair and the slightest hint of a pink tongue poking through a pair of plump lips and, much like when they were in the bathroom, the soothing way Draco’s hands felt against his scalp.
“I wasn’t aware that you passed here at night,” Malfoy shot back, eyeing him suspiciously.
“Stuff it, cockblocker,” Harry grumbled, finally giving in as they stepped onto the train and made their way into an empty cart. “Just had to get yourself thrown into the lake, didn’t you.”
“Oh no, dears. I’ve heard you two are dating and I’ve got a special thing for you to try,” she insisted. “If you like it, tell your friends!”
Oh, the knitting? Just something Hermione had him pick up in his free time. She suggested he do something other than laze around and watch the telly all day and just donate some of the things he makes to S.P.E.W. or an orphanage.
Her head instantly snapped up to look at him, eyebrows furrowing. “Oh Harry,” she sighed, setting down her book. “We knew it was a possibility.”
“Does it matter?” Harry shrugged, but still decided to pinch his side. “Our whole relationship is based on fun anyway. We should Salsa instead or something.”
“What? Aren’t you coming with me?” Neville whispered loudly, leaving Harry to exchange confused glances with the other students who had arrived and were standing by the Hearth, unsure of what to do while the two of them bickered.
“Do you think you’ll be going to the Ministry Gala on New Years?” he asked, hoping that he could use this opportunity to finally ask Draco out.
“I was thinking something that goes with Silver,” Harry said in a desperate attempt to gain control over the situation. They were already playing, might as well go all in. “Matches your eyes. Don’t you think so?” He said, cupping Draco’s face and turning it to face him. He heard what sounded like a suppressed squeal, or maybe a dying squirrel, but ignored it. All of his attention was on Draco’s flushed face, eyes looking anywhere except at Harry.
“Their fuzz, or fine hairs, are practically harmless but can tickle a bit,” Draco explained. Suddenly, another pinch of the final half was taken from his outstretched hand, this time by Neville, and blown into Draco’s face.
Despite their initial reluctance to work with each other, they made a great team. One of the best, in fact, which meant that they were often assigned to high profile cases. That man, ironically, helped him think clearly. They were good at pointing out the flaws in each other's plans and while that might sound rather antagonistic, it did them a lot of good on the field.
Really, though, he ought to remember that since they were partners, he taught Harry nearly every spell he learned himself so that they could be more efficient on the field. Draco’s knack for research is another reason for their success in the department.
Ron looked like he was trying his hardest not to snort out loud while Hermione simply raised an eyebrow at him, something that had an increased effect once Draco saw her do it and gave pointers. On being
Malfoy’s cheeks pinked a bit at this. He glanced briefly at Harry, causing them to make eye contact, and swallowed thickly before Seamus spoke up saying, “Not so brave anymore, are ya?”
Anyhow, he busied himself by fiddling with the magical adaptation of a toaster oven to reheat their breakfast and then setting up some plates for them to eat. He knew that Draco liked to have his with cream cheese, but he wasn’t going to go through his fridge.
“What-?”
“Baseball?”
“Still,” Harry insisted. “You could have come to me or something.”
“Very well, then” Robards clapped his hands. “I have an assignment for you.”
He knew Draco’s address thanks to the few times they worked over time and went over cases there. He always did say that he couldn’t trust Harry with having the right tea and biscuits. However, he still felt a bit uncomfortable with the idea of casually showing up.
“A hero to us all,” Harry rolled his eyes, turning a corner. Draco had finally given in and laughed, bumping their shoulders lightly, a small form of contact that nearly had Harry stumbling on his own feet. “So, were you hoping to try it now?”
“You’re doing great,” Harry murmured against his skin. “We’ll take it slow, take your time.”
“Er, kinda?” It took everything in Harry to not laugh at how awkward the blond looked, unsure of how to talk to kids.
“I got the confirmation,” he sighed. Saying it out loud made it much more real, and he didn’t realize how much it actually hurt.
The hall started emptying out in small groups, and Hermione looked rather put out by the fact that she’d be missing class for the day since she was accepted as one of the guides.
Draco gave him a funny look before shaking it off into a grin. “Not at all,” he said reassuringly. “I’d like to get to know you too.”
Running over to the center of the dance floor, he cast a quick sonorous charm. “May we please call the newly wedded husbands to the floor for their first dance?”
“Hey, Harry,” Neville piped up, pulling him out of his lone sulking. “Draco and I were wondering if it would be a good idea to have a party for everyone that helped out with the rebuilding. What do you think?”
All boys present in the dorm had cheered triumphantly. They were about to discuss possible games they could play that wouldn’t be too heavy but also still help them get to know each other when a knock sounded from the door.
“I have you now, don’t I?” Draco said softly, darting his eyes away in embarrassment. Harry felt his heart swell with affection.
“It doesn’t look too bad,” Draco murmured, checking his hand for damage. He pulled Harry over to the table by the wrist and told him to take a seat before fumbling with his wand and waving it over the reddened skin.
“No, it’s not,” Harry said firmly. “Why didn’t you just tell me you’ve never done this before?”
He zoned out for most of the sorting and spent his time talking to Dean and Seamus. The Sorting took a while since there were relatively more students coming in, along with transferees that are enrolled in the upper years. Once they were done, though, Headmistress McGonagall gave the rest of her announcements and let the feast begin.
More people came in and left the restaurant, passing by the increasingly boisterous table of 6 that paid no attention to the stares and glances they were getting. They were just happy to be able to spend a night together as a family before leaving to see the rest of their extended families for the New Years celebration.
Either way, Harry would take it.
“Why are you using terrible pick-up lines on me?” Draco asked wearily as they weaved their way through the crowds. “We’ve been married for 7 years now.”
He rolled his eyes.
“A pact?”
“Sorry,” Harry said quickly, raising his hands in defense. “It’s just that....”
“But I did have some things to check out here and thought about you, so here I am.” That was enough to make Harry’s heart skip a beat.
Harry nodded sympathetically before seeing another child get sorted into Ravenclaw.
“You’re wrong,” Draco stated plainly, and every head except that Zabini kid’s snapped to stare at him, looking with various degrees of confusion and, in Ron’s case, absurdity.
if you want to check it out <3
“You guys are still here?” Harry asked, making his way to where they were bent over a set of plants.
“Stop that,” Draco mumbled. Maybe the lighting in the Slytherin bathrooms was strange, because it wasn’t like Draco to seem flushed so often. “You’re wetting my shirt with the potion and wasting good product.”
“The one at Malfoy Manor?” He clarified. For the entirety of their relationship, he’s managed to avoid any situation wherein he’d have to step in Malfoy Manor. No, he wasn’t afraid of the place and his memories there could be overlooked by the fact that the whole place has been renovated as well. He just didn’t want to see Lucious Malfoy, who was holed up somewhere there under house arrest.
“Oh really, Harry?” He smirked. He placed his hand on Harry’s thigh, causing him to gulp a bit. That’s when he realized he was applying pressure, trying to put them in a certain position. Once they were, though, he seated himself in between his legs and crossed Harry’s arms over his chest. “I can be pretty competitive, you know?”
“Oh, don’t worry about him, mate,” The redhead waved him off. “He’s fine. Just helping prepare a little something.”
“Oh dear,” Draco said, looking at Harry worriedly. “I’ve finally broke you.”
Harry hadn’t even realized how dark it had gotten out and agreed. He wanted to work on renovating Grimmauld Place a bit before going to bed. He already hired some people to redesign it while he was helping out at Hogwarts, but he left the finer details to himself.
“Merlin, your hands are freezing,” Harry remarked, grabbing the offending pale hand that had assaulted him moments ago. He enclosed them in his slightly larger pair of hands before realizing what he was doing and looked up, greeted by the sight of a pink-tinged Draco Malfoy.
Harry hummed around his cock, sending vibrations through his body, dipping the tip of his tongue and sliding it through the slit on the head of his cock. Draco arched his neck, throwing his head back in pleasure. He both wanted to prolong this for as long as possible, and speed it up and have Harry fuck him already. He was pretty sure he was more likely to finish right that second, though.
Believe it or not, but the idea of eating his breakfast on those uncomfortable chairs in their office with the possibility of Robards barging in to assign them a new case was just not appealing to Harry.
Harry followed the blond as they passed an array of doors which he assumed were the different student accomodations for the lower years before they stopped at the one on the very end, looking much like the previous ones did.
“You could have just paid me back eventually,” Harry continued, pointedly ignoring first half of the statement.
Eventually, once Draco had loosened considerably, Harry began prodding a second finger alongside the first one, wriggling it against his entrance until it slipped in as well. This time, he could feel a mild discomfort from the wider stretch, making him contract around Harry fractionally.
"I've always been able to before," Harry teased lightly with a small smile, refusing to admit that, yeah, he didn't think this through at all. "Please? Just think about it."
“Oh, them,” Draco snickered, watching as another block went soaring for the wall, this time creating a small hole while half of them cheered with excitement while the other half panicked about the ‘destruction of property’ like they couldn’t just spell it fixed.
“Oh, for Salazar’s sakes,” Draco huffed, walking back into the bathroom dressed in his pajamas with his hair wet.. “No wonder your hair is in constant disarray. Give me that!”
, Harry thought.
“I, er,” Draco blushed, hiding his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. He mumbled something indecipherable, making Harry crane his neck away so he could look at Draco properly.
Draco offered to help him out with it once he got his hands on some because he was ‘a pleb with no experience over things involving aesthetics.’ Not feeling offended in the slightest, Harry agreed with a shrug and looked forward to the idea of having Draco run his hands through his hair.

“Lie down,” Harry whispered, making room for Draco to move easily. He obeyed instantly, giving his full trust to Harry’s judgement. Even as he laid his head down on the pillow, he could see Harry watching his movements carefully, eyes roaming over his body, making him flush with pleasure.
as him, then I’m sure we could get on just fine in class.”
“Finish your food, you prat,”
“-face. Very attractive.”
“Care to join me for a shower?” Draco asked with a teasing grin.
“And second of all, you’re supposed to be
, and he was just conveniently away while all of this was happening? Honestly, Harry.”
Harry froze, staring blankly at the paper. He saw a hand get the box and open it, before Draco knelt down in front of him and offered him the ring.
“Excited to get the rat’s nest off your own head too, are you?’ Draco teased lightly, leaving Harry slightly relieved that he didn’t think too hard on his disappointed tone, or he didn’t notice it. “Would it be alright if I did it after dinner, then?”
“Ah, but I was merely stating them by the order of how you prioritize them,” Ron smirked teasingly. “By the way, you hang out with him too much. Starting to talk the same.”
“May the Gods above help this poor student that gets assigned to her,” Harry snickered, and Ron joined him soon after. Hermione glared at them and rolled her eyes once more before refocusing her attention back to the sorting, as the first years entered while they were talking.
“Draco,” he murmured, resting his hand lightly over the relative area of his arm. He began shaking him lightly but, as usual, there was no response. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head as a devious smile slowly creeped onto his face, and he decided he might as well give in to his childish impulse.
“I can’t believe you guys left me!” Ron’s voice sounded through the gradually filling Great Hall. “Eating! Without me! I’m starved,” he instantly settled down next to Hermione and began shoveling food onto his plate.
“Really, you’re a breakfast bearing God,” Draco laughed, waving his wand and summoning them plates. “People would fall at your feet to marry you.”
There was no doubt he was attractive- that much Harry could tell even with his poor eyesight. He stood straight, posture emanating a somewhat regal vibe and yet somehow, that wasn’t the most striking part of him. No, it was that he looked somewhat familiar somehow.
“Is that really your question, mate?” Ron asked, not really getting the point of the question. “That’s no fun,” Harry silently thanked his best mate for somehow diverting the attention away from him and possibly refraining from murder.
“You don’t want to disappoint Draco by not showing up, do you?” Hermione said, and she had a point.
He didn’t, but he wasn’t about to admit that.
“That’ll do,” Hermione sighed, giving them smiles. “Now shoo. I have to meet with the other guides and you both have to make it to first period. Remember to take notes!”
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. If you're interested, I also post short fics on my
He’s never been more glad to have been wrong about a person.
“That’s not the point though,” Ron huffed, also turning back to his plate. “How does he even know her, and why did he go straight to her if they aren’t friends? Are you going to forget the hell she and her group put us through before?”
Harry was vaguely aware that people have gone back to staring at them and that it looked like they were cuddling. They were, technically, but that wasn’t the point. They were given no choice but to play this game, technically. So instead of reacting to their strange looks, he tightened his hold around Mal-Draco while trying to ignore the rapid beating of his heart and the slight perspiration forming on his forehead.
He let out a sigh, already knowing that Draco was going to be late. He had been coming in nearly an hour past their expected time the entire week and, frankly, it was beginning to stress Harry out because-
“And finished,” Fleur said with a sigh of relief. Huh, maybe he was wrong. He got up and looked at the mirror, pleasantly surprised to see that despite still looking like a birds nest, it was at least styled in a way that made it look deliberate and a bit neater.
“Wait…” he trailed off, head snapping up to look at the nervous blond with wide eyes. “You..”
Harry was beginning to wish he could slap the government to enforce better laws to protect sex workers, but unfortunately he had no business with the Muggle government. The wizarding one however... maybe he should call Hermione in.
“Just a few words and you already can’t string together a proper sentence,” Harry chuckled deeply. He could feel him slide in a third finger, stretching his entrance even wider. This time, he could feel a bit more stinging as he was stretched wider, but it felt much better than when he did it to himself.
Harry grabbed the bottle of lube that Draco had purposely left on the bedside drawer, slicking up his cock before aligning himself with Draco’s entrance after he had stripped himself off his pants. Draco felt the blunt head press against him, trying to push into his body.
“Oh Harry,” she sighed. “It’s pretty obvious to all of us that you like him, you know?” He choked, feeling a slight warmth creep up his neck.
“If I managed to pass 6 years without studying too hard, then I’m sure I’ll be fine,” Harry retorted, smiling good-naturedly. “Besides, I can always borrow Hermione’s notes if you manage to resist my charms.”
Draco stopped moving for a second, bending down until his chin was practically resting against his shoulder to look at Harry’s reflection at eye-level, causing him to resist the urge to squirm.
Their laughter mocked him.
“I did prepare myself,” Draco protested meekly, slowly becoming more and more aware of their nakedness. He shifted from where he laid on top of Harry’s body.
“Fleamont Potter, I believe was his name,” Draco explained in a non-condescending voice. “At least I believe he’s your grandfather, if I remember my family trees correctly. Merlin, Potter, you should at least be aware of the thing that probably made your whole vault. Actually, it’s probably still adding today.”
He was immediately pulled off the couch and lifted to his feet. Draco pulled him closer and began humming the tune of whatever song was playing, Harry was too surprised to pay attention to which song it was.
“Draco,” Harry said kindly, “It’s normal. Sex isn’t always graceful and clean. I mean, there are weird sounds too.”
“As if I’m going to tell you that,” she glared. “If you’re going to be impossible, then just stop talking to me, alright.”
“Good evening,” the Headmistress’s voice boomed through the hall, effectively silencing everyone. “Before we begin the sorting, I would like to welcome you all properly to Hogwarts. I hope that your year here will be much better than the last.” This earned a few uneasy chuckles and some snorts from the students, but they otherwise remained quiet. “...but should there be anything you need, do not be afraid to approach any of the Prefects or staff. Thank you for entrusting us and coming back to the school, and thank you especially to those that helped rebuild the castle over the summer. There will be more announcements after the Sorting but for now, let us welcome our First Years.”
When he was pulled back into Harry’s arms, he hissed “Do that again and I’ll step on you.”
“Did the Ministry not give you back your assets once the trials were over?” Harry furrowed his eyebrows. He was at Malfoy’s hearing, and he knew for a fact that this was one of the things that was promised to him. The vaults promised to his name, while still being owned by his father, should have been given back to him so he could start a decent life. It wasn't supposed to be like this.
“Because…” Draco shifted awkwardly from his position on the ground, eyes darting around the place like he was expecting something to show up. “The game? There’s nothing else left for us to do, anyway.”
“Betrayed by my best mate,” Ron wailed dramatically, draping himself against the castle wall.
“But sleep felt brilliant, didn’t it?” Draco asked smugly, clearly proud of his spellwork.
“You want me to tell you how I’m going to fuck you?” Harry asked, his breath ticking the sensitive spot behind his ear with every word. “How I’m going to fuck your tight arse until you come, clenching hard around my cock because you don’t want to let it go?”
“You could turn over if you’d like,” Harry suggested. “It might be easier.”
“Alright,” Draco huffed once he managed to get himself into an acceptable position which was, unfortunately for Harry, having him practically pressed up against his back. “Watch.”
“Sure,” Harry said, placing a quick peck on his boyfriend's cheek. “And what exactly do you plan on doing with all these staplers and paperclips,”
“Really?” Hermione asked, sharing his enthusiasm before their conversation took a hard turn for academics. Harry noticed Draco shift into a more comfortable position, moving his hands wildly as he spoke and just gradually becoming more animated throughout the conversation.
And Harry wouldn’t have it any other way.
He forgot about that.
“No, I bought a share of the company,” Draco said, as if Harry were the one who wasn’t getting it. “I tried to get 100% full but the others wouldn’t give up their shares, so I hope 20 is enough for you. Now, what subscription are you talking about?”
“Yes, how dense are you.” Draco huffed. “If it all really was just a game to me, I would have ended it during our graduation.”
“I know,” he grimaced. “But we don’t actually
“Oh Merlin,” Harry sighed exasperatedly, a hint of smile on his lips. He grabbed Ron and dragged him over to Charms classroom, deciding that maybe he’d try to put some effort into his notes today for Hermione.
“Back so soon, are you?” Harry asked, looking away from the vegetables he was cutting to raise an eyebrow at them.
This went on for a few more minutes, a bit longer than expected and very close to what could be considered suspicious, before Draco grabbed his discarded shirt and tossed it back to him. “C’mon, it should be dry enough to try and style for now. You’ll have to do this part every day on your own, though, so do try to pay attention this time.”
“Don’t you forget it,” Harry could only grin back
Now, however, Robards sounded exasperated as he searched for his missing Auror for the fifth day in a row
Really, he should know by now that Harry was just as stubborn and insistent as he was in getting half an hour more of sleep. He ought to write a book.
“I don’t know,” Harry smiled, “Can’t blame the world if they want to keep staring at you. You’ve got a great-”
“Oh hell, he’s sulking again,” Ron wailed, marching his way over to Harry’s bed and shaking him violently. “Stop it, mate. I can see you slumping.”
And somehow, Harry already knew that the next few months were going to make some big changes.
Yep. Definitely regretting this.
“Harry,” Draco whined, his cock hardening once more.
“He sounds… Interesting,” Harry commented. His friend gave him another look before yawning.
“Wanna help me throw Ron in the lake?”
“No, don’t talk about Pansy now, please,” he sighed. “She’s going to have my arse about this with the whole ‘I told you so’ lecture.”
“Well, what else was to be expected of the founder of Ravenclaw,” Draco huffed, but Harry could see him give a pleased flush at the compliment. “Well, I believe this is where we part,” the Head Boy gave him a small smile.
“Lalalalala-” Draco cut her off, not wanting to think about it again just yet because yes, he did think of his boyfriend while… conducting his research and he got embarrassingly hard from it. There was no need to relive those memories, especially not in front of
“Well- uh. You see,” Draco stumbled over his words, trying to get the question out. That was strange. He was normally the more eloquent of the two, something he says often, at least. “Would you like to move in together?” He blurted before quickly looking away, trying to avoid Harry’s eyes, which had grown to the size of saucers. This was also strange, not exactly new, though.
“Hey!” Harry protested, before a weird, prickling feeling began at the back of his head. Like he was forgetting something.
“I like you here,” Draco admitted before letting his eyes flutter shut. A slow, lazy grin found its way onto Harry’s face right as he fell asleep.
Searching Draco’s face once more, Harry was met with his flushed face, looking shy and unsure of what to do next. Harry had no doubt he looked the same, so he was rather grateful when he said “I’m pretty sure that doesn’t count as dancing.”
“Mate,” he said seriously. “What the fuck?”
“You’re being irrational,” Hermione yelled. “I’m dating you!”
“Not wrong,” Ron snickered. “But I don’t know, maybe just alright to hang out with at least? I mean, if ‘Mione’s gonna be stuck with them for months, they’re most likely going to be with us, right?”
. Funny.”
“Whole day,” Draco said back.
“Good,” Robards grinned, perking up.
“Alright!” the sound of McGonagall’s voice suddenly boomed through the halls. “I can tell you’re all starting to get antsy, so let the feast begin!!”
“Mate, are you sure?” Ron asked him. Hermione nodded in agreement, worry taking over her features as she looked at him.
Once it was fully sheathed until his knuckle was pressed against him, he began thrusting his finger in and out, slow and careful like he said he would. With the amount of lube he used to coat his finger, and the extent Harry went to to help Draco relax, he hardly felt the stretch of his rim around the finger.
“Well, at least he’s enough of a swot to keep up with Hermione, if the Ravenclaw sorting was anything to go by,” Harry said lightly, forcing himself to keep an open mind on the man that they didn’t actually know.
And with that, they, too, had left him. When he looked around, he realized that clouds had formed over the school grounds and it was possible that it was going to rain soon, so he’d best head back to the castle as well.
“I might be,” Neville said, tilting his head to the side, seemingly studying Harry. “But you’re right. I might also not be able to see him as much if I’m setting things up.”
Draco stirred in his sleep before blinking his eyes tiredly, eyes immediately finding Harry’s.
“Why? Everyone’s been making eyes at him since the moment he was called for the sorting!” Ron yelled back. Multiple figures that were scattered across the common room pressed themselves to the walls to avoid the verbal war that was going on, looking for a chance to escape to their rooms.
“Fine,” Harry sighed, pushing himself up. “I’ll get dressed then we can Floo to Hogsmead together.”

“Look, I’m not saying it’s wrong to want to keep him in your life,” she said, “But I want you to take care of yourself. If you can’t handle it, there’s nothing wrong with stepping away for a while.”
looking after Draco. These past few days of getting to see his softer, childish side made Harry giddy. It was a far cry from the overly formal, studious, snarky Draco that he worked with in the office- not that he minded him like that either.
Harry was sure that he wouldn’t be wrong, considering they were all classmates, and gave in with a final sigh.
He was just dismissed from a shift of over 24 hours. After a stakeout that lead to successful raid which took up almost a whole day on its own, he was forced into one of those tedious meetings some Aurors are tasked to go to in order to discuss possible solutions for other cases as well as a break down of what happened in the previous raid for areas of improvement.
“Thank you,” Malfoy said, offering them a tentative smile. “You can call me Draco, if we are to be classmates. I was sent away in my final year, so I do believe I’ll be grouped in with the other 8th Years as well.”
“Alright,” Draco nodded, turning himself without getting up so that his head was rested on the pillow. “See you tomorrow, maybe?”
At this, Draco had finally reacted. His eyes hardened and the muscles in his body visibly clenched. Harry noticed Hermione cat him a worried glance, biting her lip as she debated whether or not it would be wise to interfere.
The sight of him made Draco turn red, but he couldn’t look away. Harry continued placing small licks over the area until all the come was gone, leaving Draco’s skin damp with his spit instead. After that, he continued trailing soft kisses down his skin until he stopped over the sensitive spot he was rubbing at earlier.
“What even is baseball?”
“Exactly. That should be enough to last you,” Blase smirked, joining her in the doorway and opening it a bit more. Harry tried to get a better look, damning Blaise Zabini for being so tall.
"So you've mentioned," Malfoy said softly, looking away. "But we hardly even like each other. I feel like you didn't even think this through. Would you feel safe living with someone like
“But?” Ron urged anyway.
“Please, just fuck me,” Draco repeated, feeling himself get more desperate. With a soft growl, Harry began pushing in. Despite how much both of them wanted him to go faster, he moved, gauging Draco’s reaction for when to pull back or still himself.
“Hey, do you mind if I sit here?” he asked, smiling sheepishly. “Draco said he was going to sit with the other Slytherins because he hasn’t spoken to them enough over the break and I can’t seem to find our other classmates.”
. If Draco wasn't looking at him right now, he’d probably facepalm until his forehead was permanently red, because
--------------------------------------------------
“Half-day,” Harry said again, watching as Draco’s eyes snapped open, before blurting, “And we go on a date in the afternoon.”
“It’s not my first time studying abroad, no,” Draco said, eyes trained directly on Hermione, not even bothering to spare Harry and Ron another glance once he greeted them with brief nods and an unsure smile. “I’ve been taking part in them since my 4th year, though-”
“What?” Draco asked. “Did I do something wrong?”
“So?” Harry asked, his expression turning into one of confusion.
“Please, just go to sleep.”
“Wicked!” The kid cheered. Everyone else seems to have began searching, but Shawn seemed more interested in talking to the out-of-place pair. “Hey, you own this house, right?” he was facing Draco.
“No, I think I’ll be fine,” she eventually smiled once she saw Harry begin to fluster. At least she went with the script. “If the younger years don’t respect me as Head Girl, then at least I know I’ll have my work cut out for me.”
“Honestly,” the girl looked exasperated. “Draco has some friends there! And when I went after him after you insulted him, he told me things and asked me to give some of them a chance. In fact, he’s given me ideas that I want to bring up to the Headmistress to stop all the Pureblood prejudices being passed in families that are predominantly Slytherin.”
“I don’t hate it that much,” Draco insisted. He really didn’t. Somehow, he seemed to appreciate most things when it came to Harry. Maybe he was being biased, but he didn’t really care. He was happy.
“It was nice meeting you,”
Despite his pain, Harry cracked a small smile at that. Until his words fully registered in his brain.
“Hey!” Harry whinged, but he was grinning. Really, he was just glad Hermione found someone who could keep up with her. “No wonder you get along.”
“After doing this for so long, you don’t think he’ll wonder why?” Bill explained. “He might think he did something wrong. It could even hurt him if you just suddenly packed up and left.”
“Why do you call me ‘Potter’ but I call you ‘Draco’?” Harry asked instead. He wasn’t sure why it bothered him, but he felt the need to point it out.
The hand began working the excess potion through his hair, massaging his scalp with just the right amount of pressure and making sure to cover every inch of his head. And hell, if his fingers didn’t feel like magic.
“I know,” Malfoy sighed, eyes downcast. From this angle, Harry could see how gray they were. “I do apologize for my father’s role in the war. My mother was able to keep me out of it for the most part, but I’m well aware of the role my father might have played against you.”
It wasn’t like they were bloody dating. Even the thought made him shudder, and yet he couldn’t wrap his head around why those two were so bloody inseparable.
“What?” Ron asked, looking offended.
“Oh, apparently there’s been an increase in students this year since the War is over and parents seem to think that it’s safer to send their kids here now,” Hermione responded. “Aside from that, since the Ministry practically forced some families to send their kids here, some students that were previously taught at home privately decided to go here instead, despite everything.”
, he hoped he would say. “The game, y’know? It’s going to be hard to keep it up if we’re too far apart, they could accuse us of cheating/”
Whether he said it to calm Harry down a bit or not, it worked. Yeah, he was still a bit peeved and tired of it. But at the end of the day, nobody got hurt, and he did love his boyfriend.
“Would it be alright if I cast a silencing charm?” he asked unsurely, taking a subtle glance of their surroundings. “I’d rather not have an audience listening in.”
“Okay, if you say so,” she gave in. “I just don’t want to see you getting hurt.”
“My grandfather did a what now?” Harry asked dumbfoundedly, unaware of this fact and a bit put-off that Draco knew this about his family before he did.
“Me too, love,” Harry panted, his hips speeding up. He began thrusting harder, faster, into Draco, his hand moving back down towards his cock, which was trapped between their bodies. He began jerking Draco off in quick movements, his hips maintaining their steady pace as he aimed right for Draco’s prostate.
“What?” Harry asked dumbly, his mind taking a moment to catch up to the fact that she was listening in and trying to connect that to their conversation.
Soon enough, the stinging pain was relieved and replaced with a cooling sensation while his skin returned to its normal color in a matter of seconds.
“Molly’s expecting me!” He replied, halfway done with putting his shoes back on while trying not to stumble as he walked. “You know how she is. She thinks we’re both too skinny, so expect a lot of takeaway.”
And all went back to normal after that. The game continued, they still had occasional fights that their friends had gotten used to, albeit very few and only for a short while. Never over anything serious as well. Eventually, it was time for them to graduate.
He could feel more saliva form in his mouth, causing some to spill out and get everywhere. It was messy, and he didn’t like it; somehow, it felt like he was doing something wrong. In an attempt to keep himself from drooling, he began sucking harder, making a weird sound as he did so.
“I am,” Harry confirmed, briefly wondering if he should stand. When Harry gave his answer, the other man frowned. Well, it wasn’t quite a frown, but Harry did notice his lip twitch downward considerably, eyes looking somewhat regretful now, which left Harry feeling very confused.
“You’re supposed to pay the company for a subscription, and then they supply cable to our house,” Harry explained, doing his best to be patient once again. He needed to remind himself that Draco was making an effort, at least.
Before they could make it to the exit, though, they ran into a slightly tipsy Seamus and Dean supported by Neville who was trying to haul them to their seats.
“Draco!” Harry blurted, spinning around quickly. He didn’t need more indicators than a sign to recognize his boyfriend. “And what compensation do you suggest?”
“Do not think for a second that you aren’t having your hair tamed today because if it’s not today, then I am not Ginerva Weasley, Chaser of the Holyhead Harpies,” she exclaimed, pulling him by the ear and dragging him through the hallway and back to the room he was assigned to get ready in.
Taking a deep breath, he squirted some of the lube onto his palm, cringing a bit at the sound the bottle made when he squeezed it.  He watched as the clear substance shifted in his wet palm before rubbing it over his fingers and bracing himself against the wall.
“We were hoping you could help us,” Arthur said, grinning and looking rather sheepish as well. “Just to check it out or maybe find a way to bring it to a Muggle repair shop.”
“In case you’ve forgotten, you’re hosting too,” Neville grumbled.
He bolted his way back up the stairs, leaving Harry to leave, resigned, and take a seat next to his best friend, who already had her head bent over one of their textbooks.
“What did you get, love?” He asked, bracing himself slightly for a trail of floating stationary to tail an erratic Draco once again.
He truly didn’t know Draco Malfoy in the least.
, and I have no intent of leaving him just because you want me to.”
“Then maybe you should stay?” Harry suggested, feeling hopeful. He wouldn’t admit it out loud, but he didn’t like the idea of Draco leaving just yet. More so because he was worried that the blond could get sick, or maybe slip on ice, or-
He couldn’t imagine how Draco might have turned out if he went to Durmstrang, but it made sense that Lucius would want him there.
“Nonsense,” a thick French accent cut into their conversation. It was Sofia, who was now looking at them incredulously while Neville watched on curiously, seemingly trying to piece all the information together.
“Anyway, are you ready for once the feast ends?” Hermione asked him and Harry had to remind himself that they were Head Boy and Head Girl. “I managed to disseminate the Headmistress’s announcement to the Prefects before I got here.”
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged before explaining. “You know those ‘If we’re both still single by 40, we should just get married’ jokes?”
“Maybe it would be better if you went a bit later, wait for the flurring to stop. No need to hurry,” Harry offered. If Draco left, he’d probably follow not long after, but the idea of having him all to himself in the privacy of Harry’s house sounded more appealing. “It’s much warmer here, anyway.”
“Fascinating.”
“Why?” Harry asked, recognizing Parkinson’s first name. “I did notice that you guys seemed to know each other on the first night you arrived.”
was supposed to ask him to hang out after but
“A little slow,” Robards commented when he passed the two of them as they made their way to their shared office. “But good work, Potter. Malfoy, nice to see you here. Finally loosened up and dropped the stuffy shirts, have you?”
“After you fixed up a whole castle?” Harry snorted, smiling at the thought.
“Would you believe me if I said you drive better than Draco?” Harry asked his red-headed best mate.
“Oh lovely, age isn’t catching up to you yet.” Draco huffed, but he was still grinning excitedly. “Yes. A lovely car with all the scary noises included.”
“Rude,” Draco huffed. “S’nice.”
“I don’t think so,” Blaise laughed. Draco hadn’t even realized he arrived, but his grip was strong enough to prohibit Draco from escaping. Not to mention the rest of their friends making some sort of barrier around him so he couldn’t escape.
“Just think, Harry,” Luna chimed in. “What would Draco say? Would he support your choice to drink? It could help you decide.”
“I’m heading over to see Arthur,” Draco’s gray eyes lit up. “He wants to see the car and maybe give it a go since the Burrow is surrounded by open space.”
Harry’s eyes widened. So Draco’s been studying at Wizarding schools since he was 7? That did explain why he was so… academic.
Gray eyes snapped over to where he was seated, where they momentarily locked eyes before giving each other silent nods.
, Harry shuddered. Now Harry was really glad he didn’t step up to volunteer as a guide. Of course, it’s not like the Headmistress would be giving them cursed objects, but he didn’t exactly want a reminder of what happened back in Second Year, and by the look on Ginny’s face, she didn’t either.
“Harry James Potter, do not even think for a moment that I will be letting you skive off your academics on the most important school year of our lives,” Hermione scolded. He hadn’t even realized that she took the free seat next to him with Ron on the next seat over.
Shoving his hand in his pocket so that he was just gripping the base of his wand, he quickened his pace towards the sound of the crash, the deep voice of a male getting louder as he approached.
He curled his fingers into the hairs on the base of his neck, leaning in to press a soft kiss onto Draco’s pouted lips, still unaware of everything that was happening around them. Harry allowed himself to indulge, his eyes roaming Draco’s entire face, taking in every small detail.
“Oh, you’re right!” Shawn suddenly panicked before dashing off to search the grounds with everyone else.
Upon seeing Draco’s scrunched up nose, Harry let out a laugh. “You’ll get used to it,” he said fondly, placing a soft kiss on the dip of his hip bone.
“What was the announcement?” Harry asked, eyes darting between the two of them.
She turned around and jumped slightly, noticing him for the first time since she’s walked in. “Oh!” she flinched, before giving an exasperated sigh. “Are you going to argue with me about being friends with Draco too?”
Even with their distance, he could see Harry’s eyes darken with lust.
Hell, everything about that night was pretty reckless, why not reach for the stars.
——————————————
“Its-“
As if to further his point, Zabini walked in with Theo trailing behind him, both looking as if they were ready to go to sleep.
It seems they weren’t the only ones who thought so, because he even heard a bloke wonder what way he swung. Not that he’d admit it out loud, but Harry was curious as well. For no other reason than mere curiosity, of course.
It was just too bad that the next time his eyes opened, it was because Ron didn’t want to revise on his own with Hermione. Well, he normally did but that was only when revising meant having… study breaks in between, which meant Hermione was in the mood to get actual work done at the moment.
“Okay,” Draco decided firmly.
“What subscription?” Draco asked, confusion washing over his features. Then it dawned on Harry.
“Then after that, maybe I could test it on you.”
It took a second for Harry to remember what they were talking about but when he did, he felt his heart drop a little and his good mood sour.
(See the end of the chapter for
Except, he didn’t exactly
But no, the man wasn’t his, and there was a very real possibility he’d be with one of his friends in the near future. If his only chance to be close to Draco was as friends, then he’d rather not ruin it.
When he reached the bed, Draco was - of course - still sleeping peacefully.
“Because…”
A yelp sounded from Ron, who made it to the bottom of the stairs to the boys dorm.
he conceded.
“Anything you want, love.”
“You’re planning is impeccable, as always,” For some strange reason, he just felt the need to validate his boyfriend more than he already was by the guests compliments. Like he needed to show him how much he really appreciated it, because Harry would sure as hell be lost without him.
“That’s ridiculous!” Hermione exclaimed, her voice becoming louder. Harry heard the vague sounds of footsteps storming down the stairs, and suddenly his friends came into view.
“Goodbye,” Harry sighed, suddenly exhausted. “We’ll change the tire after dinner.” Not bothering to wait for the two, he started making his way back to the Burrow.
“What?” Ron asked, clarifying to see if he had heard right.
from moving around all of the decorations. “And nobody wants to deal with that.”
“If you’d come down earlier with enough time for me to fix you up before classes start, then maybe I’d consider it,” Draco shot back. Harry wondered if he was being serious about that offer, then decided he’d take it even if it wasn’t actually being offered.
“We got the booze!,” Ron followed soon after, trailed by Hemrione and Luna.
“Yes,” Draco sighed with some dread filling his voice, and Harry desperately wanted to know what he could do to make it better.
Even though he knew he was wrong, though, and blamed his teammates, his persistence was the only thing that could rival his competitiveness.
“You did?” Harry asked, evidently surprised. Draco didn’t know why; he figured that he was really supposed to prepare himself before they even started so that Harry wouldn’t have to wait.
“And well deserved too,” Harry teased. “Because I got one from Hermione too when I told her what ha-ah shite,” he sighed. “I need to update them again. They probably think I’m packing the whole house and moving in with them until further notice.”
“I think I can handle it,” he said, attempting to give her a smile although he was sure it came out more as a grimace. “I’ll just-”
“I know.”
“So, I guess we have some news to break to them later?” Harry asked the blond who was laying across his chest, face just inches apart.
He felt his cheeks heat up, and not because of the increase of temperature in the room, and hoped that Harry didn’t hear it over his moaning.
, Harry allowed himself a private smile as they made their way to the next table to have a chat with their guests.
Harry felt blessed.
“Huh,” Harry mumbled, his mind wandering idly. He hadn't really put much thought into that. “Well, in any case, Hermione seems to like them well enough. I’m sure it’ll be fine. It’s not like they’re some blood purist or something.”
“Ouch,” he mumbled, moving his head off the offending object to take a look at it. The object, as it turns out, was a hard-bound book on plants, or something. “What’s this?” he asked, holding the book up for the man on the floor to see.
“Prove it,” Draco whispered, making eye contact despite his visible embarrassment. Feeling a bit bold, Harry stepped forward so that they were practically being pressed against each other and placed one hand around Draco’s waist.
“I don’t normally,” Harry said defensively.
Draco laughed, a beautiful sound. “Sorry, I just figured you might dislike the familiarity. Harry, then.” He looked more relaxed than when Harry approached him, which was a good thing.
“I-,” Harry started, unsure of what to say. On one hand, it was technically an assignment, and he did want his partner back. On the other hand, however, he wasn’t sure of how Draco would take his sudden appearance in his home.
“Well, if you need anything, you can always ask us to help you with your plan to-” the sounds of their voices were cut off when Harry closed his curtain and cast a silencing charm, not wanting to hear any more of their conversation which would probably confirm that the person Neville was planning to ask out was Draco.
“I’m not bloody taking notes for you,” Ron grumbled. “Couldn’t stay awake to do it last time so don’t expect anything now.”
There was a brief moment of silence, and now Draco was sure Harry would laugh at him, or probably say something that would make him feel like an idiot. Still, he hoped that Harry wouldn't just leave him.
“Hello to you too, Potter,” Draco raised an eyebrow. They both seemed to have forgotten that their children could hear them too.
The first time it happened, Harry’s day went something like this:
“Yes, Ronald,” she rolled her eyes fondly. “Think of how exciting this could be! What if the student I get also loves to study? Maybe we could trade notes and ideas of projects!”
“Wait a second, we have house elves,” Draco groaned, facepalming. He called one of them over and had her Apparate the food to their rooms. “Nobody will notice if we sneak out now. They’re too busy with dessert.”
“Mister Potter,” Narcissa Malfoy greeted him, opening the door a bit wider, but only for a fraction of a second. She quickly stepped in front of Blaise and Pansy, allowing them to narrow the gap once more. And once again, Harry was resisting the urge to pull out all of his hair.
Ron paled a bit. “Hey, those ribbons are really neat, love. Would you like some help tying them around,” Ron said, quickly making his way to Hermione. “Such lovely silk you’ve chosen. Very refined-”
Harry nibbled on Draco’s lower lip, eliciting a soft whimper from the blond. After a particularly hard bite, he would soothe the skin by running the tip of his tongue over the sensitive spot before sucking it back between his teeth, repeating the action.
Students clad in blue began piling into the Great Hall, all led by Madam Maxime and two other teachers Harry didn’t recognize, possessing all the poise and grace they exemplified when they came for the Triwizard Tournament in Harry’s 4th year.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright,” a voice that most definitely belonged to Draco huffed. “Go greet them.”
“You can’t tell, but I vomited a little bit in my mouth,” Ron gagged. “Besides, Ferret, can’t you just take a quick shite on them and revive them with your furry powers or something. I remember reading that animal turds are good for plants.”
“Harry, please stop. We’re in public,” Draco scolded, keeping his face straight but unable to fight the blush off his face. He was vaguely aware of the whispers around them, but Harry honestly didn’t care.
It stopped just about an inch in, and Draco could feel it resting inside him. He willed the channels of his arse to relax, allowing it to slide in deeper.
“Yeah, but it makes sense, doesn’t it?” Harry explained, not feeling all too confident with his chances suddenly. “I mean, they’re close. He probably became interested when he realized that he wasn’t such a git after all.”
“Why does this blanket feel so nice?” Harry asked, feeling his eyelids start to become heavy.
Also, you might be thinking: Wow, Gi, are you trying to fit every known Wizarding school alive in this school? To which I say: Mind your own business JHDFJBDS no I'm kidding, I swear it's all important for Draco's character building so things make sense.
“You’re pretty creepy, mate.”
Too bad the novelty of the moment had to be cut off so soon, though, because something hard knocked him on the back of his head.
“No, Harry. Why did you run away?”  he asked, seating them down gently on the edge of the bed.
“Game Night is over, though?” Malfoy reasoned, but Harry only raised his eyebrows in response.
“Thanks, Hermoine,” he smiles gratefully at his friend, feeling his cheeks flush a bit with excitement.
“How interesting,” McGonagall’s muffled voice sounded from the front of the room, but Harry paid them no attention. He was busy trying to distract himself from the way Draco smelled as he reached over Harry to grab the tea pot.
“I was just joking,” he laughed, smiling sheepishly at his bushy-haired friend. When he heard a snort coming from Draco’s general direction again, he scooted his chair a bit to elbow him in the side.
“And what could he have possibly said,” Ron rolled his eyes.
“Do you want me to?” Harry asked hopefully, feeling like he was getting somewhere.
To which Malfoy responded by blinking slowly then turning his head to face Harry. “I refuse to lose to Potter at this, of anything else. Quidditch, fine blah whatever,” He said, suddenly very animatedly. “I’m not losing this game, Potter. I will play until either you lose or I die.”
“Did I- You just grinded your arse on me in front of the entire Ministry and started a dance group called Harry and the Hogwarts House Elves.”
Harry continued watching as he saw the man get even closer to the fallen figure, grabbing his arm and forcing him to his feet to shove him against the wall. Harry couldn’t make out any faces through the dark, but he could see their figures.
Harry, with all the strength of a fully trained Auror, was shakily making his way over to one of the couches, still traumatized from the car ride. His knees nearly gave way when he stepped out of the death-ride.
Another thing that heavily amused him while they were fixing up was how he tried to disguise how thoughtful he was when it came to every detail. For example, he created a platform for Professor Flitwick to stand on when lecturing.
“Whatever,” Ron scoffed. “That’s his family’s fault.”
“Harry, I swear to Merlin you aren’t making this situation any more fun,” it was a partial lie, Draco had to admit. It didn’t make bumping shoulders with strangers any better, but it was enough to keep his mind from straying to a string of curses instead. “The kids will be on our backs if we’re late.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That explains so much,” Harry yawned, “Could’ve said so before.”
“Later?” Draco asked, hopeful. Or maybe that was just Harry’s wishful thinking, but he agreed nonetheless.
“I really think we should have been your best men,” Seamus said, taking a seat.
“You have to admit though,” Harry said, shrugging. His eyes were still on the two figures that had seated themselves down at the Slytherin table. “It is kind of strange. They seem pretty familiar with Parkinson too.”

to Draco, but at the same time he was glad that the other man felt comfortable enough around him to not be too embarrassed by possibly the best sound that could come out of him.
Draco’s head snapped to their entwined fingers before glancing at Harry, making sure he was holding the right hand. As if sensing Draco’s momentary confusion, Harry brought his hand towards his lips and placed a brief kiss on his knuckles before giving Draco a reassuring smile. Draco, unable to help himself, smiled back at his caring boyfriend. Alas, that bliss was only momentary before Harry ruined the moment by saying, “Did you feel my jacket? It’s made of boyfriend material.”
“Potter!” he yelped, pushing Harry off him. His gray eyes stared back at him, widened in surprise. “What the hell?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think I’ve embarrassed you enough for a night,” was Harry’s reply, blushing slightly but choosing to laugh it off instead.
“Told you,” Ginny said smugly.
“Still going, eh?” Neville asked sympathetically, taking a seat next to Ron. Harry could only nod in response.
——————————————
He smiled and stole another quick kiss.
friends anyway. Why can’t he just hang out with them.”
Nonetheless, he was still very much endeared by his boyfriend’s excitement.
“While the other founders might have seen how the acceptance of non-Pureblood children into the school would benefit them and their ideals, and they weren’t wrong with what they were able to achieve, Salazaar Slytherin must have been worried about the possibility of their school being exposed, making the entire community vulnerable,” he explained.
He was finally going to get Draco Malfoy to work on time for the first time in the past month. Draco had finally keyed him into the wards after realizing that Harry would do almost anything to break in and wake him up after that one incident where he used a broom to get in through a window.
“And about the fun thing. I guess you’re right,” Draco sighed, moving away from Harry and pulling them down to one of the seats. “I guess I’m just nervous. Besides, can you blame me. 3 years of playing a game and 3 years of finally being serious, I guess I’m just glad we’re finally getting married and I want this to be perfect.”
“It was built like that.”
“Hello, love,” Draco’s voice said before he added in a much quieter tone. “I’m going to end you, Potter.”
“Must we, really?” Ron whinged. His girlfriend gave him a pointed glare. “I mean, that’s a great idea, ‘Moine, but how do you expect that to go?”
“Oh tush,” she waved her hand. “There’s plenty hidden. Some might not even be found until the end of the day, and you can always just give away the candy you find,” she insisted.
“Sure, mate,” Ron said, making space for Neville to sit down comfortably. The other man thanked him and let himself get settled in before seating himself next to Harry. The cart still had a fair lot of space with only 4 of them in there, so it wasn’t too cramped. Small mercies.
“Let them talk, then,” he said eventually. “I like how what’s between us is normally private between us, anyway.” It would explain why they were both cooped up alone together in Harry’s house, without the presence of their other friends. He got a soft humm from the blond next to him.
“Shall we head to work?” Harry asked once they were finished.
“Hey,” Harry breathed, suddenly realizing how close their faces were. He was practically lying on top of Draco, whose eyes snapped open to stare into his own green ones. Silently, he was thankful that there was no light filling the room, or he’s pretty sure his flustered expression would have given him away.
“Look, you don’t know Draco. I grew up with him,” he told Harry, making him wonder why he even bothered informing him of this fact. “All I can say is that Weasley was far off the mark, and I think it’d be in your best interest to apologize to Draco, even if it were for Hermione’s sake.”
Sure, it was still a bit darker than the Gryffindor Tower, but the place actually seemed quite… cozy. There were some scattered cushions on the carpet by the fire, surrounded by worn leather sofas. The light from the lake glowed through the windows, lighting up the different corners of the room in a somewhat striking way as they reflected on the various surfaces there.
“And what a wonderful and tedious accomplishment you’ve done for the world,” Harry said dryly.
“Tempting though that offer sounds, I really do think I should head out soon.” Draco got up, pulling the sheets off himself and placing his empty mug down, before stretching languidly. He started gathering his clothes, starting with his hat, and then went to search for his coat.
“Now, will you go to sleep?” Draco asked him, raising an eyebrow.
He sputtered a bit before quickly recollecting himself, entwining his fingers with Harry’s and turning back to the game. Everyone else was eyeing them with strange looks but eventually tore away their stares in favor of continuing the game. From the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione give him a worried look but he only smiled in reassurance.
“But that doesn’t make sense!” Harry argued.

,” Ron pointed out. “Nothing to justify the current people there. I wouldn't be surprised if he actually cursed her to fall for him, or something like do everything he says.”
Both Harry’s and Ron’s mouths dropped at her words while Neville’s confusion increased tenfolds. “I didn’t realize you guys were close,” Neville commented, apparently the only person who was able to speak and diffuse some tension.
“You’re wrong about that, mate,” Ron sighed, leaning against Harry’s door frame. “Just give it up and get dressed. Besides, you were all for this party when Malfoy suggested it.”
No context but you'll need it for the chapter: Just imagine the Mean Girls dance
“But that’s not alright!” Harry felt rage bubble inside him. Dread filled him as he imagined what Malfoy might have meant by
“Well if you like someone else, then you could have ended it earlier,” His tone was suddenly cold. He stood up and brushed off his trousers. “Nothing wrong with losing a bit.”

There were a few more that Harry couldn’t bother to remember, but Hermoine would most likely stop him if he was breaking a rule anyway. Trial and Error, or something.
She looked rather hopeful that he would say yes, but Harry felt like it would be too awkward if he just suddenly began joining them, especially since he sided with Ron at first. It meant that Draco thinks he dislikes him, and he’d either have to apologize in front of Hermione or make the awkward walk until they could be alone, and he didn’t really feel like doing either.
“Do you even know what they talk about sometimes?” Harry practically whinged. It didn’t matter how old he was, he just finished a war he’s been fighting since he was a baby. He was allowed this. “Plants! And potions, and school.”
“About that…” they turned left into the Great Hall and sat at the nearly-empty Gryffindor table. “He didn’t give us the exact name, per se, but he did describe him.”
“He’s difficult to not like,”’ Neville said, his smile turning odd. “Wow, if someone told me I’d be saying that a few years ago, I would have sent them to a mind healer.”
“Just,” Harry felt like ripping his hair out. “Look, you said you don’t want charity. Fine, I’ll stay out of your business and won’t meddle with what you’re doing, but at least live with me until you manage to afford your own place and graduate so I know you’re safe whenever you go out to work.”
“Draco sends you this note,” She said, handing him a piece of parchment. “But really, I think it’s best that you go and get ready yourse-”
“Why are we playing a game in a game?” Hermione asked faintly, though it didn’t seem to bother anyone else as it was quickly dismissed with a careless wave.
“I’m surprised you managed to herd Harry into sitting in the front today,” Neville teased, giving Draco what looked to be a knowing smile. For what reason, Harry had no idea. He was just glad that Neville wasn’t pissed that he took the seat next to Draco when he’s planning on asking him out eventually.
“So who wins, then?” Dean asked before Neville was successful in finally dragging them away, looking back at them with a grin and a quick wave. After that, he looked at Draco, who was eyeing his friends wearily before they made eye contact.
“Yes, sir.” Harry wasn’t sure on how, exactly, Draco might plan on waking up earlier now, but he was thankful that they would get away with it this time, nonetheless.
, Harry thought bitterly.
