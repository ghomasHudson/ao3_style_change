Hermione chuckled. "So we wanted to make sure we don't invite someone you don't want to have there."
Draco stood up and walked over to Potter's bed. He hoped Potter couldn't see him trembling. Draco stared into Potter's eyes. For a long time. And then Potter slowly licked his lips and grinned.
"Come on." Harry begged, "We don't have anything to do now, we can just go to Eeylops Owl Emporium and buy one."
"Dean-" Neville's voice tried to calm him down and Hermione also muttered something. But Dean stormed towards Malfoy. When he saw Ron sitting there, white as chalk and ready to puke, Dean was shocked. "Ron what happened? Did he insult you?"
At least Potter was sometimes kissing him, what felt like a little plaster on Draco's big, big wound. But it still was a little plaster and didn't help much. Draco sighed once again as they sat down on an empty table.
"Hello Potter. I'm Draco and I'm here even if you didn't expect me to come.", Draco laughed quietly.
Draco felt nervous. He didn't like to watch this woman touching several parts of Potter's body and mumbling these things.
Harry stifled a laugh. It was ridiculous how similar Draco and his father were, how much messed up hair angered them both.
Draco was grateful for the literal push Theo gave him. He passed staring people on his way to the stairs, walked up a few steps into the light, grabbing the snakes head of his walking stick. Draco reached out his hand and as Potter took it, Draco's body tingled.
Harry breathed hardly and felt tears streaming into his eyes. He hadn't talked about that since the end of the war and he didn't think it would still be that big of a deal to him. But apparently it was. Harry closed his eyes for a second and tried to calm down. The fact that Malfoy didn't argue anymore seemed to be a good sign to Harry. He nodded slowly and sighed. Harry stepped closer to Malfoy, who immediately took a step back. Harry rolled his eyes.
cute. He was Potter. Like the skinny and stupid and annoying and cute Potter. Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry swallowed and nodded. "I am sure. I want to help those who don't dare to talk to anyone else, and I'm afraid the Slytherins won't have it very easy this year."
Their tongues danced, in a fight for dominance, a fight which usually determined how the rest of the night was going to go. And before anything else could happen, the bell  shockingly loud. Harry twitched and looked up.
"First of all, congratulations to both of you." Ron said with a smile, "I can't believe I won't be able to call you Malfoy anymore."
Ron nodded. "Yes, my whole family will be there and since most of them live out of town, we don't see all of us together quite so much."
"How sweet. What are you going to do with him while you are being at Hogwarts?" Narcissa asked and Harry thought she sounded quite hopeful, maybe expecting Harry to ask her if she would want to take care of him.
. In the battle of Hogwarts, where most of our dearest family members and closest friends died, I saw him as well. Mr Malfoy" Potter raised his voice "was afraid!"
So the week went on and Harry had visited Malfoy every second day, the others he had been at work. Nott's birthday would be in three days and Draco had told Harry repeatedly they would have to go shopping because he didn't want Harry to embarrass him.
Harry looked at Ron. He never loathed Ron more than in this moment, and Harry hated himself for that.
Draco watched Potter closely. He rolled his eyes every time he didn't speak, what made Draco wonder if Potter could hear Granger too.
"Don't." Harry said as Malfoy opened his mouth again. Malfoy frowned at Harry and closed his mouth again.
"But what about my parents? I can't tell my parents. My father would kill me, he really would. Not only are you a
But as it seemed, the message hasn't spread that far, because as they entered the shop together, no one stared, no one whispered and no one made nasty remarks.
Draco lay nuzzling the crook of Potter's neck, breathing the familiar scent of sweets, with Potter's skin so warm and clean- smelling underneath, and in barely two minutes, Draco was asleep.
As Harry shuffled into the living room at around ten o'clock that morning, Hermione and Ron were already singing Happy Birthday. Harry smiled happily and the whole drama about Malfoy seemed forgotten. Ron levitated a birthday cake out to the terrace where a whole breakfast was already prepared. The cake gently placed itself in the centre of the table.
The next seconds flew past Draco's eyes. He had blocked Matt's spell, cast one himself, heard someone scream and lowered his wand.
Only a few people raised their hands, the others were either scared of Potter or really agreed with what he had said. Then the minister spoke.
Draco stared at him and stood up. He left his stuff on the armchair and walked up to their room and of course Potter followed him. Draco didn't want to talk about this. He had been perfectly fine the two weeks before when Potter hadn't thought it would be so important to talk about it. Now Draco rolled his eyes not because he was annoyed of his own thoughts but because he was annoyed of Potter's stupid question that he had to answer right now or otherwise things between them got fucked up even more. But Draco didn't want to admit it was good. Because it wasn't. No, it wasn't. It was bad, really bad.
Harry scratched the back of his hand uncomfortably. This was such an unusual situation - Malfoy being on the verge of tears in front of Harry.
"I need to go", Harry said suddenly and before either Ron or Hermione could say something, he shoved his plate away and stood up.
"Fuck it, Malfoy! I'm going to tell you something right now. I can't stand you! I can't stand your silky hair! I can't stand your stupid smirk when I mess up my potion! I can't stand your cocky attitude whenever you talk to me! I can't stand your beautiful pale sun hostile skin! I can't stand the smell of your damn expensive cologne! I can't stand the feeling that my heart is about to jump out of its place whenever I see you! I can't stand the way you walk! I can't stand anything about you! And I can't fucking stand it, that I like you that much, okay? I hate it!", Harry said loudly and breathed heavily.
Harry sighed. He wasn't sure if he could put up with this - being reminded of Voldemort and having all those flashbacks. Harry wondered if maybe Malfoy was feeling the same, after all he'd had Voldemort living in his house for months. But still, sharing a house is not nearly as frightening as sharing a mind.
Harry smiled. "Yeah, I guess that's when it started. He took me to my aunt and uncle's after my parents died, but obviously I don't remember that. He saved me and brought me home."
Harry figured Ron was right. For Malfoy to plan something with Harry three weeks ahead showed that he was sure he was around in three weeks. And that was something that made Harry's face ache from smiling.
Harry tried to fall asleep again, but his heart was beating so hard that he could hear it every time he closed his eyes. Voldemort's laugh echoed inside Harry's head. He grabbed his hair in frustration and turned to the side, closing his eyes once again and taking a deep breath. Pictures of Voldemort's ugly face and wand pointing at Harry flashed before his eyes and he opened them again. This was the worst he'd felt since Voldemort's death. Harry wondered if it really was Malfoy that brought back all these memories.
"It's alright." He said and turned back to the television, "I have to say the news in the muggle world are boring."
In the evening, they lay in Harry's bed in the semi-dark room and fooled around naked. Harry chuckled every now and then just because he couldn't help it, he was feeling too happy. After what must have been hours of kissing, Malfoy had a crazy idea. He whipped his want and muttered something and two silk shawls came out of the tip of his wand. At first Harry didn't understand what Draco was getting at when he held the shawls in each of his hand and grinned seductively. But then, Harry caught on and he felt himself reddening. Did Malfoy want him to tie him to the bed? As if he'd heard Harry's thoughts, Draco nodded. Harry didn't know if he liked the idea, but Malfoy seemed excited about it, so Harry gave in.
Harry frowned. That kind of sounded… as if this was Harry's idea in the first place. As if Draco had been doing him a favour. But, then, actually—
Stupid Weaselette. This fucking stupid girl! Draco hated her. He loathed her. He stood up and looked at the big wooden clock on the wall.
Then his eyes fell on the giant marble staircase that led down into the crowd and Draco's breath caught in his throat. Potter stood at the very top of it and he looked
"It's... I don't understand what happened. How you can forgive him. How he can forgive you. It doesn't seem logic to me."
With that, Malfoy turned around, grabbed his mother's wrist and disapparated before she could complain any more. Harry laughed and disapparated himself. After a few seconds he stood in front of his house - Grimmauld Place Number 12. He opened the door and immediately started to smile. From the living room he could hear Teddy's babbling and Hermione talking with her baby-voice. Harry loved it to come home to this. It was nice to fill this house that had so many dark memories with new and beautiful ones.
Hermione widened her eyes. "Are you saying that Harry should keep something as important as this from his boyfriend-to-be?"
"I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do. His gift is this song, and this one's for you." Angelina and George sang and walked out hand in hand.
"Malfoy invited me to Nott's birthday in three weeks." Harry mentioned while flicking through the pages.
Harry spent the whole last day of the holidays to walk around the house and to pick up things from every room and threw the things into his suitcase. After he had thrown all of his colourful clothes in it, it looked like a real mess, but he reckoned he had enough time to sort it. His books and other school utensils were one of the only things he treated carefully. This, and some things that reminded him of his parents and this sentimental stuff. And most importantly his box - the box with newspapers. Harry folded his clothes and his underwear and put it into his suitcase. The books and all the other stuff on top. Then he closed the suitcase, put it on his trolley and placed the box on top.
Now all of the emotions Harry was feeling inside of him came out as tears, whether he wanted or not. He couldn't stop it.
"Don't you think you should stop drinking if you can't even walk?" Harry said annoyed, but Malfoy shook his head
"You were right there." Harry said, surprised by how loud his voice was, and pointed at the floor where they had sat that night, "And your father..."
The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes, which Harry recognised, was Hermione. Then, Professor McGonnagal's voice called:
"Of course I do! Now shut up and go back to the boys!", Vernon said and pushed his wife back into the living room, where Draco and Potter sat on the couch.
Harry did as he was told and unpacked his trunk. After doing so, he flinched and froze. Malfoy looked at him questioning.
"Yeah, mate, she's right. He's still the same selfish slimy git.", he said. Harry stood up furiously.
He jumped up. Why had he not thought if that earlier? Harry ran up to his room and stormed to his trunk. He searched it through and pulled out a map. He tapped it with his wand and said:
Ron looked after Draco with an outraged expression and followed Hermione towards Harry. Hermione threw her arms around Harry and hugged him tightly.
"I've eaten with Malfoy in the kitchens.", Harry answered shortly and drunk from his juice. Hermione and Ron changed a worried look.
"No!", Harry cut Seamus off, "I don't think that! I trust both, Draco and Hermione and I have no reason not to do so."
As always, Draco stood in the middle of the party, surrounded by people, not talking to anyone, cluthing the drink in his hand. He checked his watched every now and then only to find that several minutes have passed. Draco rolled his eyes. He needed to mingle. So he walked around and started talking to people he barely know until he found Flint, the former Slytherin Quidditch Captain. They talked for quite a while and Draco even forgot to look at the time. Then suddenly, the entire room - and it was a really big one - fell silent. Draco looked around confused. What-
They spotted Hermione's waving hand. Just before they reached her, Ron tugged at Harry's wrist, signaling him to prepare himself. As soon as they stepped in front of Hermione, Harry knew what he should prepare himself for. Ginny froze mid-sentence and stared at Harry.
"Draco, are you alright?", he asked and laughed as Draco stopped in front of a TV shop and pressed his nose against the window.
"What's wrong?" Potter asked with a voice so low and deep that it made the hairs in the back of Draco's neck stand up.
Draco's arms were still wrapped around Potter, holding him close in a firm embrace. Too damn close, which meant Potter had little room for movement. It could have been dealt with easily.
"Argh! Great work, Draco!", Parkinson screamed and stomped with her foot on the floor. She stormed away. Crabbe and Goyle looked between Draco and Harry.
Harry opened the drawer of his desk and grabbed a quill and a piece of parchment. He wrote to Malfoy when Hermione and Ron were going to leave, attached the letter to the foot of Bond and sent him off.
As soon as Draco got out of the shower, he noticed he forgot to take clothes with him. He looked around and desperately searched for a towel.
. But what was the difference between sneaking out to meet at the diner or sneaking out to meet at Potter's? It didn't seem like there was a big difference. So why was it supposed to be a big deal? No reason. Draco slowly nodded. Potter's eyes widened even more.
He only heard an annoyed sound by Blaise, but didn't pay attention to him any further. Instead, Draco turned turned to Theo and wished him a happy birthday. Theo grinned annoyingly and thanked Draco.
Saying nothing, Draco kept his arms where they were, resisting Potter's attempts to free himself. Potter must have thought him insane and Draco couldn't blame him, but Potter couldn't leave now.
"Then..." Malfoy started, but Harry knew exactly that Malfoy didn't want to talk about what had happened after the few drinks they had had, so Harry spoke.
Harry threw a look at the clock that monitored each of the Weasley's whereabouts. Indeed, Mr Wesley's hand pointed at "work". Harry felt like something was stabbed into his stomach. There were only eight instead of nine golden hands, as Fred's has fallen off after his death. Harry knew the hand now hung in George's room, next to framed pictures. Harry quickly looked away before anyone else's attention was drawn to the clock.
"No, he's not, Ron. I've already explained it to you. Some children start to walk at the age of one. And how old is Teddy? Right. One." Hermione said annoyed.
Harry nodded. "Can I bring my godson into Malfoy's room? He's six months old but very calm and quiet, I promise."
Harry smiled. They convinced him he should get to eat something, so the three went to the fifth floor and grabbed a bite to eat and a cup of tea. The day went by faster than Harry would have liked. Before he knew it, the sun was setting once again and Nott and Zabini got ready to leave again. Harry walked up and down the corridor in front of Draco's door. Harry pulled out his cellphone and dialed his home number. It was Ron who picked up the phone.
He parted his lips and welcomed Potter's tongue with his. His head sank deeper into the pillow, their sleepy, slow kiss turning into something more passionate.
"I know, but I want to," Harry said smiling, even though he knew Malfoy didn't see it. But he then opened his eyes.
"You know what, Malfoy? Since when do you care where people want you to be and where not? You're your own person and if you want to see Harry, go and see him. You have every right to do so. And I bet he would want you there now that he's awake. And stop being so cranky and rude, someday the others will find out eventually."
"I'm not good enough for her, Harry," Ron said as Harry and he sat back down in front of the fireplace after dinner.
"Malfoy", Harry started and Malfoy groaned, "How come you and Ron were so civil to each other today?"
One of the last students to come was, in fact, a Slytherin - a boy in his fifth year, Malcolm Baddock. Harry remembered him from the Sorting Ceremony in Harry's fourth year and he was surprised to see him here.
He didn't look up, he was too ashamed, and he didn't want to see Potter's reaction. But he heard Potter getting up and he heard Potter walking over to him. Then, a hand gently lay on his shoulder and Potter sat down on the stool next to Draco.
Potter smiled. It was either the heat of the fire or the words Draco had just said, but Potter's cheeks reddened. Draco smiled and lay his hand on Potter's hot cheeks.
About twenty minutes later, Harry and Hermione made their way to the Great Hall. Draco already waited for them and together, they set off for the library. Draco took Harry's hand and as Harry looked at him surprised, he shrugged grinning.
Harry shrugged. "I guess there's a lot of things happening that I just would want him to be a part of."
Potter thrashed and squirmed and panted against Draco's lips, every twitch of his body renewing Draco's pleasure. It became too much, both the heat and the pressure against Draco's sensitive cock, but then Potter convulsed and Draco hurriedly extracted his hand from underneath the covers to press it to the back of Potter's neck and trap his mouth with a kiss, intending to swallow any sounds Potter might make.
He actually went to class with these people. To class! It was unbelievable that Draco was willing to be seen with them. He noticed a lot of passing students looking at him with confused looks, but all Draco could think about was Potter's proud smile when he saw Draco being nice to people from other houses. Draco thought about this smile the whole day in class.
"Well, you know, I kind of get used to it. I mean first year was shitty. Second year was shitty. Third year was not that shitty, but still. And this year is even more shittier. I'm giving my hopes up on a silent year for me.", said Harry and laughed.
Harry had to hold back his smile. He knew this was the best Malfoy could do without actually saying something mean, and he knew how hard it must be for Malfoy. Even Hermione looked kind of proud - of Harry or of Malfoy, that was unclear.
Draco only shrugged. The gates opened itself, after Draco waved his wand. Harry and Draco entered the grounds of Malfoy Manor. Draco's mother stood on the stairs in front of the big house, that was three times bigger than Number 4 Privet Drive. She cried tears of joy, as Draco stepped on the first step. Harry followed him slowly. Draco hugged his mother, then, she let go of him and looked at Harry.
The new week came and so did the start of Harry's and Ron's Auror training. Harry managed to balance being there for Teddy and working at the Ministry pretty well, given that he was allowed to arrange his work hours as they fitted best. The only blip in Harry's plan was his new whatever-they-were Draco, that has been hanging around in their house for almost a week now. Every time Harry was at the house, so was he and every time Harry wasn't at the house, Malfoy did whatever he did, Harry didn't know. He certainly wasn't taking care of Teddy, that was for sure. First, because Draco hated children and second because Mrs Weasley was taking care of him for the few hours Harry was at work each day.
Harry knew what he ment and took a step closer to him, so their lips nearly touched. Draco moved his head forwards, but Harry pulled his back, so that the distance between their lips was still the same.
"Don't look at him." Potter said "He is too proud to admit it, maybe even to himself. Look at his family."
"So. You’re alive.", Draco's voice was haughty as ever, but there was something soft about his mouth.
On sunday, Andromeda picked up Teddy, who cried and made a mess of himself once again and it broke Harry's heart once again.
Harry turned around once. Ron and Hermione stood there and exchanged confused looks, so Harry mouthed that he was sorry. Harry looked at Malfoy, who now let go of Harry's arm.
Draco nodded and led Harry inside. Harry looked around and found that nothing had changed since the last time he had been here. The hallway was as dimly lit as it had been, and there were the same pale-faced portraits that eyed him suspiciously. Harry followed Draco to a door and as it was opened, Harry froze. Malfoy turned around to look at him and immediately realized what was wrong: It was the room that Hermione had been tortured in by Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry could see the stairs to the dungeon where they had been held.
Malfoy looked at Harry and swallowed the last bit of his licorice wand. "I saw you through the window of Hogsmeade and you looked bored and annoyed so I thought I'd grab the opportunity and try to be nice to you. It's not an everyday thing that I try to be nice to you, let alone anyone, so just appreciate it and stop asking questions."
With the strength he didn't knew he possessed, he pulled Potter onto his bed, overbalancing him and making him sit across Draco's legs, his arse slipping between the wall and Draco's body. His feet dangled from the bed and his slippers slipped down as he struggled to free himself from Draco's hand. Draco pressed Potter's head to the wall, his hand tightening over his mouth.
"Yeah, I mean I don't know what you did but you look so... not as scrawny as you were in the first years of Hogwarts. You're actually-" he looked for a word, "muscular."
"You better be. He's right. Father is bad enough and I don't need you to be like this too, alright? Now go away!", Draco answered and closed the door.
Blaise and Pansy were sharing an armchair, what made Draco cringe, his parents sat next to each other on a couch and Greg and Theo sat on the second couch. They all looked at Draco and Potter as though they were going to perform something. Draco clearer gud throat.
Harry felt heat rising to his cheeks. He tried to fight it, but he was getting more and more angry at Ron with every word that he spoke. Harry knew he was upset, but this was not the right time nor the right place for this discussion.
And now he was walking circles in the lonely Room of Requirement, his hand trailing beside him on the wall and his eyes red from crying.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Seamus and Dean walked in after her and Neville sat down with Seamus and Dean on the very top of the long table.
Draco nodded wordlessly at Weasel and Granger, then looked at his roommate and boyfriend. If felt too good to say that.
As Ron and Harry came back from a round of flying at noon the next day, Hermione was in the garden looking after her plants. After the hard rain a few days ago, the clouds have vanished again and the sun came back out, shining brightly down at them. Harry wiped the sweat off his face and Ron bent down to give Hermione a kiss.
Harry walked up to Gryffindor tower, Draco down into the dungeons. Harry named the password to the Fat Lady, who opened the hole and he climbed inside. Hermione and Ginny sat on the couch and watched Ron and Dean playing wizards chess. As Hermione spotted Harry, she waved to him and he sat down.
After a few short laughters, silence swept over them again and they all turned to their food. Draco sighed and stepped on the cigarette butt. The three of them emptied the pan and Theo enchanted the sponge to clean it and the other dishes. Draco watched Theo and Pansy talking in the living room, but he couldn't understand what they said. The sun made Draco too lazy to grab his wand and cast a spell, so he just gave it up and enjoyed his second cigarette, but he had a strong suspicion that they talked about him.
His throat felt so dry, he was surprised that the word even came out as something else than just a croak. Draco laughed. He was so close to Harry, Harry could feel his breath against his lips.
Draco scratched the back of his head. Really, how the hell were they going to do it? McGonnagal must have a very clever idea. Draco knew the houses wouldn't exist anymore, what he thought was a pity. Maybe he and some stupid Hufflepuffs had to become friends for a project. This was the worst thing that Draco could imagine. Or he was going to be paired with a stupid Hufflepuff as roommates. Draco shivered again.
He closed the bathroom door behind himself and let the cleaning utensils do their thing. On his way downstairs, he closed the door to his own room. Harry was so excited to finally see Teddy again. He ran down the stairs, but froze in the hallway.
Mr Malfoy sat in a black armchair and held a glass of red wine in his right hand. Mrs Malfoy stood in front of him and looked at her husband with a stern look.
Ron and Hermione answered with the same word and focused back on their bags. Harry furrowed his brow. What was going on here?
Mr Weasley had made it his personal job to walk around with a bottle of mulled wine and fill everyone's mugs (except for Fleur's). Bill and Charlie were in charge of the bonfire while Ron and George put the fireworks in position. Harry had an exciting feeling in his chest when he watched everyone do their part to make this night the most awesome new year's eve ever. With every half an hour closer to midnight, Harry noticed an increase of tension in the air. Looking into the night, snowflakes slowly settling in Harry's hair, he smiled and closed his eyes. Hermione stepped next to him. Harry looked at her for a second and when she closed her eyes as well, he did too.
"You came up to me!" Malfoy suddenly said loudly "I was having my drink and you came up to me and ordered one yourself."
"Potter." Draco said seriously and Harry's heart started pounding against his chest. "Look at you. You're a fucking handsome man. I mean Quidditch really does you good. And you are so nice, I mean you're really
So Harry told them everything. How he had ran into Malfoy at the pub and how they had been at the diner and Harry's leather jacket, how they met each other again at the diner and what they'd talked about and how Malfoy came over earlier and how they had argued.
Potter had been with his stupid friends today and Draco had been alone... again. But in the evening, he was with Potter again, what made him feel somehow comfortable.
, every little detail from his life and how he felt. Potter's gemstone green eyes made Draco believe in love and trust and he felt like he could tell Potter everything and he wouldn't even get bored. Between Draco's grey and Potter's green eyes was some sort of magical connection and neither of them could look away.
He repeated the action, his hands sliding that bit higher, and fingers reached up to thread into his hair, gripping gently as if Harry were trying to ground himself, stop himself floating away.
Draco shrugged. "I don't know," he answered and bit his lip unsure, but stopped as Potter's eyes watched his lips carefully.
But Harry couldn't enjoy the dance for long. A group of tipsy girls squeezed themselves between Harry and his friends and started dancing around him. Harry looked at his friends helplessly and hoped someone would get him out of there.
Draco took a piece of cotton candy into his mouth and his expression was indescribable. Harry laughed.
Harry looked back at her and nodded slowly. "I do have an idea." He turned to Hermione. "Take care of Teddy, I'll be back as soon as I can."
"In seventh. I was at another school before, but my parents wanted me to transfer here," the boy answered.
"No. They know you were here and tried to make amends but I was too stubborn to listen and you got upset, a thing no one ever saw you do." Harry corrected him and then smiled encouraging, "Come on. They won't kill you."
Harry smiled gratefully and patted Ron on the shoulder. They joined Hermione and Malfoy on the terrace and then started to eat. It was a really nice day - the weather wasn't too warm and there was a soft breeze of wind. Every now and then, Harry glanced over at Malfoy, who stuck his fork into his food and took only a tiny bite just like he would vomit if he would eat more at a time. Hermione, Ron and Harry were having a conversation while Malfoy was just a silent participant.
Draco groaned and took a third cantaloupe. When all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same. Then, at a wave of his wand, the tables zoomed back along the walls, leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right-hand wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello and some bagpipes were set upon it. The Weird Sisters trooped up onto the stage and picked up their instruments. The lanterns on all the other tables had gone out and the other champions and their partners stood up.
"Is everything alright, dear?" She asked kindly and Harry nodded. As soon as he was sitting down, their food appeared on their plates. Harry's food looked delicious.
A minute later, Malfoy opened the door and looked Harry dead in the eye. "What the hell is-" Malfoy started angrily, but couldn't finish the sentence because Harry grabbed Malfoy's waist and pulled him close. Before Malfoy realized what happened, their lips were already touching.
"It was asked for you.", the headmistress told him, laying her glasses down on her desk. Draco looked at her.
Harry waved off. "Come on, I'm sure the others are awake already," He said and got up but Malfoy didn't move. "What's wrong?"
Harry had the whole day a strange feeling and didn't feel right. Something important was missing, although Harry couldn't figure out what it was.
Draco loves to see this boy being scared of the boy he used to bully in their childhood. They walked back down into the living room and Dudley sat to his parents.
Before Harry closed the door, he spotted a shining blonde head in the class. Malfoy and Harry made eye contact for only a second or two, but that was enough to make Harry feel horrible. Malfoy looked so betrayed and hurt. Harry closed the door. This time,
. So get out of my way and stop staring, you look like idiots. And you don't want people to know, right?"
Harry didn't know if she was mad or trying to be nice. Then, her face broke into a grin and the question was answered.
Time passed faster than Draco realised. Soon, the bell rang and he was pulled out of his daydream. People around him started packing their stuff and the Professor cleaned the board with a swish of her wand and said goodbye to the students. Potter gave Draco a smile before he left as well. Even though Draco wasn't sure Potter would approve of this, Draco caught up with the two Gryffindors on their way to the next class. He thought Potter was the one wanting his friends to know and now that one knew, why hide anything? Granger stared at Draco when he approached them, but Potter looked at Draco like he was just any other person. Okay, maybe not
Seamus called for Sam, to help or to admire, Harry didn't know but he appreciated it. Sam came around the corner and drew a sharp breath. He checked Harry out from head to toe, tilted his head and stepped closer.
"Yes you do", Draco nodded, "Your hands are hot, your eyes are glowing, you are constantly licking your lips and won't stop looking at mine."
Draco watched Harry with a smile on his lips. Harry stopped and looked at the blond boy and again, his face turned red.
But all the other emotions came up and Draco started crying again. He hoped no one would hear him. He crawled over to his bedside table. Draco threw the letter to his mother on the floor. Beneath it was the picture Draco had stolen from Potter's drawer. Potter in the picture laughed happily, while Draco sobbed and put the bottle to his lips. How has it come to this?
Draco shushed him desperately and Potter stilled, his wide green eyes staring at Draco in disbelief. Draco grabbed his wand from his bedside table and cast a few charms at the door. Terrified, he pulled his legs from underneath Potter and freed Potter's mouth. Draco stood up to check if the door was closed. Potter sighed happily.
She must be quite happy to see Draco for she was all alone in this giant house - the servants didn't dare to talk to them. Draco didn't ask her why she hadn't visited him at the hospital, he didn't want to know.
"You bastard! You bloody bastard! What do you think?", Draco said and slapped Potter on his shoulder. Potter laughed quietly.
He stormed out of the Great Hall and on the school yard. Harry screamed into the dark night and balled his fists. He was so angry. Why did McGonnagal do this? What was wrong with her? Had Harry done something wrong so he was getting punished with this? That must be it. McGonnagal wanted to punish him. This was the worst punishment imaginable. Harry felt like crying but he didn't want to. He hated Malfoy!
A woman had appeared from behind a heavy dark red curtain. She had red hair, several needle-like things in her lip and one in her nose and holes in her ears. Theo looked at Draco with big eyes.
Potter looked confused at first, then he smiled and pulled the thing back out again. "A phone." He said.
So Harry closed his eyed again, but all he could think about was the loss he suddenly felt in his chest. Sirius. Pictures of Sirius's handsome smile flashed before Harry's eyes, his voice calling Harry's name echoed in his ears. It's been three years since Sirius died, but to Harry it still felt as if it had just happened. He remembered the feeling of hope he'd had when Sirius had asked him to move in together, the hope to finally have a normal family. But little did Harry know that only two years later Sirius would be dead.
This time it was Ron that laughed out loud. Harry rolled his eyes, but threw Draco a quick look - just to check.
Draco and Weasley helped Potter get up, what seemed like it hurt him very much. Draco felt really bad for him and wished he could take the pain himself.
Ginny got back together with Dean not long after Ron moved out from the Burrow. Ron had told Harry how many times he'd seen Dean around the house while he and Hermione were packing boxes. It had been a fair few times, but Harry wasn't as concerned as he had thought he would be. After all, he had broken up with Ginny because he thought it would be best for them to have some alone time. If she didn't think so, that was just as fine by Harry.
Malfoy just stood next to them and watched Harry with curious eyes. He wanted Harry to go home. Harry knew it. Before Harry could say anything else, Narcissa said:
"Levicorpus!", he said and the three people rose into mid-air. Potter laughed as Petunia squealed loudly. Draco laughed as well and walked with Potter to the door.
The git sat on his bed and packed his school stuff. Draco looked at him, but didn't answer. He wanted to talk to someone.
"You won't tell anyone, will you?", Draco asked and Harry heard the fear in his voice, so he took Draco's hand. Ron stared at their hands, then up to Draco's face, then to Harry's and nodded.
"Will you please be quiet now!" Madame Pince snapped and walked around the shelf, "This is a library not a-"
Hermione smiled at first, but then threw a worried look at Ron in the living room. Harry nodded, because he knew what her thoughts were, so Hermione suggested that she could take Ron somewhere.
"It's alright. You see, father, Harry here wanted me to wear my hair like this just once.", Draco answered with a pleasant smile. Mr Malfoy nodded.
"Should I leave?", Harry asked and secretly, he already knew the answer. Draco didn't make any sign of wanting Harry to leave or wanting him to stay.
"Dada! Dada!" Teddy said more than happy and crawled over the whole light blue carpet in the living room until he reached Harry, who sat on the door step and opened his arms.
Harry tapped on the bed next to himself, signaling Malfoy to sit down. Malfoy did so, and Harry asked him what day it was - he couldn't stand not knowing.
They continued what they had done on the couch before they had been interrupted and the night couldn't be used better.
Draco let himself fall down on his bed. He sighed and thought about the day before. It had been nice walking around Diagon Alley, they had even stopped by Knockturn Alley, but most of the shops have been shut down.
Draco smiled as he looked at his boyfriend and noticed his eyes watering. He put an arm around Potter's shoulders and pulled him closer.
Malfoy shook his head and leaned closer. Harry leaned back. What was he doing? His friends were sitting there watching them and Malfoy decided to just make a move at Harry? Harry stopped Malfoy with a hand to his chest.
! He produced a cleaning spell and lifted the silencing charms from his bed. Harry groaned annoyed and closed his eyes, hoping there would be no second dream of Draco Malfoy.
"No. You haven't," Draco answered sharply, "Can you please shut your stupid mouth for a second? I need to think."
"I want to see if the old books are here again." She explained when Ron asked why she wanted to go there when school hadn't already started.
They all hugged each other, but Harry was uncertain whether to hug Ginny or not. He smiled at her and as she smiled back, he hugged her too.
Harry sat back down next to him and looked around. The whole fifth floor, apart from the tearoom and the gift shop, was dimly lit. Harry looked at Malfoy and unconsciously only waited for him to tell Harry that he wanted to have another cigarette. They've been outside twice already because Malfoy was so stressed that he "just needed one cigarette" to calm down. Harry had sighed both times, but followed Malfoy because he didn't want him to be on his own.
"You need two hours to get ready. I don't want to know how long it takes when Potter is coming." Theo said with a chuckle.
Kissing Harry was one thing, but crying or nearly crying seemed like a whole other level to Harry. Was Malfoy that comfortable with him now? Or was he just too tired to hold it back? Either way, Harry pulled Malfoy close again and put his arms around his waist. Malfoy buried his face in Harry's shoulder and started to shake a little. Harry slowly reached up to the back of Malfoy's head and carefully placed his hand on his hair. Harry felt Malfoy flinch, but he didn't move, so Harry ran his fingers through Malfoy's soft hair.
"I  actually like to sleep with Parvati," Hermione said and suddenly, Ron and Harry burst out laughing. "In one room!" She added annoyed, but that didn't keep Ron and Harry shut.
He squirmed, his lips still firmly attached to Draco's as he slid his pyjamas and pants to his thighs. Draco's hand was gripping Potter's bare arse in an instant. He moaned as Potter's cock touched his, hard and hot. Potter twitched his hips forward moaning loudly.
Draco opened them and looked at Harry with wide grey eyes. "I don't know, he's a really nice bloke and I think I- I let my prejudices stop me from seeing this."
"I'm really happy for you and Neville. You make quite a charming couple," Harry smiled and Luna's face lit up.
"Did we actually just spend half an hour together in a room without fighting?" He said while walking to the door.
Harry didn't bother to ask why and argue with him, he was too stuffed and too tired for that. The day had gone by faster than he'd thought and he still needed to write Ron and Hermione. Luckily, Bond had come back with Draco's owl only shortly after they had gotten back inside from the garden.
"May I present you, my parents. Lily Evans Potter and James Potter.", Potter said and smiled at Draco.
Not a minute later, Neville opened the door. He looked out of place, a button on his pants wasn't fastened and his shirt was half tucked in. When Harry looked past Neville into the room he realised what had been going on. Luna sat on the bed and grinned, her cheeks red and her hair was even more undone than usual. Harry immediately felt uncomfortable.
Harry felt really great. His stomach turned upside down and his heart fluttered. Everything was so surreal Harry had to lay back and close his eyes, expecting everything to vanish. But when he opened his eyes again, he saw Malfoy smiling at him and Harry smiled back.
A middle aged witch in a green robe walked up to Harry, clipboard clutched to her chest. "Are you waiting for someone?" She asked.
"We built another tower next to the owlery, where we eighth year students will sleep this year." Harry told his friends.
Sipping his beer, Harry looked around. Ginny, Luna and Hermione danced happily to the loud music, Dean, Neville and Ron watched them smiling. Harry felt a bit of jealousy when he looked at the boys watching their beautiful girlfriends dance. He sighed and put his glass to his lips. But Harry's jealousy vanished as Luna grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the girls. He joined their dance and Ron, Neville and Dean laughed amused and started dancing as well.
"I am.", he said and looked for an elve bringing them their breakfast so Potter will finally shut up.
As you guessed, I just recieved a letter from father as well. He was very stern, he told me I would have disgraced our family and he wouldn't have expected this from me. He also said Potter was our enemy. I am deeply sorry, but I fear I have to disagree with him. When I visited Potter in the hospital wing, his friend also called me their enemy and it hurt me a lot. I feel like the war has separated our world more than before. Now also my generation is affected by believing in good and evil and I just don't know how to survive this."
Malfoy furrowed his brow and Harry suggested they sat down. So they sat across from each other on Harry's bed.
"Weasel!", Draco called and the four Gryffindors turned around to look at him. Draco walked towards them.
?! His room was so much better than Harry's was. Harry stepped outside and a warm wind blew through his hair. The grounds of Malfoy Manor looked so beautiful in the summer sun. Harry felt two arms closing around his torso and Draco's chin lay on his shoulder.
"Good." She folded her hands in her lap, "But if you touch him without his consent, if you say or do, or if you let anyone say or do anything to hurt him, I will torture you and that person and I will make your life miserable. I would do anything to protect him, you know that."
"I don't know, you must have told McGonnagal something, I don't know! Everything is your fault!" Draco said loudly.
"Sorry," the boy said and after he looked up at Harry's face, he quickly took a step back. "I am so sorry, Harry Potter. I was just so focused on my timetable," he said hastily. Harry didn't answer, what made the boy a bit uncomfortable, he didn't know if he insulted Harry in some way. "I- um..." the boy started his next sentence, but Harry cut him off.
Laughing made Harry hurt his stomach, so he held it, what made Malfoy look at him with worried eyes.
"Someone hit a curse at me and I can't talk out loud. Whenever I try to say a word, my throat gets tied and I can't breathe.", he explained.
. In your fifth year, he kept telling me that I should open my eyes, but I said "Severus, why can't you just let it go?". He used to tell me all along, but I didn't want to see it.", Lucius said.
Draco couldn't be happy about that he found out that these were Potter's emotions. He was angry now too. These two call themselves
"That was a very nice speech." McGonagall  said to Harry while he chewed on his chicken, "Are you sure you want to talk to the students later? There may be quite a lot of them."
The air was cold and Harry immediately started to freeze, but his face and ears were heated from excitement. Some students were outside, playing in the little snow that had already fallen. They watched Harry running after Malfoy, who was gaining speed with every step he took.
table - almost the worst of all. Draco shook his head at the thought and sat down at his favourite table - the one from Slytherin. He could almost feel Blaise looking at him every now and then. Draco ate his breakfast in silence. The day had already started
With his thumb, Draco carefully switched on the water in the sink and washed the dried blood off his hands. He grabbed his wand and with a flick, he fixed his broken bones. He moved his fingers slowly and carefully and when it hurt far less, Draco washed his face. He was too ashamed to look into the mirror, so he just buried his face in a towel. This was not how this week was supposed to end. How could he have done Potter so wrong? What had he been thinking- writing his father such a lousy letter.
He leaned over the table and pressed his lips on Draco's. Draco's hands wandered into Potter's hair and they kissed over their breakfast plate.
Harry caught Neville's eye. Neville raised the corner of his lip, not very impressed by Harry's little stunt. Harry felt bad he made his friends worry about him, and now they didn't like Malfoy at all. And the worst thing was that Neville
"Hey, Fred!" Ron shouted across the crowded room. Fred waved and came squeezing through all those people.
"Well I for my part think he could have pulled himself together. Harry was right earlier when he said Malfoy couldn't just show up and expect everything is forgiven and forgotten." Ron interjected.
"No, actually I came to you first. I don't want to talk to Ron or Hermione about this until I'm completely sure about everything. And I know that I can trust you with things like that and that you can be very helpful."
He opened his eyes as Harry came in, but closed them again. Harry pulled on his pyjamas and lay down in his own bed. All was silent at first, and he wondered if he had dreamed it, but no, there it was again. A low, breathless sound, then a slow exhalation, as if Malfoy was hurt, or perhaps—
They said goodbye to Ginny and Fred and hurried out of the store before even more people could come up to Harry. This life was exhausting. Flattering, but exhausting.
Harry laughed and they both looked at Hermione, who didn't say anything since they had talked before class and looked straight ahead, not paying attention on what Harry and Ron talked about.
"Well, eventually they will know. I really want to tell my friends. At least Ron and Hermione," Potter said.
Understanding, Ron nodded and quickly changed the subject. "Want to see what Hermione and Ginny are doing?"
It must have been something about Teddy, but Malfoy didn't know that. His face changed immediately and he put on the familiar scowl.
Draco was glad he didn't have to order his lemonade himself, it would have been really embarrassing. A Death Eater drinking lemonade on a party full of people drinking alcohol.
Draco tried to make his throat work, but he couldn't. No words came out and he had no idea what he could say about that anyways. All that was in his head right now was Potter's face, his hips moving and his long moans.
Harry swam deeper and deeper. A choir of merpeople were singing in the middle, calling the champions towards them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.
"You remember the day I got letters?" Malfoy asked and when Harry nodded, he said, "I got two, remember? The two owls?" Harry nodded again. "One was from my father, whose response to you've already read. The other one was from my mother, I replied to her as well, but when you decided to look through my stuff, you grabbed the upper letter which was unfortunately the one to my father," Malfoy explained, still holding out the letter.
Harry stretched his neck to expose it more, and he could feel Draco's smirk on his skin. Harry didn't wantto break apart. He didn't want to tell Draco what he wanted to say. He didn't want to say what he wanted to say, but he had to.
"Who are you going with?", he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
"I'm not lucky that you kept me! What do you think my mother would say? She would've wanted her sister to take care of her son after she had died! She wouldn't want you to stuff me into a cupboard and then when I was twelve, put me into a room with
"And I swear to Merlin, before you, I never kissed someone before. I swear. But I'm quite satisfied that you think I'm kissing too good.", Draco added with a laugh.
Zabini groaned loudly, prompting Harry to kiss Draco even harder, wrapping his tongue around Draco's possessively. After Draco stopped fighting him, Harry released him and raised his head, pleased to find him looking dazed.
In the Great Hall, Draco immediately sat down on the Slytherin table. He knew Slytherins were going to be less popular than in the years before. The students filled the other tables and everyone sat down on their old tables. Potter sat on the table on the other side of the Hall, on the Gryffindor table. Draco realised that the table, where he himself sat at, was only half full. And he was afraid the table wouldn't fill any more. He started to miss Pansy and Goyle and Theo. Draco looked at the teacher's table and missed someone else. The seat of Professor Snape was occupied by Professor Slughorn, who hated Draco and Draco hated him. Professor- Headmistress McGonnagal walked up to the podium where Dumbledore used to give his speeches.
you are, but you're more than just flesh. We never talked much, but the last weeks where we haven't talked
"You are the stupid one here! Why don't you just accept it? Why? Is it so hard for you to understand that I really like him? What would you say if I say Hermione's a foul Mudblood no one likes? What would you say?", Harry bellowed out.
Draco, he was sure about that, but what was it then? He liked talking to him when they were alone in the dark. He liked kissing him- even though that doesn't mean
Harry saw what Ron meant - Draco sat on the couch, a good arms-length away from the girls, and watched them with a look in his eyes Harry had never seen before. Harry sat down and filled the gap between Draco and Hermione.
"I do." Malfoy answered "It was the slow song from that one muggle singer... what's he called again?"
There was a long moment of silence when no one really knew what to say. Draco had said everything he needed to say and Harry was really proud of him - so proud he even had tears in his eyes. Hermione was smiling and winked at Harry. Ron showed Harry thumbs-up without Draco noticing it, and Ginny just looked like she'd seen a creature from another world.
He didn't want to open the letter, he couldn't take any more. Draco felt his hands shaking. He hoped his mother would be more kind and understanding, she always was.
did he have to be gay? Did Draco actually stand a chance? Not that he was gay, but - was he? Was Draco gay? He had never quite liked girls, not the ones at Hogwarts anyways. He knew Pansy had liked him for a long time, but she'd given up after a while because she, too, figured that Draco didn't have
Draco felt a sharp pain in his chest and his eyes filled with tears. He didn't want to cry. He wasn't going to cry. Not here. He didn't know his mother and Potter were so close. Potter folded the paper again and packed it away, then pulled out another one.
Harry thanked her and got up. He grabbed the door handle, took a deep breath and went inside. The sky outside was painted in pink as the sun rose. Draco looked so small and fragile lying in his hospital bed. There were several monitors around the bed, measuring Malfoy's heartrate and blood pressure and oxygen levels. Harry stepped closer. He noticed that the healers have taken off his clothes and dressed him in a hospital robe. Draco's left forearm, where the faded Dark Mark was, was wrapped in bandages and he had several scratches on his face. Harry held back a sob as he took Draco's pale hand and didn't feel him squeezing back.
Malfoy sat on the couch while Harry got something to drink from the kitchen. Neither of them talked. Crookshanks noiselessly wandered around the livingroom and sniffed curiously every now and then. Harry put two glasses and a bottle of water on the couch table and sat down next to Malfoy, who awkwardly rubbed his palms on his knees. Harry smiled at that and filled the glasses with water. He didn't even expect Malfoy to say thanks, so he just gave him a glass and started to drink.
"They bullied and mocked each other all through our time at Hogwarts and longer," Ron said, "but that day we were at Diagon Alley and Harry told us he saw Draco, his face lit up in a way we haven't seen in quite a long time."
On Christmas Eve, Harry, Ron and Hermione took the Floo Powder to the Granger house. It was a very neat house (dentists...) and a lot of pictures of Hermione and her family, but also of her with Ron and Herry were sitting on the mantelpiece. Harry liked this place - it was quite the opposite from the Burrow, but it was nice. Hermione seemed very happy to spend yet another Christmas with her parents, considering the incidents last year.
Vernon didn't reply. Harry smiled sadly and let Hedwig out of her cage. Aunt Petunia brought food upstairs into Harry's room for the two of them and Draco shot her some frightening looks. It was not much to eat, but Harry was already used to it.
Harry's hand felt around the edge of his shirt, before plunging underneath, feeling every forbidden curve. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry's waist, pulling their groins together.
Harry shook his head. From where did he know what Malfoy smelled like? God, what was wrong with him?
Malfoy had already agreed to come to the Burrow, what Harry had immediately written to Mrs Weasley. Tomorrow, Harry would go to the Ministry and pick up a few papers and drop some off. He knew it was the holidays and he didn't need to do that, but he wanted to do his job right. On Christmas Eve, they were going to the Granger's.
Harry was aware that Malfoy was way less drunk than him - he barely drank anything all night - but Harry decided not to mention it.
Ginny and Hermione went upstairs and passed Charlie on the stairs as he was on his way down. He looked surprised when he saw Ron and Harry and laughed.
"Yes, you idiot. I will move in with you.", Draco answered and laughed as Potter flung his arms around him and peppered kissed all over his face.
He felt somehow strong after he'd said that, because it was the first time he stood up against his father and didn't do what he wanted.
Draco sneered after her, opened his book annoyed and started reading. He ignored Potter's two abnormally idiotic friends looking at him as Potter grabbed Draco's hand under the table.
Harry thought, but only because he didn't dare to think about Malfoy. Harry tilted his head back and closed his eyes. He needed to sleep.
Draco raised his eyebrows. Potter really knew how to get a guy. They walked up to the common room, which was luckily empty. Draco followed the Gryffindor to their room. Before they had even locked the door, they were all over each other. Kissing, grinding, moaning, sweating. They clothes left piece by piece. They were against the door, the wall, the desk, the bed. And finally
"Are you serious?", he asked and searched Draco's eye. But Draco kept his gaze to the floor and nodded.
Harry wasn't asked to until he, Ron and Hermione went upstairs to Ron's room and made themselves comfortable on the beds. Sitting cross legged on his bed, Harry shoved a chocolate frog into his mouth. When he saw the expectant look in Hermione's eyes, Harry sighed. Now was the time to talk about it and they wouldn't let him get away this time.
Malfoy just nodded slowly. Harry was kind of proud that Malfoy didn't start to shout or insult Ron as he normally would have done. Ron looked from Malfoy to Harry to Hermione and back to Malfoy. Harry felt that Malfoy was holding Harry's hand tighter than before.
Hermione smiled and hugged Harry tightly. "Write us." She said as if Harry would go on a year-long journey.
Ron let out a relieved sigh and Harry laughed again. Ron was obviously very uncomfortable with the situation. Harry glanced outside and saw that Hermione was talking to Malfoy, who looked very pale and sat stiffly.
"You should be, you've been studying for it for the last few years. Well not last year, we've been a bit occupied there," Ron said and everyone -except Malfoy- laughed.
"He was in the Order of the Phoenix. He was the best friend of my parents and after...", Harry swallowed, "after Sirius' death, he was always there for me."
Now, he wasn't in there, so they had the room for them alone. They sat down on Ron's bed and Hermione looked expectantly at Harry, who felt strangely nervous. He breathed out and closed his eyes, practicing what he could say next.
"Fine. But Pomfrey went me out and said Potter needs rest. So no visitors till three p.m.", Draco told them and Weasley's shoulders sunk.
Again, Harry nodded. He closed his eyes for a second to gather his thoughts. Tears rolled down Harry's face, but he wouldn't let Draco know, he didn't want him to think he put Harry in a horrible position. After all, Harry
He had been in a too bad mood to make the effort and put on his pyjama bottoms and he lost the safety of the blankets ad he stood up.
Malfoy only shrugged and Harry shook his head with a light smile. He pulled out a box of macaroni and grabbed the rest of the ingredients from the fridge.
Draco looked after Potter, who turned around a corner and vanished out of sight. Draco slapped himself. What was that please? Had he completely lost his mind? Draco breathed out and slowly walked to their room.
Harry came back to the surface of the water. Draco clutched Harry's arm and panted. He coughed just as much as Harry did.
Harry lied. Someday Harry had to tell them, he had to tell them what was between him and Malfoy. But how could he, if he himself didn't even know what there was between them? Harry sighed. When they reached the Great Hall, you could already hear the buzz of voices from hundreds of excited students in the corridor.
There were quite a few students that have lost friends or family in the war and with every person, Harry found more confidence and better encouragements. He noticed that there have been only two Slytherins to seek his advice, but he wasn't surprised, given the fact he had one sitting at home with just the same communication issues. A look at the clock told Harry it was getting late and the students should probably go to bed soon, but he didn't want to deny anyone some comforting words.
"I'm sorry, I-" Draco started and tightened the grip on Harry's hand, "I just haven't thought about it. Or at least I didn't let myself think about it."
"Yeah, I guess so." Harry said shrugging, "I was up against fame, hate and Voldemort from all sides."
He screwed his face up in the darkness. He didn’t want to think about this – Malfoy stroking himself with those long fingers, his body jerking into his own fist...
Harry didn't know what to do. It would be creepy walking up to Malfoy now that he had his eyes closed, but it would be even creepier if Malfoy would open his eyes and see Harry standing there watching him. Before Harry could even decide what he was going to do, he heard Malfoy talk.
The third task was today. Thanks to Dobby, Harry had found out, how he was going to survive one hour under water. Draco didn't even show up to wish Harry good luck or something. Ron already stood with Neville, Dean and Seamus on the platform, watching the four champions jump into the cold water.
Potter had never said this before to him and in the shine of the moonlight, Draco could see that Potter was blushing.
. This word hasn't been used since the war and this wasn't a word Draco wanted himself or Potter to be described as.
"It's a good thing you're doing, Harry." Dumbledore said with a proud look on his face, "I'm happy to see you use your fame and experience for good."
Draco grabbed Harry's hand and Harry lay his other hand on Draco's waist and they started dancing to the slow song. Madame Maxime and Dumbledore danced close to Draco and Harry and Dumbledore winked at Harry. He smiled back and concentrated on the steps.
Harry told her how Teddy was doing and about himself and Malfoy and that he threw him out, to what Ron commented "
, Draco thought sarcastically. He rolled his eyes while shoving a spoon full of cereal in his mouth.
"Morning.", Harry said and sat down next to Ron. He looked at Ginny, nodded shortly and the looked away. Ginny rolled her eyes.
Harry walked around Sugarplum's, really looking more for Malfoy than for sweets. Harry was disappointed when he couldn't find him, but his mood was quickly lifted as he saw Ron putting box after box in his bag. Harry laughed, what made Ron turn his attention towards him.
Once they were out of Ron's and Hermione's sight, the two boys went back to the Three Broomsticks. To Harry's surprise Malfoy ordered a hot chocolate instead of the famous Butterbeer.
"Because you heard that Potter would be here as well." Theo said as if he knew what he was talking about.
"The war left Hogwarts in shattered pieces, but strong wizards, including Harry Potter are about to build it up again, brick by brick. Potter recently told in an interview that he was happy to have the opportunity to help his friends and former teachers to build up their home again, because Hogwarts is and will always be his home."
After the second Sorting, Draco didn't care about the feast anymore, he stood up and walked outside, where he met the last person he wanted to see.
Potter was silent and Draco suffered a momentary panic attack, thinking Potter was changing his mind, and then with the grace of a troll quickly scrambled beneath the covers, sitting next to Draco. He was cold as ice.
Malfoy left the Hall quite early, Harry noticed. But he decided to ignore the Slytherin boy and he kept eating. After Harry, Hermione and Ron had finished, they stood up and left the Great Hall as well.
Harry did know. They would always start telling stories and Hermione would be embarrassed, but glad to have them back.
dick and squeezed it a bit. Hearing Potter moan turned Draco on so much he just had to lick the tip. He couldn't help himself. All of a sudden an invisible force pulled his mouth down and he almost choked on Potter's equipment. Potter chuckled a bit.
"No. Draco, come on. After all, it's me you're thinking of. Tell me.", Potter said and looked down at Draco.
Draco didn't know the owl that was knocking with its beak against his window. He opened it and the owl gently hootet and held out its foot where a letter was attached. Draco immediately suspected it was from Potter. And when he read it, he found that he was right. Potter had written that Draco could come over after six p.m. and he had left an address. Draco didn't think he had to write back. He got the message and would do as he was told, even though it wasn't really his way.
So Harry lay down flat on the floor and looked under Malfoy's bed, but nothing but his trunk was under there, not even dusk. Harry sat up. He remembered that Malfoy had put the box in his closet the day Harry had first seen it. So he started to look there. But there was nothing but black clothes- black shirts, black pullovers, black suits, black jackets, black pants, plack shoes, black socks and black boxer shorts. Harry decided to give up.
Today was the day of the trial. When Draco got up, he had a strange feeling in his stomach. Something was going to happen that day, but he didn't know what and he didn't care to find out. All he wanted was to survive another day and get another day closer to Hogwarts, closer to seeing Potter again. Draco didn't know why he was so desperate to see the idiot again, but somehow Draco missed Potter's green eyes that looked like a toad and his stupid, stupid scar.
"Why do you care now? What does it matter to you? You have your friends and your pride and your name and what have I? I have my father, who gives not one fuck about me and my mother who is annoying like hell and I have four friends that are not on my school anymore and one of my best friends is dead. The other students here hate me and no one wants a death eater going to the same school. And I hate myself for the things I have done the last years. Everyone hates me!", Malfoy's voice shouted in Harry's head.
He went around and hugged the rest of his friends - Ginny, Neville and Dean - while Ron and Hermione held onto each other. When they started kissing, the rest of the group laughed and cheered.
Harry opened the package and grabbed his frog before it could jump out and leave. Harry bit off the head of the frog and let the chocolate melt in his mouth. He felt less awkward than he had expected. Malfoy ate his licorice wand and the two of them just looked at the field in front of them. The weather was cold, but Harry felt warm.
"I swear to Merlin, if you should poison me, I will haunt you in your dreams.", Malfoy's voice spoke in Harry's head.
"Goodness, you are so sweet!", Potter said and wanted to sit up to kiss Draco, but Draco held him back.
Harry rolled onto his back and slowly opened his eyes. The room was still dark. He put his arm on the pillow beside him. Then, nervously, Harry's eyes widened and he felt the bed. Malfoy wasn't there! Harry sat up quickly and groped for his glasses. /Where was he?/, Harry wondered. He got up and snuck downstairs, trying not to wake Ron. Harry rolled his eyes. They have forgotten to turn off the kitchen light before they have gotten to bed. But before Harry could round the corner to the kitchen, he heard Ron laugh. Harry didn't want to eavesdrop, but if Ron was laughing in the middle of the night in the kitchen, Harry had a right to know why.
His voice actually made Harry calm down. He breathed in and out slowly and tried to relax, what wasn't really easy with Malfoy being so close to him, in a dark corridor, outside Snape's classroom.
But Harry and Draco shook their heads. This wasn't the time to hold hands. Besides, Malfoy had never been a fan of display of affection - if it was in public or in private. But Harry was fine with that. He knew Draco loved him and Draco knew it too.
, you must know that I mean it. I don't ask you to understand this and I don't ask you to be nice to me, I just want you to support Potter as much as you can. Because unlike me, he is your friend, and friends are there to support each other. I would love to have someone I can tell about us, but no one cares and those who would care would put me in a cellar and let me starve to death."
"Draco, my dear.", she said and hugged Draco. He smelled her familiar strong perfume which he had missed so much.
Harry didn't know what to do. They wouldn't find out more, after everyone they knew stayed at the pub. He looked through the chats again but didn't find anything interesting. Then he thought he could look through the pictures, maybe there would be something. Malfoy watched every movement Harry's thumbs made on the screen. As soon as Harry had opened his gallery, he stared at Malfoy.
Harry didn't quite know what to answer, after all, Ron was right. Harry really had been sure about Malfoy being a Death Eater and in the end Harry found it to be true, but he completely forgot about that and he didn't like Ron reminding him of it.
On the picture were four men standing. Draco recognised the messed up hair again and suspected it was James. But the others were strangers. One was tall and handsome. He had shoulder-long black hair and dark grey eyes. He held the hand of a smaller boy, a boy with brown hair and brown eyes. This boy had a scarred face, but smiled happily. The fourth boy was the smallest of the four. He had dark brown hair and was a bit specky.
Harry thought maybe Draco waited for Harry to kiss him, but Harry wasn't sure and he didn't want to do anything wrong, so they stood there for a minute and looked at each other, both of them unsure of what to do.
"Since he came to our family, he just brought bad luck. Horrible things happened that never happened, before this silly old man Dumbledore left him to us! I should've brought him to an orphanage!", Vernon said angrily.
Malfoy looked at him with his mouth open. Harry looked at him and frowned at the sight of Malfoy's stern grey eyes. But then, the grey eyes softened.
Draco kept looking, but as soon as he opened Potter's closet he got immediate eye cancer and closed it again. So much colour! A thousand knitted sweaters and a lot of red and yellow shirts and blue and green and- ugh. Not one single black item was in there. Draco rubbed his eyes. He grabbed his book and lay back dow on Potter's bed. Draco wanted to get used to laying here. His own bed looked even neater from this perspective. And Potter's was even messier up close.
"I will keep you updated from now on. I will tell you everything Potter tells me, I will spare no detail, I think I might have played him good. Mother and I are going to visit the Parkinsons and Goyles during the holidays, so they will know as well.
Harry could see in Malfoy's eyes that he had said just the right thing. He took Malfoy's hand and smiled comforting.
Draco walked towards the library, the last meters, he broke into a run. He had to know if this was Potter. He stepped in and looked around.
Closing his eyes and burying his face in the pillows was tempting, but childish. Draco turned around slowly to face whoever had called him.
These damn girls! They should all go to hell. Including Ginny. She could be the first one in the queue to meet the devil.
"Pull yourself together, Draco!", he said loudly. Harry wondered what was wrong with him, but then he remembered that it was Malfoy inside there and so Harry didn't want to find out.
Unfortunately, Draco shook his head. "I don't. I mean I've seen them before, probably in the war somewhere, but I can't really place them."
Harry refocused and looked down. Suddenly Harry started laughing. He was standing in a puddle of lemonade and even though Malfoy had stepped back, his socks were wet.
Dumbledore cleared his throat and everyone turned their faces towards him. He had a kind smile on his face and his light blue eyes gazed over his halfmoon spectacles. Harry had to hold back a smile - Dumbledore would never change. When he opened his mouth, though, Harry's smile vanished.
"How are you these days?", the headmistress asked. Draco tried to smile but McGonnagal was not that easy to be fooled.
"That one advantage you have because you're so hot." Malfoy said under his breath, but Harry heard it anyway.
Harry nodded and followed Malfoy up the impressive stone stairs. This part of the Manor was new to Harry. The wide hallway was as dimly lit as the one downstairs, but there were fewer paintings. There was one of what seemed to be another Malfoy, considering the hair was just as silver as Draco's and his parent's. And they even walked past a portrait of Draco himself. Harry stopped in front of it and grinned. Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Now Harry understood the effect the sound of his name had had on Draco. His whole body felt like it was weightless, he felt like he was flying. All he wanted to do was kiss Draco.
"Excuse me, Professor Slughorn. I have Matt here, he couldn't find the classroom," Harry said politely and smiled.
Draco tried hard to see things from the Gryffindors' perspective and he figured, that Weasley might have been right. Maybe it
"Good boy, very hard working, I like that." Mr Weasley said and entertained Teddy a little with a rubber duck. "So, I guess you left my lazy son at home then?"
Harry nodded wordless. He didn't want to see the rest of this video, it could destroy his illusion of the perfect sex they had had. Malfoy didn't say a word, same as Harry. Harry looked at the blonde and realised that he was looking at their hands. Harry thought it would make Malfoy uncomfortable, so he wanted to pull his hand away, but Malfoy held it tight. Harry held back a smile.
On Wednesday, Harry had the whole day off but he had decided to drop by the Ministry and pick up some papers. Malfoy hadn't slept at Harry's for the night, so Harry only left Ron a note in the morning. He grabbed a toast for himself and a banana for Teddy and put on his jacket. It had been raining non-stop for three days now and the sky was almost as dark as at night. Harry held Teddy in his arm and they took the Floo Network to the Ministry of Magic. Luckily Teddy was such a calm baby, what made it easy for Harry to take him with to the Ministry for a short period of time.
"Potter?", Malfoy asked and looked at him, but Harry avoided his eyes. He felt paralysed. One thousand pictures rushed into his head. He could hear one specific person laugh.
As always, Blaise sat with his new friends. Draco simply couldn't understand how Blaise could forget all his values so easily. Draco sat down in his usual lonely spot at the Slytherin table and watched everyone else while he bit into his carrot. His eye fell on Potter, sitting at the table across the Hall and talking to his friends. Arse.
"You are family now. But if you ever hurt him, I will torture you with the Cruciatus Curse for days and days until I finally kill you with a whip of my wand."
"I didn't? Oh I really didn't?" Malfoy said loudly, almost shouting, "I told you what my favorite ice cream was!"
His silvery hair shone in its old shine. He stemmed himself in his beloved walking stick with the silver snakes head, which he held in his right hand. Draco swallowed and gripped Potter's hand tighter.
They sat in silence for a while, Harry felt his cheeks burning. He didn't know if he should keep talking or if Draco had heard enough, but he couldn't stop himself.
Harry stood at the bar with a drink in his hand and watched Draco dance with Seamus and Ginny while Hermione danced with Pansy. Harry smiled and emptied his glass. He grabbed a pair of headphones from beneath the bar and plucked them into his mp3 player. He selected a song and put them on Draco's head.
Harry's heart made a jump and he gasped. Draco giggled and it was the cutest thing Harry had ever heard. Draco pulled away and grinned.
"I thought I could trust that you wouldn't behave like this." Harry replied, his own voice getting louder too, "But obviously I can't."
There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainty, and looked around - there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate:
"No I'm quite sure it wasn't any of your friends, Potter. I would recognize these little weirdos just too quickly." Draco assured him.
Harry looked over to the Slytherin table, where only a few students were sitting. Most of the Slytherins didn't come back to Hogwarts because of what had happened in the war. Harry searched for a familiar face, but he spotted him nowhere.
Harry and Ron looked at each other, nodded and followed Hermione into the classroom. The teacher looked at them.
The blonde bartender was gone for about half an hour after they arrived, and so was Blaise. Draco looked around and tried to find Pansy, but there were too many people, it was too dark and he couldn't shout because no one would hear him over the loud music that was hurting his ears. Theo had checked up on Draco once and had asked why he didn't want to take that girl.
It turned out that Ginny, Hermione, Angelina and Fleur were trying on dresses for Ginny's birthday party, so they wouldn't let Ron and Harry inside, what led them to going back downstairs. Mr Weasley still wasn't there, what made Mrs Weasley nervous.
"Because I have to sit alone and people will stare at me with their death glares because they hate me and after yesterday, they hate me even more. Or I have to sit with you and your friends and I can't stand them. I can't stand Weasel or Granger or Longbottom the idiot. I can't stand any of them and they can't stand me. Or you and me sit alone and I can't stand that either. I love to eat with you and without you it feels lonely, but if you and me sit at the same table as your friends and you're not allowed to talk to them, I would hurt you and them because they would think that you prefer me- what you do, but...- and I would hate myself even more.", Draco finished, taking a breath.
Harry shook his head. He threw the letter onto Malfoy's bed and ran out, ignoring how much everything hurt.
He couldn't say it. He couldn't say it. He couldn't say it. He had to say it. But he couldn't say it.
Harry got up and walked to the tearoom, where a few other people stood and talked or made tea themselves. Harry smiled at them and filled two cups with hot water, put in the teabags and walked back to Malfoy.
During the whole train ride, many students passed their compartment and peeked inside, some opened the door and asked for an autograph from Harry and some just stood there and watched him like he was some kind of animal in a zoo, until Hermione told them more or less politely to leave him alone. Harry slept most of the time because he had to catch up the sleep he didn't get last night. He had some crazy dreams. One was about Malfoy running across the school yard to Harry and Harry flinched because he thought Malfoy was going to hex him, but Malfoy only shook hands with Harry. One was about Ron throwing things against a wall and Hermione sat next to him on a chair and levitated all the things and carefully placed them on the floor. Weird dreams.
Harry lay down on his bed and put Teddy on his stomach. Harry calmed Teddy down and stoked his soft hair. Draco reached out for Teddy's small hand and took it carefully, looking at Harry with big eyes. Harry had butterflies in his stomach and fog in his head.
"Guess you'll have to tell Granger we'll be only three." Theo said, sitting down in his worn-out armchair.
Rather drunk, Draco, Potter, Weasley and Granger sat on the red carpet in front of the fireplace and sipped mulled wine. They told each other anecdotes from back at Hogwarts, most of them either not including Draco at all or a mean thing he had done.
Licking his lips, Draco brushed away a dark strand from the tender spot near Potter's ear and then pressed a small kiss to the skin. He licked it, grazed it with his teeth, and when Potter shivered and moaned quietly, Draco trapped the skin between his lips and sucked on it lightly.
"I'm sorry, boys, but I promised Ginny I would meet her in the library.", Hermione said apologising. Harry nodded smiling.
"Mister Harry Potter. You are back. How wonderful. Mister Draco couldn't stand eating without you.", one elf said.
Draco sighed. Holidays. That was another thing he didn't want to think about. Potter wasn't even thinking about spending Christmas with Draco even though all of his friends' couples were together. Draco didn't want to spend Christmas with Potter as well. He wasn't sure if he would be comfortable spending two entire weeks with Harry Potter. Also, Draco was sure that he would kill Potter after a week, he was already too stressed being non-stop in the same room with Potter for two days.
Harry's eyes shot up at Malfoy's and he nodded. They pushed themselves through the crowd. Harry saw Ron and Hermione kissing. Neville's eyes found Harry's and he shot Harry a questioning look. Harry just smiled and shrugged, even though he didn't think Neville could see the shrug.
And indeed, he stood up and grabbed his school uniform. Harry followed him into the bathroom. Malfoy turned around. "What are you doing?" He asked irritated.
"No. I won't. Mom, he hates me. I said things I didn't want to, but I was hurt and stupid.", he answered.
"Bloody great party!" As Harry spoke, he noticed his words weren't as clear as he had wished them to be.
Potter's hand loosened and Draco turned  away again. Potter stood there, staring at Draco. He didn't say anything. Draco felt more uncomfortable with every second, but-
Draco pulled away and fumbled with Harry's boxer shorts. His hands were shaking and Harry held them.
Harry walked over to her and sat down in a comfortable chair on the other side of her desk. McGonnagal closed the book she was reading and shoved it aside.
When Draco woke up, his heart was racing already. He knew what was going to happen today and he was bloody excited about it. He jumped up and joined Theo in the living room.
"Are you okay?" He asked concerned while he cleaned the bed with a spell. Draco shrugged. "Just tell me want you're thinking," Potter offered.
and after a while, everyone else joined in. Harry put his head on Draco's shoulder and closed his eyes. This was what real happiness felt like. As Harry opened his eyes again, Ron and Hermione danced by them and gave him a thumbs-up. Harry grinned. Ginny and Dean looked happy as well when they danced, so did Pansy and Theo. Harry's jaw dropped, however, when his eyes fell on a different pair.
"I love your hair. No matter how it is, you know? Your hair is the most perfect hair I have ever seen or felt. It's so soft and smells so good and the colour is so perfect! Your hair is amazing, honestly! But the first time I came in
"Well there you go." He said and clapped his hands, "So now you can at least forget about the issue with his mother."
"Yes. Besides, kissing you is more effective than these disgusting potions. A tasty kiss would heal me.", said Potter and smiled smugly.
"Yes." Draco answered and carried on hanging up the black suits. He took out his black underwear and placed it in his closet as well.
But then Draco looked at Potter, really looked at him. And Draco smiled. Potter's hair was ruffled and his feet were buried under a red Gryffindor blanket. He had a half-smile on his lips and his chest was rising and falling slowly and calmly. Draco had no idea how to react. Of course Potter didn't do it on purpose, but this was just weird. Draco decided to just let him sleep and hoped Potter would wake up before his mates came home.
With that she wanted to tell him that his rightful chair was at the end of the table, but Draco shook his head. He couldn't imagine him sitting where
Harry and Ron grinned. They all gathered around the table, Mr Weasley and George joined as well. The food was amazing. Mrs Weasley really had a talent for that.
Pansy tried to involve Draco in a conversation about school, but Draco never knew how to answer her.
Harry snapped out of his thoughts and nodded absently. "It's just-" He sighed, "It's the Slytherins, you know? Thing like that never ended well."
But a spell that electrocuted people? That was one too much. Harry suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his chest, either from standing too long or from being electrocuted.
Harry shrugged. "I don't know. We went into the Drawing Room and then everything just came up. I couldn't just be there and pretend nothing was bothering or hurting me. Because all of it was. All of it was hurting me, the colour on the walls, the chandeliers, the stairs..."
"Hey, Harry's here." Ron shouted into the living room after he had stuck his head out of the kitchen door.
"Hey, boys!", she said and snipped with her finger in front of their faces. Harry blinked irritated.
"Who said I even want to look for him?" Harry said annoyed. Why couldn't they just let him do his thing?
Luckily, Harry and Malfoy were sober enough to stand straight and walk without supporting each other. They grabbed their brooms on the way out. The streets were empty and the air was chilly. Harry froze a bit, but the alcohol made him forget about it.
Draco took Harry's hand and pulled him to the desk, Draco sat on the last time he was here. They sat down next to each other and Draco looked Harry deep in the eyes.
and gave it to Ron, who read it himself in silence. They watched the sun rising and sipped their tea as it began to rain outside.
This seemed to reassure Hermione, but Harry could see she wasn't going to let it go any time soon. Harry sighed. He sipped his hot coffee. Five hours of sleep didn't seem enough for Harry nowadays, but he hoped until Malfoy was coming, he would he wide awake again. None of the three said anything for a while. The birds sang and some gardens away someone watered their grass.
To his surprise, Hermione and Ron didn't laugh as much as he'd thought, but he guessed it just wasn't that funny.
Of course they knew him. Blaise, Pansy, Theo and Greg had to listen to Draco for seven years to whine about Potter. Lucius served the man who wanted to kill Potter and his mother did so too.
Harry turned on his heel and stepped into his bathroom. He was glad that he didn't have to share the bathroom with anyone while Ron and Hermione used the other one together. Harry stripped down his flying gear and stepped into the shower, turning on the water. Harry wet his hair and body, scrubbing it with soap and finally stepped out again. Wrapped in a towel, Harry took his wand and shaved his stubbly beard with the help of magic. Even though Harry knew that combing his hair was unnecessary, he tried it anyways, what made it stand out in even more directions than before. He sighed and put on his clothes.
The three friends noticed Malfoy sitting in front of the fireplace and their laughter stopped and nobody talked. Malfoy turned around and stood up.
"Yes, but only for this year. What about the years after? No one will ever know they sleep in the very same bed Harry Potter used to sleep in."
"My mother told me about this party. Said it was no good.", a boy said and Draco could feel his eyes following him.
"You know what's funny?", Malfoy asked and Harry shook his head, "I wouldn't care if he killed me, but he would rather kill you. And that's what I couldn't stand."
In his lunch break, Draco went back to the common room, where he found a stack of freshly printed Daily Prophets. The headline:
Harry woke up at night and looked around. Though the room was dark, Ron's snores showed him he was still there. Harry's bed, however, was empty. He put on his glasses and grabbed his wand. Whispering, "Lumos" Harry got up and walked downstairs. He stopped when he saw the light in the living room was still on. Harry didn't want to eavesdrop once again, he expected Mr and Mrs Weasley talking.
After a moment, Draco let go of Harry's hand. "My father and aunt were there." He said, "She killed him, didn't she?"
"Andromeda!" Harry's eyes rushed from her face to Draco, Teddy on his hip, to Ron and Hermione and back to Andromeda. "What- What are you doing here? Did we arrange something?"
"Ron and Hermione are coming soon. Draco, would you please stop testing how stable this table is? Thank you.", Harry said and rolled his eyes.
They greeted the rest of their friends who waited for them on the side walk - even the Slytherins were there. The party was already in full swing when they came inside. They first ordered a round of drinks before they  joined the crowd on the dance floor. Harry watched his friends and Draco's friends talk to each other, some of them wearing displeased looks, but they were being civil. Draco grinned and raised his eyebrows, what made Harry laugh.
"How about favorite Quidditch team?" Harry asked and the following answer would be very important to him.
"Hermione, drop it please. I'll tell you later." Potter continued, "Yes. Yes. Sleep well. You too." He closed the thing again and put it back in his pocket.
Harry understood. Ron and the rest of the Weasley's had wished for Harry and Ginny to be together for ever.
Harry rolled his eyes and put on his pyjama. "I'm not going to sleep in my trousers and you don't have to either. I've seen you in your boxershorts, remember?"
He couldn't ask her. He couldn't. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him. The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them. He wanted to have it behind him as quickly as possible.
Draco was so obsessed with the article that he didn't even realise class had already started. He decided it would be time to concentrate on something else,
Harry told him that there had been a misunderstanding but that he had apologized and they had made up. Neville grinned. "I can't believe it. You finally made up."
"I need air. I need to get out. Just- leave me alone for a while," Draco answered and closed the door behind himself.
Harry shot a glare at Zabini and grabbed Draco's chin and forced him to look up. Draco had no time to say a word or even blink before Harry pressed a forceful kiss to his lips, pushing his tongue into Draco's mouth, headless of Draco's attempts to pull back.
Anna nodded and walked away, her high heels clacking on the marble floor. The store had big windows through which the sunlight beamed inside. Harry and his friends looked around. Seamus pulled out several clothes he liked, but Harry put a lot of them back because he wasn't so fond of them. Ron laughed at Harry when he tried on a shining silvery blouse.
Draco dragged his fingers lightly through the curls at the base of Potter's cock, and Potter let out a sound like steam escaping from a kettle. Potter's cock jerked as Draco pushed his knees apart and wanked the full length of his shaft, slow and intense. Potter tried to thrust upwards, but Draco pushed him back down.
He hurried through the traveling section and crouched behind spell books for beginners. If Theo would see him like this...
Harry sighed. He told her about rooming with Draco and how it went. He didn't tell her the private things, but all in all she knew a lot after their talk.
Harry noticed that Malfoy's eyes left Harry's face and stopped at the hickey, so Harry lifted his cup and took a great sip of hot tea, what burned in his throat and his lungs, but Harry tried not to whine or do anything to attract Malfoy's attention to the fact that Harry had just burned himself. He coughed a little, put the cup back on the table and decided that it was necessary to talk now.
"Don't be. They just show how I survived," Potter said seriously, pointing at the scar on his forehead.
by Malfoy being unfriendly? It seemed like Harry was expecting Malfoy to be nice. Harry turned around and wanted to walk away, but before he could take the first step, Malfoy said, "Hey, Potter."
"What's wrong?", Harry asked and was afraid that he actually got pranked. But not even Malfoy was that mean.
"Ferret!", Potter called as he danced into their room. Draco looked up as he closed his trunk and smiled.
His mother was right. She was so right. Draco should talk to Potter, but the problem was that Draco was a fucking coward and he was never brave enough to say what was on his mind.
Hermione laughed softly and shook her head. "No, you're all clear. Harry just wanted to talk to Malfoy and I thought it would be nice for the two of us to go out."
Harry walked towards Hermione, who held the book in her hands and stared at it. Harry just saw a normal book. Okay, maybe the book was newer than the others in this library, but what was Hermione so freaking out about? Harry shot a helpful look at Ron, who came over as well and inspected it. He looked at Harry and shrugged.
The next morning, Harry waited until Draco was awake and they went downstairs together to get breakfast. Malfoy seemed to get along with everyone and Harry had completely forgotten about the thing he had heard the night before. They went home after breakfast, but they would see Ginny, Angelina and George that evening at the Christmas ball.
The group walked mostly in silence. Draco felt really uncomfortable and like he didn't belong with them at all. On their way, the by-passers told them to wish Potter good luck and to get well soon. Draco, on the other hand, was never addressed, he was just frowned upon. By the time they reached the doors of the hospital wing, Draco decided he wasn't going be grumpy anymore and appreciate that his... Potter was getting out.
Draco smiled too and finally Potter closed the space between their lips. Draco melted into the kiss. He missed everything.
Over the last few days, Potter has made a lot of attempts to talk to Draco. He wanted to help with Draco's homework, tried talking when they were in bed so Draco couldn't just walk away, he even talked through the door when Draco was taking a shower. He had said he couldn't understand what was going on and he thought they were fine and so on and on. Potter had rambled on for about fifteen minutes until Draco had stepped out of the bathroom and walked past him without a word.
Harry and Draco jumped up and put on their pullovers. Harry told Ron he could uncover his eyes, but as soon as Ron did, he put his hand right back up.
Harry put on his pyjama and waited on his bed until Malfoy came out. And when he did, he ignored Harry completely. Harry brushed his teeth and lay down. No word came from the other bed. It seemed like the progress they had made over the last few weeks was vanished.
Draco opened the door a bit and peeked outside. "Don't look," he ordered and without asking, Potter put his hands in front of his eyes. Draco slipped into the dorm and quickly searched for black underwear and a pair of pants. He held it in front of his crotch and grabbed a towel. With the towel in one hand and the clothes in the other he jumped back into the bathroom, locked the door behind himself and started getting dressed.
With that, he grabbed his broom and was out the door. He smiled to himself. As bad as it was lying to his friends, he was curious to see what Malfoy had had in mind when he suggested that they would meet each other. Soaring through the air, Harry saw Malfoy was already waiting for him and Harry had to smile.
"It looks nice, Draco. Sit down.", she said smiling and pointed at the two chairs Harry and Draco had been sitting on the previous day.
He slowly and carefully turned his head to see Malfoy sleeping right next to him. Harry's left arm had been falling asleep in Malfoy's grip and Harry held Malfoy's hand with his right one in his lap. Harry widened his eyes and turned back to look at Hermione again. Luckily Ron either wasn't awake yet or at least not in the room. Harry couldn't imagine how Ron would react if he would see Harry and Malfoy like this. To be honest, Harry couldn't quite imagine how Malfoy himself would react.
Draco woke up because his back started to ache. It took him a second to realize where he was. The hospital wing was dark and cold, only the sleeping Potter next to him was warming Draco's body. The moon shone bright outside and illuminated the room a bit. Draco's arm had fallen asleep a long time ago, it felt heavy and ticklish, but Draco didn't dare to move it because he didn't want Potter to wake up. Draco shivered and turned his head to look at Potter. He was very cute when he was asleep. Draco smiled.
"Well, because I always forget things, you know? I really have it under control now but during exams everything just- poof."
Headmistress Minerva McGonnagal had decided to put two students from different houses together and, of course, how could it be different, Harry had to share a room with Malfoy. Out of all students, he had to live with
"I know I wasn't alone in the war, I had a lot of people by my side - Ron and Hermione and the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army, but I felt alone. I had to be the one that had to die, it was me alone against Voldemort."
. Also, as far as Harry remembered, Malfoy was the reason Harry was even in here. But Harry didn't want to get angry right now, he figured it would be a good time to tell Ron about Malfoy, now that they were alone and probably won't be long if Hermione was going to get everyone else.
Hours later, Draco got an idea. He stood up and left his room. No one was in the common room, so Draco walked outside and across the grounds. Draco sneaked into the kitchen. All the elves froze and stared at him.
Back at home, Harry carried Teddy to the fluffy carpet and his toys and emptied his bag on the living room table. Harry was expecting Ron to come downstairs when he heard footsteps.
Malfoy made an understanding sound and looked around. Harry smiled at how awkward Malfoy felt. They stood in silence for a few minutes, brooms in their hands.
They lay in comfortable silence next to each other. Draco traced his finger over the scar on Potter's arm, somehow feeling sorry for him.
"You should have them all the time. Everywhere.", Draco grinned. Potter raised his head sharply and treated Draco to a breathtaking kiss.
She smiled at Potter and waited for him to say something, but he didn't even look at her. He looked at the menu card, while the woman clicked with her tongue until Potter looked up. She smiled even wider and blushed. Draco could punch her in the face.
Harry wanted to get up, but stopped to think. Was it wise to look through Malfoy's stuff? Harry was sure he wouldn't find anything, he hadn't even found the mysterious box yet. But Harry needed to know. So he got up, listened if maybe Malfoy was coming back already, but after no sound reached Harry's ear, he walked over to Malfoy's bedside table. Harry just
Harry stepped back and Narcissa came out. She looked at Harry shortly and stalked away. Harry stood there and didn't know what to do.
So Draco made his way up to the new tower, where he walked towards his room, hoping Potter wouldn't be there. But when Draco opened the door, he got disappointed. Not only Potter was there, no, Potter and
Water. Harry needed water. He slowly got up and made sure he wasn't feeling sick. When everything inside Harry felt still, he walked through the living room over to the kitchen. It looked just like when Harry had been here for the very first time. Sirius's chair wasn't sit on since he had died. This house was filled with so many memories of Sirius, Harry just couldn't bring himself to sell it. It had been the Order's secret hiding place for so long, Harry couldn't even imagine not being here.
Nobody said anything for the rest of lunch. In the evening when the sun set, Harry put Teddy in the small crib next to his bed and took a shower while the others made themselves comfortable on the couch. Harry came back downstairs to find Ron, Ginny and Hermione standing at the front door.
Draco laughed and stood up, so did the other boy. They sat down on the floor opposite of each other. Draco smiled again.
Moving against each other, Harry started to move their hips faster, picking up speed as they both felt their climaxes approaching.
He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. Harry felt the sun gently burning on his skin and was glad he didn't get sunburned very fast. The air smelled of Hermione's flowers. Even though Harry couldn't see them, he knew Hermione and Ron exchanged looks. He sighed again.
"No, Ron. I won't accept this git stealing my best friend!", Granger said and now everything came clear to Draco's mind.
"What are you doing?", he asked and watched Harry walking over to his bedside table, from where he took out his wand.
Potter hesitated, then opened the book slowly. On the first page was a picture of a small boy, he was eleven years old, Draco noticed the Hogwarts Express in the background. The boy had shoulder-long black curled hair and was very handsome.
be familiar. Malfoy had never been nice, Malfoy had never been there for Harry. So Harry decided to tell him.
"Eww, okay! I got it! No details!", Ron said and pressed his hands onto his ears as Harry started talking about Draco's cock. Harry lauged.
They sat there for a long time and just laughed. They talked about Hermione and how fucked up they were because of their upcoming N.E.W.T.s and Ron calmed Harry down because he was so excited for the get-together with Draco's parents and friends.
When he saw Potter and his friends getting up, Draco shoved the last piece of potato into his mouth and got up as well. He walked faster until he was next to the group.
He pulled himself out of his dream. "Fuck!", Harry cursed silently. Why did he have to have a boner right now? Why? He rolled his eyes and grabbed his wand.
He was right, Harry couldn't go to bed without having eaten something first. Harry nodded slowly and sat back down.
"Why is it strange, hm? Could you two please tell me what's going on inside you heads?", Harry asked annoyed.
But when he came back to his room after dinner, he knew. His heart skipped a beat as he saw Draco sitting on his bed, his hair geled back and his eyes hushing over the page of a book.
"And you don't think they will all wear suits?" Sam asked and tucked a little at the hem of the suit.
Just as he had said it, Pomfrey came around the curtain. "Good, you are here," she said and didn't give anything away that Draco had left only a few hours ago. "So, you're his roommate?" She asked Draco directly and he nodded, "Fine. Then I have to take you with me to talk about a few things."
Before Harry even reached them, the front doors of the Manor swung inward and Draco stood behind them. Even though all of the things Harry was feeling inside were nothing to smile about, he couldn't hold one back as he saw Draco standing there looking like he did.
Harry laughed as they got outside and shoved Draco playfully. "Boyfriend, huh?" He said grinning, "Did you just tell her that so she wouldn't bother or did you mean it?"
While Potter was busy in the bathroom, Draco put on a black slim shirt and his leather shoes, a silver watch and a ring. Potter came out of the bathroom just as Draco was leaving the dorm. Weasel and Granger were waiting in the common room and when Draco passed them, they looked at him in disgust - as usual. Draco didn't bother talking to them so he walked past the two idiots and down to the Great Hall.
Before Harry turned away, he gave Malfoy a smile. Ron walked in just before McGonnagal started the lesson. Harry was surprised that she, as headmistress, was still teaching classes. He planned to go and have a talk with her later. But first, he had to pay attention in class.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Something was going on, but he didn't know what. The two of them and Malfoy have been acting strange all week now. Mrs Weasley hadn't answered to Harry's letter and when they have walked along Diagon Alley, Harry had noticed that there were a lot less people in
Malfoy didn't say anything. Harry rolled his eyes and scoffed. He grabbed his broom tightly and walked away.
"You are! Yes, of course you are. FinallyHe and Kreacher meet at last.", he said and bowed in front of Draco, who was a bit overwhelmed with the situation, what Potter seemed to have noticed.
"You would make your parents proud right now, wouldn't you!" Malfoy shouted, his own face now reddening too, "Your perfect parents with their perfect lives and their perfect friends! Look where they are now! All of them!"
"Fine. The prison sentence is reduced to 15 years. With that, the case Lucius Malfoy is closed." And he hit with the gavel on the desk once again.
"Snape told me in your first year that there was something strange between you two. In your second year, he told me that the two of you wouldn't stop looking at each other, but I wouldn't believe him. I used to say he's mental and that you'd look at each other because you hate each other, but he only shook his head. In your fourth year, he told me about Potter joining the Triwizard Tournament and that you were utterly confused. He suspected, about not knowing who to support- the Durmstang boy, or the boy who you were supposed to hate. I said it wad probably because of something else-
Harry sighed and concentrated on the text, not his loud beating heart. He took a deep breath and started singing:
Harry found himself out on the street in the cold and darkness just when the had to vomit. Malfoy stood by his side and did the same thing. They wiped their mouths and laughed. Harry was so happy. They stumbled along the street, Malfoy making his walking stick levitate next to him. Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him closer. They stood in the middle of the street, somewhere in London, and danced to the sound of the night. Harry buried his face into Draco's muscular shoulder and took a deep breath.
Slowly, Nott, Goyle and Zabini nodded and left the room without looking back. Harry knew, they did whatever Draco told them. They had done so since they were children and they won't stop doing so now. Harry looked at Draco, who waited until the dokr was closed.
Why was he so annoyed that Malfoy didn't want to talk to him? Merlin's beard, he still lost his temper so quickly!
Harry was woken by someone shaking his shoulder and whispering his name. He slowly opened his eyes and the healer from before came into focus. Harry immediately sat up and straightened his glasses.
Draco was a bit shocked, but not really surprised. How else did he think his friends would react when they found out he'd kissed their mortal enemy?
"Draco, we...", Harry panted, but all of a sudden they were backed against a wall. Draco licked Harry's bottom lip and Harry opened them, desperate for more.
"Well yes..." Harry said hesitantly, "I was right about him being a Death Eater, but I didn't know it better and now I think I do."
At night Harry lay awake, revisiting the bookstore over and over again. Harry smiled at the thought of how Malfoy must have freaked out so much that he knocked over some books and ran away. And the way Malfoy froze when Harry found him hiding behind that book stand. Harry chuckled. Ridiculous.
Harry felt that something was different and now, he knew what it was. Draco laying next to him like this, his hand on Harry's bare waist, their legs entwined and Draco breathing heavily, Harry knew exactly what was different.
"I had not the slightest idea what I should answer to Pansy's question about Slughorn.", Draco said and Potter chuckled quietly.
Harry folded the paper again. Malfoy looked up and had an uncertain look on his face. Harry nodded smiling. Malfoy smiled too.
"W-wouldn't interest me? Baby, everything that has to do with you interest me! Are you kidding me? I want to know everything about your family. That's why I wanted to visit your uncle the filthy Muggle!", Draco said and kissed Harry.
He rolled around in his bed for a couple of minutes before he got up and put on the shirt he had thrown on the floor earlier. Harry walked downstairs to the living room, where Ron sat and read the Daily Prophet, while the scent of magically cooked dish by Hermione filled the room. Ron smiled as he saw Harry and put down the paper.
As Harry put his wand into his pocket, grabbed his bag with one and the cage and his broom with his other hand, he felt his heart racing. He was actually going to go to Malfoy Manor - voluntarily. Harry smiled at his friends for one last time before he disapparated.
Harry stood up and walked into the bathroom. Draco stood in front of the mirror and combed his silky hair. Harry smiled as Draco groaned because one strand of hair fell down repeatedly.
Harry smiled and pulled Draco's face down. Draco laughed against Harry's lips and grabbed Harry's naked ass beneath his pyjama.
But seeing Potter - that was something else. Draco had been so shocked when he had seen Potter standing in Flourish and Blotts like he didn't belong anywhere else. Draco still couldn't believe he hid from Potter behind that stupid book stand. He should have gone up to him, or at least not run away. Maybe he would get another opportunity to show Potter he was not a coward and he wouldn't be treated like one. Draco might owe Potter his life, but Draco knew the idiot was too modest to think so too.
Harry blinked. Somehow he had hoped Malfoy wanted it. But somewhere deep down inside of him Harry was relieved. Very, very,
Draco's body jerked forward, his cock twitching at the sight of Potter offering his neck for Draco to mark. Heat rushed to his cheeks as Potter gasped, undoubtedly noticing Draco's arousal. He hadn't moved and Draco relaxed.
Hermione hugged Harry tightly as if she was going to leave for a deadly ride - which of course she wasn't.
Harry checked his bag one more time before putting it down next to his shoes and Bond's cage. He didn't pack a lot of stuff, he figured all he needed were some fresh clothes, but because he didn't know how long he was going to stay he just took two shirts and underwear.
"He followed me everywhere when I was at home to make sure I won't betray him. Even when I was at Hogwarts, he was always there. He afllicted me in my dreams and made Snape following me everywhere. I thought I would dissapiont my mother.", Draco sniffed. He looked at Potter and waited for him to say something. And so he did.
He then walked towards them and held out his hand. Molly took it with a surprised smile. Harry grinned. "Do you want to come in?" He asked, but Molly politely turned down.
He didn't even look at the waitress's boobs just once. Not even a tiny glance. He just looked at Harry as if she wasn't even there. She must have noticed that, because her smile vanished and she glared at Harry as if he was the reason Malfoy wasn't interested in her breasts. But what if Harry was? At this thought Harry's cheeks started to burn and his hands started sweating. All this time Malfoy had hated him but what if this time now ended? What if Harry and Malfoy really had a chance of getting along? What if this was really good? Heavens know that Harry wished for something really good.
"I owe you one, too, then.", Draco said, pleased to find he could talk and answer Potter's kisses at the same time.
Fully dressed, they walked downstairs, where Petunia, Vernon and Dudley were sitting at the kitchen table.
As he came back, Potter waited on the couch and held an old book in his hand. The black leather cover was already a bit frayed and it looked very old.
"Malfoy." Harry said suddenly and Draco looked up with curiosity in his eyes, "I want to go downstairs."
Harry laughed, gave Draco one last kiss and left. He danced out of the library, past Madame Pince, who watched him with suspicious eyes. Harry walked down into the Great Hall. Different than Harry had thought, not everyone was in their common room, since a lot of students were chatting in the Great Hall. Harry smiled and walked to Hermione, Seamus, Neville, Dean, Ron and the other Weasleys. They all went outside. The snow was still untouched. Ron bent down to make a small snowball and threw it at Harry. Harry laughed and made one on his own. Quickly, they were into a big snowball fight. Harry stopped and looked at Hermione, who sat on a stone and watched them. He walked over to her.
Harry saw Malfoy looking up excitedly. He couldn't answer this question! If he would say yes, they would never stop asking who it was. And if he would lie and say no he could hurt Malfoy. So Harry grabbed the bottle of Vodka the two entertainers had prepared. He opened it and took a big sip. The crowd cheered again and even Ron started clapping and laughing.
By the look on Hermione's face, Harry could see that she knew what kind of dream he was talking about. And then realization also dawned on Ron. Harry closed his eyes for a second, trying to gather his thoughts, and then started to tell them about the dream he'd had.
Harry heard footsteps in front of his door and after a short pause they distanced again. He figured it must have been Hermione checking if he really went to bed. Harry's new owl Bond hooted softly in the corner, but Harry ignored him and just turned to the side, his eyes still closed.
Draco looked at Potter, who formed a soft smile with his lips and Draco looked away again. He felt so stupid. Because of everything. And he felt so unbelievably sorry. But he couldn't say it. He just couldn't tell Potter that he was fucking sorry.
"Out of all the awful things you've done to me, this one is the worst." Hot tears streaming down his face, Harry ran past Malfoy and disapparated with a
"I will. And you two have fun." Harry said smiling, even though Hermione couldn't see him but he thought maybe she would hear it and not be so worried.
With that, the conversation was ended. The whole train ride Blaise and Draco just sat there and looked out of the window. The frightened lady with the food trolley came inside twice and Draco bought something to eat and drink. Then he slept until Blaise woke him up.
Harry sat down on the bed with Hermione. He didn't know what this was all about, but she was her friend and he wanted to be here for her.
"Pansy, tell me why you pushed me to go there." he said in a stern tone Harry knew just too well from their time back at Hogwarts.
Theo nodded wordlessly. He flipped the page of his newspaper and kept reading in silence. Draco didn't mind. He waved his wand, a cup came floating outside and the teapot filled it with tea. With another flick, the milk poured itself into the cup and Draco grabbed it, drinking carefully.
Harry watched him take off his shoes and placing them next to Harry's. Then Malfoy turned to look at Harry and frowned.
"I really have to get going, but I'll see you next week as planned, right?" She asked and Harry nodded.
Come in.", Professor McGonnagal said loudly. Harry opened the door and stepped over the door step. McGonnagal turned around.
Draco only laughed. Suddenly Harry wondered where he was going to sleep, but he didn't ask Malfoy, because he didn't want to make him uncomfortable. Maybe Harry also wished Malfoy hadn't thought about that. Malfoy asked Harry if he wanted to go outside to the garden. Following Draco back downstairs, Harry hoped he wouldn't have to go through the Drawing Room, even though Draco had been oddly understanding before.
"I would like to take you for dinner." Narcissa said to Harry, who got a bit shocked after she had spoke these words.
They had to squeeze in Harry's bed, because Harry didn't want Draco to sleep on the floor. Harry didn't sleep with shirts on when he was at home for summer, so he put on his pyjama bottoms and lay down shirtless. Draco came inside Harry's room and was shook. Harry laughed.
Draco cringed and Harry laughed loudly. Harry bent down again and shortly before his lips touched Draco's, the door banged open again. Draco and Harry looked up.
He couldn't let cowardice stop him from facing Mrs Malfoy. And besides, after all that he's been through, this should be very easy. Harry followed Draco towards his mother, who turned her head to look at them.
"Come in.", Ron shouted. Harry stepped in and laughed. Ron and Hermione were on the floor, playing Twister.
"But you know you can take Teddy with you, right?" Draco said and shifted lightly under the covers, then pulled a face like that movement had been very painful.
"Could you please tell Draco he should come up here?", Harry asked with a questioning look. Ron sighed.
They have decided to send Hermione packages every Wednesday and Sunday so she can keep track of their week easily. Most of the pictures Harry and Ron had picked out were of them or of Teddy, some of them showed Harry's and Ron's cubicles at the Ministry and on one (that now hung in their living room as well) were Harry and Ron waving with happy smiles on their faces in the middle of the Aurors headquarters on their first day. They wrote a long letter to Hermione, both of them taking turns with the quill and leaving the letter a scribbled mess.
The silence came back. Something in Harry wanted something weird. Something disturbing. Something Harry couldn't live with. Or maybe he could, but Malfoy couldn't. Harry wanted to kiss Malfoy, but deep in his mind he told himself not to. He repeated it in his head like a prayer.
Draco thrusted his hips, letting his cock slide against Potter's, the sweat easing their movements. This was much, much better.
This lesson was awful. Harry had to stare hat Draco all the damn time, because he knew how Draco looked without these school robes on.
They finished their breakfast in silence and then made their way to their classes. Draco wanted Potter to wait until Draco was in the classroom, then he could follow, so no one would think they had eaten together.
"I'm hungry." Malfoy said, sitting down at the same table they did before, "Do you want to eat something?"
Malfoy looked at Harry and shook his head, signalizing Harry that he really didn't want to see that. Out of impulse, Harry took Malfoy's hand and squeezed it. Harry decided that they really didn't have to see how they got undressed even more and how they really got to it, so he skipped that part. As a thanks, he got a squeeze from Malfoy back.
Draco remembered the Dark Lord sitting where Lucius had used to sit - at the far end of the table - his snake always so close by his side. Now the chair was empty. Narcissa sat down next to it where she usually sat, by Lucius's side. Pansy sat down next to her and Theo grabbed the chair opposite of Pansy. Draco stood there, thinking for a second, and then sat down next to Theo on his usual chair next to where his father would have sat.
Draco grabbed his mother's hand and even though he felt ridiculous, like a four year old, he held her very tight. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter looking at him and tried to ignore him, but Potter's eyes sucked at Draco's and like magnets the found their way to each other. Draco only heard half of the things the minister said, until he spoke the sentence:
Draco sat for good ten minutes in front of, under and on top of the table and shook the bloody kitchen table. Harry walked up to his room to get something and with his elbow, he accidentally pushed over a staple on Draco's trunk.
"I wouldn't have that big of a problem with him if he'd just apologize or at least stand for what he's done."
Potter's statement reminded him where they were and who was only a few rooms away. Potter's eyes narrowed and hot pain twisted Draco's stomach, as he looked up at Potter in shock.
They ordered something to drink and looked at the menu. Harry was glad to see his favourite meal on the card and ordered it right away. Malfoy ordered the same and Narcissa something Harry had never heard of. After Harry had had a long conversation with Mrs Malfoy, he excused himself, stood up and vanished to the toilet.
"No, I'm not going to. You have to learn it or some day you will come out of the shower and haven't locked the bathroom door and I will come in and see your dick hanging around," Potter said.
Harry looked at the letter for a second, unsure whether he should actually send it. After careful consideration, Harry rolled up the letter and Malfoy's owl grabbed it with its foot.
Neville accompanied Harry to the Great Hall, where Ron and Hermione were already waiting. Ron was shoving ten or more chicken wings in his mouth and Hermione frowned at him. She still was in no good mood. During dinner they didn't talk - much to Harry's liking. His eyes swept over to the Slytherin table, where the pale face of Draco Malfoy caught his immediate attention. He had his head propped up on his arm and poked with his fork in his meat with a scowl on his face. Harry had never seen him smile. Well, that was actually not true: in first year he had smiled at Harry, before Harry had rejected his handshake and was sorted into Gryffindor. And then, his thoughts went back to Cho. Had Harry only imagined that he liked Cho? That was absolutely impossible. Although... Malfoy looked up and his eyes met Harry's for a quarter second and then he looked away at Pansy Parkinson, who sat right next to him. They started talking and now, Harry felt what he should have felt when he had talked to Cho. His insides ached and felt like they were set on fire.
Draco watched with big eyes as Harry pulled out his Gryffindor scarfand threw it towards Malfoy, who smiled brightly.
Ron jumped to his feet and hurried to the portrait hole. Harry laughed and followed them outside. The Great Hall was already filled with students and teachers. Dumbledore sat as usual in the middle of the staff table and talked to McGonnagal. Harry, Hermione and Ron sat down next to Seamus, Dean and Neville. Even before Harry started eating, he looked over to the Slytherin table, searching the familiar blond head, but Malfoy wasn't anywhere to be seen, only Parkinson and his other idiotic friends sat there. Harry sighed.
Harry talked to a lot of people during dinner. Many students that he didn't know came up to him and wanted to chat, but Hermione shooed them away as if they were flies during a picnic. Harry looked over at the table on the other side of the Hall where Malfoy was sitting. He didn't talk to his friend Zabini, who still was the only one of Malfoy's friends Harry had spotted.
Draco wanted to smile. He wanted it so badly, but he didn't. Why did he even ask Potter to do that? His father told him never to trust anyone. But his father was not a person you could trust, Draco had learnt it his whole life long, but now he was strong enough to see it.
Draco nodded. He was relieved Potter's friends were giving him a chance. But why exactly? Before Draco could ask, Granger talked. "After breakfast we'll pack our stuff and leave with everyone else, we can't disapparate here."
They just walked side by side without saying a word and without looking at each other. Harry tried to say something, but it came nothing but hot air. Just before they reached the next classroom, Ron turned to Harry.
Malfoy's hoarse voice made something inside Harry tingle. Malfoy sat up straight and Harry turned his position so he could watch him. Malfoy looked around for a second, then looked back at Harry.
one. But he didn't want to, ok? He had no choice. In the war, we all did wrong things! Even me! And don't think you attacking Draco now does justify what he was forced to do in the war!", Potter shouted,
As Harry shivered and pulled the sleeves of his pullover down to his fingertips, Malfoy stepped closer. Harry didn't really know what to do, so he didn't move and let Malfoy do whatever he wanted to do. Which was putting his arm around Harry's shoulders and rubbing his shoulder so that he wouldn't freeze anymore. Harry smiled and leaned his head against Malfoy's shoulder that was just a little higher than his own. Harry had never realized that Malfoy was taller than him.
"Uhm, I dont think so, I think he's alright." Harry said, but he selfishly just wanted Malfoy for himself right now.
"Ron told me he wishes to spend more time with you and he's really sad that you vanish all the time. He's not even mad at you. He's mad at himself. He just wants you two to do more together. He also said he trusts you with his life and he would never let anyone steal you from him because you're his girl and he loves you," Harry answered.
Ron was asked if he would like to have children some day. Harry saw exactly that Ron was searching for Hermione in the crowd.
Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Seamus joined them on their way down into the Great Hall. As they walked in, already many people were chatting and eating. Including Draco. Harry looked at him, but he didn't notice Harry, because his gaze was fixed on his cereal. The Gryffindors sat down at their table and Ron started eating immediately. Harry laughed and took something himself. Every now and then, he looked up to check on Draco. Draco looked up at the same time and their eyes met. Harry smiled and Draco wiggled his eyebrows and smirked, what made Harry blush very, very hard and he smiled even wider. Draco laughed and continued eating.
It had to be him. Draco had found Potter several times talking to Longbottom and shushing him whenever Draco came into earshot. And that one time in the common room Draco overheard the two of them talking about him. And sometimes when they talk, they look over to Draco every so often. It had to be Longbottom - he had to be the one Potter was talking to.
what I am going to tell you now," Harry said and Neville promised. So Harry told him what had happened next.
"Boys, you are annoying!", Nott said and Harry watched the door handle behind pushed down and froze.
Harry showed him the finger and followed Draco outside. Although Harry knew what Nott said wasn't true, he had a strange feeling as he followed Draco through the dungeon corridor. In front of the library, Draco stopped and waited for Harry. When Harry finally caught up, Draco looked at him worried.
"Malfoy you prick, get up!" Draco opened his eyes and saw Potter looking down at him. His green eyes were glowing brightly and his red lips were closed. Draco had to fight back a smile.
Harry was astounded. Malfoy suggested they would see each other again? And not just running into each other. Really seeing each other - meeting.
Harry left the office when no other pupil came, he made sure of that. There have been far more people than Harry had expected, but he would be glad if he could have helped only half of them. Harry walked the familiar way up to Gryffindor Tower. The Fat Lady greeted him and he named the password. Harry had to take a deep breath when the portrait swung open. It's been over a year since he'd been in this room, yet it was just as he remembered. Harry had to hold back his tears as he stepped inside. This room was filled with so many memories, good and bad, happy and sad.
After breakfast, they went back to the common room, that was crowded with people. Everyone was enjoying their presents and talked. Harry looked at the big wooden grandfather clock.
But the second they were in the Café, Draco let go of Potter's hand. Not every Wizard had to know they were together.
Harry breathed heavily and looked around. The unmistakable smell of the hospital wing filled his nose and this time it was not a dream.
And then something inside Harry clicked. Suddenly it all made sense. Harry realized the look in Malfoy's eyes wasn't resentment for Harry - it was for himself. Harry realized the tone in Malfoy's voice wasn't anger - it was frustration and confusion. Harry breathed heavily and Malfoy stopped arguing to breathe as well.
Malfoy took off his trousers and slipped into silvery silk pyjama bottoms. Harry watched him take off his shirt and while his eyes were fixed on the slim waist and nicely toned abs, Harry's eyes darted to the lifted arm. Harry's eyes widened and so did Malfoy's grin.
. The Dark Lord. It was terrifying, but I needed to stay strong and my father...", Draco's voice cracked. Potter smiled weakly.
Harry sighed and silently cursed himself for asking. He should have known where the line was, but he'd immediately crossed it. Malfoy still looked like he might punch Harry any second if Harry didn't find the right words to say now.
The sky was already dark outside, but the lanterns illuminated the platform. Hagrid and the first years left to the boats and Draco and Blaise left with the rest to walk to the carriages.
And so Harry told Ron what had happened that morning as he woke up and Madame Pomfrey's face when she saw them both lying in his bed naked. Ron couldn't stop laughing.
The man was impressed. He shook Draco's hand and wanted to get to work. As Draco showed him his left arm, the man grinned.
"Mr Malfoy. Your son is the most beautiful person I have ever met. Not only on the outside, but also on the inside. Draco is interesting, he can be so kind if he wants to. He makes me incredibly happy. I love to talk to him and only listening to him is satisfying enough. I love his face, and if I'm allowed to say that, his face comes a strangely lot after yours. He is handsome and his hair- I can't even say what I love about his hair. Draco is simply amazing. He gives me the feeling to be loved and sometimes when I'm with him, nothing else matters. He is interesting and talking to him frees me. I can share everything with him, from my past, to the present. He understands me, because he had been through a lot, just like me. He's interested in everything about me and I'm interested in everything about him. I love him, Mr Malfoy. I love your son.", Harry answered.
"Malfoy!" Harry shouted, but it didn't make Malfoy stop, it only attracted people's attention to Harry. But Harry didn't care. He needed to talk to Malfoy, there was nothing more important right now. "Malfoy, wait!" Harry shouted once again when he stormed after Malfoy, out of the castle and over the grounds to the eighth year tower.
"You're coming?" She asked and Harry asked himself why she was even asking when she won't accept a 'no'.
What was happening here? Harry shook his head confused and made his way to Slughorn's personal store, where he took a few ingredients for the potion unnoticed and then he walked up to the classroom on the fifth floor, which hasn't been used since a long time.
"And you didn't tell him you weren't joking?" Longbottom asked again. Draco peeked into the common room and saw Potter and Longbottom sit on the couch and talk. No one else was there.
"Oh, you mean if I read the article about your heartfelt speech and dark secret? I did." Malfoy grinned.
Draco pulled out Potter's ugly Gryffindor scarf and smelled at it. If he would have seen someone behave like this, he would have punched them in the face as hard as he could. But he couldn't resist the scent of the scarf - it smelled like Potter, like happiness, like home. Draco smiled to himself and put the scarf back under his pillow. He knew it was Theo's birthday today and he knew he should probably get up and help, but his limbs felt heavy and he couldn't get them to move. Draco sighed. Fucking injuries.
"Because obviously you don't spend a single minute getting ready," Malfoy said, skeptically eyeing Harry's hair.
Harry wasn't sure if he wanted Teddy to see Draco like this, but he figured he wasn't going to remember it anyways when he would grow up. When they entered the room once again, there was a healer tracing her wand over Malfoy's bare chest and whispered some incantations. Draco's chest was heavily bruised and scarred. Harry, so shocked about the sight of it, backed out of the room and closed the door again. He sat down on a chair with Teddy in his lap and took a deep breath.
Harry laughed a little and to his surprise so did Malfoy. Harry noticed the younger waitress leaving the kitchen with what seemed to be Malfoy's steak. Harry saw that she smiled at Malfoy even though he didn't look at her and she opened a few buttons on her blouse.
Harry shook his head. "I don't have anyone related to me in my life. My friends are my family and I am entirely grateful for that."
Harry leaned back against the wall. He wasn't sure anymore what Malfoy actually wanted. First he had hated Harry, then they had kind of gotten along, then they had been really intimate and Malfoy opened himself to Harry, then he had ignored Harry for almost a month and Harry had been sure it was because he had had a few partners before. But now, now Malfoy was acting all distant again and insulted Harry without any reason. Like the old Malfoy.
"Oh, you know Hermione, she is back in her element and ready to re-read every single book the Hogwarts library has to offer."
As the evening went on and on, everyone was having so much fun. Harry excused himself from a conversation with Hagrid and Madame Pomfrey and went to the stage. He tapped against the microphone and cleared his throat. When everyone quieted down and looked at him, Harry grinned nervously. A spotlight fell on Draco, who looked around surprised.
"I was walking through the corridor of Hogwarts with my father. And I was in first year and you came walking towards us and smiled at me. And I knew from the first moment I saw you that I would never forget you. And my father sneered at you and dragged me along the corridor. I was forced to sneer at you as well, so my father didn't think bad of me and so we walked past each other. But from that moment on, I thought you will never like me, so I thought I had nothing to loose. I thought I had already missed my chance.", Draco told the boy, who had his head on his chest and listened to the dream carefully.
Draco woke up. His shirt was wet because of his sweating. He rubbed his forehead and looked around. Potter's bed was empty. Draco didn't want to know where he was and lay back down. He breathed out and closed his eyes. He had had an awful dream.
Draco just realised how much he actually liked Potter. The stupid git was messing with his head. Draco slurped back to the empty common room. His dorm room was also empty. And it was going to stay empty.
Draco felt stinging pain in his chest and he breathed slowly. With every breath he took, the pain got stronger. His knees felt weak and he sunk to the floor.
Hermione had a light smile on her lips and Harry could tell that she was really happy for him, even though Malfoy had been horrible for all those years. When Hermione showed him her watch, Harry could see that Ron definitely wasn't awake yet, for it was only half past eight. Harry didn't really know what to do. He didn't want Malfoy to wake up and see Hermione staring at them, but he couldn't ask her to go away because it would wake Malfoy up too. But to Harry's luck he didn't have to say anything. Hermione pointed her wand at him and used Legilimency to communicate with Harry through their minds.
Even though Draco said, he'd wait in front of the Great Hall, he was no where to be seen. Parkinson and Zabini store past Harry and Ron, deep in conversation.
"Will you now tell me what memory you chose?" Draco's hand on Potter's waist twitched slightly, but he nodded.
Harry looked around curiously. The restaurant was very neat. Many witches and wizards were sitting on small tables, their plates filled with food that looked more than delicious. There was a little river going through a corner of the room. A fountain was in the middle of the big room and the whole room was enchanted by several floating diamonds that glowed in a bright light. The three of them sat down at the table, Narcissa next to her son and Harry sat opposite him. Harry silently cursed because now he forced Malfoy to look Harry in the eyes for the whole evening.
"Thank you." The headmistress said and smiled, "Like every other year before, we are going to start with the Sorting of the new first years, but this year we aren't going to start with the feast right after. We have to do something else before that."
Draco pulled out his wand and in one smooth movement, it was at Vernon's throat. Dudley and Petunia screeched.
"Mr. Potter continued telling, "If Tom Riddle had been in a magical orphanage where he belonged, he maybe wouldn't have had such anger issues. Maybe he wouldn't have been treated differently or like he was a freak, because he would have been with his kind. I'm not saying that being in this orphanage made Tom Riddle the man he died as. But I am saying that if orphanages have the right money and resources, they can build something great for the children and help them get a bright future. No witch or wizard should grow up thinking there is something wrong with them or not knowing about their powers at all." We were very happy to hear Harry Potter being so kind and open about this topic. He was very nice to interview and he gave us a lot of insight on this new project of his."
Mr Weasley whipped his wand and cleared the food from the plates, just like at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Draco went upstairs with Teddy. They heard George shout and cry from the other room and consciously avoided that room. They went straight into Ron's old room and fell into the beds - Ron, Hermione and Ginny on Ron's and Harry with Teddy and Malfoy on Harry's. Draco seemed to wait until the time was right to ask his question.
"I don't care. I'm in the middle of something and I don't need to be concerned with your bullshit right now."
"Draco was furious. Said his dad was going to kill us. He didn't want to eat in the Hall, so we walked down to the kitchens.", Harry told them.
Malfoy nodded. Harry wordlessly turned on his heel and was ready to leave, but before he reached the door Malfoy talked.
"Hermione, please. Malfoy is hiding something from me. He wouldn't tell me who the letters yesterday were from. I need to know."
"You know, we never do something together. Just us two," she said as they searched for another book Harry wanted.
Malfoy took his hand away and looked at the clear, dark water of the lake. Harry could only imagine what Mr Malfoy would say to that, but he needed to know.
"I'm going to take a shower," Malfoy said when they finished eating, "Then I'm going to send the owls."
Harry sighed and slowly walked towards the door. Harry looked at Nott over his shoulder, but he was busy in the kitchen, so Harry opened the door slowly and peeked inside. As Harry switched on a dim green light, he felt like he'd just entered a completely different world. The room was darker than the rest of the apartment, it didn't have bright beige walls like the rest of the place, its walls were a dark grey that reminded Harry of the stone walls in Malfoy Manor. A Slytherin banner hung on the left, and the big eagle owl sat in it's cage on the right of a window from where you had a beautiful view over London.
"No, it's not..." Draco stopped. He didn't know what it was and he didn't want Potter to think he did know.
"Mister Harry Potter! How good seeing you back at health.", a little house elf smiled up at him. Harry smiled too and sat down.
Harry laughed, but he figured Ron had a point and it made him kind of sad to think that he would never sleep in that bed again, that he would never be able to do his homework on these tables again, he would never go through that portrait hole with his friends again.
Harry sat at his desk in the evening, chewing on his quill while being deeply in thoughts. He looked at Malfoy's owl and tried to figure out what he should write - if he should say yes or no. Harry had already written Malfoy's name, but that was barely anything he could send.
Again, it was quiet. Harry thought Draco was already sleeping, but then, his calm voice broke the silence:
"I wanted this. Of course I did.", Potter said and pressed a quick kiss to Draco's lips and smiled apologetically.
Harry nodded. "I know. Me too." He whipped out his wand and covered Draco with the blanket, "Now sleep."
He got up from the stairs and so did Harry, who didn't really know if he should say something even though he really wanted to. Malfoy walked on the street and looked around if anyone was coming. When there was no one in sight, he prepared himself to mount his broom. That was the moment Harry really wanted to say something, but he didn't want to seem cheesy. Harry then convinced himself to speak, but as he opened his mouth, Malfoy was faster.
He hid behind his newspapers again and kept reading, so did Hermione. Harry sighed and drank his tea.
Harry flushed and grinned. He supposed they were quite cute. They sat around the house the whole day, and all of them helped with the food. Harry couldn't help but smile. This was his family, right here in this room. Percy, Bill and Fleur helping Mrs Weasley in the kitchen, George and Angelina in the armchair, Ginny and Hermione giggling about something in the corner, Charlie and Mr Weasley making a bonfire outside, Ron and Draco talking about the house.
The next few days left far too slow for Draco's liking. Every second took way longer than normally and especially every second he was around stupid Potter. At the end of the week, Draco finally got to talk to Blaise again. They sat in the Great Hall and had lunch.
Draco kneeled on the floor in front of his bed. Everything was blurry and he couldn't think straight. Potter has been gone for hours, the day had gone into night and the moon was making the snow glitter. Draco didn't know what to do with himself.
"Here you are." He said grinning and sat down between Harry and Neville, "Here Ron, I have your card."
Two weeks had passed since the "kiss". Neither Draco nor Potter had talked about it, not with each other and especially not with anyone else. Draco's life got quite lonely. Most of the time he stayed in his room and studied, because Blaise was busy with his new friends and Draco didn't bother to find new. Apart from in the evenings before and after dinner and in the mornings before breakfast Draco was alone in the dorm room. Sometimes he left his bed to sit in the common room just so he could be around other people. Draco had never really liked people but now it felt really lonely and Draco somehow hated it.
