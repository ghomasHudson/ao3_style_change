Draco wiped his own tears away and smiled brightly. “Of course mommy! Why don’t you go in bed and then I’ll be there soon with tea and stories,” he told her proudly.
This went on for minutes, maybe hours. They couldn’t recall. The only thing they recalled was meeting eachothers lips, finally feeling whole.
Narcissa placed her hand upon Lucius’s, hoping to calm the man a bit. Yet, Lucius aggresively shrugged down her hand and stood up.
Draco was visibly shaking and looked at his father wide eyed. “I’m sorry father! It was an accident!” He whispered.
Narcissa didn’t agree with Voldemort. As a pureblood, she did not always understand muggles. But to hurt them was simply ridiculous. It was also ridiculous to judge someone on bloodstatus. A wizard or a witch is simply a wizard or a witch. Blood status didn’t matter.
She threw the wine bottle at the floor and it broke on the floor. She sighed as she looked at the damage she did. Narcissa put her head in her hands and started to sob in sadness, frustration and anger.
After Malfoy apologized, he and Harry never spoke again. They only greeted eachother as they were on civil terms now. A soft sigh from across the room broke Harry from his thoughts. He looked over to Malfoy, who was still reading, curled in on himself.
Malfoy kept quiet and stared down his lap. Harry did the same as they sat in silence for an awkward few minutes. Suddenly, Malfoy spoke up again.
Lucius wasn’t like the other guys. The guys that Narcissa hated. The guys that made stupid lists. ‘Top ten boobs of Slytherin,’ ‘Most fuckable Hufflepuff girl,’ ‘How many Ravenclaw girls have you railed?’ ‘Gryffindor’s best subs,’ etc...
Narcissa smiled slightly at the elf. “I’m fine. Can you check on Draco though? Make sure he is asleep. After that you can do something fun for yourself, okay? Go treat yourself,” Narcissa answered while handing Marty some money.
Narcissa chuckled. “There is no such thing as being a real man. If Lucius means men like him and his friends then I am sure they are not real men. Real men are kind, genuine boys,” Narcissa said softly. “Besides, I’ve seen enough deatheaters scream and cry under the curse. It is a painful one, little dragon, and you are only ten. You are strong,” she said softly.
‘Yes, definitely. Now Draco, I don’t know about you but my ass is burning on the sand. Race with me to the sea?’
Mcgonagall has taken all the eight years out on a field trip to the beach. ’all the eight years should have a day of relaxation,’ she had claimed. And Harry, with the tons of work they had the past few weeks, couldn’t agree more.
‘Ehh yeah, I’m sorry for falling asleep. I didn’t mean to ditch out on your assignment. Shit, did you finish it? I-I’m sorry. I can just..’
Poppy gently grabbed the baby and checked if he was okay. She then handed the little boy to Narcissa. She cradled the little boy in her arms.
A week passed and Harry found himself in the toy shop in Hogsmeade. Draco was at the three broomsticks with Blaise, Theo and Pansy. Harry looked at the shelves, smiling when he found what he was looking for. He payed at the cashier and started making his way back to Hogwarts.
It is your last name that surprised me. I didn’t know you are the wife of Lucius Malfoy. I may not get why a lovely lady like you would marry a man like that. But I’m sure you had your reasons for that as well. Perhaps it isn’t even my business at all.
They graduated and Lucius got to live in one of his family’s many manors. Malfoy Manor. It took only a few weeks for Narcissa to move in with him.
Narcissa couldn’t help but smile. Child crushes were just the cutest. She just hoped that Lucius wouldn’t find out...
The last time she checked, he was sitting at his desk; drawing a dragon. ‘Look mommy! It is a dragon! Just like me!’ He said. Narcissa had smiled at him and left so he could go on to draw in peace.
She then took a picture of Draco and the toy and added it to the letter. She got an owl and soon the letter was on its way to Alex.
My little boy is extremely happy with his dragon toy. He hasn’t let it go since unpacking it. Thank you so much for this product. It makes me happy to see him happy.
Draco chuckled. “My dancing abilities? I don’t know. What are you planning on?” He asked suspiciously.
I have a question for aunt Andromeda. She is an expert in muggle cooking and baking right? I wish to ask her for a chocolate recipe. It is for a school assignment.
Narcissa thinks. “He likes drawing a lot but also reading. But I am not looking for books or coloring stuff. I am looking for a toy he can play with it.”
Faggot, that is what they called Malfoy. He watches Malfoy’s ex-friends stand up, shoving him and then leaving. Malfoy is all left alone now.
‘Breathe, please,’ Harry put a hand on Malfoy’s chest. ‘I need you to take some calm breaths please.’ Harry watched as Malfoy took some deep breaths.
But staying with Draco this night would be worth the hurt. Her little boy needed someone at his side. What if he got sick again? Or if he gets a nightmare! No, he would not be alone tonight.
The windows of his room looked out upon the gardens. It is a beautiful view. The green curtains were currently open so you could see the jasmines, roses and daisies clearly.
When Draco woke first, the stuffed dragon would be hidden. And Harry would still pretend he doesn’t know. He doesn’t know why he never confronts Draco about it. Of course he was curious about the tiny dragon. But he couldn’t find it in himself to confront his boyfriend. Something about the dragon seemed so personal, so private. Draco would have to talk about it to Harry first.
Draco nodded and let his mom help him up. They moved towards his bedroom where his mother helped him sit on the bed. His limbs were still shaking like crazy and he struggled to change out of his clothes.
Narcissa smiled and pulled him into a hug. “We can talk about anything, Draco. The day won’t be ruined.”
They managed not to fall asleep during their professor’s lecture. The professor announced that they may now start working on their homework. Harry looked at the homework with a bored look on his face, glancing over to Draco who already started. It was then that he saw the glistening silver in his ear again.
A privilege of the eight year common room was that everyone got their own room. It didn’t took for Harry and Draco to decide to share a room together. They cuddled and fell asleep in eachothers arms. Harry loved waking up to an arm full of blonde. His nightmares faded when Draco came to sleep with him. Only in rare occasions he found himself being waked from one by Draco. And Draco would always be there to comfort him when he needed to be comforted. Just like Harry would always comfort Draco when he needed it.
It seemed like it was a bad thing amongst the Slytherins though, being traditional purebloods. They needed to marry someone of the opposite sex, pureblood and produce a heir.
Narcissa hugged Draco close to her. “I’m sorry, darling. If you want to join a dance club then we will just find a way without your father finding out.”
He walks to Draco’s bed. The sheets are neatly folded, like they always are. His nightstand doesn’t contain much. Only a picture of Draco and his mom, and a book. To his surprise it is a muggle novel. Something green is peaking out from under his pillow and Harry can’t contain his curiousity. To his amusement, it is a green stuffed dragon. It is a small, soft thing and Harry smiles at the thought of the imitating Slytherin sleeping with it.
‘I’m sorry Malfoy, that was very harsh of your ex-friends. The way they insult..,’ Harry gets interrupted.
Narcissa was shaking herself. Draco was crying and screaming in pain and all she could do was watch. The deatheaters around her were laughing cruelly. They were absolutely enjoying the child’s pain. Narcissa could swear that Greyback even looked at him with lust.
In minutes, Narcissa was asleep too. She would deal with the consequences tomorrow. But now it is just her and Draco, safely tucked in to bed.
“Oh don’t thank me miss! It was my pleasure! I love to see kids happy. Let me know what your son thinks of it, alright? I would love to see you back here with him again.”
Draco started making his way towards the entrance of Hogwarts. Mother sent him a letter, asking him to meet him there today. He sighed, he had no idea what this would be about.
“Shh, mommy. Draco is here. Father is gone. I will have the house elves fetch you some tea and then I’ll read to you from the storybook,” Draco spoke softly with a smile.
Narcissa dared a little glance at the paper and her heart melted. Draco had drew himself and her, holding hands. It was just a stick figure drawing, nothing more than to expect from a six year old, but to Narcissa it was the greatest artwork ever.
Draco run behind them, trying to keep up with Lucius his tall form. “Mother is right! I will learn from it!”
The dinner went better than the icecream. This time they didn’t get kicked out. They talked and talked for hours on end. After it, they both payed their parts and made their way out.
Draco shook his head desperately. “No, that is not it! I swear, father. It was my own careless mistake. I’ll do better. It is not the dragon! I haven’t played with it all morning!”
‘Potter’s are late bloomers. It is nice though. Now I can beat adorable gits in race contents,’ Harry says playfully.
Lucius answered for her. “Of course he will. Draco will uphold the family name and become Voldemorts next best man.”
Draco sat at the Slytherin table, enjoying his blueberry pancakes for breakfast. It is quite a nice day, he thought as he took a bite of his pancakes. It wasn’t too warm but not too cold either. Perfect weather to go sit under his favorite tree later today and do some study on his potio..
That was until Lucius suddenly stood up and yanked Draco out of his chair. The deatheaters started to cheer while Narcissa could only watch horrified.
I made this chocolate for you. I hope you are not allergic, although I don’t think so. I’ve seen you tons of times eating a shitload of chocolate cake. I never made chocolate myself, or tried baking at all. So, consider this a thoughtful gift. It is as a thank you, for defeating that nose-less monster. Honestly, a nose job could have fixed that. But seriously, thank you for making our lives less miserable. I could never pay you back for what you did.
Eventually, the dragon got tired of pretending to be a butterfly. With a heavy sigh, he nestles in his mother’s lap. Narcissa strokes his hair lovingly.
“Gay?” His mother smiled. “Darling, I’ve known forever. Just like I know about your crush on Harry.”
Draco looked up. “Yeah, but I did it anonymously.” Draco then procceeded to tell his mother everything that had happened, with all his terrible bakings and his new found friendship with Harry. At the end of his little rant his mother was smiling.
Her belly started to show. Narcissa loved it. It showed that he was there. A little boy was inside of her.
‘Are you sure they want me there?’ Even though the offer sounds so tempting to Draco, he still sounds insecure.
Harry knew for a while now that he is bisexual. He liked Cho and Ginny before, ofcourse. But both didn’t work out. After all, Ginny was dating Luna now. After thinking a bit, Harry found out that he actually liked Cedric a bit too much in fourth year. Luckily, nobody in his environment seemed to mind him being bisexual. Everyone was very positive about it.
“What do you all think you are doing?, I didn’t kill Voldemort just for you all to start using unneccesary violence again!” Harry exclaimed.
Finally it was over. Lucius watched his now unconscious son on the ground. “He is pitiful. I won’t let this ruin my dinner though,” he scoffed.
‘Like who, exactly? Potter, not only am I gay but I’m also an ex-deatheater. You haven’t forgotten yet, have you?’ Malfoy says matter of factly.
Thinking he was still drawing, she made her way to his room. She wanted to check on him. Perhaps she was overprotective, but she just wanted to know if he is okay.
Draco fell to the ground with a loud scream of pain. He curled up on the ground while crying out. It felt like all his nerves were on fire.
She was about to leave his room when she saw another book laying on his desk. His sketchbook. Lucius didn’t know of it so Narcissa had to hide it. She couldn’t resist looking in it though. The pages contained a new drawing. It was a green dragon with a big smile on its face. Definitely not as big as Narcissa’s when she left Draco’s room though.
Harry was sitting on his bed when he noticed a strange owl flying in with a note. Curiously, he grabbed the note and started reading.
Harry startled and looked up to find silver eyes watching him. “Fine. A bit burnt but those chocolates from last week were definitely worser,” Harry laughed.
Malfoy now sat closer to Harry than before. They were not touching yet but Harry could hear Malfoy’s breathing a bit, when they were silent. They continued the assignment peacefully. They even joked around a bit. After a while, Harry noticed he had to go use the bathroom as well. He excused himself and walked over to the eight year bathrooms.
When Harry walked towards the entrance of Hogwarts, Draco was already waiting for him. Harry was dressed in blue jeans and a Gryffindor red sweater. Draco was dressed in black jeans with a black slightly oversized sweater. Harry thought he looked amazing.
‘Gay? They don’t mind. I’m bisexual, so is Ginny. Dean and Seamus are a couple and Luna is a lesbian. Nobody minds,’ Harry tells Draco reassuring.
Narcissa fell to the ground as pain hit every nerve of her body. But she wouldn’t scream. She had to stay strong for her little dragon, for Draco.
The sound came from her personal bathroom. A little confused she knocked on the door. “Darling, are you here?”
Harry broke from his trance and quickly moved forward. He pushed the students aside so they stopped kicking Malfoy.
Narcissa made her way upstairs to check on Draco. Since Lucius wasn’t home, Draco was allowed to play around like a normal child. He would go out to play in the garden or he would go drawing in his sketchbook. He also loved to play games with Narcissa whenever she could.
Draco was looking around and then smiled at her. “Do you want me to wear pretty clothing? I’m still in my pajamas,” he said while tugging at his green pajama.
“Sir, you just found me the most perfect toy. My son will absolutely love this. He adores dragons. This will be the best birthday gift ever. Thank you so much!” Narcissa could actually kiss the guy.
With that he let the tears fall. “You are so happy now, mom. I wish you could always be happy like that. I can’t help but feel like it is my fault that you can’t be happy.”
“Lucius, no. I’ll bring him back to bed. He will learn, Lucius. He is just four..,” Narcissa begged. She knew it wouldn’t help. Lucius never had a problem with hurting Draco, no matter how small he was.
Narcissa wanted one. She dreamed of it. A life growing inside her. A little child growing up next to her. A child seeing the world for the first time. A child she would love till no end.
Ignoring Draco’s protests, he gently pushes the boy aside to see what he is hiding. To his surprise, he finds a bowl of what looks like badly mixed ingedrients, chocolate included. Next to the bowl lays a muggle cook book, open on a chocolate cake page.
Draco flinched but tried not to tremble at the hint of threat. “I’m sorry father. That was my mistake. I’ll go study book eight then. I promise that I will know it all it by tomorrow!” He tried to reason with his father.
There was a small trickle of blood coming from Malfoy’s lips and his right cheek was bruised. He was slightly holding his midribs and a bruise in the form of fingers was seen of his wrists.
So when Lucius asked her to the fifth year ball, who was she to say no? With a formal shake of the hand, she accepted.
He smiles as he looks over at his friends. They are swimming, throwing a ball to eachother. Harry had joined them before but grew a bit bored after a while. The sand is burning under his toes as he makes his way over to his towel. He quickly sits down and dries himself up the muggle way.
Lucius kept on finding new ways to hurt Draco. Spells were thrown and his cane kept on being used. Some of the deatheaters got a turn as well.
The man smiled. He was obviously in a good mood and his happiness was contagious. It put a smile on Narcissa’s face as well. After all, she was really excited to give Draco a toy tomorrow. He will be so happy and that is worth the world to Narcissa.
Lucius stood up and glared at Draco. “Perhaps I know why. I asked you to study book eight, not seven!” Lucius balled his fists.
Draco awkwardly lifted his glass and clanked it with Greyback’s. His hands were shaking and he tried to hold his heavy cup straight but unfortunately it fell through his fingers.
Harry catched Malfoy more than once crying at night, yet Harry never said anything. Malfoy must feel so lonely though. Harry knows the blonde really regrets everything he did, not even meaning to do it in the first place. It only makes Harry feel more sorrowful about the treatment others gave Malfoy now.
Draco felt someone spit on him, a harsh shove causing him to leap forward, the edge of the table stabbing him painfully in the stomach. He doesn’t care about that though. He just lost his friends.
Harry smiled and tightened his grip around the blonde. The blonde cuddled closer to Harry in responde. ‘No problem, little dragon’ Harry responded. There was no answer this time. Harry looked at his boyfriend and saw he had his eyes closed, face in a peaceful, content smile. Soft breaths were coming from the asleep blonde. Harry smiled again, taking one last look at his adorable curled up boyfriend before drifting off to sleep himself too.
Which Draco thankful did. Remembering the recipe in his bag, he started walking towards the kitchens.
- I will say to you next time I’ll go to the forest, - Luna affirms. – Friends… -. She smiles one last time before going to her afternoon lessons.
- Don’t say a word, I won’t annoy any of you if you don’t give me a reason, - I say to whoever is in the carriage. I’m spying my friends from behind the curtain. Draco see me right before the carriage leaves the station and he raise an eyebrow- seriously, why everyone is able to do it?! -. I smile innocently, sighting in relief the more far we get from that annoying brat I have as a boyfriend.
- Don’t die for your stupidity, - It’s the only thing that Blaise says to me when they realize I’m not following them at the lesson. The other two share a look and shake their heads.
- You were having fun embarrassing others, - Pansy affirms. – Just how I taught you… - she pretends to wipe away a tear.
- Absolutely! One hundred per cent! – I exclaim. We arrived at an empty class and Ron and Hermione are in front of us. When have we arrived here?
I let my focus expand, until I can feel the silent magic in the wand. The magic that is always there, waiting to link with me and transfer my energy into the outside world.
- I’m sorry to interrupt your profound thoughts, but I tend to find annoying being stared at, a feeling I’m sure you can understand –
Luna frowns thoughtfully, before suddenly lighting up. “Did you take a hagstone with you to the ritual tonight?”
Harry had fully intended to testify at Malfoy’s trial, having done so at his mother’s to support her plea. The prosecutors had also clearly expected the younger Malfoy to do some squirming of his own, with the pile of parchment they had at the ready on their table during the trial.
Luna agrees. “We’ll meet up later today after we get some rest. Draco, send us word when you’re free.”
“Like finding a professor.” At his sceptical look, Draco laughs and ruffles his hair. “You’re small and cute. Just cry and run up to a teacher and I’ll bet they’ll be falling all over themselves to help you.”
(his casting is precise and his reflexes seeker-honed. Aunt Bellatrix had also trained him out off hesitating. Painfully.). It’s more in the confident way he holds himself, the complete assurance that nothing they do would touch him.
“I keep it close to mine,” she replies, drawing close. “For when you join me for an eternity at last.”
(He would have skipped dinner altogether to get more things done but Blaise would have looked at him with his judgemental face and lectured him about setting a good example for the younger children and Draco
At that moment there’s a clattering somewhere near the entrance way and Neville’s eyes dart up. Harry turns his head to see a group of sixth-year boys clamber through the portrait hole with armfuls of wrapped sandwiches. They’re met with muted cheers as they start passing them out.
“The fates have plans for everyone,” she says. “But yours are quite interesting, even if they’re not… as
But then again, there is very little about the current Malfoy walking the halls of Hogwarts that he is familiar with. His gait, the way he holds his shoulders. His friendship with Luna. Even his pointy face looks different somehow, though all the features are still the same.
“Julian and Antonius.” Blaise turns his head slightly to smirk at him with one bleary eye, cheek creased by his pillow. “There’s a joke in there, somewhere.”
Something in the way Luna’s voice hardened then turns Malfoy’s head. The loss of his gaze feels like a physical release.
Well, that’s stupid! A whole different way to practice magic, and nobody ever thought to find out more?
- Harry Potter got himself a punishment, - Blaise answers in the while. Then immediately puts a hand on his mouth, as to erase the words he has just said. It’s useless. The bomb has been dropped.
Depp breaths. I must take deep breaths. I’m fine. My aunt is not here. She can’t find me here. I’m fine. I’m fine.
Now that the adrenaline of the panic-essay is gone, I find myself yawning. But no. I should really pay attention to the lesson, it will help me with studying later. I take my goose quill, I dip it in the ink and lift my head to watch the professor.
Aaannnddd that's it. The first Hogwarts day for Aurora! She's not exactly a... model student, as I'm sure you couldn't say by the chapter!
I jump up. – Thestrals?! Where?! I want to see them! Oh wait… well… that wasn’t exactly what I intended… -
Blaise, who was walking next to Draco, doesn’t even ask. He nods in approval and follows Pansy and Ron out of the corridor, on the stairs.
I know, it's more a filling chapter, but I hope you enjoyed it anyway! I'm trying my best to make you know Aurora more and more, and also her relantionship with the others!
I share a worried look with Pansy before knelling in front of our friend. Draco follows Blaise suggestions and for some minutes we just stay silent, watching the panic leaving him slowly.
- I thought we already decided I was arrogant, - it’s my sharp answer. – Now, shut up and open your ears, for how hard I know it’s for you: our parents may have decide what the hell they wanted, but I won’t obey them. I am a person of my own will and I will do whatever I want. Either you leave me alone, or you’re on my way -. The smile fades from my face as I stare him with ice in my eyes. – And no one ends well when he’s on my way –
- You said that only to make him stop? – this is Hermione. She’s looking at me and I can’t understand what she’s thinking.
Dying? Ok, could have been worse. Being teleported in another universe from the books I loved as I child? Beautiful! Having the possibility to give your favorite characters the development you always dreamed to see? I can’t wait!
So. The occidental world has always done this, so they don’t even think there could be another way. The oriental world… No books about it, but if I think about their traditions, I can see a sort of pattern they could have used for magic.
I do it again. And again. And again. Until I can recognize my wand’s magic from my energy even when they connect and became one.
- Let them, - she says. I sigh and sit next to her. The fire crackles and warm us up and I curl up on the sofa yawning. I see a couple of students studying on another sofa -the first day? Seriously guys? – and some first year watching the lake, fascinated.
Madame Pomfrey doesn’t seem really happy to have four students in the infirmary the very first day. She fix my wrist in a second, but right when I’m asking her if I can go to the banquet, she affirms I have to stay in the infirmary for the night.
I hide a yawn. And I thought theory of magic would be interesting… I wonder if there are lessons that explain why the first witches and wizards decided to use magic wands and didn’t try other paths. In the Harry Potter books all the wands are done by magic components… And the right wands is the one that enter in syntony with the magic user and his magic…
Draco goes to bed. Eventually. After two hours of comments on Harry Potter annoying character. I spend this time sharing desperate looks with Blaise.
I find myself smiling again. Miles is halfway towards me, hands raised as he was, what, thinking of throwing me down the stairs?
- Wake up! – she shouts. – You need to help me in this! I will not suffer another year of annoying pining with sarcastic comments! –
I let go his wrist and turn around to finally find some quiet place to work on my magic without idiot’s interruptions. I’m at the top of the stairs when I hear him.
Yep, I like this idea. Also, I have some good troubles I can finally start to do here without punishments if my exercises with magic keep this way! I’ll finally have some fun!
- There are some good books about it in the History of Magic department, in the Spells department and in the Theory of Magic department, but if you search for more precise information, you’ll need to go to the prohibited section and for that you’ll need a permission from a professor – .
- I think I’ll read the books not in the prohibited section for now, - I sigh. She nods and help me to find the better ones, then leaves me at my research.
I start to write down the spells I know between the cat and the bunnies I draw earlier, and then try to think about what symbol to use. It can’t be something casual, I need to remember it easily.
- If he stop being an idiot, it’s okay, - it’s my answer. Then I turn and get out the secret passage. The entrance hall is empty, all the students must have already left to go the lessons and Pansy must be somewhere disposing the anger.
After these two lessons we can finally eat something. I have half an idea of not going to history lesson and go to the library instead, starting to see if there are some books that explain how wands and our magic work together… It’ll be more interesting than staring at the empty while a ghost talk about the most epic battles with a voice so boring that it seems to be listing what to buy at the grocery store.
- How. They. Can. Be. So. STUPID! – it’s my calm, relaxed answer while I raise my head from the table.
Ok, if you find the english worse than the other chapters, say immediately to me! I just studied chinese grammar for hours and lost half of my neurons, I don't even know in what language I'm thinking right now...
- I do! – he almost exclaims, before realizing we’re at the library and he doesn’t want to get killed by Madame Pince. He walks until he can sit next to me.
- I know I’m not the Head of the Slytherin’s house, - she affirms. – But I worry about your future: you should seriously think about what you want to do after Hogwarts, and work for that. Transfiguration is a necessary subject to a lot of carriers, so I expect you to take it seriously –
We arrive at the class. I stop at the threshold, half -or more- of an idea to run away from my misery.
We can find a way to give direction and will to our magic without wands or spells! Magic lives in us, after all, the magic components of the wands only make it easier for us to access it… If my theory is right, I have to understand how wands do that and so how to it alone!
- Just shut up and listen to us, - Pansy affirm. If one day she’ll be gentle with me, I’ll know something is wrong.
I don’t know how much time we stay here, in silence, in peace, observing these creatures. Slowly, the thestrals feel less scared and get closer, letting us touch them. Me and Luna help Ginny to understand where they are, and the smile on her face when she finally caresses one of them is priceless.
- Your parents were there, - he decides to talk. I raise both my eyebrow, since raising one is Mission Impossible for me.
They don’t realize I didn’t go to History of Magic. No professor came to scold me, so I take it as a full win! My friends don’t even try to stop me.
Eventually, we go back to our dormitories. Eventually, we say goodbye to each other still smiling and walk away. Eventually, Pansy’s jokes on my stupid happy expression. Eventually, I fall asleep feeling light and relaxed.
I don’t even take two steps, that someone grab my wrist and force me to turn. I can’t stop the surprised and painful scream. I find myself staring at a very frowned face and an aggressive expression. Surprise of surprise, it’s Miles Bletchley.
He stares at me for some more moments -who knows, maybe to raise suspense. He fails, if that’s what he’s trying to do.
- You know what? I reconsidered, - Pansy glares at him with disgust in her eyes. – You’re totally useless, idiotic piece of shit -. She turns and get out the secret passage. I’m following her -before I end up really hitting one of the main characters- when Hermione jump trying to stop me. I don’t think. I only see a figure jumping towards me.
- Sure -. Draco is so used to Pansy’s evil mouth that he doesn’t even try to understand what she means. He takes two toasts and starts to eat. His eyes moves occasionally to the Gryffindor table.
up, she really is short!) – My parents work at the Ministry of Magic, and this morning I heard Harry Potter talking about you-know-who again, and I find it so offensive! To keep sharing fake news just to gain attention! –
- You already know you’re annoying, I don’t need to remind you, - it’s my answer. She bring a hand to her hurt as she’s hurt and fall in her chair.
I keep running once out, in case he’s following me outdare too. I arrive to the first floor before dying out of oxygen. I step in an empty class and fall to the ground, heavily breathing.
Professor is waiting for me in the office with a severe posture and a severe but worried look. Ouch. This meeting is already going bad.
- Sorry! – Pansy exclaims, and honestly, she could do better to try to hide the laugh from her voice. Ron gets up and stumbles on his foot, falling to Draco who’s passing by. Draco ends up next to Harry in the ground of the class. Immediately, Pansy closes the door and seals it with a spell. We hear the two of them knocking at the door shouting angry.
We wait until they walk away. Only then we realize she’s still holding my wrist. She immediately leaves it smiling in excuse.
- So, - I look at Draco. – Screw them. If you like Harry Potter, just go and say it to him. Choose to be with him and damn what our parents think. This is your life, not theirs –
- Thank you, mister Bletchley, for letting me go, you’re not completely stupid, apparently, - and I improvise a little bow, showing him the most annoying smile I can do.
- You will give me the respect you have to! – he’s very close to screaming. I tilt my head, asking myself if a broken wrist would worth him finally screaming and losing his face in front of everyone. I mean, it’s not the worst pain I ever felt! I think the worst pain - and it’s a difficult competition! - it’s the truck that killed me. This is nothing!
Once I’m sure I’m not gonna die, I get up. It’s late, and if someone catches me out of the dormitory, I’ll be punished… but only if they catch me!
Pansy puts her arm on my shoulder. – No, - she says. – She will look at you with her disappointed expression, making you feel like you just committed the worst crime in the whole world, and then she’ll scold you in front of the class. Only then she’ll kill you –
She takes a very deep breath, probably to convince herself not to kill me. – It’s Draco, - she finally says. – And Harry Potter –
This… is the most stupid thing I ever heard. What is it, medieval age?! Who the hell came up with this stupid idea?! It’s a stupid plot device for drama! And I never asked for drama, thank you so much!
My last thought is how much I’m lucky to die: at least I won’t have to face the disgusting face of my aunt and her realization that all the years she spent calling me a useless piece of trash she was, in fact, right.
- I will show you exactly what happens to who doesn’t respect me! – he finally shouts. And he jump to grab me.
I drink the tea without saying a word, hoping that drinking something real will help the situation to make sense. It doesn’t.
Before I can do further questions, she grabs my hand and starts to run into the forest. I mean, I have absolutely nothing against it, since it was exactly what I was planning to do. Having a free guide is a good surprise.
- You were… not completely wrong yesterday, - it’s Draco the first one to talk. – This is our life, and our parents shouldn’t control it –
I almost giggle. Almost. Because there’s no way I start my second life in the world of my dreams killing my dignity!
- You’ve sit in the wrong place at the banquet the first year, - It’s Pansy’s answer. She doesn’t even try to deny she’s evil.
Oh no. I think I know this sweet voice. I turn very, very slowly. Here she is. The nightmare. The most hated character of the whole saga. The real villain of the story. Dolore Umbridge.
- Oh, don’t worry, - I smile innocently. – I know you’ll marry Ron and have three beautiful red head kids! And I mean, he may be not my type, but I can understand why you like him… - I wink.
- How can you don’t understand!? – he shouts. – Our parents are death eaters! He’s the Chosen One! –
- Why not? – I reply, leaning on the wall with a smirk. – My personal savior: I would be so lost without you –
- A solution? We can’t disobey our parents, you know what happens when we don’t listen to them! – this is Draco.
More Ginny and Luna next chapter, and Draco finally realizing he has a crush on Harry! And of course, troubles and experiments!
- I asked you if you understood the theory of the transfiguration of living beings without harming them even if we transform them in non-living objects –
- Are you kidding?! – I jumped up. – This is the most beautiful talisman I ever had! I will wear it in a way that everyone can see it! –
I’m a disaster. I know that, it’s like the only thing I know for sure about me. A freaking human disaster. Only, I hoped changing universe would be… good for that aspect of myself?
- Being the most annoying human being ever until he runs away and prays his parents to brake the engagement, - I affirm.
But they ignore my desperate look. Blaise gets up with a smile and Pansy winks at me before they leave. I dedicate them my best “you’re gonna pay for this” glare, but they don’t seem afraid. I must exercise at the mirror to became scarier!
- We need to think about a plan, - she continues. – So use you’re shitty troublemaker brain and help me! –
For a moment he’s genuinely surprised, enough to loosen his grip on my arm. I take advantage from this beautiful moment: free again, I walk towards the stairs. Ugh, I need to work on my project in some quieter place to take off the drama of this scene from me. It still have the chills. Ugh, really!
- You’re right, - Harry nods. He seems to have only half of his attention to the conversation. Who knows what he’s thinking about: Voldemort? The war and how no one says anything to him to protect him? Or the scariest thought: McGonagall test next week!
With another sight, I get out and walk to Hogsmeade. Even just a little walk will make me feel better.
I don’t… I don’t do boyfriends! I don’t do relationships in general, but a boyfriend involves feeling, and being intimate, and…
A deep breath. I close my eyes again. I think of the light. A little, tiny sparkle on the fingertip. I let my energy, my magic flowing in me and reaching my hand, my fingers… my fingertip. I open my eyes and I see the tiny sparkle on it.
- Do you think I’m sad? – I ask. I realize only later I’ve been a little rude. I’m going to say sorry, when I see a little bracelet in front of my eyes. I turn to look at Luna. She’s smiling softly, her clear blue eyes looking at me directly. But I don’t feel like she’s trying to study me, it’s more like she’s embracing me gently.
- It’s just that the kid isn’t actually angry, and when he is, it’s not for the reasons he keeps repeating to himself. His friends, who had witnessed this for years, decide to act to end the suffering of all, but the kid still refuses to understand what he’s feeling, he keeps thinking he’s just furious and can’t bear the other kid presence. Even when he wants so bad to keep interacting with him. Even if he’s scared one day the other kid will stop paying attention to him. Even if his feelings seem to only grow every day –
- Here it is! – I lift it to show her. She sighs -people tend to do it when they have to do with me- and takes it.
From their faces, that wasn’t exactly the answer they were expecting. It seems like I will keep surprise people this year! I can’t say I’m sorry!
- You should really stop eating that much, - he says throwing the food on my bed. – You’re not like Pansy who remains skinny no matter what she eats… -
- It’s been beautiful, - Luna says once we arrived at the entrance of the castle. – It was like you were my friends – she smiles.
Magic without wands. Spells to be conserved. Both are incredibly useful! The first one is something nobody expect: an
We stop only after ten minutes of running -and my poor lungs dying -. With my surprise, sitting at the feet of a great oak tree, there’s Luna Lovegood. I immediately find myself forgetting the fatigue.
There it is. The certain feeling that something will go wrong. I just hope the fifth department didn’t add more drama, I have very little patience with the already present one, thank you very much.
- If you accept suggestions, next time you want peace, try an empty class, - Ginny affirms. – I can’t be always there to save you, - she winks.
- I can’t do this, - I shake my head. – I need a break, or this situation will end with a suicide-homicide –
So. From my notes, it’s clear that magic users have their wands to help them with their magic, but suppress their instinctive use of it that way. When they’re children, they feel the magic inside of them, use them driven by emotions or stress. Growing up, always using wands, they lose the habit to feel it themselves and giving it orders without help.
- Mister Bletchley, let Miss Reckless go and follow me to the head office -. McGonagall seems livid. Her voice is like ice. I’m loving her every moment more!
Oh, who cares! Draco Malfoy is sitting at my left! In the Hogwarts Express! That’s heading to Hogwarts!
- Are you thinking of not going to the afternoon lessons, again? – a familiar voice tease me from a three at the border of the forest. A second later, Ginny lands in front of me, a grin on her face, eyes sparkling.
Dinner got served and Greyback turned his eyes on Draco. Draco was still looking at his lap, his hands trembling just slightly from anxiety.
“Why don’t I help you finish that chocolate cake, and then I take you to Hogsmeade next Saturday?” Harry asks.
“No problem. And what else were I supposed to do? Just leave you there? I’m not like that,” Harry said. He was surprised Malfoy actually thanked him.
Harry immediately understood. He was scared of the thunder! Harry tightened his grip on the Slytherin. ‘Dray, I won’t laugh at you. Never.’
Draco read the letter his mother sent him back in confusion. How would mother know about Harry? He never even told her! Shrugging, he grabbed the recipe attached to the letter.
‘It isn’t silly to be scared of thunderstorms! Totally not. And you are not a loser. You really aren’t. Don’t you ever think of yourself like that!’ Harry said, not liking Draco basically calling himself a loser when he was clearly not!
‘Fuck, Harry, I-.. Sorry. We are not even friends for an hour and I already fucked up,’ Draco sounds frustrated, hiding his face in his hands.
She tried to hold back the tears but eventually they fell down her cheeks. A little finger wiped them away.
Narcissa continued her search. He wasn’t in the library, not in the study and also not in the ballroom.
Bellatrix giggles echoed through the room. “... and then I cut his heart out and watched as it took its last beats. Truly fascinating. If I were a disgusting muggle, I would be a biology teacher,” she laughed.
Lucius apologized after that mistake. Later, he apologized for a second mistake. A third, fourth and fifth time followed. Soon, he stopped apologizing.
The professor then ended class and Harry and Draco parted ways, both going to different classes. Walking to the hallways, Harry felt that strange stomach feeling again. He shrugged it off as he entered his classroom.
Seeing that her son wasn’t reacting, she changed the subject. “So, did you give Harry the brownies yet?”
Narcissa sat in the living room next morning. Lucius sat in front of her in his green armchair. They were waiting for Draco to come down. Narcissa had taken her time wrapping up the gift perfectly. The wrapping paper she used was dark green with golden sprinkles. She had written his name in a fancy way on it.
The man nodded in understanding fortunately. “I can help you with that, no worries. So I am assuming that he has a big fantasy? If he likes stories and drawing..,” The curly haired man said.
“You mean sex! I mean yes but he will be rather talented in the carving part. You like drawing, don’t you?” Someone Draco didn’t even know said.
Harry lay in his bed. He got his own room now, just like all the other eight year students. McGonagall had decided that it would be good to give students a bit of privacy now. Harry liked having his own room. It was peaceful and quiet. And he definitely didn’t miss Ron’s snoring. Or hearing Dean and Seamus doing things together when they thought everyone was asleep. Merlin, that was awkward.
Brownies, he could do that. It didn’t look that hard. Scanning the paper over, he smiled. Yes, Harry is definitely gonna like those.
Harry’s cheeks flushed and before he could have second thoughts he scooped the blonde into his arms and hugged him tightly. The blonde responded to the hug immediately. They melted into eachothers touch for what seemed like forever, none of them saying a word. Something about this felt so right. As if they were eachothers missing puzzle piece.
‘I don’t like the ferret but nobody deserves to get called out like that for their sexuality,’ Ron murmers, people humming in agreement.
Draco kept writing in his notebook. “After the war, at a muggle place,” he answered. “Do you.. do you like it?”
“This might seem like a boring dragon figure but it isn’t. It can fly as long as you hold your hand under it. Next to that, it will breath fire occasionally. But don’t worry, the fire is fake and can’t actually burn your child!” The man smiled brightly and showed it to Narcissa. He held his hand under the toy and soon the dragon was flying and breathing little puffs of fire.
Lucius be damned. Narcissa wasn’t going to sleep with him tonight. No way she would. She never wanted to sleep with him anymore after he became abusive. But Lucius would get angry if she didn’t.
“He is doing okay now. He had some broken ribs and bruises but Pomfrey healed them all,” Harry looked at Hermione sighing sadly. “He is fine now though. He is asleep.”
Draco had been on the edge of the couch the whole time, almost bouncing up and down in barely contained excitement. He grinned happily.
Harry takes out his hand. Malfoy seemed to debate in his head, before grabbing onto Harry’s hand as Harry lead them out of the hall. Whispers break loose in the hall but Harry had gotten them out already.
‘For years? Merlin, Draco. Then I guess I should introduce you to my friends fast,’ Harry takes Draco’s hand in his.
The deatheaters laughed obnoxiously. “He will catch some muggles for us and torture them!” Someone called.
I heard you didn’t like my chocolate last week. That is fine. Me in the kitchen is just a disaster waiting to happen. Doesn’t stop me though from trying again. This time I made you brownies, which I hope you like. You prove yourself to be a bloody kind Gryffindor over and over again. I should find it annoying but I am rather attracted to it. So thank you again, for being you.
Harry looked the note over again. “Well, they’ve got a nice hand-writing. Neat and curly, so I am guessing a girl.”
As time passed, they started making their way back to Hogwarts, hands connected. Ignoring the looks they got, they made their way to the Room of Requirement. The Room changed itself into a comfortable looking bedroom, their pajamas already sprawled on the bed.
Harry didn’t let Malfoy finish his rambling. ‘Don’t worry. Really, I don’t mind. Besides, you’re cute when you are asleep.’ Well fuck. He didn’t mean to say that.
Harry grins, leaning back and enjoying the sun on his face. They keep silent for a minutes till he hears Draco calling his name.
“But is that really necessary? Maybe this should just be a lesson. I think he will learn from it, even if we don’t throw the toy away.”
Harry sighed sadly and put a hand on the blonde’s shoulder. ‘Malfoy, they are not real friends. Real friends don’t treat you that way. Real friends treat you with respect.’
After a few minutes of being in eachothers embrace, Draco looked up at Harry. Grey met green. Harry’s breathing went up and he noticed Draco breathing faster too. Draco then pulled himself up from Harry’s chest to meet Harry’s eyes. And lips. Before Harry knew it. Draco pulled his arms around him and kissed him.
Little fists were pounding on her chest. Her face was wet by tears that weren’t her own. A kiss was pressed to her lips.
Draco’s face grows more serious. ‘I don’t think things would have been much different. I was a big git back then and you have always been way too good to put up with that. War changed people. Maybe it is good that we only just became friends, as we can get to know eachother as our real selves,’ Draco says softly.
Lucius sighed. “At least get him a wizard toy then. He only gets to play with it half an hour a day. I will return the toy immediately if I see any bad signs,” he said.
Narcissa smiled at him. “I’m looking for a toy to give to my son. He turns eight tomorrow. I just don’t really know what to get him.”
Harry looked up. Malfoy was staring at him, silver eyes boring a hole into his soul. His blond hair fell softly past his face, some locks in front of his eyes. He was already in his Slytherin robes. What Harry noticed the most were his ears that were pierced, something that matches the many rings on his fingers.
Draco did as he was told and soon the dragon was flying above his hand and breathing fire. Draco looked in amazement and happiness. “It flies! Look at that!”
He walked over to the muggle section and quickly spotted a cookbook. He took it, ignoring the strange looks he got from the librarian. He sat down in an empty hallway and went through the book. He stopped on page 87. A chocolate cake. That sounded brilliant to him. He marked the page and walked back to the dorms, determined to try this cake out tonight.
She reached her arms out and immediately her arms were filled by the blond boy. She ruffled his hair while pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Draco bit his lips, getting uncomfortable. He had to go away, now. He felt the panic building up in his chest. ‘Guys, I need to go use the restroom. I’ll see you at transfiguration alright?’ Draco made a move to leave but Theo pulled him back down.
‘Stop right there, Malfoy. You have never wanted to do these things you did. Your father manipulated you into this mess. They gave you no choice. I could see it. Your heart was never into the things you did. Your heart was in those cookies though, and all those other attemps to make things right. The real you is coming out,’ Harry finishes in one breath. ‘Don’t torture yourself over things you never had control over.’
What is Draco doing in the kitchens? Harry laughs to himself. A pureblood like him must have never been in the kitchens before. Maybe he had some night cravings? That must be it, as Harry can’t find another logic reason.
Narcissa smiled at the kind man. “Call me Narcissa. I definitely will but it might take awhile before I’ll be able to visit again. Maybe I should owl you my son’s reaction?”
It was all Draco’s fault. If he was better then maybe he and mom could have moments like this forever and always. If he was better then mom wouldn’t drink too much wine and cry herself to sleep. If he was better then everything would be better.
Bellatrix took her aside. “Lucius is gonna get you a great place within the Dark Lord’s circle. You are lucky, Cissy, so lucky.”
Draco smiled brightly and stood on his tiptoe’s to reach Narcissa’s face. She knelt down to give him better acces. Draco placed a kiss on her cheek and then giggled.
Lucius was sitting on her left. His long blond hair was falling gracefully over his shoulders. His cane rested carefully against his high chair.
“Thank you, Pomfrey. But there is no need to. I’m fine and there are no names to report. I am just.. clumsy,” Draco lied.
“Because I am not,” Narcissa exclaimed. “Look at me, dragon. I want you to be happy. And Harry sounds like a great guy. You should go for it,” she smiled at her son.
“So, Malfoy, feeling better? I didn’t hear you come in last night. Must have been asleep already,” Harry said as he kept watching the blonde.
Lucius turned to Draco with a warning sneer. He then smiled a bit nervously at Greyback. “He is probably too lost in his own future dreams about becoming a deatheater. Isn’t that right, Draco?” Lucius spoke warningly.
I am really sorry for the delay tho :( School proved itself to be more busy than expected! For you all who are also in school: goodluck!!!)
Harry smiled. This person was definitely not a Gryffindor. This person sounds very sarcastic as well. Harry rather liked it.
“Don’t you think that it is time that he starts receiving birthday gifts?” Narcissa asked carefully. Anything could piss Lucius off nowadays and Narcissa didn’t want that to happen right now.
“No, he doesn’t. He wasn’t one by choice, nor is he one anymore. Leave, now,” Harry spoke in a low voice.
“Feeling fine. And yeah, everyone was asleep already.” Malfoy awkwardly fidgeted around with the rings on his fingers before looking up to Harry, leaving Harry with that strange stomach feeling again.
Lucius needed some new parchment and Narcissa wanted this necklace. That is why they found themselves in Diagon Alley on this sunny day.
After relieving himself, Harry looked in the mirror while washing his hands. His cheeks were a bit red, Harry thought. Was that because of Malfoy? They had been so.. close? And Malfoy had been so nice and gentle. Harry found himself actually enjoying his company. Damn. Harry secretly hoped that they would stay on speaking terms after this assignment. Something about Malfoy made Harry feel a bit warm inside. Wait, what?
Draco smiled happily and went to sit down next to Narcissa. He then eyed the present. Surprise and excitement started to show in his eyes as he looked up at his mother.
She sat back in one of the couches and desperately tried to dry her eyes. The house elf, Marty, was looking at her with big eyes.
Narcissa smiled. “Alexander is quite the lovely name as well. Well then, I must go then. Pleasure to meet you, Alex.”
Narcissa heard Draco whimpering in fear and then moving to hide behind her. “He just has a stomach ache, Lucius. I’ll get him a potion. Go back to sleep,” she said calmly.
The man nodded. “Such a beautiful name, Narcissa. My name is Alex, short for Alexander. You can just owl the store but with the name Alex on it! I would love to hear from you.”
Tears watered her eyes and she had to bit her lip to stop herself from crying. She took a deep breath and then called a house elf for some wine.
Harry dried his hands and made a return to the couch when an adorable sight made him stop. Malfoy had fallen asleep. He lay curled up on the couch, resting a bit against the side of the couch. His eyes were closed and his breath was soft and even. He looked so damn peaceful, it made Harry melt a bit inside.
Harry sent Draco a look. They stared at eachother for a few seconds before bursting out in laughter yet again. The man who came to sent them away looked so angry, his eyes killing.
‘I’m going over,’ Harry said. He walks over to Malfoy, ignoring the looks he got as he kneels down to the level of the shaking blonde.
Malfoy sits there, with his friends. Theo Nott is waving around the Daily Prophet, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle all taking turns to read it. They snicker and seem to be making rude remarks. Meanwhile Malfoy just looks confused.
Narcissa woke up by the soft whisper of her four year old son. “Hey, little Dragon,” she whispered back, careful not to wake Lucius. He would get angry at Draco for being awake and for being in their room. “What is wrong?”
Harry noticed that Malfoy explained things very nicely and calm, sometimes stopping to ask if Harry followed him and if he had any questions. Harry definitely preferred Malfoy’s teaching over Snape’s or Slughorns.
Narcissa wanted to grab his hand. Tell him that it would be okay. Mommy can handle this. Mommy is strong enough. But she couldn’t.
Unfortunstely, trouble started to occur only a few days later. Lucius called Draco to his office. Narcissa stood at the door, listening to what was happening inside there.
The students who were attacking Malfoy quickly left, leaving Harry alone with the blonde Slytherin on the floor.
‘Yep, took me till this year to realize. I noticed that I started to take quite a liking to blonde oblivious guys,’ Harry grinned.
And then it hits Harry. Chocolate cake. Chocolate... Bad bakings... Sarcastic notes. Draco is his secret admirer. And Harry caught him right in the act.
“Ron, don’t be that way,” Hermione exclaimed annoyed at her boyfriend. “And really Harry? That is great.”
Hermione glanced over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was eating a blueberry muffin with a glass of tea on his right. So now and then, he glanced over at the Gryffindor table. Hermione knew it. It made a lot of sense too. She hoped Harry would realise soon because they would be actually good for eachother. Hermione was rooting for it.
“No, you are right. You are not like that. But I would have deserved it,” Malfoy said in a sad tone.
Hermione shoved some potatoes his way. “Neville is helping Ron with his herbology essay. Why are you so late? You weren’t in the common room, nor the library!” Hermione exclaimed.
Narcissa just said nothing as she helped Draco change into his pajamas. She was about to tuck him into bed when he turned red.
Narcissa closed her eyes. That last comment will go through her husbands head forever. She rapidly thought of something that she could do but to her own horror she came up with nothing.
Harry smiles at him. ‘So I’ve noticed. Doesn’t mean I want to be there too. I’m good right where I am.’
Draco couldn’t keep his curiousity in him anymore. He snatched the paper from Blaise and read it over. He frowned.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Oh please, I am over that. We were all victims of the war. He had no choice. It not his fault he got placed in that family. And he never meant it. He was just scared.”
‘Ehh yeah. Do you- do you need some help?’ Malfoy sounded a bit insecure. Which was quite strange coming from the once so confident Slytherin.
It had gone fast after the ball. Plenty of Hogsmeade dates, sneaking in broodsheds after 1am and romantic picknicks at the lake. It was perfect. Too perfect.
‘Alright, good,’ Harry smiled softly as Malfoy started to breath normal again. ‘You are not alone Malfoy. There are people out here who are willingly to accept you for who you are.’
Draco swayed along the music. “Not because of father. I just like the color green and I want to be ambitious like you! You were a cool Slytherin.”
His mother is already standing there, smiling and walking up towards him. Before Draco can say something, his mother gave him a bone-crashing hug. He stays in the hug for awhile, enjoying the warmth and safety of his mother. Eventually they pull apart.
“You are trying so hard, little dragon. I’m sure Harry appreciates that. And I think the chance is big that he might likes you back.”
I am doing good, thank you for asking honey. Teddy and Andromeda are doing well too. Teddy learned to change his hair blue, which is very amusing.
“I’ll get him something then. I’ll meet you again here,” she said dryly. With that she made her way to the toy store.
Harry sighed and made his way to the great hall for dinner. Once there, he spotted Hermione waiting for him.
The rest of the deatheaters laughed along with her as more went to share their crazy stories with them. All of them were really gruesome and explicit. The more cruel, the harder they laughed.
He would lay curled up in bed, clutching his stuffed dragon. Mother would sit on the edge of the bed telling him stories about a certain lion. The lion had beat the mean, evil monster. The monster who Lucius worshipped. But the lion won from him. One day, the lion would defeat him for once and for all. Once that would happen, the evil would disseappear out of the world. One day, Narcissa said, the lion would save all the dragons in the world!
He took a tiny bite of one of the brownies and smiled in satisfaction. This must be tasting better than the disaster of the week before. He got a box and carefully laid out the brownies in it. He put a fancy red ribbon on it and attached his note to it.
The flowers, especially the roses are doing well. The Narcisses you planted are doing wonderful too.
Lucius turned around, fire shining in his mercury eyes. “Mother is never right. I am the one who is always right. We are getting rid of the stupid thing and you will keep your stupid mouth shut about it!”
His mother chuckled. “You thought I wouldn’t know what is going on between you two? I’m your mother. I see those things,” she smiles.
Harry’s eyes shine. ‘Ofcourse I want that. You are a funny guy. Nice to be around. I wish I had took your hand in first year. Think of how different things would have been between us.’
Narcissa felt her son stiffening. She grabbed his hand and glared at Lucius. “I’m taking Draco to his room. We are going to study.”
“Is mistress Narcissa doing okay? Does mistress need help from Marty?” He asked while handing her a bottle of wine.
They stayed silent for a couple of minutes, in which Harry gently rubbed the Slytherin’s back. Eventually Malfoy speaks up, clearly upset.
They arrived at the icecream place shortly after. They placed their order, Harry a caramel icecream and Draco a green apple icecream, and went to sit down with their icecream.
I hope you enjoy this chapter! There is a lot of Narcissa and Draco fluff and a bit of a vulnerable moment between them.
Harry knows what article they might be discussing. The news of the gay seeker. It didn’t bother Harry or his friends at all. No one had really cared when Harry came out as bisexual. ‘I just want you to be happy mate,’ Ron had said, eating a chicken wing.
Narcissa opened the bathroom door. She could barely contain her laughter when she saw what was going on inside.
Draco jumped from her lap and started walking around in childlike energy. “Okay! I can keep a secret. Pinky promise?”
Harry bit his lips as he watched how the Slytherin breaks down in front of everyone. He was crying, shaking and gasping for breath. Hermione and Ron look horrified, so do others.
The thunder seemed to finally have stopped. In the past minutes Harry and Draco had already lay down, Draco still buried against Harry’s chest. Harry had a protective arm around Draco. Harry started to drift off to sleep when he heard a soft whisper.
Lucius didn’t control their lives for a week and things never felt more free. They could finally let go.
Greyback grinned, his bloody teeth showing. “Well then... Cheers, little boy,” he said as he held out his glass of champagne.
“Quite obvious,” Ernie spoke. “All these girls are basically on their knees for you. I bet it was that Hufflepuff girl from two days ago.”
An hour later, two soaking wet boys walk towards their bags on the beach, wrapping themself up in towels as they sit next to eachother.
Lucius sneered at her but there was amusement tingling in his eyes. “How do you know what a biology teacher is, Bella?”
Narcissa closed her eyes but didn’t move. She felt little hands tugging at her ankles. Draco, she knew. He was asking her to step aside. Her little boy wanted to take the pain if it meant that she wouldn’t get hurt. Still, Narcissa shaked her head. She’d take everything if it meant that her little dragon would be okay.
‘My mother gave it to me when I was five,’ Draco whispered. ‘She said it would protect me from the monsters.’
Once back in his dorms he noticed Malfoy wasn’t back yet. ‘Must still be sleeping’ he thought. Shrugging, he went to sleep after doing some homework.
Harry looked over and had to hold in a gasp. Harry’s arms were over Malfoy’s waist, hugging the blonde close to himself. Malfoy had his head buried in Harry’s chest.
He put one arm under Malfoy’s knees and one under his shoulder. He carried him up and brought the Slytherin to his chest. Merlin, he was currently fucking carrying Malfoy bridal style. The boy in question stirred a bit but made no sign of waking up. Instead, his head fell against Harry’s chest.
Narcissa chuckled. “The Slytherin robes would look gorgeous on you, darling. Just know that I don’t mind which house you get. Every house is beautiful in its own way,” she smiled.
He would then grab her to turn her around in a gentle way. She would stare into his grey eyes and then close her own. They would kiss on this very own dance floor.
Draco smiled. ‘Yes, mother always said that one day the lion will save all the dragons. And you did. You are the lion. It makes sense. You beat the monster more than once. And after all you are a Gryffindor.’
Lucius glared back. “Fine. I expect you to know everything by tomorrow,” with that he left the room.
Malfoy spoke again, ‘Look, see this potion? It is beetroot based. Which means that..,’ Malfoy explained. ‘...so that is why it shouldn’t be used on people with bood-type A.’
“Oh yeah, ehmm..,” Harry debated whether he should tell the truth or not. He decided to go with the truth. “I saw Malfoy being attacked in the hallways. I helped him to the hospital wing.”
‘Merlin, yes. Ofcourse I do! Fuck, Harry!’ Before Harry can process that information, lips are pressed on his.
Harry sits at the great hall, bored out of his mind. He didn’t feel like joining in on the on-going conversations at the Gryffindor table. Taking a sip of his juice, he looks over the great hall, stopping at the Slytherin table.
“Well..,” Harry started. “We were talking about what happened yesterday, with the attack. He thought he deserved it and I told him that he didn’t. We talked for a short while and eventually he told me to call him Draco. He calls me Harry now.”
They kept dancing for hours till no end. Dancing until their feet grew tired and the music lost its sway. Dancing until they lay down on the ballroom floor, listening to the last notes of ‘La Vie en rose’ by Édith Piaf.
“Ofcourse honey, don’t worry about it so much. I trust in it,” Narcissa smiled. “I must go now, I’m babysitting Teddy today. I’ll see you again soon dear.”
Narcissa put down her wine glass. “He isn’t adult yet though. He won’t be a part of this anytime soon.”
Harry feels a bit of guilt pang right through him. At the beginning of the eight year Malfoy had tried his best to apologize to everyone. One day he had even come into the shared common room with cookies he made himself. Harry thought it was a kind gesture, it looked like Malfoy had put a lot of effort in it. The others ignored Malfoy though, not even acknowledging him or his cookies.
“He’s never going to learn how to be a true Malfoy if you let him off the hook everytime he makes a mistake.”
‘C’mon then, let’s get out of here,’ Harry says softly, watching as the blonde turned to look at him with those shining grey eyes.
Narcissa stiffened. It was an innocent question, she knew. Just curiousity from a little child. Personally, Narcissa didn’t have a problem with gay people. She accepted them just like she would accept a straight couple. After all, love is love.
After two really long minutes of waiting, here he is: Harry Potter, searching for his friends with a frown in his face. He walk into the corridor where Pansy and Ron are waiting. From the opposite part of the corridor, Draco.
"Ok. Whatever others say about it, it wasn’t my intention to make the Slytherin’s dormitory explode."
Draco sighs. – You take her to the infirmary, I’m gonna take some food from the banquet and I’ll join you –
- Those are the conditions for our help, - she insists. I look at Pansy: she’s bored like me, but we can’t suffer a whole year of endless pining. We sigh and nod.
- I was looking for you, - Ginny walks to me completely ignoring the worm. – My brother said you can’t give up and that “the battle’s just started”, whatever that means –
Transfiguration is… boring as hell. I thought it would be incredibly interesting, with all the schemes and rules of magic to learn to understand how to use them at our will… But it’s only difficult and boring. Not that Professor McGonagall isn’t a good teacher, but I really prefer practice lessons rather the theory’s ones. I try to follow her and copy her schemes and rules, but I end up staring at my notes.
I snap back. – What the fuck? – is the first thing I say. Those brown eyes belong to a fascinating dark skin face with an annoying smirk and even more annoying dark messy hair. Yep, the kind of “fascinating messy”, of course.
I spend minutes only feeling it, and I feel lighter and lighter. It seems like I can breathe freely, like I can move more easily. Like I can do anything.
- For next time, I want an essay about the principles of not-harming magic and the wise use of transfiguration on living beings, - the professor says at the end of the lesson.
- Exactly! – I shout back. – You said that, - I continue lowering my voice. – Our parents are death eaters. This has nothing to do with us –
- You seems exceptionally quiet today, - Pansy turns at me. – You’re not even complaining how annoying I am! –
We end up laughing again. I feel so much better, now that the drama is out the way with all his idiotness with him. I absently wonder what would happen if Ginny wouldn’t arrive in time. Would Miles really throw me down the stairs?
- Thank you, - I say anyway. She’s trying after all, it’s not her fault if the magic world is stupid.
This time it’s me who hit her. Dodging me, she falls to Draco, who was staring something on the opposite side of the class. I turn: Harry, Hermione and Ron are talking and packing to go to next lesson. I share a very significant look with Pansy, who mutters: “Later”.
- It’s an illusion, - it’s my answer. – I’m actually Aurora’s ghost came from the death to have her revenge! –
First, it can’t be that I’m in the Harry Potter universe, the universe I wanted so bad to go as a kid that I legitimately cried for a year when my letter didn’t arrive (don’t judge! I know you did the same!) and Secondly, there’s no character named Aurora in the books! Who the hell did I become?! How the hell should I know about my life until this moment??
- You’re wronging everything, - Pansy says, sighing and putting down the potion’s paper she was writing. – We weren’t making fun of you, we were only trying to help you –
- And his voice! And his hair! And the way he wears the uniform! How can he be messy even with a stupid uniform? –
I spend History of Magic working on my project of spells on paper -and I decided to call them talismans! Come one, it’s the coolest name! – and ignoring the guilty feeling of future Aurora who will have to study for the GUFO.
Luna’s meeting made me feel so much better that I practically jump to my friends out of the class -where I should have been too, but it’s too late, so it would be useless to worry about it now-
- Draco has a crush on Harry -. Pansy drops the bomb, a smirk to her face while she looks at Hermione and Ron horrified faces.
- You’re the last person who can talk about sparing from suffering! – Pansy affirms. – Aurora, we have to go –
Potion wasn’t so bad. I was pretty good at chemistry in my world, and when we went to the laboratory, I always had so much fun understanding what I should add to the experiments to make them explode and made it seem an accident! I will understand how to it here too, but for now I simply follow the instructions Snape wrote while I try to understand what’s the logic behind the potions. It must be similar to chemistry: different components with different combination have different results. Some works, others not… Or not exactly how you wanted to. I must study all the components and their effect and find out the root of their functions, once I’ll understand this, I can start to invent some potions! And make explode others in the most “oops an accident” way!
Once she disappeared on the stairs, I turn to Ginny. – We need to buy her new shoes, - I affirm. – And make sure nobody bullies her again –
When all the students gets up to go to the lessons, Pansy starts to walk towards the golden trio with large steps and a warrior face.
Ok, now I’m starting to be tired. This drama is too ridiculous for me! I’m sorry fifth department, but please, write a better plot!
Next chapter, Slytherin's dormitory, the firts steps of Drarry and the first meeting between Aurora and Ginny!
I scroll my shoulders. I’m too tired to think about it. Tomorrow the lessons starts! I have to plan how to end the marriage, take care of some character development I always wanted to see and annoy some jerk!
I sigh and slowly lower my arms. I clear my throat, hoping it will help me to feel less embarrassed. It doesn’t.
I mostly bluffed, since I’m such a dangerous person. But in my world, I learned that a very good bluff can do a lot.
I don’t answer and focus on eating a couple of eggs. My character is… really like me! I always imagined doing those stuff at Hogwarts! What a shame I wasn’t here to do them in person… But, well, if everyone remember them, it’s a win anyway!
- And who is your type? – he questions me. – Draco Malfoy? Your childhood friend? You’re disgusting… -
- I will never understand you, - he affirms. – How did you write it down in ten minutes when the first time you tried, you spent two hours and ended up with nothing? –
I just decided to eat my piece of chocolate cake, when someone clears his throat. We turn: Professor McGonagall is looking at us with her severe expression, but she’s doesn’t seem to be angry. I’m probably wrong, but she seems… anxious?
Well, those are not really good excuses, but I didn’t even expected he would actually come to say sorry!
What? Oh, right, they’re still talking about the boyfriend I didn’t ask nor I want. Ok, this… System that floats in front of my eyes maybe can start to properly answer me!
She sighs, the sound like wind across a dead battlefield. “Mortals are so fragile.” She clicks her fingers and two wreaths materialise, one looking almost aflame with its orange and yellow leaves, the other heavy with tiny red berries.
?” Malfoy’s voice is softer than Harry had thought possible, brows furrowed slightly in concern as he ducks to meet Luna’s eyes.
Harry’s heart goes soft at the earnest expression on Neville’s face. “Thanks, mate,” he says, voice thick. He takes a moment to clear his throat. “I don’t… I don’t have the words yet, but I’ll tell you if I do.” He’s mostly lying, but the way Neville’s face clears at his words makes him unable to regret it one bit.
Not that it’s easy, even then. There’s a reason people mostly use wands to cast. The wands do half the work of channelling the magic to the right place and the effects of overloading a spell are minimised.
Harry makes a non-committal sound, something clicking in the back of his mind that he stubbornly refuses to acknowledge. “And he lives in… the dungeons?”
They lead the descent, Draco scanning the floor for Susan. He finds her waiting while Anthony Goldstein plays her cello for the last refrain. As the rest of the dancers follow, the music softens, dropping into silence when Draco and his partner’s feet touch the floor.
He kneels, bones creaking and limbs heavy. The lake water covers him like a shroud. He feels it stir his hair as it closes over his head with barely a ripple.
The Malfoy family had always had a knack for investing in businesses that would prove to be highly lucrative. They started as moneyed merchants, and over their five-hundred-year history, they’ve done what they do best. They bought shares. They networked. They funded just enough philanthropic projects to draw the
Come to think of it, He’s not sure if the second years are any better. He’d have to ask Astoria and Pansy to watch out for the signs too.
Harry wonders why he came back. The Malfoy he knew before the war was a coward, talking big but shaking all over whenever there was any real danger. This Malfoy seems like an entirely a different person, spine straight and shoulders lowered, gaze carefully bored as people throw him hateful glances with hands on their wands. Looking at him now, Harry can’t help but think that he was being
He still hasn’t technically finished his letters. But to be fair, he’s been putting off writing this particular one for a while now.
The bed that sits closer to the door is empty, sheets still done up. Probably Zabini’s. The back wall seems to be made entirely of glass, looking out into what seems to be the middle of the great lake.
There are less first years this year, and they huddle together in the middle of the Great Hall, moving as one to the front where Professor Sprout stands waiting.
The air in the room thickens as the formation blooms and curls. The whole room vibrates in time with the beating of his heart and he can taste the magic on his tongue. Moss and dirt, mushrooms and fallen leaves. Colour starts to leach into the ghosts in the room, their bodies solidifying under the hands of their living partners.
“How did- how did I get here?” he asks. He doesn’t mean for it to come out sounding so small, so frightened.
Pansy sits up and gasps, theatrically, with an expression that Draco does not care for at all. “More important things than what Potter’s wearing? Why, Draco! You didn’t tell us you’d finally reached puberty! Our late bloomer, grown up at last!” She caps it all off by dabbing at the corners of her eyes with her sleeves.
She shifts to sit cross-legged on an empty patch of mattress, leaving Harry standing awkwardly at the foot of the bed. From this angle Harry can see a tousled, blond head bury itself underneath a mound of pillows with a groan.
He looks down at his reflection in the light of the moon, sees its hollow eye sockets and how the skin of its face crack and bleed. It smiles.
He turns to Neville, who had spoken. The other boy’s eyes are narrowed, and he shakes his head slowly at him.
He flicks a salute at her and turns to walk onto the train, afraid that if he looks back, he’ll never leave. He rides that feeling of newness as he picks a seat and stows his luggage, helping a few starstruck younger students with their lightening charms along the way.
A flick, and something the size of a snitch comes flying out from somewhere behind Harry. Malfoy snatches it out of the air to inspect it.
“Oh,” Anton suddenly looks calculating and Draco feels a simultaneous burst of pride and apprehension. “I think I understand, Draco. I just have to think creatively.”
Malfoy’s lip twitches and despite how infuriating his pointy face is, the part of Harry holding back in caution settles. It’s still Malfoy, and Harry has been fighting and beating Malfoy since he was eleven years old. There are very few things he can say he is more familiar with than being at Malfoy’s wandpoint.
Greg aims the other one at the centre of Blaise’s back and it hits with a soft thud, rolling off to land on the floor. “Better eat that up before it gets cold.”
As one, all the dancers begin to hum in tune with the thrum of magic in the air. The harmony rises and picks up in volume, even as a few people, first and second years mostly, fall to their knees with the weight of it. Draco grits his teeth and widens his stance.
Please let me know what you think about the characterisation so far, esp the gryffs. The snakes are so easy for me but *clenches fist* the lions, man. What do jocks even say???
light dissipate as the woman in the centre rises into the air, trailing black smoke. Her creaky laugh drags a shiver down Draco’s spine.
Luna moves her grip over to his hand and tugs him insistently to the shore. He does his best to follow, but his legs feel like they’d fallen asleep. His head feels like it’s been swaddled in cotton wool.
The other boys roar with laughter, and the last of the tension dissipates with it. They take turns making fun of Harry as he kicks them lightly in retaliation.
To be fair, Harry recognises that he holds a lot of responsibility for how combative their relationship had been in the past. Last night, Harry hadn’t had his wand with him, nor tried to pick a fight. But was that all it took to have a near civil interaction with Malfoy? Harry not being immediately antagonistic towards him?
Another groan, sounding more like a scream muffled by the pillows. If he hadn’t almost died barely an hour ago Harry would probably sympathise.
Good thing both Susan and Draco have the most precise spellwork seen at Hogwarts in decades. Only Hermione Granger could beat them in this.
And it pays off. His playing is crisp and haunting, guiding the dancers, both corporeal and ghostly all in white robes, through the proper steps of the ancient ritual, unchanged but for the time and place. The melody of Pansy’s flute flutters high above their heads, a perfect accompaniment to his deeper, darker tones.
Harry nods, weakly at first, then more decisively. He wraps his free arm around his middle with a shiver. He’s suddenly so cold.
Harry chokes out a laugh that ended up sounding more like a sob into Hermione’s curls. Both of his friends tighten their arms around him. “It’s going to feel so strange being at Hogwarts without you two. I’ll be writing you every day. You’ll be sick of me.”
(also if there's someone who could teach me how to indent on ao3 that would be much appreciated because trying to format this was more painful than my entire honours thesis)
He follows the pull on his soul to the empty space between one breath and the next. Something in him knows what to do.
He gets it, he’s reckless. But to be fair, so are pretty much all of his friends and most of the role models in his life, so he doesn’t know what they really expect from him.
It takes a long time for either of them to decide to loosen their grips on each other. By the time that happens, they’re both trembling more from the cold than their intense emotions. Luna finally pulls out her wand and flicks a drying charm at him first and then herself. She does it all one handed, her left still clutching Harry’s.
Draco thinks it’s cute, how determinedly he is now holding that tiny pointed chin of his up with a straightened spine. Merlin knows where Anton learnt that, since all the time Draco has known Theo, he’d walked with a tired slouch.
“Sounds like the snake blood runs true, eh?” Sirius had said, with a faraway look in his eyes. “Black, through and through.” There had been something bitter, but wistful in his tone of voice. It had taken a moment to get the conversation back on track.
At that point Hermione begun casting glances at the Hogwarts Express as if she had half a mind to jump on it herself. Ron, seeing this, rather quickly intervenes. “’Mione the portkey’s leaving soon. We’d better say bye to Harry quick.”
Draco spends all of Halloween day practicing his violin playing in between classes. He’s out of practice, but he was in Azkaban for three months. He thinks being in prison is enough of an excuse to not get his hour of practice a day.
His mind abruptly draws a comparison to the Slytherin common rooms, Zabini in his armchair, the dark leather glossy in the firelight. He’d had his eyes on the entrances too.
“Thank you, Madame Fiore.” Luna curtsies daintily and reaches a hand into her pocket, drawing it out to tuck a small, white blossom into the corner of the painting. “A token from us, in thanks.”
It puts him on edge. He can’t trust Malfoy to help him without an agenda of his own, but he can’t guess what it is Malfoy wants either. The whole thing leaves him feeling unbalanced. He hates being on the defensive, having to react instead of taking the initiative.
Greg thinks for a moment, nodding slowly. “I get what you’re saying, Draco. That stuff is important,” he starts, face so guileless that Draco doesn’t see it coming until it’s too late. “But you and Potter not dicking is pretty big news.”
It takes Draco forever to get his schedule cleared up enough, and it’s not until well after dinner that he’s free for that meeting with Luna and Potter. He had sent off a quick message to Luna via Goldstein after the meal before getting started on his homework.
“Oh, Draco!” Luna’s voice rings into the space in between them all like a bell. The boys all whip their heads to face her, shaking their heads as if breaking free from a spell. “I’d hoped he’d come and say hello.”
, and immediately feels bad, because Luna is sitting right next to him, humming as she flicks through her magazine. Neville and Seamus are here too, catching up, along with Lavender and Parvati.
“Yes, Pansy. I’m so glad that our wait is finally over. He might’ve missed a few important developmental milestones but,” Blaise pauses, hiding his grin in Draco’s hair as he pulls him close by the shoulders. “Our boy may just have a chance of leading a normal life! I say we celebrate.”
See, Lucius Malfoy had not been idle in the years between his lord’s fall and return from the grave.
“Are you sure about this, Harry,” Hermione asks, fiddling with her collar. “You wouldn’t be intruding, I promise.”
Luna walks in without knocking, and for some reason, it’s that move that just about makes Harry ready to explode.
There was nothing simpler than a rag and a bucket of soapy water. Harry would clean the house, top to bottom, over and over, until his hands were raw. He had kept the windows shut so the dust would accumulate more quickly and give him more surfaces that needed cleaning.
Zabini shrugs, the movement more elegant than any Harry could – and would – ever manage in his life. “Someone has to.”
“Afternoon, gents.” Greg greets, ducking into the room quickly. He tosses a wrapped package to Draco, who lifts it to his nose for a sniff through the paper. Bacon and egg. Yum.
He even manages to have regular conversations with Ginny without feeling an aching sense of loss beneath his sternum. He didn’t think that they would ever get there, that things would keep being awkward after they broke it off. But they’ve sunk comfortably into a deep friendship that has her slumping against his shoulder after a long day and him stroking her hair in (often mocking) sympathy without being weird about it.
Harry woke up when his alarm ringed. Strangely, he felt more well-rested than ever. And he was hugging something very comfortable and warm. Wait.. what?
“Jeez, Draco. I’m only asking,” Harry says, surprised at Draco’s snappy behavior. The blonde in question keeps mumbling in French so Harry steps forward, looking at what Draco is hiding.
A group of five students were circling around a small figure who was held against the wall. Harry took a closer look and immediately recognized the blond hair that was without a doubt of Malfoy. His grey eyes were widened in fear as he eyed the taller students surrounding him.
Lucius retreated to his office to do some work. Narcissa moved upstairs to check on Draco. He must be in his room. Lucius had strictly told him to go study.
Narcissa rubbed his back but pulled back when he said that he felt like it was his fault. She faced him and quickly pressed a kiss to his forehead. “Oh dragon...”
I am sorry it took me so long to respond to your latest letter. I’ve been rather busy. But I am doing well, mother. My grades are good and I am still on top in Potions. Luna Lovegood took me nargle hunting the other day, though I still don’t know what they are.
He quickly took Malfoy to the infirmary. As soon as he arrived, Pomfrey appaered, gasping at the sight in front of her. She didn’t hestitate though, gesturing to Harry to lay down the boy in the closest hospital bed.
Narcissa had showed him the gift she got Draco. Fortunately Lucius hadn’t really cared about the dragon toy. He merely shrugged and moved on to rant about his business deals.
Blaise looked over at Draco, a strange expression on his face. ‘The problem is, is that the seeker is an absolute faggot,’ he said matter of factly.
“No idea. I didn’t really look at them. But it has happened more times. A lot of people attack him,” Harry said sadly.
At that moment Draco walked in. His little face changed from happy and excited to afraid real fast. The paper he held in his hand dropped to the floor. The whole manor grew quiet, even the birds made no sound.
Harry couldn’t believe that Malf.. Draco just called him ‘Harry’.. and handsome. Damn. What a strange day. But he liked it. Fuck, he liked Draco. Looking all cute on his bed. Merlin, he wanted to scoop the smaller Slytherin in his arms. When even had Harry grown taller than the blonde?
Harry looked concerned at his scared looking boyfriend. ‘Draco, clearly something is wrong, why don’t you tell me?’
The wedding took place in June. It rained but that didn’t matter. Inside a beautiful castle, surrounded by roses, she said yes. So did he.
He had just managed not to cry in front of the others. Atleast he succeeded in that. Sighing, he grabbed some parchment from his bag. He quickly started to write.
Malfoy looked up, tears streaming down his pale, bruised cheeks. He made an attempt to stand up but failed as he fell down, holding his ribs and crying out in pain.
The transfiguration book, already dangling at the side of the bed, flew off with a loud ‘baf’ when it hit the ground.
Harry smiled and yawned. He chuckled when that made Draco yawn too. ‘We should go to sleep, it is late.’ The blonde nodded and lay down with his boyfriend, curling up against him.
Malfoy tried to make similar attempts after that. He cleaned the boy dorms, put nice lights in the house colors around the common room and even offering to help people with their homework. Yet, nobody seemed to give a shit about Malfoy. Nobody acknowledges his presence or his efforts to make it up to people.
Gregory frowned. ‘You are actually defending this guy, aren’t you? Why are you defending him?’ he said in a low voice that made Draco almost choke on his pumpkin juice.
Harry reached over and tucked some of Draco’s hair behind his ears so he could see his pierced ear better. He noticed Draco blushing but decided not to comment on it.
His hands were all dirty with butter and chocolate by the time he finally got the brownies in the oven. It took him three hours and four tries to get him this far. It was already after curfew but Draco would be done soon.
He didn’t know where the sudden sympathy towards Malfoy came from. It might have been the fact that he was sitting right in front of him, looking all defeated and vulnerable. But he knew that this sympathy started earlier. He realised he had sympathy for Malfoy since sixth year.
Something was bothering Harry this evening, though he couldn’t find out what exactly. Until he remembered. The bloody fucking potion homework. He had to turn it in tomorrow morning or he would definitely get a bad mark and detention.
“Oh please,” Narcissa said as she sat down on a bench with Draco huddled against her. “As if you don’t know.”
Blaise raised an eyebrow. ‘Not bothering you? Wait till you get sexual harassed by a ponce.’ Draco flinched slightly.
Narcissa smiled at him. “Of course, little dragon,” she said as she helped him up again and helped him walk towards the bathroom. She helped him stay upright as he brushed his teeth.
Lucius was such a gentleman when Narcissa met him. She was a popular girl at Hogwarts. Everyone knew the Black sisters. Andromeda, the daring one, who should have been in Gryffindor. Bellatrix, the crazy one. Always said what she thought, never questioning if maybe she was being rude. Lastly, Narcissa. Narcissa was the pretty one.
‘No, not yet anyways,’ Harry smiles. ‘The guy I’m crushing on doesn’t seem to notice it though I’m standing right in front of him.’
The war is over. People died, people lived, but in the end Voldemort was finally defeated. The summer after the war students received a letter from Hogwarts telling them that 7th year students would be welcome to return for an eight year, to make up for their lost year. Most students gracefully accepted, Harry and Draco being one of them.
Harry smiled when he saw his boyfriend blushing. The adorable sight of that made Harry smile and take the blonde into his arms. Draco gratefully moved closer to Harry. Harry put his arms around his shoulders. He felt him Draco relax in his grip.
Narcissa knew that playing along would make Draco feel better. That was all she cared about. So she stood up, careful not to fall down as she still felt a little dizzy.
Alex and Narcissa shared goodbye’s and then Narcissa left the store feeling happy and excited. Her thoughts were filled with a blond little dragon and a curly haired man named Alex.
Harry woke by the sound of a loud thunder echoing through the room. Groaning, Harry pulled his head further into the pillow, just wanting to go to sleep again. Until he heard a soft wimper. Confused, not sure whether he heard it correctly he sat up. Another thunder bang sounded through the room. And another whimper followed.
Harry nodded. “It seems like a good possibily. I mean, this is quite a hufflepuff thing to do.” Several people hummed in agreement.
Someone was talking to her. Actually, screaming, crying and pleading to her. A broken voice, scared and lost.
Draco’s eyes widened. “No! Father I am really sorry! It is me, not the toy! I’ll make it up to you!”
“But you already did! I always feel way better when I am with you. Don’t you worry, dragon of mine!”
Draco smirked. “We will see, mommy. But we both know that Dobby is the best in hide and seek from us all!”
The curse kept going. It seemed to be never ending. Narcissa felt weak. Just hold on.., hold on, keep fighting, for Draco.
She opened her eyes and looked straight into the wide, silver eyes of her little dragon. And suddenly everything came back to her. She had passed out from the crucio.
“Draco, I love your make up very much but I’m afraid that father is gonna be very jealous if he sees that you are way prettier than him,” she said softly. Of course, she wasn’t going to tell him that Lucius would get extremely angry if he saw Draco wearing make up.
When Malfoy returned, Harry noticed he swayed a bit of his feet. He looked so damn exhausted. Seriously, when was the last time that the Slytherin got any sleep?
That gave her a glare from Lucius. “Of course not. It would simply be an embarrassment to take you two with me.”
Harry moved over to where Draco was sitting and pulled his arm around his shivering boyfriend. A bit startled, Draco looked up, tears still falling down his cheeks. His eyes were red-rimmed.
Narcissa hugged Draco close to her body. He was right in a way. Narcissa was always scared that one day Lucius would kill her. It would leave Draco alone in the hands of his father.
Even Hermione and Ron started to take a like in the Slytherin. Hermione would study with him as well, while Ron and Draco held chess competitions together. Draco seemed so much happier these days and it makes Harry very happy.
Harry debated on what to do. He couldn’t just leave the boy here, could he? He should go to a real bed. But in that case he would have to wake the grey eyed boy. And damn, he needed the sleep. Besides, Harry didn’t know if Malfoy would return to sleep after waking up.
Blaise added to it: ‘They should ban him of the team. Those poor teammates. I would feel hella uncomfortable in the locker room with him. What if he.. does something?’
Narcissa reached out and held Draco’s hand under the table. Draco squeezed it tightly and then looked up to meet everyone’s eyes.
“Then why are you failing to answer my questions correctly?” Lucius asked with a hint of anger creeping into his voice.
Draco never let go of the stuffed dragon. It was his hope. He took it to Hogwarts and managed to hide it from his fellow students. They never noticed. He was old enough now to know that the lion in mothers stories is Harry Potter. And Draco, childish as it may sound, hoped that one day Harry Potter would save him.
Harry hurried his way to History of Magic. He looked around for an empty seat and found one next to Draco. Ignoring some strange looks, he made his way over to Draco and sat down next to him. He grabbed some stuff from his bag and looked up to find Draco giving him a questioning look.
He made his way to the dorm and smiled when he saw the stuffed dragon, not hidden this time. Harry grabbed the stuffed lion he got and placed it next to the dragon. ‘Every dragon needs a lion, and every lion needs a dragon.’ He whispered before heading off to the common room to play chess with Ron.
“It is Malfoy, Harry. Have you forgo.. OW HERMIONE,” Ron yelled as Hermione kicks him from under the table.
‘I mean, not only when you are asleep, if you thought I meant that. You are cute awake too. I mean, handsome. Like, you know, not that I.. I mean, shit. You just have you know.. grey eyes?’
The cup fell on the table, not even broken. The contents however spread quickly. The table became wet and Lucius his meal too.
They weren’t alone. So many deatheaters were within their company today. Bellatrix, Greyback, Yaxley and way more. Oh, and of course the snake. Nagini slid under the table, sometimes climbing over someone’s lap to go onto the table.
They ate in silence for a while but then Harry spoke up again. “Guys, I got something from the anonymous student again!”
This went on for a while. The thunder continued for another half hour. Harry whispered comforting words at Draco who in return cuddled closer to Harry.
To say that Narcissa felt awkward was an understatement. After all, how can she describe to this man that her son never had a real toy before? He did have storybooks and quills he colored with. That is why Narcissa wanted to give him something else for a change. Something special. Also something that wouldn’t annoy Lucius.
Harry chuckled at the blonde. He was cute when he talked like that. ‘You know, a lion needs a dragon to stay alive. You are my dragon.’
Draco looks up at him with red-rimmed eyes. “I’m sorry! I’m so, so sorry. I didn’t want you to find out. I’ve ruined it all. I’m sorry, Harry! Can we please still be friends?” The blonde asks panicked.
He is rooted to the spot and can’t move. He is sobbing in public now but he can’t seem to care. His whole body is shaking and breathing is getting harder by the second.
Harry’s heart stang at the sight before him. His boyfriend was curled up in the bed, a transfiguration book laying long forgotten somewhere at the side of the bed. He seemed to be asleep. But what really made Harry smile was the dragon held against the chest of the blonde.
He was friends with her fellow classmate, Severus Snape. Severus was the outcast of the school, always teased, always bullied. It had been a great shock that Lucius would befriend him of all people. Narcissa thought it was sweet. Never judge a book by its cover, she knew.
They sit like that for a few minutes. That is until Harry’s hears something being murmered against his chest. ‘What did you say?’
‘Ex-deatheater,’ Harry says clearly. ‘You have changed. Besides, you have never been one, really. You were put in an impossible position but it was clear that you didn’t want it,’ Harry says softly.
Lucius stopped his abuse. Without a word, he got into bed and closed his eyes. “Get rid of him, Narcissa.”
Narcissa smiled. “That is my smart boy... Draco are you hurt darling? Anything I can help you with now?” She asked concerned.
‘F, f, fuck! Sorry, I-, I didn’t mean to.. How the fuck did I get here?’ Malfoy looked around, seeming a bit terrified.
Days passed and Harry found himself talking with Draco more often. They would study together, play chess and just talk about regular stuff. Harry loved the blonde’s smart and sometimes snarky comments. He was actually very funny and it was very easy to make him blush.
“Well, this times it were brownies. Very much burnt and quite hard. But they were eatable. Better than the chocolates. They also left me a note,” Harry passed the note so she and Ron could read it.
Narcissa was seated in the garden, a glass of wine in front of her. Lucius was at a deatheater meeting and Draco was playing in front of her.
After reading it Ron just shrugged. “I still have no idea who it could be mate,” he exclaimed. Harry nodded. “Me neither.”
‘It is though! Fuck, Potter. I’m just getting what I deserve. I’ve been a real asshole for years. I’ve done bad things. I used to be the bully. I deserve everything I get. Even if it means being so fucking alone all the times. I’m just paying for the things I’ve done. Accept it. Some people are beyond saving. They’ve sunk to deep already,’ Harry doesn’t fail to notice the slight waver in the blonde’s voice.
It was dark. Only the candle night held them company. The birds weren’t singing. They slept on this cold early January night.
‘So if I keep making you those cookies, I’ll keep being awarded with your kindness?’ Draco smirks back.
‘Well.. H-his sexuality isn’t bothering anyone right?’ Draco said, cursing himself for the slight voice crack.
‘I don’t know! You probably just cast a wandless speed-running spell,’ Draco crosses his arms stubbornly.
“Merlin, no! These were horrible. Damn, I didn’t know you could fail so hard at making chocolate,” Harry laughed.
Harry can’t stand to watch anymore. The whole Great Hall had gone quiet, no one making a move or sound. The only sound being heard was the crying boy at the Slytherin table.
Narcissa sighed in frustration as she read Alex’s reply. She did not mean to put her last name on that letter. Although his reply was kind, surely he would think she was a bad woman for marrying a pureblood supremacist.
Not daring to wake Draco up, Narcissa carried him to his bed. She undid his clothes and then put on some fresh pajamas. Draco remained asleep, exhausted from the studies he did. With a soft smile Narcissa tucked him in. Draco mumbled a bit in his sleep as his little hands grabbed the blanket tightly. Narcissa pressed a kiss to his forehead.
Harry’s heart breaks. He noticed the little pranks other people pulled on him. It was innocent at first, spelling his robes bright pink or putting a bit of salt in his drinks. They increased though, more harsher. Soon, there was itching powder in his blankets and his bag got ruined beyond prepair. People cast tripping jinxes at him in the halls and cast silencing charms on him whenever he has to speak in class.
Once Draco was finally in the bath, Narcissa sighed softly as she looked at the mess Draco left behind with the make-up. With a quick swish of her wand, it was cleaned.
“Hello,” Harry greeted. “I hope you didn’t have to wait for too long. Hermione held me up quite a bit.” That was true. Hermione had made sure Harry’s hair looked perfect.
Dobby’s hands were shaking when he walked in. He carried multiple plates filled with seafood. He sat them down on the table, waiting for the other house elves to do the same. A few other house elves filled the glasses with wine, champagne and other alcoholic drinks. Even Draco was handed a glass of wine, despite being just ten.
“Don’t pretend like you weren’t listening. I’m getting rid of that stupid toy Draco owns. It was a bad idea, Cissy.”
He grabbed a brownie and carefully took a bite. They looked a little on the burnt side, but not dangerously so. They tasted a bit burnt too but Harry didn’t really mind. They were sweet and he kinda liked them. Ofcourse he tasted better brownies in his life but he really appreciated the effort of this person. And the brownies weren’t too bad.
“Ehh..,” Draco didn’t know what to say. “How much I hate muggles?” He desperately hoped to please his father who was watching him carefully.
Candles hang off the wall and the floors were so shiny that you could almost see your reflection through it.
The door opened and Draco walked in. He was dressed in a little suit and Narcissa thought it was just adorable. He walked over to them and gave Narcissa a small smile.
Malfoy, who still looked a bit flustered, moved over to Harry and sat down next to Harry. Harry felt a bit awkward first about sitting so close to Malfoy. But he relaxed soon as Malfoy grabbed the assigment and scanned it over.
There is mention of child abuse in this chapter. You don’t have to read the prologue to understand the one-shot. Feel free to skip if it makes you uncomfortable!!!
It all seemed to go fast. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Malfoys friends seemed to start insulting the young blonde. Harry raised an eyebrow as he saw how Malfoy’s eyes began to water, eventually tears spilling down his cheeks.
Draco looked up with a debating look. “I don’t know mommy. But maybe we can marry!” He says enthousiastic.
It was then that Harry realised that Draco wasn’t lying in his arms anymore. Draco was sitting against the headboard of the bed with his knees pulled to his chest, arms hugging his knees and his head buried in them. Harry heard a little sob coming from his vulnerable looking boyfriend. And then another, and another. A bang was heard again and he heard the whimper again. His whole body shook and trembled. Harry couldn’t stand to watch the blonde looking so upset.
“Because there is a very pretty boy I play with sometime! If I want to marry someone, it would be Blaise! I don’t want to marry with Pansy or Daphne. I like them but I wouldn’t give them a kiss,” Draco said happily as he jumped of her lap, chasing butterflies again.
“None of this is your fault. Your father is a cruel man. It is his fault for simply being an asshole. Look, dragon, Lucius was bad even before you were born. We are simply survivors of him. But none of this is because you,” Narcissa said softly.
“Sure thing, dragon,” she smiled. She doubt that Draco could actually read all the words. He was already able to read. After all, Lucius made him learn that at a young age. But still, big words he may find hard.
It is then that Harry notice the pale freckles on the boy’s face. Once he notices them, he spots them everywhere. They are on the bridge of his nose, on his cheeks and a few on his forehead and chin as well.
There are no clues on why the blonde has left the dorm so Harry grabs his maurauder map. He whispers the spell and the map of Hogwarts appaers. He immediately starts looking for signs of Draco. He spots two Ravenclaws on the astronomy towers and a group of Hufflepuffs sneaking around the fifth floor. Looking further, he finally finds Draco’s dot. In the kitchens..
Narcissa spend nights crying silently next to her sleeping husband. She rubbed her belly, hoping that the boy didn’t feel her stress.
“I think I’m fine mom. Except that my legs still really hurt. I don’t think I can stand up,” he said feeling ashamed.
Draco smiled. “Thank you, mother,” he said his goodbyes and gave his mother a last hug. He then made his way to the library.
Draco had make up everywhere. The eyeshadow was used all around his eyes. The lipstick was almost everywhere but his lips. The blush was overused, giving him a clown alike look. He was currently opening a bottle of mascara.
She looked away respectfully when Draco relieved himself and she helped him move to wash his hands. They then walked back to his bedroom and Narcissa tucked him in. It was then that she noticed the tears.
Harry did as he was told and lowered Malfoy on the bed. Malfoy slowly closed his eyes in exhaustion.
Lucius kept on glaring. “It is that toy of you, isn’t it? It keeps on distracting you from what is important.”
Harry shots awake from his sleep. Sighing, he looks at his clock. 1am, it says. It is way too early in the morning, but Harry doesn’t feel like sleeping anytime soon. He goes to grab his book when he noticed that one bed still has its curtains open. Everyone else in the dorm is already asleep.
“I love it! It is a dragon! Like me! That is awesome. Thank you so much!” If it wasn’t for Lucius sitting there, Draco wouldn’t have to contain his obvious excitement.
Narcissa had smiled at the boy with the long blond hair. She knew him. Of course she did. Who didn’t know the son of the Malfoy’s? The Malfoy’s were one of the wealthiest pureblood families, along with the Black’s.
The silence got Draco thinking. He had such a lovely time with his mother. He wished moments like this would never end.
But she also had Lucius to deal with. Fuck Lucius and his stupid rules and fuck Lucius with his treatment of others. Fuck Lucius, fuck Lucius, fuck Lucius!
He hit her when she told him to not get involved. She didn’t say anything after, afraid he would hurt the baby inside her.
“Gentlemen, you are being very loud. Other customers are bothered by this. I ask you to please leave.”
“Lucius, dear what are you doing?” She asked rather sweetly to try to make him feel good so he won’t throw the toy away.
Draco felt sick too. He felt faint to his head as he realized that this might be his future. Becoming a monster like all of them. He didn’t know what to say but fortunately for him, Greyback already spoke up.
Harry only laughs. “Getting a midnight snack. Real question is, what are you doing here? Wouldn’t think the kitchens is a place where you come.”
If you enjoyed this, you might want to check out my other one-shots as well! They have some similiar themes.
After the war, Malfoy grew very quiet. He was barely noticeable. Though he had apologized to everyone, many still hated him. Harry had even spotted some people yelling at him or even punching and kicking him. Knowing that it is wrong, he had succesfully stopped the bullies sometimes. But Malfoy still came back to the dorms with bruises, cuts and limps countless of times.
There is a photograph of Narcissa and Draco on his nightstand. His desk contained a photograph of Blaise, Pansy and Draco.
“Oh that is amazing! I’m so glad!” Hermione said, feeling excited for her friend. She always knew that these two would make great friends, if not more. The sexual tension between those two were so strong always.
Harry debated the question in his head. Had Malfoy actually offered to help him with his homework? That was bloody weird. But he really needed some help. And Malfoy was way nicer this year. Speaking of Malfoy, he was turning more red by the second. Embarassed at himself for asking the question and more afraid of Harry’s answer. Harry decided to help Malfoy out of his embarrassment.
The rest of the boys laughed as well, making jokes about the horrible chocolate and the anonymous maker of it. Malfoy looked rather sad though, Harry noticed. Malfoy grabbed his stuff silently and left the dorm looking down to the floor the whole time. Harry just shrugged it off and joined the others in their jokes.
Draco spoke up again. ‘I’m scared of the thunder.’ Draco’s cheeks flushed even redder than they had already been and curled in on himself even more.
‘Hot chicken sauce,’ Harry whispered and his room opened. Damn Ron, for helping him choose that password when they were both drunk. He carried the still asleep blonde towards his king-sized bed. He gently lowered Malfoy on the mattress and pulled the blankets over him. Malfoy sighed again, he curled in on himself, smiling contently in his sleep. Again, Harry found himself thinking that Malfoy looked absolutely adorable.
Only one chapter left guys! Next chapter is their Hogsmeade date :D Hope you enjoyed this one :) Please comment your opinion :))
Hermione had a look of sympathy on her face. “Poor Malfoy. I can’t believe people are still bullying. I thought we left that nonsense behind in the war. Is he doing okay?”
Pansy grabs the Daily Prophet and scans the article over. Her eyes widened and a smug smirk took over her face. ‘No actually way,’ she grinned.
Narcissa had tears streaming over her cheeks. Oh, how bad she wanted to help Draco. Make Lucius stop, please make him stop.
‘Guys! Look at this!’ Draco gets interrupted from his thoughts as Theo waves the Daily Prophet in front of their noses.
Draco always loved his mother’s bedtime stories when he was younger. They were hopeful and promising. Everytime his father took his anger out on him, his mother would be there for him. He knows she tried to stop the abuse. Father wouldn’t listen, he would only get angry at mother too. Draco wasn’t angry at mother. He knows she tried everything and she would always try everything to help him after he got hit.
Poppy had tears in her own eyes. She knew that this baby was gonna have a great mother. It was the father she was worried about.
Narcissa smiled and let him play with the dragon. She then stood up to get some parchment and a quill. She then went to write Alex.
Before Draco could say anything, Harry pulled Draco against him again and kissed him. He felt Draco completely relax in the kiss and Harry relaxed too. Everything just felt so right.
‘Shhh dragon. It is okay, the thunder can’t reach us here. You are safe here. Don’t worry.’ Harry pressed a kiss on Draco’s head in an attempt to calm his shaking boyfriend.
“Oh, I killed one once I think. Or I left them injured in some alleyway. I don’t remember,” she giggled madly.
Malfoy had changed after the war, Harry had noticed. He wasn’t the loud, spoiled git he had known for years anymore. He was more quiet now. After the war Draco had apologized to Harry and his friends. It sounded very sincere to them and Harry, being tired of fighting, had accepted his apology.
Harry glanced at the clock. It read 11:49. Harry groans. Why the fuck hadn’t he think of his stupid homework earlier? Oh yeah, he was too busy playing chess and other games with Ron and Neville. Harry sighed and grabbed his stuff. He decided he would make it in the eight year common room. Maybe sitting in front of the fireplace would give him some motivation to actually make the assigment.
Draco looked at her with wide eyes. It looked simply hilarious with the colorful eyeshadow all on him. He must have used all the colors of the rainbow.
“Well, when you go to Hogwarts, you are going to start having balls. Like the yule ball for example. You might take a special someone there and then you might need to be able to dance!” Narcissa chuckled.
“I never thought I’d hear the all mighty Slytherin prince say this,” Harry smiled amused, putting his arms around the blonde.
The sky was grey with dark angry clouds. The thunder made a loud noise, shaking the birds awake. On this loud evening Narcissa sat at the long table in Malfoy’s Manor dining room.
She changed into her nightgown and got into bed. A cup of tea would be wonderful right now. Not a moment later, a house elf appeared with a steaming cup of tea. She thanked the elf politely and took the cup.
“That would be such a shame of my nails,” Narcissa said playfully. “I just painted them red this morning.”
Harry sighed softly. ‘I figured, dragon. It is okay to be scared sometimes, you know?’ Harry smiled softly.
When Harry woke up the next day he found a black box on his nightstand. It was a same one from the chocolate last week so he figured this was the same person again. He looked around. All the boys from his dorms had already left. Except for one, Malfoy’s curtains were still closed. ‘Still sleeping’ Harry thought.
‘So, he has the softest blonde hair I’ve ever seen. Pale smooth skin and silver eyes. I love the little freckles dancing on his nose. Oh and he smells like vanille, green apple and cologne. He wears a lot of green as well,’ Harry watches Draco thinking.
He pulled the red ribbon of the box and found some brownies in it. On top of the brownies lay a note. Curiously, Harry opened it.
‘Nice to meet you, Draco. Why don’t you come over and sit with me and my friends and have breakfast together? We are very friendly and don’t judge people over their sexualities,’ Harry says, standing up, helping Draco up as well.
She looked at Draco and saw he was fighting a smile of his own. He carefully ate his pasta, not wanting to attract the attention of his father.
“I heard that toys stimulate a child’s brain though. I agree with you, Lucius, but this toy may help him get his grades up. We could try it,” Narcissa suggested.
“Don’t deny it, mother. I’m not stupid. Father says it himself! If I wasn’t such a bother then he wouldn’t resent us,” Draco said sadly. “Everything would be better if I wasn’t such a disappoi...”
Narcissa watched while feeling sick to her stomach as they all mentioned how Draco would perform as a deatheater. He is way too innocent. He would never willingly commit those horrible crimes.
‘I don’t. I stopped ‘hating’ you in sixth year. How can I still hate you after seeing these things you were forced to do, though you didn’t want to? You were falling apart in daylight, and you still are. Pity, because you seem like a nice guy. I like those cookies you made.’
Harry decides to make things up. He stands up, giving himself no time to change his mind and starts walking over to the Slytherin in question.
Except, Harry found himself having a problem now. Where would he sleep tonight? Could he just... join Malfoy in bed? It was a king-sized bed but still.. wouldn’t it be a bit weird? Harry yawned and looked at the clock. 01:56. Harry yawned. Fuck it, he thought. He changed into his pyjamas and joined Malfoy in bed, laying on the opposite side of him.
Thank you for being kind and accepting. Thanks to you, I actually feel a bit more welcomed in this school.
Hermione watches as Harry comes sit with her and Ron during breakfast. She put some pancakes on her plate and watched Harry’s excited face with a curious look.
With that, she went to her room. Apparently, Lucius left the house again like he almost always does after an attack.
“Draco, as you may know you turned eight. This means that you will have more responsibilities and..,” Lucius went on a long rant about responsibilities and growing up as a Malfoy. Eventually he stopped and let out a long sigh. “As you can see, your mother got you a present. I expect you to be responsible with it. No fooling around or behaving like a little child,” Lucius said strictly.
Don’t worry. I am glad you are doing well. I am proud of you, my dragon. Give Luna my love. I have looked for books about nargles in the library but unfortunately I was unsuccesfull.
Lucius and Narcissa arrived home in the evening. They had eaten out at a fancy restaurant pure for show. Not because Lucius cared about dates with Narcissa. He just wanted to show off his money and wealth by eating at one of the most luxe restaurants in wizarding Britain.
The drawing was made from a photo. Last summer, Narcissa took Draco to a park. He fed the ducks, played on the swings and eat sandwiches with Narcissa. It was a lovely memory. At the end of the day, someone offered to make a photo of them. Narcissa held Draco’s tiny hand as they both smiled brightly in the camera. Narcissa took the photo home, keeping it safe in a photo album.
Narcissa looked in the mirror and chuckled. The lipstick was now smooched across her cheek. “Oh you dragon...”
Draco kept looking down, not wanting to be here at all. All he wanted was to go upstairs and draw some cool stuff in his sketchbook. He didn’t ask to sit her and watch scary men talk about scary stuff.
She carried the unconscious Draco in her arms, to his bedroom. She tucked him in bed and pulled the blanket till his chin. She then walked over to the bathroom and grabbed a potion against stomach aches. When she returned, Draco was awake.
Lucius never made her orgasm. She always pretended. He was always done way too soon. But this time was different.
He looked tired, Harry thought. His eyes were slightly blood-shot and he looked even paler than normal. Definitely not healthy. Harry knew that Malfoy worked hard these days. Even harder than before. Anything to pass his NEWTS. Good grades would be Malfoy’s only chance of having a job later. Harry felt bad for the Slytherin. He seemed to over-work himself a lot. He wondered how much the blond actually slept this week.
Narcissa didn’t care about the family status. She was in love with this man and that was all that mattered for her.
Draco started reading but soon he started stuttering over the words. He frowned to himself disappointed. He was trying so hard but the word just wouldn’t come out.
This goes on for a while but eventually they finish and get a beautiful, well-baked cake as result. It tastes delicious and Draco looks at Harry proudly. Harry smiles and puts Draco in a hug. Eventually they grow tired and head back to the common room, both falling in a peaceful sleep.
‘I’m completely alone, Potter. I don’t think I can. Especially after what just happened,’ Malfoy says sadly.
Lucius grabbed his cane and hit Draco over and over again. Draco screamed and cried. “Mommy!!!” He cried out. Lucius knelt down and hit Draco at the head. Within a second, the child passed out.
Draco pushed himself into a sitting position. “I was awake already. I just thought it would be best to pretend to be unconscious till everyone left,” he said softly.
‘Let me show you how serious I am,’ Harry tucks Draco forward, pressing his lips on Draco’s. Draco responds immediately, moaning in pleasure. Harry thinks he might die on the spot.
Too shocked to react, Harry let it happen. It didn’t last long though because Draco pulled back, looking panicked.
“It is going to be Draco’s birthday tomorrow,” Narcissa said to her husband Lucius. They were walking down the streets in Diagon Alley. Draco was left home. The house elves were ordered to take care of him.
They couldn’t have been that bad, could they? He hadn’t tried them himself, he wasn’t hungry. But he had tried so hard. And the result looked pretty decent.
Narcissa thinks and then she swayed Draco around. “There are probably dance clubs at Hogwarts but..”
“Ah well, they weren’t too bad so whatever!” Harry chuckled as he watched Malfoy play a bit with his rings.
Draco looked down ashamed. “Could you help me to the bathroom first?” He asked softly. He felt ashamed for not being able to go to the bathroom himself.
It was already dark outside, as it was night time. The stars were shining above them, the moon and street laterns providing the only lights. Both smiling at the romantic vibe, they held hands and stood in the streets, staring above them.
Eight year students were forced to share a common room together now. ‘To end this ridicilous house rivarly, once and for all.’ Mcgonagall had said. At first it seemed strange. But it only took the students a few weeks to become familiar with eachother. Gryffindors were seen playing chess with Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws and Slytherins discussed the latest news with eachother. The only one who seemed a bit lonely, Harry noticed, was Malfoy. He usually sat by himself, in the armchair by the window, reading a book or just staring out of the window. Sometimes he would talk to Blaise Zabini or Theodore Nott, some of the returned Slytherins. But he was usually by himself.
Groaning quietly, Harry rubbed his eyes. “Hm, what Ron?,” Harry asked while sitting up. It was then he noticed the little black box on his nightstand.
He looked so peaceful in his sleep. All curled in on himself, breathing softly. Harry moved some blond hair from Malfoy’s eyes.
‘It is- stupid. You will l-laugh at me. Forget abou..’ Another bang cut off his sentence and Draco let out a sob.
”NONSENSE!” Lucius screamed. Narcissa felt Draco’s tiny hand squeezes hers. “Malfoy’s don’t show weaknesses and they especially don’t take medicine for it!”
Draco takes in their height difference. ‘What the fuck happened to you, giant?’ Though he sounds a bit impressed.
She looked at a seat that was empty. Andromeda should have sat there. But she married a muggle so her family disowned her. Her heart ached.
She cried and cried but the alcohol was starting to do its job. She lay on the couch and stared at the ceiling with an empty feeling. She could feel as the alcohol started to go into her head.
Narcissa laid her hands on his shoulders and helped him sway along to the music. “Every color, definitely.”
Narcissa couldn’t help but chuckle at her son. He was acting the exact same way as Narcissa would do towards him. It made her smile. Tea and a story always comforted Draco so he automatically thought that it would comfort her as well.
“Stop there, you will only injure yourself more. Let me help taking you to madame Pomfrey,” Harry said, as he watched the blonde with sympathy.
The ballroom was almost abandoned now. Sometimes Narcissa would go here to listen to music while looking at the ceiling with angel drawings.
Narcissa screamed in pain with the last push. The sheets below her were soaked in blood. But then she saw him. A tiny little baby.
Lucius grabbed the cane and walked over to Draco. Narcissa was pushed aside. She knew what it meant. Interfering would only make it worser for Draco and for herself. She willed herself not to cry. She couldn’t. She had to stay strong for Draco.
“You can always come to me, you know. And with some names I will be able to report the people doing this to you.”
Harry smiled. “You are right. I wish everyone had the same view as you. And Malfoy really changed after the war.”
Harry thought. “No idea. The other boys think it is a hufflepuff girl. Do you have an idea, Malfoy?”
Time seemed to stop around them as the once enemies, now lovers, shared this passionate moment. They pulled apart, smiled at eachother, and then kissed eachother again.
Harry watched as Malfoy snatched the Prophet and started to read. He only frowned and looked at his friends confused. Harry saw how Malfoy and his friends were in deep discussion, Malfoy looking strangely uncomfortable.
Draco’s birthday passed smoothly. Lucius had retreated in his office. Draco had played with the dragon all day and Narcissa had played along with him. They played fantasy games where they were dragon hunters or dragons themselves. They both had a great time. Draco fell asleep with a smile on his face that day and Narcissa went to bed feeling like a good mom for once.
Before the horrible chocolates, he had never baked before. Thereby, he was a disaster in the kitchen. Soon, flower was everywhere, milk spilled on the ground and egg shells were laying in the wrong bowl. Groaning slightly, he cleaned the mess up with his wand. The muggle way of baking was just so hard.
Harry first thought it was rather weird to have Malfoy in his arms, but at this point he couldn’t care less. The Slytherin was in pain and Harry wanted to take him to the infirmary as soon as possible.
‘Oh you were just sitting alone, and I was alone too so I thought maybe we could keep eachother some company,’ Harry smiles.
He caught some of the words that were being said, quite loudly, so people from other houses started to look at the scene too. Hermione and Ron were also watching, Harry noticed.
Harry didn’t understand what that was supposed to mean. He changed the subject to something else and finished dinner with Hermione. After that, he went back to his dorms.
Pomfrey moved Harry out of the way. He watched as she performed several spells on the blonde. He cried out in pain a few times after which Pomfrey forced him to drink a pain relief potion. It all took just a few minutes before Pomfrew was done.
The deatheaters raised there glasses and took a sip of their drinks. Narcissa quickly cast a silent spell, causing Draco’s drink to empty itself. She then filled it up again with an aguamenti spell. There was no way she would let Draco drink at this age.
Narcissa climbed into Draco’s bed as silently as possible. Draco unconsciously moved closer to her. She smiled softly and threw her arm around Draco protectively. He sighed in his sleep.
Draco whimpered again. “It hurts, father. I-I am s-s-sorry,” Draco stuttered as he clutched his stomach.
Draco didn’t smile. He looked very distressed. ‘It is silly. I shouldn’t be scared. It is stupid. Only losers get scared of thunder and..’ He couldn’t continue his ramble as Harry interrupted him.
Draco didn’t notice his mother tearing up slightly. She wished that it was easy like that. He was so innocent and childlike.
When Draco was five years old his mother Narcissa gave him a stuffed dragon. It was his first toy ever. His father Lucius strongly disapproved of anything childish. His son is a Malfoy and Malfoy’s are not childish. So his mother had told him to hide the stuffed dragon whenever Lucius was around. It wasn’t that hard, Draco found out. His mother came to his room every night to tell him a goodnight story and a goodnight kiss. His father never did. And it was always mother or Dobby who would wake him in the morning. So it wasn’t hard to sleep with the dragon at night. During day time he would hide the dragon under his bed sheets. His father never noticed.
Harry pushed Draco down on the bed to make-out more intensely. After their snogging session, that lasted centuries, they broke apart. Both breathing heavily.
Narcissa’s cheeks burned in anger. She didn’t say anything though. She never did. She sighed. She had tried to leave Lucius before. Unfortunately, the threat of the Dark Lord was too big. Lucius and his fellow deatheaters would hunt them down and kill them without mercy. Narcissa and Draco were trapped.
Draco trembled as his eyes moved towards every deatheater in the room. He was scared and about to be humiliated in this room full of powerful people.
Malfoy started to shake again. ‘No, no, no! You don’t get it. They are the only ones I have for real. With mother d-dead and my other friends in Azkaban or dead as well.. That is why I didn’t want them to know! I didn’t want to risk losing them!’ Malfoy’s breath started to pick up.
Narcissa could have screamed in joy but for her own sake she stayed silent. Instead she nodded curtly.
Malfoy chuckled, still blushing. ‘I know what eye color I have. But thank you.. Harry. You look handsome too.’ Malfoy’s eyes widened a bit again.
It was a regular April night. Harry had spent the night with Ron, flying on the quidditch fields. He had asked Draco too, but he stayed in, needing to finish his transfiguration essay. Harry and Ron stayed outside very late, talking about regular stuff. Eventually they grew tired and decided to head inside. Harry wished his mate a goodnight before heading off to the room he and Draco shared.
‘For being a horrible, annoying, stupid, Gryffi..,’ Draco falls face first in the water as Harry trips him from behind.
Once in the kitchens, Draco took out the recipe. After the little incident with Harry he felt more determined to make these brownies perfect. He grabbed the needed ingedrients and put them on the counter.
Draco took her hands and nodded. “I suppose you are right, mom. Which housecolor would be the prettiest on me?”
Draco was sitting on her right. His bangs were too long, Narcissa noticed. His eyes were covered by the soft blond locks. Perhaps that is what he wanted.
Lucius stopped the curse and stalked towards Draco. He then raised his cane and brought it down on Draco multiple times. Draco curled up even tighter as he bit his lips trying to keep himself from screaming.
‘Well, that is nice to know. Say, I really enjoyed spending time with you. We should do that more often!’ Harry smiles.
Harry starts helping Draco with his cake, which is a lot harder than the thought. Draco is quite stubborn and doesn’t agree with everything Harry does. Harry enjoys it though, he thinks it is quite adorable.
The truth is that Narcissa would love to go out for a tea with Alexander. But he is right, she can’t. She is married and Lucius would kill her if he knew about her going out with other men.
Draco’s face fell at the mention of Lucius but soon he was smiling again. “Can I use the floral soap? The one that smells like the garden? Please, mommy? Father says I have to use this one that doesn’t even smell special.”
He made his way over to the couch. They still had to do two questions for the assignment but Harry couldn’t bring himself to wake the Slytherin. He would just do them tomorrow morning. He glanced over at the blonde. He looked so, adorable? Damn. Harry knew Malfoy needed the rest. Except, the couch wasn’t all that comfortable. And it was getting cold in here.
Harry smiled a bit at the sight. Malfoy is easy to carry, he is very light, Harry noticed. He made his way over to the bedrooms. Once there, he found himself fucked. He didn’t know the password to get into Draco Malfoy’s room. Only one option left him. Harry pulled the Slytherin a bit closer, not wanting him to fall out of his arms, and made his way over to his own room.
Then suddenly, Harry grabbed Draco’s waist and pulled him forwards. Harry leaned down and gently started kissing him. Draco responded in the kiss. The blonde wrapped his arms around the brunette’s neck and kissed him back.
Narcissa jumped forward. “No! Lucius stop! He is too young!” She screamed in horror. His little body can’t take this. Not wasting a second, she stepped between Lucius and Draco.
Narcissa quickly took Draco upstairs and pulled him on her lap. She then took his little tear streaken head in her hands and made him look at her. “I’m going to get you a new toy, dragon. In secret. Father won’t know about it. We just got to hide it carefully, okay? Can you do that?” She asked him softly.
He watched as Parkinson pointed an accusing finger at Malfoy, but he couldn’t hear what she said. Malfoy paled and looked like he wanted to rush off. He watched as Nott pulled Malfoy rather harshly back at the table.
She was in the darkness but the voices seemed to pull her out. She felt power returning to her body. Slowly, the world came back to her.
After the war Malfoy had apologized to everyone. Harry and his friends included. Malfoy had even formed a friendship with Luna. Harry had accepted his apology. He understood why Malfoy did what he did. He was just forced into his role as deatheater. He couldn’t do anything against it, otherwise his mom would be killed. Harry understood. He would do anything for his loved-ones too.
They both lay down on the bed, waiting for their breath to relax. And then fell asleep again, in eachothers arm.
They would though. Lucius would come back and either he or his mom would end up hurt. But why? Why does Lucius hate his mom so much while she was so awesome?
Lucius turned around and faced her fully. “Why would that be necessary? It is a waste of money. Draco should focus all his time on useful stuff like his studies. Toys are for little stupid muggle childen,” Lucius scoffed,
Lucius walked closer. “We never had problems with this before. I know it is the toy. We are getting rid of it,” he said determined.
Narcissa fought a glare of her own. She was very relieved though. Spending a week without her husband sounded like a week of the Maldives to her.
Harry recognizes the unoccupied bed as that of Draco. Where the hell could he be? It is long after curfew and Harry swore he had seen Draco getting into bed just a few hours ago. Maybe he had a nightmare and went out to get some fresh air?
“Yeah, of course! And I am happy, darling. Because of you. You are the sunshine in my life. You are my little dragon,” Narcissa chuckled while hugging him.
Harry left the hospital wing with a strange feeling. He knew it had something to do with Mal-Draco but he couldn’t really figure out what exactly. Draco calling him ‘Harry’ had Harry feeling all weird for some reason.
He moved over to the tear-streaken boy and smiled softly. “I am gonna carry you, if that is alright with you.”
Lucius just made an uninterested noise and stood up. “I’ll be in my office working.” With that he walked away.
They both knew that there would be no way with Lucius not finding out. They chose to ignore it as it would ruin their small moment of happiness.
Harry laughs and pulls the Slytherin in a hug. “Don’t be silly, idiot. I can’t believe you are the Anonymous Student! But you must know I am very happy to know that,” Harry smiles.
Malfoy manor had a huge beautiful ballroom. There were multiple chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The walls were decorated with gold and black. On the walls were several mirrors as well.
Narcissa fell in love with the garden. It stretched so far. She could just imagine planting flowers here on sunny afternoons. Breakfast on sunday morning at the wooden bench. A wine between the roses.
Harry tries to keep a chuckle in when Draco starts cursing in French but totally fails. Draco startles and turns around, spotting Harry. He drops a wooden spoon and curses some more in French before regaining posture again.
‘Aren’t you bloody hot? Because I am. I think it is insane that it can be this hot around this time of the year. Though, Mcgonagall did apparate us to Greece so maybe that is it. I think..,’
Today I don’t have food for you. I have been trying, ofcourse. But I just can’t seem to find a recipe that I can actually do. So maybe soon. This time you will just have to do with a note.
Lucius looked at his cowering son with a look of disapproval and then stalked over to the paper. He grabbed it, looked at it and then threw it on the table.
Narcissa sat in the dining room along with Lucius who just got home. He was supposed to be away all day but apparently he came back way earlier than expected.
Draco fell down, screaming in obvious pain. He was writhing, shaking and crying out in agony. Tears streamed down his little cheeks as pain consumed every nerve of his.
She smirked at him. “I bet you will love to work with us,” Bellatrix said as she turned to the other deatheaters. “What do you think he will do within our ranks?”
‘I’m glad, and yeah, same thing for me. Something about having a warm human pillow in my arms is very calming,’ Harry said confident.
Narcissa climbed out of bed and held his tiny hands. “Mommy has a potion for that, don’t worry darling. I’ll go and fetch it fo...”
Harry knew it from the moment he and Draco started to share a room together at Hogwarts, eight year. He would find it in the middle of the night when he woke up to get a glass of milk. It would either lay in the arms of the blonde, clutched to his chest, or somewhere random on the bed.
Unfortunately my son had a little accident with his toy. He is really sad about it. I was wondering if I can order him a new one? I’ll pay you double if you package it in a box meant for beauty products. It is a strange request but it is for good purposes.
Draco smiled the cutest smile Harry ever saw. ‘You feel safe, Harry. Sweet Merlin, I never thought I would say that. But you are very comforting.’
Lucius looked to be deciding whether to attack Draco or not. He made a few steps towards the table but the laughter of the other death eaters threw him off.
“Fine,” Lucius spoke dangerously calm. He stepped back, never keeping his eyes off the trembling forms of his wife and son. “Let’s have it your way then. Crucio.”
‘No, aboslutely not. Now come here, little dragon. I’ll protect you from the angry clouds.’ Harry said softly. He watched with a smile as Draco immediately scooted over in Harry’s arms. Harry held him close as Draco lay his head in his chest.
I really like you, Harry. But I have no idea how to tell you that. Honestly, I have been struggling with that since we were first years. I know the chance is very little that you actually like me back. But I can hope.
