during the war because you
His look is stern, and Draco nods.
(See the end of the chapter for
As other players retreat to the back of the field, Draco and Potter go to stand in the middle. Potter is the first one to extend his hand as he mounts his broom, and Draco shakes it tightly, trying to convey his determination through all of his body and face.
He is saved from having to answer this one by Nina claiming:
“Is this your dream job?” Harry asks.
His look must be serious enough, because Hermione says “I swear” while Ron says “On Rose’s life.”
“Everything’s not fine, Harry! You were sent to die, and for what? Did you at least know you were going to survive?”
“He never wanted to give me a estimate of his own fortune, and promised, under duress, to warn me if it ever was close to running out, but yes, he is fucking loaded.”
Draco shrugs. “Nothing. He asked me not to tell anyone.”
“Harry, you seem to be forgetting something.”
“Yes, we discussed what we needed,” Draco answers stiffly.
Potter leads him up the stairs, which he climbs two by two, abandoning the screams of children behind them, and into a big but messy bedroom. Clothes are scattered over a chair in a corner, some piling on the floor and others falling from a half-open closet. The bed, placed in the middle of the room, cutting it in weird places, and barely leaving space to walk around it, has its duvet drawn over but still full of wrinkles, and a handful of clothes have been thrown onto it.
Harry stops and turns toward him, still pointing at the green beans.
Lunch with Potter is less dreadful than Draco had feared, mostly thanks to the fact that they get interrupted every thirty seconds by some kid wanting to ask something to Harry about quidditch, or tell them about something they did this morning, or show him something they found or, in one occasion, just wants to hug him. Potter kindly obliges every single time, without showing any sign of annoyance or tiredness. He smiles at each kid, is amazed but each rock or leaf they show him, or by how good they did in spelling, or shows real excitement about their potential involvement in the upcoming match. The worst of all that isn’t the patience he shows or his genuine interest in children’s trivial talks, it’s the fact that those kids all seem to adore him. Sure, Draco knows that Potter is one of the most beloved wizards in the magic world, with all his defeating you-know-who thing, but the Boy Who Lived always had his detractors and haters, and never would have Draco thought that he could spark that kind of unanimous loving. Did he bewitch these children, or is he just, as the rumour says, really good with them? Sadly, from what Draco is seeing, the latter is probably true. He is sure that himself would have lost patience by the third child interrupting his meal.
“Don’t they come by, from time to time?”
He’s wearing a darker pair of jeans and a black t-shirt with a red and white peppermint drawn in the center, and he runs his hand through his damp hair before lunging on the bed to grab a hand-knit sweater featuring a golden snitch.
“Almost there. It’s gonna be worth it, you see.”
“I’m so sorry, but I have to leave you in the hands of Padma for now, my duty calls elsewhere. I’ll talk to you all later?”
“Here’s your usual, boys,” Rosmerta says as she drops two butterbeers and two plates of fries on the table, accompanied by ketchup, mayo and brown sauce.
about the protective charms cast around the place and all the features he believes someone from the safety and secrecy department might enjoy.
Once the bedroom door is closed, Draco is all over him, hands in his hair and under his leather jacket, mouth on his jaw and neck, body pressed against him. It takes all of Harry’s will power to push him back and say:
He does indeed shut up, even if he doesn’t stop looking at Draco over the ridge of his mug. Draco sighs and sits, cross-legged, on the other side of the tray.
“Good. Padma has been very thorough with the paperwork. She made my work easy.”
Draco follows him, suddenly close to suffocating.
Harry turns, his t-shirt half on. “What?”
Draco seems surprised.
“So, what are your plans for the weekend?” Draco asks.
They’re standing in front of a miniature replica of a quidditch stadium, complete with hoops and stalls, and even a small building that could pass as a locker room. He follow Potter to the middle of the pitch, admiring not only the place but also the growing excitement in his voice as he talks about it.
Potter shrugs. “Well, I promised a redo of yesterday’s game this afternoon, so there’s that. You can come, if you want. If you’re not afraid of a dozen of kids asking you very random questions.”
“No, I get what you mean,” says Draco, making Harry raise his head. “It was a horrible thing, but thanks to it, things are better now.” He smiles sadly.
“Hey, Ron, could you come help me put the flowers?” Neville yells behind him. “Hi, Draco.” He only gives him a short nod, which Draco returns.
Draco knows he’s crossed a line, and he’s sure of it when Potter adds:
Harry turns toward Draco. “Sorry, these games with the kids are always a bit of a mess. If you see one running away, could you try to stop them? Or at least yell at me, so that I can.”
She gets up as if to lead him to the door.
Draco is mesmerized by the gesture, but he catches himself up and takes a step back.
“Yeah, well, you know how teenagers are. How about you? Any plans? Lunch with your mother?”
“And that’s fine!” he adds quickly. “I don’t mind! I can stay casual! I
Harry’s heart is beating fast again, and this time it has nothing to do with any type of physical effort. “I don’t know!” he yells-whisper. “I don’t know what we are! I thought we were friends? Casual? You obviously can’t be my boyfriend, you—”
Katie Bell. She used to play quidditch too.
Harry drags Draco through the pitch to the shed to check the equipment for this afternoon’s match and prove him that everything is safe and controlled, and then they go back to the main building by the same path, Harry rambling more and more explanations about how safe the place is for children, how they supervise everything, how it’s all protected from muggles’ eyes, and how great things generally are. Draco is mostly quiet, and Harry has no idea whether it’s a good sign or not. The increased anxiety makes him talk more and more, which gives Draco even less time to answer anything, and it’s a vicious circle he can’t get out of.
“How are you doing? Was the meeting alright?” What did they discuss? Did Draco complain about how Harry dragged him out last time?
“Yes. Teddy gave him a purpose when he didn’t have any. And in the past decade, he’s accomplished amazing things, and I believe that he is reasonably happy in his life. But, even if Teddy isn’t his sole focus anymore and he’s got a lot of things going on, the one thing Harry hasn’t gotten back to doing since the war is building a life for himself. He lives in a dorm room at his school, he spends all of his waking time with kids or working or helping anyone who asks him, and all of his money on the school or on his friends projects. And he’s a great friend, a devoted godfather and an amazing teacher, I’m not belittling anything he does. But, apart from his broomsticks – and maybe his tattoos, but that’s an entirely different story –, I haven’t seen him get excited about anything for himself for years. Until you.”
“We’re just what, Potter?” His arms are still crossed in front of him, and all trace of his half-smile is gone.
“Perfect, two fries, coming right up.”
“I’ll let him know. He told me you two were becoming quite good friends? You’re going to a quidditch match together this weekend, right?”
. Instead, he takes his hands off his pockets and readjusts his tie. Harry’s breath hitches under his fingers. Draco’s hand lingers on his chest as he flattens the fabric.
“It doesn’t matter what it sounds like,” Harry snaps, “He’s not interested in anything else.”
“You okay?” says Potter behind him, almost making him jump. “Sorry, I did as quick as I could but this stench was hard to get rid off. Sadly, there’s no spell for that, you have to do it the good old fashioned muggle way.”
“The ministry is an entity that only acts for its own benefits. Right now, the school and I make them look good, but what if it changes tomorrow? What if there’s a different minister, or more Umbridges working there? I can’t put the survival of the school and orphanage on the shoulders of such a fleeting organism.”
It doesn’t really work, as Potter explodes into laughter and the way he’s late to put his hand in front of his mouth, the way he blinks, the way he almost splashes his drink, is worse than what Draco was trying to avoid.
Draco stops and turns back, then waits for him.
Also, neither the internet nor the Harry Potter creature books could tell me how long an hippogriff lives.
Draco nods curtly but his face shows no expression, so Harry decides to just keep rambling until he stops him. He can ramble for hours about this place, anyway.
“Like the Chosen One,” he says with a smirk.
Draco starts to expect the worst. Was Harry making this place more wonderful than it actually is? Is I actually on the verge of falling apart?
“Yes. He’s great with them. It’s just…” she hesitates a bit. “Sometimes, it feels like he doesn’t really know how to fit in the adult world, you know what I mean?”
“You fucking—” He hears Draco say behind him, right before the children underneath start yelling and clapping.
“Harpies are better than you, you bastards!” Nina yells.
Both teams are shaking hands and hugging in a spirit of comradry. Harry would like to go after Draco, hug him, kiss him and tell him it was just luck, but Draco doesn’t seem in the mood for that and everyone else is around them. He resolves to do that later as Ginny pulls him in for a hug and drags him to the rest of his team, who joyfully claps him on the back. Children are also gathering around them all, yelling and jumping and asking wild questions. Harry feels good seeing some of them are surrounding Draco, keeping him busy.
He knows that, were he to leave the school and orphanage, the place would be I good hands, and that it could thrive without him. But he doesn’t want to. Over the past decade, it had become his home, his child, his everything. He couldn’t imagine being forced to leave it all behind him. Surely Padma wouldn’t do that to him. She still needs him, right? But maybe he should be easier on her. More attentive.
She pouts, but complies nonetheless as she flies away from him. He smiles. No matter how much Nina protests, she always ends up listening to him.
“Lumos,” Draco says behind him.
Draco must have made some sound, as Harry turns to him and, pushing back his hair, smiles at him.
Draco takes a step toward him, close enough to breath in his air. “No,” he growls.
Ron catches Rose just before she collides with Harry, and she raises her head toward Draco.
“That’s true,” Potter laughs, “Ginny is the best seeker of all.”
“What I’m saying is, I like being your friend, I guess.”
“We almost waited!” Ginny yells at them, as everyone is already gathered on the field, divided in two teams.
Draco turns swiftly to him, fists tight against his thighs.
“Ginny also comes sometimes, to wow them with some fancy techniques she learnt. She also gives us invitations for the whole school to some of her matches. The kids think she’s way cooler than me and they’re absolutely right.”
“It was brilliant!” Potter exclaims as he takes one of the glasses. “I won’t bore you with the details, I know you don’t care, but know that Ginny did a stunning catch of the snitch.”
She stares at him a bit more before answering. “Yes. It’s true.” After another silence, she asks: “What are you going to do with that information?”
Potter stares at him a bit, a half smile on his lips, then finishes his drink in one gulp. “Should we go?”
“And you’re the one teaching them?” asks Draco when his tongue unglues from his teeth, watching Potter’s smile glow through the hoop.
She rolls her eyes. “You know what I mean. If he makes you happy, Harry, I’m happy for you.”
“Seems like you still enjoy to disobey your current headmistress.”
“You can tell us if you’re in trouble, mate,” Ron adds, giving him his plate back, full of mushroom pie and lentil salad.
“Draco!” he yells when he’s close enough.
“That black spot over there, though,” he winces, “is where Luna very kindly planted what she believed to be innocent hairy corndoodles gathered on her trip to Greece, but turned out to be very dangerous level three controlled substances plants? I don’t even remember the precise name. Luckily professor Sprout was here only a couple days after they were planted, and very kindly took them from us before anyone got hurt. She was actually pretty happy, she said it would be a good project for her seventh years. But now Luna is forbidden from bringing anything here, plant or beast or even food, that hasn’t been approved by a specialist of the topic. That’s a bit of a shame, the kids love her and hearing the stories of her travels. She’s quite a good storyteller.”
“Good. Thank you.” She looks toward the library next to her desk, as if considering her next words. “You know, that fucked him up quite a lot. Dying, I mean, and learning that he was always supposed to,” she adds, turning back to Draco. “Well, his whole childhood probably fucked him up – I know it fucked
“Not today, the game was longer than expected and we have to catch our portkey. Come on, guys, no lingering. Matty, you stay with me.”
Harry stops abruptly and turns toward him. “And you think I asked for that? You think I ever wanted that? I never did. I never wanted to do what I’ve done. But I had to, so I did it. But it never was about me. It always was about what I could do.” He takes a deep breath in and turns his head toward the tavern, a few meters ahead of them. “They don’t love me, you know. They love who they want me to be. Just like they hate who they want you to be,” he concludes, staring at him.
“The dirty children?” asks Draco at the same volume.
“It had to be done,” Harry simply says, interrupting him. “And it had to be done that way.”
The desk is covered in random piles of parchments, books half open or put there as they didn’t fit on the shelves above – probably –, and a few trinkets. In another corner, next to the window, Draco spots an owl perch.
“Yes. Maybe I shouldn’t…”
“That was a foul! The referee is a dick!”
“What? No! It’s just… that’s not what we are, right? We’re just…”
“It’s unfair,” Potter says, surprisingly angry at the thought. “It’s been almost fifteen years, for fuck’s sake. Most people aren’t anymore who they were at seventeen, so why should they judge us for who we were?”
He raises his eyebrows, and she laughs.
“Yes,” he breathes. “I guess we are.”
So far, his only answer to what Potter has become in this past decade is “more gorgeous”.
“It was fun,” Draco smirks as Harry turns away from him to face his dresser.
“I have accused you of making assumptions about me, and yet I have been guilty of the exact same thing toward you. And for that, I… I apologize.”
Draco resolutely walks the hall toward Padma’s office, trying to convince himself he’s not looking for Potter when he’s glancing around him through open doors. He doesn’t know whether he’s relieved or not when he reaches the headmistress’ office without seeing him.
“See you later,” Potter says as he walks to the door. “Thanks for coming. Enjoy the buffet and the champagne.”
Draco nods. He knows exactly.
“You can come,” Draco interrupts him.
Draco swears in the dark, before stumbling next to Harry.
“And is it going to be a problem for the ministry that Harry can do what he wants in the institution he founded?” asks Padma with a no-nonsense face.
Potter’s smile widen and he sighs “Thanks.” He turns back and takes some cards out of his jacket. “Okay, time for the speech. Wish me luck.”
He doesn’t really know what did it. Maybe it was the snake, maybe it was the nakedness, maybe it was the place. But, suddenly, all his good resolutions about not involving himself with someone who wants to keep him hidden are gone.
In the end, he joins Draco standing on the edge and says: “The property extends until that fence over there. If you want to go and start checking what you have to check, I’ll join you right after I’ve taken the kids back inside.
“Well, first, Demelza had the quaffle,” Matty answers, “but she was hit by a bludger, like, on her arm, so she dropped it, but then it was caught by…”
“Teddy has got his Hogsmeade outing tomorrow, so I told him I’ll take him for ice cream after lunch, but I guess I’m more excited about that than he is. He would probably rather hang out with his friends than with an old man like me.”
And Harry is just sitting there, staring at him, telling him all this as if it isn’t the most heartbreaking story he’s ever heard, as if he wasn’t a kid who walked to his own death because he
“But… you’re alive,” is all Draco finds to say at that point.
Draco shoots him a glance without stopping his spellwork. Harry Potter, the Saviour, the Chosen One, who had just killed Voldemort, depressed? But Potter doesn’t notice him and continues.
“Enough about me,” he laughs awkwardly. “How did
With a move of his wand, Harry accios a broom straight from the changing rooms.
“That crazy thing published by Luna’s father?” Draco smirks.
“Brown sauce,” Draco answers in the most obvious tone as he catches the bottle. “Everyone know that’s where it’s at.”
“Wait until you see Debbie.”
“Very Gryffindor of him,” Draco says coldly.
“Don’t worry, Draco. I don’t blame you. Her and I still have a lot to work through. But I’m very glad you’re here tonight. I can’t wait to get to know you better. Harry can’t keep you to himself forever, right?”
The coffee is alright. Not perfect, but perfectly acceptable. Good enough to wake him up and chase the last clouds from his brain. He finishes the first cup, then pours himself another one as Potter silently munches on another piece of almost burnt toast.
stop donating?”
“Thanks,” she exhales. “I’ll owe you.”
“Hi,” he starts before Draco can say anything or close it back on his nose. “I know you probably don’t want to see me, and I probably should have taken the hint from when you didn’t answer me all the other times I owled you, but I promise I won’t be long, so please listen? You don’t have to say anything.” Fuck, he’s starting to sound pleading.
“Why? It isn’t a bad thing.”
Katie shrugs.
“Yeah, right. Casually.”
“If you have a broom, I could ride one, I guess.”
He turns back and leans against the doorframe.
“You know what, today is your birthday, so I’ll let you jab at me all you want. Consider it my present.”
“But he’s our best tour guide. He know everything there is to know about this place, and he has more passion for it than any of us there. I mean, we all love it and would do anything to make it succeed, but he’s the founder, you know?”
“Good morning, Potter.”
It also is one of the rare times where he actually enjoys being in a crowd. Sure, there a always a few people who recognize him, but that’s just part of his life now, he’s learnt to deal with it. But he loves the energy of the audience, the screams of joy, the chants, the cheers ; it truly uplifts him and his spirit in a way not many other things can. Here, he feels like he’s a part of something whole – just as much as any audience member. He’s yelling with everyone else, groaning with everyone else, feeling with everyone else. There, he can just forget about who he is.
“I mean, I didn’t like the guy,” Harry clarifies, “but he was your dad. I’m sorry you lost him.”
And they’re gone through the door. Potter doesn’t let go of him and laughs as he says:
The truth is, Draco feels uncomfortable hearing her talking about Potter with such praise. Not because of some leftover “petty Hogwarts rivalry”, as she just called it, but because he would so much love to have a reason to hate Potter. To be able to say “sure, he’s hot, but he’s a dick, so let’s move on from that.” Having a reason to dismiss him would make his life so much easier. But no, of course Potter has to be this passionate, perfect and kind saviour of kids who’s loved by all of his colleagues. All of that on top of his obvious handsomeness.
ministry funding?” Draco asks, as if he hasn’t heard the last part.
“Are you coming or are you standing there?”
“Hi, Draco.”
“Well, Luna just explained to me how they had to publish public pleasing stories like the investigation on Gringott’s real protections to be able to publish actual important articles like the one on the rare Siberian winged troll, so I’m not sure.”
He doesn’t know if he should, but he lets his curiosity take the best of him and approaches the pictures on the walls to observe them closer. There’s one that seems to be from Weasley and Granger’s wedding, with Potter grinning at his two best friends, and another one with the whole Weasley family, that was probably taken at Christmas, if he believes the decorated tree behind them. A lot of them feature a boy at different ages, who must be Teddy. He’s sometimes with Potter, but mostly alone or with other people that Draco doesn’t always recognize. One picture was taken in front of the new orphanage building, and Harry is smiling widely, one arm around Padma’s shoulder and the other around an older woman, in whom Draco recognizes his own great-aunt Andromeda – Teddy’s grandmother.
“No one…” Draco plunges his face into his hands and mumbles: “For fuck’s sake, Harry. You can’t just
Draco doesn’t really hug him back, but Harry pretends he doesn’t care. Draco isn’t the affectionate type, so what. They’re not dating, anyway.
Hermione laughs briefly. “Yes, I guess. But, mostly, very Harry. Apart from broomsticks and a few personal trinkets, he has never been really interested in material possessions. He has a huge house he barely ever uses and mostly serves as a hotel for visiting friends in need, he gives away his old broomsticks to friends or Hogwarts students, and he even offered to give Ron and I his own house when we were looking for a place to live – we refused, obviously, it was enough he paid for the wedding—”
“I won’t tell anyone.”
“It’s really nice, what you’ve done with the school and orphanage,” Draco finally says.
“I don’t need Hermione to think, thank you very much,” Harry snaps.
“I wouldn’t say better, no.”
Draco feels incredibly more angry than he should be at this idea – and also a bit ashamed for saying (and thinking) Potter was acting inconsiderately. As Padma just said, Potter is a grown man. What he chooses to do with his own money shouldn’t trouble Draco that much. “But doesn’t he need it for himself? Is this why he dresses like a beggar?”
“I’m not judging! Ron protests. Look! Alright. Are you two together now, or what? What?” he says when Hermione rolls her eyes. “I’m being understanding! And supportive!”
“Coming right up.”
Draco pushes him back. He can’t be like that. “How are you not angry?” Because himself is angry. Very angry. At Voldemort, at the whole wizarding world, at Dumbledore, at anyone who put Harry in that position, and even at Harry for acting it was all normal.
“I could see that. Luckily, someone took him back in. I just hope it was one of your people.”
He looks at Draco as if expecting an answer, a deep look that penetrates him and almost makes his breath hitch.
“Yeah. You said you likes games, but didn’t really think about going, so I thought you might go and enjoy it if you had the tickets.”
“Friends. You know.” Potter shrugs, then take a step to him. “Or…”
Well.
“Did she just let us leave without paying?” Draco asks, just to say something.
“I will try.”
Potter also said he could bring a plus one, and Draco asked whether he meant a lover. Potter had the decency to look away and say he meant a friend. Draco hesitated about that too, but if he brought a friend he would have to explain to them what they were doing here, so he didn’t want that.
“There are always at least two other adults present with him, and every creature and animal he show has to be approved by both our staff and the Hogwarts staff. Children are also not allowed to touch and it’s merely and observation, you know, we see it, like the garden, as an introduction to what expects them at Hogwarts. The important thing is that the children get familiar with the magical world, even if they don’t understand it. To prepare them, you now? But in a fun way. Because they’re kids. They deserve to have fun. That’s what childhood is supposed to be all about, after all, no?”
up, in a way, and I’m not him, nothing was expected of me, and there was no prophecy about me—”
Maybe he’s right, because Draco has never been a fan of Hagrid and his teaching methods – even if he must admit that, as a teenager, he wasn’t a perfect student in his classes. But Potter is so quick at justifying everything that happens that Draco doesn’t have time for voicing any concern.
“Sure. Don’t worry, I will do honour to the place,” he smiles as he sees the tension in her shoulders. “It’s just routine, anyway, I will wow them with our top notch installations and projects before you submerge them into paperwork.”
“You wish,” Harry laughs, flying a bit higher in hope to catch sight of the snitch.
Harry turns back. “The door is open.”
He looks down, and Draco feels his warm fingers on his cool wrist, just under his faded mark, and he clenches his fist while inhaling sharply.
He then takes a step back a disappears into thin air in a crack, still staring at him. Harry shivers and starts walking the other way.
“I didn’t mean it that way,” Draco says, putting down his glass. “It’s just, I’ve heard that same speech in her mouth about fifteen million times.”
He feels like that’s something he’s tried to do all of his life, and always failed at.
The one thing that hasn’t changed is that Draco is full-on intent to pierce that mystery.
“You’ll pay me back with a butterbeer,” he waves as he leaves.
Draco huffs and turns away from him, but doesn’t let go of his hand. “Fuck you, Potter.”
“Yes, he always has extra tickets. Be warned, though, you will be expected to babysit the kids with him. That’s why Ron says he doesn’t want to accept his invitations anymore – he pretends he can’t follow the game. He still goes when he can, though.”
Did that fucker just squeeze his hand? Did he really, just after telling him, in the most distanced tone, that he died because that was the only way to kill Voldemort, squeeze Draco’s hand to
Draco glances at him with a smile. “I’m not really allowed to talk about that.”
“Harry, is it true we’re having a quidditch game after lunch?” asks excitedly a blond girl with messy braids.
“That’s a cool name,” she says after thinking about it. “Hey, Harry, can I help you? I’m three, now, I’m old enough to help!”
“Is the pep talk over, now?”
“Well, yeah. Something about the power of love or some shit. I don’t know, it’s magic. But yeah, then I killed the actual Voldemort, and all of his horcruxes were destroyed, and we all moved on.”
Draco gets up and shakes his head. “No, that was all. Thank you, I won’t take up more of your time.”
“Perfect. See you then. I promise we won’t reminisce about the good old times.”
“Do you have any plans for Sunday?” Potter asks with a glance to him as he gives him a refill.
He finally lets go and Draco turns away, shooting daggers at him.
end up working at the ministry’s secrecy and security department?”
“No buts!” A handful of kids giggle. “Just, don’t touch anything. Go on, everyone to the bathroom.”
“Worth it? For who?” He knows he is talking too loudly, to angrily, but he can’t stop those feelings from storming out.
, right? You know, I thought maybe you had changed, but all your big speeches about unity are just that, speeches, right? So I’m done. I will not be your dirty little secret, or your repentance, or whatever the fuck that was for you. Alright? I’m done.”
Draco shakes hand with the small group, and everyone is polite with him, even if he’s sure to see the minister frowning slightly. They make some idle chat for a couple of minutes, then Potter says:
“Oh, you want to make it… spicier?”
“Wait. I have something for you.”
“Yes. Apart from that, I’ll be home, I guess. Zabini mentioned maybe he’ll drop by London over the weekend, but you never know with him, so we’ll see.”
Harry laughs and leans forward.
. Or is that how kids call it these days?”
Its only when the bedroom door is closed behind them that Potter seems to sober up a little. He stares at Draco in the darkness, his chest puffing, until, slowly, he raises the hand that isn’t holding his to his cheek, softly running his thumb under Draco’s eye.
Potter laughs and walks in front of him. “Come on. It’s about to start.”
He puts a fry into his mouth and turns to Draco to find him frozen, staring daggers at him. “What?” he asks, feeling panic start to rise in him.
“I am a simple man with simple tastes,” Harry answers while plunging the mixing fry into his mouth. “What, how does an enlightened man like you eat his fries? Salt and vinegar?”
Draco grabs Harry’s hand and intertwine their fingers. “I’m happy to be here,” he answers – and realises it’s true. He knows there are still hard conversations ahead, and anxiety over the world knowing about them but, right now, he’s happy. “Harry birthday, Harry,” he whispers back.
“Great. See you Saturday, maybe, then?”
“I literally did.”
“Not now, Padma,” answers Potte without turning back, “Draco needs me!”
“Oh, right, that was clear for you. Well, some of these kids don’t know where they come from, and they all have questions about that. I – we – try to teach them that each house has its own qualities, and sometimes we tell them about this or that trait they have that could make them fit in one or the other. Anyway, in the end, they’re gonna choose it themselves.”
Putting the glasses on the table, Harry looks at Ron rising up to face Draco. Like his daughter, he extends his hand. “Hi, mate.” His tone is a bit strained, but overall not aggressive.
Harry flies down to his level, fully smiling. “All is fair in quidditch and love, right?”
“Harry, your nemesis is there!”
“Sorry. Here I am, complaining about people recognizing me, when it must have been so much harder for you.”
, right?”
“More coffee?” Potter asks as he drops the second shoe with the first one.
Draco’s thumb caresses Harry’s collarbone.
All of Draco’s focus is now on the game he doesn’t intend to lose. He doesn’t remember ever wanting to win that bad at anything before – even all of the other times he played against Potter.
“How kind of you.”
Draco is taken aback by his anger, just like last time, but even more by the following calmness.
Draco is frozen in his spot, trying to understand what she’s saying. “You… knew?” he finally asks.
“Amantha taught me what it meant.”
Harry feels bad for being so rude. He had forgotten that Hermione and Draco actually work together from time to time, and are due to occasionally stumble into each other at the ministry. And, Hermione being Hermione, the whole ministry has probably heard her views on the subject by now. “We happen to share some opinions, sometimes.”
“Did you win? Are you better than him?”
“One day,” Harry whispers as he leans forward to kiss him, “I’ll tell you about that time I took polyjuice potion to follow you inside your common room.”
Harry shakes his head and plunges his fork into the salad. “He didn’t need to.” He raises his head and, looking at his friends, adds. “Look, I’m not entirely stupid. I’m always the one who suggest we may meet, he never has a nice word for me, and he never even really says yes to anything I suggest, he just does it, and he never says anything personal about himself. I mean, both the sex and the conversation are great, but I’m not blind, I know that’s all it is. And that’s fine.”
“Thanks for the rescue. McKinnon makes terrible jokes and I have to laugh at all of them.”
“You’ve always been good at gathering crowds.”
“Ohhh, like Harry! Did you play quidditch with Harry?”
“You are never of any help after a quidditch game,” Katie laughs. “Just, go. Stop exciting them.”
“What’s your name?”
“Good to know.” He then turns to Harry as he puts the tickets back in the envelop and smiles. “Thanks, Potter.”
Harry shrugs.
Harry smiles as he puts on his glasses and catches sight of Hogwarts through the window. It never gets old. He gets out of bed, sniffs a couple of t-shirts until he finds one that he deems okay and lets the others fall to the floor. He’ll do laundry tomorrow, he thinks for the fourth day in a row as he puts his wand in the back pocket of his jeans.
“Louder for the people in the back!” Harry laughs, not letting go of his hand.
Draco stops in his tracks. Oh shit. Doesn’t he like birthdays? Maybe Harry shouldn’t have brought that up.
Draco arches an eyebrow. “Is that supposed to be a compliment?”
Where he was expecting a clean jean and a t-shirt with no holes – what he thought Potter’s idea of “fancy dress” was –, he sees a dark green, well-tailored suit, on a crisp white shirt. With his dark hair that he slightly trimmed before coming to London to stop it from constantly falling into his eyes, Potter is stunning. Not that he would ever tell him. Or anyone. And – is he wearing a tie? Draco doesn’t want to dwell on that.
She stops and stares at him. “I will ask you one thing, Harry. And I need you to be honest. Does he make you happy?”
Potter turns towards him with an expression of surprise, but it quickly disappears as he runs one hand through his hair as he extends the other toward him.
He looks almost apologetic as he quickly turns to smile at Draco, as if he was sorry that the whole place was not fully exploited. He doesn’t have to be. Having space is nice. Besides, the new building only opened five years ago, it makes sense that not all of it has been exploited.
“What are you working on, beside us? The school, I mean.”
“I’ll put that on your tab, then. Anything else you boys want?”
“Why don’t you live in London?”
“So,” Ginny says as they’re far enough, “You and Malfoy.”
Draco turns to him. “Do you
His voice is softer than usual. Harry turns back.
“For some fucking mysterious reason, I don’t hate you,” Draco hisses between his teeth, looking away.
“Could we have some fries, please? And… Draco?”
“My aunt says Slytherins are evil,” a boy with spiky hair intervenes.
“I just thought you could provide me a way out at some point”, Potter continues, leaning on the table. “It’s nice to know there are people around to whom I actually enjoy talking. Ron and Hermione are here too, but they usually leave early, because of the babysitter.” He winces. “Sorry. I invited you for selfish reasons, I guess.”
Draco winces. “Isn’t she in her eighties?”
“You’re very smart, Jordan, and very cunning, so you would make a good Slytherin,” he answers as he puts his hand on the boy’s shoulder. “But Ravenclaw or any other house would be lucky to have you.”
Draco nods, but Potter barely sees him as he’s already moving forward without an answer, and Draco can only follow.
His tone indicates that it’s probably not the first time he’s said that. Yet, Draco can’t help himself but says:
There is no feeling in the world equivalent to being high up over a quidditch field, with the wind against your ear and that mixture of adrenaline and deep focus as Harry looks for the snitch. No matter what he has done, nothing ever compared to that. It’s both urgency and freedom that courses through his veins. He wants to win today, not because he has to prove anything to Draco, but because he always had a competitive side in him, and if you aren’t playing quidditch to win, then why are you here?
“Yeah, kinda,” Potter laughs. “I have a house in London, but I’m barely ever there. Only when I need to, for work, or when I’m visiting friends. And you? You still live at Malfoy manor?”
“Well, something came up.”
Harry laughs and, without looking, points his arm to the window. “The view.” He raises himself up on his elbow to stare at it, not resisting the temptation. The silhouette of the castle is shadowed against the luminous night sky where, at this time of the year, the sun always illuminate the horizon. “I love to see it when I wake up, and if I put the bed against the wall, then I have to stretch my neck, or get up, for that.”
“Yet, Potter, I still like quidditch.”
Potter takes a sip. “I’m sorry, did you hear me say anything about the freakish neatness of your place? No. Then don’t tell me anything about how I organize my stuff.”
“You remember the ministry inspection today at nine?” He nods, and she continues. “I have a last minute meeting with parents, so can you welcome them and give them a tour while I finish? It shouldn’t take long.”
He turns to Draco.
Harry sighs and smiles. That question is the reason why he likes to have this one tattoo hidden. “I don’t hate snakes, you know. This one actually based on a boa constrictor I met as a child and that probably was kinder to me than any other human being in my life at that time. The fact that it’s associated with Voldemort and dark magic in general doesn’t mean the animals in themselves are bad. This is sort of a reminder to stay open-minded.”
“I don’t usually have plans on Sundays evenings,” Draco retorts as they walk to the door.
“So I heard the game was good.”
“Yeah, well, it happened anyway and we can’t change that now. We can only compose with what we have.” Staring back at him, he adds, in an almost defiant tone. “And didn’t we say we wouldn’t reminisce about the past tonight?”
Draco nods as he gives him the broom back. “Alright. But I can work on my own, you know.”
“For someone who seems so eager to let go of the past, you don’t seem very good at forgiving.”
“So, how come you don’t go to games often?” Potter asks after taking a huge gulp.
“Padma, I know it’s none of my business, professional or otherwise but, as I was going through the ministry’s files on this place, I couldn’t help but notice you only receive minimal pubic funding. Now, I know Potter said that you wish to remain independent, and that you have a lot of generous private donors, but you know you could ask for more, right? I could direct you to the correct forms, if you wish. You would get it, with all the amazing work you do here.”
She quickly glances away before coming back to him. “If he didn’t tell you, I guess that’s not my secret to tell.”
A reducing spell and dozens of excited exclamations later, he gets up as he looks at his watch.
“Are you sure? I can help.”
In the decade since the war, Draco and Potter haven’t exactly become friends, but the magical world is small enough that they were forced to run into each other at frequent intervals, and as Potter proved no desire to fight with him in any way or fuel the climate of animosity that had existed between them since their very first meeting, Draco eventually gave up being angry at him too. Now, they are cordial when in each other’s presence, saying hi nodding when their paths cross.
(See the end of the chapter for
He also feels a quick surge of pride.
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco eventually says.
“You seem to be doing good, though.” Draco says, almost bitterly.
Draco clears his throat. “Why don’t you… clean the children magically before going in?”
And with a pop he disappears, and Harry is left alone with his explanations on the tongue and thousands of thoughts swirling in his head.
“You’ll tell that to Harry, he’s the one who took care of everything. He’s busy talking to all the ministry officials right now, but I’m sure you’ll be able to catch up with him at some point. Come on, let me show you around.”
And, before Draco can even say anything, he’s already turned away.
There are a few false starts, on both sides, but, as the score grows, the snitch is still invisible to all.
“Thanks, you’re amazing, as usual.”
“You look great,” Harry says with a smirk. “I’m glad you came.”
Draco is a bit surprised that Potter didn’t use the situation to boast about his victory over Draco, but he isn’t going to complain.
“I don’t think anyone there would enjoy parting with you,” Draco says before taking a sip.
He waves at her awkwardly and starts walking toward Draco. “You could have just owled me, you know,” he says as he draws the chair facing him.
Draco feels like he’s being lectured by a teacher who is way too smart for him, and he doesn’t like the feeling.
“Yes.” Potter’s tone is less categorical as he continues. “I mean, the whole point of this war was to give everyone else, all those coming after us, a better future, right? And it starts not with defeating the dark arts, because they will never truly be. There will always be someone to embrace them, no matter what happens, you know? So it starts with the children. The sooner they can understand the power of unity and the beauty of the world, both magical and muggle, the less they will want to destroy that, you know? And also, what was I supposed to do, abandon those kids? What kind of world are we building if we’re not here for children?”
“I have a meeting with the headmistress,” he answers.
Something in his stare makes Harry lower his head in his glass.
“What do you mean? I’ve been at Grimmauld place.”
Harry laughs. He was a bit afraid Draco wouldn’t come, considering how long he took to answer his owl, but seeing him here is a relief. It means Harry didn’t mess up everything.
His mother, saving Harry Potter. The most surprising thing about this is that it isn’t the most surprising thing he’s heard tonight.
Harry raises up, his breath back somewhere close to normal. “Sorry I kept you waiting. I make you come all the way up here, the least I could do is be on time.”
“You know, she adds, I don’t know exactly what happened between you two, he didn’t tell me anything expect that he messed up bad, and I won’t pry but, in case you hadn’t noticed: Harry is probably the most oblivious person I know – well, apart from Ron, I guess,” she winces. “If you don’t put something straight under his nose, he probably won’t get the hint. I mean, there’s a reason he wasn’t a Ravenclaw,” she tries to joke.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Please wait at least until tomorrow to scare him away.”
“Morning, Padma.”
Oh shit. What went wrong?
, you should come, if you want. It’s just a small gathering with friends, there are usually around twenty of us depending on everyone’s plans, so it’s nothing big.”
“Good to hear. How’s your mother?”
Draco feels really stupid. There’s Potter, in front of him, who just brought him breakfast and asked him to spend another hour in bed with him, and what is he doing? Weighing his options? There are no options here, really. There’s only staying or eternal regrets. He raises his head. He can be late to his mother’s, for once.
“Get away from me, you stinky rat!”
“But…” Draco starts regaining control of his brain. Is Potter really emptying all of his vault into this orphanage? Is he that rich? Does he have any idea on how to manage money? “But what happens if – Merlin forbids – he dies, or doesn’t want to give his money to this place anymore?”
Draco seems stunned as Harry retreats, beaming, still holding his shoulder.
“Yeah, you could do that. Or…”
“I’ll take a coffee,” he forces himself to say.
He extends his hand to shake Draco’s, but realises that it’s still full of dirt and ends up waving awkwardly as he leaves.
“But you don’t have to stay,” Potter adds. “Maybe you have things to do. You can apparate straight out of here, if you want. Do as you wish, really.”
Five minutes later, he’s dragging Draco behind the stage, then through a door leading to a small dressing room.
should – tone down our assumptions about each other and have a real conversation, right? Because I… um… I enjoy your company too.”
The next time Harry walks in front of Padma’s office, the door is still closed, so, as lunch time has started, he takes the parents to the dinner hall so they can have a chat with kids about the place. The mixed couple – one’s a witch and the other a muggle – have a seven-year-old starting to show early signs of magic, and they are thinking about putting her to school for a few days a week, so she can make friends and start learning about magic. The witch mother is completely on board with that, but her muggle wife still has doubts about the whole magic thing and is a bit scared about her daughter’s powers and her future. Harry, having grown in the muggle world, has done his best to show her how great it would be for their kid to be surrounded by kids like her and how beneficial it would be for her entry into Hogwarts that is bound to come. It’s not the first time he’s faced this kind of situation and, even if each person is different, he now has a strategy on how to present things to get everyone on board. Having the parents talk to other children is the cherry on top of the cake of his previous presentation, so they can se how happy they are about the school.
Draco snorts in surprise. He hadn’t thought about following Potter into the shower, but now the picture is definitely on his mind. He does his best to push it away.
He flies away for a couple of minutes to follow the action, then comes back to Draco, who still seems lost in thoughts.
“You could stay here, you know. With all the firewhisky we had, maybe it’s not
“Debbie’s fine,” she says before darting away, calling at Nina.
His hands on Potter’s thighs, Draco leans forward and bites his hip.
“I didn’t know if you preferred tea or coffee, so I brought both, and also both orange and grapefruit juice, and about every type of marmalade we have, so you can pick what you like.”
has never been a reliable source.”
Potter doesn’t let go of his hand all the way to his room, trying to keep quiet in the corridors, but apparently he can’t stop himself from giggling and turning to Draco, missing some stairs in the process. Draco isn’t surprised that Potter is a messy drunk, but at that point he just finds it endearing.
“Hi, Weasley,” Draco says as he shakes Ron’s hand. “Your daughter is…” he turns and sees her being dragged back from the table by a laughing Harry. “… lively.”
“Do you know any other Draco?”
“Yeah, I’ll pay her next time, don’t worry. We always do that when the night is busy. She knows where I live, anyway,” Potter answers while sliding into the crowd.
“We won, Harry, we won!” Matty yells, on the other side of him.
Harry snorts. That’s the least he could say. But dwelling on their Hogwarts hobbies isn’t part of tonight’s plans.
“I’ll see how it goes,” Draco says, though he already knows he doesn’t want to miss a minute of Potter dressed like that.
He shakes his head. “Padma. I brought up the subject of ministry funding with her, and she spilled the beans, I guess. Harry only told me about ‘generous private donors’.”
“Is this for me?” Harry asks, pointing at one of the two butterbeers sitting on the table.
“I’ll see,” Draco answers with his usual half-smile, arms crossed in front of him on the table.
Draco has a head start, but Harry has a better broomstick, so their chances are about equal. Harry understands, thought, that he won’t be able to catch the snitch before Draco does, and his best chance is in placing himself right between them, blocking Draco’s path, who has to stop abruptly.
“What are you…” Ron starts, tuning to her. He then takes a deep breath. “Ok, right, I know he’s changed since school, and that he’s no longer a dick or anything, and I’m ok with him, you know, existing and doing his shit — I am! Really!” he adds to Hermione’s frown. “But like… he’s
He sighs. “Sorry. I’m not mad at you. I’m not mad at all. I’m seeing Draco, it’s casual, it will lead nowhere, I’m fine with it, that’s all there is to say about it. Alright?”
He can see it too, now, the tiny golden sparkling point, and so does the other seeker. But Ginny flies like lightning, and a few seconds later she emerges, hand in the hair and triumphant smile on the lips.
“Well, I’m here, am I not?”
Draco looks down and sees a black shirt with “Bikini Kill” written on it in faded white. It does look clean, if crudely folded and rudely worded. He puts it on.
“Oh, and over there, on the far side – we can go if you want, but we don’t have to, there’s nothing much to see,” he says as he points to the opposite side of the field, “we have a few enclosures that are currently empty but where Hagrid sometimes comes to show the kids some creatures. Harmless ones, of course, like bowtruckles. We have a very strict control over what he does,” he says very quickly, observing Draco closely as if expecting a snarling remark from him.
“Yeah.” Harry is afraid he’ll scare him if he says too much.
Draco has the smallest of nod, probably to acknowledge he’s heard him. Harry waves awkwardly and turns back to the stairs.
“So you went to fight Voldemort, and he killed you?” he asks, trying to piece things together with the crumbs Harry is giving him.
She winces. “Well, not all of it, but yeah, he did substantially help. We felt a bit guilty accepting, at first, but we actually needed the help at the time. Besides, now we’ve realised it’s just how he is. He helped Neville set up his greenhouses, he finances most of Luna’s travels when she can’t find another way, he invested in Dean and Seamus’ pub when they started, and even once bought a whole lot of top-notch broomsticks for Ginny’s team, when the club was doing poorly. You know, at the time, he even gave George – and Fred – the money to start their shop.”
“That’s fucking fucked up,” Draco seethes, running his hands through his own hair.
Draco seems taken aback by the question. “I… I don’t know,” he stutters. “I’m just glad I have a respectable job.”
Harry winces. “You’re right. I’ll take them off.” He leans to untie them, then takes off his socks as well. “This will have to do.”
“Good morning, Padma. Sorry, I am a little early.”
“Oh, okay.” Harry feels both disappointed and relieved. He’s trying to review what he could have done wrong, and also to find a way to keep Draco here so he could try to extract the answer from him. Even if, at the same time, he doesn’t really want to stand under his wrath. “Hey, are you free on Saturday?” He asks, almost as a pretext. “I’m taking the kids to the Harpies’ game, and we always have spare tickets. Do you want to come?”
Padma rolls her eyes. “Are you really still on this petty Hogwarts rivalry? This was fifteen years ago, Draco. Grow up.”
His throat is tight. He has the impression Draco has been distant tonight – more than usual –, as if he did something wrong. Or maybe he’s getting bored with him already? He shouldn’t have invited him to the fundraiser. It was boring, and noisy, and why did he think Draco would enjoy it when he hates them himself? That was a terrible idea.
prints.”
Relief fills his lungs. She does seem genuine. But then he remembers the situation.
He’s still drying his hair with one hand, and Potter puts a mug of coffee in the other.
“But, what if your
“I guess I was, yes.” There’s something in his eyes Draco doesn’t want to explore.
“You okay doing it on your own, Jerry? I’ll be right back.”
“It’s a nice garden,” Draco says with a curt nod, surprising Harry. “I can’t wait to taste the spinach. Do the kids cook too?”
“Draco. Can we… not talk about this anymore? It’s not exactly a fun time of my life, and I… can we just stop? It had to be done, and I did it, and I’m still here to tell the tale, and that’s all there is to know about it.”
“Harry, Draco needs to perform some checking spells on the grounds this afternoon, could you accompany him?” asks Padma as the mothers get up to follow her.
“And tonight, after you leave us,” Ron smirks, “will you
“I will not name names,” Harry warns, pointing at him with a fry. “Just trust me when I say that blood magic can do as much good as harm.”
Because, even though Potter is sitting right next to him right now, and their legs are touching under the table, and Potter keeps dragging him into the conversation, he knows all that will crumble if anyone else gets the first hint of what’s exactly going on between them. He knows he should walk away now, before it’s too late.
He waves it off with his hand. “It’s alright. I guess with kids there are always bound to be… incidents.”
The hit of fresh air is the most welcome once they step out, but only for a couple of seconds, because after he’s shivering. The May nights are still pretty cold, despite the sun never quite setting down behind the horizon. That’s the thing that was always the hardest for him to get used to, in Scotland. In summer, the nights aren’t quite real, and in winter, they are far too real.
Harry decides to play it off casually, as he does best. “I guess all these years storing useless information on you to fuel my feud at Hogwarts finally paid off. But I won’t mention it again, if you mind it.”
Draco shrugs. “I don’t think about it, I guess. I do enjoy it, but I don’t look for it, you know what I mean?”
mayo? What kind of gross taste buds do you have?” Draco smirks.
“But with Draco, you don’t have that problem. He clearly won’t idolize you, but he knows what you’ve been through, and he’s been through the same thing, in a way –
“Oh, you know, the usual putting my foot in my mouth.”
Oh Merlin, Padma is gonna kill him later. He will be the one who has to pay the rounds of butterbeer.
Harry winces as he dips a couple of fries into his ketchup and mayo mix.
Welcoming the opportunity to ease the mood, Harry talks about the kids, the quidditch practice, the garden, Ginny’s visit on Wednesday that had all of the children mad for hours –some of them haven’t even calmed down yet –, the fundraiser he’s working on; anything to fill the walk to the kitchen. They go through the back entrance to give the vegetable to the cooks, and Harry turns to Draco.
Harry smiles back at him and puts his hand on Draco’s knee. “Well, she is really passionate.”
Draco holds out his mug. From downstairs, the cries of children are already coming to them.
“Well, good enough.”
“So here we only have simple courtyards and parks, you know, for the generic playing and running. We might do something else with it one day, but for now it’s good as it is. It’s nice to have space, you know? Just for… having fun.”
“Thank you,” Draco nods.
“So we are friends?” Draco asks, way more softly than he would have liked.
“Harry, look at my shirt! It has a red car on it!”
“Can I come in?” Draco asks before second-guessing himself.
“Oh, by the way, I’ll be in London next week, for this fundraiser thing I told you about. I’ll be there a couple of days. Would you like to… go for drinks?” His smile is wide enough to show his true meaning.
“And what, you just became a Savior of kids?”
“I’m glad you could make it,” Harry smiles as he hugs Draco in front of the Three Broomsticks. “I thought you would have other plans.”
Draco shakes his head. Is this about a confidentiality breach? “No. He didn’t name names.”
“Yes, Ginny is always very generous. Okay, kids,” Harry adds in a loud voice. “Remember the rules: no running, no swearing, no leaving your seat without the company of one of us adults, and, what’s the last one?”
Harry smiles. “Except you.”
Draco laughs as he grabs his wand back. “Nox.”
Hermione raises her eyebrows. “Harry, you don’t do casual.”
“Harry! What the fuck are you doing, we need you!”
Draco doesn’t know where Potter is dragging him, but they’re stopped on the way by a lot of people who want a word with the Boy Who Lived. He indulges them all, though keeps it quick by pretending “urgent matters” expect him.
“May the best man win,” Potter says.
He is stopped at the bottom of the stairs when he hears his name through an open door.
“And you,” Draco asks. “Are you living your dream life?”
“Because it was the most important.”
“Well, I did,” Harry shrugs, because yes, that was exactly what he was expecting – no, hoping.
They still chat lightly as they finish their drink, and Draco eventually looks at his watch – shiny, unshattered, expensive probably – and declares he should be heading back.
Thank you all for reading, i hope you enjoyed it and that it brought you joy (and other feels).
I would like to profusedly thank Taylor Swift's "Evermore" and "Folklore" and Maren Morris' "Girl" for prividing basically all of the soundtrack used for writing this. No idea what it was in country pop that helped me writing but hey, whatever works.
“That’s not a quidditch tournament, Potter, that’s a disaster.”
, Potter,” Draco hisses. “Not this… whatever this is,” he gestures vaguely toward the field.
“Make yourself comfortable,” Potter says as he moves in front of him to take the clothes and parchment off the desk chair. “I won’t be long.”
But then they emerge at the top of the bleachers, and Draco has to stop to take in the view.
All these public demonstration of affection are still very alien to him, and he’s still afraid he’s going to get booed every time he gets too close to Harry, but, sometimes, he pushes through his fears. So far, no one has chastised him for it.
“There is something in the power of blood,” Draco nods.
“Harry! Can we play quidditch this afternoon? You said when the weather was good enough we’d have a real match. The weather is good enough, right?”
“If you don’t like the game you can sit it out.”
“Harry asked me to give you this when I saw you. He said he’s been trying to reach you, but that you wouldn’t answer neither his owls nor his floo messages, so this was the only way he thought to get your things back to you. He also told me to tell you there’s a note in it, but that you don’t have to read it if you don’t want to.”
Draco doesn’t know what to do with Potter’s owl. It contains a barely legible manuscript note with the time and place of the game, and even a smiley face at the end of the sentence “see you there, I hope!” Does he want to go? Yes. Should he go? Probably not. He will either explode at Potter for not telling him the truth about the orphanage, or one look at his smile will suffice to have all of his anger collapse. He doesn’t want either of these scenarios to happen.
“Anytime,” she nods.
“This sounds very much like judgement to me,” Harry mumbles, putting some pie in his mouth.
Potter takes his hand on his knee and squeezes it. “Happy birthday, Draco,” he says with a wild smile.
“I’ll be honest with you,” Draco says. “After last time, I went digging through all of the ministry’s reports and files about the place.”
She nods toward the table next to the fireplace. “You’ve got a visitor, lovely.”
When he comes back, Potter has finished his piece of toast and is now holding a steaming mug in both of his hands.
Harry shrugs. “It was almost fifteen years ago. There’s no need in being angry now. I’m fine. Everything’s fine.”
“In this circumstance, it is! Amantha, tell her.”
, and he more than crossed it.
, he wants to say.
“Hey, Draco!” Harry waves as he spots him in the hall through the dining hall’s open door.
With a whiff of manure, he’s gone to the closet where he seems to pick up a random assortment of clothes. He then disappears through a door that closes behind him and that Draco assumes leads to the bathroom, as the sound of running water is soon heard.
The enthusiasm of the kids around him helps. They may not understand the subtleties of the game, but they sure are wild supporters.
“Always,” Harry laughs before walking toward the centre of the field.
“Well, Ron and Hermione know, obviously. And Snape and Dumbledore used to, but they almost took that to the grave with them. And… you, now. But that’s it. And I don’t want anyone else to know. Ever. Some things must die with me.”
“That’s what led him to the orphanage,” Draco says, for lack of anything better, as he’s still trying to understand what she’s telling him.
“Work, mostly. Nothing really exciting, you know.”
“Try carrying twelve broomsticks,” Harry yells back.
“We’re not together, it’s just casual, and that’s precisely why I don’t want you to tell anyone.”
“To the Harpies,” Potter says once she’s gone, raising his glass.
“Alright. I must meet with Padma when I’m done outside, so we can meet after in the entrance hall.”
And no one –
“Hi.” Harry is too stunned to say anything else. He blinks because of the sun, then brings his soil-covered hand to his forehead to protect his eyes. Flecks of dirt stick to his glasses. “I didn’t know you were coming today,” he says as he gets up.
“For everyone.”
Is he being ironic? Or trying to make him admit to child labour? Harry knows he has to choose his next words carefully, but he’s never been really good at that.
Leaving the stadium is even more of a nightmare than entering it. Everyone is so much more excited, including the kids, who apparently cannot stay in row.
“Happy birthday.”
Harry, smiles, relieved. “Good. Then you should come.”
“Yes.” Suddenly, Draco can’t wait to leave this room, that now seems too stuffy for him to fit in it.
“Guys, this is Dora and Charlotte, and they’re thinking about putting their daughter Carla, who is seven, in this school. Could you please tell them a bit about your days, so they know what they can expect for Carla?”
“Not for now, that’s perfect,” says Harry as he catches the ketchup bottle, already salivating.
“Thanks, then! You can join us later if you want.”
“You can call me nemesis,” Draco says. “And how can I call you?”
“So,” he finally asks, unsure of where they stand. “What’s the plan, now?”
’s top 10 most eligible bachelor’s list since the end of the war, if he’s embarrassed about that, he’s probably the only person alive in that case. But, fine,” she adds as she sees his look, “Your secret is safe with me, don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone.”
He turns around to see him leaning – and almost falling – toward his desk chair, the bread in his mouth, before sending him a pack of clothes over the bed. Draco thanks him with a nod and digs up his underwear before putting it on as quick as he can. Putting on his buttoned-up shirt feels like too much work, so he just stands up awkwardly and walks to the bathroom without looking back at Potter.
“He’s such a…” she hisses, before shaking her head and leaning forward, staring at him. “Okay, what I’m going to say is off the record, and it doesn’t leave this room. I do not tell you that for the ministry’s benefits, just to warn you to take everything Harry says about the workings of this place with a pinch of salt.”
“Anyway, it doesn’t matter, because it’s just casual.”
He gets up and, waving the bag, says: “Thanks.”
“I’m getting there. But you have to swear that you won’t judge, and that you won’t tell anyone.” Hermione opens her mouth while leaning toward him, and he rolls his eyes. “I’m fine, I swear, I am not in any kind of trouble, and nothing’s wrong. Do you swear?”
Harry stops between his legs and stares down at him.
“Are you insinuating that I don’t have friends?”
Harry joins Draco and puts his hand on his lower back. “Sorry about all that. Is this too much? If this is too much, you can leave, you know. I won’t blame you.”
“What did you play? I’m a chaser!”
“You wanna continue?”
Draco nods without looking at him. “Sounds nice.”
“It better be!”
He just wants to understand Potter.
Inside the building, he gives Draco a tour of the dormitories, classes, common rooms, and even the administrative wings, going
Draco is too stunned to say anything else than: “He must be really rich.”
He then seems to notice he’s still holding Draco and lets go of him, running his hand through his hair with another awkward laugh.
Harry laughs. “Sorry, I’m on breakfast duties. This is a place with children and they will not accept the excuse of a handsome man in my bed if they’re denied food. But I’ll try my best to be quick.” Is eyes fall on their joined hands and he whispers “Oh shit.”
Draco is awake the next morning by a rustling sound next to him. He rolls onto his side, feeling the sunlight on his eyelids before opening them. He blinks a few times before discerning Harry’s silhouette as he’s closing his jeans’ buttons. He’s already wearing a red t-shirt that gives a glimpse of his tattoos under the sleeves.
Andromeda laughs and her hands drop from Draco’s shoulders. “Just saying you’ve been very selfish about your boy there.”
“Okay. See you around, then?”
“Thanks.”
“If I win,” Draco says in a low growl, “I want you to admit I always was a better player than you.”
“I forgave,” Harry says with determination, turning back to him. “I did not forget.”
“I promise I won’t say anything,” Draco smirks. Harry smiles back.
“Yeah, sorry, Katie, we were in the garden.”
“Oh, I will. You what?”
“There’s two of them. Are you planning on coming with me?”
“What prophecy?” Draco interrupts.
Draco keeps staring at him. “The best years? Didn’t you almost get killed basically every year you spent there?”
He is more than alright.
“That’s the least you could say.”
“They don’t give a fuck who I am,” Potter answers without batting an eye. He then seems to recoil as he reconsiders, and adds, while pushing his hair over his forehead in a subconscious gesture: “I mean, most adults in the wizarding world know who I am and already have an opinion about me and who I must be. That’s tiring, sometimes, because I always feel like something expected from me but I don’t know what. Kids don’t care. To them, I’m only Harry, an old dude like any old dude. What they expect from me is quidditch games and compliments over whatever they do. That’s easy to provide.” He has another awkward smile to Draco, as if to apologize.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter locks behind them and, as they go down the stairs, Draco asks, as casually as he can manage:
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to…”
“Good. Will you need to come back or is your inspection finished?”
Harry smiles at him and pats his head. “I’d love to. Let me grab some food and I’ll join you.”
Charlotte, the muggle, seems a bit distraught, but Dora sits down opposite to Nina and says: “Really? I was a beater too in Hogwarts!”
Harry feels Draco seething next to him and leans on his shoulder with his elbow. “You know she’s all talk, right?” He whispers to him.
He knows this was not his original plan with Draco, but he left a word with Rosmerta for him to join them, hoping Draco might enjoy this too.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s really happy Draco’s here, but he must admit he’s a bit worried about everyone else’s reaction. The were all pretty cool when he told them, but there’s a difference between knowing and seeing.
Draco sits and they go through paperwork and administrative details, even if his mind is circling back to the same thing. He knows he shouldn’t ask but, at the ends, it burns his tongue so much he does anyway.
A few seconds later, he finds the envelop and turns back to him.
She pauses as she puts down her bag on her desk. “Harry told you that?” she asks seriously.
He feels Draco’s hands grabbing his as he turns away. “Harry. Look at me.”
“Harry, can we go say hi to Ginny?” asks the foul-mouthed Nina.
Charlotte, slightly less stressed after talking to the kids, answers very politely while Harry tries to calm a still overly excited Nina.
“I’m sorry,
“You don’t win by flying around aimlessly,” he shoots back.
“You know, Potter, winning is going to be a lot less fun if you don’t even play,” Draco says as he flies past him.
“I can’t fathom why you would choose to hang out with children.”
“Well, happy birthday.” He leans toward Draco, his hand on his thigh, and kisses his neck.
“But how—”
And it gets even worse when Potter adds: “Your mother didn’t tell you about that?”
He soon focuses on the game at hand, keeping an eye on the players while looking for that golden glimmer that will lead him to victory. The exercise is familiar, and he keeps tabs of the score at the back of his head, circling the field at different heights, watching nowhere and everywhere at once. He also keeps an eye on bludgers, would one fly his way, and on Draco, in case he would see something.
“What?” Harry jokes. “Looking for a way to tear us apart?”
Draco pulls out his want and points it toward it. “Collaporta.” The door closes and locks. “Now, take off that shirt.”
Ginny shrugs. “No idea. No one else said anything, but I’m pretty sure some people have hunches about it. Why, you don’t want people to know? No one would care, you know. I know I don’t. You can date and fuck whoever you want, Harry.”
“Well,” Harry turns away again, “She’s the reason I’m still alive. After Voldemort killed me – or, rather, killed the part of himself in me –, we were both out I don’t know for how long, and when he woke up he asked your mother to check if I was still alive, and I was, but she asked if you were alive, so I said yes, and she told him I was dead. If she hadn’t lied to him, I would probably have really ended dead. So it’s actually you who are the reason I’m alive, I guess.” There he is again with that smile.
. They’re all here today because of him. But he quickly stops himself. No.
“But it did matter then!” Draco erupts. “Why do you—”
I clearly didn't invent hot water with this story, but it was fun to write and i enjoyed it anyway, so i hope you do too.
“Yeah, I can’t be trusted, I guess. Come on, all the best seats are gonna be taken if we wait.”
And when he’s laying naked in Potter’s bed, later that night, he is still very much alright.
“Hey, boys, nice to see you,” Rosmerta says as she puts their usual butterbeers and fries between them. “It’s been a while since we hadn’t seen that boyfriend of your, Harry, I started thinking he dumped your ass.”
“What are you saying about me?” Harry yells from the other side of the table.
“That’s one way to put it,” Draco answers as he leans into the touch.
Harry laughs and reaches to grab his hand before Draco can stop him.
Padma frowns. “Don’t say that. Harry has always been ready to do what needed to be done, even when he disliked it.”
“Yes, Nina, it’s true.”
“I didn’t know one could joke about their own parents.”
“So, how did the tour go? Dora, Charlotte, did you like what you saw?”
“Actually, can we have another round of butterbeers?” Draco asks.
“Sorry about that,” Harry winces. “But it was sweet of you to let her call you that. You don’t have to, though. Technically, you’re not even
“This is not a petty Hogwarts rivalry. This is a ministry inspection.”
Draco looks up at the kids behind Harry, who turns too. A handful of children are flying haphazardly around the pitch, and half the balls are abandoned on the floor. In the middle of that, Ginny is hanging upside down, Debbie and Nina flying around her and shrieking with laughter. The kids not on brooms are standing or running in the bleachers, barely controlled by the adults present.
“He does seem to spend an awful lot of time around children.”
“So, what would it be? Your dream job, I mean?”
A few minutes later, he finds himself seated in the middle of a gang of seven to nine-years-old, barely able to swallow a bite in between their relentless questions.
“Harry?”
“Good to see you too. The place looks amazing.”
Potter turns as he walks away, pointing both guns fingers at her.
“I wouldn’t do that to you, don’t worry,” he whispers before going in search of the second shoe.
She effortlessly climbs back on her broom and lowers herself closer to him. “What do you have in mind? Hey, Draco, good to see you.”
“Do you want to come in for lunch?” Harry asks. “It’s veggie lasagna today.”
Draco raises his eyebrows while taking a sip of his second butterbeer.
“That’s unfair!”
“Harry, how long does a hippogriff live? You said you knew one who was twenty years-old, but Dan doesn’t believe me.”
“Yeah, sure, the weather is good enough,” Harry laughs as he shakes the boy that has attached himself to his arm. “I’ll go check the field to make sure it’s okay, and if it is we’ll have a real mach after lunch, alright, Dan?”
Draco adopts the same strategy, though a few yards away.
“What?” Harry pauses, then laughs. “No, of course not.” He laughs again, as if the idea in itself was so preposterous it became funny. “No, Ginny and I haven’t been in love with each other since the war. We’re just really good friends, now. And, regardless of all that, she’s a brilliant seeker.”
“Harry, can we play with a real speed snitch today?”
“I’m gonna start to believe you really don’t have any friends,” Potter says as he climbs the stairs behind Draco.
The woman stands in front of them, fists on her hips, familiar though Draco can’t place her.
“Yes,” answers Draco without any hesitation. “And you, would you?”
Draco seems unmoved by this question, but he briefly frowns. “I don’t know. I…” He sighs, almost as if defeated.
“Thanks,” he sighs, relieved.
“I was a Slytherin.”
“Yeah, Padma and professor Flitwick created it together. They’re not as strong as Hogwarts’, obviously, but still enough for what we have here. I mean, we’re also protected by Hogsmeade general defences, so it wasn’t necessary to come off too strong.”
“Potter,” he salutes him when Harry joins him.
He nods, but again, Potter barely seems to notice it.
“No offense to you, but I’ll catch the snitch in half a second and that wouldn’t be an interesting match for anyone.”
“Well, I was hoping you’d take me.”
“I guessed that, yeah. Matty’s clothes seem bad enough to throw away.”
Harry laughs. “It can be, I guess. I think I could choose that too.”
“I fucking hate you, Potter.”
“Dick is not a swear word!”
“Good morning, Hermione.”
“Are you still in love with her?” Draco asks without thinking.
“You think I’m sophisticated?” Draco teases.
The boy turns towards the closest table and rises both of his thumbs in the air, creating an eruption of joyous cries in his audience. He then turns back to Harry and asks: “Come have breakfast with us, please?”
“Are you allowed to say hi to your nemesis?” Debbie asks with a frown.
Draco takes back his mug. “Lunch with my mother. Why?”
“Beats anything else I’ve ever done.” Potter’s tone is sharp and, from it, Draco half expects him to draw his wand and challenge him to a duel. “And you know what? I’m proud of what we’ve done, and my life has more meaning than it ever did. Can you say the same about yours?”
That’s right. Living in London, he’s probably used to higher standard places than the Three Broomsticks. He probably doesn’t even usually eat any of this greasy pub food. Harry feels ashamed of his battered-up jeans, his sweater knitted by Mrs. Weasley and his habits at a local town pub. Draco is wearing a suit again – a dark blue one, this time – and everything in his attitude shows that he would probably much rather be anywhere but here, at this dimly-lit table, eating fries, with a Harry Potter that probably lost all of his polishing with his previous outburst – outbursts.
She laughs and flies up, whistling much louder than Harry to get everyone, kids included, to quiet down. “Listen up, everyone! Children, this has been fun, but now it’s time for the real deal. I want you all to go to the seats, you’re about to see a real lesson in quidditch today. Adults, you’re all invited to the pitch for a revival of the most classic of matches: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.”
She’s still looking at him, and Draco knows he has to unfreeze and say something. “You mean… his fundraising?”
“Everyone? What about you?”
Harry waves his remarks away. Actually, he was expecting a lot worse from Ron, but also from Hermione. This is good. He can work with this.
“What? No! I mean, if you like quidditch, you should come. We always have spare tickets. You still like quidditch, right?”
“Come on, Harry,” she sighs. “You’ve been here for almost two days, this is only the second meal we’re taking together, and—” she continues, as he opens his mouth to retort, “We know Neville is staying at your place and he says he’s barely seen you and your bed is still unmade. So, where have you been? Are you ok?”
Harry nods, thinking about his few past relationships. There’s some truth in that, even if he never really saw it himself.
She stares at him as he takes the bag, his mind suddenly blank. What the fuck is Potter playing at?
for that.”
“No, but what they say do have an influence on what people think. Honestly, now I only have a subscription so I can know what they say, not what actually happens. I have
Ignoring the constant reproaches in his tone, Harry answers:
Draco stays silent a couple of seconds before answering.
“It still is,” Draco admits quietly, though he doesn’t really know why. Why he would say that kind of things to Potter. “I guess it always will be.”
They exchange another look.
“Harry asked us not to say anything to anyone,” she adds, still staring at him, “because he was convinced you wouldn’t want that.” She lets a silence in and, seeing him answer nothing, she continues. “Look, if you don’t want to be with Harry for whatever reason, that’s entirely up to you. But if you like him even a little bit, maybe you should read that note he left you. Anyway, it’s not my place to tell you what to do, and you’re a grown man, so you can also just ignore everything I said and do what you want.”
“It was for me,” Harry says softly. He quickly glances at Draco, who seems surprised, and adds: “I don’t tell them that, because they need to discover some of the magic themselves, but yeah, the hat told me I’d do good in Slytherin, but I didn’t want to because I was a kid that didn’t know shit and thought Slytherin was evil, so I ended up in Gryffindor.” Draco seems dumbstruck, so Harry laughs. “Yeah right, can you imagine me in Slytherin? I didn’t have any of the qualities required. Dan, pass the quaffle!”
“Something came up.”
Potter is talking and laughing with some people Draco recognizes as high-ranking ministry workers, including the minister himself. From where he’s standing with Padma, Draco has no idea what Potter is saying, but everyone seems fascinated by it, and Draco totally understands them.
“Embarrassed why? Because he’s fucking you?” She shakes her head. “Come on, Harry, you’ve been on
Draco rolls his eyes.
“Potter paid for your wedding?”
built all this. Together. Maybe he was the impulsion, but this isn’t his alone. This place, this day, it exists because of all of them. And he feels insanely proud of them all.
“It’s partly true, obviously. The independence thing is something he’s quite set on, and that the administrative board agreed on. We all saw what Hogwarts became in time of crisis, when Dumbledore was gone, and we don’t want that to happen to this school and orphanage should Harry, or any of its protector, disappear. But did he really say
“It was needed, I guess.”
He doesn’t wait for Draco’s response and goes up flying as he notices Nina hitting someone from the other team with her bat.
“Look, Harry, she’s diving!” Matty says as he points at her.
Draco shakes his head. “No. It’s fine. I was just surprised.”
Harry grabs a t-shirt and starts to pull it over his head when, without premeditation, Draco says: “Come here.”
He has no time to hear Draco’s further thoughts on the subject as he spends the rest of the match supervising the action and breaking fights. The whole thing is messy, shows no trace of strategy, and, sometimes, the only thing stopping the kids from hurting themselves is the enchantments he set up, but he absolutely loves it – and so do the children. Their reactions when the snitch is caught make it seem like the world cup was at stake, and he wholeheartedly congratulates every single one of them on their performance.
“Harry!” sounds a voice as they approach the bathroom. “Were you the one who brought them back in this state?”
“What house were you in, Draco?” asks Nina.
“I actually did, once,” Harry says without thinking, regretting it as soon as it lingers in the silence that follows. He lays motionless, hoping the sentence actually flew past Draco and that he’s just silent because he’s lost in some daydream about his own time in Hogwarts.
“You do have a lot of tattoos,” he comments. His tone isn’t judgemental, just curious.
“Oh, alright, then.” Potter looks toward the window. Is he disappointed? He turns back to Draco. “At what time do you have to be there? I mean… Do you still have an hour to spare, or…?”
“Anyway, as the sorting hat always said, the houses are stronger united than divided, and that’s the spirit we try to give them. Debbie, don’t provoke Nina! You know how it ends! The truth is, I don’t care which house they end up in, but some of them do actually show stronger traits that makes it quite obvious. Debbie, what did I just say!”
Even when Potter laughs when Draco asks him if he really did show his snake tattoo as the match started in hope to make him lose his concentration.
“I know. I was there. That doesn’t mean you deserve to be blamed all your life for something you did at sixteen. Do you regret it? If you could go back in time, would you change what you did?”
“I did some bad things, you know. I deserve some of the blame.”
Harry sees Draco shake it, and his attention is diverted by Rose, pulling on the tablecloth. “Hold on, Rosie, I’ll show you what you can do to help,” He says, grabbing the cloth before all the glasses shatter to the floor – again.
Or maybe, did Draco think that Harry’s distrust with the ministry is related to him, and people like him, working there? Because that’s not the case. Harry is all for redemption. He temperates his speech. “It’s not that I don’t trust the ministry right now. Because I do. If I was certain it would stay as it is, I would have no problem with it. But the thing is, we never know. I don’t want the ministry to control us in any way, financially or other. The school and orphanage must remain a free, independent institution. I am happy to respect regulations, and grateful for support, in a give-give relationship, but raising kids shouldn’t be submitted to the whims of the current minister. It should be a right and a duty, now and forever, no matter who holds power.”
Draco must feel his reluctance, because he doesn’t press the subject. Instead, he comes snuggle closer to Harry and runs his hand over his chest and shoulder.
Of course, Draco knows of the place. The Tonks and Lupin school and orphanage has been the talk of the wizarding world since it was founded in Hogsmeade about a decade ago. How Harry and Andromeda had founded the place to raise the war orphans who couldn’t be taken in by relatives, how it had gradually grown to welcome any children that needed it, then developed into a school for wizard kids who weren’t always orphans, and not yet of age for Hogwarts. As the number of children had expanded, so had the team and the building. What was once a family business in a tiny Hogsmeade house was now a well run institution with consequent staff and a luminous building on the edge of town with enough fields around to have ten times the current number of children running around. Though it was known that Potter was at the origin of the project, he had declined the role of headmaster when the place grew bigger, preferring, in his own words, to “leave the role to someone actually competent for that.”
“Hey, I do other things!” Harry protests, but he can see Draco’s smile as they take place at their usual table. “But hey, if you’re around at that time, I’m having a birthday party at my house in London on the 31
“I can start now,” Harry pouts. “But I want to go back to what you said earlier about it making sense,” he says to Hermione. “Why? It doesn’t make sense even to me.”
“Look at us. Seems like we can’t help but reminisce.”
“Sorry for keeping you so late. You apparate straight back in London?”
“No,” says Amantha before turning back.
Harry waves at Rosmerta as he enters the pub, and signals two with his hand as she nods at him. He leads Draco toward a table near the fireplace, and, an old habit, sits facing the door. The room is far from full, even if a few groups and lonesome patrons are handing around here and there. A few regulars nod at Harry as he walks by them, and he nods back.
Harry rolls on his back. This wasn’t the conversation he planned to have at that moment. “Not anymore,” he simply says.
“Hey team,” he says as he approaches a table, “can I bother you for a minute?”
Draco smiles. “It’s alright. Nemesis is a nice word.”
Harry squeezes his hand and winks at him. “I’ll accept that as a compliment. Always a pleasure playing against you, Draco.”
He laughs.
say that you
Draco isn’t exactly mad about losing. Sure, he didn’t enjoy it, but that’s not the point. The point is, he’s mad at Potter for always pulling him into his fucking schemes, whether it be fundraiser events or quidditch games or whatever, and mad at himself for always falling into it. He’s mad at Potter for looking so handsome when he laughs, so graceful when he flies, for smiling so wide when he looks at him, and for acting so comfortable surrounded by his friends. But, most of all, he’s mad at himself for loving all that about him, so much it makes his heart ache. He really put himself in a huge fucking mess, didn’t he?
“Thanks for handling the kids, Katie. Next butterbeer’s on me.”
“You’re ready to go?” he asks as he puts it on, entangling his glasses over the neck.
Harry laughs and Draco has to blink.
“No offense to you, but you wouldn’t play seeker.”
“And what does he do here, exactly? Besides giving tours and teaching quidditch.”
He stops before going too far.
Draco wants to tell him he looks glorious, but instead he says: “And I look like a sophisticated drunkard, I guess?”
There’s no need in going after him and making him more of an issue than he already is.
Draco is already hard at work casting spells when he feels Potter coming back. He doesn’t look at him, because he is focused now and doesn’t need any reminder of how Potter looked earlier on the quidditch field. Yet, the tension of feeling him lurking around soon becomes to strong and, still without turning to him, says:
“Wanna come with me?”
He finishes his coffee in one gulp with a panicked look to the door, then sits next to Draco, thigh against thigh, to put on his shoes.
Even if, now, he’s nervous for entirely different reasons.
Looking a bit awkward, Draco leans forward and shakes her hand. “Hi, Rose. I’m Draco Malfoy.”
“Excluding Harry, apparently,” Draco mutters.
Harry turns and finally sees Draco, and his face has this weird reaction between a wince and a smile. “Oh.” He puts away his wand and runs his hand through his hair. “Sorry for, uh, causing a commotion,” he says to Rosmerta.
“How do you know?” Draco asks – his tone isn’t exactly cold, but it isn’t warm either.
“Is it Granger who put these ideas in your head, or did you put them in hers?” Draco is still smiling as he takes a sip.
“I mean, it makes sense, in a way,” Hermione says.
– with Draco. That would be nice to keep it that way.
“Oh, alright. Go on,” Harry invites him, without letting go of his hand.
Harry sighs and look away, his throat dry. “Yes.”
Draco nods. “Yes. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a game.”
Draco nods with a frown before turning and leaving. Harry’s eyes follow him to the glass door, until, on the other side, he disappears with a faint
“The Harpies scored again,” Dan interrupts him.
“What?” Harry says before laughing nervously. “No, Draco isn’t my boyfriend, we’re just friends! I could never get someone like him, can’t you see?” he adds, hoping to put this conversation behind them as a joke.
She yells and puts her fist in the air, and he continues with a smile:
prudent to travel. Who knows what you would leave behind?”
The way he leaves the word trailing forces Draco to look up. The wind in Potter’s hair doesn’t help. At all.
“Alright,” Draco concedes.
He raises his arms, crossing them inside the hoop to put his chin on it, and his belly briefly shows, as well as the hint of a tattoo on his shoulder
There is indeed a strong smell coming from Potter, but Draco had barely noticed it until now, hidden by the high-pitched voices of the children and the dishevelled general appearance of Harry.
As he gets out of the bathroom, drying his hair, Draco snarls:
Except for Debbie and Adam, standing next to the trunk, all of the kids have retreated to the seats and seem very eager to see things unfold. Draco has never seen them this calm. He finds it almost scary.
“I know you’re not on that level anymore, but how do you feel about a good old Slytherin versus Gryffindor?”
He already knows the answer will be yes. Any other plans that might form in between now and then will come second to this.
Draco shakes his head then points his arm forward, indicating him to lead the way.
“So this is your home?”
Harry must flinch, or physically react in some way, because Dram immediately asks:
“Sorry,” Harry says to shorten his awkwardness. “I shouldn’t keep you here when you have work to do. I’ll owl you the details if you want, and you can let me know then if you can make it.”
He focuses on the coffee to stop his mind from going in full analytical mode. Now is not the time.
“Though you’re about twenty years late, Potter, I want it remembered that I asked you that before,” he says to break the moment.
As soon as they’re alone, he asks, before getting cold feet: “Is it true that Potter basically singlehandedly finances his whole orphanage and school?”
“I have a house in London,” Potter answers, putting on his socks.
Harry laughs and, closing the gap, kisses him. “Good,” he whispers as he briefly leans back, “because I like you too.”
“And you? What did you do, this week?”
“It’s okay, Ron showed me how to—”
“Well, that’s a very good word, and perfectly used. Go on, kid, stop bothering Draco and go to the bathroom with everyone else. Matty! No lingering! Don’t touch the leaflets!” He sigh and mutters “for fuck’s sake” as he walks toward a tiny boy with dark curly hair who’s holding a handful of leaflets about the school from a nearby table.
“To the Harpies,” Draco says back.
Harry leans forward and kisses him. He doesn’t tell Draco he already does own him.
Padma swiftly laces her arm through his and guides him through the room, telling him about the different events planned tonight and stopping from time to time to talk with some – probably important – people. She always introduces him as “Draco, who works at the ministry,” and everyone nods politely at him, some even shaking his hand and asking “how do you do?” And, despite doing his best being attentive to what Padma is saying and showing, he can’t help but look for Potter in the crowd. When he spots him, he has to do a double take.
you. You can lie to everyone else, you can even lie to yourself, but you can’t lie to me.”
This is a lot of information for Draco to process all at once. He thought, after his own experience, after living under the same roof as the Voldemort, after being there at Hogwarts and at the battle, that he had a pretty good understanding of what happened. But turns out he didn’t know anything. No one knew anything.
“Between us, and off the record? Harry should have been headmaster. But he didn’t want the job. So he agreed on doing the whole public figure thing, defending the interests of the institution in face of the ministry and the general wizarding population, even if he would rather not, and I took on the more administrative side of things, which always bore him anyway. In exchange, he gets to keep doing what he likes, which is hanging out with the kids, playing quidditch and telling us about his ideas. And he’s good at it, so it’s a win-win situation.”
“Harry says I’m going to be a Slytherin,” says the tiny black boy in a small voice.
The return through portkeys is a chaotic game of herding cats, but they eventually all make it back to the school’s grounds in one piece.
Draco nods. Old wizard families certainly have means.
“What?”
He grabs hold of Draco’s wrist and walks even faster.
Dread falls onto Harry’s stomach. “Does everybody know?”
“So you offered to entertain me if no one else did.”
“Sorry about that,” he smiles.
“I know you. I’ve even
“Your social education is lacking, clearly. I’ll teach you that, you’ll teach me about presents, alright?” Potter winks.
“Brilliant, isn’t it?”
It’s harder to focus like that, but Draco finds the strength somewhere in him. He knows he
He starts walking very quickly and Draco has no choice but to follow.
But now, it’s Friday, he hasn’t heard from him, and he’s starting to regret not making it clearer that he wanted to see him again. At least, he would have known where to stand.
Draco nods.
“Harry told you that?”
“Alright!” Ginny yells. “Everyone in position. Captains, shake hands. On the count of three, Debbie, open the trunk.”
Harry sighs and keeps walking down. The light in the stairwell goes out again.
“Could you come in? It won’t be long.” She invites him into her office, and he has no choice but to follow.
So here he is, alone, wearing a pretty fine suit – though not his best, he doesn’t want Potter to believe he put too much effort into this –, not knowing exactly what to expect or with who he’ll be able to have a conversation here.
He sees Draco’s eyes going down on his body, and himself looks down at his knees. His jeans are good for a nice wash. He winces.
“Still. It doesn’t mean his loss was any less painful to you.”
Draco’s throat is all dried up, and he clears it before asking, frozen: “Are you serious?”
Harry leans forward, hands wrapped around his glass. “I’m not asking if you like what you do. I’m talking about dreams. Is there something you’d like to do? It doesn’t even have to be a job,” he waves. “It could be, I don’t know, travelling, or getting a dog, or whatever. If you could do anything in the world, what would it be?”
Draco turns with what he hopes is a look of disdain, but is probably closer to wonder.
Draco has to look away. If Harry keeps looking a him like that while saying that kind of things, Draco will forget all of his speech before he has even started.
Somehow, the conversation started being easier once they started having sex. Harry still doesn’t know where they stand exactly, but at least it’s somewhere beyond the polite, professional realm. In a place where they can have sex and the fries, or the other way around, where they can joke and kiss naked skin, talk about the mundane events of their week and put shivers on each other’s skin with their fingertips.
Harry catches Draco’s wrist with his hand and, despite Draco’s reluctance, he raises it up. “I know. And I don’t care, Draco.” Still holding Draco’s gaze, he kisses his faded mark. “I don’t care.” He kisses it again. “This isn’t who you are anymore. Just like this—” he takes Draco’s fingers to his own forehead, tracing the lightning bolt he knows all too well “— isn’t who I am anymore.” Draco frees his hand and takes off Harry’s glasses, making the world blurry for him again. Harry lowers downs, stopping only a breath away from Draco’s open mouth. “I won’t let us be defined by the marks someone else put on us,” he growls before kissing him furiously.
“Here. Happy birthday,” he says with a smile.
Draco feels more and more uncomfortable under her scrutinous stare. Where is she getting to?
Harry leans and kisses him briefly. “Thanks for coming. Come on, help me bring the food outside.”
Draco wonders a bit what he may have done or said wrong, for Potter to suddenly want this evening to end. Was it not going as well as he thought? What has Potter decided, during these few seconds he was looking at him? His throat suddenly dry, he empties his own glass. “Yes. Let’s go.”
“Ah, yes,” laughs Padma, “Harry is always very talkative hen he’s nervous.”
Rose stares at him with a frown, then nods and extends her little hand. “Hi, I’m Rose Granger Weasley. What’s your full name?”
Draco tries very hard to focus on the game.
She laughs. “You’re the one with a commotion, my boy.”
He would have loved to give some compliments on the garden, how instructive it seems to be and how pretty it is, but, first of all, Potter is talking all the time, barely letting him put a word in and, second of all, the passion on his face as he explains everything fascinates Draco to the point of making him forget his words. People have always listened to Potter, and Draco 100% understands why. He knows how to captivate an audience, and has a form of charisma that forces attention.
“See, I told you! You’re funny!”
“And if I wanted that for Teddy, wasn’t it fair to want that too for the other war orphans? Didn’t they deserve it too? Being an orphan is shit enough as it is, they don’t need exclusion and loneliness on top of that. None of these kids will be abandoned as long as I’m here to stop it.”
He leans his head back against the wall, feeling like he missed something there.
“Yes, of course. I’m sorry, it’s just, she never…”
He actually feels relieved to not be in his company anymore. Not that it was disagreeable, but there are too many things about Potter that actually distracted him from his job. He’s been straining more and more to remain professional, but Potter’s passion about the place was somewhat contagious and he probably let a couple of emotions slip away.
“Hi, nemesis.”
Draco arches both of his eyebrow in a mocking way. “I don’t think this is anyone’s dream job. The paperwork takes most of our time, to be honest with you. But field work is enjoyable.”
Potter laughs as he leans and pushes the bed sheets. “There’s like, two dozens, at most. Who live there, I mean. Maybe a bit more in the summer.”
“Sorry, guys, I gotta run, but I’ll see you this afternoon on the pitch, alright?”
He knows the generic story, of course, like anyone else – he supposes –, but hearing it from Draco himself is different. How he ended Hogwarts with top grades, how he had to start at the bottom of the ladder anyway, how it probably took him longer than anyone else, and how his hard work and precise spellcasting eventually paid off, leading him to a more than decent position.
“Dan, what did I say about touching anything! Stop wiping your hands on Debbie!”
Draco snorts. “It’s the house that chooses you, Potter, no the other way around.”
“My…” Draco seems surprised, before catching himself up. “She’s fine. Thank you.”
Granger nods as she walks to sit behind her desk. “Yes, he told us when he was in London. But, even if he hadn’t, it was pretty obvious. Ginny guessed it within the first minute of seeing you two together and called us the next day to gossip, Padma told me the last time I ran into her that it was nice the two of you were ‘hanging out’ – yes, she did the quotation marks with her fingers –, and even old Wilhemina Vanstock asked me the other day if the young Malfoy who was with Potter at the fundraiser was his lover, because if not, she would tap that.”
Getting inebriated in front of Potter may not be a good idea, but Draco says anyway: “Yes, a firewhisky for me too, thank you.”
Draco thinks about it, then smirks. “Is time travel a valid answer?”
“Don’t tell the kids anything about that, we don’t want them becoming like me.”
Harry is stopped from arguing by a magnificent goal by the Harpies, causing the whole stadium, himself included, to erupt in a cheer.
Draco’s fingers rub his skin, leaving a shiver in their wake. “I had never heard of that before. Do you move it with your mind, or does it move on its own?”
“Anyway, this is my office, it was nice seeing you! Send Harry my best if you see him before me.”
And Draco shakes his head because, the truth is, he is alright.
“Good. So, I guess you wanted to see the documents about the protection of the place? I already have them out.”
“None of you were as good as Ginny, I’m sure, or you would play in a real team like her.”
Draco turns, nods and stop to wait for him.
Above the bed, Draco notices a small, clearly older picture. In it, a waving young couple holds a tiny, black-haired, scarless baby. Draco steps back, feeling like he intruded too far on Potter’s intimacy, and almost stumbles into the oddly placed bed. He swears and walks back to the desk, which seems a safer place. Standing there, he just takes in all of the pictures of friends, kids of all shapes and ages, people he knows and people he’s never met, all scattered on or under colourful childish drawings.
“I just thought that his couldn’t work, because well, you’re you, and I’m me, and I didn’t think you’d want to…”
“Isn’t that kind of a bullshit job?”
“Why an orphanage, Potter? Of all the things you could have done of yourself after the war, why this?”
He guesses it’s probably just how the “new Potter” is. The guy who’s supposedly amazing with children, laidback with adults, and hasn’t fought anyone or anything since he killed Voldemort.
Draco leans against the doorframe, arms crossed, staring at him. Harry takes it as an authorization to continue.
They’ve barely been sitting for a few seconds when Rosmerta appears at their side, two butterbeers in hand.
“Well, first of all,” he says as he plants his fork in the pie, “I’ve been really busy with this fundraiser.”
“Would it really kill you to say it once?” Harry’s smile is very close to him.
Draco takes the envelop carefully.
“Evening, Harry,” says Rosmerta barely a few seconds after Draco sat in front of him. “So, what did you do again?” She sets the butterbeers in front of them.
Draco rolls his eyes. “We both had questionable hobbies.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s alright. It’s all in the past, now. And can you promise not to tell anyone?” he asks, finally turning to him. He’s really glad he isn’t wearing his glasses. “No one knows, and I’d rather keep it that way.”
Harry shrugs. “A bit of both. I can put it somewhere if I want to, but if I don’t pay attention it just wanders around. Hang on.”
“I trust you,” says Draco, waving away this remark. “I just have a question.”
Draco can’t answer, as they’re surrounded by their teammates, and Harry’s gather around him for hugs and cheers. They lower down to the floor, and Debbie announces proudly: “190 to 50 for Gryffindor-Hufflepuff.”
“They’re not doing it for me. Most of them could probably have better paying jobs elsewhere, but they believe in what we do. I’m eternally grateful for that. When we started, just me and Andromeda, the whole thing was such a mess. We couldn’t have kept on like that for very long,” he laughs. “There was much more work than what we envisioned. We probably would have drowned in a couple of months if we didn’t have support coming in pretty quick.”
Barely a minute later, Draco hears applauses coming from the open door. Potter must be on stage.
“Stop putting on that shirt.”
“Yeah, but we’ve got the orphans who live at Hogwarts during the year coming back, plus we’re organizing some summer camps. We’ve got a quidditch training camp in collaboration with the Harpies! And another one focusing on magical plants. Neville said he’s got some fine specimen he brought back from the Sahara. Plus, you know, day trips to the beach or to London, plus the usual activities. Summer are actually more exhausting for us than the school year, where everything is already calibrated around class.”
Harry barges in through the door, wand in hand.
Draco shakes his head, glass in hand. “Why not. Just let me know when you’re free.”
But as Draco says nothing, just staring, for a few seconds, Harry says: “Look, we have our first cucumbers. And see, over there. The tomatoes are already growing. And the courgettes are huge. And I can’t wait to see the—”
Harry is relieved to be provided with a topic, especially one he masters so well.
“No. My mother still lives there, but I moved to London. It’s closer to work. To everything.”
Draco smiles back and Potter notices the leaflets he’s still holding.
“Come on, don’t act like you didn’t stalk me in return.”
“Not a morning person, huh? Sorry. Get back in the bed, you don’t have to talk. I don’t even have to talk, if you want some quiet.”
“But that’s it,” Draco finishes. “Some of us have jobs that aren’t about playing with kids all day.”
“And yet you still want to wake up to it every day,” Draco says before he can stop.
ramble too much about the place.
“Impressive, indeed.” He seems pensive for a few seconds, then asks: “But why a snake? I would have taken you for more of a roaring lion person.”
“A bit, maybe. But not really. It just… I just thought it was more important that I stayed with Teddy ad Andromeda that year, and that I’d go back after, when things would be easier. And then we had started the orphanage, and I thought I would go back the year after, when it was done… and I kept pushing it back and, well, I didn’t go back at all, in the end.” Harry sits up and pushes his hair back from his face. “I guess that’s it, now, I can say that I will never finish Hogwarts. I don’t need it, anyway, to do what I do.”
Harry sighs again, then gets angry at himself for feeling so down at that moment, where he should be feeling anything but that.
“Well, I didn’t have a choice, did I?”
When they leave the pub – Draco insisted about paying –, Harry turns to him, hands in his jeans’ pockets.
“It’s my old one,” he explains as Draco observes it with suspicion. “It works perfectly fine, I just bought the more recent model.”
Why is Draco not writing anything down? Is he storing it all in his head to complain about it later to Padma? Harry was supposed to make her job easier, not harder.
Harry smiles back. “I guess we’ve always been pretty bad at following rules.”
“Well, you told me,” Draco laughs. Then, after a few seconds of studying Harry, he asks: “Can I come over next week?”
Draco knows perfectly well what he would be leaving behind.
“Well, yeah, I was eighteen and depressed, I wasn’t able to conceptualize all that, but that was what I was reaching for. At first I just wanted to give Teddy a world that he would belong in, even if he was an orphan, but the theory was always hidden behind that.”
Harry laughs. “No. But we can come back to that subject afterward, though, if you want.”
Draco crosses the crowd toward them and is stopped in his progression when Nina steps right in between him and Harry.
“You fucking won,” Draco erupts, “what more do you want?”
“Where does your money comes from? You employ a lot of people, without counting all of the investments, like the new building, and ministry funding is minimal, to say the least. So, how do you finance everything?”
Debbie seems to think about it for a couple of seconds, then turns to Draco.
Draco is seething. “Fuck you, Potter.”
Harry nods too.
Usually, Draco is always very aware of the looks he attracts, of people whispering around him, or those who do a detour to avoid him. He knows it bothers whoever he may be talking to and make things awkward, but Potter doesn’t seem to care at all. In fact, he seems to be oblivious to all of their surroundings, to everything that isn’t Draco. Even the glass in his hand looks like just a prop. Being the centre of his attention, the direction of his wild smiles and the glimmer in his eyes, is very unsettling, but not in a bad way. It’s probably the alcohol, but Draco feels a warmth setting through him, and he even feels so bold as to enjoy the moment. The conversation is fun, the firewhisky tastes nice, and the company, is… well, he would rather not have to put words on it.
Draco hides in his glass, and Harry feels a bit proud of himself for that.
“I wasn’t sure you would come.”
“Still,” Draco mumbles. “That’s scarier than London.”
“You don’t live there, though,” Draco pouts as he sits next to him on the bed.
“Amantha told me I’d find you there,” Draco simply says after his shadows fall on Harry.
Draco turns briefly toward him and sees that he is, indeed, entirely serious.
Amantha’s eyes are throwing daggers at him, so he whispers to her, as they walk into the stadium: “Hey, don’t be mad, I left you with the quiet one.”
Draco raises his eyebrows, then smiles. “You need more adult supervision for this bunch?”
“There’s a t-shirt on the bed for you. It’s clean, I promise. Your outfit from yesterday isn’t exactly morning wear,” Potter smirks before taking a sip.
“So how comes you had no plans for tonight? It’s your birthday! Why don’t you have plans on your birthday?”
Draco is still staring, his lips pursed.
But, no matter what Draco tells himself about not wanting to be anyone’s dirty little secret, every time he sees Potter’s smile, or hears his voice, he thinks “just one last time.” And how many last times has it been, now?
Ginny does a quick survey of the stadium, then says: “It’s alright, we’ll do Gryffindor and Hufflepufff versus Slytherin and Ravenclaw.”
“Okay. Alright. How about, today, I’m your game buddy? And Adam can be Amantha’s game buddy? And we’ll figure something out for next time?”
Relief floods over him. “That’s too bad,” he says anyway.
“Well, I don’t know. You never mention anything about them, anyway, so how could I guess.”
“I just want to give the other team a chance to not lose horribly. Besides, I have an old feud to settle.” He points to Draco behind his shoulder.
“Okay, so,” Potter starts explaining, looking away as soon as he opens his mouth but not letting go of Draco’s hands, “I knew that Voldemort had put parts of his souls into other objects, and that they had to be destroyed if Voldemort was to die. It just turned out that, what Dumbledore didn’t tell me, is that I was one of those horcruxes – that’s the name of those things,” he adds when he quickly glances at Draco and notices his puzzled look, probably mistaking it for a question about the word and not a total bewilderment toward the actual subject they’re discussing. “So when I found out, on the night of the battle, that I had to die for it all to end, well, I did.” He stops there and stares at Draco, with that same little smile at the corner of his lips.
Draco frowns. “What are you talking about, Potter?”
“Oh, right.”
“Good for you. Harry always brings them back looking like they dug through the core of the earth.”
He turns to him and snuggles his nose into Draco’s neck, planting a kiss there. He feels Draco’s arms closing against his back. Eyes closed, he answers:
“So, you work for the safety and secrecy department?”
Somehow, it seems fitting, and yet, for some unknown reason, the sight tugs at his heartstrings.
“No need to apologize. Please, sit. So, what do you need to do today?”
“Draco!” He hears on his left and turns to see Padma, wearing a stunning green sari. She comes to him and gives him a quick one-sided hug, a smile on her lips. “I didn’t know you were coming tonight. It’s good to see you.”
Draco stops in the ministry’s corridor and internally rolls his eyes at the sound of Granger’s voice.
“I promise I’ll be nice,” she yells back.
Harry shrugs as he falls back on the mattress. “I like the place, you know. It was my first real home, and where I spent some of the best years of my life.”
Harry indicates the inside of the pub with his head. “Come on in, then. Drinks on me to celebrate.”
“But she did it first!”
Harry stares at him and can’t help smiling. “Yeah. Thanks for coming.” He must admit, he is surprised that, after everything he dumped on him the other time, Draco still wants to hang out with him and doesn’t seem to consider him any differently. They haven’t mentioned it since, and Harry is all the happier about it, but he can’t help fearing that it will all come to hit him in the back at some point.
Harry puts his arm around Draco’s shoulder and turns with him toward the pitch. It truly
When they leave the bar, Draco doesn’t wait for his invitation to follow him. In the almost dark of Scottish summer nights, Harry grabs his hand. Draco doesn’t stop him.
“Draco, wait!” Harry yells, shooting after him. “Rosmerta, I swear I’ll pay next time, put this on my bill,” he says as he passes the counter.
“Look, Harry, look, I can fit half an orange into my mouth!”
When he turns to Draco, he catches a smile on his lips, and smiles back as their eyes meet.
Draco seems to take in their surroundings with some sort of disgust, then answers.
“Don’t make me repeat it.”
“You’ll tell me again tomorrow! Love you!”
“I won’t tell anyone, okay? I promise. I swear… on my mother’s life. No one else will know. But… can you tell me? I just… you… fucking hell, Harry, you
Draco seems taken aback by the offer, but ends up nodding anyway.
Through the blurriness of his natural vision, he sees Draco turn to him. “Really, Potter? Hogwarts is why you live like a wild animal?”
The children’s cries slowly disappear between them as they walk to the Three Broomsticks, but Potter himself can’t seem to be able to shut up about the game. Granted, it was a good game, a really good one, and Draco doesn’t mind hearing him talk at all. But, further away from the crowd, the noise and the excitement, Draco is slowly touching back down with reality.
They keep talking about the game – mostly Potter, but Draco joins in once the firewhisky starts kicking in – while the fries and the drinks come and go. Draco is surprised at how easy talking to him actually is, considering they spent most of their youth hating each other. Maybe it’s the firewhisky helping, but here, in this noisy pub, eating fries with his hands and facing Harry Potter, Draco is actually feeling more relaxed than he did in a long time – than he ever did, maybe. Strangely, for once, he doesn’t feel self-conscious at all. Maybe it’s because Potter himself seems to have no knowledge of the word or its meaning, with his tee-shirt that has holes on the collar and is probably two sizes too big, his hair that is getting all over the way for all the times he puts his hand in it, or his unashamed laughs.
Harry’s smile lights up the whole room.
“You’ll thank me when we finally get those tomatoes!”
Draco shakes his head, still slightly smiling. Harry feels like he’s being mocked, so he goes on.
Draco’s fingers briefly touch Harry’s and he makes the pot of cream, emptying half of it into his mug. He feels Potter’s stare on him all along, but doesn’t look back at him.
“Do you want to go for a drink?”
Hermione crosses her arms and leans back on her chair. She stays silent a few seconds, looking for her words. “Look, after the war, your problem with dating has been that you either met someone from the wizarding community who knew all about you and idolized you, or a muggle who knew nothing about you but with whom you couldn’t share your trauma.”
“If you want me to. I mean, you can invite anyone you want, a friend, your mother, whoever. They’re yours. Just because I got them doesn’t mean you have to take me.”
Draco nods, not knowing what else to do, and Potter smiles back at him as he holds the door for him. The sun is already rising high in the sky, and Draco blinks.
“It was great. Teddy loved it. But I’m guessing you didn’t ask Rosmerta to send me an emergency message just to see pictures from my trip.”
“You’re right,” Potter says as he raises his firewhisky. “
“Shit, I’m gonna owe a fuckton of butterbeers.”
It lasts a few minutes, until Harry spots a spark somewhere in between him and Draco. His first reflex would be to fly straight for it, but then Draco would follow right away and the run would be too tight. So, instead, he keeps an eye on it and decides to widen his circles to get closer, without catching Draco’s attention. His heart is beating fast, and the only thing that matters to him now is winning.
“Yes, that is how you great them.”
He pushes him toward the rest of the group as he wrestles the leaflets out of his grasp. He’s still holding them as he walks back to Draco.
“Is this…” Draco starts, not sure if it’s safe to continue. “Is this why you didn’t come back to Hogwarts, after the war?”
He smiles at them, and they smile back, but he doesn’t like the pity he sees in the look they exchange briefly.
“You go have your drink with your friend, Harry, we’ll handle the kids,” Amantha says.
“Now? Yeah, sure. Just, let me bring those to the kitchen and change. Hey, can you grab that basket over there?” Harry quickly wipes his knees and hands, then takes another basket. “So, what have you been up to, this week?” he asks as they start walking.
“Sorry, this was some heavy shit I dropped on you,” Harry finally whispers against his skin.
“You could have told me I had a huge smear of dirt on my forehead.”
“Alright, don’t take it out on me, I’m just saying.”
Harry turns to him, still walking. “I’ll get you one!” Then he walks to Ginny, whistling to get her attention. “Hey, Ginny, wanna play real quidditch?”
“I had the time to have a lovely chat with a tiny fellow named Matty. I believe I know his full life story, now.”
Working with Potter is one thing. Having a drink with him is an entirely different one. What will they even talk about? They have both not enough and too much in common for it to be comfortable for either of them.
“Oh shit,” Harry mumbles before adding, louder: “I’ll be right there!”
Draco sees Padma shooting daggers at him, but Potter smiles to all and excuses himself, gently pulling Draco with him. When they’re far enough, he whispers to him:
They reach the ground floor talking casually, and Potter stops at the bottom, extending his arm to hold Draco back.
“Do you play quidditch too, Draco?”
Harry goes to the counter to pay the bill, and meets him outside the door.
“That I would want what? To be with you? And why exactly, Potter, do you think I’m here, in fucking Scotland, up to three times a week?”
Harry runs out of the kitchen at the sudden sound of broken glass, and finds the glasses repairing themselves on their way to the plate under Draco’s wand.
“Yes, I heard that one already,” she laughs. “Can I get you guys anything else?”
Five minutes later, Padma show up, followed by Draco, and puts her hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco aches an eyebrow. “Did you invite me to have sex?”
“That’s some nice spellwork.”
“Look, I get that Harry can be infuriating – trust me. He’s been my best friend for twenty years, I love him to death and I would follow him to the end of the world – and you know that it’s not just a saying, I literally did. And yet, sometimes, I want to shake him so hard just to get his brains back into place, because he can be both the most brilliant person I know and the dumbest dumbass on this planet.” She smiles, and Draco can’t help but smile back. “What I mean is, I understand why you may be mad at him, and I guess you two are always gonna butt heads, whatever happens, because that’s just who you are and how you’ve always been, but if you like him, maybe you should give it a try. And, well, if you are what it takes to see my best friend happier than he’s been in fifteen years, then I’ll take it gladly, and so will everyone else around him.”
“You mean he was actually the one doing his homework in Hogwarts, not Granger?”
Potter turns to him, a glimmer in his eyes. “Oh, I’ve tried. Believe me, I’ve tried
“I’m leaving every door open, Hermione! If he doesn’t want to go through them, that’s not on me.”
“Is it because you
“There’s too many people in London.” Potter says as he gets up, turning around his bed in look of something, his own mug in hand, while Draco starts gulping half of his. “Too many… you know, things,” he waves vaguely.
What the fuck is that prophecy story? Was there actually one, after all?
Harry relaxes too. He was afraid it had been a bad idea. He wondered for a while what was the policy on birthday for someone you were seeing casually. Do you do dinner? Presents? Sex? Ignore it completely or acknowledge it in a quick letter? In the end, he just decided to treat this like their usual dates – well, almost. And, so far, it seems to be working.
Harry shrugs his jacket on the chair and starts searching the deck. He has an approximate idea of where he put it, but in the dark, it’s not easy to find.
“Potter,” Draco insists, “what does my mother have to do with any of this wild story?”
“Good.”
“Careful, I can take that coffee right back from you,” Potter says, moving back to him, extending his hand that holds the shoe.
“Of course he didn’t,” she sighs. “Sure, we have a nice amount of people who will give a hundred of galleons here or there, sometimes more, sometimes less, and that’s always very appreciated. But most of it – about ninety percent, I guess? It’s from Harry.”
“Well, you are. Look at you,” Potter gestures his hand wildly, “With your perfect hair and your perfect eyebrows and your shirt that is made of, like, silk.” He leans over the table and touches the fabric over the elbow, where Draco pushed the sleeves up his arms earlier, revealing the dark mark – which didn’t seem to bother Potter in the least.
He then takes an inspiration and says: “I just wanted to apologize. I lashed out at you last week, and you didn’t deserve it, so I’m sorry for that. I guess,” he adds with a smile: “that, after all these years and despites my best wishes, you still get on my nerves.”
“Careful, Rosie, I’m coming with fragile stuff,” Harry warns her as he approaches the table.
“One day you will have to explain to me why you put your bed in the middle of the room and not against the wall, like some civilised human,” Draco hisses as he puts his weight on the mattress.
But if he loses? Well, he’ll let Draco own him.
Refusing to think about anyone around them who may be watching, Draco stares at him and whispers: “I like you, alright?”
Draco clears his throat. “I am not done yet.”
“Yes, he said he had extra tickets,” Draco says, even if he hasn’t quite taken his decision yet about it –
“Well, considering I’m the one who actually got the tickets, do I have to, really?”
His fingers are about to slip away from Draco’s skin when he finds the strength to catch them with his other hand and assert: “No.”
“Nice to meet you,” Draco says.
“Don’t worry,” Harry winks, “I’ll make defeat sweeter to you.”
“I’m messed up too. And I don’t have to explain you why, I guess, because you know exactly who I am and where I come from. And I can’t change that.”
“Sorry I’m late,” Harry pants, “I was finishing the summer program with Amantha and Padma wanted it on her desk tomorrow morning. You didn’t wait too long, I hope?”
Harry doesn’t know how Zabini is at all, but, if Draco is to be believed, the answer is: unreliable.
(Damn these first two chapters are very long, the next ones are much shorter)
Her attention is diverted with the arrival of Teddy with hands full of knives.
Not that he’s telling lies or anything like that. He is insanely proud of what they’ve built here, knows everything there is to know about the place and worked very hard to insure the children’s security and their well-being. He also loves to show what they’ve done and achieved to other people and, since his friends grew bored of that a long time ago, he’s somehow glad to have a new audience to introduce to the wonders of the Tonks and Lupin school and orphanage.
“Honestly? I couldn’t see myself doing anything else.”
Hermione laughs sadly as she shakes her head and sits down. “Of course, that’s what he would say. And yes, it’s true. Don’t go around saying it, though.” She gesture to a seat on the other side of her desk, and he sits too. “He doesn’t want people to know.”
Potter shrugs, defeated, and looks away.
“You can call him Draco.”
Draco can picture the scene, but he shakes his head. “I have lunch with my mother on Sundays.”
actually being the present? Is Potter trying to apologize for hiding him away?
Draco smiles. “Yes, you can say that, I guess.”
“Sorry, did I wake you again?” Potter laughs. “I tried to be quiet.”
Potter laughs. “Yeah, knock yourself out on the buffet. You can even leave early too, you know, if you’re bored. I won’t blame you.”
A few seconds later, the door slams and Draco’s fingers feel cold and empty. He closes his eyes.
Draco has a hard time settling in. That Potter knew his birthday was a thing, getting a present from him another one, but
“Did he say that explicitly?” Hermione eventually asks softly.
“Nina! What have I told you? You can only hit the other players with the bludgers, not with the bat itself!”
“That’s not what I meant! I’m happy to celebrate with you. I’m your friend too, you know. And besides, I’ve never heard you complain about the entertainment I provide.”
Potter laughs shyly and starts retreating. “I mean, if you don’t want me to be, we can all pretend tomorrow that this was just some regular drunkard bullshit talk.”
Harry laughs, tickling his neck. “Yeah, alright.”
“Yeah, right, sorry but she had a last minute meeting with parents, so she won’t be able to see you right now. But come on, I’ll give you a tour before she bores you with paperwork. That’s your first time here?”
find a way to get dirty. They will bring just as much dirt in when you wash them and when you don’t. Merlin, once I took a two minutes walk on the path with Matty, and when we got back in he had a huge clump of soil in his hair. I still have no idea how it got there.”
Draco is about to answer when the crowd cheers again.
“Okay. That’s it now. I’m done. I’ll leave you be, I have to pack. Goodnight, I guess? And if you want to see me… well, you’ll know where to find me.”
Harry is kneeling on the ground, showing Jerry how to dig a nice hole for some pepper plant, when he sees a familiar silhouette on the edge of his sight. He raises his head, then stands up with a determined sigh and wipes his dirty hands on his jeans.
Harry buries his head in his plate. They don’t need to know that he suggested to Draco that he may come over after dinner and that Draco didn’t say no.
Draco shakes his head. “No. I just wanted to understand how the place works.”
And even when, while falling asleep, Harry clumsily pats his head – or his shoulder – and mumbles “I like you, you know.”
Maybe he wasn’t casual enough? Maybe Draco just wanted meaningless sex, and instead Harry offered him breakfast and quidditch with kids? Of course Draco ran. He sobered up and realised that he didn’t want that trainwreck in his life, which is understandable. After all, Harry jumped on him after what, two dates? That weren’t even dates? Who does that? Some sort of regular drunkard, probably.
Still, she’s brilliant on the field. Better than he ever was, probably.
“Sorry, I had no parents for that.”
One of the reasons – the main reason – he accepted this assignment was because he wanted to figure out why, out of all of the choices that were offered to him, this is what Potter chose to do with his life. After the war, he could have been anyone, done anything he wanted, asked for anything; it would have been given to him. But no, instead of being the hero everyone wanted, he didn’t even come back to Hogwarts, he buried himself Merlin knew where and only reemerged to open his orphanage.
“Sure thing, I’ll keep them coming, if you want.”
“You’ll ask your grandmother,” Harry answers. “Come on, give me those glasses before they fall again, I’ll take them. You can go and grab the cutlery. It’s on the kitchen table.” He grabs the tray from the teenager’s hands and signals Draco to follow him. “Good thing you’re here, you’re gonna help set things up. Could you open that door for me? And leave it open, thanks.”
Potter stretches his neck and spins, appreciating the coolness as well before turning toward him. “So, you’re apparating straight back to London?”
“Draco Malfoy.”
Potter gets up, still smiling at him, and waves at Rosmerta, who is buried in orders. She nods at him with a smile, shooing him away.
Harry smiles, relieved. “Good. We both said things we shouldn’t have, it’s been acknowledged and forgiven, now maybe we can start over on a better base?”
“Fries for me. Draco, fries?”
He was fearing the worst from tonight. It’s the first time he’s properly introduced to Harry’s gang as his boyfriend, and he was expecting common courtesy at best. He came early hoping to catch Harry on his own before it all starts and he gets busy, but apparently he wasn’t he only one with that idea.
“Hey!” he grins. “You’re early. Teddy, this is Draco. Draco, Teddy.”
Draco turns to him. “Depends what’s at stake.”
“Well,
“You had a different opinion when we were in school, Potter.”
Draco has a hard time believing all of that, even if he’s the first to acknowledge that time can actually change someone, and this is partly the reason he’s taken this assignment from his department: to find out who Potter has become.
Dracos pulls him in against his body.
“To you. They’re my own parents, I’m allowed to joke about them.”
“Besides, apparating is the exact same thing whether you do it from here or from your place, so your complaints are irrelevant.”
He then turns back to the rest of the group. “You know Padma Patil, of course, our wonderful headmistress, who does all the hard work while I’m here telling you jokes. And you may know Draco Malfoy, who works at the ministry, in the secrecy and security department.” He keeps his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“So, what about this summer program?” Draco asks as they start walking toward the Three Broomsticks. “Isn’t there less kids to entertain, since school is ending?”
Potter laughs again. “That’s not true, Dan. See, Draco over here isn’t evil. And Amantha was a Slytherin too, and she’s a very good teacher, right?”
Draco stares at him over the collar of the shirt who smells like Potter, and Potter smiles at him.
“Morning, Draco,” he smiles as he shakes his hand. “I guess you’re the one doing the ministry inspection?”
“I’m sorry, you what?”
a disaster. He loves it.
“To be fair,” Draco says, taking his glass with a smile, “We didn’t only talk about the game.”
“Yeah,” Harry chuckles. “Welcome to my life.”
“I do!” He protests. “I’ve done casual before.”
Draco nods goodbye at her as he follow Harry.
Maybe he shouldn’t have mentioned the dark spot and the dangerous plants. And Luna. Is this a concern for safety? Will Draco report about it? Maybe his friends are right and he
end up at his place?”
“Do you want a broom?” he asks Draco, still standing next to him, as he gets on his own. You can also go in the stands if you prefer.
Harry extends a hand to him, but Draco crosses his arms, tucking his own under his flanks. He’s not ready for that. Not yet. Harry’s hand stays in the middle of the table.
“Good.”
Which is why he says:
“Quidditch tickets?” he comments, without the usual sneer in his voice.
“Thank you,” he finally says. “I must admit that I miss him, even if I don’t really regret him.”
She leaves and Harry focuses on adding some mayo and mixing it with the ketchup using a fry.
She closes the door behind him then goes behind her desk, where she retrieves a bag Draco is sure he’s seen somewhere. She hands it to him.
Harry laughs. “That’s the spirit I love. Come on, Ginny has got the team making all in hand, let’s go get brooms and balls.”
“How far are those seats, exactly, Potter? Are we sitting on the roof?”
“I assumed you and I were too different, but it turns out we are probably more alike that I thought. So maybe we should –
He feels like he’s been here for hours and, at the same time, that it’s only been a few minutes. But he sure knows he should stop drinking before he does something he will very much regret later.
“And what if you had really died, then, uh?”
“I came for
Then Potter’s lips are on his and all the remnants of his brain are fully gone.
“We have what we need. I don’t see the point in asking for more when we function perfectly fine as it is. I don’t see the point in taking money from some other place just for some greedy reason. And Padma probably agrees, or she would have done it before.” He smiles, then adds, seeing the frown on Draco’s face. “We’re fine, really. Thanks for the advice, though. If we ever need it, I’ll know we can ask.”
“Oh fuck, she’s seen it! Draco, she’s seen the snitch!” Without thinking, he grabs his arm.
“Draco?” He turns to face Andromeda. She looks both so like and unlike his own mother it’s disturbing. “You look good, my boy,” she smiles at him. It’s a pleasure to see you.” Without waiting for his answer, she pulls him into a hug. As she lets him go, she still holds his shoulders. “You look so much like Narcissa. How is she doing, these days? I haven’t heard from her in a while.”
He starts walking to the locker rooms, and feels some relief when he hears Draco’s footsteps behind him. Just to be sure, once they’re far enough from the others, he says: “You know I don’t believe in this Slytherin-Gryffindor rivalry anymore, right?”
He hears Harry chuckle as he wraps his arms around him, hugging him tighter. “It’s okay. It’s not your fault. I’m fine now. It’s okay.” And he’s rubbing Draco’s back and soothingly repeating these words, as if he wasn’t the one who actually had to go through that.
“Sorry for not telling you it was boring,” Potter laughs as he walks past him to grab a glass of water on the table. “I just thought you might make things more fun.” He hands him the glass.
This feels more intimate than sex, somehow. Drinking coffee in silence on a unmade bed, wearing someone else’s shirt, in a messy room that already seem so familiar to him, the sun shining on them, he feels more naked than he did last night in the dark.
As he flies above his friends and coworkers, he can’t help but smile. Even Padma, who isn’t the biggest fan of quidditch, climbed on a broom today, and Amantha, who pretends not to care about anything, is fiercely holding a bat. He loves seeing them all gathered here, having fun, yelling at each other and enjoying the day. He also loves the excitement of the kids in the bleachers, and how seriously Adam and Debbie seem to be taking their job. This is happiness. If every day could be like today, then he wouldn’t want for anything else in his life.
“Sure,” answers Harry as he raises his head over Nina, relieved that Padma doesn’t seem in any type of bad mood towards him. “I just have this quidditch match to handle after lunch, but then I’m free. Will I need to do, or bring something?” he asks as he turns to Draco.
She laughs. “You are free to do whatever you want with everything I told you – except repeat it to anyone else, of course. I trust you, whatever you choose, to keep Harry’s secrets, as you said you would.”
“Now give me back my wand, Potter.” Draco says, reaching for his hand.
They make their way to him through the densifying crowd, and Harry greets them with a beaming smile and “Draco! I’m so glad you could make it!” while he pulls him in a quick hug.
nemesis. And you don’t want to be, trust me.”
“This wasn’t here before.”
She nods, still smiling. “Yes. We have had our differences in the past, and we still do, sometimes, but she’s still my sister. We thought we both can do with a little more family in our lives.”
Harry laughs unhappily. “Yeah, I know that, but none of this blood shit is actually about giving kids happiness or a chance at a good start in life. I don’t want to talk shit about anyone, but some of the kids here are much better with us than they would be with their remaining blood relatives.”
They drink in silence for a few seconds, and Harry realises that Draco’ glass is not emptying as fast as he should, so he matches his pace, not to seem like an unsophisticated ignorant.
“Careful with the glasses, Teddy, you don’t have to take that many at one time.”
Is she trying to tell him that Potter actually wants to be with him? Draco’s mind is circling back to every interaction he had with him over the past few months, looking for clues he might have missed or words he might have misinterpreted.
Draco laughs when Potter’s fingers brush his skin. “That is not silk. Do you even know what silk is?”
“Go wash your hands before you touch anything, none of us wants to hear Padma’s sermon about cleanliness one more time!”
Draco smiles. “Can’t you talk to snakes, too?”
“I don’t think that!” Harry defends himself – though he was kinda thinking that. “I just don’t think people should be alone on their birthday.”
He stands there, waiting for Draco to say something – he came to find him, after all. That must be a good sign, right? Maybe? Or maybe it’s just work related.
Harry smiles as the whistle blows.
Harry gives the same sad smile as earlier and, this time, Draco realises that the pity isn’t directed outward, but inward. He leans forward again and pulls Harry against him. Harry scoots closer and nuzzles his nose in Draco’s neck. They just rock back and forth for a bit and, this time, Draco is the one rubbing Harry’s back.
“I know your social education is lacking, Potter, but did really no one teach you how presents work?”
“I’ll be going to France at some point. To visit Pansy.”
“She is,” Draco concedes as he walks into the pub.
let go of Harry’s hand, but he doesn’t want to.
Harry doesn’t really know how to act around Draco, and he certainly doesn’t want to show it. Sure, they’ve been on friendly-ish terms for years, but that doesn’t mean that they ever willingly spent any time together. Especially alone with each other.
She stops, and sits back down, carefully considering him. “Did he tell you that?” she asks slowly.
“Nina has always been hard headed, but she’s a good kid. Definitely a Gryffindor.”
It’s okay. Harry can do casual. Next time they meet, he can act as if nothing happened, and let Draco see that he doesn’t expect anything from him. That will help, hopefully. He just needs to stop being so blatantly upfront about everything. He can do that, too, probably. Maybe, if this works, they can stay friends. Or, at least, friendly. He likes being friends –
“And here we have a simple vegetable garden, you know, for daily food. Right now we have the first courgettes, and some peas, a few radishes – though they didn’t grow very well this year, don’t know why –, and tomatoes are starting to appear even if they are still very small and green. The kids also help with that, they love eating things that they’ve helped grow, it’s a great way to make them eat vegetables, plus, like the magical garden, it’s a great activity for them. If you stay for lunch, I think we’ll have some spinach we harvested yesterday.”
“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Draco,” says Padma as she closes the door behind him. Please have a seat. I hope you enjoyed the tour?”
“Sorry, I got to go, I guess,” he whispers. “Take all the time you need to get ready, don’t worry, and let me know about Sunday, alright?” He turns to him with a smile, putting his hand on Draco’s thigh and planting a kiss on his cheek. “Have a nice day,” he adds before jolting up to the door, here he turns to wink at him.
“Is it true that he died? During the battle of Hogwarts?” Draco spurts out.
“What?” Potter laughs. “No! I have to be on stage in five minutes to give the opening speech.” He takes back his glass since Draco didn’t take it.
, weren’t expecting support?”
In a habit, he touches the scars on his hand, faded, after all these years, but still present.
“We played against each other, yes.”
“Yes,” Draco breathes.
Especially when, in the middle of the conversation, Potter turns to him and whispers: “Are you alright? We can go, if you want.”
Potter laughs. “You’re way more funny than I thought you’d be, you know?”
“You… you’re in touch with my mother?”
“Whatever he wants. Well, no, not exactly, and you’re ministry so I shouldn’t be telling you that so, officially, he’s our project director, which means he’s in charge of the development of the place, of coming up with new ideas for our grounds and activities, of developing partnerships… He actually does a lot of work besides giving tours and quidditch lessons. But, you know, if one day he wants to give a cooking class or help set up a vegetable garden, no one is going to stop him.”
Draco absentmindedly shakes his head and sits in front of her. So, everyone knew?
“I swear it’s like herding cats,” he sighs. “Anyway, sorry for all that. And,” he smell his own shoulder “sorry about the smell. There may have been an incident involving manure.”
Judging by his cold face and attitude, Draco isn’t especially pleased to be here – or to be with him. But, no matter what his original opinion of the Tonks and Lupin school and orphanage is, if there’s one thing Harry is passionate about, it’s this place, and he’s determined to show it to Draco. The ministry can’t harm the place, he won’t let them, no matter what Malfoy tells them about it. And he’s gonna show him all the best things about the institution.
To avoid his smile, Draco’s eyes fall onto Harry’s hands on the table. The snake is curled up inside his wrist, sleeping.
“Wait. I don’t want Padma to see us,” he whispers, nodding towards an open door.
“Is everyone here? Come on, let’s go before this lot gets stampeded by the crowd,” says Amantha. “Okay, kids, grab your game buddy and don’t let go, we’re going in.”
Draco sighs. “I’m not gonna leave. Well, except if someone challenges me to a duel, maybe. I wouldn’t want to duel on your birthday.” He smiles and briefly puts his hand on Harry’s cheek.
Harry doesn’t really want to dive back into the topic of their Hogwarts years, that they’ve successfully escaped. He yearns for lighter subjects of conversation, so he smiles.
“I can lie to whoever I want,” he sulks.
Potter didn’t lie: he put him on the fundraiser’s guest list, and the event is fancy dress. Draco hesitated until the last moment about coming, even if Potter assured him no one would bat an eye about his presence and that there would be free food by an excellent caterer. Draco pushes back a smile. Of course Potter would think about food. Draco doesn’t know whether it’s from hanging out with kids, but Potter always has a dozen of snacks in his pockets and seems to be constantly eating when there’s food around.
“Very. Trust me, I’ve seen the accounts, he can afford it. He has his own parents’ inheritances, plus Sirius’ money – and you probably know a thing yourself about the Black’s fortune.”
Potter leans against the desk, his smile almost shy. “If you don’t have any plans for the evening, do you wanna come here and have a drink? Or I can come to London, if you can’t stand the mess of this room.”
“What happened?” Harry asks, turning to the other side.
“We were supposed to meet for
“Hi. Yes. Not for the gardening, obviously.”
There’s a silence, then Draco rolls over to face him. His left hand rests on Harry’s hip and, with his right, he pushes back the hair from Harry’s forehead.
“Gross. I’ll stay a peasant, thanks.”
He becomes enthralled in the game again, and stands up without noticing it. Ginny has always been great on a broom, but she hasn’t stopped improving since she joined the team. Her flight is precise and agile, and her coordination makes it seem almost like a dance. He truly is fascinated by her, her fierceness and her playfulness. When he watches her playing, he can understand why he fell in love with her once.
“No.” Potter’s answer is just as straightforward as his own. But then, he hesitates. “If I could… if I could go back in time, I would probably act exactly the way I did. But I would probably try to involve less people. Many people died who didn’t deserve to.”
Draco chuckles, and Harry feels like it’s the first time that sound hasn’t been mockingly directed at him. He smiles back.
Harry squeezes him briefly. “You know, a classic Slytherin versus Gryffindor. To reminisce the good old days.”
“So, how’s your report coming along?” He asks, munching on the potatoes.
“How was Norway?” Draco asks, to clear his mind.
Both Ron and Hermione immediately still. Harry keeps his head lowered over his plate, though he’s not eating anymore.
“Thank god for her. The place wouldn’t be running so smoothly if she wasn’t here. It was a blessing when she joined us. She was bored at her office ministry job when I ran into her at a ceremony or something and I casually mentioned how behind I was on some paperwork, and jokingly said she could have the job if she wanted. Two days later she was at the door with her resume and her conditions. She was hired on the spot.” He chuckles an runs a hand though his hair, briefly looking toward the bar. “That’s basically how everyone joined. Just by showing up at the door and saying they could help. More times than I am willing to admit, it followed a joke I made about how we could use a hand for this or that.”
Potter stops and stares at him. “No?”
And if that’s what casual is, he loves it.
His other hand is taken by the sticky fingers of Matty, who is both the tiniest and filthiest kid he’s ever seen.
“Yes, same for me, thanks,” Draco adds.
Draco nods. From what he’s seen so far, both in his conversation with Padma and in his current checking, not only does there seem to be no infraction to the ministry regulations, but the place also appears to go above and beyond what’s usually asked. He will not admit it out loud, but he’s actually impressed.
All the cool band shirts Harry owns are probably because Ginny dragged him to the shows.
“Oh, Harry, you should have started with that.”
She’s already shuffling parchment as he walks himself to the door. As it closes behind him, he thinks that Harry and him seem to have more in common than he actually thought.
“Ginny was brilliant, wasn’t she?” Potter says as he pushes the door to the pub. “She’s so amazing on a field. That dive was so on point.”
“Yes, that’s the plan for later,” Potter laughs. “Hey, want a chocolate frog?”
The truth is, after-war Potter reacted very different from what everyone else expected him to. They all thought he had a brilliant auror career ahead of him, right under the spotlight, that would have ended pretty early with the position of Minister of magic open just for him. But no, instead, Harry completely disappeared form the radar, not even coming back to Hogwarts, as it was found later to raise his orphan godson, and when he reappeared, it was to open this orphanage that has been his career since. He has refused to talk about anything else than that in interviews, has never hinted of having any life plans besides that, and has remained a mystery, as he always was, in a sense – though a different one this time.
“She fucking did it!” Harry yells, arms in the air, before turning to Draco and embracing him in a tight hug. “She caught it! Man, did you see that dive?”
“Actually, I start by going down to London to pick Teddy up at the train with Andromeda, then we spend a few days with her before going hiking in Norway for a full week.” Harry is so excited about this. There is something frustrating in knowing that Teddy is right there, in Hogwarts, all year, and that he can’t see him. Getting one full week, alone with him? It’s his treat more than Teddy’s, if he’s completely honest. At thirteen, the boy probably would rather spend time with his friends than his old godfather. “What about you?” he asks Draco as he opens the door for him. Any summer plans?”
Harry feels somehow relieved that he wasn’t misunderstood. “I’m sorry about your father.”
“Should I thank you for your blessings?” he sneers – but his tone lacks sarcasm.
Draco has always hated morning people, and he’s doing his best to conjure that feeling right now, but sadly the only thing he gets is tenderness for the man twirling around him.
Draco almost wants to say he came for selfish reasons. “Well, I came because I heard the food was good,” He says instead with a half smile.
“Thanks,” Harry says as he rises his glass before taking a sip.
Ginny laughs. “What I mean is, you’re the least casual person I know – apart from Hermione, maybe. And, also, you’ve always been bad at romance.”
“No.”
“What the fuck, Potter?”
“So you just…” Draco can’t even finish the sentence. He can’t imagine himself at seventeen, or even now, willingly walking to his death. Would he be able to do that? Would he have been?
He focuses a bit, then feels the tattoo unroll itself and slither to his other collarbone, where it curls on itself again. Draco’s fingers follow it.
“It would have been worth it.”
She leans forward and plants her elbows on the desk.
A dreadful feeling falls into Draco’s stomach. He’s not sure he can handle a full match with Weasley’s presence – nothing against the guy, though, it’s just that they’ve never been and will never be the best of mates. “Is he coming on Saturday?”
“Draco! Do come in, please.”
Draco hopes they won’t come.
“You know where to find me,” Harry told Draco right before he left, on Sunday. He willingly left things open, unsure whether Draco would want to see him again, leaving him a way out in case he didn’t.
He feels Harry smile as he kisses the crook of his neck. As he looks down at their hands, he sees Harry’s snake tattoo on the thumb that caresses his own.
He doesn’t really know what to do with this new, improved Potter, who doesn’t only look for his companionship, but also seems to enjoy it. Who is more temperate, but also as set as ever in his ideas. Who doesn’t jump into a fight every chance he has to. Who apologizes. Who has kids drawings on his walls.
Draco nods. “Maybe it was time for things to change. I think we can all agree that not everything was perfect in the old wizarding world. I’m not… I’m not saying the war was a good thing, but it brought a new perspective on things that seriously needed to be revamped.”
“Good. Then tell him. You may be surprised by the answer.”
“I have one, and it’s plenty enough,” Draco laughs sadly, his hands resting on Harry’s lower back.
Merlin, there’s a line between
“I wasn’t going to.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We will talk about this!” Padma yells. “What did I already tell you about gardening?”
“How dare you, a mere human being, dismiss me, a professional quidditch player?”
Draco retreats a few inches. “Are you talking about your dick?”
“And no one knows this? Really?”
“Well, I thought you may have, since it’s your birthday,” Harry says as he holds the door open.
