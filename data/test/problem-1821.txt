By time Hermione and her contingent returned with Harry’s ear, he had all but drifted off into slumber against Draco’s chest. The ear had to be cleaned first and treated with a series of potions, which they fortunately had on hand (apparently the severing of body parts was not uncommon among Quidditch teams, even the professional ones). Harry was grateful when the moment arrived that his ear could be reattached to his head. The bandage was still on, to hold it in place overnight, and the pain potion was rationed out so he had enough to get him through the following day at least.
“This display – who came up with the idea?” Belatedly, Potter looked him full in the face and sputtered to a halt. “Wait a minute –
Draco shook his head at his thoughts as they approached his home. He couldn’t help admiring Harry’s boyish good looks as he sprang up to the door, taking the steps two at a time. How could he ever have thought he hated that face, those eyes, and the glasses that covered them? Well, he did sort of still hate the glasses, but he had not yet worked up to convincing Harry that he needed a new pair, let alone no glasses at all.
Draco inclined his head slightly. “Weasley. So kind of you and Granger to invite me into your home,” he drawled, as if possessed by his father.
at Harry, for being so quick to believe that Draco was capable of using the Killing Curse. The anger flared back to life and he remembered what he’d decided to do, even if it cost him a piece of his heart.
Draco turned his head back from the window, blindsided by the question. Somewhere in the past few minutes his mind had drifted away from him, seeking liberty in the blue sky outside the cozy room where his compulsory Muggle therapist had set up camp. Not for the first time, he wished that he could spell the room to expand, perhaps add a potted plant or two, spark up some flames in the closed off fireplace.
Harry nodded and accepted the cup Draco offered him. After a couple sips, he rearranged his seat on the bed and leaned forward. “I have an idea.”
Harry was not prepared for the scene that greeted them when they had spun out of Apparition, and from the expression on Ginny’s face, neither was she. They appeared at the top of the red carpet, closest to the steps leading up to the main entrance, and with a joint “Protego” had flung up shields around themselves before advancing down the carpet toward the street. There were still security guards slumped over willy-nilly, some of whom were being tended to by Mediwizards. A cluster of people had gathered to one side, where a pair of bodies lay prostrate. One of them was wearing blood red robes, and Harry’s heart leapt into his mouth as he broke into a run. Was it – could it be…?
She was a little pink now, and possibly tearing up, although Harry couldn’t tell through the blurring of his own vision. Her words were like a much-needed balm upon a newly exposed wound that he didn’t even know he had until very recently.
“Er, no, not really. I’ve had more than enough of that, remember?” He tapped his scar for emphasis. “I’ve only just gotten used to not being papped every time I try to go on an errand. Like when we were living together.” He shuddered. “It was awful, and I’m sorry if that’s something you’ve had to get used to.”
Draco just stared at him, and Harry suddenly felt very awkward indeed. Was he comparing him to Nigel in his head, and did he find Harry wanting? Just when he thought he had completely bollixed everything up, Draco smiled in a sultry sort of way and brushed a hand along Harry’s arm to land on his waist. “Feeling a bit nervous about me, are you?”
Thankfully, there were funny parts too. Draco found himself smiling more than once at Harry’s stories about getting back at the Dursleys, and was surprised when Harry reached over to switch on a lamp. He had not noticed how dark it was getting.
Draco shook his hand slowly, looking into Harry’s eyes as if he were memorizing their color, then said, “Draco. Draco Malfoy.” He surprised Harry by leaning in and following up with something extremely familiar. “Don’t want to make friends with the wrong sort, do we? I can help you there.”
But. There was always a but, and this was a big one. What if his massive need to connect with Draco right now was motivated by pure selfishness, and not truly by a desire to make the world a better place for queer Wizards? Was it really worth the upset it had already caused among Draco’s family, with him in such a precarious position with Wizarding law? For the first time, Harry wondered to himself if Draco did in fact cast a Killing Curse, or if it was all some big setup.
Hermione bristled in turn at Draco’s tone, but Harry preempted any further combative speech by sitting down, hard. He was much weaker and still more affected by drink than he had thought. Hermione rushed to his side and checked his pulse, then looked up at Draco with a worried expression. “He Splinched himself and lost an ear, if you must know. I’m not letting you move anywhere until I get him stabilized.”
“Look, you know that I’m not used to being with men. I’ve never even so much as kissed anyone before you.” Harry’s gaze dropped a little, and he swallowed, mouth dry. “I still don’t know if I would call myself gay, but I do know that I really enjoyed this.” He shifted a little to push Draco off his chest and sit up cross-legged on the bed, which hadn’t had time to lose its covers before he and Draco had thrown themselves upon it. “I hope that’s okay with you, that I have so little experience with men.”
“Sorry Harry, I don’t think I can say no.” She looked Draco over and stood up to go. “I have a big do coming up, some promotional thing for the Harpies, and I need a new gown pronto. Maybe this’ll be a good way for me to understand a little more of whatever you two think you’re playing at.” She refused to shake hands but gave Draco a slight nod. “Thanks for looking after him last night. I still think you’re a pretentious prat, but at least you have some sense when it comes to men and fashion. Spell me when the two of you are ready to retail, I’m free for the next few days.”
Nigel’s head subsided out of view, and Draco murmured something to him before turning back to Harry. “I have to get to work in about an hour, so if you don’t mind waiting here and trying on the rest of the clothes you have with you, the two of us can do one final sweep of the men’s department. Just remember to pose in front of the mirror with each item, Nigel’s spelled it to take pictures.”
Luna materialized as if out of nowhere, causing most of the people in the room to jump, with the exception of Feruza, who was still yawning herself awake. “Here, I can help.” She had some dark robes over one arm and a clothes hanger in the other hand, which she brandished like a weapon. Harry was impressed to notice that the new Auror had looked her up and down and assessed the situation within seconds. Her body language showed a relaxed alertness that promised swift action if any threat were to arise.
sort for myself, thanks. You should know that already, you tosser.” Draco was definitely smiling by now, and Harry felt light, as if a cloud had floated aside, leaving radiant possibility in its stead. “What d’you say we go for a walk?”
Draco’s grip tensed, but he chose not to say anything further, which Harry took as consent. It had been a while since he’d Side-Alonged anyone with him, but surely it was like riding a broom and wouldn’t set off any alarms.
She reached out a hand to pinch at Draco's cheek in a mocking sort of way, but he dodged and glared. “Why does everyone insist on calling me a kitten?”
There were towels aplenty, and he grabbed a couple before seating himself in his shower. He couldn’t think of another place to sit that wouldn’t be a pain to clean up later, and he was starting to feel dizzy.
Harry’s arms were crossed in front of him, puckering the green satin of his robes. “I don’t know, Draco. Why don’t you tell me what I should be upset about, you seem to have it all figured out.”
Draco was still smoldering with discontent, and Harry braced himself for unpleasantness, but to his surprise, Draco put one of his hands over Harry’s. His grip was warm, gentle with a touch of firmness, as if he wouldn’t let go if Harry tried to pull away.
Draco was indignant. “I am not a kitten, and if I were, I wouldn’t be a fluffy one. Take that back, Harry. Or at least make up for it by calling me something sleek instead. Like an ocelot.”
The beer tasted wonderful, like coming home, and Harry found himself enveloped in a haze of mild-mannered euphoria as the evening wore on. Brandon was pretty to look at, in a solidly masculine sort of way, and Harry felt more and more curious about whether his attraction to men extended beyond aristocratic Wizards like Draco. Brandon was not a Wizard, as far as he could tell, but was studying abroad in London and had become somewhat of a regular here at The Black Cap.
“Really happen?” Draco finished. “Yes. Yes, I believe it did. Harry, why didn’t you didn’t tell me how cool your ex-girlfriend is?”
“Why don’t you think about it while I look for your wand. Maybe it’s in your wardrobe, it’s certainly large enough to hide all sorts of things.”
Trevor the Troll-Blood came jogging toward them. “All right there, Mr. Potter?” He looked at Ginny and Feruza and frowned. “You all had better come with me, I think your bodyguard was injured in the ruckus.” He jerked a knobby thumb over his shoulder and extended his other arm to Ginny. “Right this way.”
Draco paused, gathering himself. He wasn’t sure if what he felt was more annoyance or curiosity, but in the end curiosity won the battle and he approached the young man, who did indeed appear to be none other than the famous Harry Potter.
Nestled in bed some hours later, Harry could hear Draco’s heart thumping away beneath his still-tender ear, and thanked whatever powers were listening that they were no longer on the outs. He still had to convince Draco that telling his mother about them was a good idea, but for now he could settle with telling his closest friends. So far, the blowback had been much less than anticipated by either of them, and Harry was grateful for it.
“Very funny, Potter.” Draco poured the tea and used the tongs to put sugar and lemon in his own cup. “Milk for you again?”
“Harry.” Draco’s look was scathing. “You’re the Boy Who Lived, and Vanquished. I think they might have room for you, even if you don’t technically work for the Ministry anymore.”
Draco was taken aback by Harry’s criticism, but had a quick retort. “Well you can be a right bell-end too. What about the time when you cast that slashing curse on me? Or when you stole my wand?”
Harry sat upright and crossed his legs at this new information, turning to face Draco before he spoke. “That’s tremendous news, Draco. If that’s really the truth, if it’s really what you want, then.” He swallowed. “I can’t stop you. Merlin, if I could…” His voice cracked, and he stopped to gather himself back together. “But I won’t. I’ve been so selfish, but I want you to have the freedom to do whatever you want with your life. Especially with your father back.”
, but he wasn’t sure it was wise to have wine about, after seeing how much Draco could drink. He settled instead upon pasta puttanesca, with rocket salad. He didn’t dare make a dessert after the pastry extravaganza of the day before, so he opted to buy a chocolate ganache cake from the bakery downstairs.
He shrugged and turned his head away. “Oi, Lacey! Got any extra brooms in the back you can bring up here?”
Harry shuddered at the residual heat wave that engulfed them both. They collapsed onto their sides in tandem, spooning on the sheets as they watched the tide of passion ebb away to a distant throbbing hum. The raggedness of their breathing slowed, and Harry’s thoughts turned toward the revelations of the day.
Draco shrugged and licked his lips again. “I could do with something a bit stronger, honestly, but I don’t think they allow you to drink alcohol here. Maybe a juice?”
Harry gave Draco a warning look and sidled carefully toward him. “So, erm, Ron, Hermione’s probably told you by now – “
He was facing away from her as he lay on the couch, but couldn’t help craning his head around after hearing her reply. “Sure, I’ve heard it mentioned. Isn’t it the title of the first book in that Harry Potter series?”
“Hey, thanks Draco. For this. It was – fun, sort of. I mean, as fun as possible for the amount of time we had.”
As he switched records, he explained further. “The lyrics remind me a bit of you, they even mention your name.”
“It’s called The Underworld, appropriately enough. You should go, if you haven’t gone; they have some great alternative bands there sometimes.”
Harry did not look at ease with the turn the conversation had taken. “Sure, I’ve thought about it. Maybe even beaten off to it a couple times. But with Ginny, it just didn’t – really feel appropriate. I loved her too much to feel comfortable sharing.”
Harry’s breath gusted wildly into his neck as they both found release at the same time. The power of their mutual climax throbbed through them, and once they'd landed a little, Draco congratulated himself before planting a final kiss on his forehead. He toppled once more onto the mattress and curled up cat-like alongside Harry. The physicality of everything had become exhausting, and he just wanted to lie there, allowing his mind free rein while the pace of his body slowed.
“Sorry, sorry.” Harry held up both hands in truce. “I’m just a bit out of my depth, that’s all. The last museum I went to was in Dijon, with Hermione, oh, a year ago? And it was nothing like this, just tapestries and stone carvings and an owl that people touched for good luck.”
Many thanks for more excellent beta support from Kbrick. My memory of how the Patronus Charm works was a little foggy when I first wrote this chapter, and there may still be some aspects of it that are not strictly canon, but for the sake of story development between the characters I chose to leave it as it is. The same holds true for Draco’s wand. Also, I’m curious to see if anyone caught the BtVS Easter egg buried in one of Draco’s lines. :)
Draco closed his eyes and breathed in deeply through his nose. On the exhale, his and Harry’s chairs shot backwards, neatly depositing Harry on the ground. Or he would have ended up there, if Draco hadn’t tightened his grip on Harry’s hand and pulled him to standing. The fierce glitter in his eyes had returned, and as Harry rose, Draco’s other hand came around to palm one side of his face and pull him in for a kiss. “Sometimes I love it when you get mad and call me by my surname,” he whispered, in a rumble that sent shivers up Harry’s spine. “All those years of insulting each other, I think I was really just a glutton for punishment.”
“Hey. That’s not fair. I wasn’t being insufferable, I was being sensible, you git.” Draco had had enough of tea and crumpets. “Do you know how much my family still looks down on Muggles and Muggle-borns?” He thought he saw a shift in Hermione’s body language when she noticed that Draco hadn't used the word Mudblood in her presence, and felt a tiny surge of triumph. “They tolerate them now because they have to, and because I’ve been studying them. But I don’t know how well they would react to hearing that I’ve been seeing Harry.”
“Sorry, you knew what would happen?” Harry couldn’t begin to fathom where this reaction was coming from.
“Move along there, move along.” A Mediwizard approached and was chivvying away the cluster of people now surrounding Harry and Draco. “I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but I must ask you to move aside while I check his vitals.”
Harry did so, tingling with the simultaneous feeling of pressure on his groin and Draco’s imagined gaze sweeping over his backside. The warmth of Draco’s body soon settled over Harry’s, and he thrilled at the sensation of him resting squarely on his sacrum.
As if they had read his mind, Mysteria dropped him a wink. “Had you fooled, didn’t I? I’m a Squib, Mr. Potter, and proud of it.”
“Yes. I realize that it might look that way.” The tone of his voice was flat as the look in his eyes, but deceptively so, Harry suspected. “Be a bit ironic, wouldn’t it, ending up in Azkaban just like my father.”
Hermione answered the door and shooed them both inside. “It’s a bit of a mess, sorry about that.” She was dressed in comfortable Muggle clothing but had made some effort to tame her hair and might have been wearing makeup. “Ron and I are still figuring out what decorating scheme we want, so it might feel a little – odd.”
“Private” ended up being a narrow hallway between two of the tiniest offices in the department (he suspected that his cousin Lucy occupied one of them, being the most junior Auror). A tiny window at one end illuminated Harry’s face, anxious and drawn. Draco finally permitted himself a good long stare, which seemed to hearten Harry. Poor sod.
Draco’s eyebrows went up at the last part, and he smirked a little. “Did you say drag queens? Whatever gave you that idea?”
Harry swung one leg over the broom. “Why don’t you get on behind me, I’m not sure how kindly she takes to being steered by others.”
“It was a gift. Bit silly, but I thought you might appreciate it.” Draco forked up a bite of sausage and munched with relish. “Merlin, I needed that.”
First, there was Philippe the stylist. Fortunately he was a Muggle and drew upon a team of other Muggles who had no idea who Harry was, except as Draco’s paramour. To his surprise, Mysteria was part of the team, as a makeup artist, and he had a pleasant enough time catching up with them while Draco talked clothing with Philippe. Harry was impressed to see that Draco was subtly working in a Wizarding theme, without revealing that they were actually Wizards.
Her words did not have the intended soothing effect on Draco, as he felt a resurgence of the regret he’d felt when he realized that he’d rejected the one person that you were never supposed to reject - an actual if mildly flawed hero who'd told you he loved you. And over what? An innocent misunderstanding about whether he’d cast a Killing Curse in self-defense, and a misplaced sense of filial duty? That was all it amounted to, really, and Draco felt like a prize idiot every time he thought about it, even if he had been rejected in his offer to come back to Harry eventually. He couldn't blame Harry for his reaction, not really.
Ginny chuckled and threw one arm around Harry, who did not look pleased with the way things were going. “Tell you what, why don’t we all get out of here, and you can find out what Z is all about?”
Clearly desperate for a conversation starter, Potter looked around him and commented on the appearance of the kitchen. “You have a really nice place, Malfoy. How long have you been living here?”
“Erm, both? Sort of. I think we had different ideas of how to go about it initially, but this is the compromise we landed on.”
As Mysteria went to work on the spot, Draco explained to Harry, “Look, this is going to be the first time that the Wizarding world gets to see us together. How we appear is going to be just as important, if not more, than what we say. The interview doesn’t get published until what, six o’clock tonight? We’ll be inside the Ministry by then.”
She was also naked, and doing something naughty with one hand, but Draco was much more worked up about the levitating part. Looking down at Harry, he saw that his eyes were wide open and fixed on the sight of Ginny in the doorway. A tiny smirk hovered around his mouth, and Draco felt indignant enough to slap a hand on his chest. “Harry! Enough with the Levitating, and put your eyes back in your head. I thought you only wanted to do that with me!”
“No, that didn’t work out in the end. He said he’s coming back to London and might be at the Christmas Ball tonight. Won’t that be a hoot, introducing him to Ginny and the rest of your friends.”
She smiled at him, a full one this time, and Draco was shocked that he had ever thought her ugly. “You can count on it.”
“Thanks for everything,” Harry said as Hermione and Ron waved them off from the doorstep. “It’s been a pleasure,” they responded. Ron’s arm had settled around Hermione, and Draco felt reciprocal comfort when Harry’s arm settled around him in preparation for the jolt of the Portkey. Snow had started to fall, and the moment would have been just right for a kiss if they hadn’t been clutching a dirty old tennis ball between them. Draco decided to make up for it once they returned to London.
He took a deep breath. “Godric, Ginny, I don’t know. That is, I think I might know, but I haven’t been able to articulate it.” He looked at her with remorse. “I’m so sorry for all of this, and for exposing you to the public eye the way I did when we were still together. You don’t deserve to receive death threats, or threats of any kind.” His voice felt very wobbly, and he sipped at the drink in his hand to steady it, before going on sheepishly. “But to be honest, up until that madman showed up, I was almost enjoying myself, talking to Luna, with Draco at my side.”
“Yes, of course you can, you tosser.” Harry felt his heart rate increase as he fumbled Draco’s fly open and slipped in under the waistband of his pants, taking him into his hand. It felt familiar, like wanking, but more thrilling because he didn’t know what kind of reaction to expect. He was flying blind, with only Draco to guide him through the motions to a safe and satisfying landing.
The words hovered in the air like a charm that had backfired, and the three of them looked at each other with wide eyes, silent. Only seconds later, two sets of those eyes were welling up. Draco had just enough time to register that Harry’s features had crumpled alarmingly before he threw his arms around Draco and began to ugly-cry into his neck. Hermione looked like she would have liked to do something similar, but held back out of respect for Harry’s feelings and merely sniffled while she overflowed in empathy.
In a surprisingly strong motion, Draco flipped them over to begin a predatory descent upon Harry. Harry closed his eyes and could have wept with anticipation as Draco’s hands drew ever lower. Yet he was unprepared for the shock of warmth and wetness he felt as Draco drew back his pants and took him into his mouth in turn, and he gasped a little, his eyes fluttering open to look down at him. He had received many blowjobs before, but this one had the added benefit of Draco watching his every reaction, his grey eyes partly obscured by a fringe that had developed in the last several minutes.
His hands were hovering threateningly near to Draco’s ribcage, so he relented. “All right then. It’s Drake Macavoy. Like the author.”
He swallowed before speaking. “Harry… the reason I don’t want to talk to her is because I’m afraid. Afraid that if she knows the truth about us before it goes public, she will have too much power over me.” He interlaced his fingers with Harry’s. “I don’t think I would have a choice but to do what she says, even if it means leaving you.”
and even attempted a few twirls during the final chorus, bumping up against Draco breathless and giggling.
Harry shook himself out of it and turned on the light. Time to make himself a warm milk and watch something relaxing on his new DVD player before tucking himself into bed.
Harry threw him a disappointed stare. “Really? That’s the first thing you have to say to her?” He turned back to Hermione apologetically. “Pay no heed to him, he can get a bit salty in the mornings.”
Draco, once satisfied with his makeup, agreed to hold off on arriving until after six. “Gives us a little more time to go over what we want to say. Because you know there will be reporters outside the entrance.”
Alone on the street, he felt disoriented and wandered about in search of the nearest Tube station. He ended up near a small park and attempted to get his bearings. It had been hammered into him that Apparating while drunk was a bad idea, and as he now felt rather into his cups, he would probably be better off taking the Tube after all.
Harry is too nosy for his own good and suffers the consequences, although he mostly gets over it by the end of the chapter. Draco goes a bit overboard with the drinking. There is glitter.
“Harry, I looked up to you, even if I didn’t want admit it. I also wanted you to care about me even when I wasn’t sure that I could return the favor. And now we both know that I do care about you.”
Draco shook his head slowly in response, but still didn’t say anything. Harry reached out one hand to cup the side of his face. “Draco? I need a little more communication for this to work.” He stared into Draco’s eyes as if willing him to speak. “I need to know that you’re still on board with not knowing where this is going. And I need to know if there’s anyone else we should be thinking about.”
After an uncertain glance at Harry, who nodded reassurance, she accepted Trevor’s arm and ushered Feruza along with her as they headed back toward the limousine. Harry brought up the rear, looking nervously over his shoulder for any potential attackers or press, but it seemed that the mob of people outside the barriers had subsided. It was a small, and unfortunate, relief to Harry that the crowds had been spooked by the night’s events, and he wondered how the Daily Prophet was going to handle the flow of news for the next twelve hours or so.
The bedroom was much quieter than the rest of the house. “Silencing wards,” Draco told him when he asked. “I have trouble sleeping without them. The bed is straight ahead, why don’t you lie down on your front.”
Brandon smiled and took the seat next to Harry. “I can help you out with ordering a drink, if you promise to let me pay for it.” His accent was American but not obnoxiously so, and Harry did not know how to respond at first. But he was thirsty, and lonely, and his tongue was throbbing and he had no further plans for the evening to keep himself from moping, so he went along with it. “Sure, why not.”
The space between them was warm and taut, as they sat in Draco’s kitchen and sipped yet another cup together. Harry couldn’t tell if it was a lingering effect of the Felici-Fizz, or if he genuinely thought that Draco was even more striking than usual, with the color whipped into his cheeks by the wind off the lake. His appreciation of Draco’s looks had crept from aesthetic to something more visceral.
“It’s a fish!” Harry was inordinately pleased with the quilted blue cosy’s form and how it complemented Draco’s dream. “Where on earth did you get this?”
The better part of the week had passed before Draco felt ready to reach out to Harry again. Between shopping and meeting Nigel and talking to his therapist, he felt like he’d had more than his usual quotient of human contact. Plus there had been a sudden uptick in customers at Bedknobs and Broomsticks. It was frightful to see how quickly the Quidditch and Potter-related books were selling, in anticipation of the new film coming out in November, and he wondered if Harry had any idea how much money he could be making off them. But he probably hadn’t, out of Gryffindor nobility or some such rot. Or wanting to stay hidden from the public eye.
“Anything worth sharing?” Harry’s voice was slightly hoarse, and he began stroking Draco’s hair like he would a favorite pet.
History-making, it turned out, took a lot more planning than Harry would have thought. He had given interviews before and made a few too many public appearances in the past few years for his personal comfort, but with Draco involved, everything was ratcheted up to a new level of perfectionism. It bordered on mania, and Harry would have put a stop to it if he didn’t know how important it was to him.
Harry did know, and he promised to explain when she arrived. “How do you like your eggs, Hermione? Poached, fried, boiled or scrambled?”
The question was clearly rhetorical, and Draco carried on in the silence broken only by Harry’s moans as he discovered yet another deep recess of pleasurable sensation. Draco had gone completely non-verbal at this point, just managing to focus his mind upon Harry and all the moves that he knew Harry liked. It had begun to feel like a well-rehearsed dance, and Draco performed it to the maximum of his ability.
Numbly, Harry complied, shuffling sideways on his knees while unable to tear his eyes away from the sight of Draco. He looked so vulnerable, so alone, and so
She refused to sit down until Harry brought her the tea, as strong as he could make it. Draco was relieved that she sat in one of the chairs and not on the couch where he and Harry had been
Draco laughed in surprise. “Did I just get called a playboy by a man who appeared on the cover of Witch Weekly shirtless? Surrounded by half-naked Witches in the centerfold, no less?”
Harry did not look any less cornered, so Draco decided to lower the stakes a little. “It doesn’t have to be tonight, of course. We can warm up to it, I have loads of records at my place. We can practice together.” He couldn’t resist reaching around and squeezing Harry’s backside for emphasis. “And no drinking, I promise.”
He was still a bit bothered by it all once he got to bed, but the tension in his groin ached to be released, and so his temporary solution was to indulge in a delicious wank, casting a lubricating charm to make his hand slippery enough for the task. He came in no time, despite his tiredness, and his last thought before drifting off to sleep was,
Ron turned scarlet. “Hermione! What did I say to you about bringing up the subject, you know it’s all rubbish cooked up by the press.”
Harry chuckled weakly as Draco writhed in mirth. “Very funny. You try picking out a name, it’s not as easy as it sounds.”
Harry’s voice dropped to a whisper. “Yeah, well how do you expect me to react? Last night we were, you know,
, lying there. He didn’t want to let go of his hand, but the Mediwizard took it from him to feel Draco’s pulse, simultaneously casting a charm to stem the blood loss. Harry found himself clutching his elbows instead, trembling as he watched the scene unfold before him.
Hermione was smiling a little, and Draco felt less uncomfortable about baring his soul to her. “You know, I’ve been meaning to ask you – what would you say to meeting up and having a proper academic discussion about the material I’ve been studying? Muggle history, and alchemy, and such?” He saw her hesitation, and tried to sweeten the deal. “Mind, I know you’re busy and all, but I do miss having a like-minded Wizard to talk to about these sorts of things. I love Harry, but in-depth intellectual debates aren’t really his thing, are they?”
“Of course not! It must feel like such a big deal to share it at first, I can only imagine, and I’m honored that you told me. You don’t need to worry about any judgment from me. Or from any of your Wizarding friends, for that matter.” She looked a little embarrassed. “I probably shouldn’t say anything, but we’ve been speculating for a while that the next person you dated would be male.”
“Draco? He don’t usually work Thursdays, but yeh might find him in Farringdon.” When Harry looked at him with puzzlement, the clerk winked. “You know, the sauna?”
, but he wasn’t going to say that part out loud. “I can’t promise that Potter will show up or that we will get along, but I will do my best to be polite to him.”
“Yeah, I know there’s a lot I still don’t know about. One of my co-workers in Auror training tried to explain it to me once, but I tuned him out after the word ‘bunghole’ came up a few too many times.”
“Well, not so for mine. As far as I can tell, my dad had the same messy hair. Maybe my mum’s was nicer, kind of like Ginny’s.”
Draco shrugged and leaned against one side of the doorway. “They all distanced themselves from me when the Dark Lord fell. Some of them even earlier, when they saw how far I had gone into the Dark Arts.” He smiled bitterly. “They are Slytherins after all, and what do we do when confronted with disgrace? We slither away, as quickly and quietly as possible.”
Harry hesitated a little, and watched while Draco Summoned the scarf, made of a navy-blue silky material. If this wasn’t a test of faith, he didn’t know what it was. He reasoned with himself that if Draco really had any ill intentions, he wouldn’t have put up with Harry’s magical experimentation at his flat earlier that afternoon. “All right, I’ll give it a try. But I want you to know that I’m not trying it to prove anything.”
Draco’s hand swung up to stop him. “I’m ticklish,” he explained. “And I don’t do cuddling usually.” He turned around to face Harry, still a little bit flushed. “That was fun though.”
Draco glanced over with lukewarm interest. “I think they were in our year at Hogwarts. Weren’t they in your House, and on your Quidditch team? I can’t remember their names; I think the blond one might have been Irish.”
Harry took a cautious sip, and found nothing to complain about. The cola fruit taste was off-set by a spice, perhaps cinnamon or a touch of nutmeg, and ended with a bitter note.
The exhibit did indeed turn out to be erotically themed, although not in a way Harry had expected. The Surrealists had a truly bizarre take on what might be interpreted as sensual or perverse, and he found himself paused more than once before a work of art without knowing what he was supposed to be gathering from it.
Draco chuckled and nudged Nigel conspiratorially, then turned to Harry with a serious face. “No really, Harry, it’s far too form-fitting and the cut is all wrong, although the color does match your complexion nicely.”
“You really didn’t need to do that,” Harry informed him. “It’s not the first time it’s happened, I could have managed on my own.”
In the ensuing scramble for clothing and dignity, Harry’s ear started bleeding a little, which was why he answered the door holding a wad of gauze to the side of his head.
, he thought with anguish. Across the city, and across the Wizarding world, people would be reading their interview, and likely glued to their radios as they listened to the unfolding news. To say that things had not gone as planned was a massive understatement. He fumbled for the Protean coin in his pocket and peered anxiously at its surface, but no message had appeared.
Draco subsided into silence while his solicitor took up the slack. Her argument seemed to center around the fact that Draco had been immersed in Muggle studies with minimal use of magic and might therefore be forgiven for overreacting to a threat from a gun. But Harry tuned out her words as he grappled with a growing feeling of dread. Based on how this round of questioning was going, it seemed all too possible that they might not let Draco off easy.
Before Draco could say anything further, Harry heard a knocking at the door. “Hang on, I have to get that. I’ll spell you back, I just have to take care of something first.” He started to get up before remembering the towels wrapped around his skull. He hoped that Draco hadn’t seen the blood soaking through one side, but it was too late to find out now, as he had already ended the spell with “Capitellum Kaput.”
Mariage Frères in Paris is real, and I speak from personal experience when I say that they had the best variation on Earl Grey that I have ever tasted.
It was Thursday morning when Draco set down his Earl Grey and activated a com-spell to buzz Harry’s wand. Harry took a while to respond, and Draco could see that he hadn’t slept very well. “Someone’s got a serious case of bedhead this morning,” he commented, by way of greeting.
Harry’s mouth was starting to go dry at the thought of what they were about to do. His feelings could only pale in comparison to Draco’s, and yet Draco seemed to be more put together about it than him at the moment. He was moved to a sudden impulse of honesty, and clutched at Draco’s sleeve to pull him aside.
“What about you, surely you haven’t been moping around at home all this time? Knowing you, you probably went to a pub a day, and had a grand old time.”
Harry couldn’t quite believe what he’d done, offering Malfoy – Draco – a chance to go flying. But it really was a shame, that someone who was once so keen about Quidditch and brooms was no longer able to enjoy them, and he wanted to share some of that joy. He missed flying with his Quidditch friends, now that Ron was preoccupied with his new side gig and Ginny did more than enough flying at her job.
Harry’s laugh came out in a chuff of air. “Yeah, that’s an understatement. Ticklish, eh?” His fingers flexed for the attack, but Draco beat him to the chase by straddling him and pinning both arms with his legs. Harry felt pleasantly trapped.
ex shopping at a place like Harrods. With help from Nigel, no less. “Not all gifts come with strings attached, Harry.” His voice came out primly, and Draco wished he could have said it differently, but it was too late.
She shook her head impatiently. “No, it won’t, I’ve already thought of that. But if I can take a quick look at it, I can replicate the spell to apply to a regular map of London. It might help me locate your ear more quickly, given that there was probably no shortage of magic performed in the past hour.”
Given that his previous testimony had led to Draco’s freedom, it was reasonable to hope that this time he would be just as lucky. However, there was the unfortunate fact that Draco appeared to have used an Unforgivable Curse. Even though the person he had killed was a deranged Quidditch fan who had been stalking Ginny and had clearly threatened lives by pointing a gun at her and other innocents, it did not look good.
Not for the first time, he wondered if the Sorting Hat really knew what it was doing when it divided first-years into their respective Houses.
“Harry, stay with me.” He’d forgotten about the wand in his hand, which was still connected to Hermione’s spell. “I need you to find something right away, and put pressure on your wound. Stay elevated, I don’t want you lying down just yet.”
“What are you thinking, Draco?” Harry’s tone was light, but his eyes were serious as they entered the hallway together and started shucking off layers. “I don’t want to disappoint you, but I really don’t see the use of going to an event like the Christmas Ball. Unless – “ he paused as he finished taking off his shoes “- you want to make some kind of statement by going.”
The look of need etched across his face, and his outstretched hand, was like a hook in Harry’s heart. Before he could properly sort through his feelings, he dove toward Draco and kissed him firmly, dropping the coat on the ground as he cupped his face in both hands. Draco kissed him right back, gripping Harry’s shoulders as if he would never let go.
The winds conspired to push him off course as he walked, so much so that by time he reached the pub, he was absolutely freezing. Once inside, he decided to park himself at the bar and order some chips, furtively looking around to check out the clientele. It seemed like a fairly ordinary if elegant place, with cozy lighting and a small curtained stage area at the far end of the room he was in. He was surprised to see a rainbow flag fluttering above the window as he entered, but after his tour through Soho with Mysteria, he was relieved to see that not all gay-friendly venues involved thumping music or glitter.
Morning was heralded by a sustained staccato of knocking at the front door, and Draco stumbled blearily downstairs in his purple velvet bathrobe to answer it. Philippe was on the doorstop, along with a squadron of stylists, and Draco remembered in a rush of adrenaline that today was the day of the Christmas Ball.
Harry should have known he would pick up on it, after kissing him so impulsively. He felt a spiral of shame beginning to unfurl and fought hard not to go under. “Yes, I did have a drink tonight. One beer.”
Harry didn’t know, but he did have a vague memory of there being something off about the attacker’s arrival. “Maybe it had to do with the fact that he wasn’t carrying anything magical, except for that antique cursed gun,” he mused out loud. “They did say he had a history of assault and had been stripped of his wand, hence the Muggle weapon. Although it wasn’t just any Muggle weapon; there was a pretty awful curse laid on it, possibly by a Grindelwald sympathizer back in the day.”
Harry followed along despite the whiplash he felt from Draco’s earlier words, his heart fluttering and rising into his throat. This was a side of Draco he had yet to experience, and he wasn’t sure how to take it. Was he being serious now, or was this just another, admittedly very thrilling ploy to avoid an important conversation and hide his true feelings from Harry?
“Well, as it happens, Draco is an excellent conversationalist, when the conversation is about something he is interested in.” Harry had switched to butterbeer and seemed to be getting hopped up on sugar. He paused at the implication, then boldly pointed out the obvious. “I guess it hasn’t been very interesting for him so far.”
Her proposition was met with varying degrees of interest. Harry looked cornered and probably would have said no, except for the gleam in Draco’s eye that signaled his growing desire for adventure. Feruza didn’t seem to care much one way or another, but Ginny insisted that it would make things much less boring, and she agreed in the end to go along with Ginny’s suggestion. “As long as we do not go back to the hotel,” she stipulated. “I do not have a good history with the Belmont.”
He winced at the sting of his thoughts turning upon him, and resolved to act less full of himself in the future.
“It’s just – I can’t stand how helpless I feel without him around,” Draco grumbled. “A person should not have that much power over someone else.”
Harry’s gaze was thoughtful. “Do we really, though?” Seeing Draco’s eyebrow lift, he clarified, “Not to point out the obvious, but we are kind of polar opposites. Which, as they say, tend to attract.” He nibbled on his lower lip and smiled a little at Draco’s reaction. “I think what makes being with you so interesting is that while we may have had little in common at first, the ways in which we connect are meaningful.”
– In case of what, Harry couldn’t be sure in his scattered frame of mind, but he didn’t want to feel any more alone than he already did.
“In here, Potter.” Malfoy was outlined against the sunshine pouring into the kitchen, and Harry felt himself heating up a little around the collar as he backed out of the doorway and fumbled off his shoes before joining Malfoy in the kitchen.
A glowing ball of light shot out of his palm, and Draco jumped in surprise. The light quickly dissolved into mid-air, and Draco turned astonished eyes on Harry, who was smiling.
Harry’s lips were a white line in his face. Draco felt sorry for bringing up such a sore point for Harry, but he wasn’t about to take an insult like that lying down. Instead of responding, Harry turned on his heel and resumed walking, his head bowed. Draco had to pick up his pace a little in order to keep up with him.
Draco’s eyes rolled skyward and he struggled against the magical bonds she had placed upon him. “I swear to Salazar, Granger, I am not going to hurt him. Just let me help him, please.”
Draco looked bored as he flipped through a rack of polo shirts. “Nigel has gone south for the winter. He usually waits until after Christmas, but he decided to leave early this year. Something about a new boyfriend who’s a prince.”
Hermione looked sharply back at Draco. “Surely you’ve heard that with great power, comes great responsibility. Enjoying it doesn’t really matter, in the greater scheme of things.”
Draco nodded. “Fair enough. Let’s try it again later, your talk of Dementors is making me crave chocolate.”
Harry relished the moment of peace afforded him while she bustled into the other room. Pain and ear trauma aside, he was feeling supported in a way that he had not felt in a long time. Being in close contact with someone like Draco Malfoy was exciting, and breath-taking, but it was not exactly comforting.
Harry was impressed by Mysteria’s composure, as Draco divulged all of this information mere inches from their busy hands. To his surprise, Mysteria responded by suggesting that they arrive just a teensy bit late, so as to make more of a splash. “The Prophet is almost never late, so if people can start reading the interview before you show up on the red carpet, so much the better.”
Harry brought his hands halfway to his face before remembering that he was in a public location and on view as a public figure. “Right, how could I forget that? I’d really like to get going now, if you don’t mind.”
Harry’s eyes went round with astonishment. “You’ve never used one? But what about – blimey, how do you not have a computer? Shouldn’t that be, like, top priority in Muggle Studies?”
The Z seemed to take forever before going into effect for him, but Harry noticed right away that Ginny and Feruza did not seem to be the least bit shy about showing their affection for each other. “Erm, excuse me,” he hedged. “Do the two of you want some privacy? Draco has a guest bedroom upstairs, if you need it.”
As if in response, Draco stretched his arms overhead and bent one languid hand to run over his hair, yawning. Noticing Harry’s eye upon him, he grinned lopsidedly. “What do you say to a game of cards, Harry? I have a few sets in the den, Wizarding and Muggle. Your pick.”
Harry snorted and brought his hands down to tickle Draco’s sides, but he was too quick and spun away. “Let me play you one more song, Harry, and then we can stop for a bit.”
“Hiya Malfoy. Harry told me you were working here again.” Ginny’s tone was cordial, even while she insisted on using Draco’s surname. “This is Feruza, by the way. Feruza Gallagher. She’s a Beater on the team.”
The details, it seemed, were that Ginny had been spotted at the last few public functions on the arm of one of the Beaters, Feruza Gallagher, an Amazon of a player who had been on the team for at least a year before Ginny joined. “Oh, and get this,” Hermione leaned in with a gleam in her eye. “Cho Chang is going to be playing against the Harpies, once Jessica Corbyn retires as Seeker for Puddlemere.”
Once that was taken care of, Harry pulled on an extra jumper, checked the mirror to see if there were any leftover traces of snogging Draco, and climbed through the skylight to the roof with his wand between his teeth. The window was big enough that he could see below if Draco got up and went anywhere. With the sun just beginning its final descent into night, Harry activated the com-spell, only to panic and end it before she could pick up.
Harry finished gulping and glowered at Draco. “I didn’t know what you wanted. Fine for you to criticize, after all the fancy drinks you’ve foisted upon me.” Belatedly, he realized that he had a milk mustache on his upper lip, and licked it away with a couple swipes of the tongue. The gesture seemed to soften Draco, who started sipping without further comment.
“It was probably the person who sent those death threats to you. He shouted something after you and Harry disappeared, something about the balance of the world being disturbed, and started waving the gun around like it was a magical weapon. Claimed it had cursed bullets in it. None of the Wizards around were able to touch him with a hex, he must have had a powerful protection charm in place. Malfoy here, he – “ Feruza paused for breath – “he was either really brave or really stupid. He just stood there calmly while all the spells were being cast around them, and started walking toward him. There was some kind of bright white light that shot out of his hand after he tried talking to the man for a bit, which spooked him into shooting. Malfoy was injured first, but before he fell to the ground, there was a flash of green light and the man was dead.”
Finally, every piece of clothing had been tried on, and Harry was thoroughly sick of the tinkling bossa nova music in the background. “Draco?” he called. “Can we go now?”
Draco was in a mood for trading stories and laughs, and so he offered to host them at his place instead, disregarding Harry’s elbow to the ribs. “I hope you don’t mind that we will have to travel by taxi.”
It turned out that Draco was right. With the copious application of lubrication charms and a reinvigorated hard-on, Harry found himself staring down the barrel of impending release again in no time, especially after Draco began imploring him not to stop. As he jerked forward on his hands and knees, he could feel the rhythm of Draco topping himself off by hand underneath him. He choked out Harry’s name at the climax as if it were a powerful incantation, and Harry came again seconds later.
Emboldened by this plan, he sat down and pulled out a journal that he had abandoned several months ago. A cursory glance at the last few pages he’d written reminded him of a time when his emotional landscape had been mostly occupied by guilt about Ginny and Ron and the rest of the Weasleys. The feelings seemed distant now, but he was still surprised by how quickly they came back to life when he read over what he had written.
If he continued along the trail of self-honesty, Harry could trace his decision to return to working in the Auror department to that moment, as a reaction to the letdown of returning to his dreary Muggle-bound life without Draco to keep it alive and sparkling. It wasn’t the perfect fit, of course, but it was better than wallowing in uncertainty about which path to take forward, and at least he had lots of friends there.
. A mutual acquaintance, indeed. Harry felt the automatic tension in his gut and took a few beats before responding.  “Yes? Well.” He didn’t know what to say. “What did you want to discuss? Anything I need to know?”
Their little moment passed, Draco wanted Harry all to himself. “Well, this has been lovely. Shall we carry on at another time? Maybe over drinks, if Harry doesn’t mind?”
Draco looked away from Harry, toward the door. “They’ve been gone a while. Maybe you should spell Hermione first to be sure they haven’t gotten lost or anything.”
“Since when have you been so interested in Muggle clothing?” Harry called over the door to his changing stall while trying on a shirt. He jumped a little when Draco opened the door and poked his head in to answer.
Harry was clearly not expecting this reaction. “Erm, sorry? You know me, I’m not really into fashion, or luxury, or any kind of shopping. Blame him if you have to.” He caught Draco’s eye and smiled a little. Ginny noticed the look between them, and seemed wary if slightly less ornery when Draco followed up with the first sentence that he’d been able to get in edgewise.
“Right back at you, mate,” said Ron with a grin, patting Harry’s back as they separated. “You’ve been entirely too successful at hiding away, ever since you and Ginny split.” His gaze turned away from Harry and landed upon Draco, which had the remarkable and instantaneous effect of snuffing out his smile. “Malfoy.”
Draco’s smirk faded. “Well, the interview happened. I think it went well, but Harry’s been a nervous wreck ever since. I’ve never seen him like this, I had to force him to drink a Draught of Peace and go to bed early. Can’t have him looking overwrought when we make our grand entrance tomorrow.“
The first surprise was that there were no house elves in sight. Hermione had wasted no time in drafting amendments to the laws regarding their treatment when she first started working for the Ministry, and he wondered if her efforts had finally started to bear fruit.
“So tell me, Potter, what brings you to London? Surely you have a cozy country cottage somewhere, far from the madding crowds of city life?” Draco had had a few drinks already, and could feel Potter recoiling a little at his affectation. What did it matter, he didn’t have anything to lose. Besides, it was hard to take Potter too seriously when he was lightly sprinkled in glitter.
Harry stood up and crossed the room to sit on Draco’s bed again. “But don’t you see, they’re an important part of it too.” He tried out his most winning look on Draco. “I know you’ve never gotten along with the Weasleys, but you have to admit that they are in a more powerful place than you right now. The Prophet isn’t even publishing our interview tonight, they decided to pursue Ginny’s story instead. We might get a mention, but at this point we’ve got nothing to lose.” He emphasized the point by pushing the tray aside and moving closer, to place both hands on Draco’s arms, which felt cool to the touch. “You seem to connect with Ginny just fine, and you did help save her life, after all. Do it for her.”
“Well, if it’s any help, I could refer you to mine. You’d probably have to go under an assumed name though, she knows a bit too much about you for a Muggle. The fictional version of you, that is.”
Draco reached out for the sausages and started to put together a plate of his own. “Harry, how do you get on? Haven’t you seen enough these past few days to know that looking good takes a lot of work?”
The activity at hand, however, was threatening to match the body count of the Battle of Hogwarts. Why was it that so many Muggle video games insisted on making even the simplest task as dramatic as possible? The arcade manager had said that the games were retro and easy to play, which made Harry think he might have a chance at winning, but he had not counted on the number of flames and gore that came with them.
His vaguely anxious look tugged at Draco’s heart, and prompted him to pull up his feet and lean into Harry like a cat demanding to be petted. Harry’s outstretched arm tightened around him, and his shoulder proved to be a solid, comforting place to rest one’s head. Draco closed his eyes for just a moment and submitted to the feeling of Harry’s hand stroking his hair. He felt so treacley, it was a wonder he hadn’t stuck to anything.
A few bites later, Draco was impressed. Harry had not been lying when he said that he was a good cook, and Draco wondered if there were some other unknown talents hidden up Harry’s sleeve. He intended to find out.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Kbrick's beta support during the revising of this chapter was invaluable. I really am going to stop now, it goes without saying at this point. :)
Draco laughed to himself, remembering how all sorts of misinformation had circulated in the Slytherin dorms about gay sex, before he found out from Blaise how good it could feel. “It’s fine, Harry, we’ll get there when you’re ready. I will tell you this, it’s a whole other world of fun that would be a shame to miss out on.”
“Why is that a surprise? Clearly you’ve figured out that I’m gay, do I need to walk on eggshells around you?”
“Harry!” Ginny had caught up to him, one hand hovering over her mouth in horror when she saw Draco. “Is he going to be all right?” She dropped down to one knee next to Harry when he didn’t respond, still frozen in shock. “I’m so, so sorry, but I’m going to have to leave you for a moment and find out what happened to Fer. I will be right back, I promise.” She gave him a teary sideways hug before running off again.
Ron looked a bit embarrassed at this new display of affection, and changed the subject. “You mentioned Ginny. Don’t tell me she knows about the two of you already.”
big part. He’s really, you know, charming. And kind, and funny in a goofy sort of way, even when he doesn’t mean to be. And he doesn’t usually demand too much of me, if he does get a bit jealous sometimes.”
“Mother…” He skimmed his tongue over his lips nervously, refusing to look directly at Harry just yet. “May I have a word with Harry, in private?”
“Mr. Potter,” she intoned, heavy-lidded as usual. “I want you to know that I am a big fan of yours. But, my admiration for you and your cause has its limits. I do not want to share Ginny, nor do I think you want it either.” She paused, irresolute. “However. Ginny has shared with me that she would very much like to – what is the expression – ‘get off’ while watching.” She jabbed a finger in the direction of the bedroom, where Draco was waiting. And listening, Harry was willing to bet. “She thinks that Draco is, and I quote, ‘yummy.’ ” A feeling that Feruza clearly did not share, but Harry was oddly touched by how much she seemed to care about presenting the case of Ginny’s fantasy to him, as discomfiting as the gesture might be.
Once Feruza had left, Draco promptly became much more interested in playing with Harry’s ears. “Such funny little skin flaps,” he chortled as he flicked them back and forth. “Why do humans even grow them?”
Harry nodded without knowing what exactly he was getting into, although he suspected it would feel incredible. “I trust you, Draco.”
Thanks to Kbrick for brainstorming on the chapter title! (Besides the usual excellent beta-ness, of course). And thanks to all of you for joining me on this weird little journey through my first contribution to the fandom. Who knows where we’ll all be once the worst of the pandemic has subsided, but for now just know that your clicks, kudos and comments were appreciated.
Harry did not know, but he murmured thanks and paid with his Muggle credit card, which had been magically linked to his account at Gringott’s during the transition to Muggle living. Several hours later, he had come up with a new plan. Instead of trying to catch Malfoy at work, he would try asking his friends at the Ministry of Magic if they could find out where he lived. It had been a few months since he’d reached out to Mr. Weasley or the others, but he figured it couldn’t hurt to ask, in the interest of unity.
“My mother insisted that I take dancing lessons as a child, in preparation for the Yule Ball, and any other social functions I might be required to attend. The disco moves I learned more recently, after I moved here. Turns out boredom and lack of real friends can be a motivator for picking up strange talents.”
Ginny waved them both off and Disapparated quietly when none of the passersby were looking. Harry and Draco decided to call a taxi rather than attempt to take the Tube, which was probably filling up with Friday night merrymakers by then.
Draco wondered if he should object, but the prospect of Harry tutoring him in powerful magic was appealing enough that he decided not to say anything. Instead, he rose from the bed and Levitated the tray out of the way while he straightened the covers. “I’m going to bathe first, but feel free to get started while I’m at it.” His eyes swept over Harry’s mostly naked body for one more heart-stopping moment before heading toward the loo.
She flung an incredulous look at him. “You think? Well I’m thinking that they’re crazy, which means they won’t have any problem shooting anyone who gets in their way. I’m Apparating back and putting up a Shield Charm as soon as I get there.”
“I’m sorry, I knew we shouldn’t’ve stayed up so late.” Draco did look mildly penitent, and Harry’s eyes were drawn to his lips, steamed coral by the warmth of his drink. The memories of the night before surged back into his brain, and he was suddenly very interested in getting a better look at Draco with no clothes on. Or possibly finding out what those lips felt like on other parts of his body. Harry could feel a rising reaction between his legs, and hastened to find a way to guide his mind away from treacherous territory.
Hermione did not seem to know what he was talking about, so he explained a little further. “After the Battle of Hogwarts, his family was basically exiled from their usual social circles. They were technically acquitted, but Draco had a rough go of it while he finished up his eighth year, and he decided to continue his studies by enrolling in a Muggle immersion program, so he could prove for once and for all that the Malfoy family were willing to cooperate with the new Wizarding order. He’s basically been living as a Muggle for the past year, although he can still do magic at home.”
Harry had gotten used to the designer references by now, and smiled at that. “You should probably lay off on the swearing, but I’m pretty sure you can wear whatever you want.”
Harry opened his mouth to correct him, but Mysteria swept in before he had a chance to set the record straight. “School chums, how sweet. You must have some catching up to do.”
Harry reoriented himself so she could see his face, half smothered by fluffy blue terry cloth. “Yeah, I did. I should probably try and work a charm to stop the bleeding though, or at least keep it from getting infected.”
“Hullo, Harry.” Nigel offered a hand to shake, and held onto Harry’s hand a bit longer than necessary. “It’s a pleasure to see you again, under more casual circumstances.” He spoke with a slight lisp that would have been almost charming, if Harry hadn’t just seen him finishing Draco off moments before.
Draco was having none of the small talk. “Doesn’t matter, I’d rather have all my magic back, my family in one piece, and live in a hovel than be restricted the way I am to this place.”
Draco clapped a hand on his shoulder. “Mate, I would gladly take a dive into being an arsehole with you. Split one and see what happens?”
The prospect both terrified and elated him, which was why he found himself dragging his feet when it was finally time to meet Draco outside the museum. He tried on all of his new clothing before settling on a cream-colored v-neck jumper over a cobalt blue shirt, then Apparated to Bankside. The weather was bright but chilly as he ran across the street to the museum, narrowly avoiding being run over by a tour bus.
“Hey, Ginny.” Harry had returned, with a glass in each hand. He gave one to Draco before leaning in to kiss her on the cheek. “Looking good, as always.”
Draco looked lost in his hospital bed, his white-blond hair practically blending in with the pale background of the pillow he was propped up on. Harry was relieved to see that he did not seem to have many bandages, although they were probably hidden underneath the hospital-issue pajamas he wore. The dark circles under his eyes were worrisome, and Harry had to restrain himself from launching forward and covering him with kisses.
Hermione’s eyes were still sparkling, but she nodded and stopped bouncing in her seat. “Go on then, tell me all about it.”
Harry imitated Draco’s movements, and once clothed, began to carry the chairs back toward the table. It was a miracle that the tea mugs were still in one piece. Harry brewed a fresh batch of tea for them both before he said anything.
.” Harry spat out his name in a passable imitation of how Draco used to say his own. It felt oddly satisfying in the moment. He wasn’t prepared for its effect on Draco however, who instead of looking hurt, or confused, or angry, almost looked as if he were – pleased?
She strode over to the loveseat and put a gentle hand on Ginny’s arm to wake her up. Ginny looked startled at first, and then her expression melted into one of relief. “Oh thank Godric, it’s you.” She struggled to move Feruza’s lolling head off her shoulder, and the new Auror helped her to stand. “Where do you want me to go, and what should we do about this gown?”
They undressed in a state of feverish disconnect, as the world around them swirled and bulged and changed shape in the candlelight that had mysteriously filled the room. Draco paused as he remembered something and looked back to the doorway, but saw no one and eventually returned to devouring Harry.
Harry’s choice was much easier: warm milk, his go-to when needing to relax at the end of a trying day. He settled into the chair next to the window while Draco surveyed the tray of juices before him, then turned a tolerant eye back on Harry and his milk. “Gone a bit overboard, have we?”
“I think what prompted it was a realization of how limiting the Pureblood view is. In terms of the bigger picture of the human race. Just think about the ingenuity of Muggles, and how they managed to build up their world despite not having magic available to them, in the Wizarding sense of the word. Instead, they learned to look ever closer at the natural world, and to find logic and meaning in the patterns that seemed governed by the gods and planets in ancient times.” He sensed Harry’s eyes upon him, and tried to arrive at a clear point. “I guess what I’m trying to say is, Muggles have magic too, even if it looks different from what we have. And I wanted to learn more about it.”
After he reached drinking age, Harry knew it was time to change course when he found himself waking up in unfamiliar locations, sometimes public, sometimes private, in which he was sometimes clothed, sometimes not.  Ginny didn’t know how bad it was at first, but by time she found out, while in the midst of adjusting to her own skyrocketing career, Harry was already planning out his recovery, in the form of deliberate re-immersion into the Muggle world and removal of all substance abuse from his lifestyle. He had found his flat through Muggle means and had all but moved in by time she realized that he was serious about taking a break from his life, and Godric bless her, she was understanding of his decision. His stealth, however, had cost them their relationship. Thank goodness it hadn’t cost their friendship.
Draco found the bitter pill of her words hard to swallow, but he knew she was right. Damn, she thought of
The chill followed them through their journey across London, and seemed to have settled into Draco’s home once they arrived there. Besides getting held up at the turnstiles, Draco had done an admirable job of navigating, and Harry felt almost familial in his pride.
, Harry thought. “No, Hermione, I’m not seeing anyone dangerous. What does that even mean?” He shook his head quickly. “Never mind, don’t answer that. The thing I’m trying to say is – that – well, that I’m seeing a him. A man.”
“Oi, Malfoy!” He turned his head quickly in the direction of his name, startled. It was Ginny, dressed in royal blue, who walked up to him. “Fancy seeing you here, I thought you were banned or something?”
Harry wiped the grease off his hand and shook Brandon’s, which was warm and exerted just the right amount of pressure. “It’s Harry. Nice to meet you.”
Draco leaned forward until his full weight lay on both arms, his long hair swishing forward along his cheekbones. “Say that to me again,” he purred in a low voice.
Harry shushed him and carried on. “Anyway, we started doing more stuff together – shopping, flying, things like that – and it gradually turned into something more – “
She shot him a surprised look. “Of course.” She leaned in a little closer to tell him, “You know, if being at home alone is a bit much right now, you’re welcome to stay with Ron and me.”
“Look, you can take us out, treat us to dinner or something. The hour’s almost up, I need to get to work soon.”
Harry felt that it would be rude to say no, and so he followed the stranger. The first place they visited was a bar with a dancefloor that seemed to be devoted mostly to hits of the 80s, with occasional bouts of glitter descending from the ceiling. Harry didn’t see Malfoy anywhere, but that didn’t prevent him from acquiring several phone numbers, tucked into pockets both front and back, as he wandered through the heaving ocean of people and brushed glitter out of his hair. He felt flattered but relieved to leave, once the stranger had finished making the rounds.
“All right, what do you want to know?” He settled into a chair across from the couch where Draco had sprawled himself.
It wasn’t his plan to fall asleep on the couch that night, but he did, consequently falling off and waking himself up at an ungodly hour. Heart still racing from the dream that had sent him tumbling, he reached out to turn on a light, then paused. Who was it that had made an appearance in the dream? He had a vague memory of being outdoors, sitting next to a pale someone who was Levitating an object in his hand. Harry’s dream vision focused sharply upon the figure, who transformed before him into a young Draco as he had seen him when they first met at Hogwarts, hand extended as if in friendship. Meeting his eyes, Harry felt something unfamiliar stir to life within his chest. Rather than the usual nightmarish sensation of icy terror, he felt a different terror instead, imbued with warmth and trembling.
Carried away by his thoughts, he noticed belatedly that Harry had switched topics and was asking him a question. “Sorry, what?”
“I thought you’d never ask,” purred Draco. He'd managed to keep most of his clothing on during both card games, and was ready for a change of scenery. “How much should I take, as a first-timer?”
Draco was on a mission, and contrived to play something of everything. He had music from each decade, mostly from British and American artists, with a few wild cards thrown in. Harry put up with his ongoing commentary as he rotated out records, but by time they got to the end of the seventies, he was starting to get antsy. When Draco put on the Bee Gee’s “Staying Alive,” Harry couldn’t resist moving to the beat a little. Draco looked him over with amusement, then broke into a flowing sequence of movement that would have made Travolta’s jaw drop. It took some slow-dancing to “How Deep Is Your Love?” before Harry was able to recover.
“Since we became friends, you silly bint.” Draco had reemerged with a vengeance, dressed in the same clothes as yesterday, which was a first. His hair was still drying in waves around his face, giving him the paradoxical look of a Nordic metalhead dressed in designer loungewear.
The last step was talking to Hermione. Draco balked at the idea at first, but Harry insisted on getting her opinion and any advice she might have about how to approach the interview. She was also their source for invitations, as Harry had been advised against asking for the invitations directly. It would look too attention-seeking to anyone who might be inclined to criticize, said the publicity consultant. Even the Daily Prophet, which had agreed to the requested interview straight away, might not view it in a positive light.
“No, it’s not like that, Harry. The thing is, we couldn’t see how you could move on from someone like Ginny without wanting to try something completely different. Someone more under the radar. Not that there’s anything wrong with being over the radar about it! I’m sorry Harry, this is coming out all wrong.” She stopped herself and took a deep breath. “What I’m trying to say is, whether you want to express yourself as gay, or bisexual, or any other identity, we’re on your side.”
Mysteria leapt in to save him. “Why don’t we get him a mocktail.” It was a statement, not a question, and Draco sought revenge by ordering Potter the fruitiest mocktail possible, embellished with an umbrella. Potter hardly batted an eyelid when the drink arrived, turning his attention back to Draco after his first sip.
Harry swallowed. “Um, because he’s too pretty?” Ginny’s face twitched in disbelief, and Harry backtracked. “I’m sorry, let me rephrase that. I’m not sure if Hermione filled you in, but Draco and I are dating now?”
Harry tried not to look too hot and bothered about it, but Draco noticed his expression and laughed a little. “Feeling a little differently about our schoolboy rivalry, are you?” He began to dress himself then, sweeping a hand over his groin with a quick cleansing spell before putting his silk boxers and wool trousers back on. “Don’t be too flattered, I don’t think there was anything sexual behind it. Maybe the beginnings of attraction in some form, once we got past puberty. But then, well, as you know, we were both busy with other things.”
“Hermione, calm down. I didn’t have a thing for anyone back then, besides Cho and Ginny. This is a new development for me, I swear.”
Draco brought it up again anyway, once they had gotten into the magically concealed limousine provided by the Ministry. Rather than attempting to Apparate or Side-Along, it was easier to keep a bodyguard nearby for Harry’s protection, which was most definitely needed given that it was his first public appearance in over a year.
Harry found himself obeying, even as he felt vaguely insulted at being commanded like a dog. Any protest he might have had died on his lips as he felt a familiar sensation of warmth and wetness surround his cock. Draco’s mouth undulated like a sea serpent upon him, and Harry couldn’t hold back groans of pleasure as the sensation carried on, relentlessly. Just when he thought he might be at the point of climax, Draco removed him from his mouth and slid himself up the length of Harry’s body till their hips aligned. He brought his lips to Harry’s ear and whispered, very low, “Do you trust me now?”
Draco inclined his head in agreement. “What do you know, maybe there’s something to be said for this friendship deal. Now that we are – you know – friends.” He could have cursed himself for how inane he sounded, but Harry didn’t seem to mind, in fact he was smiling.
He didn’t dare try to rearrange the neat rows of trousers and shirts, hung according to color and material, choosing instead to shift them from side to side as he searched in the gloom. Grabbing his wand, he Lumosed while poking through militantly aligned ranks of shoes, and Levitated while prodding through stacks of jeans and drawers of socks, to no avail.
Draco couldn’t help but smirk a little. “Yes, I imagine meeting Feruza would be a bit of a shock for someone like your Weasley.”
She was wrong, it stung a lot. Harry bit back groans of pain as she poured, wiped, and cleansed as gently as she could, with gloved hands. “You’re doing great, I’m just going to put the ointment on next, then wrap some gauze and have you keep pressure on it for a little while. It’s not bleeding too badly, we probably won’t need to call a Mediwizard unless you really want to.”
Young man, he corrected himself, as he looked over Malfoy’s outfit. Harry did not know much about fashion, but he knew enough to appreciate Malfoy’s care for detail, down to the tasteful leather shoes and loosely buttoned jacket. Hell, he looked
Harry blushed to the roots of his hair, which was growing damp with sweat in the semi-tropical environment of Draco’s home. “D’you think it matters if I take the Z or not? 'Cause I’m going to need something to get me through this without feeling like a complete arsehole.”
Feruza finally spoke, with an accent Draco couldn’t place. “Who is this brother of yours, and when can I poke fun at him too.”
He had to remind himself of the uncomfortable conversation he’d had with Narcissa Malfoy when she had showed up the morning after he stayed with Draco at the hospital. She had coldly informed him that she didn’t trust Harry enough to keep Draco out of trouble while he was in such a tenuous position. To her, it was important that Harry stay away until Draco was proven innocent. The tone in her voice was as close as Harry had ever heard to begging, even while she looked at him with distaste. He suspected that she might have been behind the pulling of the Prophet interview, with the help of mysterious ties to the media circuit, which meant that she most likely knew about the relationship between him and Draco already. It was only out of respect for Draco's wishes that he held himself back from dismissing her entirely.
