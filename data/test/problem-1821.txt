“We're... What?”  Draco shook his head, starting to reach for Harry's arm again.  “Stop it, we need to get you out of here.”
They were sitting at Grimmauld Place in front of a roaring fire while snow pelted down around the house outside.  Already the atmosphere had changed since the last time Draco had been there.  There was no bleakness to it, no dingy and grubby look.  Everything looked new and looked more cozy.
Paul?  Oh Paul Hollywood. The judge.  One of the judges, anyways.  Get it together Draco, you know who that is.
They were standing in McGonagall's office, facing down Snape for the absolutely abysmal marks he'd given Harry for the impeccable essay they had written, while Draco's doodle covered mass of nonsense had earned top marks.
Both boys were quiet for awhile, neither of them liking the idea of having to go back to life as it was before.
Draco laughed with her, putting the pan down and wiping his hand on a tea towel.  "I don't even mean to, I think he just doesn't like me."
Harry returned to the library table that was tucked into the farthest corner of the library.  Hidden behind almost all of the shelves, the only way anyone would see you back here is if you needed something from the stacks behind the table.
Harry knew Draco was kind of the one who understood appearances and what you did for them better than anyone.  His whole life had been like that.  His parents lives had as well.  But he shook his head rather vehemently.  "Maybe my 'fine and quaint and comfortable life' doesn't include any of those things.  I don't see why it has to and I don't see who's business it is what I do with my life now.  I've done my job, I fulfilled the prophecy or whatever.  It's done."
Draco raised one hand, pushing it through his hair, a nervous gesture Harry recognized that preceded Draco saying something he was uncomfortable letting past his lips.
But unluckily for Borgin, he doesn't know that he's become a little sensitive to dairy in his later years, and the ring was making him think about whether or not he should continue eating the cheese he always has with lunch every day.
Draco was thinking about that episode again as he walked through the doors of the towering office building one weekday morning.  He kept thinking about it as he stepped into the elevator, glancing behind himself politely before he moved back towards the people who had got in first.
Harry couldn't help but smile a little bit as Draco spoke, which ended up earning him another rough shove and a dirty look, which made him laugh.  “Alright alright.  I'm sorry.  You're right... I should have just let him insult you and not tried to be a knight in shining armour there to defend your honour.”
The former clapped her hands together and smiled in absolute delight.
And that Draco did not, as it happens, want his mother to try and find a second wife for him.  That Astoria was a lovely girl but she was a
--------------------
He couldn't help but smile a little bit, his arms loosening and then unfolding from around his chest.  He straightened up and started looking into the windows of the shops that they passed by, rather than watching the people and waiting for them to react to him.  He lingered at each one, not stopping but slowing his steps to look in, and Neville slowed with him.
Draco turned so red he could feel it burn in his cheeks and his ears, absolutely fuming mad.  He wanted to turn around and leave but then Harry would well and truly win.  And after the dark haired boy had gotten him detention, no part of Draco wanted to give him any more victories.
"Fine, fine..." Harry smiled, waving his hand a bit towards Hermione.  "You can talk me through it all after dinner and tell me what you think an appropriate offer would be."
Draco sighed as Harry set the box down with the others and straightened up to meet Draco's gaze, smiling up at him as he pushed his hair back from his forehead.  “I thought for sure we'd have our work cut out for us keeping you here once you saw it.”
The first couple of years had been a nightmare.  These envelopes and messages wormed under doors, popped out of drawers like toast, and repeatedly banged themselves against the windows of rooms he was inside when there was no fireplace to come through.  He eventually moved specifically to a flat WITH a fireplace so that he could stop worrying about getting the messages while he was at work or out in public.  There was only so much he could do to explain away that weirdness.
“That’s correct, Professor.” He said with a small nod, sitting down at his desk once more.  “Is there something wrong with that?”
Potter always did have to have the last word.
The Muggle World is proving to actually be a little better than Draco had thought....
“Sorry, I have to get back.  I didn't realize how late it was.”  Draco said, refreshingly casually instead of incredibly put on in case anyone was still, somehow, listening.
------------------------------------
"Oh it was wonderful."  Draco's smile turned a little dark as he seemed to warm further to the subject at hand.  "The first night I was back I made it clear to my mother that I needed to speak to him.  That I had very important and personal information to relay to him that only I could tell him.  But my Aunt Bellatrix was there, and I think even you know how.... Intense she is about him and being the 'right hand' sort of thing."
"Oh who cares..."  Harry said, grinning at Draco and tugging his tie a little harder.  "It's one night.  It'll be so crowded people won't know who's there with who and who's talking to who."
Harry- Of course I do.
A cold sweat bathed him under the light blankets, but he grabbed at them, pulling them higher and clutching them against him like they were the only things that were keeping him there.
“Ah!” Harry laughed, pointing at Draco as he explained.  “There it is.  The proper angle and response I was expecting.  Well alright, you don't need to learn washing up, but cooking you do.  Or at least how to use a phone and order delivery.”
"Not planning on it.."
that could be done.  This tawdry, pokey little flat was the
"You have a point..." Harry said slowly after a few moments, his tone so relaxed and easy that Draco couldn't help feeling not only relieved but also soothed by it.  "So what do we do?"
The past month had been good fun at first, but as the weeks went on, Harry started to feel agitated with everyone.  At first Ron and Hermione hadn't wanted to listen to him talk endlessly about what had happened at Borgin & Burkes.  They didn't agree with him that Draco was up to something nefarious.  Or that he could possibly be a Death Eater.  They thought it was just Malfoy being Malfoy.
But he sat while Harry showed him how to search for apps and how to add them to his phone.  He listened while Harry explained how the apps worked, how to look for different food to order.  He let the other man set up his account for him with his address and phone number and information, even though he felt like he could have done it himself with some basic instruction.  Then he took the phone back from him, now feeling rather stupid and useless himself.
“Draco..”  Harry stopped, struggling with the other boy for just a moment to actually get him to quit trying to drag him out.  “We're dreaming.”
And then.
"Sure."  Harry agreed, smiling a bit as Draco turned and headed across the bridge and back towards the castle.
Refocused, re-grounded and reaffirmed.  He always looked forward, never back.
"Oh yes.  Of that I am quite sure."
Embarrassed.
Guilt coursed through him, as it had with each letter he had received in the past two and a half weeks.  He hadn't replied to any of them even though he had desperately wanted to.
They went up a flight of stairs and then down a hall before Harry knew where they were going, so he wasn't surprised when he had to trail Draco up and down the stretch of hall three times before he stopped in front of a door that looked remarkably out of place.  Harry followed him inside once Draco had the door open and took in a breath as he looked around.
-----------------------------
Draco nodded, smiling at the other boy.  "Yeah that's good.  Hey..." He leaned forward a bit so he could see Harry more clearly.  "You don't expect me to go easy on you when Slytherin plays Gryffindor just because we're friends now, do you?"
"WHAT?"  Draco immediately turned his head to sniff against his own shoulder, his cheeks going pink.  "What are you talking about?"
knew the right information and if I knew it then he should have as well.  It was all stuff about you or Dumbledore. " Draco turned his head to look at Harry, unable to help smiling at the black look on his face.
Love you all, appreciate you all, hope that you're all doing well.  And if you're new here and new to this fic I love you, appreciate and hope you're doing well, too!
Draco watched Harry as he raged.  The longer the other man yelled and the more he said, the higher Draco raised his chin and the more firmly he set his shoulders.  By the time Harry paused for breath, Draco had gotten to his feet and could have easily doubled for an ice cube in any freezer.
"Sorry."  Draco smiled faintly, moving to stand next to Harry, a scarf wound around his neck and his own hands in his pockets.  "Why are we meeting here?"
"I absolutely could.  I didn't say I would actually bake, like for real.  I just said I could make these things."  Draco gestured at the tv screen, scooping up a handful of popcorn as he brought his hand back.
"Collect?"  Draco leaned against the wall, tucking the parchment into his pocket.  "What do you mean?"
Draco now lived in the Muggle world.  Something he never thought he would ever ever have to even consider.  But at the end of the war it honestly seemed like the only thing he COULD do.
He never thought he'd have to learn non-verbal spells to BAKE.
"So Draco Malfoy is super gay..."
Harry- None of you were supposed to have phones for ages yet.
“Not going to happen.”
Draco stopped nodding.  Shook his head instead.  Good good.  All proper answers.
"Same reason I bet you're trying with every bit of personal strength you have NOT to look down at me right now."  Harry said, one side of his mouth curving up again.
Slightly intimidating, actually...
"I'm just agreeing with you!"
But rather than bother snapping back at the other man, Draco turned his attention to the boxes, opening the one closest to him to rummage inside with no actual purpose other than something to keep him occupied.
“Don’t start that again.”
“Tea?”  Harry asked, flipping through a menu.  “Coffee?  Chips?”
"You don't....?"
Harry paused, shaking his head a bit and Draco heard him let out a soft sigh.  Instinctively he reached over, touching the side of Harry's knee without looking at him.  A small gesture and connection of solidarity.  That he understood... Because he really did.
Draco took his phone out of his pocket and showed it to the young man who immediately smiled and nodded.
“Electronics.”  Neville said, looking in the window next to Draco, chuckling at the blank look he got.  “It's sort of an all encompassing term for anything that requires power to be used.  It used to be for things that required electricity, which is what makes your television and the lights in your flat and the toaster and all of that work.  But there are also things that run on 'batteries'.  Which are small objects that hold power so you can use things without them being plugged into the wall.”
"Should I have just not reminded you that you wrote that to me?"
"Because I happened across him at a vulnerable moment.  And that was all it took for me to realize that whatever he was up to this year, it wasn't at all what I originally thought.  He clearly didn't have a choice.  We've been meeting since then.  I'm trying to help him."
Silence.  Draco held his breath, counting the seconds that ticked past.  Each one that went by without Harry saying anything else made fear rise higher inside of him.
And a VERY shocking piece of information....
-----------------------
"Harry, I--"
Heeeeey!  I'm back!  Working on updating some (but not all) of my current fics and maybe tossing something new in here and there as well.  I'm going to try not to have another 7.5 month absence this time.  Thanks for sticking around if you've been here before!  And thanks for coming by if you're brand new!
Fuck. FUCK.  It was bad enough to have the fact that he'd had another panic attack passed around, it had to be shared with details?
Harry couldn't help but laugh, even given the heavy weight of the conversation, he laughed as Draco hugged him, then he hugged the blonde boy back after a moment.  “What's this for?”
"....Yeah.  Maybe."  Draco replied and carried on his way.
"Fine.  I was surprised by who was there.  I guess more surprised by who wasn't."
"Whatever she has to say, whatever she's mad about.  You aren't alone.  You have me here and I'll fight for you if I have to..."
"No.."
It gave him time to try and figure out what he could and could not say to Theodore about where he was, as well as try and find out why
Draco held his breath as they headed for the next bench.  Paul kept his eyes on him as he walked away, looking at him more than a little suspiciously.
Narcissa made a noise somewhere between 'mouse' and 'strangled cat', her pale cheeks getting two very bright spots of red on them.  "If you're lying to me.."
A trip outside on his own...
For time that stretched seemingly endless the only sound in the hallway was soft slick noises, short gasps of breath, low noises of pleasure that neither of them wanted to escape and let the other one hear, and the shift of fabric grinding tightly against fabric.
"Mm.  It is.  And you don't have to hang around with people you absolutely can't stand anymore.  You don't have to go home with Ron for Christmas."  Harry flopped down on the couch again with a frustrated noise, sending a cloud of dust up sparkling into the light.
Harry couldn’t help but smile, some of the Draco he’d known in school was leaking out in those words.  Not wanting to give the upper hand to Harry even if there wasn’t truly an upper hand here.  “That’s no trouble at all.  We can write whenever needed on this or anything else that needs discussion.”
He tucked it back into his pocket, now the owner of it rightfully, only then did he look towards the train again, towards his son who he smiled at so warmly, waving as the child waved vigorously to him.
He would have slept through much of the day after as well, but sometime mid-morning he woke up smelling coffee.  Making a noise of annoyance, he turned over in bed and pulled the blanket up over his nose. Neighbours, he decided, were not fun when you shared walls and had to smell their cooking as well as hear their conversations, arguments and which television programs they favoured.
“Of course.”  Harry said with a smile, nodding at her.  “We can sit at the back, no one will easily see us.  If he wants to see me or something I'll just tell him I've got to catch up on homework.  Which... Actually isn't that much of a lie.”
"Mm..  When we were here the first time, there was a Boggart in that desk."  Harry said, moving halfway across the room and stopping.
Ron had been right, for the most part.  Him buying Malfoy Manor was a piece of information that spread like wildfire in the Wizarding Community.  But it was largely seen as a positive thing.  He was praised for doing such a noble and humble thing towards preserving the history, and praised for being so brave to purchase a place that likely had terrible memories for him.
Harry – I gave you what you need to live on for months! You aren't paying your rent or bills or anything, how could you need more money?
Harry held his hand out further, wiggling it a bit in invitation for Draco to take it.  "It's yours."
He chanced a look back at Harry again when the silence stretched, and couldn't help but smirk at the absolutely perplexed look on his face.
"I was going to say you could still apologize, but I get the feeling you've already done that so many times the words have lost all meaning."
And he had used magic to unpack... But no one could possibly fault him for that. Who had the time or energy to take one thing from a box, put it away, then do that again hundreds of times over.  He could think of a million better ways to spend his time.
“Then for once, Potter, we're on the same page.”
This memory was sharp.  Incredibly vivid and seemed realer than real.  The other memories he had seen had seemed perfectly clear and normal but it wasn't until he walked into this one of Tom's that he realized that others had been ever so slightly out of focus.
Harry shifted then, pulling the folded map from his back pocket to hold out to Draco, then frowned when the other boy didn't even look at it.  “Are you mad at me?”
"That.  Is borderline genius."
"I should ask YOU that.  You aren't even a Prefect anymore, but still think you have a right to be in here?"
“We can't tell them that, though.  They'll know we did it on purpose to catch Snape out and I don't think 'entrapment of a professor' would go over so well.  It'll be one night and he won't make me do anything terrible.”
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
Both boys resumed what they were doing, and while Draco worked silently, acutely aware of his company, he still didn't have any luck finding what he was looking for.  And even though he was silent, his agitation did not go unnoticed.
It took him a moment to realize what that all meant, but when he put it together he took in a sharp breath, then made a noise of triumph.  This was the missing item from Malfoy Manor!  This was what had been sitting on the table at the door of Malfoy Manor!  It had taken a few hours for the galleon to find it's way to him, but having no idea where it was coming from he figured it made good time.
Draco laughed then, which Harry was grateful for since he could have been angry and he would have had every right to BE angry.
"I didn't realize the hat cared what we thought."  Draco said, rather liking the look of Harry lounging in the couch in his own common room.
Fuck.
Harry watched them, turning to look for his wife and his own children for a moment, then back to Draco, finding the other man facing him once more.  Looking in that moment like he had when they were in school. So strong and yet some how so broken.
Draco roused from his own thoughts, looked from the owl over at Harry and then shook his head.  “Not a word since you handed me the owl, Potter.”  He smirked, then raised one shoulder at the immensely disgusted look Harry gave him.  “Just being honest.”
They both got up, trying to move slowly and like they really didn't want to leave.  Which was true, but also Harry knew that both of them kind of wanted to bolt out of there and separate from the conversation they'd been having that was clearly of interest.
So...  awkward.
"Not even a leg up in the Goblet of Fire?  You didn't have to tell Cedric about the dragons."
"You're being a prat."  Harry said, but he smiled a bit as he said it.
"Fuck off, Potter."  Draco grumbled, knowing that he really didn't have any true reason or privilege to be in there, but not wanting to admit it.  Especially not to Harry.
"It's a family name."  Draco said, pulling the spoon out of the mixing bowl with a bit of effort.  "It is a little old fashioned."
Draco shook his head, making a face.  "He's already too tangled up in this with no proof of what he's going to do to help.  This has to be separate."
Harry explained in more detail rather than in a rush of words as he had started with, wanting to get everything out at once so Dumbledore couldn't stop him.  He told him about Draco going to Snape but neither of them knowing what he was planning, (though he left out how annoyed they both were at Snape's secrecy), explained about the safe house cottage and how they wanted to get a message to Narcissa to tell her to go there.  That Draco needed an owl that had no ties to him what so ever, a way to destroy the message to Narcissa after it had been sent.  And that Draco, potentially, needed to leave Hogwarts a little early in order to avoid being put back into the clutches of the other Death Eaters.
“He can't be that far then...  I haven't a clue where we are here but if you found him and got a reply back already, he must be close..”
By the time the installation was finished and Draco had closed the door behind the Auror who stayed an extra five silent minutes to ensure the Muggle was gone, he didn't even want to try out anything on the internet.  Instead, he went to bed and pulled the blankets up over his head.  It had only been early evening, but his simultaneously hyped up and worn out brain conked out almost immediately.
Harry chuckled.  Very softly but he chuckled all the same, and it made Draco smile even though he desperately wanted not to.
“I sit out in the castle at night a lot.”  Draco said eventually, looking at the floor and the wide squares of moonlight that fell across it at regular intervals up the hall.
He should have, as he already had noted, expected the nightmares.
And a surprise visitor...
“I thought they sounded quite.... useful...”  He said just as quietly back to Tom, but he smiled a bit.  Just a bit.  Just enough that was probably much like the look the slightly younger Tom had when Slughorn had explained to him about them.
to me he would tell me everything and I thought he did.  But then this year he's started calling me for one on one meetings and stuff.  And he starts giving me all kinds of new information.  He says that he told me everything he KNEW and that now we're looking at and gathering information from other sources where we don't know for SURE.  Like that makes such a huge difference..."
“It comes with practice...  And I think it differs a little bit depending on the person and depending on their skill level.”  Draco sat down next to Harry and smiled, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck.  “I feel it up the back of my neck, just here.  Like someone is slowly trailing and icicle up the middle of it.  I know from experience that I have until the 'icicle' reaches my back hairline to shut them out or they'll see something.”
"It doesn't smell odd, it smells good."  Harry said with a slight frown, lowering his head to sniff close to the surface.
She swept to the door then, Draco following after her without saying anything.
Harry shook his head, making a face.  "Not yet.  Not that it matters.  I could spend ten hours writing the essay to absolute perfection, but Snape would still give me the same grade as if I spent an hour just writing "chocolate frog" over and over again and handed it in."
Draco chuckled, mollified by that since it was, to him, the most important part.  "Sleep well."
“So it really was the Vanishing Cabinet after all.”  Ron said, leaning back into the couch as he stared at Harry, shaking his head back and forth slowly.  “Blimey...  And you're sure that he didn't really need the ring? Did you ask him?”
“I was looking for Dobby.”  He said, then laughed at the look on Harry's face.  “I weirdly dream about him a lot.  But he was the one I talked to here most when I was a kid.  He annoyed me half to death but he was friendly.”
they are?  Anywhere in the castle?”  Draco spoke quickly, not realizing that there was a blatant note of panic in his voice as he looked at Harry.
He'd been half out of his head during sixth year, grasping at anything he possibly could as a sign, a symbol, an omen of good fortune.  Finding this Galleon, he'd immediately believed it would bring him good luck.  He used the idea for himself in a way to try and carry out his horrible 'mission' in sixth year, and continued carrying it everywhere with him until after Voldemort was vanquished.  After that it had sat in his bedroom on his dresser until he had started taking things from around the Manor.  Deciding he wanted to take it with him- who knows when you might need some good luck, after all-  he'd set it on the table in the entry way, then scooped it up as he went out the door for the last time.
It was like the house had held it's breath and stopped time on the inside.  Looking at the table just inside the door, there were clear streaks in the thin layer of dust that looked just like someone's fingers had scooped up a set of keys or a wallet before stepping out the door.
And then Neville and the mystery person walked towards the building doors...
"I don't honestly know.  He hasn't ever given me a straight answer about important things.  He says it's to better understand you, but given that he's not once ever told me the whole truth about anything, I doubt that's the only reason."  Harry couldn't keep the slightly angry and bitter tone out of his voice as he talked about Dumbledore and his secrets.
“I wanted to talk to Draco about Scorpius.  Nothing bad, but something I felt would be best and most kindly handled face to face.”
“Sorry!!  Sorry sorry...  Merlin, I'm really not doing well, am I.”  Neville laughed awkwardly, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck.  “Alright just... Bear with me.  Before I came to your protection team permanently, I was helping some of the others settle in.  Most of them DID use their wands for everything, so I just assumed...”  Neville shook his head, sighing and smiling a little more sheepishly.  “I shouldn't assume.  I'll teach you about the cooking things, but you'll need to come over here.”
Harry chose not to comment on that.  That was an argument for another day about who did and did not deserve protection.
Hard.
"No, SOUTH."  Harry said again,  then moved over towards Draco, coming right to the telescope he was working at.
"Big fancy way of saying you don't WANT it to stop."  Harry smirked back at the blonde, still holding tightly to him.
Draco stayed quiet for a few moments, his head reeling and feeling short of breath.  He sat down on the couch, turning the parchment over on his knees.  He looked into the fire and stayed like that until his heart slowed and his thoughts became linear and easy again.
Astoria wouldn't be able to date anymore.  Scorpius would grow up with the terrible Malfoy influence Draco had so carefully tried to keep out of his life.
"I think the relief of not having to live together makes it easy for us to pretend when we have to.  We spent more than a few years living together and pretending that everything was fine.  It was a relief to actually split the way we did.  No drama, no family craziness.  We just went our separate ways and get on fine when we need to pretend."
With a short breath to steady himself, he raised his hand and knocked, a small part of him honestly hoping it would go unanswered.  But presently he heard the slide of a bolt and then the door swung inwards, the black cloaked figure of Snape revealed on the other side.
"Hello, Draco is it?"
People ran up and down between the benches.
He should have anticipated having a nightmare.  The day before had been... tense...
"Yes, Harry, that sounds like a good idea."  Hermione said, her tone measured as she watched every single shift of expression and thought behind Harry's eyes.  "In fact, if you're serious I could always put forward your intent to purchase and see if perhaps you can avoid public auction.  We haven't even been that convinced it
“Just a moment.  I know what you should get.”
"How's Astoria?"
And his scar burned like a bright line of fire on his forehead.
"Draco I swear to every god there is and some that don't even exist that if you don't open this door I will break it down."
"Professor Snape...  I need to speak with you."  Harry said, working to keep the grudging and hateful tone out of his voice.
"Looks like it."  Harry said, his eyes turned down, looking at Draco's pale fingers against him, his own hand sliding more firmly onto the back of his hip.  "But you should talk to Snape.  We need more information."
But, if he was honest, those would have been the only things he truly cared about right now anyways.
Harry had made the right choice not to take him with a mind as fickle as his was.
"What??"  Ron dropped his fork and knife with a clatter, leaning forward a bit.  "Why would you WANT it?"
Harry– Surprisingly, a lot of people.  But I assume this is 'Potter' said rather snidely.. Draco?
----------------------------------------
Draco couldn't help but smirk, so very tempted to change his mind and let Harry continue feeling utterly useless, but his desire for information came out a step ahead.  “Teach me how to use Uber Eats or Skip the Dishes or Door Dash.  I see commercials for them all the time and they talk about using the apps.  Longbottom took all the apps off my phone, which was fine since I still don't really understand what an app is, but it would be nice to be able to order food and have people bring it to me.”
“I'll go to the library tomorrow.”  Hermione said, then glared at Ron before smiling at Harry.  “It would be helpful if you two came along to help.”
Draco jerked his head up and looked into the genial, grinning face of one of the hosts.  Noel.  His name was Noel.  He knew that!  He blinked a smile onto his face and laughed, bumping the heel of his hand against his forehead, miming being an absolute dunce.
“I haven't but... Dumbledore was wearing it this summer when I saw him.”
"Why did you help me?"  Draco asked, his eyes slightly narrowed, immediately trying to read Harry's motive in this situation.  "You could have just let me give up and fail the assignment."
Harry made an annoyed noise that Draco knew had to do with Snape interrupting, not with him being a dutiful student.  He broke away from Harry's grasp and threaded his way over to Snape who glowered further the closer he got.  "What is it, Professor?"
There was never enough air when this happened.
"You ASSHOLE!'  Draco screamed at the other boy when he realized who it was.  He smacked both hands on Harry's chest, roughly pushing him backwards.
Draco half raised one shoulder and tilted his head towards it, as though silently saying 'so you say', but he didn't interrupt Harry again.
Draco swallowed again, wiping the back of his hand over his mouth.  He could feel Harry's eyes on him, without even looking at the other man he could tell that he was looking right at him.  He was glad for the darkness because he could feel a hot blush staining his cheeks.
Have you ever seen that episode of Supernatural where Zachariah makes Dean an executive and Sam a call centre employee?  Where they don't know each other but are working at the same company, leading completely different lives, but Sam somehow knows something isn't right?
“Certainly no need for him anymore.  Not when you and I both know he's a dirty double agent and neither of us know which side he's actually on...”
"Implied, maybe, but she wasn't awful.  And it hasn't stopped us being friends.  I could have taken her implied threat seriously and not had you back here to visit, but I didn't."
"I have nothing to say."  Draco replied to her, shifting to cross his legs and fold his arms across his chest.
"I was just... Wondering...  If your mother has spoken to you again?"  Harry asked, his eyes seemingly unable to stay on Draco's for more than a moment.
And then with a sigh he picked up his quill again and wrote what he hoped would be something Theodore would laugh at.  And would be easy to spot, provided he remembered the same things that Draco did, as something only Draco would know to say, which would help quell any paranoia about whether or not it was Draco writing.
Draco tore his gaze away from the window to glance at Harry, just enough to acknowledge him before he looked back out the window again.  “No, I don't.”
Draco moved closer to Harry and brought his wand up to touch Harry's temple, tilting his head a bit as he did.  “I am not trying to hurt you, I'm not trying to harm your thoughts, I'm not going to be inflicting any sort of bodily or mental harm on you.  I'm just trying to look into your head.  So rather than brace yourself for an attack, think of it more like someone is trying to look over your shoulder at a book you're reading, so you close it.”
Chapter 4 - Six weeks after The War, the Wizarding World is trying to sort everything out.  Trials and sentencing and pardons were being handed down almost hourly.  Harry testifies for the Malfoy's and Draco finds him to tell him the results.
“I TOLD YOU NOT TO TALK TO THE AURORS!” He shouted, pushing both hands through his hair and turning like he wanted to kick something.  “Merlin.  FUCK.  I should have expected dealing with you...  I should have been prepared for the absolute AUDACITY that could only come from a Malfoy!”
"So I was in the park not far from my Aunt and Uncle's house...  I spent a lot of time there in the park over the summer.  There and in the flowerbed under the living room window."
Snape eyed him warily for a long few moments, sizing him up, clearly processing what Harry said.  Eventually it seemed he couldn't argue with the information Harry had and he released the hold he had on his robes, stepping back a couple of paces as though a little afraid of this new player in whatever was happening.
But it wasn't nearly as real and genuine.
Harry shook his head a bit, scratching his forehead.  'It wasn't the light switch itself.  They seemed utterly baffled at the idea of having to physically walk TO the light switch to turn it on.  And you're over here sending texts and talking about wanting WiFi and needing money for electronics.”
example of why the Take Away business for food is a good idea.  I go pick up the chips and bring them to wherever we're meeting."
He could move them now, move his feet.. Get them under him, stand up a bit.
"Move.." The one word came quietly from the blonde and Harry, who had stilled his hips, pushed forward again until they pressed against the soft flesh of Draco's ass, pulling a low stifled groan from deep in his chest.
Now he was turning up to talk to him.  Joke with him.  Even poke fun at his supposed friends.
“You don't need to say anything to me about any of it.  Or anything else for that matter.”  Draco shot Harry a snarky smirk over his shoulder before he closed the cupboard and brushed off his hand.  “What did you need to come here for, aside from delivering me the money I asked for?”
Harry looked taken aback, sitting up on his stool and frowning at Draco before he got up and followed him into the living room.  “What do you mean?  You have everything you need, right?  You don't have to justify stuff.”
Never mind that Harry would have had to be in league with Voldemort to actually make this test.
“No he had other memories to show me, but told me they were as far as we could go until I got Slughorn's real memory.”
"Yes..." Paul said, his brow creasing slightly in that 'I'm not sure what I'm looking at' sort of way he got when he didn't like what a baker was doing.
This House Elf was perfunctory and not nearly as capricious as Dobby.  So when she saw the letter on Draco's desk, sealed and titled, she figured she would do Draco a favour.
"We haven't.  I think if this was last year I wouldn't have liked it.  But between Draco, everything he's said to me, and learning more about you....  I think I'm enjoying this."
“Ah..”  Draco nodded as he said the one syllable, caught off guard and not sure what exactly TO say to that.  “I'm sorry it didn't work out.”
“You said it the way it's spelled.”  Neville said with a shrug and a smile at Draco.  “You got 'Google' right at least.”
"Yeah?"  Harry shifted closer so their folded knees touched as they sat facing each other.  "I hadn't come up with anything aside from using Snape as a go-between and I don't think that's as clear cut as we want it to be."
He didn't write to Harry after he'd read it, but it hadn't stopped the dark haired man from starting to fire owls at him a couple days later.  Each one saying roughly the same thing about wanting to talk to him about it.  That he wasn't laughing at him about it behind his back.  That he'd forget the whole thing, all of it, if Draco would just write back.
Harry looked around again with a different set of eyes, taking in a small portion of Malfoy Manor, a place he had to admit he'd wondered about from time to time.
Now he's agreed to try and talk to Theodore if Harry allowed it.  Not just agreed to TALK to him, but try and convince him to go into hiding under the care of the Ministry Aurors.  Truly impossible and yet he'd said YES...
“Like Tinder.”
"What?"
"Don't ask.  Just don't.  I can't tell you, even you must realize that."
She had taken the information well, or had at least presented herself as taking it well and he was grateful for that.
“It is true.” Draco said sharply, not particularly liking to have to admit it more than once in a conversation, but unable to tell a lie about it either.  “And he knew these things long before you were a teacher here.  I wasn’t to know you’d change profession.”
Harry shrugged a bit, raising his eyebrows slightly.  "I just mean Snape's been after this position forever, hasn't he?  He's bound to be good at it, teach us stuff and maybe be more hands on.  Years of preparation for it and all..."
"Yes you are."  Narcissa said, then smiled a little more when Draco shook his head and looked at her seriously.  "Draco, I'm sure you and he have a great many things to work out and understand, but there is no part of either of you that doesn't want it.  That much is very clear.  Has always been very clear."
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
"You look good like this.  And totally out of your depth." Draco whispered to Harry,  shifting to press his hips up a bit, which pulled a groan from the dark haired boy.
"Yes."  Harry said, having to work just as hard to swallow his own animosity.  "I know it seems completely unlikely, but Draco's not exactly enjoying the task he was put up to.  He doesn't WANT to follow through with it and never did.  He's doing it because he doesn't have a choice, and I'm not exactly unfamiliar with that side of things.  I don't care where Draco's allegiances were before this, I know where he stands now."
Draco shrugged, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.  "I know about all kinds of things that I shouldn't.  Not that this in particular is that impressive."
"Snape."  Harry snorted, rolling his eyes a bit before he got to his feet.  "I should get back before Ron and Hermione turn up.  But that's another project right there."
Not the supernatural butt-kicking part of it, which is the conclusion anyone would jump to.  The part of being removed FROM the supernatural world and being inserted into the mundane.
"You're a force to be reckoned with."  Harry said with an admiring smile.  "But I did come down here to talk to you about something else.  I had another session with Dumbledore.  Just finished a few minutes ago."
"Why would I divulge customer information to you?"  Borgin spoke easily, moving behind the counter.  He kept his eyes on Harry as he went to display case, slowly unlocking it.  "Certainly if you bought anything here, you would want confidentiality, wouldn't you?"
“I suppose we'll find out.”
“What are you doing here??”  The blonde hissed at him, grabbing his arm and yanking him up the hallway while he glanced around furtively.
"Want to bet?"  Draco asked, leaning over a bit and sticking his hand out to Harry, raising both eyebrows.
Then on his thigh.
"Cherry cake in the shape of a cauldron."  He mimed the shape with his hands, then reached for the chocolate sitting nearby.  "Chocolate ganache in the cauldron itself."
“That's still young. You're young for an Auror, look at the rest of them.”
“Your youngest’s first day?”
Chapter Twelve Summary - In the afternoon after the 'dream that wasn't a dream' Harry and Draco head to the Room of Requirement to discuss what's happened.  But in the midst of the discussion, they hit upon some pretty shocking revelations, and a deeper understanding of things than they think they're supposed to have...
“I know how to do the washing up, actually.”  Draco said, smiling as he tucked his wand into his back pocket again.
"Oh Merlin, Potter.  You get away with the most ridiculous bullshit around here.  Do you know what a charmed life you lead?"
It was strange to think of Harry lonely.  The hero of the Wizarding World who couldn't walk down the street without everyone speaking to him.  Although Draco knew deep down how hollow those interactions were.  And that they probably made Harry feel even more alone because of shallowness of it.
-------
Draco laughed.  Slightly breathless from being slammed against a wall, but he laughed.
"Because the only other choice was McLaggen.   And I liked telling him Ron won the spot more than I think I'd like winning the Cup itself."
"What do you want on them?"
They stayed officially married for appearances.  They were seen out together at important social functions and to see Scorpius off at school and arriving home again.  She appeared, with Scorpius who lived with her, for holidays and was perfectly gracious and an admirable actress in making all appear well in front of family.
He didn't, really.  He didn't at ALL appreciate any of the work that had been put into this.  He would much rather be at home in Malfoy Manor right then.  Blissfully alone in it's cavernous rooms and taking his chances with this 'new power' that everyone was rumbling about.
“You do.”  Harry said, his lips pressing together until they were a thin line.  “You need to know where things are, shops and restaurants and how to use Muggle money.”
"Slightly south."
Harry spoke the two words then trailed off, pressing his lips together and shaking his head, waving a hand slightly as well.  “Never mind.  I'm not asking.”
"How was practice yesterday?"  Draco asked him, his quill scratching out a rather good little caricature of Snape himself.
Draco laughed and the tiny smirk grew into a proper one.  “They didn't have anything to do with it. Well... maybe indirectly.  They left me alone at Aunt Walpurga's years ago.  They thought she was home and they were in a rush so I was dumped and off they went.  She had a lot of books and an entire shelf that I had been told since I was a child I must never look at, so...”  Draco raised one shoulder in a shrug as he smirked even more.  “Most weren't that interesting, but one was full of the darkest spells you could imagine.  Horcrux creation was in there.”
His shoulders sagged and he exhaled a breath as he pulled his wand out of his pocket and slapped it into Harry's hand.  “Fine.  But I am not taking a tour of the neighbourhood with you.”
Draco laughed.  He couldn't help himself, and when he laughed Harry did, too.  And they laughed up the hall without looking back, half leaning on each other for support by the time they'd gotten far enough away they could stop moving.
As his emotion and excitement grew, Harry felt his scar start tingling.  He started to move his hand up to it but stopped himself when his eyes landed back on Ron and Hermione who were still arguing.  He couldn't let them see him touch it or they'd start asking about it and he didn't want to get into that 'cycle of concern' again.  Where he couldn't so much as brush his hair off his forehead without one of them asking if his scar hurt.
"He'll know."
that the changes were not that obvious.  Beaming Young Auror had been in that day and he hadn't said anything about how it looked, the closest was a remark on how fast Draco had unpacked.
Harry said he hadn't killed anyone.  Technically he was right, there was nothing Draco could argue there.  He had not directly killed anyone, but he still felt responsible for the deaths of everyone else.
Draco stayed silent as Harry spoke, and after he was finished, wrestling with this new knowledge that was clearly the truth.  He'd always thought Harry liked the attention and the spotlight, but now he wondered if perhaps it had just been said to him so many times by other people that it took over his own opinion.  Or lack there of.  "I didn't know that."
Draco couldn't help but smile a bit, looking down.  "That might not have been as bad as I led people to believe."
"Shut UP!"  Draco sloshed water at Harry who laughed at him.  He could feel his face burning again, this was so rude.
Bothered by just how much seemed to have been taken from Malfoy Manor, Harry had decided to pay Hermione a visit at the Ministry the day after his successful trip inside.  He didn't care that things were missing that could have been his.  He cared that potentially someone had managed to get inside and take things.  Or potentially Lucius and Narcissa had spent their last few days of freedom gathering up items from all over the place to hide or give to someone else.  And knowing the two of them, what they gave away or hid could be some pretty nasty stuff.
Harry supplied the word when Draco floundered a bit and smiled when the blonde boy nodded.
"And did you?"  Draco held himself a little taller, this time stepping forward towards Snape, closing the distance the older man had made, the feeling of having the upper hand making his blood run hot.
Draco picked up a pillow and smacked Harry with it, making the other man laugh.  "I won't get caught, you know I won't."
“There was... one more thing, Draco.”  Harry said, leaning over to open a drawer, he retrieved something from it and gently set it on the desk between them.
“I feel fine with it.”  Draco said, and almost believed himself when he said it.
"And that's enough space for you?"  Harry asked the House Elf, crouching down to look into the small space where Kreacher was.  "We'll get you a cushion that fits in there to sit on."
“You think?”  Draco chuckled, leaning back against the couch as his smirk deepened.  “For weeks now you've been the one helping me.  Or at least trying to.  I've been at your command and having to beg for every little thing.  Now you need my help..”
"I haven't forgotten anything."  Draco said, raising his eyebrows a bit.  He really wanted to step back, being this close to Snape was never pleasant, but doing so would have looked like weakness.  "You don't know what's going on.  You have no idea, stop pretending like you do."
“No.. well.. I don't know, actually.”  She hesitated, closing the book over her hand as she looked at Harry more directly.  “Harry...  Do you know how good Draco is at magic?  We see him do things but never that much and so it's hard to tell where he is skill wise.  You've spent more time with him since the start of school than I think anyone ever has aside from Crabbe and Goyle.  Have you noticed?”
"So all those letters you wrote to me.  Do I get to see them?"
“It was just a partial memory.  Slughorn tampered with it and reformed it before giving it to Dumbledore, but it was...”  Harry paused, watching Tom very carefully for a few moments, weighing him just as much as he was being weighed in return.  “You asked Slughorn about Horcruxes.”
He laughed hard enough that he doubled over, his arm and hand holding the wand dangling down close to the floor.
“Alright I admit it.  I am poking in your head for anything about me...  But if you think my brain isn't full of memories about YOU, you're very wrong.”  Draco stretched an arm out, jabbing the front of Harry's shoulder with the blunt tip of his wand.  “You just need to get better at this, then you can go prying around in my head.”
He'd gotten home from work about an hour earlier and had found something to eat before settling on the couch to turn on the television.  Just as he got comfortable, there was a flash of red in his fireplace and a letter shot out onto the floor.
“Well, I suppose there's no time like the present.”  The blonde said, almost too brightly as he pressed the piece of parchment into Harry's hand.  “Soon as you know anything.  Or I know anything..  We'll meet back here.”
Draco didn't answer verbally, but he did reach up and pull Harry's head in, determined this time to kiss him first and not get caught off guard like the last two times.  Harry groaned as their mouths crushed together, their kisses hard and deep.  They had kissed like this before, somewhere caught between fighting each other and wanting so much that it was practically violent.
“I have to kill someone.”  Draco looked back at Harry as he spoke, watching and gauging his reaction in minute detail.
“Who says I am?  Maybe you just have so
Only by claiming detention that night and putting on his coat to leave the Castle had he been able to get away.  He'd used a school Owl to send a message to Draco that just said 'covered bridge'.  He hoped that it had been anonymous enough to anyone who might have seen the note that it wouldn't have made sense.
And with the memory clutched tightly in his palm.
“Right.”  Harry eventually said, reaching over and closing the box again so he could get Draco's attention. “So let's get down to actually business, shall we?”
Certainly, Harry had seemed perfectly genial and even friendly (which thrilled him to no end, but no one need know about THAT) but that was just who he was.  Same as accepting his apology, he liked to find the good in everyone, he liked to be friendly.
"Sounds... Messy."  Paul said, one eyebrow lifting slightly.
"You're right."  Harry said, raising himself up on his elbows to look down at the blonde.  "Sorry, you're right, you can change your mind if you want to."
This time when Draco closed the door, he did lock it immediately after Harry left, then went to the window to watch him out the door and onto the street.  He did make a beeline for Neville (HOW was that NEVILLE...) and Draco held his breath, but the look on Harry's face wasn't anger, and though Neville's face seemed to crinkle a bit in concern, he was still smiling, so that didn't seem like he was getting in trouble.  But he and Harry did have a fairly intense conversation, and when both of them glanced up towards his windows, Draco knew what they were talking about.
"Are you not afraid?  Voldemort is actively trying to kill you, and if Draco doesn't do it he'll send someone else who definitely won't have the aversion to the task Draco does."
They walked to the main hallway together, then both turned and headed in opposite directions.  Draco to his parents and the life they needed to rebuild.  Harry to whatever it was that came next for The Boy Who Lived.
They walked away from Snape, neither of them saying anything until they were halfway down the stairs.
Draco sat up, looking at Harry with renewed interest.  "It must be good if you came down here straight away."
“Club Sandwich.”  Harry said, unrolling the napkin from around his cutlery.  “You said you didn't care, everyone likes Club Sandwiches.”
"I suppose Draco never did surface then."  Harry spoke casually, serving himself chicken and some potatoes.
"You did."  Narcissa said, smiling slightly at Draco.  "That's why I guessed.  You got along far too well and far too easily and warmly to be with each other every day."
"Tom Riddle..."  Harry said, recognizing the boy and the room all at once from the Pensieve memory Dumbledore had shared with him.
”I have reason.” Harry spit the words out venomously at Draco, leaning in against him harder, their faces a mere couple of inches apart.
"Why?" He asked, but it wasn't derisive or combative, it was a genuine question.  "I don't see anything."
Harry groaned, thumping down onto the floor.  He tossed his wand to the side and ground the heels of his hands into his eyes.
"It isn't a small task, Voldemort has made Malfoy Manor the centre of his meetings."
Draco nodded, fiddling with a button on his jacket for a moment, something on the tip of his tongue to say but he couldn't quite figure out what it was.  After a few moments he smiled again at Harry then raised a hand to wave before he turned on the spot and apparated home.
"Normally there isn't this much but whoever is behind this is bulking it out with the deliberate intention of making it confusing.  This is half, Kingsley has the other half.  We're both working on retracing the steps backwards and then forwards again to try and find the actual and real trail."
Draco jerked his head around to look at Harry in shock, making the dark haired boy realize that he'd just implied something he hadn't meant to.
He growled out a few slurred together words that were very unpleasant or complimentary, turning to walk towards the door.  “Come on then.”  He said as he pushed past the Aurors and into the hall.  “Just get it over with.”
"That's right."  He said, not thinking and sticking his spoon into the bowl to mix his batter, forgetting that the beaters were on.. "Dammit. Oh..."  He hissed as the spoon caught between the beaters and pulled from his grip, clanging around in the bowl like some sort of discordant percussion.
When Harry finally corners Draco in the bathroom with Moaning Myrtle, he expects to demand answers to his questions. But when he finds Draco in tears and absolute despair, all he can think of is getting him somewhere safe to find out what the hell is going on...
“I don't know.”  He said, raising his hands to push his hair back from his face, taking longer than truly necessary to settle all of the strands to where he wanted them to be.  “If it's Harry talking to him or you talking to him...  You won't get anywhere.  Entirely possible that anyone from the Ministry is not going to get anywhere.  Just the way he is, the way his whole family was.  Very much the 'don't trust the governing officials' sort.”
He tilted his head a bit as he lapsed off, smiling at Draco when the other boy immediately picked up where he left off.
It was a risk, and he knew it.  But if it didn't work he could try something else.  And if that didn't work.. Well Harry and the Ministry were no worse off than they currently were if that was what happened.
Draco nodded without saying anything.  He wasn't all that fond of his father as a person, not anymore.  He sure used to be, used to idolize him, used to be so proud to be his child.  But in the past few years that sort of... It wasn't like it was.  But that didn't make it easier to live every day knowing where he was now.
Harry seemed hell bent on trying to find any possible 'teaching moment' he could.  Everything he did and everything he explained to Draco seemed like it HAD to have some sort of justifiable and useful reason.
"What do you have to say for yourself."  Narcissa finally said, looking at Draco.
he going to do about Theodore?  That was a pretty weighted question, actually...
Harry didn't think twice, he pushed the door open and dragged Draco inside, slamming it behind them so it would disappear from view to the outside world.
But now...  Now he had to try and figure out what to do.  Harry was threatening to turn up at his door and he knew the other man would make good on that.  He either wrote back to him, and made it obvious that he had been not replying before this.  Or he let him come to the door and risked him being seen here and STILL come up with a reason for not writing back to him.
"What's wrong, Malfoy?"
Harry read and re-read the note, then crumpled it up until it was the size of a pea. He turned a bit and tossed it up in the air as forcefully as he could, letting it fall with an almost inaudible noise into one of the piles of junk somewhere across the room.
Harry couldn't help but smile a bit, leaning closer to Draco to speak more quietly.  "Tom is Voldemort...  Before he was Voldemort.  His real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle."
Draco took in a sharp breath, taking a couple of steps towards Harry, closing the distance between them as he looked at the bottle in his fingers.  "Liquid luck..."
Draco smiled a bit, then stepped forward closer to where Harry was standing against the wall.  The dark haired boy held his hand out again with the bottle and this time Draco picked it up.
It was really quite a marvellous thing...  A picture box where people acted out stories, like plays but you didn't have to go anywhere.  And there was a lot of what 'beaming young Auror' had said he thought was called 'special effects'.  Not magic, but almost like it in what they could make LOOK like was happening but wasn't actually real.
“Right, I did.”  Neville smiled, seeming to relax into the conversation in a total contrast to the way Draco felt his entire being prickling against it.  “End of Fifth Year, that fight at the Ministry, my wand was broken and I had to get a new one that summer.”
“Yes.”  Draco said, raising one shoulder in a half shrug before looking back at the television.  “Marvellous thing.  Never would have thought something so simple would be so good, but here we are.”
"You truly are looking for a different path to follow, it seems.  I didn't know how much I believed what Draco was telling me.  But what he said, what you asked him to pass along...  I had to know more."
“Merlin.”  Ron said, a sugar quill stuck out of one side of his mouth.  “Bet the stupid git didn't realize he was giving you more information than he thought.”
"But Bargey and Muggle Lover will certainly try your patience."
Harry watched him for a moment, his eyes narrowing as he smirked.  "You're serious.  No... You're joking."
"This is better."  Harry said, raising both eyebrows as he looked around, turning in a slow circle.  "Not what I would have expected though."
"What in Merlin's name are you so fucking angry about?" Harry asked, looking incredulously at Draco, more amused than annoyed at this point.  He'd never seen the other boy so incensed and so worked up.  He usually tried so hard to be cool and calm no matter what the situation.
“Hadn't thought of that...” Neville said, leaning back again with a pensive look. “I suppose that means that he isn't so much just avoiding our letters as he is just not opening them?”
"You should move camp tomorrow." Draco finally spoke first, not meeting Harry's eyes, though he kept his arms around him.
Harry turned to the person standing at the counter and Draco watched him as he ordered, handed over some funny looking paper that the person at the counter took, banging buttons on some contraption that dinged and shot a drawer forward full of the funny paper.  Harry's went into it and the person fished some odd little coins out of the drawer before slamming it shut and handing the coins back to Harry.
Draco shifted a bit, turning his head so he could see Harry better. "I feel like there's something more going on with this than I know about."
"You weren't directing her though?"  Draco asked, leaning in a little more.
Harry nodded, his shoulders squaring a bit in a gesture Draco had to admit he rather liked.  The other boy had gotten so broad in the past year and..
“Not so long as the Horcrux is safe.  And they're supposed to be incredibly hard to destroy, too.  You couldn't make a necklace a Horcrux and then just take a hammer to it to destroy it.”
“But with me?”
"I'm glad you didn't."  He said quietly, relaxing a little.
“Oh Draco, I'm sorry.  I knew that and I... I shouldn't have said anything.  It never occurred to me...”
"What exactly are our options?"  Draco asked, stepping a little closer to the other boy as Harry's hand drifted away from his arm.
Narcissa didn't speak right away.  She spent probably a good five minutes just LOOKING at Draco and Harry.
That stopped Harry, and why wouldn’t it? Draco practically asking for death.  Seeming to not care a bit that he was alone, held fast, and had basically admitted that he was, actually, up to something.
Later it was, when Draco was home and settled into an armchair in front of his own fire.  He took out the worn piece of parchment and unfolded it to read.
“Harry... I don't suppose Draco told you anything he had thought to fix it, has he?”  Hermione asked, running pages of the new book between her fingers as she looked at the other boy uncertainly.
Neville laughed then, straightening up and bringing some food from the fridge to the counter in front of Draco.  “Alright, you know what?  That's entirely fair.  And I'm sure with the move and everything that's been going on, you probably could do with a lot more sleep.”
He knew part of why he was so instantly needy of a friendship like he and Harry had started was just distraction.  When he laughed with the other boy he couldn't feel the lines on his arm twist and curl.
"Stupid, I think."  Harry said, smiling at Draco in a far more relaxed way.  "But it all came around in my head this summer...  I just realized that none of these people...  None of them.  Have given me much reason to fight for them."
But he set his coffee cup down and picked up the letter, breaking the seal and unfolding it to read:
"No but...  I would hazard a guess that it's Snape.  Snape's been after you all year you said, trying to get you to agree to him helping you.  And Snape is the one feeding Voldemort misinformation, right?  I bet it's him.  And Dumbledore, of course, didn't want you to know.  So Snape has just been saying that you don't need to worry, he knows how to help."
His heart stuttered.
-----------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
That could be something to think about later.
my help.”  Draco tilted his head back and to the side as he watched the other man, then let it drop forward again more naturally as he nodded.  “It's fine, Potter.  I won't use Mimir unless it's night time.  He'll understand if I tell him only to come and go at night so even if Nott's messages come during the day he won't bring them until it's safe.  I won't communicate with anyone else via owl.  And I will do my best to try and bring Nott around to the idea of what you're doing here.  I cannot promise it will be a quick job, though, and I certainly can't promise success.”
"Not really."  He replied, sitting up a bit and smiling.  "Likely seems a bit tame after the Inquisitorial Squad Umbridge had him on last year.  Reckon he'd rather be back to that.  Can't blame him."  He shrugged again, leaning forward to try and look out into the walkway, wondering when the lunch trolley would show up.
"You said you'd come in a couple of days if you hadn't heard from me."
“You saying it isn't fair and acknowledging that we should both get detention counts.”  Draco smiled at Harry, swinging his legs a little bit to bounce his heels against the wall.
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
"Because Snape will care about finding a way to stop this.  Snape won't actually WANT to kill Dumbledore, if there's a way out then..." Draco raised his eyebrows, looking at Harry hopefully.
"You couldn't help me if I did tell you."
Making up with Ron thankfully involved far less words.  Hermione explained to Ron, who came up to Harry and gave him a hard shove after lunch.  He called him a prat and then grinned at him.
"I know.  But you're here, tasked with killing Dumbledore, because I lived.  Which means that to me, you're in danger because of me.  And I need to help you."
"Thank you, Borgin."  Narcissa said with a slight and polite incline of her head.
Draco shook his head in a wide and slow back and forth motions, indicating just HOW poorly it would be received.  "I want to try and feel things out a bit, try and figure out how I can get the message across that you're helping us and what that would mean for you.  But I don't want to call too much attention to it too quickly..."
It's taking every effort both Harry and Draco have not to get kicked right out of the library as they work.  Who would have thought they'd have so much fun together?  But when secrets are revealed and an offer of help comes from a very odd source, will they manage to keep having fun?
"I'm sitting here talking to you about all of this.  Ignoring the fact that I know what side you and your family are on, the same way I'm sure you're ignoring the fact that I'm on an opposing side."
His thoughts broke off there as Draco shifted, leaning his head back enough to see Harry.  His eyes were red rimmed, wet and shining.  His hair mussed and his brow creased, but he was ever so faintly smiling.
"If you did that would be very strange for a mother."  Draco said, scratching his cheek.  "We aren't together, Harry and I.  Not really."
"Harry.. I..."
Draco- Wireless Internet.
“Ready?”  Draco said, returning to where he stood a few feet away.
Draco made a noise of frustration, half wishing he'd never agreed to even try this, even if he WAS happy to be back in touch with a friend.
He needed the deed, he'd put that into his vault but he needed that.  And he'd talk to the house this time.   Treat it like it was a person who needed to have something explained to it.  Which he knew, even to most wizards and witches, would sound strange.  But it felt right.
"Did he say how he'll help?"  Harry had to work to keep his voice level and neutral.  Everything in him screamed at the idea of trusting Snape, but he knew that Draco's dealings with him were far different than his own.  That Draco, for example, would probably be just as extremely opposed to the idea of asking Mr and Mrs Weasley for help in some matter, where Harry wouldn't think twice about it.
"I didn't think to do it, it just came out.  That's generally what happens... logically I wouldn't have thought it would respond, but the parseltongue just.."  Harry mimed a hand from his mouth outwards.  "It comes when it does."
“What are you doing in there?”
“We'd know what the chances are OF it getting fixed and how quickly it would happen.”
"POTTER!"  He yelled, the reflex of using Harry's last name when he was angry coming back full force.  "What in Merlin's name do you think you're doing!?"
Draco made a face.  He did not want to go on a tour with Harry.  He didn't want to go anywhere with Harry, ever.  But he also didn't want to starve to death or make a scene when he tried to go out and shop.  Harry was implying that the Muggle world might be a little more difficult to navigate than Draco assumed it was.
“This is one of your memories.”  Harry said, realization hitting him.  He looked up the short way to Tom's face for confirmation that he didn't really need.
Harry wasn't faring any better, having to press both hands over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud.
Before & After - Draco and Harry have one of the most convoluted, complicated, intricate and serpentine of relationships. It went on during school, it carried on after school. It stopped. And now it seems it’s starting again.
“Well...”  Draco paused, then ventured forward with a request that was very much an olive branch.   “Perhaps if I do figure out enough to buy one, you could at least help me with the very basics of setting it up?  I get the gist of plugs and electricity but it's still all...  strange..”
"What?"  Harry asked a little more vehemently than he meant to.  Accepting Draco as a fundamentally good person was one thing but Snape was a whole other.
Harry had tapped the back of the chair with his knuckles and straightened up, he nodded at the question and looked slightly apologetic.  "I want to go back and try the incantations.  I'm worried that if the missing stuff isn't in the house and someone else has it they'll start trying to move things around with word circulating that I own the place now.  We want to make sure if they're in someone else's possession we find out who it is."
"Definitely don't want to get caught with it.  I do NOT want to have to go and Obliterate an entire cast and film crew because you got caught using magic on the Great British Baking Show.
It was far more satisfying than any coffee that was produced through magic.
Both boys fell silent then, but after a couple of moment's Draco felt a warm hand rest down on the back of his neck.  He looked up curiously to Harry's face.
"I know you won't mean to and will do everything you can not to, but you can't predict everyone else's movements around you to ensure that completely."
"Just be careful."  Harry turned onto his side, facing Draco and smiling at him.  "So Show-Stopper tomorrow.  What is it you're doing..?"
Neville had taught him things, but aside from the cooking lesson which he needed to give him a fuller explanation of, he didn't push knowledge and information on him without being asked first.
Those words fell like rocks within Harry's stomach, fear threatened to make his hands shake and his knees jello as he felt the weight of what Draco was implying.  He knew things were grim for both of them.  The weight of the wizarding world landed squarely on Harry's shoulders, but the weight of Voldemort's wrath, hatred and aggression had fallen on Draco and his family.  And that load was no lighter than the one Harry carried.
"Sure, Malfoy.  Anytime.  And I actually mean that..  Just drop me a line."
Harry looked up, still smiling a bit to see Neville looking back to him anxiously, realizing the other boy had gotten ahead of him and he vaguely regretfully worked to catch up.
“Do you have a cell phone?”  The young man asked, speaking slowly and clearly like he was talking to a child.
"That's bullshit."  Harry said, frowning a bit and setting his chip box down, brushing his hands off.  "The arranged marriage thing, but also that she just assumed you'd be someone else."
Harry rolled his eyes and shook his head, leaning the side of his hip against the doorframe as he crossed his arms.  “Well clearly you've noticed that we've brought YOUR owl to you, not just a Ministry owl.”
"We don't want anyone on Dumbledore's side to find out now...  But you need to be able to get attention and maybe offer something that would be proof."  Harry frowned, thinking for a few moments before he shifted closer to Draco, lowering his voice even though they were utterly alone in this canyon of a room.  "There might be a few things...  The meetings I've been having with Dumbledore.  He's been showing me memories of people that have had dealings with Voldemort's relatives.  And with Voldemort when he was still Tom Riddle."
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
“You didn't really get your coffee.”  Draco eventually said, looking over at Neville.  “You can take some down to the street, I'm not fussed about the mugs.”
"How do you know?"  Snape hissed at him, leaning close to Harry's face, his intensity etched in every line of his face.
"It's alright, Draco..."
"Since always, really."  Draco admitted, pulling his knees to his chest and circling his arms around them.  "I fell into line with my parents because that's what you do.  I didn't question much, we didn't really have to.  Voldemort was GONE, I figured even if I wasn't sure how I felt about what he stood for, it was really a moot point.  I could say what made my family happy and that was the end of it."
Draco nodded slowly, then knit his eyebrows together as he looked at Harry.  "Who's Tom in all this?"
He picked up the pot of chocolate ganache he'd made... Well...  He'd dumped the chocolate into the pot and when it was all melted (and honestly smelled a little burnt) he poked his wand at the side of it, which instantly turned it into perfect ganache...  But he'd MADE it, all the same.  Pouring it into the cauldron, he breathed a sigh of relief, putting the pot down and moving the cake carefully to the edge of his bench.
Any lingering doubt he'd had about Harry was dissolving like sugar in water that evening.  Realizing the more he showed and told the other boy, the more he found out Harry already knew, and had never said a word about, never shared with anyone, never so much as hedged at with him until it was there in front of them both.  It was clear that even if Draco didn't understand the about face Harry had made this year, it was in earnest.  It was real.  And he could trust him.
"I don't think you could.  Not even with magic."  Harry said with a shrug, picking the popcorn out of his hair and tossing it onto the floor for the cat to bat around.
“See this???”  She said, brandishing a photo of a woman in his face.  The woman was smiling in the picture, quietly, and looking down as she smoothed a strand of hair back behind her ear.  She seemed like she didn't really want her picture taken.
And what will Draco think of his primary enemy suddenly wanting to be friends? Will he embrace the unlikely kinship?
He let out a long low breath as Noel walked away, getting the eggs out of his batter and just throwing them away.  It was a waste but he didn't want to actually touch them.  He fumbled a bit cracking the next eggs but they all got into the batter alright.
“It's just a big house..”  He said, tilting his head and looking at it slightly confused.  “It doesn't seem like one when you're inside.”
He turned on the lights in the living room as well as the kitchen and went to flop on the couch to wait for the coffee.  As he tilted his head against the back cushions of the couch, his phone buzzed where he'd left it the day before.
(Told in chapters that vary between Before the war and after the war, and varying points of view between Draco and Harry. It is not told in any sort of order, but bounces around to slowly round out.
It was Harry.  Draco shuddered out a half breath of laughter and relief, only to have Harry clap a hand over his mouth and pull him further into the tiny alcove he'd yanked him towards.  They waited silently and Draco heard footsteps, turning his eyes enough to catch sight of Snape stalking back up the hall with his ridiculous robes billowing behind him.
Harry regarded him silently for a few moments again,  then sighed out a long suffering breath before looking back to his telescope.  "Whatever."
And he was pointedly NOT thinking about that.  He absolutely was not.  Whatever had happened wasn't even his doing, it had been all stupid Harry.
"My perfect little happily ever after..."
It was on the tip of his tongue to say yes, not wanting to admit that he had, actually, forgotten.  But he didn't want to lie to Harry, not about this or anything really.  So he shook his head a bit, smiling slightly.  "No...  I remember the general idea.  I remember how badly I wanted to send it to you.  It drove me nuts wanting to make sure you got it, I just never found the courage.  Why?"
Harry said nothing, so Draco shrugged, sliding along the wall away from the dark haired boy, bending to pick up his wand as he went.  He inspected it to make sure the drop hadn’t harmed it, but also flicked his eyes to Harry who was staring at the wall, seething with anger so strong it was almost visible.
"In a way.  Not them, but they left and then went back with reinforcements from what Dumbledore said.  Your uncle and grandfather were taken to Azkaban.  Your mother was free of them and that's when she..."
Surprisingly, and only after a few days of consideration, Harry seemed to agree that the prospect of getting someone into protection that needed it was more important than barring Draco from having an owl to communicate.  And in a rare show of kindness, he actually went and got Draco's own owl from the Ministry where he was being cared for while Draco was gone.
Draco exhaled softly at what Harry said, the corners of his lips turning up just a little bit.  "Would we be friends with him?"
Harry held his breath, poking at his meal as though he was still eating and this was the most off hand conversation he'd ever had.  Not important.  It was of no consequence one way or the other if he actually bought Malfoy Manor...
It wasn't stealing when he made no secret of it and when his parents would be in jail and all this would default to him anyways.  And he would need the money he could get for pawning these items in the Muggle world.  Starting over somewhere he knew nothing about would be a lot easier if he had copious amounts of cash to throw at any problems he faced.
Watching as the owl fluttered out of the window, he sighed.  He knew his letter was odd and curt and was drawing a line at the end of this correspondence so Harry didn't have to write back.  He'd already, purely by accident, taken too much of his time with those letters.
Everyone around Draco burst into action immediately.  He looked around, watching everyone at different benches dumping ingredients into bowls.
At that McGonagall actually nodded sagely, looking thoughtful as she stood up straight.  “Quite good thinking, Potter.” She said, which was, it had to be noted, very high praise and he knew it.  “If I can be a help in any way, please let me know.”
He couldn't jump too fast into talking about the Ministry stuff.  Not knowing what he did about Theodore and his family.  Which meant, he couldn't explain where he was and why he was there, which made things complicated.  Especially since Theodore had asked him straight out.
"No worries."  Noel said, smiling even more and patting him on the back.  "I'm sure Paul likes a little roughage anyways.  He's got that look, doesn't he?"
"Sure they could, but this is more casual.  You know like... You get out of work and you don't feel like cooking and you don't want to go and sit and be proper in a restaurant.  So you get a take away and bring it home so you can sit in your comfy clothes and watch TV."
It wasn't until he was back upstairs and sitting on the couch that Draco really thought about everything that had just happened.
Harry couldn’t help but smile, looking down a bit.  “I see your point.  But somehow it does seem less rowdy than busting into people’s homes for enchanting muggle toilets.”
-------------------------------
"And I'm glad you can't.  I think most of the people in the whole world would be glad you couldn't do this.  But because you can't, Snape is supposedly taking care of it.  But right now we don't know what he's going to do.  And we don't know what Voldemort will think when Snape does whatever it is he's going to do.  Which means that getting your mother, and you, into hiding at some point might be a very real thing."
Ovens beeped as they were turned on.
"What an interesting name you have."  Prue said, all smiles and ready to bridge the gap between the bakers and Paul.
"I'll find a way to get the information...  I'd rather field questions about why I wanted to know then not have the answers."  Harry was already thinking he wasn't going to ask Hermione.  He was already thinking he needed to go much higher than that for the help they needed at this point.
Harry drawled at him, parroting back to Draco what Draco had said to him when they had detention together in the forest.
"Oh YOU'RE one to talk about behaving normally."  Harry said, pushing himself to sit upright again, waving a finger accusingly at Draco.
“I'm supposed to go to the library after dinner with them to start research.  So far everything is going as we hoped.”
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, sitting back in the chair, his arm stretched out in front of him because Harry had refused to let go of his hand.  The implication here was clear.  Draco could read between the lines easily even with the threat of his brain fogging over.
Now he felt like he was once again a tool to be used.
"Unfortunately not, there's still another floor.  But we can do it another day."  Harry said, dropping his hand down from Draco's back.
Draco's head hung forward again and Harry reached over to him, putting a hand on his shoulder.
"Really?  I have more red and gold clothing options than I care to admit.  Although, to be fair, most of them came from Mrs Weasley.  If she didn't knit me things I'd likely have the same array as you."
“Why?”  Harry leaned forward on the table, trying to catch Draco's eye while the blonde very pointedly kept his gaze averted.
“To lock the door behind you.  I know, Potter.”  Draco muttered, moving forward to push the door closed as Harry walked down the hall to the stairs. He twisted the lock before turning and thumping his back against the heavy wood of the door, trying to take in deep slow breaths of air.
"We're doing what we can to trace things, to try and find out who and what and WHY.."  Harry said when the silence stretched and Draco could just sit there looking stunned.  "But he doesn't think that filing an immediate stop to the release is a good idea.  It would make it very clear to whoever is doing this that they've been found out.  And then we'd likely have more trouble finding out."
And what will Draco think of his primary enemy suddenly wanting to be friends? Will he embrace the unlikely kinship?
Harry made an exasperated noise and gave Ron a withering look.  "It's not on my finger, is it?  Can you see it?"  He held up his hand, wiggling his fingers a bit.  "If it's not there then it's gone."
"Why is Dumbledore showing you so much about my life?  The real reason."  His voice was soft, but there was such command behind it.
“No.”  Draco said the one word reflexively.  He didn't need to think about it, really, his brain always leapt to that for him.
-------
"Cat got your tongue?"  Harry asked rather lazily, shifting under water on the ledge that ran around the inside edge of the tub to sit on, watching Draco as he processed everything that had just been given to him.
But he had pressed his lips together, fisting his hand around his spoon until his knuckles turned white, then turned to her and let everything out in a rush that he had been rehearsing in his head.  Apologizing over and over again, trying to explain, while pretending to be worried about who might be listening in, that he hadn't known any other way.  That she and Ron had started out so dismissive about Draco and what he'd been doing at Borgin and Burkes in the summer that he had to come up with a plan of his own because he just
Silence stretched almost uncomfortably long, Malfoy's brows knitting as he tried and seemingly failed to find the veiled threat or insult in Harry's words.  He tilted his head, looking at the dark haired boy curiously as Harry looked back at him.
"I think it's more impressive that he said yes."  Harry grinned, shifting where he was sitting cross legged on Draco's bed in the Room of Requirement version of his bedroom.  Draco was sitting facing him as well.
He ducked his head, looking away and suddenly very aware fo the hand he had on Harry's knee.  He pulled it away as he shook his head.  "No.  Do you?"
"It looks that way."  Harry said with a most impressive display of casual indifference.  He didn't feel it, everything in him wanted to yell at her for even thinking it, but that would get him nowhere.  "They certainly wouldn't have bothered if he was around and taking over the Manor, would they?"
"Good."  Harry said, smiling and sitting up again.  He leaned back against the couch with a deep breath, seeming to relax a lot more than he had been before, turning to look almost lazily at Draco.  "Come to Slughorn's Christmas party with me."
Neville suddenly got very busy opening the fridge and looking inside of it.  But from behind him Draco could see the tops of his ears going red.
"Merlin no.  I pretended to so he wouldn't be such a cock up in the match, but I'd never waste it on that."
After what felt like an hour, Tom shifted, sitting back against the couch once more.  “Why don't we change the subject.”  He said, his eyes still on Harry, but his tone lazy and relaxed.  “Tell me what you saw in Slughorn's memory.”
Voldemort comes up with increasingly difficult and awful things that Draco, and by extension he himself, would have to do to keep proving his loyalty?
Harry's first attempt to get into Malfoy Manor fails terribly.  His second attempt goes FAR better.
"You look it, no offence."  Harry said, moving over to sit down in the other chair near the table, he pushed one of the warm mugs pointedly over towards Draco.  "Not just because you were crying, it's been obvious things haven't been good for you this year.  You always look tired and even more pale than usual."
“He knows you saved my life.  He knows you saved all of our lives. He knows that by the time the actual war truly began that the Malfoy’s were lower than pawns to... him... And that without you we wouldn’t be here and he wouldn’t be here and...” Draco trailed off as he watched Harry put his face in his hands, feeling a bit insulted.  “I told him the truth.” He said defensively.
He kept his tone light and careful, not wanting to arouse even the slightest bit of suspicion that he'd been literally waiting years to have any sort of conversation like this.
“Clearly... there was... a mistake.”
"Spread your wings and just take off.  I know that feeling."  Harry said quietly.
"Seduced the muggle, yes yes.  Fed him love potion like a deranged teenage girl and was stupid enough to think he really loved her after awhile.  Just as well they parted ways...  Who knows what I would have actually become had they stayed together.  I wonder about that sometimes.  Do you wonder about what would have happened to you if I hadn't killed your parents?"
“Do you honestly think I’m plotting against Draco Malfoy?”
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
But for now it was okay.  He was okay.
“That was it?  Why on earth would Dumbledore waste time with it.  He'd be able to see through it enough to know Slughorn actually told me about them..”
"Sure."  Draco said, tilting his head a bit and raising his eyebrows.  "Between figuring out the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Or dealing with Umbridge and no one believing you that Voldemort was back.  Or maybe in year six when you were having those extra lessons and learning all about Voldemort's history.  At the very LEAST during the year you were on the run looking for the Horcruxes.  I'm sure it was weighing very heavily on your mind to have a discussion about your sexuality in the middle of all of that..."
“Does it still respond to you?” Draco asked quietly, his voice betraying just how on the mark Harry had hit in talking about their respective wands.
They both stayed quiet for a few moments then, Draco eventually raised his head enough to see Harry's eyes and smiled at him a bit.  "I had a thought about communicating with my mom."
"Just as intense."  Harry said quietly as well, his eyes moving around the room and feeling relieved when he saw it was empty now except for them.  "Unnerving in a lot of ways.  He is so clearly powerful and so confident in himself.  Even as a kid in the orphanage there was something so wild and powerful about him.  But seeing him our age and the way he handled himself and the way everyone looked at him.  There's nothing he couldn't do and it's obvious he knew it."
Harry was surrounded by stacks of paper, a rough edge of stubble over his jaw and he had very tired eyes.
----------------------
Harry practically shouted the words and Draco lunged at him, scrabbling to clamp a hand over the taller boy's mouth.
Draco nodded a bit, thinking about that summer himself.  A lot HAD changed that summer.  Voldemort had been accepted as returned, he couldn't lurk in the Minister's blind spot anymore and he had come to call Malfoy Manor as his headquarters more of less.
"So what did you---"
“You brought it here?”  Harry said, mistaking it for the one that was at Borgin and Burkes.  Then frowned when Draco shook his head.
"Mm..  I just don't like that I have to hide being friends with you.  I don't like making it a 'thing' that we have to meet in secret."
“I don’t think I did any—“ He didn’t finish the sentence because Draco’s head had pulled back and he leaned in to press a hard and insistent kiss to Harry’s lips, holding there long enough for Harry to forget what he was saying before he broke from him.
"Yes but I have reason to.  He's never been anything but incredibly nice to you.  Pampered and coddled you.  He's your head of house."
"...And I know that I've spent a good part of this year throwing accusations at Draco and at Snape and at... well anyone I could think of.  But this isn't an accusation, not this time.  This is the truth and I need help to help him.  He's so scared and so lost and I'm worried he'll just give up...."
"Well...  Good luck then."  Paul said, with a little shake of his head as he turned away.
He got to his feet, pacing in front of the fire as he tried to find the words for the anger he felt.  "I can't believe she'd speak to you like that.  I don't understand her right now.  I absolutely don't.  She's
Harry muttered the words, making Draco jump a bit, casting one sideways look at the other boy before swinging his telescope in the direction he thought Harry meant.
He debated.  He considered.  He agonized, truth be told, over what to say.
“Luck, Potter.  You’ll need it.” Draco said before turning to walk down the hall slowly, as though half of him wished Harry would come after him.
Fuck.  Fuck Potter.  Fuck his smarmy smile and his asshole personality.  Fuck him for being RIGHT, as well.
Because it was clear that Neville was uncomfortable...  Whether he was consciously aware of it or not, it seemed the closer Draco stood to him, the more red his ears got.  The more he seemed to stutter over words and the more trouble he had actually meeting Draco's eyes....
Prue right then.
He watched until he couldn't pick him out from the darkening sky anymore then sighed and went back to the couch to sit down, shoving the book and the writing things out of the way so he could settle more comfortably.
it?”  Tom's voice was like the crack of a whip now, his eyes getting redder by the moment.
"No.  I haven't wanted to involve him.  Last year... Before I heard him feeding false information to Him, I likely would have had him help from the start and already be done.  But I don't... I just don't think he's really with Him.  Not anymore, if ever..."
“Still..”  Harry said, tilting his head a bit as he looked at the boy next to him.
After he'd re-read the page of his first letter that he'd given Harry, he'd just about melted into the floor with hot embarrassment.  Humiliation, practically.  He had forgotten he'd written that...
"The problem with close friends.  Their best intentions are often nosey."  Draco smiled a little more, nudging Harry lightly with his elbow.
Draco tilted his head a bit as he looked at the other boy, his hair damp and slicked back from his face, water droplets clinging to his neck and the top of his chest.
Draco shook his head, sipping his tea again before setting the mug back down.  "No he didn't.  My father kept him in his pocket, of course.  Paved the way with money and outlandish lies and promises that he never intended to keep.  He instilled most of the doubt into Fudge about what you and Dumbledore said about Voldemort being back.  But Fudge wanted to believe him anyways, which made his tactic pretty effective..."
But she and his son didn't live at Malfoy Manor anymore, not really.  Her appearance there the night that Draco had written that letter to Harry was a surprise and he'd left from his study abruptly to see what she wanted because it was such a shock to hear her call for him.
They only stopped when the necessity to take a full breath of air forced it.  Both of them panting, their faces close, foreheads pressed together, noses nudging together.  Lips still close enough to catch together as they spoke.
He rested his hands against his chest, staring up at the ceiling as he pressed one hand over his heart, a habit he had started when the panic attacks did, to reassure himself that it still worked okay.  That it still beat as it should most of the time.
Harry slowly lowered his wand as Tom spoke, realizing that the other boy was right.  He walked back closer to Tom again and didn't move this time as the other boy raised his wand, touching it to Harry's temple and slowly drawing the glowing silver strands from it.
Tom was a little younger here than he was in the dreams he had been sharing with him, but not by much..  His eyes were fully dark, no hint of red in them yet... But there was such a keen and sharp edged look to them...  They drank in every word that Slughorn was saying, watching him avidly and attentively as his jolly and seemingly oblivious Professor explained to him what Horcruxes were.
-----------------------
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
"I wish I could fly."
Which wasn't uncommon after a panic attack that severe, they tended to be exceptionally draining physically.  And mentally he just... always seemed to need time to recover.
"Right??"  Harry turned to look at Draco, an almost relieved looking smile curling onto his lips.  Draco understood.  Draco ACTUALLY understood.  He wasn't all cautious and constantly worried and thinking he couldn't handle it.  He got it.  He understood.  "They want me to be on their side and to fight for them and to win this whole impending war for them, but they won't tell me things.  Won't teach me things.  I complain about Dumbledore and how he's never telling me all of everything and people just say 'Oh that's just Dumbledore.  Oh I'm sure he has his reasons.'  Nuts to that."
Perish the thought.
And Harry woke up.
“If you think I believe that, then you're exceptionally foolish.”  Neville tilted his head a bit, adding milk to his coffee and holding the carton out to Draco.  He set it back down again when the blonde shook his head.  “I won't sit here and bug you to tell me, but you and I both know you're not fine.”
He breathed heavily, his mind spinning almost frantically.  Trying to make sense of something that made no sense at all.
“Last night.  You threw the Dark Lord's family back in his face trying to defend me.  You didn't need to do that, especially to HIM...”
“No.. More of the same sort of thing as the television.  Not magic like we know it, but magic like Muggles seem to do.” Neville swiped his finger across the small screen and the picture on it changed.  “So you know how we use owls to send messages and everything?  Muggles have a bunch of other ways to communicate.  Originally they mostly wrote letters and sent them like we do, but they took longer because they would be collected by Muggles and driven to where they were supposed to be and then other Muggles would carry the letters around to bring them to the houses once or twice a day.”
"Mm."  Harry made a noise of agreement, nodding a couple of times and then sighing deeply.  He rubbed his hand against Draco's arm a couple of times then let it fall away.  "So what do we do now?"
"No, certainly not."  Hermione shook her head and seemed to relax entirely when Harry spoke so easily about Draco.  "Are you going?"
"Feeling is mutual."
"It's May.. Early May, we still have time."
Harry rubbed both hands over his face, making an exasperated noise.  When he looked back up again at Draco he frowned at him rather savagely.  “You're enjoying this way too much.”
"Not a bit.  It's just odd circumstance."  Draco tugged his coat down again, trying to ignore how uncomfortable his pants now were.  He moved to retrieve his wand.  "We better just find the blasted plants..."
Somehow hearing Harry say that made Draco even madder.  He irrationally wanted to be the one who hated the MOST.  Like somehow that justified everything.
"But we could make sure it goes off without a hitch with this." Draco closed his fingers around the small bottle that was still warm from Harry's hand.    "Are you really sure you want to be helping me with this?"  He asked, not looking up to Harry's face as he tucked the bottle safely into his deepest pocket.
Just a little bit about the 'ring' that I want to say because I don't know if it will get explained in detail at any point-
"I'll make Hermione leave tomorrow morning.  Or tonight, I'll tell her I heard someone..."
He read it, got to the end and looked at Harry.  Then down at the letter again, re-reading all or part of it, Harry didn't know which.  Then he thrust the parchment at Harry.
if I'm going to be expelled instead.. A few days later some of the Order of the Phoenix show up and gets me out of the Dursley's.  They brought be here for the first time... Everyone was here and I learned about the Order and went to my trial.  You know how that turned out."
Harry took in a breath and then let it out again in a rush and with a chuckle.  “Everyone else does seem to need hand holding and so much more explained to them than you do.  Half of them I don't think we have a hope in hell of EVER getting to use a Muggle cell phone, and you're over here asking for internet.”
Draco used his Patronus, since no one but Harry knew that he could create one, no one would assume or know it was his.
In moments they were on the ground.  It was cold and hard, icy half frozen leaves stuck first to their clothes and then to their skin as they struggled out of what they were wearing.  Neither of them noticed.  Neither of them would have cared even if they had noticed. All that mattered was the heat of their skin where it pressed together, the slick slide of their lips as they kissed harder and deeper.  They pulled insistently at each other, shifting and sliding together in ways they'd both thought about but had never chanced before.
Hogwart's students are heading back to school after Christmas break.
"Ugh.  I haven't heard that name in years, I haven't missed it."  Harry said, resting his head back against the wall.  "And I went a whole eleven years without ever having heard it in the first place."
But he didn't speak.  He didn't start pointing to things or explaining things or teaching him things.  He just let him look and then they carried on to the next window.
With a sigh he tilted himself over to stretch out on the couch on his side, looking at the blank tv screen.  With very concentrated effort he reached to pick up the remote and press the button to turn the TV on. His arm hung down the front of the couch as the screen filled with the silly antics of some animated animals in a children's show.  Changing the channel was not in the cards.  That would be too much work.
Draco and Harry have one of the most convoluted, complicated, intricate and serpentine of relationships. It went on during school, it carried on after school. It stopped. And now it seems it’s starting again.
He kept shaking. Kept hearing that high thin voice that had haunted him for years.  Probably always would haunt him.
Harry repeated the words a few times, banging on the door roughly.  Hermione and Ron were huddled under the invisibility cloak a few steps away while he tried to get Borgin back to the door.
happen.”  Draco said, trying to keep his lips from twitching.
"Last time I sent one of them, they got lost."  Draco said, still wary, and then looking like he was about to die of shock when Harry laughed.
"Completely."  Borgin said with a wave.  "Bit of silver that wouldn't change the mind of anyone.  I wore it for a week after I bought it from someone and all it did was make me question what I really wanted for lunch every day."
Harry shook his head, smiling up at Draco.  "Nah.  I don't really buy much in terms of clothing.  I wear whatever I have until Mrs Weasley starts commenting on how bad everything fits me, then I get new things.  All the Gryffindor stuff and Quidditch themed stuff she's made though.  Your mom doesn't make you anything?"
He was so absorbed in what he was doing he didn't hear the knock on the front door.  He was completely unaware that he had company until he heard someone clear their throat in the doorway of his study.  He looked up, slightly annoyed and very distracted, expecting the House Elf, but faltered when he saw who it was.  Made an incredibly embarrassing noise of surprise.  And just stared for a few moments before speaking.
"I can't imagine.  Fudge was so corrupted by that point, half fear and cowardice and half just complete delusion about the whole thing.  He'd want you written off, though he didn't have anything to do with Voldemort."
"It was my fault, Mrs. Malfoy, I--"  Harry said, but he stopped speaking when Narcissa's cold eyes flicked to him so sharply they could have cut his flesh.
"Wings?"  Harry said, closing the magazine and looking up at Draco with a smile.  "I'm not sure that would, actually, fix anything.  It isn't like you can't fly already."
And that seemed to set Harry off guard, the dark haired boy unable to help looking at him curiously.
Raced.
“I suppose that makes sense.”  Draco said as though he was grudgingly accepting of it.  Inwardly he was glad.  He didn't realize someone would have to come into his flat, which he was already feeling rather comfortable in if he was honest and the idea of having some stranger in there poking at it wasn't the best. Having someone else there would be helpful, even if it was some Auror that wouldn't meet his eyes.
Draco was annoyed, both at having to have Harry explain something to him, and being touched by him as well.  But as he looked where Harry was directing he saw he was right, there was a very tiny but present pinprick of light in the area of sky he'd been searching in vain.
Decorating was fun again, he found he enjoyed that a great deal, even if it was once again a tricky business to make his fondant and icing look like it was smoothing on naturally.
“Lucky we're on the same team now.”
So rather than tuck himself back into bed, he pulled on jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt, both of which were soft as clouds from being worn again and again, and walked himself out to the kitchen.
He was still smiling as he sat down at the Gryffindor table and fell into conversation with Ron while Hermione read The Daily Prophet.
Draco was silent.  So silent that after about a minute Harry moved his hand to the other boy's cheek and physically lifted his head.  His heart gave a great thump when he saw tears on Draco's cheeks again.  Something he'd seen many times at this point, but not something that ever got easier.
"I'm not saying I'd CHEAT, I'm talking about using magic.  Which can't be cheating because it's a natural ability and isn't my fault that the other contestants are Muggles."  He tossed a piece of popcorn at Harry, snickering when it stuck in his hair.
Probably to feel superior to him.  There hadn't been any occasion for that since they left school, and Harry certainly did enjoy feeling superior to him then.
Draco moaned, his hips pressing towards the slide of Harry's hands.  He loved the feel of it, loved that he could feel the other boy twitch, feel the catch in his breath, feel so much more of him than he could when they were bundled against the cold in the woods.  He was lost in the heat between them, the pull from deep inside of him that made his hips flex harder, that made Harry groan when he did it, made the dark haired boy's hands move faster.
Beside him Draco gasped, making both dark haired heads turn to look at him.  “I've heard about those.” He said, raising his eyebrows a bit, and damned if a tiny smile wasn't curling at the corners of his lips.
Draco's hands curled in the thick black strands of Harry's hair, one leg instinctively curling around his hips as Harry's hands slid over his back, feeling him out and making him shiver hard, his skin prickling to the point of aching as everything in him seemed to come alive.
"When Dumbledore came to get me, he took me to see him.  Had to convince him to come back to Hogwarts."
He didn't even want a war.
"Shut.  Up.  Potter."  Snape sneered at the dark haired boy, his eyes blazing.  "Chosen One or not, you have NO idea what you're actually dealing with here."
“I know you go into the Room of Requirement.  I can guess it has to do with the vanishing cabinet at Borgin and Burkes but I don't know anything else.”  Harry said, leaning forward just a bit more to look at Draco seriously.  “And I'm not asking you to tell me.  I'm just telling you I know, and also I thought I'd offer you the map to use so you wouldn't have to get your two oafs to stand outside the door while you're inside.”
“I admit to being curious about what Horcruxes are.  But to actually do the task?  No.”
The silence stretched in the room, Draco's shifting of box contents not enough to drown out the noise of an argument that came from neighbours up the hall.
--------
Harry nodded slowly, putting together the pieces of the conversation he'd heard between Draco and Borgin.  “Right, you were asking him how to fix it.  Did he?”
Eager.  Helpful.
Harry moved on reflex, stepping back and whipping his wand out as well, braced and ready to fire back at whatever Tom was about to throw his way.
"Wh---"
Harry watched the other boy, smiling at how relaxed he looked, then chuckled as Draco let go of his hand and slid over on the couch, flopping down with his head in Harry's lap.
"Quite right, Mr. Potter."
"It's a very particular piece.  A very niche market, I couldn't sell it for more than that.  I haven't been able to sell it for twenty Galleons yet, it's sat in my case for years."  Borgin waved a hand dismissively about why the price was so low. "Besides, I would rather anyone have it than Draco Malfoy."
Though confusing given the current state of things...
Will he let Harry help him with the dark plans he has to undertake by the end of the year?
"No kidding."  Harry said, reaching for a handful of carrot sticks.  "I was going to write back and explain but I figured it didn't really matter.  I couldn't undo the article being printed, and even if it was an accident, it still happened."
"Sounds great."  Harry smiled as he stepped in through the entrance and looked around.  He remembered it from the first time he had been there a few years ago, but had a lot less reason to appear uninterested in his surroundings this time.
Harry- Shouldn't have admitted that.
As he sealed this letter, writing Harry's name across the front in long curving script, he heard Astoria call to him.
"Thankfully yes...  Although I had no idea what actually happened."  Draco said, leaning back in his chair again and picking up his mug of tea to sip.  "All my father said was you were brought in some charges and with any luck you'd be wandless in a week."
No, not with family or friends (Draco sighed in relief at that response), they were actually taking people out of the Wizarding World and hiding them in amongst the Muggles in different places all across the country.
Harry hoped that he was okay with what he saw.... And hoped that he really and truly knew that he was only doing this to help him...
Harry smiled a bit and then silence fell between them.  Draco turned to look over at his owl who was now grooming rather heavily, as though he knew he was going to be needed for something important.
His father's voice was hot and eager in his ear, urging him and prodding him uncomfortably to look at Harry and confirm it was him.
"We'll have to say goodbye.  But I should like us to talk again..."
-----------------------------------------
"Yeah well.. She's not talking to me right now.  I got too harsh with her over something stupid and she's been in a snit about it since then.  If she notices she's not going to say anything to me.  Which means I can't incriminate either of us directly."
"Who's Slughorn?"  Neville asked, visibly worried.
Draco bolted upright in bed, heaving in deep breaths of air as his skin prickled and his hands shook.
“Then make giving you the information worth my while. Then we can both leave.”
"Nope."  Harry shook his head, looking away from Draco as anger etched in lines over his face.  "Mr and Mrs Weasley keep trying to shield me from everything.  Like THAT will help me?  Please...  Sirius used to tell me things a little straighter, but he was super biased and didn't have a ton of information since he'd been in Azkaban for so long.  And Dumbledore.  He
