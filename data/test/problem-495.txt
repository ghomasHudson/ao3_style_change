“I’m not going to kiss you,” he told dream-Malfoy meanly, and dream-Malfoy’s mouth curled up in challenge, like Harry was amusing him, and his hand tightened in Harry’s hair, and rather than lean back in Harry tried to will himself out of the dream, hurtling towards wakefulness with a speed borne entirely of resentment, until he woke panting and pissed off and turned on in his own bed in Grimmauld.
“Right! That’s just what Hermione said. Every Muggle in Britain will know her—if we can get her in front of the cameras, all that red hair, and we even have one of her dresses here in the upstairs exhibition space… I think she just might swing it for us. Even
“Wonder of wonders, oh how can it be?” he sings, and it sounds like an old music hall number, but then Draco follows it jauntily with, “Jesus the Crucified pleads for me!” and Harry recognises it from church earlier.
He had to push against dream-Harry to find his own words, lost in the dream for just a moment, any worries from his real life borne away on the shiver of the tide and the brackish whip of a sea wind. “Why am I here?” he asked dream-Malfoy as he started pulling himself out of the dream, and watched that twitch of concern travel over dream-Malfoy’s face before Harry blinked awake, alone.
“Do you want me to hold the lead?” Harry asked when he reached them, and Malfoy looked up with a start, squinting irritatedly into the midday dazzle of the July sun.
, and Draco smiles at Harry across the room and finishes splitting the pierced apple, the star of the seeds against the white flesh, the skin of the fruit red and winking like a ruby or a Valentine, Draco holding half a heart in each hand before he raises one piece to his mouth and takes a bite.
The sky was a split plum, an aging bruise, gold streaming into purplish darkness as the raging sun dipped below the horizon.
“I always wanted a crup,” he said, “but my parents wouldn’t allow it. It was only when I… you know”—he gestured behind himself, a wide sweeping movement that encompassed open skies, the tender fluttering of pin feathers, the sense of each wingbeat as a counterpoint to Harry’s battering pulse—“that I understood why. Veela magic, or whatever, it drives crups mad. Peggy doesn’t mind though, do you darling?”
“I don’t think so,” he said, and then he took over completely from dream-Harry, realising as he did so that really, there was not much difference between how he felt and how this strange dream-Harry felt about Malfoy, and he slid his hand into Malfoy’s hair and kissed him.
, but you know how funny people are about this stuff. And anyway, maybe if I saw them, and got to be with them... Maybe I wouldn’t be able to help myself bringing them back with me. And I don’t know the rules or whatever, but there’s got to be some sort of payback, doesn’t there? It’s not like I would be doing it for the war, or to beat Voldemort. It would just be for me, and that would probably be wrong.”
When they stroll to Huffkin’s for pastries they meet Cynthia, who lives beside the church and has an actual paddock in her garden, and Draco lets go of Harry’s hand so Rosie, the skittish mare, can nuzzle at his palm. Cynthia looks at him fondly, and Harry feels the urge to tell her, “Draco’s moving in.”
Harry crossed the floor so he could be nearer, just like he always did whenever he dreamed, these days. He could hear the noise of hundreds of other men outside, through thin canvas walls, though the night was mercifully quiet otherwise. Dream-Harry was, real-Harry realised, waiting for the desperate scream of shells and the rattle of bullets to start.
The music finally stops but then the wedding guests start the singing, mournful and triumphant and everything in between,
, back to back, Malfoy’s body warm and solid and safe against Harry’s. Sometimes dream-Malfoy spoke to Harry, and dream-Harry always understood, though real-Harry knew that the words were unfamiliar, old and French-sounding and weird, but weirder still was the ease with which dream-Malfoy’s mouth curled around Harry’s name (
Draco had watched him when he went on the tv to make his big speech. By then the Order had set up the proper perimeters all around Whitehall and down to the river, and Kingsley was having long shouted discussions with the Muggle Prime Minister about how any treaty talks with Voldemort would almost certainly involve a prolonged and painful death. And the Abbey was slowly filling up, camp beds and little gas stoves and roll-out mattresses marking out territory across the flagstones.
“I don’t want anything while you’re still curse-damaged. You’re hurt, you prat.” Harry tells him, hoping he doesn’t sound too gentle about it, and when Draco narrows his eyes at him, Harry catches his hands, pins them above his head, leaning lightly into the judder of each muscle spasm. “How long does this normally last?”
“It’s a lost cause, anyway,” Draco tells him gloomily, and then neatly sidesteps a group of laughing Unspeakables and turns Harry onto the dancefloor with a firm hand at the base of his spine. “None of them will listen. The moment I mention my mother—” He swallows, smile never dipping, face serene. “Well, there’s no way the Wizengamot will sanction an investigation. No resources. Bermingham might as well have laughed in my face.”
“That’s the River Kennet.” He showed Harry with an expansive sweeping arm, and something in the careless movement of it reminded Harry vividly of the sweep of creamy linen and the glint of gold at his earlobe.
His hand caught Draco’s where it was tangled up in cotton, big palm already warmed up a bit, and shook.
“I don’t think I can sleep,” he said, and his voice was thin and scratchy from months of too many cigarettes, and no rest, and shouting. Malfoy sighed.
Malfoy on a city street in the softest-looking t-shirt Harry had ever seen, a paper cone spilling over with flowers tucked in the crook of an elbow—Soloman’s Seal, dream-Harry helpfully supplied, and geraniums—and the proud nobbly jut of what dream-Harry knew was going to be a perfect Flute Campagne from the top of a cotton shopper bag slung over Mafoy’s shoulder, a streetsign behind him reading Rue Ste-Catherine Est, and above that again, the defiant flutter of a rainbow flag.
Harry felt a bit sick, because despite everything—Malfoy being a prick in real life, and everything he had always hated about him, and not seeing him for three years after Malfoy had fucked off to who-knows-where after they all finished school—the dreams had continued ever since, and Harry still hadn’t mentioned them to anyone. And sometimes he didn’t dream, or just dreamed normal dreams like everyone had, and he thought that maybe they had stopped for good. And then the dreams would come back, dream-Malfoy always in them, and it was always a fresh shock. Harry didn’t
Draco murmurs that he’d probably manage to Apparate them to Diagon at least, but Harry takes one look at his too-pale face, cheekbones standing out stark, the hunted echo of a grimace to his mouth, and digs his wallet out of the back pocket of his jeans.
all this even gets done, Draco thought. The plan seemed like such a flimsy thing, a sort of sly trickery, something to intimidate, something to dazzle the Muggles with.
“Harry,” Sirius says, sweet and smoky, but then he stops, stifled. Slowly his hand rises in front of his face, claws at something Harry can’t see, mouth caught fast on the start of the same old smile, before he starts to fall backwards.
“I didn’t think Ron was your type, that’s all,” he says, and he trembles a bit as he lies down on top of Draco, his breath catching in his throat at every kiss they share.
“Yeah, he looked pretty joyful today alright,” Harry says, thinking of Andrew’s cool stare from the pulpit. Harry doesn’t blame him, of course; he’d never had Draco, not properly, but he had
“There’s one for each of us, if we want them,” Draco tells them proudly, like it was part of his plan all along, and Harry reaches for one of the kittens—the smallest one, with fur the same murky silver of Draco’s eyes.
“I don’t—” Draco begins, but Harry pulls back again, looks at him crossly, then slides his thumb into Draco’s mouth, chastising, viciously intimate.
For one tiny moment there’s quiet in the chaos, as Draco turns to look at Harry across the stretch of disgusting green carpet; Draco's smile is sweeter than it has any right to be, considering that his teeth are filmed with blood, but at least it’s
dream-Harry was wearing some sort of chain mail, though he was only noticing it now as the edges of the dream sharpened up.
“I know she was bad,” Draco says, but his eyes are too silver where they’re fixed on the Horcrux, and Harry knows he’s thinking of how like his mother Bellatrix was, before she became what she was at the end.
“Anyway, I'm not going to die,” Draco said, which for all he knew was going to end up being a lie, even if not a permanent one. People
, Harry said, looking directly into the cameras, glasses off, all the better to show off those Avada-green eyes.
“Malfoy,” he said sharply, and half the heads in the room snapped around to look then carefully looked away again at the sight of him. Malfoy himself was in his cubicle, not even bothering to look up from his files; Harry could see the infuriating dip of his bent head through the open side of the cubicle, where he was still reading. Tracey Davis, Malfoy’s partner, aimed a kick at him under the table. He put the file down.
“That one was a dream,” he answers, and Harry goes limp with relief. “They’re all dreams, remember?”
He held it high, then started his careful pacing again, and light from the fire moved up the blade like something living. Harry moved before he knew what he was really doing, the trailing tie of his dressing gown catching on the hawthorn, berries like rubies in the reflected glow of the fire as Harry crashed through the too-long grass he really should have cut before summer ended.
Seamus said disappointedly, “You can’t even see the little fecker. I’m going over there,” and he did, without even bothering to get himself a drink first, and within three minutes of Malfoy looking up at him warily, his face a careful blank, Seamus had nabbed the dog and was laughingly getting very enthusiastic licks all over his face. Malfoy was laughing too, face alight with it, the expression weirdly naked, his devotion so obvious that it was like someone had turned the lights right up.
Harry, sweating and stretched out and satisfied, lying with his hand on his stomach, feels it. It’s nothing but the miniscule surge and flutter of some tiny unknown magic, and he doesn’t even realise it at the time, but much later when he thinks back, he can trace it all back to that night. And it’s not even that it’s better than usual, or different. Because it’s always so good between them, both of them with the long awareness of each other’s bodies, allowing themselves such single-minded focus on these small, desperate pleasures. But that night, in the home that’s now
“Deal,” Draco said, and then, “Oh shit,” when magic sparked between them. “I think we might have just made some sort of magical covenant.” He looked up at the roof of the Abbey suspiciously, following the graceful upward line of the columns to where they disappeared into the darkness of the vaulted ceiling. “It’s all this ancient community magic. Plays absolute havoc with my casting.”
Draco tries to wriggle out of his pyjama bottoms but he’s pinned to the couch by Harry, and he sighs in frustration. “Fine, fine. Just… take these off, will you?” He plucks helplessly at the waistband of Harry’s joggers, grabs Harry by the hips and lifts him up impatiently.
“That was one kiss,” he replied, “a long time ago. And I didn’t even care about Malfoy then, so I’m not sure why you think I’d care now.”
Harry thinks with distant horror that he might be about to cry, and Draco looks sideways at him quickly, alarmed.
Draco is by the window, talking meaningfully to Dudley and his girlfriend, the baby tucked on his shoulder, fast asleep. Harry doesn’t quite like the look of Draco’s smile, but he doesn’t think Dudley is going to cause any trouble, not today, not here. Still, he picks up a plate and chooses some anaemic-looking ham sandwiches that he’s definitely not going to eat, and heads over to them. Ron is still talking cheerfully to the hunted-looking man. “Like skinning a chicken,” Harry hears him say as he passes, and then he’s by Draco’s side and Draco grabs for him with the hand that isn’t holding the baby.
“That’s almost the worst part,” he said, and—oh!—that was his mouth moving, a scrape of teeth over Draco’s throat, maybe even a tentative touch of his tongue. His mouth, at least, was still just as warm as it always had been. “It’s not so bad there, anymore. I… sometimes I think I like it. It’s quiet. At the start, there were so many of them, so much din. They wanted— I suppose they wanted me to
Angelina rolled her eyes and muttered something about stating the bloody obvious, and Seamus, who had just arrived and who was still taking off his coat, nearly fell over a stool craning his neck to peer at Malfoy across the beer garden. Malfoy wasn’t hard to find, not even in the deepening violet dusk, because of all his hair under the fairy lights. The dog was barely visible though, tucked into the neck of Malfoy’s denim jacket so the row of closed buttons writhed. Malfoy looked preoccupied as he patted the heaving mound, reaching for his drink with the other hand.
“That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new,” Draco says, carelessly. “You know the type of thing. Taking the Mark… all of it. Sometimes, things remind me of it, even if they’re not… even if they’re not meant the same way. The way they make me feel is the same.”
By the time Harry gets across the pub and out into the Muggle side, Draco is gone, and the wind is crooning a mournful storm warning.
Harry wriggled on the rug, jeans shoved down to his knees, face pained and desiring in the reddish light from the window. Draco kicked off his joggers so he could straddle Harry, cover him and weigh him down, and he took the Elder Wand from Harry’s wrist holster, gave it a gentle flick along the floor so it rolled away a little bit, out of their reach.
“I dream about him too,” Malfoy says. It’s just the two of them in the hallway at fuck knows what time of the night, but Malfoy doesn’t sleep much either, so he never cares about Harry’s nightmares. “It feels so real.”
Harry doesn’t take her out to dinner, but he does get tickets for the Oscar Wilde exhibition at the British Library and takes her to that. When they listen to the recording of Wilde’s voice, Hermione actually cries, though only a little bit, and when Harry puts his arm around her she leans into him just like she always did.
“I think,” Harry says, “you’ll need to be the one to take care of it. I can’t be sure, if I knew where it was, that I wouldn’t want to, you know—” He waves a hand, feels Draco watching him, the complicated arcing movement of a summoning forming unseen in the air.
And with just the small rough touch of the fine pinpricks of Draco’s facial hair, he was back in the Manor, the low lemony morning sun pouring through the stained glass, his own lust-slack body straining down into Draco underneath him, and that glorious first kiss which had bled into their second and their third and on and on, like neither of them could ever get enough. And then a door opening, Theo stumbling out laughing, with some Slytherin girls Harry hadn’t bothered learning the names of, and when they saw Harry in Draco’s arms they’d laughed and laughed, and shouted, “Happy birthday, Draco!” in their horrible snide voices, and Draco—still alive then, so alive and so warm and solid under Harry—had gently but firmly pushed Harry out of his lap and stood up (adjusting himself casually and shamelessly, Harry remembered, the absolute bastard) and wandered off up the stairs with his friends without even looking back.
“Hi Dudley. Listen, I don’t have much time. But there’s something we need—something of my mum’s—and we think it might be here. Have you ever come across anything weird, anything your mum might have hidden away? It’s a box, about so big—”
“I don’t care,” Harry said, and then he stretched gingerly and sat up. “But I do have to go. I need to let them know that she’s agreed to do it.”
Teddy runs a finger over the handle of the sword, pokes at the tip of the arrow-shaped pommel, says quietly, “This is quite cool.”
Harry wasn’t even sure what was really happening in the dreams; though he knew that they were in Hogwarts, of course—no matter how fractured and fuzzy the dream, the feel of the cool stone of the corridors was the same as in real life, as Harry and Malfoy raced endlessly through them, a haze of battle spells zinging around them.
He smiled at Draco, a proper, sweet, substantial thing, and all of a sudden Draco knew what he meant. Because Draco would do the same, of course; if it had been him who was the Master of Death, and if the alternative was losing Harry, he would rip through the Veil and take, take, take Harry back. But then, he had always been selfish like that.
, Harry thought. Through the window he could see Dean and Seamus in the back garden. The dog was on its back on the grass, four legs in the air, wriggling with delight as they rubbed its fluffy tummy. Through the open window, Harry could hear the distant hum of a lawnmower. The air felt heavy with summer.
Everyone who’s anyone in the Ministry is at the Gala, and all of them notice when Harry arrives forty minutes late, without his bowtie.
“Right,” Draco said thoughtfully, and then he walked back towards Harry, and dropped down to a crouch in front of him. He looked at Harry interestedly. “I can see it. It makes a lot of sense, actually. You’ll be a good Auror, Potter.” And that had been that, and Harry hadn’t regretted any of it, not in the two years of training and two years on the beat, and all the exams and bureaucracy. He’d loved it all, right up until the day he had met Draco for lunch and they’d got caught up in a botched robbery attempt and Draco had just been unlucky. In the most profound way, it should have been Harry. He wished it had been.
“So that’s the happy tale of why I didn’t used to like Easter,” he says, voice fond. “Good talk, Potter. Now do you see why I said this”—he waves his free hand languidly between them—“was going to be hard? We always have to be... working, sort of? To
From down the hall, Harry heard a distant chime, as his wayward kitchen clock defiantly struck the hour. Dinner time, he thought, and then he let himself think of Draco lazily shaking a frying pan, smiling at Harry across the kitchen, and he cried again.
“Why would you need a potions lab?” Draco asked, not turning, hand pressed to the warped milky glass of the old window, and Harry realises that in all this time he’s never
“Is something supposed to happen now?” Harry whispered, and Draco pressed closer to him, leaned over to peer into the cauldron. Harry leaned with him, shoulder to shoulder, but though they were both silent there was nothing to hear but the comfortable crackle of the fire, nothing to see but themselves reflected back at them from the surface of the liquid, fair hair and dark, features cloaked by the restless ripples and the steam, nothing to think about other than themselves and the flicker of banked flames and the full dark of early night.
Harry’s almost asleep when Malfoy whispers, “I didn’t know he was—” and then stops abruptly and turns away from Harry in the bed.
“Stop messing about,” Hermione said now, and Ginny jumped down from the counter and they all trooped dutifully through the double doors into the living room.
Draco kisses Harry then, unfamiliar mouth to unfamiliar mouth, a beguiling swipe of tongue, smiling into it. Then he’s gone across the room, and he grabs a crossbow that’s leaning against the wall under the dartboard, hefts it speculatively in his grip. The hag picks up a new melody, the low thumping beat of something jaunty, countryish. Draco laughs, and Harry can’t look away, and then Draco lines up a sultry-eyed vampire against the wall, smiling that careless charming smile the whole time, and shoots an apple off her head with the crossbow.
There are fifteen speeches at the wedding party, Muggle microphone passed from hand to hand, and there are more prayers, this time over the food, though no one seems very devout about any of it. Harry eats salted cod in cream, and Malfoy orders bottle after bottle of Muscat for the table even though he hardly drinks at all usually, and he’s quieter than normal while Ron and Harry talk. By the time the music starts they’re already a bit drunk from wine and sun. Harry hadn’t bothered with a jacket anyway, and Ron opens one button and then another at his throat, and Malfoy’s pale linen suit is soft and crumpled from heat, and he has the beginning of fresh sunburn across his nose.
Harry dredged up the memory of the dream—and how often over the years had he wished he could forget them all, scrub out all the details of every time dream-Malfoy had smiled at him, or laid a hand upon him so casually that Harry wanted to hit him, or every time dream-Malfoy had said his name (
, just the body, all broken up into manageable parts—and it was easy to find a rhythm in the repetitive movements. He used to wash Draco all the time, after training, when he came back grimy and exhausted and quiet, head full of tactics. It had been soothing for Harry as well. There was still something of that comfort in the act, even after everything.
“Don’t patronise me, Potter,” Draco snaps, mouth shutting tight as tendrils of condensation curl into the mist that’s sprung up, making everything look soft-edged, unreal. But he still turns his body into Harry’s in one brief unguarded moment, a press of lips to Harry’s scar, like a good luck charm, and then he turns and levitates the entrance stone away.
He did some fairly over-the-top storming through the corridors back to the DMLE headquarters, which in hindsight was going to be embarrassing, but by the time he got there he still felt hot and cross and itchy, like the heavy brewing feeling right before a break in the weather. He realised he was still holding his cup of tea. He didn’t care.
“I don’t have preferences when it comes to you.” Harry kisses his hair, and then when Draco doesn’t protest he does it again, threading the fine silk of it through his fingers. “It’s always… Jesus, Draco, it’s always so good. We can do intense if you prefer it. I can be rough with you, push you around a bit.” Draco bites at his collarbone, gently, imprecisely. “But not to hurt you. I’ll only do it to make you like it as much as I do.”
Narcissa arrived, looking just like herself only paler, and when she walked into the parlour and saw the body she stopped still for one awful moment, but then she smiled a chilly smile at Harry and nodded, and sat down stiffly. And after her came everyone else, Draco’s teammates, and Harry’s colleagues who had tried so hard to help in those terrible last few minutes, and people from school, and some reporters that Harry recognised but couldn’t work up the energy to hate, and lots of people Harry didn’t know.
“I’m really not,” Draco says. “Not that I’m not constantly surprised that I get to have you. But it’s what you said about trust, I suppose.” He lies back down, pulls Harry with him. “If you’re telling me you’re all in, then I believe you. So I don’t need to be jealous.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” He sat up, wincing, and groped in the sheets for his wand—for any wand—and then heaved himself out of bed and started searching in the half-dark for his clothes.
“Draco’s gone to bed, so we can just Floo straight home,” she said, and her reflection in the mirror looked pale and exhausted, and Harry thought of the pretty Slytherin girls, and Nott with his sly, enticing mouth, and he flinched without meaning to, and Hermione understood straight away.
“They’re new,” Draco says, arching upwards, spine curling away from the couch. “Why, what’s wrong with them?”
“You can have this one, if you like,” Harry told him, holding out the Viscount. The foil was stretched out and shiny from his smoothing thumb. He could feel the chocolate inside softening under his touch.
So together they choose a yellow that looks, in the tin, the same as the one that had Draco so transfixed in the Villa Farnese that day, a rolling battered ochre that had glowed buttery in all that relentless Roman light. Only Potter Cottage is too small for such a colour—the proportions are all wrong—so one Sunday they paint over the whole thing with builder’s white and then try out Harry’s choice, a pale turquoise wash that’s part drowned city, part the innermost ring of Draco’s irises, and wholly, entirely perfect in their new sitting room. And when they’re finally finished painting, Draco dusts off his smudged hands, and says, “That’ll do,” and Harry says nonsensically, “I’ll do you,” even as he’s moving towards him.
Around them a crowd has formed, and everyone is oohing and aahing, and the wyvern hovers steadily, batting its wings playfully until Draco’s hair whips around his face. Then it drops gently, its unearthly white hide incongruous against the grass, and Draco gets to pet it a bit, as it knocks at him blindly and devotedly with its enormous snout. It even holds still long enough for Teddy to have a quick stroke, though once it starts getting restless again Draco gives it a farewell pat and quickly kicks the sticks out of alignment, and when he takes the sword up again the wyvern sails into a swooping arc and disappears.
But then Draco died, on one last pained bubbling futile gasp, and Harry wished he had said it anyway, because anything would have been better than just letting Draco go like that, while choking silently on his own preemptive grief.
Harry woke up one morning and lay in bed, in the heaving morning hum of the Eighth Year dorm, and remembered asking dream-Malfoy, “Where’s my wand?”
Draco takes a sip of his coffee and grimaces. “I think I know the best way of getting rid of it,” he tells Harry, gesturing for the bill. “But we need to get back to London.”
“Intimately,” Harry replies, and Draco rolls his eyes. He studied English for one year at his Muggle university, and he never lets Harry forget it.
“Okay,” Harry says, breathing out. “Okay. But I don’t want to think about anyone else. I just want to think about this.”
The barman looks relieved to see them leaving, and Harry wonders if it’s just that Draco was bleeding all over his bar, or if he sees something else in them that he doesn’t like, that small kernel of something dangerous and lost that Harry fears is permanent, after everything. The women eye them up slyly as they go, and one winks when she sees their linked fingers, and Draco grins at them with his fierce reddened mouth and sweeps Harry into a few seconds of a waltz just for them, a firm steering hand at Harry’s waist, his bruised elegant hand in Harry’s, their faces very close together. He looks happier, Harry thinks, and before that look can be replaced by something else, Harry hurries him out, hand clasped at the back of Draco's neck like he can’t wait to touch him any longer.
They get a whole carriage to themselves on the last train out of Paris. It’s dark already, though only early evening, and Draco looks hollowed out and hungry and tense, just like Harry feels. The atmosphere in the carriage is oppressive, the holdall a sickening weight on Harry’s lap. He bites his lip, and beside him Draco does the same. Harry is terrified of what he’ll say if he starts talking, of what will spill out with the Horcrux stripping every bit of goodness from his feelings for Draco, leaving only the bare desperate carcass of whatever
They take the Trafalgar Suite, and then they try to get dinner in the Rivoli but the manager tells Harry regretfully that trainers aren’t allowed, so instead they take the lift up to their suite that looks like the inside of a music box, and they order a trolley-load of food to be sent up, which they eat bare-chested, propped up in bed, dishes arrayed across the counterpane. By the time Draco is mostly through his second £30 salt beef sandwich, some colour is back in his cheeks; he smiles sweet and unfocused as he finishes a Kentish Highball and then falls asleep where he sits, sticky-mouthed and smelling faintly of strawberries. Harry thinks he should try to close the heavy curtains but he settles for turning off the lights, which he can do without moving off the bed, and lets himself be swallowed by the profound denseness of delayed sleep.
His hand isn’t quite shaking when he raises the Peverell wand, but his eyes are wet, and when Harry steps up behind him he looks around wildly as though he’d forgotten Harry was even there.
By the time Draco has managed to dismantle all the curses, he’s had to hang his coat off a nearby headstone, and his shirt is wet through with sweat.
The sight of Draco falling had been suddenly and horribly familiar, as had the unfurling ribbons of blood. Through it all, Harry had been able to keep his head and get that shitty excuse for a criminal into a proper Bind. It had only taken him about twenty seconds to get it all under control, but he had still been too slow. He thought about it so much that he wondered if he was going to go mad from it. Because after all, he had done everything he’d been trained to do—secured the suspect, called in the duty Aurors, summoned the field Healer—but he was still too late to save Draco.
“You know we don’t have to go to this thing,” is all he says, and he indicates carefully and pulls over to the side of the road, absent-mindedly giving the finger to the truck that rushes past blaring its horn. Betsy stirs. “We can turn around right now and take our baby home and think about how bloody lucky we really are. If that’s what you need.”
“It’s been a bad idea this whole time,” Harry said crossly. “That never stopped you before.” But Malfoy was already asleep, swaddled in the duckdown covers, leaving Harry to Floo himself home resentfully. Malfoy was such a shit, he thought when he was in his own bed, alone. But he was easy, restful in a way that not many people were, because Harry didn’t ever have to worry about him in the slightest. And the sex was so good. Not that it wasn’t messy, or awkward sometimes—Harry rather suspected that, like Harry himself, Malfoy hadn’t much experience. But they figured the logistics out easily, and everything else was simple after that, because when it came down to it, all they really had to do was learn each other’s bodies, and they had always been skilled at learning each other.
“It’s still difficult, you know,” Draco says, trying to keep his breath even. “And it’s entirely your fault that I even have to see a topless Weasley at all. I’m doing it for you. I never expected to like him, you know. And I certainly never expected him to be all—” He props himself up on one elbow to make a hand-wavey gesture. Under him, Harry is starting, finally, to look amused. “He’s good-looking!”
Malfoy considers that for a while, arms crossed firmly over his chest, the curling tail of a scar a distraction above the opened neck of his pyjamas.
“No!” Draco says. “No, god, Harry. I didn’t even really— At the time, I mean, it wasn’t ever something I was sure about. And then there was you, and that had to be that. I don’t ever think about it. Why, do you? You had your eye on him there for a bit.” He laughs at Harry’s noise of protest. “Everyone fancied the vicar at some point, you said it yourself!”
“You like that?” Harry said, doing it again, and Draco didn’t answer at first, but then he let his leg slide off Harry’s shoulder and outwards, the shift in angle drawing a surprised moan from Harry. And Draco had said sharply, “I don’t think anyone’s ever touched me there before,” and then shrugged helplessly, looking at Harry like he thought he had some sort of purpose, and Harry realised that was the first time he had looked at Draco and really thought, “Mine.”
They were in a small room above a pub called the Olde Cheshire Cheese, dream-Harry knew, and he was warm and full of lamb stew and good wine, and he was having fun.  So much fun, in fact, that real-Harry had just been wondering why
, for that tipping point between frenzy and fury. Someone shouts, and there’s a distant smash of glass, and two of the werewolf’s friends start moving towards Draco, smiling with too much incisor for Harry’s comfort. Harry’s borrowed body isn’t as strong as his own, but he knows how to fight, and in any case he has his wand if it comes down to it, though he’d prefer to keep the distinctive length of holly in its holster if he can, just in case anyone recognises it.
and Draco was at the bar, laughing at something Harry said, and then all of a sudden he got very serious and ran a finger down the bridge of Harry’s nose, almost cross-eyed with the effort of focusing after the fifteen million drinks they’d had. “It’s crooked,” he said sadly, and “I never said sorry, did I?” and “I am, I am sorry,” and Harry waved him off, and told him it was fine. And when Draco was leaning over the bar and shouting out the order for yet another round, he realised it really
Harry’s voice was muffled through his hands. “Oh, Draco,” he said, and at whatever was in his voice, Draco began to stroke down the cool skin at the back of Harry’s neck, then up into his hair, tugging the curls between his fingers, smoothing, soothing.
And then Draco had looked over at him speculatively and smiled that infuriating, arch smile of his, and offered to show Harry around the house—a flimsy excuse, since the party was almost over and anyway no one would have believed that Harry would want to look around the old Voldemort murder house. But he had said yes too eagerly anyway, unashamed of it, knowing what Draco had really meant. Draco had walked him down the corridor into the hall, and backed him up against the panelling at the bottom of the stairs, and purposefully slid a hand up Harry’s t-shirt, setting a shiver over the tensing muscles of his stomach.
“When I’m there,” he said, and Draco gasped as his cool fingers flickered along Draco’s shirt, a fast unbuttoning, “and I can hear the whispers—they all know who my parents are, you know, it’s the Potters this and the Potters that—I think you’re the only thing that keeps me coming back.”
“Henricus,” dream-Malfoy said, and reached an idle hand back to take Harry’s in his own. “It has been a long summer. How was the journey? I’m glad that you made it back before the delegation arrives. I shall have need of you.” His hand was cold, though the sun blazed livid over the swell of the hill ahead; he must have been standing in the shadow of the lookout post for a long time.
for the first time since the curse had hit. And then they dressed him, and they were all crying, even Hermione who hadn’t ever really liked Draco, not even after Harry told her that Draco was
Dean and Seamus were just there to bump the numbers up, really, and they were already preoccupied by the little yappy dog that was running around in the side passage, behind an unnecessarily fussy metal gate, so it was only Draco who noticed that Harry wasn’t moving.
“I’ve been standing here looking out”—he gestures at the Park, at the spot where a few hours before they had split the soul out of the Horcrux and let it burn itself into oblivion—”and wondering why she used that. Why she used something of mine, something with my name on it. She must have taken it from the Manor. I used to have it in my room. I grew out of it before I went to Hogwarts, but you don’t just get rid of your first cloak pin, you know?” (as though Harry could possibly know, with his cupboard and his hand-me-downs and all that magic lost to him for so long).
Teddy is flushed with excitement, talking to Marie who’s listening fondly and looking healthy under her woolly hat, and Teddy looks so like Harry in that one unguarded moment that Draco’s chest feels a bit tight.
have a head injury at the moment,” Harry whispers, and when Draco shakes in his arms, Harry thinks he might be laughing.
“Thanks for coming, Harry,” Dudley says awkwardly, and his girlfriend gives Harry a confused smile as they move off. Dudley can barely look him in the eye these days, which is an improvement to the punching, Harry thinks.
. Harry is squeezing water out of his shirt and Malfoy is trying to find another slice of wedding cake, and Ron puts his arms around them both and says, “It’s a beautiful night for flying,” and Malfoy shivers and says quietly, “I was just thinking that.”
“I thought I was imagining it, before,” Malfoy says. “The way he looked at us. I wondered if he was jealous, maybe.”
the same; the well-defined ridge of pale knuckles, the elegant scrolling curve of his lifeline, the thin scar at the very base of his thumb from the time in third year that his Potions knife had slipped (Harry remembered it, remembered feeling a bit glad about it, Malfoy pale and sweating at the sight of the blood). But he was just too cold, of course, too still, and so Harry stopped trying to kiss any part of him and just sat uselessly smoothing a thumb over the bruises his own fingers had left from holding Draco’s hand as he died, and waited awkwardly for the others to come back in.
She cried then, silent angry tears that dropped into the shell of Draco’s ear and collected in the fine curling hair at the nape of his neck, and she stroked her shaky hand over Draco’s cheek briefly, perfunctorily, and Harry saw in the gesture a flash of some long-ago half-forgotten memory, Draco with his green and silver tie askew, laughing down at Pansy, her hand skimming the fine aristocratic arch of his cheekbone. They had all been so young then, and the two of them were so bright and eager for each other in a way that Harry hadn’t understood back then, and had been jealous of. Such Slytherins, both of them, Harry had thought; careless of anyone but themselves, complicit in their disdain for others. But he’d been wrong about that, it turned out;  it was just how it had
“Draco,” Harry said in a thin quiet voice. “Draco, I need you now.” He looked exhausted, Draco thought, eyes tight with tiredness even as they fluttered shut when Draco leaned in to take his mouth.
“He was a bit too up for it, to be honest,” Harry said. “But he’s too much like the current PM for my liking. We don’t want them bonding across the bloody war room. And if I’m going to do this, and I think I am, the optics really need to be right. It needs to be someone the Muggles will all recognise, and it needs to scare the shit right out of all of them in Whitehall, because this whole thing hinges on us being able to keep them in line. We need them, but we can’t let them know how much. Not if we’re going to be able to live alongside them, after all this is done.”
Yes, Harry started to say, of course. Of course I don’t know what to do here, with the man I love cut open and bleeding to death at the age of twenty-seven, and a funeral to plan, and his body here on my dining room table waiting to be laid out. But he felt his face begin to crumple, his eyes hot and stinging, his mouth too wet all of a sudden, and Luna just looked at him sympathetically and patted his arm gently.
“He looks like a Kyon to me,” Luna said mildly, and Dudley interjected from the corner, “She’s a she, not a he,” though he fell silent after a withering look from Hermione.
so Draco can finally sit up properly, and when he does, he takes Harry’s face in his hands and kisses him again, rougher this time.
“I’m possessive.” Malfoy was looking down at the dog in his lap, but his fingers were still on Harry’s, a tremble behind the firmness of his grasp. “It’s the creature in me. I can’t help it.”
Harry doesn’t know whose idea it is to get in the swimming pool, but the water is a delicious and shocking, and the stars are out, furiously bright, and Ron has more scars—chest and arms and back—and the shine of dragon burns are livid against the older tendrils of creeping scars from the night in the Department of Mysteries, and Harry catching Malfoy looking curiously while Ron, dripping wet in just his underwear, chats up a waiter.
“Do you, though?” Draco’s hair hangs over his face, the long curling ends brushing his neck, hiding his expression from Harry, and Harry can’t bear it anymore.
Draco twists impatiently on the bed, the span of his stomach muscles buckling under Harry’s pressing weight.
Harry picked up the right hand, with its broom-rough palm, and the thin wrist, and the bitten nails, and he dipped and wrung the cloth, and stroked; over the swell of flesh below his thumb, around the knob of bone at wrist, up and over heartline and lifeline, around each finger.
“I’d heard the rumours.” Draco presses against the capstone with the line of his wand, testing the fuzzy edges of the sealing spell. “Eduardas was burned off the tapestry for her, but her family wouldn’t hear of the match. And they simply couldn’t
“You’re a real shit sometimes,” Harry told him, watching Draco peer at the surface of the simmering liquid, thinking back to Hogwarts and remembering his own thin, small face in the Mirror of Erised, his dad’s devastating smile reflected back at him from just behind his mirror self’s shoulder, almost real enough to touch. As though Harry hadn’t raised his own dead enough times; as though he wouldn’t have ripped straight through the stupid veil, if it could be done.
When they take the Horcrux out of the bag and lay it on the grass, the worked silver pulsates, absorbing the diseased yellow light of the dimming moon.
should do it,” Harry replies, welcoming the warmth of that old, familiar, deep-rooted rage, like nothing he had felt since the Forest. Some days, on the hunt with Hermione after Ron had left, it was the only heat they had to warm themselves. “How do I know you’ll even do it properly? She was
“No, Harry, no,” he said, “It’s nothing like… just ceremonial, practically blunt.” He pressed a kiss to Harry’s mouth, then again, firmer, kissing the tremble out of him, his mouth warm and ripe with booze. Harry chased the faint heat of spices on his tongue.
“What did they do to you?” Harry asks him, and then he kisses Draco because his mouth is right there, though he does it softly, careful of the tender bruised flesh of Draco's lips, even if he doesn’t feel like being gentle.
It’s too cold to hang around for too long afterwards, even though Harry gets warmer stacking the plastic chairs in the tidy-up, but Sylvia has brought a bottle of something called Lafleur that they drink out of sherry glasses because the proper wine glasses are packed away, and Andrew’s eyes close when he takes a sip, and Draco gets the dark ring of purple over the dip of his top lip that he always gets from red wine. Harry doesn’t know much about wine but even he can tell it’s good stuff, darkly fruity and sharp on the roof of his mouth but warm all the way down, even if Sylvia says disapprovingly, “Of course, the cold doesn’t suit it,” a note of accusation in her voice as though it’s somehow someone else’s fault that her fancy wine can’t be fully appreciated at near freezing temperatures on a snowy Sunday in late March.
It’s too late to get the roast on by the time they get home, so Harry makes them sandwiches, and they’re both so cold and achy from the walk that he runs a proper bath in the big upstairs bathroom. They take Sylvia’s wine in with them, passing the bottle back and forth. Draco has his knees under his chin, and his hair is plastered flat to his head, darker gold from the wet, and his toes are touching Harry’s under the water.
Malfoy was looking at him questioningly, his face very close to Harry’s on the pillow, still creased and pink from sleep.
“He’s ageing like a fine wine,” is all he says, and it’s not really fair, because Draco looks the same as he did back in Sixth Year (only older), pale and sharp and worried, and not like someone Harry Potter should be in love with at all. And Harry, hair streaming over the pillow, with his generous, sulky mouth wet and gleaming from Draco’s kisses, and his eyes overbright—well, Harry is perfect as he is, and Harry will never change, or at least Draco will never be far enough away from his face to notice it changing, not if he can help it anyway.
“You already know about the wand,” Harry mutters, finally sick of it all. “Can we just do this now, and talk later?” He feels restless, like he needs pinning down, needs to be fucked quiet.
Then Harry wakes, and Malfoy is still there beside him, but there’s no travelling cloak, just a cool moonlit expanse of bare skin, and wary wakefulness.
Maybe even Draco wouldn’t have wanted all this, Harry thought. They’d never got around to discussing it, of course, why the fuck would they have? They thought they had a lifetime. But he’d promised Narcissa he’d do the thing right, and after all she had nothing left now. It was the least he could do, to have Draco ready when she arrived to watch him go into the ground.
“It looks like it went well.” Harry brushes a hand briefly over Draco's fingers, the hot edges of split skin and spongy bruises. The barman gives them a flat, unimpressed stare, and some of the women at the jukebox whoop loudly and wolfwhistle. Draco doesn’t pull away. “Can I see your face please, Malfoy?”
From behind them, Draco can hear Harry laughing, and he doesn’t realise he’s smiling at the sound of it until he sees Teddy rolling his eyes. Below them, far in the distance, the long fingers of skyscrapers reach for the lowering clouds. The view is slightly warped, like they’re looking through a dirty window, but it’s only the veil of warding spells protecting the wizarding space that’s been at the top of the hill since the Bronze Age.
“You’d better not have eaten all the good ones, you rotter,” Draco told Ginny, and stalked across the kitchen to her. She hugged the biscuit barrel to her chest, and before Draco managed to wrestle it away from her, she dug out a green-wrapped Viscount and chucked it to Harry over Draco’s head. He muttered something to her and she laughed out a spray of crumbs, and then Draco picked out a piece of shortbread and came back to stand with Harry.
.” This bit feels important, because he knows Harry doesn’t look, because Harry only looks at what he wants, and his eyes are always on Draco. “I
Draco pushes it open, too hasty with irritation at the tremble of his finger, and then he sees the ring.
He kisses Harry quickly, just something small designed to soothe, and then Teddy comes up from behind them and Harry drops away quickly, probably expecting the easy exasperation Teddy tends towards whenever he sees them touching.
Harry knows it’s done because whatever part of the thing that’s still alive shrieks when the spell hits it, and then there’s nothing but flames and silence. Harry feels exhausted all of a sudden, exhausted and ravenous, like he could eat himself into a stupor. He drops his head to Draco’s shoulder, and their hands, linked around the wand, drop down to the side, leaden and tingling from over-casting. Harry doesn’t think even coming back from the dead was this tiring.
, Draco thought. There was barely a shiver, a ripple in the air; maybe it was the Veil, or maybe the invisibility cloak, or it could just have been Draco’s lack of sleep and the two jamjars of rum he had drunk instead of dinner earlier. Whatever it was, Harry was not there one moment, and the next he was, swinging the invisibility cloak carelessly off his shoulders, a swift reveal, and then it was just the two of them cocooned in shadows under the blunt-edged open eye of the western window. Draco thought he could hear the distant fading sound of a train whistle.
In the mirror over the bar, reflected lights wink low and confiding through the warp of the old glass. Harry catches sight of his own unfamiliar, borrowed face looking back at him, too pale and too thin but just on the right side of unnoticeable. He pays for his drink with a mint-bright Galleon and the barman slides a tepid bottle of mediocre ale over to him and jerks his head towards the back of the pub. He doesn’t give Harry any change.
Later that morning, after breakfast, they walked the bounds of the estate. Malfoy was quiet, pale in the wash of early summer sun. Harry knew Malfoy didn’t want Harry to be there with him, back in this place where neither of them could escape exactly who they had been during the war, but he let Harry take his hand anyway, sighing as though he couldn’t help himself.
“It can’t be just that I’ve fallen in love with you,” he told dream-Malfoy wonderingly, “Can it? Is that why it’s always you?” and Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry and said matter-of-factly, “You have me entirely taken over, I’m afraid. And I like it not, but here we are, and you are my dearest boy, so kiss me now and let me remember it tomorrow.”
“Do you want to put some music on?” Harry asks, and his voice is slightly blurry with tiredness and the low dirty edge of desire as he shivers into Draco’s touch.
He hefts the sword, giving it a few experimental slashes, and from her folding chair Marie calls, “This is embarrassing for all of us, Draco.”
to kill anyone, but with him, there wasn’t any middle ground. It was all so black and white, so unequivocal. I kill Dumbledore, or he kills my parents. I let the Death Eaters into the school, or he kills my parents. There was something cleansing about it, like every bit of choice was being scoured out of me. Once I had decided, once I took the Mark… it all felt so much more simple. He made my choices for me. It was so easy, in the end. So easy.”
He doesn’t know where he is when he wakes, lost in the threads of a nightmare, Sirius stalking the halls of Grimmauld, prison tattoos blurred and softened across his knuckles, the reckless swing of Firewhiskey in his gait, looking straight through Harry as though it were Harry who was the ghost.
said about his subconscious—and then, without fanfare, as though it was something he had done a hundred times before, dream-Malfoy kissed him.
, is it?” Across the room, Dudley twitches, the back of his neck turning purple under his good shirt. Harry can see Hermione’s wand hand tense as she watches Dudley too. He sighs.
Back then, in the early dreams, they were always fighting. It was a proper battle, dirty and noisy, Harry’s stomach curdled with sour fear, the same familiar focused terror of wartime that real-Harry remembered so well.
house. In some ways, Draco looked just like he always had, because he was still handsome and severe, with that thin crooked mouth of his that Harry had liked—so much!—to kiss.
“It has… here, look inside.” Harry leans over, thumbs at the edge of the ring to turn it in Draco’s fingers, and he sees the inscription running around the inside of the ring, its uneven lettering stamping out a declaration of love that’s probably five hundred years old, if Draco’s any judge.
Draco must have heard him before he saw him, because he whirled around, and his face in the firelight was frantic, foreign and unknowable in the shifting shadows, the blade gleaming out of the darkness above him. But it was just for a moment, because whatever he saw in Harry’s face made him drop the blade, and then he was on Harry, hands frantic and assessing and so gentle.
He sighed again, rubbing at his eyes with the heels of his hands, a gesture Harry recognised from other Malfoys down through the dreams, and originally from small real Malfoy, cross and tired all the way across the Great Hall. Malfoy stood up.
Harry knows that Draco understands just how much someone with a broken heart can bear, so he doesn’t need to say anything, but he keeps working on Draco's ribs with a gentle
“She’s very shy,” Draco muttered, twisting around toward the dog. The lead was straining. “She might not like a stranger holding the lead.”
Draco shivers, puts his hands flat against the window glass like he might be able to ward the night off.
Harry nearly gets to Draco, but at the last minute he has to dodge the hag’s piano stool which someone—not the hag herself as she’s still hammering away, standing at the piano—has chucked at him. Draco is on the floor under one of the werewolves, but he doesn’t seem to be coming off the worse in the fight, and as Harry ducks and hits the floor he sees the moment Draco rams the heel of his hand up hard into the werewolf’s throat and knocks him backwards.
“I think intent probably matters,” Harry says. “Probably not a bad idea to have someone who really hated her.”
nonetheless, all of the day’s tension gathering, seething, rising up in the sharp arch of his back and the ungraceful heave of his chest. Harry’s mouth is at his nipple, his voice muffled by Draco’s skin, and he does in fact keep talking, because he’s a cheeky fucker.
The music surges: Muggle songs, Muggle dress code, Muggle-accessible venue, even though Harry doubts by the looks of things that there’s a single Muggle in attendance, and Draco, impeccably dressed in bespoke black tie from Gieves and Hawkes, bought with Harry’s credit card because Draco's salary barely covers his rent and the reparations, and Harry
, and Ron is doing air guitar with one of Dean’s brothers, and the priest, red-faced and jovial, dog collar cutting into his jowls, is dancing a complicated-looking jig with Seamus’s mum.
The wand is still there, even though the preservation spells on the grave have long since faltered; it’s heavy but elegant, a curling spiral of some sort of pale pink stone, unlike any wand Harry has ever seen before.
Draco isn’t wearing his own face either, but Harry would know him anywhere, that nervous energy, the excellent posture, the haughty tilt of his head. Draco's by his side by the time Harry reaches the bar, leaning in to murmur in his ear under cover of the din of the rest of the room.
“I’m sorry,” Harry tells him, and, “I didn’t know this could happen,” and Draco sits down in the chair next to the bed, suddenly, as though his legs won’t hold him anymore.
Saying it out loud sounds so good, but Cynthia only laughs and says, “I hadn’t realised he didn’t already live there, dear, but I’m happy for you. That’s a family home, that is.”
Harry knows that sometimes Draco goes to the library in Grimmauld so he can talk to the portrait of Narcissa and her sisters that hangs on the gallery wall there. He doesn’t do it often, but sometimes Harry hears the rise and dip of girlish voices over Draco’s low murmur, and afterwards Draco always goes straight to bed, pale and red-eyed and defensive. And Harry remembers Draco in Sixth Year, the long, nervy lines of him, the shadows under his eyes, the way he had forgotten about Quidditch and Harry and everything else he had always cared about. Harry thought that maybe it hadn’t been all
“You did it,” Harry tells him, more to soothe than anything else, stroking his damp hair back off his clammy forehead. “We’re in. This is the final stretch.”
is between them. He shuts his eyes and thinks about cutting Draco open in the bathroom, wonders if he should tell Draco that he’s happy he left scars. They don’t speak the whole way back to London.
to justify how sharp and unexpected and vivid they were, so much so that Harry had told himself they couldn’t all be coming from his own head. They had to be some sort of sign of
“How can I forget?” Harry asks him gently. “How could I possibly? I won’t ever. But Draco— don’t you see, none of it is about forgetting? It’s about—”
“We’re going to be working together,” Malfoy said. Harry felt the familiar surge of irritation flood through him. They were naked, lying side by side but not touching. Harry was still breathing heavily, still slippy and wet with Malfoy’s come. He wondered, not for the first time, why Malfoy always had to ruin everything.
something. And then he had nodded, and turned at a sudden noise from the corridor outside, already sliding the sword free—deadly quiet, fast as could be—and was gone without even a backwards glance at Harry, as though trusting that he would follow. And the worst thing, real-Harry thought, was that in the dream, which was already bleeding into the real world as he started to wake, he
Everyone goes very quiet then, which is a relief, and the Healer draws the curtain around the bed and leaves. Draco puts his head in his hands and says, “You’re such a prick. I thought you might be… I thought it was something bad.”
“Did you love her?” Harry asks, because it’s not as though he knows anything about that sort of thing, aunt-wise. “It’s ok if you loved her, even if she didn’t deserve it.”
“Yeah, no shit,” Draco said, and pulled the apple from his pocket. It was a beauty; a gleaming globe, skin the unblemished pink of a blush fading into the fizzy green of new leaves. Draco had kept it tucked in the pocket of his jacket all evening, waiting. It was so very fresh, so very much part of this living world.
“It probably won’t work now anyway,” Draco said, looking apologetically at Harry from under his lashes, before taking Harry’s hand just to check that Harry would still let him. “Do you want to try anyway?”
“After breakfast though,” Draco concedes, and his eyes shut properly as he yawns. He slings an arm over Harry, proprietorial but distracted, almost an afterthought before sleep takes him fully under. Harry closes his eyes against the morning.
International portkeys are an admin nightmare even for a Senior Auror, especially if there isn’t strictly a case number that they can be signed off against. Also, Draco is pretty sure that the Ministry would make things difficult for him if they knew he was leaving the country before his mother’s body has even been buried. So, in the end, they just go to St Pancras and get the first Eurostar out of London, Draco distracted and too pale, Harry carrying their one small holdall on his lap as Draco rests his head on the window and watches the outside flicker silently past.
“Why do you even like him?” she asked sympathetically, and Harry snapped back at her, “I don’t.” Which wasn’t even that much of a lie, he didn’t like Draco—they were teammates, not friends, he just
“What did you want to talk about?” he asks, and wraps some of Draco’s hair around his fist, tugs lightly. “Or will I just shut up and make you come?”
“And definitely Good Queen Bess? Not any of the others? Not that ‘we will fight them on the beaches’ chap? Was he not up for it?”
The next morning he was in such a bad mood that Ron nearly hexed him out of their shared cubicle twice, and everything at work felt even more boring and pointless than usual, and took twice as long so that he was late for teabreak. And when he went to the kitchenette for his cuppa, he found his favourite mug full of perfectly brewed tea, still steaming gently under one of Malfoy’s Stasis Charms, and it felt like the last straw.
Draco chances a glance at Harry then, but he has to look away very quickly at the expression on Harry’s face. Harry loves watching him do magic.
“So you’re basically a dragon king?” Even though this whole thing was Teddy’s idea, he’s not helping with any of the preparations. He also looks deeply unimpressed, though that’s sort of just his face these days.
been, Harry wasn’t wrong, but he was trying not to be, and Harry hadn’t understood that then, or cared) and Draco said he didn’t give a fuck, that he was just here to play and if Harry didn’t like that he could fuck off, and Harry had got him by the neck up against the lockers, and Draco had struggled, and that was the first time Harry had seen what he had done to Draco in the bathroom in Sixth Year. He hadn’t even thought about it much after it happened—it had been a war, after all, and Draco had probably deserved it—but when Draco’s training jersey gaped open at the neck, right under Harry’s fist, and he’d seen the ropey vein of scar tissue, he had felt the sudden sick weight of guilt settle on him. He’d walked away and swore to himself that he’d never fight with Draco again.
“Here,” Draco said, holding out his little mokeskin pouch for Harry to drop it in. “Now. We had better see about that box.” He tucked the pouch into his pocket, then he reached out and clasped Harry’s arm, just above the jut of Harry’s wristbone. His fingers were a warm, solid band.
Harry has left his wand in the bathroom, but he makes a pot of tea by hand because it tastes better that way anyway, and when it’s brewed Draco abandons the Wireless and moves around the kitchen purposefully.
They get home just after ten o’ clock, and everyone else is out. There’s only Ron left, asleep on the sofa, face placid and unmoving, as dependably dreamless as he always was. Harry smiles, sees the same smile on Hermione’s face, and takes her by the hand to go find Draco.
as he loved Harry, probably, but it was a close thing—and Harry loved her by extension, even as she looked at him with the same wary sort of suspicion she always had. She had always said that Harry was trouble, and she had been right in the end.
Not friends yet, but no longer sworn enemies, and Draco was wincing, holding a hand to his side. Teddy, who can’t have been more than three then, was running around hopped up on birthday excitement, and Andromeda had finally allowed Harry to buy him a training broom, and Harry and Draco were quiet and companionable together as they shot Cushioning Charms at the grass. Neither of them wanted to be the one to ruin Teddy’s first fly with an argument. But Draco’s mouth was tight with some sort of pain, and when he laid a careful hand to his hipbone, Harry saw under the hem of his t-shirt a horrid dark bruise, and he remembered the Bludger from earlier, the sound cracking around the stadium and Draco swaying on his broom, and then shaking his head and motioning impatiently for them to play on.
, he thought, if Draco really was trying to raise the dead. It wouldn’t have been just Draco in his best watered silk cloak the colour of the inside of a mouth, and the leftovers from yesterday’s roast chicken on a small plate on the garden table, and Draco’s beautiful hair hanging long and loose under a ridiculous rustling leafy crown that he had clearly made himself.
“It would be a mistake to make this into something sentimental,” Harry says. “Why do you think she used it, really?”
“God, you two are the worst,” he says scornfully. “You just don’t get it.” He sighs heavily, a long-suffering dramatic gust that teenage Draco would have been proud of, and rolls his eyes at Draco before slowing his steps ever so casually until Harry draws up beside him. Draco determinedly doesn’t watch them—he needs to chat to Marie anyway, because he has a long afternoon at a Weasley family get-together ahead, which he needs to complain about in advance to get it all out of his system. But as they all stroll along, he can hear the low, warm rumble of Harry chatting happily, and Teddy’s cheerful replies, and together they all make for home.
“When are you going to stop trying to do this alone?” Harry has to shout, almost, over the din of what feels like the whole pub screaming along with the chorus of the song blaring from the jukebox—Tom Jones this time, who was Vernon’s favourite—and the barman reappears with a new drink for Draco, who just shakes his head. Harry downs it, chasing the burning friction of
Draco is cheerful on the walk, crunching through the churned up, blackened slush along the edge of the pavement, bright against the grey, and when they get to Sylvia’s door she makes them take the half-empty bottle of wine with them, and kisses them both soundly before telling them to get home before they catch their death. Her little beagle watches them balefully from the front window of the house, and Draco taps at her, calling “Daisy, Daisy,” and then smiles delightedly at the demanding scrabble of her claws against the glass.
Harry had eased the bite after one reckless moment, though he didn’t move away. “I don’t normally do this sort of thing,” he murmured into the thin skin of Draco’s ankle. He felt he had to say it, because things were new between them then, and he was still embarrassed by the ferocity of his strange attraction. He wanted Draco to know that he knew it was weird, this urge he had to
“I was going to sit by the river and drink this,” Harry told him, gesturing with the bottle. “But you looked like you could use a hand.”
“That’s fine,” Harry said, not taking his eyes off Malfoy, “I’m quitting anyway.” And at the sight of Malfoy’s thinning mouth, he hastily added, “Not because of—” and waved his hand meaningfully between them. And it was true, he had written his resignation letter weeks before, and it was crumpled and grubby from being carried around in his pocket while he waited for the right time, hardly daring to imagine a day when he didn’t have to come into the DMLE offices and spend all his time trying desperately to not mind how much of an effort it all was.
him, for fuck’s sake. And he had gone home and slept the day away and woken in the cool creeping fuzz of dusk, and when he tongued at the raw skin of his mouth and felt the stubble burn there, he hated himself just a bit.
“A pub isn’t really the place for it though, is it?” Harry said, and Ron looked around pointedly at all the other tables with dogs lying underneath or tucked up on their owners’ laps, and the drinking bowls the pub had set out against the wall, and the half-empty jar of dog treats on the windowsill.
The Ritz is the closest place they can see where they might manage to find food, so they stumble into the foyer just before midnight and ask for a table at the bar. To his credit, the receptionist receives them with barely a flicker of an eyebrow, possibly because even though Draco hasn’t slept in thirty hours, and is clutching a battered old holdall, he's clearly old money.
They kiss until Harry feels like he needs to lie down, and though Draco's hard in his jeans, his hands are shaking too much to undo the buttons of Harry’s shirt. He follows Harry to the bed eagerly though, but Harry just kisses up the inside of his wand arm into the crease of his elbow and then pushes him down, gently, to heal him up.
“Less than an hour ago. I intercepted the Azkaban Floo alert. I’m so sorry, Malfoy. Draco. I’m sorry.”
“Malfoy, listen,” Harry says. “You need to keep smiling at me, okay? Just keep dancing and keep smiling for a few minutes, and then we can get out of here.”
,” Hermione hisses to Harry when they’re doing the washing up one evening, Malfoy playing cards with Theo and Padma at the big kitchen table behind them.
When Harry gets down to the kitchen, the kettle is boiling, and Draco is fiddling with the radio, looking dissatisfied, moving from station to station through the soft hiss of static.
There’s a brief moment when Harry thinks Draco's going to break something, or someone, but the smile hardly falters.
Harry wondered if there was any possible universe in which Malfoy wasn’t an absolute dick about his dad, but then dream-Malfoy raised Harry’s hand and pressed a kiss to the back of it, a close-mouthed gentle courtly type of kiss, nothing dangerous, but Harry felt his pulse kick and gallop just as dream-Harry’s did, and he decided to stop thinking about Lucius completely. This was just a dream after all, and he wasn’t sure how long he’d have here before he woke.
“I most certainly fucking will not,” Malfoy said, startled into loudness, and then he sat down abruptly, uncertainly.
In the end, Ron spoke the old blessings over the body, because Harry didn’t know the words and anyway he didn’t trust his mouth. When Ron stood at the head of the body—one hand resting lightly on that soft over-long fall of hair that Draco had always had to flick out of his eyes—Harry started to cry, and no matter what he did, he couldn’t stop it. His whole face was wet, every bit of him felt sloppy and leaking, and through it all he had to shave Draco’s face—the first step in the funeral ritual, apparently. He ran the razor over Draco’s jawline resentfully, and his hot angry tears kept spilling out. All he could hear were the wet sounds of his pathetic snuffles, the gasp of his caught breaths, the loud raw noises of his humiliating grief. He was glad Draco wasn’t there to witness it.
Afterwards, they didn't have time to linger, and when they were dressed again dream-Malfoy looked just as he always did—unruffled, commanding, unconcerned. But he took Harry's face between his hands and kissed him easily, and then he smiled one of his rare proper smiles, and it was Malfoy there below the surface, the same Malfoy Harry had known in a thousand lifetimes and now got to have for real as well.
mum, she would be the first thing he went looking for, he knew it. Just another reason to be glad that it was Harry—brave Harry, good Harry, unselfish Harry—who had been chosen for this.
remember, of course; their first proper holiday, the endless heat of the elastic days, eating granita in the shaded colonnade of the Basilica of St Cecilia like the worst kinds of tourists, and Draco with his sunburned nose scrunched up against the sharp sting of the lemon, and hours of walking, Harry’s shirt sticking to his back and his limbs feeling soft and loose from too much sun. All the food, and a bottle of wine so ripe and delicious that it made Draco blush with surprise and pleasure and Harry ordered two more bottles to bring home just so he could see that look on Draco’s face again sometime, and crawling into bed too tired to fuck so they had to reach for each other in the mornings instead, finding each other anew in the space of the unfamiliar bed and the different, higher light of a Roman morning, too early, Harry breathless and eager on his back, and the clean arcing blue corridor of sky through the uncurtained skylight of the Airbnb bedroom, Draco golden and soft from too much sun, and pasta, and happiness, Harry thought, even as he twisted his hands gently in Draco’s hair and pressed further into the greedy heat of his mouth.
It was Luna who told him what to do in the end, because she always knew this stuff. But Harry was glad, in a horrible way, to have something to focus on—because when he thought about having to let Draco go for good he felt like he might just crumble under the sheer horror of it. It was better to keep busy, while he could.
“We haven’t done the garden yet,” he says, and Draco groans. “And I thought the shed would be a good place for the lab—” but then Draco pulls away and goes to look out the bedroom window at the long back lawn, still almost impenetrable from twenty years of neglect.
As Malfoy shifted on the grass, the puppy’s quivering nose slid slowly around his side, and Malfoy dropped his arm back and scooped the dog into his lap.
“It can’t hurt to have a woman, either,” is what he said out loud, and it was the right thing to say because Harry brightened right up at that.
Draco helpless for him. It was different when it was just them of course, Draco possessive, almost greedy, rougher sometimes (though Harry liked that too), his hand covering first Harry’s mouth, then his own, to muffle the sounds he made when Harry touched him back.
“You’re late,” Draco said, and reached for the Resurrection Stone. He had to prise Harry’s fingers open ungently to get at it where it lay cool and solid in the crease of Harry’s palm.
He kisses Harry on the mouth then, though he’s still talking, making quiet little encouraging gasps at the touch of Harry’s tongue, and saying, “Or maybe all three of us, I thought about that too, the night of my party and you storming around being cross with everyone and then you were talking to him for so long, and he kept looking at you, and I was watching…”
He fumbled his glasses off, and beside him, Luna patted his shoulder, and Pansy told him crossly that all this crying before the body was ready was going to invite bad spirits in, but getting to be mean to Harry always seemed to cheer her up a bit, and he knew none of them really believed all of that nonsense anyway.
simple though. Not at first, not when… when I was trying to work out if I could— if I wanted to— I mean, I didn’t
“I thought you were too tired?” Harry says, and he leans up and over and presses Draco back into the pillow. “
“Have you ever considered getting an earring?” he asked instead, then pulled Malfoy in so he could take Malfoy’s earlobe in his teeth, curl his tongue over the velvety skin at the hinge of Malfoy’s jawline.
“Hi, Peggy,” Harry said quietly, reaching a loose fist out to the dog for her to sniff. She gave his hand a cursory nuzzle then retreated back into Malfoy’s embrace, and watched Harry warily. Her head, cocked to one side, was almost square, the white fur ruffled into tufts, and her body looked too small to support it. Her ears were small triangular flaps, her eyes a clear amber, her paws like small shovels at the end of short bowed legs.
“Potter? What are you doing here?” he asked, and then the dog ducked in behind him with a small squeak, and Malfoy dropped his sushi.
, and being here with Draco, and watching the languid shadow of fresh snow clouds passing over his uptilted face through the glass of the dome while he sings, “look up, and trust, and live.” It’s
“How did they make a Resurrection Stone big enough to carve a wand out of?” Draco asks, voice sluggish, eyes shut, hair streaming over the mound of pillows.
“I knew you were busy this evening.” Draco's voice sounds rusty, congested. “I got a tip… there was a man… Well, I couldn’t risk waiting in case I missed him.”
He’d closed Draco’s eyes himself, left claret smears over the pale petals of Draco’s eyelids as he’d thumbed them shut, which was better at least than having to look at them, sightless and dark with terror.
“I’ve told you before, I won’t deal with you when you’re in a mood.” He sounded tired, Harry thought. “Go away and have a walk and come back when you’re ready to go over the Littlegate file properly.”
Harry didn’t know what to say, because he could feel the slow familiar bloom of panic deep in his chest, and everything felt too small and dangerous now he was actually here, with the same heavy tick of the kitchen clock, and the fuzzy murmur of the television from the next room, and knowing Petunia was just down the hall. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t feel like he could eat the biscuit. He knew he could. This wasn’t his home any more, and he was here on business, and he didn’t care about the fact that the biscuits were for Dudley. He just didn’t want it, not with this sick curling ribbon of tension spooling through him.
“Okay.” Draco squeezed his hand, then turned so he could put his arms around Harry. “But if we weren’t on the clock…”
and there was that first kiss in the Manor again, and that wasn’t even the best of them. There had been so many of them, Harry couldn’t hope to remember them all—kiss after kiss after kiss, strung out over the years but not enough, and Harry had thought, foolishly, that there would always be more time...
“You hate this though,” Draco says, twisting his arm upwards so the Mark is on show. His skin is still pinked up and plump from the hot bath, and the Mark is just a darker stain, nothing much anymore, its edges furred and indistinct, faded to a dull pink.
Ginny was sitting on the kitchen counter, swinging her legs and eating some of the good biscuits out of the biscuit barrel. With every beat of her heels against the cereal cabinet, she left a dusty smear.
bow and arrow, and the Malfoy with the full golden beard who Harry had only seen for a brief glimpse but who had told dream-Harry, “I know you prefer me clean-shaven but…” before real-Harry had been woken by his alarm, and before he could tell that dream-Malfoy, “Well, actually…”—and how they all liked Harry so much more than real-Malfoy did, and he was fucking sick of it.
it, never actually told Draco all the things he thinks every day. Like how having him brings everything into a sharper focus, and how Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever get enough of him but he’d like to try, or even how he’s glad he didn’t have him back at school, because if he had he might not have walked into the Forest so willingly to die.
with death, but as the cloaking wards drop and the small graveyard coalesces and becomes visible, he sees the symbol etched into the headstone and knows, somehow, why Draco thought this would be the right place.
Draco was standing in front of the open cupboard, and he had the box in his hand. There was no sign of Petunia.
The pub is called the Red Lion, and Harry thinks Draco might have chosen it on purpose, just for the name. It’s just off the docks in Southampton, Tudor panelling and an ornate carving of a lion over the door, and the carpet inside is sticky with spilled drinks and maybe worse.
“We’re taking this little fella with us,” he announced, and Dean scratched under the dog’s chin until its whole little body went limp with ecstasy. “I’m calling him Bran.”
It was just that Petunia was still there, that was all, standing in the doorway, ribs straining with her rage, the rattle of her outraged breaths keeping Harry at a distance. He remembered how angry she could get.
“Okay,” Harry tells him, “okay. I’ve got you,” and he carefully unwinds Draco’s hair from around his fist.
after Draco died—what he was supposed to do with the body, how he was supposed to organise the funeral—and he didn't
“You can get it back later,” he told Harry. “After I’ve fucked you. Just stop thinking about it for a while, okay? I want you to come back to me now, all the way back.”
In a way, they didn’t feel like dreams at all. Malfoy was always in them, and he always seemed very much himself, with the same handsome crooked smile and strong hands and that arresting silvery hair.
“I thought you liked it intense,” Draco says, but his voice is blurred around a yawn, the outbreath of it humid against Harry’s throat.
But Harry was too possessive of Draco, still. He couldn’t have given him over to anyone else, couldn’t have sent him away a second before he absolutely had to, not even when having him meant only this cruel mockery of what had been.
“Who was he?” he asks Draco, wondering if Draco can tell what he’s thinking, wondering what he’ll do to the guy if he ever finds him.
But now Malfoy was back in England, and Harry was starting to wonder if he was just using the dreams to try and justify things to himself—if he had taken that same old fucking fascination he’d always had with Malfoy, and turned it on its head, and done something very stupid with it. And he couldn’t even tell Ron about it.
“I’ll just finish this up,” Malfoy told him, scribbling furiously at the very bottom of a sheet of notepaper, already crammed with his elegant swooping handwriting. “Would you please see it to the field post office in the morning, before…”
“They’ve sent her some of their prototypes and ideas for defensive spellwork. She’s aware of the urgency.” Around them, the room swelled with a hollow waiting feeling for a moment before the muffled boom of an explosion sounded in the distance. Pansy was leading the Thamesside patrol tonight, Draco knew. He wondered how the wards were holding up.
It wasn’t always like this with them—neither of them had a proper bed, even Harry over at Whitehall just slept in shifts in a shared office, but every so often they found the space to go as slow as they liked. They were so close to the sky up here, suspended out of time. It was hard to remember that they needed to think about anything at all except the deepening burn of muscles as they rocked against each other, and the sweet humidity of their shared breaths when their mouths met.
So he couldn’t take Draco back to the Manor—couldn’t bear to be reminded of the ghost of Draco’s mouth on his for the first time, the memory of the feel of him under Harry’s hands, the way they’d slid down the wall and kissed against the wainscoting, Harry landing half in Draco’s lap, the very real heat of him a delicious surprise. It had been worth the wait.
There’s a density to the air back there, layer upon ancient layer of Muggle-repelling charms and Muffliatos and cloaking charms, and as Harry keeps walking the wards shiver around him and let him through, plucking at his magical core as he goes, with that detached curiosity of old magic, something questing, with an edge of malice he’s not quite sure he likes.
Malfoy, incongruously, in a boat—a tiny thing, hide stretched over wood, the sweet elegant curve of the prow beckoning them forward, behind them nothing but the rocky rise of a small island, ahead of them nothing but sea the same grey as Malfoy’s eyes. Harry in a cream wool jumper the twin of Malfoy’s, both of them with sleeves rolled up against the pull of the oars. Harry leaned forward, and as often happened, dream-Harry took over and let the words come. “Le chéile, mo chuisle,” he told Malfoy, and Malfoy grinned at him, white teeth against skin a darker gold than Harry would have imagined for him, eyes creased against the sun, hair tucked under a flat tweed cap, and what the fuck even
“Sometimes,” Harry says, “sometimes I think about him. Not for me, I mean. But for you. Like that time”—he swallows—“when I saw you with him. I think about that sometimes.”
, it’s a fucking baby, but he’s smiling like he feels the same as Harry, terrified by an excess of joy, like he’s getting something he really wants but doesn’t deserve. That look, more than anything, makes Harry think that maybe they’re going to do this, maybe they
that could happen, and all he can think about is the smell of fresh paint, and Draco’s books still all in boxes in the tiny sitting room, and now—too soon? Too unexpected?—maybe a baby.
And as Harry lay in bed worrying about the dream, he remembered how dream-Malfoy had looked then, smiling back at him with something like relief, like Harry smiling at him
But no, he thinks, in Harry’s dreams Malfoy doesn’t have tired lines around his eyes, and he doesn’t have any scars, especially not so many, flickering in and out of Harry’s vision with every shift of his collar as Malfoy moves restlessly, baring his throat to Harry’s mouth. In Harry’s dreams, Malfoy’s fingers are more sure, more demanding. Dream Malfoy always takes what he wants, but this must be real, because this Malfoy is cautious, waiting for Harry to move again, watching Harry from under his downturned translucent lashes that Harry has never seen this close up.
jealous in the way he always has been—greedy for the people he loves, never getting quite as much of them as he wants.
There are kittens in the drawer, tumbling over each other, paws batting gently at the air. Harry remembers the dream of the night before—he was Remus this time, Harry’s dream self coiled and sheathed in fur, ready to spring, moon-mad—and touches the tip of his tongue to each incisor, carefully testing for too-sharpness.
It’s not ungentle, but Draco’s fingers are firm enough that Harry can only focus on them, the slow, intent push and retreat, and Draco breathing hard into Harry’s hair, and the whole dark stretch of night ahead of them through the fogged-up window. When Draco pushes into him with a small muffled noise of surrender, Harry finally closes his eyes, the better to feel each satisfying intrusion, and he thinks he could just stay like that, suspended against glass, stuffed full, all night. He’s fairly sure he’s too tired to come, but then he feels it start to build, from the friction of his underwear cutting into his knees where Draco shoved them down, and the tweak of Draco’s fingers at his nipple, and the sudden distant cutting arc of car headlights reminding him it’s not just the two of them awake and alone in the night. He comes all over the window, slipping through the smears when Draco finally presses into him hard and stills, murmuring something soft-sounding and relieved into the back of Harry’s neck.
Harry comes, quietly, hips a slow stutter, all over Draco’s hand, and Draco whispers, “That’s good, that’s so good, I only want you, it’s only ever you,” because he can say things like that at times like these, when it’s just them in the dark, so close together that they shape themselves around each other.
“It should be Harry,” Ron said, and Pansy looked at him across the room angrily but nodded, and Harry could hear Theo crying very quietly, and then Ginny went and took the cloth from Luna gently and handed it to Harry.
and it was the summer Harry turned twenty-one and he was miserable all the time, and even being on a broom every day didn’t help, and he didn’t know what to do. And he was just out of training, desperate to get home or be anywhere else other than the training ground, only when he hit the changing room Draco was leaning against the physio’s table, gingerly rolling his shoulder as he waited to be seen. He was topless and unselfconscious, stretching all the fine bones of his spine and relaxing, his upper arms pale as milk above the line where his golden summer tan stopped.  He was talking to Macauley, laughing up at him with something like ease, and then he caught Harry’s eye for just a moment and there was that flicker of the old animosity before he smiled, small and careful.
It takes months to get the house right, but they start with the kitchen so at least there’s tea and Harry can cook, and once the bathroom is sorted out Harry starts sleeping there even though they haven’t touched the bedroom yet, because Grimmauld is too awful, heaving with memories and hardly any of them good. He hadn’t been sure if the cottage would be any better, but after a while it feels like so much more than the place where his parents died. It's quiet, and the nightmares aren’t as bad there, and even though they can’t see the sea from the house, Harry can smell it on the air whenever he opens a window.
Narcissa had Owled to say that she wanted to hold the funeral at the Manor, have Draco interred in the family crypt. And really, Draco might have preferred that. He’d always loved the Manor, even after he moved out and into the shitty little flatshare, and after that again when he was spending most of his time at Grimmauld even if neither he nor Harry had ever really officially discussed living together.
“They got out of talks three hours ago,” he said. “They’ve agreed to stand with us. No negotiation with terrorists, the PM said, and they’ve promised officially that they’ll recognise Kingsley as the legitimate head of the magical administration.”
Draco wasn’t looking skyward, though. He was pacing, his stupid silky cloak and his long fall of hair fluttering behind him like raised flags, battle standards. He went widdershins around the cauldron, mouth moving silently as he tread the circle again and again.
Andrew, up on the altar and not looking in the least bit cold, is all in robes the colour of a fresh bruise or the thin skin of a plum, which make his eyes look even darker. By the time he says, “He is risen, Alleluia!” and smiles his sudden, lovely smile when everyone echoes the Alleluia back to him, Harry can no longer feel his feet.
“Is this a new fashion, Potter?” Draco asks Harry as they stand side-by-side at the bar, and then he turns and leans, effortless, and smiles his special, glittering smile—the one Harry remembers from school—at Paz Shacklebolt, who smiles back lazily and starts crossing the dancefloor.
“Well.” Ron sounded amused, because he was a prick of the highest order when it came to annoying Harry. “Because of the whole…”
This close, it’s easier, with his face in Harry’s curls—smelling of smoke and sky from the night flight across London—and the long smooth stretch of Harry’s solid flank under his hand.
And it was just as well, because he could hardly remember all the times that he had gone for weeks or months without any dreams at all, because they had started up again with a vengeance, and Harry’s nights were a furious barrage of Malfoy after Malfoy after Malfoy.
“Harry,” Malfoy said breathlessly, and it was so new, still, to hear his name in Malfoy’s mouth, especially when he said it like that. Harry dropped to his knees, and Malfoy’s hand found its way into his hair as he started on the fastenings of Malfoy’s trousers, Malfoy’s grip on him too rough and shocked and so completely right.
He’s careful, when he takes Draco in his arms, not to push him up against the wall like he might otherwise, and they lie down on the crumpled dust sheet and Harry kisses Draco until he’s dizzy. “Is that the fumes?” he asks, and he doesn’t even mind that Draco laughs and laughs and then flicks his wand at the sash windows so they heave themselves up, but even when the fresh air rushes in, so different from the heavy London breeze, Harry still feels lightheaded. He closes his eyes.
In fact, he had tried it after they brought the body back from the hospital, and everyone had tactfully left to give Harry time alone to say his goodbyes, or some other awful idea that made no sense at all. Because when Harry thought about it, it seemed impossible that anyone would expect him to wrap up everything that had happened into some kind of farewell.
“You were summoning him?” Harry asked flatly, feeling the prickle of the chill October wind on the back of his neck.
“House cats,” Harry says, and in the distance they hear the heavy slam of the front door, raised voices, something merry and familiar. Everyone’s home.
, I wouldn’t have… not if there was a chance with you, I wouldn’t have wanted to mess it up with someone else. That night, at the party. I was thinking about you.”
“Harry and I…” Draco sighs. “I don’t know if I’ll ever have children. I didn’t have the best role model, you know. And Harry. Well, Harry already has you.”
It had been so long, and Draco couldn’t quite help the small swaying movement of his body further into Harry’s, and he felt Harry begin to smile against his neck.
Harry thinks about it, about Draco up at the top of the church, hair silvered up in the divine light from the dome, pale and severe and buttoned up from throat to ankles, and he likes it, of course he likes it, but it’s got nothing on the real Draco who’s right here under him, breathing hard, with his stupid bright blue pants shoved down around his thighs, and his hair all tangled up in Harry’s fingers, and his plate of biscuits forgotten on the coffee table.
that wand, and real-Harry could remember the silky slide of alder under his fingers, and the easy magic of the tools—lathe and chisel and gouge—and the feel of being satisfied, of the knowledge that he had done
“Tell me about the wand,” Draco says, his voice muffled by Harry’s skin. Harry breathes in from the cold press of the window and out against the solid heat of Draco at his back, taken over.
Easter has all the best hymns, Draco had said, and now Harry sneaks a look at him as he sings. On Draco’s other side, Sylvia has an arm through his, and they’re singing different parts of the same hymn, each one taking an answering line in a weird little conversational piece that’s making them both grin. Sylvia is louder, but Draco is sweeter and more tuneful, and Harry looks at the words in the hymn sheet and falls for them all over again—the simple melodiousness, the incomprehensible dialogue, the inexplicable inclusion of weird imagery about murderous blots and patient hearts, and Harry wonders, like he always does, if all these hymns are meant to sound like love songs, or if it’s just all
He was always doing that, these days. Reaching out for Harry, touching him casually, like he couldn’t really help himself. He didn’t care that Ginny was watching and rolling her eyes, or that Hermione was sighing from the hall doorway and gesturing at them to come on. Harry liked it, liked the feeling that he
“I just wanted to make sure the old hag is really dead,” Draco says carelessly, but he shifts closer, rocking gently on his heels to keep the baby asleep. “Are you okay?” he asks Harry in a voice so low it might almost be a whisper.
Harry didn’t know what to do after Draco died. He didn’t just mean that he didn’t know what to do with himself—with his empty hands, his empty bed, the persistent pain as his stubborn heart just kept on beating no matter how pointless it seemed—though that was true too.
Harry groans, takes Draco’s mouth under his own like he can’t help himself, teeth to lip in a flash of something a little bit wild and wanting, then tongue to tongue, too eager to be gentle, and Draco opens up for him, already overheated and squirming.
“Oh,” Draco says, stupidly, and then shuts his mouth tightly, not trusting himself, and Harry pushes it onto his finger clumsily and then smiles at him helplessly, sheepishly, like he can’t stop and doesn’t want to, and Draco feels cold and then hot all of a sudden so he has to put his face right in the curve of Harry’s neck and just breathe him in for a minute.
“Well then,” Harry said, and though Draco’s hands were still pulling him close, he was very still. “I suppose we’re sticking around for the same reason.”
Night patrol was pointless anyway. Any trouble between the Muggles and the magical kids had died down early on, and nowadays the nights inside the Abbey were quiet. Peaceful, almost, if it wasn’t for the distant sound of battle at the edge of the wards. Sanctuary, the Muggles called this place when they started to arrive after the first attacks, trailing in from offices and shops and restaurants all through Whitehall, in their suits and good shoes, expensive haircuts and designer eyewear and leather handbags and hope. There hadn’t been time to go home, when Voldemort struck. None of them even knew if there were still homes to go to. Their communication devices were on the blink from all the warding spells, and none of them had been allowed outside of the safe zone since the day it happened. They were always asking Draco for updates, some of them still hoping there might be something—or someone—left to return home to. Draco always pleaded ignorance. It was kinder that way, he thought, because every night, filtering through the huge windows of the triforium he could see a constant frantic reddish glow. It looked as though a lot of London was burning, and maybe hope was the only thing that would keep them all going.
She flapped a hand lazily over Draco—over the body—in a shooing motion, and then allowed it to rest, gently, momentarily, on the spot under which Draco’s heart used to beat. “Go on,” she said spitefully for Harry’s benefit, leaning over Draco, whispering in his ear just like she always had. “Don’t hang around for him. He’s done enough damage.”
“Is she supposed to be so spotty?” Harry asks, and then they’re both laughing, Draco red-eyed from tiredness and Harry wincing at every twinge of movement in his stomach, and the Healer rolls her eyes at them, and then the baby makes a mewling sound of protest and burrows harder against Harry’s chest, and they both go quiet.
“Potter,” he says threateningly, rifling through the biscuit barrel. “If you’ve eaten all the Cocoa Glaciers, so help me…”
He had let them take the body away after a while, though in the end they’d had to charm him calm to dull him enough that he let go of Draco. He was distantly surprised at the ferocity of his grief, how the self-pitying pull of it threatened to tug him under, how it had scraped all his behaviour down to the raw bare bones of his own desperate sorrow. Nothing mattered, it felt like, nothing but this loss, and it settled into him, persistent and ever-present. He didn't think it would be going away any time soon.
“Open the window, for fuck’s sake,” Pansy said when they all trooped back in, and instead of waiting for Harry to do it, she went over to the big casement and shoved it up violently. “The last thing you want is his ghost hanging around,” she told Harry. “Although,”—her mouth was over-lipsticked, a dangerous red, like a useful weapon— “I suppose, knowing you, you wouldn’t mind keeping him here. Well, it’s not happening.”
Harry was exhausted, and it was Monday morning after a long weekend full of bad decisions, and he hadn’t been sleeping well, and the last thing he wanted was to talk about Malfoy.
Draco doesn’t even think he really is that good with Teddy. He remembers the early days after he and Harry started out, Teddy aged ten and getting taller, but still building elaborate castles out of bricks, and playing dangerous made-up games with Harry, and eyeing Draco suspiciously across the dinner table. Harry had wanted them to get along so badly, and Draco had been so awful around children in general, not having been a particularly nice one himself. But this quiet angry Teddy is much easier for Draco to understand, and anyway he’d never stop trying for Harry’s sake.
And Harry wanted to reply, to tell him that he understood, but the dream was receding, candlelight blinking out into the cool morning stillness of real-Harry's own bedroom at Grimmauld.
“Maybe I will.” Harry stuck his tongue out at her retreating figure, and Luna kicked him gently under the table. “I
Harry walks through the Muggle part, which is quiet for a Thursday. There’s an ominous wind biting through off the Solent, and the lights in the pub are already flickering anxiously in the face of the incoming storm.
“The bar is shut to non-residents, I’m afraid,” the receptionist tells them with what feels like genuine sympathy.
, that it must have been written all over his face, that sort of muscular lean wartime love of his. He had no room for anything else; there was war, but mostly there was Harry, and that was all Draco had room for. Even the Muggles all knew, calling out to Draco to ask him where his boyfriend was whenever Harry was away, or giving him a sly elbow when they watched the press conferences with Harry’s face all over the big screen, open and lit up and transformed.
“Our Fearless Leader,” was what the Muggle teenagers from Westminster School who were camped out in Poet’s Corner called him. “O Captain, My Captain.
“Do you want to see?” Draco pulled him towards the cauldron, which wasn’t exactly a no, Harry thought, but there would probably have been more blood, and maybe things would have been a bit more
“It’s time to wash him now,” Luna said, and then Harry saw Ginny coming back into the room with a pitcher of water, the surface mirrored and trembling as she crossed the room.  Luna picked up a cloth.
Draco says, “What about yellow? A proper yellow, like the window panel in that gallery in Rome, remember?” and he’s off down the paint aisle of the big B&Q in Peckham.
It didn’t feel anything like when Dobby had died—there was no sense of purpose, no grim satisfaction in hard work, no losing himself in a simple act of honour. It was just the bare, terrible fact of Draco’s dead body, the senselessness of him being gone, and Harry having to uncoil the snarled angry mess of his own misery for long enough to take care of all these small, mundane deeds.
“I knew you’d come back,” Harry says to Sirius, though the minute the words are out he wants to steal them back. He can feel Malfoy looking at him.
Malfoy flying high over patchwork fields real-Harry didn’t recognise, leaning low over a clumsy-looking broom, hair sleek and parted down the middle, sporting a thin moustache that was less stupid-looking than it should have been, Harry in the air beside him, both of them swooping into dives and laughing, always laughing.
He’s in the library, sitting in the big creaky swivel chair, staring into the top drawer of the desk. He’s smiling too.
And Harry had found Draco’s hand and held on, the tips of his fingers wedged into the dents between Draco’s knuckles, and he had said, “No,” like that meant anything at all, then “Draco.” He'd
And then the baby arrives, very early in the morning after the longest night of Harry’s life. It’s terrible and awful all at once, because Harry can barely move in the bed from pain and exhaustion and that blank sort of terror that comes with not knowing what you’re doing but having to get through it anyway, and Draco is white-faced and shaking, and neither of them has slept all night. But then the Healer passes the baby to Harry, and Draco leans over them both, his hand a protective curl around the baby’s soft velvety head, and she blinks her eyes open momentarily before settling again, fists against her cheeks, body dense with sleep as she lies on Harry’s chest.
“Harry.” Malfoy’s voice is thin. “Please.” His hip twitches forward, knocks against the inside of Harry’s wrist. “You know I wouldn’t ever… I wouldn’t do anything…”
Harry presses a hand between them, pushes it up under Draco’s t-shirt so he can feel his skin, runs his fingers along the ridge of the scars there.
The Healer says, “Mr Potter, you’re pregnant,” and at what she must see in Harry’s face, “I take it this comes as a surprise?” And Harry barely makes it to the sink before he’s sick again, only this time the shivers start, and he hadn’t known this was even a
“We should take a trip,” Draco says, like he always does whenever they’re standing on the upper concourse under the delicate metal spines of the curving roof. The glass gleams with snow. “We should go to Paris.”
“I hoped you’d do it for me,” he says, and leans in, voice low and confidential. “I already got us a room.” The music pauses, a quick beat timed to the skip in Harry’s heartbeat, then a new song kicks in, something slow and bluesy and romantic. The group of women starts circling, arms around each other, high-heeled feet kicking and twirling, all of them surrounding a woman in a fluffy white veil wearing a Bride-to-Be sash.
“It’s very plain,” Harry says, frowning, and Draco laughs shakily. “There was another, with a sapphire… anyway, Fand said… But, you will, won’t you? Marry me?”
“You need to think about therapy,” Hermione tells him the next morning, not unkind about it but impatient, eyes shadowed with exhaustion and her mouth tight. Her hands tremble as she wraps clingfilm around her sandwiches, though when she slips into her new work shoes—sharp-heeled and shiny-reflective—she’s taller, more distracted, as though in her own mind she’s already walking out the door. She thinks Harry has to learn to help himself, and maybe she’s not wrong.
“I was going to say trust,” Harry shrugs, tightening his grip, letting his thumb rub a caress over Draco’s pulsepoint. “I was just going to say that I trust you now. You don’t believe in God, and you didn’t believe in Voldemort, and you were stupid, and so awful, and so wrong about so many things. I know all that. Just… trust me back, okay? I
. But Draco had just said shakily, “I should hope not, most distracting, here… let me…” and all the while he was skidding unsteadily down the ladder until he was bracketed in Harry’s arms and Harry could press himself against Draco’s back and slip two fingers around his body and into the gap between buttons on his shirt. “You make me feel helpless,” Draco said crossly, breathlessly, arching back further into Harry’s arms, and Harry tightened his hold and bit at Draco’s soft earlobe, at the tender skin of his neck, at the muscle of his shoulder through his t-shirt…
, you absolute dick,” Harry groans, and he sits up to take off his t-shirt. “I never wanted him like
“I hate you too,” dream-Malfoy had replied sweetly, and that had been the end of the dream, except when Harry woke up he had felt inexplicably sad, like he was grieving over something.
“I thought I’d find you here,” dream-Harry said, and real-Harry shivered at the tone of his own voice, so knowing and amused and horribly fond. Dream-Harry didn’t seem to care at all that Malfoy could hear it.
The hag is singing now, voice like smoke, and Harry wonders if Draco has requested the song, because the song is about an apple too,
care that Malfoy was back, he had in fact already known. Because he had spent most of Friday night in bed with Malfoy, both of them half drunk, dazed with a kind of feverish desire that was still shocking to Harry, even though it wasn’t even the first time they’d fucked (not even the second, or the third, or the fourth, in fact).
“It’s not a good idea,” Ron supplied cheerfully over the top of the cubicle divider, and Malfoy put his head in his hands. “There’s a rule against it. It’s in the handbook.” Which was probably correct, now that Harry thought about it, that stupid handbook which had been the biggest shock of them all when he started training, with all its dry legalese and admin standards. Harry hadn’t expected any of that.
“Luckily for you, I was there to cover when your Apparition jump was flagged. I told Robards it was an evidence check for the Brindlefair case.”
while they’re being very deliberately polite to each other. Sylvia laughs out loud when Andrew sails back up the aisle without saying goodbye to Harry, and when Harry takes her arm to walk her home through the snow, he pinches her gently and says, “Behave.”
“You know you don’t have to do any of it,” he said. “We could break the wand, find another way. Or we could both just leave. No one would even have to know we were going, if we take the cloak. Let everyone else figure it out, get on a ferry before they shut the ports down. Go somewhere hot where the drinks are cheap and we can actually fuck in a bed for once.”
“They can try,” Malfoy sounded pleased, like Harry was telling him the punchline of some private joke, and that was all it took, that sly shared smile that had Harry wanting like he didn’t think he’d ever wanted before.
“And then your kids will be able to call it up too?” Teddy asks when he’s finished laughing (he hates Lucius about as much as everyone else, though Draco is relieved that he’s not in the least bit scared of him, which is a beautiful thing to see). His face clears then tightens up. He suddenly looks older.
“Maybe you should take her out to dinner, though make sure it’s somewhere nice,” Malfoy suggests, which is a bit rich considering that he’s sitting in just his pants on the old horsehair couch in the back sitting room, shovelling the contents of a green Pot Noodle into his mouth. Harry can see tiny globular flecks of oil gleaming like constellations on his bare chest where he’s dripped the noodle juice. Harry had thought at first that the more remote Hermione got, the more Malfoy seemed to like her, but he’s starting to understand that Malfoy being kind about her is something calculated, something deliberate. Malfoy wants her to stay because
“Fair enough,” he says, and because they’re already late anyway he undoes his seatbelt so he can kiss Draco back into the headrest as the car rocks gently in the wake of passing traffic.
“My hero,” Harry said, and he finally—finally—holstered the Elder Wand, and Draco could breathe properly again. “Want some?”
“I know you were very young.” Harry is careful. He can feel Draco quivering minutely, tiny little shivers, almost imperceptible, through the sole of his foot which is still wedged against Draco’s ribcage. “I know how you feel about it
“Still no sign?” dream-Harry asked, and real-Harry looked curiously down the road that dream-Malfoy was watching so carefully.
“Do you think,” Draco says, leaning over the handbrake, pressing his thumb to Harry’s mouth, “that you could love me as much if I didn’t love
“Yes,” Draco answers agreeably, then opens an eye suspiciously and rolls in the bed to face him. “But we can’t keep it, of course. You understand that, Potter? We’ll have to hand it into Mysteries or something.”
As she spoke, she wrenched the curtains back fully. Outside, through the muddy warp of old glass, the sky was a clear, pale grey like the inner ring of Draco’s irises had been. When Pansy turned, Harry could see the thin lines of strain around her eyes. Draco had loved her for a long time—not as
It’s raucous behind the wards. There’s a hag hammering songs out on an old piano, loud and wild and discordant, with some of the keys being pressed by something Harry can’t see, invisible fingers battering out the counterpoint to the hag’s melody. At the bar, someone already has a knife to someone else’s throat, though the barman looks bored and Harry thinks that it might be foreplay of some kind, and anyway there’s no blood drawn yet. Far in the distance, from what sounds like an upper room, someone is screaming. Normally, this sort of thing would be Harry’s business. But not tonight.
“And with that touching declaration, I have finally reached the end of my tether,” Ron says from behind them, and Draco goes to shoulder him but remembers the baby at the last minute and glares instead. “And these sandwiches are shit, mate. Can we choose to love you somewhere else?”
They follow along with the kneeling and the standing and the sitting, and Seamus makes everyone cry with his vows, and then everyone stands to sing, and just as the church is ringing with a hymn, Harry feels a hand on his shoulder and the smell of suncream and fresh smoke,
“Well. Good.” Harry still sounds cross, but he’s slowing down a bit, voice low and sweet with breathless anticipation. “Because,” he continues, “I don’t like it.” He pauses, shakes his curls back off his face, then holds himself tense, as Draco moves down his body. “I don’t like it when… Draco—” and he pushes himself upwards with a groan, chasing Draco’s mouth with his hips, muffling his own sounds against the back of his hand. His body curves gracefully, like a wingspan or the clean arc of a harbour bridge, opening skywards.
“Why didn’t you wait for me?” Harry asks, and when Draco doesn’t answer Harry catches the barman’s eye and points at Draco's glass. Behind Draco, a group of women on a hen party drop coins into a big old jukebox and scream as Abba begins to blare from the speakers.
“Mmmm,” Draco says disapprovingly, but Harry sees his eyes flicker, and remembers that he lost his mother too.
“She’s beautiful,” Harry said, enchanted by her suspicious sideways glare, the raised snaky line of scar tissue over the curve of her snout, her precisely-shorn underbelly with an old surgical mark meandering over the velvet of her flesh. “She’s really perfect, Malfoy.”
Harry felt that if he could just tell Malfoy about the dreams, then Malfoy would understand. That Harry was quite possibly driving himself mad thinking about Malfoy during the day, and then having to see versions of him at night too. And he wanted to tell Malfoy about the dream he’d had of them together, in which the two of them looked almost exactly as they did now, only there was something easier in the lines of their faces, something less hunted. Harry didn’t think that this dream-Malfoy and dream-Harry had ever been in a war.
“There’s a new packet of Toffypops in the top cupboard,” Harry tells him, and makes his escape with the pot of tea before Draco can complain too much, though the sound of Draco muttering “I can get those in Sainsbury’s anytime, I wanted Cocoa Glaciers,” follows him up the stairs.
“Well, don’t then,” Harry whispers back, viciously, and throws his scourer into the sudsy water and storms out, the restless flickering sound of shuffling cards fading behind him.
Without looking back, he calls, “I’m ready”, and hears Marie muttering something unimpressed-sounding to Harry, and Harry laughs again. It’s a big deal that she’s even here with them, but she has a soft spot for Teddy, and he’s about the only person she can never say no to. Also, Draco thinks she’s looking for distractions—she’s scared, because she broke a rib coughing three days ago, and she’s been spending a lot of time with her mum recently too. He closes his eyes for a second and wishes as hard as he can—like he’s been wishing for four years now—that she’ll finally think about going to St Mungos. He and Hermione are so close with the new legislation. He just hopes they’ll be in time for Marie.
The sun had fully set, only the faintest, hazy line of light left at the horizon, and Harry was still in his slippers, and he very nearly went back in to the washing up and the Wireless and the lure of an uneventful early night, but then Draco picked up the knife.
“Peggy doesn’t look like she minds,” Harry told him, and as though she already understood her name, Peggy shifted in Malfoy’s lap, stretched her four paws out expansively, settling in. She looked at Harry, and he felt the cold nudge of her damp nose against the inside of his wrist, and then the rasp of her tongue, tentative at first.
.” Harry didn’t mind that so much, the sort of fond piss-taking, but Draco thought they were pretty on the nose with it all. First among equals indeed, he thought; sounded good, but all it really meant was that Harry was out on his own, first into the fray, the one the whole war hinged on, just like he always had been.
Harry is dry-mouthed, slightly queasy from the night before, bones already heavy with the heat of the day, but Malfoy tweaks the sheet off him and pets his hair sympathetically, and tells him it's nothing some bacon and eggs won't fix, and then presses Harry over onto his side and strokes him until he’s hard, and it's almost too hot with Malfoy behind him breathing unevenly into the back of his neck, and Harry can feel the drumming of his pulse in his temples. He’s not sure he'll be able to come at all, sp when he does it's like a lovely surprise, creeping up on him with a slow uncurling heat from nothing but slow lazy thrusts into the circle of Malfoy's fist.
For a moment, he felt a sort of furious helplessness at the self-indulgent irony of having to do the whole stupid thing by hand, but thinking of someone else doing it made him feel even more wretched. He just had to get it over with. His fingers tapped a restless tattoo over the arch of Draco’s right foot while he worked up the courage to touch the too-cold rest of him.
Draco is usually so reserved, is the thing, and Harry loves him like this, with his skin all pink and his eyes closing, helpless under Harry’s touch.
“I hate to be the one to break it to you” —Draco looks positively gleeful— “but I’m literally looking at a walking miracle right now. You absolute twat.”
It should have been ridiculous, Harry thought, and maybe if Draco was there and it was anyone else who had died, Harry would have been able to find it silly. Across the room, the curled edges of the curtain fluttered, then sank quietly back to stillness. The old woman’s cries trembled and rose like a song, then died down to a small gurgle of grief. Her tears were real; Harry could see them sliding unchecked down her face. Beside him, Narcissa had a very white handkerchief held to her mouth, and an almost imperceptible shake in her hand.
, and the witches near Harry are snorting something off the table, powdered Amortentia, it smells like, or maybe it’s just that Harry can still taste Draco on his tongue, and then Draco says something to the big man at the pool table. Harry sees the wolf in him in the way he turns from the game to look at Draco appraisingly before he raises the pool cue and swings for Draco.
“And you’re jealous?” Draco sounds cautious, but his arms tighten around Harry, pulling him closer. Harry thinks he might be getting hard.
goes the hymn, and it’s Ron there, late for the wedding that he wasn’t even supposed to be able to get to, but he’s there anyway, after eight months away, a fresh burn scar just under his left ear, and his hair is longer, and he puts his arms around Harry like he came all the way from Romania just for that, which might actually be the case.
“All the Weasleys are good-looking,” Harry says solemnly, and Draco knows it’s true (and he’s seen how Harry keeps a careful distance from Charlie, not that Draco would mind. Harry is an all-or-nothing type, and Draco’s had all of him for a long time now).
Malfoy would probably love if Hermione moved out, but he just mentions in a mild tone about how hard she’s been working recently, and when Harry lies back to stare at the sky in a temper, Malfoy efficiently unzips Harry’s jeans and eases himself down into the open V of Harry’s legs. They’re quiet about it, because Hermione’s window is the next one over, and she has an early start the next day. Malfoy’s eyes are bright in the sodium streetlight and he looks blissful with his mouth stuffed full, Harry arching up to meet him, and when Harry comes he feels vaporised, like he’s sizzling off into the stars that he can now see behind his screwed-shut eyelids.
“I was trying to speak to him,” Draco corrected absent-mindedly, stirring the contents of the cauldron with the tip of his knife, and then crossly, “You wouldn’t understand.”
“I thought about you and him,” Draco murmurs, close to Harry’s ear, low and confiding. “Sometimes when he looks at you, and he’s so pissed off with you, and you can be so pushy, you know? I wondered how it would work, with you two. He’d try to boss you around, I think, but I don’t know if you’d let him.”
“As long as you’re sure she’ll be working for us. And that there aren’t going to be any fisticuffs with Lizzie the Second over the Crown Jewels.”
The Healer puts Harry on an anti-nausea infusion, and when it finally kicks in he’s so relieved at not feeling sick anymore that he falls asleep, so he misses it when Draco arrives. Harry wakes, confused and muzzy and finally hungry again, to the sound of Draco’s frantic voice and his fingers laced desperately through Harry’s.
When Draco's Owl arrives, Harry is at dinner at the Burrow, but Draco's handwriting is shaky, and there’s what looks like a smudged fingerprint in blood on the parchment, so Harry pushes his plate away, suddenly queasy, and Molly reaches out for him, looking alarmed at whatever she sees in his face.
And speaking of hope; Draco’s Lumos-flicker caught the dry shuffle of red paper poppies across the marble floor. Harry had come back.
“If you insist on talking about it,” Harry said, “how can I stop thinking about it? I’m stuck with it, at least until all of this is over.” He threw a hand out towards the windows, then all the tension quivered into the arch of his back as Draco moved over him, taking Harry inside of himself.
And Harry was in bed, in Draco’s bed in fact—the bed in Draco’s old flat (the weird flat with the bathroom down the hall and the hand-painted flowers on the kitchen cabinet, and the French flatmate who played Muggle guitar and had rigged up a sound system that was part Muggle equipment, part Sonorus Charm). But for once, they were alone in the flat, and Draco had hurried Harry along the windowless corridor to his small room, pushing him with a firm hand at the base of his back, and Harry had just gone with it, half-excited and half-terrified at the thought of finally getting to see Draco naked.
Draco lets him fall silent, because he never makes Harry say these things out loud, and says in his poshest, most carrying voice, “No, this isn’t exactly a
Over breakfast later that day, he had watched Malfoy across the table, feeling slow and stupid and so tired, not really knowing what he was doing. It wasn’t as though he was going to catch a shadow of dream-Malfoy’s smile on real-Malfoy’s face, after all. But as Malfoy reached for the marmalade, Harry saw the fine bones of his hand shifting and the strong straining line of tendon running tense at the base of his thumb, and he had been reminded of dream-Malfoy gripping the long hilt of his sword with intent.
“I needed her to be impressed,” he said. “I needed her to see me as an equal. Or better, even. She’s already a bit of afraid of me, they all are. But I wanted her to believe in me.”
“Do you ever…” Harry shifts slightly so his face is in Draco’s neck and he doesn’t have to look at him. “With Andrew, I mean. Do you ever wish—”
And it worked. They came out, the Muggles, travelling in groups at night, and walking the tunnels of the Underground trains, and some of them in boats slipping unobtrusively upriver—just to join up with Harry. Because all of them watching him on their tvs—his big scarred hands, the proud jut of his chin, the careful tension in his shoulders—had seen him for what he really was, and believed him. They were ready to follow him wherever he would lead; Draco knew it, everyone in London knew it, even Voldemort knew it.
The dreams were always the same that year, and they always took place in Hogwarts, maybe because of the old magic leaching from the walls. Malfoy was always Malfoy in them, or some version of him anyway, and Harry was always Harry, but in the dreams everything else was different.
“I thought,” Draco says breathlessly, “that we could talk about you dressed as a vicar. You know, that long black thing Andrew wears, the one—”
He’d kissed Draco’s mouth, right on the curve of his upper lip, then along to the dimpled crease that deepened when he smiled. But it had felt all wrong, of course, too cold and unmoving, and Harry felt weird for having done it, so he picked up Draco’s hand and kissed that instead. The body had been cleaned up, all the blood Scourgified away with hospital-grade spellwork, so there was only the faint medicinal tang of that from Draco’s skin.
Inside the church is nearly as cold as out, because according to Sylvia, the boiler packed it in last night and no plumber is coming out on a Sunday, not even an emergency guy, not in the middle of a freak March snowstorm.
“There really should be exceptions to the anti-Apparition thing,” Harry grumbled, and then he caught Draco around the waist and dipped his head for a kiss, then another, a curl of the tongue and his hands tightening against the bottom of Draco’s heaving ribcage.
“Blood of my father,” he said, and flicked a meagre drop from the oozing nick on his palm into the potion, gestured impatiently at Harry.
friends, instead of just sitting around in grotty pubs and getting even grottier takeaways on the walk home. Malfoy might like to go to a nice restaurant, Harry thought.
“She was family.” Draco shrugs angrily. “But it wouldn’t matter if I loved her or not. This thing can’t be out in the world. My mother wanted it gone.”
This is the embarrassing bit, Draco thinks, but there isn’t really anything for it, so he says the spell clearly, even the cheesy
“Teddy told me months ago that he thought you were going to ask, but I didn’t think I’d… it’s not something I would have imagined wanting.” Until now, he thinks, with the sight of the little box set against the softer velvet of Harry’s belly. “I don’t have a ring for you though. Would you…” He knows he’s blushing, at just the thought of Harry’s hand—the capable span of his palm, and the crest of the knuckles, and the pale faded remnants of old scars, heartline and lifeline and fateline—and the idea of his own token settled around Harry’s ring finger, something to declare.
“Yeah,” he says. “Yeah, I think so. In a way, it’s been good to come back here. With Betsy, you know, and you. To feel—”
It's still early, he thinks; he can tell from the low light climbing the wall and the quiet heat of their room. Malfoy bites down on his shoulder and comes in a rush of breathlessness over the base of Harry's back and then says, "Mmm. Breakfast?" brightly, like the horrible morning person he is.
“We’re magic, remember?” Harry says smugly, and reaches for his wand before realising he’s left it upstairs. He tries to cast anyway, distracted by the feeling of Draco laughing under him, then gives up and scrambles off Draco so he can get undressed quicker. Draco is down to his underwear already, and Harry lies back next to him, and that’s actually even better, because he can touch Draco properly, all the way down.
“...lion-taming, no it’s really quite safe when you know how to avoid the teeth,” Harry hears as he walks across the room to the buffet table, which is good work from Ginny, especially when paired with all those pretty freckles and her winsome eyes, though the purse-mouthed woman she’s talking to—from Number Seven, if Harry remembers correctly—is moving backwards slowly, looking alarmed.
but he did fight with Draco again, and it was bitter and vicious and awful, and Harry was choking and queasy from Draco’s elbow hard in his stomach, and Draco was spitting blood and swearing at Harry like he hated him as much as he always had. But that time, when their coach found them and asked what was happening, he just narrowed his eyes and said that it was nothing at all, just a misunderstanding, and went back to his broom. Harry had watched him as he went, already feeling bruised.
Harry does remember, but sometimes even in the daytime, even out of the house, he feels them rising in him, each ghost under the skin, in the cords of his larynx, something shifting in the spaces between each beat of his heart.
The dreams began in Eighth Year, and he didn’t have them often—only a handful of times in that whole weird year when they were all back at Hogwarts, but could have been anywhere for all they gave a shit. And Malfoy was there too, taller and quieter but still hateful, expensive-looking and unsmiling and tired; not like he had looked in Sixth Year, when Harry had felt like the world was ending and Malfoy had given up Quidditch, but exhausted in a weirdly grown-up way, like he had seen too much and knew more was coming.
you,” he says, “and you couldn’t keep your eyes off him. I know what you look like when…” and because he doesn’t want to hear any more of this, Draco flips them again, though he can barely keep Harry pinned under him, and Harry’s thumb slips from his mouth in the shift.
“It can’t have been a surprise?” Harry says, and he’s properly laughing now. When Draco answers, his voice is muffled over Harry’s skin.
Hunger drives them out of the bath eventually, and Draco goes to make the tea while Harry gets into his pyjamas even though it’s only about four o’ clock, but it’s almost dark outside and the snow has started up again.
“I can take care of the paperwork,” Draco says faintly. “It would only be a courtesy title anyway, but you don’t want to be saddled with Lord Malfoy, even nominally. I can sort the legal side to keep you—keep
“Do you ever wonder if we might have been friends in a different life?” he asked real-Malfoy at work later that day. He supposed it wasn’t exactly appropriate work conversation, especially since Malfoy had made it clear from the day he started that he would avoid talking to Harry at all costs. But Harry felt looser around Malfoy somehow, now that the dreams were so frequent and so lovely, and he was unreasonably annoyed by real-Malfoy’s uneasy silences. In fact, at that moment, Malfoy was trying to make a cup of tea beside him in the tiny kitchenette while at the same time persistently and ostentatiously pretending that Harry didn’t exist.
“Is this how you want to do it, then?” Draco asks him wonderingly, and Harry starts to get hard at the thought of how breathless he sounds already, and Draco tells him to wait—bossy-sounding, like he gets sometimes, voice hardened up, brittle with desire, and clinical, as though Harry is a problem he wants to solve—and casts the Oleumenti with the borrowed wand.
“Well,” Draco says listlessly when they’re all done, and sitting at a window table in a small, packed bar called Aux Folies, with untouched croissants and coffee in front of them. “We did it.”
“I have to head over to Whitehall in a minute,” Harry said, sounding sad and scooped out. “Hermione will want a rundown, and I need to eat something, I think.”
“We can go to Paris, you know,” Harry tells him. “We can go any time. I bet everyone in France drinks fancy red wine in the bath. We’d fit right in.”
Draco always camped out in the quire though. Close enough to keep an eye on the Muggles, not so close that they'd have to spend their nights keeping a wary eye on him and his wand. They still weren't quite used to him, most of them, but at least they seemed to believe that he was one of the good guys, for whatever that was worth.
“Nearly there, Betsy,” Draco murmurs, eyes flickering to the rearview mirror, and Harry remembers when Draco used to only look at him, before the baby came and having her out in the world felt like a cracked ribcage, a bared heart, something too vulnerable and too unsafe.
Maybe, just maybe, Harry just wanted to fuck Malfoy so badly that his subconscious was trying to make up some nicer versions of Malfoy for him to project onto. And how pathetic was that?
“So, you can call it up any time you want it?” Teddy asks him, and Draco very seriously tells him some of the stories he’s heard himself from his father many times, about all the awful Malfoys through history and their escapades with the wyvern, and even about the time that Lucius had lost his waist-length ponytail to a stray gout of flame and had to wear an elaborate wide-brimmed hat to the Hogwarts Governors’ Gala.
But he did tell Malfoy, quietly in the shelter of their bed that morning. He told him about the mastery of Death, won with Dumbledore’s wand and James’ cloak and Death’s own Resurrection Stone; about slipping through timelines; about how, if he took all the Hallows back, he would have access to all possible universes, and that if he really tried, he could plot a path through the many universes such that he would never die. Quantum immortality, Hermione had called it, when he had first told her about the dreams, back when they had felt like something else he needed to worry about, and when he still hated Malfoy except for when he was being fucked in Malfoy’s big bed (and even then sometimes).
them? But now, they mostly leave me in peace. I’m never frightened there, like I am here.” He ran his open mouth up to Draco’s ear. “Have you ever just wanted to just stop fighting?”
