“Ginny dear, look at the state of him! He’s skin and bones, Harry needs some food—“
Nodding and making reactive noises as appropriate, Harry was staring across the bar as he idly tapped on the edge of his glass and didn’t realise what he was seeing until the panic hit him. Standing abruptly and drawing his wand, he sent all of their drinks flying as he knocked the table in the process. The smashing of glasses was background noise to him as his senses dulled until all he could focus on was the feeling of blood coursing through his veins in a white-hot rage.
The raw truth shone through in Draco’s shout, voice breaking on the final word. Harry looked at the man before him and saw the boy he’d once followed to a second floor bathroom, fear written across his face, chest heaving with shaky breaths that rocked his entire body. Eyes filled with terror affixed to his own. Terror and longing that he felt reflected in his soul.
Clearing his throat Harry looked back to Ron quickly, seeing him raise an eyebrow and tilt his chin towards the doorway she occupied.
“What?” Draco said, feigning innocence. “Can’t a man want reprieve from his children every now and then?”
“Are you saying… You think this wasn’t real?”
“It seems suspicious. Why did Malfoy suggest it?”
It had been several weeks since that night and Draco still wasn’t sure he was ready for this. It took every ounce of courage not to turn on his heels and flee—even with Potter standing beside him—and he cursed himself for being so easily swayed by persuasive green eyes accompanied by poorly-pronounced Latin words.
“I see.” Harry stood watching her expression give nothing away of what was going on beneath that mask. It unnerved him for some reason that he couldn’t quite put his finger on. Giving up, he turned to examine the rest of the room, eyes landing on the grandiose Christmas tree in the far corner. It stretched at least halfway to the ceiling, but what drew Harry’s attention most of all was the sheer number of baubles and lights adorning it. He suspected there was more tinsel than branches. Gorgeous as it was, it had an air of
Ginny was off changing James’ nappy, leaving Harry feeling slightly guilty as he tipped back another glass of Firewhiskey. He ran his fingers through Hermione’s hair where she lay with her head in his lap, feet up on the other arm of the couch.
“No, I mean I don’t feel that way
There was silence for a moment, and he peeked up from underneath the mop of hair that had fallen into his eyes. Ginny was stifling a laugh, and he rolled his eyes before sitting up and glaring at her.
“We’ll need to discuss this alone, if you both don’t mind.” As Hermione went to interject, Healer Benson held her hand out for silence once more before continuing. “I suspect that you may be correct, Miss Granger. Perhaps Harry wasn’t entirely upfront with Nurse Weilin. I also suspect that he’ll be more open to discussion without company.”
Mind turning rapidly, Harry felt his eyes widen. “Wait, they’re doing it this week?”
“Yes, Hermione.” He sighed. “Eating my dinner is a really strenuous activity.”
sorry for the wait (and the mild angst!)
A loud hiccup ripped from Ginny’s throat and she sighed, grabbing Harry’s drink from in front of him and downing it in one go. Wiping a hand across the back of her mouth she waited a moment—ignoring Harry’s indignant protests at having his drink stolen—and then grinned.
“I wasn’t—”
“Not-friends, whatever. I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
large enough for him to see it from his kitchen windows.
“Oh.”
How could one forget
“Were you planning on telling me?”
“Aside from the obvious, if you don’t mind. What do you think is perhaps causing you to take so much of it?”
The words echoed next to him, filling him with a deep comfort. He chose not to mention the hand that had found his as they stood in silence, letting the pain wash away from another memory.
“Don’t be jealous that I’ve got other priorities. It’s hardly a becoming look on you.”
“I can so,” Draco said with a pout. “Fine. You want logic? I’ll give you logic. First of all: you know we’d barely see each other anyway. We’ve both got kids—”
Looking between Harry and the cashier for a long moment, Draco sighed before turning to face the counter again. “One black coffee, and whatever ridiculous Christmas cocoa drink special you’ve got for this idiot.”
“Well then. What do you think the problem with your health is right now?”
Was it possible that—no. Hell would freeze over sooner than Malfoy having genuine interest in him…and it wasn’t like he cared, was it? Sure, the git was nice to look at… Perhaps not that bad to talk to, if everyone else was to be believed. Got under Harry’s skin like nothing else, though whether that was a good thing or not Harry couldn’t be sure. He groaned, head falling into his hands as he leaned on the dark table.
Hermione furrowed her brow, suspicious look crossing her face. “Just how many times has this happened, exactly?”
“Harry.” She paused and he heard the papers in her hand shifting as she fidgeted. “That wasn’t a normal day, even by your standards. I just…”
After hearing the disconnect tone Harry placed the phone back on the receiver. He was worried, that was for sure, but figured he would give it another five minutes before telling anybody that he was worried he was dying. Harry walked over to the sofa across the room and took a seat, hoping to ride it out.
“I thought you said Astoria was fine with this,” Harry said, watching Draco glare in response. “I assume she hasn’t changed her mind?”
Ginny laughed. “Maybe not in as many words. That’s how you sounded though.”
“I’m only saying that if it weren’t for him, Fred wouldn’t be—”
Laughing at her indignant tone, Harry rolled his eyes. “You wouldn’t have had the chance if I’d made the tea.”
They made their way back out of the kitchen, Harry pausing briefly in the doorway in an attempt to wave goodbye to Teddy and Andromeda. He realised the mistake as soon as he locked eyes with Draco and saw something akin to panic crossing the blonde’s face.
He pulled her in close and kissed her forehead, mumbling a
That’s probably why he felt blindsided by her intuitive perception as he relaxed in front of the fire, sipping on mulled wine while waiting for Hermione’s return from the bathroom.
“Er, Pansy?”
“So, that’s it? You’re letting him go?”
Harry’s head came down to rest in his hands, a heavy sigh blowing his napkin across the table. “You’re right. I’m sorry.”
Certain that his racing heart could be heard all the way in Hogsmeade at this point, Draco focused on slowing his breathing as he tried not to get ahead of himself. “What is it about then?”
She ushered them both out of the room promptly before anything more could be said on the matter, ignoring all of Hermione’s protests and Ron’s face as he tried to send Harry what was likely meant to be a reassuring look but instead looked like he was about to vomit slugs again. Drawing her wand, Healer Benson tapped on the door a few times to ensure it remained closed before turning back to face Harry.
“I’ll leave you in Chelsea’s capable hands,” Harry said as he tilted his head towards the mess he’d left up the back of the shop. “Best be getting back to it.”
Despite the fact that Draco had been the one to broach the topic, it was clear that he was feeling in over his head right now. Knowing better than to preemptively reassure him, Harry counted slowly to ten in his head.
“Yes, well. I didn’t plan to cross paths with you. I’m only here to see Andromeda and Teddy before we head to see Astoria’s family.”
“I’m looking for an owl, actually.”
with him.”
It had been a beautiful moment, shattered by Nick shouting as he fell to the ground. Teddy stood above him, looking as if he may have been responsible for pushing him.
He shrugged. “Hardly. They make good products, Teddy loves them, it’s conveniently closer to visit and Diagon doesn’t hold half as many memories as Hogsmeade.”
“Er, no.” He shook his head as she gave an amused smile. “I don’t.”
Harry groaned. “Honestly, it’s nothing. And I’m sure it’s nothing to do with that. Can we just forget it?”
“Those fancy pureblood crackers? Gosh, I haven’t seen one of those in—how many years is it since we were engaged, Mol?”
“I’ve continued to come here every night because I can’t go past that first stair.
It was harmless, really, to start asking leading questions to Dean and Seamus over dinner the next week about who they’d each received as gifts. Nobody wanted to tell of course—such was the nature of “Secret” Santa, apparently—but after Harry had plied each of them with a few more rounds of ale they had started to loosen up. He had strongly considered point blank asking Malfoy who he had and what his game was, but the look on both Ron and Hermione’s face every time he’d mentioned the prat in the past week were enough to dissuade him from their bad graces at the very least. So it stood to reason that he could simply ask everyone else who they had, cross them off the list he kept in his pocket at all times and see who was left.

“I’ll be at the Ministry until 3 o’clock. Meet me in the Atrium, don’t be late.”
apologies if there's any inconsistency and typos through the next few chapters - i got my wisdom teeth out a few days ago and my final edits have been done from bed in a rather delirious state!
Trying not to draw too many parallels, Harry gave a tentative smile. “It’s good to see you.”
Calling out for Molly, Ginny disappeared around the doorway and Harry slumped back against the wall, groaning as he let his eyes fall closed. When it came to Malfoy, why did everything have to be so difficult?
Molly’s grumbles could be heard as she walked off, apparently unwilling to let Harry spend too much time in her home without a plate in his hand. Eyes flicking back to Ginny as Molly disappeared from view, Harry raised his eyebrows expectantly.
He looked forward at her and was glad to see that at least for now, there were no tears in her eyes.
They laughed, eyes meeting in a curious appreciation as Harry gestured for Draco to speak.
It happened again a few days later, when Harry was on the phone with the Indian takeout place down the street. He stopped mid sentence and clenched his eyes closed, trying not to keel over.
sorrrryyyyyyy i promise i will make up for the angsty times! gotta throw some ✨emotions✨ at the boys for character development, right?
“France was only ever temporary.”
Harry hated pacing. He hated watching it happen, hated hearing it happen and most of all, hated doing it himself. But he couldn’t sit still for longer than a few seconds before his temper got the best of him, so it was best to pace right now.
.” Draco said, before glancing at the stairs leading up to the tower. He shrugged. “Your pain is my pain. It’s a Pureblood thing.”
Harry had no idea how she did it.
“I thought… I thought I saw…”
His thoughts wandered back to earlier that week when he hadn’t known if he would make it out of there alive. The Dementor’s kiss was outlawed, sure, but that didn’t inspire any feelings of ease in Draco. He knew better than to assume anything after all he had lived through. The thought of falling victim to their kiss was horrible, but worse than even that was the stares he had gotten upon arrival at the ministry. Some looks were scathing, filled with hatred and anger, but the ones that haunted Draco the most were the eyes that seemed to pity him. As if they knew how much he hadn’t wanted to be involved in everything surrounding him, the decisions he never got to make. He hated those stares. They knew nothing of his situation, no matter what they might have heard. No doubt they’d heard the words of one of the people who had testified to keep him out of Azkaban. He wanted to feel grateful and he was sure if he listened closely enough, a hidden part of him was appreciative.
“Er, no.” Meeting her eyes, he gave her an apologetic smile as she rolled her eyes in response. “Sorry, Gin.”
“Perhaps it’s time we called each other by our names.” Harry caught Malfoy’s eye as his head swivelled to look back at where he sat on the couch, something that felt like both a challenge and an invitation passing between them. “Draco.”
Harry’s head snapped around to look at the where Draco stood at the top of the carpeted staircase on the opposite side of the room.
Ron shrugged at him, shifting from side to side before clearing his throat. “Maybe it’s not a bad idea, mate. I didn’t realise you were, um. Y’know. The Wideye stuff.” He looked down at the floor before mumbling, almost to himself. “Mum says that’s dangerous.”
Pursing her lips, Healer Benson nodded her acknowledgement. “Yes, Miss Granger.”
“Must’ve rigged it, mate!”
“Perhaps stupid isn’t the correct word in this instance.” She smiled at him, the kind of smile that gave the impression that her friendly nature could become something darker in a heartbeat if you wronged her. “Though I did warn him that you were likely to come barging in. I expected the front door, if we’re being perfectly candid.”
“Can I ask something?” Harry interrupted, regretting it almost as soon as the words left his mouth.
Sitting shakily, he took in the scene around him and grimaced. “Sorry about the drinks. I’ll get more, shall I?”
“Just, don’t.” He turned away from Harry, but not before he caught sight of the tears in his eyes. “I’ll owl you, okay?”
They were both too caught up in one another to spot the snowballs flying at them before it was too late. To his credit, Draco recovered pretty well from the shock—perhaps because he had only been hit in the leg, where Harry got a face full of snow that had him brushing off his glasses for a few moments—immediately turning to the offending children with a stern face.
“You should know that!” Came the answering shout from the kitchen.
Harry’d told the kids when they came home for the summer, knowing that Draco was doing the same with Scorpius once the divorce was public knowledge. The media had run with the story as far as they could, which in truth wasn’t particularly far; the Malfoy family’s fall from grace was becoming but a distant past, the future that Draco had so meticulously tried to forge for them holding more weight with every passing year. He and Harry weren’t yet official to anyone outside of their closest friends and family, intending to keep it that way until they had both settled into their relationship and its place in their lives.
“Um, yeah. Do you know anything about chest pain?”
“Alright, Mister Potter. I’ll go get the Healer on duty and be back shortly.”
Harry shook his head slowly, keeping his eyes trained on Draco. “I’m not trying to save you.”
“Please.” It was the raw emotion behind that cracked syllable that had Harry pausing in his tirade, waiting expectantly for more. “I can’t do this. Being friends was never a good idea.”
Nodding, Malfoy looked almost uncomfortable. “I’d been thinking about it for a while. Mother was the one to convince me in the end.”
Withdrawing from the kiss, Harry sighed. “I need more than just I miss you, Draco. I need to know that the next time something doesn’t go your way, you’re not going to walk away and then never speak to me again.” Watching Draco’s discomfort as he reclined against the desk once more, Harry shook his head. “I won’t wait around for you again.”
“I know that, Ronald. The point I’m making is that it’s been almost a decade. People change, and just because Harry clearly hasn’t changed much since school doesn’t mean that everyone else has been stuck in their ways.”
“An actual apology from Harry Potter himself? I thought the day would never come.”
“Yeah, that Lee Jordan,” Harry said as he shared a look with Seamus. “Let me know if he’s bought anything here before this idiot doubles up on presents.”
“Sure thing, Mister Potter!”
“Any idea what you’re going to name her, then?” Harry asked.
“Er, yeah. I should probably get going.” He turned, catching the puzzled expression on Andromeda’s face as he did so. “Is this…What does this mean?”
After a few minutes of staring aimlessly at the table he realised that there wasn’t much point to going back to the office in his state. He needed to clear his head. No, what he really needed was to sit down with Ginny, like he should have many years ago.
“Yes, well the office keeps talking about how good this place is and I thought I should try it myself. What are you doing here?”
Blushing, Harry looked down at his hands. “You’re quite distracting.”
The stag was barely five feet tall but it was enough to almost have Harry in tears, though with appreciation or the slight pangs of loss he still felt from time to time he couldn’t say. When he heard Teddy’s yell he broke out into a grin, spinning to watch the teen careen over to him as fast as his legs would carry him.
“State your full name,” Shacklebolt said, barely heard over the loud gasps and mutters that had broken out around the chambers.
“Just promise me one thing, okay? If you’re going to do this now… don’t settle for vague answers and distant promises. You’re lucky I’m much happier as we are, or I’d be pretty pissed this is the guy you ended our marriage over.”
He watched her shoulders shaking with laughter as she turned and made her way back to the kitchen. Then he turned back to face Draco, watching the man raise an anticipatory brow as he waited for Harry to speak first.
“No, not like that. I mean I know you love her, but do you…" A crease appeared in between her brows as she thought, sitting up slightly to sip on her wine. Her voice was barely more than a whisper when she spoke again. "Does it actually feel like more than just loving one of the Weasleys? Or me?”
“I feel like I should apologise for that, though it wasn’t me who started it.”
his stupid, moody, pointy face makes you want to kiss him.”
“Mate, are you alright?”
Leaning back slightly to brush a hand through his hair again, Harry threw Draco that slightly crooked grin and he knew then, with more certainty than ever before, that he was hopelessly and irreversibly lost on Harry Potter.
“So, Draco.” Harry began uncertainly. “How have you been?”
“What did she tell you?”
“I’m not saying that you don’t,” Ginny said. “But are you sure you want to do it like this?”
“Sure, Malfoy. Really seemed like you were doing just fine on your own.” Harry winced at the nasty tone that came out of his mouth, a habit built after so many years of rivalry. He grimaced, shaking his head. “Sorry. I didn’t really mean to come in like that but I heard him from the street…”
—and you come here accusing me of trying to avoid you?”
“Thanks, Chelsea. That’ll be enough won’t it, Seamus?”
Pansy barked a short, vicious laugh. “You’re about to feel a whole lot worse. What did you say to Draco last night?”
“I’ve only really got happy thoughts about Quidditch, y’know? And that’s kinda what we’re doing. Cancelling out the bad stuff and making it happy again.”
“But he does!” John yelled, wand sparking towards the floor even as Harry tightened the grip on his arm.
“Oh,” Harry said. Sitting silently and listening to the clink of knives and forks against plates, he wondered what the Malfoys were doing. If Draco knew that their sons were best friends. If Draco was thinking about him.
“Do you ever wonder how Molly and Arthur coped? I love James, but I can’t imagine you raising seven of him.”
“But what if—”
chapter inspired by
“Hard to respond when they stop coming.”
“I said I was sorry!”
The old elf stopped muttering at Harry’s raised voice and with a frustrated exhale, Harry sat upright again.
“I’m not sure. I just don’t know if this is what we both had in mind. I’m happy, I do love her, I just… Sorry, I’m rambling.”
Stepping out into the crisp night air, Harry squinted as his eyes tried to adjust to the outside world. The cloud cover coupled with one too many drinks had Harry feeling a bit hazy as he stumbled and he blamed the lack of vision for how high he jumped when a voice spoke out of the darkness to his right.
“Are you even listening to me?”
“I honestly don’t know why I bother,” she muttered as she turned on her heels and stalked off towards the apparition point outside the hospital.
“Oh.” Harry was quiet for a moment, thinking back to his Ministry days. “I didn’t realise it was so bad. It was in the Aurors, obviously, but surely that’s different?”
“That’s not—”
The Healer tutted at what she saw, slight twists of her wrist pulling at individual threads so she could inspect them. Blue seemed to be the most prevalent colour—also the least concerning, from what he could tell of her responses—yet it was the twisted mass of gold near his stomach that captivated his attention. It shone bright but somehow managed to seem unwelcoming and dark, feelings that Harry had never before associated with the colour. So focused on the tangled threads, Harry missed the Healer’s question at first and only realised he was being addressed when the colours disappeared.
Harry saw the fear, the panic in Draco’s eyes. The words he wasn’t saying. “You don’t have to do this.”
“Ron didn’t mention the dragons when I was last in, that’s all.”
Harry glared as he picked up the steaming mug before him. “What does that even mean?”
“How charitable,” Draco muttered.
next chapter will be up in a few hours x
Ginny reached out and patted his forearm gently. “I’m not saying you’re stupid. You’re quite clever when you actually pay attention to the right things. Just… Give him a chance, maybe. He’s not as bad as he used to be.”
“‘Mione, that’s gross!”
“I thought you said it wasn’t a big deal?” Confused, Harry looked to his friends to see if they were making more sense of this than he was.
“Draco…” He breathed. “You got me this?”
“You’re a confusing woman, Gin.”
Tipping back half of his coffee in one mouthful, Draco placed the mug between them and leaned back in his chair once more with a nonchalant yet genuine smile. “If you insist.”
“You mean the colours?” At Harry’s hesitant nod, Arthur launched into explanation mode, complete with exaggerated hand gestures and frantic eye movements. “Well, they were charmed by one of the older wizarding families back when arranged marriages were common among all magic folk. Mol and I are among the last generation to have used them. The colours showed how good a partnership the witch and wizard would be, with red being a warning and green being the best match. If I remember correctly, it was charmed so that the witch would always get the larger side of the cracker when it broke.”
“Er,” Harry began uncomfortably, realising that all of the children surrounding him were staring. “Did Scorpius tell you that?”
As timed passed, the tempo slowed. The pranks became tamer, the hexes not even mildly painful. By the time Christmas rolled around they were faking reactions for passersby as spells missed them entirely. The words they slung at each other didn’t hit the same, followed by smirks and the occasional outright grin. So tangled up in this routine, the holiday departure of their friends along with most of the castle was almost welcome.
article for them. Maybe Harry ought to write and see how he was coping. At the very least, it was appropriate to send congratulations when a child was born. He and Ginny had received more letters than they’d known what to do with when James’ birth had been announced and though he hoped otherwise, Harry assumed it would be the same when they welcomed their next child. Nodding to himself while he made his way to the desk in their bedroom, Harry talked himself out of finding a gift to go with the letter and opened the bottom left drawer as he took a seat.
Meekly, Harry returned the shrug. “I didn’t know until today. But yeah, er… Would you mind not telling her?”
“Do you ever think about having him bring Scorpius over? He is the same age as Al, after all.”
“I believe you’ll find I have faced the consequences.”
“Honestly, I’m not sure if we’re good at this marriage thing. Hermione keeps saying she thinks we’re too good at it, would you believe?”
Careful not to wake anyone as he searched the creaking kitchen cupboards for owl treats, he gave the excited bundle of feathers something to quieten her down and watched her do a lap of the kitchen before catapulting herself back into the cold air. Shaking his head with a fond smile, he closed the window and looked down at the scroll she had left by the sink.
“Understandable,” Harry said with a nod. “I know this means you won’t be in town much, but maybe when you are…”
hello most of these chapters are being posted at 6am immediately after writing them in the early hours with very little editing done .... so i shall be going back to edit this story properly in january!
“Excuse me, Healer Benson, could I have a word with you first?”
Draco continued on as if he hadn’t heard him. “And you barely looked at me in September.”
“Oh.” Stomach feeling slightly sick at that—probably the whipped cream, he reasoned—Harry gave a grimace in return. “Glad I caught you before you left then.”
“Do you know how long I’ve been waiting to do this?”
Shaking his head, Draco reminded himself that the heat he was feeling was imagined. The Fiendfyre had ravaged the room but it was long gone, only memories leaving the whisper on his skin.
With a start, Harry turned slightly to see the expectant on Malfoy’s face. “Unexpected.”
“So, your love letters aren’t working then? He hasn’t replied?”
“Harry, can we talk?”
Harry took the proffered potion and threw it back in one gulp, grimacing slightly at the bitter aftertaste. He clenched his eyelids shut tight as he waited for the jolt of energy to hit, ever aware of how loud his breathing was in the silence around them. Having taken Wideye more often than not this past month, Harry knew almost to the second how long it took to come into effect and the fingers on his wand hand tapped impatiently as he counted down the moments.
(See the end of the chapter for
Working his fingers back into the knots of Harry’s shoulders, Draco continued softly. “You said you didn’t mind if we never got married. That you’d understand if it would be too much attention for scorpius, because even after all my years of stupidity—”
“Mm,” Malfoy said as he took another sip. Placing the glass down on the table between them, he tilted his head as he looked at Harry, searching his face for something. “So, Potter. Care to explain what was so urgently in need of discussion that you had to owl me about it in the middle of the night?”
“Tell me, Mister Potter—”
He shook his head, then brushed a hand through his hair as he looked up at her once more. “I’ll feel shit either way. Malfoy goes to Azkaban, my fault. Malfoy walks free, my fault.”
It was Teddy’s shout that had them rapidly pulling away from one another, heads darting around to see the boys exit back onto the street and scan the vicinity for them. Harry stood, Draco doing the same beside him as he brushed some of the snow off his jeans before clearing his throat and calling out to the boys.
Harry cleared his throat, glowering at both of the boys. “That’s enough, both of you. Draco did make some bad choices, but that doesn’t make him a bad person. We all make bad choices.”

“—filthy Death Eater like you, thinking you can come in here without consequence?”
Which was how he found himself here, Ginny dressed to the nines by his side and teasing him for being too distracted by a certain blonde to focus on anything else.
“Would you care for some tea, Mister Potter?”
“We could just alternate meeting Teddy at the station if we make a mess of it,” Draco suggested.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am.”
“I remember the one.”
“You’re all hearing things wrong,” Harry grumbled. “Besides, it doesn’t matter, does it?”
“What’s going on, Harry?”
Her bluntness was what stopped the lie on Harry’s lips. Faltering, he instead looked down at his hands where they rested in his lap and took a deep breath. “I’m not sure. I didn’t feel the magic happening.”
, supplied the unhelpful voice in his head.
Looking back and forth between Malfoy’s face and the bird—Hestia, he corrected—Harry could do nothing but shrug. “I… guess so?”
“It was noon two hours ago.” Her tone was sharp enough to cut glass, causing Harry to gulp nervously.
“Could you, y’know…” He gestured to the robes hanging over his left shoulder with a meek smile.
“You know what your lot did to my sister? It’s not right that you get to waltz around here, scum like you, while she’s gone. I ought to have your head for that, boy.”
Breaking down your walls
She raised her eyebrows but simply returned the nod, Ron beside her looking back and forth between them like they were a particular interesting Quidditch match. He couldn’t blame him; if their roles were reversed he’d be equally as confused and curious. Harry just wasn’t about to admit to either of them that he’d apparently started hallucinating.
“I don’t really understand,” Harry said, twisting his hands into the sheets beneath him as he felt his throat start to close up. Was this a side effect of the colourful spell?
“At Luna’s last week?” Hermione asked. “Or at the Ministry the week before that?”
Harry sighed, wishing for the millionth time this week that the press would find something more interesting to think about. “I don’t think me telling them I like men is going to help.”
Determined to put on a brave face for both of them, Harry stepped forward and embraced Molly, eyes locking with Ron’s over her shoulder; he gave a thumbs up and grin of encouragement. Hermione stood beside him, looking behind Harry where he presumed his boyfriend was still standing. Heartbeat seeming to echo in the silence around them, Harry stepped back with his hands still on Molly’s shoulders, encouraging smile on his face as he watched her eyes flit between him and Draco behind him. He held his breath almost on instinct, despite knowing—hoping—that his family would accept Draco in all the ways he needed them to.
“I won’t be writing you up for any Dreamless Sleep, if that’s what you’re hoping.”
Hermione turned her fierce gaze to Harry momentarily at that as she realised he had asked to be released rather than stay for observation. He watched her throat move as she swallowed and cowered slightly, knowing he was in for some aggressive opinions when they made it back to Grimmauld.
Running a hand through his hair, Harry let out a shaky laugh. “Yeah, alright. It’s a good plan. I’m already set up in the spare room anyway.”
“What do you mean?”
Running both hands through his hair this time he tilted his chin back to look up at the sky above them. Cloudy, of course. He hadn’t expected to end up here. Not tonight. Not like this. What happened to not having to make any big decisions tonight?
“Then you have to—”
Arthur laughed, shaking his head as he looked back to Harry. “Point being, it’s been many decades. I don’t even know if they exist anymore, to tell you the truth. Who’ve you been swapping stories with, hey?”
Looking between the two of them, Harry sighed, signalling to the nearby waiter to swap out his glass. This was almost more exhausting than navigating the minefield that was Draco Malfoy, and considering the trials and tribulations Harry had faced in his life, that was saying something.
“It’s not funny, Gin!”
She closed the door behind her and Harry looked down at James in his arms. He’d already grown so much in the four months since they brought him home and though he was definitely sleeping better these days, Harry still didn’t envy Ginny the time she spent settling him while Harry was at work through the weeks.
“Er…” Harry wasn’t entirely sure how to respond. She was too perceptive for her own good, that much was certain, but she didn’t seem angry or even surprised. “You do?”
Astoria laughed softly before murmuring, too low for Draco’s ears. “Oh, you really are as oblivious as he says.”
“Harry…” She leaned back, eyes trained on the flickering of the fire as she thought for a moment. “There’s a big difference between you having nothing as a child and Draco having nothing now. You didn’t know any different then. He has only ever known different. He’s had expectations on him since he was born, and I know you did too, but he knew about them his entire life. You had no idea before Hagrid showed up.”
“Draco—”
Harry continued to splutter as Andromeda chuckled to his right, patting him gently on the shoulder before wandering the other way to the kitchen.
There was a scraping of chair against floor as George stood abruptly, mouth pressed into a thin line. Harry watched as the man’s eyes flickered around the table seeming to look at them all without actually seeing any of them, before George quickly walked out into the backyard and left an echoing silence behind.
He groaned, shooting a quick look across the room to see if the kids were paying attention. Absorbed in their own world as always, he breathed a sigh of relief. “Close call, but I think we’re in the clear.”
“I am no stranger to the effects of certain stimulants, Miss Granger. Even the most basic vital spells have shown that Harry has taken multiple in excess as of late. That being said, my concern lies more in the motive behind his actions than the damage he has done at this stage.”
“Here?” Draco questioned. At Harry’s nod, he began to count on his fingers. “There was the time you broke your arm and then lost all your bones. Oh! How could you forget Weasel—Weasley, sorry—vomiting slugs? Or the time that—”
“Spending a decade in denial will do that to you.” Laughing, she shook her head at him fondly. “Probably longer if we’re being perfectly honest.”
“You’ll never guess who I saw at work this morning,” she called from the hallway.
“I’m here to tell you that stubborn as my husband may be, I’m glad you seem to be equally so. He’s a fool, and even more foolish to try denying how taken he is with you, but Merlin, he needs you. There’s a lot he will probably have to work through before he can admit to that, and there’s only so many times I can repeat myself before we both end up in Janus Thickey.” Astoria laughed nervously, shaking her head before letting out a sigh. “Those years with you were the happiest I’ve ever seen Draco. I don’t know if you’ll get much from him before Scorpius makes it to Hogwarts, but losing his mother changed Draco. It’s hard to explain, but I think he may almost accept what you’ve been trying to tell him these past years.”
“Oh.” Harry looked down at his feet, feeling strange thinking about the older Malfoys even this long after the war.
“Yeah,” came the answering murmur, Draco’s voice shaking as he turned bright eyes on Harry. “They are.”
“Come on then, I think you’ve had quite enough time in the snow for one evening. Let’s get you both home to Andromeda.”
“No more than usual.”
“Voldemort killed me in the Forbidden Forest.”
“James has fallen in love with our neighbour’s cat,” he said as he picked up the cocoa topped with an excessive number of marshmallows. “I’m scared he will steal it if I don’t intervene.”
Malfoy sighed. “She puts up an awful fuss if I make her stay home, that much is for sure.”
’s article speculating about who Harry’s new girlfriend could possibly be. Apparently an inside source had all the juicy details and it was all anyone could talk about. Leaving the house was something he let other people do these days, for fear of being perceived by anyone who believed this rubbish.
“Sorry?” Harry asked as he turned to take in the woman standing before him.
Ah, yes. The eternal Draco-shaped dilemma. He groaned, cursing the man his mind couldn’t let go.
“Don’t make excuses. Please. I waited around for you for years and then again when you left last year and I can’t do it again. Not if you don’t really want this.”
“Yeah,” he said after a long pause. “I won’t be able to sleep until I know what’s happening, Gin.”
“Weasley’s, actually.”
Cursing his awkward offer, Harry shifted from side to side as Malfoy stared at him like he’d gone mad. Perhaps he had. That would certainly be a better explanation than anything else his brain could come up with for his sudden want to assist Draco sodding Malfoy as he shopped for an owl. Looking down at his feet to spare himself the humiliation of being looked at as if he had grown an extra head, Harry was taken aback to hear a quiet
She looked back to him and nodded curtly. “Yeah, it seems that way.”
Harry waited until their friends had left to turn back to Draco, heart rate speeding up at the sight of him; stunned as Harry was, with flushed cheeks and red, plumped lips from their earlier exchange. Smiling, Harry leaned closer and pressed a quick chaste kiss on the blonde’s lips.
“Er, morning Hermione.”
“Already planning for the worst?” Harry teased.
Did he owe this crisis of moral conscience to the Dark Lord? If the fear hadn’t followed him around his own home for so long, would he have ever questioned his allegiance and what they were all fighting for? Considering the amount of time and energy he devoted to hiding his thoughts from someone he had followed so easily at one time, had he been questioning the plans all along? Had he ever truly stood for anything? Or had his father and in turn the Dark Lord just scared the shit out of him?
Not buying it, Hermione raised her hands in despair. “They’re addictive, Harry! And lethal if there’s too much in your system. You’ll have to take more and more to get the same effect so eventually your body will simply shut down.”
“Whatever you want to call it then.” Tilting her head, Ginny’s gaze looked to be quite transfixed on something across the room. She dropped her voice to barely above a whisper. “Astoria’s quite pretty up close, isn’t she? I mean, she’s stunning from a distance, but I didn’t realise—”
A sensation not unlike the feeling of Wideye coursing through his veins came over him and he blinked rapidly for a few moments, taking in the panicked looks on his friends’ faces and the contemplative focus of Healer Benson as she held her wand in his direction. They were the only ones in the room.
“Nothing,” came the too-quick response from Draco.
“Quite the oversimplification,” Draco said even as he conceded Harry’s point with a nod. “But go on.”
“—and it’s one of the things that I love about you most.” A fond sigh sounded, Draco shifting slightly behind him as he removed the hand on one of Harry’s shoulders. “You’re always trying to do the right thing, trying to see the best in others. Even me. Especially me, though Merlin knows sometimes I don’t—”
“Unless congratulations are in order?” Draco’s expression was unreadable, head tilted as he held Harry’s steady gaze. “Andromeda mentioned that you and Ginevra were still living together.”
Your own personal saviour
“No, because you were fighting for the right bloody thing.” Draco’s head snapped up, chin jutting out defiantly at whatever he saw in Harry’s expression. “For Merlin’s sake. Stop doing this.”
“Harry,” she said in a low tone, placing the glass on the counter in front of him. “Will you be okay walking past him?”

“That did the trick! Alright, I’m heading off with Luna now. If you need to have a Malfoy crisis, I’ll be home tomorrow. Actually, you'll see me for Christmas in a few days, you can wait. Don’t floo tonight please, you’re unbearable when you floo me drunk.”
“Dating?”
Making his way outside behind her, the cool air bit at his arms as he pulled his shirt sleeves back down as low as they would go over his hands, rubbing them together to generate a bit of heat without bothering to reach for his wand. The sun had set during his chat with Ron and not expecting to be outside, he had dressed lightly: a thin long-sleeved shirt and a worn pair of Dudley’s old jeans. Ginny was bundled up ahead of him, as to be expected after spending the day out flying. She didn’t seem to still be in her flying gear but she looked warm, which he was grateful for. As confusing as the situation might be, he’d hate to have a conversation that he’d been dreading while also worrying about her health.
Hearing the pain, anger and need for approval that went unsaid, Draco started to reach a hand towards Harry’s shoulder before thinking better of it, wary that it might be too much. “
Healer Benson gave a soft laugh. “Yes, well. People with far more power and influence than me make the decisions, I’m afraid. That being said, it’s a start. I daresay it’d do Harry some good.”
Malfoy shot him a glare and Harry expected to be chewed out for asking, or more probable, ignored. It surprised him when Malfoy instead gave him an honest answer.
, for starters. And the
“I don’t want to get back together, you idiot.” She rolled her eyes and his shoulders dropped with a sigh of relief. “I just mean living together with the kids. I don’t plan to start seeing anyone else yet, I want to focus on raising our children and you have to admit that we work well together. As friends,” she added as Harry opened his mouth again. “What if we just co-parented as housemates for a while? Then neither of us has to try find a new place, and when it does finalise there will be less fallout in the papers if they see we’re amicable.”
“You know you can—never mind,” Malfoy said suddenly, turning away from the curtains. “So, how about that drink then?”
She kept her voice low, casting her eyes around for eavesdroppers before she spoke. “You heard Arthur, it’s just a story.”
Maybe it served him right for making fun of Ron’s irritation, maybe the universe simply wanted to rub some salt in his wounds. Either way, Harry had definitely not been expecting Ron of all people to ask him if he’d heard from Malfoy lately. Furthermore, when he said no he hadn’t anticipated to then be handed the Prophet and told to flip to page five.
at the thought of setting foot in the bright, clinical building but seeing the desperation in Hermione’s eyes, he paused. Thinking it over as he took a long sip from his Butterbeer, Harry had to acknowledge that without his daily vice he wouldn’t last much longer without sleeping.
Harry pondered that for a moment, understanding where Narcissa was coming from. “Why don’t you just leave too? Surely the memories haunt you as well?”
and Harry gulped before taking a nervous step backwards, noticing Ron do the same beside him.
“No, why? Everything alright with you two?”
“Er, I suppose so?”
(please note that this is where my epilogue compliance ends, i am not killing off astoria, my girl deserves a better ending than that)
“You don’t?” At the shake of his head, Ginny pondered for a moment. “Trap him under the mistletoe?”
and it took every ounce of control Harry had not to burst into hysterical laughter.
It was endearing, and enough to make Harry’s breath catch in his throat. Maybe they could navigate the pain, if Draco could get it through his head just how much this was his final chance. “I’m not sure you get it, Draco. When you told me to sort things out with Ginny all those years ago… You were right. I was running from my problems.” Shaking his head as he thought to the men they’d been back then, Harry sighed. “I thought I needed to be better for you, but I know now that I actually needed to be better for myself. All those years, I wanted a version of you that I thought was doing the same, because surely if you were the reason I could do it, you could too, right?”
"I suspected as much." She studied his face for a few moments, eyes crinkling at the corner at whatever she found there. “I’m starting to think you should just wait for him to owl then.”
i've chopped and changed it so many times now, but i feel like this is exactly how i need this to be to actually feel comfortable moving forward with the drarry pairing bc we gotta make these boys confront & admit to their own faults for anything to be healthy, right?
“I know.”
,” he said, emphasising the last words.
“Didn’t what?”
buckle up, it's a bit of a chunky chapter!
Feeling sheepish, Harry grimaced. “Sorry. I was out of line.”
In your heart, your fantasies
“Well I’m eight months pregnant, and I know you’re not about to start dating any time soon.”
He’s The Boy Who Lived
i'm about a week behind on posting (thanks life!) but will catch up soon 😅
“I’m not the one who—”
At Draco’s nod, he grinned. “Alright, one…two…”
“Yes, well. I felt like doing something with my hands.”
“You can’t promise that.”
“Maybe I’m just lonely. You could be on to something about this just being my stupid Malfoy obsession all over again. I am quite bored without the Aurors; there’s only so many times I can reread
Taking another quick glance at the battered watch on his wrist, Harry sighed and cursed whoever was listening that he’d crossed paths with Malfoy today and even worse, that he was going to defend the blasted prat. Stepping through the doorway he caught sight of the raised voice immediately: a large man with a face that reminded Harry of Vernon Dursley and a bald patch the size of one of the rats in the glass casing next to him. He was red in the face to match what hair he had left and more importantly, had his wand raised in the face of the pointy git standing opposite him.
“What can I get you gentlemen?”
it's all uphill from here!
She arched a brow but said nothing, looking behind Harry’s shoulder and then back to him. “I’m not stupid, Harry.”
Your past rears its ugly head
There was a soft smile on Malfoy’s face for all of two seconds before he seemed to remember who he was keeping company with; Harry filed it away for future consideration and tried not to slip up with a responding smile of his own.
The words were out before Harry’d had a chance to think them through; he meant not to imply that the Manor was unsafe but more that perhaps Hestia wouldn’t enjoy being alone there. Unfortunately the damage had been done. Malfoy’s face closed off from the unguarded expressions he’d been sharing for a few minutes and instead came the return of a scowl Harry knew better than he sometimes thought he knew himself.
Stepping into the doorway and leaning against the frame, Hermione tilted her head towards him. “I’ll give you a hint. He had the same loved up expression on his face as you right now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Letting out a shocked burst of laughter, Harry saw the boys turn back to look at them. Shaking his head and giving them a thumbs up as he continued to chuckle, he glanced sideways to see Draco looking thoroughly pleased with himself. “Muggles, actually.”
“Did he say why he couldn’t make it?” Harry’s tone was trying to be disinterested, casually curious, but the look Andromeda sent over her shoulder had his cheeks flushing at being caught out. The hint of pity that coloured it also confirmed his suspicions that it had something to do with him and he bit back a grimace as Teddy shrugged beside him.
“Harry…” She paused, leaning against the counter with a sigh. “We lived through a war. A fucking horrible war that scarred us both. And like it or not, that’s made it even more necessary for Malfoy to get married and do what his parents want. I think—I think it’s even part of why we stayed together.”
Harry heard the overly nonchalant tone his voice took, saw the tells he wouldn’t have noticed a few years earlier. It filled him with hope but also scared him to death. “We’re good… I think.”
His few minutes of pondering seemed to be all the time Hermione had needed to pause her research long enough to come and yell at him. Harry managed to convince her not to drag him to St. Mungo’s then and there but he should have known better than to think he’d left the conversation with the upper hand.

“Believe me Harry, if there were any alternatives, I would. For now, I’m going back to researching muggle methods of dealing with trauma.”
Seamus laughed. “Probably, but hey. Not my problem, mate.”
Healer Benson let out a sigh coupled with an almost-fond smile. “Like I said, I can’t keep you. But Harry, I must stress the importance of coming back if this happens again. If you experience outbursts of magical energy like before or anything else out of the ordinary, you should come and see us at once.”
Shrugging, Harry turned to Seamus. “Fair’s fair.”
“I did!” Albus said indignantly. “I told you I made a friend, remember?”
“It’s nothing, just…” Locking eyes with Hermione now, he nodded in defeat. “St Mungo’s, then?”

19 years later is up tomorrrowwww! 👀 who's excited?
“Bit late for that,” James said as he rolled his eyes at Harry. “Soon as Al knew he practically screamed it at us.”
Sighing, Potter shook his head. “I’m not here to duel, Malfoy.”
Draco snorted, finally meeting Harry’s eyes as he shook his head. “Not yet. I mean one day in the future. They’ll attend Hogwarts, of course, and the Manor is a respectable place to grow up.”
“Things were very different back then,” Harry pointed out. “I think we could make this work.”
“So you don’t think I should talk to him? I thought you just said—”
more draco coming soon, i promise!
When the clock struck nine, Luna gathered everyone into the sitting room to open their designated Secret Santa gifts. Harry had given up trying to make contact with Draco at this stage and was instead decidedly
“Oh?” Asked Ginny, passing the gravy jug across to Lily. “Why’s that?”
The unwelcoming tone Draco’s voice had taken on was harsh, causing Harry to wince and take an automatic step backwards. He took a deep breath, chewing on his lip as he watched Draco shake his head.
. “It just all seems… Like a different love than what I imagined. Remember how you described loving Astoria? That Christmas when I—”
Shaking his head, Draco huffed. “Have you forgotten that I’m married?”
Ginny rolled her eyes, leaning back into her seat. “You’re such a stubborn idiot. Sure, Harry. Whatever you say.”
He curled in on himself once more, the fire within his veins dulling as a stray tear rolled out of his right eye and found its way to the cold floor. How he longed for a confidante. Someone to discuss this with, like he had with his fellow Slytherins so many times before everything had headed South in sixth year. Draco tried and failed not to think about how much he wanted his mother right now. She may have been blinded, perhaps simply biased, but she had always been good at imparting words of wisdom and making Draco feel loved. He tried not to think too deeply into what she’d allowed to happen under their roof and instead focused on the younger years, time spent wandering the Manor gardens and halls together as he grew up.
Harry gave a smile he hoped was more convincing than it felt. The last thing he needed right now was a distraught Molly Weasley, fretting over his wellbeing while mourning the loss of her son. He felt bad enough that Ron was here having to take on his troubles.

Time has passed so slow
“No.” His tone was blunt, leaving no room for discussion. “That’s not fair on her, or either of us.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to stay for the sentencing?” Hermione asked.
“I doubt anyone would think that,” Harry scoffed. “It’s been over a decade.”
Dinner had been a terse affair with Hermione first ordering Harry to set new boundaries with Kreacher while she was present before they enjoyed lamb stew in silence, save asking one another to pass the salt. It had been close to 11 o’clock by the time they’d made it home for the night so he hoped his attempt at feigning exhaustion had worked as he excused himself for bed shortly after dinner, though he doubted Hermione had truly bought it. She’d at first given him a distracted nod from the couch where she was pursuing the material she’d been given from Healer Benson, but called out after him as he made it to the bottom stair. Harry had paused and turned back as she expressed concern and instructed him to under no circumstances try keep himself awake, and to let her know if anything seemed worrying. Avoiding her eyes he’d simply nodded and said his goodnight before making his way upstairs and casting the strongest silencing charm on his bedroom door he could muster.
Harry watched over Ron’s shoulder as Hermione’s jaw set in a firm line as her nostrils flared. “He will, but that’s hardly the point. You saw what happened in there. He’s clearly—”
, he thought as he took in the face that stared back at him. Though still slightly emaciated, his face looked brighter and if it weren’t for the haunted depths of his green eyes Harry would almost be convinced that he was perfectly alright.
“Oh. Well, good for you then.”
“I got Ron,” Harry admitted with a grin.
Azkaban was a miserable thought, but one he’d had plenty of time to dwell on over the past few weeks alone at home. Draco had never really expected to come out of the war in a good situation, one way or another. In truth, he’d never spared much thought for what would happen when it all ended, because he’d never expected to make it out alive
The fierce intensity behind Potter’s green eyes as they locked onto Draco’s gaze was mesmerising, all consuming. Draco felt his breath catch as he schooled his expression into the mocking boredom he so desperately strived for.
Harry quickly learned in the days following the Battle of Hogwarts that he screamed in his sleep. The nightmares were nothing new. The pain that came with them just seemed to intensify as time went by. Hermione had woken him the first night; they had opted to stay at Grimmauld Place in lieu of the Burrow to give the Weasleys some room to grieve, a decision which now seemed to be for the best. The look in her eyes was enough for him to place a silencing charm on his door every night following, but sometimes he had still woken feeling as if he was being watched. After a few more days of this routine Harry had decided that sleep was no longer a priority and now bore her judgemental yet worried stares with a grain of salt.
Ron said something then, or maybe it was George; all Harry knew was that the world seemed to stand still around him. He was vaguely aware of being handed something, of Hermione’s voice in his ear, but all he could hear was Arthur’s final words echoing through his skull.
Hesitating, Draco chewed on his lip as he thought for a moment. “You know that we can’t tell anyone.” At Harry’s immediate nod, he shook his head. “I mean it, Scorpius comes first.”
“He came by… Oh, that daft bugger.” She sighed, raising her hands in frustration. “Why are you both so impossibly hopeless?”
This was the first time they’d seen each other since then. A few owls had gone back and forth after that—Harry had even gotten one letter delivered by Hestia while he was at work—but then Harry had gone away on a case and had to remain untraceable until his return last week.
“About sex?”
He nodded and shifted his weight awkwardly from side to side, unsure of what else to say. “Gin, I…”
“I did notice Weasley was in the shop more frequently these days. How are you handling it?”
“Right.” Harry let out a long exhale, steeling himself for what he hoped wouldn’t piss Draco off too much. “Listen, Draco. About last year, I—”
The room had been bustling with noise and activity moments ago and until he had stepped into the crowd’s line of vision, he had thought the sounds around him would drive his nerves to the edge. He hadn’t realised how much worse it would be once they saw him and began to stare. Anyone who hadn’t already been seated immediately fell into place as a hush swept through the courtroom and though he had been adamant that he wouldn’t drop his gaze, the pitying looks were simply too much for him to bear.
“Hmm.” Draco tilted his head, a puzzled look on his face. “You’re more of a kneazle person than a crup person then, I take it?”
“If all the kids were home for more than a few months at a time you’d go a bit crazy, admit it.”
“You told me to,” Harry said, confused.
“—who have mothers,” Harry reminded him.
Standing, he looked back to her and watched her turn on her heel and lead the way out into the garden. He followed hastily, almost tripping over his feet as he stepped out from the chair and gulped, trying to remind himself that everything was going to work out just fine. They didn’t have to make any big decisions today. He didn’t think either of them were really ready for that yet.
“I— Sorry, I should have—“
“Thanks, Dad!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So not much has really changed. Why bother getting divorced then?”
“Sorry, Hermione. Yes?” He forced his eyes to focus on hers.
Draco, who he hadn’t heard from since last Christmas despite him saying he would owl. Harry had considered sending the first letter when it became clear Draco wouldn’t write but as time passed he realised that perhaps some things were better put to rest. Whatever he’d seen in their friendship was clearly one sided, not worth pursuing enough for the other man to put quill to parchment. He hadn’t even seen Draco at the Ministry or in Diagon, and Harry wasn’t stupid enough to make the mistake of turning up at the Manor unannounced or even uninvited. He’d been able to ignore how hurt he was after Ginny had fallen pregnant, preparing their lives to welcome James and knowing his attention was better placed where it was both needed and appreciated.
Malfoy arched an eyebrow, looking confused. “You included your address in the owl last night.”
“Right,” Mary said with a quiet snort. Turning to Harry, she raised an eyebrow. “Not much for the festive spirit, is he?”
Confused, Harry looked to Ginny who was sharing an amused look with Astoria.
Pale blonde hair twisted up on top of her head, highlighting the sharp features of her undeniably beautiful face. Her complexion was alabaster—they would have very pasty kids, Harry thought to himself—with rosy tint on her cheeks and lips. She was in casual wear from what he could tell: a simple turquoise sweater and dark wash jeans. The reflection from her engagement ring was so bright Harry thought it might blind someone on a sunnier day than today.
“Yeah, but I didn’t know he actually killed people…” Teddy’s eyes flickered to where Draco stood a few steps behind Harry, uncertainty showing. “Gran just said he made some bad choices.”
Harry was in the kitchen clearing up the last of their glasses when he heard the familiar voice speaking in muted tones in the lounge. Ginny’s quick reflexes were the only thing that had her wand out fast enough to slow the glass that slipped from his hand, leaving enough time for her to catch it after crossing the room from where she’d waited in the doorway.
Harry leaned forward, their lips so close now they were almost brushing. “No, not really. A lot longer than I had realised, apparently.”
He sighed, opening his eyes finally to look at her questioning face. “Believe me, I wish this was that.”
Harry smiled, hearing the love in Draco’s tone. He looked up at his boyfriend in the chair behind him, seeing Draco watching him with a slight crease between his brows. “What?”
He appreciated it, he truly did. He’d never had anyone to care about him before Hogwarts, and Harry definitely wasn’t about to take his friends for granted after all that they’d been through. It was just—
“I know you said it’s not serious,” Hermione said, her cautious voice warning Harry that she was about to say something she knew he mightn’t like. “But I also know how much you’ve wanted this. Don’t let things go on like this too long without making sure he’s ready for all the things that come with dating you, Harry. At some point he will have to forgive himself.”
“Not as much as he does Astoria. She spoils him rotten.”
Peeking out from behind his fingers he saw Hermione drawing her wand and complied, placing his hands on the table between them.
“You don’t have to make any decisions today,” Draco reassured in a low tone, mindful eyes on the children near them. “I think it’s worth waiting until Lily starts Hogwarts anyway. Take some time to consider it.”
“Not much to tell,” Harry said with a shrug. “It’s alright, I guess. Better before Ron left.”
“Draco, we were—”
Draco's fists balled by his sides. “I am well aware of the specifics of my marriage. That’s my situation and I choose to stay with her. Scorpius will be raised by two loving parents and it would do you well to think of your own children.”
“No. I think I’m managing quite fine without him. I just…” Trailing off, he saw the hint of pity come into Hermione’s eyes. “I didn’t actually think he would leave Astoria when we split, but a small part of me hoped he would at least want to talk.”
“That was prior to what I just witnessed.” Turning to Ron and Hermione now, Healer Benson gave them a reassuring nod before speaking. “Would you both mind giving us a moment?”
“The Muggle-born is telling Kreacher that Master Harry does not need worry about heart attack. The Muggle-born is not looking very happy with Master Harry.”
Taken aback, Harry frowned. “You what?”
Harry paused, eyes falling on where Fortescue’s used to be. Barely aware of the tides of people flowing past him, it felt as if time stood still as his mind was transported back to so many summers ago, when that shop had been a safe haven for him. A sadness spread through him, chest tightening as he turned away and boxed his emotions up for a later moment. Now was not the time for sentimental memories. Pushing on, he was passing the entrance to Eeylops Owl Emporium when he heard shouts coming from inside and couldn’t help lingering to listen in on the gruff tones that were rapidly rising in volume.
Laughing, Harry looked between Teddy’s obvious glee and Malfoy’s poorly concealed amusement. “Is that so?”
“Okay.” Harry waited to see if she would say anything further and realising she really wasn’t going to explain more, he shrugged. “I’ll talk to him.”
before eventually, gradually, the world faded away into blackness.
“That he’s up to something? Just get the map out while you’re at it, see how that goes for you.”
It had been barely a month since their crazy year on the run had come to an end, yet Hermione was already filling in some of the gaps at the Ministry and helping to negotiate new laws, all the while attending most of the Death Eater trials—some as a witness, some as a scribe—and still coming home at the end of every day questioning whether they would let her take her NEWTs over Summer, or if she should try and do seventh year again via correspondence.
“I don’t think you’re getting rid of him,” Harry said with a grin. “Better just name him and be done with it.”
“Oh.” Harry looked to the back of the shop where there were at least twenty birds all clambering for attention, trying to screech louder than each other. “Any luck?”
Meeting Harry’s eyes with a defeated stare, Draco shrugged. “Then I guess I’ve satisfied the Malfoy name with that lie after all. I’ve stopped myself from being happy, Harry. More than that, I’ve been a selfish prick and you deserve better.”
It wasn’t the kind of kiss that shattered the earth or ruined a person, though in truth Draco had ruined him long ago. No, that kiss would come later, when they were away from prying eyes and the winter cold. This was short, sweet and had the corners of Harry’s mouth pulling up in a smile even before they’d pulled away from one another.
Everything seemed to be going perfectly until halfway through lunch, a late arriver joined their midst.
Turning to glare at Harry—which was incredibly unfair, seeing as he’d done nothing more than witness the spectacle—Malfoy huffed. “I’ll be needing an owl as well then, I suppose.”
Was it weird that he kept all of the letters he had received from Draco? Harry told himself it was perfectly normal to hold onto correspondence; he kept all of Ginny’s letters! Maybe that was a poor comparison. Reassuring himself as he remembered that he kept all of Ron’s letters, and the ones from Hermione — well, except for the unimportant ones. What even constituted unimportant? His other friends simply sent far too many for him to keep them all whereas he and Draco only owled when it was of great importance.
“Mm. From what I observed, you saw something in this room that scared you. Do you think the surge in your magic had anything to do with the hallucination?”
Hermione quietened at Healer Benson’s raised hand, chewing on her bottom lip as she wrung her hands in what seemed to be an effort to distract herself from telling the healer what she knew.
“Harry, I—”
“Harry…It’s a harmless Christmas gift exchange.” Hermione frowned at him, an almost pitying look on her face. “I don’t see what about it has to be suspicious.”
“Alright,” Harry said as he sidled back into the booth they were sharing with the round of drinks. “What I reckon you’ve got to do, Dean, is get to know Pansy a bit. Tomorrow at the pub with all of us, try chatting to her more or something. Even just listen in to what she’s saying, right?”
The lake cast patterns on the walls of the common room as their friends continued conversations by the fire, unaware of the significant moment Harry was sharing with him. Once again Draco had to remind himself that this was their reality now, that nothing would take this away from him.
. Got it.” With a lopsided grin that had Draco’s stomach flipping, Potter took his hand back and used it to point at the stairs. “Shall we?”
“I think she looks like a Hestia, don’t you?”
Teddy flung himself at Draco, dropping the trunk Harry had charmed lighter for him in the middle of the thoroughfare. Andromeda picked it up with a sigh, shooting an amused look back at Harry before she turned to fuss over Teddy as he pulled away from the hug.
“Butter chicken medium, palak paneer mild, two garlic naan and samosas. Did you want anything else?”
Hoping he didn’t sound as breathless as he felt, Draco gulped. “What about—what about everyone else?”
“Stories, yeah.”
Sighing, Harry resolved not to start this particular breed of argument again today. “Shall we?” He said, indicating to the stairwell just past them. “We’ll be late if we don’t leave soon.”
Passing her his robes to charm flat, Harry felt a wave of gratitude wash over him as he realised that no matter how disappointed she may be with his choices sometimes, Hermione would always be there for him. The gratitude quickly gave way to guilt and he tried to swallow it down, wondering what he could do to make it up to her.
“How do you—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You absolute sap,” Draco said fondly, leaning forward to place a soft kiss on his forehead.
It was very rare these days that Harry resented Hermione’s astute observation skills. With her work getting busier they’d seen less of each other in recent months and for the most part, when they did see one another he talked openly and didn’t feel like he was hiding anything. The one secret he was keeping was also the topic that most of his friends had given up on, instead supporting Harry’s decision to focus on the children and occasionally asking him to volunteer his time when they needed some extra hands.
“Why not? I know you’re mostly doing this for your parents but surely they would still want you to be in love with whoever you marry, right?”
He tried his hardest not to resent Healer Benson for the lack of both Wideye and Dreamless Sleep to beat his feelings of exhaustion and reminded himself that he was lucky to be in his own bed, not laying in St Mungo’s right now as he stared at the ceiling. Perhaps sleep wouldn’t be so bad tonight. It was ironic in the worst kind of way that now he accepted the possibility of sleeping tonight, his body refused to actually comply. The split second nap he’d had earlier must have tricked his mind into thinking it would be a few more days before rest came again.
Shrugging, Harry grimaced. “I’m happy for him, but it’s a bit different now.”
“Sure thing. Thanks, Healer Benson.” Harry stood and made to leave, being stopped by a gentle arm across his chest as he reached the door.
Harry wasn’t sure if he had been quite as petulant as James by fourth year, but the difference between the boy he’d sent off on the Hogwarts Express a few months ago and the one who stood before him on Platform 9 3/4 was undeniable. Watching his son sulk at nobody in particular, Harry bit back a grin upon seeing Lily’s attempts to distract him with her overly enthusiastic questions about Hogwarts; she was due to start in the coming year and her excitement could barely be contained. Hugo stood beside her, wide eyed as he watched the students coming home for Christmas reuniting with their families. One of the last to disembark was Albus, arm in arm with Scorpius, and making Harry’s heart ache at the similarity in appearance to he and Draco at their age, while quite the contrast to their behaviour.
Shuddering at the thought, he took a few steps closer and inspected Potter’s face. The moon’s light illuminated his angular features as he paced towards the window before turning, casting his face into darkness. Draco marvelled at how though his face held so many conflicted emotions, his body seemed to move with an ease that he didn’t know if he’d ever witnessed before. Taking a minute to appreciate a moment he’d likely never bear witness to again, Draco allowed a soft smile before reminding himself why he continued to frequent this corridor.
“—Master does not even want Kreacher to clean for him, no, Master Harry says the Muggle-born is upset by Kreacher’s cleaning—“
Leather motorcycle boots
The cracker steadied in Harry’s hand as Draco took the other end with a firm grip. Their eyes met and Harry caught the slight twitch of Draco’s mouth as he raised an eyebrow in challenge.
Having the grace to look sheepish at that, Harry ducked his head. “I, er, maybe use them a lot on the kids. I didn’t really have anyone looking out for me when I was their age—”
“I am!” Harry snapped. “Why do you even care? You’ve made it perfectly clear that you don’t care about love, stop making fun of me for doing it.”
As he paced the well-worn stone floor beneath him he wondered when all of that had begun to change. It had happened so slowly he hadn't really realised just how differently his world view had become until after the war had ended. He knew that his faith was fading, for sure, but even his disgust and hatred of those different to him had changed. It hadn't disappeared altogether—that would take nothing short of a miracle—but he no longer felt the need to lord his high place in society or sneer at those of different parentage. In fact, he almost felt indifferent about it all. He had still ruled the schoolyard and looked down on others but his heart hadn’t been in it. The tighter he was wrapped in the Dark Lord’s web, the less energy he was able to spare for the things that had once seemed so important to him. Those long months, years even of having the Dark Lord breathing down his neck and commanding him to do tasks he was expected to fail at had sparked something within him which in turn had completely extinguished something else entirely.
“So this is the old Black house? Looks a lot brighter than I remember, though it has been a few decades.”
Silence followed for a minute, before Andromeda’s voice cut through the room.
for your own good.”
Arthur’s grey flecked eyebrows almost disappeared into his hairline. “That’s almost unheard of, really. We always thought it was just a story parents made up to control marriages. That was a big thing back in the day, marrying for family alliances and intervening parents trying to determine the best partner for their kids.”
With a laugh that was more like a bark, Draco shook his head, gaze dropping to the floor between them. “I do, and honestly? I’m glad. I spent my whole life wanting to please him, to fit the role of the Malfoy heir. Mother, rest her soul, wasn’t much better when it came down to it and when— when it happened,” Draco said, voice stumbling over his words as it shook. “Astoria and I talked about what we wanted to do. I’ve been more stubborn than I needed to be because I was scared of being what my father was, when really I think all I’ve done is show Scorpius that it’s more important to lie to protect your family name than to live life how you want to.”
Seamus stifled a laugh, turning it into a poor attempt at a cough. “Thanks, Miss Chelsea.”
excited. Harry had
“I…suppose that’s manageable,” Draco replied. “I’m going to go find Andromeda before I leave. Enjoy the rest of your Christmas, Harry.”
laugh, but infinitely scarier because they weren’t entirely sure what was about to follow. She placed her hands on her hips and squared up, jutting out her chin defiantly.
“He told you they’re getting divorced?” Harry asked, barely keeping his jaw from dropping at the casual nature with which his son divulged this information.
“I know. It doesn’t matter anyway.”
“Master seems to be overreacting,” Kreacher muttered. “Does Master require anything else from Kreacher?”
“No, no. You say Ginny’s a super mum? What about you some day, when you're parenting and still managing to revolutionise laws and change the wizarding world? I can hardly see you giving that up when you decide to have kids.”
“You really don’t have to stay.”
“Harry, shut up.”
“No need to be so dramatic about it,” Draco grumbled. “Or is this the part that’s too much for you?”
“Right.” Pausing, Harry tried and failed to make sense of her words. “Should something have changed?”
Slipping them on, Harry realised he’d said at least the last part of his musing aloud and sighed. “‘Mione, he was practically jumping for joy. I can’t take that away from him, it’d be cruel.”
Harry shook his head. “That’s the exact opposite of what he would want, ‘Mione. The less he has to think about what could potentially happen— which infuriates me, by the way.” Throwing back a large sip of his drink, Harry groaned before running his spare hand through his hair. “He’s so bloody stubborn! Always thinking that it would be the end of the world if people got talking about us. He thinks they’d make it seem like he’d cursed me into it or something. Isn’t that stupid?”
“Well, I was wondering…” She dropped her voice to a whisper and leaned in close across the table. “Could we go speak to someone at St Mungo’s? I know you’re not a huge fan,” She added hurriedly, “But it would really make me feel better about it and, um, they might be able to give you an alternative suggestion.”
“I want to keep being friends, at least. But I don’t know if we can right now. It’s hard to see you and know you might not want this anymore, even though…”
“Astoria
“Yeah, sure Gin.”
Harry knew he was spiralling. He knew this was a sign that he wasn’t okay. But he couldn’t stop: the emotions he had been holding back for so long refused to stay at bay now that he’d opened the floodgates. With a bittersweet sigh he blamed it on everyone asking him to open up about what he was experiencing earlier. Surely he hadn’t been so bad before everyone had tried to make him talk?
Because he was still in St Mungo’s.
“I— we shouldn’t have done that,” Draco blurted out.
Draco rolled his eyes. “She must love it then.” There was a pause as he took a sip of the coffee before placing it on the table, eyes downcast at his hands. “How are you and Ginevra anyway?”
“I guess we’ll have to work on changing that then,” he said tentatively, “starting with keeping this Christmas lights tradition. Think we can manage that much?" At Draco's barely perceptible nod, Harry grinned before making to catch up with the boys before they crossed the road ahead. "There’s no rush, Draco.”
“My parents want me married soon. Well, my father does; I know he’s in Azkaban—which is where mother is right now, incidentally, or she'd be here too—but his opinions still hold a lot of weight with mother. She also wants me to have someone keeping me company around the Manor after father’s eventual release, because they’ll be taking off to one of the properties in France. Something about… Less horrible memories, more opportunities.”
“I see.” Raising her brows at him, Hermione smirked smugly. “But more partial to one particular man.”
“Well, nothing seems more out of place than to be expected at this stage.”
“I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said last September,” Draco said in a hushed tone, eyes staying determinedly focussed on the boys ahead of them. “About how you said you didn’t get divorced for me.”
Andromeda’s laughter sung out from the lounge, making Harry wish he could hear more of what was being said.
Hearing the finality in his words, Harry paused, wheels spinning in his head. There was no doubt in his mind that living with Draco was what he wanted, but the Manor hadn’t been quite what he’d envisioned for them. Could he live in a residence that held so much darkness in its past?
“You did?” James said, mocking tone to his voice. “That’s so embarrassing.”
“Harry James Potter. Did you really just give Kreacher orders to clean your room—“
Harry sighed. “Remember what happened last time you both ignored me about what Malfoy was up to?”
“—But Master does not clean himself, so Kreacher thinks unless the Muggle-born is going to clean up after Master—“
“Er, right.” Scratching the stubble on his chin, Harry dug around for a comfortable conversation topic. “Seen Teddy lately?”
He shook his head. “No, I just want to know what the ‘things of importance’ are.”
“They really bowed?” Ron asked, eyes wide with shock. “You must be joking, mate. That’s a nightmare.”
“My family is quite private.”
inside him. He was almost able to put all of the day’s wondering behind him, almost able to pack all of the confronting thoughts of today into a box for a later date. Then he noticed a small red fleck getting closer to his windows and realised just as the poor bird was about to collide with them what he was actually seeing in time to open the one nearest him.
Whatever she’d been expecting him to say, it certainly wasn’t that. After a second her eyebrows came back down from her hairline. “What about it?”
It took him a few flabbergasted moments to find his voice and then Harry was saying “yes, yes of course” and tasting wetness as tears he hadn’t realised he was crying found their way to his mouth. Draco was sliding the gold band on his finger and bringing his face down to press their lips together, awkward angle be damned, as their hands clasped together as if to defy anyone who ever made them part again.
“Even—do you mean she leaves the Manor with you usually?”
“My sister died because of him.” The man continued, oblivious to Harry’s warning as the crazed gestures sped up and his face became a deeper shade of puce. “He cannot just walk free! You must help me show him justice, I beg of you.”
Having the decency to shoot Draco an apologetic look, Harry continued. “It feels a bit like that some days. I know that I love Ginny, but I also love Hermione, and Ron, and Luna, and—”
Exaggerating his sweeping gesture, Draco quirked an eyebrow. “Be my guest.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve spent time with him. You know what he’s like when he wants to complain about something.”
“Yeah.”
They were well and truly most of the way through the bottle of Ogden’s finest when Ron mentioned the notice in the Prophet that morning.
“I am not panicking.”
Harry stared at her, dumbfounded. Had he had too much to drink? Was he hallucinating?
? “It left a lot to be desired, and I don’t think a long term stay will actually do you much good.”
“If it’s just not having much time, then I really don’t mind this being casual while we figure things out.”
“I see. I’ll assume they were related then, for now.”
“You bet on this?” Harry said, incredulous. “Why didn’t you just—“
“I see.”
“We’re going to France, Harry. Marry your fiancée. You love her, anyone can see that much.”
Straightening up, it was evident in Malfoy’s expression that he hadn’t expected to see Harry here either. There was no scorn in his expression, none of the malice those eyes had once held. Just a wary caution that Harry felt echoed in his chest, along with a tentative want for something more. A hesitant question as to whether they could put it all behind them and hold civil conversation for the remainder of the morning; surely that wasn’t too much to ask?
Frowning, Harry shook his head. “Are you sure you want to pretend we’re still together? I mean, what if one of us does eventually want to start seeing someone?”
Harry was stepping closer as he spoke, not realising just how close they’d gotten until he came chest to chest with Draco and time felt as if it stood still. How long they stood there with their eyes locked on one another he would never be sure. His eyes flickered down to Draco’s lips and he wondered, wanted, needed to know how he tasted.
“No, I’m not done.” Taking a steeling breath, Harry pushed on. “Maybe we jumped into things too soon when we first did, but we managed two bloody years of things being okay between us. I know it wasn’t much, just taking time where we could find it, but it was still two years, Draco.” Harry’s voice cracked with the weight of his words, tears brimming in his eyes. “Then you ran at the first sign of conflict. That kid was just parroting some nonsense he’d heard his dad say, and you didn’t even give us a chance to get past that. You’ve had excuse after excuse and while I understand why, I need to know that you’re actually in it for real this time.”
It had been almost a week since the visit to
“Shacked up with a Death Eater, eh? Seems a bit counterintuitive to your whole thing, if you ask me. Still, I suppose you have let things run away from you since quitting the Aurors. Shame, I really had high hopes for you Harry. Shouldn’t have thrown your lot in with this crowd.”
“We haven’t really talked about it, honestly. Sometimes I see her looking at me though, like she knows. Like she feels the same way even. Is that horrible?”
“Oh yeah? They’re taking the kids across then?” Harry paused, thinking of the tiny toddlers he’d seen crawling around the Burrow a few weeks ago. “Be a bit of a pain travelling with those two, wouldn’t it?”
They both breathed shakily as their reflections showed the other what they were each too proud to say, even now: “sorry” wasn’t even close to covering what had brought about that incident, but their mutual fear and will to survive had been stronger than either conscience. Draco shook with all of the unspoken emotions and hoped that Harry couldn’t see it, despite so obviously seeing and feeling Harry quiver next to where he stood.
He sighed, running a hand through his messy hair. “Can you honestly say I don’t deserve some answers right now?”
“Gin, were you staring at him?”
“Gee, ‘Mione. That really narrows it down,” Harry said, taking great care to keep his face as neutral as possible. He now had a very good idea of who she’d seen in the DMLE that morning; he’d come home with Harry last night after their Christmas light outing and woken him up very enthusiastically before work.
Knowing that he was the reason Ginny was hurting, knowing that she had spent time dwelling on this and praying that she’d been wrong, well. It broke him to realise the damage he’d done — and there he was again, making this about him. As he placed the glass back on the table and coughed up the taste of acidic death, he saw that Ginny’s plan was the best way forward for both of them. It was what she needed and if he was going to feel any amount of okay with the situation he’d landed them in it would have to be through letting Ginny take the lead. Making any big decisions now wasn’t going to change how they felt, it would just give him a temporary feeling of penance that would drag out their family’s pain in the long run.
He dropped his head into his hands with a heavy sigh. “I’m so sorry, Gin. I really—”
“Well, Potter. You’ve got some nerve.”
“But you make it so easy!” Astoria remarked with a soft laugh. At Harry’s answering groan, she gave his shoulder a gentle pat. “You’re right, that’s not why I’m here. Though it’s unlike you to be so observant, if my memory serves correctly.”
Draco shot him an amused look. “What are you, like, twelve?”
“I— what?”
Harry swallowed nervously. “Maybe that’s why you should help me figure this out.”
“Who told you that, Al?” Harry asked cautiously, before taking a sip from his Butterbeer.
His intention had been to come home and pretend that everything was alright while he figured out how to broach the subject. He had forgotten to factor in how perceptive Ginny was; he only took a few steps through the door before she sighed, ushering him through to the kitchen with a finger pressed to her lips to stay silent.
“Well I obviously wasn’t about to apparate with her, was I?” Shooting Harry a look that heavily implied he thought Harry was an idiot, Malfoy shook his head. “It’s her own fault for refusing not to fly further than a mile at a time.”
“Honestly?” Ginny sighed, tipping her head back to look at the ceiling. “I don’t want to make any big decisions before the holidays. You know mum will kick up a fuss, and it’s Albus’ first Christmas, and… These are all excuses, I know. What do you want to do, Harry?”
“What if… What if you get me some of that Wideye I know you’ve got downstairs somewhere, and I let you sort out this mess?” He gestured to the room around him as Kreacher’s wrinkled face lit up with excitement. Raising an index finger to his mouth, Harry lowered his voice conspiratorially and leaned forward. “But you can’t tell Hermione. Okay?”
“We’re at least thirty seconds without a hex, so I’d say some things do change.”
“I have something I’ve been meaning to tell you, actually. About… About what you said yesterday. When you were talking with Weasley.”
His mind blanked as he tried to think of any answer other than Voldemort occupying their room. “With the colours, you mean?”
“Gin…” He shared a look with her, heart aching as he saw the concern in her eyes. “Give us a minute.”
“There he is!” Harry cheered as he scooped Teddy up from the ground and spun him around in a hug. It wasn’t until he placed Teddy back on his feet that he noticed the extra set of feet standing further down the hallway from where Teddy had arrived.
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, sounding scandalised. “Careful, he’ll hear you and then you’ll have a lot of explaining to do when Ginny comes home tonight to hear James saying bollocks.”
Draco sighed, leaning against the marble bannister. “Might as well bloody spell it out for you." He closed his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. "I’m gay, Harry.”
“I didn’t,” Draco mumbled, after a pause.
“Nice to hear you say I’m thinking at all,” Harry retorted, watching Draco roll his eyes in response. “It’s a lot to think on, that’s all.”
“Nick, go home and tell your dad I killed people too, okay? See how he takes that.” At the wide-eyed expressions before him, Harry realised that maybe he was shouting a bit louder than strictly necessary. Dropping his voice, Harry tried to dial it back a bit. “Sorry, don’t tell him that. But just know there’s more to it than what you’re hearing.”
“I’ll take the Christmas cocoa, please. Extra marshmallows.”

, Harry thought.
Draco looked up, shooting Harry a dark glare. “It’s a bit more complicated than that. I know you gave up the Black family home, but it wasn’t actually your family so it’s not quite the same—”
She smiled sadly. “If you don’t mind. Just for a few weeks or so. I’ll be off to Hogwarts again soon.”
“Have a coffee with me?” Harry blurted, panic setting in as he saw both faces look at him in varying states of confusion. “I mean, er. Surely you’ve time to stay for a quick coffee? For old time’s sake?”
“Too late for that. He’s been staring this way for at least the last hour now.”
The Healer met his eyes and Harry felt a pang in his chest as he was reminded of Dumbledore; she seemed to see the unspoken words, everything he had omitted during his conversation with the nurse earlier. “To have exuded such raw magical energy in your sleep? Yes, Mister Potter. I had hoped there was an easier explanation for what appears to be happening.”
“I don’t want to hate you anymore, Malfoy.”
“I… Do you think you’ll come back soon? To visit Andromeda?”
“Malfoy—Draco. Wait.”
Groaning as he lay back on the unmade bed, Harry pressed both fists to his eyes. “She’s going to kill me,” he mumbled into his hands. “Kreacher, she’s going to kill me.”
“I am not a workaholic!” He snapped, shaking his head as he reached for the glass in front of him. “And I’ve sent you perfectly reasonable times. You were unavailable
“I can come back if this isn’t a good time?”
“Stop being so mean.” Darting his tongue out to clean the cocoa that he could feel around his mouth, Harry frowned as he watched Draco take a keen interest in the spectacle. “No, no. Don’t make fun of me for choosing the messy drink.”
The three of them waved goodbye long after the train had curved around the bend, nobody wanting to be the first to admit that Teddy was truly gone for the time being. It was Harry who dropped his arm first, turning to look back towards the man beside him.
The gloved hand on his cheek asking a question, the answering heat in Draco’s gaze all the encouragement he needed. Harry leaned forward, warm breath brushing across cold lips. Hands shaking with what felt like two decades of anticipation.
Laughing as he watched a model dragon
“Shut up.”
In a rare bout of emotion that Harry hadn't seen for years, Draco began pacing, hands tearing through his hair. “I am not in love with—that’s not what this is! I just… Fuck,” he added as he swivelled to face them both. “I’m sorry.”
Harry was on him in an instant, pressing Draco against the mahogany and sending the small Christmas tree and mountain of paper on his desk crashing to the floor in his haste. Hands pinning wrists to the desk, mouths insistent and warm, reacquainting themselves with an unmatched urgency. Bringing a hand up to tangle in blonde strands, Harry let out a muffled groan at the feel of Draco’s lips beneath his. The kiss was rough around the edges; anger twined with want, fear coupled with lust. Everything Harry had felt over the past years without him—both good and bad, and all shades in between—was poured into the press of his tongue against Draco’s, the roll of his hips, the desperation of his
With a bitter laugh Harry leaned forward and put his elbows on the table, aware of how close this brought him to Draco. “How do I even bring that up though? Hey, Gin. How was your day? I saw Draco. Wondered if we’re actually in love.”
As she sipped on her champagne, Ginny looked over Harry’s shoulder. When she looked back to him there was a mischievous glint in her eyes. “You could just walk over there and snog him senseless.”
Contrasting the icy blues
“Oh?” Quirking a brow, Malfoy tilted his head. “Andromeda did mention a new magical neighbour.”
“Kreacher?” He half-whispered to the empty bathroom.
After exchanging hugs and well wishes they began gathering their belongings to leave, Ron and Hermione opting to floo straight to the Burrow while Harry and Ginny decided they would make a quick stop at home first to drop off gifts they’d received and collect the few they’d forgotten to bring that morning. Teddy was barely keeping his eyes open as Andromeda lifted him over her shoulder, waving goodbye to the departing couple by the fireplace.
Looking down at the papers on the desk in front of him, Draco nodded. “Finalised as of about four hours ago.”
“Time to get out the Christmas crackers!”
“Walk with me then?” Looking around as if to remind Draco of their current audience, Harry dropped his voice even lower. “We can’t have this conversation here,”
Hermione turned to face him, eyebrows raising at the freely offered information. “Did she?”
Harry nodded, cautious smile on his face. “I didn’t really understand what they did though. Are they supposed to mean something?”
Sighing, Malfoy shook his head with a soft chuckle. “Not in the way you’re thinking, at the very least.”
“Muggle?” Harry felt slightly crestfallen but tried not to let it show. “So these aren’t the crackers that set off fireworks?”
The shop owner laughed. “She’s useless for long distance, and hates carrying anything heavy.”
“Harry…”
Hands shaking to the point that the chains around them were clinking against his chair, Draco felt a bead of sweat slide down the side of his face as he tried not to turn and watch whoever was making such loud, echoing footsteps behind him.
Sighing, Healer Benson fixed Harry with a stern look. “Trust me when I say that leaning on your friends for support is not making their lives harder. What will make it harder in the long run is if you shut them out now, when you likely need them the most.”
“Your glamour is dulling.”
“Yes, Harry. Sex.” Pausing, Draco considered how best to put it. “I don’t… Really feel that way about anyone. At all.”
“What if…” Harry trailed off, wondering how best to move forward. “What if we just do this, for now? You’re right about us having too much history, and the papers are horrible at the best of times. And I know you won’t leave Astoria, and we’re both somewhat responsible for this one,” he said as he gestured to Teddy in front of them. “I’d hate for things to get messy. Having you cut contact every other year is a bit difficult now that we’re seeing more of each other.”
is a… ritual, I suppose. When you’ve suffered a lot. Go to the place of the pain and sit with it until it sets you free. I’ve been trying, but—”
“Yeah, why?”
He had given up on trying to pinpoint the exact moment the rage had come over him because it hadn’t felt like it was entirely his rage; it felt like when Voldemort used to feel strong emotions and he would feel their shadow, except the feeling was amplified exponentially. The implications of this were less than desirable to say the least. Thinking about the possibility that someone was possessing him or worse, part of Voldemort was still inhabiting his body was not something he had intended on spending his nights doing.
He hated to admit his worries about spending the next few months in a tiny, windowless cell that had the capability of freezing him to death and rendering him insane when such a large part of him felt a strange feeling of peace and safety. It was getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that nobody who wished him harm could reach him here without a lot of connections that had surely died with the Dark Lord. The part of him singing out for safety was also the part of him that hoped he didn’t survive the cold chills and insanity, and Draco didn’t know what to make of this information. He only hoped he could cling onto what little dignity and mental strength he had left until his sentence was lifted.
And for all that he may have felt boxed into a corner, Harry couldn’t deny the elation that came with Astoria’s confirmation: Draco still wanted him.
“Oh! Er, congratulations.”
apart some mornings—but from what he could tell, most of his year had been spent living on the continent with his mother and fiancee. It was different seeing him printed in grainy black and white images to in the flesh now, all six foot something of the man he once thought he knew.
“I’d best be getting off.”
“Merry Christmas, Draco. Andromeda,” he said as he placed a kiss on her cheek. “Thank you for today. Say bye to Teddy for me.”
“The right—What do you mean, the right connections? Ron’s my best mate!”
Heart catching in his throat as he let the owl in and gave her one of Apollo’s treats, Harry tore into the sealed envelope so eagerly it was a miracle the contents were unharmed. A soft smile crossed his features as he took in the beautiful image; it was London, lit up with festive lights and a monumental Christmas tree in the foreground. Mild surprise came upon realising that it wasn’t moving, clearly taken by a muggle camera. Turning the photo over, his smile became an outright grin at the short message written in handwriting that he had dearly missed.
He squeezed his eyes closed and imagined the fireplace in his room back at the Manor. No, that wouldn’t do. Too much had happened in that room and he… Well, that just wasn’t going to keep him warm right now.
the new way he’s wearing his hair and how much you just want to run your fingers through it. I believe earlier you mentioned that you
No, Draco was perfectly content to ignore the fact that along with the rest of the Wizarding world, his arch nemesis was now his saviour. The bloody Chosen One. He refused to admit that perhaps there was still some resentment and embarrassment hanging around from their first day at Hogwarts and more than that, the chance of any feelings he’d had towards Potter other than pure loathing and disgust. What had happened earlier this week was no different. Frankly, he should be feeling more pissed off with the scrawny prat - if he was such a powerful witness, Draco shouldn’t have ended up behind bars!
“Oh, and Harry?” Came the suspiciously nonchalant call from her retreating figure. “Clear tomorrow afternoon. We’ve got plans.”
Descending the staircase now, Draco’s voice was strong yet gentle, something in his eyes Harry couldn’t quite place. Had it been anyone else, he would have called it pity.
Gloved hand finding Draco's beside him, Harry took hold of it and squeezed gently. "Yeah, I'll think on it."
“You don’t mean…”
“Malfoy?”
Draco scoffed, kicking at the ground as he mumbled. “Sounds a whole lot like trying to save me.”
“Mmm,” Ginny said as she stepped back and folded her arms across her chest. “I suppose you didn’t do anything to provoke that, right?”
“Oh.” Grumbling at her as he cheered inwardly at how quickly she’d glossed over his hesitation to talk, Harry slumped his shoulders and gave a sad nod. “I mean, I get it…”
“It only seems like it’s ‘out of nowhere’ because you are the most oblivious idiot I have ever had the misfortune of knowing.” She rolled her eyes as she ran a perfectly manicured hand through her hair. “Listen to me, Potter, because I’m not going to say this twice. Everyone knows you’re obsessed with Draco—don’t interrupt me! It’s very obvious—but he’s convinced you can’t possibly be interested in him because you’re too busy accusing him of evil wrongdoings to show interest like any
“—and on top of that, ask him for more Wideye potion despite me telling you explicitly on Tuesday that you needed to stop drinking it?”
Looking to see Potter watching him intently, Draco dipped his head again to avoid looking at those entrancing eyes. Why Potter felt okay subverting from surnames he wasn’t certain, all he knew that was that the first time his name had fallen from that mouth he’d been forced to throw a hex, for old times’ sake. It had nothing to do with how much he wanted to hear it again, and everything to do with the fact that he knew he was alone in this emotional crusade. At this point he wasn’t sure which was worse: the feelings he refused to address, or the tapestry before them both that housed a door so darkly charred it was evident it would never open again.
“It’s not, but I suspect it’s less about Scorpius and more about him. Similar to you after the war, really. He doesn’t think he deserves happiness after all he’s done. Draco wants to pay for his crimes, even though he really already has. Does that make sense?”
Harry led Malfoy down the hallway and through to the kitchen before rummaging through the cupboards for two whiskey tumblers and a bottle of Ogden’s he was yet to open. They then sat at the table, an awkward silence falling over the room broken only by the sounds of Harry preparing their drinks. He was grateful that at the very least he'd had the decency to keep this room tidy in his drunken stupor last night.
Healer Benson sighed before giving a small nod. “To be perfectly frank, I would keep him if I could. However he will be more comfortable in his own home and that’s what appears to be most important at this stage. I cannot find anything physically causing the magical outbursts and until there is evidence of ailment, we cannot keep him without his consent.”
Grimacing as he plugged his nose and drank down the rest of the brandy, Harry considered Ginny’s logic. It felt like an easy out for now and he almost wanted to say
Hermione was looking back and forth between the two of them and Harry pointedly avoided looking her way, knowing she likely remembered him asking her about them earlier this year. He’d given up any hope of understanding what transpired that day after he realised Draco wasn’t going to write anyway and it seemed like a dead end when Hermione hadn’t been able to find anything. If he’d realised they were a pureblood thing sooner… Well, Arthur Weasley still probably wasn’t the first person he’d have asked.
“—So you see, taking too much of either breeds a dependence which is not only dangerous but hard to break. You’re likely already finding it harder to wake up each day without Wideye and Dreamless Sleep will be at the other end of the spectrum: you’ll find it near impossible to wind down without it.”
Shaking his head, Draco’s voice was small as he dropped his eyes to the pavement. “You really want this?”

“But what does that—”
The laughter that followed was loud enough to have woken the entire house, tears streaming down Ron’s face as he howled. “Wish I’d been there to see that. The look on your face, I bet—”
“One of us has to be,” she mumbled into the front of his sweater. “Merlin knows it isn’t you. Wanna talk about it?”
The first small step of many
Yeah, alright then.”
Healer Benson offered a challenging smirk that seemed less suited to her soft features and more suited to… Well. Someone more pointy. “Try me, Harry. I think you may be surprised.”
Potter looked back from where he’d followed Draco’s gaze to the stairs. “I don’t understand.”
Whistling to himself, he headed back out to the bar and waved for another round of drinks, ale for the boys and a lager for him. While he waited he contemplated what Malfoy could possibly be doing, suggesting a gift swap like this. It seemed so… Harmless. Wholesome, even. Which was precisely why Harry knew something sinister was underway. Harmless and wholesome were words that you applied to kittens, not Draco sodding Malfoy. He vowed to get to the bottom of this, if it was the last thing he ever did.
. He couldn’t think about the feelings right now, for fear he’d never come out of his spiralling thoughts.
It went against everything he knew to be breathing easier than before at a time when everything should have been falling apart. Then again, his life had been so many “should have”s lately without enough questioning on his part. It takes a lot to question all you’ve ever known, even when its flaws are staring you in the face. He had been just a kid, he was barely of age and to be at a place where he could admit it was something almost admirable but it triggered so much unease inside him that he felt physically ill.
There had been no snowfall tonight, but after their traditional light adventure Draco had suggested they walk down to Hyde Park to see the ice rink. When they were almost there, Harry spotted some icy slush presumably from snow earlier in the week and gestured to Draco for the boys to follow him.
“I thought this was about Draco. Now you want me to quit my job?”
“Alright, Potter. Nothing that bad here then. What exactly is your point?”
Pansy seemed to take that as confirmation enough that her message had landed, nodding sharply at him before turning to walk back into the pub.
“Working on it how? Like, you’ve owled him and told him that you want to see him…or you’ve ignored him completely and are pretending he doesn’t exist?”
Turning his head to catch Draco’s wistful look in his direction, Harry gave him a gentle smile. “What if it doesn’t have to?”
“That must have been quite the dream, Mister Potter.”
“Do you want help looking?”
“I can’t,” Draco said as he stepped back. “Harry, I…”
Malfoy waved off his apology, eyes determinedly fixed on the floor. “It’s fine. I mean, you can hardly blame people for wanting to off ex-Death Eaters, right?”
Harry watched as Draco fiddled with the sleeves of his jumper, taking slow breaths like Harry knew he did when something was had made him angry or was particularly stressful. It was the latter today, of course; they’d decided it was time for Draco to meet the family and if they didn’t leave in the next two minutes they were going to be late.
“I asked Kreacher to cook tonight.”
Craning his neck, Harry spotted Draco standing by the far wall, looking far too relaxed and delectable as ever in his perfectly tailored navy dress robes as he conversed with what appeared to be Hermione’s newest hire.
“I know why you asked me about it. I knew as soon as you asked, and I know what you’re thinking about now.”
“Well, Harry. Tea?” She gestured to a table by one of the giant windows that looked out on presumably the Manor grounds. “I can have Cillor bring some for us now.”
He had known this was coming—especially with him visiting Ron at the Burrow so often—but he had been hoping to avoid the conversation just a little longer.
Standing again, Draco tipped back the dregs of his coffee and shook his head. “Go home, Harry. Please don’t contact me again unless you genuinely figure things out with Ginevra and are able to respect my marriage equally.”
Throwing her hands in the air, Pansy shrieked. “Merlin’s beard! If I have to spend another holiday season with Draco moping around about absolutely everything... Except Harry Potter, of course, because there’s
Steady movements were important here. It was like approaching a Hippogriff.
It was the week before Christmas and both of their wives were out getting pampered—pregnancy packages, whatever they entailed—so he had taken up residence in the London apartment Ron and Hermione shared. They hadn’t had much time together outside of family lunches and occasional pub nights with friends so they’d spent the morning having a proper laugh like they used to before cracking open the Ogden’s.
Hermione snorted, flicking her wrist to add more tinsel to the tree in question. “Like she doesn’t know her ex-husband is more partial to men.”
Refusing to look back at Malfoy behind him, Harry took a step closer to the man and gently began to reach for his wand arm, stilling it with his touch. “I understand that you lost people you loved, Mr…?”
“Great. It’s been at least a month since your last Malfoy rant,” she teased as she pressed past him and made her way down the corridor. “Mind making me some tea and coming to chat in bed? My back’s killing me.”
He watched her walk back inside the pub, words echoing in his head.
“That was incredibly rude and just goes to show your poor upbringing.” The words were out before Draco had a chance to stop them, his hands coming up to cover his mouth as he watched the shaking of Harry’s shoulders still. “I didn’t—”
“Harry, for Merlin’s sake.” Draco raised his hands, exasperated. “You are out of line. Do not tell me how to raise my son or what to do about my marriage.”
“James is up for debate,” Draco muttered as he rolled his eyes.
Once James was tucked into the crib and Harry had cast the necessary observation spells on his room he ducked out into the kitchen, intending to make a cup of tea and maybe curl up with the most recent
He couldn’t help himself; Harry curled over his stomach as the laughter took hold and shook through his body. Unsure if the scoff that came from Malfoy’s direction was imagined or not, he took another moment before straightening up and making eye contact with the blonde, wiping the corners of his eyes.
“We’ve only got them for two weeks,” Harry pointed out. “I want as much time with them as I can.”
mentions of festive drinking in this chapter!
It was overwhelming, if Harry was being perfectly honest with himself. Ron as well; they were both obviously proud of her but this was something else, even by Hermione standards. Ron was confused, trying to figure out where to go from here and in general just mourning the losses his family had felt while trying to hold everything together, while Harry felt like he didn’t know who he was anymore. He also still felt horribly responsible for every single death that had come about in the last sixteen years and it was a huge burden to bear.
weekend in October! What kind of availability is that?”
would. He’s obviously been obsessed with you for just as long, if not longer, except he’s gone and done the mature thing and admit that he wants to do more adult things than just taunt you for the rest of your sorry existence.”
“Er…” Harry garnered nothing from the Healer’s expression as he met her blank stare. “I guess?”
Draco shook his head. “Not moving, just— hang on. You really weren’t listening to me before?”
“Lee Jordan.”
“I see.” Looking to Harry for confirmation, Healer Benson shot him a sympathetic smile at his clear discomfort. “Harry, do you feel you’ve left out anything of great importance?”
"Your great aunt or something? Yeah, that's Walburga."
“Oh yeah,” Albus said before dropping his voice to a whisper barely loud enough to hear. “Dad, are we really going to visit Scorp’s house for lunch tomorrow?”
up in Ottery St Mary, and they’re proper Muggle crackers.”
was the best cafe they’d found and had become a tradition of sorts—along with one decidedly awkward attempt at a pub night in August. Harry still didn’t know what to make of it; Draco had insisted upon leaving after only half an hour, citing some nonsense about worrying he wouldn’t be able to hold his Firewhiskey.
“My mother wouldn’t hurt her. Surely even you—“
“Are you—Honestly, Harry. You leave your fiancée for work, for months at a time, and think you’re doing her a favour? I thought you were marrying for love.”
He didn’t reply, ears straining to make out the words he wasn’t quite close enough to hear.
Ron stopped talking abruptly as he caught sight of something behind Harry's shoulder, face becoming solemn. Turning slowly, his suspicions were confirmed as he saw Ginny standing in the doorway.
next to Ron and Hermione in the corner farthest from the kitchen and closest to the Christmas tree. Names were called, presents were delegated and time passed in a blurry haze. It wasn’t until he heard his name that he looked up from the bottom of the eggnog he was nursing that Harry dared chance a glance across the room and met Pansy’s disappointed glare that he realised Draco was no longer there. He caught the slightest glimpse of blonde in his peripheral and turned to see Draco making his way through to the kitchen and saw the perfect opportunity to corner him under the pretence of refilling his drink.
He made it to four before hearing Draco clear his throat.
Draco was dressed in a shade of deep blue—
spent the last week spiralling through all kinds of anticipatory emotions as he realised that it was almost time to meet Teddy on Platform 9 3/4 for Christmas hols, which meant that he was going to see Draco again.
Ginny snapped, pointing her finger across the table at him accusatorially. “Percy, this wasn’t Harry at all. This was all you.”
Harry groaned, leaning back to lay on the bed so he wouldn’t have to look at the disappointment on Kreacher’s face as the elf examined a stray sock that had landed in his bin at some point.
Your warmed heart trembles
“Not all of us,” Hermione muttered.
“No, I mean the magic link your blood would have to the house. For once I’m not trying to insult you, Potter.
“Shut it, Potter.” Malfoy’s voice lacked the usual hostile edge, taking on a panicked and almost shrill quality.
Dean nodded, mouth full of potatoes spraying as he spoke the affirmative. “Yeah, ‘right mate.”
“You’re bloody lucky to have her, you know. How on earth that woman continues working while taking care of James and doesn’t drive herself mad worrying about you in the field all day—”
Waving the hand that wasn’t holding her wine, Astoria smiled. “Forgive me for reading between the lines. Now, promise me that you’ll continue to pester my husband so I can go save him from William in good conscience?”
“They seem to like it here,” Draco said slowly, head gesturing towards their children in the snow. “Don’t you think?”
as she shook her head knowingly, pulling the paper crown out of her end and placing it firmly on his head.
All the time he had spent preparing for war, learning about his past, knowing what was expected of him: it had never really left much time for planning a happy future. He’d always expected to die, deep down. He hadn’t wanted to—nobody ever really wants to, do they?—but it hadn’t come as a huge shock when Dumbledore’s gift had started to make sense. To be here today, alive, with no terrifying battle in the foreseeable future should have been a welcomed change but instead he felt empty inside.
“Well, the story goes that if your cracker breaks normally—one person gets a side, the other person doesn’t—then the colour of the fireworks shows how successful the partnership will be. But then if there are fireworks and the cracker doesn’t break at all, it’s a cursed marriage. The fireworks for those are always dark, usually a black or red through them. Means someone’s going to die.”
He felt Draco’s smile against his lips in response. “Merry Christmas, Harry.”
“Oh. Well, you could still talk about it?” Harry paused, a small frown forming between his brows as he thought. “She said… Asexual, she said. She seemed to know a lot about it. Maybe she knows other asexual people?”
Harry thanked the nurse and waited until he left the room before sighing as he sank back down onto the bed, exhausted from the diagnostic spells and questioning he’d been subjected to.
“You’re lucky I find your oblivious nature charming,” Draco muttered, giving a squeeze to the shoulder his other hand still rested on. “As I was saying before you so rudely interrupted me, I love so many things about you, and despite all of the reasons we’ve given one another over the years for this not to work… Well, against all odds, you may just be the best thing to ever happen to me. I’m sorry I was such a stubborn fool for so many years, and now that we’re past that, I hope you’ll agree to tolerate me for many more. As my husband,” he added nervously, mouth seeming to trip over the words. “Harry James Potter, will you marry me?”
“How is Lee, anyway?” Harry asked as he leaned on the countertop. “Still planning to be on the continent for the next few weeks?”
Past that aspect of conversation his memories weren’t so clear; he’d skipped lunch that day and the wine had hit him harder than he intended. There had been a lot of name calling, that much he could remember.
Healer Benson smiled in her direction with a small nod. “I presume you read Jezos?” At Hermione’s affirmative, she continued. “Well-informed man with a slight flair for the dramatic, I’m afraid. While the short term side effects and potential long term damage are nothing to turn your nose up at,” turning her head to Harry now, Healer Benson fixed him with a pointed stare. “There is much to be said for our body’s want to survive. I highly advise against taking any more stimulants, Harry.”
“Oi! I think it’s time for you to leave,” Ron cut in, glaring daggers from his seat.
“Er, yeah. Is there any Wideye potion left?”
Draco tilted his head, raising a brow in Harry’s direction. “What in Merlin’s name for? It’s behind us now.
(See the end of the chapter for
They held each other for a moment longer before separating as Ginny spoke to Harry’s left.
That was the thought on his mind as he finally gave in to his exhaustion and drifted off.
He’d left it open-ended, being as truthful as he could in that he wasn’t sure they could make things work if there wasn’t a more definitive commitment being made, and then respected Draco’s wishes and ceased communication. It had been harder than he’d anticipated; though many of his letters had gone unanswered, it had still felt like there was something between him. Now he was left with nothing but a Draco shaped hole in his chest that he refused to let heal.
Draco looked away, eyes glistening in the low light. “I know I don’t deserve another chance,” he said, voice quivering as he spoke. “Merlin, I didn’t even expect you to have waited this long. I thought I’d fucked up forever.”
“I—We should be getting back, our friends—“
“Is that what you think then? That I can only date someone who… Someone like me?”
It all clicked into place then, the weekend prior, the comments that had come over the years and even some of the—
Malfoy sighed. “Just because I don’t want to hex you anymore doesn’t mean I want to be your friend, Potter.”
Harry nodded at her with a grateful smile before turning back to look at Draco, seeing the blonde looking warily at the proffered cracker.
feel about that one, huh? Right after the announcement and everything.”
She snorted, which quickly gave way to a full bellied roaring chuckle as she was unable to hold it in any longer. “About bloody time,” she managed between laughs, shaking roughly.
The nightmares still so welcome
So consumed by the bizarre yet enchanting combination of aromas that surrounded him, Harry almost walked into Malfoy as he rounded the corner. Taking a quick step back he saw Malfoy quirk a brow as his eyes were drifting down and Harry panicked at the thought of having done something embarrassing, like leaving his fly undone.
He dropped it, knowing this was her way of coping. Turning back to the Auror’s manual he’d been trying to focus on for the better part of the past hour, Harry conceded defeat and summoned his latest case notes from the bedside table in their spare room. Opening the lavender coloured folder, Harry held back a sigh as he began reading the now familiar medical notes of the three most recent victims.

“Lily was… unintentional,” Harry admitted, keeping an eye on Teddy and Nick to make sure they didn’t catch what he was saying. Seeing them staring wide eyed at the angelic lights that hung between buildings, he continued. “I don’t regret it at all, of course. I love Lily more than anything. But we’d decided to divorce right before Ginny got pregnant and then realised it would be better for the family if we kept it quiet until after she was born. Ended up giving Gin a lot more time to talk some sense into me about quitting work as well, among other things.”
“No, I—”
“He mentioned in his last owl he might be seeing George and Angelina. Something about a family New Year’s getaway while the shop quietens down.”
There was a pause before Draco spoke, his overly nonchalant tone telling Harry just how interested he was in the response. “So, are you still as interested as you were when you made a scene in the middle of that crowded cafe? I’ve never been able to go back, I’ll have you know.”
With that he made to leave the cafe, stopping as Harry’s fingers closed around his wrist.
Through her gritted teeth, Hermione all but growled at him. “Did you listen to anything I said?”
The emotional landslide
“Merry Christmas, Harry.”
“Okay,” he began cautiously. “Does this mean that—when you’re back in the country, of course—we can be, er, not-friends again?”
uploading the next chapter now and it is pure fluff as an apology 🥰💕
“‘Right, well…”
“Harry.” Hermione’s voice was firm and he sunk into the chair, losing all possible resolve to pretend nothing had just happened.
Draco laughed softly, the sound not quite reaching his eyes. “Just wondering how things might have been different.”
Green eyes met his once more as Harry looked up from underneath dark lashes. “All of it, Draco. All of you.
Pointing at Draco, Nick met Harry’s eyes with an aggressive stare, daring him to call out the lie. “He killed people.”
In the end it turned out he needn’t have worried. Albus and Scorpius were too delighted at the prospect of more time together to allow anyone’s mood to dampen, and even James seemed to brood a bit less as the day passed. After Cillor had served lunch in the East Wing, Draco had suggested they go outside to see the grounds and that’s how they had ended up in their current predicament: supervising a snowball fight that seemed to suspiciously catch them in the middle more often than not.
He rambled on for a while as Harry stood, grin stretching across his face like a lunatic as he felt a warmth spreading through him.
Ginny shrugged. “At least as long as we’ve been talking about him then. Might as well be an hour for the amount you’ve ignored every word I’ve said, while panicking about being in the same room as him.”
“Um, could you—could you just tell me if wizards can have heart attacks? Like muggles can?”
Harry nodded, grimacing at the memory. “One of them, yeah. Another kissed my bloody hand. It was awful.”
“Harry,” she sighed. “You love him. Anyone can see it, and while I appreciate you trying to be delicate—”
Though Draco refused to look up at this point, he could feel the gazes of the witches and wizards fixating back on where he was seated in the middle of the room.
“Just making sure I understand what you’re saying, Healer Benson. You, St Mungo’s, an institution designed to aid witches and wizards experiencing health issues, don’t actually have the resources to help Harry right now? While he, a wizard, is experiencing health issues? Is that what you’re saying? That you… Simply don’t do that here?”
There was an awkward silence, during which Harry refused to make eye contact and instead focused on absolutely everything else surrounding them. It wasn’t until Malfoy cleared his throat that he dared glance back at where he stood.
,” Dean moaned. “I mean, I know we see her most weeks and she’s not the absolute worst anymore. But what the Hell am I supposed to get her?”
Walking closer to where he sat, she dissolved the shimmering protection spell with an absent wave of her wand. Harry gulped as she then pointed the wand in his direction, flinching slightly before watching an intricate pulsing web of coloured threads appear above his body. It was mesmerising, something he thought he could stare at forever; if it weren’t for Hermione’s gasp in the corner Harry might have completely forgotten the reasons for its existence
“It looks lovely, Luna.”
Cillor showed Harry to the study, assuring him that Master Draco would be taking his tea in there before bed. It appeared he hadn’t been alerted to Harry’s arrival, as the shock that crossed Draco’s features as he entered wasn’t masked carefully enough for Harry not to notice it.
With a sad smile, Hermione reached across the gap between them to lay her hand on his forearm. “I know. You may not talk about it much, but you’re incredibly easy to read after all these years.”
Perhaps his thoughts had always been skewed towards the wrong side, though he couldn’t say for sure which was wrong anymore. The beliefs he’d clung to so tightly in his early days might be problematic if he delved deep but it had been so much less effort and headache to be programmed that way. Ignorance truly was bliss, he could see that so clearly now.
He lay down on his bed and closed his eyes, trying to calm his breathing. The thought of actually having something physically wrong was stressing him out and Harry didn’t think that would help him avoid the problem. He sat and tried to focus on happy memories because he didn’t really know what else to do. After what seemed like a lifetime but was probably only a few moments the pain seemed to ease to a dull ache and he breathed a sigh of relief.
“I, er…”

Malfoy frowned for a moment before realising the joke for what it was. Harry watched as he tried to mask his laugh with a cough, turning his face away.
Harry could see that it was taking every ounce of restraint for Hermione not to butt in as she shifted awkwardly in the corner of the room. Ron stood next to her, expression somewhere between amused and scared—whether due to his proximity to Hermione or what he was hearing from Healer Benson, Harry couldn’t say—as he watched the conversation silently.
Stopping time and space
“How’d your
“Well? Luna said he was a right mess this morning, Pansy won’t shut up about it and honestly if I didn’t get to you first I think she would have wrung your neck for it. You’ve got thirty seconds. What happened?”
Gulping, Draco hesitated before nodding, placing his drink down on the counter. “Are you sure?”
Harmless on him, truth on you
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s going to be fine. You’ve seen Hermione at work plenty of times now, we’ve had dinner with her and Ron, Ginny will be there to support us—”
“Not Potter.” he corrected softly, before barraging ahead with a raising voice. “I know. I wish I could take it back, I didn’t know what the spell did and I am so—”
He looked at her as if to say
Why does he still look your way?
He shrugged. “Just like to know who to return the next ones I save to.”
“‘Cause Dad killed the Dark Lord.” At that use of Voldemort’s name, Harry shared a look with Ginny as Albus continued, oblivious. “So everyone was looking at him because he’s a war hero.”
“Well, a lot of the marked Death Eaters were a generation above us, so they’d made their decisions early and had time to accept how things could be. But Draco… Well, he was raised to think he would have it all, then coaxed into it for his family and ended up left with nothing.”
“You sure?” Ginny asked even as she passed their sleeping child to him.
Ginny spun quickly back around to face him, her hair following her gracefully and settling over one shoulder to hang across the side of her face. Brushing it back, she locked eyes with him and he saw it: though the pain and fighting of the recent past were evident, there was still that fire burning behind them and he almost flinched away, not knowing what to make of it. Harry brought a hand through his hair absentmindedly and pressed his lips together as he tried not to break the stare, knowing she needed this right now, possibly more than he did.
Malfoy sipped on his drink, eyes fixed on the wall opposite them. After a moment he placed the drink down, clearing his throat. “It doesn’t much matter. Tell me about the Aurors, if you’re so determined to talk about work.”
Leaning against the wall beside his still open front door, Harry sank slowly to the ground, breath coming in heavy pants as he gave up on rational thought for another night.
It had been a strange experience, to say the least. Honestly, Draco was trying to lump it in with everything else he had sworn not to ruminate on once he was behind bars; the memories it dredged up were too confronting.
Another silence fell and Harry fished around desperately for a topic to keep the conversation going. In the end, it was the scarlet red light display behind Malfoy’s head that did the trick.
