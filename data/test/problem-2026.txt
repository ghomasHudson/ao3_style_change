“Anything for Harry Potter!” The tiny elf squeaked. She carefully took the lavish vase and disappeared with a loud
Malfoy knelt before Harry, reaching up to measure each broad thigh and his inseam. Harry bit his lip hard, hoping the pain would distract him from thoughts of Malfoy kneeling before him in a different situation, but then Malfoy’s hand brushed against his sensitive cock far too firmly to be accidental. Harry gasped as his body flooded with warmth. He looked down to see Malfoy studying him as he reached out and deliberately stroked Harry again.
Harry realized. He made a sound halfway between a grunt and a squeak and whirled back to face his friends.
--” Draco began, but he saw the warning look on Harry’s face and wisely composed himself. “Very well. I demand a kiss, though.”
A hot flush of desire ran through Harry’s body before he could remind himself that he was being held by
Malfoy smiled. “I know precisely what you mean. It was much the same for me when I decided to return.”
“I suppose so,” Malfoy replied, leveling a bemused stare at the biscuits. “And nothing was incinerated. Congratulations, Potter.” A puff of floury, vanilla-scented air rushed through the kitchen, causing much coughing and eye watering. When the two men had recovered, a green baize door had appeared, tucked into a little cranny behind the gleaming range.
He thought it his own voice for a moment, until he recalled that Professor Slughorn had always acted ambivalently toward him. And a
“The library is this way,” Malfoy murmured shakily. He led Harry back through the blue hallway, over a transparent bridge that Harry didn’t trust not to shatter, and into a dark wood-paneled wing of the house. The door he opened next revealed a cozy library, full of books and squashy sofas and a crackling fireplace.
Harry finally interrupted when Draco started running out of steam. “See, that’s a much better response, you numpty. It looks like you completely forgot the Yule ball, too. There’s that to look forward to, and then you’ll be back at school before you know it.”
A few more experimental strokes later, Harry fell into a rhythm. But apparently he was going too slow for Draco’s liking. Strong arms lifted him and in the blink of an eye, Harry was straddling Draco’s warm lap. And
After he left Malfoy Manor, Harry had intended to do a lot of things. He’d intended to organize his notes about the house, and write up his reflections for the Ministry on the other houses he’d visited, and finally purchase clothes that fit (which he should have done years ago, according to Hermione. She didn’t “understand how anyone takes you seriously as a magical theorist, Harry, when all your trainers have holes and you don’t own any proper trousers”).
sexy,” Draco slurred, waggling his eyebrows suggestively. His eyes were closed, which rather detracted from the intended effect.
Eventually, the biscuits finished baking. After close inspection, Harry considered the biscuits they’d made very passable. They were a bit lopsided, but their imperfections had allowed little crumbly bits on top to caramelize and crisp up interestingly.
The look with which Malfoy regarded Harry reminded him of a snake sizing up its prey. “Before the school year is out, I think. Yes, that sounds about right.”
“Yeah, let’s go.” Harry nodded. They had almost made it safely to the entryway when the floor rippled, causing Harry to stumble into Malfoy. He probably would have fallen directly onto the very hard parquet if Malfoy hadn’t reached out his arms and caught him. As willowy and, well,
Winter had come to Hogwarts. November held the school and its students in her icy grip, and everyone was bundled up in woolly layers of sweaters and cloaks. Peeves had taken to swooping about the castle with buckets of frigid water, threatening to dump them on unsuspecting students, and only a severe scolding from an irate McGonagall had stopped him making good on his threat.
spread on a water cracker, and the flakes of salt are divine. Particularly topped with a sprig of rosemary, yes...” Malfoy trailed off as he reminisced. Harry was glad he’d stopped when he did; if he’d said one more word about eating slug smeared on a weird cracker, Harry would have projectile vomited across the table and all over Malfoy’s fancy suit.
“Oh! There they are, come on.” Harry made a beeline for where Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Neville stood surveying the ball. Draco grumbled as he was tugged along by his (outrageously expensive) sleeve, but Harry knew he was only protesting on principle.
Despite his whirlwind approach, Draco had managed to cobble together quite the ensemble. Harry was garbed in fitted black trousers, an emerald silk button-down, and sleek dragonhide boots. He was, however, puzzled by the last item Draco had chosen. “Draco, what’s this leather bit on top?”
Flames flickered low in the fireplace of the deserted eighth year common room that evening, throwing more shadows than light. Harry was tucked between Draco’s legs on one of the low couches, doing his best to just feel and not think. The hard planes of Draco’s chest against his own, the familiar spicy scent of cedar and lemon, the muffled growls Draco made as he did his level best to snog Harry senseless… Harry’s only thought was
“Malfoy, huh?” The name felt odd in Harry’s mouth, like discovering an old flavor that one had forgotten. “I don’t think their house was on the old list. What d’you reckon he’s been up to since I left?”
ed and threw open the lid of the gift box. Pistachio green dress robes gleamed lustrous within, accompanied by black dress shoes, an impossibly soft set of black trousers, and the crispest white shirt Harry had ever seen.
“Dunno. Some of the letters were nice, but he sounded too bloody sure of himself in everything he sent me this week. Makes me want to knock him down a peg,” Harry grunted, clenching his fists in the fluffy blanket swathing his shoulders.
Harry took his time processing what he’d learned about Malfoy. He processed it in bed every night, and every morning in the shower, and during one particularly long Sunday all over Grimmauld Place until he’d processed himself raw. Finally, Harry decided he had to discuss The Malfoy Situation with Ron and Hermione. Surely they would understand his predicament.
“Please, just go dance already. No need to argue about it for half an hour,” Hermione teased, toasting them with Ron’s stolen drink.
Debauchery? Where? That picture was perfectly appropriate; they ban you if they’re not. Seamus learned that the hard way after he tried doing “thirsty Thursdays” one too many times. He accidentally posted a video of himself showering and Dean had kittens.
Draco spared a moment for himself to cry or scream or whatever he needed to do. It was disgusting to be so effusive, but he refused to embarrass himself in front of Mother or, Salazar forbid, the
That certainly wasn’t what Harry had been expecting. His brain didn’t seem to be working anymore, and Draco scoffed. “Answer quickly, if you please. My trousers are beginning to crease.”
“What a welcome home,” Harry chuckled, relaxing into the sofa’s plush cushions. It was awfully pleasant there in the library, with the cheery fire and sunlight streaming through a large picture window. The light glancing off his feathery eyelashes and finely molded cheekbones made Malfoy resemble a prince in a children’s picture book. Had he posed in the light like that on purpose? Harry winced at his own fancifulness and turned his attention away from Malfoy’s pointy face, back to their conversation.
.” A muscle jumped in Draco’s clenched jaw. He stopped pacing and stared down Harry with piercing grey eyes. “You mean you don’t want me.”
“Mmm, alright.” After Harry’s face was practically cracked in half by a large yawn, Draco easily steered a sleep-woozy Harry to his dormitory. Other than the silver and emerald splashed on every surface, it was the same as Harry’s room.
Smith smirked and tightened his grip on Harry’s shoulder. “Go ahead then. I’d like to see you try. Death Eater scum, you shouldn’t be talking to him anyway.”
“Hey, it’s Pig!” Ron mumbled through a mouthful of scrambled eggs. “Must be Mum writing back.” Pigwidgeon landed near Ron and held out his letter, but there was another one attached to it. This one had Harry’s name written on it, in Mr. Weasley’s cramped handwriting.
“Mmm, my pretty, pretty mate,” Draco hummed, nuzzling into Harry’s neck for all his drunk self was worth. “I can smell my scent on you. S’nice.”
illuminated the mirror before him, and he recoiled in shock. The man in the mirror before him was not Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy’s eyes brightened as Harry dipped one crunchy spider leg into the secret sauce. Ugh, it tasted like pickles and old cheese: Harry now had absolutely no desire to know what it contained.
Hermione’s face looked exactly as amused as she was trying not to be. “It was on the ground floor, to be fair. Nobody was injured. But Helena in my office was there, and she told me all about it. The man had the nerve to try to grope Malfoy--”
Still, Harry hesitated. “I don’t want to bother your roommate. It’s Zabini, right? He doesn’t really seem the easygoing sort.”
Exactly one week after Harry’s revelatory conversation with Malfoy, an untidy scraggle of feathers winged awkwardly toward the Gryffindor table.
Harry didn’t understand at all what he had done wrong. He had only asked one question, and now Draco was gawking at him as though he’d burned down Malfoy Manor and cavorted naked in the expensive ashes in full view of the press. They were only sitting on the sofa, and were both fully dressed, so Harry couldn’t think of a single reason his question had elicited such horror.
“Hmm. Alright then…” Potter grinned and went on, weaving a tale about gum disease and secret informants that was surprisingly captivating. Draco listened carefully, asking questions in all the right places and seriously considering subscribing to the
After a few weeks of careful friendship, Malfoy invited Harry to the lake shore for a picnic. They met at the kitchens and coaxed the house elves into giving them a bulging hamper, replete with pastries, ice cold pumpkin juice, and interesting little sandwiches. Together they wandered the shore until they found a sunny spot under the boughs of a sweeping oak tree.
“Alright, Malfoy, hold your thestrals! I wasn’t presuming anything, just trying to figure out what the house was thinking.”
“You ask such a thing, and you know that I am unable to refuse you?” Draco had been trapped by Potter as soon as he had made his request. He had no choice now except to go through with the boon, unless Potter rescinded his request. Draco desperately hoped he would do so, for he longer even had a heart to be wooed or (more likely) broken.
Harry strode right to the edge of the lake before finally halting and dropping his school bag on the icy ground. He breathed hard for a moment, studying the choppy grey waters of the lake. He had no clue what to do next.
“Doubt Ron’ll be very excited about it, but yes. Thanks, ‘Mione!” Harry practically ran into Ron as he barreled through the door, but narrowly avoided collision and shot him a cheeky grin.
“S’fine,” Ron grunted, his eyes trained on Hermione. “Nothing yet, but I’m sure ‘Mione’ll find something eventually. Why’s Malfoy giving us a sodding letter in front of the whole bleeding school if it’s not supposed to blow up in our faces or curse us with horns?”
Somehow, Harry had chosen exactly the wrong thing to say. Hermione’s face grew pinched, and Ron flinched, hitting his head on the heavy lid of the trunk. Fortunately, Hermione responded calmly. “No, I’ve decided to celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts this year. Lots of reading to be done.”
Your congratulations are very kind. I would tell my wife, but we separated quietly a few years ago. Once Astoria and I had produced an heir, there was no love lost between us and we went our separate ways. However, she is still an excellent mother to Scorpius, who is five years old.
“--and either he’s a bigger bastard than ever, or he understood me when I spoke Parseltongue last week. He definitely didn’t in second year. I think he learned it just to fuck with my head.”
“Never. I was born for this.” He raised his stupid posh voice a tad and said, “We’re ready, Headmistress.”
Harry set the note aside carefully and tapped the bubble with his wand. It disintegrated into a shimmering mist. Fragile, cream-colored lilies in a modest vase slowly opened, blooming as Harry watched. Harry reached out one hand to brush a soft petal, but found they were made of wafer-thin glass. A gasp escaped Harry as he realized how rare and intricate the magic that created them must have been. He sat down hard on his bed, surrounded by the scent of lilies.
Harry didn’t have time to think about the letter again until late that night, when Ron had been given a calming draught and immediately conked out on his bed. He thought of Teddy, the tiny, chubby baby who was technically his godson. Merlin, he was adorable, especially the way his fuzzy baby hair flashed from brown to blue and blurred through the whole rainbow when he was happy. Andromeda Tonks was caring for Teddy while Harry finished school, but maybe after that--maybe Harry could have his own family again. For keeps this time. Maybe it would not be so awful to hope, just this once. If Malfoy wanted to be a part of that...that might be alright. If he stopped being such a git and actually respected Harry’s boundaries.
Malfoy carded one hand through Harry’s messy hair and let his hand rest at the nape of Harry’s neck. It was delightfully warm and heavy. “Or it could be just you and I. Wouldn’t that be pleasant? Hogsmeade is charming at this time of year, and I heard there’s a new café opening next to Zonko’s. I’ll buy you a drink,” he coaxed, with a cheeky wink.
Draco grinned widely. “He’s quite easygoing in my presence. I assure you, it shan’t be a problem. Come, mate.”
A fragment of fragrant parchment dislodged itself from the ceiling and fluttered to the floor. Malfoy picked it up and read aloud:
Harry stifled a groan as she tugged him into the Great Hall, Ron trudging along behind them. He’d tried to stay behind in the common room, but she had threatened to petrify and levitate him in “or so help me, Harry, I will ensure that you fail all your NEWTS and never get a proper job.” By Hermione’s standards this was a very serious threat indeed, so Harry had settled for some half-hearted complaining and grudgingly followed Hermione out of the portrait hole.
“It is, welcome to Spideys! Can we get you anything, perhaps a spot of lunch?” Harry thought he said the name very strangely. Then again, on the scale of weird things happening just in the last thirty seconds, pronunciation was at the very bottom of the list.
Potter grinned. “Yeah, it’s been about four months now. Surprise!” He turned back to Draco, nuzzling his cheek softly. “So, you’re coming home with me, yeah?”
Harry pointedly did not wear the cloak, but kept it hanging in a corner of their dorm room. Where he could admire it, if he so desired. (Ron certainly did, and Harry caught him posing dramatically in front of the mirror with it more than once.) As irked as he was by the sappy letters and extravagant gifts, Harry had to admit a certain nagging desire to see what would come next.
” Draco’s face had been melancholy indeed as he brushed a kiss across Harry’s knuckles and boarded the Hogwarts Express.
Harry let out a strangled scream. “Ron! Look at this!” He passed Ron the letter and began thudding his head against the solid Gryffindor table.
“That didn’t feel like Legilimency,” he muttered. “That was accidental. But who…?” As Draco tried to slow his heartbeat, to assess his symptoms, he felt a longing he hadn’t noticed before. A slight pull to the southwest, perhaps?
“Harry, I know you hate Malfoy, but that was rather lovely,” she said breathily, a glazed look in her eyes. The other girls in the class seemed to agree with her. Hannah Abbott was staring dreamily at Harry and sighing. Parvati and Padma were whispering animatedly to each other, casting speculative looks in his direction, and Su Li was doing the same with Mandy Brocklehurst. Pansy Parkinson was tugging furiously at Malfoy’s sleeve, but he was refusing to look at her. Harry half-thought Malfoy was blushing, but figured it was just a trick of the light. Malfoy never blushed; it wasn’t a very Slytherin thing to do.
“They aren’t deep-frying fucking spiders, Malfoy!” shouted Ron. “Urgh...Harry, I’m so sorry, but I’ve got to go. I think you can handle this one by yourself, so I’ll just---I’ll just see you later.”
Hermione scoffed and tugged at a long lock of bushy hair, making it even more frizzy than usual. “Tell that to Ron. He’s already trying to wheedle me into it. He even forgot a protection spell when we were--well--last week, and I’m not sure it wasn’t on purpose.”
Malfoy’s expression did not change, but his ears slowly blossomed a bright pink. “I think not. It’s painful enough for me to carouse around with your pack of drunken monkeys; I wouldn’t subject him to such torture.”
Harry nodded as the conversation moved on, but he couldn’t stop his thoughts lingering on Malfoy. He wasn’t talking about walking in on him like it was nothing; to Harry, it was
...his mind was beginning to feel decidedly fuzzy. The rest of him was desperate for more. One of Malfoy’s enormous hands still held Harry’s wrists above his head, but the other slid between their two bodies. Finely manicured fingernails scraped gently at Harry’s waist, under his shirt, making him shiver. Heat trailed across Harry’s skin wherever Malfoy touched, the ache in his belly becoming unbearable, until the hand stroking his side unceremoniously cupped his groin.
charms on this cloak. Multiple protective charms, a whole suite of warming charms, even a few laundering charms to keep it fresh. It must have taken Malfoy hours.” Harry watched in horror as Hermione began to sniffle. “It’s...I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it’s really sweet.”
“I was walking by, and you rather looked as though you wished to be rescued.” He clapped one hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing it lightly. Harry gritted his teeth in annoyance, Surprisingly, he felt Malfoy tense up next to him.
Draco’s eyes had flared silver as he tensed at Harry’s alarm, but he quickly relaxed back onto Harry’s lap. “Most decent people don’t hang about in dark corners, that’s for
Cold grey eyes inexplicably smiled, becoming liquid and warm. “You’re different too, Potter. I suppose we’ve all changed."
“Well, there you go. I think you have your answer, Harry. But Ron and I will support you no matter what. You know that, don’t you?”
Apparently, it wasn’t difficult to become an expert on a subject no one else studied. By the time he returned to London a year or so later, Harry Potter had unwittingly become England’s resident expert on sentient houses. (Anyone else would probably have been pleased, but Harry was upset there wasn’t anyone else he could learn from.)
Right. Moving on. Second, Malfoy had somehow burned Smith without using his wand at all. Maybe he’d just become really good at wandless magic?
A shocked Harry nodded. Technically they weren’t really hurting anyone...but when had he eaten the whole damn thing? Had Malfoy really talked for that long? Had Harry really
if they were printing these sorts of stories. When Potter’s tale ended, he began another, this one about dragon fang smugglers and a misplaced toe. To his great surprise, Draco’s boredom eased as Potter regaled him with stories about his latest exposé. It wasn’t until his second story had ended that Draco noticed their food had vanished, the check was waiting patiently on the table, and the server was waiting impatiently near the bar. Where had the time gone?
A grumbling Harry found the iron gates to Malfoy Manor waiting at the end of a winding country lane, tucked behind a lush green hedge. They weren’t latched and gave at his slightest touch.
Regrettably, Malfoy was pants at baking. He confused the salt for the sugar not once but thrice and attempted to put the biscuits in the oven in one giant ball.
Draco frowned and stepped closer, crowding into Harry’s personal space. “Having friends doesn’t mean you have to touch them, or they you. I simply don’t wish to share you with anyone else. I don’t think that’s too much to ask of my
Scorp is of course invited; I’m curious to see what he’s like, and what you're like as a dad. I’ll meet you in the park across from Grimmauld Place at four o’clock Saturday, all right?
Malfoy seemed mollified by Harry’s hasty compliment, and they cleaned up together in silence while the biscuits baked. (Honestly, Harry did most of the cleaning. Malfoy located the washing-up liquid, which Harry grudgingly acknowledged as helping, and pointed out errant crumbs on the counter, which he did not.)
Draco turned and held out one stiff hand. “Congratulations, Potter, this evening was not as torturous as I had anticipated. Owl me the time for our next rendezvous, and I’ll pencil you in. Good night.”
Yes, Draco Malfoy had been a right prat back in school. But the man Harry had seen today had been curious and excited, anxious for Harry’s approval. And
Okay, let's talk about the Slytherin common room. JKR didn't include the lake view in the book, but it's included in other descriptions she's written (see the house quiz). So, either Harry is an unobservant donk (likely), or JKR realized she did the Slytherins dirty with her lackluster description (equally likely). Whatever, I'm going with it because I like it. Enjoy!
Harry flushed. He’d said that so conversationally, almost the way friends spoke to each other, and Harry was only further confused. “I don’t. Speak it, that is. Fleur--er, Bill Weasley’s wife--just slips into it every once in a while. I know a few words, that’s all.”
There it was. What a prickly, sexy bastard. It was just like Draco to coax Harry into submission, to think he was about to be buttered up, and then to sting him with a barb about his ego. This would probably have infuriated Harry at any other time, but he was far too aroused to make room for any other emotion.
“Gardenias,” Malfoy announced with a pleased sniff. He started to say more, but at that moment, one of the glass-paned walls began to tremble. It split and retracted into a million dazzling pieces and reformed into an opaque glass door.
“Wow,” Harry breathed. “I’ve never even heard of anything like that. I wonder if he’d let me study the house?”
Draco scoffed and flicked one delicate hand into a very rude gesture. "Don't be daft, of course we are, it's like the artist formerly known as Prince. Anyway--"
Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly. Anyone else would have gawked, or babbled, but the Malfoy mask was impeccably intact.  “Indeed. Well, wonders never cease. Did she also tell you how it all began?”
Despite his confusion, Harry was still angry. (It felt rather like fifth year all over again.) “Malfoy. Come to stick your tongue down my throat again, then?”
Harry sat up. He hadn’t made that last sound. An intimidating eagle owl had dropped a heavy, fluted glass vase next to his head. Overwhelmingly heady scents wafted from the coal black lilies and twining white flowers within. A rolled scroll was attached to the nodding head of the largest lily.
Something silvery shimmered in the corner of his eye. Harry scowled. Of course the dragon bracelet was back. Even seven years later, no matter how often Harry tried sending it back to the Malfoys, it reappeared. Hiding it in cupboards or wedging it under his mattress didn’t work; it always dug itself out, sparkly as ever, as if it wanted to be noticed. (Six minutes was the current record.) Harry had gotten lazy and had tried to owl it this time, but the tawny owl had returned, confused and empty-taloned, after the bracelet had presumably vanished halfway through its flight. He’d even drop-kicked it over the bloody gate of Malfoy Manor once, but of course the bloody thing had been waiting for him on his dresser, shiny and perfect as ever, by the time he got home.
“Alright, mate?” Ron asked, nudging his shoulder and shaking Harry out of his reverie. He and Hermione had made up to the point where they could sit on either side of Harry again, even if they still weren’t speaking.
Hermione chuckled and batted him over the head with the sock she was knitting. “Ronald, don’t act so surprised. You were the one flouncing around in that flashy cloak and eating the leftover macarons, you knew this was a possibility.”
Hermione shook her head insistently. “Harry, I’m serious. There are plenty of legends about their family. Dragons are on their family crest, which they’ve used for centuries. ‘Draco’ is a family name for a reason. Think about it, normal wizards don’t spit sparks or have markings around their eyes. Do you remember how Seamus and Eloise came into their creature inheritances this year? I think Malfoy did too.”
No response, except the man holding Harry even tighter. But as the song ended, he finally spoke. “Fancy meeting you here, Potter.” The posh tone was vexingly familiar.
Unfortunately, Harry’s slight pleasure was quashed when the third letter arrived. It was the most sickly sweet letter Harry had ever read in his life.
“Right,” Harry said slowly, before he realized he was nose-to-nose with his strikingly handsome old enemy. He cleared his throat and stepped away. “Well, er, your home is a lot more active than most. And I’ve seen my fair share. If it’s alright with you, I’d like to return to study it further. How about Friday?”
Ron saw Harry’s face pale drastically and elbowed Dean sharply in the side. Dean understood and hurriedly asked, “But Headmistress, the two of them? I mean, it’s Potter and Malfoy...you know what they’re like.”
“But we’re not prefects,” was of course the dumb response that fell out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop it.
hard not to come when Draco moved down his body and undid his trousers with his teeth. He looked up at Harry with challenging eyes as he slid the zipper down with his tongue.
The biscuits they’d made together had followed them through the door and arranged themselves in pretty heaps on a tiered tray. Wedges of perfectly ripe peaches bobbed in a luxuriant tray of sugared cream, and a warm teapot smelled deliciously fragrant.
Harry huffed in disappointment. “Well, that theory’s shot.” He tore his eyes away from the Slytherin table to top off his glass of pumpkin juice, and a memory flashed into his head. “Wait! What about the, you know, the creature thing you were talking about when we first returned? Maybe he’s got a snake inheritance or something?”
“Oh!” Apparently they hadn’t been alone after all. Harry’s head whirled around to notice Hermione reclining in the window seat, admiring the snow falling thickly onto the Hogwarts grounds. At least, she had been, until the two of them bumbled in and started necking. He laughed nervously. “Er, I was getting around to that. Happy Christmas, ‘Mione.”
Draco gasped as Harry flipped their positions, pushing Draco against the wall and grinding their hips together.
Harry grinned as he sat down at their usual booth. “Hey Ron, ‘Mione. How’s your new initiative going?”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Thanks. Not sure how many people come for yarn and how many come for me, but I like running the store.” He paused, an awkward bubble swelling between them. “I’m sure yours will do well. You’re always so well-dressed, people like that.”
“Yeah...er, how many more days of this are there again? These just keep getting bigger and more expensive. I’m a bit worried he’s going to try to give me an actual dragon,” Harry said, fishing around in the bag and finally locating an ornate golden stand. He desperately hoped it wasn’t actual gold, but inside he knew better.
, or I will not hesitate to remove it for you.” Malfoy’s voice was harsh and low, practically a snarl.
, Draco!” Harry yelled as he finally reached his peak. Blinding stars streaked across his mind, leaving only the palest remnants of stardust in his thoroughly sated body.  Draco’s thrusts became erratic and jerky before he cried out a moment later, something wordless and feral. He pulled out of Harry quietly, sank back against his many pillows, and cast a wandless cleaning charm over them both with the flick of one precise wrist. Harry rolled over and gathered his lover close, covering them in rumpled linen sheets.
Harry dreamt about Malfoy almost every night now. They weren’t anything extraordinary; nothing like the dreams of choking on Fiendfyre and sooty, grasping arms that had haunted Harry shortly after the war. No, these dreams were horribly, wonderfully mundane: picking out quills at Scrivenshaft’s, or eating bacon butties and bickering about Quidditch.
Draco frowned. “I don’t know who they are. I feel them, but it’s terribly faint. The more I focus on it, the more I fear it will disappear. I do know that they were thinking of Hogwarts…” His eyes cleared, and he laid one hand on hers. “Mother. I know that this was not our intention, but I have to return. I have to find them.”
Hermione smiled ruefully. “No. They’re dragons.” She splayed out the large book in front of them, pointing to faded illustrations of a blond woman and an imposing black dragon standing beside each other. Age had yellowed and faded the parchment, but Harry could still see the obvious care with which they regarded each other. A village wreathed in flame was on the facing page. The Malfoy crest was embossed in the corner of the parchment.
And of course the cherry on top of Harry’s realizations was that he was again becoming unhealthily obsessed with Draco Malfoy. He furtively peeked out his shop window to catch glimpses of white-blond hair, started every time the bell over his door dinged, and combed the papers frantically for any news of his old rival. Perhaps Harry’s schoolboy obsession with Malfoy had never died, but his fixation was now worse than ever.
“I love myself, I want to see it…” Pansy began. Her performance of “S.L.U.T.” was absolutely dazzling, if she dared say so herself. She sashayed back to her seat and slammed a shot of soju.
not straight. He had always rather swanned about Hogwarts, all swishing robes and expensive loafers. Harry knew that to be no indication of sexual preference. But he also knew that no heterosexual man kissed another man as Malfoy had kissed him, like a starving man gifted a sumptuous feast. Like a dying man with a thirst impossible to slake. And Harry had felt the evidence of the other boy’s enjoyment pressed thick against his hip bone. Merlin, Malfoy was so broad and tall now. Harry’s cheeks grew warm as he wondered if Malfoy’s prick was really as big as it had felt. He imagined dropping to his knees before Malfoy as a large hand pet his hair approvingly, and ever so slowly unzipping his trousers to reveal the warm flesh beneath...Merlin, the thought alone made slick heat pool in his belly.
Something small and metallic on a small pedestal started to vibrate so violently that it fell to the ground with a metallic clatter. Vines uprooted themselves from the ground and offered a sharp pair of gardening shears to the two men.
“Good,” Harry beamed and took Malfoy’s hand. “You definitely don’t make me happy either. Not the way you laugh or those pretty lips or even your fetching new haircut.”
all the time, everyone’s, I dunno, friendly neighborhood saviour, and you can just be yourself. I might envy that a bit.”
“Harry, are you alright? You look a bit strange,” Hermione asked, looking him over with obvious concern. Harry grimaced; he’d tried to glamour the marks on his neck, but he knew his concealment charms weren’t quite up to snuff.
“Pardon? You know how to bake?” Malfoy asked, staring at Harry as though he’d just asked him to chug poison or drop by Azkaban for a gala.
It was definitely time to leave, though. Harry paid their tab, tugged a lolling Draco out of the booth, and looped his arm around to drag his boyfriend back to Hogwarts.
Harry was so tired of being confused. He knew he had to make a choice sooner rather than later, knew he couldn't continue to hold Malfoy's heart in his dithering hands. But he'd done enough thinking, and it wasn't getting him anywhere.
Malfoy scoffed. “Call it extra credit, Potter. Besides, honeysuckle is already a vine, so it was half-done already. Bend down a bit, if you will.”
“Did you have enough to eat? Are you sure you wouldn’t care for more? There’s a divine pate I don’t believe you sampled...” Draco said, rifling through the hamper and finally summoning a small glass jar to his hand.
"Brill. Bring Potter, yeah? I know Blaise is already bringing Hermione.” Parkinson turned to Malfoy, tipping his face up with one long lacquered finger. “And what about your mystery man, Draco? Would he condescend to join us and our motley crew?”
“Long, long ago, a beautiful witch dwelt in a village with her father,” Malfoy began. He wove a bizarre tale of dragons and fate and fire. It had a strange dreamlike quality that Harry tried to shake off, but he felt himself transfixed regardless.
Warm lips placed an open kiss on his neck. It was so tender compared to the filthy way the man rolled his hips against Harry’s.
bloody all right, Hermione! And,” Harry tried his best to whisper, he really did, “it doesn’t help that fucking
Harry watched in silence for a moment as Draco fussed with the feast spread out on the most opulent rug. His deft fingers fidgeted with the sandwiches, arranging trays of lusciously ripe fruit just so, until he heard Harry’s trainers scrape against the flagstones. “Harry! Come in,
“We haven’t much choice, I think,” Malfoy frowned. “I wonder if we’re anywhere near the end. Let’s go.” Together they walked through the door into a grey marble bathroom. Plush white carpet covered the marble floor, leading to a dais on which stood an invitingly large bathtub. Curling steam shimmered from the water’s warm surface, interrupted occasionally by clouds of bubbles or crimson rose petals. A bottle of champagne sweated in an ice bath beside the tub, accompanied by two sparkling crystal flutes. As Harry stared, a tray of chocolate-covered strawberries popped into existence and settled near the champagne. The air shimmered in the air over the strawberries, and he dreaded to think what embarrassing possibility might appear next.
Hermione glanced at him, crumpling her napkin nervously in her lap. “How long are you here this time, Harry? Until Christmas, maybe?”
“Leave out a few, okay? Judging by the ingredients, I think we’re supposed to bake something to move on.”
Hermione had sat back after reading the letter, her hands clasped together and an uncharacteristically dreamy look on her face. “Oh, the Dordogne...I’ve always wanted to go there.” Hermione mused, a wistful look in her eye. “Nice was lovely, but the
Yet there was one thing more surprising than Malfoy’s constant appearance in Harry’s presence: Harry had decided he rather liked being Draco Malfoy’s friend. Apparently Slytherin house, seemingly full of snobby purebloods bent on achieving greatness, also highly valued the trait of loyalty. Malfoy soon became a firm friend to Harry. He always had an extra quill if Harry needed one, and offered to help him study for Potions.
“Er, maybe later. We’re actually here on official business; the Ministry has received some complaints.” Harry flipped open his notebook, brow furrowed as he studied his scribbled notes. “Apparently you’re trying to sell a Class D non-food substance as food, deep-frying it, and serving it with a special sauce of which you won’t disclose the ingredients...yes, I think that’s it.” He snapped the notebook shut and dropped a steadying hand on Ron’s shoulder. (He had just noticed the large, lurid pictures on the menu board and was starting to hyperventilate.) “Care to explain?”
Draco groaned and reached for his wand, his hands slipping a bit on the smooth wood. With a clumsy wave, he opened the window just enough for the owl and the letter it carried to slip through. The little thing flapped its wings about a bit more than before (perhaps it didn’t like the lemon bath oil Draco had chosen, but he was not about to vanish the perfumed steam for the sake of a bird).
Draco pressed a soft kiss to the pulse point on Harry’s neck. Harry, rigid with nerves, nudged Draco’s face nearer his own and met his lips. They were irresistibly soft. Harry wondered idly if he’d used a charm of some kind, but only sighed as he found himself yielding more and more. They snogged until Harry was breathless and panting, Draco eventually pulling away.
Harry rather missed spending time with Malfoy. But he did not miss mind-boggling conversations about dragons or mates or fate. He would not admit that he wanted to kiss Malfoy again, but the warm press of his lips haunted Harry’s mind late at night.
,” he said, nodding genially at Harry and waiting for a response. As if they hadn’t been rivals for the last eight years at all. Harry was sufficiently thrown off his game to nod back.
Somehow, after only two weeks back at Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione had become too much to bear. They’d technically been together since May, but staying at the Burrow under Mrs. Weasley’s watchful eye kept everyone’s hands exactly where they ought to be (at least in Harry’s opinion). At Hogwarts, all bets were off.
“Shh. Don’t care.” Harry heard a slight cough, but decided it must have been a branch popping in the fireplace. He was too involved in pulling Draco close and breathing in the jasmine of his hair to mind.
“What if I’d like to be?” Potter asked, cocking his head to the side. He seemed calm, and genuinely interested in Draco’s answer. But Draco knew that it was years too late. He was a broken man, one who could not stand to be shattered again.
“And, I suppose I rather like having you around. Teasing you these last few weeks has been the most fun I’ve had in years.”
In the blink of an eye, Harry was laden with silk and leather and wool. Draco shoved him into a dressing room and told him to “change quickly, we’ve a lot to get through.”
Harry stalked further into the Forbidden Forest, where the scent of loam and decay hung heavy in the air and strange creatures skittered at the edges of his field of vision. He knew Draco was behind him only by the sleek sound of his shoes in the damp grass. He judged they had walked far enough when the din of the party was only faintly audible, carried on the spring breeze.
The Malfoy lands had been a point of pride for their family for centuries. Generations of Malfoys had fought and bled for their land, against wizards and Muggles alike. Acres of rolling Malfoy property surrounded their ancestral manor, but the true glory of the family began with its gardens. The sprawling gardens encircling the manor were adorned with rambling roses, daffodils, prim delphinium and phlox. Proper English flowers, in a proper English garden. The conservatory held anything but.
Once Ron had safely apparated away (presumably to the Leaky, to settle his nerves with a pint), Harry turned his attention back to Malfoy. Who was beginning to twitch slightly. “So, Malfoy...is this a real business? It’s not, like some kind of joke or prank or something?” Harry was praying he would say yes, would say
He waggled his eyebrows suggestively. “How did you know?” The tension broke, and Pansy couldn’t help giggling.
Malfoy wilted for a moment before he collected himself, sneering at Harry with even more vigor than before. “Potter, do you really not believe me? Do you really believe I would sink all this capital, all this time and effort, into any business enterprise for a prank?”
Even dawdling as he was, Harry soon arrived at his destination and stuffed the rest of his cone in his mouth. He tipped his head back to read the sign, shielding his eyes from the sun.
For wizarding families, the character of a home is even more pronounced. Something about all that magic soaking into the foundations makes odd things occur. When generations of a family have grown and loved and perished within its walls, a house may develop certain unexpected qualities. Namely, its own personality, entirely separate from that of its residents.
If Ron had noticed Harry’s slight stutter, he was kind enough not to mention it. “Nah, but it’s usually involved, isn’t it? Eventually.”
Harry nodded and followed Malfoy down a long hallway. The room they entered was part workroom, part fitting room. Harry looked down to see a lush silken carpet embracing his feet as he walked. Bolts of jewel-toned cloth lined the wall behind a stately work table, but Malfoy steered Harry toward an ornate mirror in the corner.
“I’d rather not. Good night, Potter,” Draco replied, pulling out his wand and preparing to Apparate.
Harry chuckled and stepped closer. “I’m dating you, though. Doesn’t really matter what anyone else thinks.”
. So I can measure you properly. Trousers too. No need to worry, it’s a private room. No one but me will see our Saviour’s abs.” From Malfoy’s mouth, it sounded less like a reassurance and more like a threat. But surely that was just Harry’s imagination.
“It’ll be okay, ‘Mione. Things can only get better, right? Cheers, Ron,” Harry said, taking a deep draught of his ale.
“I’m done,” Hermione quietly announced. “There’s nothing at all wrong with the letter. Shall we have a look?” She cast a quiet
?” Malfoy asked, glancing at Harry’s cold face with worried eyes. “The common room is ridiculously cacophonous right now, but we could always return to my room and cast a
Dusk had fallen when Harry finally emerged from his room. He scanned the eight year common room, wanting to avoid any curious eyes (especially grey ones), until he spotted his two best friends sitting beside the fireplace. Hermione sat primly in a large wing chair, which was worn with age but still irresistibly soft. Her knitting bag was at her side (it was constantly bulging with sharp little needles, which Harry always discovered by accidentally sitting on it). Her needles flashed in her hands as a long navy scarf inched its way into existence. Ron sat on a low velvet pouf at Hermione’s feet, his eyes crinkled with affection and good humor and his hands engaged in untangling a large skein of bulky, sunshine yellow yarn. The way he looked at her...Merlin, it almost made up for all the disgusting snuffling noises and uncomfortable bits of too-public affection that Harry had witnessed. Ron and Hermione were the very picture of contented domesticity, at least until Harry barged in.
“You’re almost ready for me to fuck that tight pink hole. Is that what you want?” Malfoy asked huskily, licking another long stripe. “If it is, I need you to ask.”
Yet one night, the dream was different. Harry came to himself in a walled garden. Sunlight spilled over crumbling stone walls and tripped over beds of carefully wrought flowers and vines. Harry followed the sound of a trickling fountain and found Malfoy waiting at the end of a long colonnade, drenched with climbing roses. He was dressed casually, broad shoulders stretching under rumpled white linen. His usually pallid skin was tanned, and he glowed with good humor and good health, though his eyes seemed too tranquil, too dim. He must have stayed in the garden for a long time.
These lilies I found online are essentially what I imagined. And yes, Draco made them himself. He's very proud of his proficiency in charms and loves any chance to show off.
He gripped his broom more tightly as Malfoy approached him. “Er, morning, Malfoy. Did you just call me your guy? Like, dude or mate? That’s what
Now, only a few days later, Harry half-wished he had gone to Malfoy Manor with Draco after all. He scowled at the winter storm rattling the common room windows and snuggled further into his woolly jumper. Christmas was supposed to be a jolly time, but this year, Hogwarts felt terribly empty. Usually it felt like home, like comfort and friendship and childhood all wrapped together. But this year the holidays were off somehow. Madam Pince was in a snit after discovering one too many damaged books, and the very air of the library felt harsh and toxic. Harsh winter storms had made the Quidditch pitch entirely unusable, the weather only clearing long enough to taunt Harry before it fouled again. Even Peeves seemed to be feeling low; he’d only abducted Mrs. Norris once, and the ridiculous outfit he’d dressed her in had none of his usual panache.
“Indeed,” Malfoy said, taking a dainty bite of an egg and cress sandwich. “Forgive me for asking, but what do you plan to do with yourself after Hogwarts, Potter? Other than becoming the heartthrob of the entire wizarding world. I’d imagine you have unlimited options.”
Harry nodded. “Come on, Draco, show me what you can do.” Draco laughed and began to enter Harry. His eyes fluttered closed as he pressed slowly in. He looked like an angel on earth, all moonlight hair and carefully crafted features. He was almost more beautiful when he didn’t talk, but Harry liked mouthy, biting, opinionated Draco the very best.
Malfoy gritted his teeth. “As difficult as that would be for me, I truly meant what I said. I just want you...Harry.”
Yes, Harry Potter is perfectly fine. Draco Malfoy, however, lives life on another level. And it drives Harry Potter mad. It's not Malfoy being gay that bothers Harry; he came out himself a few years ago.
of course I can’t share the ingredients with just anyone. And yes, deep-frying and salting any foodstuff can be a health hazard. But! It’s exactly what the Muggles do, and you’re not harassing them!”
Apparently the Sorting had finished while Harry had been brooding. Headmistress McGonagall cleared her throat loudly, and Harry wrenched his attention back to the front of the hall.
A week later, Draco was rather disappointed by the lackluster reception Spideys had received. Perhaps it was the location? The end of Diagon Alley was certainly less-traveled, but Draco knew that wouldn’t stop an eager diner. And, well, it was rather too late to switch locations now.
Much to Harry’s surprise (and Hermione’s obvious dismay), Malfoy was the only one who raised his hand. “It traditionally means purity, enlightenment, or rebirth,” he said.
How dare Malfoy move onto his street and date perfectly nice gits and swan about like a bloody faerie prince?! Malfoy was so annoying and cared too much about his hair. It was probably good that Harry was a bottom too; he didn’t want to date Malfoy, or anyone else, anyway. Entirely out of the question.
Yay we're back! Can you tell how much I like writing from Draco's perspective? Time to whip out all the ten-dollar vocab words.
“That makes sense. You’ve been at each other's throats for seven years, it’s only natural to fall into learned patterns of behavior. But you said he’s changed. How do you feel about the new Malfoy, the one you got to know this year?”
A smile broke through the mask of restraint that was his mother’s face. “What wonderful news, Draco. I had thought it possible for your magic to repress its mating instinct due to stress, but I did not want to give you false hope. I am relieved to have been correct. Who is she?”
“It reminded me too much of the war, and I didn’t want that for the rest of my life. So I started doing investigative reporting for
“Of you, Scarhead? Never.” Malfoy selected a broom and kicked off into the air, zipping to the goalpost and back. Every line of his body was bent on flight, and he laughed wildly as he flew.
Harry shook his head. “No, not this year. Hogwarts is my home, I want to spend one last Christmas here.”
“Are you sure you wouldn’t care to come with me? It’s not too late to change your mind,” Draco asked, coolly handsome even in his silly fur hat.
“It was all wonderful! I never even knew Muggles collected and studied such wonderful things!” Draco’s eyes were wide and excited, his hair tousled and askew. “Did you know, we only have the slightest idea of what dinosaurs looked like. For all we know, they might have had hair, or even feathers! Like that great big beast of a hippogriff…” he grumbled into his drink.
They followed the professor’s pointy red hat down a long hallway behind the stairs until they reached a painting of a dark-haired witch with limpid eyes. She perked up when she saw them, smiling gently from her perch on a stone bench before a pond of magenta and lavender blossoms. Harry immediately liked her very much.
But it was only neighborly to frequent Malfoy’s shop. Harry did need new robes, after all. Or he would eventually. So Harry owled requesting an appointment, and was promptly booked for the next day.
No one had ever mentioned sentient houses to Harry Potter until his eighth year at Hogwarts. He always thought he’d only imagined Grimmauld Place growing more damp and dark with each visit, or the Burrow’s teetering stories multiplying every few years. To learn otherwise...well, Harry was hooked. Unfortunately, the topic was only a footnote to a throwaway remark in a long Charms lecture. Flitwick was not at all prepared to answer Harry’s barrage of questions and even glanced to Hermione for help. His wrinkled brow began to sweat, and he conjured a blanket-sized paisley handkerchief to dab at it.
Harry began to grow concerned. “Malfoy, I don’t speak French,” Harry complained. “If you’re mad at me or got cursed or something, you have to tell me in English! Or we have to go find ‘Mione, but she doesn’t speak that much French either, I think she only knows how to order food--”
Three things seemed to happen simultaneously: Malfoy spat sizzling sparks at Smith’s hand, Smith cried out in pain, and Harry found himself whipped over Malfoy’s shoulder firefighter style as Malfoy
Ron Weasley turned faintly green, obviously wondering if Harry had actually seen Draco naked. He had no clue the lyrics were only about to get worse.
Harry was still thinking of Teddy and his someday family when he opened the fifth letter at breakfast the next day.
Malfoy nodded jerkily and stalked back toward the Slytherin table, glaring at everyone in his path. The crowd around Harry began to disperse.
Despite the awkward conversation they’d provoked, Harry was impossibly grateful that Draco had sent him those dress robes (though he’d never admit it to his face). For once, he rather liked what he saw as he dressed for the Yule Ball.
Ron scoffed. “What, that they’re poncy French gits? We already know that, ‘Mione. Bloody Malfoy won’t stop rubbing it in everyone’s faces, thinks he’s better than we are…” He trailed off, muttering darkly under his breath.
Malfoy sighed and readied his wand. “Of that I have no doubt. Unto the breach, then, Potter. I can guarantee the manor won’t harm us; other than that, I make no promises.”
When they were stuffed to the gills, they had broken into the mulled wine. Forty-five minutes of drinking later, Hermione was now waxing poetic on what seemed to be her new favorite topic: Ron and his many faults. Harry would usually shut her down, would usually try to defend his best mate, but she made quite a few good points. And she was on her third glass of wine, so it was rather hard to get a word in edgewise. Harry took another resigned swig of his drink and let Hermione ramble on.
“Have some porridge, Harry,” Hermione suggested, ladling a large dollop into a bowl and placing it before him. “Porridge always helps.” Harry grunted again and stuck a spoon in the thick porridge, but didn’t eat. He wasn’t hungry.
“Great. Well, thanks for the tea, Malfoy. And the tour.” Harry stood, gathered his things, and went to the door. Or, he would have, had the door still existed. Harry could have sworn they’d entered across from the fireplace, but there was now a large bookcase showing off an array of dusty old jewelry instead. A ruby scepter rattled, a gold-encrusted coronet edged closer to the end of its shelf, and a whopping diamond ring winked knowingly.
Draco was absolutely taking Harry apart, and Harry could feel himself becoming more undone with each thrust. Draco was all that he could feel; he was in him and around him and of him. Excruciating pleasure thrummed in Harry’s veins and made him come alive.
“I’ve never been to this kind of art museum before, you know,” Potter said as they strolled into the next room. This one was round, and filled with bits of metallic fabric hanging from the ceiling in concentric circles. The walls and ceiling were painted a deep blue, so dark it was almost black, and the lights were kept low, barely reflecting off the blue tiled floor.
For his own part, Harry was quite glad Malfoy had apologized. As irritating as Malfoy tended to be, he was right: they had been only children. Harry resolved to take Malfoy at his word and genuinely try to fulfill their truce. He was quite sure Ron and Hermione would never like Draco Malfoy, but they began giving him small nods and not berating his presence whenever he appeared.
“Actually, some wixen have debated that it was Harry’s natural charisma--” Luna began before Hermione cut her off.
“What--you--” Harry began, but then Malfoy literally swept him off his feet. At least, that was what it felt like. Harry felt like a leaf caught in a breeze as Malfoy guided them in a loose circle around the dance floor. Every place Malfoy touched him felt odd and tingly and warm, lovely and awful at the same time. How did he always smell so good? Malfoy sent him into a complicated twirl, and when Harry returned, they were both facing the other students. Malfoy’s arm settled around Harry’s waist again, and their hips kept brushing as they continued to dance. Harry was quite certain that Malfoy was showing off, but with trying not to trip over his own feet, he didn’t have enough concentration left to mind.
Harry nodded, and Draco Apparated them to his flat. He would’ve liked to look around some, but all he could see and feel was Draco. He steered them through a doorway, kissing and fumbling all the while, and up a few stairs before pressing Harry onto a four-poster bed.
Malfoy stood as well, holding out one hand pleadingly. “I apologized for kissing you without your consent. With your consent, that would be an entirely different matter.”
Part of Pansy was thrilled that her prickly best friend supported her lusting after a Weasley, but the rest wondered if he’d been cursed somehow. “Where did this Hufflepuff optimism come from? Are you absolutely sure you’re Draco Malfoy?”
Water (even the most luxuriously oiled and soaped bath water) is not among the best of lubricants. But Harry didn’t care. What a difference the touch of another made: Draco’s clever hands, the rocking of his thighs against Harry’s, that velvet-iron cock that thrust against Harry’s...everything was too perfect to handle. All was slippery and hot and Draco as Harry came in his lover’s arms. Bone-tired as he was, he flopped back onto his chest and rested there until they were both pruny, Draco rubbing his back all the while. Pink-cheeked and fragrant, they dressed and returned to the eighth year dormitory together.
“Like that, don’t you? Do you like my big cock up your arse, Harry?” He chuckled as Harry gasped and clenched around him. “You like it when I talk dirty, don’t you.”
ed to the floor as Draco struggled to sit up. Pain twisted and wracked his body as his bones lengthened and his muscles roiled. Innocuous scents he had long dismissed became impossible to ignore. His skin itched and burned as it stretched over the new contours of his body. Even his magical core writhed, deep within, as he became something strange and other. All he saw was shades of green and flame. Heat exploded around Draco’s eyes, and a strangled scream ripped from his throat. He lay sweating and burning on his bed, waiting for death.
So Harry slid on his tightest black jeans and a tank top that flaunted the glistening slide of his biceps. He knew what he had, and he knew how to show it off.
Hermione turned another page of the dusty tome she was perusing. “Yes, I think I will. It is our last year as students here, after all.”
Ron reached out one hand and pet the cloak too, cooing appreciatively “that’s quality, mate. And you are cold all the time, it’s kind of nice.” Rather than touching the cloak, Hermione was now waving her wand over it in increasingly complicated patterns.
Harry braced himself against a tree, still trying to catch his breath. The responsibilities of his life felt crushing. Schoolwork and friends and trying to explain where Draco had gone waited for him back at the castle, but he was in no hurry to return. All he could do was breathe and be.
He was unspeakably lovely. Each triangle of white skin that was revealed made Harry want to see more. Malfoy had such lovely long legs. He was just as lean and muscular as Harry had imagined, but he had one little pouch of belly that Harry longed to cup in his hands. His pale skin seemed to shimmer as he stepped into the tub, carefully gripping the side and barely rippling the water. With a sigh, he settled back against Harry’s chest. Yes, he was bony, but all of his sharp angles seemed to settle into the dips of Harry’s body as if they were made to fit together.
As the winter hols grew closer, Draco and Harry spent more and more time together. It felt so natural, just how it had been before the whole
, you feel good,” Draco moaned low as he pushed in all the way. “Of course the Golden Boy has a golden arse.” He waited for Harry to adjust to the intrusion, holding himself still with what seemed to be an iron will. When Harry nodded for him to continue, he started off with shallow rocking, before working his way up to full, effortlessly thorough thrusts. Harry moaned unabashedly as waves of pleasure hit him.
. He was fast, too. Harry tried to reach for his wand, but it was trapped in his tight jeans pocket. The school seemed to be empty, as all of its other residents hid from the bitter cold. No one was able to rescue Harry, but at least no one saw him being lugged about like a sack of potatoes.
Panic briefly overwhelmed him. “Bugger it all, how am I to find my mate if I can’t follow the pull?” Draco snapped. Desperation slowly filled his body, like a rising tide. After years of no feelings, he seemed to be having them all at once. It did not become a Malfoy at all.
“Oh, right. I guess the spectators couldn’t see much anyway. Well, in the Triwizard Tournament, I met them during the second task…”
A colorful advertisement caught Harry’s eye. If Draco had never tried something as simple as a sausage roll, what else hadn’t he been exposed to? “Draco? We can still go shopping today, as much as you want. But let’s do some other fun stuff, too, alright? Muggle stuff.”
Draco rolled his eyes but kept sucking, reaching up one hand to play with Harry’s balls. Harry gave in, and white heat roiled through his body as he came down Draco’s throat. He swallowed it all and pulled off with a slight pop, looking ridiculously smug.
Malfoy snarled, grey eyes popping unsettlingly. “It’s not as though I’m unaware of customer preferences! I did market research and tested the product with a select focus group. We offer a variety of sizes, and six different seasonings!” Malfoy ran a hand through his artfully coiffed hair and started cursing under his breath. “Fucking Golden Boy asks me if it’s a bloody
Draco’s jaw tightened. He looked like a madman, all disarrayed hair and white face, but his eyes were the clearest Harry had seen in a long time. “If you insist. Fine.” He turned on his heel and stalked away, muttering under his breath all the while.
Harry was so excited he thought he might puke. A romantic dinner awaited him, with the man of his (literal) dreams. Hopefully meeting his boyfriend wouldn’t always feel as stomach-churning as it did now, but he really couldn’t be sure.
Malfoy, looking somewhat dazed (the smile was sometimes a bit much), lifted one aristocratic eyebrow and looked back at Harry down his nose. “Pardon? I received a missive from the Ministry telling me about a magical theorist studying ancestral wizarding homes, but your name was not mentioned.”
“Not one for the big picture, that’s for sure,” Draco murmured to himself as he watched the next employee attempt to upsell the customer from a drink to a full combo meal. At least Marta had promise, even if that permanent smile did seem irritatingly glued on. The customers seemed to like her. The witch currently at the counter had even gotten past the spider bit without running for the hills. She did still look a bit squeamish, though.
Draco smiled. “See, that is far more entertaining than how the Weasley clan has been multiplying. What sort of stories are you working on now?”
“How fascinating. Our Saviour is a man of many talents. I would love to learn more about those, Potter.” Weirdly enough, Malfoy didn’t sound sarcastic at all. Maybe he’d been cursed. Whatever it was, Harry was determined to take advantage of it, if only to see what would happen next.
An awkward silence lingered between them, until Harry broke it. “Were you going flying too, then? Want to go together?” he asked gruffly, avoiding eye contact.
“You’ve been planning this all night, you chaotic bint,” Draco realized, an intrigued look on his face.
“Pleasure,” Harry grunted, shoving his hands firmly into his pockets. He disliked shaking hands, and that wasn’t about to change for Malfoy’s flavor of the week.
Harry rolled his eyes, but complied. It was such a small request to keep his temperamental dragon happy.
However, he somehow ended up doing none of those things. Harry visited Teddy, and let Molly cluck over how thin he was, and practically blew his eyebrows off product testing with Ron, but throughout it all Harry was thinking of only one thing: Draco Malfoy. And his house, of course. It was just returning to such an interesting and attractive
Neville’s blush had now spread all the way down his neck. He quickly grabbed the nearest book and hid his glowing face with it, not caring that he was reading
, more, yes,” was all that Harry could manage, but Draco seemed satisfied. He started thrusting even harder, snapping his hips into Harry at an earth-shattering rate. It was rough and exactly what he needed.
Harry whirled around so fast he nearly tripped on the polished tile floor. He could hear Draco cackling behind him, followed by other sounds. Shoes being kicked off, the metal tang of a zipper slowly pulled down, and a puddle of fabric hitting the floor. A small splash and a wanton moan.
Here Potter’s eyes became unbearably tender as he gazed straight at Draco. It was almost enough to make one believe in love again. But then Pansy banished that ridiculously Hufflepuff thought. How absurd.
“Oh,” Harry managed. An hesitant stroke made Draco shudder with delight. Merlin, he was sensitive. Harry added a twist at the end of the next one, and the man beside him thrust up, begging for more.
When Harry judged it safe to turn back around, Draco lounged at the far end of the cavernous tub, hair darkened to golden-blond by the water and toned body hidden tantalizingly beneath a layer of bubbles. Very fragile bubbles, ones that would disappear with nothing more than a breath…
“Ron, listen. Honestly, I think they’ll be disgustingly in love forever, or the whole thing will go down in flames. But we just have to let Harry make his own decisions. Don’t interfere, alright?”
“About Malfoy? I don’t know, Harry, but I suppose we can talk about it.” Hermione signed her name with a flourish at the bottom of an excessively long essay and finally gave Harry her full attention. “So. What do you want to do?”
Malfoy sighed dramatically and draped one arm across his long-suffering face. Theatrical bastard. “Pity. Do tell me if you change your mind.” He did look awfully nice in the afternoon sunlight (the man’s hair practically glowed, and surely it was illegal for robes to fit that well), but if that was what he wanted, there was no way Harry would give in so easily. Surely he would never seriously want to date another man anyway: Draco Malfoy was indubitably straight.
Ron, on the other hand, was not puking or mocking at all, but seemed somewhat mollified. “Least it’s not as corny as the last one,” he shrugged, eying a happy Hermione contemplatively.
Harry resolved not to ask about Hermione’s parents anymore: a crying Hermione was the only thing more terrifying than an angry one. "Anything would be better than last Christmas, right? But yeah, same here: I'm staying over too."
Now that his holiday plans were set, Harry was well and truly chuffed. He still didn’t really understand how dating worked (it seemed to be just like friendship, but with lots more hand-holding), but he figured he should at least inform Draco of his whereabouts over the winter hols.
Ron couldn’t seem to scrape together enough words for a reply, so Harry continued. “Yeah...I mean, it’s just dinner at Hogwarts, but I think he has something special in mind.”
Ron smacked the table hard, ratting the silverware horribly. Hermione winced. “Brace yourself, mate. So, the Malfoys were all acquitted at their trials, right? And the parents buggered straight off to France, but Malfoy’s just been camped out in the manor ever since, keeping things running and redoing the place. So he’s just trying to get back to normal life, right? But, get this: at a party he had last month, someone was rude to Malfoy so the house launched him out a window!”
Lost as he was in thought, it took Harry a moment to notice another blond was now invading his personal space. Zacharias Smith was now stooping over the two boys, one hand leaned against the stone wall beside Harry’s head. “‘Lo, Potter. I’m here to steal you away from the big bad Slytherin,” he taunted, tossing a wash of dirty blond hair out of his eyes.
Harry worried his bottom lip between his teeth. “It’s quite the story. Er...assuming that you’re right and I am your mate, what happens if I reject you? What if I don’t want to be your mate?”
Draco stalked down the grand staircase and into the manor’s conservatory, his dressing gown billowing about him. He strode past the belladonna and took a right at the black lilies to find the center of the botanical maze. He would have usually stopped to admire the graceful, delicate lines of each stand of flowers, but he had neither the time nor the inclination to do so today. Narcissa Malfoy was waiting for him, resting with perfect posture at a glass table laid with all of her son’s favorites. She had grown more relaxed and less wan since the war; now she looked patrician rather than pinched. Robin’s egg blue robes swished about her as she rose to embrace her son.
Steam billowed through the chilly morning air at the Hogsmeade train station. Students chattered as they hustled aboard the train, swapping last-minute treats or owl post addresses before they left for the holidays. The cold nipped and tore at Harry’s exposed face, but the hand Draco held against his chest was warm.
“Not my fault your pajamas have too many buttons. Nothing wrong with a tee.” Harry shoved the pajama sleeves up to his elbows and clambered into bed. He arranged himself around his boyfriend’s body and curled up so he could sleep in the crook of Draco’s neck, his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Oi! Glad you two finally decided to show up. Get caught up in adjusting your cufflinks, did you?” Ron grinned, punching Harry’s shoulder in a friendly way. The charcoal gray dress robes he wore looked much better than his previous horribly lacy set, but Harry figured Ron would always look vaguely uncomfortable in fancy clothes.
Harry still didn’t quite understand why he’d fled from Malfoy again, but he didn’t allow himself to think about it. Time passed slowly. Harry had time to knit a long cashmere scarf in palest grey, a jumper for Hermione, and several jewel-toned dragons for a shop display. Really, it was only a week or two, but he had a lot of frustration to work through. Knitting helped.
“Er, thanks, Malfoy,” Harry said, nudging Ron out of the way. “You’re probably right. See you in class.” Malfoy bowed briefly before striding back to the Slytherin table and a gawking Goyle.
You are no doubt wondering why you are the one chosen to receive this piece of electronic mail. It is only natural to wonder; we haven’t spoken in years, and I am blessed with the widest and most dazzling circle of acquaintances the wizarding world has ever seen. However, you are the only person with whom I am acquainted who could reasonably possess an electronic mailbox.
Harry was so entranced by Draco’s pert and perfect cheeks that he barely heard him call out, “Now, come and eat something. Have you ever had prosciutto with melon? It’s delightful, you’ll love it...”
Entering Luxe was different from what Harry had anticipated. He had expected heavy dark wood and swathes of thick velvet, but the interior of Malfoy’s shop was charmingly modern. It felt like a breath of fresh air, done up as it was in shades of cream and grey. Modern art in muted tones shifted and danced on the walls, and the interior smelled pleasantly of cedar and lavender.
Harry wilted onto the bed behind him. “So that wasn’t just some pureblood thing? Or a spell gone wrong?”
Harry Potter is perfectly able to take care of himself, thanks ever so. He eats what he needs to power his body, and rarely a chocolate frog more, despite Mrs. Weasley’s coaxing. Harry sleeps fitfully, but sufficiently, and exercises regularly. He orders Kreacher to clean Grimmauld Place, which the house elf mostly does, albeit with grousing and grinding of teeth. Harry tries not to snap at the customers in his store who are there just to buy yarn from
“Ugh, he really loves silk. I bet he even buys silk pants,” Harry muttered to himself, holding up the robes to himself in the long mirror.
“Ron learned one word from hearing you say it, Harry. Malfoy would have to have done the same, and you’re the only Parselmouth we currently know of.”
“No?” Potter asked, shooting him a quick grin. “Come stand here in the middle and look up. Yes, right on the circle. Now, what do you see?” Draco allowed Potter to prod him into position and gazed up as instructed. He stared for a moment, not recognizing what the thin lines of silver and gold were meant to be. After a moment, it clicked. Draco realized he was staring up at a rendering of the night sky. Each piece of fabric that had seemed so whimsically arranged coalesced to form the stars and constellations of the northern hemisphere. He located Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Hercules, and even the constellation after which he was named. It was surprisingly lovely.
“Who even carries a bloody handkerchief these days?” Harry muttered to himself. He got to his feet and grabbed his broom, ready to go fly laps around the Quidditch pitch. Flying was just about the only thing these days that would get Malfoy out of his mind, so he intended to do a lot of it. Unfortunately, a familiarly pointy face chose that very moment to peek around the corner of the broom shed. Malfoy sauntered toward Harry, hands in his designer pockets, as though he had all the time in the world.
His nerves only intensified as Harry tripped out the portrait hole, practically fell off one of the moving staircases, and skidded to a halt in front of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. He paced three times in the corridor, and the Room of Requirement revealed itself. Harry pushed open the heavy door to see that instead of the usual golden candlelight, shades of dappled green drenched the room. He glanced beyond the various sofas and poufs and saw the far wall had become an enormous pane of glass holding back the icy waters of the lake. A copy of it, anyway: the Room of Requirement was on the seventh floor, after all.
That sounded much more like the relationship Potter and Draco usually had, Pansy thought with a smirk. They’d always been obsessed with each other, so it rather did make sense for Potter to be Draco’s new mystery boyfriend.
Malfoy rose to his feet slowly as Harry backed toward the door. He observed Malfoy from a safe distance, taking in how the usually polished boy seemed wild and wrecked. Heaving chest. Bruised, swollen red lips. Shirt open at the neck, showing the creamy skin beneath. Luminous silver eyes stared at him in abject longing. As if he were the only other being in all the world, and Harry was tempted to turn back. But beneath that longing was a raging, hungry fire, one that threatened to consume him until there was nothing left. Fear and uncertainty clogged Harry’s throat, his heart pounded, and it was impossible to breathe. He couldn’t stay there any longer. He spun on his heel and stumbled back to his dorm as fast as his legs could take him.
Harry threw open the door and breezed in, broomstick thrown jauntily over one shoulder. “Hi Ron, it’s bloody freezing out--oh, hi, ‘Mione. Are you already all packed then?”
“‘M fine,” Harry grunted, not breaking his surly stare at the Slytherin table. “It’s just weird that Draco’s not around. It’s odd, right?”
Malfoy gasped theatrically, and the delicate silver spoon in his hand fell to the saucer below with a dramatic tinkle. “I would never presume--what are you implying--”
“Don’t lie to me, Potter. I know that you can’t stop thinking about it. Perhaps we should do something about that. ‘The very essence of romance is uncertainty,’ is it not?”
Everything seemed peaceful the following day. No Potters storming through his door and no fluffy, grumpy owls clattering at the window. But when Draco left the shop the following night, Potter was waiting for him under the streetlight across the way. He was swathed in such a heavy cloak that he seemed more wool than man. Despite the thick cloth, Draco picked up the familiar scent of his mate.
Harry practically shrieked. He was pretty sure Ron hadn’t just propositioned him, but that’s certainly what it had sounded like.
Harry snickered. “Nah, nobody would want to eat spiders. But we received an official complaint, so we have to check it out. Come on, let’s get this over with.” He straightened his crimson Auror robes and reached for the door handle.
with Malfoy. Then again, for all he knew, Malfoy created such tight-fitting robes that he did have to measure his clients’ cocks. No, that was absurd.
Harry finally opened his eyes, blinking at the worried eyes above him. A crowd had gathered, but the eye’s closest to him were Malfoy’s. Perfectly normal grey eyes, that were definitely not dazzling silver. “Er, what? Malfoy? M’fine, but why’re you over here?”
Malfoy, who had gone stark white at the sigh of the butter, nodded. He reached for the nearest cupboard and started taking out bowls while Harry searched for another exit. By the time Malfoy had extracted about twenty large mixing bowls, Harry had given up.
“What the fuck,” he muttered. “I don’t even own purple parchment, much less anything vanilla-scented.”
(Photo description: Harry is doing bicep curls in front of a mirror at the gym and staring at the mirror with smoldering eyes. His arms are about as big around as Draco’s head, and his shoulder-to-waist ratio is insane. Everything not encased in tight leggings is bronzed and buff and gleaming. Draco moans a bit just looking at it.)
tray. “Oh look, you finished the whole spidey! I’m thrilled. It’s perfectly safe to eat, I’m sure I don't know what all the fuss was about. We’ll be allowed to stay open then, yes?”
Harry rolled his eyes and stalked over to the brooms, selecting a vintage Firebolt. He kicked off the ground and hovered in the air.
“Oh, nothing really. Maintaining our family businesses, avoiding the press and certain unsavory suitors, a bit of redecorating…the hedge maze in particular required severe restoration.” Malfoy seemed very pleased to have been asked about himself and was clearly warming to his topic, but he was interrupted by a large portrait of a ship falling from the wall.
Ron nodded, reached past Parkinson to scoop up the tidy file, and collided with the doorjamb on his way out the door. He straightened up and tried again, making it successfully out the door and doing his best to ignore the giggling behind him. Once he was safely back in his office, he threw the file on the desk and inspected the soup stain from earlier. Dammit, he still smelled of cream of broccoli. He’d have to change before tonight.
“I remember. It’s the lake outside, right? I wonder where the squid is...are the merpeople in here real? They didn’t like me much before.” Long, shimmering tails undulated in the distant depths of the lake, barely grazing the expanse of kelp below.
“I believe it would be best for me to walk you out, Potter. Let’s be on our way before the manor has another brilliant idea.”
He turned to face Draco. Even in the velvet half-darkness of the forest, he stood broad and tall. His features were clearly visible in the moonlight, radiating bewilderment.
Draco thoughtfully cocked his head to the side. “I suppose it would be entertaining to be a tourist for a day. A
"All right then." Harry shared the meandering tale of how he’d come to study sentient houses. He had intended to share a summarized version, but Malfoy was a surprisingly good listener, laughing or gasping in all the right places. Unfortunately, Harry eventually came to the end.
I meant every word. I really have fancied you for years, even if it took me ages to realize it. You’re still as sharp as you always were, but now you’re trying to make me laugh and caring about what I think. You’ve raised your son beautifully; he’s lovely, and you are so tender with him. And your legs are fantastic. Won’t you give me a chance?
Instead of responding with some snooty barb, Malfoy smiled cordially and poured them each a cup of tea. “Since you find it so imperative to ask after the help, Bitsy is unusually shy. Requiring her to answer the door would result in the need for a lengthy lie-down each time, which would drastically decrease my supply of baked goods. One can’t have that.” His mouth quirked up at the corners just before he took a miniscule sip of tea. Harry blinked in disbelief. Had Malfoy just tried to make a joke?
“You look absolutely knackered, Potter. Is this not the kind of thing one usually does when studying sentient homes?” Malfoy asked, pouring them each a cup of tea. He’d remembered how Harry liked it, and he gulped down his tea gratefully.
Harry stuffed the map back into his trunk and threw all his other belongings back on top. He toyed with the idea of conjuring something satisfyingly delicate to break, but settled for kicking the post of his four-poster bed until his foot hurt too much to continue. Draco was just doing this to get his attention; he’d come back eventually and start vying for Harry’s attention again. In all the worst ways, of course.
Harry coughed as he tumbled through the Floo into Ron and Hermione’s sitting room. The ash always caught in his throat and his knees seemed bent on making a graceful landing impossible. He brushed the soot from his jeans and glanced around. The sconces on the wall were lit and Crookshanks blinked grumpily at him from his cat tree, but his friends didn’t seem to be anywhere.
Here’s another joke for you, since your son liked the last one so much. When does a joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent.
Hiding his horror beneath a mask of idleness, Draco glanced in the Gryffindork direction. Granger’s bushy braid, Weasley’s unsightly red mop, Potter’s halcyon of seemingly untameable hair… Well, at least someone had gone out and bought him clothes that fit for once. Horrible Muggle jeans, but still. Potter had been such an eyesore in previous years that Draco had never noticed what a nice arse he had. And...were those muscles straining at the seams of his tight sweater as he waved one hand about, gesturing at Finnegan? Had Potter always had those?
fine--” Unfortunately, just as the front door closed behind Harry, it disappeared from existence. So did all the other doors Harry could see, each fading into the wall one after another. Only one solid gold door, carved with ominous sigils, remained.
It started small: the two of them holding hands as they walked to class, or Hermione throwing her legs over Ron’s lap as they chatted in the eighth year common room. Ron would “help” Hermione find books in the library, before they returned twenty minutes later with red faces and suspiciously mussed hair. They once disappeared to Hogsmeade for an entire day, coming back with swollen lips and a sack of sweets from Honeydukes to compensate for their absence. As happy as Harry was for his best friends, he was growing very tired of Ron’s silencing charms failing. Nobody wanted to hear that many smacking and licking sounds from the bed next to theirs. And after Hermione had groped his leg by mistake right in the middle of Charms, Harry decided to switch seats. Permanently.
“Indeed,” Malfoy hummed sleepily. “Pass me a strawberry, will you? Since the manor went to all this trouble.” Harry took a chocolate-covered strawberry and held it to Malfoy’s parted lips. He bit into it with a satisfied sigh, one that Harry longed to hear again. Juice trickled down Harry’s hand, and he licked it off, chasing each drop. He swirled his hand in the water to disperse the stickiness and stroked Malfoy’s thigh along the way. Accidentally, of course.
Harry began to realize that he was not, in fact, very good at taking care of himself. He shouldn’t be eating beans on toast five times a week and running ten kilometers every night. Most people didn’t avoid relationships with the terror that he did, preferring covert encounters with strangers in bar bathrooms. Panic attacks haunted his days, and nightmares his nights. The countless hours he spent working out were a form of self-punishment, rather than self-care. He was not happy.
, Draco. You and me, we’re still such a new thing, and you know how important Hermione is to me. If we’re still together next year, I’ll spend Christmas with you then, alright?”
Dean Thomas was next, with a respectable rendition of “Bust a Move”. When had he learned to twerk? But then Granger derailed everything, staring directly at Blaise as she warbled something about kisses and hiking. Ugh. Pansy had counted on Blaise to get the evening back on track, but no, he had to perform “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” for Granger. She hoped the original singer was rolling in his grave. It had been a colossal mistake to show Blaise 10 Things I Hate About You last week, he was barely a Slytherin anymore.
Perhaps this was his opportunity to ask Potter about his reasons for the boon he’d requested? No, Draco needed to lull him into a sense of security first. “Something borderline engaging...ah. Why aren’t you an Auror, one of the wizarding world’s jackbooted elite? I remember you were terribly invested in the idea a few years ago,” Draco drawled.
“No, Harry,” Hermione explained. “Malfoy’s a dragon. According to their family lore, each dragon has a fated mate. And it’s you.”
Malfoy smirked and laid his gardenias carefully on the floor. “For once, I have the advantage over you, Potter. The location is incorrect, but this is a room that actually exists in Malfoy Manor: the old ballroom.”
“Owl when you’re ready for me, Potter. I’m very busy, but I’m sure I could fit you in.” Malfoy looked Harry up and down before smiling wickedly and pulling Rod after him back into Luxe. Harry huffed and strode back across the street. He waited until he’d returned inside to kick something, just in case Malfoy was watching.
When the leg was satisfied that Harry was exactly where he ought to be, it disappeared behind the door again. Harry shivered with anticipation, ready for whatever was to come next. He loosened his shirt collar; surely it was warmer than it had been a few minutes ago.
If asked later, Harry could never have said how long the two of them strolled together. Time seemed to melt into nothingness, marked only by measured steps and the crinkles around Draco’s eyes when he laughed. Harry still felt rather dreamy and drifting by the time he made it back inside. It was time for dinner, but he wanted to warm himself by the fire and talk to his best friends first.
Harry groaned loudly and reached for the large white box that had been delivered with the letter. He untied the dark green velvet bow and lifted the lid to reveal a sea of soft blue. Something that would keep him warm...was it a cloak? He pulled it from the box and held it before him, fingering the elegant silver fastening as he did so. The deep blue fabric of the cloak slid through his hands as easily as water, but the hand touching it was tangibly warmer.
Now Draco’s eyes became serious, his hands tightening on Harry’s waist. “What if we don’t do anything? What if I just want to spend more time with you before my departure?”
“They? Hmm.” Narcissa pursed her lips, the rest of her face remaining still and solemn. “Yes, I know how you must feel. But it will be challenging for you to resume your education after the...choices our family made during the war. And the more time you spend around your mate without completing the bond, the more instinctual and volatile you will become. More like a true dragon every day,
Hermione lay back on the couch, rubbing her eyes. Even as drunk as he was, Harry could see that she was seriously troubled. “No clue. But I think having a family is what Ron wants to do with his life, so he very much sees that as the next step. And I don’t.”
This thought made Harry unexpectedly sad. He hadn’t wished for a relationship or anything, but being kicked out while they were still panting and pliant hurt his heart. He nodded jerkily and rolled out of bed, quickly sliding on his jeans and searching for his boots.
Harry huffed in frustration and watched his warm breath turn to frost in the air before him. Of course Malfoy had to come and complicate everything again, just when Harry had thought he’d had a normal year. And of course he had to be a pushy, insatiable dragon, insisting on mating with the most touch-starved and socially awkward orphan at Hogwarts.
Yes, I knew that Muggles have libraries. I didn’t go very often as a kid, but I always liked how quiet they were. And the librarians always shushed my cousin. That’s why we stopped going, but still.
Harry, torn as he was between an exasperated sigh and a laugh, expressed himself with another sharp thrust. "Of course you did. Well, you do know
Draco’s irritation faltered. Did Potter know the gravity of what he asked? Life debts were ancient and powerful magic. Draco knew he would have no choice but to accept Potter’s request, even if it were for his hand in marriage or his vast fortune or his own death.
Draco rolled his eyes and pinched Harry, making him yelp. “I like you any way in my bed, but I am relieved that our preferences are so compatible.”
I could take you shopping for a mobile if you like. What if you bought the wrong kind? I think you need a guide. We could eat at mine after. I’m not much of a cook, but there’s a great Indian takeaway nearby.
They continued turning in very small circles. Harry tried to follow the wall back to the other students, but he was a bit distracted. Malfoy’s white blond hair flashed bright in the afternoon sun, stealing Harry’s attention as he spun Parkinson in wide circles about the room. Rather than the stilted steps the other students were making, each of Malfoy’s movements were strong and sure. He was all grace and beauty, somehow making even Parkinson look good. As he waltzed about the room, Harry thought that he looked happy.
Harry was still stewing while closing up one night when the bell at the door chimed. “Sorry, we’re closed,” he called out.
Draco was majestic, all lithe and lean in clothes that surely cost more than most houses. Symmetry gilded each line of his body where he stood at the banister. His ice blue robes seemed to absorb and refract all the light in the room, in the whole
But he didn’t have much time to think more about it, as McGonagall arranged them into rows and reviewed the steps of the waltz with them. Poor Neville was absolutely hopeless, but after they’d slogged through the box step what felt like a million times, most of the other students were at least passable waltzers.
Malfoy took a swig of his butterbeer, allowing Harry to subtly admire the long, pale column of his throat. “I see. Is that why you returned to Hogwarts? So that you can achieve the proper NEWTS qualifications?”
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry saw the hesitation on Malfoy’s face. Perhaps Malfoy hadn’t been on a broom since they’d escaped the hell of Fiendfyre during the last battle. Maybe Harry could convince the room to let them out without Malfoy getting on a broom? Just as Harry was beginning to weigh his options, Malfoy grinned.
society pages, always on the arm of some strapping young wizard. Biceps the size of Quaffles, rippling thigh muscles, even a bloody cleft chin or two. These dates look like they could take Malfoy apart without a second thought. They probably did, Malfoy crooning and clenching around them as they took him to bed...no, Harry won’t think about that.
The last strains of the waltz faded slowly, and the phonograph came to a staticky halt. The room trembled slightly, as though holding its breath, until McGonagall’s familiar Scottish brogue broke the silence. “Well done, Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Potter, a bit more work and you’ll make someone a fine dancing partner.”
His short lifetime of loneliness had been bearable because he had clung to the thought of finding his mate.
The lights winked and turned down low, but the display case obediently faded into the wall and was replaced by the door.
“I see. Harry, do you know what I do when I find myself struggling with a decision? I always pretend I’ve made the choice and see how I feel. Perhaps you should give it a try.”
Potter stuffed a forkful of shepherd’s pie into his trap and chewed thoughtfully. “I did try becoming an Auror. Everyone expected it of me, and I wasn’t sure what else to do. I made it through training, but I had to quit after my first raid.”
Pansy’s head snapped up and she glared at Harry vehemently. “Gone, Potter. Don’t worry your pretty head, he’s perfectly fine,” she spat, all former insouciance gone. “But Draco won’t be returning. He wanted me to give this to you, but I wanted to see how long you’d take to ask me about him. Four days, Potter? Really? You don’t deserve him.” Pansy’s lip curled as she pushed a crumpled letter into Harry’s hands and minced away.
“I suppose some exercise couldn’t hurt,” Draco said thoughtfully, turning up the tall collar on his cloak. “I won’t be inviting you in, of course.”
Malfoy paused, looking Harry over carefully. His eyes sharpened as he stalked toward Harry, crowding and caging him against the wall. Malfoy was all hue and scent, exuding expensive cologne and a spicy fragrance beneath that was all him. Harry sighed and drank him in. Malfoy might look delicate, but the arms surrounding Harry were determined and strong and overwhelmingly sexy. He leaned in slowly and growled again, his breath caressing Harry’s ear and making him shiver.
A slow smile softened Malfoy’s face. He reached out and took Harry’s greasy hand across the sticky plastic table. “Wonderful. And if you wanted to come by again for lunch, you’d be welcome to.” His eyes fell to his lap and he glanced up at Harry through long blond lashes. “Actually, if you’d be willing, I have some marketing questions I’d like to ask. Perhaps over dinner? I could pencil you in for Friday.”
“It says abstract art is supposed to look at ‘non-objective artistic elements’ and ‘encourage imagination,’” Potter had explained when he had complained, peering closely at one of the plaques on the wall.
Malfoy sighed heavily and took a scone. “Speaking of business matters is reserved for after tea, Potter. I promise I will answer your questions about the manor later. For now, regale me with how our Golden Boy became an expert on anything but slaying Dark wizards.” The words were smarmy, but Malfoy’s tone lacked any real bite.
“Harry, your face is awfully red. Are you alright? What did you want to talk about?” Hermione asked, concern evident in her eyes.
Surprisingly, Malfoy kept his word and his distance from Harry for a solid week. They partnered in Potions again and greeted each other in the hallway, but there were no seeker’s games of Quidditch or long, flirty study sessions, or sneaking down to the kitchen under Harry’s invisibility cloak. (Eighth years had no curfew, but the air of secrecy made it more exciting.)
“Right.” A long blond curl had fallen in front of Malfoy’s face, dangling like so many silken threads before Harry’s eyes.
Even Harry’s dreams were not safe from Malfoy. Harry would take hours to fall asleep every night, but once he was finished tossing restlessly in his creaky bed, Malfoy would be there for him. Always waiting so patiently, with cool hands and soft hair and welcoming arms. They would talk for hours, Harry’s head cradled in Malfoy’s lap, or they would explore a sun-streaked meadow that Harry had never seen.
And then Potter’s eyes met his. What captivating eyes he had, like a mossy pool in an ancient forest. Sweet relief washed over Draco, and he felt cooler than he had all summer. The dragon within roared with the delight of possession, urging him to touch and woo and claim his mate.
Harry shrugged. “Might as well.” He wasn’t at all looking forward to the long walk back to Hogwarts and could use a rest.
Unfortunately, Harry’s luck inevitably ran out. Just as Harry clattered out of the Charms classroom one day, already tugging the wadded fabric of his invisibility cloak from his school bag, someone yanked the cloak from his hand.
Judging by the way Draco was nuzzling at his neck, he was thinking much the same thing. “Harry...I don’t want you to leave. Come, let me whisk you away to my lair to have my wicked way with you,” he chuckled low in Harry’s ear.
A softly glowing orb rested lightly on his desk, accompanied by a folded scrap of parchment. Another note! And a gift, apparently, though nothing Harry recognized. He reached out for the parchment and unfolded it slowly. In contrast to Malfoy’s earlier flowery language, this note was brief.
readers expect him to be. Harry doesn’t talk much about being gay, and he especially doesn’t discuss his strong preference for bottoming. It’s a part of him, but not something that defines him. Unfortunately, it does seem to be how Malfoy defines himself, and he and his Hunk of the Week seem bent on shoving it in everyone’s faces.
Yet when Draco rose on his seventeenth birthday, he felt crushingly, disappointingly the same. No beloved image swam before his eyes, and no pull behind his navel led him to his fate. The following year was an exercise in drudgery. Without the hope for a mate, Draco did not understand why he was alive. Particularly when the presence of the Dark Lord infiltrated every part of his home, infecting it with fear and darkness.
Harry was speechless. He didn’t really need the money, but having the Ministry fund his research was a huge sign of trust. Hermione’s thoughtful actions meant the world to him, especially if it meant he could stay in England and sample Ron’s culinary experiments regularly. Maybe this would be enough, at least for the time being.
“Fancy a walk?” Potter asked as they stepped out onto the pavement. Blinking lights and honking horns a few streets away pervaded the cool night air, but it all felt rather distant and hazy through the fog that was beginning to set in.
Utter panic consumed Harry. He was supposed to be a Gryffindor, for Merlin’s sake. He had no idea where all his bravery had gone, but when he thought about speaking to Malfoy, it all crept away again.
Thank you as well for procuring and setting up my mobile. I already have so many more pictures of Scorpius than I would have otherwise. They don’t move, but they are precious to me all the same.
The library computers won’t access Instagram? It’s not depraved, but that’s probably for the best. I’ll attach a photo from the account I mentioned, but you really should get your own Internet access. Maybe a mobile phone. You could take your own pictures, or even call me sometime. No magic or library access required.
Harry sighed in relief as he took a seat on a long velvet soft and got out his quill and ink. “This room should stay the same size. What with all the bookshelves, it’s harder for the walls to sneak up on us.”
“One cannot shop with an unhappy stomach! Have you really not eaten yet?” Draco stared at Harry in disbelief. It seemed to physically pain him that Harry had skipped breakfast.
“It’s er, it’s good. Really good.” Harry even went as far as to rub his stomach exaggeratedly. “Um, yum.”
He’d only been dancing for a few minutes when he felt a figure come up close behind him. Someone tall, at least a couple of inches taller than Harry. Questing fingers skimmed his sides, and Harry leaned into the man’s touch. Slim hips joined Harry’s and began rocking them in a sinuous rhythm. A familiar spicy scent rose to his nostrils, and he inhaled eagerly. Strong hands joined Harry’s and placed them on the finest arse he’d ever felt. These hands felt far too kind to punish him, but he hoped he could persuade the man to do so. His body felt too good against Harry’s to give up.
Malfoy tutted disapprovingly. “Stand in front of the mirror, Potter. I shouldn’t have to tell you this, but demonstrate good posture for once in your life.”
Her smile reminded him of a hungry crocodile--but an oddly pretty one? “It’s a Muggle thing, you all get together and sing and drink a lot of alcohol.”
Harry reminded himself. “What high praise. More for me, then.” He shrugged and took another large bite.
“Dunno, Ron, but he’s definitely different lately.” Harry hesitated. “We’ve kind of decided to be friends? It’s a truce, anyway.”
Unfortunately, since Ron has been seeing Pansy Parkinson for a few months now, Harry has to hear far more about his old school rival than he’d ever wanted. The parties he gives, the luxurious robes he buys, the countless trips to exotic climes with different handsome paramours each time…
Pulling on those green robes brought color to his cheeks and allure to his eye. The man looking back at him was perhaps a bit awkward (and his hair would never, ever look presentable. Perhaps he should ask Hermione about the possibility of sentient hair), but he looked happy. Maybe even handsome. Harry knew he’d still feel rather short and scrubby next to Draco, but he was still glad to be by his side.
Harry shook his head, fighting back the sudden wetness in his eyes, and went back to pacing. Fuck Malfoy and his--his suprise snog! He’d figure this out if it was the last thing he ever did.
“Good evening, Blaise. Hope you enjoyed the ball. Potter’s here, just for the night, so no need to talk,” Draco drawled, already rummaging through his trunk.
"Er...sorry, I just don't think we're each other's type! I have to go." Harry grabbed his pile of clothes, grimaced apologetically at Malfoy’s shocked face, and turned on his heel to Disapparate home. Still half-hard and only in his pants.
Harry shoved him playfully. “You absolute prick, you know that’s not what I meant. D’you think a dance is what the room wants?”
Malfoy jabbed a finger at a blue settee, which Harry interpreted as an invitation to sit down. He settled himself in a heavily embroidered wing chair next to the settee. A spindly table split the space between them. The room had no other furniture, but every centimeter of wall space was consumed by portraits. Big, small, rectangular, oval, landscapes, centuries-dead pets...Harry assumed the decorator had gone a bit haywire and whoever commissioned the room had been too nice to tell them how bizarre it looked.
I do not anticipate your reply. It would be far too much to expect our flawless Saviour to keep up with his correspondence. Even though he is still just a speccy git.
He was encouraged by the house’s inviting appearance. Perhaps it would like him, even if Malfoy didn’t. Harry screwed up his courage and rapped on the door of Malfoy Manor.
He also felt rather itchy and over-exposed. Unwilling to close his heavy bed curtains to trap heat inside, the boy waved his wand and coaxed his blankets into a soft ring. He’d often made a nest as a child; perhaps this would help him feel better.
“You pronounced ‘my love, my dearest, my only’ wrong, you absolute tosser. You’ll thank me later,” Draco declared, poking Harry sharply in the side.
Harry dropped his best smile and settled for a sheepish one. “Er. Yeah. Sorry about that, didn’t want people fussing or acting weird. But I am really here from the Ministry to study your house. Can I come in?”
Rod was there with Malfoy, splayed over the vast work table and writhing in pleasure. Slender fingers of iron gripped the man's hips as Malfoy ate him out slowly, decadently, stopping only to drip shimmering praises in his lover's ear. Harry stood frozen in shock. Malfoy was absolutely destroying this enormous man in the most tantalizing way possible. And he was certainly not a bottom.
Hermione smiled. “Ron, I feel like nothing could keep you away from fresh chips. But he has a point, Harry. Sex is a private thing, and you’re talking about walking in on Malfoy and his partner like it’s nothing. If it really bothers you, you can always try to talk to Malfoy about it. But I don't think it’s really your business. Even if it were, we shouldn’t be discussing it in the middle of the Three Broomsticks.”
“Squeaky clean,” Draco ordered when they’d reached the correct threshold, and the door creaked open. A vast expanse of white tile gleamed before them, as though it were a competition to see which surface would be most blindingly bright. Of course Draco sauntered in like he owned the place, remarking on the new decanters of bath oils and judging the thread count of the towels. With a flick of his wand, frothy pink and gold bubbles foamed from the jeweled taps. Clouds of scented steam rolled through the room, obscuring Harry’s view.
As majestic as the castle was, Harry wished they would have made it less drafty. Probably not a concern at the forefront of the founders’ minds, he figured. While returning to Hogwarts had eased the constant chill within Harry’s chest, the approach of winter had worsened his condition, so much so that his fingers were constantly waxy white and cold to the touch. Heating charms could only do so much, and Draco Malfoy had taken it upon himself to do the rest. They were currently seated in one of the large bench seats in a side corridor, across from a roaring fireplace. They would usually be in the eighth year common room, curled up on an overstuffed sofa, but Seamus had decided to smuggle in a karaoke machine, and none of the woefully enthusiastic performers were talented enough to make staying in the common room bearable. (Dean was particularly bad.) Hence their current presence in the bench seat.
“You’ve finally noticed. How magnanimous of you, Potter. You know, I think I’ll do you for free.” Malfoy cocked his head, smirking at the stunned look on Harry’s face. “Your robes, of course. The Git Who Lived wearing my clothes is the best publicity one could desire.”
Pansy smirked, pretending to toast him with her drink. “Give the man a prize. I’ve only been trying to get Draco to admit it for a month, but I know it’s been longer than that.”
“What is it? Did Malfoy do something after all? We’re not supposed to fight but I’ll--I’ll jinx his hair pink! Bastard…” Ron looked a bit odd trying to threaten someone with fluffy yellow wool wound around his hands, but Harry appreciated the sentiment.
“Oof. You know, this isn’t terribly dignified.” Draco looked almost cute for once, with his half-done tie slung around his neck and tow-like hair drying in odd directions. Not dignified at all, but terribly lovable.
Draco would never talk back to his mother, but he would grit his teeth in subtle frustration as he summoned a quill and ink. He quickly penned a cold response and tied it to the fluffy owl. He desperately hoped to never see it again.
The first day of January was brisk, with a certain quality of cold, clear light that cut through to Harry’s bones where he stood at the entrance to Hogwarts. All was icy and still. It was a new day, a fresh new year. And Draco and Harry were heading to London.
On Friday, Harry combed his hair extra carefully (not that it made any difference) and picked out his least holey pair of jeans. He even half-strangled himself with a necktie. The house would want to see he’d made an effort, after all. He Apparated to the right spot this time, just outside the gates of Malfoy Manor. They gave easily at his touch again, practically wriggling with delight like an overexcited puppy. The walk up the avenue seemed shorter this time, and the trees bent practically in half to shade his way. Harry chuckled to himself. This house liked his presence much better than most of them did.
Harry recounted what he’d seen that night at Luxe, trying his best not to linger on the more lurid details. From Hermione’s face, he could tell he wasn’t doing a very good job, but at least it wasn’t a long story. Ron’s mouth was hanging open by the time he’d finished. Harry was tempted to reach over and close it for him, but at least
“I might, but I think that’s everything I have right now. Could I owl you if anything else comes up?”
Creating a home is a very specific kind of magic. Even for Muggles, each home has a certain feel, a particular mood. Some homes are warm and cozy, some squalid in a rather charming way, and others seem to be doing their best to defy categorization altogether, never remaining the same one day to the next.
Long-dead hurt rose thorny and dark in Draco’s throat, choking him and stopping his breath. “Really, Potter? I know that our...tryst did not end well, but I’ve done as you asked since then and maintained my distance. Remember, you were the one who rejected me.
His first feeling was one of uncomfortable warmth. Intense irritation quickly followed. Having already kicked off the covers, he stripped off his pajama top and lay back across the open bed.
Harry laughed, long and loud, as tension leached from his body. “Thanks, Ron. That means a lot. Wouldn’t snog you either, but thanks.”
A large velvet pouch waited at the Gryffindor table the following morning. A heavy silver cord secured a parchment scroll to the bag, and of course it had Harry’s name on it.
“Harry, you’re back! Oh, how we’ve missed you!” Hermione exclaimed, half-running into the room. She pulled him a hug immediately, and Harry’s nose was thrust right into Hermione’s riotous hair. She smelled like hand lotion and thick black ink, just as she always did, and it made Harry smile.
It was Draco’s turn to roll his eyes. “Salazar’s sake, Pans, it won’t kill us to be genuine for once. Now the moment has passed, so back to our usual stiff upper lips and I’ll see you tonight,” he said, herding her out the door of his office. Pansy reluctantly allowed him to do so, accepting his goodbye with poor grace. She would reveal the identity of Draco’s mystery boyfriend, and she would lure Weasley to her. Like a delicious fly to a spider’s web.
Harry Potter is perfectly able to take care of himself. But he likes it best when Draco cares for him.
“It’s,” Marta sighed heavily for a moment before screwing that smile back on. “It’s still an order of our famous chips, which comes with a cup of our delicious special sauce. Muggle style just means triple-salted. Would you like to try it?”
When the kiss ended, Harry sighed and pressed his forehead against Malfoy’s. Even he needed a bit of extra courage for what he confessed next. “I did mean that, you know. Seeing you again made me really happy. I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again ever since I left.”
Twining brick walkways were far too complicated for Harry to recall, but Malfoy led them with sure steps. They came to a shaded lea, where the rocks were covered with verdant moss and a perfectly stereotypical picnic waited in stasis. Malfoy gestured broadly before them, and waited for Harry’s answering smile. A breath later, a warm hand was at Harry’s cheek, and he leaned into the thumb following the line of his cheekbone. Malfoy pulled Harry close, and Harry allowed himself to be led. Malfoy’s lips brushed whisper-soft against his own. He tasted of honey and man, and Harry’s heart broke just a little. Despite how lovely this was, despite his longing to stay in a walled garden with a sunny, yielding Malfoy forever, none of this was real. Real Malfoy was moody and clingy and would scorn blissful refuge, away from the world. And Real Malfoy would never permit any wrinkles to darken his doorway, much less his shirt.
Harry carefully folded the letter, his mind whirling with thoughts. The angry schoolboy and the volatile dragon he had known would both have responded with fiery anger or barbed threats. This mature attitude and well-wishing was completely unexpected. How did Draco always manage to be so unpredictable?
Unfortunately, the evening continued swiftly downhill, and Pansy soon felt more single than ever as Neville and Hannah performed a sickeningly sweet duet. Seamus’ Irish accent made “Come a Little Bit Closer'' almost entirely unintelligible, but he did demonstrate some impressive dance moves. Draco practically seduced everyone in the room with the hip-swaying rockabilly song he’d chosen--the leather trousers he’d selected had been the last straw, even Potter’s tongue was practically hanging out of his mouth--but then Ron had drunkenly fumbled through “One Week” and killed the mood.
Seamus did indeed seem to be attempting to bend his spoon in half, despite Dean’s attempts to pry it out of his hand.
” Marta nodded, completed the transaction, and shoved the paper cup of soda in the witch’s hand as she edged toward the door.
Thank you to everyone who posted such lovely and encouraging comments. You made me want to make something beautiful for you, so I hope you liked it. Thank you so much for reading!
Malfoy’s head jerked up and his eyes widened in alarm. “Perhaps I could point you to the garden instead? The broderie around the back of the property is said to be
Malfoy stared down at his polished leather shoes and took a deep breath. “I...I’m afraid I need to come clean, somewhat. I would like to sincerely apologize for my home’s actions. The manor isn’t usually this bizarre, nor are its machinations usually so intimate. It may have indicated something after your last visit about desiring you to stay and acting accordingly. I did not disabuse the manor of that notion, for which I am dreadfully sorry.”
“How dare you…” Draco turned to face him. Grey eyes glinted impishly at Harry, and a tidal wave of water careened toward his face. So began the first water fight Malfoy Manor had ever seen. Somewhere between splashing all the water out of the soapy tub, huddling together in absurdly fluffy towels, and tumbling into Draco’s four-poster bed, Harry fell in love. He would chuckle later to think that it was all because of one incorrigibly romantic house.
“All right.” Harry laughed. “It’ll stop any girls trying to ask me, and no one will try to cut in if I’m dancing with the snooty Prince of Slytherin. I should’ve thought of this earlier.”
“They wouldn’t if you cared for them properly,” Hermione reminded him, exhaustion dripping from each word.
? You do realize you’re of age now, don’t you? You can leave whenever you like, rather than haunting the halls like one of those gormless ghosts that are always moping about. You ought to reconsider: I had rather hoped you would spend the holidays with Mother and I at the manor."
Now, after touring that Muggle museum, Potter was attempting to talk him to death. In public, where he couldn’t escape. Draco knew several spells that would have similar effects and didn’t understand why Potter would be prolonging his torture. Why would Potter insist on updating him on the activities of each Weasley over the past seven years? Had he never been on a second date before? And had there always been this many Weasleys? Salazar, they multiplied like rabbits; no wonder they had dubbed their home the
“Nah. See you ‘round.” Harry pulled again at his cloak, but couldn’t extract it from the other boy’s firm grasp. He settled for a cold glare instead.
“Oi!” he yelled, thumping Malfoy hard on the back. “Put me down! What the bloody hell d’you think you’re doing?”
“Happy Christmas, Draco.” Harry swung his feet up onto a nearby pouf as he settled in for the long haul. He knew it would sound disgustingly sappy, but it was Christmas. With a lapful of blond boyfriend, he really had nowhere else he’d rather be.
“Alright, I guess we have to do what the room wants,” Harry announced. “Er, what are all the bowls for?”
Malfoy cared for Harry so gently in his dreams. It wasn’t a real relationship, so Harry felt no fear of being hurt or abandoned. Dream-Malfoy was lovely, but he made it so difficult for Harry to wake and go about his real life, where Malfoy did not care for him at all.
He was dead set on brooding in his rented flat for a few days before setting out again (maybe to France this time, even though the language made no ruddy sense coming from his mouth), but a visit to Ron and Hermione changed his plans entirely.
“Good afternoon, Potter,” he drawled. “I heard you may have an answer for me.” Malfoy was trying to be patient, and his face was as smooth and expressionless as ever, but his leg jittered awkwardly. Having finally made a decision, Harry felt oddly calm.
“I’m not sure, I just started and couldn’t stop,” Malfoy mumbled and fumbled to start putting the bowls back.
The shepherd’s pie was delicious, as was the butterbeer and the airy pavlova Ron had made for dessert. The three of them demolished all of it, swapping stories about Ron’s work at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and Harry’s studies and Hermione’s research into reversing obliviation. When all the food was gone, Harry sat back and sighed happily. The urge to travel still niggled at him uncomfortably, but spending such an evening with his best friends was almost enough to make it go away, if only for the night.
Luckily, he had a perfect view of Draco’s bedroom door from where he sat on the hard chair. Harry squirmed a bit, wishing his boyfriend had purchased more comfortable furniture, but he hadn’t too long to think about it.
Malfoy scoffed and glared daggers at the walls. “Malfoy Manor, of course. It’s a bit of a mouthful when one is in the midst of a scolding. Now you see here, Mal--"
Harry gawked at her, dropping his goblet. Luckily, there were only a few drops left, but they both winced as it clanged loudly against the stone floor. “What?! But we’re barely adults! D’you think it’s a wizarding thing, or a Weasley thing? Or,” he made a face, thinking of Draco and the kind of expectations he might have, “a pureblood thing?”
“Hello, Pippy,” Luna said, winding one long blond lock around her finger. “Could you do us a favor and put these in Harry Potter’s room for us?”
Everything changed on his eighteenth birthday. Yes, technically everything had changed during the Battle of Hogwarts, but despite the hope that day provided to the wizarding world, Draco still felt empty inside. Even when his father was led away by the Aurors after the battle, even during his and his mother’s hearings with the Ministry, Draco felt only grey. Rather than his life being suffused with evil, it had become nothingness. But as dawn broke on the morning of his birthday, Draco
won’t stop babbling about it, even though it’s got to be old news by now. Arseholes. But Scorp was charming. Can’t imagine where he gets it from.
Thank you for dinner last night. I would like to apologize for my son’s behavior. I recently explained to Scorpius that I enjoy the company of both men and women in an intimate way, but I had thought he would be more circumspect than to blurt it out in front of you. He and I shall have to have a talk about discretion. Although with you telling him about the time Teddy perfectly replicated a pig’s face, I am sure we will have many other topics to discuss as well.
“Have you quite finished running away now?” Malfoy asked in a low voice. “I know you’re afraid, but I won’t hurt you.” Wickedness tinged his voice. “Unless you ask me to do so, of course.”
Malfoy was certainly a bastard, but at least he was an intriguing one. Harry quickly fell into his old habit of observing Malfoy again (“no, ‘Mione, it’s not stalking. I’m just...keeping an eye on him”). Malfoy had obviously changed somehow, but Harry just couldn’t put his finger on it. He attended classes as he always had, sitting in the back with the other Slytherins but still managing to trail just behind Hermione with excellent marks. Eighth years weren’t allowed to join their house Quidditch teams, but Malfoy still flew in long, lazy loops around the pitch. He spent meal times smirking and sneering away, Parkinson cackling at his better insults just as she always had. As much as Malfoy had changed physically over the summer, no one else seemed to care. Harry did not see his eyes flash silver again.
“Harry, I’m sorry! Are you all right? Oh no...”Seamus practically tripped over himself to apologize for burning Harry, but Harry quickly healed the burn and apologized for getting so close to Seamus’s markings. Most of the other students went uneasily back to pretending to listen to Professor Binns (who hadn’t noticed anything had happened at all), but Harry could hear muffled snickering behind him. He whipped around to see Malfoy, face uncomfortably red, as he tried to stifle his laughter.
“What’re you doing at our table again? And in our seats? Get back to Slytherin with the rest of the snakes. Bloody ferret, you should know better.” A vein pulsed in his forehead. Harry knew that vein, and he also knew that Ron before his morning tea was fearsome indeed. He opened his mouth to try to diffuse the tension, but Malfoy was faster.
“I understand you’re wary. I intended to tell you eventually, but I’d hoped you would love me for myself alone, without any fated obligation. As my inheritance has effectively shattered that opportunity, I would like to ask your permission to formally court you.”
An exhausted Harry had had quite enough of museums by the time they left, but Draco saw a poster with a plesiosaurus on it and bolted for the Natural History Museum. Spending time around the looming, serpentine skeletons and realistically gory wall murals made Harry feel vaguely sick. But Draco resembled a kid on his first trip to Honeydukes, all bright eyes and overflowing questions. It was too precious for words. Harry did have to drag him away from a docent when he started asking how dinosaurs were related to dragons; they restricted themselves to reading the placards after that.
. Seriously, Harry? With the way he looks at you? It’s like you’re some kind of prize that only he is allowed to have! Of course he’s always been intense, but it’s very possessive for friendship. Obviously I couldn’t ask Malfoy himself about it, so I did the next best thing.
Hermione sighed. “I’ve suspected something strange was happening for some time now. With the way Malfoy’s been acting lately, and how off you’ve been feeling. So I decided to do some research.” She flicked her wand, and a pile of old books flew from the girls’ dormitory. The door smoothly opened to admit the books and they landed on the desk beside Harry’s bed with a dusty
