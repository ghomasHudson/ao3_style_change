“Thank you for being there” she whispered to him, before pulling back and saying, “he’s in his room” and heading off to who-knows-where in the massive house.
“You must be Pansy. Nice t’meet you” Harry said from the doorway, nodding at Pansy. Draco felt her hand clutch at his, her painted nails digging into his palm; their silent way of saying ‘oh my god he’s fit’ that they had been using since about age fourteen. Draco squeezed back to agree as he pulled her through the front door and after Harry as he walked ahead of them back to the big house.
“Easy there, blondie” in his ear.
“alouette, gentile alouette, alouette gentile alouette” she sang in a low, soft voice, slowly rocking the baby in her arms.
With that, Harry disapparated, leaving Draco standing alone, feeling like the monster everyone always told him he was. He was so used to his father’s overt and violent homophobia, his mother’s silent but hurtful disapproval, that he had believed Harry was angry purely because it had been a man. He felt a bit sick at how blatantly he had disregarded Teddy’s safety. He hoped his mother never found out.
Harry rolled his eyes and slid into the bed next to Draco, wondering whether sober Draco would still want cuddles.

“So am I” Sirius said, eyes sad. “There were four of us at school. James, Remus, Peter and myself. Peter left for America after we graduated. Didn’t even come back for the funeral, the bastard” he elaborated. Draco was taken aback by the venom in Sirius’ tone when talking about Peter.
“With you?” he asked, just to double check, because this couldn’t be happening to him.
“When Harry was a weean he found these piglets running down the track just beyond the farm's edge, and the daft boy scooped them all up and brought them home. Since then he’s tended to them mainly. Loves ‘em like children he does, given ‘em names and everything”
“And you don’t- you don’t care?” Draco asked hesitantly.
A few weeks into his new life, Draco gets shaken awake by a frantic looking Harry in the middle of the night.
At this point, Sirius came up behind Harry. “Ah, the famous Draco. Nice to finally meet you” he said, voice warm.
Draco nodded as he took in his surroundings. The square was lined with boutique clothes shops and tea shops and cafes and charity shops. It was very quintessentially British, the sort of place his private school mates’ grandparents would have lived. Life must be so boring here, he thought to himself. He couldn't imagine living in a place so small, where everything must have been so slow paced.
Somehow, Harry was still chatting to some of his teammates, even with Draco leaning on him like a listing ship.
“I also like sleep, though, yeah? You can kiss me again in the morning”
But it is so insulting, and it’s hard to find the humour. Especially with Peterson, who is heading towards us now. I drain the rest of my wine, and grimace.
“Alright Draco?” Draco nodded back, grateful to have his presence recognised.
“I’m not sure if you noticed, but my father didn’t even send me a birthday card. Just because I have ‘real’ parents doesn’t mean they love me” Draco finished, not letting Harry get a word in. his volume had not risen above a low murmur, and with that he stood up and walked away. He was too tired to deal with the can of worms that was his father, but that conversation had opened it up.
Oh lei oh lai oh lord
“I don’t- I don’t think I feel that comfortable wearing this outside” said Draco, looking at the floor and wringing his hands in worry, as if he would disappoint Harry by setting boundaries. Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hips and said “then just wear them for me, just in here” before leaning in for another kiss, showing Draco that Harry would do whatever made Draco most comfortable.
He finds her in the kitchen, with a glass of wine and a plate of biscuits. She looks up when he walks in, but doesn’t say anything. Instead, she rises, drains the last of her wine and takes his hand, before dragging him back to his room. She climbs onto the covers, and he gets in next to her, laying his head on her lap like he used to when he was little.
“Oh, Draco” Harry said when he looked up. he dropped the book and walked over to Draco, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders and squeezing him tight.
“why did you come here if just to talk to him?”
“I wasn’t interested in the dance, I was interested in you” mumbled Draco, too hungover to properly think about what he was saying.
“Horses need exercise. Joining me, Harry? I’ll watch” Sirius said, kissing Remus chastely on the lips before standing and stretching. Harry nodded and stood, collecting all the plates and placing them in the sink.
He wandered around the other tables, some of which just held groups of people talking, but some held arts-and-crafty things; hand painted postcards, friendship bracelets and the like. He bought a postcard to send to his mum, and a friendship bracelet to send to Pansy, who had been a childhood friend since birth. He hadn't expected to miss her as much as he did.
“as delectable as you look Pansy, you’re not quite my type” said harry
“it’s alright my darling. I had my suspicions, but as yet I never had any proof. I think I can handle it, though.” She said. Draco didn’t know how she was always so strong. Here he was, crying like a baby, when his mum had just found out- from her own son, no less- that her husband of twenty years was sleeping with another woman.
It was like all Draco’s dreams were coming true.
“hello boys! I hope you are ready for a catwalk because I bought Potter some delectable pieces today” Pansy said, motioning to Harry to but the bags down.
He wore his walking boots anyway, mainly because the village was surrounded by countryside and he wouldn't be surprised if the celebrations took place in one of the surrounding fields rather than the village square.
She was right of course, she’s always right. Harry took in some deep breaths and was distantly aware of Ron rubbing his back. His hands stopped shaking, and his shoulders relaxed.
(Harry, 10:30 am)
And then Harry’s other hand was cradling Draco’s cheek and he was bringing their faces together and then Harry’s lips were on Draco’s, so impossibly soft and sweet, and the kiss was so gentle Draco felt like he was falling apart.
“Thank you, Narcissa. I do my best” Harry said, laughing. He finally turned to Draco.
“And you look like you’ve made no effort,” she replied. Looking disapprovingly at his outfit.
“In more ways than one mate” Harry laughed, and Ron slapped him on the arm.
He arrived in saint mungo’s around 20 minutes later, hot, sweaty and flustered with the Weasley matriarch in tow. When they were showed to the private room Teddy was in, Harry collapsed into Molly’s arms, tears running down his cheeks with wild abandon.
“Your grandma cooks really well” Draco said, not knowing what else to fill the silence with. He was worried for a second that Harry would withdraw at the mention of his grandma, but instead he offered Draco a sincere look and said, “aye, that she does. Nothing better than Indian food”
It’s made slightly bearable by the fact that Harry is entirely oblivious to everyone else’s wooing attempts and has only had eyes for me for the past half-decade. In fact, if it weren’t so insulting, it would be funny to watch Harry rebuff their advances without even noticing he was being come onto in the first place.
“Yea, it’s just nice to meet new people, make new mates and stuff” Harry said, before turning and smiling at Draco.
Montero (call me by your name) by Lil Nas X
A bottle too many of Ogden’s finest later, and all the Gryffindor’s were on their feet, stumbling and laughing. A new song came one, and they all shared a look of pure excitement.
“there are actually three different species of snake native to England” explained Hermione as Harry made his way over.
“Blaise kissed me. He fucking kissed me like I’m not basically in love with his best fucking friend.” Harry said into Dean’s chest.
“of course I do, Draco” Harry whispered back, even though it was all too early and entirely the wrong time and he didn’t want Draco to feel trapped with him.
Eventually, Draco stopped crying and his breathing evened out. He pulled back a bit from Harry, looking at him and biting his lip in worry. “you- you love me?” he whispered into the darkness.
Soon, Ron and Hermione burst in, replacing the two women on the sofa, and begin cradling Harry, looking for all the world as if the golden trio were back in the Gryffindor common room after a particularly gruelling week.
“of course you do. okay, sure” Harry says, taking off his glasses and dragging a hand down his face before putting the glasses back on and sitting up, facing Draco and mirroring his pose.
“Have you considered applying to the University of York? It’s not very far away from here. If you wanted, you could come back most weekends and for holidays.”
I don’t trust myself to speak, but I take my wand from my bedside table and open the door so he knows he can come in. he sits gingerly on the side of my bed, so I am staring at the outline of his thighs in the dark. I do not expect what he says next.
“tough luck mate,” said Ron, voice dripping with pity and distaste at the name plate on Harry’s door; ‘H.J Potter & D.L Malfoy’. Harry knew this was what McGonagall meant; he could feel the line of boys behind him waiting with bated breath for his inevitable rage-filled outburst.
Not after everything else he has done for me.
“Breakfast now lad, and a bit of a break for you. Other than the lambs there’s near nowt to do. Everyone’s got ta be fed, ‘course, and Harry’ll probably exercise the horses today but you’re done, I reckon.”
“it’s a tiny bit late for that mate, I watched you throw up for about two and a half hours last night, give or take”
“he might be but I'm not. I'll drive you home tonight, Harry. Draco said it was Bath?”
The fear and worry in Draco’s voice now made some of the tears spill over, but Harry didn’t trust himself to speak and so he just grabbed Draco’s hand and squeezed tightly, before raising his wand to his forehead and pulling out the memory.  He turned to Draco and said in a hoarse cracked voice, “I need to show you, I’m sorry”
As he was toeing off his boots in the hallway, he heard Harry’s voice coming from the sitting room where he always found Sirius waiting for him, either reading a book or going over the farm accounts. Sirius was basically the bookkeeper of Potter Hall Farm.
Harry had the decency to look sheepish, and opened his mouth to say something-hopefully an apology- but before he could Hermione stood and turned to Draco.
Once Harry is well and truly gone, though, the weight of his familial problems comes crashing back down, and Draco goes to find his mother.
She slid her hand back into his as they walked back to the house, passing Harry who was carrying one of the benches for the table. He glanced at Draco, grimaced a bit and then ducked his head again. Draco wasn't sure what to make of his reaction and he saw Remus frown at Harry too.
“i’m sorry, Harry. For what it’s worth, if I were you I wouldn’t go either” the lawyer said, laying a hand on Harry’s shoulder, before leaving.
“So, sweetheart. Tell me more about this Harry boy. You seem rather fond”
The first rugby game of the year was coming up, and Draco was trying too hard not to think about what it meant that Harry asked him, especially as none of the boys had mentioned it, so he assumed that meant that Harry hadn’t invited any of them.
“I’ll send him to Hermione so it’ll look like a promotion. God, Draco I’m about to ask you to marry me, I don’t give a shit about my pa”
I spy you looking lonely you know boy that’s why
“please assemble into your groups, and then I will call the name of one person in each group to collect all your wands and present them to me, and then I will give you your portkey, and your charmed device for emergencies. Thank you.”
Harry nudged Luna’s head away and turned to him. He slowly slid a hand up her thigh and said with as much nonchalance as he could muster,
When everyone was getting up to leave, Hermione reached up on her tippy-toes and pulled him into a tight hug. She didn't let go for a long time, instead whispering in his ear; “I really want you to come to the film with us, but I know you might not want to now and I’m sorry. He’s an idiot who has never really understood other people’s feelings. If you don’t mind, I would quite like to come and hang out in your cottage sometime, just us?”
“Sirius and Remus are the first gay couple I’ve ever met, and they’re happy. My dad used to tell me gay people weren’t allowed to be happy. That they didn’t deserve it. I’m sorry for invading your space but I didn’t choose to come here, I was sent away, I was unwanted back at home. To have Sirius talk to me like a real person is the best thing that’s ever happened to me”
“hey” Harry breathes, thanking his lucky stars that Draco came to him.
“He’s very protective of his little family, you know? And no offence but we all know what Sirius’ family are like. I hope this doesn’t offend you but we had a month's worth of weekly dinners where the conversation was dominated by whether he was actually going to let you stay here or not” she said, and Draco stiffened somewhat.
It is quite bad. We have been together two months now, and we were seen by a stray wizard whilst on a date in muggle London. We were having dinner at a small east-African restaurant in Brixton, and when I woke up this morning a picture of us was the front page of the Prophet. As much as it hurts to see our fragile bubble burst so expectedly, the photo is lovely. My head is tilted backwards, by face lit up with laughter, and Potter is looking at me with so much affection in his eyes it makes my heart ache. He is smiling his soft smile that is reserved for me, Luna and Hermione. I feel so lucky to rank on that list.
“of course you do, darling. My taste is impeccable and my knowledge of you comprehensible. Now come on, if I don’t start getting ready soon, we’ll never leave.”
“why are you being so nice to me Harry? I was so out of line the other day, I haven’t even properly apologised yet, and you’re offering to host a dinner party for my friends?” he held his hand up to stop Harry speaking when the other boy opened his mouth. “before you remind me that you are the perfect saviour and you are just this selfless, I need to apologise properly. I was being entirely unreasonable and not listening to your request. I wasn’t thinking of Teddy either, which is abominable, and I now understand and fully accept that he comes first in this household. I am so used to my father’s homophobia towards my sexuality that I immediately assumed you were angry due to prejudice, and not good reason. I am sorry.” This was the Draco that Harry knew. “it’s okay, Draco. I understand your reasons, and yes. Teddy always comes first. You have the freedom to do whatever you want but if that includes people, especially people I don’t know, please let me know first so that if needs be, I can organise Teddy staying with someone else.” Harry said, deciding the apology was enough for the blond to be ‘Draco’ again.
True to his word, and despite his exhaustion, Harry refused to cave to the sadder end of his music taste on the first night. He was lying in bed, staring at the draping’s listening to the most upbeat music he could cope with while half asleep, which happened to be the mellow tones of Still Woozy, an artist he could never get enough of.
“if you don’t like it Blaise, I can change it.” Harry said, and dug his muggle iPod out of his pocket. Hermione had spelled it so it wouldn’t be affected by the magic of Grimmauld, and he had loads of music. “what mood are you guys in?” he asked.
Draco and Harry were the only two who did French, however, which Draco revelled in. it meant that they could converse in French, effectively cutting everyone out of their conversation, and Draco was rewarded with the full weight of Harry’s attention on him.
Draco couldn’t miss how fond Remus sounded when he talked of Harry. Harry clearly wasn’t just a summer hand but special to Remus and Sirius, though Draco couldn’t help but wonder what the relation there was. Remus and Sirius themselves seemed worlds apart, to say nothing of the fact that Harry was an entirely different race to the both of them.
The meal finished quickly after that, with Draco offering to stay and clean up. Sirius shot him a grateful smile, and patted Draco on the shoulder as he passed in his haste to leave the room. Harry had run off the minute Effie’s plate was finished and it was polite to do so. Draco assumed Sirius was off to find him.
“Hey, Draco”
“you walked all that way? In this weather? That’s at least two and a half kilometres! Please tell me you did not walk all that way in the dark last time you were here”
Draco watched Harry sway, and on the line ‘mama, ooh I don’t wanna die, sometimes I wish I’d never been born at all’ he knew he unequivocally loved Potter. In what way, he wasn’t entirely sure; he would happily have Potter as a friend and nothing more so long as it meant he could be as close to the boy as possible.
“easy there Malfoy” he said in his warm deep voice. Draco was so focused on the warmth of the hand on his shoulder he forgot to shrug it off, forgot to act like Potter was his least favourite person on the planet.
He had overheard Harry and Ron discussing it whilst he did his classics homework- as the only one who did classics, he was always alone when working for it.
Unbeknownst to Harry, Draco had done much the same, for different reasons. To escape the oppressive emptiness of the manor, the vacancy in his mother’s gaze and the persistent, yet not unwelcome, absence of his father, Draco had run as far away as he could. He found himself travelling Europe, desperately seeking anonymity and re-education, scrubbing away the brainwashing he had had since birth. he found happiness in the arms of tall strangers, in the bottles of vodka and black nail varnish he could not cope without, and the knowledge that he was free, if not forgiven. Free was enough. He discovered what he had taken to calling his ‘latent homosexuality’ (latent, he argued as he was shocked he had not seen it before in the care he took with his clothes and hair, his disdain for Parkinson at the yule ball, his intense jealousy and rivalry with Potter, that seemed now to have been a front for something else) by reading. He read voraciously, absorbing muggle history as he went. He cried over Achilles and Patroclus in the Iliad, felt for Owen and Sassoon in his poetry anthologies, envied Sappho’s openness, Woolf and Sackville-West’s garden. He read the sonnets of Shakespeare, seeing dark skin and green eyes in ‘may I compare thee to a summers day’, he saw rough hands and strong arms in ‘though art more lovely’. He stayed up all night to finish the Picture of Dorian Grey, swearing to live his life openly in homage to Wilde.  He promised himself this too, swearing that for every year of self-expression stolen from him by Lucius, for every potential friend he lost in his desperation to observe pure-blood etiquette, for every hurt he endured under Voldemort’s stay in his home, he would live as loudly as he could; for the child he had been, too scared to be the real Draco. Standing on the platform, his trunk full of shrunken books, hair conditioner and (surprisingly) muggle clothing, Draco faced his final year at Hogwarts with pride and trepidation. Free was enough.
“show me your constellation” he says. Malfoy giggles, before turning his head to face Harry and saying
In the back of his mind, he couldn’t help also thinking how much he wanted Potter to hold him like that, to sneak up behind and wrap those strong, brown arms around Draco’s body and stay there. Draco sighed, then shivered. The temperature had suddenly dropped. He was not looking forward to sleeping in the cold. He went to his (their, his brain helpfully reminded him) tent to get a jumper.
Draco’s shoulder’s slumped when he thought of his father’s homophobic tirades, and how he would never be able to both find love and have his father in his life.
“oh sure! If Draco’s okay with that. I would hate to impose on you all night and invade his space. A sofa would be fine, I've slept on worse” Harry said earnestly.
Apparently, Ginny had been Harry’s first kiss, after which he had said he saw her more like a sister, and irreparably broken her heart for a good year afterwards. They were friends now which was… nice, Draco supposed. He still wasn’t sure what to make of the whole thing.
“I'm glad you’re glad” he finally settled on, kissing Harry’s cheek, and revelling in the fact that he could do so now, after wanting to for so long. Harry seemed somewhat heavy, weighed down by the emotional day, and so they sat in silence on the edge of Harry’s bed. Draco traced shapes on the back of Harry’s hand with his fingers, and relaxed into the feeling of safety Harry’s presence provided. He could only wish Harry felt the same about his presence. He felt too scared to ask, though. Not at a time like this. Harry didn’t need Draco’s insecurities on top of everything else.
“wow, you have a song for everything Potter, I daresay I’m impressed” smirked Draco, but his only response was more crying, and a small, broken-sounding “why did Patroclus have to die?”
“that’s grim mate. Do you wanna use our bathroom to get ready? I can’t imagine you’d want to shower in there after that”
The next morning, as he did every morning, Harry stumbled down the corridor towards Teddy’s nursery. He was more hungover than he thought he would be, and was deeply regretting not requesting the babysitting services of Molly or the Black sisters. Teddy would be going to one of them tonight though, as it was club night, and Harry was desperately excited. Despite being in a four-month-old relationship as an eighteen-year-old, since getting together with Draco almost all of his evenings were spent on baby duty. He was desperate for a proper night out again.
“And if sex is off the table, how do you feel about kissing?”
Harry laughed and said over his shoulder to Parkinson “
Weasley gave him an apologetic look and Granger squeezed his hand. Draco didn’t know what to make of this. He had spent the last seven years resenting the golden trio. Resenting the bond they seemed to have, resenting the fact that they never really got into trouble despite seemingly making it their mission to break all the school rules.
“Anyway, your mate passed out in our bathroom, so I had to carry him, and Diggory had started with us and was working his way up, so I had to carry your mate up, racing ahead of Diggory as he went into the other rooms. I even had to hide in the maintenance cupboard” Harry said, laughing so hard his eyes crinkled.
Draco nodded. “of course, Harry. I’m sorry, about all of this. You were really good with Pansy. I’ve never been good at comfort, especially not so physically. Blaise will want to talk to you about this, just so you know.”
She seemed like the best kind of mum, Harry thought. He imagined his mum would have been like that, worrying about his friends and offering to drop them home.
“i don’t want to talk about it I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry if I had done anything to make you feel like you couldn’t tell me, like you had to get Ron to do it because you thought I'd react badly. I never want to make you feel like you can’t tell me things”
How could he still be so perfect, after all he’d been through? Draco didn’t know what to say.
“Mam this is Harry’s new boy for the summer” Ron explained. “He’s bought nowt proper t'wear so we’re here t'see if any of Ginny’s’ll fit ‘im”
Harry wormed his way through the crowd on the dance floor, scanning the writhing mass of bodies before he found Draco dancing with Pansy. He grabbed one of Draco’s hands in his and dragged him out of the club. “Harry, what’s wrong? You’re shaking, did something happen?”
Harry didn’t know what overtook him, but summoning his famous Gryffindor courage, he walked over to where Draco was sat opposite Teddy, knelt on the wooden floor between them, gently took Draco’s face in his hands, and slowly leant forward, before gently pressing his lips to Draco’s. It was just a feather-light touch, barely a whisper, before Harry was pulling back, rubbing his thumb along Draco’s cheekbone. He smiled at the blond. Draco sighed, eyes fluttering closed before he whispered “kiss me again, Harry” and what could Harry do but oblige? He leant back in, sliding his lips against Draco’s, close-mouthed and chaste, but bursting with sweetness and joy. Harry felt Draco’s hand cup the back of his head. Suddenly, something pink and slimy hit Draco’s face and Harry laughed delightedly at the piece of strawberry Teddy had thrown in a desperate bid for attention. He gently wiped it away before kissing Draco again, and again, and again. All thoughts of childhood and emotions and the prospect of facing the two Slytherins currently asleep in his spare bedroom, or the two Gryffindors in his own eddied out of his mind as he kissed Draco again, and again, and again.
“I wouldn’t worry, Draco. You’re a catch” Harry said, winking at him, before taking his hat off, running his hand through his hair and scooting closer across the bed covers to Draco.
His mum gave him a t-shirt that his aunt Andromeda had left, which was her husbands, and so should fit Harry. Harry was delighted with it, and then proceeded to strip to his underwear in the middle of Draco’s room, hanging his clothes on the back of Draco’s desk chair. The domesticity made Draco yearn
“how very, Slytherin” Draco murmured. “does that mean you like it?” teased Harry
(Draco, 7:26 13/09/1998)
Harry thought Draco would smell a rat, as he has not been so formal since his initial letter to Narcissa almost three weeks ago now, but Narcissa assured him Draco would be too taken aback by the invitation than the wording. She said she would tell Draco of her decision to move in with Andy that evening when she returned home, after he would have received the letter. The two returned downstairs, where Andy was putting Teddy to bed. Harry’s heart jumped to see Andy taking such a hands-on role with Teddy again, but he also felt somewhat sad. He had thoroughly enjoyed being Teddy’s primary caretaker, and he didn’t want to lose him. The two women left soon, Narcissa gracing him with a rare kiss to the cheek as she left. Harry then floo called Ron, explaining the situation and asking for help with the bedroom. “I can’t say I’m particularly excited to live with him, but you should have seen Andy with Teddy today, and if her living with Narcissa means she can be a better Grandma, I would let Draco sleep in my own bloody bed.” “blimey Harry, he’s not even your son.” Grumbled Ron, continuing before Harry could open his mouth and object “I know I know, you’re doing this for him and also for yourself. It’s okay Harry, of course I’ll help. Charlie’s in town so I’ll get him to help too.” “you’re the best Ron, I love you mate” smiled Harry. He was secretly very happy Charlie was coming too. Harry never entertained the notion of getting with him; the Weasley brothers were brothers to him too, but a boy could look, and oh boy did Harry like to look at Charlie. He disconnected the call, and checked on Teddy before going to sleep, simultaneously apprehensive and excited for his new housemate.
“I think I want to go to York university” Draco said as he sat down with Sirius the next day. “And, I think, I would quite like to stay here a bit longer as well”
And then he had greeted Draco. And Draco had just stared at him. Like a bloody teenage girl with a juvenile crush on a teacher. God, it was embarrassing. And now he had to go and spend an hour and fifteen minutes listening to Harry’s baritone speaking the language of love.  He was really starting to hate year twelve.
“I like you too Potter, and I should like to be your friend also.” Pansy said. Harry offered her his arm and the two went back downstairs.
At about six, Harry closed his laptop and sighed, pulling out his phone. Soon after, the rest of them followed, and by about six forty-five, they were chatting about the upcoming holiday, and their plans.
He was interrupted from this retrospection by Dean, Seamus and Harry getting louder than Draco thought humanly possible
“Blaise, would you want to come?” when the boy shook his head, Harry said “would you be happy watching Ted for a few hours, or should I leave him with Molly?”
“Yea, but I had to hide in a cupboard to do so, and it just- I just” Harry croaked out, unable to finish his sentence and sighing as the tears loomed again.
“well that’s a start” Pansy sighed. “accio makeup bag”
Draco took that as his cue to leave, slipping out of the door, his mouth tasting like ash at the prospect of Harry rushing off to see what had to be his girlfriend. Returning to his room, he allowed his curiosity to get the better of him, and he pulled his phone out. He went first to Seamus’ Instagram, then clicked his ‘following’ tab and scrolled down until he found both Harry and Ron’s accounts. Annoyingly, both were private, but he requested them, and then embarrassingly spent the next two hours checking his phone every five minutes to see if Harry had accepted his request, without any luck.
(Sunday, 06/09/1998)
“You trust me, Harry?” Luna said softly, shuffling closer to him.
He is still mine.
Much to my surprise, Potter looks serious. He doesn’t respond.
“I was so scared that you wouldn’t be here when I woke up. that you left Teddy with me because you were going somewhere. Going to see-“
While he hated to be alone, he felt like an intruder at the Burrow, convinced that had he worked faster, George would still have a twin. But he was never truly alone, every moment he spent in his own company was in a way also spent with Queen, Bowie, Winehouse, Muse, Enigma- anything and everything.
“Aye, of course not,” Harry sighed.
“anyway, club night tonight lads? Blaise and Pansy are back in town and you had fun with them last time, yeah?”
“what, read?” I replied, unsure of what he meant.
like real people do, by Hozier
“of course I bloody do, you’re you!” replied Draco, finally turning to face Harry.
He liked both of the girls. They were sweet, kind and intelligent. Luna had seemed a bit weird, but her matching outfit with Harry was stunning, and so Draco assumed her ditsyness was because she was artsy. He couldn’t help but be jealous.
“Really, not even to the loo?” Peterson sneers and Harry may be a bit oblivious, but he knows when someone is trying to be cruel. He’s spent too much time with me.
“Whatever will make him suffer” Luna replied just as quietly, and Harry lightly put his hand on her arse, shifting her body closer.
Seamus smirked, and lay across Harry’s near-naked lap, and said “we all slept in dear Harry’s bed last night”
Just then, the floo chimed and Harry went down to greet Dean and Seamus. Blaise wolf whistled as Harry entered the living room. “my, my Potter. You look positively delicious” he purred. Harry laughed, and said “you wish, Blaise”
He asked Ron to accompany, because Ron had been the one who was always there. Ron knew Harry and his feelings the most. Sirius would just get angry, and Harry wasn’t going to fuel his anger, he was going to seek peace of some sort, even if it was just the peace of knowing that Vernon truly was six feet under, and could never hurt Harry again.
It was a good night. The drinks were just beer, and no one took it too far. In the privacy of their room, Dean and Seamus were much more couple-y, and it was a heart-warming sight.
Ron piped up from behind Harry. Draco had forgotten he was even there. He had been too busy falling in love. Harry could recite Shakespeare. He was basically Draco’s dream man.
“And I hate that you’re still this immature. We’re not children anymore, Harry. Draco has done nothing to you, but you’ve done a lot to him since he’s been here, and you need to fix that.” Hermione said, voice unforgiving and Draco heard Harry heave a sigh. Deciding he’d heard enough, Draco quietly closed the window and pulled his sleep shorts on. Just as he was climbing into bed there was yet another knock at the door.
“I think our Harry told you to leave him and Ron alone” he continued. Bryn turned his back on Remus, and said to Harry,
“How can I say no?” Draco said.
“Really? And here I was, thinking them boys' schools was pure shagging” Harry said, teasing.
“Oh, and Harry should be coming back soon. There’s a few ewes left t’lamb, so he’ll be back with them tonight too.” Remus said as Sirius put the kettle on. Draco wondered who Harry was. Probably another summer worker like he was to be. He hoped Harry would do the lion's share of the work. Remus’ biceps were about 5 times the size of Draco’s, to say nothing of the comparable leg strength. Draco would barely be able to lift a newborn lamb, let alone do meaningful farm work.
“I’m not sure. Maybe French with business studies? And then maybe I could apprentice with you in the financial running of the farm?” Draco suggested tentatively, worried Sirius would find him too forward.
It was a bit of a startling realisation- how much he liked Draco, but not an unwelcome one. He talked to Ron about it when he returned home that evening, and Ron was supportive of it, which mattered massively to Harry.
“right. Club night tonight yeah? I’ll send Teddy to the Burrow and then floo Dean and Seamus.” Harry said, and was greeted with enthusiasm. Harry showered and changed, and packed Teddy’s overnight bag and half a banana loaf before floo’ing to the Burrow, where he had a lovely tea with Molly. Since Malfoy had moved in, Harry had missed being the sole man, and youth, in the presence of old ladies. They were a balm on his tired body and mind, and Molly’s presence always made him feel as if he were wrapped up in a blanket made of pure love.
the end :)
Unlike most other schools, the dorms weren’t in their own buildings but rather part of other buildings that also had classrooms and staff offices and the like. Draco lived in what was colloquially dubbed ‘humanities house’ because it was where English, History and Economics were taught. There were some common rooms there as well, which was where he was headed now. It was a gorgeous stone building, only a few decades younger than the castle itself, and was officially named after Edward the confessor. It was absolutely huge, with a reception foyer and two wings. One wing held dorms for year twelve, and the other classes. The main part of the house had prefect dorms.
By the hair of their teeth, they avoided teachers and prefects, and got Luna and Hermione into their room. They all sat about chatting and catching up, and the girls had never seen the school before, so they were marvelling at the size of Harry and Ron’s shared dorm.
“You must be Harry, darling. It’s lovely to meet you, I’ve heard a lot” his mum said as she stood by to let Harry into the front hall.
“Oh, Harry! I found this delightful little Italian place, we must do lunch there” Peterson effuses, turning his whole body towards Harry and away from me. Harry, ever the idiot doesn’t even notice the slight. Somehow, despite everything, he still manages to see the good in people.
It ends with Hermione crying as Ron is on one knee in our living room, the ring that Potter and I helped pick glittering in a maroon velvet box. She nods, too moved for words and Ron scoops her up and whirls her round and in that moment I look at Potter, and he looks at me and I know we’re thinking the same thing.
“Thanks, lad. I’m off to do the rounds. When you’re done here, you can head back to yours. If we need you, we’ll call you” Remus said, before leaving Draco alone in the kitchen. Draco heaved a sigh and pushed up the sleeves of his sweater, before making his way over to the sink and starting his cleaning. It was cathartic, and he lost himself in the suds as he worked, contemplating how the past day had gone.
Here, Harry ran his hands down his body as he leant back, Dean doing the same- they had clearly made this dance together.
Harry turned to see Oliver Wood, the team captain from the year above approaching them. He panicked for a second, worried that they would be chastised for poor performance.
It was six days later, the day before the new term started. Harry came down for breakfast in the morning to see Molly and Sirius siting at the table, clenching mugs of tea and looking sombre.
Draco sat on another log about an arm’s length with Harry, and watched him light the joint and inhale deeply, before tilting his head back and blowing smoke up to the sky. That too, was annoyingly sexy and Draco sighed, holding his hand out. Harry passed him and joint and watched with a bemused expression as Draco inhaled deeply, holding the smoke in his lungs for a beat before exhaling it upwards too, cocking an eyebrow when Harry looked surprised.
“That's fine, I need to shower anyway. Thank you so much” Draco said, and almost skipped back to his cottage. They had organised a party for him! He couldn't remember feeling happier, even if he barely knew anyone who would be attending.
“Yea, see? I didn’t even know that until just now. And Harry has a lot of trouble with outsiders, especially ones that come with the same connotations as you”
“What do you want, Draco?” Harry said, voice gravelly.
“Oh- I didn’t know the girls were here already… how did you even get them here?”
Harry was in a large sweater and baggy pale blue jeans, and mismatched socks that were just so sweet it made Draco’s heart hurt.
They had a large dairy herd and a few bulls to keep it growing, and three pigs they kept as basically pets.
“Well I’m not stopping you from being an arse to me. I’m saying to stop being one to Hermione”
Harry smiled and nodded his own affirmation, before Seamus jogged off, wrapping an arm around Dean’s shoulders and heading towards the gym.
Sirius and Remus then descended into conversation between the two of them so Draco excused himself and found Hermione and Harry sitting in silence in the kitchen. It was so at odds to the first time Draco had seen them interact, when Harry had lifted Hermione off the floor with the force of his hug. Draco hated that he was the reason for this.
“Now, now don’t be rude. We’ve a visitor” Remus called out softly, going up to the closest cow and rubbing its head gently. The cow pressed its pink wet nose into his hand and Remus smiled widely.
Here, Pansy trailed off, and Harry squeezed her hand reassuringly. After a few moments, she carried on.
“that means only bad things, very bad things. Bad things like us being in a group with Malfoy bad things” the ginger said, fighting against his girlfriend who was pulling him closer to the board.
“Hey, Potter” Malfoy breathed, the smell of firewhiskey ghosting over Harry’s face as Malfoy giggled again.
“oh you hate it?” spluttered Potter indignantly. “at least there’s no bloody corpses here”
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles come down
“Genuinely though, thanks for tha” Harry said, sitting up and bracing his forearms on his knees, looking at Draco earnestly. “She’s called herself in love with me since she was about ten, and it’s only gotten worse as she’s gotten older and hornier”
It has been pure hell. We were all put in the same living quarters, but the Ravenclaws immediately returned to their usual dorms, leaving the rest of us in an unused tower, guarded by a portrait of Cerberus that the golden trio insist on calling fluffy. I want to hate them for it, but I can’t.
That day, Sirius had mentioned that Effie was coming over for dinner again. It was a monthly thing, he explained. He also explained that she was Harry’s paternal grandmother, and that her and her husband Monty had emigrated to England from India when they were in their twenties, and had bought this farm, which at the time had been entirely dilapidated, having been bombed in the war with no one around bothered to rebuild it. The only things that had survived were the farmhouse and cottage, but they were worse-for-wear and surrounded by the debris of bombed-out barns and animal carcasses.
Pansy kissed his cheek and rubbed his back, before looking over her shoulder at Harry, who was dithering in the corner and generally looking quite pathetic.
He knew he had a few hours before Draco woke, and so he threw on some cargo trousers that he filled with various smoothie pouches and apple snacks and a large hoodie, and put Teddy in his little bear onesie that made Harry cry from how cute it was, and took Teddy to the park. It was nice and empty, and Harry relished in feeling like he and Teddy were the only two people in the world. The morning was foggy as winter slowly bled into spring, and the park looked hauntingly beautiful in its emptiness, the trees just starting to turn green again.
“No of course not. It's just, something about the idea of someone- not necessarily older, just more experienced- to see me at arguably what is my worst, and want me anyway, you know? Josh sees Cher at home, when she’s being spoilt and whiney and he likes her despite this, or maybe even because of it”
He was reaching to knock on the door when it swung open and Narcissa was standing there, looking like the perfect mum in a matching pyjama set and slippers.
“… and he had the nerve to tell me I looked good!” Harry exclaimed.
She ushered Draco down onto the bench at the table, and Harry looked amused at the whole interaction. Just as Harry himself was sitting down, Sirius and Remus came in.
The dancing was still going, but Harry and Luna were taking a break, sat on a bench outside in the small courtyard in front of the hall entrance, getting some air before they went back inside.
“Bonjour la classe. Aujourdhui, on regarde un film sur la deuxieme guerre mondiale, avec l’actrice connnue, Audrey Tautou. S’apelle ‘un longue diamanche de fiancailles’. Bien.”
Harry looked at these pictures now, heart swelling with warmth at the proof that Teddy has all the love Harry had wanted as a young child. He eased the slumbering Teddy back into his cot, but fell asleep back in the armchair, too fatigued to go any further. The demands of fatherhood were catching up to him, and he felt tired in his very bones, but he wouldn’t change it for the world. Initially many had thought it foolish that he throw his life away by adopting a child when he was still a child himself, but Harry didn’t feel like a child. He had fought and died in a war all by the age of 17. He was a child in age only, and he had decided that after making the ultimate sacrifice for the wizarding world, he would spend the rest of his life doing exactly what he wanted to do, fuck anyone’s expectations. And as it turned out, Harry wanted to be right here, asleep in an armchair, covered in baby drool, sleeping happily knowing that the closest thing he had to a true family member was only a few feet away, sucking his thumb, and safe. When Harry woke up the next morning to the sound of content baby gurgling, he was stiff all over and desperate for a hot bath. He took Teddy down and prepared his milk, then sat down to floo call Molly Weasley, honorary grandma, to ask if she could babysit for a few hours. She could never say no to ‘her baby boys’ as she had started to call Harry and Teddy, and soon Harry had blissful peace for the foreseeable future. He wrote a quick letter to Andromeda, reminding her that their weekly tea and ‘teddy time’ was that afternoon, and then went to have a bath. He groaned as he eased himself into the clawfoot monstrosity of a bathtub that he had not found the time or energy to replace. He closed his eyes and pondered on Andromeda. He couldn’t resent her for how she felt, not with how guilty she always looked whenever she came over to see Teddy and was reminded of her failure to care for him. Not that Harry saw it as such; grief was an uncontrollable emotion, and she could never fail the grandson she so clearly adored. He wished he knew how to help her. He knew he had coped with his lack of family much better when he had found the Weasleys, and then Sirius. Maybe that was the answer, he thought. Finding family for Andromeda to help her get back on her feet. He thought of her husband’s parents, and whether they would be dead by now. He then shuddered at the realisation that Andromeda had family. She had sisters, well only one sister left now. Narcissa. Harry knew she was around as he had testified for her and her son after the war. He wondered how she would react if he were to write to her, and ask her to reach out to Andromeda.
Just before dawn, Harry awoke wrapped in the strong embrace of Ron’s arms, and he had never been more thankful for his best friend. He wriggled out of bed and softly padded down the hallway to Teddy’s room. He scooped up the still sleeping boy and went down to the living room, settling onto the sofa with Teddy on his chest. He knew he should really let Teddy settle into a proper sleep routine, but he needed the comfort, and Teddy was currently best placed to provide it.  He was lulled into sleep by the soft sound of Teddy’s breathing.
“Well, figure it out. She deserves better than that.” Draco said, tone still light as he tucked the biscuits under his arm, picked up the two cups of tea and walked out, leaving Harry staring at the wall in silence. As he walked out the front door, he heard footsteps make their way into the kitchen and a deep sight.
Draco mumbled a thanks before tucking in with all the grace of a starving Ron Weasley. Harry said as much, making Seamus and Dean laugh. Draco finished his breakfast in record time, but then turned slightly green and ran out of the room again.
Ron and Ginny near immediately went back to their other conversation, and no one but Draco seemed to notice their reaction to Harry and Hermione’s closeness. Harry wraps his muscled forearms around Hermione’s middle and leans his head on her shoulder. At this, Draco notices Ginny looking again, her face hard, but Ron resolutely looked away.
“not a funny joke, Malfoy” Harry ground out, before grabbing Ron and leaving the room.
When the lesson ended, Draco couldn’t leave the classroom fast enough. There was still about some of the film left, and he was dreading Monday morning. He all but ran to English, frantically imagining his English teacher, a severe woman called McGonagall who was also the deputy head, naked to calm his libido down.
Harry wandered over to the tents, where Ron and Hermione were. As much as the idea of Malfoy being too weak to carry his own bag sat uncomfortably with Harry, he was glad for the extra weight; the extra challenge. The burn of his legs with the added weight would hopefully distract Harry enough that he wouldn’t be reminded of his year of horcrux camping to painfully, or too often. He and Hermione, but mainly Hermione, had spent the week teaching Ron muggle camping traditions, and Harry found himself looking forward to making a campfire each night, sharing the firewhiskey Ron had snuck into his bag and having fun, like normal teenagers. He was excited to star gaze and roast marshmallows and generally feel like a teenager for perhaps the first time in his life, and with the extra weight of his bag he knew he would still get the gratifying release of emotion that exercise brought him. Surprisingly, he found himself actually excited. Excited enough to almost forget who he, Hermione and Ron would have to share this experience with. Almost.
“James and Lily, Harry’s parents” Sirius’ voice startled Draco. Draco turned and Sirius nodded back to the photo. “James was like a brother to me. I miss them every day, we all do”
Ron just laughed, then shouted in indignance when Harry stole his bacon.
“Yea mate, and I’m doing bloody econ. I need her here.” Ron laughed.
“Last time I wore my normal clothes I got laughed at. I’m not subjecting myself to that again” Draco replied, forcing a grin as he remembered the embarrassment he felt on his first morning here.
“I love that woman” Sirius said, taking the tin from Ron and accepting a kiss on the cheek from him too. Draco marvelled at the easy affection between everyone around him, except him, of course. He knew such easy love had to be earned, but he felt a bit miffed and more a little lonely to see it blatantly in front of him all the same.
“I don’t go to anything without Draco. Surely you know that” Harry says, turning his head and pressing a little kiss to my cheek. I grin at Peterson as he turns puce.
Strawberries and cigarettes, always taste like you
Like a record baby right round round round
Harry wakes up in an unfamiliar bed with the unmistaken feel of a body next to his. He eases out of bed so as not to wake Draco and takes Teddy downstairs to prepare his milk and potion. Harry covers Teddy’s little head with kisses as he walks, so overwhelmed with love for the tiny figure he held in his arms. Soon, Teddy is happily suckling his bottle, subdued with the illness but looking immensely healthier than he had the night before. When he’s finished, Harry settles onto the sofa with Teddy curled up over his heart, before falling back to sleep.
As he was making the marzipan, he heard a light, female voice join in with his singing, and Hermione came up behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head between his shoulder blades. Harry leaned into the embrace, her presence draining some of the tension out of him.
“just be there” Pansy sighs, “just… be there.”
“woah, Malfoy. Careful there.” Draco tried to wrench his elbow away but was too unsteady and ended up crashing into the warm body behind him. Harry’s hands gripped Draco’s hips to steady him and Draco felt sick as he was reminded of the hips Harry had been holding early. He knew jealousy was unseemly, but he was too drunk to care.
“I, uh, girls aren’t really my thing” he says, twisting his hands in his lap. Despite knowing Harry wasn’t going to react badly, he felt uncomfortably vulnerable at his admission.
It was getting a lot colder. Harry found himself walking up the long driveway to Draco’s home wrapped up in his puffer jacket with Sirius’ old doc marten boots on. His feet had started to freeze in his trainers when he wore them out now.
After seeing Luna and Harry snogging in the corridor on his way to bed, Draco had gone right back to the hall and swiped a couple bottles of champagne. He definitely regretted it. He currently feels even worse than after the first whiskey night.
And then Harry clambered into his bed again. Well, Draco wasn’t entirely sure what he was expecting, but the thought of all of Harry's deliciously muscled legs just there was a bit overwhelming. Draco clambered in after him, in how own t-shirt and sleep shorts combo, and lay right at the edge of the bed, unsure of what to do.
Harry grinned and looked up at Hermione, saying “his name is Talgarth and he’s my new best friend.”
(Harry, 5:27 pm)
Harry opened the door to Draco, standing there looking weirdly nervous. These past few weeks, Harry has also delighted and being flirtatious with Draco, watching the blond blush and stammer every time.
She kept glancing through the living room window that faced the farm house, and after an hour she heaved a deep sigh.
“I see what you mean Dray. He is irresistible when he’s in daddy-mode” pansy giggled.
“I’ve got it.” Harry said. They went to the bathroom, and saw the unknown boy passed out on the floor.
to him before. Good, yes maybe when he had been saved from the fiendfyre and when Potter had testified for him but never nice, never friendly, yet here Potter was, murmuring about how it was only two or so more hours before they could set up their camp for the night, and how Potter could do most of the tent sorting and Draco didn’t know what to do. It felt wrong to receive such kindness when he was so utterly undeserving of it.
Harry felt Ron’s hand land on his shoulder as he gazed up at the photo.
“you sure about that, princess?” Harry winked at Draco, before carrying him to his room.
Students milled around the common room, draped over sofas and armchairs, waiting for their roommates to be announced so they could unshrink their trunks and settle in. Harry looked around the new common room, admiring the cosiness of the space; dark wooden furniture, plush cushions and heavy curtains hanging over ornate French windows that overlooked the lake and forest. Tucked in one corner was a high desk covered in mugs ad kettles and various boxes of different tea bags, next to this, a tall cabinet filled with board games: muggle and wizard alike. On one wall hung the crests of each house, and the walls were painted a deep and welcoming purple. He soaked up the warm orange light emitted from the lamps, closing his eyes and feeling his chest ease at the recognition he was back at his true home, safe, and surrounded by those he loved. Opening his eyes and looking up, he saw the ceiling was a deep black-blue, and coated in twinkling stars.
He supposed he should make somewhat of an effort now. He would hate for the other five to form a tentative group only for him to be left entirely on the outside, and he owed Potter big time given that the Saviour was carrying the load of a death-eater, for nothing in return. The thought made Draco uncomfortable. He didn’t know how to do this. He knew how to be mean, and sarcastic and bitchy; he knew how to make enemies but he didn’t know how to make friends. Politics had always done that for him.
“come on, Pans. You can help me find a replacement shirt.” Harry said, setting off to his room, or his and Draco’s room now, he guessed. It was hard to be in such a young relationship when you already lived together.
“She was supposed to be getting better”
After about thirty minutes more dozing, he got up to go back to the kitchen and stopped in the doorway, taking in the heart-warming sight before him. Draco’s face was lit up with laughter, whilst Teddy’s face was covered in strawberry-banana mush as his tiny hand kept missing his mouth with the small pieces of fruit. He grinned, and realised that maybe, just maybe, he liked Draco a little more than he had expected to. The blond looked gorgeous in the early December sun, in one of Harry’s hoodies and a pair of soft cotton pyjama bottoms.
Oh shit. Draco really didn’t want to do this. unbidden, the image of his father fondling Prewett came to his mind, and he flinched, shutting his eyes.
“thank you, Harry, this looks wonderful.” Said Narcissa with more warmth than Harry had expected. As they ate, they made somewhat stilted, but not awkward small talk, until all of the sandwiches and most of the cakes were gone.
“Knowing you, Ron, there’ll be no woo-ing involved” Harry laughed. “But fine, Luna it is. You have to deal with Ginny’s wrath when she finds out she’s not invited though”
” Talgarth spoke, resting his head on Harry’s collar bone.
“How was your night, Draco? Pansy is very pretty” Ron said, winking.
“Draco, are you crying? Are you okay?” Harry asked, looking down at Draco, who had never felt more embarrassed.
I stare at him, hating how right he is. Hating that he can’t just legilimens and see how I feel about him without me ever having to say it. I hate that he’s famous, which makes this all harder, and I hate my father for sullying me with his politics, but most of all, I hate that he’s right.
“If that’s all…” Ron said, flipping the duvet off him looking for all the world as if he’s about to manhandle Cedric out of the room.
Bella and Andromeda hated each other for that reason, too. It was nice to know that they were willing to put that aside for his mum, though.
He was lucky, and always wound up with one of his friends as a roommate, this year was Theo, and so at least he knew he wouldn’t be sharing a room with either of them. Well. It could have been luck; it could have been Lucius Abraxas Malfoy being on the board of governors. Draco was never quite sure when and where his father interfered with his school life. Direct educational interference was an impossibility, however when Lucius was being particularly cruel, Draco liked to think that always rooming with Theo, Blaise, Greg or Vince was a fatherly kindness rather than pure coincidence.
Draco didn't know whether to be complimented at being called ‘decent’, especially given that Harry didn't act towards Draco as if he thought he were decent, or insulted that Harry didn't care about why he was there, but before he could dwell too much, Harry and Ginny were right by the gate, so he stepped aside to allow the cows through, then joined them on the lower level. For the rest of that morning, the conversation went forgotten.
A monster winer, winer
“That bad?” Draco asked sympathetically.
Remus snorted and muttered something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like ‘no it won’t’ and Sirius elbowed him playfully.
We should just kiss like real people do
“Fuck off Ron. You had Hermione in your bed too. And at least we’d finished by then” Harry said.
“I’m mad at him. Can I sleep on your sofa?” she asked, looking even younger than him at that moment despite the year she had on him. He also wished he had put a top on before opening the door.
A figure, clearly drunk out of his mind, lurched in.
“Yea. I stayed with him when I was at his house during the holidays. We always sleep back-to-back, not touching, but his snoring is enough to convince me I’m not about to wake up in a cupboard. I'll probably want to sleep with him tonight, as you’re not an option. Is that okay with you?” Harry asked.
“i don’t think it’s important, Draco. For what it's worth, asexuality would never be an issue for me, in a relationship.”
The evening progressed in much the same fashion. Harry and Blaise stayed somewhat sober while Pansy and Draco got steadily more hammered. Pansy drunkenly delighted in making as many lewd comments about Harry as he possibly could, while Draco turned a deep shade of tomato red and kept telling her to ‘fuck off’ with increasingly slurred words.
“It's not what?” Draco asked, going to the kettle to prepare a cup of tea.
“You’re my cousin?” Draco asked, eyebrows raising in disbelief. His mother had simply told him that it had been arranged for him to spend the summer and autumn with his cousin on a farm. He had assumed the cousin was his age, and the son of an elusive aunt and uncle. Instead, he was faced with a gay couple and a much older man claiming to be his relation.
Which brings me to where I am now.
“Does dad know?” he asked with a shaky voice.
“Well, everything seems in order here. Good to know we’ll be practically living together, Harry. I’ll see you around” Cedric said, giving Harry a lascivious smile before leaving.
Harry and Ron had made it back to their room half an hour before curfew, having spent most of the day gallivanting around the countryside with Hermione. It had been amazing, and she had promised to bring Ginny the next time she came down to see them. Going back to Hogwarts after eating chip butties in a proper ye olde English pub with his two best mates in the whole world was bittersweet, but Harry was also really starting to like his new school. He was in bed, reading a book when the door slammed open.
He will tear your city down
“made?!” chocked Draco as he sat down. “you made this all, Potter?”
“I’ll say! I was not expecting to see her bare back poking out of your duvet” Ron said.
Draco awoke late on Monday. He really didn’t want to be at school, he wanted to be at home, with his mum, and now he wouldn’t be able to get ready properly or he would miss all of French. He pulled his uniform on and ran like hell towards the main castle for his lesson.
Harry turned to the mirror, where he stood in the suit Luna had sent him, that had arrived mere hours before the ball. By some miracle, it fit him perfectly, except it was blue? Green? Turquoise? Teal? He wasn’t sure. It sort of shimmered in the light as he turned, the colours changing and shifting with his movement.  If he was feeling particularly poetic, he would say the suit was almost an exact representation of being underwater, with the silken material and deep rich colours.
“no I don’t suppose I would want to share a tent with our gracious saviour. I must admit I’m overjoyed to know I won’t hear Granger and the Weasel shag all night though; the thought alone is enough to drive me to suicide”
“someone call the police”
“wha-?” Harry went to ask, but she spoke over him.
He was terrified. Hogwarts had never lost a match. Those were big boots to fill. He wondered why he let Sirius talk him into applying here. He had been so insistent on the school, with speeches about Harry’s rugby career and ensuring a good education and how qualifications from a private school of such calibre would secure the rest of his life but there was no personal touch.
Harry was just admiring himself in the mirror when the doorbell he had had installed specifically for Pansy rang, echoing throughout the house. Harry raced down the stairs to ensure he got to the door before Ron or Hermione. Draco knew not to open the door and disrupt the ritual. Ron was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
Draco saw tears rolling down the faces of both Hermione and Harry now. Silent, but bold in their grief.
“Right. We need to get you two ladies out of here” Harry said, unwilling to think about Hermione’s declaration until he at least had some food in his body.
“Fuck off Harryyy” Ron groaned again.
(Harry, 6:10 am)
Here, Harry looked distinctly uncomfortable and trailed off, but then shook himself and carried on.
Here Harry laughed at his own joke, and Draco couldn't help but think how handsome he looked when he laughed, how carefree and uninhibited.
Draco was slowly going feral. Potter refused to stop talking to that infernal snake. The sibilant, guttural sounds made heat pool in Draco’s stomach, and Potter’s incessant stream of chatter with the grass snake now wrapped around his bicep meant that Draco had been in a state of latent arousal since ten in the bloody morning.
Open up your loving arms
When at Hogwarts, if we see another pureblood of suitable lineage and wealth, we may stake our claim on them. It is an archaic binding magic, but weak and easily undoable.
“Then let me handle this” Luna said, clambering into Harry’s lap, sitting side-saddle. His arms instinctively wrapped around her. The scent of lemons wrapped around him, and he went to lean his head against her chest, feeling tense now that her body blocked his view of Cedric.
After a pointed cough from Parkinson, he got up and started to set up the tent. He didn’t think Malfoy would be much help, so he just did it himself. He remembered how from a trip with the Dursleys when he was about ten. They couldn’t lock him in the cupboard for four and a half days in a row, so he was allowed to come, but he had to pitch the Dursley’s family tent, and he was made to sleep tucked up in the porch without a proper sleeping bag. As painful as the memory was, he was glad it stopped him from looking inept in front of the Slytherins.
He didn’t know how to react. He could hardly be sarcastic and cruel now, not when Potter has been so unfailingly nice. As much as Draco was desperately looking forward to stopping for the day, the closer they got to setting up camp, the closer he got to sharing a tent with Potter. It was easy to harbour whatever feelings he harboured for Potter when there was the unbreachable Berlin wall of staunch rivalry between the two, but clearly it was November 1989, because that wall was no longer there, and Draco didn’t know how to cope without its protection. He was scared. It was not a nice feeling. He distracted himself by focusing on Potter’s soft breathing from where the boy still walked beside him, and he was soothed. He didn’t want to think about the implications of that.
Didn’t mean to make you cry
Draco talked about Pansy and his mum’s crazy sister, and what it was like growing up with a silver spoon in his mouth from birth. Draco notices Harry doesn’t talk about whoever he lived with before Sirius, and assumes it must have been a care home like in Tracey Beaker, and so doesn’t push.
“It’s so good to see you, Pans” Draco said, squeezing her tighter and burying his face in her neck this time, breathing in the scent of vanilla and lavender that he was so accustomed to. It was only then when he looked up did he realise that Remus and Sirius were standing by the door to his cottage too. He set Pansy down but wrapped an arm around her waist, wanting to keep her close still and turned to Sirius.
Your grandparents organised my marriage to your father for me. His family dates back to the arrival of William the conqueror, and the Malfoy’s have been aristocrats ever since, and spent many centuries at the right hand of the king. You know my family are landed gentry, and my parents wished for me to find a suitable match for our standing. I had two suitors, actually. Your father, and Mr Nott. I couldn’t bear Nott. He was so restrictive of me, always passing comment on how I dressed and the books I read. I was repulsed, and so I chose your father. My only choice was between the two of them.
“oh-“ Harry faltered, unsure of what to reply.
“I know you’re gay, Draco. It's not exactly subtle, not to someone who’s also gay. I also know that your mother knows that I’m gay, even though your prick of a father doesn’t, excuse my language.”
“I don’t know how you know that Malfoy, as it certainly wasn’t you” Potter says, staring at me. I shrink under his gaze. Beside me, Blaise jolts. He must have cottoned on.
Hermione’s hand shot up, as always, as did Dean’s. “yes miss Granger?” said McGonagall with an amused smile on her face.
About half an hour after the game, Hermione got a phone call and turned to Draco, saying
“Notice what? How he didn’t greet me? Or tried to ask you out twice in front of me? Or lied and said the party was on the one day I was busy so he could get you alone? Yes, I noticed” I said venomously, feeling too dejected by Peterson’s actions to remember I’m not supposed to talk to Harry about this. I’m used to talking to Harry about everything.
When they were precocious fifteen-year-olds who had believed the world was theirs because they had money- though, Draco was sure that the other four still wholeheartedly believed this- they had chosen to drink wine because they had thought it distinguished them from the rest of their cohort; specifically, the rugby boys who got wankered off of beer and Cîroc (because of course, they were all disgustingly rich too).
The next morning, Harry woke him and Hermione up and told Draco they had cows to milk, and told Hermione that Sirius was waiting for her in the big house. The tension between them was palpable and Draco felt distinctly uncomfortable. The feeling only grew as he and Harry walked to the milking barn together in complete silence. Harry kept shooting little glances at him that Draco noticed but said nothing about, and Harry set about preparing the cows, still having said nothing to Draco. This was worse than the beginning, Draco decided as he set about opening the little gates to let the cows through.
“Here, Draco. Harry said you might need it” someone said, passing him a bottle of water. No, not someone-Hermione! Yes, Hermione had come and now was lying next to Draco. He turned his head and smiled at her, and she smiled back. He liked her a lot. Ron, Luna and Ginny were all there too, and the group lay out on the grass until late, when the girls had to go and get the train home. Harry and Ron propped Draco up and delivered him back to his room. Theo was out, and Draco he had missed his first ever whiskey/wine night since year 10. The boys would not be pleased. Ah well, the boys could fuck themselves, Draco had spent the whole night with Harry, and he couldn’t be happier (or drunker, but that’s by the by).
“no. I don’t know. There’s not much to talk about”
Watching them in earnest now, Draco saw that the lion boys had organised this song between them, as Harry sang “I’m just a poor boy, nobody loves me” and the rest drunkenly responded with “he’s just a poor boy from a poor family, spare him his life from this monstrosity”. For the third time that term, Draco was affronted with the pure unadulterated essence of friendship as he understood the pain behind the lyrics, and the joy with which Harry’s friends sang along with him. If it wasn’t so magnetic, Draco would have pitied himself for the clear lack of this kind of camaraderie and love in his life.  Instead, he drank his whiskey, and grinned back freely from his spot on the floor when Harry grinned down at him.
“Fuck off, Bryn” Harry sighed, closing his eyes briefly.
“I can’t believe I didn’t think of that. I’ll look into it, thank you” Draco said earnestly, wanting to fling his arms around Sirius. In just a few short weeks, Sirius had become to Draco the father he had never had, and now Draco had somewhere to direct all the pent up affection he had once held for his own father.
Draco took her hand and squeezed it, and they lay there in the morning light, drinking hot chocolate and relaxing in each other’s presence. Draco’s heart ached for the love that had been stolen from his mother, and he admired her even more for the strength she must have to raise a family with a man she neither loved nor chose.
Harry laughed delightedly before dragging Draco up to their bedroom, hoping Pansy and Blaise wouldn’t be back to soon.
“I want a pair” said Seamus in awe, and everyone laughed before Harry pushed them out the door.
“Reet lad, I just need you to hold the posts still while I hammer ‘em” Remus said, standing and kicking over the rotted wooden posts before picking up the new ones. He passed one to Draco, showed him the divot in the ground where he was to place it, and then picked up a mallet and got to work.
“It- it wouldn’t?”
“Talgarth likes you” replied Harry, grinning impishly. Malfoy blushed, and Harry thought there may be some truth to the words of his small scaled friend.
“owl your friends. I like cooking and I haven’t practiced real food recently; it’s just been bread and cake. It’s nothing to me, promise, so long as you help lay the table” Harry winked, delighting at how Draco blushed pink- maybe Seamus had a point.
“Seamus baby, that is not my bottom your holding” he said when he opened his eyes.
He hated it; it made him feel vulnerable and exposed. His mindhealer- a French woman his mother had insisted he see over the summer- had explained it was probably due to him associating Potter with too many elements of his freedom; the fiendfyre, the death of Voldemort and ensuing end of the war, the fact that Potter had spoken for Draco and against Lucius; not only gaining Draco freedom from prison but also freedom from his father. She maintained that as time went on and Draco settled into being alive and free from the events of his past, this ‘anxious attachment’ would end. He sincerely hoped it would.
Draco had never showered faster in his life. When he emerged, in a pair of Harry’s trackies and a blondie t-shirt (the joke was not lost on him), Harry was sat on the bed, softly singing along to a song he didn’t know but recognised as Hozier.
“Then, I think he was jealous of my academic ability. Like I said, Ron is really dyslexic and didn’t get a diagnosis until year ten, so the first three years I think he harboured a lot of jealousy towards me, and honestly I encouraged it, unknowingly. I was always so proud of myself, you know? I never shut up when I got good marks or when I got praised and I think it really got to him.
“there's no one else here, Draco.” Harry said, chuckling before growing serious once again.
Draco nodded and led them across the pitch, behind the main castle and across the cloisters to a large stone building, old like humanities house but less grand and more like an abbey. Draco had known since year ten that after every victory (which was, of course, every match) there was an after party, but he had never once received an invite, and though informal, it was very much an invite-only affair.
“Shit. Okay. Okay.” Harry said, bending over and hauling the boy over his shoulder fire-man style. Harry then ran for the stairs as silently as he could, his bare feet making little noise on the carpet.
“yea, I guess I would. They went to Romania with Charlie when he returned. Coming back later today though”
“Honestly Ron, I wouldn’t have come here if I had remembered that this was his school. In all the stress of the move I just completely forgot. I almost had a heart attack when I saw him in the corridor today…” Harry was saying, shrugging his bag off his shoulder and collapsing onto the sofa next to Draco’s.
Harry snorted and Ron said “that’s my girl” before bending down to kiss her cheek, then going back to trying to figure out how to use the camp stove. Harry gave Hermione a brief squeeze before going to help his best mate.
Harry spends a lovely morning unashamedly ogling Charlie Weasley as the two set up what used to be Regulus’ bedroom. The two dragged the bed into the middle of the room from the dark cobwebby corner it had been tucked into. Harry found he enjoyed doing these things without magic. Similarly to baking, but more intense, the physical exertion helped calm him as the burning of his muscles became all he could focus on, preventing him from dwelling too long on the previous habitants of the house. They stripped and re-dressed the bed in neutral purple covers, and then scrubbed the shower in the en-suite until it was sparkling. Charlie then occupied Teddy whilst Harry baked an apple cake, before leaving for the burrow, half the cake wrapped up in his bag for Molly and Arthur.
Now, the music was all that kept him together after the war. With Hermione’s help, he charmed speakers to work without the magic of Grimmauld place interfering, and in the summer after the war he was never alone with his thoughts. He learnt the words to his favourites and would sing along: voice bold and strong on days he saw his friends and was reminded of his future; voice cracked and hoarse with tears on days he remembered all he had lost; voice barely a whisper on nights when his nightmares kept sleep just out of arms reach.
Harry hated Halloween, but that paled in comparison for the love he had for his friends. Sandwiched between Ron and Hermione, lying in the low lamplight, he knew that he was safe, and loved, and that was more than he had ever hoped for. Ron’s arm gripped his bicep, and Hermione’s feet tangled with his and he knew that this is what Lily and James would have wanted for him. He assured Ron and Hermione he would be fine, and that they could leave. They did this every year- he always wanted some time to grieve alone, and they were always loathe to leave him. He adored them for it.

She placed Teddy into Harry’s arms and winked, saying “don’t worry; Daddy Harry is still my all-time favourite” Draco slapped her on the bum, and she giggled before going over and sitting on Blaise’s lap, and leaning over him to talk to Hermione. Harry gently bounced Teddy in his arms and grinned at Ron, motioning for him to sit next to Harry on the sofa. He leaned over to his best mate and whispered into his ear “you’ll get used to the dynamic soon. Bottom line is we all joke about them wanted to have sex with me. Actually, I’m not sure Blaise is always joking.” He said, before turning his attention back to the infant falling asleep in his arms.
Draco could hardly believe what he was hearing. He was so happy to have Lucius out of the picture. If anything happened with him and Harry, now, he could bring Harry home, properly. Not have to hide and sneak about. But- the house was so big for one person for so long.
Ron just scoffed and rolled his eyes, before going back to his own packing.
A heavy melancholy settled over all the eighth year Gryffindor’s as they waited for Ron’s return, his absence a painful reminder that they could not emotionally afford to lose anyone else. Harry and Hermione were everywhere together in the ensuing days, and much to Draco’s delight, Luna spent a lot of her time with him. She would hold Draco’s hand while walking to class, lie on his lap as the fire burnt low in the common room and Draco realised that perhaps this was Luna’s form of companionship, and that the twist of jealousy he felt seeing her and Harry together was entirely unnecessary. With this revelation, a weight that Draco hadn’t even known was there lifted off his shoulders, and he settled into being the male mirror image to Luna’s white hair and porcelain features. They could have been twins, he thought one night as the two sat, nursing mugs of steaming tea and staring at the fire. Both lithe, slim, blond, and somewhat waif-like.
It was Wednesday night and Harry was packing all his stuff up. Because Hogwarts was a private school, they got a whole three and a half weeks off for Christmas hols, and Harry was ecstatic. He was shoving all his clothes and books in his suitcase haphazardly, knowing that later he’d have to sit and fold everything to make it fit, when the door knocked.
Harry tenses, his grip around me going iron-strong. I wince a bit and shift on my feet and he notices and immediately relaxes, entirely in-tuned to my body language as I am to his. I’m response to him tensing, I drape a hand over the back of his shoulders and softly comb my fingers through the hairs at the back of his nape, and I feel his shoulders melt a little at the touch.
“I think that’s the nicest thing anyones ever done for me” he said, and he saw the look that was equal parts happiness and equal parts pity that Sirius gave him.
“Thank you” Draco said, glad when Ron turned to face the wall so he could try the trousers on. To his chagrin, the trousers of Ron’s sister fit him near-perfectly. They sat well on the hips, but they were a few inches too short. Draco guessed it was better than mud and cow pats on his levis.
“Oh, Harry you don’t have to-” Draco started.
“Are you sure?” Sirius asked, hesitantly. “Sure you want to stay here?”
“it’s okay, Harry. Whatever you need to feel better. I understand” Draco said, and he found he really did understand. He imagines himself sharing a bed with Pansy, and knows it’s the same thing.
Harry leave’s Teddy with Draco and heads to Sainsbury’s for ingredients, grabbing some drinks as well, and stocking up on the baking essentials that he uses up at a rate of knots. He arrives home to the heart-warming sight of Draco laying on his stomach on the floor making faces at Teddy, and Teddy giggling and clapping his chubby little hands in excitement. Harry made his way into the kitchen and settled into a long day of cooking. Ron and Hermione came early, and Ron helped him out as Hermione played with the baby.
Break free and Bohemian Rhapsody, both by Queen
Finally, Ron’s brothers spoke a bit of sense into him and he broke up with her, and year thirteen was a bit like a dream. We were all good again, and Ron and I were getting closer and building a better friendship.”
According to muggles, he had an anxiety disorder, which manifested in his brain forcing him to follow certain rules in order to stay safe, after the two years of feeling completely and utterly not safe everywhere he was. He sighed; he had no choice after all. He selected a pair of relatively thin tracksuit trousers, alongside a thin black long-sleeve t-shirt. All too soon he was making his way down to the Great Hall, Pansy’s hand clutched in his, sensing his discomfort.
“of course I’m not over you yet, Draco. I would never have told you how I feel if I had thought those feelings would dissipate in a week, but you seem to be forgetting the fact that you rejected me. I am not so self-pitying or self-flagellating as to sit around and pine celibately over someone who explicitly told me they don’t like me. You said no, and I accepted that. No doesn’t mean try again, or try harder, it means leave it alone and so that’s what I did. If you change your mind, and decide that you do want this, then I’m here to discuss it, but I won’t wait for ever, and I spent the last week coping with rejection and hurt feelings, and while I respect your position completely, I do feel it’s unfair for you to be so angry by me sleeping with someone. You said you didn’t like me, surely you should be happy about this, I don’t understand.”
Draco’s cheeks pinked, and he gaped at Harry open-mouthed until he stuttered out a “alright” and turned back to his mates, who looked as if they were trying not to laugh.
He flopped back onto the bed, and Draco knew that would be his wank fantasy for the foreseeable. He may never want to have sex, but he was a teenage boy enough not to deny himself the simple pleasure of wanking. It was just doing any of that with someone else that he was entirely opposed to.
again, Draco's birthday has been changed on purpose!
Harry shook off his confusion and jogged onto the pitch. He joined the crescent the other boys had formed around their coach, situating himself next to Ron and preparing himself for the gruelling two hours ahead.
It bought a small amount of male satisfaction that Cedric seemed quite desperate for Harry’s company again.
“Weasley, if only Harry liked me the way I want him to” Blaise’s deep voice rumbled, and Harry instinctively knew Ron had turned bright red. He heard Pansy chuckle beside him, and he smiled, wrapping an arm around her.
“Hey, Harry” Ginny said, skipping over to him, leaving Draco behind. Knowing enough of how the cows got milked, Draco just walked into the barn with the milking machine and opened the little gates to allow the first cows through. As he was doing so, he overheard Harry and Ginny’s conversation, and he peeked over the gate to get a look at them as they led the cows out.
Watch out here I come
Luna gently lay Draco down on her lap, carding her fingers through his limp hair, and Draco could see now why Harry could not stay away, it was as if the girl wore draught of peace for perfume.
After a few drinks each, they returned and sat on a bench in the church yard and watched the blackbirds sitting on the graves. Ron began to sing under his breath
“Oh, sweetheart come here. Whatever it is, you can tell me” His mum said, holding out her arms to him. He goes to sit next to her on the sofa, taking her slender, elegant, bejewelled hands in his.
Everyone looked up as McGonagall walked into the eighth-year common room, all noise falling silent. Only around twenty of them had returned. For Draco and Pansy, it had been a condition of their probation, and Blaise had decided to join. Harry and Ron had been strong armed into it by Hermione. Dean, Seamus and Neville were there, alongside Padma. Parvati had stayed at home to help Lavender heal and recover. There were some Ravenclaw’s, and Hufflepuffs, but all in all a very small year.
Remus joined them immediately, dropping a kiss to the top of Sirius’ head before sitting down and dragging the plate of scones towards him.
He made it to English, collapsing into a chair at the empty desk at the back, trying to breathe as quietly as possible and not announce to the whole room how utterly unfit, he was. He needed to start exercising.
“Coming up to six, I reckon” Ron replied, jumping down from the tractor and grabbing the tin from his hands and jogging up to the farmhouse door.
“I'd be honoured to be your first. And second, and third, and hopefully all the ones after” Harry said, and god but Draco could have died on the spot. Instead, all he mustered up was a breathy
Harry’s car sped off, with Ron in it too, and soon enough Draco’s mother’s own Bentley pulled up, and she gracefully stepped out to greet him. She had been chauffeured, as she always was when she came to get him, so they could sit in the back and chat and she wasn’t distracted by trying to drive. It was so good to see her again. She looked happy, too, which was more than he could have hoped for.
“I’m just waiting for him to get closer” she said.
“Hi, mum” Sirius said, giving the woman - his mother? Draco was becoming increasingly confused by this family dynamic- a kiss on the cheek, before ruffling Harry’s hair and sitting down.
Harry was lying next to him, chatting to someone on the phone. Draco couldn’t tell what he was talking about, but was content just to listen to Harry’s deep voice, feel it wash over him in waves whenever Harry responded to whoever he was talking to. Harry hung up, and Draco closed his eyes, feeling floaty. Next thing he knew, lots of bodies were lying next to him on the grass.
Harry sent up a silent prayer to all the gods out there for the strength that allowed him to keep the boy on his shoulder without his body flagging. He heard a door open and close, and risked peeking out of the cupboard door. The adrenaline was fading now, and in its absence, dark memories of another cupboard began to flood his mind, overwhelming him.
A few hours later, the bang of the door to the common startled Draco out of his reverie, and then he heard the unmistakable sounds of Dean shouting, followed by the previously unheard cries of Hermione. He went down to investigate, and saw a stag Patronus dissolve in front of Hermione, clearly having already delivered its message.
That night, Harry collapsed into bed thoroughly exhausted, but he felt hopeful for the future.
He awoke to the sound of giggling, and looked up groggily to see Pansy standing in his doorway in a t shirt that must have been Blaise’s. He wondered why she was laughing until he realised the three of them were on top of the covers, Dean and Seamus in only their underwear and Harry was lying on his stomach with Seamus’ hand on his (luckily pyjama clad) arse. Harry just groaned and closed his eyes when Pansy yelled “Blaise! Get in here, you’ll want to see this”
Harry turned to him, and he once again found himself pinned under the relentless green stare. “oui un petit peu, mais j’voudrais ameliorer donc je me suis inscrite pour la classe” replied Harry, in a flawless accent. (yes, a little bit but I would like to improve so I signed up for the class)
” he said to his new pet “
They watched 10 Things I Hate About You first, followed by She’s The Man, and Remus knocked with a tray of sandwiches for their dinner, and a promise to try and talk to Harry a little bit more, which Draco thought was a little unnecessary. Harry hadn’t done anything but dislike him, which barely felt like a crime, even if it wasn't that nice for Draco himself. He felt like he’d caused a lot of aggro and for no reason.
Harry was mid-way through getting dressed when Hermione called Ron into the bathroom, needing help zipping up her dress. Harry winked at him- that was a sure sign she liked him.
Harry sighed and sat back on his haunches.
“I’m touched you trust me with your baby, Potter but unfortunately I’m scared I would injure it gravely. Best let Mrs Weasley stay in control”
“Crush? I don’t know what you mean”
Soon they were all full and feeling slightly sick at the amount of sugar, with slightly singed mouths and fingertips. It was nice. Harry felt like he could fall asleep right there. He heard Hermione humming, the vibrations going through his shoulder. He joined in, his deep rumbling hum complimenting her higher one. The fire was enchanting, the light and the intense heat and the crackling embers were comforting. Harry felt like he could sit there forever. He knew, though, that if he didn’t go to bed soon, he would fall asleep right there and wake up with frostbite and covered in slugs.
“It's bloody party central here” he grumbled to himself as he left his bedroom to go and open it. Hermione stood on the doorstep  holding a bundle of blankets.
“I had no idea mate. It's cool they all went here though. Remus must have as well.” came Ron’s voice from behind him.
I want your love
“Honestly? Yeah” Harry replied, holding his hand out for the joint. Draco kept it a bit longer though, taking a second inhale and relishing a little in making Harry wait before passing it back. Harry smoked with his eyes closed for a few minutes, and Draco drank in the sight before him.
“Aye, that he did,” Harry replied. Draco marvelled at the thick Yorkshire accent and was scared to speak lest they laugh at his accent as well.
God, he had missed her.
In the dark, Draco’s cheeks burned with shame and desire. Of course Potter didn’t want him, he was just being nice and saviour-y. he did, however, have a point, and Draco shuffled over in his sleeping bag until he was as close as he could get to Potter without touching. He closed his eyes to try and sleep, despite knowing that the proximity to Potter would be too distracting.
With this, she swept out of the room with a swish of her robes that would have made even Snape envious.
“I didn’t bring anything else” he said, angry at himself for how pathetic he sounded.
“Look mate, here. We’ll sneak Hermione and Luna in here before the ball starts, take photos, then you can wear a normal school shirt underneath. Molly will never have to know.”
“Yeah. No ones ever organised me a party before, other than my mum when I was maybe five” Draco said, turning slightly so he could face Harry more without disturbing Pansy’s nap.
“That sounds great! What day, because Draco’s busy Thursday.” Harry responds and I see Peterson take the opening, not knowing what’s coming.
Lucius was never allowed to know that Draco was gay. Ideally, he would die, leave Draco a fuckton of money, and then Draco could fall in love in peace. He hoped that at uni he could escape his father’s shadow, but he knew that many of the old doddery fellows at both oxford and Cambridge would report back on Draco’s every move.
Blaise came back every summer with tales of conquests made in Italy. Of steamy kisses and tan skin in the piazzas of Rome. Of shared ice-cream and sea-scented hotel rooms along the southern coast.
“thanks ‘mione, you make it sound amazing. It will be fun, I think.”
“What? Harry no. I’ve been watching them flirt with you for the last five years. I know you don’t encourage it. It just, god it makes me feel so shit, you know? That they don’t see me as a legitimate partner, that they think they’re sooo much better than the ex-deatheater that you’ll leave me for them at the drop of a hat. It makes me feel like no one sees me as a person, you know?”
This is more than just the equivalent of the American muggle ‘promise ring’. By laying your claim upon someone, you ensure that no one else in Hogwarts can ever court them, or be physically intimate with them. In recent years, this has been used to ensure that adolescent flings are safe from the grabby hands of other conniving Slytherins, or by some stupid children, securing a Yule Ball date.
“do you want me to stay, like last night?” harry asked gently
“So long as you’re comfortable darling” Pansy said, smoothing a hand down his chest.
“Happy Birthday!!!” she screamed at him, kissing his cheeks in rapid succession.
“I’m going to fucking kill him.” She announced to the room, before opening her arms to Draco, who collapsed into them with a near-silent whimper.
“Some of Molly’s boys are here to help Remus around the farm, so you’ll meet them later. Ron’s older brothers. I thought today I would take you round the local village and get to know my cousin a bit better”
“I’ve not kecks that’ll fit him” Harry said and Ron nodded and said “Ginny might, though they’ll be short”
“my, my.  Wank bank material for weeks right here. It would be months, but Potty dearest is wearing a few too many clothes for my liking” Blaise’s deep voice rumbled through the room.
Harry nodded, squeezed Draco’s arm and went back to the kitchen. He and Pansy iced the cake when it was ready, and just as they finished, the floo chimed. Harry ushered Pansy into the living room, settling her onto the sofa, where Blaise wrapped an arm around her. He all but shoved his friends into the kitchen, before turning to put on a film for the Slytherins. He chose the jungle book, purely because it was almost two hours long and he needed the time to recover. He cast a muffliato on the kitchen door before collapsing into a chair.
You look like your lots of fun
“Ron could never, my boy.”
He felt the bed beside him dip, and a hand grip his. He smelt the awful ethanol of muggle liquor, and knew it must be Draco. Luna had told him how Draco had drunk when Harry was injured, but Harry didn’t know how to talk to Draco about it without shattering the tentative thing that was between them. He heard Draco heave a sigh and then gently slurred French filled his ears, fumbled words of comfort from someone who clearly didn’t know what to say, but Harry was touched that Draco was trying. Harry started at Draco’s declaration of love, but knew at the way the blond went tense beside him that not only was it genuine, but that it had also been accidental, so Harry spared Draco the embarrassment, and continued to cry in the darkness.
“Draco! Draco shit its teddy he’s vomiting properly and he’s all hot and he keeps crying. I’m going to saint Mungo’s with him now, but I need you to floo to the burrow and get Molly then bring a bag of his favourite toys with you and Molly to the hospital”
“No, no not at all. I mean, Diggory is fit” Draco said, before clamping his mouth shut, realising he sort-of-almost-accidentally outed himself. Theo, Greg, Vince and Blaise knew, but were under strict instructions not to tell anyone. Aside from the inevitable “so long as you don’t fancy me” comments, they had been decent about it, which was more than Draco had expected.
The pain Draco heard in Harry’s voice forcefully reminded the blond of all the people Harry had lost, and he wanted to reach out in comfort to the boy on the other bed, hold him and soothe his troubles away- never mind that Draco was likely the source of most of them.
Harry heard Ron cough and splutter behind him. “what the actual fuck was that Harry?” Ron said when Harry turned. His face was almost as red as his hair and he looked distinctly confused and uncomfortable. Harry just laughed and kissed Pansy on the cheek before setting her down and turning to Blaise.
Harry let the song fill him up, and the adrenaline he always felt before a night like this kicked in, and he opened his mouth
Draco leant his head on the cool porcelain of the loo seat and slurred “I’m so sorry Harry, I ruined your new year’s. Go and kiss your girlfriend and leave me I’ll be fi-“ here, Draco demonstrated how very not fine he was by surging up to chun again.
“can I help clear up?” the blond asked, looking very uncomfortable.
The blond instantly yielded, sighing and melting into Harry’s body. The kiss was soft, intimate, gentle. Harry cradled Malfoy’s face with his hands, revelling at the softness of Malfoy’s cheeks, the soft strands of his hair tickling Harry’s knuckles. After not nearly long enough, Harry pulled back, and whispered “sleep” against Malfoy’s lips, before turning Malfoy around, and wrapping his arm around the blond’s middle, pulling their bodies flush together. He heard Malfoy sigh contentedly, and Harry kissed the nape of his neck before closing his eyes.
“All right lad, let’s go, Harry’ll be up on the fell with Remus. We had two lambs in the night, so three more  t’come” Ron said, leaving the house with Draco and setting a punishing pace through the fields.
They sat down for cake, Teddy eating more marzipan in his highchair, and Harry smiled at Draco. Hesitantly, Draco offered a soft, gentle smile in return, and Harry knew then that everything would turn out okay. Draco was still here, still smiling at him, and that's what matters.
Draco choked. So, when Harry said dangerously close… he really meant it.
Draco falls asleep there, his mother’s voice enveloping him, her hand soft and gentle in his hair. Maybe, just maybe, he thinks as his eyes close, it might turn out alright.
After dinner, he went to Blaise’s room with Theo where their little group convened for what they called ‘Nabini wine nights’. It had started in year ten when Theo and Blaise had shared a dorm, and they would each bring wine back, tucked into their suitcases, rolled into jumpers and hidden in welly boots and the like, and each Saturday the group of five- Draco, Blaise, Theo, Greg, and Vince would drink roughly about 2-3 bottles between them, just hanging out and chatting.
“So polite” Sirius laughed. “You can call me Sirius”
“you don’t ever need to apologise Harry, but it’s fine. And anyway look on the bright side, this trip has so much potential. I used to camp with my parents all the time as a child and I miss it dearly. It will be the three of us again, but completely danger free. We can make a fire and have marshmallows and hot chocolate and Kendall mint cake for the hike.”
‘oh but she loves, like sleep to the freezing. Sweet and right and merciful I’m all but washed in the tide of her breathing’
Draco was surprised at the quality of Harry’s singing, and stopped his unpacking to listen. He turned his head at the line ‘oh my lovely, baby you’re all I see’  and saw two half-lidded green eyes behind owlish glasses looking back at him. He nodded his head at the raven, mimicking their earlier interaction and went back to his unpacking, not quite ready to face his (and the worlds, he supposed, but he guiltily enjoyed thinking of Harry as his) saviour. The soft music filled the room around him, and he found he didn’t hate the intrusion; in fact he found it rather calming to line all his beloved books on a shelf while bobbing his head to the tune.
The house looked so warm and inviting, with a resplendent Holly wreath hanging on the front door. He couldn’t wait for the warmth. It was such a long walk from the nearest bus stop because Draco really lived in the middle of bloody nowhere in the British countryside. It’s the sort of place that should be a national trust house, not the family home of someone Harry went to school with. It was all so at odds with his life at the Dursley’s he found it hard to believe sometimes.
“I can’t come to see you?” Pansy had flirted. Harry just looked at her, and she laughed.
By the end of the night, Dean once again had his head down the toilet, joined by Seamus this time, the Irish boy propped over the sink as Harry alternated between comforting the two of them, forcing water down their throats between bouts of chunning. Draco couldn’t help but admire his thoughtfulness, the gentleness with which he tended to his friends as they groaned and complained, despite their intoxication being their own faults. They were teenagers though, Draco supposed, and after living through a war so young they deserved every chance to let their hair down.
Soon, Blaise decided Pansy had had enough, and so Harry stood up to show them their room. Draco tried to stand too but fell again immediately.
“come here” Harry said, voice low and rough. Draco walked over, and slid his hands over Harry’s dark chest. Harry kissed Draco with fervour, before stepping back to say, “I want to see you in skirts more often.”
“God here I am complaining about my parents not liking each other and yours are dead what the fuck is wrong with me”
“Mr Potter this looks awfully proper. I do hope you didn’t order this in on our account.” Said Narcissa, staring at the food in front of her.
The thoughts filled his mind as he stared unseeingly at Draco's blond head atop his chest, disbelieving, until half-lidded and drowsy quicksilver eyes sluggishly stared up at him.
So this was what the 'mediator' was about? Calming his maddened and disturbed countenance? And Harry really had to be within fifty meter or less with Malfoy or so he'd blow up the entire Hogwarts with his undulating emotions.
“Oh, that is so convenient, Weasley. I am so stupid not to checked it first before senselessly shitting my pants worrying about him. Thanks for the very useful advise!”
"There is certainly an issue of consent concerning the Histrionicus Potions," Hermione said assertively, lips pursing in a determined line Harry had seen countless of times during her S.P.E.W. discourse. After they were dismissed from Potions class, most students sporting flushed faces in either annoyance or embarrassment, the Trio had went straight to the eighth year Common Room, lounging by the fire, and wondering what to do for the entire free afternoon. Or in Hermione's case, laying out her dogmas regarding inequality.
"I had my whole life ahead of me, so many goals I wanted to achieve, but his senseless kowtowing to the evil madman and overambitious quest for power had took all of my chances to make a name for myself in the Wizarding society. He was my father, and the love that he claimed was the reason why he'd done what he did had just put our whole family to almost peril. And now me and mother had to suffer the aftermath of his farcical ingratiating to a lunatic dark lord and now I'm probably the next to die!"
Almost two hours later and it was Malfoy's turn to brew the
"I couldn't believe Snape have not care to fix such compromising imprecision!" She continued, bushy hair getting wilder as she attempted to flip it before falling back down her face. "For whatever clinical trials he had boasted, this project seemed to be bordering on slavery. He disregarded the discrepancies of the human emotions and how it would be an antecedent for jeopardizing the person's constitutional rights to autonomy!"
“Tell me about it, Harry.”
"Mate, you were staring at Malfoy for minutes earlier. Ginny practically shouted at your ears. Do you know what this reminds me of?" Ron shared a knowing look with Hermione. Harry felt agitated.
Narcissa's calculating eyes fixed both men with phlegmatic skepticism before she sharply turned and lead the way. Harry's breath evaded his lungs at the sight of the formidable manor. It was like being pulled back into the memory; the iron grip around both his arms as Greyback and the snatchers had pulled him and his friends across the huge lane, the fear that had threatened to overcome him when they were surrounded with Death Eaters who were more than willing to call Voldemort, the panic that rose in his throat when Draco...
"Had the decency to look afraid now, you idiot boy?" Snape snapped nastily. Harry had an exaggerated pout on his face. Severus turned to glare at Draco. "Tell me Draco, did you just brought this dunderhead here for me to be an unfortunate spectator to his disgustingly outrageous displays—"
, right? There are a lot of things you could use your mouth other than snarking at my ex."
Harry marched ahead, not caring if Malfoy would deign to follow him or not.
“Of course you do.” Draco hated Pansy’s condescending voice. “You’re always a little too peculiar when it comes to Potter.”
When Snape's instructions said the
"I don't understand you, Harry. If you can't stop obsessing over that evil Death Eater scum then I would never try to talk to you again."
Ginny hadn't physically changed since the last time they both stood under this same tree. She was still the same beautiful and brave girl Harry had fallen for before, with flaring red hair that framed her face perfectly and a strong and assertive personality that Harry loved about her. Even as they stare at each other right now, with the memories of the war and all the chaotic emotions between them, Harry's heart still beat for her glowing smile, seized by the gloomy wistfulness that run into him in waves.
"Well, I might've neglected to inform you too that you have no say in this. You are going with me whether you like it or not, Potter," Draco hissed, a snarl heavily contorting his features. Harry raised his hands to placate him.
Their decrepit population was mostly due to the War. Because of the majority of them, and their families, being Death Eaters or were just involved with the wrong sorts even before, it wasn't really a surprise that more than half of the House had decided to flee the Slytherin hostility of the whole Wizardry. Though, Harry thought, those who decided to come back for 8th year were just as surprising; Zabini, Greengrass, Parkinson, Nott, Bulstrode, and of course, Malfoy.
, on the other hand—while Malfoy's
Harry slowly shook his head. He didn't think it's appropriate to talk about their tangled past, potentially destroying the temporary peace and contentment between them. Harry loved this limited safe space,
"Now, that's not very nice, Draco!" Harry–
Harry was a frazzled ball of unconfined nerves as he gripped the Marauders’ map and trudged along the empty and long corridors of Hogwarts. He had just left the amiable (and inebriated) congregation of eighth and seventh years in the Three Broomsticks, too jittery to sit through and share their drunken revelry. It was just half past midnight, just what Harry needed to venture the hallways without unceremoniously bumping into students as he was too focused on the ceaselessly moving name in the same corridor in front of a wall where Harry had suspected Draco frequented in sixth year.
Even Harry himself felt his patience thinning at the absurdness of the masses and the frustrating predicament they were in. It was probably a right timing that he was about to take a mediating potion rather than the amplifying one. Merlin knows what he'll do...
Malfoy was rather quiet during the whole brewing process. And Harry didn't know if it's frustrating or unnerving. On the other hand, Malfoy's constant insults and jabbing at his potion skills (or lack thereof) in the past had only pressured him. Malfoy had only made a comment the whole night, and that was to politely correct Harry when he almost mistakenly added the Fanged Geranium after the Powdered Moonstone instead of the Snake Fang. So maybe it was a good thing that he had to keep his snarky mouth shut for once.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were once again situated in their usual space in the Library,  tons of books surrounding their table area. Harry stared at his Transfiguration essay, a badly-written one, and groaned. He placed his head in his hands and wondered, not for the first time, how it would be if he didn't come back. Maybe he wouldn't be in the Auror Academy, maybe he would brood his entire summer, or life, in solitude in Grimmauld Place, or maybe he'd waste away his life in Muggle London, away from the aggravating paparazzis and the sodding Daily Prophet who made it their life-goal to write silly scuttlebutts about him.
"I thought it was supposed to be tomorrow?" Malfoy deadpanned, and even his voice, Harry morosely noted, had lost its once condescending drawl.
"This is fucking ridiculous," Harry groaned and walked to the door. It was to Malfoy's expressionless face when he opened it. "Aren't you going to come inside?"
of talk if given the choice. He just have to settle with what he can get.
. He knew the endearment that is clearcut in his face couldn't just be willed away, so he let it be shown. He wanted Draco to see it. He didn't know why.
"What the fuck have you done, Potter?!" Harry was saved from getting pounced on by the Slytherin girl by Zabini, as he held back her growling friend before she could reach Harry.
, self-righteously claimed that this wasn't his fault; that it was Dumbledore's for being such a meddling, old fool; that it was Ginny's for not being so understanding and not seeing how much Harry and her weren't on the same page anymore. And hearing
“I just... want him to sleep,” he murmured, angry at himself but too tired to lash out.
Draco seethed, wanting to give Severus a piece of his mind, but Harry pulled on his arms incessantly. After removing 50 points from both their Houses, Severus slammed the door to their faces.
The second time, he jolted himself awake. The first rays of the sunrise emerged from the horizon, dousing the whole room with muted light. Harry felt the disorientation from sleep clouding his mind, the dregs of the night's worth of uninterrupted rest clung to his consciousness. He barely registered another person's body next to him, their gangly and sharp limbs sprawled atop his body, tufts of blonde hair tickling his chin. His eyes drooped, succumbing back to sleep, until it dawned on him.
"We all were tortured in some ways. Specially if we went against the Carrows' orders," Ginny said, sighing. "And... Pansy was there. She used to gave me chocolates to make me feel better every time I got Crucio'd by one of the Slytherins. It got worse that she had to heal some bruises and cuts when I was punished everytime I refused to torture some first and second years."
"And father... he never did a thing to prevent it. He was just there, watching as his son and wife was suffering. In the end, even if he was a shell of the man he once was, I knew where his loyalties lain. And even if it took both my life and mother's, he will always choose Voldemort's side."
Harry supposed he wasn't late for lunch, so he made a detour to the Great Hall instead of going his initial plan of having to lunch down in the Kitchens.
"Malfoy," Harry called again. "We were supposed to brew the potion this evening."
The last thing he remembered thinking about before falling into a fitful of sleep last night (or the early morning) was Malfoy's vacant and dull expression throughout the brewing of their potions. And, surprise surprise! It had bugged Harry to no end. And staring at Malfoy during lunch offered a lot of opportunity to wonder what in buggering hell is going on with his once arch rival.
"Are you just going to continue staring off space like a dunderhead buffoon or I have to lecture you about the basics of locomotion because you're much of a nitwit than you let on?"
Harry almost jump, and he realized it must've been weird and creepy outright staring at his own nemesis and wondering why in buggering hell can't he get this year normal.
"But I didn't care. Because family pride mattered to me more than anything. You wouldn't understand but it's the reason why most Slytherins followed in the footsteps of their parents because family ideals held so much weight to us more than our morality. And I didn't mind much of Lucius' ruthless drills to bring out the perfect son, because in my innocent mind it was just the right method to instill perfection. Because I believed I was doing it for the family. Because I was hoping that one day, my father would see me like the son that he wanted. So I did every thing that he asked of me. I antagonised you and your friends because he said so. I denounced Muggles and Muggleborns and saw them inferior because he said so. I convinced myself that I wanted to become a Death Eater because he said so.
Harry's murky Augmentare Histrionicus obviously resembled what he was currently feeling. And it was no wonder. Harry was downcast the entire brewing process, weary and monotonously moving along their workbench, too detach from the present that he was astonished he brewed his Augmentare right and not blowing up the whole cauldron. It was through Malfoy's mercy that they had to imbibe their potions the next day.
Harry sagged even more against the seat, the swirling rage inside of him barely restrained. At least it was restrained. For now, though.
"That's good, Harry," Hermione said, pleased.
Harry was looking forward to the blond putting up a fight because he was such a prat until they would snap at each other, insulting and jabbing and raising their voices, before Madam Pince would kick their asses out of the library, and then they would throw hexes at each other in the corridor.
Um. What?
Harry walked the distance between them and gripped Malfoy's collar, "so you mean we'll have to be with each other all the fucking time?"
"I'm not sure I will," Harry told him, traces of fear contorting his face. Draco cupped his face. Harry stared at his beseeching eyes.
“He and I... flew together.”
Draco's behavior was becoming more and more fiercely antagonistic, targeting unsuspecting students, mostly first and second year Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors, spitting nonsense about their Muggleborn blood, their Houses and clothing tastes.
Severus' posture was too comical, if Draco was in his right mind he would laugh at his godfather's expanse. Severus had his hand on his hips and another cradling his temple, a palpable expression of exhaustion on his face.
"I was repeatedly calling you. What are you even staring—" she turned to the direction Harry was initially paying all his attention to. Immediately her face fell sour. "Malfoy? Why are you staring at the evil git?"
, Harry shook his head. Harry grinned in satisfaction when Draco indulged himself with a plate of treacle tart from the collection of sweets Harry asked Kreacher to prepare earlier.
“Okay,” Dianne nodded in understanding. “What about doing things you once do. What are your hobbies, Harry?”
"Remember what we brewed last week? It was particularly nasty. This time would probably be worse," Harry replied, as they turned the corner leading to the Potions classroom. The small number of Slytherins already stood outside.
Not too good on the emotional aspect, was what his mind-healer diagnosed. Years of repressed emotions had reduced his ability to feel them. And, of course, diminished his sense of self-preservation. Hence all the stupid self-destructive streak.
Harry glowered at Ron, "I don't have a bloody blond paramour, Ron!" He sighed heavily, raking his hands through his already nest for a hair. "She asked me to go with her at that wretched place. And I can't have it in me to bring her down, Ron. It was the first time I've seen her face glowing happily in months."
Harry’s skin had darkened a few shades over the summer since the last time Draco had seen him during the trials; he was unhealthily pale before, a perfect representation of someone that just emerged out of a war, but the summer had done Harry good. Draco wondered what he was up to during the months after the war to had such a glorious tan, probably wrenching out gnomes at the back garden of the Weasley residence. Draco snickered lightly at the visual.
"My promise of skinning your ass and feeding it to the giant squid still stands, you know," he added to Severus. Draco turned to Harry, glaring.
“Draco, I’m not... you’re not—”
"Forgive me, Severus," Albus said after a few minutes. "I know that you mean well, but is this not a bit counterproductive?"
“That was what I was asking, Granger. I don’t know where he is,” Draco replied waspishly. “I thought you must’ve seen him walked by as there was no other way he could’ve gone out of the Common Room. Unless if he could fly, which is highly unlikely even if he is the bloody Savior.”
Harry didn't have any time to think about Malfoy when the term started. He knew Malfoy was different when he came back for eighth year, no one could really ignore how Malfoy passed on the opportunity to torment Harry and his friends when Malfoy, before, had always been there, always the persistent blithering figure in Harry's life for the past seven years.
Malfoy continued writing the ingredients and processes of both potions on his parchment, not acknowledging Harry's presence as if it were something not worth overreacting for (at least for the dramatic git's part). He just continued... writing.
At the end of Harry's speech, Draco's face screwed up with a mixture of uncertainty, fear, sorrow and disbelief. Draco's eyes showed how conflicted he was, the small part of him that had survived and grew up from a detrimental battle was waging war with the greater part of him that was damaged by his childhood. But beneath it, Harry found a sliver of hope. A sob wreaked out of Draco's defeated form as he lowered his hand, his grip loosening until the wand dropped to the grass. Harry pulled Draco into an embrace, and at the barest of touch, heartbreaking cries flowed out of Draco's trembling mouth like the force of water from a broken dam, and it echoed in and tainted the once magically peaceful place.
"It should be something obvious even to someone with mind of an erumpent, Potter. The deaths have been going on for months, there is no viable reason why every Death Eaters in Azkaban turned up dead because of some nitty-gritty illness."
And what Draco had been is not really that relevant at all. What mattered is the Draco who realized everything that he had been taught was wrong, and was rectifying the somehow impossibly deeper hole that was dug by his parents by not identifying Harry even under the threat of his and his family’s lives. The moment in the Malfoy Manor—when Draco looked down at his disfigured face and still knowing it was him, his eyes were filled with conflict, fear, anger and a little bit of hope—was important for Draco’s development as his own person. There had been the smallest moment when Harry feared it would be their end, that Draco would be tempted by the prospect of the false glory Lucius promised him by acknowledging Harry. But Draco proved himself that he was not evil after all, that he could make a choice for himself and choose the right thing to do, and the little hope Harry’d seen in Draco’s eyes is the hope he had for Harry to save everyone from Voldemort.
Draco's blond hair was messy and whipped by the wind. It was the first time Harry find Draco's hair so mussed up. He was wearing a Slytherin green sweater with streaks of black and silver on the sides. Harry's throat worked up at the sight of the blond's sharp shoulder and collar bones peaking out as the neckline of his cashmere sweater fell off his shoulder. It was an odd sight, Draco daring to look so comfortable and so distinct from his usual formal, pompous robes. He looked so delicate and beautiful.
There was a tiny pained squeak before the animal was sprawled on the grass, its body uncontrollably shaking under the strength of Draco's curse. Harry tried to shout, but he found his throat was gripped with shock and panic it rendered him speechless and immobile.
"You have my favorite line memorized!" Hermione gasped in disbelief. "And it's your chosen recreational activity! That's unbelievable."
"Is that
Harry didn't even try to keep up with Draco's steps, just let him get dragged toward the eighth year tower. The havoc of mental dolefulness and heavy dread slammed into him full force, making him dizzy and distressed. His chest breathed in and expanded, air sharp against his sternum. Harry didn't even register the buzzing in his ears until he was surrounded with what he knew were voices but distorted, as they reached the eight year Common Room.
Even as the whole dorm fell silent and dark, and most occupants were deep asleep or pretending to be, Harry stared vacantly at the ceiling, the look on Malfoy's eyes never leaving his mind until past five in the morning.
The events from last night cleared his sleep-addled mind and he realised there was a warm weight pressed on top of him.
"Ridiculous. So let's just forget all the sleepless nights stalking Draco in sixth year on the Marauder's map. But you're not ready for that discussion, are you?" Ginny teased. Before Harry could do more than argue, her face turned serious. "Malfoy came to me earlier after the Quidditch game. He apologized for the things he said about my family, for what happened to Bill and Fred. He offered assistance, if I need some. And I just felt tired at that moment. Tired of blaming him for something out of his control. Tired of the grief, of thinking about the people who were dead. And Malfoy was there, trying so hard to be a decent human for once, and I just can't be the one, no matter how I've hated him in the past, to not give him a chance; someone who was born entitled and unfamiliar to the concept of apologizing."
"Or else what?" Draco sneered, unable to help himself. "You can't leave me, Potter. Even if I treat you like an appalling House-elf, just like what you deserved to be treated, the potion would not allow you."
"Draco," Harry called quietly, but just as firmly. Draco turned to look at him, his quicksilver eyes were filled with guilt and shame. Harry tucked a few loose strands of wavy locks behind Draco's ear, appreciating how beautiful Draco looked, fucking glowing in the firelight. "It isn't your fault, okay? You were grieving, that's understandable. And you had just drank a potion to augment what you're feeling. Well... the Unforgivables should've been avoided, but it's not as if anyone should know about that."
It was a tender, tentative touch, yet Harry felt like floating so high up in the sky he thought he won't be able to come down.
"Of course you're allowed to be in a good mood, Harry," Hermione said. Harry pretended he didn't saw her stepping on Ron's foot under the table. "It's a welcoming change. It's just that..." at that, she shared another look with Ron, now tinge with nervousness. Harry suppressed a sigh, vaguely knowing where this was going. Hermione waved her wand, encasing them in a bubble of Muffling charm. "We were worried for you, Harry. I know you always feel downcast during Halloween, and that you want to be alone with yourself and your thoughts. And that is okay, that is completely understandable. We can always respectfully give you some space. But you can't just always distract yourself away from your pain and emotional negativity. It isn't healthy, Harry. It's been going on for months. And don't expect us to not notice all those months after the war wasting away in Muggle bars, sleeping with anyone so callously! I mean, there isn't anything wrong with shagging anyone you like. But this coping mechanism isn't good for you at all, and certainly not in the long run. I knew it's getting lonely, but you don't have to be alone because you have us. We just wanted to help, Harry. We're your best friends; your
, technically, but yeah," Harry immediately said, although it's due to the fact that he was shocked to be addressed directly by the people who once bullied them but now became recluse and oddly subdued. Then he immediately felt defensive, "is their something wrong with that?"
Before she could reply, he turned on his feet and walk away... towards Malfoy.
The relief in Ginny's face was so palpable and infectious that Harry found himself grinning. He felt like the guilt that was weighing heavily in his guts for months was finally relieved, his chest brimming with warmth.
Harry could practically hear the collective gulps in apprehension from the whole class when they saw the sadistic glint in the Professor's eyes. Harry wondered what they've written on their accounts of the potion for them to get nervous about. He had written what he wanted Snape to read under the influence of the potions, like
“Wait, ‘Mione. You don’t supposed to show this git,” he glared warily at Draco, who was grasping for the tiniest bit of patience left of him, “Harry’s precious... map, do you?”
, in your life, Potter. Because you treating everyone the way you do is the reason why they all left you."
Right then, as they were ensconced by the warmth of the fire and of each other, Harry realised that Draco was more damaged than he let on. Draco had been cruel not just because of his upbringing, but also because cruelty had been the only thing that he'd experienced all his life from the person that he looked up to the most. He had been aggressively self-assertive by being haughty and disdainful to overcompensate his feelings of being inferior to his father. He was filled with hatred and he wasted no time showing it to others because it had been showed to him by the person that was supposed to love him in return. All the problematic things that Draco did to Harry, his friends and other people cannot be justified, but despite the bad things, Draco is not a bad person. He had been a victim of abuse, his father had neglected Draco's welfare for the sake of influence and power and it had been going on for years that Draco developed complexes that had became his defense mechanism.
Harry had just cocked everything up.
Seamus fell off the bench, apparently awake to catch on that bit of news, clutching his stomach in his rancorous laughters that echoed in the now speculative silence of the Great Hall. Ron's face was red, very much disconcerted at the thought of their very stern Professor fawning over Saturnine's forlorn lines. Hermione only gaped at him.
Harry had not slept. For days now. There were times he almost did, almost falling into the unconsciousness that his body had craved for days—
“Yes. It was, uh, nice,” he replied, the picture of Malfoy’s grinning face at the forefront of his mind. “And I, er, flew with someone.”
"Pansy's not that bad, Ronald," Hermione admonished lightly, earning an appalled look from Ron.
"Well, I don't know, Severus," Draco smoothly cut off Harry's statement. "If it's really unfortunate of you, then I have the pleasure to have you a spectator to this
“So, where’s Potter?” She asked lightly, trying and failing to sound casual. Apparently, she has a tact of a mountain troll. “You wouldn’t want to leave him alone. Merlin knows what things he might blow up unattended.”
Harry slept relatively fast and smooth, Draco's beautiful face in the forefront of his closed eyes and the remnants of the besotted grin tugging on his lips.
Harry stopped when he realized he's all alone.
"I guess I was just too focused on our past together that I forgot we are not the same person we were before," Ginny softly said, eyes glazing as if reminiscing the small time she and Harry shared before circumstances ruined it. There was a sad smile tugging at her lips; not of misery for their lost love but of one filled with regret and longing, not unlike Harry's.
Harry knew that the potion was wearing off because a mixture of shame, self-loathe, embarrassment and anger contorted the blond's face. Harry started to feel the after-effects of the suppressed emotions. Anger was clawing at his control.
"What made you think I would like to be in the ceremony?" Harry bluntly asked. There is no way he would want to see Lucius again, even if it's for the last time. He might think the man doesn't deserve to be killed but there are a lot of things Lucius Malfoy did that couldn't be buried with him six feet below the ground. Apparently, it was the wrong thing to say as Draco's feigned pleasant expression fell.
"I'm not a fucking glass," Draco softly said before he walked away.
. He guesstimated that it was still between 3 or 4 in the morning. He certainly wasn't in the mindset to question the arm that draped over his hip and the warmth of the body pressed behind him or the fact that he was sleeping for the first time without trembling after the vivid nightmares. Harry felt so relaxed and calm, sleep beckoned him back into unconsciousness that he didn't wonder at the sheer strangeness of it all.
"It isn't your fault," Malfoy suddenly said, as if reading Harry's mind, his face serene. Harry almost snap at him but the blond held his hand and massaged it.
fading Dark Mark on his left arm. It was still the same horrid ink, contrastingly dark on Draco’s pale skin, but it wasn’t moving. Still, Harry’s breath hitched at the sight.
Not being able to cry after witnessing the deaths of Cedric and Sirius and so many others during the war was, apparently, not normal and an indicative of a deeper, sinister psychological scar.
"So, I'll meet you here after lunch?" Malfoy nodded his head. "Right. Good night then."
Draco Malfoy, in his broom up in the air, shining under the sunset, is so fucking beautiful. He was always so beautiful, but with no potion in Harry's system, there was nothing that he could blame on why he found Draco such an... enchanting and captivating sight to behold. Harry gripped the handle of his broom tightly, his stomach lurching that he knew has nothing to do with flying.
"You know mate," Ron said. "If you have no intentions to get back with my sister, you might as well tell her. She's obviously expecting you both get back with each other since the war ended."
“Stop sounding like he’s... a wild animal or something.”
"Come on, mate," Ron rolled his eyes, but there is gentleness in his smile. "Even if I'm still grieving for Fred, I wouldn't be selfish enough not hear you out on and help you with what you're feeling. We're all in this, Harry. We've always been, since 1991."
"Until after the potions wear off which will take about half the day," Malfoy gently removed Harry's hands off him. "Unless you want to blow off the whole castle, you'll have to be with me to calm you down."
"Good for you to graze us with your
For the life of him, he wouldn't even dare trade this temporary sense of security and freedom for the world. He desperately asked for normalcy, and maybe a ten feet or so of Transfiguration essay was part of the package.
“Don’t be such a dolt, Pansy,” Draco grumbled, fingers fiddling the hem of his sweater, scrabbling through the higgledy-piggledy of his thoughts. “It’s emotionally toilsome. Being the mediator, I mean.”
"All you do is bully me," Harry said, wanting to sound humorous but his voice cracked in the end, coming off a croaked confession, tone heavily laced with hurt. Harry gulped as Draco tightened his hold on him, enough to convey what he felt: regret, grudging acknowledgement. Something akin to apology, but not quite. "I'm sorry. I just..."
The rest of the day passed by in a daze.
Ron was already up and dressed when Harry stepped out of their bathroom.
, she'll be a Quidditch player. And a very great one at that, Harry could just see it.
"Malfoy's shit his pants," Ron snickered. Hermione gave him the evil eye.
They stopped just outside the library, Malfoy stared straight ahead the empty corridor and Harry stared intently at Malfoy's side profile. Harry couldn't deny the fact that Malfoy had grown out of his aristocratic, ferrety sharpness. Of course, Malfoy still had the high cheekbones and jaws that could cut and long, aristocratic nose but his face was just on the right side of sharpness brought on by maturity. Without the haughty sneers and his head being held so cockily high, Malfoy's features were... elegant, with a touch of masculinity and softness. It was odd.
“What are you thinking, Harry,” Draco said sternly. “Why have you gone off—”
That was the first thing Draco said (shouted) upon barging inside Severus' sleeping chambers. It was a blessing that Severus had just buttoned his robes close. Draco had a moment to remember Harry's statement about
"I'm a fucking mess, am I? I caused so much trouble today. You even see me," he paused, clearly uncomfortable recounting what their day had been, "losing myself, which is so unbefitting. I even went so far as to steal your wand to cast... Unforgivables," he whispered the last word in horror, face paling in nausea. "And I dragged you to my father's funereal, which is just so insensitive. Merlin, Harry. I'm so, so sorry—"
"You seem to be forgetting my position here, Ms Granger," Snape said maliciously. "I have years of complex study regarding potions as a Master of my area of expertise. The variations of Histrionicus Potions are my own crafting and tested by trained professionals. While you have the propensity to exert your... vast knowledge about certain things but your textbook opinions aren't always welcomed."
But now that he was laying in bed, Draco sat upright beside him, Harry certainly started to mind. He clawed his fingers against his Gryffindor sheets, looking up at Draco’s empty eyes. It was exactly five minutes since the potions wore off, and probably a minute or two since they finished today’s documentation. The Gryffindor dorm around them was dark and silent, and they were shut behind the sealed and charmed bed hangings.
"Mate! You've been re-reading that for what? Two months already!" Ron exclaimed. Hermione tutted at him.
“He hadn’t slept for... months,” Draco said abruptly, finding it hard to put up pretenses at Pansy’s tone.
“I-I’m so s-sorry!” Freya stammers, blushing crimson.
Harry ambles to the store front in an effort to distance himself from his strange mood. The drink has worn off considerably, and he squints at the sign.
James winces visibly and then collapses into himself.
James ran, heedless of people shouting 'hey!" as he pushed them out of the way. The halls became a blur and he skidded around the corner...only to end up almost crashing into Dominique Weasley. James cursed inwardly and tried to circle around her. She was quick though and jerked him back with his collar.
Harry sighed and began the daily, arduous task of dressing himself. It was the most mundane part of his day and half the time, he wondered why he bothered. None of his staffers cared whether his shoes were properly polished or if his robe sleeves looked properly fresh and even if they did, they certainly did not have the backbone to mention it. Like he always said to Draco, there were—
They creeped along the halls, parallel to Draco, and watched as he headed back towards the Main Hall. Students turned to stare as he crossed them, and James couldn't blame them.
Sound filters back in a second later, and Harry stares at the hand holding Malfoy’s thin wrist tight as he ineffectually struggles against him.
? Are you out of your mind—"
James paled and walked faster, the sound of Lucy whining at Dominique("—and you're the only omega I know who won't go, please Mika, Ravenclaw holds mixers so rarely—") fading away as he turned right and resumed running.
He shuffles quickly out of the department that has fallen deathly silent when he’d come out of his office and into the corridor that would take him to Auror HQ. Familiar faces grin and slap his shoulder as he passes, and Harry’s shoulders loosen until he feels calm and jolly.
"Students are not allowed to go to Hogsmeade till third year!"Al cheered in celebration.
When Scorp spotted him, his face lit up. Draco walked down with the twins holding each hand, James next to him and all three tripping over their sentences in their eagerness to tell him about their escapades. He knew he should be stricter, knew that treating them was definitely not the way to go about it but it
They rush into the study, and shoot straight for the wooden cabinet, feet sure in a way that hints at previous planning and reconnaissance. Never let it be said they came unprepared.
Ages, as of now:
The door banged open, making them jump.
"Draco." McGonagall greeted him, a neutral expression on his face, as Draco blinked at her around the door anxiously.
James Potter lolled his head to the other side and grinned lazily at the opposite end of the classroom, "Thought I saw Slytherin losing next week by a hundred points."
"And even if you were, so what? I was called a squib all my childhood. I don't care if you're a squib or that you can't get into Hogwarts, Freya. I would love you anyway, I would love you
"Piano." Freya whispers to herself.
"That's my spot, thief. Move over."

Harry will admit, they manage to extract laughs out of him too but littered in between are threats and insults aimed at unruly employees that slide off them like water. He’s on the verge of becoming quite drunk himself when he turns his head and spots, to his complete horror, Okonedo, and a bunch of his new juniors idling at the entrance, looking on in curiosity.
"Yup. No magical enchantments whatsoever. Mum's worried about Lily getting in and hurting herself. Wrong child to worry about, really."James's grin is absolutely evil. "And Dad and Uncle Ron drink in the afternoon sometimes, so they leave the cabinet unlocked."
James snapped his head back to the front of the classroom, and noticing unwanted attention, quickly arranged himself appropriately, "Yeah, yeah, sorry. Thought I saw something."
This sight of Malfoy, blank, defeated and anxious, is so abnormal to Harry’s reality that he blurts, “What’s wrong with you?”
"This is bad, right?"
"Albus Severus Potter!"
"—and of course, you've got fourteen appointments lined up today, but do you care? No. I suppose I'll just stage a coup then, and take the job for myself, seeing as how I'm the one sitting here next to two Russian wizards who don't speak a shred of English." Came the quiet, angry voice of Diamond Diggle from the fireplace, followed by his face, which was etched into a dark, foreboding expression.
Sometimes, when she feels lonely, she'll try to write her own music. It's not very good and she hides it from her teacher, but it is hers and hers alone, and in her corner of the world, she smiles and feels happy.
Grandma and Draco laugh, but then Draco drops a kiss on his hair, murmurs “You do that love” and everything shines bright like gold, just like the afternoon sunlight.
Diagon Alley is too bright for him, and the lights hit his glasses in an extremely unpleasant way. It becomes a little bit too much for him, so he staggers wherever the dark and quiet lead him.
Draco is laughing at something Grandma has said, head thrown back in his humor. The late afternoon sun spills into the room behind him, lighting the tips of his pale hair on fire. His silhouette glows golden, eyelashes like feather diamonds, and Teddy’s tiny heart trips and falls in love for the first time.
McGonagall's expression lightened, "Why, it was regarding business, seeing as you have chosen to replace your father on the board.."
The life and times of Atticus Scrimgeour part 2.
It's Scorp, a book tucked under his armpit. Freya smiles wider and shuffles her toes so that Scorp can sit on the window seat opposite her, head tucked over her knees.
"Ughh, shut up will you," James growled, trying hard to remember spells that helped eavesdrop long-distance conversations, "He's moving."
"You arse!" Draco hissed at him and Harry grinned. Slowly, as if from a distance, the sound filtered back in.
Lily tilts her head curiously, hands curled around the edges of her frock. She turns to look at Fred, at the bottle, and then back to James again. They're frozen in fear. Fred decides that for all the chubby adorableness of a five year old, her expression is not that different from that of an shrewd, old crone.
“Oh.” Draco replies, hair hiding his expression. Harry sees his hands trembling, and is suddenly horrified at the thought of Malfoy being scared of him. They were rivals, equals. Now their reality has deformed itself into this hellish version where they are nothing but alpha and omega. It makes him sick to his stomach
“She’s here again.”
“I got you this.” Anthony said abruptly, holding out two pieces of toast wrapped in a napkin. He wished that he could fashion sentences more elegantly, but all grammar seemed to desert him when he was around Louis. “I heard you hadn’t had breakfast. So.”
Fred jerks the door open and carefully peruses the shelves farther in, dusty with disuse. Hopefully, they'd find a bottle whose existence Harry would never notice gone.
Freya is tired of the way people look at her. It's somehow always the same—a cursory glance followed by a hard, long look, lips titled up in an awkward mixture of surprise and sadness.
Anthony took a huge breath, and then started trekking towards Louis. Louis peeked at him from under his wool cap, hair and eyelashes blood-red against his porcelain skin and for a moment, Anthony faltered.
“What are you talking about?”
Freya shuffles her feet, blinking her eyes rapidly so her tears won't fall. She apologizes again.
“Merlin!” Al cried in outrage but his complexion did get a few shades paler. “That ridiculous old ghost! Does he delight in torturing first years like this? I think I’m going to look up curses that freeze ghosts into silence forever.”
Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, opened her eyes.
“What is wrong with you, Potter!” Malfoy shrieks as he draws his hand back in shock. His face is aflame, eyes refusing to meet his. “Stop it this instant!”
"Probably escaped off with his Victoire," Ron grumbles and sticks his head into the doorway. His expression falls open in surprise.
“Alright then, I’ll be in the basement all night, knock if you want something. I’ll come check up on you at bedtime so no trouble, okay?” Scorp aims the last part more at his younger, five year old daughter, who smiles in a particularly Slytherin way.
Harry wants to say “Snap out of this!” or “Stop it, I’m going to hex you!” but all that comes out of his mouth is, “You smell really nice.”
On this day, three new participants had appeared-all Weasleys. These particular Weasleys however, were not particularly studious and their presence would have been a mystery if it wasn’t known that they were fifteen, and in OWL year themselves. Lucy Weasley would rather spend her time riddling out when Raghnall Jones, Seeker for Ravenclaw, had his lunch period than spend her afternoon hidden away in a stuffy, little corner with her sisters. But her parents were worried, and sacrifices had to be made. Hoping to have some of Molly’s focus rub off on her, she’d forced her two best friends to accompany her so that she didn’t combust of boredom (It was known to happen in libraries). Negotiating skills and emotional blackmail had been required, but Molly had caved in the end, with only a parting threat to keep her word. It didn’t last, of course.
“you have outdone yourself miss Granger. That was more detailed than my own explanation, so yes that is it exactly. Tomorrow, a list of your groups will go up. They will be cross-house in the interests of unity, and somewhat challenging in the interests of co-operation and teamwork. They will be non-negotiable. Equipment will be provided by the school. You will be doing this the muggle way, as you will be handing in your wands next Friday morning, and you will receive them on your return that Sunday evening. One member of each group will be trusted with a device to call for aid in the occasion of grave injury”
He rolls over and checks his phone. He has a text from Pansy which reads ‘you so totally love him’
“Who’s Molly?” Draco asked as he sat, drawing one of the laminated menus towards him.
“Parkinson, as much as you Slytherins love to think I’m a complete idiot, I do know we don’t have wands. I can do it without one”
“you did nothing wrong, Harry darling. This is about Blaise, not you. Why don’t you take Draco to bed whilst I slowly divest Blaise’s body of its internal organs.” She said in a low voice, giving him a soft smile.
Its times like these that Harry aches for Sirius. Sirius would know what to do, how to help. He would be there for Harry. God, Harry misses him.
It was admittedly naive of him, but he had had  no idea farming would involve this much walking. He had stupidly assumed that the farm would be like Vauxhall city farm that he had visited once with school, with the whole thing being about as big as one field and only two of each type of animal.
“Draco! There's a good lad. Sure, you must be Ginny, it’s the hair you see. And Luna, I met you at the ball. That means you’re Hermione. Every bit as lovely as Ron described” Seamus said, clapping Draco on the back and winking at Hermione.
I couldn’t whisper when you needed it shouted,
“You live by the school, right?” Harry said at the end.
“you really are a decent bloke Blaise” said Harry. “we’re weirdly similar”
“I’m Draco, it’s nice to meet you” Draco replied, deciding to leave unmentioned the earlier slight of their ignoring him.
“How did you get here before I did?” Harry asked.
He could practically hear Pansy hesitating in the darkness.
“Why would he be upset?” asked Harry, his drink-soaked brain unable to keep up with Hermione’s intellect so early in the morning.
He felt Draco nod against his shoulder, and sighed. “I love you Draco. I’m not going anywhere”
I want to break free
Draco awoke the morning of his birthday naturally, which meant that he had been allowed to lie in as a birthday gift, rather than being awoken at an ungodly hour of the morning. He got up, dressed and walked over to the big house for some breakfast. He felt surprisingly happy given it was his first birthday without his mother, and opened the front door with a spring in his step.
The pain in Pansy’s voice made Harry tighten his arms around her. He felt uncomfortable when people expressed such sadness on his behalf. He remembers feeling sick when Hermione had cried in third year when he had explained the full extent of the Dursley’s abuse to her. He never knew how to react. This was worse, because Pansy felt guilty. Guilt was a complicated emotion to grapple with, especially when it was valid, and Pansy was right, they had acted in a downright appalling manner in the younger years at Hogwarts. He stared helplessly at Draco, unsure of how to proceed. Draco approaches wearily and crouches down by Pansy.
Harry scoffed. “I think the fact that I came dangerously close to fucking Luna last night proves I’m not gay. I’m bi. Will that be an issue?” he said, eyes flashing dangerously.
This was all forgotten though, when they began to pull up the driveway to his home. His mother reached out to take his hand, and he realised that hers was shaking.
The list for their group read:
“Why’s he even here, anyway?” Ginny asked, looking put out that Draco was seemingly the one coming between her and Harry, oblivious to the fact he had no romantic interest in her.
“I can practically hear you thinking” came Harry’s deep voice from beside him.
Draco would spend his mornings following Harry, Remus, or one of the Weasley brother’s around the farm, doing his best to help despite his staggering incompetence. They didn't really need his help; Molly’s overabundance of sons meant that there was always manpower available when needed, but Draco was there to earn his keep and so he awoke at five each morning, usually to help with milking the cows, before following his assigned babysitter-most often Harry, who barely acknowledged his presence at all- for the day around the fields for hours until lunch. After lunch, he was usually let off, and this time he spent in the house with Sirius, talking.
“when I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror, Potter, I see a person who used to be bad; a person who is seen by all as bad, and so I do everything in my power to make sure that my actions are good. Our actions make us who we are, Potter. I get up, and I always let Theo use our shower first. I give Pansy my bacon at breakfast. I still do Goyle’s homework for him. In the library, I study with Hermione because Ron hates it so much, and I let her talk as much as she wants. I give Neville plant cuttings from the Manor garden so he can grow them here. I lend him herbology books from my mother’s personal library. I plait Padma’s hair for her because Parvati isn’t here to do it for her. That’s why everyone loves me now, because everything I do, I now do with someone else’s feelings as my priority instead of my own.”
The anger brought on by Cedric’s presence had wiped the presence of the drunken guest in their bathroom from Harry’s mind and he suddenly remembered. Shit. The longer Cedric stayed the higher their chances of being found out.
There are times when I love Harry, and times when I hate him. This is one of the latter. It’s the ministry Beltane Ball and as Head Auror Harry has to be there. And of course, as it has been for the last five years, wherever Harry goes, I go.
Three hours later, he got a call from Draco. He didn’t answer, but instead texted
“Yeah I guessed that” Draco said dryly, feeling like he had the upper hand for the first time in weeks.
“that’s not dinner, Potter” he snorted when he saw that Potter’s arms were full of chocolate frogs and cauldron cakes and muggle biscuits that he had obviously smuggled in. Potter was wearing his big fleece and it smelt like bonfire and Draco just wanted to bury his face in it.
(Thursday 10/09/1998, Harry)
“Oh, Draco, my sweet. I’m so sorry you had to see that” she says, reaching up to smooth his hair down, giving him a watery smile. He can see tears gathering in the corners of her eyes.
“Just you being here helps, Draco. You think Ron talked to me about it today? No. He sat next to me, let me hold his hand and said nothing. The only thing he said during the actual funeral was whether I wanted to go to the pub whilst we waited for the actual burial. Ron doesn’t talk to me often about this stuff, he just lets me sleep in his bed when I need to, like when I was eleven and his bed was the first I had ever slept in.”
It starts off tame. One of these Hufflepuffs hasn’t even kissed anyone. She looked awfully put out when everyone else drank.
“Good birthday so far?” Harry asked, bringing a hand from behind his head to nudge his glasses up his nose.
“I asked you to stay last night? Shit” Draco mumbled into the pillow. “but, yeah. It would be nice.”
They were in Harry’s room- Draco had been too scared to tell his friends the true nature of his relationship with Harry, lest it get back to his father, and so they had to spend most of their time in Harry’s room. Ron often graciously left for the library or common room, but Draco had come to really like Ron. Mainly for how much help, friendship and support he provided Harry, but also for Ron in his own right. He was funny, in more of a ‘laddy’ way than Draco was used to, but funny nonetheless, and he doted on Hermione in much the same way Draco doted on Harry.
“You know what they’re like, Draco. Homophobic, racist idiots who care only about the money in their immediate vicinity” Sirius said sternly, as if admonishing Draco for being on of them, even though he did not include Draco in that sentiment.
Luckily, just as the cold was beginning to get hard to bear, people started getting up and turning in. Hermione and her parents piled into their little mini and drove off into the night, followed by the vast amount of Weasley’s. Draco took the upheaval of guests as cover to make his exit, and he silently made his way back to his little house that was slowly growing on him, despite its small size.
“I saw the Prophet” he says, voice thick with sleep. “remind me to send ‘mione a gift basket, we owe her one”
He stopped writing about the supposed merits of the abandonment of the family unit to watch them cross the large room, Harry shoving Ron onto a sofa and laughing before Ron reached out and pulled him down too, except Ron miscalculated and Harry landed right on top of him. Draco was prepared for the typical display of fragile masculinity- Harry to leap off of Ron’s lap shouting about no homo, but instead Ron gripped his arms around Harry’s middle and jostled him about a bit, before saying
“I’ll be there” he whispered in response, his body going warm all over. He hated how far gone he was for Harry after the events of the half term. He was still worried about leaving his mother behind. he wanted to be there for her, not leave her in a house with a man who was betraying her in the most intimate way possible. Just thinking about it made him feel a bit sick.
He wrote that Sirius was kind and that the farm was nice. He omitted the festivities of the day before, knowing that his mother- and father, who would inevitably also read the postcard- would see such activities beneath them. The only traditions Draco’s parents honoured were traditions borne of wealth and status, such as every Malfoy man attending Cambridge, and wearing Saville Row suits.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That's a very pretty dress lass” he said as Pansy stepped out of the cottage behind Draco and Draco smiled as she blushed. She had always been quite insecure, and sincere compliments still managed to throw her a bit.
“I don’t think I will darling. I’ve never seen you look at someone like that. I must admit though, he is gorgeous. All dark skin and muscle, and that earring”
“who’s that, harry? He’s looking at you like he wants to eat you” Luna said in her soft, lilting voice, pointing at a figure stalking out of the hall.
Before Harry or Ron could open their mouths, Hermione replied with “this is called friendship Malfoy- I forgot you have so few friends you don’t know what it looks like”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I do, have a bit of a secret, I mean. It's not bad or deep or anything, it's just-”
It starts to get exciting when a somewhat tipsy Longbottom looks directly at Thomas and Finnegan and says “never have I ever heard my mates shagging”
“Oh, uh Plato.”
Finally, his brain caught up to reality and he stopped abruptly in the middle of his room, watching as Harry and Ron sat on his desk.
When he woke, the other bed was empty.
“you said I never have to see them again.”
New Year’s Eve finally arrived, and the Gryffindor boys with Draco in tow were sent off with Dudley (much to Ron’s chagrin; the others didn’t know Harry’s history and knew Dudley only as a distant cousin Harry had re-connected with, but Ron felt unable to forgive him) to buy the copious amounts of muggle alcohol needed for such an endeavour. When they returned, the house had been transformed by Harry and the girls; the downstairs was bathed in colourful lights and hidden speakers blared out music that had the floor pulsing with the beat. Harry had dressed up again; golden hair, makeup and a Bowie t-shirt with jeans that were almost so tight as to be indecent. Guests started trickling in,  and soon the ground floor of the most ancient and noble house of black was full of young people drinking and dancing.  Draco was enjoying the party atmosphere, chatting to Seamus before a yell cut through the air. “Bianca!!!!” both Harry and Hermione yelled. The girl at the door was stunning, with rich dark skin and braids down to her waist. She gave Hermione a rib-crushing hug before launching herself at Harry, who swept her off her feet and twirled her round. Draco felt a red-hot stab of jealousy at the sight, which burned brighter as Harry and the girl raced off elsewhere, hand in hand. Suddenly the music changed drastically, to a type of beat and an accent Draco had never heard before.
It started with Hermione crying.
“I can’t help feeling like I’ve fucked it, but it wasn't even my fault. Why can’t the lass just leave me alone?” asked Harry.
“Lead the way” was all Harry said, following Draco up the winding staircase.
It was clear to Harry that the team were friends in their own right, outside of Rugby, and they all did their best to involve Harry and Ron- they explained the stories behind inside jokes, showed photos of past matches, gave advice on the hardest schools to beat.
“I’ve not got time to be waiting around, let’s go” said Harry, but though the words were harsh his voice wasn’t.
“We should go, though. We've a train to catch.”
“Thank you, Sirius.”
“the very fact that you came here with your mother, instead of staying home, shows that you’ve grown, let alone the fact that you’ve apologised. Your actions in the war are forgiven, and understood, so we don’t need to have that conversation. Thank you for apologising, and accepting the mistakes you made.”
“I feel like I never see you anymore, Harry” Ginny said, and Draco detected that tone in her voice that Pansy always adopted whenever she was talking to her new boy interest of the month.
“I’m sorry I had to tell you, mum” he says earnestly, resting his head on her shoulder.
“He knows. He was a student here, too. Not a Rugby boy though, he was much too punk rock for that. He didn’t tell you because he wanted you to come here for yourself, not for anyone else, no matter how important they may be. I thought that now was a good time to tell you, though. He would be so proud of you” she said, her voice wobbling at the end.
It was coming up to the October half term, and Draco was definitely ready to go home. Through some miracle, and possibly the close proximity of their living quarters, but since that fateful Sunday after the first whiskey night, Harry and Ron had blended near-seamlessly with Draco’s group.
Harry sighed. “You really are the best Luna. That’s why you’re my darling” referring to when they were much younger children and had had a pretend wedding, and called each other ‘my darling’ for weeks after, the way they had seen Ron’s parents do.
“It... what?” he says, so inelegantly that Lucius would have hit him had he been here.
(Draco 9:16)
I smirk slightly that Harry has effectively shut down Peterson’s attempt to wrangle alone time with the saviour, but I can tell from the glint in Peterson’s eyes when he sees me that he isn’t giving up yet.
“no, they don’t, but that makes no difference to me”
“I’m not a girl, Potter”
“At least I had a mam to teach me things”, he grinned meanly.
Narcissa looked up at Harry, eyes shining with tears. “thank you for allowing me to meet him Harry. He’s wonderful, perfect even.” A tear slipped down her cheek. “forgive me for saying this lest I bring down the mood, but this tea feels an awful lot like forgiveness, Harry, and I want you to know how much that means to me. I would love to stay in Teddy’s life, if you’ll have me, and Draco too of course.” Harry smiled, happy that this meeting had gone better than ever expected.
“Blaise and I have a proposal for these last two years of boyhood. Wine nights are jolly good, don’t get me wrong, but… I can’t help but view them as rather juvenile. I present to you, Nabini whiskey evenings. Much more age-appropriate, don’t we agree?”
“that’s what I was hoping you would say” Harry laughed.
The idea of watching a film was an exciting one. No work to be done, just sitting passively. It sounded like heaven. Friday morning cinema.
Draco ate silently, the feeling of being an intruder washing over him once again, and he kept his head bent over his food as if to ensure no one noticed he was there. It worked, Remus and Sirius obviously too preoccupied to engage him in conversation, and the minute it was polite to do so, Draco fled
Greg and Vince didn’t have anyone, much the same as the years before, but weren’t into the whole wearing-suits-and-acting-posh-and-dancing-thing, and would probably leave very early.
“it’s not okay, Draco, it’s the opposite of okay, but I’m here, and I love you.”
Of course, I don’t remember it’s my claim until months later. The newest Granger-Parkinson initiative is a party. I fail to be impressed. Pansy does the sales pitch of “no Draco, you don’t understand Draco, it’s a muggle party Draco, with games Draco, really cool games Draco, you’ll love it Draco, you have to come Draco, promise me you’ll come Draco, the games involve snogging Draco, and I know someone you’d like to do that with Draco, oh come on Draco, please come Draco, for me Draco, pretty please Draco.”
“you’re a virgin who can’t drive”
“Yeah.” Harry agreed. “I really fucking miss Hermione though. Especially in history.”
“It gets worse. When we came back for sixth form Ron had this girlfriend, Lavender. And Lavender hated that Ron used to like me, and would use every opportunity to undermine me. Really nasty stuff, you know? She would insult my appearance, my clothes, and my nerdiness, and Harry noticed and tried his best but Ron was blind to it, you know? He was so wrapped up in her. Eventually, she started saying he wasn’t allowed to see me without her present, but she lived in the same village as the school, which meant Harry was once again stuck between us at home, like on the weekends and stuff.
“Sirius cordially invites you t’pre-party drinks at t’farm house. Ron’s here, helping Harry bring the table outside” he said, motioning to the house behind him.
Harry talked alongside the actors for most of the film;
“You haven’t made this summer easy on me” Draco retorted, and Harry’s face tightened as he nodded. “Yea, that’s fair, I s’pose” Harry responded, finally cracking one eye open and looking at Draco. Draco just rolled his eyes and said nothing, waiting for Harry to finally gather up the courage.
He walked into the hall, and called Sirius’ name, and received a reply from an open door near the bottom of the stairs. He walked into the room and found himself in a family living room. Entirely ignoring Sirius’ presence for a second, he let his eyes roam the walls, taking in the soft sofas and armchairs and the pictures adorning the walls. They mostly depicted Harry at different stages of life; a five-year-old Harry perched on Remus’ shoulders, both of them with wide grins on their faces, Remus looking visibly younger, the earring still glinting in his ear. A pre-teen Harry and Sirius standing by a cow; Sirius’ arm around Harry's shoulders and Harry’s arm around the cow’s neck.
“It’s okay. She’s asleep anyway” Draco said, really hoping Harry would stay and let Draco bask in this kind mood a little longer, until it inevitably disappeared, and Harry turned back to being more distant; colder, as he always was.
“I think I'm asexual. Actually, I know I'm asexual” he said, feeling proud of himself. Feeling brave.
“I’ve been busy, Gin. showing Draco around t’farm” Harry replied, and Draco saw him shift further away from her. He bristled a bit at being used as an excuse as Harry hadn’t really done anything of the sort, but he saw it for what it was; Harry had no interest in Ginny. Though it shouldn’t, the fact made Draco feel a vindictive sort of pleasure.
“In you go, it's in the common room, you’ll hear which room” Dean said, nodding at the open door to the building, where Draco could already hear the faint beat of drum’n’bass. That’s another reason he resented the rugby boys. Their music taste was appalling, for lack of a better descriptor. Linking his arm with Hermione, the four of them made their way in and down the hall. The music got louder and louder and by the time they reached the common room, Draco could swear the floor was shaking.
“I’ll make a compromise Harry- if we go to a muggle club, will you come?” reasoned Neville. Harry considered- he could do with a night out in anonymity, and he hadn’t had any action in a long time.
I fold it up and slide it under his door under the pretext of going to the bathroom. Potter is in the kitchen, sorting out our Chinese, and so he won’t see the note until after we’ve eaten and gone to bed, which is good, and I feel myself relax somewhat. We eat in a somewhat comfortable silence, but I don’t put my feet in his lap, and it feels like a loss. Instead of staying until the end of the film as is our norm, I head back to the sanctuary of my room in the hopes that I will then be asleep by the time he’s read the note.
“good afternoon, eighth years. I am here to tell you about an exciting opportunity we are able to provide as part of our post-war muggle integration programme. Before I explain, I must say that I consider it to be a wonderful idea that will strengthen bonds and allow you all to develop new skills. Now, I wonder if any muggle-borns amongst us could tell me what the Duke of Edinburgh Award is?”
“Sirius, I’ve got mam's scones” Ron yelled as he entered the kitchen, Draco close behind him.
There was that mention of the girl again. Draco was burning to ask, but he and Harry were no closer to being friends then they had been on Monday, and he doubted he would be met with a positive reception.
“have hope Ron, he could be stuck with Hufflepuffs” huffed Hermione, struggling against him and his considerable strength. “come on Ron, we can’t change it either way so we might as well get it over with” reasoned Harry, walking towards the board. When he got close enough to see, his stomach dropped.
He stripped Draco into his pants again, before conjuring a bucket and placing it by Draco’s bed. As he made to stand up and go, a pale hand shot out of the duvet and fumbled around, clearly trying to grab Harry’s arm.
Even now, with Granger and Weasley a disgustingly happy couple, the golden trio seemed wholly unaffected by the romance that should have rendered it to pieces, like when Draco had taken Pansy to the Yule Ball and she had been so excited she hadn’t talked to Blaise for the whole preceding week, making Blaise jealous and in turn cut both her and Draco out for days after. Navigating friendships had always been such a minefield for Draco, and he always seemed to say or do the wrong thing as a child, never more clear than during his humiliating encounter with Potter and Weasley on the first ever train to Hogwarts.
