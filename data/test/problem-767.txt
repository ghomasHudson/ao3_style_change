At that moment, as it hit Harry that Draco was gone, he groaned loudly before folding over himself as the tears started to fall down his face. This was all his fault. All of it. His heart ached painfully, and he hugged himself tightly. Draco was gone and it was all his fault. There was nothing he could do to change that.
“Draco, what’s going on?” Harry let out a heavy sigh of frustration, using Draco’s name to get the blondes attention, whose attention flew to his immediately.
“You think you deserve forgiveness? How dare you! You don’t deserve that! I… I can’t give you that! You messed up! I don’t know why I bothered to even meet with you! I stupidly had faith in you, and all you did was stomp all over me, hurt me, humiliate me! And you think you deserve forgiveness. Is that because you are the ‘Boy who lived’? Because everything is just handed to you? Is that it?” Draco screamed at Harry, the anguish written across his features.
“Well? I’m fine so can I get that potion already?” He asked impatiently.
Smirking Harry reached down and grabbed Draco by his golden hair and dragged him over to a large canopy bed that he conjured up. Then grabbing the blonde by his bicep, he threw him onto the bed conjuring shackles on all four posts which bound themselves to his wrists and ankles.
"Then don't you think you should be telling me what it is then?"
Draco’s thoughts raced as his body began to resonate and squirm beneath Harry's slow and calculated movements.
Draco, now fully realizing the situation he was in, looked up with terror in his eyes. He grabbed Draco's wrists and pinned them on either side of his head as he crushed their lips together, only pulling apart when he didn't get a response from the blonde. Licking his lips, he lowered his lips to Draco's again, forcing his tongue into the others mouth.
“Harry, I have a confession to make, and please before you make any comments, please just hear me out.” He stared at Harry’s profile, watching at the other boy turned to face him, indicating he was listening. “I am being fully candid and honest with you, but if you don’t believe me, you can just ignore and forget everything and just walk out of here unhindered okay?” Harry nodded in agreeance to the blonde’s words, listening carefully and respectfully to him.
Exhausted, he pulled himself out of his bed with a splitting headache. I need to see Madame Pomfrey for something to kill this headache off. Grumbling, he straightened his clothing and left the dormitory for the hospital wing to see about getting a pain reducing potion.
It seemed like no time when Draco found himself sitting with the other Slytherins at supper, with a large portion of kidney pie sitting in front of him. He poked it with his fork, before spearing a small piece of it with his fork and putting it into his mouth, forcing himself to chew and swallow it. He glowered at Blaise who sat beside him as he laughed at some joke that Vincent was telling. He was the one who found Draco just as he was getting back to the common room after running into Harry that afternoon and decided that he needed to supervise and drag him to the meal. He frowned down at the plate, as if the pie had done something to him personally.
''What the bloody hell? Where did she get that idea from?'' He rubbed his face before standing up to grab clean clothes before crawling back onto his bed, closing the curtains to dress. Sitting on the bed, he unbuttoned and pulled his shirt off, gently touching the bruises on his arms from his encounter with Potter. He could feel tears building up, but he blinked them away, not allowing them to appear as he refused to appear weak. He quickly peeled off the rest of his clothes, pulling the clean ones on before opening the curtains and stepping out into the room where Blaise stood waiting for him.
''What’s wrong? Tell me Draco!'' He tightened his hold on the panicking blonde as he noticed tears building up in his eyes. Blaise relaxed his hold on him, pulling the smaller boy up into his lap holding him tightly as Draco’s control over himself released into trembling, heart breaking sobs.
When he woke again, he blinked in the sudden brightness that surrounded him. After a few minutes, he slowly opened his eyes again, this time he was able to keep them open. That’s when he began to take notice of his rather surreal surroundings.
Draco reaches the breaking point and can't deal with it anymore.

“No luv, that wasn’t me. I didn’t say anything.”
Draco felt the nervous fluttering around the pit of his stomach as he paced nervously around the Room of Requirement. The room was outfitted with a plush carpet, a few plush easy chairs and a couch all arranged in a semi-circle in front of a warm, inviting fireplace. Wringing his hands, the Prince of Slytherin wasn't even sure if the Gryffindor Raven would even bother showing up tonight, but he decided to take the chance anyways and confess to him via owl post delivered by one of the school’s owls so as it could be anonymous. He kept the letter short and sweet, and to the point, being too nervous to elaborate too much or to be poetic in it. He had asked in the letter, to meet him in this place at 8 pm tonight, which was why he was there.
Sneering, he rubbed his face with one of his hands as he stood, turning his back on Dumbledore and head down to the dungeons to his common room. He poked his head through the entrance and seen to his relief, that there was no one there yet as it was still early. He slipped through the room silently and made his way to his dorm room where he promptly flopped onto his bed, drawing the curtains closed around it. Laying back, he closed his eyes as flashes of what happened to him flashed through his mind. I knew that he wouldn't believe me...but how could he do that to me! I can't even stand the thought of facing him in class now! How can I? I hate him so much! He rolled onto his side with a groan of pain before curling into himself.
Meanwhile the professors and Madam Pomfrey had been rushing around the bed, waving wands, and mumbling under their breaths. Madam Pomfrey slipped Draco a few vials of potions before stepping back and wiping her forehead with the back of her hand just as Professors Dumbledore and Snape also stepped back from the bed. An overwhelming sense of grief filled the room as the atmosphere was weighted down by the somber presence of death.

“I only reacted to you like that because you treated me even worse than ever! I assumed we fought, and I said or did something that pissed you off. I don’t really have any memories of that night, I was drinking prior to going to see you, and maybe I drank too much and hurt you, but I’d never do something like that. Not to you, not to anyone. You’ve got to believe me!” He plead inching closer to Draco, his hands raised palms up in submission.
Still not looking in Harry's direction, Draco mumbled, "I love you."
''You need to loosen up. I can't move.'' Harry spoke as he slapped Draco’s ass hard. ''And you can stop with that pathetic whining. You're giving me a headache.'' Draco’s cries did not lessen, causing Harry to laugh loudly at him as he started to pound into him, moaning his pleasure.
''Ooh I should have joined you, I so needed to study for today’s class.'' She reached down, grabbing his hand, ignoring the cold look she was given as she smiled up at him warmly. ''Let’s go grab some breakfast before those knuckleheads eat everything.'' Her laugh rang like bells as she pulled him into the dining hall towards the other Slytherin students, where she found two seats beside Vincent at the table.
"What?"
“What?! I’d never do that! Never! How could you even joke about that? Rapes not funny!”
“Wha… What do you mean?” He stammered out as he dropped his gaze to his hands in his lap, which were rubbing unconsciously against the wound in his arm. Man up! Do not make him turn you into a whiny mudblood! You’re a Malfoy so act like one!
"You. Have. To. Keep. Still. Draco." Harry growled out in a gruff, deep voice as he bit down on his collarbone causing a sharp, almost sensual pain, causing him to blush uncontrollably. Harry noticing this, grinning down at his reddening face and started to play with the nipples with his long fingers causing him to groan as the sensation was being to register sharp and clear in his groin region.

He was now a nervous wreck, continuously running his fingers through his golden hair with his face growing paler and paler as the time passed 8 pm and moved closer to 8:15 pm as Draco checked his watch for the hundredth time that evening. Groaning as his heart fell into the pit of his stomach and felt like it was breaking, and he was debating on leaving to go back to his common room as he heard the door creak open and footsteps enter the room. Draco looked curiously in the direction of the sound but couldn't see anyone. As he watched, Harry Potter appeared out of nowhere with his wand out and pointed in his direction looking angry.
“Joking? I’m not fucking joking! I’m fucking pregnant because of you! You ruined me!” Draco screamed as he backed into the railing, coming to a stop, tears falling down his cheeks.
“How can I trust you to not hurt me again? How can you ever make up for that? Why should I trust you?” Scoffing, he turned his back to Harry, arms crossed as he stared into the fire.
''No...no you don't have to do this! I will never say anything about it! Please let me go!'' Draco sobbed out as he felt Harry's hardness against his backside. Harry only paused long enough to laugh as Draco felt his fingers probing him, entering him roughly. He cried out from the pain as Harry rammed two more fingers in him before wiggling them around.
"And who do you think would care what happens to a slimy snake like you?" Harry tilted his head as he contemplated what to do next, before coming over to the bed and leaning over him. "You know; I believe that you had something to tell me. The reason why you called me here in the first place didn't you?" Draco flushed, embarrassed and terrified in his stated of undress looked away from Harry. Harry, ignoring the silent tears flowing down the blonde’s face, roughly grabbed his chin, forcing him to look up as his grin grew bigger.
Her last sentence caught me off guard. Now it was my time for being stunned. It felt like I couldn’t breath for a moment. Like someone discovered my deepest darkest secret!

"Bombarda"
________________________________
Draco’s POV:
"You are just like Hermione! Wait no, you are worse then Hermione! I don't think she'd ever call potion interesting! It's utterly bad & dry & boring!!" She said.
Ginny was completely horrified. She had no clue. "Ohh Merlin!! I didn't know about any of that! Please Believe me Draco!"
Hermione kept quiet.
"Hey, if it's bothering you so much dear, then talk to Ginny about it, okay? She'll clear your doubts." Said Ron with reassuring smile.
"Yeah well what a hard work, STEALING!” I said sarcastically. “And this is shite btw!"
" let's gossip!!" She said excitedly.
Ron didn't say anything. He was in a dilemma. He really wanted to believe in Hermione's gut feelings, but he wasn't ready to accept that his sister might have done something wrong. He couldn't make a choice.
"Hermione, Ginny, we have to do something. If we'll keep on running like this, he'll catch us in no time!" Said Draco Anxiously.
All students were gathered around in a great hall for dinner. Ron and Hermione were sitting together. They've given Harry & Ginny some space, so the couple were sitting little far away from them. Dinner was almost about to end.
"Ginny!" Said both Hermione and Draco, they rushed towards her.
So I really really wanna continue this.
Is everyone so important to him except his own girlfriend?
"Potter!?" I asked with surprise.
Draco was about to reach the door but suddenly Harry's hand grabbed him from behind with immense force.
————————————————————————
“It isn’t Draco! But I’ll find a way to deal with this.”
She went to the kitchen to get some food. She felt fresh after eating.
"Yeah but I told her that it's not true. He's probably just stressed or something. So I told her to distract her mind so she borrowed that book from me.”
Draco & Hermione were pretty stunned after hearing her confession. But she didn't tell everything. Still the most important detail was missing.
Hey my dear Drarry shippers, please read all the tags carefully! It’s not a vanilla story! It’s dark fiction. Don’t read if not comfortable! I don’t want to traumatise anyone accidentally!
Hermione looked her in the eyes and said, "We need to get to the professor Snape urgently. Now he's our only hope!"
When you feed someone 1 spoon, that person becomes aroused but still remains in full control of his actions throughout the ritual. It's the ideal way to use this potion."
H-He loves Ginny, not me. It's the defective potion talking, right? Or he's really in love with me?' Draco was so stunned. He never thought of this possibility before. His brain stopped working.
Cause my eyes always look for a certain platinum blonde bloke! I find my solace in his company. His words are like salves for my wounded soul. How did he become so important to me!? I can't even pinpoint the moment I started to loose myself in him.
In the end it turned out to be a very good idea. Cause when he confronted him, after a little wand fight & resistance Draco broke down in tears. It was shocking for Harry to witness him crying, something did hurt in his chest, he didn't know why tho! Draco told him everything.. how his life is in danger & what dark lord is intended to do with him! Harry took him to the professor Dumbledore. Professor Dumbledore summoned professor Snape & they talked with Draco. After a discussion they provided Draco a shelter. They moved Draco from Slytherin’s quarters & gave him personal room near the library. & Dumbledore told Harry that now Draco is his & his friends's responsibility. His friends were not happy in the beginning. Hell even he was not happy either. But after a while Hermione & Ginny came around. Under the layer of arrogance there was a witty, funny, smart & charming boy! They immediately liked this new Draco & became close friends with him. Tho Ron never really accepted him as a friend. Harry was nearly inseparable from him ever since he became friends with Draco! They were now really close friends! But unfortunately for Harry, He fell in love with Draco! even before he can stop himself!
"Dracooooo, I HATE YOU !! Okay fine! that's true... arghh I hate them so much!” She said dramatically, “So now I decided that you're my best friend & they're not! In fact you’re my only friend!”
“Read this potion book.”
Hermione's expressions changed, as if she realised some crucial detail.
"Draco, I think you should- I mean we should leave this place right now!" Said Hermione with urgency.
"Great do you have anything better to do!" I said with mock annoyance.
"But this could be a trap!!" cried Ron "Harry what if it's a trap!?"
Hey guys... I wanna tell you something very important.
She gave me the look of fake shock. “What do you mean? I'm telling you the truth!"
She couldn't hold her tears anymore. She laid there crying for a while & then eventually fell asleep.
The Hogwarts's library is very vast and full of splendour. They began to walk towards the more intimate part of the library.
He was freely sobbing now. Potter was kneeling over him, legs either side of Draco. Draco was shivering. He was desperate to get out of that situation. So he mustered all his strength and brought his knee up hard into Harry's groin. Harry was not expecting that. He fell off of draco. He clutched his crotch and cried out in pain.
"STUPEFY" casted Ginny, but it didn't stop Potter. They were truly terrified now. No magic was working on Harry. Draco & Ginny had no idea about this effect of the potion.
"And well if you feed someone 3 spoonfuls, that person becomes mad with lust and completely looses the control over himself. No matter what happens he won't be able to stop himself until the deed is done. There's no going back!
"I believe it's so beautiful out there, sunny weather." I said.
"That was so lame Ginevra! You can do better!!" I rolled my eyes at her.
Draco started crying. He was really really scared. He knew that potter can seriously hurt him, cause he lost all the control. It was potion's doing. Draco closed his eyes, like not seeing him will make this all go away.
See you soon in next chapter! (I’ll update Once or twice in a week most probably)
"That's absolute nonsense Ginny!! even the blind man can see how much he loves you!" How could she even think that way. It’s like saying McGonagall developed feelings for Voldemort, Which is IMPOSSIBLE!
"And where is Potter ?" Asked Draco.
Draco was really confused by this all, but he didn't say anything cause it was not an appropriate time for this conversation.
"Hmmm " she was still playing dumb.
Draco was looking at her with sadness. He knew very well how difficult that relationship was for her.
"Many things!!"
I clearly remember that!
So why to ruin something that I already have, for something that'll never be mine! Yes it hurts! It freaking hurts so much!!
Harry was not listening at all, or rather he wasn't able to! He continued to kiss Draco's face. "Ohh Merlin I love you" kiss "I love you so much" kiss "I love you" kiss. Draco was still struggling to get out of Harry's grip. He was trying to push him away, punching him on his torso, but Harry was completely unaffected by it. He was keep chanting, "I love you so much Draco! My heart hurts. I love you so freaking much!"
———————————————————————
"So Why isn't he here with you then?" Asked Hermione. She too was very angry at Ginny. She really wanted to know about Harry's condition.
Hermione and Draco were now sure that there was something wrong. No matter how clever Ginny was, lying was definitely not her cup of tea. The whole stuttering thing & nervous demeanour confirmed their suspicions. Now they had to know what is she hiding..
"Well I'm not the one who's being blind here! He skipped the Quidditch Hermione!! QUIDDITCH! That git would never do that unless it's something very important & he was in a rush to go somewhere. I saw him going towards the girl's bathroom on the first floor. What else it could be!?" I tried to reason with them.
“Ohh Salazar please don’t tell me you sneaked gramophone thingy  in your purse too!” Hell no!
I sighed & close my book. There’s no chance of winning against the drama Queen. So I dropped it. Let’s get it over with!
But Hermione was confused. If 3 spoonfuls were supposed to be this intense, then why Harry was immune to their powers.
"Yeah Ron. I will." Said Hermione with a small smile & looked at Ginny's table. But her smile immediately disappeared.
"Duhhh, If you'll kick me out, then who'll bring you this amazing tea!"
Hermione & Ginny were absolutely heartbroken. They couldn't understand what just happened!
This information was very strange for Draco. He was curious to know more, so he decided to ask for details when this will be over. They both started looking for Harry's & Ginny's names on the map and in few minutes they finally found them.
"well I did, cause it is!" I rolled my eyes.
"Granger I'll come with you."  Said Draco firmly.
"IMPEDIMENTA" cried Hermione.
Ginny gulped, It was clearly hard for her to speak. She didn't know how her friends would react after knowing her truth. She felt herself at loss of words.
"Amazing! Madness runs in the family!"
He wanted to just part his legs, & shove his hard cock inside his lover's hole & fuck him whole night, like there's no tomorrow. Fuck him till his lover scream his name in ecstasy! Fuck him very hard so he can't walk straight for weeks. Fuck him till he can't sit properly without feeling that beautiful pain between his legs, to remind him constantly who did that to him. So he never forgets to whom he truly belongs.
"W-What ! I-I didn't put anything! I- "
"Well Hermione, she umm- well she was upset. She told me that Potter doesn't love her anymore." Draco said with guilt.
"What book?" Asked Draco.
We talked about random stuff for like hours, or at least it felt that way. I sensed that something was wrong with her, it felt like she was hiding something, a hurt. She was smiling but it didn’t reach to her eyes, I can see the sadness in them. So I finally asked her,
"Ginny we need to break this door!" Said Hermione with Panic. "We have to get him out!" She was really scared for Draco.
"3 spoons." She said meekly.
"Hermione what's the matter?" Asked Ron.
"Well Ginny your expression clearly suggests that you know why we are here. So let's not waste time by playing dumb."  Said Draco With straight forward tone.
Maybe I should change the username or story name or something! He already has an account here, so making it private is no use! ( & I don’t even know his account name 😔)
It's weird. I tried to ignore that look. What does that even mean!
"Yeah!! It feels like He doesn't love me anymore, hell sometimes it feels like he never did!” She said with sadness.
"Yeah ferret, I mean Malfoy.. we're perfectly fine!" Said Ron.
"Well, it's- It's just Ginny borrowed a potion book from me to distract her mind. So when I heard potion I was little shock. But that book is just juicy old tales of potion world. So just a coincidence maybe." Said Draco.
Three friends were sitting around the fire place in the Gryffindor common room. They were deeply engaged in some conversation. Talking in muffled voices so no one could hear them!
"And it qualifies him to be a death eater!?" She Interrupted me. "Seriously Harry you're being blind in the hatred!"
"DRACO!! NOOOO.." cried Hermione.
Harry took advantage of Draco's momentary shock. He bound Draco's hands with wandless spell. Draco suddenly came out of shock, he realised what's happening. He started to panic.
"LUST POTION Ginny!!!! & that too WITHOUT HIS CONSENT!! Do you realised it's called RAPE!?!" Draco was nearly screaming. He couldn't contain his anger anymore. He couldn't believe that Ginny was capable of doing something like that!
"Nothing is wrong with her Draco, calm down. It's just something strange happened. I saw her putting something in Harry's drink twice. Everything about it seemed weird & now they both are gone. So I'm slightly worried."  Said Hermione.
She knows that he's going through rough times, she just wanna be part of it, she wanna get more involved with him like Ron & Hermione. Why can't he share his burden with her, why can't he talk. It doesn't have to be romantic. She just wants to be there with him. She wants to be the person who comforts him. She loves him so much that's why she craves any contact with him.. but he's always with Ron, Hermione & now Even with Draco. & this thought made her cry again!
So what do you think of this chapter? Let me know in the comments.
Maybe she's just being paranoid, she tried to reason with herself. Obviously Harry still loves her, isn't he! He's just stressed that's all, She thought.
“Ohh Ginny!” I was surprised to see her.
"Let it go Harry! Please for merlin’s shake , talk about something else, cause we're talking about him for hours now! How many more time do we have to go through this. Yes he's acting different. He's maybe working for dark lord but he can't be a death eater!!." She interrupted me again.
"Draco is right. I should get out of my head & distract my mind. Maybe I should read this potion book, it did sound interesting. Maybe this will help."
(See the end of the chapter for
wow this is just weird! Why he's always on my mind!? Why There's this weird need in me to constantly know what he's upto!
Tho deep down I feel like maybe I shouldn’t! 🙈
"So why is he so distant lately?!! Draco we don't even talk anymore like we used to!" She argued.
Well obviously because I'm concerned with everyone's safety! Yeah that must be it! Gosh I really need to find a proof against Malfoy so I can show that to Ron & Hermione & be done with him! I need a plan.
Hey guys what do you think of this chapter? Do you like it? Do you hate it? Please let me know.
Draco clenched his eyes shut in fear. He was shivering, Tears were freely running down his cheeks. Sobs after sobs tore from his throat. He was keep on chanting "no no no no no no..." but it didn't help. His pleadings got dissolved in to haze of lust & never reached to Harry's ears.
'Where are you Potter! Please be fine, please be fine, ohh Salazar please protect him... please' he was chanting that in his head.
"Of course silly!!”
Harry was chasing them. He was very determined to get his hands on Draco. No on HIS Draco!!
Hey guys are you excited for more?? Please please please let me know! I'm dying to know your thoughts! Love you guys! ~ zee
“Draco we don’t have time for this.. I- I think we should run! NOW” - said Hermione with panic
Draco looked at them. They both were looking tensed.
"I don't understand. Can you please explain everything since beginning?" Asked Hermione. She was desperate to know the truth.
She looked at Ginny expectantly, so Ginny started to explain.
They all became startled due to Harry's sudden presence. Draco was really confused by Harry's behaviour.
"HELP!" Draco screamed, he stretched his hand forward towards the girls, but before they could grab it & drag him out, door shut right on their faces. It was a powerful dark magic.
Hermione was truly horrified! She couldn't believe what she was hearing! She felt weak in her knees!
Ginny what did you put in Harry’s drink?” - Hermione
“Ginevra you fool, it gets activated when person you love is near you. He loves you obviously, so it means you must’ve messed this up while making this, that’s why it’s not working on him & 3 spoons is dangerous amount, he’ll completely loose control & harm someone when it’ll kick in ”-Draco.
Hermione was trying so hard not to think what's happening behind the locked door. She needed to get help as soon as possible.
"Ohh Salazar, I should kick you out of my room  right now for calling potions boring!! I'm offended!!" I said with a huff. (Yeah I forgot to mention, I’m childish too!)
"So why it is not working on him?"
But Something strange happened. That spell hit the Harry but it didn't work at all.
"Well It's a long story Hermione.. I-I don't know from where to start." Said Ginny in defeated voice.
Hey guys! Here’s the new chapter for youuuu! It’s the longest chapter I’ve written in this series so far! 😄 I’m Very excited for you to read this! Please share your reviews!
Hey guys I’m back with a new chapter. Finally it’s happening......
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, is anything wrong?" Asked Hermione.
"Ohh that would have been funny.. but sadly Hermione caught me last minute... she has sharp eyes Draco , she sees everything!! How does she see-"
"D-D-Draco?? H-Hermione?? What are you guys doing here?" Asked Ginny timidly.
His dick was achingly hard and throbbing in his trousers. In that moment he wanted to just rip Draco's clothes off. His body was so hungry for the other man. All the rational thoughts left his brain. All he could think in that moment was how much he wanted to fuck him.
Yes we've had this conversation merlin knows how many times, & Ron is still not convinced. He's still looking at Draco with suspicion in his eyes, & honestly I don't blame him cause I know that we've had bad history with Draco for all these years (who knows better then me!!) but he's changed now! He isn't the same bloke who he used to be! He's not the same arrogant prick who used to run around in the hallways like he owns the place! No! Now He's a very different person. Very vulnerable & soft human who's very very scared of everything! I don't know why it hurts me to see him this way.. like he's afraid of his own shadow. It makes me want to protect him from all the bad things in the world! It makes me—-
"Yes it is. I think we should go and find out." Said Hermione.
"Hey Granger, hey Weasley.. have you guys seen Potter?"  Interrupted Draco.
Sorry if there’s any grammatical mistakes.
It was the most bizarre moment for Draco. He never saw Harry so in love, so vulnerable before. How much his heart craved for hearing this! But then realisation struck down on him. 'He's saying this for Ginny, he's under the effects of the defective potion. He's thinking that I'm Ginny.' Draco felt his heart breaking into million pieces.
They begin to run frenetically. They were getting chased by Potter! Who was looking like maniac & who was very determined to chase Draco! No HIS DRACO!
No, they're shiny grey eyes, sooooo deep & intense!! Always look at me as if they're asking some unspoken question! The questions that I could never answer! They're just beautiful & full of warmth.. as if they're made just to hypnotise me & to drown me in their depth.
Her facial expressions proved that there was something VERY wrong! She looked like a dear caught in headlights.
"What do you mean Ron?" Said Hermione.
"It's a long story Draco, I'll explain it later. Now let's go."
It feels like she doesn't know him anymore. She didn't fall in love with this Harry. He was a different human.
" I solemnly swear that I'm upto no good." Hermione said the incantation, pointing her wand towards the Marauder's map.
“But with all seriousness I do need something to divert my mind!” She said quietly.
(See the end of the chapter for
They started to hit the library door with different spells.
"It's totally fine, go take some rest!!" Said Hermione with concern.
I think i should stop with stalking. I should just confront him! I know how to deal with him!
_______________________________
Ginny was completely speechless, she couldn't utter a word.
"Yeah.” she said with mischief in her eyes. She was glowing as usual, Pretty girl.
"It-It's a combination of  a lust potion & pregnancy potion of ancient time. It arouses the man who consume it, to the extent that it creates the strong feelings of euphoria within him. All the love he bears in his heart surfaces & creates great ecstasy. It's far more intense than simple lust, cause this ecstasy arises from PURE LOVE & not from any physical attraction. It leads to love making which results in guaranteed  pregnancy, it creates a 'love child'. A child born out of pure love. & once it is conceived no power in the universe can stop the birth of that child, Not even the gods above!"
"Ohh yes, keep rolling your eyes, you may find your brain back there!!" She said with a grin.
"DRACO! we don't have time for this.. I- I think we should run! NOW" Screamed Hermione with panic.
Hey guys so I’m back! I decided to continue this story!! Here’s the new chapter.
"Gin, are you okay? What is hurting you love?!"
Hermione was the first one to cast a spell in Harry's direction.
How can I even say that I love her! Love doesn't have the same meaning for me anymore. Now loving her feels like a distant memory of mine! Maybe I never truly loved her, maybe I just liked the idea of loving her!
Finally they saw one figure sitting alone on one of the tables. It was Ginny. Harry was nowhere in sight.
⚠️ CAUTION: READ TAGS CAREFULLY. This chapter contains non con stuff. So if it’s triggering for you in any way, please don’t read it.
Harry's body was burning from within, it was screaming at him to claim his gorgeous lover, his Dray. His lover's beautiful porcelain white skin was glowing in the moonlight. His luscious silky platinum locks were wet with sweat. His feature were so so delicate. His cheeks turned into beautiful shade of red. Harry looked into those mesmerising grey eyes, which often tormented his dreams. Those rosey pink lips, he wanted to taste so bad. It was almost unbelievable that His lover was a human, how could any human being look so ethereal! He stared at him in awe. his beauty simply added fuel to his fire.
“And I am serious! Give me a chance to explain.. this is not an ordinary potion’s  book Ginny. It is ancient, it is full of dark secrets & blunders of old time. More like juicy tales! There were many potions which are banned now because of their dangerous nature. You won’t believe what they could do!! wonders Gin!! unimaginable things!”
Draco's movements stopped abruptly. His eyes became so wide.
"Well m-me and Harry are having some troubles in our relationship, it is falling apart." She paused.
|| LOVE , WHAT A WICKED THING..||
"Yeah Ron but it doesn't seem like it. I-I don't know how to explain this. It's just her body language was strange. & her face was little- Tense ?! It didn't look like prank. There's definitely something fishy about this!" She said worryingly.
When she woke up, she felt much better. Her head was clear now. As if that cloud of negativity has passed. She blamed those earlier thoughts on her insecurities & bad habit of overthinking.
"yes mate, I hate to agree but she's right! He's too young to be a death eater. he's just a rotten git. Let's drop this conversation, it's fruitless" said Ron.
"Something very wrong Granger!
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DANGEROUS IS THAT!" Said Draco with great horror.
~ love you lots, Zee ❤️
I know I went little far, but what's wrong in that. I had to know what he's upto!
“Ohhh I didn’t think of it Dra-“ - Ginny
"Yes Ronald he's not so bad when you get to know him! He's very friendly! In fact Me, Ginny and Harry are quite close to him now" she said the last line looking directly at me with a small smile & with a knowing look in her eyes!
After hours of reading, One potion among these caught her interest. It was named as "certus graviditatum". This was mentioned as one of the most powerful, dark & fatal potion. After reading the details of it, she got intrigued by it. An idea popped up in her head. Her lips curved into a smile. This will definitely fix things between them, she thought.
Draco took the opportunity. He quickly rolled over and tried to crawl away from potter. But unfortunately with bound wrists, he couldn't move as quick as he hoped for. His vision was blurry with tears And his blow to Potter's dick was not so powerful either.
"Hermione.. it's Ginny we're talking about!! What's wrong possibly she could be doing? Relax love. It's probably nothing. Don't worry your pretty lil head over this." Said Ron smiling.
"I don't know mione. They were here just now!" Said Ron. Now he looked puzzled too.
Just one moment ago Draco was running with them & in the Next moment he was trapped in that library. It happened so fast.
"That's really good Ronald! I'm happy that you're finally moving on!" Said Hermione cheerfully! "You can be very stubborn sometimes!”
Now it’s just very awkward for me. Cause due to nature of this story I wanted to stay anonymous. But he didn’t give a fuck about whatever I said, & he did this anyway!
"D-Draco I know I was supposed to use only 1 spoonful but it didn't seem to work on him, so I got frustrated, I thought maybe he needed more, so I gave him 2 more times. But results were the same." Said Ginny.
"Potter what the fuck!! Release my wrists right now! Ahhhhh Potter this hurts!" Draco was truly scared of Harry in that moment.
"WHAT!?" They both said.
"Potter! Let me go. I'm not Ginny! This is a huge misunderstanding. Please just get off me!" He was pleading again.
I'm lucky to have friends like them! With them I'll even survive this heart ache!
"So I desperately wanted to fix it."
"But I want to know why!? Why are you reading potion’s book of all books, Draconis?” She said with mischief. Did I mention how childish she is!!
Girlfriend! Yes how can I forget! Yes we're still together, & in a relationship! & happy (!!!??!!!) Then I don't know why I feel so cold & distant lately. Why isn't she the one my eyes look for.. why she's not the one who's occupying my mind all day. Why my heart doesn't beat for her anymore. That smile ... I can literally do anything to see that smile, but it doesn't belong to her lips! Why it's not her eyes that I end up dreaming so often... !!
I sighed in relief.
Ginny was feeling really guilty.
"well Hermione, Ron-"
"Where is Harry and Ginny?" Their sits were empty. She looked at Ron.
"Hermione maybe you're right. But do you think we- "
I glared at her.
“DRACO! I was talking about seriousness!”
This made me laugh.
"yeah but this place is huge! we don't even know where they are! How are we gonna find them?" Said Draco.
“Maybe...”  she said with mischief.
"No I wanna stay" I said firmly with tight smile. I don't wanna be alone, not now! I need a comfort crowd!
“Malfoy!?” Harry appeared out of no where behind them, he was looking at Draco with great lust in his eyes.
____ ________________________________
“Btw draco you just spoiled my plans you know... I really thought about having that pity party dance while moping about Harry!”
"Ohh it just slipped. I can't tell you that Hermione, it's not my place to tell. It's her personal stuff." Said Draco with hesitation.
————————————————————————
Just like today, they were sitting around the fire place in the common room & they were talking about Draco.
Turned out, Draco and Ginny didn’t know everything about that potion! 🤦🏻♀️ Maybe Prof Snape Will throw some light on this subject in next chapter!😬
"Of course it is a hard work! Sneaking off the tea & trying not to get caught while keeping it warm!! You don’t know!!”
I’m sorry for any grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language, & I don’t have beta.
"Why did she borrow that? You said to distract her mind? What happened?" Asked Hermione.
Luckily they were getting closer to Library's door. Just few more steps & they'll be out in the open. They looked hopeful. But potter was much closer now!
"Draco, This is the map of Hogwarts. I won't go in details right now, but let me tell you that It shows location of everyone within the walls of this castle. There are moving dots of everyone's name. Let's look for Harry & Ginny in this." Said Hermione.
"Ginny that's not the point ..please tell me what’s wrong!”
All the colours left Ginny's face.
"Wait what happened to Ginny!!???" Said Draco with panic. He cared about her so much. & the thought of something bad happening to her, scared him.
"Ohh so You really made this!?" I asked her with surprise.
"You are no FUN!! Not at all!! Fine go back to your books, read & read.. while ohhh I, your best friend die!! DIE WITH BOREDOM!!" She said dramatically.
Ginny was not expecting that. She was taken aback by their sudden presence.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny was the first one to cross the door, & then Hermione.
"Duh! Didn't ask for your permission.. who needs that!  I was gonna stay anyway" she said.
'Did-did he say Draco? No it can't be true!
"Wait mione what did I do!!?" I asked her with a fake annoyance.
"Locomotor Mortis" Draco was the second one to cast a spell at Harry, but just like the last time it didn't work.
“Yeah got it, I’ll be careful! Now can I have it please?”
"No, it doesn't look like nothing Malfoy. You genuinely looked shocked when she mentioned it. What are you not telling !? Said Ron with suspicion.
They realised that potion finally kicked in Harry! He looked like a maniac,completely out of control!!
"But Hermione - "
"You gotta be kidding me Ginny! HOW COULD YOU!!!??!!" He gasped, he was shell shocked.
"listen Draco, I appreciate your sentiments but this is not the time for that. One or two things can be coincidence but all these??!! I don't think so. I think there's something wrong & you should tell us. It's for everyone's good." Said Hermione.
"Harry I can't believe you really skipped the game you're mad about, just to stalk Malfoy! It's unbelievable" Hermione was genuinely shocked too.
"Blimey mate! you did WHAT!?!now I'm really concerned for you. you're becoming obsessed with that Git!" Said Ron. He was looking at me as if I developed another head on me!
“3 spoons. I know I supposed to use only 1 spoonful but it didn’t seem to work so I gave him 3 times, strangely it’s still not working.”
I worked so freaking hard for this story. I’ve rewritten last chapter 3 times cause I didn’t like the outcome. So I’m doing everything to make this as good as possible! & I saw that at least few of you are interested in this!
So she asked Draco,
"Potion!!?" He asked with a shock.
"Well I skipped the Quidditch too & I followed him.." I told them sheepishly.
We both look at each other for a second. She gave me an unimpressed look, it confirmed my suspicion. I burst out laughing!
"Well there is something! I have this doubt- "
"Okay then let's go Draco, we have to hurry!" Said Hermione.
"No I really want to, Granger. Ever since you mentioned about that potion, I feel anxious. I understand that You're worried for Potter & well I'm worried for Ginny. I wanna talk to her, Please let me accompany you."  Said Draco with earnestness.
"Care to share!?”
"Yeah let's go." Said Ron
“Sure, here you go.”
"What do you mean?" Asked Ron. He was puzzled.
"I saw Ginny putting something in Harry's drink. & at first I didn't mind it so much. But then she did it again. It looks like Harry is unaware about it." She said suspiciously.
If Draco only knew what was about to come, he would've stopped right there!! Poor unfortunate soul was completely oblivious to his impending doom. He ran towards his downfall!
"Ron you don't need to explain yourself . I can totally understand. All I'm saying is give him a chance. I know it's hard but we all did it too." I said quietly.
Draco looked Horrified after hearing that.
"Harry do you really think we should trust him mate? He still could be a spy or something!" Ron asked me, He was looking frustrated.
"Harry are you okay??!! I think you should go & lie down! You got lost again. Take some rest mate" Ron said with worry.
"Well do you not remember that how determined you were about proving Draco death eater in the beginning!? God how much me & Ronald tried to make you understand but you were not ready to listen!" Said Hermione with a smirk.
Ginny sighed. There was no point in hiding anymore. She maybe smart but not smart enough to fool Draco & Hermione!
“GINNY!!”
"Yeah Ron, you're probably right." Said Hermione but she didn't sound convinced at all.
With everything I’ve been through, she is the best thing that happened to me. I am the closest with her, she’s like the younger sister that I never had.
"Yeah well sorry about that! & hey I understood whatever you said.. it was wrong of me to expect so much from him right now, when obviously he's going through so much!"
“Okay fine!! Talk" I said.
"You said it didn't work! How much did you feed him!?" Inquired Hermione.
"Ohh I feel honoured!” I said in same dramatic way. “Now can you tell me the real reason!!?”
"Drake what!! You're hysterical!! I'm not hurt what are you talking about, I just told you a funny story & well -"
"Ron there's definitely something weird about this. My suspicions are getting strong. I'm not getting good vibes from this.. I need to find them."
Why can't she believe me! I've always been right about my instincts! Now this is making me so frustrated!
They all run towards the grand staircase.
"Wow! I- I'm speechless.. I just realised how childish I was being!! You- you understand him so well! If I didn't know any better I'd say you're in love with him!”
They couldn't find enough time to talk about all the random shit in the world, & now they're struggling to have even decent conversations. Where did all those words go?
"Well he's umm you know - well umm looking for some book." Said Ginny meekly. Her face turned scarlet red.
"Haha how sweet!!” I was still relieving from my laughing fit.. “Ohh poor Ginevra!! Okay well you can stay!" I said with a smile.
"Draco!! Hurry!"
“Of course it is! It’s one of the very rare & ancient book, I got this as a gift from my dear friend. I’ve read it like 3 times already!”
"Ohhh - Umm Nothing" I said sheepishly.
"And we can't waste anymore time, we have to get help!" Ginny nodded her agreement.
I don’t know what you people think of this story, please drop some hints. 😢
Draco looked at him and It took his breath away. Harry's handsome features & sharp jawline, dilated pupils & parted lips were creating such a raw, chaotic picture that it was capable enough to bring anyone on their knees. His beauty was simply magnificent. And it was all for his Draco.
They casted spell after spell! Each one stronger than the previous one, But Nothing worked! That door didn't even budge.
"It feels like something is!" Said Hermione with worrying tone.
"Woah can't believe! Ginny is friendly with the ferret too! Treacherous!! My sister!! My OWN SISTER!!" Said Ron with a huff!
"Draco! I hate you!" She said with a huff.
"Ohh merlin's beard, you did not just call potion interesting !!" She said with a mock gasp.
"WHAT IS HAPPENING! WHY IT'S NOT WORKING!!?"
"I really tried to give space to Harry, I-I swear I tried to cope with what he's going through." She said that looking directly at Draco with guilt in her eyes.
And also: Harry loves Draco sooooooo god damn much, can you tell? 😉 I tried to convey that!
"Ohh hey sorry guys, am I interrupting something? Are you okay?"
"Ginny There's no point in lying , I saw you putting some liquid in his drink. Now don't waste the time. You better start explaining everything!" Said Hermione.
"Your face!! Hahaha... I know silly! I was just joking! I was trying to break the tension!" She said sheepishly.
“Hermione it’s a pregnancy potion mixed with lust potion of ancient time, with this chances of getting pregnant is 100% so if I’ll get pregnant maybe Harry will take things forward, you know he’s been very distant lately.”
"Ohh Salazar help me!"
Hermione was stunned after hearing this information.
"Ronald really!!? Again!!? Give it a rest please !" Hermione replied him before I could say anything.
I interrupt her. “I know you enough to know when there’s something wrong, when you're hurting & when you're sad! And btw I know that you didn't just stop me reading to tell me how Proff  Trelawney tripped over that stupid fortune telling ball! Or how your roommate accidentally set her curtains on fire & how you tried to prank Ron with roofie filled muffins!!"
Heyyyyya how’s the chapter??
"Why is he looking at me like that! Ginny what did you do with the potion!!?" Draco asked with fear.
"No yeah I'm good! No it's just my mind is wandering today." I said
"Ohh great , here we go again!" Said Hermione with obvious irritation in her voice.
chapter was long so I divided it into two parts. I’m posting second part tomorrow. See you in next update.
"Ohh Salazar this is one of the many reasons why you shouldn’t be allowed here!!"
he was struggling under Harry to get himself out of Harry's grasp, but he was not succeeding at all.
"I-I don't know what you're talking about!" Said Ginny.
"Reducto"
Those emerald green eyes used to look at her with such warmth & love, how did they become so cold now? When did those smiles stopped coming her ways? He smiles now too, but it doesn't feel so genuine.
thank you so much for reading this!
Hermione, Ginny and Draco were running towards the exit of the library. If someone had told them that one day they'd be terrified of Harry, they wouldn't have believed that. But sadly it was their reality now. Their friend had tuned into a foe. Their sweet, innocent Harry was gone and he was replaced by this wild maniac.
"I know I don't even deserve to apologise for what I've done, but I'm really sorry. I didn't think of it Dra- "
But sadly I can't do anything about it! How could I break her heart! How could I tell her that my heart no longer belongs to her!
It’s a little back story before our actual plot starts. So be patient dears! See you soon in next chapter!
"I I don't know. I thought maybe if I get pregnant, that child will bring us closer then ever. It will ignite the fire of love between us once again." She said with remorse. She was not able to look them in the eyes.
"When you feed someone 2 spoonfuls, that person becomes euphoric. Lust clouds his mind completely. He makes a move on feeder, but he can still get control over himself. If feeder wants to stop, he can stop himself & will respect the feeder's choice."
Today is a Sunday! What a wonderful day, no classes, no rush! I can do my breakfast early, when there are very few people present in a great hall. No more staring eyes of people. Eyes that look through me, piercings my soul, make my skin crawl! Those eyes Full of judgemental looks! Some stare with suspicion, some stare with hatred. I’ve been experiencing this a lot lately, ever since I moved out of the slytherin dormitory. & obviously me being pals with Potter & Gang definitely raised many eyebrows! (Slytherin eyebrows) so it was safe for me to go for a breakfast when no rush is there. My train of thoughts were disturbed by the knock on my door. So I got up to check my door.
Sorry for the late update guys!
Ginny looked down, she didn't say anything.
Physical distance between them was not a major issue for her, it was his demeanour, his behaviour. It was changed or at least she felt that way.
"Certus Graviditatum." Said Ginny.
She was crying in frustration.
Harry crushed all the attempts of Draco to break free. He was fuming. He couldn't understand why Draco was denying him his love. It made him little upset too. He quickly made his clothes disappear with wandless spell. Harry was completely naked now.
"Look I'm sorry for asking this again! I know he's a changed man now. It's just sometimes I can't help myself, sometimes I still -"
Harry quickly gained his control back. He grabbed Draco's ankles with both hands and dragged him back.
Suddenly Potter's weight lifted from him. A wave of relief washed over him. So maybe Potter regained control after all, but then he heard the tale tell sound of a zip opening. His eyes shot open. He saw that Harry was taking off his pants. Draco's eyes widen in fear and he tried to crawl away from him. But before he can move Harry grabbed him once again.
"well that's funny. But it could be just some tonic or medicine, Hermione. Or a prank! You know Ginny & how crazy she is, right?"
"I think we should find them right now. I'm 100 percent sure there's something wrong. My gut feeling is telling me." She said with a slight panic.
"No ginny we won't let anything happen to him." She said fiercely.
"Well there is one way. Ron can you get marauders map from Harry's trunk? Asked Hermione.
[TBC]
"You're frowning 'mione. & why do you keep looking in Harry's direction? I'm noticing this for a while now, is anything wrong?" Said Ron.
Draco was aware that all the potions in that book were extremely dangerous & very fatal. So the thought of Harry consuming any of that was unbearable to him. His heart was beating faster. He was really frustrated, he was angry at Ginny for being so stupid, but mainly he was very scared for HIS Harry. He just wanted to see him in instant, to make sure that he's okay.
"How about you tell us, where is Potter?" Said Draco. He asked for Harry once again. He didn't understand why he felt so agitated when he didn't see Harry on entering the library. He  remember telling Hermione that he was worried for Ginny and that's the reason why he wanted to come with her, So why doesn't he feel at peace after seeing her??! Why he's desperately looking for certain green eyed boy!
. >>>>
I really want Ron to move past this bad blood between us!
Hermione was really frustrated at this point. Her magic never failed her before, but today it was an exception. She failed to help Draco, twice!
It was a beautiful day in Hogwarts. Beautiful sunny day. Many of the Students were outside the castle. Some of them were Practising Quidditch. Some of them were playing exploding Snap. Some of the students were sitting in the groups, observing everything around & chitchatting among themselves. Some chose to stay in castle playing wizard's chess. & some of them were utilising this holiday to study (like Hermione) & get homework done.
She was thinking harder. & suddenly one thought popped in her head.. "where all the knowledge of dark articles available in the Hogwarts?! The restricted section!"  This is too dangerous But she really wanted to do it. Now all she needs, is a good plan.
Hey lovely people! Here comes the first chapter! Now I’m starting this story properly.
"Ron we've been through this thousands of times! Yes we should trust him, he's changed now & He needs our help!" I replied him tiredly.
"As you wish Harry!" Said Ron, "& btw I'll think about what you said today! I'll try to befriend that git!" He said with a sigh.
It's easier said than done! & how does Draco even know about this pain anyway!! He never experienced how heart shattering it is, to witness the person you love slowly turning into a stranger!! Yes stranger.
Ron didn't make any attempt to join their venture. Hermione and Draco didn't wanna waste any time. They felt as if each passing second is crucial, so they ran towards the library.
"well why not Hermione!? He's acting very suspicious! He's very quiet, it's like he's trying to avoid any unnecessary attention. He's not even making stupid remarks on us in the classroom & he -"
How in the name of Merlin that happened! How could Harry be immune to spells! It didn't make sense at all. They were shocked by this, but they didn't have time to react. Cause Potter was right behind their backs. So they kept running.

“This is revenge,” Malfoy said matter-of-factly.
“Just a dream? You think he’ll believe it was just a dream?” Harry asked.
"Everything else was pretty simple after that! I sneaked all the required ingredients from prof. Snape's store. And then I brew potion in abandoned bathroom. It was not a difficult task for me. Today finally it was ready to use. So I spiked Harry's drink with it." She finished her confession in a small voice & then looked down.
Maybe cause it was always there.. that little something between us! That passion between us, Only now I'm seeing it in a different light!
"Ginny that's really-"
That potion was banned now, so it was not available anywhere. So the Only option was to brew it by herself. But the method of brewing &  it's ingredient list were not given in this book. Her smile disappeared. She really wanted this potion.
“Okay” She said & signed. “It's- it’s Harry!"
"Ron it's not time for being childish. Draco is our FRIEND. Besides he's close with Ginny, he might know something." Said Hermione.
“Promise to be careful first! Cause my books are like my precious kids, if I see ONE SINGLE TORN PAGE GINEVRA.-“
"Draco what happened!?" Asked Hermione worriedly.
"Ron I really hope that you're right, but my nerves are driving me crazy. My instincts are telling me that something is very off. I hope I'm wrong but I just wanna be sure." Said Hermione.
"But Draco, Last time I checked you're not my blood related! Duh!" She said.
Harry's whole body was trembling with lust, it was so powerful, like he never felt before. He simply couldn't wait anymore. He leaned towards Draco.
"Oh no it's nothing. You caught me off guard is all."
"Ginny!! Pregnancy potion!!? Are you crazy!? What were you thinking!!?" Hermione asked once she regained some control.
"You said she put something!? What did it look like?"
& well Draco hasn't shown any signs that he's into me!
"Potter I can't please! I-I don't want this. I'm- I'm n-not ready. Don't do this to me please."
"Ginevra you fool!! How could you use 3 spoons! Do you have any idea what you have done!?" Said Draco completely horrified.
She sounded sincere!
Well clearly I am not the one who's being blind! Why can't they see it. There's something fishy going on with Malfoy. I've known him for years! I know how snarky little bitch he is! No seriously,Why can't they see it!!
"Well if you try to use the things on your face called EYES you will be able to see that I'm reading" I said with Sarcasm.

“For food,” Draco said.
“We just-!”
"No... no." Draco's breathing hitched out of nervousness and fear.
“Yes! I’m pregnant with my rapist’s bastard!” Draco spat out while he cried. “I can’t do this. I just can’t do this anymore! I’m exhausted. I’m done.” Draco moved to sit on the stone railing facing Harry and swung one of his legs over it.
''I'm fine! I've just been studying too hard lately. Please, I just want to go back to my room. Please.'' Draco ended his sentence with a desperate pleading look to Dumbledore. ''I'm okay. I promise I am okay.'' He practically begged in a higher pitched voice.
''N... no. Why would I do that?'' He muttered as he trembled involuntarily in Harry's arms. His features paled more than usual as he looked down at a random point on Harry's chest, avoiding his gaze.
Draco stirred quietly under his covers in the dark that the heavy bed curtains drowned his bed in. He was not awake, but he was not quite asleep either. Like flashes of lightening, he relived the rape, over and over, feeling Harry’s breath on his body, the hard touches that felt like they were scorching him with their heat, and the pain. Oh god. The pain. Jumping through his body like a freight train, giving no reprieve, no end to his suffering. He tossed himself to his side, curling into himself as he murmured under his breath things he never could say in his waking hours. That’s how he found himself when he woke a few hours later, exhausted and covered in sweat, achy and trembling. Groaning softly to himself, he peeked through his bed curtains to find that the others will still all nestled in their beds sleeping or hiding in them. Who knew as their bed curtains were still drawn against the bright morning. Either way, he would have uninterrupted access to the shower. He slipped from beneath his sheets, stopping only to grab fresh school robes and to slip into the shared bathroom.
Unfortunately, he just missed Draco, before the other boy hit the ground. Landing his broom, Harry jumped off it, running to Draco’s side. There was blood everywhere, his limbs angled wrong, but his eyes were open, and he was barely breathing.
Draco blinked in the brilliant light suddenly appearing in his sight as he winced from the pain of laying prone on his back. As he squinted, he noticed the worried face of Professor Dumbledore looking down at him holding his wand up with the tip lit up, causing him to flinch back from him with a moan of pain.
“How can you not remember? You’ve been treating me the same as you did that night Potter!” Draco spit out.
"No... Harry! Don't do this! Please...please Harry! Let me go. I won't talk about this to anyone! I promise!" His begs fell on deaf ears as Harry's grin only grew bigger.
