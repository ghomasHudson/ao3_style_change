Draco turned to look at the doorway and tilted his head to the side. Someone was outside. He placed the mug down on the counter and walked to the door, not forgetting to Accio his wand into his hand before opening it.
“I was…” Harry said breathlessly, he chuckled and remained on the ground, not moving an inch “I was going to surprise you”
” Draco rasped, chuckling a bit when Harry still kept thrusting in him slowly “Still not satisfied?”
” He exclaimed when Harry started thrusting, he arched his back, pushing back when the Auror shoved in. Draco placed his arm on the wall and leaned his forehead on it, he was blabbering incoherent words every time Harry jammed in, his cock angled at just the exact spot, hitting that bundle of nerve and bringing Draco closer to climax
Ron yelled, suddenly locking Harry’s arms and shoulders from behind when the door to their office was barged open with Blaise, Dean, Seamus and Neville running to his chair as quick as a flash
“10 Galleons Ginny will get drunk again tonight and pass out” Harry leaned over, his face close to Draco’s ear, making the blond shiver with goose bumps
He looked at his finger, a drop of blood emerging from his skin, it wasn’t big, just a small cut, possibly from the crack on the mirror. Draco stepped back, suddenly feeling all dizzy, he took a huge breath in, the place was spinning around him, that was when he lost balance and everything went black.
“Oh no, they’ve never dated each other. They always say they’re like brother and sister” Pansy shook her head, showing another picture of Hermione sitting in the library with Blaise and Ron focused on a book next to her “I took this one, she’s pretty, right? For Ron there, he’s shacking up with Blaise” Pansy whispered “What they’re doing is purely physical, but what they’re feeling is definitely romantic, but Ron won’t admit it, they didn’t even tell anyone they’re sleeping together yet, that’s what I think” Draco stood frozen on the ground, what kind of sick world was he in? Did he get transported into another world? Where Granger was with Pansy, Blaise doing it with Weasley, and Potter was his boyfriend?
“You’re sure you can guess?” He asked, he didn’t really believe Harry could know everything, moreover, he was the expressive type of person, Draco should be the one to guess. On the other hand, Harry might not understand the action he has to do do “Alright, I’ll act” He could feel Harry nodding and watched as Seamus and Padma standing up.
“Ron, Harry, sit down” Hermione ordered them, and even though her tone was soft, Draco can still feel the threat in it
“How do you know that?” He turned the question back to Harry because it was true, Draco rarely ever got the flu, he always took care of himself
“Can I see it?” Harry silently pulled out the small black box in his inside pocket, he has been carrying the ring for months but since he started avoiding Draco, the box has been left in his drawer “Know why you suddenly brought this with you today?” Ron held the box in his hand, opening it and picked up the ring.
“Well, my godfather, Sirius, told me there’s another mirror that’s the opposite of this one, a mirror of desire, but they also say two things like that could never be at the same place” Harry said, looking up at the mirror “Which would explain that maybe the other mirror you see is probably the Mirror of Desire. That must have happened to my Draco, he must have seen this one, had the same reactions like you, and somehow, you two switched places”
“He broke up with me” Theodore sniffled, burying his face in Draco’s white shirt. Theodore was still a bit flirty here as he was in the other world, but it was different there. He has more boyfriends than friends, but no one has ever stayed too long with him, they were all arses “Said I was just a toy for him to play, Draco”
They both turned to look at the Hogwarts yard, where Luna was standing, waving at the redhead. Ginny gave Draco one last curious look before walking away. He knew Ginny would be stubborn, she has every right not to trust him, but he was hoping maybe Luna’d be able to help him. Draco clutched tightly on his books and walked away as well, he needed to find a few more people.
“Is this an invitation?” Ron stopped in front of the table and looked at him, his lips pressed against each other. There was a Muggle chess board on the table, Draco actually had no idea who put it there, and he only sat down because everyone already hogged up all the available chairs, but Draco could not let a chance like this go
in there” She tilted her head playfully “Uncle Ron said you’re playing poking. Can I play too?” Draco became speechless at their daughter’s question while Harry just started laughing
“Of course not” Pansy reassured him “Well, unless my wife calls, but don’t worry, she gets it” Pansy patted his shoulder to calm his nerves, Draco took a deep breath and knocked on the door “It will be okay”
“And why? To humiliate myself?” Draco put the jar back in the box once he was done and picked up the lotion “Stand up”
” He mumbled, his hand stroking his own cock. Theo cried out, his back arched, his cock spurting over his stomach, his mouth fell opened and pulled Neville in a kiss, he clenched his entrance and heard Neville groaning a small “
“Oh, well” Draco stuttered, he finished his first bruschetta as well and sipped a bit on his champagne before speaking “Do you remember, that one time I asked you what I should do if I like someone and they’re too oblivious to see it?”
“Thank you” Draco huffed out a laugh and looked at Harry, whose eyes were exceptionally green, and Draco loved green “He is a jerk, it’s alright, I guess, it made me see him for who he actually is”
“Well…” Pansy tilted her head “I kind of walked in on him in his bathroom, well, he was showering and I was in a rush so I just barged in and…the rest is history”
, I-I want to” Draco said and Potter slowly leaned down, he caught the blond in a soft and chaste kiss, Potter sucked on his bottom lip slowly, slithering his tongue inside when Draco gave him access, he arched into it and stood on his tiptoes, wanting to taste more
too familiar. What was this guy doing? How was he doing this? Harry kept asking himself, hitching his breath as the guy turned around and straddled Harry, climbing into his lap as he wrapped his arms around his neck, he hovered his arse just above Harry’s crotch, slightly touching, significantly making Harry harder than he already was, just teasing him there. He circled his arse like he was trying to paint a masterpiece on Harry’s lap, his hands caressing the Auror’s hair, as he touched the nape of his neck, Harry let out a low grumble and locked eyes with the blond again. But this time, he saw something, he has grey eyes, Harry wasn’t sure if the lighting of the room was deceiving him or not. Harry trailed his eyes down the guy’s body and stopped when he saw a glimpse of something.
“I just think that, well, since I’ve been single for a while now, I’d like to get back on the field”
“Well, I cleaned all the shits that was in it” Pansy shrugged and walked to their spot, her heels clicking on the floor “So…excited to know why I called you guys in?”
“You’re just grumpy because you can’t get Neville to like you” Pansy pursed her lips into a smirk and flipped a finger at Theo, which earned a gasp from him
“So, how did the fire happen?” Harry asked with a smile, he was curious. Even if Draco wanted to lie, he couldn’t, he felt the urge to spill out everything to the firefighter right there and then
“Good night” Draco replied under his breath. He wasn’t sure how he’s going to act tomorrow around Potter, but he still has to face it and he will face it like the brave Auror he was
“I can’t believe you’ve been mine for more than twenty years” Harry said, holding up Draco’s hand and planting a kiss on his palm “It’s surreal”
“For your information” Draco said proudly, resting his legs across Harry’s lap “The first time was good” He paused, smirking a bit “So were the second and third time”
Draco muttered breathlessly in Harry’s ear and he just has to obey, pushing the third finger in, opening Draco up nicely. Draco has got a small tattoo four years ago, it was in the shape of a small Ukrainian Ironbelly dragon, sleeping soundly on the left side of Draco’s chest. Harry has always loved it because whenever he touched the tattoo, the dragon would wake up, flapped its wings and curled back up into a ball to sleep, and it only did that to Harry. He remembered the times everyone of their friends tried to make it move, but Harry was the only one being able to rile it up. Harry placed a soft kiss on the tattoo and watched the dragon woke up again, flapping its wing and opened its mouth to roar soundlessly before going back to sleep. The Auror chuckled and leaned up to connect their lips again, slower this time, his fingers still working Draco’s inside.
Three weeks until Harry’s birthday, so far, they haven’t talked in a week after he played chess with Ron in the Gryffindor Common Room. Harry has just been staring at him a lot lately, making Draco doubt himself. Did he think Draco was up to something again? He was, but it was just to prove whether he was right or not. Draco closed his eyes and breathed out, he hoped he’d be right.
Draco realised he liked Potter since December. He had freaked out about it, and he was in denial for two months, thinking that could never be true, that they were just friends. As it turned out, the line between love and hate was thin, and the line was broken the moment Potter made him warm with no spell at all. Pansy was always there, convincing him that their feelings were mutual, that Potter liked him as well, but he couldn’t confirm it, not until Potter said it to his face.
shrugged and gave him a crooked smile “I’m sorry I broke your door, protocol…I mean I always need to find the quickest way in”
“I’m sore” He said, and locking his arms and legs around Harry “Carry me up in your bedroom, would you?”
“See? It’s exactly why I gave up” Draco pulled his hand back and looked at Harry once last time “If you have remembered, we’d have been something…
“Are you and uncle Draco not talking now?” She said, climbing up and sat next to Harry, leaning on Harry’s arm “Do you hate uncle Draco now?”
“Okay, because if you kiss me, I will hex you” Draco stated, watching the way Potter chuckled and nodded at him. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, he could hear the rustling sound in front of him, then Potter stepped forward.
Draco hissed softly when something hit his arm, he turned to his left to see Pansy and Granger at the next table, Granger was putting rose petals in the cauldron as Pansy was glaring at him
, don’t you remember? He confessed to you during a Quidditch match? Last year?” Pansy said the same thing as Potter but Draco wasn’t able to say anything, so she kept going “He caught the snitch, when he flew to you, he gave you the snitch and said that he likes you. The crowd went crazy, Harry’s dad cried a bit. Everyone said it’s the confession of the century”
“Well, if you don’t want to” Draco huffed and lied back down on his back, barely a millisecond passed by and Harry was already on him, with his arms on either sides of Draco’s head
“I’m not your own private Healer” He said when Potter finally managed to utter out a sentence after scratching at his nape. It’s been more than two months that Potter kept visiting the hospital wing, Draco couldn’t believe someone would love damaging their own body so much like that “Why do you even go here for this scratch when you could have just healed it yourself?”
“Pansy’s putting words in your mouth, isn’t she?” Harry squinted his eyes at Ron, it sounded more like Pansy than him, and he knew how much Pansy kept hanging out with Ron these days, with them going to fancy parties every week with their partners
flew in my eyes, Harry” The redhead smacked Potter and they both laughed quietly while Robards got back to talking about the current case they were discussing, before Pansy barged in
“Yeah” He turned to look at the door and wondered who it could be, their friends would just Floo in, or they’d walk in like their own house. Pansy got off her seat and walked to open the door
“You know when I told you guys I’d order a stripper for Harry’s birthday?” He asked, he felt so guilty for messing up his only assignment when he had begged the girls to let him do it
wouldn’t even be the exact word to describe it, he actually ripped it apart and he could hear buttons hitting the wooden floor. The sound of the belt clacking when he undid the blond’s trousers and let it fell on the ground, Draco stepped out of it and kicked the trousers to the other side of the living room, gluing their figures together again.
Draco took off his blindfold the same time as Harry and he was completely dazed by the sight in front of him.
for you, Draco” Ron murmured to him, the redhead wasn’t the one to say sentimental things like this, so it must be the last resort to see him telling Draco this “And you know who’s the right one for you, Draco, you’re smart, you know that”
“Come on, you can tell me” Draco poked his arm, he never thought one day he could see Ronald Weasley blushing like this. The old him would have been mean about this, but he wouldn’t want to ruin their friendship now “I won’t tell Blaise”
“They’ll be in like…three seconds” Hermione looked at the watch Pansy gave her on her birthday and turned to the door, Draco’s heart raced a bit when it opened, he realised a few familiar faces, but no sign of Harry
“That’s interesting” Draco hummed, she could spend more time with Hermione then, she seemed to need it “Blaise, what about you? Don’t you tutor Ron today?”
“So, seven?” Harry turned around and gave Draco the brightest smile ever, the blond hasn’t felt this way for a long time, maybe in years “I’ll pick you up”
“Okay, maybe sit down on a chair?” Blaise suggested, and Seamus pushed the chair in for Ron, the redhead just turned the chair around and straddled it, and the dragon changed its location, moving to the hand Ron rested on the back of the chair.
” Draco urged her, pushing her away as she let out a loud laugh, leaving the courtyard quickly while Potter approached him. His lips formed into a frown, folding his arms together “You’re late, Potter”
“I love him with all my heart” He said, without much time he already knew the answer, he loved Draco more than he could ever say, more than he could ever express. He didn’t know he was able to love a person this much, but when Draco came into his life, he felt blessed “He’s the first person to make me feel all sorts of things, I want to protect him, I want to be with him, I want to love him. I can’t imagine a day without him, without seeing his face, his smile, or his insults that I know he didn’t mean it” Harry smiled, fiddling with his hands, he loved Draco’s nagging and bickering, he knew that it was Draco’s way of showing him that he loved him
“Oh, well…” Harry couldn’t find any word to say, he wasn’t even sure how to react. Draco has a boyfriend, worse, that ruined Harry’s secret plan “Did you two, er, you know, did the thing yet? Wait no, sorry, that was nosy”
Draco yelled at Ginny’s suggestion, leaving the phone there and ran to the kitchen to search for things, anything to put out the fire and stopped the smoke detector from screaming,
“Are you obsessed with hospitals and getting yourself injured?” Draco chuckled dryly, he gripped tightly on his robes, still feeling Potter’s gaze on him. The Gryffindor wasn’t subtle, he probably didn’t know how to be subtle to save his life “So, what are you going to become? An Auror?”
“I love you” Harry kissed him and quickly ran out of their house, Draco settled down back on the couch and breathed out heavily. It’s been years, more than fifteen years they’ve been together, twelve years as a married couple, Draco has gotten used to it, used to the fact that Harry could not always be there for him. He never hated Harry’s job, saving people was always what Harry loved doing, and Draco loved that about him. It was Draco’s 40
“Only if you want to offer yourself as his present” Pansy said, rolling her eyes with a grin. Draco stayed silent, he really should he figuring out how to act tomorrow, since Harry’d definitely be there.
“I know, I know” Harry said, opening the door to his and Ron’s office, settling down on his chair “It’s so hard, Draco’s just so…”
“Did you just apologise to them too?” Draco turned around, surprised to see Ginny standing in front of him, her eyes still squinting like he was a suspect in a crime
“How do you know?” He said, his eyes still looking at Potter, who was smiling brightly in a crowd of students, he would notice that smile anywhere
“Let me prove it to you” Harry mumbled, kissing Draco’s temple as they stood there under the water quietly, the blond felt something in his stomach, something in his mind saying...he trusted Harry, and he decided to listen to it.
” Pansy tilted the phone back to show her face and she glared at him, pointing her finger at the screen “You
“I can read minds” Pansy winked at the guy “And, you can let Draco make up for it by asking him out to dinner”
couldn’t even process it. All those years, you guys built up this friendship, and thanks to your friendship with Draco, we were able to be friends with the Slytherin, and I was able to find love with Blaise. Why would you risk 7 years of friendship and throw it away just because of one small problem?”
“Depends” She chewed on her lower lip, she was probably still torn between accepting it or not “Would you want anything in return?”
“As if” Draco huffed out a breath and focused on the lecture again, he could not care less about a guy whose hair was so messy, it blocked Draco’s view of the professor. Maybe Pansy was right, it wasn’t his business.
“Maybe we could beat him up” Ginny added in, leaning into the screen with a grin, making Draco chuckled “I could take him down easily, break him in half, if you’d like”
“Do you think people will fix the lift soon?” Theo asked, his hands touching the small stubble around Neville’s jawline
“Yeah, I hate the cold but I like snow, it’s beautiful, fragile” He said, letting the snow fall on his open palms as Potter kept his focus on him. He shivered slightly, the cold would be too much to handle soon.
“It’s on your hand, Weasley” Draco pointed at his left hand and Ron laughed loudly after he realised he was holding his beer
“I better tell Ron that” Harry hummed, stopping them suddenly as Draco looked at him “Oh, do you remember the time I broke my shoulder?”
“Don’t worry, you two can resolve it” Lilian touched his hand and walked away. She sounded just like Pansy and Hermione when they comforted him a day after their breakup. He was a mess of tears and snots, he has bags under his eyes and his lips were so dry since he didn’t eat nor drink. He holed up in his bedroom and it took Pansy three weeks to finally pull him to the kitchen and the living room. The first month was the hardest, the worst part was when he still found Harry’s stuff in his place, his scent on Draco’s bed, it all felt so emotional to him.
The second round he got the word “Dancing”, which made him started dancing like in the Yule Ball but with an invisible person, and so they have also got the answer quickly. The third was a “Riding a dragon”, the fourth was a hard one, it was “Buying a wand”, however by some magical ways, Harry’s got it all. Him and Harry were the ones that have the highest points with Seamus and Padma, while Romilda and Ron have the lowest, Ernie and Theodore got one point and their coordination was horrible. Dean and Parvati were okay, scoring two points. And for Neville and Hannah, the coordination was definitely better there, with them scoring three out of five.
“You’re too easy to read, Ron” Draco said, pulling out the blush from his box “Blaise can be a manslut, yes, but he can be serious when he wants to, so no, he isn’t fucking anyone outside”
“Weasley always forget his, I just don’t want to be waiting for him to transform his own book into a quill again” Blaise said, Draco gave him a little smile, knowing it actually did improve a bit now, he was fine to keep going.
“Arch rivals? What do you mean? We’ve always been best friends” Potter said, his eyebrows furrowed and making Draco even more appalled at the sentence.
” Harry called out loud, stopping Pansy from knocking the door to Draco’s flat, he ran to their spot and took the box back from Pansy’s hand, standing in front of the door to block the girls from entering, he breathed out heavily and shoved the box back in his pocket, he rested his hands on his knees and started calming his breathing
“She…she thinks I could find something here” He mumbled, finding a way to resolve this apparently “And you?”
“You might realise that faster than Pansy or Blaise” He chuckled and let Theodore leaned on his shoulder “And? What are you going to do about it?”
Draco couldn’t sleep, he opened his eyes and felt the empty air behind him. Since he lashed out at Potter during dinner, the Gryffindor has stopped doing everything that might make Draco uncomfortable,
Harry turned sideways to see Blaise changing the music into something slow and sexier. This couldn’t be…
, Harry” Pansy scoffed and Harry quickly zipping his trousers up, his cheeks heating up “I mean I get that you want to do the
“Oh” Harry rolled his sleeves up, revealing the Muggle watch on his wrist and looked at it before answering “Ten minutes until midnight”
“I’m playing hide and seek with James, and I thought he was here” Hannah pouted “What are you two doing?”
” Draco demanded and Harry didn’t dare disobey, he pushed the third digit in and curled them, earning a loud moan from Draco, he could feel how aroused the blond got just from his grip on Harry’s hair
“Oh, if so” Harry swallowed and continued, he better let it all out before Draco left again, he was a Gryffindor after all, he could say it, he could
It was unnerving, Draco started to doubt himself, because what if this was a universe where all of his friends got together, but not him and Harry? Draco couldn’t get the uneasy feeling in him to stop. He didn’t know how to patch things up with him, how to apologise to him after what he said, or how to even tell Harry he liked him. How was that even possible? He wasn’t used to expressing this, love, as they called it. Maybe it was a Slytherin thing, he never heard his parents said that word to each other, or his friends saying it with their lovers, or maybe Draco was just emotionally closed off and unable to express it. Now that Harry and Ginny were probably getting back together, he began to think, maybe Harry and him were just not meant to be after all.
“It’s nothing, we are just in the same situation” He shrugged, he had come to Draco yesterday to tell him how he felt back then, how he also had a fight with Blaise, and how he gathered up his courage to tell his parents, and that their opinions won’t matter even if they want to forbid it. Draco had surprisingly accepted it, he guessed time really changed them. Eight years ago, they graduated Hogwarts thinking they’d never meet anyone from school again, but now they were closer than ever, than he could ever imagined. He was friends with the people he didn’t think he’d ever talk to, he got married to a man that he used to think was a stone cold, heartless person, who turned out to be a man that treasured him the most. Life was good to him “I’m just glad they made up, do you know how annoying it is to see Harry moping around?”
Draco might seem calm outside but inside, he was screaming and kicking, he picked up the concealer and applied it on the spot under Harry’s eyes “Did you always stay up so late? Probably because of cases, right?” He laughed awkwardly and began dabbing Harry’s face with the sponge “You need to take care of it better”
“No, I…I want to talk to him a bit more” Draco said, his hand squeezing Harry’s thigh “You guys should go”
“Nah, he’s my husband, he’s like an egg, hard on the outside and soft on the inside” Ron waved him off and sighed “No matter what anyone thinks, he’s actually really sweet and he never does anything when he gets jealous except talking it out. This is merely a competition and I am winning, and he’s going to have to buy me food if he loses”
“We will go up and change our clothes, then we’ll go down and have a taste of Luna’s cake, alright?”
“Er, oh, I, I mean…I didn’t mean that, I just…I was just saying nonsense, er, don’t, don’t worry about that, nonsense, really”
“Are you serious? I’ve had enough with Gryffindor” She pulled at his collar and lowered her voice “I have to talk to Granger, see her, listen to her every single day now. Do you know how annoyed I am? I rolled my eyes so much, it hurts!”
“Sorry” Pansy gave Hermione a peak on the cheek and turned to Draco “He will know eventually, the truth always comes out”
“If we take a bath now and do it the second time, would you have enough data to compare to your first time?”
She glared at the both of them, and in the 14 years being friends with Hermione, he knew one thing, he should
“Harry, what’s going on?” He asked, it was weird, all their friends acting like they were in the past
“I don’t have my wand” Potter said and Draco glanced at his left hand, sending daggering looks back at the Gryffindor.
“Greengrass? Astoria Greengrass?” Pansy asked and Lucius nodded, since she was the only girl left. Daphne had gotten married to Millicent Bulstrode years ago and they have already moved to France “
“Can you do my nails? I want to look gorgeous, drop dead gorgeous tomorrow” Theodore showed his hands and Accio a few nail polish bottles from his trunk “Pansy, I need your help too”
“I just, I was wondering if you want to have dinner tonight? You know, er, my boyfriend’s busy tonight, and I thought maybe you could join me…perhaps we could do a fake proposal to get free dessert again?” Draco said, his voice soft, Harry missed it so much. They haven’t had dinner in weeks, probably a month, Harry stopped caring for a while now “And, er, I sent you a few voicemail things, but I wasn’t sure I did it right, you know me and Muggle contraptions. So you probably didn’t get it anyway, but I, you know, do you want to join me?”
Draco laughed and looked at his own chest, the marks were a highlight now compared to the faded scars he had all those years ago. Draco jumped from the table down on his feet and quickly fell in Harry’s embrace, his body was still weak “
“I saw us in the mirror yesterday, that’s why I thought it was actually broken” He said, stepping even closer than before, making Draco’s mind explode like fireworks “I saw us in the mirror now, I realised my feelings for you yesterday after seeing you cried and had some doubts about whether the mirror could ever be broken or not, so I asked Hermione and it couldn’t be” He turned to it and Draco also saw themselves in the mirror again. He smiled, turning back to gaze into Harry’s eyes “You are who I desire, Draco, I desire your love and your affection, I like you, and I want to love you”
“Oh, oh” Hermione pulled out another box from her bag “You guys also have to pick one from here, it’s the month that you have to do”
Draco smiled as he stepped up “Did you ask me to move in because you were afraid I’d go out with Ernie?” He asked and Harry looked down, not meeting his eyes. Draco was tired of playing chasing, he needed the truth “Harry, why did you do that?”
agrees with her, just so you know” Hannah smirked, standing back on her feet and started mixing another drink when she noticed Draco’s glass has emptied “Your actions are obvious, I fail to see how both you and Harry manage to be crazily in love with each other but unable to see it yourselves. It’s weird, I tell you”
“I don’t know, I just feel like this is a special day for us” He said, kissing Draco’s cheeks “I want to love you in a special way today”
Draco opened the box and picked up the silver ring in his hands, his mouth falling open “How did you know?”
“Why does that matter so much to you? You like Potter or something?” She joked, but Draco sneered at the idea. He could never fall for such a sloppy guy that was way lower than his taste in people. He might be interested in men, which he found out just the beginning of Eighth Year, but he’d never go for Potter, even if they were the two last people on earth.
according to Draco. Almost every week, he’d take a man home and Ron has to cast a Silencing Charm to sleep. They have become friends, in a way, and from their daily lives together, Ron learned that Blaise wasn’t just a manslut, he was also loyal to his friends, he was hardworking, and he could cook. Before moving in, Ron had sworn to himself to
“Really?” Draco asked, he and Harry were supposed to be in the meeting probably half an hour ago, he was never late to meetings, thanks to his husband, now he missed it “
He groaned, he has heard enough of the nagging coming from everyone he knows, he could not take it anymore “Thirty is young”
“Yeah, I know that” Harry touched his hand and planted a kiss on the centre of his palm “I just want to be with you”
“Okay we had sex, it was brilliant, but, er” He paused and remembered how he felt the next morning. The empty side of the bed, the ruffled bedsheet, nothing left, he was alone “He left the next morning, or maybe right after I dozed off, I wasn’t sure, the next thing I knew, Pansy told me he moved to Paris, to be a Healer. I mean I thought we were friends before, I thought he’d tell me news like that”
” Draco slowed his movements and fiddled with the spoon, twirling it around the small soufflé bowl. Harry sensed something bad, he could feel it, Draco rarely stuttered, ever “I have something to tell you”
“Yeah, okay, I understand” Potter answered with a nod. Draco hummed and stood straight up again, signalling that he was done, but the Gryffindor made no movement to leave “Er, why didn’t you go home for Christmas and New Year?”
happened, Theo barely put him in any clothes, and then he was definitely sure he got another heart attack when Harry came to Pansy’s spot and she pulled out a snake from the cage
“He was stuttering, avoiding you, then he talked to Hermione and I, asking for our advice, he was a mess, he didn’t know how to act towards you anymore” She chuckled, hooking her arm around his “That’s when Anthony appeared, since he avoided you. Then he saw Anthony, getting all jealous, we told him to just confess to you, and he did, right at that Quidditch match. It took him just the right nudge to finally confess”
! What do you mean?” Pansy reached over and grabbed Draco’s hands to hold them in hers “I can do it for you. Just, don’t, don’t go on a date”
will no longer have my nice skin if you keep digging your utterly hard nails into my flesh” He pried her hand away and rubbed his sore arm “How’s planning the party? Did Granger let you bring alcohol in the party?”
“I know” Ron winked at him and pulled out his wedding ring from his pocket to put back on his finger “Throughout the years that I’ve been with him, that’s three years, Blaise’s probably the sweetest guy I could ever asked for, he sees me as his everything. When he got jealous the first time ever, he hugged me and asked if I’d leave him. That’s when I know he’s it for me” Ron said, looking at Blaise softly with a smile and gazing back at Draco “I could never imagine my life without him, and Ariel too”
“Oh, no” Draco shook his head, quickly coming up with a lie while Pansy nudged him with her foot from under the table “We thought that we might have shown…a lot of affection towards each other in public”
” He mumbled when Potter decided to slip his tongue inside Draco, he gave up and lied back down on the carpet, enjoying the feeling of Potter’s tongue swirling, breaching the blond opened. He grabbed on the Auror’s messy black hair and pushed in so he could go deeper “
for helping him realised what he should have seven years ago. Do you know your friend’s oblivious as hell?”
Draco murmured and Harry aligned himself between the blond’s legs, poking his hard cock at Draco’s entrance. As soon as he saw Draco flinching a little, he immediately locked their lips again, distracting Draco from the pain. Everyone knew Draco was a virgin, Pansy had accidentally spilt it out during one of the parties where she got too pissed, but whether Draco was a virgin or not, he just wanted their first time to be perfect, and making sure Draco wasn’t in too much pain was his first priority.
” He moaned when Neville started kneading his globes, the Auror was learning very quickly. Theo sat back up and moved down until he was kneeling between Neville’s legs, he bent down, his tongue licking a stripe across the Auror’s length
“Sure, I’ll call you again tonight to ask, just in case, and I’ll tell you the information for the party, if you decide to come” Potter gave him a smile,
“Yeah” Draco said, his back leaning on the wall, this was just the perfect position to be cornered by Potter. He couldn’t deny the number of times he had dreamt about Potter pining him on the wall and ravishing him passionately, but this was only a kiss “Just a kiss, right? No big deal”
“So, as I was saying, we, Hermione and I” Pansy hooked her arm around Hermione’s and smiled “Are making an Auror calendar!”
“There’s Celeste, you know her right?” Hermione asked, earning a nod from Draco. Just from the way the corner of his lips slightly moved, like it was almost a sneer. Pansy smirked, Draco hated that chick too “And well, there’s Cormac”
“Well, you didn’t mention whether the person is a girl or a guy, how could I know?” Ron protested and huffed loudly “You girls are mean”
“Don’t you see it?” Pansy stepped forward, making her way to Blaise and Ron’s spot, she opened Blaise’s jacket wide and Draco gaped when he saw the words on his inside shirt
“We have to stay here because we are waiting for everyone else to come, so we could all join dinner together” Pansy said, pouring out another glass for herself. They were all supposed to get together today for Neville’s big promotion to Head of Gryffindor house at such a young age, Theo was thrilled and forced everyone to go to celebrate it “Where’s everyone else anyway? I know my wife is held back at a meeting, but what about the rest?”
“I…might have” Draco grinned guiltily “I was in the middle of climax, Harry, I can’t control my behaviour, I barely remember anything”
“Oh” He grinned to himself as Harry walked to the living room and settled down next to him, the blond turned his head away to prevent himself from actually drooling from looking at Harry’s body, he received the cup from Harry’s hand and started drinking
” She put the finger on his lips, laughing quietly with a glass of Firewhisky in her hand “Have you seen my girlfriend? Small, blonde hair, smell like flowers and the forest after it rains, oh and look incredibly beautiful?”
” Draco looked down, avoiding Harry’s eyes. He had no memory of it, he didn’t even notice Harry before “Where did we first meet?
. Draco felt like he was having a déjà vu moment right now, the girls haven’t worn that shirts in months, he turned to Theo sitting next to them, he was ogling at Neville across the table until he noticed Draco
“Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” Draco and Harry both turned around when they heard Pansy from behind, she was grinning at them, banging her fisted hands on the table, urging them to kiss
“It’s fine, your friend ran to grab the eye drop right?” The man shrugged and smiled at Draco with one eye closed and one eye opened “I’m Harry by the way. Er, what’s your name?”
“Here, he was followed” The guy said to the other two people, Draco was still confused “Stay here” He told Draco and ran back with the redhead to the street Draco was just at
“Yes, don’t worry, Draco. I know they will love you just like I do” Harry said, turning to Draco and pulled him in by his waist, his hand slowly slithering down to grab at Draco’s arse as he buried his nose in the blond’s neck.
I just remember the funniest thing since you mentioned Luna, and now that I think about it, it’s pretty odd
“Hi, aren’t you supposed to be organising books with Pansy now?” He asked, watching her flopped down on the couch with a small frown on her face “Did she cancel?”
“That still doesn’t mean anything” He bit on his lower lip, remembering what happened the night before that made him run “You’re with Ginny”
Draco sobbed while leaning his phone on a mug on his table to continue talking. He was even hiccuping repeatedly, with tears streaming down his burning red cheeks, his nose was runny with snots and his face was wet from the tears
“I love you, and you are the one I love the most, I can’t think of anyone but you” Harry slowly retracted his hands and Draco hugged himself instead, fighting the cold now without his boyfriends’ hands, the sudden lost felt extreme. He heard the rustling sound in front of him, like Harry stepping on the snow under them “And you’re special to me, that’s why I want you to meet them” He said, pausing for a second “Open your eyes, Draco”
” He cursed softly, feeling Blaise hitting that sensitive spot inside him. He couldn’t believe he was letting Blaise fuck him in the bathroom stall right now, with his cock up in Ron’s arse, his hand on his waist, Ron felt hot all over. Blaise turned his face around for a kiss and Ron couldn’t even kiss him properly, since he was so focused on trying not to fall on his knees every time Blaise shoved in deep
made everyone helped” Ron said, nodding along with everyone “She Floo me at midnight asking me to do this, she really put her mind into this”
you love them, or like them, in your case. I fell for Pansy, the one person I didn’t think I would. And why? I mean, she used to be so mean”
we arrived when they were already in the room” He complained, when Pansy and him arrived together, they have noticed the clothes on the floor trailing to the bedroom, with small sounds coming from there every few minutes “Should we tell them we’re here?”
” He answered quickly, his tone high, he wanted to flee, but the bigger part of him wanted to stay, wanted to feel more of this. This feeling was intoxicating, yet he yearned for more, Draco was starting to panic.
They quickly broke off the kiss and saw Ron standing at the door in his brown sweater with his initial on, a signature look of the Weasley family. They grinned at the redhead and didn’t know what else to say “Why is it always me? It’s not like I want to see you guys snogging” He groaned, and Draco couldn’t deny that Ron had walked in on Harry and him many,
” Draco gasped, tears forming around his eyes as he stood up as well, extending his hand. Harry pulled the ring from the box and put it in Draco’s finger, it fits perfectly. The blond bent down and they met halfway for a hug, Harry has never felt so happy in his life.
“No, no! No matchmaking” He shook his head and cut off Pansy’s words, he has had enough with blind dates all his friends and colleagues have set him up with, none of it worked out well “Don’t you remember the last time?”
“Is this true?” Draco asked, he couldn’t answer Hermione, he wasn’t even sure how to act with this information in his head now “Potter…has feelings for me?”
Hermione added “Harry, would you mind helping me putting the food out on the table? And Rose, you know it’s dinner time”
“Kind of” He said, leaning close “Why? Did he tell you the story when he was a kid with a camera? Because he only does that to the people he trust”
“Can we all act mature in here?” Draco rolled his eyes and leaned back on his booth “We are 25 already for Merlin’s sake”
“Oh, nothing much” Pansy shook her head, pointing her wand at Draco’s clothes and transformed it into a dress robes, startling the blond. Rose started running to Draco’s spot and smiled at him
“Oh, I’m Harry. I’m in apartment 3A, the one opposite to yours?” The guy said, putting the fire extinguisher on the ground and examined the bucket.
over Weasley” Theo teased, laughing loudly with Pansy as Draco held back a chuckle “They have been playing Quidditch all year, Weasley is the Keeper and Blaise is the Chaser, he’s bound to like Weasley sooner or later”
likely to pass out in the middle of the dance floor right now, I better hurry” Luna said “I just came back to get my coat”
Draco murmured to himself while walking past the place he’s always come before. When the room showed itself, Draco opened it to get in. The room was empty as always, wide and dark, with the mirror standing in the middle of the room. When Draco got closer to it, he noticed there was still the same crack on the mirror, exactly like last time when he shot that Expulso spell to make it explode. There it was again, him and Harry together, holding hands. He felt horror the first time he saw it, but now, the aching in his heart was the only thing he felt.
He murmured in his ear and Draco smacked him playfully, Harry chuckled and licked the spot under his ear, sucking on the skin there “
“Alright, you know what? We’re going to go first” Pansy gave them a frown and pulled Hermione along with her “
“Still a tease” Draco smirked, breaking off their kiss and grabbed Harry’s hands, placing them directly on Draco’s arse “Just how bad do you want me, Auror Potter?”
“Horrifying? Absolutely” Pansy nodded, her eyes glued on Draco’s. She’d have to make Ron agree to side with her lies tomorrow when Draco asked him about it, and she knew he would, her talent was manipulating people “So, just choose.
“Hey, I’m Brad” The guy extended his hand and immediately touched Draco’s while smirking “I noticed you earlier and I just wanna say, you look extremely hot and I can’t wait to strip your clothes off. What’s your name?”
“Yeah, it is” Draco nodded “What are they talking about?” Draco pointed at Potter who was discussing something with Hermione
“When did you get out of that tie? That was a perfect single column tie” Draco gaped at him, moaning loudly when Harry pulled his shirt down and latched down on his nipples, sucking and grazing his teeth lightly, just teasing him “
“Alright” Ron said and grimaced a bit when the dragon was put on his shoulder, the small dragon breathed out a small blue flame and Ron started to panic
“No, I don’t wanna be in one of those blind dates again, it sucks” He complained, not that he has a high standard or anything, it just didn’t feel right with any of them, and especially if Pansy had a hand in matchmaking him “I’m just not in the mood for love right now”
He slid the shirt off Potter gently so he wouldn’t cause any further pain. Draco’s mouth parted when he saw the bruising upper arm, it was all swelled up and discoloured “Do you feel any tingling feeling on your arm?”
For once, the room was crowded with people like the Yule Ball again, but this time, there was no gowns or fancy robes, just a bunch of students dancing and drinking together. Draco leaned on the wall, sipping on the blue drink that has now become his favourite, and watched the room. It’s been specially altered into a party room, like Pansy wanted. He could see some of the students still reading on the couch in the corner. And there it was, Harry standing next to Ron and Neville, talking about something next to the table full of food. Draco looked at him carefully, he was wearing a black shirt, with jeans and boots, his hair messy as always. Somehow he didn’t look like a student in robes anymore, if anything, he looked more mature. Harry’s hands, holding onto his beer tightly, the way he laughed so freely around his friends, Draco almost envied it.
let’s not forget that new Auror chick who just got transferred from America. Ron told me…what’s her name?”
Draco hummed and tilted his head to the side, inviting Harry to devour him as he latched onto the pulse point on Draco’s neck “
“I can’t believe you judged us then went and shagged in the lift” Blaise chuckled quietly, his arm wrapped around Ron’s shoulder, he wasn’t smoking anymore
And my forever? I hope” Potter said, handing the chocolate box for Draco to hold, he stood there, waiting patiently for Draco to answer
“You’ll be wearing only the robes and nothing inside, the trousers you’re wearing now is fine” He said, handing Neville the robes without looking at him, keeping his eyes on the ground
“Don’t make promises you can’t make, Potter” He leaned his head on Harry’s chest, hearing the Auror’s heartbeat, and he wasn’t sure why, but it made Draco calm
“Yeah, every night” Potter said, and it felt like he was smiling when he said it, maybe he loved doing this. For the time being, Draco was clueless about many things, about what this world was, about how he’d go back to his world. However, the only thing he knew for sure was that Potter really loved him here. With trains of thoughts going through his mind and the warmth of Potter’s body next to him, Draco fell quickly to sleep, things could be handled tomorrow.
“Why do you keep asking that? Okay, look here” Pansy pulled out a small picture from her robes and showed it to him “This is a picture Blaise took for Hermione and I yesterday, that’s you and Harry kissing in the background near the Black lake. See?” Draco held the picture shakily in his hands, this was unreal, this has to be a dream “What’s wrong with you? Did you lose your memory or some sort?”
at confessing to Potter, he took a shower and was drying his wet hair until Pansy called, he felt like a coward.
“Are you blushing?” Potter asked him along with a chuckle when Draco turned around so the Gryffindor could do it privately “It’s okay, we’re both guys”
“It’s Draco” Pansy repeated, sighing loudly “He came back this year, we…we have been hanging out secretly because he doesn’t want Harry to know he’s back,
“Then I’ll be sad” Harry pouted and Draco couldn’t help but laughed softly, leaning on Harry’s shoulder
“Draco, what’s the matter with you? He’s just not my type, that’s all” Theodore said, making Draco groaned frustratingly “Why are you getting so upset?”
“You two are weird” He said, Blaise was extremely protective of Ron so it was scary for all of them whenever Blaise was mad “Aren’t you scared he’s going to do something bad?”
“See? I told you not to get with him, he’s bad news” Draco sighed, ruffling Theodore’s brown hair as he looked at Neville, who was standing in the corner, talking with Luna and Padma “Maybe you should pick someone nice, kind, who’ll treasure you”
“Okay, so you go grab a mask, a pretty one” Pansy pointed at Ron and he nodded, it was the least he could do since he failed the only thing he was assigned to, which he still felt guilty for “I’ll call them, see if I can persuade them or not”
It was the Great Hall, they were back at Hogwarts again, it’s been so long since they came back here. But the thing that amazed him more was the fact that it looked incredibly familiar
“Yeah, and well, before I met you and we all became friends, they and I…we used to work together for like a year, I was in charge of the money and they were in charge of entertaining others…er, they used to be a stripper, they’re good at it, we used to get big money from rich, old men because they were so good at it, they even wanted to pay more to fuck them, but we never let it go that far”
“It’s really important to him” Pansy cooed softly close to his ear, her fingers twirling the hair on the back of his head “They work really hard, Ron didn’t get much sleep, this is a
“You’re cold” Potter pointed out but Draco shook his head, still too indulged in the pretty snow around him. Potter exhaled quietly before unwrapping his scarf, putting it around Draco’s neck, and he was pulling off his hat to put over the blond’s head as well.
“Me? What is wrong with you?” Harry snapped back at him “You-you just, grind yourself against that McLaggen jerk and-and you just—…”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Blaise replied without looking up, his eyes were glued on the parchment as he kept scribbling. Draco might never admit it out loud, but Blaise was definitely a smart one, he got an O in a lot of classes, and he was actually the one to help Pansy saving her grades, which was exactly why he wanted to find Blaise.
“Thank you” Draco chuckled and rested his hand on Harry’s chest, leaning on his shoulder and watched everyone enjoying the party
“Any time is drink time” Pansy clicked her tongue and winked at Draco “Come on, just go up there, settled down, and get back down here with us”
“Yeah” Ron nodded while trying to untie Harry with a flick of his wand “He wasn’t really going with plan A”
” Draco cupped Harry’s face to stop him from babbling, he couldn’t stop smiling “I want that, you hear me? I want all of that with you, from the small things to the big things, I want all the arguing and making up, I want everything, with you”
“Harry” He smiled and held Harry’s hand “I have something to tell you” Draco stood on his toes and kissed Harry’s cheek before speaking, he should tell Harry about it anyway, now that they were a couple, he couldn’t lie, right? It was bound to be revealed soon “Well, seven years ago…” He began, and he knew
“Just let him process it for a few minutes” Pansy dragged Hermione up on her feet and she ruffled Harry’s hair “We’re going to cook, come and talk when you’re ready” She said, leaving Harry there, sitting on the couch with a cup of tea and new information that the person he loved the most gave his virginity to a guy that wasn’t worth it.
“Yeah, I could” Potter said, and without waiting for Draco to answer, he started removing the legs and claws of the crab. Watching Potter cracking the crab for him, Draco felt his cheeks burning a bit, the way Potter was so focused on doing it for Draco, the way he flexed his arms a bit while doing it, the way he still looked good in that Hawaiian outfit, Draco feared he was feeling something…
?” The Auror gave him a half smirk and observed as Draco grabbed Harry’s cock and aligned himself just right above. Watching Draco going down on him was possibly the hottest thing he has seen all year. The light grimace on Draco’s face when the head of Harry’s cock was pushed in, the way his mouth formed into an ‘o’ shape, the way he looked at Harry with an alluring smile, he enjoyed teasing Harry.
“Do you think I’ll just let anyone hold my hand?” Draco grinned at him, amused by the way Harry was so oblivious about everything “I’m not that easy, Harry”
Draco held onto him tightly and cried out, arching his body, tightening his entrance and making Harry jerked his body as well, coming inside Draco and filling him up while Draco came everywhere.
“Oh, come on, even you would know that’s a lie” Pansy kicked his leg teasingly. Draco avoided her eyes and looked at the hallway of the other side instead. He knew it was a lie himself. It’s been five months since they have acted like this…like friends. It scared him, but he knew there was something in the way Potter looked at him. Especially after that night when Potter held his hand for hours, it made his stomach warm.
“Don’t worry about it” Potter smiled “Have a good day” He said and watched the sad guy walked away, Draco stared at Potter and then at the girls, they were looking at him again now
“Considering that it’s my first time, I don’t have any experience that I can compare this with” Draco said, playing with Harry’s hand “But…perhaps it is” He mumbled the last part quietly, and Harry snickered. After cleaning the both of them wandlessly, Harry conjured the blanket back on the bed, which managed to fall out some time during the sex and draped it over them.
“You can’t play it like that” Ron whined when Draco asked “If so, I should have changed when Romilda got wrestling with the bloody giant squid”
Draco said, and it wasn’t a lie, every time they celebrated their anniversary, Pansy would send them a special gift that
“You want it that bad?” Harry tilted his head up by his chin and kissed his shoulder, placing his lips on every faded scars on Draco’s salty chest, his cock thrusting in so slowly “You want me to fuck you hard?”
“Whe—when did you…why would you…” Draco stuttered, trying to form a full sentence, but Harry figured he was in too much of a shock “What…”
“Aren’t you gonna join anyone?” Pansy spoke next to him, startling the blond. He cleared his throat and shrugged
“Can you bring Theo up to his dorm for me?” Draco said, rubbing his back “He, well, his boyfriend broke up with him, he’s all heartbroken and pissed, I want to bring him up myself but I’ve got Pansy too, she’s chugging up all kind of cocktails here” Draco said, tilting his head so Neville could look at her, who was already tipsy “You can just throw him on any bed in the dorm, don’t worry”
“Oh-…oh yeah, it hurts a lot too” Ron said. He did get a few hexes today, but none of it could make him forget the feeling of Blaise against him right now, he couldn’t think straight. But did he ever think straight? Ron continued “But it’s alright” He was about to say more but then a skinny young guy passed by their booth and looked at Blaise
“How can I? Harry’s your boyfriend, you don’t remember that? Are you seeing things you’re not supposed to see?” Pansy pulled him down by his shirt and placed her hand on his forehead “You don’t seem to experience fever right now”
“Honey, you’re drooling” Theo touched the corner of his lips with a disgusted frown and wiped it on Draco’s shirt
“We will” Draco said in unison with Potter and they walked behind the girls quietly on the way back to the resort
“I-…” Potter stood up and looked at the table full of Aurors looking at him “I was just telling Ron that, er, that you look incredibly beautiful today with that new robes on and it looks good on you, and Ron said, you said…” Potter looked at Weasley and the redhead muttered softly
“Have a wild guess” Draco bit his lower lips and slowly got down on his knees, watching Harry’s eyes widened as each second passed by. He started at Harry’s ankles, and trailed his hands up the man’s thighs as he faced the unbelievably huge and hard cock in front of him. Draco took a deep breath and kept his hands on Harry’s thighs as he leaned closer, licking a stripe up the length
“Hey, did you enjoy the game?” Draco asked, elbowing Theodore, who was sulking in the corner of the room
“Save that for the vows” Draco said, and he was certain Draco meant it as a joke, but a part of Harry wanted it to happen, though he wouldn’t tell the blond that. Harry groaned when Draco bit on his shoulder and mumbled in his ear “
“I get that your pride is huge, you don’t want to confess and be rejected, it would destroy you” Pansy explained exactly what he felt, she knew him a little too well “But if you don’t, you will never know what he feels. Oh, do you want me to ask him?”
“I’d do anything for you because you deserve some love, honey” Pansy grabbed his hand and held it tightly “It’s kinda sad to see you’re the only one left in our group”
“Yes” Harry couldn’t help it but giving Draco the biggest grin before spinning the blond around and pinned him on the bed
“He might be cute for you” Draco said, adding his opinion in so Theodore might be curious about Neville, he was hoping it would work. And it did, based on the way Theodore hummed, a small smile forming on his lips.
“Y-yeah, I forgot” Potter stuttered and quickly jumped in with him. Soon Potter was in front of him, wet hair, bright eyes, charming smile, Draco blamed the water for making him feel this much
“Can’t promise you that” Pansy laughed and disappeared into the crowd with the rest of their friends. Draco pushed Harry into the spot in the middle of the booth, so if they intended to do anything…
Draco never knew he could actually miss Harry’s sweet voice, his touches, and especially his cuddles. It was hard for him to sleep ever since he got back, curse Harry and his warm hugs. Draco sighed, looking at Harry from far away, he missed him. He wished they were boyfriends now, but that was such a crazy thought to have right now. He shook his head and looked the other way, getting back to his plan.
” Harry breathed out when Draco hollowed his cheeks, his hand stroking the base “He, he just went to the restroom”
“Hey” Draco jolted and saw Ron standing there, with a curious look on his face “Aren’t you blinded by the sun?”
” Harry called out after him, but Draco didn’t listen. He didn’t know why he was running too, but he just has to. He hated confrontation, especially now that Harry knew he kissed Draco and didn’t remember. He sprinted to quickly to the Apparition point and stopped then
I got the chance to see you, everyone was…crowding me today so I didn’t get to give you this, but now I have, and I was about to do it, but…you did it anyway” Potter snorted “Ron said he’d lock you and I in a room if I delay this any longer”
Theodore said while hiccuping, he might have had too much to drink, Draco should have found him sooner, or maybe this was a sign “
Alright, alright” Harry groaned, standing up and turned around to glare at the sly married couple who were smirking at him now while holding hands “I know what you’re doing. Just know that I’m
” He pointed at the girls. Pansy was wearing her red pantsuit again, with a gold pendant on her neck that he hasn’t seen her wearing for months now
, married couple, we can’t lie to each other” Pansy put her arms up in defeat “What’s the harm anyway? She won’t tell”
Things got different now, because Draco realised he has feelings for Harry, or Potter, or Harry Potter in general. They were the same, he had realised from watching Potter. The way he acted around his friends, his honest laughters, his gentle smiles, his deep voice, it was definitely the same. He did that with everyone, not Draco, of course, and that was what made him sadder than he was now. Just the fact that he liked Potter but wasn’t sure what to do about it. Suddenly becoming such a coward, he hated himself for this. If only he knew what to do.
“I think I’m falling in love with you” Harry whispered in his ear, nuzzling his nose under Draco’s ear
is waiting!” Granger tugged on Weasley’s robes and pulled him away “We’ll go first, see you in the Common Room”
“Alright, just, ask and spray?” He asked again, just to make sure. It was his first day at his first job ever anyway, he didn’t know where to work, but then Pansy introduced him to the fragrance stands that she also works in the mall, but at a different section. And then she helped him get in, now he was here, wearing a suit because Pansy told him to, and prepared to nail his job
them to make you Weasley’s tutor? Do I care about you or him that much?” He asked, arching an eyebrow, Blaise looked at him intently for a few seconds before he nodded. Draco breathed out in relief, because that was exactly what he did “Blaise, I know you think he’s loud, and has some anger issues and he’s so bad at classes, but you’re good at handling it, right? Pansy’s also loud, she has mood swings all the time, and she’s even worse at studying” He said firmly, searching for some change in expression from Blaise’s face. Blaise has never been the one to feel anything for anyone, Ron has always been the one to feel and express way too much, they’d have a good potential to be together.
“Yeah?” Draco answered, of course he would remember it. It was one of his favourite memories, not the injury obviously but rather the person “What about it?”
“So I heard the girl Weasley dumped your sorry arse, Potter?” Draco walked by, not forgetting to throw in some insults when he saw Potter “It’s about time she realised she could do better than you”
” Draco flinched at the screaming person behind him, he spun around to see a tall man covering his eyes while crouching down “
“No, just…looking forward to this” Draco said, tilting his head to the side and looking down at Harry “What are you thinking about?”
“See you tonight” Draco pressed his lips into a smile, preventing himself from being too excited. When Harry finally disappeared, Draco jumped around on the spot and squealed quietly.
“What is it?” Without replying, Harry stood up from his chair and slowly crouching down on one knee, he could see Draco’s eyes starting to widen, his mouth falling slightly open and his fork fell on the table. Harry pulled out a small red box from his pocket and opened it, he heard gasps and small applause around him in the restaurant “Draco Lucius Malfoy…Will you marry me?”
“The threat” Pansy said “Hermione didn’t get any threat, it was just a plan to get you two to come with me and Hermione on our trip, because none of you made a move and we are all frustrated and all of us supported this idea and we all went for it, and honestly Robards wasn’t in it but I was actually glad he chose you two, Ron claimed he would but I wasn’t sure but then he
” He commented, looking down at the ground and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck as the firefighter started walking inside his apartment. Harry’s place was a bit smaller than Draco’s, but cosier…and messier. Draco has to admit, he felt kind of sad when Harry put him down on the red couch, but the feelings were soon gone when Harry took off his uniform
be” Theo said “Look at how you’re ogling at him, it’s like a kid watching sweets from outside of a shop, or me standing outside of a boutique” He chuckled and nudged Draco “Come on, where’s your dignity?”
“Er, normal as always” Harry replied plainly, playing with the rim of his glass. During dinner, he got the seat opposite to Draco and Brandon, so he had to witness all their actions, which he wasn’t annoyed with, he just didn’t want to see it “Nothing much” Now they were sitting at the bar in the restaurant, and he has been trying to stop himself from drinking too much
“It’s okay, we get it” Ron snickered, turning away and carrying Ariel up in his arms to run down to the beach. Harry and Draco exchanged knowing glances at each other with a smile before looking down when Lily tugged at their swimming trunks
“Hi, I’m Lilian” She smiled at him, he kinda felt like he was giving her hopes if he didn’t tell her he was gay. He waited until the waiter placed their drinks down before speaking
” Draco asked, leaning his forehead on Harry’s and showed him a satisfied smile once the Auror finally pulled out “Am I as good as the actors in those videos you were watching?”
“Why are we even leaving?” Lucius asked but Narcissa only smiled at him when they were back at the Manor “Narcissa, Cissy, tell me”
“That’s how he got me” Ron snickered, putting his chef hat back on his head “Let’s head out” Harry nodded and they walked out of the kitchen, the Auror took a deep breath when he saw Draco again, sitting on a table next to his boyfriend, with the girls sitting around them. He didn’t stop walking, he could face Draco, it could not be
Draco gasped, clutching on the balcony as Harry started lubing him up while squeezing his arse, luckily he was always prepared for sex, but Draco has no idea where Harry found the lube. The firefighter’s tongue began running around his rim, teasing him mercilessly until Draco whined “
Draco whispered quietly and looked into the bag but balled his hands into fists when he remembered that Ginny came by today at his workplace to borrow his keys, so she could drop by and borrow his cappuccino machine. The worst part was, he told her she didn’t need to bring his keys back since he has a spare one underneath the plant in front of his house, which was another stupid mistake he made because that was
“That’s because that mirror right there, it’s the Mirror of Eramthgin, that’s what my parents call it, now the young ones call it the Mirror of Nightmare” He said, explaining to Draco the difference.
” Draco said and gave up, Potter was obviously sitting under the sun for too long, he might have had a heatstroke and went mad. The blond lied back on his lounge chair and finally rested his eyes
“I’ve got all night” He mumbled and grabbed Draco’s legs while standing up, making the blond clutch onto him tightly and let out a small squealing sound as he walked away
Pansy said, her eyes opened wide, he knew what that meant now, it meant that they were doing everything else except studying “And don’t bother asking about Theodore, he’s at the greenhouse with Neville. Look, he isn’t going to kill you, he just wants to talk. You owe him an explanation, that’s the least you could do” She tilted her head to the side and sat down next to Hermione, leaning her back on the chair behind her “Whenever you’re ready, just come in” Draco stood outside of the Common Room and balled his hands into fists. He could just go back to his dorm, it wasn’t like he has nowhere to go, but what Pansy said really hit him, he did owe Potter an explanation. The blond sighed softly and stepped inside, settling himself on the long red couch, none of the students were here, just some of them passing by every few minutes. It wasn’t like the world he knew, where everyone was just at their House, no one crossing over to the other. When he was here, he realised everyone was friends with everyone, it was peaceful, and it was much better than his world.
“No, actually, it might be good” Ron said, considering how Harry was still not over Draco for the past years, maybe having a stripper in Slytherin robes giving him a lap dance would help “So how do you two know each other?”
“No, come on” Draco stood up and put a hand on Harry’s broad chest “It’s for everyone else, now go, I’ll call the girls to keep me busy”
to each other in front of each other at our wedding” Harry poured his heart out to Draco, hoping to hear a word from him, but the blond was still frozen on his spot “So, er, Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you…be my husband one day? Are—are you crying?”
” Draco turned around and glanced at Harry, who somehow still looked stunned “Good game there, you play really well”
“Hi, Mione” Draco said and looked around, there were clothes, shoes and pillows lying across the room, Hermione was only covered by her blanket and was drinking her champagne “Er…Am I interrupting something?”
“I should hope not” Ron said and Harry felt him being put down on the ground “You know what, you guys go first by the Floo, I’ll Apparate with Harry once we got outside of the Ministry”
“We should get back, there’s a long way back” Hermione suggested and looked at the Muggle watch on her wrist “And we need to be in time for dinner, chop chop, everyone”
“Probably not if you were in your world, but here, you’re Harry’s boyfriend” She said, poking his chest, her hard nail digging into his skin even through his robes “It’s your choice” He pressed his lips together, raising his hand up and waving. Soon enough, Potter spotted him and stood up, leaving the crow in a rush
” His heels were digging into Harry’s back, his mouth blabbering words nonstop, urging him to thrust faster, and Harry wasn’t going to disobey. Harry lifted Draco whole body up and placed a pillow under his back, shoving roughly when Draco cried out that it was
“No one cares” Ron shrugged, organising the chess pieces with magic “You already apologised to everyone anyway”
“You are who I desire too” Draco cupped his face, feeling their distance narrowed “I like you so much too, I want to love you, Harry, I want to love you badly”
Draco looked at Harry and pointed at their friends, who were looking at them, that was supposed to mean that
“Yes, five, Potter, stop whining” Draco said “Well performed opera is a feast for the eyes and ears, an escape into another world, it’s special, Potter”
“You got my back?” He asked, he couldn’t believe Weasley could actually say that he’d kick his best friend’s arse for him
Everything was upside down in this world, everyone was happy, they were in love, it was like a world where they all got what they desired. And that could also mean that the version of Draco here was also brought into
“Yeah, I did” He said, sighing and standing up, when he walked to Harry’s spot, the Gryffindor was opening his legs so Draco could sit between. When the blond sat down, his back was pressed against Harry’s bodies, he folded his legs as Harry put his hands on his own thighs. He could even feel his breath ghosting at the nape of his neck, Draco has goosebumps under his robes and tried to focus on the game.
“Oh, she…got an emergency” Harry lied, he wouldn’t want to cause the situation to be more awkward than it already was “Have you guys ordered?”
“Yeah, I, I didn’t notice that before” Draco suddenly realised the words were different, this was a different mirror “I could never figure out what it meant”
“Shiny” He repeated “You have got to be kidding me” There was no way he’s going to put lotion on Harry and other eleven male’s bodies
“Han, hey” Pansy called and Hannah walked to their spot, tying her hair brown hair up in a ponytail and leaned over the bar on her elbows “Tell me, do you think Draco likes Harry?”
“Well, he buys me stuff, like sweets, when we study” Ron said, looking everywhere except Draco’s eyes “He bought me a quill, he said because he gets annoyed every time I lost my quill. And Ginny said it’s a very expensive quill”
“Nothing, just…I realized how much I like you” His lips couldn’t stop forming into a smile when he thought about it, so turned out, he has always liked Harry, and even when his mind tricked himself into thinking he didn’t, his heart wouldn’t obey. And just like Pansy, Ron, Hannah, and everyone else have said, he
“I’m just tired, that’s all” He rubbed his eyes and they kept walking in the hall, that was it, the plan was over
tell Draco he has been in love with him for years “If you’re leaving again, and I can’t see you. I want to say that, er, I, I think I have feelings for you”
“Please stop talking” He muttered and grabbed the lotion bottle from the table, he squeezed some from his hand before applying it on Smith’s body. For whatever reason, Theo let Smith’s pose half naked with only the wand holster on his arm, he was assigned with a wolf, and for March, Draco didn’t want to know
“It doesn’t work” Draco snapped a little bit harder than usual, he was angry, he wasn’t sure why. Potter’s words meant nothing to him.
“I think I heard him saying he wants to shag Draco just half an hour ago” Hermione said, unfortunately it wasn’t a lie, Cormac did say that “So he will have no problem kissing Draco at midnight”
that guy in our history book, right?” She pointed out but he could only open his mouth in shock “He was born under the effect of love potion, when his father found out and tried to take him away, the mother killed them both with a curse and killed herself after. A tragic story, honestly”
“I’m glad you like him that much” Draco smiled at the brunet, after an hour of talking with Pansy, she had left him for her wife and Theo came to rescue him from this crowd “I’m also glad he asked, I didn’t see it coming”
“I don’t know, I don’t know if he likes me too” Theodore pursed his lips, stealing back his drink and chugging it down “Seems to me, he’s into Abbott more”
“Perfect, I’ll send you two the Portkeys tonight” Pansy smiled at Draco and Potter, who was sitting across the table to him “Good day, everyone, Robards” Pansy put the ransom note on the table and sashayed out of the office
, and it wasn’t good. He quickly sipped on his wine and looked at the beach, he must forget about this.
“Well, we are not sure” Hermione said and sighed, she pulled Pansy’s hand close and intertwined it with hers “Draco, feelings can’t be measured by time, if you ask me, I
Pansy squawked, her hands raising in the air, Draco was so certain he had caught her, but the plan has only just begun “
“No, no, you were right anyway, we broke up already so you can lash out at him, I don’t care” Draco shrugged lightly and started eating his meal
, twenty two years ago, you agreed to be my boyfriend” Draco smiled at the truth, it took Harry a while for Draco to accept his offer “Twelve years ago on this day, you agreed to be my husband. If people ask me what love is, I will say it’s you”
way” Pansy said, pointing at the other side of the mall “See Hermione there? From across the mall? She came to pick me up for our date and I sent her the picture when you asked me and she just told me the guy is her friend, Harry, then she saw you and
“It was the night I accidentally proposed to him four years ago, this happened after that, we joked around, he called me an idiot, I teased him back, he blushed for five minutes straight” Harry smiled, shoving his ring back under his shirt “It’s the moment I felt something towards him, or realised I felt something towards him, then I told you guys and Pansy smacked me for
“We’re leaving” Theo said, dragging Roger away. He sighed and looked at Ron, the redhead was helping Blaise putting his equipment away
“And…Harry asked me first” Draco’s lips couldn’t help but form into a small smile “He asked me why I couldn’t sleep, I stared at him for so long before answering, I said ‘
“Yeah, Harry wouldn’t do such an inappropriate behaviour” Hermione sided with Pansy and sighed “I mean, look at him today”
“Lie down, Auror” Draco pushed Harry back down on the bed and kept himself up on his knees, just hovering above Harry’s length while untying his shirt, letting it open “I’m on top this time”
?” Draco spoke and Harry stared at him. Did he say something? “Did you just…did you just tell me you love me?
“Alright” Harry froze there when Draco nodded and immediately plopped down on his lap, his hands locked around the Auror’s neck
“Oh, well, close your eyes” Potter said as Draco narrowed his eyes. What was he planning on? “I promise won’t do anything inappropriate without your consent”
“I like…” He stuttered “I like looking at the sky like this, it’s just like…our last year in Hogwarts right?” He looked down and mentally punched himself, he was being a coward again
alright” Ginny bid them goodbye and quickly ran off to see her wife, leaving Pansy and Hermione with Draco, who was quite tipsy from all the drinks Theo has been giving him
He cursed teasingly and heard Harry let out a small chuckle, Draco grabbed on Harry’s hair, tugging it back and deepening their kiss, tasting the cocktail on the tip of Harry’s tongue
” Draco stopped when someone was clutching on his robes, he turned around and saw Ernie Macmillan behind him with a light pink colour painted on his cheeks “Can I talk to you for a second?”
“Whatever you say, Draco, all I know is you’ve been asking why the girl Weasley broke up with Potter since this morning. That’s why Blaise’s sitting far away, he doesn’t want to hear you rambling about Potter anymore” She said, pursing her red lips and flipping the pages in the book like she was actually studying “Maybe she’s interested in someone else, maybe Potter’s interested in someone else, you don’t know. The point is, it’s none of your business, Draco. Why do you even bother?”
“It’s okay” The guy’s voice was low, and reassuring “Come on” He spun around and let Draco held on his strong arm. Suddenly he pulled something out from his pocket inside his leather jacket “Ron, he’s here”
“Here, try some” Draco held up a spoonful of soufflé and opened his mouth, signalling Harry to eat it. The Auror complied in reflex, he could never say no to Draco “So? Spectacular, right? I can eat ten of this”
“Sorry, it was just too boring” Potter stood up, stretching himself and yawned the second time “How long was I asleep?”
“It’s fine by the way” Hermione comforted them and they led Hugh away, leaving Harry grinning and Draco blushing red, he figured the might have known why they got out early. Neville and Theo quickly ran to the water along with Ginny and Luna and their kids, Blaise sat on the chair nearby to tie Ariel’s hair up while Ron came to them
“You know he can’t cook to save his life, Hermione” Theo said, nudging her elbow as she nodded. It wasn’t wrong, he always found a way to buy food, or when he was…dating Harry, he would be the chef and Draco would just be the one to enjoy the food. Ever since they parted ways, Draco was back to eating random food again, since he never cooked nor know how to “Maybe I should tell Luna to make some extra food and bring it to you”
“Oh, well, er, unless you want more, then I’m completely okay with it. But unless you want to take it slow, then I’m also okay, you’re just worth the wait”
” She said softly, hooking her arm around Ron’s and leaned her head on his shoulder “I’ll just have to set up a meeting and make them talk to each other again. One way or another, they’re going to be together anyway, with or without my help”
? It wasn’t his fault that he wanted to know what Potter was up to. He just has to know so he could get on Potter’s nerves. Was he too much? “You probably know him better than the Weasley girl”
“We’ve chosen a theme for you” Hermione said and pulled out from her bag a small box “You’ll be posing with animals. In this box there are a variety of animals that I have written down, and you will randomly pick one to take the photoshoot with. Understood?”
” Both Harry and Draco said. Once the waitress had left the table, Harry showed a sly smile as Draco did the same
“I’m sorry” He said, extending his arm to hold Theo’s hand, and Theo let him “I’m sorry, I don’t know how many times I should say it, I’m an idiot and I was wrong. I let other people affect my decision, fuck, I’m so stupid”
“Just a normal kiss is alright” Draco said, his eyes finally focused on Potter’s outfit, he was wearing a sweater with the letter H in the middle, he suspected Weasley’s mom had made it for Potter, then he was wearing a pair of black ripped jeans with the normal shoes he always wear everywhere, Potter didn’t like to wear anything fancy, Draco remembered that.
is why” He opened his shirt, showing the scars on his chest, there were a lot of it, and it hasn’t even faded yet. Harry stared at his body, his mouth slightly opened, he was probably reminiscing that memory in the bathroom again “I wanted to at first, but I guess we’re even now,
“Same difference” Pansy shrugged at Hermione’s words and earned a chuckle from her wife “And don’t get me started on Nev and Theo, traitors”
“Am I?” He looked at her, the corner of his lips turned up as he nudged her arm “Think about it” Pansy was going out with this girl for a week, then suddenly she just broke it off with her. When Draco saw that girl, she has the appearance somewhat like Hermione, and Pansy never told him the reason she didn’t keep dating that girl, so he figured she might have started having feelings for Hermione, but she hasn’t figured it out herself.
“I don’t regret cutting my hair, to be honest” Hermione touched her short hair and smiled to herself “I actually like it, it’s breezy”
“Can I…can I hug you?” Potter said without looking at him “It’s hard for me to sleep if I don’t hug you, but it’s fine, if you don’t want to”
“So, one minute until midnight” Potter spoke first after they spent a minute just staring at each other, his hands shoved in the pockets of his jeans, his way too green eyes staring into Draco’s soul, he wasn’t sure what to say. Were they really going to kiss? “
Draco rubbed his hands together, blowing warm breaths into his palms to feel less cold. It was the coldest night of this month, everyone had said so. He could have just stayed in his dorm, but it wasn’t that different from here. Blaise was teaching Pansy in the library for an upcoming exam, one Draco had already studied so he was safe, while Theo was occupied by a guy like always. Draco found out the hospital wing might be a safe place for him to stay.
“Of course I have” Draco scoffed when Potter asked an obvious question, the spell didn’t work, that was the main problem. He rubbed his own hands together again and intertwined them, noticing Potter looking at him from the corner of his eyes “How are your hands so warm?”
think?” Draco chortled, letting his shirt fell on the carpet and reached for his trousers, Harry found it harder to breath, his hands were glued on the bed, he didn’t dare touch Draco without  permission first
“Come on” Draco smiled and quickly followed the girls. They walked to the water’s edge on the beach and watched Hermione and Pansy a few steps in front of them, it was peaceful and quiet this way, the water hitting Draco’s feet softly, the sand in his feet, Potter by his side.
Draco whined, his head resting on his arm, luckily the rug on the stairs were preventing him from pain, but not totally, his elbows and knees would still gonna be sore by tomorrow if Harry actually insisted on doing it here
Draco watched the steam spiralling in the air from his cauldron, the last potion, Amortentia, he had made this back in Sixth Year. At that moment, he smelled broomstick handle, chocolate, and another smell he could not figure out what it was. He didn’t care much for it back then and just thought it was about himself. But now, as he leaned closer to the cauldron, he could still smell the broomstick handle, chocolates, and another scent he’s been smelling. It was an earthy smell, the only kind that one could get after hours at the Quidditch’s field, Draco had smelled it every night when he slept next to Harry, back when he was brought to the other world. The blond breathed out and stood up straight, he was done with his potions as there was still five minutes left.
“Would you mind?” Draco mumbled, and Potter immediately cleared his throat and wiped invisible dust off his thighs as the Weasley girl kept talking about how hard the Hufflepuff girls were partying there
day, Draco would go on this date tonight, and all Harry did was buying ice creams, the ones that Draco likes.
his cock convulsed and his body jerked, spilling all of him inside Draco. He still kept stroking lazily inside the blond, unwilling to break apart.
“What?” Draco asked when he heard Potter mumbled the words quietly, the Auror was startled and looked at Draco with wide eyes before stammering like a kid learning how to speak
Hermione beamed at him along with Neville and Theo, who all squeezed him in a tight hug “Oh no, you’re skin and bones. Look at you, haven’t you been eating enough?”
“Did you hear that?” Ron pushed Blaise’s hand away from his now soft cock and signalled him to shut up or they’d be caught
“Yeah, it’s your thing, I never really get it, you say it’s the closeness you two share, the whispers, the laughters you two have together back then were what made you like him” Draco looked down on his shoes while listening to Pansy talk, he didn’t know how much the Draco in this world meant to Potter, it seemed like they both shared a great bond with each other. And maybe, just maybe, he could have had that with Potter in his world too, if only he hadn’t messed up his first meeting with him. But that was all in the past “
“See you at home” He said and hanged up the phone, he put it back in his bag and stilled himself a bit when he felt something, or rather,
“Sod off, Malfoy!” Potter glared at him and walked away along with Weasley and Granger. Draco smiled in victory that this time he won, another win for him
“Library, he’s studying again, or reading, who knows? He’s in his little bubble that no one can get in” She huffed as they kept walking “He’s probably trying to get the best grades and get out of here”
“I insist, it’s safer, and your friends would take some time to come here, I don’t want you to wait, it’s already midnight”
Pansy stopped them both and scratched her head, looking at Ron for help “He’s sick, and it’s infectious, so that’s why we’re here, to take care of him, don’t come in, it’s really gross”
” He whined softly when his nipples were attacked by Blaise, he didn’t even know that place in a man could be
“I just have one thing to say” Draco said quietly, leaning down to talk to Theodore “Whatever you do, don’t hurt him, he’s a nice guy”
“I’m gay” He blurted out “I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable, and it’s the decent thing to do” He turned around when there was complete silence behind him. Potter was done, but he was staring at Draco “What? I’m not embarrassed about my sexuality”
“It’s been 7 years, Potter, move on” Draco said softly, he had also moved on since then, that was the most embarrassing moment of his life, he was kind of glad Potter didn’t remember anything. Although Pansy said he was a coward for not confessing again, he could accept that name, as long as Potter didn’t know about that night
Draco struggled to get out of Harry’s grip, but it was too tight. The Auror pulled him in the restroom and finally let him go
“I was going to say I’m surprised you’re bossy in bed” Harry grinned, crawling up and resting his arms on either side of Draco’s head “But honestly, I’m not”
He murmured when Potter broke off the kiss and trailed down to kiss his neck instead. Everything was blurry and all he could feel was Potter sucking on his pulse point, making marks on his neck, kissing his collarbone and his hands teasing Draco’s hard bud under his shirt “
As Pansy left for the meeting, Draco found himself walking to his usual place every day, he has created this habit of coming here every time he got a break, or when he needed to think. Pansy was telling him all sorts of things about Potter today and he needed to clear his mind. When the door finally appeared, Draco opened it to walk in. There was a big mirror inside, this wasn’t what he asked. Draco stared at the empty Room of Requirement and hesitated to walk in, normally when he got here, he only asked for a place to think, so it was always empty, but today, there was a mirror in it.
“Well, I guess we’ll go now” Hermione smiled and stood up, dragging Pansy with her. And then, there was only the two of them…
“You cried when Pansy scolded you, Ron” Potter replied, shutting Ron up, Draco smirked a bit from his spot and hid his smile with his hand, he did
