“I think you should go now. Ron is looking a bit anxious and Rose should be missing you” he hurried the witch towards her husband “I’ll let you know if it really works”
“What year?” this time he looked at him as if he was crazy.
“Harry, thank you for coming back so soon” she greeted as soon as she saw him.
“Right on time” he murmured turning to face Draco who was leaning on the counter, therefore, looked smaller than him.
“But you are hiding something and expecting me to notice. Well, surprise, I have no idea what it is. I’m a Gryffindor, remember?” he took a bite of his sausage.
“I see he has the brains and you have got the luck, Harry” Rasputin said “First, Death protects you and then you managed to make the spells collide. Impressive” he tried a couple more times but Harry managed to avoid it, or deflect it away from Draco and himself.
The bed sheets were barely wrinkled, as if the man hadn’t moved in his sleep, but judging by the tiredness in the wizard’s eyes, he had probably not slept at all; the desk was overflowed with books and discarded papers, and a box of cigarettes laid empty in the window frame.
Draco opened his eyes just to shut them again immediately. The room he was in was too bright, a conspicuous difference from that godforsaken chamber where he remembered being before everything went black.
“In our room. You passed out when we were in the church and I brought you back to the school. You’ve been sleeping for almost thirteen hours” Harry explained while turning a lamp on. He had covered it with a sheet or something so the light wasn’t so strong and Draco thanked him silently for that.
“Well, about the trip. I can get you in touch with a couple agents in the RUMMA. They could receive you and guide you at the beginning. Is not like either of you have any idea where Koldovstoretz is located” she finished her tea and moved towards her purse to look for something.
“Harry?” Draco called softly, half asleep.
“Mom!”
“Mr. Loughty, I presume these are the British guests” her accent was really strong, but Harry appreciated that she spoke their language.
Harry watched the ring-lines permanently attached to his right hand and then looked at the golden key on his palm.
He looked towards the bedside table. Harry had left his wand there. Why? He had no idea; but Draco would probably kill him when he returned for being a stupid, irresponsible, little Gryffindor. Going around that place without protection was just foolish.
He ran to her with all he had.
He had done the single thing he knew never failed: he had followed his instincts. Hermione thought he was too reckless but he was alive thanks to that, so he had grabbed Draco and kissed him as if his life depended on it. Luckily for him, Draco liked him back.
“Yeah, I think I remember that. And I guess it explains the bandages” Harry nodded, his look fixed on him; Draco noticed the dark circles under the emerald eyes “Why were you on my bed?” not that he was complaining, he didn’t remember the last time he had woke up to a hot body against his, but he could imagine more pleasant circumstances.
Yes. He had been wrong.
The room emptied in seconds. Except for four people…well, three and a half.
He woke up before Harry and took a minute to watch the man. His glasses were next to his pillow; on top of the last book he had been reading. His breathing was steady, but not especially deep and his clothes were a complete mess. The little black stone he had seen hanging from his necklace the other day was now next to his cheek, still attached to the thin cord, and his wand was inches away from his hand. When Draco focused in his face one more time, emerald eyes where starring back at him and they stayed like that for a couple minutes before Harry broke the silence.
“I’m afraid so, I’m sorry” what was he supposed to say in a situation like that? He was trained to tell people their loved ones had passed away, not the person itself.
And hell had come next.
Draco was having trouble keeping the air inside of him, but he didn’t care. Breathing was overrated. He melted into that kiss, holding himself onto Harry’s shoulders like his life depended on it.
at the same time. The bookshelves were curvy, instead of the classic quadrangular ones, and were surrounding a small reading space in the middle of the room, with a rectangular table, a rigid-looking chair and a couple of much more comfortable armchairs. It was as big as the Manor’s, but definitely more majestic and imposing. Why had his mother never talk to him about it?
“Are you ready?” Harry asked and Draco nodded, regretting it seconds later, when Harry took his fingers out and he felt empty. Luckily, it didn’t last long and the emptiness was substituted by a delicious burning as his entrance tried to accommodate to Harry’s size. He was thicker than Draco had calculated and it was driving him crazy. He could barely focus his gaze on anything else than Harry’s eyes, green covered by the blown pupils. He was looking at him, intensely, his lip trapped between his teeth in an attempt to control himself from thrusting the whole way inside the blond.
“How old are you?” it was a silly question, he knew, but it was a start.
“I’m so screwed” he whispered to himself and moved a hand through his locks. A couple minutes later, Harry stepped out of the bathroom with his forever messy hair dripping water and looking refreshed, with a new pair of trousers and no shirt. This had to be some kind of torture. Draco was convinced he had done something terribly wrong in his life, something that deserved being punished by the sight of a sexy Harry Potter early in the morning.
They passed a couple more rooms before finding the library, one of them was probably Harry’s chamber, another one had a sign with Regulus name on it, and the other was heavily warded, with every possible muggle and magical lock. He was going to ask, but decided against it. He would question his house distribution another time.
“This is a nightmare, isn’t it?” he finally spoke looking at his mother and then back to the man who stood beside his bed “I’m still asleep and Potter is not really here” he told himself closing his eyes and then rubbing them with the side of his hands.
“Is something wrong?” Harry asked. Obviously concerned. Draco considered for a minute lying to him. He knew he would totally ruin the moment if he spoked the truth, but he had the feeling Harry would know if he lied and worry even more, if possible.
“Yes, but I didn’t get it, it was in Russian” he scratched his head embarrassed, and Draco stop the thought of him looking adorable. Not the time “I tried to touch you, I thought at first you were just confused for the medications, but it pushed me back and kept talking. The only thing I got to understand before you passed out again was a name. I think whoever possessed you was trying to let me know who he was, and if I have to guess, he didn’t do it on purpose”
“Hey there” he greeted the young tabby cat that was wrapping his tail around Harry’s leg and purring while he caressed his orange fur. Draco was quiet beside him and Harry looked up to him “Are you okay?”
It felt like seconds, but a couple minutes had gone by when he woke up to Draco’s movement. The blond was shaking again, his eyes white and his skin was so hot he could feel the heat without touching him.
The gap on the wall seemed terribly distant. He was not going to make it there. He was tired, his body ached and his limbs were cold, always cold.
He felt the room fade and he could hear Harry’s voice, so they were probably not kissing anymore.
“Believe me, babe, you look nothing like your father”
A massive crow was settled on the chair’s back, looking at them. He was probably average sized, but to Harry, that had never seen one up close, it was huge. The bird had a black, big beak that was holding a string, with a parchment attached.
” he answered. Good to know, although it was a horrible name for an incantation.
“It’s possible. He took it too good when we first told him, considering. At his age, with what he saw before dying and what he had learned since he got inside you…I’m surprised his sanity lasted as much as it did” Harry explained, and Draco couldn’t hold back the comment.
“Yes, Master Potter” he bowed and then disappeared in an instant.
“Sure, I’ll help you to the bathroom, but I think you’ll be fine” he stood with Potter’s aid and let the dark-haired, pine-smelling, hot-skinned wizard do the walking for him “Let me know if you need me, I’ll wait outside” he stated and closed the door. Draco looked at his reflection and contained a gasp, he did look bad, his mother wasn’t joking. his eyes were swollen, and his skin, normally pale, was drained of all color and worst of all, his hair was a mess. Oh Salazar, and Potter hadn’t told him anything.
“Have you tried…looking for him? I don’t know if it makes sense”
They entered the office and some of the aurors greeted Harry joyfully. He knew most of them from school or the order. Everybody ignored Draco.
“Mr. Malfoy here sent me a letter yesterday morning. He apparently found out that I was pregnant and had the detail to send his good wishes”
“Why would he do such thing?” she looked so…made to the idea; and he was about to lose his nerves.
“Not here, Draco” had he made Regulus angry? He didn’t usually talk to him like that. He closed the door and was about to go down stair to his mother…
“Are you saying I have suddenly acquired a muggle, genetic, deadly condition?”
“Yes, Ms. Volkova” she pointed a couple chairs and they seated. Ellias left and they introduced themselves.
“Pure blood’s bunkum. The point is, I forgot almost everything, but the Romanov name is somewhere there, I’m sure. So maybe we could focus on that first” he finished.
He casted a spell he had learn on his trips, a spell to track dittany. He had learnt to use it in order to find ingredients and to differentiate a real medicine from a placebo when he had a test or to spot the altered ingredients when he bought on informal markets, so to speak.  Harry used dittany in most of his potions, including Draco’s.
“I’m sure you are taking excellent care of him, Harry. I will go see Lucius today, so I’ll leave Draco to you. If you need me send Bibly, she would know where to find me”
“Are you really interested in them? It’s strange enough you didn’t call him Weasel”
“I’m sorry about that. It’s probably my fault”
“That’s not everything. I have the feeling that he…I, whatever, was in here, in Koldovstoretz. It felt too familiar”
He opened his eyes, but it took a moment for them to adjust to the light that came from the window. When he managed to focus, he gasped.
“Merlin, this sounds so unrealistic” Draco complained and brushed back his hair with his hand.
He had to go downstairs, that’s where the library was. Down, deep down.
“Yeah, I’ll let her know on my way out. I’ll be back tomorrow afternoon unless you need me sooner”
“Something smells nice” Arthur said as soon as he entered through the chimney.
“Anastasia?” Harry offered.
“What is this?”
Second day had been destined to picking Draco’s stuff and telling Narcissa about their plans. That had been something worth seeing. She had constantly been taking things in and out of Draco’s suitcase and kissing him in a very Molly-like way.
Harry was as excited as he was tired. He had had a couple of bad nights and he seemed to be getting too old for that. He had no idea what time was it, since he had left his watch and wand on the room and he couldn’t cast a damn
“That’s actually pretty amazing. What about Weasley?” Harry looked almost shocked.
“Of course I’ll go out with you, Harry” he answered sweetly before adding “But I still need to cut my hair. I’m sick of looking like my father” Harry laughed.
“I won’t ask why, obviously, but I have to admit I’m surprised he reached for you, unless he had completely lost his mind”
“Worst timing ever, Potter” he was smiling “But, I love you too”
Leaving aside his protests about Potter’s overprotection, he was being extra careful; the last thing he needed was to be sent to a hospital. He preferred to be in his comfort zone, especially if he was going to have around a certain dark-haired Boy-Who-Lived.
“Yes, I did. Two days more than you did” he pulled away.
“Come on, honey, just one. She will eat everything on her plate tonight, won’t you Lils?” Daddy Harry to the rescue. He looked at Draco and pouted too and that was it. Lucius laughed, hard, Narcissa tried to conceal her own smile and Draco rolled his eyes, handing his daughter a lemon tart.
“Ana. You did it! You survived!” he exclaimed running to hug his sister. She smiled and returned his hug.
“No more than an hour. Are you feeling any better?” Draco nodded, but held his head with one hand “Want something for the pain?”
“I’m a specialized healer and Dra…Mr. Malfoy is an excellent wand-maker; we can offer a lot of expertise in those areas”
“Did you find a cure on your own or am I just that good?” they entered the living-room where the two witches were still talking, this time comfortably sited on the sofa.
“I’m pathetic” he murmured smiling. He did not feel ashamed at all.
Draco’s breathing speeded up. He was afraid, terrorized of snakes. He needed to get out of that place.
They got to the bed and Harry made him lay, face down. The bump in his lower back was not that bad, since he had landed in the carpet, but it looked awful, nonetheless. The cut was closed in a couple of minutes and Harry had applied ointment and bound it up, it will take some time, as the previous wounds, but it would heal.
“Have you ever heard doctors are hard to date?” he nodded “Well, it seems to be true. Not many are taking the challenge these days” he was so very tempted to tell him he loved a good challenge, but he managed to control himself. Too early for being so forward, not to mention the fact that, at some point, he had acknowledged inside him that he liked Harry, maybe a little too much.
They found the unspeakable sharing a drink with a lady and decided not to bother him. Waving their goodbyes. They had already agreed that he would find them at the hotel when he had news from the ministry, so there was really not much left to do, except for waiting.
“Well, as you all know, I insisted a lot on this meeting, not just because I wanted to see you, but because I needed to tell you all something important” Ron was the only one who did not look confused. Bill sobered up instantly and Fleur opened her eyes, as if she had already comprehended what it was about “I’m pregnant. We are having another baby!” she announced and after two seconds of absolute silence they all burst in cheers and congratulations to the couple. Harry felt the tears forming but kept them controlled as he hugged the mother to be.
“Thank you, Kreacher. Can you show me the way to the rooftop?” the elf nodded and guided him to a small corner in the last floor. It seemed empty but Kreacher snapped his fingers and a ladder fell from a hatch that was not there before. He thanked the elf again and climbed the steps.
He stood up and headed to the studio, bag of cookies in hand, to write to Hermione. He guessed his friend would need to meet with Malfoy, so he better talked to her in private and face to face first. He asked her to meet with him next morning, at a muggle café they used to go when he was studying medicine in a regular university. Calling Hermes, his owl, he attached the envelope to his leg and sent him to Hermione’s office where she should be already.
“Harry!” Draco’s voice got to him first, while he was putting the wrapped meet into the oven, the sauce was on low-heat and he went back to stir it “I found it, Harry. Where the hell are you?”
“Yes, I think he could have been a wizard. Maybe there’s something about him back at Grimmauld”
“Teasing you. I didn’t notice it mattered to you that much” he turned to look at Harry. He was almost sure he wasn’t crying yet, but he was about to.
the call ended, leaving Harry with a genuine smile while he headed to the bathroom, already sensing the familiar smell of Kreacher’s vegan pie.
“Yes, Harry, I’m fine” he said while rolling his eyes, but in a sweet tone.
“They are not as jumpy as you are, prince”
“Harry?” the dark-haired man didn’t move. He had probably heard Draco coming up. He walked until he was standing next to him; it was a cloudy morning and the wind was destroying Draco’s hair, but it felt amazing “Listen, Harry…”
“We are not going anywhere with this, Potter” Draco had growled at some point while dropping his head back and letting the book rest on his chest.
“We can go after lunch. I want to go to the spa now”
“What do you mean?”
“I asked Bibly” he lied. He had just been paying attention when they had had lunch yesterday. He let them work and headed to the sofa. He had wanted to drink some of the brewing himself, but he was too jumpy already and it wouldn’t sooth his nerves at all.
“I don’t know if you are aware of it, since I didn’t talk about it nor during nor after the war, but there are those who know, anyway” he made a pause, waiting for Draco to interrupt him, but the blonde just stared at him curiously “When Voldemort killed my parents he, unconsciously, transferred a piece of his soul to me. I didn’t feel it, of course, I had grown with it, and therefore it felt normal, but then, the signs started to be more obvious. I used to have dreams of things I was doing but it wasn’t really me, I could speak Parsel like he could, I felt his fear, his pain, his joy, his anger as if it was mine, but at the same time I knew it was not. There is more to that I would rather not remember, but the point is, I get what you are feeling, even if is not under the same circumstances” Draco was trying really hard to control his emotions. He had lived with Voldemort under the same roof and he had been terrified, completely and utterly terrified, he wouldn’t even take his eyes from his shoes, he wouldn’t speak unless it was strictly necessary, he wouldn’t even eat or sleep most nights out of fear and worry; Potter had being linked with him, with his thoughts, his feelings, he had shared his soul, a piece of the man that killed his parents and tried the same with him many times, he had dreamed of him since he was a boy, it was so much worst and Draco had been an asshole with him, he had made his life even more miserable, he had done everything he could to humiliate and hurt him out of stupid pride and there he was, smiling at him and treating him with utmost kindness. Draco did not deserve that; he did not deserve him. “Draco? Are you okay?”
“I’ll let you know. Thanks, Herm”
“Yes, it’s actually a very good resume”
“Harry, I can’t stay like this. It’ll hurt me, or even kill me eventually”
“And Alexei? Why keep him in a void instead of sending him away with his family like you intended? He though you cared about him” poor boy.
“And stupidity. That’s why I can’t be a fool here”
“I see the mess in your hair is not extended to your studio. I’m impressed, Potter” he joked with a raised eyebrow and Harry rolled his eyes.
“Thank you for coming” she whispered in his ear.
“Fuck this” he drew his wand out and pointed it at Draco’s neck, breaking his connection with Alexei. His boyfriend stopped shaking as the ink mark disappeared, but passed out immediately. Harry positioned him on his lap and then pointed his wand at the few peasants that had stopped to watch them “
“I was. I’m perfectly healthy now, though. Thank you for your concern, Mrs. Tonks” he was being too respectful, but he used to be when he was nervous. It was either that or being a complete twat. Thankfully, it had been the first one.
“Fine” Draco’s voice came up harsher than intended but Harry didn’t look his way. He hadn’t for a second “I’ll go on my own, you don’t have to worry about getting in trouble. No need to save me this time” he turned around and started walking.
Lucky guy.
unlocking it “I swear to God I’m going to kill you if you dare opening that door, Harry Potter” he stopped for a second but pushed the door open anyway, finding the blond pouring his guts in the toilet once more. Harry kneeled beside him and held his hair so it wasn’t bothering him. His eyes were wet with tears, his own, not Alexei’s “I hate you”
“So, you can really know what he is saying. You are conscious”
“Come on, Teddy, Draco has to talk to his mother now. Let’s go get you a snack” the boy’s hair went back to blue again.
” she casted and dead Draco turned into a caterpillar. But they kept showing up.
He needed to rest. He had to run some errands in the morning and had plans for lunch with Luna, after dropping Teddy at his grandma’s. Closing his eyes, he tried to left his mind empty, thinking only about a white room or something like that like some therapists recommended. It took him some time, but finally he fell into a restless sleep, his dreams plagued with gray eyes, silver tears and creamy skin.
“He seems pretty out to me, headmaster. I think he has no idea what happened here and even if he did, it would do him no good to tell anyone”
“Isn’t that your work, Potter? You are supposed to be the brilliant one” Harry rolled his eyes.
“There’s nothing else in there, but at least we have found him” Draco added “He was the prince of Russia, well, the tsarevich. Now we just need to find out what happened” he added cheerfully, obviously proud of his finding after hours of reading.
Draco was alive. But he had not been hit by any spell. Harry glared at the Death, still floating above his head.
“Draco? It’s me”
“Harry is coming tonight. He wrote to me that he had had to work unexpectedly last night and he wasn’t getting home particularly early” Draco rolled his eyes.
“I wish he had a healer as thoughtful and gentle as Harry”
He was also supposed to have the gift of divination, and some of his prophecies had made an impact on his time, some like the ones that, allegedly, guided the Romanovs through the revolution. He had lost himself in the muggle world and abandoned everything related to his wizarding pairs since he left the school, returning to it just once after that, many years later. Most of the items and prophecies he had created had never been found and the single evidence left of him was in the archives of Koldovstoretz, not even his bones existed any longer.
“No, I think a couple times a week would do just fine, but I have to check on you at the beginning. It’s just regular procedure, since I work with combined treatments” he had finished packing up his stuff again and was about to head to the door “I’ll be going then”
Alexander seemed to think about it for a minute, more out of distrust than oblivion, but he finally let a breath out and nodded “Follow me” he commanded and Harry did so.
“We could ask Alexei too. He must have some information for us. The priest was his healer, so to speak” the sandwiches arrived along with the fresh brewed beverages.
“It looks dangerous” he swallowed it anyway and gave Harry the glass back.
“I’m sorry” he felt the tears burning in his eyes but unlike other times he did not look away. He stared right into Potter’s emerald eyes, opened widely in shock “I’m so sorry, Harry”
“This is ridiculous” Harry complained after three hours of pointless search “I don’t need to know Slytherin’s offspring, I need the bloody royal family”
and Potter smiled. He bloody smiled.
Draco said nothing. Nor did Harry.
“I am pretty sure
“Welcome, Master and Master’s friend” an old house elf, with impossibly clear blue eyes was taking Harry’s case and levitating it towards the upper floor.
“Mr. Smirnov, I hope you are here to admit I was right about Harry Potter” Shestakov answered.
For all answer he received another kiss. A deep, rough, savage kiss. That was all he needed.
The book he had taken from the library was about dark arts and magical possession. He had found it years after the war and Merlin knew he had needed it before, but fate was a tricky thing and he had decided that going against it had consequences most of the time and not all of them were worth it. His eyes went through the pages that explained the numerous modifications that could happen when a body was magically possessed, most of them didn’t feel right in Harry’s mind. Soul sharing was not covered in the book, but he knew for sure that it made it easier for the being to control a different person, especially if the later had a strong will or enough power to fight back the intruder.
“Your father did”
He reached the door and pulled it open. The biggest house elf he had seen in his entire life was waiting at the other side. He was used to smaller specimens and this one was impressive. He was holding a bundle of letters and he looked really surprised to find him in that room.
“Neither have I” the dark-haired wizard offered “but according to the report, there was a case fifty-seven years ago”
“I’m…” Draco stopped. He actually need to think the answer. He was fine, but, how? “Confused. Do you mind telling me what the actual hell happened?” Harry laughed and the sound made him shiver.
“That sound” he checked his pockets but he hadn’t even brought his cellphone with him and it was not that kind of buzzing. He could recognize that sound anywhere, even with his current fatigue “Is that a snitch?”
It made Harry even sicker.
“Did I miss anything?” he asked as soon as he recovered, and Hermione looked at him with a mischievous smile.
“Yay, sweets” and like that he was running away.
The place had been built not too long ago on top of the remnants of the old Ipatiev House, where the royal family had been murdered during the revolution. That definitely caught the wizards’ attention.
“Why would I?” he asked seriously confused receiving a chuckle from Harry.
Three hours later Kreacher was knocking at the door.
Next he knew, he was standing in a much modern living room, exquisitely decorated and surprisingly welcoming. Narcissa led him to the second floor, and asked him to wait by the door for a second as she entered. He checked his wristwatch, he should have been tired from the night shift, but he was extremely alert instead, no wonder why, since that letter had been alarming even with little information.
Harry soaked the brush and leaned in. Draco stretched his neck to grant the healer better access and comfort to draw. The black hair was tickling his nose, but he controlled the urge of scratching; instead, he focused on the musky smell that came from it. Harry was so close to him that Draco was having a really hard time not looking at his lips or eyes, or anything that he could lose himself in. He was not made of stone.
“I knew it would upset him, but never like this” it was true. Draco would have never imagined that the man could react that way. Last night they didn’t even talk about it.
“Are you really calling him Harry now?”
“It’s the cross. That’s his wand. You have to be careful” Draco warned him.
Harry had made every sort of changes to the house since he moved in. For an instance, he had gotten rid of the last floor; that attic had always been nothing but trouble. He had also transformed the basement into a cellar, where he kept every imaginable product under preservation charms; really useful with his irregular schedule. He had changed the distribution of the dining-room and managed to split it in two, so now he had a living-room and a smaller dining space next to the kitchen in the main floor.
“Many times” Draco wasn’t sure if the man was joking “Rather handsome boy”
“I love you” he said against Draco’s neck. He had said those words before, but he hadn’t meant them. He thought he had, but he was obviously wrong “I love you, Draco” he repeated and the blond pulled away.
Then, everything happened too fast. Rasputin sent a Disarming Charm, Harry casted a
“I do speak more than English, Potter”
“We’ll meet again, Master”
“Where were you before I talked to you?” how was he going to tell the boy that ninety years had passed in what should have felt like a minute to him?
“The same. I live there with Kreacher and Teddy when he spends the night” he felt suddenly sick. Harry was more close to his own family than he had ever tried to be. He knew he had a cousin, but his mother and aunt had not seen each other in decades, so he didn’t know the boy. On top of it, Harry was living in his mother’s ancestral house, a place he had never visited before.
She nodded “I’ll leave you two speak. Please, tell your mother I’ll be downstairs if she needs anything” he let her pass and went inside the room.
“Draco, what’s wrong? Are you feeling bad?” he tried again in the calmest voice he could manage at the moment. His eyes were fixed in the shaking figure as he grabbed a letter-opener from somewhere near the desk and pointed it to Harry. Was that there before? It didn’t matter. The only important thing at the moment was Draco and the way he was hurting his palm with the sharpened object.
“Master Draco, your mother is waiting for you in the garden, sir. She asked Bibly to come look for you” the blond fixed his eyes in the clock above the window, noticing it was half past five already. He loosened his hair from the bun where he kept it so it didn’t bother him while working before addressing the creature.
The red-haired man was actively ignoring him, while his wife and best friend talked and exchanged opinions and made corrections on the parchments. Draco had no intention of making everything more awkward, but he had to be a good host since his mother was nowhere to be found. So much for concern.
“Sure. Let’s get changed” they moved around the room to get ready while talking about other plans they could get done until Monday.
He knew it when he spoke again. He felt an alien fear, completely different from his own anticipation one. He was not in control now. He was Alexei in Harry’s arms.
“Wait here, I will distract Inna. Go straight to your room when you find the chance”
He ran like the devil was chasing him. He had a bad feeling. Draco wouldn’t have left his room in that state. He wouldn’t be walking around the castle looking sick.
Oh, yeah, he had been avoiding looking at the man’s hands every time they were anywhere near his body. That would be reason enough.
“How is your daughter?” he asked the wizard in front of him after a couple minutes of silence. He was determined to prove he was better than his younger self. Weasley looked surprised, but when he recovered, his answer didn’t come as harsh as before.
“I said it because he had an awful handwriting, but, yes, of course, Cyrillic; silly me” Harry had to laugh in spite of the circumstances “The point is, I have read it before. It is all theories and gibberish about soul linking and reincarnation and stuff like that”
Draco was frowning when Harry entered his room, his eyes lost in the outside of the window. The sheets had been changed to a light blue set and Draco was partially covered by them, his upper body resting in the pillows against the wall and his healthy leg flexed with one of his arms resting on it. It was quite a sight. Nothing new in Draco being beautiful, but even wounded the man looked like a Greek statue that had jumped out of the pedestal and decided to walk among mortals. Then, there were the scars across his chest that still made Harry flinch even when they were half-covered by the bandages. If he regretted something in his life, that was it.
“Yes, they have a daughter, and Herm is pregnant again” now that was something Pansy wouldn’t know. She was going to throw a tantrum, for sure. Draco was about to answer when the door opened and his mother came through.
“What the fuck, Potter? I could have been naked!” Draco shouted while squeezing his chest with one hand. If he didn’t die from Hemophilia he would definitely have a heart attack, anyway, his days were counted.
“Master Draco, Bibly has a question, sir”
“It’s okay, love. They have nothing on us” he caressed Draco’s cheek.
The man took out a small knife and made an extremely dramatic and deep cut on his palm, letting a couple drops fall on the rug and finally made his way towards the entry.
“I want you with me. I need you to do this, please” Harry’s look was dark and intense and Draco feared he would say no despite everything, but he kissed him once more and the blond felt his heart fill with hope.
He made his way to the second floor and located the guests room, where he could hear voices. He was about to knock when the door opened and he was facing Andromeda Tonks. He had been expecting that after seeing Teddy, but it still was a terribly awkward moment.
Draco moved between his arms and changed positions so he was now burring his face in Harry’s chest. He couldn’t control a smile. The blond was absolutely adorable and had shown him a new level of it every night they had spent together since the rooftop moment.
Draco moved a bit in his arms and said something incomprehensible in his sleep. His eyes were swollen and his lip had started to bleed at some point from how hard he had bitten it but he was still the most beautiful man Harry had laid his eyes on. He was a very lucky guy after all.
He knew he was about to reach the end of the stairs. He had been going down, but he could perfectly found himself on top of them. He hoped he didn’t; he would hate to have to start again.
He was standing in his own room and yet, he was laying on his bed, asleep, pale and shivering, right after having changed bodies with Alexei.
He had a shift in St. Mungo that evening, but it was still early so he made his way upstairs and locked himself in his studio with Malfoy’s papers to finish up his notes on the day before starting to work on the medication.
Harry was nuts and Draco was doomed.
Draco had suggested to invite Harry’s cousin and his family, since they had been closer after Dudley’s daughter turned out to be a witch and he had gone to Harry for advice, but the brunet had convinced him that it would be uncomfortable enough without a bunch of muggles there.
“Why don’t you ask our guest, Bibly?” he offered and looked at Harry, who was smiling too.
That castle was absurd. Why on earth had he ever considered the place to be beautiful? Had he done that? He didn’t remember. Draco intellectually knew he should ask for help, but his logical-thinking had ceased functioning for some time now. He had a single idea on his mind. He had to find the basement.
Nothing would have prepared Draco for what was waiting for him there.
“I should shave after breakfast, I’m a mess” he meant it, he had never take so little care of his beard before, but he had been too busy to notice it until now.
“Let’s take care of that leg” the thigh wound was the nastiest one. The others had healed just fine, the stitches had vanished by themselves, leaving a thin red line that will soon disappear too, but that one was giving him hell.
First, Harry had visited every patient he had and left them an emergency contact for one of his colleagues. That had taken him a nice chunk of the day but when he had arrived home Draco had pinned him against the nearest wall and kissed the air out of him.
“When Harry told me about this I remembered something I read once in one of the case reports from the curse-breaker’s files at the ministry. It clicked then, you are not cursed as Harry initially thought” Hermione intervened.
“That case report Hermione mentioned before helped on that matter, since I had the same doubt” he answered with a comforting smile and Draco turned his gaze to her.
“So, you are the famous Draco Malfoy” the man said “I’ve heard a lot about you. How is your mother?” Regulus, Regulus, ah, his mother’s cousin. Sirius’ brother. Wait, he had heard about him?
“I don’t recommend you do anything exhausting or physically demanding, but I see no reason why you couldn’t do simple stuff, at least until you get your treatment”
“He looks fine, mom” Ginny defended him and kissed him in the cheek “Hey, stranger”
“I think so. I still feel like I’m not the one who’s ill. Is like my body chose to deteriorate on its own, it’s actually very disturbing” his mother gave him one of those looks, again. She claimed that she believed him, but her eyes made it clear that it was not the case; she was trying though and he appreciated it “Anyway, we need to talk”
Great; he had become a damn Hufflepuff, and he had Draco to blame for that.
Almost empty.
“I’m desperate” Harry laughed anyway. Draco was looking at him, but he made an effort to stay focused on his task.
“I told you how I had a piece of Voldemort’s inside me and it had pretty similar effects. They are more accurate than those from regular possession and it could also explain your illness”
“What kind of test?”
He grabbed another cookie.
“And I’m the dangerous one” he breathed in deeply and tried to relax. The oven ringed “See, you are too distracting. It’s going to burn”
“Come on, Draco, let’s get you to bed”
“Because I think that’s the only explanation for this” one of the blonde’s eyebrows arched inquiringly “Not only the symptoms are clear, but the tests reveal you lack one of the coagulation factors, number XVIII to be precise. That’s indicative of Hemophilia”
attitude” he had to chuckle at that.
“What? Stop thinking nonsenses, Potter. How can a single person be so dumb? Of course I’m not pregnant” Draco rolled his eyes “And you are the doctor”
He had no idea what Malfoy was going through, but he could personally compare the sensation with being submerging in cold water while his body was on fire. It was, at the same time, a comforting and aggressive feeling. His magic was searching every inch of Draco’s insides, it brushed his core, making the blond shiver slightly, but it continued his way. Harry was still talking, repeating the spell over and over again.
“Are you okay?” Draco jumped, startled and glared at him in a very Malfoy way.
“Have a quiet night, Mr. Potter, or should I say Healer Potter?”
Before Harry noticed, it was lunch time so they also took a table at a small restaurant on that same street. Then, they went to a couple museums and a monastery called Ganina-something where Draco took around twenty photos claiming that it had a very beautiful green color and that muggle camera was not making it justice.
“Oh, nothing, just called to remind you of dinner. Wednesday night, at George’s this time”
“I think it was the other way around, Mr. Dark Magic, sir” Draco had laughed and Harry had confirmed he was completely at ease with his past. He kissed his smile and lead him to the kitchen to get some wine and cheese and a ton more kisses.
Not even Hermione’s news or Teddy’s loving words were enough to get the oppression out of Harry’s chest. He knew Lucius was sick, but it was supposed to be mentally speaking. According to Narcissa, he had had a heart attack and by the time they had found him the damage was beyond repair. The doctors had said his heart had apparently been affected while he was in Azkaban but they never paid any attention to it since wizards tended to be fairly protected by their magical cores against organ failure. Harry knew best.
Somehow, after some time none of them was eating anymore, looking at each other intensely instead. Draco’s gaze moved to Harry’s lips and he licked them unconsciously. Harry was not sure if he had imagined it, or Draco was actually getting closer, but he panicked.
“Yes” he answered simply. Death was still behind him. He had no clue why. It could not be afraid and if so, Harry thought of himself as a very little comfort.
“You have not answered any of my questions. But yes. Ask”
Granger was muttering something under her breath while going through Harry’s notes. They had called her extremely late last night when they were done discussing the healer’s plan to stablish some sort of communication with the invader. Draco had almost enjoyed hearing Weasley’s annoyed and borderline jealous voice in the back of the bizarre artefact Harry had used to call the witch. A cellphone, he had called it. Draco obviously knew what a cellphone was, but he had imagined something rather different. He found himself fascinated over the item and had toyed with it until Harry had agreed to teach him all about it.
“Are you my cousin? Grandma said I had one but I thought it was a lie” that broke a little piece of Draco’s heart, but he had a chance to fix that and he was not going to let it go.
“More than you think” it was Death voice. It hadn’t spoken until then.
“Wait” Draco had the black sheets in a strong hold, he could do this. They weren’t kids anymore, he was a mature, grown up man and it was not that difficult “Thank you, for everything” he didn’t want to, but he forced himself to look at Harry, just to find him smiling, almost tenderly. One would have thought for a moment that he truly cared for Draco, but he probably was like that with all his patients and that didn’t make it any less heartwarming.
“Dad, are you okay?” he didn’t like this place. They had been taken away from the palace and he still wasn’t sure why. He knew something was happening in the country, he had seen the people shout at the palace gates but, why? Why were they angry? Why  had his father told him he was no longer the tsarevich? Had he done something wrong?
“Oh dear, don’t even mention it. He would curse him into next week, no doubt” they both laughed at the comment and continued eating “Are you feeling any better?” she asked after some time passed.
He lighted a cigarette and headed to the kitchen. Kreacher was cleaning the already spotless surface of the counter, and stopped as soon as his master entered.
He snapped out of his mind at the same time something abnormal tickled his fingertips. He had been forced to identify Harry because his wand was missing, he remembered that, but why did it seem so relevant right now? Draco looked down, to the wood stick that was whispering something odd. The core was just fine but the holly wood had changed, had been forced to change, to renew. It had been broken once and, even when it was ludicrous, it had been fixed.
He took a piece of paper out of his pocket; Alexander had written the names he needed so he could recognize the prophecy if it even existed, but in spite of that it was not going to be an easy task. There were at least a thousand orbs there and he didn’t have much time, but that was not going to stop him. He started his search, reading tag by tag and trying to match the letters with the ones on the parchment.
What had happened? He had been avoiding spells and letting Harry defend them one minute and the next one he was there in a bright, red and gold room, a horrible, familiar decoration. He knew he was not in Koldovstoretz anymore. It was a beautiful palace but not that cozy.
“You wish” the answer had come out his mouth before he noticed. Making him bite his lower lip. Potter did not seem to know what to say, but he did blush a bit.
Harry’s studio was their first stop, and Draco took a minute to be amazed with how organized and professional it looked. It was even tidier than his own workshop. It was huge, and covered in bookshelves and workspaces, except for one wall, with a painted family tree; the Black Family Tree, which Draco took his time to absorb.
“This is all, I am afraid, and you will understand little to nothing”
“Come on, Draco, you have to be at least a little bit surprised”
“Did you hear about Herm’s pregnancy?”
“I can help” Nikolay smiled.
“So you told him how to get in here”
“He is stable, darling. Herr Schmidt has been most helpful”
“No. August. Is it not July? It was July last time” it was when he had died.
“Good to know, Potter” the unimpressed tone made Harry flinch.
“How are you feeling?” the blond jumped, startled. Apparently he hadn’t heard him coming in.
They got to Robards’ office and knocked.
He made sure the patient was stable before returning to the dorms and grabbing his notes on vaccines and their possible application in the prevention of dragon pox. Two hours later, his wand, hidden in his trousers, vibrated, indicating that his shift was over, so he took his stuff and made his way to the main door, signing the necessary paper for the entering doctors, and left the hospital.
“Kitchen” was his answer. The blond girl popped her head first and smiled.
“I’m old, Harry. I’m as old as the world itself. I have been here to see every time, every war, every fight, every disease, every famine, every single death. I don’t do it for my own pleasure, I am just doing my job. Therefore, I’m not an irrational being. I don’t just take a healthy man’s life for the mere fact that they fell through one of my veils” the explanation was taking too long, but, as stupid as Harry could get to be, he was not going to rush Death “In those cases, they face a test. They can choose whether to stay in there or come back. Your godfather preferred what my world offered; maybe your friend would prefer yours”
“Hey” he whispered back “I’m sorry I woke you” Harry smiled again. His eyes were only half open from sleep and he looked completely adorable. That man was just unfair.
“It’s not that hard with magic. I got lazy over dessert, though, but I’ve got strawberries and whipped cream. Never fails” Draco’s face was priceless, and Harry was starting to ask himself why had he never told the blond he could cook so he could have seen this expression sooner.
“Hi, honey. I see you have taken a nap” he said before kissing him and Draco hurried to fix his hair, messy from his slumber. His eyes fallowed Harry as he said hello to his parents. He focused on the ring on his left hand.
“It’s okay, Harry. It’s just a little” he could see the discomfort in the dark-haired man’s face.
“Teddy?” Draco nodded “Great, he is starting Hogwarts next year. He loves Quidditch and I think he would torment Minerva to no end; he is a mischievous little thing” he was smiling widely, and it was contagious.
The clock struck two and Harry swallowed hard.
“Smells good, what are you cooking?” he had taken his eyes off the book to sip at his wine.
“Thanks for everything, George, hope you give that unlucky tart a proper funeral”
“I know you did, dear, but I should have anyway. Come along, I’ll show you the guest room in case you need some privacy while you are here” Narcissa moved towards the stairs and he smiled softly.
“What are you doing here?”
He kept looking until he encountered a brooms’ cabinet, very similar to those in Hogwarts where he would hide from Pansy when she was set on seducing him. That’s it. The library had to be there.
“I know, Draco” he interrupted “I know is not that bad, I know I’m overreacting, I know, believe me. But I’m done chasing chaos, I’m done looking for trouble and I’m done risking people’s life”
“Is good to see you, Molly. You look gorgeous today”
“What do you mean?”
He pocketed Harry’s wand and put on a pair of shoes. He looked out the window to see the sun setting behind the Urals. He needed some answers, there had to be something that gave sense to that and he was going to find it.
They had organized the trip in three days.
He opened his eyes again. This was not something he could do on his own, unfortunately. He looked to where his guest room’s widow was. Harry had it closed, but the curtains were drawn, so he managed to see the messy black hair of his healer. He seemed to be working on the desk, elbows down in some book as it seemed to be the usual.
“I have” he admitted, blushing. He had been thinking constantly about that since he had seen little Lily in the veil. He wondered if she could really exist, he wanted her to exist.
“The Black family house?” Draco asked. He had heard about Sirius Black being Potter’s godfather back when they were in third year, but it had been just a rumor back then.
“Why would a healer do something so detrimental?” Harry felt no criticism, but genuine interest and concern, so he forced his barriers down and gave the blond the most honest answer he could offer.
“So, Draco, I have already told Herm the main information and she seems to agree with my latest assumption, but we think that is important to check your core one more time, and, if you are feeling any better, we could also take a look at your soul”
He had to write to Hermione and call the hospital. He should probably eat something more substantial and less sugary and he definitely had to drink some more coffee. He had to take a shower and change clothes, and maybe he should take a couple potions to fight the fatigue, but right now he just wanted to stay in his bed and eat ginger cookies forever.
He had the key to save the boy from an eternity apart from his family and to give Draco his life back. He just needed to unravel its meaning.
“Yes?” they were laying face to face, their noses almost touching. Draco had felt brave enough to spoke his feelings, he had, but that had been just for a moment. When Harry’s emerald eyes had looked at him, he freaked out.
“Draco, babe, are you okay?” he asked holding his boyfriend so he didn’t fall to the ground. He was covering his ears and had his eyes shut “Please, Draco, talk to me” Harry could not make magic there to know if he was physically fine, he tried a wandless diagnosis but he was not focused enough, he was way too worried. That’s why he was not supposed to get involved with patients, he was certain of it now; it clouded his judgment.
“You better. You could make a thesis on this subject and I want in” Ronald was next to his wife immediately while Potter kept pushing her in his workshop’s direction. Maybe his mother was right, again, and he did need a fireplace in the main house “Good bye, Draco. Nice to see you again” she managed to say in between Harry’s shoving.
“You are not allergic to cats; I know that” he did. He had seen his medical records and Draco was not allergic to anything, but maybe he just didn’t like cats “Do you want to go to a different place?” he liked to annoy the man, but he was not that cruel.
He could still hear Tatiana crying. They had suffered so much. Shot after shot after shot.
Harry had felt so happy ten seconds ago that it didn’t even surprise him when everything had gone to hell. Draco had stopped moving his lips and he hadn’t answered when Harry had called his name. Therefore, he was not surprised either when the man pushed him away. He left Alexei take his time to realize he was in control of Draco’s body now.
That had gone well…
“I’ll see you around, I guess” Blaise nodded with a mocking grin on his face that Harry didn’t understand, but the man had always been like that. He always looked like he knew something the rest of the presents ignored.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Me too. I am better. My leg hurts a bit though, but is not insufferable” the healer nodded.
He was halfway into the cooking when the chimney activated and Luna’s voice reached him from the living-room.
“Remarkable, really. A most endearing story, buy, you see, I can’t have you here. Any of you. It would be troublesome” he said while pacing around, apparently affected “I need to make a new life for myself, and you two look like you could prevent that from happening” he stroked his beard and ended up touching his cross again. He seemed to have assumed that Death wouldn’t hurt him, so he was more confident “I am terribly sorry” he said and a flash of green light came from one side, straight to where Draco was standing.
“No” they hadn’t talked about kids aside from that time at the hotel “We have been together for too little. I don’t want to rush anything or do something that would scare him” he said and Hermione smiled, understandingly.
Draco opened his eyes and reached for his throat. He had a pulse, he was breathing, he was alive.
“And this is it?” he asked although he hadn’t take his eyes off the little thing’s screen, tapping every colored icon he could see.
“A bath and a full massage, but I’ll manage” he winked at Harry before noticing. He was too flirty that morning and he was having a bad time controlling it. To his surprise, Potter didn’t look annoyed, but amused, and gave him a teasing smirk back. He ended up being the astonished one.
“Merlin. Don’t ever say that again, not even kidding, man. I have a heart to look after” he laughed, and wave them goodbye before picking up his stuff and Teddy’s and making his way to carry the boy.
“Ms. Cissy’s son?” he asked shyly.
“Take off your clothes, please”
“I have been looking for Mr. Malfoy but he was not in his room. I have letters for you and Mr. Potter. I was going to leave them all with him but I can leave them all with you instead. Have a good afternoon, sir” the elf handed him the package and disappeared. Draco was still intrigued by the creature’s size when he closed the door and threw the stack of papers on the bed.
“You look like hell, have you slept at all?” this time Blaise was the one talking.
“Draco, darling, are you sure you are okay?” that was probably the fifth time that morning that his mother had asked him the same. She had arrived at his place when Draco was putting together some breakfast, concerned about his health.
“Well, is that our permission?” he was now sat in the bed, hugging his legs. Harry unfolded the parchment and read its content carefully.
The balcony’s windows were open. The chilly air making the curtains wave and his skin burn, except for his hands, wrapped around a hot cup of tea. It was absurd to be standing half naked there but Draco had no intention of moving right now. Harry had gone somewhere, probably the library, and hadn’t come back yet, making him worry with every hour that went by.
“Connection?” Harry asked. He had been trying for too long to bring some sense upon Alexei’s situation; he wouldn’t refuse some answers. Even if they were coming from that man.
, Harry had gotten the idea. He reached for his phone, stopping to look at the wallpaper, the picture of Draco and the cat, and smiled, before trying to get it to work, but it would not connect to the internet which was not a surprise since they were in that godforsaken castle and that left Harry really curious.
He was not panicking again. It could be worse. It could have been happening to his mother. He would be fine. No need to worry.
“Some beauty sleep” he joked and tried to adjust his position on the bed but his arms failed him and he hissed in pain.
“Fine, I’ll tell you” he told Draco everything from founding the little girl to going through the passage and finding the chamber. How Rasputin had come out of the veil, how he had told Harry everything about his manipulations and schemes in order to resuscitate in a better time. Then he told him about the headmaster being Rasputin’s grandson and Alexander saving them from trouble. He happened to be the former headmaster of the school and current Guardian of Secrets, highest position in a place that, obviously, had a lot to hide. After that, it had only taken Harry the time he needed to pick up their stuff to get out of the castle. Alexander had guided them through the security and dropped them at the Balachko Hotel “We agreed on erasing our visit from any record. He contacted the RUMMA and they made a cover up story for us. To the public record, we have never been in Koldovstoretz” he explained.
“I thought you said you were not an irrational being” Harry was angry and disgusted and he was insulting Death itself. He had finally lost his mind.
The central area of the hotel was not only destined to the reception, apparently. On the higher levels there were restaurants and casinos and the famous spa the manger had mentioned; there was also an indoors-pool that mimicked a natural beach, waves and everything.
The link was broken in an instant, it was not hard to notice, and Draco ran away to the bathroom covering his mouth with his healthy hand. Harry ran after him and knocked the door insistently. He could hear him vomiting and sobbing; no surprise there. He was actually concerned it didn’t happen to Alexei.
“He insisted and he is a very charming young man, I see no reason to contradict his preferences” he cut a piece of roasted beef, the smell of buttered onions reaching his nose before he even ate the meat.
“Language, Draco” he rolled his eyes. He was 28 years old and his mother still scolded him like he was five “He is the only known healer who has studied muggle medicine as well. He has actually made great contributions to the field and your affection is clearly not a simple magical illness, otherwise you would be cured by now, so you will do everything he commands you, okay? I’m not losing my son too” she was almost in tears and he felt like crap for making her feel so sad and worried. He made his way to her and took her between his arms as she sobbed in a very unlike-her way.
“This is hideous” as soon as Draco entered the room he had complained “Who in his right mind would decorate a whole half of a hotel in Gryffindor colors? Is just such an obvious poor taste demonstration” Harry laughed at his back.
“I’m not jumpy, I was just too focused. These are definitely more instructive on the matter than the ones at your house” he seemed to have had a similar idea about writing down some notes, but instead of buying the materials he had apparently had the chance to conjure them “Did you find something?”
“Draco, please, you need to be reasonable. We have to try, Mr. Potter is really capable, I’ve look for references and I’m sure his expertise would be helpful” her mother’s voice was stained with concern. He knew he wasn’t fine, he needed help, but why on earth did it have to come from Scar-Head?
“Oh, come on, I know you do too” he rolled his eyes, cheeks blushing.
“Well, I’m actually a cookie guy, Bibly, but between you and me, I’m addicted to treacle tart” he whispered secretively, but Draco heard him and rolled his eyes.
It had been a long since he had kissed someone, but he could not lie to himself and say that that was why it felt so good. Harry tasted amazingly, even with the dim flavor of the cigarette in his tongue. His skin was burning against Draco’s and his hair felt incredibly soft.
Prince? His mother had never called him that. He was little dragon to her.
“Don’t change the topic” one of the jars appeared to refill his orange juice “What is it?” Draco sighed and left his fork on the plate. He murmured something that Harry couldn’t hear “Sorry, what was that?”
He tried to open the door but it wouldn’t budge so he took out Harry’s wand and pointed it to the doorknob.
“Harry, have you tried this?” he asked finally, pointing enthusiastically at the beef with his fork.
“Well, I’m officially asking, are you going to make me suffer while I wait for the answer, prince?” he copped Draco’s cheek and the blond pressed against his palm.
“I will try to come up with something, though I can’t promise anything”
“Make him stop, please, Harry” Draco almost screamed. Harry was about to panic. Things could get really bad and they were in public. He could not apparate him in that state either.
Anastasia. She had managed to escape. He knew it.
“I don’t think she’ll be joining us. Bibly says she went out and didn’t say where or when was she coming back” Harry nodded and started putting some dill marinated salmon and arugula salad into his plate. Draco picked the same and poured some white wine into their glasses.
The lion-shaped clock from the counter ringed, indicating the time was up and Harry moved to get the beef out. He summoned a pair of dishes and cut enough for Draco and himself, added the sauce, mashed potatoes and the already dressed salad.
“Good to know. I guess I should thank you for saving me the trouble of saying I don’t like it”
“Only if you call me Hermione” they both smiled and the only reason Harry’s head didn’t explode was Narcissa coming into the workshop.
“Food is ready” she enjoyed those words, she really did, and that’s why Harry had let her bring the food to the table. They all gathered and took their sits. Ronald took a chicken leg and broke the ice. Everyone joined him and, for a few minutes, with no other sound than clicking glasses and compliments for the chef, they looked like a normal family.
Harry lighted his wand’s tip; he was sick of being in the dark. Rasputin was certainly different from what Harry had imagined. He had pictured him as a dark, discrete, insane man, but he was actually a very alluring person. He was big, with broad shoulders and blue, tender eyes, a calm voice and a disarming self-trust. He knew he was powerful; he knew he could probably do anything he wanted just by saying the right words.
“Yes, she is alive. Do you want to talk to her?” Grigori asked and he nodded, or tried to.
“It seems so” he was still stirring the red wine sauce, but stopped to taste it, adding a bit more of ground pepper.
“Why?” he looked truly curious.
He was just a boy in a glass bubble.
“Where is he?!” he asked again. He knew the answer but he needed to know. Death raised a bony finger and pointed the arc.
“Parchment, ink and black tea, please. I have to let everyone know I’m fine and back to work. Pansy threaten to come here and look after me personally if I didn’t send report to her every day’’
“I could have guessed that, genius” the dark-haired wizard ignored him. He knew Draco was tense.
“I’ll be damned. You call him by his name too” Blaise joked and the others ignored him.
“Do you need anything?”
His thoughts traveled inevitably to his school years, to the day he met Harry on Madame Malkin’s shop, to the first time he rode the Hogwarts Express, to the moment Dumbledore took the House Cup from them to give it to his savior’s house, to the Dueling Club, Harry’s wand pointing to his face, the same wand that was now abandoned on the damn table, away from its master and its purpose.
“Oh, come on, you are a healer, dude. You need to think of some weird condition that persuades her. Please, I’m your best friend” he was just half joking. Hermione had really started labor in the middle of an investigation.
Their first stop was on Vaynera Street where they located a fancy beauty center and Draco got his hair-cut. From then on, Harry was dragged shop after shop until Draco bought enough souvenirs for his friends and his mother, he even bought tiny leather fingerless gloves for Bibly; when Harry asked why, Draco explained that she was a free elf, she was an employee with a salary, vacations and medical insurance as the new law dictated. Anyway, if you asked her, she would probably declare his absolute loyalty to them.
“Please” Harry moved and grabbed a bottle form his case before handing it to his patient along with a glass of water. Draco drank the medicine in one go and took a sip from the glass.
“That can’t be true” Draco had been one of the most popular guys back at Hogwarts and he was even more attractive now if that was possible; not to mention the change in his personality which earned him some more favorable points.
“Are you trying to kill me from anguish, Potter? Because you might succeed”
Narcissa enjoyed the social life in France, enough to keep her distracted from the grieve of losing her husband. Lucius was alive, but not within the living. He had gone completely mental while in prison, and five years after the trials he had been transferred to Saint-Anne’s Hospital, in Paris. It was both a magical and muggle facility, and while Draco didn’t know why they had agreed to bring him near his family, he was grateful for it. Maybe his father would never recognize him again, but seeing him peaceful with his own mind was enough for him. What he didn’t remember, couldn’t harm him.
“I’m sorry, I got too excited” at least he had de decency to blush and apologize “I’ve got your medicine” he added, holding a funny-looking vial, shaped as a tear with a thin tip on one end, and a greenish-blue liquid inside.
“I am; it was nothing”
He had spoken in plural when he proposed the trip because at some point he had started to think of them as a team; he had the feeling he would not have the strength to go anywhere to solve this if he didn’t have Harry to lean on, to make him feel safe. But the asshole had decided that scare and worry him was a better approach. Good. He didn’t need Potter. It was his soul after all.
That small, brave, stupid boy, had become a wonderful, sweet, brilliant man with beautiful green eyes, gentle hands and a criminal smile. And on top of it, that impressive man was interested in him, of all people. He knew everything about him, and yet, he had chosen to be there, by his side. Two things were for sure:
“Sweets are what fatten the most” she said before taking a bite of it “I will sacrifice for you”
“Harry…please” he begged, hoping his boyfriend would understand what he was asking for, but Harry seemed to be ignoring him. Only seconds after Draco felt how one finger joined Harry’s tongue on the task, burring inside Draco with little effort “Oh, Merlin” he moaned when it started to move.
“Am I dead?” the question surprised Harry, since the blond had not opened his eyes yet.
“I want to take you out on a date, a proper one. I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like we have gone too fast” Draco raised an eyebrow “Not in a bad way, but I want to court you like you deserve, like I would have if we had met again on different circumstances, I want to do this right, Draco” he stopped, feeling embarrassed. He was not a cheesy person; he would almost never speak about his feelings or try to show them so enthusiastically, and he had just blurted all that out without even blinking “You can say no, of course, but, would you please go on a date with me, Draco Malfoy?” the other wizard stared at him with a blank expression for a moment, a way too long moment if you asked Harry.
“Is there anything you need?”
“I want to take a bath” he asked and Harry smiled. That was something he could do to make him feel better.
“Harry…I’m not going to last…please” he murmured, or he tried, he had no idea if he had managed to say it. He already had two fingers moving inside and he was sure he had lost the ability to articulate. Harry pulled away slowly, sending a shiver up his spine.
There was something hanging from it, a veil or something like that. A foggy, dark veil that fell in shreds from top to bottom and moved softly, like it had just been touched or the air had moved it. But there was no air in there. There was nothing and no one.
The day passed with them on bed, Harry checking on him every hour and Draco trying to make some sense of his latest dream. He had not told anything to Harry yet, since the wizard didn’t need another reason to worry; he had enough on his plate already and it was all because of him.
He found himself in the main floor without knowing exactly how had he gotten there. He looked in every room he found, he checked the infirmary and the offices, everywhere he could but he didn’t see him. He asked around to a couple of students who avoided him and a professor that answered nastily that he hadn’t seen the blond wizard. Harry tried to calm himself. He was not helping anyone by being so nervous. He had to stop and think.
“We decided to apparate, dear. You know your father hates floo dirt”
“I’m sorry. I will sleep today if this goes well” Draco, already sited, looked up to the dark-haired man with concern “It cannot go wrong in a harmful way, but I couldn’t say it went well if it doesn’t work, right?” he explained comfortingly and Draco nodded “You may want to take the shirt off. This will stain” he added with a bottle of enchanted ink and a thin brush in hand.
He heard something then, but he could not get his eyes off the paper. He felt Harry calling his name but he didn’t answer. He knew his boyfriend was touching him, asking him if he was okay but he wasn’t even blinking. His eyes were going again and again over the same sentence.
“Shower is all yours. I’m going to make us some breakfast” he threw a shirt on and left the room.
Of course he was no longer the rude, cruel monster he had been ten years ago, but he had no interest in letting anyone in, and then take care of his feelings and all that stuff. But that had changed when he had met with Harry again. He was not only intrigued with the man he had become, he was fascinated.
Harry was used to take care of people, in fact, he had been doing that for the biggest part of his life, but never like this. He was used to sick people, crying kids, scared wizards that looked for the hero in him, wounded friends and desperate strangers; people needing him, depending on him, that was the common ground. But he knew Draco was strong, independent and proud, and yet, he was letting Harry look after him in his moments of vulnerability. He was allowing Harry to heal him and trusting him to help him if he needed it. He knew, for example, that he could fall sleep right now and he would wake up cuddled up in Harry’s arms, either there or in his bed, but definitely safe.
Last night memories came back to him. Draco had fallen asleep without him noticing, hugging one of his pillows and babbling nonsenses. Harry could definitely have chosen to go to another room or to wake him, or levitate him, instead, to one of his guest’s chambers, but no, he had stayed there, starring at the sleeping man with a mixture of concern and amazement. He had never considered the day something like that could be happening, not in his wildest dreams. They had been enemies for seven years, they had done awful things to one another, they had insulted each other in every possible way, and yet, as soon as they had left the differences behind, they were trusting and caring for the other, they were sharing meals, and wine and moments. They were sleeping in the same bed, Harry’s bed, that was just crazy, it made absolutely no sense, but Harry couldn’t think of a single reason for not doing it all over again.
“That doesn’t work for me, little devil” she was Harry’s kryptonite, she could ask for a flying unicorn with purple hair and he would get it for her as long as she looked at him like that. Draco was the strict dad; someone had to.
“You saw her too, didn’t you?” he asked softly before coughing some more blood.
“Fine. Do you need me to do something specific?” the wizard shook his head “Go ahead then”
Alexander had casted the spell himself, declaring that, not always, was a third party needed. They had each sworn something: Alexander would help him; Harry would keep it secret. It was simple, and dangerous, for both of them since they barely knew each other but Harry had his priorities organized and if Alexander needed that in order to help him, he was more than willing to do it.
“What do you mean?” it was Harry who asked.
“Come on, Harry. You know there is more, a lot more. Don’t be so hard with yourself” he wanted to say something else, but couldn’t get the words out. Harry gave him a half smile that didn’t reach his eyes, but Draco had no idea how to fix that.
“I could get used to this, Potter. Remind me, why are you single?” he realized mid-sentence that he had just assumed Harry was single, but it was too late. And it was a way to find out, not particularly smooth, but a way nonetheless.
“How can you say something like that? I have only taken what I had to, I hope you realize it is my job, my sole purpose in this world” great, wonderful, just what he needed: Death was playing victim on him.
“Can I stay in bed some more?” Harry smiled and leaned to kiss him again.
He fell on his knees and screamed, he screamed until his throat couldn’t handle it anymore, he cried and cursed. He remembered Sirius disappearing through a very similar arc, he could see Draco falling on that one, alone. He wondered if he had gone back to his fifth year; prophecies, death’s veils, loosing someone dear and not being able to do anything about it.
The healer helped him down the stairs and Draco led him to the garden, where the table was set for two but with a ridiculously large amount of food on it.
He was not.
“Don’t you dare!” Harry blinked in shock.
He turned, looking at the hooded figure that was hovering on one side of the arc and he made up his mind. He smiled in gratitude and crossed right through the veil.
He had also been pretty insensitive in all his romantic or sexual relationships; he could not be seen as vulnerable. He was a Malfoy; he could not be hurt.
“Excuse me? Don’t shush me, what did you do to him?”
“Yes, I wanted to give her a heads up, but I’ll arrange that you two meet as soon as she’s available” he nodded and mentally cursed Blaise for being right. He had teased him about Harry being a nice catch and even when Draco had sent him as many deadly glares as he could, he agreed. But that was not the way to start courting someone. He might be too old for bars and random people, but he still had his ways to win guys over, and being possessed and ill and sleepy was not one on them.
He was finally home.
“Like shit. Mom!” she had smacked him in the healthy arm.
Draco heard a knock on the door and stood up softly. It couldn’t be Harry and there was no one else who would call to the brunet’s room so he took his wand out just in case.
“Speak for yourself” the blond said while leaving his cup on the coffee table.
“Please, go ahead. He should be expecting you”
“What? No. Why?”
“Yeah, nothing for me to solve” he had to laugh, or he could start crying from impotence at any moment.
“Draco!” he snapped out of himself and looked at Harry “Are you all right? I have been calling you for almost two minutes” he had no idea what Harry had just said. He managed to hand him the letter but that was it “I’m so sorry, babe. Do you want to go back? We can find another way to fix this from there or try to come here again somehow”
Twenty minutes later they were in the balcony, breakfast spread on the table. They talked about his father, her mother telling him how he kept blushing when she was there and how he had continued to court her with flowers and compliments. The doctors had nothing new to say, but she seemed content with her husband current state. It could be worse.
“Is everything ready for tonight?”
“Looking good, Gin” he made the girl twirl and they both laughed. Things between them hadn’t work, as Harry realized she was like a sister to him, he could just not see her in a sexual way, not even a romantic one for that matter, so they agreed to break up not long after the war. She even helped him acknowledge his interest for other men
“Welcome to the RUMMA, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy” she said in a stern voice “Shall we start the interview?” they nodded.
“Yes, they are authorizing us into Koldovstoretz” he said and handed Draco the paper. As soon as the man read the second line, a smug smile spread through his face.
“I don’t know exactly when it all started, I presume he kept it to himself until it was impossible to hide, but he has been perceptibly sick since the second half of last month. The marks appeared only a few days ago, after he went to a business meeting” she explained as Harry brushed his fingers over a particularly nasty-looking one. The next thing he knew; gray, sparkling eyes were looking right back at him.
“I am afraid Koldovstoretz’s Head Master is a private man, he allows no one on the school grounds if not for academic purposes. I could put a word for you if you offer something for the students”
He put on his trousers, but hesitated with the shirt, so he returned to the bedroom to recover his wand. On the bed was a thin, light blue sweater that couldn’t possible belong to Harry. He wouldn’t fit. So Draco took the liberty of assuming it was left for him and put it on, using his wand to fix only his hair, luckily without accidents.
“You called me babe last night” he said, obviously irritated. It took Harry a couple minutes to absorb and react to that information.
“Harry” he called and he opened his eyes.
“Bibly!”
He dressed Draco again after adjusting the bandages around his marks and stared at him. He looked so peaceful but he had been in so much pain just minutes ago.
Why was he going away?
“I will leave him to you, then. I know I’ll just be in the middle if I stay. If you need anything, call me. I’ll be downstairs” Harry thanked her for her comprehension and she left the room. Draco had stop shivering and was coming back to his senses now.
Harry took the sphere and held it close, immediately, a deep, velvety male voice started talking.
“Harry” he said. He had said something. He shouldn’t have.
Down.
“Mr. Potter, is a pleasure to see you again. Please, take a seat, and thank you for coming so quickly”
His head went to that dream again, while his fingers controlled almost automatically the chisel. It had felt so real, so familiar, and again so foreign, as if the drowning, the screaming and the dream itself were lived by different people. Maybe it was a side effect of the medicine Potter had given him, or maybe he needed to rest after all. One way or another, he decided he would take a break after finishing the decorations.
Harry did the same.
“Any pain or discomfort?” Potter asked while the vial was still in his arm.
“This is not how I planned on giving you this, but there you go” he offered the squared item to Draco whose eyes sparkled in excitement.
“What? No. Why would I?” Harry shrugged.
“Is this for me?” he asked taking it from Harry’s hands.
“So what? Children can’t die now? Not everyone has your luck, my dear” he was absolutely revolted “Anyway, I never got the fifth soul; the boy’s soul. He hid it from me knowing that if he came back then, he would be hunted and killed again. He extended our deal on his own and, believe me, I do not enjoy being tricked”
“I’m fine” he answered roughly but when his best-friend and wife sent him deadly glares he added “Thank you” Draco nodded, slightly amused, before asking the same to Hermione.
“I could have sworn you had a whole line of
He felt something around his wrist and then he was crashing against Harry’s chest. First, he was looking into his eyes, troubled and pained. He had expected anger or indifference since he was not even glimpsing his way, but not that; it was a sea of green torment and conflict. Then he felt Harry’s hand on his waist and finally their lips were touching. Draco’s breath got caught on his chest, but as soon as he realized what was happening he relaxed.
“Oh, you’ve got a tongue. I was starting to fear you had lost it to a cat”
“Draco! You look lovely, dear” Mrs. Weasley said as she squeezed his cheek like he was one of his godsons.
“That veil. I’m sure you know it puts you through a test, Harry, was it? Anyway, it took only a couple memories and a little chat with his lovely sister for young Alexei to choose the other side. I am sure it was something way much better for your friend here” he sounded almost sad about it.
“Some juice would be lovely, thank you, Draco” her voice was sweet, even if her eyes never left Potter’s annotations.
“Then what’s the matter?” he murmured again, but this time, when Harry asked him to repeat himself it was out of pleasure. He wanted to hear it again.
Draco had convinced Harry he would be fine with apparating since he would not use his own magic. It was even better than floo network since he could end up somewhere else and could have trouble coming back. Harry seemed to feel familiar with the situation and he agreed to side-along Draco.
“Draco? Are you okay?” it was Harry’s voice but he could not see him. Was that his hand on his hair? Draco had never liked when people touched his hair, only his mother. But he realized he wouldn’t complain if it was Harry; it felt so natural, so gentle.
Not again, please.
Harry knew Draco was having fun, he had been sentenced to bed time for months now and this was the first time he had the chance to explore and walk freely. Harry was just happy he could make his boyfriend smile that way. They had kissed and hugged and held hands as much as they had wanted to. A young girl had even told them they looked absolutely cute together, which had made Draco thank her with a smug smile.
“You better. I’ll have Bibly checking on you” she stood up “Take care, little dragon” and with that she apparated leaving him secretly dizzy.
Harry opened the door and found himself in a dark, damp place with stone walls and floor; the trace of dittany was gone, but he knew he was in the right place. Magic just seemed to work differently there.
“Yeah, that’s how it looks, but trust me, soul’s issues are not simple, specially when I’m involved”
“There” it said lightly, like it was nothing. Like it meant nothing. Like it wasn’t destroying Harry’s heart.
“You know I haven’t skipped the last ones on purpose, don’t you?” he replied, concerned at his best friend’s tone.
Someway, somehow they end up kissing like mads, Harry on top of Draco, holding his weight on his stretched arms, barely touching the blond who kept trying to get more contact.
“You’re very welcome” she stood up and started to move to the garden door “and Harry” the man looked at her, he was still holding Draco who was going limp between his arms “take care of him” and with that, she was gone.
“You were shaking and you stopped when I held you, I’m sorry if it bothered you” there was something he was not telling him, he had some foggy memories that felt out of place, but Draco would worry about it eventually, right now he was more concerned about spending the night hugged to Potter.
They left the RUMMA and made the way to the hotel in less than fifteen minutes even when they refused to apparate; well, Harry did. Draco had just avoided the discussion and agreed with him.
The first thing he did, after pushing Harry off the bed, was wrap himself with the sheets, finding little cover in the half-undone bath robe Draco had been using.
“It’s a different culture, prince. Although, a heads up would have been nice” Harry would probably kick Ellias’ ass.
“Shut up and come back here” he said, craving for Harry’s lips one more time. The brunet obliged and kissed him, his hands everywhere in Draco’s body. He moved his mouth to his jaw, his neck, his collarbone, his chest, entertaining himself for a while with one of his nipples, making Draco release the obscenest sounds. He continued lowering, scratching the blonde’s skin with his beard while his hand stayed back to torture his other button. Draco supported his body on his elbows and stared down at Harry, watching as his length disappeared between the brunet’s lips a couple times before he stopped to suck the sensitive gland, making Draco’s legs shake a bit; but Harry ditched the care of his member too soon and kept moving down, liking the skin under his testicles.
Suddenly, a pure white light projected from Draco’s chest and a small bluish ball formed between the two wizards; streams of light surrounding it. He had seen that before, when he and Sirius had been attacked by the Dementors in the forest and his godfather’s soul had left his body for a brief instant. He knew that he was looking at Malfoy’s soul. The ball was not a perfect sphere though, it had a darker protuberance, moving around like an orbiting moon. It was smaller and had no presence, except for the physical deformation it caused. Harry had his answers already, but his magic was not satisfied and it reached for the lump.
Finally, he stood up. He rejected Harry’s hand, but followed him to the bed where he sat. Harry took the chair from the desk and sat in front of him. Since Draco was shirtless, the dark-haired wizard was able to catch a glimpse of the bruising that was starting to form in his lower back. The blood hadn’t stopped flowing from his palm, but Harry wouldn’t risk doing magic in front of the already scared Alexei, so he just grabbed a cloth from his case and passed it over to the other who took it reluctantly and pressed it to the cut.
“Sirius Black took his choice, my dear”
“Harry! You are back!” they stayed hugged to each other until Harry stood up and the boy moved to pick the puppy up again.
They had set the table out in the garden in order to have enough space, since Draco’s house was not particularly big. The kids were playing around, driving Rolf crazy, George was talking to Pansy, who had arrived a couple minutes ago, right from work, claiming that Blaise wouldn’t make it since he was in a meeting with a foreign investor; his mother was chatting with Fleur and Ronald while Bill had gotten himself into a conversation about economics with Draco’s father, who seemed more than pleased of being able to display his knowledge. Molly had insisted in helping Harry with the last details of their lunch and Draco had found asylum with Luna and Hermione, who were talking about baby stuff.
He continued trying on doors and corridors with little luck. A first year girl that was stepping out of the kitchen asked him if he needed any help but he didn’t answer. Did he? No, he didn’t.
When they finished, he picked up the dishes and gave them to Kreacher, before the elf could murder him with his glares, and moved to the fridge taking out the strawberries and the can of whipped cream. He made his way back next to Draco, but instead of sitting down he rested his back on the counter, half-facing the blond.
Draco sat up instantly and covered his mouth with his hand. It was impossible that Potter hadn’t felt his heartrate. His chest was going to explode, and he had no idea why he felt so nervous. He had slept with Harry by chance, it had not been on purpose and he had definitely, undoubtedly, absolutely, not liked waking up in his arms…again.
“She’s fine. We left her at my mom’s before coming since she gets dizzy during long trips”
“Ana, it is not funny. I can’t look in there” he said, tapping his foot in irritation. She was always the most problematic one. Anastasia popped her smiling face from under her mother’s dress. Her wild, red hair was a mess and the white ribbons were falling from their place. She crawled until she could stand and undusted her dress before smiling widely at him. He gave up “Come on” he said, offering his hand “You win”
“Do you need anything?” Draco didn’t answer, but somehow Harry seemed to understand his silence “Do you want to talk about it?”
Once they were all closed, and the potions had made their work stopping the bleeding, Harry focused on the chills and the fever. Draco was sweating non-stop and his body was shaking. Harry had taken measures for the infection and temperature, but it would take a while.
“Oh, I don’t know, Draco. Because he is your friend? Because he just wants to help? Because he is a sweet man that would not see you only as his patient? I was as shocked as you are, but you need to calm down. I tried hard, but he was honest and insistent about not taking it and I can’t do anything against that”
“Draco, dear, can you show me the rest of the place? I want to see how much it has changed” he nodded and guided his mother all around the house. He knew the distribution, every hidden corner, every detail Harry had added or removed, everything.
As soon as he entered the darkness swallowed him and every light he could possibly bring with him as the wind turned off the candle. He knew there was no point on trying to lit it again so he dropped it and started walking blindly, trusting his newly discovered instincts.
“Ms. Cissy, is that you?”
“So, are you saying I’m going to die from Salazar knows what? I think I prefer the other healers, at least I make it to my twenty-ninth birthday in their opinion” he tried to stood up from the bed, probably to get dressed, but instead, he started hissing while holding his knee. Harry checked it silently and gave Draco a potion for the pain.
“Of course I do” he was crying. He was officially crying. And Harry was smiling, like the happy idiot he was. Harry stood up and kissed him. He kissed every insecurity, every bad memory, every sorrow out of Draco “I want babies, Potter” he blurted after they pulled away “Lots and lots of babies” he was still crying. Harry looked taken aback for a brief second, enough to make Draco worry, but he melted again into happiness when Harry’s smile widened even more, before kissing him again.
“She died” he put one hand on his heart and pretended to dry an inexistent tear with the other “I did my best, but she…she is gone” Harry rolled his eyes at the over-dramatic scene, but couldn’t help a smile.
“Ah, Miss Granger, so nice to see you again. I’m sorry you had to come through my son’s studio, but I have been unable to convince him about getting a chimney in the house”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was pacing around the living room, muttering something to himself that neither Draco or Hermione could hear. The witch was sipping her tea and trying a cookie, her eyes closed in utmost relaxation while the blonde’s leg moved unstoppably. How could she stay so calm when her best friend looked like he was about to murder someone?
, a Russian demon that made its victims suffer the loss of hope and devoured them. It was way much smaller than the representation of the statue, but it still made him wonder why would someone put that in the entry of the ministry. Aside from that, the building was impressive: marble floors with different patterns, golden and ochre decorations everywhere, the ceiling had moving paintings of different passages of the Russian wizarding history and the main hall was crowned by a golden dome. There were carpets covering every set of stairs and the steps moved like the muggle mechanical stairs Harry had seen on the stations.
“Do you know Russian?” he was going to answer but shut his mouth “I thought so. Well you said something in Russian, you said you were not Draco, or at least I think you did”
“Harry! Oh dear, it’s been ages!” Molly was strangling him, but Harry didn’t care “Look at you, have you been eating at all? You are too thin” he was not, not a bit. He had actually never looked better; he wasn’t particularly built but he had been training and he felt amazing with his body. But, again, to Molly Weasley everyone was undernourished.
Once there, Alexander moved straight towards a particular stand and grabbed a thin, dusty notebook that he handed to Harry.
“That would be terrible indeed” he continued kissing him and stroking his cheek.
Harry came into the living room to say hello while Draco avoided running kids to get to the door after the bell ringed.
He was nervous. He felt sick and tired. The room was twirling, but he had to see if it had worked. It had to.
“Yes” Draco looked at him for some time before his expression turned irritated.
He moved his head to both sides.
“I ruined it, didn’t I?” he asked. His voice was rough and Harry moved to hand him a glass of water.
He went to the kitchen himself instead of asking an elf. He knew better than to provoke the witch, no matter how good he treated the creatures. He found a couple oranges and squeezed them while brewing some coffee and adding some cream to it, no sugar.
“Did you happen to remember anything else related to Rasputin?” Alexei shrugged.
“You just asked Harry, didn’t you?”
“Of course he knew, he was the one who gave Ginny his diary back in our second year”
“Good. Hold on, we’ll be there in no time” Draco didn’t know where to hold on, but as soon as the vehicle started to move he let out an undignified squeak and hold onto Harry’s torso for his life.
“Me too. Your soul is really pretty, though” he teased.
“Is that a phone?” he asked his mother from the stairs where he was trying to get down, already sick of being locked up in his room.
“Long story. Just take us to the castle, discreetly, please” the man was obviously not convinced but nodded anyway.
“I’m going to get him” the next thing Harry heard made his blood freeze.
“I mean, Pansy asked me a couple times when she was still interested in me, but no one I had really liked has actually asked. It was kind of implied, I don’t know, it just feels like the first time” Draco blushed and it made Harry melt.
“Morning” he said in the same husky voice that had greeted him yesterday.
“Draco Malfoy. A pleasure, Healer Potter” he joked and Harry rolled his eyes.
“Great, I think there is a whole section about family trees in the back. I’ll get them, make yourself comfortable” Draco nodded and Harry disappeared between the shelves.
“That’s absurd. Grigori Rasputin is dead, thanks heavens. The poor man was completely mental” Harry was in shock. How could someone pretend so well? He knew the truth and even him was tempted to believe him.
He made his way to the cellar and picked a basket from the entrance, just like a supermarket. He went through the meat section and picked a juicy piece of beef before moving to take a bunch of mushrooms, eggs, potatoes and pastry. He got a couple bottles of red wine, spices and some more stuff before going back to the kitchen. He rolled up his sleeves and spread the ingredients. The cigarette was still in his mouth, almost fully consumed, so he vanished it and began to work.
“I can’t lose you, prince. I can’t take that risk” he whispered, resting his forehead against Draco’s.
Hello!!! So, chapter 8 is up and I just wanted to make a little comment. The end of the chapter means I am not Draco, I meant to write it in Cyrillic but I couldn’t find a comfortable way to do it so it's basically the pronunciation in Russian.
“I didn’t know you smoked” the blond said, sitting across from him in the frame. He hadn’t heard him coming in, but he was not surprised to see him there.
A tattoo-like mark surrounded his neck like a collar, except it did not fuse in the middle, instead, both ends fell down in thick lines until they reached the center of his sternum. Right between his heart and magical core.
“Well, as we told you, it’s probable that a muggle soul is affecting yours”
“I will tell you, but please, if your conclusion is going to be along the line that I’m mental, save it”
Why was he frowning?
“I’m sorry to bother you, Kreacher, but I can’t seem to find Harry. Do you happen to know where he could be?” he asked crouching next to the elf and regretting it after he felt a stabbing pain on his back.
“Entertainment” Draco puckered his nose.
“Kitchen” he called and a second later the blond popped into the place.
“I think is better if I go, I have to get to work anyway. If you need me…”
He kept looking. Tatiana was the laziest one, she would be close to the fountain, probably behind the rose bushes. He went to get her but he saw Maria first, sneaking from the back of the lion shaped water-sprinkler.
He made a couple diagnostic spells and decided he could give Draco the medicine without danger since he was apparently stable. His vitals were fine; the damage was not physical. He would check his soul when he recovered a little, but for now he tended to him as he had done at the beginning.
“Thanks, Kreacher” taking off his coat before hanging it besides his lime healer ropes, he made his way to the kitchen. As always, a large cup of coffee was waiting for him and the house-elf had prepared a full English breakfast. He started with the eggs, while checking the pile of letters, until a particular one grabbed his attention.
Every last bit of him had fallen for Potter and he had done nothing about it. On the contrary, he had jump to the void, blindfolded and with a smile.
And he was not dreaming.
It had worked.
Not again.
“You’re right. I’m sorry” the boy looked at him for a moment before nodding “We are in Moscow; we came here to find a way to help you” Alexei seemed surprised for a moment, but the next one he was running towards the window and pulling the curtains open.
“Yes, we can try that for today and I can take us to a muggle bookshop tomorrow”
written in it. Draco squeaked exited when he understood the meaning: Hermione’s baby was going to be a boy. But his joy was short when he realized the coin had come from the envelope, the open envelope.
Forty minutes later, he heard footsteps going quickly down the stairs.
“Smells good. What are you making for us?” she left a bag of cookies over the table before kissing his cheek; she always brought cookies and he loved them.
“Lovely. Well, then you must know that everything about humans is born around the soul; body, mind, personality, magic. I just tampered with Alexei’s to make him a boy. Poor thing ended up being a sick child but that happened to be helpful eventually so, double win” he grinned.
“I haven’t been here in ages” Narcissa exclaimed as she entered the receiving hall of the house “It has changed a lot, but I can still feel the old magic” she was running her hand over the couch’s surface feeling the soft velvet stroking her palm.
“He is in cardiac arrest, bring the epinephrine. Starting compressions” he enjoyed his life as a doctor as much as being a healer. Ron had turned red when he told him his plans, probably remembering how he had described doctors (muggle nutters that cut people open) back in their fifth year, but had supported his decision, as always. Hermione on the other side, was thrilled that, in her words, he was doing something safe and intelligent for the first time in his entire life. It had taken a lot of study, so many sleepless nights, and way too much caffeine, but ten years later he was happy and proud of himself.
“No problem, darling. I’m always prepared for every scenario”
“I can’t assure you I will heal you, but I’ll give my best, if you want me to” who was this man and what had he done with Potter? For the first time since he woke up Draco stopped to detail the person in front of him.
How could he?
“Please, come in, he is asleep right now but if you need it I will wake him” Harry entered the room, his eyes falling immediately in the black dressed bed and the man in it.
“Good afternoon, gentleman” Minister Shacklebolt was there to receive them instead of the Head Auror, a knowing smile on his face “Quite a trip, uh?” Draco rolled his eyes and Harry smiled.
He didn’t know if he should ask the wizard later about it. It might be too personal. But he would deal with it later, now he could not distract his healer.
“I got you some coffee” Draco said and handed him a cup filled with the black substance he enjoyed so much. He didn’t need to ask if he had put sugar or not; he was certain Draco knew how he liked it.
Harry thanked the witch and took the occasion to explain her son’s situation. He left aside the possession bit, since it was a much more delicate matter, but he gave the woman detailed information of everything else, assuring her that he was out of danger, but would need some time to recover.
Thanks for the support!!
“We are going Indian today, I got some curry in the market this morning and though you would like it”
“Go away, Potter” he threw up again.
“Hi, I’m Teddy Lupin. It’s nice to meet you” he said politely. Draco was panicking. He had never met the kid and he was his relative. Wasn’t that wrong? He looked at Harry and the brunet nodded, encouragingly.
“No. This is a terrible idea, the worst one we have had so far, but we have to do it” he answered while struggling with his tie. He had never had problems knotting it but he was very nervous.
“Why am I here?” he repeated the prior question, while wrapping himself with a blanket, and Harry cursed in his mind, that was one he could not answer.
“Lay down and give me your arm. It would be better if you take off your shirt” Potter sat in the edge on the bed and started pulling things from his briefcase: cotton balls, a bottle full of a clear fluid, an elastic string…
“Really? Do you think he will agree?”
“Do I want to know about this now?” Draco asked looking worriedly at his healer.
“Hey” Draco called before he left the room “You never told me the name” he seemed to think about what he meant before answering.
There was no answer at first, but a minute after, the door opened and a guilty-looking Potter was staring back at him, his lower lip trapped between his teeth.
“You looked tired, sweetheart. I know you have been overworking again”
“Voldemort could decide what to do with me. He could control our connection at will, even when he had no idea it was because of his soul fragment. You had to be unconscious for it to take over your body and, as I told you then, it didn’t seem to me as if he was trying to possess you”
“So, how do we do this?” Draco was sat in his bed, legs crossed under him and his hands gripping the cyan sheets tightly.
On their way back to their room, Draco stole the coin from him and ran in a very un-Malfoy way along the hall to beat him to the suit, but he was not going down that easy. He ran after and catch him when he was about to get in, grabbing the blond and carrying him inside while Draco laughed and demanded to be left back on the floor. Harry threw him as delicately as possible on the bed and crawled over him to kiss off his laughter.
He gave him a dose of
“We need to watch him for the next hours, but the bleeding has stopped. If this had happened when he wasn’t being treated it could have been so much worse. I will stay here, since there is no point in sending him to St. Mungo” she nodded and he grabbed a bandage from his case to secure the stitches. They had already cleaned the sheets and it was a less disturbing sight.
“This is Vicky” he said showing Draco the little Golden retriever puppy “Victoire is mad at me for naming her like that, but she is always mad at me anyway” Draco laughed and Harry smiled.
There was nothing significant in the drawing, the scheme ended with Alix de Hesse-Darmstadt, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria (who had an extensive chapter, due to her magical condition), next to her husband Nikolai II Romanov. At the bottom of the page was a note that mentioned they had five children: Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alexei, none of them had born with magic.
“Either is good, Mrs. Malfoy, but I’ll be delighted if you call me just Harry” he heard Draco snorting behind him but decided to ignore it.
is a damn question” Harry felt bad. He wasn’t supposed to get angry with the boy. He passed a hand through his hair again and moved to a chair to pick up his trousers and put them on. He sat on that same chair and inhaled, trying to win back some patience.
He had found himself thinking about the boy more than once. He knew he was happy now, he was with his family again, but he had gone through so much, and Draco couldn’t even comfort himself since the guilty was still free. Alexander had written to them two weeks after their return to notify them that Rasputin had managed to escape the castle. They had caught him and kept him there to avoid uncomfortable explanations, but he had gone away somehow. They were sending search parties to the Siberia in case he went to look for his remaining family but still he had warned them to be careful; he doubted he would go after them but the chance was there.
They were question about their motives to visit Russia and Koldovstoretz, whish where actually hard to explain. Draco managed to convince her it was a heath issue neither of them knew a lot about; technically truth.
“I think I’m better, but I could use a new body” Harry rolled his eyes even when he was smiling.
“Why would Harry have a room full of…” she stopped, midsentence, her gaze fixed in one place. Draco fallowed it and found his father, dead. She screamed and when he looked at her, startled, she was pointing her wand toward a different place, where Draco’s own body was laying, also dead “
“That depends, sir. Master is on vacation so he is not at work and he has not taken new patients since Ms. Cissy wrote to him. He could be working on his studio, but the lights are off. Mrs. Granger – Weasley just left and Mr. Weasley is working today. If he is sad he could be in Master Sirius room, if he is stressed he might be flying his broom and if he is upset he could be on the rooftop or the kitchen, but Kreacher did not see him in the kitchen, sir” that was actually really detailed, and Draco felt suddenly conscious of how much these creatures knew about their masters. He wondered if Bibly could answer like that about him or his mother.
“I’ve seen everything” Draco murmured, not quite out of his astonishment yet “If you are any good I’ll make myself an official member of your fan club” Harry swallowed the need of telling him that it actually existed, just because his disdain for such organization was bigger than his need to tease the Slytherin.
Actually, genuinely, laughing.
“No” the answer came quickly and it made Draco blush, but Harry made no comments about it “You haven’t told me the rest of your theory”
He was not happy, not at all. That was not his Harry. He had to go back home.
“Draco Malfoy is a former Death Eater” he said with a patronizing tone “His name has been cleaned, but any kind of Dark Art is forbidden if he wants to stay out of prison. He talks, we talk. None of us has proofs against the other, but it would not be a pleasant situation” Shestakov smirked content and Harry rolled his eyes “Now. I think you should focus on the task at hand. Our mysterious guest seems to have disappeared” all eyes turned to where Rasputin was supposed to be. He was gone “I recommend you give your best to find him and leave these young men to me. I will make sure everything goes smoothly”
“Then, what’s the point of this movie thing?”
“In deed”
“You’ll find he’s a little bit overprotective. Let him be, he is a reasonable man, unlike my husband” she said standing to leave.
At first he had not felt anything alien. He was sad and overwhelmed but those were his own emotions and thoughts; until he started hearing Alexei’s voice screaming inside his head, his lungs had felt like they were burning, his sight had gone blurry and all he could feel was the kid’s anguish, his desperation, his sorrow and the sound of his crying voice bouncing everywhere in his head. He had felt a flash of pain on his arms and then the rest of his body, but that was nothing compared to the sensation of having his mind and heart being ripped in a million little pieces.
Harry had stood up, looked at him as if he was processing the words and he had finally burst. A vase broke and Draco felt Harry’s magic trembling in the air. He had panicked for a second, thinking that it could trigger Alexei and he wasn’t sure he would handle that very well. The brunet left the room and Draco didn’t see him until the next day, when he found a navy blue sweater on the bed after his shower and headed to breakfast, finding Hermione there. We know the rest.
“The letters were open; they are spying on us” he elaborated without opening his eyes yet.
“Would you like something to drink…Weasley?” maybe he had been able to leave his inner child behind relatively easy with Harry-Charming Healer-Potter, but he had to do a serious effort not to call the other Gryffindor anything but his last name.
They spent the rest of the meal in silence, well, except for Draco’s pleased sounds. One would have thought pure-blood etiquette had something to say about getting a culinary boner over a steak, but Harry was not complaining. This was something that, he could bet, Draco didn’t show everyone, so he was flattered, and horny, but mostly flattered.
Draco knew something was off with him, since late July he wasn’t feeling like himself. The pure air of the French fields was polluted to his breath and the sight of his own face in the mirror had become something rare, unknown. He couldn’t say precisely when it had started, but the feeling was growing, the feeling of someone else sleeping in his bed, having his dreams, taking his afternoon tea with his mother, someone entirely different and at the same time, surprisingly familiar.
“Of course. Come in. The Weasleys are already arriving” by the time Draco returned to the living room, Molly and Arthur were already there, the woman hugging the air out of his boyfriend while Andromeda tried to contain Teddy from fighting with Victoire.
His mother was dead, in that damn chair. And his father, he had been the first one.
“Sorry but, could you be more specific? I don’t think I get what you’re asking since there is no physical disease that would cause something like that, but there are several brain alterations that could and for wizards there is also soul damage to be considered” Draco wanted to be offended for the brain comment but he was divided, instead, between the fact that he knew Potter didn’t mean what the others did and curiosity about the last part of his explanation.
“Where are we?” he asked. And that did call Harry’s attention.
They reentered the room through which they had come the first time and as soon as Alexander closed the door and whispered a few words they were inside the transportation chamber of the castle.
“Thanks” Harry took the coin and started to walk towards the bar to find Ellias. Draco thought he saw a familiar face, but had no time to acknowledge it “Are you mad I picked a room for two?” he asked suddenly, interrupting Draco’s thoughts.
He got up the bed slowly, knowing that, otherwise, he would fall right into the parquet, and made his way to the bathroom. Maybe because he didn’t look at the mirror, or perhaps because he was still feeling dizzy, Draco missed the hand shaped bruising in his shoulder until he came out of the shower. He didn’t have that in the morning, for sure, and it was a really strange place to have that mark. Touching it was not a good idea, as he discovered after hissing in pain when his fingers moved over it; he ran his eyes through his reflection looking for another new alteration in his skin, but that was the only one. The black circles under his eyes were not different than usual, maybe a bit darker, but nothing he wasn’t used to, after all, he had more bad nights than good ones; or it could possibly be the contrast against his face, paler, even for him.
“Well, essentially, I thought we could use some kind of booster. Something that would give the muggle soul enough power to manifest without you being weakened or damaged. I will draw some runes around the place I think I found your soul and it should do the work. But this is really old healing magic and was poorly documented so I had to improvise and adjust the runes by myself” Draco was confused, but that was nothing new these days.
“One minutes to go, gentlemen. An agent will receive you if I was correctly informed. Have a nice trip” he sat in his chair and started to write something just when Harry took Draco’s free hand and felt the pull from the watch.
They talked about Luna’s research, the twins, her father, Rolf, about Harry’s work, Neville, Teddy, and anything that came to their minds. The girl was telling him something about the Quibbler’s new photographer when his wand started releasing red sparkles. That was the alert for an emergency so he quickly checked his card where Draco’s name was glowing.
Draco had protested the second time one of the felines jumped on his shoulder, but he looked completely okay with being on the floor of the children’s area, surrounded by the young of both species, a cat on his hair and a small girl showing him her dolls. That was something you didn’t see every day and Harry managed to take a photo on his cellphone. Not the best quality, but something to remember.
He had no time to think more about it since the other wizard pulled away softly and looked at him with fear all over his features.
Draco turned around and made his way to the bathroom. He needed a bath, urgently, and now that his wound was looking better he could risk it. He opened the water tap and started undressing carefully. The stitches were still there, but it was less tender and had deflated a bit. The ointment Potter had used had been worth the arousal, apparently.
“You are evil, Harry Potter. You have a dark soul and you keep making the world believe you are a hero”
“I think this is a perfect moment to elaborate this plan of yours, Potter” he was unbuttoning his shirt already.
“Clever man” Rasputin said with the same horrible grin he had worn before “I guess you were my vessel, am I right?”
“And muggle raised” this time he couldn’t control the giggle; Draco looked absolutely shocked.
Feeling already better he went back to bed and picked the first letter. It was from Granger to Harry so he left it and went to the next one. But before he could read the name on the envelope he felt something drop on the sheets. It was a small, red coin with the world
“What are you doing here, Harry? How did you know how to find this place?”
“I should have offered you a room last night, silly me”
Everything twirled around him, he felt his limbs stretch and his head spin and then his feet fell hard on the wet floor. Draco tripped beside him but managed to balance himself and pretend nothing happened.
“Oh? Are you agreeing with me? Does that mean I was right about hiring him?” he rolled his eyes. She loved to be right and, unfortunately, she usually was.
Narcissa returned when the healer was making another round of spells.
Harry worked on the runes for another couple minutes and Draco found himself entertained enough with his thought so it was not that awkward. When he was done, he moved to let his patient look at his reflection in the mirror.
“I’m glad you did, pup, you know I like us to talk about everything” Teddy nodded, still hidden in his neck as he made his way to the candy shop.
Salazar, he smelled so good.
“Why him?!” he wanted answers. His boyfriend was gone, he couldn’t care less for Death’s feelings, he needed a reason and he needed it now.
“How can you joke when I’m telling you you were someone else just a few hours ago?” the blond shrugged.
“No problem. I would even tell Lockhart if I thought he would be of any help”
“I read somewhere that he was a seer” Alexander seemed surprised to hear that “You didn’t know about that?”
They landed in Robard’s office two days later since it had taken a bit of time to arrange the documentation for them to come back. The old sock they had been given by Ms. Volkova was still in Harry’s hand; Draco had let it go as soon as he had felt solid ground under his feet.
“Are you feeling better?” he nodded, but then looked at Harry.
No, he was not.
“I don’t know if it’s good idea” he was concerned, and he was making it clear.
“Draco?” the blond had fell limp. He had stopped talking “Draco, are you ok?” Harry shook him slightly but he didn’t wake up. After a couple spells, he decided the wizard was just exhausted from the blood lost and after giving him a Dreamless Sleep potion he sat back in a chair to watch him rest.
“Good to see you, Harry”
“Thanks, I need to shower to go to St. Mungo, what did you need?”
He would rather never get used to the sight of Draco crying like that. He kept telling himself it was Alexei, but it was still hard to look at. There was so much pain in his eyes, in his voice. He also tried not to think about the injuries in his body, he would take care of them later, but the thought of Alexei not feeling them…he could hurt Draco so much without noticing. Maybe this link was not such a good idea after all. He was putting his patient at risk and so far it was not worth it.
He had Harry to thank for that and, in a very twisted way, Alexei.
He was safe.
“I don’t care. I renounce to the hallows. I have to go and get him. I can’t lose him too”
“It looks different” Alexei said, his eyes watery and gloomy.
“You’ll have to excuse me, I’m…I’m not feeling very well” he was pale and breathing with difficulty so Harry stood up and held him while doing the basic spells. He was physically fine, but it had been too much to handle. Harry casted a calming spell and Draco relaxed in his arms.
“You are not, so I won’t say it. You can trust me, Draco” the worst part was, he believed he actually could.
“Is that even possible?”
“I was thinking that that guy” he pointed the screen, where an image of the man was casually frozen “has the perfect eye color. The same one a baby from both of us should have” he whispered the last bit, suddenly conscious of what he was saying. They had been fooling around for less than a week and he was already thinking about their child’s eyes. Draco was not rushing anything or expecting anything, he was determined to go with the flow, but his subconscious had betrayed him, his silent worries had finally come out “Should we name this?” he asked not looking at Harry.
Harry vanished the shirt and trousers and started working. Draco had nine wounds, two of them really nasty, so he focused on those first. Getting the splinter out of his thigh, Harry cleaned the spot and stitched it magically at the same time he injected a bunch of potions straight in his bloodstream; blood replenishing, calming draught, wound-cleaning potion and the special medicine he had made. Collarbone was next. He repeated the same procedure, removed the splinter and closed the wound, and then moved to the smaller ones. The thigh was the worst one, since he had lost a lot of blood from it, and the clavicle was too close to the neck, and could have been fatal. The others were distributed in his abdomen and limbs, but were considerably shallower.
He got downstairs just in time to see the fireplace his mother had installed in his absence, flash, letting Granger, and her huge belly inside.
“I can’t risk you. You are the only human in this rotten world that can be by my side. You are my master”
Draco focused the attention in his eyes. Those were his eyes, silvery, cold…. weren’t they?
Now, the blonde’s hair was tickling his nose and he moved his hand to stroke it. He went from there to his cheek, his lips, his neck, his arm and up again. Draco’s skin was the softest thing his fingers had ever touched.
He tried again, thinking that nothing in the bathroom could hurt him. A water column rose and started moving, but Draco’s eyes caught a glimpse of the mirror and it dropped back into the tub. Wood had been awful, but glass…
Inhale… He was fine, he was not alone, he had help, he was going to get out of this.
His mother was there, pushing her husband’s wheelchair.
“I beg your pardon?”
He returned to the living room where the two friends were still brainstorming away from a grumpy Weasley. He handed the juice to the witch and smiled when Harry thanked him for the coffee.
“I have a question” Harry nodded “Why didn’t I feel something if my soul was being affected or whatever? You said you grew used to it since it happened when you were a baby, but I think I should have been able to notice it”
It was the first official reunion of their friends and families all together. Draco had met the Weasley family a couple times already those past four months and Harry was already an honorific member of the Malfoy family, but they had never met all in one place. They needed the kids there to avoid crossfire. Just in case.
The look in Malfoy’s eyes made it obvious he had misunderstood the question, so Harry corrected himself “I mean lately, and I mean really dark magic” the blond took a second to answer but, eventually, his expression softened and he let out a sigh.
Harry finished the torture and gave him his medicine before going to his room to, presumably, get ready for his reunion with Granger. With the same messy hair, but less wrinkles in the shirt, he returned.
“He was destroyed. He lost it, Harry” he explained “I think he still had hope that we were wrong and his family was somewhere out here, waiting for him” he closed his hand on a fist and buried his face in his boyfriend’s chest who had gotten into bed with him when he had started the story. “Seeing the memorial was too much. I think he is traumatized for good now”
