Bloodthirsty journalists and paparazzi followed his every move, criticised every word he spoke, and believed themselves entitled to his every thought, just because he had the audacity to step up to the plate when no competent adult felt brave enough. Harry hadn’t left his home (if you could even call Grimmauld Place a
But then there had been that kiss on Friday night, and Harry knew that if Draco hadn’t caught him so much by surprise then there was the possibility that he might have reciprocated on instinct. But this was
Still with his fingers circling Potter’s wrist, Draco glanced back down at the tattoo to inspect it’s healing some more. He didn’t need to, of course, and he wasn’t too sure
Harry ran his fingers through his hair and reached down to scratch the back of his neck, his classic move for when he was feeling nervous or uncomfortable, or when Hermione asked him why he hadn’t finished his homework yet. Of course, she hadn’t needed to ask him
Potter looked utterly confused as to why his mother would want him there, and Draco couldn’t find it within himself to sneer at his complete Gryffindor idiocy; he’d be confused too if it was the other way around. However, there also seemed to be a hint of… what was that? Disappointment? What could the great Chosen One possibly have to be disappointed about with this? The fact that he had not caused Draco’s misery directly?
‘- Well, we had yesterday’s at Grimmauld because I had to watch Teddy too, right? It was just easier to do it there, only then he stayed and watched Aladdin with me and Ted afterwards, Ted wouldn’t just let him leave, you see? So we watched the film, and that finished, and I put Teddy to bed, but Malfoy was still there. He was just sat on my sofa watching the title sequence of bloody Aladdin going round and round, and he looked a bit miserable so I asked if he wanted a fire whiskey with me and-’
Grey eyes snapping back up to the figure frozen outside the shop, Draco cursed when he spotted that the figure was gone. Presumably strolling along on his merry way to whichever Merlin-forsaken establishment took his fancy.
go against Hermione in an argument, but for the sake of bearing witness to another domestic between the two, he intervened.
Harry blinked at her. ‘By young men, you mean me and Malfoy, don’t you.’ It was not a question, nor did Andromeda treat it as one.
Draco turned back to look at Patch and found him smirking. A signature Malfoy smirk that he had obviously copied from Draco. He scowled.
‘Are you allowed to just sit down and join your favourite customers like this?’ Harry asked incredulously, a smile in his voice.
Harry felt like all the air had vanished from his lungs for the second time that day. As much as Ron had already reassured him that Draco had been nowhere near what had happened and whoever had been attacked, Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to believe it until he saw Draco for himself.
‘Have you given it all up yet? We miss you at Hogwarts, mate, it’s not the same without you. Anyone will agree. Come on, surely you can see that you’re hating every second of this bloody Auror training?’
‘Have you- damn. Out of ink. Hang on.’ He reached across his desk for his extra bottles of ink. It made his sleeve ride up a fraction, but Harry was fairly certain his brand new tattoo would remain hidden. ‘Okay… have you taken any illegal potions?’
"Okay, okay." Defeated and with the shooing of Falk and Cas he stumbles his way through the crowd towards the other end of the dance floor where some scrutinizing, bright blue eyes await him.
"Sure," he says, fetching a tray with hot water, cups and various teas from the kitchen. Ron has also joined them at the table on his return.
"More spitefulness. If I'm honest, I expected Rita Skeeter to appear in front of me at any moment. Or at least a bit of latent blackmail. It's not every day youre being served with such a terrific lever in your hand."
"I really don’t get, why you're not looking for a relationship, Harry", Falk shakes his head, "Wouldn't it be much nicer to have a regular fuck buddy who also actually cares for you and who you can celebrate those moments with? I mean, not that I object of being your current preferred choice of company."
Though their bodily connection finally lifts some of this build up pressure, there is still a tangible tension in the air that calls for more. Harry’s hands find their way into blond, disheveled hair, that once was neatly tied to a bun but has long ago dissolved to a formless blob of messy strands. The bearer of the hairstyle doesn’t seem to mind. He rather pushes Harry backwards, arms on each side, practically locking him between the kitchen counter and himself, all while gradually deepening their kiss in a voracious manner.
"Fuck", is the immediate answer and a very fast bright blond flash slams the door close from inside the bath.
"Oh, I'm sure, their bewilderment by an affair can escalate to unimagined dimensions when it happens to be with a man."
A defiant reaction rose up in him immediately. What is that supposed to mean? Of course, he means it. How much effort does this guy think it took him to send the letter? He almost destroyed the note in his fireplace and swore he would never think about Drew again, but a few angry stomps through his room and the subsiding of the first emotional wave later, his defiance was joined by joy and understanding. Harry, admittedly, had not been particularly consistent up to this point in expressing interest in further contact. He himself would have been the first to approach the whole thing with suspicion. Nevertheless, it cost him a great deal of pride-swallowing to compose a second message affirming his serious intentions.
“Sorry”, Drew breaks away and laughs abashed. “I shouldn’t have. This was non-consensual.” He steps back, face marked by remorse, biting his lower lip.
MILD SPOILER: As mentioined in the tags I give a mild spoiler here. If not obvious at that point, the OC/Drew is supposed to be Draco. It will be revealed at some point of course and before that hinted during various occasions, but if youre a heavy Drarry-Digger and can't bear the Drarry Dynamic being consciously perceived just by Draco, then this might not be the story for you
"What?", Harry can't quite follow the change of events. Wasn't he supposed to get a blowjob? Did he destroy the mood with that minor disruption?
"Yeah, it was." Harry, too, can now no longer hide a grin. “I mean, definitely awkward, but I think I might actually try and date him.”
“Well, let’s see then, what this luxurious flat has else to offer”, he says and scours the place further, passing the sleeping area to his left nearing the kitchenette.
Harry nearly chokes on his drink. "Merlin, no. We are more like support buddies for each other." Sadly, it's mostly Harry asking support from Falk - especially emotional one - than the other way around. Falk has no troubles with living his life out of the closet. He just enjoys the company of a fellow gay.
The idea is dumb enough for Harry to actually consider it. A tipsy brain appreciates risky and potentially profitable provocation.
"If I had written it, possibly you would have remembered, and...”, Drew bumblingly takes the floor again. “I just wanted to make sure to hear it from you in person."
“See, it was great to make your acquaintance. I regret that our time together was so short, but that is no reason for me to actively counteract this circumstance. If we meet again by chance, don’t refrain from calling out to me, though.” Harry hustles to the front door “I’ll see myself out then, alright?”
"Yes. A great horned owl. Grey plumage, interesting green eyes", he appraises Harry, then snickers. "I named him Peagreen for that."
finely carved banister under his fingers, he comes closer with each step to a hatch closed with a wooden flap door. When he can't get any further, he turns questioningly to Drew.
Despite his best efforts, his hair is sticking out in all directions, as if he had been on a four-hour test flight. At least his jeans fit well and emphasize his trained legs. He will probably have to rely on that, and of course on his irresistible charm, if he wants to be convincing on his upcoming date. Somehow this feels familiar to his last encounter with Drew.
“Fuck”, he mumbles as tears shot into his eyes, but manages to hold them back. Clearing his throat, he straightens his back and sits back against the sofa’s cushion. “Thanks. Uhm… yeah. So much for that.” Nervous laughter.
I like to think my strong points are writing dialogue , so please bear with the weaker parts between the dialogues
"Listen", Cas murmurs promising as if to drop the latest gossip, "he even had the audacity to ask me if my friend here", quick glance at Harry, then back to the subject of their topic, "happens to be interested in men and more specifically in him." Her indignation is all just an act, even though a bit of hurt pride shines through.
“Truer words were never spoken… If you please, refer to me as Drew.” Inside, Harry sighs disappointed. He had hoped to get Drew's real name now, but doesn’t bother enough to mention it explicitly.
"I'm here," he calls, as if the loud crack of Apparition hadn't already announced him clearly. Drew rushes out of the door behind which Harry remembers the bathroom.
"What's up, Harry? It's not every day you invite us to dinner on an ordinary Tuesday night," she doesn't beat around the bush as she takes a seat at his dining table. "Do you have tea?"
Both their stomachs are complaining audibly by now, and Drew offers to toast a few slices of bread and spread them with butter or something similar as a makeshift solution. Giggling, the two men stand in the corner of the kitchen, enjoying their more than needy dinner to a disproportionate degree, but probably even more enjoying each other's company.
"Thanks," Harry says, accepting the cup. He can't help but compare every movement, every word with the last time he was there, as Drew sits down across from him and rests his forearms on his knees, his upper body leaning towards him. Harry surveys him in silent anticipation, something he had studiously avoided the last time. The reason goes without saying; Drew is just outrageously good looking. If he had exposed himself to this sight for a longer period of time, who would have been able to tell whether he wouldn't have folded sooner or later that morning. The irony of him now sitting here again anyway, does not escape him.
"You say it as a joke, but there might be something to it. Knowing something is definitely wrong can give one a false sense of security," Hermione muses.
Harry senses the mood tipping, reveals more of himself than usual, and prevents further emotional outbursts by slowly sipping his tea.
"Guilty. Sorry, I'm not really awake yet either, and discreetly overwhelmed," Drew says plaintively. It's undeniable that he's probably just as uncomfortable as Harry, despite his placid façade. And normally Harry would take that into account, try to put himself at least somewhat in the other's shoes. But just now? Impossible, not when his only hold and sense of control lay in putting on his own clothes.
He’s freed from the agony of choice, when Drew decides to lift Harry on the countertop, and starts to fiddle on his flies. Harry at first lost for balance, softly moans, enjoys the liberation of this constricting prison of fabric, that had slowly started to get painful. And the aspect that there’s one layer less separating his prick from direct skin contact, might give it a little jump. Harry’s need to wait for that last layer to vanish, proves to be a sweet torment. Drew’s lifted his shirt and kisses his abdomen, raising to the rip cage, brushing his hardened nipples. Every touch of his lips leaves a prickling heat, teases Harry to want more while never giving him the pleasure of satisfaction. Harry’s head flops back in torture, when one of Drew’s thumbs nestles its way under the seam of his boxers.
Fortunately, the second reply provoked fewer defensive reactions in Harry. Drew was much more detailed and emotional about continuing to stand by his offer to get to know Harry.
"Just do it. Hold on tight." Well, obediently he follows. Who is he to question his potential bedmate.
“Of course, I am. And I will learn of it, the moment you tell me, because he told you of his own.” She crosses her arms, he Harry and Ron both know the topic has been closed and they’d to smart with not bringing the subject up again this evening.
“Harry?” The tone of Drew’s voice is pleading. Harry turns around, only to be surprised by the soft pressure of lips on his own. It’s a farewell kiss, demanding, almost desperate, breathless, its impact overpowering Harry’s will to move. A part of Harry jumps with delight, and every effort of the whole morning to deny the existing attraction turn out to be in vain. But before Harry can actively give in, the moment is over again.
"Not to mention your ominous owl message last week, Harry. We know something's up," Hermione grins mischievously.
“I just never intended to in the first place, you see? Why change my mind just because now he knows of my true identity?”
“Thanks for your offer. I appreciate it. I’ll think about it. But don’t get your hopes up”, Harry’s back to seriousness as fast as he slipped. He stands up, ready to leave.
"I doubt it'll do any good, but fine. I'm Harry Potter, and you?" he says sceptical and extends a hand to introduce himself.
"Thank you, for that benevolent assessment of my scope. Honestly, I've seen other options for myself and have already set them in motion."
But this was 4 years ago. Now that his everyday work has come to a routine and he has found himself a very nice flat in Wizarding London, that was not filled with painful memories as Grimmauld Place was, now that he has a steady group of friends, and a steady psyche and, yeah, practically a settled life… he was ready and open for a relationship. If it wasn’t for his prominence and the stuck-up wizarding world concerning same sex relationship.
Harry feels great. Not only has he found a rather promising shag, but also probably won a bet in one strike. "How about we get to know each other further on the dance floor?"
"That… disguise", she vaguely gestures her hand to indicate his whole body. "I mean, it's somewhat of an upgrade, but not as if you needed one."
Harry's thoughts are interrupted when Drew slides into his field of vision. "Coffee?" he asks, holding out a cup to Harry. Oh, the resemblances.
A shadow hangs over him, when he notices, that he hasn’t told his best friends yet about the latest circumstances in his life, but it’s the kind of darkness, that helps with falling asleep rather than evoking anxiety-driven insomnia.
"Sit down, I'll be done in a minute”, Drew says and ushers Harry towards the leather couches, then disappears back into the bathroom.
“Aw. I’m so excited”, Hermione joins in. “I really hope, it turns out well, for the both of you. And don’t hesitate to consult me next time, something buggers you.” She takes his hand to squeeze it encouraging.
Shaking off the melancholy Harry closes the window, and aimlessly sits back at the kitchen table and stares into space. To say that his racing mind has come to an end would be an exaggeration, but a certain calm settles in him.
Potter’s cheeks pinked. ‘Erm, well, if you want to I guess? Cub, do you mind if Mister Malfoy joins us?’
Harry scoffed at this; it wasn’t like he’d actually sat his N.E.W.T.s, what with the whole Battle of Hogwarts and fight for the wizarding world had been going on (and then the Death Eater trials, which Harry had
He can sense something of heavy weight dropping next to him on the mattress, a hand cupping his jaw, a face nuzzling in the curve of his neck. Soft kisses. Tickling hair. Coziness.
"Mhh, I like", Falk smirks. They three of them huddle in a flock like teenagers, stalking their common crush in not the most of discrete ways. Namely they all stare at Blondie, who was again leaning at his pillar. If they had been sober, they might have had the decency to at least act like their visual and conversational attention wasn't all occupied by him, but they weren't. Instead they tucked their heads even closer.
His acoustic sense tells him, someone in the background is muttering repeatedly "shit". Must be Drew, Harry combines. Harry must have stayed the night, he combines. Harry usually doesn't stay the night, because his polyjuice potion’s effect could wear off while he sleeps. Since he apparently has stayed the night yesterday, the effect thus might have worn off by now, he combines. He looks down at himself to check the presence of this instance, as if his inability to see without glasses hasn't provided that information already. Harry panics, as every inch of his body is indeed
Just as he gets up to move his whereabouts to the living room, he sees a large, unfamiliar barn owl sitting on the window sill. Immediately he suspects a bad incident at Ron and Hermione's. She is expecting her first baby and is six months pregnant. Should she have come to the hospital because of some complication and someone from the staff sent Harry an owl to notify him? Quickly he lets the animal in, and takes from it the little message attached to its foot.
"Sounds pretty good actually, doesn't it?", Cas muses at him, apparently not quite getting the picture of where Harry himself stands on the matter.
"The absence of a lurid article in the Daily Prophet made me wonder. I thought I'd better check to make sure you hadn't fallen into a permanent coma from sensationalism."
"I don't know maybe chicken out and loose our bet before even trying. Or maybe saving you a fit for the night?"
“I would like to see you again”, Drew clarifies. “I know, we both had no deeper intention in mind when we embarked on our nocturnal adventure and I respect it, if you want to leave it as that. But I’d be delighted, if not.” Harry’s not prepared for something like that. He rather braced himself already for hoards of reporters importuning him with every step he makes, for harassment. Even blackmail he predicted, if the unfortunate revelation of his secret occurred. But to ever consider someone just being willing to see him again without any greater benefits but his company as unsuspicious he had nipped in the bud.
"Challenging." Blondie flashes another smile, and bites his lips in amusement, then aims at the bar, pulling Harry after him just with his gaze. He follows eagerly.
“Correct”, he acknowledges and proceed to collect his trousers, which lie not far away from where Drew had picked up his boxers. Unfortunately, Drew hasn’t moved since, and Harry finds himself to be awkwardly close and exposed to his observation while executing the humiliating act of bowing down to gather the very same clothes that only hours before were peeled from his body, by this very same man.
Not infrequently, especially at work, Harry finds that he has difficulty putting his drive and ideas into practice in a meaningful way. He frantically ponders how to draft a letter that conveys both the character of a casual "I just wanted to ask how things are going" and the proper remorse for his previous inappropriate silence.
After the first few sips, he dares to think halfway rationally again. Since he doesn't consider beating-oneself-up to be very productive, he returns to his original question and the fear that goes with it. Why is Drew not interested in selling him to the press? The only comprehensible answer to that would be, he genuinely is interested in Harry, but that just doesn’t feel realistic, as Harry sincerely wonders what behaviour of his might have convinced Drew to consider dating him. At what point has he been conceiving the aura of being dating material? Not only did Harry lie to Drew, but had also been dead drunk and then dead hungover, almost constantly on the verge of throwing up since they’ve arrived at Drew’s flat, and practically nothing but a messy nuisance. How very attractive and exactly what you look for in a one-night stand, not to say in a partner. He doesn’t take Drew for a fame-hunter though, that much he conveyed. But he cannot get rid of the feeling that something is off.
In the centre stands a massive antique desk, strewn with parchment, folders, writing utensils and a retro 50s lamp. On the far wall he recognises a small table with a cauldron, above it a shelf with potion ingredients in jars, each meticulously labelled and ordered by colour, a funny contrast to the mess on the table. And, of course, to all the plants standing and hanging everywhere. The room is more greenery than anything else and a certain jungle atmosphere emanates from it. Harry isn't sure if he's imagining a slight whirring sound and wouldn't be surprised if a small monkey or a bird jumped on his shoulder or a swarm of butterflies rose from one of the flower pots. But then again, he thinks, Drew is probably more the type whose level of pet-keeping is limited to a delivery owl. Judging from an empty birdcage with an open door hanging in the corner to his left, he seems to be right.
"If you consider the perceptiveness of a flubberworm to be very observant, then it's down to us alone," Ron jibes, to which Harry flips two fingers.
A muffled banging from the kitchen indicates the arrival of their food. For the next 10 minutes cosy, wordless silence occupies the room, only to be broken the clacking of cutlery, the sound of food being eaten and occasional appreciative sounds.
as mentioned before there is an existing planned out silver lining of this story. But during writing I sometimes realise I don't quite know where the story will go to in detail myself until I come to the respective scene. It's a fun yet exhausting process... And sometimes I need  to redo a lot of paragraphs, when I drift off, and the mood changes too drastically or in a direction I initially didn't intend it to got.
The corners of Drew's mouth twitch into a slight smile that doesn't extend to his eyes. "If you want a detailed, argumentative answer to that, I'll have to disappoint you. In the end, I suppose my motive can be reduced to the vague sense of a wavelength existing between us."
When Harry comes back out of the kitchen, Cas has made herself comfortable, leaning back against the side of the sofa, knees drawn up and a cushion wedged between her stomach and legs, casually fiddling with her hair, which she has undone in the meantime.
"Oh, Harry, tomorrow," Ron's yawning face does appear in the embers in front of him. "Did something happen? Did I forget something?"
He gets up, knees giving in first. He's wearing no pants and has a solid morning wood. Was to be expected, unpleasant nonetheless. He discovers, that discomfort from nudity is much enhanced when it's your real body being exposed. With a wandless "Accio knickers" he aims for remedy, but is again not rewarded. Bloody hangover.
Harry, in Gryffindor manner, can be in no way inferior and take such exposure by giving in. “No, it’s fine”, he barks, and defiantly locks eyes with Drew as the pair of trousers slides down his legs and reveals his by now subsided boner. Drew tries to keep his cool, but his gaze more than once slips suspiciously to lower regions than Harry’s eyes, while Harry takes an outrageous long time to get back into his boxers.
It takes no second for Harry to realize it was trance-night tonight. Not his favourite genre but usually it attracts the open-minded portion of young wizards, so that’s a plus. He always notices with interest which parts of muggle culture is adapted to the wizarding world, and music must be the greatest probably.
"Nah. My ambitions weren't that high, I was still only a, uh, third grader, before we moved. And to be honest, I became a bit estranged from the others at some point, anyway." A dark shadow flits across Drew's face. Should Drew possibly also have had his differences with identifying as a Slytherin-member?
"Thanks for the concern”, Drew laughs. “As you can see, I'm perfectly fine. The near coma only hit me when your tiny owl was knocking like crazy on my window here," his eyes wander to the window front. "Thought a bird had accidentally hit the glass at first, despite my protective spells."
"It's me, Harry. I... drank some polyjuice potion", he admits, which earns him Falk’s elbow in the rips. "Come on you spoilsport, why are you already out with the truth? Don’t you see a perfect prank template presented on a silver plate?"
"It's fine, everyone has their skeletons in the cupboard. As long as you don't mind your partner screaming 'the wrong name' later on, I don’t mind." Harry’s alcohol induced straight forwardness leaves a lot to be desired. He’s even too drunk to at least properly blush. Something you cannot say about Drew. Face reddening, he chokes a bit, coughs. "You play with very open cards, huh?"
Harry considers. He acted, ultimately, from the motive of getting that annoying little voice of Cas's out of his ear. At least that is the reason he holds up to himself in order to be able to leave his actual subconsciously simmering needs and desires untouched for a little longer. But as long as he wants to keep dwelling in this blissful denial, he can’t possibly tell him that.
"Have you tried? I mean, to get into the team? After Malfoy threw in the towel, there really wasn't anything left at your house. I mean, I know you weren’t at Hogwarts anymore at that time, but a few more fair-playing members wouldn’t have been too bad." he laughs, yet notices Drew grimacing at his words. Perhaps Harry himself has let his not-very-affection towards Slytherins back in school shine through a little too much.
He watches Drew's face intensively, looking for signs of resonance, a hint, if he feels the same need when the sudden realisation of it still being daylight hits him. It feels like ages since he’s last made out on an occasion, that hadn’t originated during the late hours in some club. In his own body.
"All right! I'm doing something about it!" he shouts exasperatedly into the otherwise empty room, and energetically gets up from the sofa to sit down at his secretary, where he immediately remains broodingly in a stupor of thought.
“You certainly won’t have to,” he says and Harry feels the warm stream of breath on his cheeks, holds his own breath in anticipation. Excitement ripples through his chest, the urge to pull Drew closer immediately, the wish this hand in his nape would make use of its excellent positioning, anything to just get rid of this god damn ridiculous gap between their lips.
Drew has exchanged his suit trousers for dark blue chinos, which in Harry's eyes is only a minimal downgrade towards a casual look. On the other hand, considering his first impressions of Drew, he didn't expect much else, which is why he himself has dressed up much more deliberately and formal than he would usually do for a meet up (he’s still resistant to call it a date).
At home he realises, that they departed without defining what purpose the meeting had served. In the end they had not been making out at all, and to his surprise he’s very much at peace with this state of affairs. What hasn’t been yet, may yet come. And if they end up just talking on their next date, it might be just fine, too. Wasn’t that supposed to be the natural course of events anyway. Though technically, it was already too late to approach things in the proper order.
“You notice it?”, Harry wonders, as he himself has never seen this owl, and gets up, to let it in. The bird lands on Harry’s stretched out lower arm and obediently holds up its claw, where a little note has been attached.
Harry's tension, which had built up unnoticed, unwinds leisurely. "Fair enough," he acknowledges. "I can be very judgmental. It's almost impossible to meet someone who isn't already biased in some way or another because of my notoriety. And it's always a tightrope walk to sense who is just projecting their ideas of me onto me and wants to bathe in the glow of fame." Harry smiles apologetically. "Or who is really interested in getting to know me," he adds with a big exhale.
Second, Draco’s flipping through the appointment book meant that he arrived at the page of tomorrow’s appointments. Glancing down at the page, his eyes got stuck on the name of an appointment set for tomorrow afternoon under the horribly obtuse name of “Roonil Wazlib” - the most obvious of pseudonyms and only befitting two people that he could think of; Ronald Weasley, and…
‘How can you say it’s nothing? They assaulted you! Last time I checked, that was still illegal, Malfoy. And they’re
Harry’s voice came out choked, not at all in the confident way he was supposed to be feeling as an Auror in charge of his newly paroled offender.
‘Har har,’ Draco deadpanned. ‘I think it was actually you using me, the poor, scary Death Eater, to frighten away all of your quivering fans.’
scratch it no matter how itchy it gets! You’ll ruin the ink and I won’t have you complaining to Eddie about me when you ruin your own tattoo.’
Not least because Malfoy was his parolee, his charge, his bloody childhood rival for Merlin’s sake! But right there, bubbling merrily away on the surface, was such an intense want - a
‘Now. Do you want to tell me what’s on your mind? Or are we going to just sit here in silence this week?’ Andi’s smile was kind, but there was a glint of knowing in her eyes that Harry didn’t like one bit.
‘No, papa, no! One jump, one jump!’ Edward looked up at Potter with some of the most well-practised puppy-dog eyes Draco had ever seen, it was truly commendable and Draco resolved to plying him with sweets to help him improve his manipulation tactics so they’d be in peak condition by the time he started Hogwarts.

intensely - with a fresh cup of coffee and a babbling child on his knee. Free and happy and not burdened by the mistakes he had made as a child under his father’s rule. Shaking his head to clear the delirious fantasy from his head, he cleared his throat and took the seat opposite Potter.
Harry dodged around some whispering fans yet again, cursing how far away Diagon’s designated apparition point was from the majority of the shops, it’s like the alley was trying to force him to be mobbed by reporters and fans. In fact, Harry was
‘Yes, my sister and I have had many a discussion about the young men we look after,’ she shot him a suspicious looking side-eye as she mopped up the mess Teddy had made with the last of his hot chocolate, ‘and we’ve both decided that it would be much better for them in the long run if they learnt to move on from past mistakes.’
forearms. The sight of him was pure sex on legs and Draco was almost struck dumb at how gorgeous Potter looked in that moment.
She had flown in her first game just after Halloween of the same year, and had been on the starting team for the three years since. Harry had yet to miss a game.
It wasn’t to say that the thought of finding a bloke hot was setting him on edge, in fact he was very conscious of his own bisexuality; he’d discovered it quite by accident after that night with a few too many fire whiskeys and too few clothes with a
Draco knew he’d hit the nail on the head. ‘Oh come on, sweetheart, you can tell me. I promise I won’t tease unless you beg me to.’
Harry could only suspect a late night studying in the library, but their different courses meant they couldn’t study together most of the time. Draco had been yawning profusely before they’d even sat down in the cinema, and for the first half of the film he had been leaning more and more into Harry’s side. It hadn’t taken long before Harry’s resolve had broken and he’d whispered over to Draco to just rest his head on his shoulder.
The smirk wiped itself from Malfoy’s face at the mention of Azkaban. Clearly the six months Malfoy had been out had done little to help him to forget his time spent there, despite the fact that he no longer looked half starved.
Draco followed Potter and a babbling Edward into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. Much like the hallway and the parts of rooms that Draco had glimpsed, the kitchen had received a much similar refresh in its decor.
It took Draco little more than five minutes to fill out the questions that Potter always seemed to drag out into a full hour. Typical useless gryffindors. He looked over at Potter again, and
Draco became a common sight to see around the Auror department, often with pastries or lunch, and always with coffee and a chaste kiss to the top of Harry’s head, so it was only fair that Harry become a common sight to see around Slug & Jiggers around Draco’s lunch breaks. Harry hadn’t quite worked out how to kiss the top of Draco’s head without breaking one of Draco’s very strict rules about their fake-lationship, though, and figured that boxes of his favourite chocolates and sweets might make up for it for now.

not being quite so straight-as-a-ruler as previously thought. Again. Draco grimaced, surely the whiskey hadn’t made him forget so spectacularly. ‘Seems you are perfect after all.’
Harry ordered and collected the drinks at the bar, settling for just two glasses of champagne rather than a whole bottle since it was only two of them actually

‘If, after four years of actual marriage, you do not know to buy Hermione surprise bouquets or boxes of chocolates, that’s on you Weasel.’
Malfoy Mask back in place, Draco did his best indifferent smirk. ‘Relax, Potter. I’m a grown boy, I don’t have a curfew.’
, the irony that he was protecting Malfoy was not lost on him - Harry marched him to the Atrium, out of the ministry, and down a couple of streets before coming to a stop at his favourite fish and chip shop. This was always a favourite place to come back in the early days of the auror academy; all the recruits would come here every Friday, after a week of hard training sessions, and pig out on fish, chips, mushy peas, battered sausages, the whole works, all while bitching about whatever Robards or their training instructors had said.
‘Oi, less of that, thanks. And I'm not an auror, or you wouldn’t be sitting here would you?’ Harry moved around Malfoy to the chair behind his desk, sitting down himself. ‘Now, I know you’re you and I’m me but for the sake of getting you through your parole period could we please try and be somewhat civil? Or professional? At the very least not hating each other’s guts?’
He wouldn’t be surprised if Potter was desperate enough to leap at the chance to go for a drink with him, though. Not that Draco wasn’t a catch, and he definitely was, but it would significantly damage Potter’s reputation to be seen with a
He knew that a date and a knot in your stomach usually meant butterflies and giddiness and excitement, but he couldn’t help himself from feeling uncomfortable with it; like the knot was telling him something else entirely.
He needed someone with the same fire as Ginny, though. Someone who could push his buttons and widen his boundaries and catapult him right out of his comfort zone (which had become unbelievably small in the years since the war). He needed someone who knew his past, who knew each and every secret in his life, and loved him in spite of it all. He needed someone who knew he made mistakes, and who had made mistakes themselves, but who worked with him to make amends and strive for a better life.
an Auror anymore wasn’t enough to not be ignored, and the satisfaction he’d get from catching more dark wizards and righting more of Voldemort’s wrongs was plenty enough to be getting on with for now.
Harry wasn’t surprised at the answer, but Draco’s reaction to it could have provided some sort of evidence in some case against a new group of Neo-Death Eaters that the main aurors were trying to build. Not that anyone would tell him any more details than that, apparently destroying a Dark Lord means fuck all to people who’ve been doing it for a living for longer than he’d been alive. But still, anyone who knew anything about Draco Malfoy knew that he’d wanted nothing to do with the
Potter looked up at him with the most empty expression in his eyes. Draco’s heart almost broke, he was pretty sure he’d do just about anything to get the fire back going behind those eyes.
would come back to bite him on the arse if he wasn’t careful. It didn’t help that everyone was so encouraging of him finally going on dates, either, they were too distracted by his apparent dating success to notice just how far his head had been in the clouds for two weeks now.
Malfoy cast one more look over Harry’s face, before strengthening the numbing charms around his wrist. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever feel his wrist again at this point. When the gun started up once more, Malfoy looked up again to check Harry’s pain level. Seeming satisfied with Harry’s lack of response, he continued with the drawing.
Shaking his head, Harry couldn’t help but laugh. It wasn’t surprising that Andi had been in Slytherin, she truly was the most pleasantly cunning woman he knew.
start policing the volume that people spoke to him after all - but Harry was convinced that Sam had had something to do with the reporter that had coincidently been sat two tables down from them!
‘Your complete lack of getting into the loved-up spirit, for one,’ Draco mused over at him, ‘my own knowledge of your dismal love life, for another.’
As action packed as it was, though, about three quarters of the way in, Draco fell asleep on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry had walked away from his tattoo appointment in a bit of a daze; healing cream in one hand, the other wrapped up tightly in what felt like muggle cling film, and a dumbstruck smile on his face.
‘You deserve a fresh start,’ Harry murmured, ‘I wouldn’t have spoken at your trial if I didn’t believe that. I’m sorry, by the way. I didn’t want you to go to Azkaban at all. I thought I could help but I failed you.’
‘Narcissus? It’s a type of daffodil, honestly Harry, I know they're only muggle plants but do you pay attention to anything other than quidditch?’
Sam set about making the drinks straight away and Harry had to commend him for his level of professionalism, even though it felt like their interaction was being scrutinised and dissected by (no one) everyone in the cafe, ready to report to the
‘Oh yeah? And how would you possibly know how much he’s changed? You haven’t seen that ferrety face since the trials!’
forgotten about until her mentioning it, and he’d been in their bloody house for a bloody birthday party just a few days before.
Although down a set of stairs and into what felt like a basement, the room felt light and airy. The walls were a bright white and light streamed in from the faux windows there; Potter must have bribed the Ministry to tell him their window spell, as the scene showed a garden not unlike Draco’s own at his mother’s house in Kensington. The kitchen cabinets were a pale grey and the light wood of the worktops perfectly matched the light wood of the same reclaimed floorboards as in the hallway.
, dragged Harry down the book aisle to browse the latest two-for-eight-pounds deals of muggle novels to read whilst he made his way through box after box of muggle tea.
‘I’ll see you soon, H.’ The nickname Harry reserved only for Draco to use made his heart swell right back up again. ‘I really am sorry, I was looking forward to that drink.’
Potter sneered in response, but it was half-hearted and Draco could see no real malice behind it. Draco hadn’t seen real malice behind anything Potter had done or said to him since he’d comforted him after the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. It wasn’t… awful. But it meant Draco had had to work extra hard to ignore all feelings and emotions. Obviously that had all gone out of the window now.
“Côte d'Opale”, Drew now leans onto Harry's back, lets his arms be supported by his shoulder girdle and his head hang next to Harry’s right ear. “Where I’ve lived after… uh and during the war.”
The exertions of the last 12 hours take effect on arrival, despite the coffee and hangover drink, and Harry praises himself for the clever idea of apparating straight to his bathroom when he empties his modest stomach contents into the toilet not a second later.
"You alright?", Drew asks casually, as if he wasn't holding England's most famous wizard unhoped-for in his arms.
Harry smiles inanely, and promises to answer tomorrow, as he’s way to sleepy now. He goes to bed so deeply satisfied with the latest events.
"Tell me why", Cas asks Harry after they had a few drinks, still sitting at the bar and watching Falk manhunting on the dance floor. The music's gotten much louder and people are dancing erratically to some oriental electronic beats.
Soon after, Drew comes back from the kitchen area with a steaming cup of coffee and a small flask and sits down at the other end of the couch Harry sits on. The sight of the latter remembers Harry of his own flask deep down in the pocket of his jeans, filled with the polyjuice potion he wishes he had taken before falling asleep. He receives both liquids, downing the potion then nipping at the other. The pain relief sets in straight away. At least something.
“Okay, so if this isn't a one-time offer on a silver platter for you, how do you think you'll ever find a partner instead?”, Cas further challenges him.
Harry awakens with throbbing pain in his head. His tactile sense tells him, he’s lying in a bed. He blinks. His visual sense tells him, it's way too bright for his eyes and that the relevant bed is not his own bed. It also informs him, that he's seeing all that through a blurry veil, hinting he's not wearing his glasses. Mindlessly he fumbles for his wand on the nightstand, but is not rewarded.
"Well, then there's plenty of other fish here, right?" Her enthusiasm is contagious. Harry can barely wait to hit on the guy.
And Cas is not long in coming. Dressed in a sweat suit and her hair tied in a messy bun, she gives the impression of having just jumped from the bed into the fireplace. Probably not too far from the truth.
“Nghh... fuck”, he gulps and buries his hands in Drew’s hair, bucks his pelvis in self-takeover for a few last thrusts, and climaxes. The brilliant shudder of unadulterated pleasure crushes him. Stars before his eyes and a mild tinnitus overshadow a coughing Drew in the background, and the usual urge to indulge in further sexual activities, and to return the favor at least.
Harry’s suppresses the need to answer that question as his response would be of nothing but a smug nature, and instead concentrates on the man beneath his fingers. Harry finds, that exploring this certain specimen’s body is a task that actually calls for undivided attention. He can’t tell why, though. Just that he has difficulties to weigh up what to do first. Getting him out off his shirt seems desirable, running his hands over his back just as well. And god, how can he neglect that fine ass Drew himself has any longer?
Harry nods knowingly. He also uses name aliases... and body aliases. Who is he to question someone's motivation to hide their identity.
‘Potter, I know you most likely don’t wish to speak about it, especially to me, of all people, but if there’s anything I can offer that would make you feel even the slightest bit better, then I’m here.’
The time it took to get from his and his mother’s tiny house, to the ministry, down to Potter’s office, and sitting in the chair opposite him, passed by in a flash and Draco’s not entirely sure he could remember how he did any of it.
: muscle compared to his malnutrition, full of life compared to his emptiness, bright emerald eyes to his deadened grey.
‘Quite sure mum, he told me himself. Sat me down in his office and broke the news in his usual brutish way.’
- since the end of fifth year and his father’s imprisonment in Azkaban. His life and his choices hadn’t been stellar up until that point, by no means, but that summer before sixth year and ever since was, collectively, the worst time of his life. It was only now, sitting here needling a tiny stag into the wrist of Potter, that he felt his life finally start to be looking up.
. He felt his face twist up, his heart squeeze, and something in his stomach knot up again. But it only took one look back up into those eyes, those shining blue eyes that look so sincere and full of hints of guilt and hope, for all of his previous reservations and resentments to fade away into the background. Harry knows that he’s got so much going on in his own head to sort out before he could even consider anything to do with Sam again, but the ease of it all, the familiarity, was almost enough for him to just dive straight back in head first.
‘Black Lotus Tattoos? It’s on Diagon Alley, been there a while I think, took over from Fortescue's after the war.’
It wasn’t until after Harry had sat down opposite Andi, placed one of the coffees in front of her and the hot chocolate in front of an enthusiastic Teddy, and they’d all got past the first few sips, that Andromeda spoke.
‘Seamus wai-’ Harry began, but it was too late. Draco, Dean, and Seamus were already making plans to go and see the movie, and inviting the rest of their friends.
parole officer, but his eyes now shone with mirth instead of the steel grey, as if he was only moments away from laughing at Harry’s discomfort. In another lifetime - if they had been friends - Harry knew that Malfoy would tear him to shreds over  a slip up like this, it made up 87% of his humour with Ron, Dean, Seamus, and Neville in their dorm over the years at Hogwarts.
Harry checked his watch. ‘We’ve still got half an hour, I’m not supposed to let you leave before we’ve had the full time. So I guess we’ll just sit here and enjoy each other’s company?’
, he supposed - had thankfully stopped the intense staring into what felt like Draco’s soul and was now fixed on the stag on his wrist. Draco couldn’t help but smile at the sight, Potter hadn’t even noticed that he’d finished the inking process.
Choosing to ignore the fact that Potter’s magical tattoo had just charged at him and chased him away, Draco instead turned his attention back to his young cousin. He made all the appropriate noises when Edward informed him of his creations with his building blocks, and the current storylines his toy figures were currently being forced to act out.
It didn’t matter. Every minute he was late was another minute that Harry didn’t have to drag out the stupid questions he had to ask every time. The answers never changed. It was the most pointless hour of his week, and that said a lot when most of his week was full of other such pointless paperwork. Honestly, if this was being an auror then the DMLE sold the biggest con ever with their “dark wizard catchers” and raids and busting up potion smuggling dens. A lifetime of pointless paperwork was enough to make Harry want to jump off a broom mid-flight.
Malfoy had obviously been out of Azkaban long enough to recover from the starvation diet and malnutrition, if anything, Harry would say that Malfoy had even developed a bit of a pouch. Not that that was a bad thing of course, after so long with his stomach concaving inwards from lack of food, it was nice to see someone post-Azkaban with the faint curve of a healthy, full belly. The pointed angles that had been so quintessentially Malfoy back at school had softened as a result, too, but still looked like they could cut if you brushed along them. The luminous silver of his hair was blonder, dirtier, polluted with strands of gold. He no longer looked like a direct clone of his father, and
At Draco’s nod, Harry busied himself with the familiar routine of making tea to Draco’s standard. Making sure the tea steeped for exactly the right length of time, adding the exact amount of milk, all in his favourite mug. In contrast, Harry couldn’t have given less of a shit about his own mug of tea. Hell, his mug even had a chip in the side.
Potter clears his throat and stands up straight again, facing Draco head on with the most serious expression on his face. ‘Because he has tiny hands.’
‘Oh, Draco! I forgot to mention, give this to Mister Potter, will you?’ Narcissa Malfoy looked up from the book she was reading and handed her son an envelope that looked suspiciously like…
Draco could feel Potter’s breath dancing across his cheek. He smelt faintly of fire whiskey, treacle tart, and some flowery concoction, and Draco was certainly not complaining. He closed his eyes as he felt Potter get even closer, focusing only on the sensation of Potter’s stubble grazing across his own, silently begging the other man to just lean over and close the final gap…
‘I do. But I’m not going to corral you into something I know to be a futile attempt. Come on, Teddy will start getting fussy if we stay any longer.’
, but I’m in the middle of one right now- just waiting for the charm to settle before I can finish. You know how it is,’ Eddie gave a somewhat nervous laugh.
The pair walked up to the counter and had a look at the menu. Harry looked over at Draco out of the corner of his eye.
‘Harry, you’d better not be shagging any more of my siblings out there!’ Ron shouted out at them, not daring to come out fully and risk scarring his eyeballs again, just in case.
Harry walked back to the Granger-Weasley residence with his two best friends, even stepping through briefly to make use of the floo rather than attempt to accurately remember the three D’s of apparating after a few pints. He just about made it up the stairs of Grimmauld Place and into his bed before falling fast asleep, to dream of blond-haired men, birthday parties, and kisses.
A small smile grew on Malfoy’s face at that, and Harry decisively did not examine the loops his stomach had started doing at the sight.
‘So, erm… how did you meet Malfoy?’ Harry asked, desperate to break the awkward silence between them.
‘Right, okay then.’ Potter was looking at him in utter disbelief, Aunt Andromeda had clearly not informed him of Draco’s increasing presence in his young cousin’s life. ‘Can you sit down now so we can have our meeting?’
‘You know I’m not going to quit Ron, being an Auror is basically hardwired into my brain and you know it.’ Ron snorted at this, but Harry carried on. ‘If anyone’s got a right to be pissed, mate, it’s me! You abandoned me! What happened to becoming Aurors together?’
After what felt like another three years, an impenetrable silence, and Harry feeling like he might just combust at any moment, Malfoy nodded.
Draco sighed. The new rotations at the prison now meant that visits from P would be few and far between; Draco was only thankful that he had managed to set up mobile telephone communication as soon as he’d been released so that he still had
look at before tucking it away in a box inside his mind, labelled “Do not approach unless with a large stick and three bottles of fire whiskey”.
Draco slowly turned his steely grey gaze back over to Harry, and Harry tried his best not to cringe away, but Draco just smirked at him. ‘I thought you knew about my pet names for you, sweetheart, or is this just your way of saying you prefer me to call you “sweetheart” over anything else?’
, Harry knew that if Lucius could see his son now he’d faint from shock. His long legs were encased in black skinny jeans so tight it looked like they’d been sprayed onto him, his top half was clothed in an equally tight white t-shirt that hugged him everywhere in the best way, he had a deliciate, silver chain around his neck, and huge black combat boots on his feet. The black leather jacket, of course, what else? had been shrugged over the back of his chair upon arrival. But what struck Harry most, what he couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away from, were the
Harry hummed in agreement and took another sip of his drink. ‘I’d like to be. Sometimes it feels like you lot are the only people who might see me that way.’
Potter nodded along with what Draco said, but by the way Potter didn’t take his eyes back off the stag on his wrist, he wasn’t too sure a single word he’d said had been heard. Draco stood up, chuckling softly to himself as he left the room to get the supplies. Of course, most wix reacted that way to their first magical tattoo, but Draco hadn’t expected Potter’s eyes to be quite so shiny, quite so green. It was a bit disarming but not altogether an unwelcome feeling.
Potter had tipped him. No matter how small, it was surely a sign that hell was currently freezing over. Draco looked back up to the retreating figure in the window.
An Irish voice broke Harry out of his reverie; it sounded suspiciously like Seamus but Harry knew that he was off travelling somewhere in South-East Asia with Dean, so it couldn’t possibly be him. Looking up to meet the voice, Harry was fixed in place by the bluest eyes he thought he’d ever seen. Even Dumbledore’s couldn’t have held a candle to these ones.
Sam’s eyebrows shoot up at the same time as the corner of his mouth quirks into a tiny upwards smile, too quickly for him to acknowledge it before schooling his expression into one that he no doubt hoped was less enthusiastic and slightly more nonchalant, much to the bemusement of Harry.
, with the killing curse, only to survive both times when everyone else died instantly? Who had been groomed his whole life by a tottering old fool who cared more about a prophecy than he did the child in front of him?
‘Relax, Harry, we’re just teasing. Living vicariously through you is the only option for us now. Live fast and date everyone you can whilst you still can, before you’re wifed up like us two losers here.’
too, which felt even more unnatural, but if “Malfoy” reminded him of his good-for-nothing-toe-rag of a father, Harry couldn’t really blame M-Draco for wanting a bit of distance. But it was going to take a lot of getting used to, even if Draco didn’t hex him for it first.
Caught off guard, he averts his eyes abruptly, whispers an "Accio shirt" and then an "Accio wand". Less than three seconds later, a piece of wood unexpectedly hits him in the back of the head, accompanied by an indignant "Oi" across the room. Harry picks up the clumsily conjured wand (no need to embarrass himself with another failed spell) and immediately feels a certain familiarity, if not that of his own wand. Before he can further explore this odd sensation a fierce “Expelliarmus” snaps the wand out of his hand. Startled Harry looks up, seeing Drew, who has casted the quite impressive wandless spell, reaching out for the flying wand.
While he is putting away the foods packaging, he remembers that he still has Drew's unread message waiting for him in his pocket. In all the commotion, he has completely forgotten to look at what it says.
"I can only repeat myself. I have no intention of telling anyone about this unless it is in your best interest. I like you off your game and I bet I’ll like you when you’re running at top form, if you let me get to know this side of you. Otherwise... I will, of course, give you a proper send-off”, Drew's appeasement ends in defeated resignation. Harry can’t help but be moved by it. But he has set it in his head that one-night stands remain one-night stands, and once he has an attitude, he stubbornly follows it. Attitudes do not come from nowhere. He has good reasons for holding them, and in the end it was this quality of his that saved him from many wrong decisions and ultimately even death.
"Thank you, Harry," she replies, a surprising amount of sincere gratitude ringing through. "I feel very much like Chinese today." Ron nods in agreement and Harry looks for the relevant flyer from their regular supplier. After a quick skim of the card (purely pro forma, since they all know it by heart anyway), the order is out by owl post.
Harry shakes his can of owl treat, hoping to distract Peagreen from his revenge campaign with success. The bird eagerly picks treat after treat, and Harry finally snatches the note off its leg.
"But that's wonderful, Harry! How did it go?" gloats Hermione. "Oh boy, to think it's still happening. I'd almost lost hope that you'd let someone new into your life again."
"I know, I know. And I understand but I also don't want to see you scourge yourself." Falk’s face has a sympathetic concerned expression, that fades into a delighted smile seconds after. "Hey, isn't that Cassiopeia?" Harry turns to the indicated direction and brightens up himself. Just like Falk he knows Cas through their Company's Quidditch-Team and even though they all work in different departments - Falk in service, Cas in financial - they often spend lunch together and sometimes meet up at bars. Harry likes her carefree, lively manner which is accentuated by her open friendly face but stands in contrast to her long black hair and fierce, dark eyes and also her Slytherin background – as some would presumably say. They wave at her, and she immediately comes over with a somewhat puzzled smile.
“Please”, he pleads halfheartedly. It tingles under his fingernails; the answer is so close and yet so far. But he also knows Hermione has the necessary discipline to block out any clue that might actually reveal the owner's identity to her.
In shame, Harry stops abruptly in the street and buries his face in his hands, earning him some disapproving glances from passers-by. His desolate mental and also physical state does not fit in very well with the hustle and bustle of the London streets on a sunny Saturday noon, Harry has to admit to himself. With an exasperated sigh, he determines that apparating home is currently the quickest and most effective way to escape the city's commotion. As soon as he has found a suitable out-of-sight spot, he thinks no longer and with a crack he is gone.
“Yes, thanks”, Harry says dryly and snatches them out of his hand with a wandless that mercifully works. He halts, considers if he should undress right on the spot in front of Drew or if he preferers to go to the bathroom. Technically there’s nothing the other man hasn’t seen yet. On the other side, Harry’s not sure if Drew ever saw him completely naked since he is optically Harry again. Probably not.
Harry leans back and takes a deep sip of coffee. "Perhaps Cassiopeia's reaffirming words have also revised my judgement. Apparently, my friends are not happy with the way I'm conducting my love life."
"Harry, hi!" he says breathlessly. "You're here." With hands still damp, he brushes strands of his loose hair out of his face, and then provisionally tries to rubs them dry with themselves. Harry notes with amusement, that for Drew his clothes are definitely not considered to be a towel substitute. Fair enough since he’s wearing black suit trousers and a white shirt, probably remnants of his work attire. Maybe Harry was a tad too punctual.
Harry playfully slaps her upper arm but his resent doesn't go any further. "I feel less observed and can act more freely", Harry answers honestly. He and Cas haven't had the talk about his sexuality yet, but he trusts her and the influence of alcohol also loosens his tongue. "Imagine the saviour of wizarding England prancing through clubs hitting on whoever is to his likings. Skeeter might love to make a headline out of it but currently I don't fancy it as much."
"I don't have to, I credit you with enough sense to know that for yourself. Besides, remorse is not much use in this scenario anyway. It's more a question of how you deal with it now," Hermione lectures Harry.
Harry nods absently. He never had had issues with simple charms like Accio. Especially when the object in question was in such close proximity. Has his wand been just too close?
“No. Certainly not.” Drew hides his face behind his left hand. “Apparently only when I assume I've screwed up already anyway.” Harry feels the urge to reassure him that it's nothing personal, that he is in fact freaking cute, that he himself is just not open to dating. Instead, he smiles vaguely.
“Aw, Harry, come here”, Cas cries out and pulls him into a comforting embrace. Harry did not know that this is exactly what he needed, until he felt the warm of her body through there clothes radiating from where her legs touch his torso, her gentle hands stroking his upper back and arm. For a brief moment, Harry is in a bubble of love and security, far from fears and painful memories.
“Fuck, the polyjuice potion!”, Cas gasps when she concluded what happened next. “You forgot…” Harry’s confirmatory nod shuts her sentence off. He presses his lips together, roaming the room with his gaze in the discomfort of remembering, then releases the pressure with a loud smack of his lips. “Yip, I forgot to take another dose before dozing off.” His grip on his mug tightens. “And awoke looking like I usually do, to a guy who fell asleep to someone else.”
Drew takes the (bloody obvious) hint. Impatiently he also pulls on Harry’s trousers. Harry wraps his legs around Drew’s back so he can lift his ass, and his trousers together with his underwear is gone, flapping audibly on the floor but other than that receives no further notice.
"I like this one", Cas discretely points at a slender young man, bright blond hair tied to a bun, faint of a beard, leaning at a pillar, seemingly checking out the crowd, too.
The next morning, he gets down on his knees in front of his fireplace, and attempts to floocall through to Ron and Hermione. His whole body tingles as he calls out several times into the apparent void.
“Okay, all worries and bad experiences aside. Will you see again?”, Cas shoves away the last traces of his sudden sorrow, and Harry is absolutely grateful to her for that.
This finally puts a smile on Harry’s face. “You’re impossible. I'm surprised you haven't dared me yet to another bet.”
have a company team, which I am in." As he talks Harry’s eyes begin to light up and his words become more energetic, more joyful. He probably wouldn't describe himself as a jock, but a Quidditch-infatuated athlete probably sums it up pretty well.
Caught off guard, he pats her back and lightly joins in her laughter. Her mood is simply infectious, no matter how miserable he feels.
Then he taps around the corner towards where he remembers the kitchenette to be in search of any liquid to moist his throat. Coming from the same direction, he again hears, now lesser faint, "shit"s. They presumably come from the bathroom, of which’s localisation behind a retrospectively erected wall he’s now aware.
Nessja's more frequent gnawing on his finger makes clear, the owl's displeasure with her errand duties. "I'm sorry. Just this once more," Harry reassures her and writes his reply as succinctly as possible
“You know what we say in the Slytherin dorms? Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer. If you’re so afraid of what he might do, better not leave him unobserved.”
“You’re a true devoted friend”, she snickers. After a last short hug, she takes for the fireplace. “Please consider my words, yeah?”, she says at last.
Drew shakes his head in disbelieve about Harry's bluntness but agrees. This time Harry leads. On the way he catches a glimpse of Cas and Falk both giving him thumbs up. It's his first time realizing just how embarrassing they are as a trio. Quickly he shakes these self-deprecating thoughts off, concentrating on the music. And also on Drew, checking him out. His movements are restrained yet smooth. Harry, however, is more of the free spirit type of dancer. Soon he’s absorbed by the music again and the sexually tinged mood has fleeted. While they move and share some casual words they more or less coincidentally keep brushing each other’s body parts from time to time. And the more they talk the more Harry’s attracted on deeper level than just superficial appearance. Drew choses his word wisely, tainting them with intelligence, wit, and a strangely pretentious humbleness. He manages to make a conversation about noisy work mates intriguing. Harry can’t stop himself from sneakily getting more handsy and Drew reciprocates. Luckily. Harry’s getting bolder, driven by his inner maneater that has awoken again. He wraps his hands around Drew’s waist bringing their hips together. There’s no blaming their touches on the dance floors narrowness anymore, this is clearly intentional, and Harry wants Drew to know that. Drew answers by placing his arms loosely on Harry’s shoulders. They keep dancing like that for some time, matching their movements, bit by bit closing the distance between their bodies, slowing down. Drews neck is dangerously close to Harry’s mouth, and he doesn’t hold out for long until he sinks his face in the curve of it, his lips brushing Drews skin, nose greedily sucking in his smell. The neck under his face vibrates with a chuckle. Harry’s torn between looking up and bringing their faces closer or savouring the moment as it is. He decides for the latter and so they keep on dancing entangled as they are. There will be time to make out and ravish each other the whole night long, but this intimate dancing feels almost as if they were here as partners; he can almost pretend he is embracing the most precious person to him, and he closes his eyes to dive deeper into that fantasy, blends out every sense but his tactile. Nonetheless their somewhat rhythmic movements start to stimulate him. A bit too much. Especially in his crotch area. And he’s almost certain he’s not the only one building a tent in his trousers.
Harry felt a warm body sit down beside him, pressed up against his side from shoulder to ankle. It was comforting and familiar and so very
it seemed. No one batted an eyelid, Draco leaned into his side after a few rounds, and Harry couldn’t stop thinking about how much
‘Once I finish up the ink, I’ll cast the charms that make it into a proper wizarding tattoo, giving it movement and tuning it into your emotions and all that. That’s why the charms need time to settle, like Eddie said before? They’re tuned into each witch or wizard’s magical core.’
‘Yes, sir. Thank you for your time,’ Harry murmured, hoping he still managed his most polite and submissive tone. Shoulders drooping, and the beginnings of a huge knot forming in the pits of his stomach, he turned around and left the office.
‘Alright, alright! Honestly, Charlie, how could I forget?’ Harry could feel his eyes shining at the memory of it.
‘Alright, get out of here and go to your emergency. Floo me when you’re done. I’ll most likely be here but if I head home I’ll owl you.’
Wordlessly, Potter handed over the parchment and his quill, and made his way over to a nearby bench to sit and stare into his lap. Draco sat on the same bench, but as far away as he could physically be without falling off.
Harry wasn’t sure what was happening the first time Draco had turned up in the DMLE with a coffee and a toasted three cheese sandwich from his favourite café, until Draco pressed a small kiss to the top of his head, gave a half shrug, and simply said ‘I knew you’d forget lunch.’
! He hadn’t worked so hard at ignoring it for months, just to have Potter’s dancing be the thing to break down his resolve and bring his school time crush back in full force. Mother would never let him live it down. Pansy would never let him live it down. Merlin, even
. On Diagon Alley. You’ve probably seen him around.’ Potter’s cheeks were pink, and he spoke in the smallest voice, looking down at his lap.
‘Just, er, letting you know it wasn’t a date,’ Potter trailed off, suddenly looking very insecure, as though he couldn’t quite believe that he’d just divulged such precious information to a
Opening the back door to the house into the tiny kitchen, Draco called out a greeting to his mother and set about making them both a cup of tea. Their tea rituals had by no means been hampered by the decrease in kitchen size, Draco’s imprisonment, or the noseless megalomaniac that had squatted in their house for two years, and was still very much a staple to their routine.
If Malfoy hadn’t been angry before, he was absolutely furious now; Harry was almost sure he could see steam coming from his ears. However, as quickly as the rage had started, it stopped. Malfoy’s fists unclenched, his jaw slackened, the fire died behind his eyes.
Taking a deep breath, Harry strode up to the apothecary and tore the door open. There were only a few people inside, a couple of customers and a couple of potioneers, but everyone turned around at the noise.
late now. Grabbing his wand and securing it in its holster at his side, Harry took one last look around Grimmauld and its grime, and left through the front door to apparate to Diagon Alley.
‘You didn’t have to bring my home yourself, y’know. I’m sure Robards is pissed that you didn’t hang around the scene.’
The look in Malfoy’s eyes was one of confusion now. ‘What do you mean I don’t have to tell you? If I don’t you can get me thrown back in- into Azkaban.’
‘No that’s not- I wasn’t- Malfoy. I just meant maybe you could make more of an effort to be on time in future?’
Malfoy looked at him wide-eyed. Obviously confused as to why Harry was telling him this. Harry was confused too, why the hell was he telling Malfoy all this? What was it about him that always made him lose focus and lack judgement?
A second, more detailed look reveals to Harry that the choice of plants is also quite deliberate. "Not magical specimens, are they?", gently he strokes the leaves of an ivy hanging from the ceiling right next to him, without hesitation, unlike what he was used to from herbology back in Hogwarts, where each plant represented a particular kind of danger or claim.
Harry decides to walk home. At least for a bit. He needs time and room to think, and fresh air. His thoughts still revolve around the fact that his secret is now no longer guarded only by people he has specified.  That someone completely foreign to him now knows more about him than some of his longest friends. For a brief moment he considers casting a Fidelius Spell, but quickly dismisses the idea.
"Hey Falk, it's me, Harry", he says while poking the other man’s shoulder. He's surprised by his own low raspy voice, having not heard it yet.
"What's wrong with you? Do you think your own judgement of character is so fallible? Or do you have a thing for men, you trust to double-cross you the first chance they get?"
Drew deliberates. “Sure, we could. I thought you’d suggest so. But I fear what suits my taste, cannot be realized with material entities.”
this took longer than expected to write down, sorry (to everyone who's actually following up from the start)
“You know, this is considered sexual harassment?”, Harry utters casually and finally covers his legs with his own trousers again. They are a bit loose, as he already knows them to be around his hips, but, Merlin, does it feel good on his skin, on his mind. Interestingly, the degree of coping-ability of awkward circumstances seems to be in direct connection not only with the amount of clothes you’re wearing but also the ownership of them. Straightening his back, squaring his shoulders Harry regains the needed self-confidence to consider himself sufficiently equipped to survive the situation.
"I didn't accuse him of it in these words. And to be fair, a lot of people would probably do just that, and you know it," Harry defends himself.
“Generous”, Blondie further quips, "So, my performance today determines the further course of this elucidating scientific project?”
"Let him speak, Ron. What have you done, then?" Harry is grateful for Hermione's intervention. Since her training as a mind healer, she has admittedly actually morphed into a wonderful conversationalist and advisor. For the life of him, he wouldn't want to do without Ron's input because of this, but it helps the goal setting to have someone there to follow the conversation on a meta level and guide it if necessary.
"Oy, mate. I thought you called us here, so we can help you out," Ron cries scandalized. "You didn't think I might like to be of assistance? What kind of rubbish do you take my advices for?" Harry hadn't expected a reaction this vehement, even though he knows he has been somewhat neglectful of Ron's attempts at contact in particular over the course of the last week.
Inside Harry scans the gathered crowd, searching for bright blue hair, fair skin, trashy outfit and is soon rewarded. He makes his way through the room towards the bar where he has found his friend leaning on.
"Harry, what the...? You wake up in your ONS's place and the first thing you do is accuse him of trying to sell you to the press?" It doesn't feel pleasant to be paraded like this, even if Harry knows Cas is right.
Exhausted, he leans against the porcelain bowl and a slight sense of depersonalisation creeps in. It's as if Harry is watching himself from the outside, as if he were the amiable but scatter-brained protagonist of a bad sitcom whose only plot is to depict twenty-somethings failing at life so that the same-age target audience can gentrify themselves at the sight of it. Harry snorts at the irony, that it is the kind of gallows humour, he is feeling right now, that the characters in such shows then usually employ. Oh, what a cliche he is portraying right now.
After Cas had visited him, he had to let what had been discussed sink in. By the time a floo call from Ron and Hermione in the evening corrected him that everything was fine, and they had merely stopped by the Burrow on the spur of the moment, Harry's willingness to revisit the subject had already been successfully overshadowed by his eager endeavours to write off what has happened as a closed topic and thus no longer relevant.
“You know this screams set-up, right?”, Harry lifts an eyebrow. He wouldn’t be too surprised if the first reporter owls arrived any second. Ill-humoured Harry wishes he hadn’t taken that hangover potion and was still blessed with limited cognitive capacity. Instead he has the full pleasure of holistic awareness of the situation and consequent annoyance, PLUS a painful knot in his head.
"Hey, I'm still sitting here too," Harry snaps irritated. He appreciates his closest friends, since he knows he can always confide in them, but unfortunately, they also know him best and demonstrate his shortcomings a little too clearly from time to time.
"Well then, I'm first", Cas crosses his plans and is no second later on her way to Blondie, as Harry decides to call him until further elucidation.
Harry shakes his head, and Cas looks both relieved and disappointed. "Hi... Harry then", hesitating, "This feels so wrong", she adds laughing.
"But that's exactly where the crucial difference lies. I thought all that prevented you from dating until now was that you didn't know how to safely out yourself. Now that you've been relieved of that part, nothing stands in the way, or am I too stupid to recognise more obstacles?"
“Staircase? Where to?”, he asks forehead wrinkled, looking up warily, and it’s then the first time he realizes, not all of the space above the wooden beams is emptiness up to the roof. It’s difficult to see from the main room level, because of the beams and a large lamp installation in the kitchen area, but there is indeed another kind of room right above the bathroom.
Harry stills nonplussed. "Drew?", he repeats hesitantly. The thought, that he himself might not want to be seen either, occurs with delay. The thought, that such an act would be in vain because he has already been seen, follows even later. Harry's headache intensifies. He wishes he could floo Hermione. She’d know what to do, how to proceed. For a short moment he looks out for a fireplace and actually sees one across the room, but settles with sliding down the wall to the bathroom, and waiting for Drew to come out. Seeking the talks seems to be inevitable anyway, if Harry at least wants to try and repair what damage can still be repaired.
"Mhm. It's okay. I'll finish getting dressed, and then I'll be on my way." Harry strokes through his hair, which unlike Drew's is sticking wildly off his head, unkempt, fresh out of bed. The desire for his own four walls, his bathroom, intensifies.
Heart pounding, he knots the letter to Siora's foot. "Can you deliver this message to Drew for me?" he asks, unnecessarily guarded. Worried about what he might set off with this message, he feels a heaviness attached to the letter, he thinks it a big ask to burden Siora with. But the bird only chirps softly, unimpressed by the light weight of the note.
Falk laughed. "Don't worry, you'll get your share tonight if you’re so eager to." He turns around and orders some drinks for them both. "How was your day?"
"Take me to yours.” He can’t believe his own forwardness; his lower body must have taken over. But before he can row back the uncomfortable sensation of being forced through a tube implies Drew’s consent to no longer dawdle.
Harry blinks, still putting two plus two together. “No, uhh, I’m sorry. I actually hoped to conjure my own.” Has his spell been ambiguous? Was that even a thing? He clearly had
Wincing as he moved to leave, Draco cursed Potter and wondered exactly how his mother would react when he asked her to cast a stinging counter jinx at his arse.
If Andromeda could have fluttered her eyelashes like a schoolgirl to convince him here, Harry was sure she would have. Luckily for them both, Harry needed no convincing when it came to spending time with his godson.
But the ill-fitting muggle top wasn’t the only thing that caught Draco’s eye. No, it was the fresh looking protective film that was wrapped around Potter’s left wrist, only visible where the sleeve had ridden up.
‘No.’ The word came out slightly hoarse, as if Draco was all of a sudden finding it difficult to breath, but Harry ignored it, figuring that Draco was just being his usual dramatic self.
‘Oh. Well that’s useless.’ Draco gave a small laugh at that, and Harry felt his spirit soar at the sound. ‘I can help you with it later if you’d like?’
healthy tan with only a hint of sunburn across Ron’s nose. Mione must’ve had him bathing in suncream for him to have escaped with no lobster sunburn. Harry smiled back at his best friends.
No one else could make his cup of tea just right, or knew when to make him coffee instead. No one else would share a Hawaiian pizza with him. No one else could make him cry with laughter at just a look. No one else knew to cheer him up with Drew Barrymore films and takeaway Chinese food after a bad case. No one knew he still took potions to help him sleep after nightmares, sometimes. Potions that Draco brewed himself. No one else made Harry feel so safe and looked after and-
‘Oh. Erm. Habit, I guess? He’s always called me Po- erm, my surname, and I’ve always called him Malfoy. It’s just a habit at this point. It would feel weird to call him anything else.’
‘Really, Potter. Why am I here suffering through this infernal meeting if you won’t even dignify me with your undivided attention? I had been trying to answer your question regarding employment, but you seemed to doze off. Is the subject of my employ so boring to you? You’d think the ministry would be most interested to know the jobs of their Death Eaters, no? Honestly it’s like you expected me to fail. Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you so, but I've been working there a few weeks now. Did my first tattoo yesterday.’
Potter looked down at a wrist watch. ‘We’ve still got half an hour, I’m not supposed to let you leave before we’ve had the full time. So I guess we’ll just sit here and enjoy each other’s company?’
‘Hmm. I think I remember? It’s all very vague. Not that memorable at all if I’m honest,’ Harry drifted off.
As Potter had stood and scooped up Edward, to put the tiny monster to bed, Draco took the time to get those horrid emotions back in check. He could not be dealing with another crush on
Although Harry knew this must mean that somewhere out there, in an alternate universe, there must have been a Draco Malfoy who was stubborn, mean, and so set in his ways that no one could talk him out of it. Mindsets like that lead to wars, or worse.
An uncomfortable pit had settled into Harry’s stomach at the thought of seeing Malfoy so broken and vulnerable. It unsettled him. In the decade they’d known each other, Malfoy had never appeared anything less than perfectly put together, completely in control of how he presented himself to the rest of the world. Harry’s visit to Azkaban prison was something he had tried very hard to obliviate, without magic, from his memory.
‘Potter offered, mum! It would’ve been more rude to snub him and leave. You raised me better than that.’ Draco knew that bringing up the countless lessons in societal niceties that he had been subjected to - not to mention the doddery old Mister Twyford who came with them - was a bit of a low blow, and a particularly daring move to partake in whilst drunk and Narcissa was already royally pissed at him.
And with that, Harry was alone at his table once again, not entirely sure how he had just participated in the past fifteen minutes of conversation but not upset either way.
‘You can’t say that and then join in, Ronald,’ Hermione chastised, but there was no malice in her voice and Harry could feel her smile through the masses of her hair.
‘Exactly. Now, what happened to him - his trauma - is his to tell and I can’t share it, patient confidentiality and all that, but he’s also my friend and he trusts me more than he trusts almost anyone at this point. If he trusts you enough then he’ll tell you, but for now, just know that he’s doing the best that he can, alright?’
’ Ron shouted the last two words, causing at least five people in the shop to turn around and glare at them. Harry even saw one mother put her hands over the ears of her son (but he was looking at the WWW brand fireworks, so Harry wasn’t too sure what she was hoping to achieve by protecting her son from Ron’s shouting when he clearly had his sights set on much louder noises).
It surprised no one, then, when Malfoy became Draco and Potter became Harry, and the two ex-worst enemies became friends.
Harry was getting really sick and tired of these mis-dates with Draco now. He’d tried no less than five times now, all with devastating failure and general awkwardness, as the boy he was in love with remained entirely oblivious to his attempts at wooing.
Harry was reeling, how could this be happening? How could Malfoy possibly have got a job at the tattoo parlour he was booked into for Sunday afternoon? An appointment he’d had booked for weeks, still having to pluck up insane amounts of courage just to take a trip down Diagon Alley. And now supposedly Malfoy would be there too? Watching him?
you,’ he shuddered, ‘but you couldn’t get me as a backup even if you paid me all the chocolate frogs in the world.’
Taking a deep breath and smoothing down any creases that might have taken hold in his shirt, Harry walked over (un)calmly to open the door.
Potter sat back down on the sofa, much closer than he had been when they’d been watching the film with Edward between them. In fact, if he got any closer their legs would be touching.
grace his own. It was mostly Draco, Potter just let it happen, and that wasn’t a fact that escaped Draco’s notice very easily.
And if Draco cried himself to sleep feeling so thoroughly rejected by his best friend and love of his life, well, Harry couldn’t hear it over the sound of his own thoughts whirring away through the night.
Harry knew that Draco found it hard. In the seven years since the end of the war and the beginning of their friendship, Harry had learnt how to read past every layer of the pureblood mask that Draco put up. Publicly, Draco was back where he started; muttered comments as he walked down the street, and general suspicion that he was up to something Dark with the Saviour.
It didn’t make it any easier on him with the knowledge that he had to have been about the worst first date in the history of first dates, but Sam had still blushed and flustered and invited Harry in for a nightcap three times in a row. They hadn’t shared more than a few chaste kisses, but Harry figured after so long out of the game he could be excused for such poor romancing skills. Either that, or he really had to start getting paranoid about Sam’s motives to make Harry his rubbish boyfriend, and he really would be an outrageously rubbish boyfriend if his current mood carried on any longer.
part two here we go! this was the scene that gave me the initial idea so I'm v happy to finally reach it, but don't worry, I have so many more plans for these boys.... enjoy!
But Draco never got to finish whatever he had been about to say, as his flatmate Seamus bounded up to them and latched himself around Harry’s shoulders, closely followed by another flatmate, Dean.
‘Oh, c’mon Draco!’ Harry shook Draco’s arm gently. ‘We don’t need to act any different, just hold hands here and there. Maybe you could smile nicely at me once in a while.’
Andi had been having - what can only be assumed as long and in depth, if one knew what purebloods were like - discussions about his relations with Ma- Draco? And they thought that Harry and Draco should be friends? What could the chances be of this coming off the back of Draco’s friend Patch at the weekend, encouraging Harry to start calling him
Draco turned back around to settle into his seat before the film started and Harry tried to do the same, but one glance from Ron on the other side of him was enough to know that there was absolutely no hope of him being able to convincingly react whilst Draco was sat next to him.
Sure Malfoy had caught him completely by surprise with the sudden kiss, and his shock had meant that perhaps he hadn’t reacted in the best way, but Malfoy had gone from eyes filled with lust to eyes filled with rage and Harry couldn’t quite figure out what he’d done so wrong.
Harry wasn’t sure how he managed to stumble his way over to where Draco was sitting - a vision of white in a sea of green - but he seemed to blink and he’d arrived. He heard nothing, couldn’t move his eyes from Draco’s face. He didn’t register when Ron put a hand on his shoulder, didn’t register anything the Healers were saying; there could’ve been a second attack and Harry wouldn’t have noticed. All of his focus was on Draco.
Sighing to himself, with yet another one of the ministry’s dirt coffees in his hand as he made his way to his office, Harry resigned himself to yet another horribly uncomfortable hour of just him and Malfoy and Malfoy’s annoying new habit of flirting
Although it wasn’t as though he could compare it to himself very fairly; he had, after all, just got out of wizard prison after 3 years. Sure, he’d managed to put back on most of the weight he’d lost - his mother and Mipsy had been hell-bent on feeding him all and any food they could force down his throat since his early release 6 months ago, it was enough for anyone to regain pre-megalomaniac weight. But there was still no way he could compare to the
‘Stinging jinxes?’ Potter seemed shocked, like Draco wasn’t a dirty, evil death eater that deserved to rot in Azkaban like the rest of them, ‘who was it?’
Draco was only a little over two minutes late by the time Harry’s eyes flicked up to the door to watch him walk in, only he wasn’t alone.
‘Fuck Robards, honestly. And Ron gets it, he can take plenty of notes for the both of us. Merlin, it’s like you didn’t expect me to care that you got hurt.’
Malfoy stayed silent, looking back down at Harry’s wrist as he continued with the antlers of the stag. Only the buzz of the tattoo gun filled the gap between them now, but Harry didn’t feel as though the silence was uncomfortable. If anything, he felt the most comfortable he’d felt with Malfoy since their meeting in Madame Malkin’s robe shop when they were eleven.
Hermione was laughing at him. Wide-mouth, eyes squeezed shut, laughing at him. ‘Harry, love, I know what you think you believe, but we’ve all been waiting for
I took christmas/new years 'off' and spent it with my family in lockdown so this one took me a little longer than usual, but I'm back now & hopefully gonna get back into the swing of solidifying plots and actually writing this fic lol
It had also helped when Ginny had gone for a trial with the Holyhead Harpies in the September following the final battle, and then again when they had - understandably - loved her and invited her to join the team with immediate effect. It was the exact distraction that Ginny needed to quietly grieve for Fred, move on from Harry (and Harry on from her, but there had been no upset feelings in their mutual split), and try to continue with the rest of her life now that the war was over.
‘Har har, let’s just try and get through your probation period and then we’ll never have to see each other again. Right, so you’ve got another six months before your parole is over and we have to meet once a week to keep everything in check, so… are there any days that you’d prefer? Wednesdays and Thursdays are best for me, or Friday evenings, or we could maybe do even the weekend if you can’t do it during the week? Although not Saturday evenings, and you’re supposed to have some form of employment - do you? If not I’ve got all sorts of leaflets and flyers you could look at - here’s one,’ Harry handed him

So far, unless Harry’s had revision for an exam or paperwork for cases, he hadn’t missed a single one. He knew that if he Floo-called Ron and Hermione with ten - scratch that,
Almost instantly, at least fifteen different ways to make Potter even more uncomfortable flitted through Draco’s mind, each not good enough and yet even more satisfying than the last. Just how far would Draco be able to push Potter before he snapped? Before he saw that familiar fire behind his eyes and those infernal glasses? The fire that had driven him throughout all his years at Hogwarts, and reminded him there was life waiting for him on the other side of Az-
had taken advantage of Potter and broken his heart into tiny smithereens. And for what? Because he fancied his name?
It did seem, however, that Potter could tell just how awful this extended silence between them was. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco could see Potter fidgeting in his chair, running his hands through that bird's nest he called hair, and his eyes darting between Draco and absolutely anything else.
Draco tried (and failed) not to long for the life he had always dreamed of; sat having breakfast with his wife - although
? It was Draco’s turn to narrow his eyes now, where had that bloody come from? It seemed that Potter had noticed his slip up, too, if the attractive light dusting of pink across his cheeks was anything to go by.
! If you have to know, I was seeing this guy who I thought was really nice but it turns out he’s a massive creep and only fancied me for my name and my scar and now I have to find a new coffee shop.’
Harry was sure he must be irritating everyone around him by bouncing his leg so much, but he just couldn’t help it. Draco was the man of his dreams, his soulmate, the love of his life, and Harry was allowed to be nervous before their first date, goddamnit! Checking his watch, Harry cursed his nerves making him turn up almost twenty minutes early, but it had allowed him to get a drink in before Draco arrived, and calm his nerves, even if just a little.
That absolute waste of space just down from the parlour on Diagon Alley. All full of light and plants and nice, soft things. It made Draco feel sick every time he thought of it. And now he evidently had yet another reason to avoid it. This... this
Before he even had time to blink, his face was full of bushy brown hair. Harry smiled and closed his eyes, breathing in the familiar scent of cinnamon of his best friend as he wrapped his arms around her.
‘Eloquent as always, Mister Malfoy.’ Potter replied, a smirk on his lips but his eyes wide and cautious, echoing the phrasing that Draco so often loved to taunt him with, like he was afraid of what Draco would think of him.
There was an indifferent sneer on Draco’s face at the sight of Harry, and it made his heart squeeze in a painful way.
‘Wh- where are you going?’ said Potter, breathlessly, still wiping tears from his eyes from his oh-so-funny fit of laughter.
Draco grinned and leaned over, nuzzling his head into Harry’s neck and bringing his hand up to grip onto the t-shirt Harry was wearing. It took all of Harry’s concentration to not bury his nose into the soft hair brushing against his cheek and take a deep breath of Draco’s citrusy shampoo.
Harry’s eyes widened at that. Andi’s sister was Narcissa Malfoy, who was obviously the mother of Draco; a connection that he conveniently
Harry’s eyes flicked up at him at that. He had known, of course, that the only person Draco would have any notions of seeing would have been his father, and that there was no chance of Draco ever wanting to see his father again, but still. He had to ask. It was on his list.
Potter blushed furiously at this, Draco was pleased to see. He’d decided on playing a new, decidedly enjoyable game he had come up with, one that involved exciting an exact combination of (what he hoped was) arousal and fury in one Harry James Potter, and Draco was - unsurprisingly - the most qualified player.
‘Yeah,’ Draco breathed at him, leaning heavily into Harry’s side. Only, Draco winced as Harry helped him lay down on the sofa, his hand moving to press against his side.
‘No shit, Potter, the inside of one’s wrist is a very private place.’ Grey eyes flicked back up to meet him.
to Draco’s birthday party after what had happened, and what had been revealed through the conversation they had had there. Harry’s mind had been going over and over what could have possibly happened to Draco that was something unable to be healed by skele-gro or chocolate frogs and, short of some kind of mental abuse, he was coming up blank.
Harry stood there in shock. Draco, his best friend, was gay and had never told him. And had also never told him that he’d been
Harry threw his hands up, conceding, ‘Alright, but I promise it’s urgent,’ and backed out of the office.
‘Well as you can see, Potter,’ he gestured to the wizard sitting in front of him, ‘I am otherwise engaged. So,
Sam tensed up again, eyes widened, and knuckles decidedly a little whiter around the handle of his drink. Harry cleared his throat, he was suddenly much
Luckily for him, the tell-tale silver platinum of Draco’s hair would stick out anywhere, and drew Harry to it like a moth to a flame.
‘I look after him every Thursday evening so his grandmother can go to her book club. It’s no trouble really, he’s only three and I can put a film on and he goes straight to sleep. Unless it’s
broke him. Yes, you act as a reminder for that, but you were never a cause of the pain so it’s not your job to feel guilty for that, but the reminder hurts him. And when he’s hurt or he’s feeling uncomfortable or insecure or whatever, he lashes out. He tries to make everyone around him feel uncomfortable as well, to distract from himself. I don’t know how that’s manifested itself around you, but I’ll bet you’ve felt uncomfortable?’ Harry nodded his head. ‘Thought so. It’s not personal, Harry, it’s a coping mechanism. I’ve been working with him for three and a half years now, but we’re only just starting to make some progress.’
Having said his piece, Draco turned back to resolutely continue being ignored by the brunet. He most certainly did not expect said brunet to suddenly lunge at him and wrap his arms around his neck and start sobbing into his shoulder.
‘Of course. Take your time.’ Harry turned to the barista in front of him with a smile. ‘Two large hot chocolates please.’
Draco and Potter had been walking aimlessly around Hyde Park in silence for forty-five minutes now, and Draco was beginning to think that they were a little lost. Despite Potter’s grunting assurances that he knew exactly where he was.
at last week’s meeting, I’m gonna have to ask you to stop. And possibly never mention them again. Yep. most definitely. Please do not mention them again.’
What the sodding Minister was doing slumming it down in the DMLE for, Harry had no clue. Nor was he going to ask. Nope. No siree.
” and spun away into the night, leaving Potter to stare at the empty fireplace, wondering exactly where exactly he’d learnt to be so stupid - and read all the signs wrong - to have it all go so wrong so quickly.
The two boys sat in a comfortable silence for a few moments, taking the first few hot sips of their drinks. Their eyes met over their cups and Draco grinned at him. ‘I saw that barista wink at you,’
‘Oh, sorry.’ Draco looked up. ‘I assumed you’d want to go over chemistry over anything else? Since we’re both in that. Shit, sorry, you wanted to just do our own stuff didn’t you?’
Still smiling to himself, and well aware that he must look a complete and utter fool for it, Harry made his way over to one of the tables for two next to the big window at the front of the coffee shop.
‘P-,’ he began, obviously not wanting to share, but the technicalities of parole meant that, legally, he had no choice.
It seemed that Harry had been able to render Draco speechless; a feat that should go down in at least one history book, maybe two or three. That was that issue sorted then, he didn’t know why he’d been so worried just now! He’d let Draco down gently, reminded them both of what their relationship was and how it definitely
Harry sobered at this slightly, sighing. Resigned. He knew this was the reason for Ron’s overgenerous gesture of buying their many rounds of drinks, that he’d been waiting for Harry to lower his defences before broaching this topic again. He felt betrayed, slightly, at the fact that Hermione had given such strict instructions to Ron, yet hadn’t felt the need to ask him herself. The pair of them hadn’t exactly been subtle in their disappointment that he had insisted upon going straight into a Ministry job rather than back to Hogwarts to finish his education, like they had both done after the rebuilding of it in the summer.  If anything, he’d have thought that going out and beginning the career that the whole wizarding world expected of him would have them
‘Oh please, as if you had much choice anyway. You and I both know that my mother most likely threatened to have your bollocks if you didn’t show your face.’
‘Right Harry, I have to ask, ‘Mione’ll kill me if I don’t, you know she’d be here if McGonagall didn’t have her helping the firsties, hates it when she misses your visits, you never visit enough she says, anyway she wanted me to talk to you see? Get a feel of how you’re doing, and -’
Harry cringed, was he really so easy to read? Rather than meeting her steely gaze, Harry turned to concentrate on his godson and began helping him spoon the whipped cream from the top of his hot chocolate into his mouth.
- for everything Draco Malfoy might want to give him, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge the million and one rational reasons why he shouldn’t give in to that anymore.
Draco felt a light push to his chest and his eyes snapped open. Potter was laughing at him. He’d teased him and pushed him away.
, and Harry had gone in for the kill. He was lucky, really, that Myrtle had screamed bloody murder (and she’d have been right on that count) and Snape had heard her. Harry had never felt so sorry for his worst enemy.
Harry was snapped out of his thoughts by Kingsley yanking the door open again, winking at Harry, and then marching straight past before Harry could even think the word “quidditch”.
what Harry had done in the months between the end of the war and the beginning of Auror training, which in itself coincided nicely with all of the people left to nag at him returning to Hogwarts in September).
‘Don’t make me repeat myself, Harry, dear. It was just before Draco was released from Azkaban, and I suppose Cissa was feeling nostalgic about family. We’ve been exchanging owls for just over four months now.’
All other events, be it the fortnightly pub night with Ron and Hermione (although he manages to duck out of those when he can think of a convincing enough excuse, not often, but he does), or the occasional Sunday roast at the Burrow with all five hundred members of the Weasley extended family (okay, maybe there was only thirty people at most, and those lunches were much easier to duck out of, but he still makes an effort to go on special occasions, Molly would never forgive him if he didn’t), manage to blur into one and be forgotten about as soon as they occur.
Taking out his mobile, Draco immediately set about swapping his Monday shift with the girl Ivy’s for the following afternoon. Oh yes, if Harry Potter was getting a tattoo at

Draco vividly remembers handing over the creamy envelope before they had sat down to watch the film. ‘Yes… I gave it to him.’
Ron whirls back around to look at Harry again, cross examining every single micro-feature, every twitch in his gestures, and whatever he seems to find in Harry’s face satisfies him somewhat.
Harry opened his eyes and caught a glimpse of fiery ginger before his other best friend joined the death grip Harry was currently victim to.
Downing the rest of his drink, Harry grimaced at the hint of nausea the alcohol was beginning to give him. If only he hadn’t invited Malfoy to stay and watch bloody
Harry rocked backwards and forwards on his heels, hands clasped together in front of him. The witch - Janice - was watching him as he did so, her eyes narrowed slightly and her arms across her chest as she began to file her nails. Harry could just
Watching the machine splutter out the most pathetic excuse for coffee Harry had ever had the misfortune of tasting, he scolded himself for not leaving with enough time to swing by his favourite coffee shop on the way in. Not only was he now missing out on some actually nice-tasting bean water, he happened to have found out - via his second favourite barista
Draco knew, of course, that when it came to Patch, he was guilty of wearing rose-tinted glasses, but these things tend to develop when that one face is the only nice one in three years.
‘The usual?’ Sam was already bustling about with shots of espresso, chocolate, and steaming up some milk.
With a brief hiatus in Weasley management in the direct aftermath of the fighting whilst George grieved for Fred, the shop came back stronger than ever. Even more so once Ron joined the team with his business qualifications from the Open University and the NEWTs he somehow passed from Hogwarts. It had helped them all immensely when George had stumbled upon a hidden notebook full of half-brained crazy schemes for new inventions that Fred had apparently been working on alongside his inventions with George, and with a few small amendments, the products had exploded into their very own range within the store. Even from beyond the grave, Fred was still helping them out and making sure pranks were being pulled with the utmost finesse. Harry was sure that McGonagall was rueing the tears she’d shed at the funeral with every WWW product she confiscated in the halls of Hogwarts.
all inspiration just left me and for that I am sorry, but I shall stick by these idiotic boys until their story is finished, I owe them that much. I DID however find the motivation for a teeny tiny one shot called 'was this a date' of our fave HP/DM in the muggle world so go give that a read if you fancy!
he should say, other than his waste-of-space father and Moldy the Wart, because only Merlin fucking knows what they subjected him to for the first seventeen years of his life. So a little bit more abuse in prison could have only been expected by the poor bloke, right?
‘-and we ended up having a couple of drinks, yeah? And then- well. I’m not really sure how it happened, but he kissed me?’
‘It is when it’s combined with his skin being dyed green, love. Everyone knows George likes to test out new products on himself and they don’t want to risk that those ones might already be on the shelves.’
‘Piss off, you know what I meant. Anyway, this was just supposed to be a quick meeting; you meeting your parole officer, me meeting my parolee… Merlin knows what Robards was thinking, pairing us together. I guess we just figure out a schedule for now and try not to kill each other for the fiftieth time this decade.’
‘I am indeed, call me Patch, though, please. P is reserved strictly for Draco, I’m afraid. You must be “arsehole parole officer”?’
!’ Hermione interrupted him again, her expression was verging on murderous and Harry was absolutely almost terrified.
, Harry willed himself. Focusing on blue eyes instead of grey, dirty blond hair instead of platinum, small and slight instead of long and lean. If he concentrated hard enough, Harry could almost convince himself. Almost.
Harry allowed Ron’s voice to fade into the background, nodding and making the appropriate noises when he paused in tales of how the past few months of his eighth year at Hogwarts was going. Harry needed this, he needed some semblance of normality, the mindless gossip of eighth-year Hogwarts. The daydream of a Hogwarts that never had to bear witness to the horrors of the Battle, of his own childhood and time at Hogwarts not being tainted by the relentless threat of Voldemort and his dumb Death Eaters year after year. Missing Hogwarts was perhaps even the worst of it, the thought of all of his friends having gone back to school for their final (and probably most
