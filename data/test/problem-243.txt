Draco’s back arches and his mouth opens on a long, wordless cry, as his cock throbs in Harry’s hand and he shudders out his release, which spatters across his belly. For a long moment, the silence of the room is broken only by Draco’s gasping breaths. Harry sits back on his heels, grinning, and waits.
“Ground-breaking research from Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispers. “Sex is even better when it’s with someone you love. Extra extra, read all about it.”
“Don’t wanna,” Draco mumbles, knowing full well that he’s being ridiculously dramatic, but he’s reached that stage of tipsiness where his filters have gone down, and they’ve gone down hard.
“Good?” Draco asks quietly and feeling as daring as he ever has, reaches over to trace his thumb up the line of Harry’s hard cock. Harry throws his head back and cries out.
Now they’re here, in Harry’s bedroom, sprawled across Harry’s very comfortable and expensive mattress. Draco can’t help but notice that Harry’s put clean sheets on the bed and tidied the room. Flowers on the dresser. When he’d opened the door to his bedroom, Harry had waved a hand, and candles had burst into flame, leaving Draco to wonder when, exactly, Harry had decided he was ready. He’s set a romantic scene, that’s all Draco’s saying.
He grabs the clothes that Keely’s laid out for him and smiles when he sees Harry do the same. Somehow Keely always knows. Draco’s dying to know how she does it, but he’s pretty sure this is not the year he’ll be given that information. Probably not next year either.
They stare at each other for a moment. Harry manages to extract his arms from the cocoon of blankets he’s created for himself, and wraps them around Draco to pull him close as they settle back amongst the pillows.
“Hermione,” he says, and Hermione holds him even closer, and he can feel the way her body shakes as she weeps. “This isn’t the way it’s supposed to end.”
so that the door she’s tried to push closed behind her remains ajar. Draco looks about but there’s no one else in the corridor, so he leans against the wall and listens.
He then reaches up and whispers, “Lift up a second,” and as Harry does, Draco eases his joggers and pants down until Harry can wiggle out of them and kick them to the side. Draco manages to get Harry out of his shirt with only minimal structural damage to the garment, and then Harry collapses back onto the lounge, gloriously naked and clearly self-conscious about it.
bad about this, about getting off to Malfoy’s getting off without Malfoy knowing, but right now, he just feels so fucking
“A note,” Malfoy says, lining them up perfectly and starting to rock his hips. “Check my back pocket.”
Like a week ago, when Draco had been heading to the showers after a late night of studying and he’d run into Potter, literally. They’d done that awkward dance where Draco had gone right just as Potter had gone left, and then the reverse, and Potter had laughed that warm chuckle that always feels like it’s winding itself deep into Draco’s heart, and then Potter had put his hand on Draco’s shoulder to hold him still and the towel had slipped and Potter had said, “Oh no, my towel!” with another of those laughs and he hadn’t broken eye contact with Draco at all, not once.
For right now, though, he’ll lie here with Harry, safe and secure, because he knows. He knows that he loves and is loved. He knows that in the end, that’s all there really is. They roll over, and Draco falls asleep to the sound of Harry’s heartbeat, strong and sure.
exactly. Draco’s learned that lesson, thank you very much. Instead, he spends a lot of time walking briskly from here to there, wearing nice robes and acting as if he’s two minutes late for a very important meeting. He’s figured out that when you act 1) like you’re entirely uninterested in what’s going on around you and 2) like you have every right to be where you are, even if you really don’t, well, sometimes you can pick up some interesting information.
“Harry Potter,” the Bottle says (and unlike the Sorting Hat, everyone can hear this), “Truth or Dare?”
“I look at you a lot,” Harry whispers, as if confessing something secret and hidden. “I always want to look at you.”
“I look at you too,” Draco says, and reaches up, drags his knuckles down Harry’s cheek and across his mouth. “So much, Harry. You don’t even know.”
“It’s like a constellation, but of energy rather than stars. I can see the boundaries of the land. The manor glows at the centre of it. And our other properties and holdings, they’re all linked, regardless of distance. I can get a sense of where there might be issues.”
He’s hard, so hard against where Harry is hard too, and it’s so agonizingly hot that Harry thinks he may just die from this. Or come. Or come and then die. Death by orgasm.
Soon, there aren’t many left standing. Harry glances down to realize his whole body is alight, as if he’s wreathed by lightning, and he is incandescent in his rage and fear. He thinks vaguely that he should be trying to preserve the scene, but all he can manage to do at this point is pull back from unleashing a lethal level of power.
“That sounds good to me,” Draco says into Harry’s hair, and lets himself drift, knowing he’ll be cursing himself in the morning for not cleaning them up, but there’s nothing that could take him away from Harry, and he figures, he’ll deal with it in the morning.
Harry breathes, rolls toward him, slings one arm heavy across Draco’s chest. He’s warm and solid in the dark, and his arm feels nice across Draco’s chest. He feels Harry’s hand pressing into the cold skin of his shoulder, Harry’s thumb tracing the ledge of his collarbone.
“You won’t,” Draco says, knowing the conviction he’s feeling is evident in his tone. “I know you won’t. Harry, I…”
“Not that this isn’t great, Potter, but I think we’re going to need to do a bit more to, err, devirginise us.” He frowns, looking thoughtful. “Actually, it’s an interesting question, isn’t it?”
It’s never, ever felt like this. Harry feels like he’s been hit by lightning, like his skin is on fire. Like his spine has liquified and pure desire has replaced the blood in his veins. His knees are weak, and his hands are shaking as he reaches up to trace the line of Malfoy’s jaw.
“Oh fuck, that’s not a unicorn.” He abruptly changes direction, bolting off the path away from the whatever it is, calling over his shoulder, “Potter, come on,
. Potter has seen the way Draco looks at him when he thinks Potter isn’t looking back, and he knows about Draco’s terribly embarrassing and inconvenient feelings. Draco closes his eyes against the humiliation of it all.
It’s much easier going with the light, and even though Harry knows this is dangerous, he can’t help falling into something of a trance as they walk along. He’s lost all track of time when Malfoy stops suddenly and holds up his hand.
By now he and Malfoy have drawn up next to the forest, and by unspoken agreement, they both stop. Harry bites his lip and sighs.
. He clearly trims the hair around his prick, and it looks good, thick and oddly enticing. Harry frowns into the invisibility cloak. What is happening to him? Why is the sight of Malfoy’s cock, soft and heavy between his muscular thighs, so intriguing?
“Drink that,” she says, “and then off to bed with you. I don’t want to see you or Mr Harry before noon tomorrow.”
Through the woods now, alongside the lake, whose inky black surface sparkles with the reflection of stars. One step, then another. The land interweaves its magic with Draco’s, and he feels it grab hold, tighter and tighter, the closer he comes to completing the circle. He always wants to rush this part, but he’s learned that this is when it’s most important to slow down and take his time.
an erogenous zone. He yanks Malfoy even closer, and Malfoy returns the favor by planting both hands firmly on Harry’s ass and squeezing.
Malfoy snorts, and Harry looks over to find Malfoy looking at him sheepishly, one hand rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco listens to Harry breathe in the dark, lying next to him in their bed. Draco knows he’s not sleeping. He also knows it’s not “their” bed. It’s Harry’s bed. Harry’s flat. Draco lives somewhere else, though he also knows, of course, that he’s most alive here. Draco’s got his own side of the bed, his books stacked on his bedside table, and Harry sets out a glass of water for him every night.
Harry nods frantically and then reaches down, pausing Draco’s movements. “Too good. Just. Fuck, hold on a moment.”
“Unicursal, it means there’s just one path to the center, and then you take the same path out. You can’t get lost.” Potter tosses Draco a quick grin over his shoulder. “They’re for walking meditation.”
It gets heated quickly, Draco grinding down, Harry rolling his hips up as they kiss. Draco tastes of coffee and sugar, and something about the weight of his body on Harry’s is grounding. Harry feels
His hand speeds up, and he leans over and braces himself with the other one, watching the way Harry’s eyes widen and his mouth opens.
, and he certainly can’t imagine getting intimate with someone he doesn’t know, just for the sake of it. He’s not waiting for love and it’s not that he’s saving himself for anyone in particular, it’s more, he can’t fathom being that vulnerable with someone he doesn’t trust not to sell him out, and pretty much every person who fits that description is in the room with him right now.
“The Dare is this,” the Bottle says. “Draco Malfoy will go with Harry Potter to a place of their choosing, immediately, and Draco Malfoy will bring Harry Potter to orgasm at least once.”
“Off,” Draco says, sounding overwhelmed, now pulling his own shirt over his head and tossing it aside. “Fucking take this
Draco throws one arm over his eyes, chest heaving as Harry slides lower. Harry’s hands land on Draco’s hips and he reaches to undo the button of Draco’s jeans.
Harry climbs down. They’re still well out of reach of the scortátus, but Malfoy’s found a nice, broad limb, sheltered from the wind. Harry slides down next to him, and they try to figure out how to get situated. It’s wide enough that one person sitting would feel quite safe, but not wide enough for two men to sit side by side. Finally Malfoy sighs. He moves into position, sitting with his back against the tree trunk, and lets his legs fall open.
He gives Draco a long lick, root to tip, and Draco has to sink his hands into the armrests of his chair and tries not to shout as Harry swallows him down. Draco is somewhat thankful that he’s sitting down, even if it is at his desk at work, because he knows his legs would not be holding him up right now, had he been standing.
Harry looks a little dazed and his hands slide around to grab Draco’s ass and pull him into a grind that’s downright filthy. They move together, the mattress creaking under them until Draco suddenly freezes, rolls himself off Harry, panting, and presses one hand hard to his dick.
“Fuck,” Draco breathes as Harry gasps and shakes, finally batting away Draco’s hand with a hiss. “That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
“Hey,” Draco reaches up to cup Harry’s jaw. “Wait a minute. Are you okay? We don’t have to do anything you don't want to, Harry, it’s really okay.”
Draco retaliates by leaning in and pressing a hot, open-mouthed kiss to the tender skin just behind Harry’s ear and Harry feels his cock jump in response. Thankfully, it’s their turn to step behind the wards, and ignoring the disapproval of the others behind them, Harry wraps both arms around Draco and lets him apparate them away.
And with that, Harry heads upstairs and Draco bundles up to go walk the property lines. Thankfully the house elves have their own magic and have cleared the path for him, so all he has to do is walk down the long driveway and turn left when he gets to the road.
From there, it’s another round of shots and then they’re all roped into playing Spin the Truth or Dare Bottle. Everyone squeezes in around the coffee table and Harry finds himself squashed up against Malfoy, close enough to feel the heat of his lean thigh and catch the scent of his aftershave, something woodsy and spicy. He smells like a man, Harry thinks, dazed.
Whatever it is, Draco knows, he likes it. More than likes it, if he’s being honest with himself. Whatever it is, Draco knows, he’ll do anything to keep it.
They quickly strip down, folding their clothes and setting them aside. Keely’s left fresh towels piled on the shelf by the door into the sauna, and he can see by the steam on the window that it’s already hot inside. When Draco opens the door to the sauna, the heat inside hits him like a blast.
“Well,” Draco says, sounding supremely self-satisfied, “that was amazing. Any chance your wandless extends to a cleaning charm?”
Harry’s not even sure when it happens, he just knows that by the time he’s ushering Draco out of the cafe, it’s
Harry blinks up at him and then starts to smile. “At least one,” he murmurs against Draco’s lips. “Isn’t that right?’
He’s sat on the ancient, squashy couch in the staff lounge. The other occupant of the lounge is sitting in the hideous, green, corduroy, wingback chair, face hidden behind the Propet from two days ago. They’re the only two in the lounge, which, given that it’s 2:00 in the morning, is not surprising.
He doesn’t realize he’s saying this aloud until he hears Draco murmur between kisses and nips to his throat, “Fuck, I know.
Draco pushes him back down and kisses his way down Harry’s throat even as he runs his hands down Harry’s side and Harry cries out with how good it feels, how amazing it is to be here with someone else. Not just anyone, Harry realizes. How amazing it is to be here with Draco.
“This thing hates virgins, yeah? And we don’t know which one of us it’s locked on to because it could be either.” Malfoy nods. “What happens…” Harry takes a deep breath. “What happens if we become, well. Not virgins. While it’s locked on?”
“Why’d the Bottle pick you?” is what Harry says instead of answering the question, and Malfoy looks startled.
“Wait, us?” Harry asks and realizes that yes, the bottle is actually pointing exactly to where they’re pressed up against each other, and not just at Malfoy as he’d thought. “Okay, so what is it?”
Malfoy gives him a quick wink and a grin and Harry has to admit, Drunk Malfoy is really fun. It turns out that when he’s not under the threat of having his whole family murdered, Malfoy is. Well, there’s a lot to unpack there, as Hermione likes to say whenever Harry makes some totally off-the-cuff, innocuous comment about Malfoy that doesn’t
Draco is pretty sure he loses some time to Harry’s mouth, the way Harry sucks and licks, the way Harry somehow manages to slick up his hand wordlessly and wandlessly, without letting up the suction, and how he wraps that slick, hot hand around the base of Draco’s cock.
and watches the small, brown owl take wing, lifting a weight from his shoulders as she flies, disappearing into the distance.
Harry nods, looking deeply pleased with himself. “Guy at the store said it’s a good one. The colours, they just reminded me of you. That time we went stargazing.”
“It’s not that,” Potter whispers, and Draco’s near enough now to feel the heat of Potter’s body so close to his own. “It’s more, oh god, Draco,” and then his mouth is on Draco’s and it’s like an avalanche of need has been unleashed in Draco’s heart.
He refuses to meet anyone’s eyes, staring resolutely at his feet, but he can hear the startled murmur that goes around the circle, can feel the weight of their surprised glances.
“Truth or Dare, Draco Malfoy,” the Bottle intones, and Malfoy leans back with what can only be described as a smirk playing about his lips.
Malfoy snorts. “Keep it in your trousers, Potter. Not sure if you’ve noticed, but we’ve got a tiny situation happening here.”
The scortátus obligingly gives an angry shriek and kicks the tree again, almost as if it’s saying, “Get the hell on with it, you fucking virgins.”
Draco runs his hand over the bare skin of Harry’s calf. “No one’s ever called me pretty before,” he says thoughtfully, and leans over to dart his tongue into the crease where Harry’s knee is bent, enjoying the way Harry shudders. “I think I like it.”
Harry comes willingly, sliding up Draco’s body in a way that has Draco groaning. Harry fuses their mouths together, and Draco has to say, that Harry Potter wanted to wait is in no fucking way an indictment on his skills, because the man?
it feels, and he’s already shockingly close to the edge. “To be honest, I don’t think it’s going to take much.”
Finally, Harry’s breathing calms enough that he can lift his head to look at Draco. They smile foolishly at each other.
“Exactly, that’s why they think it’s not safe for me to be around other students. It’s like, if something needs trimming or neatening, I can’t really control them.”
Exhausted, Draco starts back up the drive and smiles when the Manor comes into view. The sky has lightened to the soft grey that comes before dawn. The outside lights are on and he knows there will be hot chocolate waiting for him. Just inside, Keely is waiting to take his outer things. She urges him into the small parlour and hands him the steaming cup.
too interested in his simul-casting, and he foresees many long nights in the Department of Mysteries in his near future.
He takes a few breaths, tries to think some unsexy thoughts, and soon, it feels, the crisis is averted.
charm will carry his voice directly to Malfoy’s ear, and sure enough, he hears a soft chuckle in return.
“You know,” Draco says thoughtfully, “Even though you can’t touch me, there’s no reason I can’t touch you, right?”
Harry stops and stares at him. “Fuck,” he says again, and then he snorts. “This is exactly why I’d make a terrible Auror. That didn’t even cross my mind,” and Malfoy surprises him with a loud laugh.
Harry snorts and takes another swallow from his mug. “I love you,” he says fondly even as he grimaces at the taste. “That’s all.”
This paper is a heavy, cream-colored parchment, and it’s dated at the top. The body says, in that same elegant script:
Suddenly, Draco arches back and gives a deep moan, and Harry feels Draco’s whole body shudder, feels the hot spatter of his release as Draco comes, and somehow that’s enough to get him there, and he cries out, too overwhelmed to be embarrassed at how loud he is, as he thrusts up one last time and comes.
Like Malfoy, when the war was over, Harry had spent the summer rebuilding Hogwarts. He’d also spent those months going to funerals, consumed by grief for all they’d lost. He and Ginny hadn’t even tried to rekindle their earlier romance, both of them knowing that any comfort they might take in each other was resting solely on the fear of being alone, not on the joy of being together. Just one more casualty of the war, Harry thinks.
“Draco Malfoy,” the Bottle says and it sounds somehow portentous to Harry’s ears, “Do you accept the terms of this Dare?”
Harry sighs, and flops down next to Draco on the bed. Draco shifts so he can see Harry’s face, reaches over, and traces a circle on Harry’s chest.
Harry nods, swallows. “That I should think about what I want to do, not do something because I think it’s what people want me to do.”
Being back at Hogwarts has been interesting, to say the least. If Draco’s being sincere, which is not a thing he really enjoys so pay attention, he’d have to admit that he’s been humbled by the forgiveness he’s been shown. He’s done his part, obviously, putting in long hours over the summer on the reconstruction, making public declarations of regret about his own wrongdoings (and if those happen to be 100% genuine, well, that’s really no one’s business but Draco’s), not to mention sending personal, handwritten apologies on the advice of his mind healer. Yeah, he’s done that too.
The pen is beautiful, solid and real in his hand as Draco removes it from the case. The body is deep purples and galaxies swirl down to the gleaming palladium nib.
Harry snickers, focuses, and casts and they both shiver as the magic flows over them, cool and tingly.
Harry loses himself in the press of Malfoy’s lips, the way Malfoy tastes of cherries and rum, the bunch and play of the muscles of Malfoy’s back under his questing hands. He breathes in the scent of Malfoy’s cologne, spicy and woodsy. It sparks something dark and carnal deep in Harry’s gut and as he yanks Malfoy in closer, the kiss changes.
Harry frowns. The STD Bottle, as it’s affectionately known, was a contribution from the Slytherins — apparently, it’s been a part of their house social scene for a very long time. No one fully understands how the magic works, and it can be a bit risky to play because it’s sort of like an unbreakable vow (because if you fail your dare, you are bound by the consequence), sort of like Veritaserum (in that you pretty much have to tell the truth or… suffer the consequences), and sort of like the Sorting Hat (in that the Bottle is able to see straight into your heart and mind with occasionally surprising and often uncomfortable results).
“Oh, shit,” he hears a familiar voice from beside the table where he’s sat, “He’s moved on to whiskey. Ron, where were you? I thought you were keeping an eye out. You know these nights are hard for him.”
There’s a pause, a moment where they just look at each other, and then Harry leans in, hands held carefully out to the sides. “I want this,” he murmurs as he kisses Draco.
Malfoy is standing right in front of him now, grey eyes gleaming in the candlelight. He’s settled into himself these days, Harry has noticed. He keeps his hair short on the sides, longer and tousled on top. He’s taller than Harry and he’s filled out, still lean but not so lanky anymore.
“So I just wanted to be prepared, should the occasion arise.” Malfoy reaches out, skates one hand gently over the bulge in Harry’s jeans. “Seems like it did?”
Together, they leave the heat of the sauna. Harry throws open the front door, and they plunge themselves into the snow to the side of the path from the house.
They look at each other for a long moment, and then Harry sighs and clambers to his feet. “I should probably make sure these assholes are fully restrained.”
“I’ll keep the coffee on,” she says in her gravelly voice, and Draco feels simultaneously ten years old and a hundred.
It’s not new, this thing between them. It’s not fragile. Draco’s not going anywhere for long, and he’s pretty sure Harry knows this. Pretty sure Harry knows he'll always come back, as long as Harry wants him to. But even now, it’s hard to find the words.
And then Draco fastens his mouth onto one of Harry’s nipples, tongue flicking even as he presses down firmly on Harry’s achingly hard cock, through the denim of Harry’s jeans, and Harry’s hips snap up as his back arches and he
Their eyes meet and hold, and something shifts, and Draco understands. Potter knows that Draco looks at him
Harry starts to nod and then stares down at the blades protruding from the ends of his arms in horror.
Malfoy shrugs. “I’ve just, for a while now. Really wanted you. And I’ve been feeling lately, it seemed like maybe you wanted me too.”
And then Harry had slid off the desk and onto his knees and Draco’s pretty sure he’s sleeping with an insane person.
He knows there will be repercussions to this. They need to understand how their intel had been so wrong. How had the perps thrown up those wards so quickly, managing to cut off their team? Not to mention, Harry knows, Hermione is going to be
“Must be why Pomfrey sent you out here,” Draco snickers, “You’re more in need of meditation than anyone I’ve ever seen, Potter,” and he dodges as Potter knocks into him with his shoulder.
His voice trails off. He gives Harry a careful up and down, then gives Draco the same treatment, and his expression changes to something a little knowing, a little amused, and he coughs.
But it’s been days now, and Draco, well, he’s quite sure the sensation he’s having in the pit of his stomach has nothing to do with worry, he’s just
Harry smiles, his special smile that’s just for Draco, and he kisses Draco, nice and slow, just how Draco likes it. And then he says the words.
, Harry thinks a bit resentfully. He gets offers all the time. He gets notes slipped into his pockets in the hallways, owls at breakfast, whispered invitations at tea, and on more than one notable occasion, howlers. He’s really not sure why people think that’ll be successful, but it’s happened enough that they’ve had to increase the wards around Hogwarts to divert them.
Immersed in his examination of the blades, Draco just shakes his head and says absently, “No, I overheard her talking to McGonagall.”
Ron walks over to them, gives them a quick once over, and he doesn’t miss a thing, sees the way they’re clinging to each other, the way they’re holding on tight.
Potter flushes. “Well, it’s not pretty, but the house elves cut everything into bite-sized pieces before they bring me food, and I can just sort of…” he mimes a stabbing motion, “spear it on the end of one.”
Harry looks across the room to where Blaise and Ginny are snuggled up and watches as Ginny fastens her mouth to Blaise’s neck, who, judging by the look on his face as his eyes flutter closed, does not mind this turn of events at all. Friendships, Harry muses to himself, and in many cases, more.
He pauses, takes a breath, and focuses in, pulling magic out of his core, and then his hand is dripping with warm oil that smells of sandalwood and incense.
Malfoy shrugs disinterestedly. “You just said you were thinking something. It’s a rare event, so of course, I took note.”
To everyone’s surprise, including Draco’s, somehow he and Potter have become, well, friendly. They’ve been paired up in classes, spent time together on the Quidditch pitch, and have somehow gotten in the habit of walking down to dinner together. There’s also been a lot of really intense eye contact, and Draco’s not quite sure what to make of that. If it were anyone else, he’d call it flirting. Not that he’s got a lot of first-hand experience, what with the war and all, but it seems like
Draco finally shoves his chair back, and yanks Harry out from under the desk, and yes, his intuition was correct, there’s come all over Harry’s robes and a bit on his chin.
Harry shouts and thrusts up against Draco’s hand. His skin is hot and velvet-soft, and Draco lets himself indulge, grasping him firmly and running his hand up and down. Harry is moaning now, soft sounds that are music to Draco’s ears, and he tightens his grip, presses his thumb over the spongy tip and Harry cries out wildly.
“Yes,” Harry hisses. “Anything, Draco. Fucking anything,” and Draco reaches down and wraps one hand around Harry’s hard length.
“Oh,” Malfoy says flatly, “So sorry. I must have misinterpreted the meaning of your tongue down my throat,” and he turns, as if to leave.
“I want you to suck me off,” Draco says plainly and Harry can’t help the shudder that rolls through him at Draco’s words. “Been thinking about this for so long, you on your knees, your mouth... Fuck’s sake, Harry. Your fucking mouth.”
It’s electric, every point of contact igniting Harry like a lightning strike - the touch of Draco’s hand, his lips, the way he moves in, his knees brushing against Harry’s. Without thinking, Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s waist and pulls him closer, slotting their bodies together like two halves of a whole. He gasps as Draco deepens the kiss, hand firm on Harry’s face, adjusting him just so.
He leans in, presses an open-mouth kiss on Harry’s jaw, and begins working his way down to Harry’s neck, that sensitive spot below Harry’s ear that makes him shiver and cry out.
Sometimes Harry plays, sometimes he just lies on the floor and kicks his feet in the air, listening to the chaos that surrounds him, but either way, he feels safe and content, surrounded by his most favourite people in the world.
The sounds Malfoy is making are incredible. Bitten-off gasps, whispered pleas, a long inhale, and a drawn-out cry. Harry pictures Malfoy’s face, the way his back is probably arching off of the bed, the way the muscles of his stomach are probably contracting. The way his finger looks plunging into his own body as he jacks himself off. Harry can hear the sound of Malfoy’s hand, and his own hand moves faster and faster.
Draco gives another long suck, pushing his mouth down as far onto Harry’s cock as he can without gagging and Harry collapses back onto the lounge.
“I just don’t get it though,” Harry says. “Why does that fucking thing hate virgins? That’s so stupid. Virginity is a ridiculous concept anyway. How do they even know?” Suddenly, something occurs to him. “Wait just a fucking minute, Malfoy.”
Harry just shakes his head and clacks his scissor blades at him. “I’ll tell you later. That was, my god, Draco.”
“It sounds to me,” Malfoy says carefully, “like you’re suggesting one of us get fucked in this giant oak tree so that a ravening beast that is currently stalking us will leave us alone so that we can complete the stupidest fucking dare in the world and avoid a week of pain and misery.”
Their eyes meet and hold, and Harry holds his breath. They’ve been dancing around each other for months now, and Harry knows all of their friends are sick of it, and, he’s finally acknowledged, Malfoy’s never going to make the first move, so if something’s going to happen, it’s up to Harry.
Harry understands that, he does. Because he was trained by the best as well, though their methods leaned more towards the physical side of the spectrum, rather than what Draco endured. He’s told Harry about how his parents would just act like he wasn’t there, sometimes for days on end, and how confusing that was, when he was so young. He still has moments, Harry knows, where he’s not really sure that he exists. That anyone can see him.
They land on the front walkway of the Manor where Draco stumbles and breathes deeply to keep from vomiting on his shoes. He dislikes apparating at the best of times, and should know better than to have had that last drink before leaving, but dammit, he’s wallowing and a man should be allowed to wallow in peace.
Huge shoutout to the nsfw chat on the drarry microfic discord for helping me through the socks and shoes issue!
Draco scrambles to his feet and nearly impales himself on Harry’s scissorhands as he rips off his clothes, tossing them behind him. He straddles Harry’s thighs and reaches down to take himself in hand.
“You are insane,” he hisses, mindful of the fact that he’s still at the office. “Harry. What the fuck?”
who is laughing at the story Harry is telling. He’s laughing so hard that Harry has to steer him away from a table full of posh mums and their even posher babies.
“I know Kingsley doesn’t.” Harry frowns and Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Shut it, Potter, I’m not maligning your man there, just saying. You can write your own ticket right now, not undeservedly. So, since you can do anything you want, what are you going to choose?”
“I know,” Harry whispers back. “Go do your thing. Come to bed, no matter how late or early it is. I’ll be there.”
Draco pulls an offended face and casts a quick tempus to keep up the ruse. “With all due respect, Madame Pomfrey,” he says, “I’m not lurking. I just happened to be passing by, that’s all. Simply coincidence.”
Draco can see how that might get dangerous and wishes he’d thought to get a haircut before coming out here.
“So, no wands, no way down, and cock boils at sunrise,” Harry says, staring up into the night sky. He can see the moon and stars through the trees. He shivers, it’s colder at this height, and the wind is picking up. Harry pulls out his extra sweater and manages to shrug it on without falling out of the tree.
, pressing against the warm entrance he finds there. His cock throbs in response, so for the sake of scientific experimentation, Harry presses harder.
“I should get up,” he says mournfully and Harry’s only response is to tighten his grip. “No, I really should,” Draco insists on another sigh, and reluctantly rolls out of Harry’s arms.
He thrusts, setting up a rhythm that’s fast and hard, and Harry just urges him on, reaches up to trace his hands over Draco’s chest, and then, Harry leans on one elbow and fastens his mouth over one nipple and Draco comes.
“It’s not that I don’t. I do,” Harry says fervently, and watches as a smile starts to cross Malfoy’s face. “I really, really do. But, you’re drunk.” Malfoy moves closer, slips his hands back into position on Harry’s bum, and begins nibbling on Harry’s neck. “Gah, fuck. Malf—
It’s still new, this thing between them, so much still unspoken. Draco has no idea what they’re doing, only knows that he likes it, doesn’t want to stop. That doesn’t mean he wants to get caught receiving a blow job at his desk. In the Ministry of Magic, where he fucking
“Yes,” Draco hisses, “Fucking touch me, Harry,” and Harry shoves his hands down the front of Draco’s joggers.
Harry dies on a beautiful, sunny May morning. The sky is so blue, and the cirrus clouds look like waves rolling into the shore. Harry dies exactly the way he lived, Draco thinks. Reckless and selfless. Throwing himself into a fight that wasn’t even his. Draco can’t speak when Hermione comes to tell him, eyes red and swollen from weeping. She still has his blood on her sweater. She’s soaked in it.
“I think I’ll take the Dare,” he says, and Harry would almost believe he feels that casual about it, but he sees the way Malfoy’s throat moves as he swallows, notes the way Malfoy’s hand is clutching the back of the couch.
Malfoy stands up, crosses the circle and reaches a hand down to Harry, one eyebrow quirked. “Shall we, Potter?”
Harry glances over to where the noise is coming from and sees something that looks almost familiar, but not quite right.
“I can’t feel my legs,” Draco mumbles, pressing his face into Harry’s muscular abdomen. “You’ve broken me, Potter.”
It’s also the case that since being back at Hogwarts, Harry has been in somewhat of a fog. He doesn’t seem to feel strongly about much of anything. Hermione thinks he’s depressed. Ron thinks he needs to get laid. Ginny thinks he needs something that absolutely isn’t her.
They walk in silence for a few more minutes, and then, after one last turn, they’ve made it to the center of the maze. Labyrinth. Whatever.
“Do you want me to…” Harry starts and he’s not sure if he’s relieved or disappointed when Draco shakes his head.
unlike the affectionate, brotherly smooch that Neville had planted on her brother. There’s a lot of tongue. Harry doesn’t even remember that maybe he’s supposed to be upset until he glances over to see Malfoy looking at him with concern.
. In spite of everything, Harry’s own cock starts to get interested in the proceedings and Harry can’t quite stifle a groan.
Harry looks at him closely. “Are you sure? I know we were joking earlier, but. I’m not expecting anything. We don’t have to do anything.”
“So,” Harry says. He leans over, rummages in his bedside table and pulls out the lube. “You down for this?”
Today, though, Draco notes, things actually look good. The connections between their different properties are strong, and nothing stands out to his inner eye as being particularly problematic. There’s something minor happening in the woods at the western edge of the chateau’s grounds, and Draco makes a mental note to reach out to Henri to have him take a look.
The Moonflower is, well, lovely, Harry has to admit. It’s tall, coming almost to their waists, and it’s a large flower that looks almost like mother-of-pearl in the moonlight. Just to be on the safe side, they each pick one, and then Draco says, “Maybe a second? For backup?”
To be honest, every time Draco’s pictured having sex with Harry Potter, he’s always assumed he’d be the one bottoming.
It seems like a fine time to practice a bit of wandless magic, and Harry feels a flush of satisfaction as warm, fragrant oil coats his palm and drips down onto his belly. He’s not sure why his Lubrico always smells like sandalwood and incense, but he likes it. He wonders idly what Malfoy’s Lubrico smells like.
“I have an idea, Malfoy,” he says, and Draco nods. “How about, we go back to mine where I’ve got some Sober Up, and then we can get started? I think if we’re dedicated and stay focused, we can probably get through the whole list by tomorrow night.”
They dash through the woods until Malfoy shouts, pointing to a large tree ahead of them. “That one. C’mon, we’ve got to climb.”
They’d been friends, then more, and now, after tonight, Draco thinks, lovers. That last barrier between them to be taken down.
He looks over at Ron who just gives him a wink, and Harry shakes his head, suddenly so grateful for Ron and Hermione. Then Harry’s gaze shifts to Malfoy who is just giving him a thoughtful look, and when their eyes meet, Malfoy smiles at him, small and sweet.
Draco looks around with interest. It’s a small clearing, only about six or seven meters across. To one side, there’s a picnic table set up, and to the other, a small pavilion containing a comfortable-looking double lounge.
Draco stares at him, and at first, doesn’t see anything that might obviously make Potter too dangerous to be around other people. His hair is the same, messy and falling in his face in a way that absolutely should not be endearing but is. His same round glasses are slipping down his nose. But then, as Draco scans his body, his eyes widen, and it’s clear what’s happened.
Draco rolls his eyes, grabs Harry’s hand, and pulls him down the sidewalk towards the apparition point that’s around the corner.
from his orgasm. It’s difficult to muster up the self-disapprobation he thinks is absolutely the appropriate response to his own creepiness.
By the time they get to the apparition point, they’re almost sprinting, and Harry can’t remember ever having been so eager to be alone with someone before. There’s a short line waiting to get behind the wards, so he consoles himself by winding an arm around Draco’s waist and sliding his hand up under Draco’s shirt, pressing his palm against the lean muscles he finds there.
“I think I ruined the moment,” he says glumly, fully prepared to walk Draco to the closest apparition point, then immediately quit his job and move to Southern Australia so they’ll never have to speak of this again.
Someone gasps. Someone moans, long and low, and Draco presses in even closer, the long, lean lines of his body firm against Harry. Draco’s body is warm in the cool, Spring morning, and the plate glass of the window is cold against Harry’s back as his shirt rucks up, and he hisses and arches at the sudden chill.
Draco shakes her. He’s screaming now, he knows he is, but he can’t stop. “You have to take me to him. I can do this, Hermione.”
Harry can’t help holding himself stiff so that he’s not leaning against Malfoy at all, not wanting to make him uncomfortable, but after a moment, Malfoy mutters, “Oh for fuck’s sake, Potter,” and wrapping his arms around Harry, Malfoy hauls him back so they’re pressed close together, Harry’s backside snuggled in tightly between Malfoy’s thighs.
Harry shudders. “It did,” he says breathlessly, “I mean it, I do, I want to. I have for so long now. But Draco. I need you to be sober. I want you to remember every moment. Every detail. Every sound and sensation.”
The letter has also been witnessed and signed by both Pansy and Ron, and when Harry taps their signatures, the authentication spell flares up his arm in a burst of gold and sparkles.
“A toast,” Ron yells, lifting the shot glass high, “To Harry Potter, who will not be accepting his offer for entrance into the Auror Elite Training Program!” and the room bursts into cheers.
“It’s just that when I’ve been with people in the past, they’ve always just expected. You know? I can’t remember the last time someone asked me what I wanted. They just assume I’m going to top.”
He’s past the far end of the property now, the rolling fields and hills. From here, he’ll continue on through the woods, along the lake’s shore, and finally back around to the driveway. It’s so late, he can see how the moon has shifted overhead, but he still doesn’t cast a Lumos. There’s no need, he knows this path well. He hears the call of owls, the rustlings of small animals in the underbrush, but he has nothing to fear from the night. One foot, then another, step after step, bringing him closer and closer to the Manor. It is both home and not home. Even if Draco can’t explain it to anyone else, it’s enough that he understands.
It’s almost last call, and Draco doesn’t want to go. He doesn’t want to leave because he’s not going home, and he certainly doesn’t want to be where he’s going. He ponders, as he does every six months, just why he submits to these ridiculous rituals. It’s been fifteen years since his father died in Azkaban. Maybe, Draco thinks morosely, staring into his whiskey, maybe it’s time to let the heap fall. Time to walk away.
He thinks about love and loss. He thinks about his father, dead in Azkaban not six months after his sentencing, and his mother’s flight to France. She’ll never set foot on British soil again, he knows. He thinks about the power of love and forgiveness. The way Hermione had offered him Rose to hold, not even two hours old. The way Ron had fought for him and Harry, had turned the tide of Weasleys towards acceptance. The way Harry looks when he laughs. When he cries. When he rages. When he comes.
Harry’s eyes sheen in the candlelight, and Draco is shocked to feel his own throat tighten in response. It’s so powerful, this moment, he thinks. So powerful moving inside someone else, someone else letting you in. No less powerful for Harry, he thinks. Letting someone else in. Slowly, so slowly, Draco rocks his way forward until he’s all the way in.
Harry stares at him, looks at Hermione who just nods, eyes shining. He takes a deep breath, then reaches up and takes Ron’s hand, lets himself be pulled to standing. “Yeah. Let’s go.”
“Did you…” Harry asks and Draco just shakes his head, and then Harry gives him a filthy grin. “Well? What are you waiting for?”
He breathes in the icy air, breathes out the pain of his past until he feels all those spaces inside filled with the crisp, clear night, and it seems, as he approaches the completion point, that there is no difference between Draco and the land he walks; they are one. When he steps on the exact spot where he started, the magic tightens until it’s almost painful. There’s a pop, as if he’s cleared his ears, and Draco knows. His intention has been accepted and the ritual is complete for another six months. His presence as Head of Household is accepted. His intention is judged sufficient.
Harry follows him, heart pounding in his chest. Malfoy sounds terrified, and Harry realises he doesn’t like that at all.
Hermione snorts. “You’ve never really been much of a planner,” she points out. “If you know you don’t want to be an Auror—”
Hermione sighs again. She’s a champion sigher, that one, Draco thinks fondly. If someone had told him on May 2, 1998, that fifteen years and some odd months later, he’d be so deeply entrenched in the lives of these Gryffindors, he would have scoffed. Well, probably punched the message bearer, and then scoffed. But, time changes many things, and it turns out that sincere contrition and the work of redemption can transform lives. At least, it’s transformed Draco’s.
The Bottle rolls over twice. “The consequence is four days of offensive body odour. Do you forfeit?”
Eyes still closed, Harry grins at the ceiling and says in a sing-song voice. “That’s not what I heard.”
Draco leans over, brushes a kiss against Harry’s cheek, almost undone by the gentleness that flows through him. “Not for the boring lawyer meetings. If you want to come this afternoon, that’s up to you.”
“Besides,” Draco adds, slipping his hands up under Harry’s sweater and shirt, fingers cool against Harry’s hot skin, “if we don’t… now, we’ll have to wait a full week, because of the boils. Do you want the boils, Harry? Because I really, really do not.”
Malfoy turns back, face blank and then, as Harry tries to find the right words, raises one eyebrow. “While we’re still young, Potter?”
Draco wants Harry to talk to him, to call him by name. To let endearments fall from his lips, to tell Draco that he sees him,
Malfoy shrugs and won’t meet Harry’s eyes. “It’s a thing I learned during. You know. If you use red light, it helps you see better in the dark. I don’t want to alert anything to our presence, but one of us is going to get hurt if we keep up like this, or we’re going to lose the path.”
“Boils for 144 hours,” Harry says faintly. Malfoy nods. “How come all Pavarti had to do was sing? Or all the kissing? I’d kiss any of you in here! Hell, Malfoy, I’d kiss you with tongue. This isn’t fair.”
of a man under his desk leans in again, and closes his mouth around the tip of Draco’s achingly hard cock. Just the tip, sucking gently, and his hand moves so slowly, and the door opens.
Harry closes his eyes, already shaking. “I guess,” he says, shocked at how rough his own voice sounds, “I was too busy worrying about how obvious I was being,” and then Malfoy’s mouth meets his and they’re kissing.
They sit quietly for a moment and then Malfoy moves. He climbs down a limb or two and makes his way around to the other side of the tree. After a moment, he calls up to Harry.
Harry’s orgasm hits him, inexorable and unstoppable. It rips through him like a tidal wave, turns him inside out with the force of it, his entire body shuddering as he gasps, until finally, he drops back onto his pillows, chest heaving.
, in the same way everyone else cares about Potter. He cares the completely appropriate and totally platonic amount of caring, and he’s not worried or anything. It’s just, he’s gotten used to seeing Potter around, in classes, at meals. Wandering back from the showers with only a towel wrapped loosely around his narrow hips, his surprisingly broad chest still damp, cheeks flushed.
This moment, it feels monumental, as if the words he’s about to say mean so much more than just this moment.
, here at the Ministry, where he has a desk that he’s sitting at. A desk under which Harry Potter is currently kneeling, looking up at Draco, flushed and wanting.
to dampen the fabric, and then steps into Harry’s space and carefully wipes his own come from that beautiful face. It’s so tender and so profoundly erotic, Draco feels breathless with it.
Harry opens his eyes. He feels stunned, lit up from the inside out, and he’s honestly surprised to see that his body isn’t glowing or shooting off sparks.
“That ass Macmillan knocked your shears into the cauldron, didn’t he,” Draco says and Potter stares at him.
— just because Draco’s not interested doesn’t mean he’s gone blind, for fuck’s sake). Anyway, Draco had been working with Neville so he hadn’t been paying attention when there’d been a loud bang and a huge cloud of black smoke, and by the time the room cleared, Draco had just seen the back of Harry’s head as he’d raced out of the lab, Ron and Hermione heavy on his heels.
Harry doesn’t even have to be looking at Hermione to know she’s rolling her eyes. “Harry. We’ve talked about this.”
Draco arches his back to give Harry more contact, and then says, “Harry, fuck, just do… something,” and Harry does.
“Now, you’re gonna finger me,” Malfoy says with a tone of great satisfaction, and Harry’s eyes widen.
“—been tough on him, of course, but he agreed it’s best he stays isolated. I’ve sent him out to the hedge maze today to get some sun. To keep him occupied.”
Harry’s eyes widen under the cloak and he tries not to make a sound as he watches what Draco is doing, because Draco is. Well, he’s taking off his clothes, there’s really no other explanation. He’s stripping down, carefully folding his clothes up and setting them neatly at the foot of his bed, the priss.
Harry sits up and Draco can’t help himself, lets out a mournful burble at the loss of sensation. He frowns, though, when he sees the look on Harry’s face. Harry looks almost shy, bites his lip.
“No,” he says, heart in his throat. “Like this.” He puts his hands on Draco’s hips and pulls him down, so Draco’s back is pulled flush against his chest. Harry shifts and Draco tips backward, and Harry can’t help the groan that escapes as Draco’s bum presses exactly where Harry wants him, and Draco gives a soft hum of understanding.
something to do with it,” Harry retorts as he manages to push himself up and off the lounge without slicing the cushion to shreds.
Harry can almost hear Malfoy’s shrug as he says, “Dunno, was thinking of trying that new curry place.
Luckily he doesn’t run into his very nosy friends. It turns out the Gryffindors are even worse than the Slytherins at spreading gossip, and now that Pansy and Hermione have become close, well. That pair is terrifying and between the two of them, they seem to know everything about everyone, sometimes even before any interested parties. Normally Draco is pleased with the speed of information dissemination because normally, he’s not one of the interested parties.
“No,” Harry says, and common decency be damned, he yanks Draco in for another heated kiss. There’s really a lot of tongue involved. “I don’t mean we need to
“You will,” Harry says, and his smile is everything as Draco realizes he’s murmuring aloud. “Draco, it’s already so good, just because it’s you. Everything else is just. Extra.”
Harry watches as Malfoy grabs his towel from where it’s draped over the foot of his bed, and winds it carelessly around his narrow hips. Malfoy picks up his shower caddy with his fancy body wash and expensive shampoo, and walks over towards the boys’ bathroom.
“I love you,” Draco says and Harry pauses in his explanation of the special ink he’s purchased, to look at Draco, to shake his head and smile.
The cut is relatively shallow, running from one side of Malfoy’s forehead down close to his eye, and as Harry wipes it clear, the bleeding is already slowing down.
It also hasn’t escaped his notice that more and more often, lately, there’s one specific jawline, one specific chest that makes him lie awake in the night, aching and wanting. Harry looks across the room to where that chest is sitting, currently curled up in the corner of the couch. It’s not just his chest, Harry has to admit. It’s his… everything.
“Well, we’re on nights for the next two weeks,” Harry points out, “so breakfast works better with our schedules.”
“No. I’m training with McGonagall, but my control is shit. There are like two spells I can do. But, I mean, I’ll try.”
They each brush their teeth and trim their nails, and then Draco takes a breath and gives Harry a nod. From here on out, they won’t be talking too much. It’s not forbidden, but Draco’s found over the years that he needs to focus inward in order to best connect with the wards and the lands. The year he and Harry had had a huge fight in the sauna before conducting the ritual had led to his mother being unable to access most of the chateau until the following Solstice, so Draco’s learned his lesson.
Okay, maybe he’s a little drunk. He’s had just enough of whatever is that Luna offered him that he feels a little warm, a little spinny, and a lot like he loves everyone in this common room tonight.
“Yeah, I think I will,” Draco gasps, and looking worried, Richardson departs, and, thank the bountiful lords of small mercies, he pulls the door shut behind him.
“We wait,” Malfoy says. “Someone will come tomorrow, and we’ll be in agony for a week and then we’ll be fine.”
“Well,” Harry says, rubbing Draco firmly, who bucks up at the feel of Harry’s hand. “You did say you don’t put out on the first date?” Harry realizes he’s only half-joking, that he actually needs to hear this from Draco. “Do you want this? We can stop.”
That’s another thing that’s held no interest for Harry. He wanks occasionally, usually just to manage his morning wood, and it almost always feels fairly perfunctory. Kind of bland. He gets off and it’s fine. But this is the first time in so long that he’s felt… excited. That it’s to Malfoy’s naked body is somewhat curious but not, Harry has to acknowledge, really all that surprising.
Ron follows him up the walkway and into the front hall. The Manor is dark and silent, and feels somehow empty around them, as they make their way up the grand central staircase. Ron waits patiently as Draco gets ready for bed. He knows how hard these nights are on Draco.
Like how Harry thinks Malfoy’s worked really hard to change himself, to make himself a better person, a better man. And that’s impressive. That Malfoy has a great smile, and it comes out much more frequently these days. And how much Harry likes that. You know, as one does.
The first thing he does is go back to his room to change his clothes. He shucks off his robes and pulls on his stretchy khaki leggings and his favorite pink tank top. He may very well wish to do some yoga in the hedge maze, and it’s important to be prepared for that possibility. The fact that these leggings do fantastic things for his arse, and the tank top shows off the lean curve of his biceps, well, that’s neither here nor there. Total happenstance.
“Am I reading this wrong, Potter,” Draco asks quietly and Potter slowly shakes his head. “Is this just because you haven’t been able to get off?” Draco moves in again, loath to admit if Potter does want just a one-off, that he’d go along just to get his hands on him.
“You should come on my face,” Harry says, not looking at Draco, cheeks flushing red. “Just. You should really do that.”
Draco looks at him for a long moment and then rolls his eyes. He puts his hands on Harry’s shoulders and quickly spins them around so that Harry is now backed up against the window. Draco places one hand on the glass by Harry’s head and gives him a teasing smile.
He looks up at Draco, and Draco looks back at Harry, with his scar and his ridiculous hair and his beautiful eyes and his brave, brave heart.
“Of course I did,” Harry shrieks back. “It was in my pocket, it must have fallen out while we were running.”
Draco just nods curtly, feels Harry’s fingers slip down and past his balls to stroke at the delicate skin there.
, flushed and tousled, and Harry can see the smear of his release across his belly and chest. Holy shit, he must have come so hard, Harry thinks as Malfoy swipes a hand down his neck. Then Malfoy stretches, contentment and satisfaction clear in the line of his body.
Draco lets one finger rest at the opening to Harry’s body, sets up a gentle rhythm of breach and retreat, breach and retreat. “It might.”
It’s gentle at first, like an introduction, an innocent exploration. It’s been a long time since Harry’s been kissed like this, and as it continues, Malfoy’s mouth pressed to his, so sweet and soft, Harry realizes. He’s
He gives it everything he’s got, and if the way Draco responds is any indication, he understands exactly what Harry’s not saying.
Draco leans in, nips at his jawline, mouths his way over to the sensitive skin just under Harry’s ear. “I want to.”
And, Draco can’t believe he didn’t notice, standing guard on either side of the archway, someone appears to have created hedge sculptures. One is a fine figure of man, a hand on his hip that’s canted out invitingly, and the other appears to be… a T Rex? Their muggle studies class had taken a field trip to the Natural History Museum in London, and Draco remembers that Harry had been quite taken by the dinosaur exhibit.
“Pomfrey sent me out here because I was losing my mind from boredom in the hospital wing,” Potter retorts. “And I butchered her bonsais trying to neaten them up, so she said to go do my worst out here. It’s been fun, actually.”
“So,” Malfoy says after a long pause. He slouches down, mirroring Harry’s posture. “Since you’re not going to go be Kingsley’s most special boy and run the Auror Department, what are you going to do?”
Harry laughs in spite of himself. “It’s just. Kingsley… People… I know they’re going to feel let down.”
Ron is sort of draped over Hermione’s shoulder, who is talking animatedly to Pansy about something. Something
Finally, Harry looks up and meets his eyes, and something in his expression relaxes at the look on Draco’s face. “Yeah, I really fucking want that,” Harry says hoarsely, and Draco nods, just once.
Harry wipes his suddenly sweaty palms on his filthy trousers. “You’ve got some mad luck, you bastard.”
Malfoy continues. “So unicorns are pretty mellow and gentle. Docile. They love virgins but don’t do anything to err, non-virgins. Just ignore them. They’re honestly pretty dumb. Gorgeous, but thick as bricks.”
Draco lets himself drift off. The sun is rising. The longest night is over, and it is time for rest.
readily apparent in her voice and Draco mopes for a moment because he really prefers her lemon snowballs but she’s always liked Harry best.
“Harry,” Draco hisses. “Harry, you have to stop, the door is still open,” and Harry just gives him a cheeky grin, waves his hand, and the door swings shut.
Draco doesn’t say them back for weeks but Harry doesn’t seem to mind. They continue on as they’ve been, but now Harry says it all the time. The more he says it, the less Draco panics.
, where Harry had waltzed into Draco’s office and sat down on top of Draco’s desk and pulled Draco in by his necktie and kissed him, bold and unhurried. Kissed Draco like he means it, with tongue and everything. Kissed him like Harry doesn’t even care if someone walks by and sees.
Harry follows him, stumbling a bit in his eagerness. He halts next to the lounge. “How, errr…” he coughs, face flushing. “How do you want me?”
And suddenly Harry is laughing too, the absolute absurdity of the situation hitting him. The scortátus really doesn’t like that and starts rearing up, pawing at the tree and making a noise that’s almost entirely unlike a horse’s neighing, and much more like, say, a person being tortured. It’s a big tree, but Harry swears he feels it shake under the attack. He and Malfoy immediately quiet down and stare at each other.
“If we’re not back soon after sunrise, they’ll come looking for us, right?” Harry asks and Malfoy nods.
“Told you,” he gasps, his heart still racing as he tries to catch his breath. “Told you it wasn’t going to take long.”
“Up you get then, Draco,” he says firmly, as Draco closes his eyes in protest. “Let’s get you back to the Manor.”
“You’ve got me,” Harry says, and the words carry a weight he hadn’t intended, but finds he means, wholly. “You’ve got me, any way you want me. I just need to know, what do you want?”
Ron’s here now, and eventually, the others come, and the days pass. Every morning, Draco wakes up and he remembers. They try to comfort Draco, and Draco wishes he could give that back to them, but he can’t. For Draco, there’s no room for anything but Harry now, and Draco is so full of his absence, he thinks it’s possible he’ll never be anything but empty again.
Draco swallows and coughs, sucking Harry through it until he moans, “Enough, oh my god,” and sitting up, wipes his mouth. Harry is sprawled out, legs wide and chest heaving, eyes staring in shock at the ceiling of the pavilion.
Harry stares at him and begins to grin. “Well, you are blonde,” he says and Draco smacks at him half-heartedly.
It’s the first time Harry’s touched a cock that’s not his own, and he can’t believe how incredible it feels. He’s hard too, so hard it almost hurts, but hearing the way Draco moans and cries out is so, so satisfying.
All that to say, he and the other returning Slytherins have been folded, albeit a bit reluctantly, back into the social scene at Hogwarts, and anyone who knows anything knows that the only place to be
Draco starts to move, slowly at first, giving Harry time to get used to the sensation. He shifts his hips and knows exactly the moment he’s found it. Harry’s eyes fly open and his mouth rounds into a gasp of surprise that ends on a moan as Draco keeps up the slow and steady pressure. Harry’s cock is hard now, and he’s starting to move too, starting to make these small groans that race down Draco’s spine like wildfire.
Harry takes his time, gets acquainted with Draco in this new way. He closes his eyes, sinking into the feel of Draco in his mouth, the smell of his body wash, the taste of his arousal, heady and rich in Harry’s mouth. He pushes down on Draco’s hip with one hand, the unspoken “stay still” clear, and he hears Draco give an honest-to-god whimper as he threads his fingers through Harry’s curls, and Harry starts to move.
Draco tries not to shriek out loud, but it’s difficult when it feels like his balls are contracting back up into his body.
Harry licks his lips and swallows, sees the way Draco’s eyes dip to his mouth, and then back up to look at him. Harry realizes he’s never looked been this close to Draco, so close he can see the flecks of yellow in the storm-cloud grey of Draco’s eyes, can see the beautiful curve of his cheek, can almost feel the heat of his body as Draco leans into him.
, Draco, fuck, you’re making me…” and his back arches as his release spatters across his taut abs, and Draco thinks Harry’s face as he comes is the closest thing he’s seen to perfection in this world.
Draco breathes in again through his nose, out through the mouth, as Luna instructs them to do in yoga class. It seems to help, so he does it again.
“Why would a unicorn be chasing us?” Harry says as they pound down the path. “I thought they were friendly? Especially to…” He shuts up, wondering how much more awkward it can get.
“I mean,” Harry says hastily, “That was amazing, and I fucking mean it, Draco. Best thing ever. But maybe…” His voice trails off and he bites his lip uncertainly.
Harry’s never quite figured out if there’s any rhyme or reason to the sparks the Bottle emits as it spins and chooses its next willing victim. There’s nothing he can identify, but they’re pretty to look at, nonetheless.
“Not that I was listening in or anything, Potter.” He tries to drum up a credible sneer. “I just happened to be outside the lounge when they were talking.”
He comes hard, harder than he ever has, with a hoarse cry, eyes squeezed tight, lights flashing behind his eyelids. He drops back onto the mattress, shuddering from head to toe as Draco continues to press down, as his cock pulses and pulses again.
A fleeting look of relief crosses Malfoy’s face and then he gives a small smile. “I’ll meet you back here in ten.”
It begins, as many Saturday nights do, with an informal party in the 8th year common room. It ends with Harry running for his life through the Forbidden Forest, which is decidedly less typical these days.
“One, two, three, four, five and that’s six,” Malfoy says with a grunt, levitating the last of his bounty into a pile.
The game continues with more uncomfortable truths and ridiculous dares, and then Harry sees it. The Bottle sparks green and silver and lands on Malfoy.
charm snap into place once they’re far enough apart. He hears Malfoy’s tuneless whistling, and at that familiar sound, Harry’s heart rate finally, finally starts to slow down.
“Love you too, mate,” Ron says, and pulls Harry into an affectionate headlock, planting a loud kiss on his forehead.
Harry’s eyes close and Draco watches the way he gives himself over to the sensation. “But it might,” Harry says, and gasps as Draco slips in deeper, “Might not.”
“Oh, Draco,” Harry says, and leans in to kiss him, once, and then again. “I know, sweetheart. I already know.”
Draco plants a kiss between what he thinks are the shoulder blades, although it’s difficult to be sure, and there’s another mumble, a cough and then Harry rises to the surface of the blankets like some bewildered sea monster. His hair is a disaster, there’s a pillow crease on his cheek, he smells like smoke and stakeout, and he’s the most beautiful sight Draco’s ever seen.
Harry feels a sense of something rising in him, something wild and unfamiliar, and he realizes, it feels like—
“No,” Harry says, dazed by the way Draco’s touching him. “I don’t. I just. I don’t want to do this just to not have boils. I want it to…” He pauses. “I need it to mean something, Draco. Something more.”
Baffled, Harry folds up the note and slides it back into Malfoy’s pocket. He hopes he can be forgiven for lingering a bit over the curve of Malfoy’s ass, but it’s just really nice. In the other pocket, there’s also a piece of paper, so Harry pulls that one out and unfolds it.
He’s so tight, he’s got to go slow, but soon Harry is gently fucking himself up to the first knuckle, and his hips are starting to rock. The angle is bad, and his wrist is starting to ache, but he’s getting closer. He’s never felt anything like this before, and thinks he’s never been so hard in his life. This is a revelation.
Draco looks tired after a long night of work. His hair is messy, and later Harry will blame his own lack of impulse control on the fact that Draco’s hair is messy and he has the faintest smattering of freckles across his nose, barely visible unless you know to look for them. There’s nothing else to be done. Harry grabs Draco by the shoulders, shoves him up against the plate glass window of the cafe, and slams their mouths together.
He’s quite sure he’s just about to get up and change that, when the door opens, and who should come wandering in but Draco Malfoy.
He watches as Ron chooses Truth and has to disclose the subject of his most recent wet dream (Madame Pomfrey in full uniform, which has most of the room groaning and Hermione giving Ron a thoughtful look that Harry really does not want to understand). Luna chooses Dare and has to kiss Neville, which she does, so thoroughly that Harry wonders if they’ll be able to continue the game. It wouldn’t be the first time a pair has had to leave, but no, Neville collapses onto his back, chest heaving and Luna settles back in her spot, looking extremely pleased with herself.
“No,” Malfoy says thoughtfully, “They really don’t. So odd, too. Most criminals are thrilled when we show up at their secret lair.”
Harry stomps off to his room, throws the door open. He hits the bathroom and then sits on his bed. It’s not even eleven and it sounds like they may be out for the rest of the night. He grabs a small knapsack and stuffs an extra sweater, a bottle of water, and a handful of candy bars inside. Then he changes his socks, laces up his trainers, curses his fucking luck one more time, and heads back to the common room.
Harry’s ears are ringing in the aftermath of the violence and he doesn’t even realize he’s shouting, frantic to find Malfoy, which is why he doesn’t hear it at first, Malfoy’s voice groaning. It only hits him when he crawls over the pile of scrap metal and rough shingles from the roof to find Malfoy lying on the ground, blood streaming from his forehead, and his left leg pinned under a chunk of something.
Harry glances around the room and realizes something. Sure, his friends are watching them with avid curiosity, but there’s no censure, no judgement that he can see. In fact, if he had to comment, Harry thinks, he’d have to say that the feel of the room is… encouraging. Blaise gives him a thumbs-up, and Ginny actually fucking applauds. Seamus is still shrieking, but that’s to be expected, Seamus does get worked up about things, and when Harry looks at them, Dean just grins and mouths, “Get it, Harry.”
“Come on me,” Harry whispers and licks his lip. “Do it, Draco, come on. Come on my face,” and Draco feels it, the way his balls tighten and his whole body shudders and then he’s coming, as hard as he’s ever come in his life, watching the way his release spatters across Harry’s lips and cheeks, watching the way Harry’s tongue darts out to taste him.
“Fine.” Draco frowns at the ground. “Yes, I want this with you too. No, it’s not just because of boils and monsters. I would also very much like to have sex with you tonight, though the logistics of making that happen in a tree this far off the ground are somewhat beyond me at the moment.”
He kisses the same way he casts, Draco thinks, direct and powerful and with a confidence that’s devastating. He’s kneeling between Draco’s splayed legs now, one hand holding Draco’s right arm above his head, the other bracing himself as he leans and kisses Draco again and again. He slides down a bit to bite at Draco’s jaw, and Draco turns his head to set his own teeth in Harry’s bicep.
Finally, Harry sits back, lets his fingers ghost over Draco’s jaw. “Now we can go,” he says quietly, and Draco looks at him steadily, and then smiles.
“Please don’t freeze your bollocks off,” Harry says earnestly, letting go of Draco to push back from the table and stand. “I’m actually quite fond of them.”
“It’s just,” Draco says thoughtfully, “there was a branch of the Abernathy family, the Flanagans, and they raised all sorts of magical creatures on their estate on the southern coast of Ireland. Dark creatures, Harry.”
The paper snaps back up into place and Malfoy says, “Fine. We can go to the place with the muffins.”
“Climb, fucking climb,” Malfoy hisses, setting off, and Harry hastily follows him up, limb to limb until they’re as high as they can safely go.
“Forget I said anything,” Harry says. “I mean, I know you don’t… You’re not. About me. I know that.”
Harry takes a deep breath and all of a sudden his hands feel three times their normal size and he doesn’t know what to do with them. Should he reach up to touch Draco’s face? Maybe tilt Draco’s head to one side? Nibble gently on his lips? All of a sudden, Harry wonders if he’s ever successfully kissed anyone in his life.
“I should blow you,” Malfoy whispers, breath hot in Harry’s ear, “Like, right here, on my knees, right now. Then you should take me home and fuck me.”
It’s late by the time they finish the interior of the Manor, and Draco is tired. Keely’s set out a hearty supper, a steak and mushroom pie with a flaky, golden crust, along with roasted vegetables, fresh bread, and the 1985 Cabernet Sauvignon that Draco is particularly fond of. After a quiet meal, there’s espresso. Finally, Draco sets down his demitasse.
As first kisses go, it’s. Well, it’s terrible. Harry just goes for it with his mouth open, misses the mark, and lands somewhere to the right of Draco’s lips. He corrects quickly and ends up clashing their teeth together and he’s pretty sure he’s just bitten Draco’s lip. Harry pulls back, and they stare at each other, Draco balefully rubbing his mouth.
And so, as the sun starts to set, they manage to get their trousers back on and make their way to the picnic table, where a delicious summer picnic has been laid out for them. Draco laughs himself hoarse at the sight of Harry trying to stab the chopped steak, and finally relents and makes sure Harry is well-fed. As it starts to cool off, Harry walks Draco back to the entry of the maze, and they wander back to Hogwarts, shoulders occasionally knocking together and exchanging grins. When Draco leaves Harry at the door to the hospital wing, they share one last kiss before Draco finally pulls reluctantly away.
Draco reaches out, and slowly slips off Harry’s shoes, dropping them to the floor. He casts a discreet cleansing charm and Harry laughs even as he shivers and Draco grins at him as he begins to run his hands up and down Harry’s legs.
“Well,” Draco says, and licks his lips. “Here’s what I’m thinking. This bark is kind of rough, and you’re in jeans. How about you with your back to the tree there, and me, on top of you.” He makes a gesture at his lower body. “Joggers. Easy access.”
Draco’s not too proud to admit that he flees the scene, shoulders hunched and ears burning. As he makes his strategic retreat, he starts to plot, thinking about what he’s just learned.
Harry slams back the shot and winces at the taste, wiping his mouth. He’s in the common room of the 8th Year Tower, surrounded by his friends, and for the first time, he feels something like hope beyond the heartache. Neville cranks up the stereo, Seamus pours another round of shots, and Luna is off by the window, carefully draping something that looks suspiciously like a rainbow feather boa around the window frame.
Harry reaches up, presses Draco’s hand to his own face, and then turns his head to press a gentle kiss into Draco’s fingers, curled around the handkerchief.
great when it all came out), he is proud that he spoke up (early and often, as Hermione likes to say) to advocate for forgiveness and inclusion, and now, months later, things have moved from uneasy truce to genuine friendships.
Draco rolls his eyes and lets go of Potter’s arm. “Okay, fine. I was just curious as to where you’ve been.”
Draco gave up feeling embarrassed about leaning on his friends for these nights twice a year a long time ago. He’d stopped feeling guilty after staying up all night with Ron, about five years after the end of the world. Ron had wept openly, curled around Draco in the dark. Draco had wept too, and had felt something in him let go that night, as he understood that he’d been forgiven.
Ron raps on the frame of the open door and sticks his head into the room, taking in the sight of Harry lying face down, starfished across his bed.
“So, uh…” he starts but cannot, for the life of him, think of how to finish that sentence as Malfoy, still holding his hand, draws him down the corridor.
,” falling from his lips as Draco moves, faster and faster, hurtling now towards the inevitable culmination.
Keely sets the plate down in front of him and Draco starts to eat. He’ll spend the morning working on the business of the extended estate. Reviewing the accounts, going over the investments, those sorts of things. The lawyers will arrive at 10:30 and stay until after the luncheon that Draco knows Keely’s been planning for weeks. After they leave, Draco will head to the sauna for the purification ritual. Draco actually loves this part, especially when Harry joins him in the sauna. Then he’ll walk the house, attic to cellar. After supper, once it’s dark, he’ll head out to walk the grounds. Magic requires that he trace the perimeter of the property, and spend time with the land. He knows the house elves have spent the last few weeks clearing the paths, and he’s thankful it hasn’t snowed much this winter. It’s going to be cold though.
“What’s the consequence?” Harry asks and can’t help but notice the way Malfoy is leaning forward, resting his chin on his hands, eyes gleaming in the light of the fireplace as he watches Harry, and Harry can’t interpret his expression at all.
Harry says, voice scratchy from sleep, “Late, like 3:00. We were just about to pack it in when the bastard showed.” The satisfaction is clear. “We got him dead to rights. Ron’s going in today to handle the charges.”
“Focus, Potter,” Malfoy says, his voice amused and Harry snaps his gaze from the curve of Malfoy’s jaw to his eyes.
The thing is, this magic constrains them all to consensual acts only. The Slytherins had been adamant about that. The Bottle cannot not force anyone to do anything they don't already want to do, and cannot involve another person in the Dare if that person isn't completely ready and willing to be involved (even if they don't quite know that fact until the Bottle decrees it). Luna had run the diagnostics herself and agreed. Only people who are willing will be involved.
Draco had inquired, just out of curiosity, fairly early on if that might be something Harry was interested in and he’ll never forget the way Harry had paused, and then looked at him, so direct and open, it had taken Draco’s breath away.
From there, they walk the third floor, the second, the first, and then the ground level. Every room, every inch of hallway and staircase. No part of the house is left untouched. Now down to the basement, all three levels including the dungeons. Draco’s learned that closing his eyes to the horror of his history not only does not protect him, it weakens his connection to the Lands. Everything must be brought into the light, he’s learned. Everything must be acknowledged and witnessed: the pain and the love. The terror and the comfort. The joy and the grief. It’s all part of his history, and it all must be observed and remembered.
Harry snorts at that and manages to get himself settled. Draco perches on the edge of the seat and just indulges himself in looking at Harry, really looking at him. Now that it’s allowed, he plans to get his fill. Given the way Harry flushes and he’s gasping for breath just at the sight of Draco staring, it seems to be working for him as well.
Harry flushes and shrugs, running a hand through his hair. “I just, I saw it. Made me think of you.”
He’s secretly thrilled that even after five years, Harry still automatically turns his hand to thread his fingers through Draco’s, and it still gives Draco butterflies.
Malfoy snorts, takes a sip from an actual crystal snifter, the pretentious bastard. “I’ve been here all evening, Potter.”
Harry snickers and opens his eyes. “Maybe so, but it seems a long way from not liking me at all to crying in your gin about how lovely I am.”
By the time they get back to the castle, it’s so late it’s early. The sky is just starting to lighten in the east, but the castle grounds are dark and silent, which is why Harry just about jumps out of his skin when they stumble into the entrance hall and it’s completely lit up.
Draco moves in, and Harry’s heart starts to race. This isn’t impulse, this is slow and deliberate. Draco’s eyes are locked on Harry’s and suddenly, Harry knows, it’s all going to be different from this moment. This is going to change everything. Draco’s hand comes up to curve around his cheek, and when Draco skims his thumb across Harry’s lips, he leaves sparks skittering in his wake. Then he closes the gap and presses his mouth to Harry’s.
And that’s saying a lot because Draco had his gay awakening by walking in on Blaise Zabini masturbating in the Slytherin showers.
Draco is shifting on top of him, and it’s good, so good, that it’s all Harry can do to keep from crying out, and then Draco does it again, and Harry starts to rock his hips too. He shifts his hands up, tracing over Draco’s ribs until he gets to his nipples and as he gently thumbs over them, Draco’s head drops back onto his shoulder and he moans.
She settles on to the bed next to Harry and he reaches out, smiling as she intertwines their figures.
“So, here’s the thing,” Harry says, managing to scoot himself up to sitting. “That was your fantasy, yeah?”
They look at each other, and then they’re moving, Draco grabbing Harry and yanking him close, Harry wrapping his arms around Malfoy and slamming their mouths together. It’s heat and passion, fear and relief, and Harry feels like he can’t get close enough to Malfoy.
. Draco takes a step closer to Potter, who is staring at him with undisguised hope and something else that looks a lot like longing.
“Okay,” Draco whispers. He gets to his knees, grabs the lube and slicks himself up, hissing a bit at the sensation.
Draco can’t help himself, and pinning Harry’s arms to his sides so he doesn’t accidentally stab Draco, he leans and kisses him, pouring everything he feels into the kiss. They kiss for long moments, mouth sliding over mouth, tongue over tongue, and finally, when Draco pulls back, Harry looks a little dazed.
And then, something occurs to Harry and he pauses, sits up, and presses one hand to Draco’s dick, who hisses at the contact.
The bark of the tree is rough and cold under his bare ass, but Harry doesn’t even care, he’s got an idea where Draco’s going with this, and he can’t fucking wait. Draco wiggles his own sweats farther down and holds out his hand.
Harry can’t help but be amused that Draco has managed to insult him and break open his heart in the best way possible, all at the same time.
“Potter,” Draco hisses and Harry just gives a hum, too distracted by the warmth of Draco’s skin under his fingertips.
Draco can picture it so easily. Can just see Harry walking by the stationery shop, pausing as his attention is caught by the window display. Imagines Harry opening the door, the way the bell would jingle, the way the salesperson would look up. The way Harry’s glasses would have steamed over in the warmth of the shop after the chill of the street. Draco can see it, so clearly, Harry chatting away, hands waving, asking questions. Choosing this one. For Draco. Because it reminds him of Draco. Because he loves Draco. Draco can see it.
“Mr. Malfoy,” she says, giving him a suspicious look. “What are you doing lurking about the teacher’s lounge?”
“God, yeah, that’s. Fuck, Draco, your fucking mouth.” Harry cracks his eyes open to peek at Draco sprawled out between his legs and slams them shut again when Draco grins and bites his lip. “You’re so pretty,” Harry moans and then flushes. “Didn’t mean to say that,” he mumbles, looking embarrassed.
Potter snickers. “I’ll have to tell them that’s what you called them. Of course, they don’t seem to have done much of a job of protecting me, since here you are.”
Harry sighs. “I want to hold you,” he says quietly, and Draco pushes himself up so he can see Harry’s face.
Draco reels him in for a kiss and wraps his arms around Harry, savouring this moment of quiet before he heads out into the dark night.
Harry can’t help laughing. One thing he’s learned about Draco in the past several months is that he’s as bad as Hermione when he gets a thought in his head, and he can’t help chasing it to every possible outcome he can imagine. Draco’s whip-smart, it turns out, but also deeply intellectually curious in a way that Harry just is not, and that look, that question, are very familiar to Harry from classroom discussions, dinner conversations, and even one particularly memorable shower argument.
Malfoy slows down and squints, then mutters something and the light brightens. There’s something there, maybe 100 metres away and it’s gaining on them. Harry catches a glimpse of eyes flashing red and then Malfoy shouts in alarm.
They’re stripped down to their pants, and Harry is currently mouthing his way across Draco’s chest, as Draco grasps at the sheets, his back arching into the wet heat almost involuntarily. It’s so good, so fucking good. It’s never been like this, Draco thinks. He has a feeling Harry Potter may ruin him for all other men. Draco suspects, in fact, he already has.
Harry hears those words all the time, Draco knows. People mean them in different ways, but they all say them to Harry. Strangers in the street, when what they mean is thank you. His friends with their impossible easy affection. The way Harry and Ron will give each other exaggerated kisses when they take their leave, while Hermione just shakes her head and laughs. The way Molly will look at Harry with exasperated fondness and swat him with a dishtowel as she says it. Harry hears those words all the time and says them too. Words come easy to Harry these days.
Harry keeps sucking until Draco’s batting weakly at his face with a hiss, even as Draco tries to get his breathing under control.
, for quite some time. He’s thought about it at work, watching Malfoy argue with the Judge. He’s thought about it here, at their local, watching Malfoy laughing with their friends, arm draped casually around Ginny’s shoulders. He’s thought about it when they go dancing. The way Malfoy moves on the dance floor particularly inspires Harry. The memory of that sight tends to keep inspiring him when he gets home, sometimes not even making it to the bedroom before he’s pulling himself out, hand moving frantically, gasping and groaning.
They make their way to the seventh floor, and then Malfoy drops Harry’s hand and moves forward, frowning in concentration, and after several breaths, a double door appears in the wall. It looks rustic, the wood is rough with wrought iron fittings, but it opens easily under Malfoy’s touch, and he moves back to let Harry precede him into the Room. Harry feels the light touch of Malfoy’s hand at the small of his back like a brand, and he’s already starting to get hard.
“I mean,” Draco begins and sees the way Harry withdraws. “No. Wait. I’d fucking love that. But what’s going on?”
The hubbub of the common room is cut off when the door closes and Harry can’t help but fully experience the utter awkwardness of the moment.
Harry hooks his chin over Draco’s shoulder and watches as Draco lets the oil spill down into his lap and carefully coats up the inside of his thighs.
As Harry listens to the slick sound of an oiled hand moving over what he assumes is a now fully erect cock, Harry reaches down and rubs his own prick. Which is also erect, Harry realizes. He’s gotten hard listening to the sound of Malfoy getting himself off. Huh. That’s new.
“You’re a mad man,” Draco says, but it comes out fond and affectionate. “It’s like you want to get caught.”
“Fine,” Malfoy says, sounding profoundly blasé, as if he hasn’t just shaken Harry’s world to the core with the hope that maybe, finally, they’ll move through this impasse. “Just so you know, Potter, I don’t put out on the first date.”
Harry unbuttons Draco’s jeans. Draco lifts his hips as Harry shoves the offending fabric down and gives a pleased hum as he leans down to press a damp, open-mouthed kiss to the hard length of Draco’s cock under the black cotton of his boxer-briefs.
Malfoy isn’t back yet, so Harry waits, uncomfortably aware that the game has clearly broken up, and everyone’s giving him a wide berth. Luna, Hermione and Pansy are huddled over the bottle, and Harry can smell the smoky scent of the diagnostic spells they’re casting.
He twirls his wand through his fingers and even as Harry opens his mouth to warn him to be careful, the wand flips over his knuckles and goes sailing down to the ground.
Draco’s done a bunch of research to try and figure out what might have gone wrong with Potter's potion to create that smoke cloud, and what it might have done to Potter, and he has some ideas, but nothing concrete, and he just really wants to
Ron’s face goes serious. “Yeah, mate. Ugly magic. C’mon, you have to actually present the flower to the bottle.”
They stare at each other and then Draco swallows and sighs, because he knows he’s not going to say no to this, and Harry’s grin widens.
“Uni-what-now,” Draco asks, trying to focus on what Potter is saying and not on his arse as he walks a couple of steps ahead of Draco.
Draco shifts, rolling onto his back and pulling Harry over with him, so he can wrap his arms around him. “We are really spectacularly good at that, I’ll have you know.”
Malfoy has opted to stretch his legs out, back up against the main trunk, wand gripped tightly in one hand. He’s closed his eyes, and his chest is heaving as they both start to come down from the adrenaline of the race.
“How’s your day?” Harry says, realizing he’s been silent far too long, staring at Malfoy, who is looking back with a puzzled expression.
Harry sees movement out of the corner of his eye, casts hard and there’s a scream. Ahead of him, there are three wizards locked together, facing him, and as he advances, he sees it happen. The middle one’s nerve breaks and she turns to run.
He puts his hands on Harry’s chest and gently shoves him down, and Harry goes willingly, tumbling onto the soft velvet of the comforter. Draco follows him down, and then they’re kissing again. Soon Draco’s moving from Harry’s mouth to his neck and Harry groans and turns his head to give Draco better access.
Harry sags forward, pressing his forehead into Draco’s back. He wraps his arms tight around Draco, as Draco slumps over, his head resting on his knees. Harry can feel the way Draco is gasping for breath as they both come down.
Harry gets to his feet, quickly unbuttons his own jeans, slides the zipper carefully down over his aching erection, and then kicks them off along with his boxers. He shoves Draco over onto his back, who goes willingly, a warm and amused look on his face.
“Of course I do,” Harry says fervently. “I mean, the Bottle wouldn’t have… it wouldn’t have given you the Dare, right? If I didn’t?”
Malfoy has lowered the paper to his knees and he somehow manages to combine defensive and vulnerable into an attractive flush. “It’s just. Perhaps.”
Draco glances down and then gives Harry a little smile. “I didn’t know, exactly. I wondered. Sometimes I’d see you looking at me.”
The paper lowers enough that Harry can see that one aristocratic eyebrow is arched in disdain. “Lovely? I think you’ve got delusions of grandeur.” The paper goes back up.
“Can you feel them?” Draco asks, fascinated. “How do you piss? I mean, it must make all sorts of things difficult.”
He quickly kicks off his own pants, and slides Harry’s boxer briefs down over his hips, taking a moment just to appreciate the sight before him. Harry Potter is lying there, in nothing but his own skin, flushed and hard, eyes bright as he grins at Draco, and then he deliberately bends his knees and opens for Draco.
in particular. Harry knows that he’s never been particularly known for his subtlety, but he’s quite sure no one’s picked up on these particular thoughts. Well, he's not entirely sure, actually. Hermione does often pat him understandingly and say things, "You know we love you for always, right, Harry?" and Ron says things like, "Malfoy's not a bad bloke, really," while making Very Meaningful Eye Contact.
Gasping, ears ringing, Harry collapses onto Draco, who doesn’t seem to mind the mess Harry’s just made of him, nor the weight of him. Draco just pulls him close, running his hands up and down Harry’s back as he whispers. It takes Harry a few moments to come down from his high before he realizes what Draco is saying.
Ron shakes his head. “Turns out she came down with mumblemumps earlier this week, so she wasn’t even on campus. They’ve arrested her at Mungo’s.”
the dinosaur exhibit, had spent weeks popping up at unexpected times with interesting dinosaur facts, so it cannot be a coincidence that there is now a very large, and probably completely anatomically correct T Rex guarding the entrance to the hedge maze, but why on earth is Potter out here engaging in the topiary arts?
They look at each other, and Harry shrugs. “We use the Seamus definition in Gryffindor for Never Have I Ever,” he says and Draco looks at him blankly. “Mutual intent to orgasm.”
The scortátus gives another of those very disturbing shrieks and kicks at the tree again, and Harry swears he feels the whole tree shake.
Harry sighs, realizing neither of them have come through this unscathed. In addition to Draco’s cuts and leg, the left arm of Harry’s robe appears to have been disintegrated, leaving his arm bare and blistered.
Draco sighs. He really doesn’t want to get up and face the day, and once more silently hexes the Head of Household status magic that requires these rituals of him, but if he doesn’t complete them, his ties to the Malfoy estates all over the world weaken, and the wards close against not only him, but his mother as well. So twice a year, Draco takes the time away from his shop and his potions to come back, to walk the house and the lands, to cast the magic that binds him to this place, even though it’s not his home anymore, and never will be again. He does it for his mother. Because he loves her, and because it’s what she needs.
Malfoy stops by the table where the others are working and says something quietly to Hermione, who just stops what she’s doing, looks at him for a long moment, and then nods. Malfoy returns it, and then they’re out the door, walking quickly down the wide stone steps.
Draco shifts and pulls them off. He’s gloriously naked now, fair skin flushing, and his cock is so hard, it looks almost painful. Harry glances up at him, licks his lips, and then leans over and takes Draco into his mouth. Draco cries out, his hands coming to rest lightly on Harry’s head.
“Hmm,” Harry asks, attempting to demonstrate interest in Draco’s thought process while simultaneously working on stretching out the neckline of his giant hoodie. Draco’s collar bones have been taunting him for ages and now that it turns out he’s allowed, he wants to put his mouth all over them immediately.
Harry runs a hand through his hair as the Bottle continues to spark gently. “Harry Potter, do you forfeit the Truth?”
Potter looks startled and a bit annoyed. “Yeah, the fluxweed was cursed, DMLE is looking into it. Anyway, Pomfrey’s been talking about me to you?”
But here’s something unexpected, Draco Malfoy slouching into the room like he owns it. Draco Malfoy looking around and then. For a moment Harry thinks he’s been caught as Draco’s eyes narrow as he looks at Harry’s bed, where Harry is lying under the cloak. But then he just smiles and turns away, walking towards his own bed.
“Anyway,” Draco says, peering down at the ground, “the scortátus seems to have settled down. This might work, Harry.”
“Hmmm,” Madame Pomfrey says, and then something shifts in her expression so that she looks first almost thunderstruck, and then very, very knowing in a way that makes Draco squirm uncomfortably. “Alright then, carry on.”
It’s very awkward because there’s really not anywhere for Harry’s legs to go other than for him to sort of slide them under Malfoy’s, who looks at Harry as if he’s gone just the tiniest bit mad, and then slowly bends his legs to make room.
He manages to get a rhythm going, shifting his hips to fuck up into the slick heat between Draco’s thighs, jerking his hand on Draco’s cock in tandem to the rhythm of his own lower body. Harry can barely move, can’t get any leverage, and somehow that makes it even hotter.
“Well,” Harry grins, bites his lip, and looks flirtatiously up at Draco through his ridiculously long, inky lashes. “Maybe I’ve thought about you.”
“No,” Potter says, his tone pleading and his face open and sincere. “I have, actually. Can we just. Come to the center with me, I’ve got some things there. Food.”
Finally, Malfoy comes out. He’s changed into comfortable grey joggers and a giant blue hoodie, and has a black beanie shoved onto his head. He’s got a knapsack similar to Harry’s, and he looks, well, delicious, Harry thinks. But also concerned.
,” he shouts that last part down to the large black shadow that’s stomping around, still making angry noises. “And if we don’t climb down, we’re going to have six fucking days of cock boils.”
Harry and Draco make their way to the large, cargo bay door, and out into the warm sunshine. They pause and Harry glances over at Draco, battered and bloody, but still here, still standing. Harry lets himself exhale, lets down his guard. They’re okay.
He’s dying to ask a million questions, like has Draco always known he liked boys, does he like girls too, does he like Harry specifically, is this something he wants, but he takes a breath and bites his tongue.
Malfoy casts, and Harry hears him shout as the shield flares up in front of Harry just in time, and the industrial equipment that’s been protecting him goes up in flames.
It’s an unseasonably warm day for mid-April, and Draco knows the hedge maze isn’t that far from the Hogwarts grounds, though students don’t tend to spend time there, what with it being generally overgrown and altogether creepy. Most of them have had enough of that to last a lifetime, thank you very much. Draco would generally include himself in that category, but the lure of Potter is too strong.
Harry feels like someone’s dumped a bucket of ice-cold water over his head. That’s right. Malfoy’s drunk.
There’s a moment of silence and then Harry says, tone absolutely smug, “Well, that was fucking fantastic.”
“Do that spell again,” he says, his voice low and rough, and it takes Harry a minute to find his focus.
He reaches out a hand and draws his fingers lightly over the bulge in Harry’s jeans and Harry shudders, trying not to fall out of the tree. They shift position, and Harry ends up sitting, back pressed up against the tree and legs stretched out. Draco starts to turn to face him, and Harry shakes his head.
Malfoy had said Harry’s name as he was coming. Does that mean something? Harry’s pretty sure that means something. He has absolutely
Which means everyone in the room now knows that Draco Malfoy wants to get Harry Potter off, and Harry Potter is completely and totally on board with that.
He wraps one hand around the base of Draco’s cock and settles into a rhythm, moving his hand in tandem with his mouth. His own cock feels impossibly hard, but right now, he’s fine waiting. This is about Draco, who is coming undone so beautifully under Harry’s touch.
“I can’t believe you, Harry,” Draco says, still laughing. “Did you really have to…” and then he freezes before turning slowly to look warily back at Harry.
Harry had come by to drop off the paperwork from his most recent case, a case that Draco will be prosecuting, because that’s his
Harry lies absolutely still, watching him go. It occurs to him, he’s going to need a shower as well, not to mention a change of clothes. He’s not entirely sure how he’s going to get himself out of his current predicament when Malfoy pauses in the doorway and then turns back to look directly at Harry’s bed.
Harry rolls over, murmurs something in a sleepy voice that Draco can’t quite understand, but he doesn’t need to. There will be time enough later for talking, for sex, for making plans, but for right now, all that Draco wants in this world is wrapped around him in this bed, grumbling as he tucks his frozen toes between Harry’s legs.
Instead, he’d turned to his friends. Ron and Hermione had somehow only become closer to him, and in the beginning, more nights than not had found the three of them piled into one of their beds. It wasn’t sexual, though Harry knows there were rumors. Rather, there’s something about the familiar feel of them next to him that’s helped him feel safe. Helped him to sleep.
Harry rolls back over, clearly almost asleep again even as he says, “Do you need me for the daytime stuff?”
“The problem is, Potter,” he says seriously and Harry snorts. “I do believe you’ve broken me, ruined me for anyone else.”
Feeling more grounded, Draco looks around the familiar room, leans back against the wall, and lets his eyes close. He takes a moment to scan his own body, his inner eye looking for tension or discomfort. He stretches over to release his lower back, wiggles his toes, feels the way the heat presses in, the way he’s starting to sweat. Then he stills his body and opens his mind, softly murmuring the incantation that invokes the Head of Household link.
It's a full moon, and there’s a chill in the air, and Harry wishes he’d thought to grab some gloves and a beanie. Malfoy looks cozy and cute in his giant hoodie.
Draco nods. He doesn’t love Harry’s Auror work, and he knows Harry doesn’t love it that much these days either. Things have calmed down since the war, and most of the time, Harry is dealing with the petty, day-to-day evils of peacetime. He’s not enjoying it much. Draco knows McGonagall’s been recruiting him to DADA for years, and he rather thinks next year may be the year Harry packs it in and accepts. Draco’s always known Harry was born to be a teacher, he’s just been waiting for Harry to catch up.
Draco snorts. “No, Potter, I’m not dating anyone. I’m not waiting for reasons other than, the timing just hasn’t been right, and I haven’t really been that interested after. You know.” He glances away.
“Yeah,” Malfoy says gloomily. “They’re really rare, which is good, but once they lock onto your scent, they don’t let go. They’re fucking relentless. The only option is to kill them before they kill you. I had no idea there were any around here.”
Suddenly exhausted, Harry shifts so he’s wedged in between Draco and the couch back. He curls around Draco, who’s still got his arms wrapped around Harry, holding him close. Harry can’t help the yawn that splits his face.
“I don’t,” Harry says delicately, “think Hagrid uses the same kind of assessment scale that we do for what counts as dangerous.”
Harry lands next to him, hovers anxiously and then grabs his wand. He quickly levitates the wreckage off of Malfoy’s leg, and casts a quick and dirty stasis charm. He pulls his sleeve down over his hand as he drops to his knees, and carefully wipes off the blood.
Harry follows suit, and as Draco presses back against him, skin to skin, Harry moves, turning so he’s tipping Draco over onto his back onto the soft couch cushions. There’s a sudden brush of magic over Harry’s skin and he blinks down at Draco.
. He hasn’t felt like this in so long, and isn’t it intriguing that it’s the sound of Malfoy’s voice getting him off?
The hedge maze appears empty as Draco approaches it. He doesn’t want to call out for Potter, because he is unquestionably here on a casual visit. If they meet up, they meet up. Draco shrugs internally. It’s cool either way. Obviously.
As he slides over the edge, feeling safe and warm and so close to Draco, he hears Draco whispers something back to him, and it’s not until they wake up hours later, not until Draco has pushed deep into Harry, moving within him with such power and grace that it almost makes Harry cry at how connected and intimate it feels, that Harry remembers what Draco had said to him.
Draco nods, hiding the excitement he feels in his belly. He knows Harry well enough to know that he doesn’t talk until he has something to say. He and Ron have a small wager riding on the timing. Draco thinks Harry won’t crack until after the Summer Solstice, when crime rates soar, while Ron thinks Harry’s just about fed up with the Ministry and will be putting in his resignation right after the holidays. Neither of them knows Hermione’s guess. She’s sealed it in an envelope and spelt it shut so that it won’t open until Harry’s decision is made, and no amount of poking and prodding at it can get it to open. Draco knows, he’s tried and has the paper cuts to prove it. In any case, it looks like Ron’s going to be claiming the winnings on this one, and Draco can’t even find it within himself to be upset. He just wants Harry to be happy, honestly.
“Granger,” he says, suddenly delighted, “There you are.” He raises one eyebrow at her because he knows it makes her laugh these days, and says, “Looking smashing, darling, simply smashing.”
Draco anticipates the buck of Harry’s hips, pressing him down as he wraps his hand around the part of Harry’s cock he can’t fit in his mouth. He lets himself breathe in, takes in the hot scent of Harry’s arousal, appreciates the way Harry’s cock tastes and feels in his mouth. He begins to move, hollowing his cheeks as he sucks, running his tongue over the tip, pressing down, and sucking.
Draco carefully slides down to the lower seating level and stands, anchoring himself on Harry’s shoulder for a moment.
Harry comes in the front door just as they’re heading in for lunch. He looks rumpled and windswept, and he’s got ink on his cheek, which means he went into the Ministry to finish his paperwork. Draco grins at him as Harry tosses his robes over the banister.
Now, Harry doesn’t really have anything against Draco anymore. The war seems to have burned all that out of Harry, especially when he’d heard at the trial what had been done to Draco to keep him compliant.
He’s lying in his bed under the invisibility cloak. He’s not doing anything, which is probably part of the problem. He’s just lying there, trying to find the energy to get up and do… something. It doesn’t matter what.
Draco indulges himself and just looks. Potter is lean lines and curved muscles, with a smattering of dark hair across his chest and a delicious trail that leads down to his… “Merciful mother of Merlin,” Draco whispers. “My god, Harry, if I’d known…”
Harry jumps in alarm as a sound like silvery chimes breaks the silence and a disembodied voice says, “The timer begins now. You have two hours.”
Harry swallows. This is really not how he’s imagined getting close and cozy with Malfoy, which is something he’s actually imagined rather a lot. He sighs and carefully climbs around Malfoy, and sits.
“How is he doing?” McGonagall asks, and his heart starts to quicken in anticipation because they can only be talking about Potter.
As Draco walks, he turns his gaze to the sky and that vast expanse of stars that stretches out above him. He knows they’re not unchanging or eternal, and perhaps nothing is, but they’re the closest thing to infinity he’s ever known.
“I mean,” Harry feels compelled to point out. “You did just have your tongue in my mouth. Pretty sure that’s a first-name-basis kind of activity.” He doesn't point out that Draco's just called him by name.
He remembers the feel of Harry under him, the taste of him and the scent of him, the way Harry had watched him as he’d come, and he knows, he’s ruined for anyone else. But, he thinks, as he recalls the look on Harry’s face as Draco had kissed him in the glow of the setting sun, the way Harry had pressed his forehead to Draco’s and murmured his name, and it settles into his gut, a deep and shining certainty, that whatever this is…
