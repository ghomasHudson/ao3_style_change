after I was released. It all went away.”
Then he turned to her, and said with a small smile, “Thank you, for keeping your workplace a secret and dragging me here under false pretenses. I appreciate it.”
Things even went well while he applied the initial Atmospheric Charms, though when he went to extend them into the vast space of the trunk’s interior things fell apart.
Potter put together his own drink then asked, “Anything wrong with the chair?”
The seeds were tossed into a bowl to deal with later, and he put the kettle on in what was now somewhat of a ritual. After preparing the two usual mugs he sat in his chair and asked, “Well? What brings you here?”
“And if Hermione’s the only one of your friends who knows that you’ve been meeting up with me. . . .”
“Not quite 800. I’m glad we checked that.” She opened the drawer and removed the broom, handing it over to Potter who whimpered faintly. Draco rolled his eyes at him; yes, the bristles were slightly singed but otherwise it looked much the same.
Draco looked at him steadily for a few seconds, not detecting any sarcasm, only a strange sort of bumbling awkwardness so he snorted softly and shook his head. “Get out of here, Potter, before you somehow manage to strain yourself.” Then he stepped inside.
It was a minute or two before he heard Potter’s feet hit the front step. “You ordered a dozen brooms. No one needs a dozen brooms, unless it’s a team, or a school, or a company that sends employees out on long flights. What could you possibly need that many brooms for?”
Mercifully the man was lying on his stomach, so Draco didn’t have to see his dark nipples, the abs, the trail of black hair leading down to—
Potter shook his head. “Oh, no. I’m talking about the hag.” He gestured up toward the heavy curtains that Draco had assumed concealed a window.
help, even if it’s just to offer an additional set of eyes, or a different perspective. Harry doesn’t want you to get hurt.”
Draco did sneer at that. As horrid as Potter was, McLaggen was practically a caricature of his worst personality traits. “Absolutely not. It’ll have to be you.”
Once or twice Draco considered writing to Nimbus but then just as swiftly dismissed the idea, deciding that if they required him to have a minder to use the brooms that he’d paid them for, they probably wouldn’t care that his brooms were essentially being held hostage.
Draco swallowed; he hadn’t thought of that at all.
He took his time setting up the brewing stations, knowing that it would be a few hours until the house emptied. Once they were arranged to his satisfaction he sat down on the floor and began putting together an ingredient list.
Potter let out a heavy breath and spun around. “All right.” Then he looked around the cabin, glanced out the window, then shook himself slightly. “All right,” he repeated. “I need to go. We obviously can’t work in this weather, and I didn’t exactly plan to come here anyway tonight—I don’t even have the brooms. Shit, and I still need to settle my tab. I’ll be back next week.” Then he Disapparated on the spot.
Draco released the nipple and caught Potter’s mouth once again, raising his hands to cup the man’s jaw, ignoring his aching cock for more of the man’s taste.
“Malfoy!” a voice outside yelled. A familiar voice.
Potter jogged a few paces to catch up, then walked alongside him. “And the rock?”
Draco felt the touch throughout his body as it seemed to travel up his arm, into his bloodstream, then straight to his groin. He swallowed, and unable to tear his gaze away he reached to the side and slid his mostly-full glass onto the table.
people, magic or not.
“I’ll need you to put some sort of identifying mark on this specific broom,” he finally said, “and bring it out the next time we get to work. I need to see if the warmth remains, or if it needs to be reapplied.”
“Does it look like there’s traffic?”
“And tomorrow is Sunday,” she continued when he didn’t respond, “so I’ll have the lab prepared for us with no interruptions. . . .”
He could see fingers twisting in the sheets and slowly made his way back up toward the heavy cock, giving it a long swipe with his tongue before slowly taking it into his mouth, inch by inch, allowing it to slide into his throat, swallowing the hot flesh and his own moans. He took his time, savouring the man and the delicious noises he was making. As the fingers moved to his hair and pulled, and twisted, and grew frantic he slowed further, making sure to taste every part of the offered member, not wanting to miss a thing.
to end in a fit of passionate hatred, as had always been their way.
Amazingly there was no cursing, no stomping, no dramatics of any sort as they made their way through the woods. Once they’d arrived Draco took a seat on the dry ground, crossing his legs, and accepting the mangled broom that Potter handed over.
Vince just blinked at him.
Potter cracked a wry grin and replied, “A little yeah.” Then he sobered and continued, “She refused to tell me anything or listen to anything I had to say until she’d interrogated me about my personal life for the past ten years.”
“I’d almost think you unable to stay away,” Draco said lightly even as he felt constricted by the words.
He nodded. “It came together quite nicely. You’re welcome to see it, if you like.”
“What do you mean, yes? You’re not moving into my cabin, Potter.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
It was a bit after eleven when he arrived, and while he was still bracing himself he heard the door to the drawing room open and the sound of laughter and voices carry down from the first floor.
“Anyway, make that list and do let me know if you need any additional equipment,” she told him, before swiftly leaving the room and racing down the stairs.
And sometime later, when they were both sated, Draco sprawled on his back with Potter tucked against his side, snoring gently, he was awake for what felt like hours, terrified by the thought of being trapped here with this man, but just as afraid of leaving Earth and not coming back to him.
“Another six hours?”
“Kreacher popped out to retrieve some things from the cabin,” Draco explained. “I hope that’s not a problem?”
Potter looked at the towel with what may have been confusion before he slowly hung it up on the spare hook by the door and instead used a spell to dry himself.
Once they arrived at the clearing Potter immediately made for his rock, then made a sound in his throat. “It’s still warm,” he noted, then felt the surface of the stone. “Not even melted snow on it. It’s dry.” He sat down.
The man was looking down at Draco’s bare feet. “Aren’t you cold? It’s fucking November.”
“Like I said. Enjoy the sights.” Then rather than draw attention to the fact that Draco was obviously staring, he dragged him along the pier, occasionally pointing at the odd building, wandering into a few and acting oblivious to the fact that he had no reason nor right to be poking around in random warehouses.
“Stop that!” the man yelled, quite red in the face. “What is
There were shouts, and desperate cries, and he continued his movements, until it was only the weight of his arms holding those hips against the bed that prevented them from thrusting into the air, and he was swallowing the thick ropes of come, lapping it all up, kissing along the entire expanse of skin up to Potter’s gasping mouth.
“I’m hearing a lot of ‘if’ and ‘probably’, Potter. Will you be able to do this or should I just put up with McLaggen? It’s that or you can keep all of the brooms, and I’ll give Firebolt my business.” He looked on as the man nearly shredded the papers, his fingers were clenched so hard.
“What happened?” Draco asked. The last thing he remembered was being in the water, and trying to surface. It had been dark; if his
The man fell with a soft smile and held his arms out to Draco, beckoning him closer.
He snorted and shook his head slightly, turning his focus to the task at hand.
“It was,” Draco agreed, then with a sneer he added, “but they couldn’t be bothered to release me after the ten years. I didn’t get out until the last week of December.”
“Hmm? Oh, it doesn’t hurt, does it? Shit, sorry—”
“Quite productive. Illuminating.”
There was also a letter on the small kitchen table within that Draco cracked open with shaking hands, seeing a palm-sized wooden disk engraved with the word 'HOME' fall out and clatter onto the table.
Draco exchanged a look with Vince, who had been so put out by the loud outbursts that he’d retreated into the cabin and was perched on the edge of the wash basin.
If anything, that only encouraged Potter to shake the bottle of hot sauce even more vigorously over his plate of gallo pinto. Draco was beyond sneering at this point. His face was so twisted in revulsion that the small child at the next table over had erupted in giggles, and he couldn’t even sneer at her in response because his face wouldn’t contort any further.
The amused expression didn’t fade, so Draco ignored it.
After lunch Draco spent some time stretching, mostly focusing on his arms, then retreated to the drawing room to continue his potions research.
Vince responded with a series of short hoots.
“This isn’t going to work,” came the voice from behind him and that old irritation finally ignited, spitting inside his chest.
“Draco, it’s the 28th tomorrow. A month since you were released from hospital.”
Weasley finally looked away from Draco and instead focused on her, his expression one of bewilderment. “
“So, spaceflight. I hear you’re quite determined to achieve it on your own. That’s ambitious.”
Draco looked down, and took a shaky breath. Then he nodded. He could try to do that much.
Potter let out a heavy breath. “All right. I’ll need to let Hermione know once we get there, since St Mungo’s will have probably already told her that you’ve been released, but I’ll try to hold her off for a day or two. Given that she hasn’t calmed down yet and it’s been over two weeks I’m not going to lie and say that you won’t get a verbal lashing.”
Draco reflected on the past couple of hours and blinked some more. “I can honestly say I’m not quite sure what happened. I somehow managed to entertain Eddie, though I’ve no clue how. They were all rather friendly though, so I suppose you can say ‘I told you so.’”
A pause, then, “You could.”
He was still muttering to himself while he tidied up from lunch, then he leaned back against the kitchen work surface, attempting to think. Feeling that his face was still uncomfortably warm with his frustration he decided to head out for a long hike to cool off, organise his head, and think about nothing related to aggravating men.
“No magical modifications. Just assault,” he replied, and Draco snorted at Hermione’s expression.
?” Draco glared at the liquid that was running down the wall to form a puddle on the floor and grabbed a towel to clean it up.
Then, so slowly it almost hurt, he dragged his thumbs along Draco’s knuckles in an unmistakable caress.
Draco sighed and leaned back in his chair. “I’m not going to hurt myself. Go out with your friends. Invite them here if that’s what you typically do, and I can stay in my room to not put you in an uncomfortable situation. Don’t put your life on hold for me, for Merlin’s sake.”
When Draco arrived Hermione was busy sending the vast amounts of clutter off to one side of the space, neatly stacking it all against the far wall.
Draco rolled his eyes and left the clearing, instead choosing to walk the woods and collect any fallen seed clusters. The majority went into a pocket, but a few he kept in hand and unfurled their papery husks while he made his way back to the clearing. He emerged from the tree line with a palmful of seeds a quarter of an hour later.
He had no interest in living alongside
It was on the tip of his tongue to refuse to answer but hearing the pain in his voice, and reflecting on what the past two weeks must have been like for him, Draco decided he deserved at least this much.
It had only been five days but it very well could have been years, the way that Draco instinctively clung to him, his fingers digging into the cabled jumper and his lips moving against Potter’s, their tongues tasting each other’s greedily.
She took a long sip and sighed, her eyes drifting closed for a few seconds before they snapped open again. “I hope Harry wasn’t too much of a bear when you two spoke?”
“Besides, I think the project is fascinating. I looked into it of course and did you know, there’s been no recorded research into magical spaceflight in Britain? It’s silly, especially since muggles have been going to space for longer than the Internet has been around.”
Vince only clicked his beak irritably at that and turned to face the wall.
So, possibly an interaction with the Extension Charms. Or maybe the materials?
On Monday Fry declared that the week would be spent reviewing all that they’d covered in the previous year, and Draco imagined he wasn’t the only one hoping their teacher would get laryngitis and cancel their classes.
“What, assaulting me with photography?”
. . .
Potter had a shifty sort of look on his face then. “Will you be able to cast whatever spells you need, or do you need me to do that for you?”
“I’m surprised you didn’t just hack bits off with your knife to make it identifiable,” Potter replied sarcastically.
do you want to go to space so badly? I mean, I get that it would be an amazing accomplishment, and an incredible experience, but why the rush? Why the secrecy?”
There was a clicking of talons from the direction of Vince’s perch, and Draco felt a bubble of laughter rise from his chest and burst out of his mouth as he was overcome with unexpected relief.
Silence.
Draco rolled his eyes at the Gryffindor colours and started making his way back to the cabin.
Draco opened eyes he hadn’t realised he’d closed and looked around at the pier, taking in the sight of the little sailboats that were scattered over the very blue water halfway between the edge of the docks and the opposite shore. Quite a bit farther down the pier there was an enormous boat, so large that he even hesitated to call it a boat and not a floating fortress painted in gleaming white, absolutely covered in rows and rows of windows. Between where they stood and that monstrosity there were plenty of people walking along the water’s edge, some at a leisurely pace looking downward at their mobiles, others taking photographs of the view.
it’s all dated. So when we get back I can pull these off and, I dunno, print them.”
?” he blustered. “Hermione, don’t tell me you knew that he was here and you didn’t even say anything?”
Potter’s face was doing its painful-looking contortions again, so Draco finished his meal and rose to deal with the tea. When he brought the mugs over the man asked in his most hesitant voice yet, “Would you want to meet them?”
Eventually, after Eddie finished eating and grew bored with the grown-up conversations the boy toddled over toward Draco and sat himself on the ground at his feet, and proceeded to babble on about some stories that he thought probably had something to do with his toy, though the thoughts were so disjointed and his vocabulary wasn’t exactly robust that Draco found himself simply nodding and sharing simple responses such as, “I see,” and, “Of course.” That didn’t seem to faze the child at all though as he carried on quite happily until the platters of food were clear, Azzy and Luna were quite rosy-cheeked, and Susan was making noises about returning home.
Vince returned in an almighty snit, dropping a mangled and bloody field mouse on his chair after he was let in, then promptly swooped out again to spend the next several days in the woods.
“Oh god, oh yes, please. . . .” Potter was rambling, his fingers scrabbling at the wood while Draco ran an oiled finger along his crease, pausing slighting over his entrance before continuing lower, softly rolling his bollocks in his palm, then sliding his finger back again, holding it against the quivering muscle, pressing ever so slightly, and finally sliding two digits into Potter’s warmth.
. . . too dark . . .
Then he followed his mother down the lane.
“There. Perfect,” Potter said, setting the small bottle down next to the salsa lizano between them, before shoving a heaping forkful of rice and beans in his mouth and releasing a contented sigh.
And suddenly it was as if the afternoon of academic discussion hadn’t happened, and he was out of his depths. He rose to his feet as she stood and donned her coat, and he followed her out to the front of the cabin. She bade him a perfectly polite and friendly farewell, told him to give her love to Harry, and then she was gone.
—finally freeing the fabric and revealing access to the warm skin beneath.
Draco spun around and called out, “Catch!” before tossing the broom over to Potter, who quickly scrambled to his feet and snatched it out of the air. Then he poked it curiously a few times.
Potter nodded with a serious expression.
He didn’t expect the puzzled look that Potter gave him. “But Ron doesn’t know.” Then he tilted his head, and added, “Well, he knows that you’re out of Azkaban, I’d imagine. But I didn’t really know how to bring up the broom thing, and it doesn’t really affect him at all, you know? You’re entitled to live your life, and whether you choose to do something absolutely barking with some brooms doesn’t really affect anyone other than you and Nimbus, and therefore me.”
The man's joyful laughter accompanied them down to the hotel pool, where once they'd changed into swim trunks Potter shoved an enormous glass of alcohol, too many straws, and miraculously several glorious ice cubes into Draco’s hand and then snapped a picture of him holding it against a flushed cheek.
“I thought I’d help out. Got here a bit early, so I figured I’d make myself useful,” Potter said, his hand messing up his hair.
Suddenly there was a large rock sitting heavy in the pit of Draco’s stomach. “I—sort of. I was . . . aware of that being a thing that could happen, in an academic sense, but it didn’t exactly register that I was in a situation where it would apply.”
“I’m not your boyfriend,” he said, calling up that prior argument, though his tone was soft.
Potter leaned back, giving him a cocky little smirk. “Well, I used to enjoy it, but these days there’s been this rich prat who has me at his beck and call. Makes me wonder why I bother with the job sometimes.”
He felt Potter’s huff more than he heard it, then the sensation of a whisper in his ear made him shiver. “I told you that weeks ago.”
“Sometimes I wonder if you have an internal clock that screeches at you if you haven’t blown something up in too long,” he said once they’d arrived and made their way to the attic brewing station.
Draco nodded. That was certainly the least he could do, after the man had saved his life. Again.
Finally, when Draco was feeling less surly and Potter appeared to have as much energy as a new crup, they headed out to the car that had been arranged for their journey. He ignored when his partner jokingly offered him the keys, then leaned back against the passenger door when the man abruptly turned and jogged back toward the counter.
He heard Potter take a few steps closer. “I know that. I’d like you to stay.”
Draco considered, for at least thirty seconds, whether it was wise to share his actual plans with Potter, but ultimately decided to err on the side of caution, privacy, self-preservation, and everything else that had kept him alive thus far in his remote home in the woods. So he simply sat there and sipped at his tea, observing as the tension dissipated and turned into something more . . . subdued. Melancholy, perhaps.
Draco frowned, and set down his fork. “You mean to tell me that you told Granger, and she didn’t feel the need to share it with Weasley.”
“Any questions?” Hermione asked, speaking over him.
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco interrupted, then grabbed the mugs and was just turning with them when Potter said, “No really, I can—” and had apparently moved closer because suddenly Draco was stepping right into him and he dropped both mugs in surprise at the sudden impact.
“Malfoy?” Potter asked then, sounding uncertain. As if there was even the slightest chance the man didn’t recognise him.
Draco nodded.
He watched as Potter seemed to redden even further, then suddenly it was as though all of the fight left the man, and he slumped forward, resting his elbows on his knees, hanging his head.
“It’s me,” came Potter’s voice.
The next day he found the trunk in the clearing, already attached to the three brooms that they’d completed. Inside the trunk there was an entire two-bedroom flat, furnished, with hot running water in the bathroom and a full pantry complete with Preservation Charms.
He sighed. “I know. I thought about getting rid of it all, but a part of me just couldn’t, you know? I couldn’t help but think ‘What if?’”
“Well, that’s the good thing about this,” the man said, glancing up at him briefly before looking back down.
“It looks like you finished the addition?” Potter finally asked.
Draco spun around, seeing a disgruntled sort of expression on the owl’s face. “What the fuck was that?” he blustered, waving his arms around before remembering that he was still holding his mug, scowling as tea sloshed out and sprayed across the wall.
Draco’s right hand was still held captive so he reached forward with his left, searching blindly for Potter’s leg and instead hitting something hard that clattered loudly. Fumbling slightly, trying to just move the mobile out of the way there was a click then a blinding flash, and as they both flinched back there was another one.
In the wrong direction, if he was trying to return to the clearing.
“Kreacher is here to watch over Master’s guest,” he said, standing next to the door.
the brooms. But I can see how you might have interpreted that as an idle
“We were out there in the water for almost four hours, all told. Things seemed fine, completely fine. Then when you started to climb I figured you were done, and started to make my way to the surface as well. Then you veered hard to the left, spun upside down, and you must have fallen unconscious because you let go of the broom and were just hanging there limp.”
For the first half hour of flight through the water Draco kept a careful eye on the size of the bubble, the quality of the air he was breathing, the temperature, and they remained constant as far as he could tell. Then he began to actually pay attention to his surroundings, and while the sand, rocks, and seashells of the ocean floor near the coast weren’t terribly interesting, the landscape changed once he reached Mewstone Ledge and glimpsed the forest of kelp swaying in the current, the tiny fish flitting in and out of sight.
The interior of the cabin smelled sweet when a loud crack announced his visitor. He stepped away from his stirring long enough to open the door then returned to his task.
He nodded, then asked, “Kreacher, are there spare tables in any of the rooms that aren’t being used?”
“It looks good,” Potter said in greeting, tilting his head as if to gesture toward the back of the cabin. “Is it done?”
Not releasing the captured flesh his pressed his hands forward to the man’s flies and quickly dealt with them, pulling down his waistband and pants as far as he could in their position to release his straining cock, hearing himself moan as the smell of arousal hit his senses. Then he wrapped his hand around the length, smearing a thumb through the pre-come that was gathered at the tip and started to stroke hard, flicking his tongue against the abused nipple all the while.
“I told her because I know that she can help, and that she’d want to help, and because I don’t want you to fucking die.” And despite the fact that Draco was a good three inches taller than Potter he felt small, trapped between the man’s intensity that seemed to fill the room and the edge of the basin, unable to do anything except look into his eyes.
“Foraging?” Draco slid his gaze to the side and caught a perplexed look on Potter’s face, which quickly morphed into worry.
“I’m sure you loved that. You did always enjoy bragging about yourself,” Draco said with a smirk.
Draco closed the distance, his brow quirked. “Feeding me, now? Worried I’ll starve out here in the woods?”
Potter’s hands clenched into a fists, bending the papers where he was gripping them. “Well
“It’s good to see you looking so well,” Azzy said in a soft voice. “I know it’s been a long time since we last saw each other, but I’m glad you’re doing all right.”
Draco frowned at the enthusiasm she was presenting. “There aren’t ingredients here?” he asked, thinking of the long line of purebloods who surely would have had their own stock, at least of the more common items, if not the rare and valuable ones.
The food was delicious. Of course it was. Other than the horrid habit Potter had of smothering everything in spicy death whenever he had the opportunity—and fortunately he only ever committed that crime against his own portions, thank Merlin—he seemed to have a good grasp of Draco’s tastes. Though that shouldn’t have been surprising at any point, given how obsessive the two of them had been about each other at Hogwarts.
He pressed the indent again and was released, and couldn’t help but smile in satisfaction.
“Before we get started, I need to go over some health and safety,” Hermione said primly, ignoring a scoff and an eye roll from Potter. “First, at no point should you enter the chamber when that sign is illuminated,” she instructed, indicating a large portion of the wall with the faded words ‘IN USE.’ “Even if it looks like nothing is happening in there. Even if you’re tired of waiting for the light and can’t imagine that anything could possibly go wrong.” She was staring hard at Potter, and Draco felt a small smirk playing at his lips.
“You might also consider using a physical vessel to take care of some of the protection, rather than relying solely on broom enchantments. That could also help with heat dispersal, and might offer improved protection against radiation. And it would give you a space in which to install Gravity Charms so that you can retain muscle mass and bone density and preempt
Draco snapped his eyes open, took in the dimly lit surroundings that included a bed, and managed to make his mouth form the word, “Off.” He could feel his chest heaving with the effort it took to breathe, and he was blinking hard, but he needed this.
They sat there in the quiet drawing room for a little while longer, before Draco said, “I’m not necessarily going to attend more Saturday lunches.”
“You know, I’m surprised you’re enchanting the air around the broom to be warmer. I thought you wanted protection from heat?” Potter said in a too-casual tone.
“Well, it’s more comfortable than the floor in here. And it’s not so bad.”
Fire immediately filled the room, brightening gradually as the seconds passed. Hermione was staring intently at a display on the console; when Draco looked over, he saw that there were several readouts, including a temperature gauge. The needle was slowly rising on it, and when it passed 750 degrees a symbol started flashing.
He double checked the measurements, then made a few notches with his knife so that he wouldn’t need to restart from scratch before setting the block of wood aside. “Potter.”
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Potter asked in a quiet voice, his expression heavy and solemn.
established protections for yet?”
Then he sat there on his heated front step thinking about the warming temperatures and realised it was probably late enough in the season that the birch trees would be ready for tapping, and set out with several containers and his tree taps.
It was becoming more difficult to understand the words and form an intelligible response, since Draco just wanted to sink into the warm pressure. At least a minute passed before he replied, “I’d assumed they were affected by the curse scars being there. Those can prevent healing.”
Swing.
The fact that his partner was actually saying the words, and not simply racing off and doing it, gave Draco pause. “How long have you been considering this?” he asked carefully.
He swallowed hard, turned his head away, and finally opened his eyes. His breathing was still uneven.
Hermione dropped the broom into what appeared to be a long drawer underneath a console covered in buttons bearing numbers, letters, and strange symbols. A moment later the broom appeared on the floor of the chamber below and she tapped at a series of buttons. Then she flipped a switch and the sign on the wall lit up bright yellow.
“Potter?”
Nine months.
“You might not be aware,” he began slowly, “but I happen to be disgustingly wealthy.”
Draco’s fingers closed around the folds of the blanket as he remembered the reason that Potter had been out that day. “I think I’ll stay here, if that’s all right.”
Looking carefully at the broom he removed a knife from his belt, openly rolling his eyes at the sight of Potter immediately raising his wand in alarm, and hacked off a good third of the bristles on the right side. Accompanied by the sounds of spluttered indignation he kicked off from the ground again and did the same laps, turns, and braking, paying close attention to the difference in reaction times and fluidity of movement, noting how much the physical change impacted the flight and how much it was still helped along by magic.
The rest of the morning was spent reading old issues of the
“Go for a walk. It’s beautiful out. The
“No,” he agreed.
His father’s grave wasn’t too far from the edge of the cemetery, nor was it terribly ostentatious, unlike many of the others nearby. The gravestone rose to his mother’s waist and was made of marble, of course, but it lacked the gargoyles, statues, fountains, and other monuments that were present elsewhere.
Potter let out a bark of laughter. “Why would I want to upset her further? If things go well with Andromeda she’ll probably become a part of Teddy’s life. If I break my word on this can you honestly say that she won’t use Teddy against me in the future?”
Draco still hadn’t recovered from the vulnerability he’d felt during their time in the drawing room, so he didn’t look up, instead focusing on the coat in his hands. He wanted to stay. He absolutely wanted to crawl back into the man’s bed and lose himself for the rest of the night. But he was a coward.
—wait, I thought you were taking it underwater? Why do you need to know about heat limits?”
He forced himself to relax. True, Potter could be lying but he’d always been a terrible liar, so Draco wasn’t so sure. And he truly didn’t think the man would go spreading the photos around, given how decent he’d been these past many months.
Then he rose to his feet. “That broom can go back in the bag for transport,” he said, pointing at the one with the red ribbon. “The other one should stay out, so that I can compare the two next time you’re here. Will that be a problem?”
He closed his eyes, his chest tightening further.
He spent the next hour or so fiddling around with the charmwork, then stood to stretch and walk around the clearing a bit, the cold from the ground having seeped through his trousers. Then he stopped and his frown deepened as he thought, looking between the broom, the ground, and then Potter. Well, more specifically, Potter’s rock.
“Fuck no,” Potter breathed and in one fluid motion had flipped open the blanket and straddled him, one hand still gripping Draco’s and the other delving into his hair. His lips were hot where they pressed against Draco’s, and his tongue brushed against his, licked at his lips, stroked the inside of his mouth, not stopping, every movement sending a jolt of arousal through him.
been quite a long time. I’m sure that he’ll even welcome you to our get-togethers in the future.”
Some amount of time later, once their bodies had cooled and Draco found himself shivering, they rose from their position. Before Draco could even think about making his way upstairs there was the tingle of a Cleaning Charm, then Potter was wrapping the blanket around him.
The next morning several owls arrived bearing order forms and after perusing them Draco sent off a note to Hermione asking her opinion on a few of the selections. He received a response by that afternoon and soon after sent Vince out with several orders for luggage and portable structures.
“What type of experiment was that supposed to be, exactly?” Potter asked, and the tone could have been scathing, or confused, but Draco only listened enough to register the words before dismissing them as unimportant.
“What are those?” he asked in an undertone. “We’re not authorised to ask to see Experimental Breeding permits, but surely we should mention them to someone. . . .”
“Don’t just ignore me! This is it, isn’t it? You want to fly a fucking broom to space! You can’t
Potter smiled tightly then looked back down at his mug. “Vince. Right.”
They’d arrived at the clearing, and Potter simply looked at him for several long seconds before retrieving the broom with the ribbon and handing it over.
“Fuck!” Potter practically shouted, his legs lurching briefly as they spasmed.
Susan, meanwhile, simply smiled at him and said, “Well, it was lovely to see you under nicer circumstances, Draco. If you have any trouble with any of my coworkers do let me know.”
And he had frown lines.
“Oh, right. Underwater flight? I suppose that could work. I mean, you can cast it on yourself and fly on a broom just fine.”
“And you’re surprised no one thought to check if they had a bank holiday here? You
of it. Merlin, what a thought.
“The photos,” Draco said quietly once he managed to find his words. “When we get back, and you do whatever you need to do to get them off of this thing. . . . Can I have a copy?”
There was a single hoot, so short it sounded like a laugh.
tea.”
The morning had dragged on for an eternity after that.
Draco and Hermione quickly got to work, marking out their circle in the snow and proceeding to test the temperature thresholds. They found the lower limit to be sufficient for the coldest locations on Earth but not enough to comfortably withstand a temperature drop near the planet’s atmosphere, should he remain there long enough for the residual heat within the bubble to slowly dissipate, and that didn’t factor in the colder temperatures in deeper space. Hermione then took out her notebook and proceeded to work on some incredibly complex calculations, before beginning to adjust the charms on the broom.
He finished the adjustments on the broom and handed it back to Potter, then asked for a new broom. He applied the same charms to that one and conjured a bow on the end in green and silver with a flourish, startling a laugh out of the other man. Then he dropped onto the ground next to the rock, only realising how close he was to Potter’s legs once he was seated.
“I thought you’d be happy to be home. I wouldn’t have thought there was much around that house to keep you entertained.”
—fuck me—Draco need you—”
“After the classes, and four more years of probation. Though who knows if they’ll actually bother to cancel the Trace at that point.” Then he silently thought to himself that it wouldn’t matter, since he’d hopefully be long gone by then.
. Hermione had sent over some potions references and Draco passed the time quietly reading through them, making notes about possible solutions to their heat shielding problem. And often he’d awake at strange hours hearing Potter clatter down the stairs, and find himself on the sofa surrounded by books.
“Thank you, Draco,” she said mildly, as if he had made a bland comment about the weather. “Have you apologised to Harry?”
was certainly long-gone.
Draco was lifting a log that weighed a fucking tonne when Potter yelled his name, despite being
“Merlin,” he breathed, reaching out to touch the surface. Thankfully, his beer-addled brain hadn’t purchased an enchanted mirror so he didn’t need to suffer a response.
“Harry tells me you’ve changed. I see that, in part,” she replied, her gaze flitting quickly around the cabin, briefly pausing on the small bookcase next to his chair, before returning to meet his steadily, “and I also know that what you’re attempting has so many different possible ways to fail that you might not even know about. I’m fairly certain that I
“I destroyed Dumbledore’s office once,” Potter replied, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was also attempting humour.
Draco’s free hand gripped Potter’s hip, holding him close. He could feel the heat emanating from the front of the man’s trousers, could feel the hard length there pressing against his own erection, groaning as each minute movement made him impossibly hard.
“No response,” he whispered, feeling a shiver run through him.
clothing underneath.
He considered, then decided that if he needed to do his experiments in front of Potter anyway there was no point in being secretive about the adjustments he was planning. “First would be the Bubble-Head Charm.”
“All right then. I doubt I’d be here that early.”
“Nice,” he said, picking up the broom again. “And to release it?”
, that was one time,” Potter whined.
Draco was just opening his mouth to say something—he didn’t know what, only that it would definitely be rude and he wouldn’t feel the least bit guilty about it—but Potter continued even louder. “But, I’ll explain the situation to them and see what information they can give me.”
And then Christmas arrived, and with it the weekly screech of the miserable eagle owl.
By the time he had eased his way down the stairs and found the kitchen in the basement it was quarter to nine.
There was a pause, and Draco looked over to see a resigned expression on the other man’s face. “Potter, I know my mother. She didn’t just agree to give up. Not without something else in return.”
Instead his arm wrapped around the man’s waist and held him, as his hips continued to twitch, as his eyes remained shut, as his throat was choked with what felt like the most terrifying of emotions.
Draco nodded distractedly. “And was I supposed to recognise Azzy?”
He let out a short breath through his nose and had a drink of the ouzo, steeling himself. “You’ve been taking photos of me though,” Draco pointed out. “In fact, I’d wager the majority of those photographs are of me, not of the
“You managed to fall asleep at the table last night. I hope you don’t mind that I brought you up here.”
It was very still for a moment, very tense, then Draco couldn’t contain his derisive snort. “I may have the Trace, but I don’t plan on casting anything punishable, don’t you worry.”
Draco just looked at him pointedly and didn’t reply.
Potter exhaled hard, glowering. “Look. You can’t. It’s mad. It’s dangerous, and you’ll die, so you can’t do it. Okay? Find some other hobby.”
Potter aimed an intent sort of frown at him that Draco couldn’t begin to understand, then mumbled something and returned to his room. Shaking his head in bemusement he returned his comb and towel to his room before setting off to start his day.
“You finished it before Christmas? I think I remember noticing the door on Saturday.”
Potter cried out desperately, his words turning into pleas as he pressed back into the fingers, rocking against Draco as best as he could with his limited space. One of his hands had stopped attempting to find purchase on the door and was reaching down toward his neglected cock and so Draco leaned forward and ordered, “Hands off.”
He was still lost in thought when he handed one mug over to Potter. He then leaned against the wall, taking a scalding sip from his own mug. If the brooms weren’t tested and graded for the heat that he would encounter in the atmosphere, then he would need to both find a magical shield that would protect him at those high temperatures, and also find a way to test it. Somehow.
He shook his head as he switched his stirring direction, focusing on his count. Then he set his stirring rod aside and turned toward the man. “I can’t say that I understand that, no. Any of my fond memories of my family exist in my head. I didn’t go back to the Manor for any
“I didn’t promise anything about you,” Potter repeated firmly. “And she’s not going to suddenly show up here either. She knows that when she sees you again, it’ll be on your terms.”
“Potter?”
The man stopped and spun around, then barked, “The what?”
Any possible words were trapped in his throat by the large lump that was lodged there so Draco gave a short nod, then turned on his heel.
Potter shook his head. “No, I wouldn’t,” he admitted. “But, well I guess you know about muggle spaceflight, right? You have to, if you knew enough to mention UV. They put so much research and engineering into being able to get to space and missions still go wrong, even though they’ve been doing it for decades. You can’t just slap some charms on a broom and expect to survive.”
Draco swallowed, feeling the tightness in his chest return as he considered his next words. “I’m still planning on leaving, you know,” he said quietly. “I still need to go. Up there.”
He shrugged again, wincing slightly. “I’ve never had any issues with the chair before. It was far better than the cot in Azkaban. And honestly, where am I supposed to keep a bed in here?” he asked rhetorically, gesturing around the cabin without turning away from the wash basin.
He blinked a few times, clearly missing something. “If you have somewhere you’d rather be, don’t put that on me. I have no issue with you being present, as should be abundantly clear by this point.”
Except. . . .
back home?” Potter retorted, before rolling his eyes. “What, are you
Then he pressed his thumb a little harder against the nipple and Potter let out a whine, releasing Draco’s neck along with a shuddering breath.
Those were the thoughts that occupied his mind during the entirety of their meal. Draco was absolutely not preoccupied with the heat of the other man's legs that were pressed up against his under the tiny table. Nor did he even notice the way that Potter was making a mess of his food and kept pausing to lick his fingers clean.
Finally he lifted his gaze to meet Draco’s and said, “Look, I’m sorry I told her. I know that you value your privacy here, and I shouldn’t have ignored that.”
Then Hermione led them to a small dimly-lit room with a glass wall that overlooked a tall empty chamber built like a lift shaft.
“I have an Arithmancy mastery and an MSc in Physics, I do research as a profession, and I have access to a secure testing facility,” she answered promptly, then gave him a pleasant smile.
“Silly me, I thought you were the confusing one.” Potter’s face contorted into a wry smile, though it looked stilted. Then he sighed again, the expression dropping into weariness.
He breathed in the soothing scent. The tin was almost empty. Maybe he’d get a different blend when it ran out.
Potter sighed and looked away, his expression stiffening. “And I’m accompanying her on the 25th. Because you won’t.”
He shrugged easily and continued to let Potter get them helplessly lost. It ultimately didn’t matter if they didn’t find their way back to the yacht until dawn; they had quite a bit of leeway in their travel time on this one, since they’d wrapped up their scheduled meetings already and only needed to ensure that they were back in Athens by the 25th.
The man sighed, his fingers resuming their path across his skin. “I just think it shows how much we’ve both changed. We went from hating each other so much that I could do this to you, to—to this. Now.”
“Potter, upstairs. Now,” he ordered, knowing that regardless of what his sober mind decided for him the next day, he’d at least have tonight with the man.
Draco shook his head. “No, those seem like rather reasonable instructions. I can’t imagine forgetting such simple rules.”
Potter huffed and grabbed the broom. “I don’t think so.” A quick spell later and there was a large red and gold bow tied around the handle.
Draco didn’t bother answering.
Draco looked over, his brow furrowed. “Millie?” he asked cautiously. Surely not.
After setting off in the direction of the clearing Potter cleared his throat and asked, “So, how did you learn that stuff anyway?” Draco raised a brow and he added, “Well, building a cabin, to start.”
They didn’t stop until several more hours later, when it was truly dark outside the attic window and Kreacher was hovering nervously, displaying the usual type of house-elf anxiety when a master wasn’t taking care of themselves properly. Draco rolled his shoulders, wincing as they popped, and followed Potter down to the kitchen, hearing himself sigh as the smells of a stew that had likely been bubbling away all day hit his nose.
She pursed her lips, and crossing her arms she replied, “I really should. What
“Sure, we can start after I’ve finished this cup,” Draco said, lifting his mug a little. “The water’s still hot if you want one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know, I think I believe him,” Draco told Vince quietly. “I think he does actually care.”
. He didn’t know how she still managed to surprise him.
“Steering and braking sensitivity?”
That evening he was just dislodging icicles from the edge of his roof when a loud crack sounded behind him, and he turned to see Potter walking up to the front door carrying the broom with the stone insert.
He knew what his dream was, and he was going to leave this world, with all of its people, behind.
He was just marking out where to set the hole that he’d insert the stand into when he heard the crack of Apparition, followed immediately by the clicking of Vince’s talons a few feet to his left.
“You know, when Hagrid first brought out the Blast-Ended Skrewts I thought they looked like shell-less lobsters.” Then he snorted. “They were horrible, weren’t they,” Potter added with a faint smile, the expression softening his features. His eyes seemed to shine in his remembrance and Draco swallowed, looking away as the full force of those words hit him.
Draco frowned in alarm. “Hermione? Wait, what?”
He gathered up the logs in his arms and brought them to his cabin in two trips, the owl a silent shadow trailing after him, finally coming to rest on the sill of the open window as he stepped inside and sank into his armchair.
He realised that Potter wasn’t the only one struggling to breathe steadily so he focused hard on the other events of the day, finally managing to find words that weren’t dangerous.
Draco shut his eyes and breathed.
“What about your job now? Do you hate this one too?”
The snow was still falling heavily when Hermione pounded on the door on Sunday morning, looking like she’d Apparated directly into snow that came up to mid-calf on his front step.
“Wait. You built this place?”
Then he looked up and met Draco’s gaze, and flushed, a hand immediately rising to mess up his hair.
“Well, Susan was with us in the D.A., but we didn’t really get to know her until she and Ron were in Auror training together. A bunch of us would do Friday pub night together, a group from the old D.A., and most of the Auror trainees. When they finished their training they ended up being partners since they knew each other so well by then. It just worked, you know?
He blinked. “The Manor isn’t mine. I live here.” When the man immediately opened his mouth, no doubt to ask intrusive questions he had no right to, he added, “And that wasn’t an invitation to talk about it.”
“When Harry mentioned you were living here I wasn’t expecting such a lovely home,” she began.
And then Potter looked
“I thought I’d prepare a trunk like we’d discussed. Evidently it didn’t go as planned.”
Draco stared at it, his mind going completely blank.
“What is the matter with you?” she demanded in a low voice. “You’re supposed to be resting!”
Something about the way that his arrival had flustered Potter made his chest clench uncomfortably. “I brought this,” he said, his voice slightly raspy. He handed over the bottle and then removed his coat.
.” Potter had a wildness about him, his hair an explosion of black around his red face, his eyes bright with a mixture of fury, frustration, and strangely, fear.
Potter met his gaze, his eyes burning defiantly. “What are we, Draco?”
Potter scooped her up in a hug and dropped a light kiss on the top of her head, before she laughed again and pushed him away. “Thanks for lunch, Harry, it’s been too long. And you two, behave,” she added with a stern look, before leaving the room.
Draco took a deep breath and looked over, taking in Potter’s disheveled appearance and visible weariness. “I think you need some proper sleep.”
They walked over to a bench not far along and sat at opposite ends, their cans between them as they faced out over the water. He took a cautious bite, and the sweetness of the lobster contrasted beautifully with the saltiness of the buttered and grilled roll, the crunch of the little bits of celery, and the creaminess of whatever else had been mixed in to hold it all together.
“Right. So you see why I need to go to his grave then.”
The rest of the morning was spent manipulating the steering and braking sensitivity of the brooms, and as Potter had brought the trunks with him as well they very carefully made some more attempts at interior Atmospheric Charms.
When he noticed how brightly Potter’s eyes were shining in the glow of that blue light he realised how closely they were sitting, ever since Draco had leaned forward away from the mast. And even though he couldn’t see his chest moving in the darkness, nor could he discern the movement of his nostrils, nor could he even hear it, he could tell that Potter was breathing rapidly.
Then, feeling productive, he embarked on a thorough cleaning of his cabin, using the remaining daylight hours to scoop away the snow that had collected against the front of the structure, organise the collection of trunks and tents, wash the dishes that had started to gather dust from a month of disuse, and air out his towels and quilt.
“This doesn’t fix the fact that we were told we’d be having the meeting when we arrived.”
“The 2001s, Potter. I ordered the 2001 model.”
Draco frowned.
“Oh good, you are here. You weren’t in your room. . . . Is that the list? Excellent.”
A strange series of sounds and vibrations later, she declared that magically expanded space should provide the protection from pressure changes that they were after, and that any further tests should be done with a trunk in mind.
He kissed Potter with a desperation he hadn’t felt in years, needing to have his lips, have his tongue, have
There was a guttural sort of sound from above him followed by a loud cry as Potter came hardly a minute later, hot come splashing over both of their chests where they were pressed together.
“Malfoy,” he replied, slumping into the loveseat. “It’s strange being here so late in the day.”
Draco knew that he wanted to, but he also felt like the more steps he took toward him, the harder it would be to extricate himself once he inevitably needed to.
He glanced over his shoulder and saw Potter hovering two feet away, eyebrows tilted in concern.
“And you can’t convince me that you’re not a cuddler too,” Potter then said cheekily, because of course he couldn’t help himself, and Draco pinched his side, rolling his eyes at the snickering that ensued.
“Yes, really,” she finally answered. “I thought it best to keep the grand reveal until now. Would you have come if I’d told you this was where I worked?”
“You think?” A heavy sigh, then, “No, don’t do that. Because if something does happen I want to know about it. Kreacher, stop him from doing anything stupid, please.”
happen.”
“At least you haven’t had to deal with Mother’s bird, right? She doesn’t seem to be sticking to the weekly guilt letter anymore.”
He felt the ghost of a hand at the small of his back and then Potter greeted his mother in an even voice. “Mrs Malfoy. Shall we get going?”
“Right,” he repeated, then he glanced past Draco and flinched at whatever he saw in Vince’s expression, but Draco didn’t turn back to look. “All right, well I should get going, then. I’ve got to talk to some of the other parents still about Teddy’s tricks. Er, I’ll be off then. Later, Malfoy.” And hardly two seconds later then man was gone.
He heard a shaky exhale. “Right. I’ll grab my bag and bring those up here.”
He could see Potter’s knuckles going white, but his voice was steady and calm as he repeated the question. “Will you consider accepting help?”
“Sorry about that. I didn’t even think to clear a path,” Draco said, chagrined.
“Fu—Draco—fuck! Holy—” Potter babbled, his hands reaching out to grip Draco’s arms, then grasp at the bedsheets, then reach blindly for him once more.
“Well, not really,” Potter admitted. “At first I did. It gave me something to focus on after the War, you know? But once he was, oh, four I think? Yeah, once he was about four Andromeda gave me a right scolding and told me to stop spoiling him and wallowing in self-pity, and to live my own life a little. After that I tried a few jobs, hated most of them, and became a godfather who visited plenty rather than a live-in one.”
“Yes, and before that? Did another family used to live here?”
Potter actually flinched and Draco felt some regret over mentioning death so casually. But the man’s tone was even when he replied, “I trust you to not deliberately do anything stupid. And Kreacher will keep an eye on things in case you manage it accidentally.”
Draco shook his hair out of his face and leaned over to gather up an armful of the split wood and proceeded to carry the pieces back to his woodpile, neatly stacking them. When he was done he walked over to his front step, taking a moment to rinse the mud from his feet under the water that was running off the roof before grabbing a towel from inside, first wiping down the axe, then beginning to dry himself off.
“You reminded Robards that he can’t give us paperwork until we’re officially back after this one?”
Spanning most of his torso, from his shoulders down to the base of his ribcage, his skin was covered in a mottled rash, with patches of angry pink interspersed with sections that were so pale they were almost white. Swallowing hard he finished dressing and carefully rose to his feet.
He shook his head. “That’s fine. If you need anything else from there, probably best that he goes to get them. Don’t—please, just don’t disappear. If you absolutely need to leave, tell me first.”
By the time he’d added a third finger Potter’s sounds were gaining a frantic edge so he rose from his position and lined up their cocks, taking a moment to rub their pre-come over them both before removing his fingers from his arse and positioning himself, sliding into him in one smooth thrust.
He immediately shook his head. “I don’t have anywhere to be other than classes, and those are done after the 18th.”
Potter shifted slightly while the hand that was holding the mobile came up to awkwardly rake through his hair. As he did so the area between them was suddenly plunged into darkness, his face no longer illuminated by the light of the small display.
“Mead?”
Draco was drinking his breakfast tea in a post-morning-blow-job-against-the-counter haze the following week when Potter asked him something, then had to repeat the words because they absolutely did not make any sort of sense the first time.
There was a clicking sound from Vince’s perch and Draco snorted, then couldn’t contain actual laughter when he saw Potter’s horrified face.
His hand was messing his hair up even further, and bits of melting ice that the drying charm had missed went spraying around the cabin. “Well what else could it be?” he demanded, his arm gesticulating wildly. “Because if you try to tell me you’re just trying to advance innovation, or some such rot, you know I won’t believe you.”
All too soon it was mid-afternoon and Hermione kicked them out of her lab, escorting them to the lift before retreating into the Department of Mysteries.
That brought some sense back into him. Potter reached into his robes, making him tense slightly, but he didn’t pull out his wand. An instant later he was brandishing a letter. Draco narrowed his eyes as he caught a glimpse of some of the writing.
“I grew up eating lobster, as I said.” There was a man out on the water in a little sailboat, swinging his hands in the air and trying to shoo away the swooping seabirds as they continued to pester him. “Lobster tail, specifically. I always thought they were large prawns.”
He spent the better part of the day outside, the fresh air helping to keep him clear-headed while he organised his thoughts. He was finding it more and more difficult to handle the letters from his mother; he’d expected it to be the opposite, that he’d become accustomed to the distance, but he wasn’t feeling so apathetic in recent weeks. It hurt.
“Shit! Sorry Malfoy, I didn’t mean to—”
He spent Wednesday and Thursday after class cleaning up the opening, trimming the jagged ends of the logs where he’d split them and sanding everything to a smooth finish.
“You said you’re going to put in a door? How will you do that? It’ll have to be magic, right, since you didn’t leave any openings when you built the rest of the place.”
Draco snorted at that.
want to reconnect with her sister. So I agreed to pass along her interest. Beyond that? It’s up to the two of them.”
She was tapping her biro against her lip, her brow furrowed. “Yes, but I think some of the missile defence systems use sensors that rely on infrared, or other inputs apart from simply a visual. We’ll need to test a few different methods of cloaking against those sensors.”
He didn’t know what to say. Her words were so different from anything he’d imagined her to say, so different from the calculated guilt-inducing letters she regularly wrote that he couldn’t respond.
“Well, maybe more than a few. Thursday or Friday pub nights. Saturday lunch. Sunday roast at the Burrow. And Tuesday game night at least once a month.”
“I could return home.”
Draco nodded. “I was thinking of heading out to the Great Mewstone off the south coast of Devon. The island is off-limits to muggles and I don’t imagine many witches or wizards will be out there this time of year, and I also won’t need to worry about the water being unbearably cold with what we’ve set up today.” He glanced over toward the rock and asked, “Does that work for you, Potter?”
Potter sighed in response, then led the way up to the upper floors, lingering in the doorway of Draco’s room while he packed his things away in the trunk that Hermione had left him.
Rather explosively.
Potter entered, looking endearingly ridiculous with the enormous snowflakes clinging to his hair. It took him a moment to find Draco in his unusual seat, despite the cabin being tiny, and stared at him for a few seconds before shaking himself. “Hey, Malfoy. I hope you don’t mind me coming by earlier today. I just figured, since you’re not in classes. . . .” He trailed off, then gave a bit of a shrug. Then he looked over toward the chair, then back at Draco.
Draco sighed, muttering Potter’s name darkly as he stepped back and allowed her to enter. After he shut the door he crossed the room to put the kettle on. “Tea?”
Potter huffed and followed him inside, removing a platter filled with eggs, bacon, and fried tomatoes, along with a few steaming rolls from his bag and setting them on the work surface.
“Granger?” he spluttered.
Draco felt himself smiling reflexively in response, then had the sharp realisation that he was fucked.
“So do I get a new minder, then? One who actually knows the product?” At this rate he would put up with McLaggen. There was no way he could possibly be as infuriatingly childish as Potter. Not at thirty years of age.
“Oh, it’s just the picture, it’s
“Not yet. I still need to add in a door and owl order some things. Finish the plumbing.” He flapped a hand idly, then pushed past Potter, coming to a stop once he caught sight of the kettle on the stove and the two waiting mugs. He turned and watched as the other man stood, giving him a narrow look.
When he was done his hair felt silky smooth and was so long it reached the small of his back. Once he saw the difference in the mirror, he had the small thought that perhaps some of his reception around the Ministry wasn’t because of his past, but because he’d looked like a madman.
“Please tell me she doesn’t have any other portraits that she can travel to. The last thing I need is for her to be visiting my mother.”
Draco clenched his jaw for a few seconds then let out a heavy exhale, unable to even maintain the pretense of cutting disdain after so long without practice. “I can’t,” he said simply, breaking eye contact and looking up at the ceiling.
“What did he do this time?” Hermione asked.
Potter shrugged, seemingly oblivious to the effect he had on Draco, and scooped up another mouthful of red-tainted food.
That weekend another heavy storm rolled in, the relentless whistling of the wind and groaning of branches causing Vince to tremble on his perch, and it didn’t let up until the early hours on Monday morning. Draco finished all of his outstanding reading during that time and sketched out a few ideas on shielding, but it wasn’t until he returned from class on Monday that he saw just how strong the winds had been. Within a hundred yards of his cabin two oaks and a hornbeam had been uprooted, and there were surely more farther out in the woods.
“You—” He still didn’t know what to say.
There was a rough sigh, then the question, “And despite that, and the fact that there’s the same danger in space, you still want to continue your work and go up there?”
“At my Ministry-mandated classes. If you have a problem with that, take it up with them.” He brushed past Potter and entered the cabin. “If you don’t mind, I need a drink before I can deal with you.” He kicked off his shoes then bent over to get a fire going in the wood stove, setting the kettle on it a moment later. Taking the single step over to his small cupboard he asked, “I suppose you’ll be wanting a cup too?”
Once they arrived he sat down at one of the rickety tables while Potter fumbled through some horrendous Greek, even though the staff clearly spoke English. But he plodded along anyway and Draco shook his head more amused than exasperated at his partner’s need to be ridiculous, even while he rubbed his hand, feeling the way that its nerve endings were still humming from that earlier touch.
Hermione was just tucking away her thermos and notebook in her bag when Draco asked what she had planned for Sunday.
There was silence for several beats, then Draco said drily, “It’s heartwarming that you care, Potter.”
Draco picked at the edge of his plate, his nail catching on a small scratch. “So you raise him?”
“Oh, right.” Rather than a Floo call he conjured a Patronus, because of course he needed to be flashy about it, and murmured to it before the bright silver creature streaked out of the room.
“Er, yeah. I guess that’s probably true.”
What he wouldn’t give to see the man’s face in that moment so that he could
They made their way back to the Atrium to return to Potter’s house in silence. Once they arrived Draco finally met Potter’s gaze for the first time in hours, biting the inside of his cheek at the concern, the worry, the hurt that was gleaming in his eyes.
with you!? If you just wanted to destroy a broom you could have bought a Cleansweep!”
When the light outside was quickly fading he finally allowed himself to sink into his chair, leaning back until it reclined, waiting for its comfortable familiarity to soothe his aching shoulders.
There was a single hoot and a clicking of talons in response, and Draco ignored him in favour of focusing on his stretches. Then, feeling much more limber he rolled up the towel and strolled back to the cabin.
He nodded. “It’s not constant anymore, but just after waking, and if I spend too long sitting without moving.”
When he left class it was overcast but dry, and he returned home to find Potter sitting on his front step, the broom with the green bow lying across his lap.
“Oh, funny,” the man replied, rolling his eyes before stepping in close and pressing a lingering kiss to Draco’s mouth.
Draco narrowed his eyes and reached into the bag, hesitating before selecting a single curl of paper-thin, salt-dusted plantain. He put it on his tongue, his mouth immediately puckering at the salt and sour—
“I didn’t ask, but where is your father buried?” Potter asked quietly.
Draco spun around and gulped at the air as quietly as he could, snatching the kettle off the wood stove and splashing scalding water on himself when he poured into the two mugs. Vince let out what might have been a squawk as Draco swore and shoved his reddening skin under the faucet, pumping cold water onto it.
“Good evening. Lovely weather we’re having. So good of you to visit,” he said flatly, needing to raise his voice slightly over the sleet.
All went well with the adapted Bubble-Head, and he set up a Sticking Charm to keep the lid shut while the charm was engaged.
It wasn’t Potter.
The man started awake, his eyes wide and bloodshot. And Draco noticed that he looked incredibly drawn, with puffy dark circles under his eyes. He was also pretty certain those were the same clothes he’d been wearing when they’d been out at the Mewstone. “Malfoy, you’re awake? You’re awake. Thank god, you’re awake.” Then he stumbled to his feet and raced out of the room.
The new addition gave Draco plenty to do throughout the rest of the week. On Tuesday he went on a long hike out to the creek and slowly brought back several large flat stones to install as the floor. The entire process took many hours, since he didn’t have any sort of wagon to assist with transporting them, and refused to use magic on principle. By the time he’d returned home it was quite dark out and he could make just make out Vince watching him through the front window, looking utterly unimpressed.
There was a loud sigh, then, “I’ll be here the week after. For sure. Just—try to enjoy Christmas, yeah?”
Draco wrapped his hands around his mug and let the steam warm his face.
He opened his eyes, squinting blearily at the bright white light, harsher than natural sunlight, colder than the warm light of a fire. The ceiling was white too, unnaturally so.
A low hoot and a ruffle of feathers was the only response.
Mess was certainly putting it lightly, as he looked around. The largest piece of wood was about the size of a sparrow, and the entire room was coated in wood fragments and dust. Two of the brass fastenings were lodged into the door of the wardrobe, one was embedded in the ceiling, and the rest were out of sight.
“Are you saying that I should just get rid of it all?”
At worst he could increase the potency of some topical sun-protection potions, though that wasn’t ideal. He was glad that he’d continued his research into the topic of radiation, however; he hadn’t realised just how powerful such a thing was, and the thought of flying through space and not being prepared for it. . . .
“He absolutely did,” Potter replied in a grim tone. “Apparently Hogwarts is boring, after all the stories he’s had his head filled with. He didn’t get to fight a troll before Christmas so he decided he didn’t feel like returning. Managed to sneak off the train before it left the station, Flooed back to Grimmauld Place, and hid upstairs before I got back home. And Kreacher’s been sneaking him meals.”
Potter didn’t lose his concerned expression in the entire time it took to return to the cabin, and once there he seemed to take a keen interest in the interior, letting his gaze roam as if he hadn’t seen it several times before.
meant she finished the last of her casting with a flick toward a dust-covered window, causing it to bang open.
“Vince? Oh, I—shit.” Potter’s tone abruptly changed to one that made him supremely uncomfortable. “Malfoy, I—”
Draco continued to stroke at the skin with his tongue, revelling in the faint fluttering of the muscle and moaning at the intensity of the scent of Potter that surrounded him. It was heady, it was rich, it was
There were a few clicks from Vince’s perch, then a long hoot. When Draco glanced over the owl he found himself subjected to a judging stare.
After that she was off and Draco was returning to his cabin with Potter at his side.
“I’m not living with you, Potter, don’t be absurd.”
works better if you’re planning on flying in bad weather.”
He gazed steadily into frustrated green eyes and allowed a hint of a smirk to show. “You forget, Potter. It is still absolutely none of your business.”
He felt Potter mumble something unintelligible against his neck and a moment later their bare torsos were pressed against each other, an intense heat crackling between them. And as Draco threw his head back when Potter found and sucked mercilessly at a particularly sensitive area he used his fingers and palms to explore the canvas of the man’s body, stroking along the edges of his pelvis, brushing through the sparse hairs on his chest, discovering the way his breath caught when he just barely grazed a hard nipple.
“Hermione said it should have been gone within hours of treatment.”
He gave a curt nod and stalked around to the front of the cabin to retreat inside, gathering up his mass of partially-frozen hair and tying it up, then getting to work with a towel. He’d just dropped a towel onto his chair and slumped into it when Potter entered, dried himself off with a charm, then put the kettle on like he owned the place.
A few spells later and the trunk promptly clattered apart into a pile of wooden slats so they decided to call it a day.
He shrugged. “Probably still asleep. We got in rather late.”
have access to private and extensive facilities that would be useful for their testing.
“I can leave—”
“Ah, there’s another one,” she said, beaming. “Listen, you don’t need to worry about Ron. He still flies off the handle from time to time, but he’s managed to accept several of your old house mates, and it
He reached out and grabbed one of those hands, sucking in a silent breath when it gripped his fiercely. The mobile fell out of its hold and landed facing upward, where Draco could see in its tiny square display that the primary image there was of them both, appearing lazy and sated on an afternoon that he remembered spending at an olive grove somewhere in Italy. They’d practically gorged themselves on fresh bread and even fresher olive oil, not to mention the bottle of wine shared between them, and had fallen asleep there on the proprietors’ porch before they’d been found and gently asked to leave.
Holding onto the patience that he’d learned as a necessity, Draco replied, “No, this doesn’t expand. I’ll be working in one of the clearings.”
After they looked at each other quietly for a few minutes, neither of them moving, Potter said slowly, “I noticed some bottles out in the cabin?”
“So, as I was saying,” Draco said while he turned to look out the window, “Hermione came by yesterday.”
“Don’t tell me you’re planning on going to space and never coming back,” Potter whispered.
Frequently Draco would be working on his research and Potter would approach from behind and release his hair from its hold, and the next thing he knew they would both be in a sweaty heap on the drawing room floor. Or the kitchen floor. Or the hallway floor.
“The orange ones?” he asked softly.
Draco took a few seconds think over her words before making his way back down to the kitchen, taking a seat across from Potter.
Meanwhile, Potter chewed on his lip, avoiding his gaze. “What if we just keep travelling the world? No pointless bureaucracy. No Robards. No boring patrol shifts where we have to stand at the busiest corner of Diagon Alley giving bloody directions. Just . . . what we’ve been doing. I mean, you don’t have to. Maybe that’s what I’ll do though.”
Then he continued lower, hands firm against Potter’s sides, then his thighs, sweeping along the damp skin while his tongue followed, the salty taste of sweat filling his mouth while the scent of the man surrounded him.
He retreated to his room to gather up the books and papers he’d need and returned to the attic, not wanting to be wandering about the house once the rest of Potter’s friends arrived lest they notice him.
“And I swear that you were only half-taught how to speak English,” Draco returned, feeling the corner of his mouth twitching.
Three more months of listening to Fry rabbit on about contraptions, laws, famous figures, customs, words, hopping from one to the next without any recognisable lesson structure, or common thread beyond the obvious.
“I didn’t—” He heard a huff, then blessed silence until the kettle started to whistle. A few minutes after that the tea had steeped and he was holding his mug in front of his face, letting the scented steam seep into his skin.
Draco cleared his throat, and Potter’s eyes flew up to meet his.
Draco did stand there and watch for a few minutes, his eyes following the man’s movements as he stretched up to the highest branches, the back of his jumper riding up to reveal a strip of bare skin, before bending down to place an ornament in its box, the fabric of his trousers pulling tight across his arse as he did so.
He was languidly sprawled on the loveseat some time later, trying it out while he enjoyed his morning tea when a crack sounded outside and was shortly followed by a knock at his door.
“Fine.” A sigh, then, “I will figure it out, you know.”
Even tied back in a knot, his hair was wild. And he’d known that, in a disconnected sort of way, but seeing how it clumped together like an animal’s matted fur was a different sort of understanding. It was also no longer the uniform platinum that it once had been, instead looking more muted, some sections more golden, others dulled like dishwater, and he had some strands of silver in a few spots.
“Yeah, that’s not a problem. Tomorrow, then? Or even today, if you want to head over now?”
On Monday Draco rose early out of habit and after a quick breakfast he set to work cleaning off a few of the extra planks of wood that he still had left from his roof extension and set to work fastening them into a door, which he was able to install by that evening.
Hermione sighed and thanked Kreacher. Then she withdrew her wand and snapped, “Oh, at least let me heal that properly.”
“Morning,” Potter said softly, sounding almost hesitant.
“I remember this house being horrible, but I don’t recall body parts,” he said slowly.
There was certainly a hesitation, but then she seemed to gather her resolve and replied, “Yes, of course. The gates have been opened for us, so I shall meet you there.” After a long look at Draco she closed the door.
Suddenly, Hermione’s cross voice filled the room and Draco started, though Potter tightened his grip on his hand when he instinctively pulled away.
Then again, even before things had come to a head in October, everything had been so surprisingly easy. Ever since they’d left on that first stop of their assignment, things had just . . . worked.
staying in the collection,” Potter said through wheezes, holding the device away from him when he reached for it.
He remained in his spot on the landing as the two men climbed the stairs, Potter’s arm brushing against his as he passed and Weasley pinning him with a look of suspicion. Once they were behind the closed door of the drawing room he finally followed Hermione down to the ground floor.
Interesting.
Draco could feel his tension pulling at his shoulders, causing the dull ache to throb. “I should go,” he said quietly.
Finally he lowered himself to the bed again, resting his head on Potter’s shoulder while his hand splayed across his chest, his fingers playing with the damp hair there.
Draco nodded.
Swing.
“Twice. It happened twice, Harry.”
Shrugging, he gathered his notes and made his way downstairs, eventually finding him in the drawing room.
“Assault?” He quirked an eyebrow.
Soon it was the first week of February and a familiar screech startled him awake early one morning.
“Draco. . . .” He felt Potter lift his chin then drop his forehead to Draco’s shoulder, his breaths unsteady, fingers digging into the cloth of his shirt.
Once his wrist cooled he gingerly touched at the red spots, hissing in pain as the contact stung. “I’m such a mess,” he muttered, giving Vince an apologetic look for having caused him distress.
risks.”
The next morning Potter arrived holding two brooms and Draco promptly Apparated them to Great Mewstone, where they appeared standing on rocky hillside with sparse clumps of grass. There was a strong wind whipping the rain against them, the sky was a dismal grey, and twenty or so feet again the hill abruptly dropped into a steep rocky shore, where the ocean’s waves were loudly crashing.
. And I’m not going anywhere, Draco Malfoy.”
one’s apparently going to sit there until I write my mother, though, so perhaps that’s what you heard.”
“How much time do you expect this experiment to take? I could probably spare three evenings a week, at most.”
Vince clicked his beak irritably.
“Just shy of 1800 degrees. I think that’s as far as we’ll get with charms, unless one of us invents a new one that’s more powerful than anything else currently in use.”
His only response was a slow blink.
Then he slid his hands under the man’s thighs and lifted them, spreading them wider and licking lower, before swiping his tongue firmly over the circle of puckered skin hidden there.
“What type of experiments?”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to stay out.”
behind him and some clinking in the wash basin.
“No, that’s all right. Makes sense.”
Draco snorted. “You’re forgetting the other point. That person would need to actually have an interest in helping me stay alive. That’s rather a short list. At this point I’m fairly certain that list only includes you and my mother, and I’ve got her ensconced away in a townhouse in Bristol. She’s not coming anywhere near here, and she knows absolutely nothing that could help with this project.”
Hermione looked between Draco and Weasley and huffed loudly, rolling her eyes. “Well, honestly. It was bound to happen sooner or later. Draco, Ron, it’s been so long, lovely to see you too, now you both try it.”
Draco nodded; he’d noticed the same when the front step had failed to accumulate any snow, slush, or frost over the past week.
“Excellent. Well then I think that’s the next step, as I don’t see the point in testing the shielding in conjunction with your other custom spellwork if we haven’t reached the needed temperature thresholds yet.”
“Ron! You’re back!” he heard the man exclaim from out of sight. Then there was a beat of silence as he apparently didn’t know how to deal with the situation.
“Not that I mind the visit, but I’d have thought you’d be busy with family things on Boxing Day.”
“She wanted to be reintroduced to Andromeda. Apparently, she hasn’t reached out in all this time because it
Potter slumped back against the sofa and tilted his head to face Draco, meeting his gaze. “I didn’t make any promises, but she was almost as difficult to stand up to as Hermione. She really misses you, Malfoy. She—well, she did a good job of hiding it, but there were a few moments where she seemed to be a breath away from sobbing. She
“There isn’t anything for me here,” he whispered. “Or there wasn’t. Now, I have this faint thought that there might be, but you confuse me so much that I can’t possibly count on that tiny chance. Our whole community—it has nothing left for me, and I don’t want anything from it. I just want to live to see the next day, and if I can do that alone, then that’s probably the best thing I can hope for. I can be alone in space.”
Potter had immediately crouched to collect the mugs, one of which had cracked in two, and Draco could only stand there staring at the man who was kneeling in front of him with his head right in line with his cock. He could feel blood rushing southward, and when Potter glanced up from his position on his knees, eyes bright, cheeks flushed, he considered that part of him that was no longer buried, the part of him that was actively urging him onward, and thought,
“But—you’re going to knock out the wall?” Potter asked, aghast.
He spent much of the rest of the day in excellent spirits, despite the fact that without access to his brooms he didn’t have much to occupy his time. But still, he went out on a long walk through the woods, collecting some more fruit when he happened by a hawthorn, occasionally breaking out into a wide smile. That evening large clumps of fluffy snow started to fall and he found himself looking out the window, watching and appreciating the simple beauty of the season.
“Sure, no problem. I’ll be back up in a few, just going to put away the extras.” There were the sounds of Potter clomping down the stairs, then quiet.
had been working.
“The piece of wood outside seems to have kept the enchantments.”
Draco frowned and opened his eyes, tilting his chin to look down at the hand. “Potter?”
it doesn’t mean that we need to bow to your every whim, Malfoy.”
“Right. Let’s head out, then.”
Potter sighed, lifted his hand toward Draco and then dropped it, worrying his lip. “See you there, then.” A moment later he Disapparated.
She definitely hesitated, since there was a weighty silence that seemed to stretch on for long seconds, but she responded in a bright voice that all was in order and that she would see him the next day. A moment later the door opened and shut, the attic returning to silence.
He gave a slight hum, then shook his head. “I was just curious about this. It’s not bad.”
There was a warm hand on his shoulder, almost tentative in its touch. “I didn’t tell him about the details of the space project, since that’s yours to share, but he knows that I’ve been meeting up with you since the autumn. And he’s fine with it.”
“When am I not?”
Draco smirked and didn’t respond.
Draco frowned, his eyes trained on the flowers. There wasn’t a crimson rose in sight, nor any other flowers of mourning. There were splashes of pink gladiolus for remembrance, purple columbine blooms for resolve, and some other flower he couldn’t place.
this?”
Vince shifted on his perch and opened his beak for a moment, but the rain was hammering too loudly on the roof to hear the clicking of his talons nor the sound of his hoot.
The elf drew himself up tall and proudly declared, “Kreacher has served the noble house of Black for over six hundred years.”
“—check who’s here, I’ll be right back!” he heard Potter announce before he was clomping down the stairs, coming to a dead halt when he saw Draco standing there gripping the bottle tightly.
Draco nodded and lowered his gaze to focus on his food. An orphan of the War. He should have known better than to ask.
“And how exactly does that explain you showing up here?” Draco asked patiently.
“No,” Potter interrupted quietly, and his eyes blazed. “That is such bullshit and you know it.” He took a step closer.
“Malfoy. I didn’t hear from you to say this week was bad, so I figured I’d stop by and see how you were doing.”
There was a gasping sound from somewhere above him and the fingers in his hair tightened slightly as he swiped his tongue along the length of his cock, before taking as much of it as he could in his mouth.
The kettle started to whistle, and Potter actually jumped back.
“I should go,” Potter said quietly, giving his knuckles a soft squeeze before releasing his hand again. “Thursday morning, you said?”
Draco only had a broad understanding of what the Internet was from his classes, since he had no electricity here in the woods and didn’t feel the need to own a computer, but he felt a bit more at ease now that Granger had acknowledged her interest in the subject for the subject’s sake. Because that at least felt like something he could wrap his head around.
“What,” he said flatly. “It’s not like I’d expected that. And I certainly didn’t plan for it.”
Draco trudged off toward the bathroom for a shower and when he emerged some time later, combing out the knots in his hair, Potter stepped into the hallway and nearly walked into him.
That weekend he awoke to find the season’s first frost on the ground, and spent both days on long treks around the woods collecting all of the fallen branches, making a large pile of them next to his cabin. On Monday after class he collected several large sacks of fallen leaves to store for kindling, and since Tuesday brought a heavy downpour he put off the remainder of that task, opting instead to make a dent in the branches.
He nodded. “Clear sky, though. I haven’t heard back from the shops so we’ll be working on the brooms today.”
“Just press it again. Imagine it lights up with the words Potter Stinks,” he added with a faint smirk.
“You’ve been busy,” Potter said in greeting.
The words were quiet, but they reverberated in Draco’s mind, and he considered them. He thought about his interactions with Potter since he’d first come to the cabin that autumn, angrily brandishing Draco’s letter. He thought about the questions, the demands, the outbursts, and how they had transformed into confusion, and flustered awkwardness, and kindness. That transformation had occurred in such a short amount of time that he couldn’t believe it would last. It would be foolish of him to believe such a thing.
Even though he had surely heard the Apparition, he still did a double-take upon seeing Draco standing there, then demanded, “Where have you been? I’ve been waiting for almost an hour!”
Vince shifted a bit on his perch, his talons clicking gently.
“Malfoy?”
Draco shook his head, a wry smile hinting at the edge of his mouth, and brushed past him to step inside. “Come on in, you idiot, before you hurt yourself.”
He just raised an eyebrow, ignoring the stalling.
He rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter. Step inside and shut the door, if you don’t mind?”
that Robards just set the meeting and didn’t actually ask them for input on the date.”
“Holy fuck Malfoy!”
Draco ran a finger along his length, then slid this thumb along his slit, a full-body shudder running through him as he promptly gave a few firmer strokes, feeling himself hardening further.
They ate in silence, and Draco surprised himself by accepting a second helping after he tasted how hearty it was, and realising that he hadn’t eaten since far too early in the morning. He was just letting his eyes slide shut in contentment after his final mouthful when he heard Potter push his chair back from the table and stand.
Potter looked utterly bewildered. “Why would we give you that?”
“The vacuum of space,” Draco replied, nonplussed.
“I’ll talk to Elliott and make sure. Any other
“That’s not good enough, and you didn’t answer the question.
Once the tremors in his frame subsided he finally released Draco’s hair, pulled back from the kiss, and with a gleam in his eye muttered something that he didn’t quite catch.
On Wednesday he dug up the earth in the space where he would be building and busied himself with setting the stones. The rest of the week and into the weekend he carefully measured and cut logs for the walls, and planed planks of wood for the roof.
The elf popped out, and Draco looked down at his hands as he felt the bed dip slightly next to him.
Draco watched his friend’s retreating form, his irritation dissipating into nothing more than a dim ember. “Fine,” he said, his voice devoid of inflection. “You might as well leave now then, before you waste more of both of our time.”
“It was an honest mistake,” Draco replied lowly, hating the fact that he’d been so foolish but needing her to know that it hadn’t been intentional, though he couldn’t see why anyone would intentionally do such a thing.
“You know that’s how they immediately know we’re foreign, right?” Draco said once his could control his face. He went to take a bite of his eggs then had to set his fork down, wincing as the hot sauce residue in the air made contact with his
Given the gently snoring Potter in the chair next to the bed, he figured he had a good idea of the how.
“Well, nice of you to turn up,” Draco commented, standing and feeling his joints pop. With a groan he started on some stretches, wincing at the first few.
Draco swallowed and looked out of the window. “Testing is finished.”
“Oh, he
They continued to walk in silence and had nearly arrived at the clearing when Potter asked quietly, “Is that why you don’t wear shoes? So that you can . . . feel the woods?”
So instead he worked on making the charm activate for any rider once they made contact with the broom, and tested it with himself and with Vince.
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Potter said quietly, then stepped in close for a warm kiss before stepping back again, hesitating a moment before dropping his hands.
“Well, you got your photo of this moment, then,” he said. “Now will you put that bloody thing away so that we can
“Well, it’s not my fault you decided to stay out there. You know that you’re not a duck.”
Ah. Yes. Right.
Draco’s mouth opened to retort that of
. I think that you should refuse to go and tighten the wards on the house.”
Potter hadn’t looked away but his gaze shifted to one of intensity. “Don’t you dare. Ron, let’s go look for Norbert.”
On Saturday Potter needled him from the moment they awoke but Draco refused give in, so shortly before eleven o’clock he retreated to the attic so that any lunch guests could remain oblivious to his presence in the house.
“Have you adjusted any of the anti-tampering on this one yet?”
He swallowed and nodded, rinsing the soapy water from his plate and setting it in the rack.
A moan tore through him, the sound starting somewhere in his chest and travelling roughly along his throat. Potter’s hand still had a firm grip on his hair, holding his head back, while his other hand was on his arse grinding their hips together.
“Heat protection next? Did you figure that one out?”
Potter scowled. “Probably not. Malfoy, that model is over fifteen years old. No one’s going to know the specs for it to the level of detail that you want unless they’re a senior designer, and they’re busy enough as it is right now. Doing their actual jobs.”
He blinked a few times, waiting for a sudden realisation that didn’t come.
Then Vince shuffled slightly on the window sill, his talons clicking softly.
“No, I’m not telling you how you should remember your past. I’m simply saying that I personally cannot relate.” Then he frowned as he cast his gaze over the stacks of refuse again. “Then again, I can’t imagine you have a reasonable excuse for retaining this quantity of taxidermy.”
“Yeah, I don’t think she’ll make it a week either. Maybe she’ll go for guilt this time. Haven’t had one of those in a while.”
, but Draco couldn’t think about any of the things that were threatening to crush his post-Azkaban reality so he continued to lick and suck, feeling the pressure of his own arousal as he slid his tongue past the tight ring of muscle, prompting another yell from the man he was defiling.
Vince made a clicking sound with his beak.
Draco blinked. “Pardon?”
A moan tore through him as he rocked up against the man above him, the friction wonderful and agonising at the same time. As Potter’s lips finally released his own to lick and bite along his neck he murmured, “Off,” tugging at his shirt.
Draco lay there for several minutes, breathing harshly, feeling the unsteady rise and fall of Potter’s chest beneath him. When he felt able to move he dipped his head toward the wetness on his abdomen and dropped an open-mouthed kiss there, tasting him, then rose to his mouth and did the same, feeling something in his chest clench hard when it prompted a moan from the man.
She smiled widely at him.
Potter snorted and looked up at him, his expression shifting from one of anxiety to one more open and hopeful while his hand that wasn’t clutching the apple slipped into a pocket.
The following day Draco was aware of some speculative looks being directed at him by Hermione but he blithely ignored them and focused on their work.
“Yeah,” he agreed, wetting his lips. “It’s hard to believe we’ve been gone this long. Over half a year, at this point.”
“I look past your history.”
A few minutes later Potter managed to haul himself upright again and reached for his glass, taking several long sips before turning to meet Draco’s gaze. His eyes were full of pain, and Draco had to look down toward his drink.
“What do you think, will today be the day?” He let his head rest back against the cushion, his eyes sliding shut of their own accord. “It’s been six days since the last letter.”
from Draco’s cabin and made some adjustments to the parameters of her testing console, then sent the trunk down to the chamber.
“She said that she wanted you to be here on Thursday mornings so that the three of us can work on things together.”
Draco wasn’t even tempted to rise to the bait. He blew across the surface of his tea calmly.
Draco began by flying a few laps around the clearing, one fast around the bends, the others slower, then he tried a few turns, testing the reaction times, the amount of pull, then the brakes. He was vaguely aware of Potter watching him with a frown, and imagined he looked like he had no clue what he was doing, with the types of manoeuvres he was doing on a broom that was meant to go fast and offer a smooth ride, but he didn’t care. It would be important to determine how much the broom relied on air resistance and gravity, and he could learn just as much testing that practically as he could by dismantling the spellwork.
The exchange went smoothly, and Draco considered then nodded. “I think this one’s stronger between the two,” he said, shaking the broom with the stone in the handle. “Agreed?”
“I don’t handle close calls well,” the man continued, looking down, his hands still shaking. “Especially not with people I care about.”
There was the sound of a snort, then Potter finally turned to face him, his expression one of amusement. “Yeah, yeah. I should have seen this, the two of you teaming up against me.”
Draco’s eyebrows shot up, he was so surprised by the insight from someone so utterly unexpected. “Very good, Potter,” he said slowly, giving him an appraising look.
“I’ll wait here for you, Mother,” he said quietly, bracing himself for some argument, a cutting remark, a passive aggressive comment, but she simply nodded and strode forward regally, her head held high.
“As much as I’d like to continue this,” he said, his voice sounding hoarse, “I think that we should both get some actual rest before Hermione arrives. And maybe we can revisit this once you’re not sleep-deprived and distraught.”
Then he was introduced to Eddie, a tiny thing with a mop of strawberry blond curls, a round face, and dimples, who immediately held up a stuffed dragon and shrieked, “No-but!”
had failed, then had he almost drowned?
The moment stretched on uncomfortably for far too long until finally Potter caved, and Draco felt some satisfaction. “Right then. They also gave me a list of ways that new charms will definitely go wrong if certain new ones are added—anti-tampering measures. So depending on that we may need to remove some of the enchantments before you go adding some of your own.”
“Good morning,” he replied simply.
“Testing season started up again today. So I can’t come by in the mornings anymore, at least not for our usual Thursday, and—well, I wanted to see you.”
“It’s wood, Potter, it isn’t fucking diamond-encrusted gold. You can calm down.”
“Listen,” she hissed once they were near the door, her anger making her appear to tower over him despite her short stature. “I barely know you, really, but you seem to have changed for the better, and Harry seems to think you’re worth helping. But if you pull something like this again I’m not going to help you anymore, and you’d better believe that I’ll drag Harry out of your mess kicking and screaming if I have to. He’s been hurt more than anyone should need to in their lifetime and I won’t see that happen to him again. Do you understand me?”
Swing.
“Teddy’s coming home for the Easter hols,” Potter said carefully, and Draco was momentarily thrown by the non sequitur. “His birthday is a few weeks later than that this year but we’ll be celebrating it then. I know that I can’t ask you to not go to space, but . . . I’d like for you to meet Teddy and Andromeda. At least once, before you go.”
, I need to know what enchantments are
“Agreed. I’ve also prepped that one for Sticking Charms, and further . . . assault.” The man reddened slightly as he averted his gaze, then stalked back toward the rock.
Potter had a mulish expression and wasn’t letting go, but based on strength alone Draco knew he could wrestle the broom free. He had the calluses on his palms and the build of nine months of putting his body to work daily. Potter apparently worked behind a desk. Knowing that the idiot was too stubborn to let up he abruptly gave the broom a sharp jerk and stalked out to the centre of the clearing with it, prying about half of the bristles free of the fastening, then took off again.
“So the entire reason is because Potter wants you to help me.”
The door opened less than a minute later and his mother stood there, wearing robes of pale lilac, her hair done up in braids coiled around her head, tears shimmering in her eyes. “Draco?” she asked, a slight trembling audible in her voice.
on their own. Er, as far as temperatures, they’re confirmed protected to 800 degrees.”
“Joints still bothering you?” Potter asked, before dropping onto the sofa next to Draco.
He noticed as soon as he entered the attic that something was different, though it wasn’t until he’d adjusted the flames beneath each cauldron that he realised why. There were the scrapes of heavy furniture being moved, the mumbles of Potter talking to himself, and as Draco watched he realised that the stacks of junk were definitely smaller than they had been a few days earlier.
He lifted his mug toward her and quirked a brow, then said in a sarcastic tone, “That’s Slytherin for you.”
She gave him an amused smile, as if he’d said something particularly funny. “Oh, I’m not going anywhere now that you’ve brought me into this! Now, I’m free on Thursday mornings and most Sundays. If you can get Harry to agree to meet on Thursdays then I can be here for that and help out with testing enchantments, and Sundays would be best for any tests that need a secure facility. How does that sound?”
So instead he rose, grabbed one of his towels, and set off toward the clearing, grumbling to himself because Vince wasn’t there to complain to.
Finally he followed, though slowly, not wanting to catch up to her since he didn’t know how to face those words and the conviction in her voice when she’d spoken them. When she arrived at the front gates he watched as she shared a few words with Potter, sweeping him up in her arms and holding him for a few seconds before stepping back and Disapparating. When Draco arrived at the gates he saw Potter look toward him with the full weight of his concerned expression and felt his shaky hold on his resolve begin to crumble.
Based on the clock on the mantle and the darkness outside the large windows, it was just past two o’clock in the morning.
Finally Potter managed to find his words. “We’ll need a bigger space if you’re doing anything to the brooms today. Unless you just wanted to check them over today, and then get to work another day?” A pause, then, “Or does this room expand?”
Draco let out a sigh and scratched at his beard. He hadn’t realised the dangers of simply being present in the vacuum of space, beyond the fact that there wouldn’t be air. “I see,” he said, wondering if there were any other gaping holes in his plan that could lead to a spectacular failure.
Potter was right there, and was smiling at him, and the warmth from the broom was making the enormous snowflakes melt into nothingness as they drifted into his hair. And the heat in the air was climbing into Draco’s cheeks, and he couldn’t
The words shot straight to his groin and Draco swallowed, feeling the heat of his own flush rising on his neck. “I can think of a few ways,” he said slowly, the words coming out lower and huskier than he’d intended.
garden, Draco. Cactus!”
Potter cleared his throat again, then fumbled awkwardly at his pockets and withdrew a wad of folded up papers. After rifling through them for half a minute he said, “So, they’re functionally immune to natural fire. They can also withstand the fire of an
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Aren’t you supposed to be here supervising me to make sure I don’t try to kill myself?”
Draco took some rough visual measurements of the trees and slowly walked around his cabin, looking at the walls, and thinking.
Potter left the room at that point and Draco continued to sit quietly, until Hermione dragged him into a conversation about the drink that he’d brought which prompted many sounds of surprise as he explained the process of tapping the birch trees in his forest, and the various uses of the sap that he collected.
Then Draco finished dealing with Potter’s overabundance of clothing and released his erection, dropping to his knees without warning and pressing his face against the hot flesh, inhaling a deep breath of the man’s musky scent.
He raised his head and looked across at where Potter was sprawled across his bed, topless. Shameless.
. His hands scrabbled at the clasps of his cloak, releasing it and fumbling with his robes, letting out a groan of frustration when he found yet
Potter frowned, and wouldn’t quite meet his gaze. “I dunno. But, er, just in case you do, the offer’s there.”
“An overemotional idiot, yes. Mind you, I was the same, in a completely different way. But these days he almost reminds me of how Longbottom was.” He cast his eyes upward as he thought about that, then added, “Well, without the fear.”
After a brief hesitation he turned his back to make his way to the entrance hall so that he could Apparate out. Once he was back at his cabin he flinched at the look of contempt that Vince turned his way.
“I want a broom that I’m familiar with. I can sacrifice a bit of speed, and whatever other bells and whistles have been added, for the sake of a broom that I know.”
Draco smoothed the indent as best as he could with the sharp edge of his blade, then sheathed it and added a few layers of charmwork. After a brief hesitation he sat on the broom, then pressed his thumb into the indent.
Draco took in the tension in his neck, the almost feverish brightness in his eyes, the grim set of his mouth, and bit his lip, thinking over their few options. Then he caught the way Potter’s gaze dropped down, lured by the movement of his mouth, then the slight flush that rose on his cheeks when he found himself caught. Draco cleared his throat and said, “We’ll both go.”
Draco took his time finishing the rest of the roll, considering. This was their fifteenth stop and they had countless more remaining. And honestly, who was Potter going to tell at this point? The man had hardly any life outside of this ridiculous assignment that Draco
Feeling like he himself was a kettle about to boil Draco ended the moment, breaking eye contact and suddenly standing to bring his glass to the wash basin with a slight tremor in his hand. He may have set it down hard; it was difficult to tell, with his senses alight and every sound magnified. He took a ragged breath, hoping he wasn’t making a fool of himself.
“I understand,” Potter said quietly. “You have an open invitation though, so if you ever choose to, you’re welcome.”
“So you told your friend about my project, and you told her where I live, because you didn’t want to have a guilty conscience later on?” Draco knew he was being difficult, but at the same time he wanted to make sure he completely understood. He didn’t want any more surprises.
“Will you want an indoor perch this year?”
Potter was the one to look away. “I was so fucking scared,” he whispered.
Their testing generated some results that they could work with, as one of the infusions when paired with the heat protections they’d previously attempted was effective up to nearly three thousand degrees, a temperature so high it seemed utterly ridiculous. Under the supervision of Hermione they then proceeded to apply the rest of the adjustments that they’d established to date and when that didn’t have any adverse effects on the efficacy of the heat protection they concluded that portion of the enchantments complete.
“Those weren’t lobsters. I’ve eaten lobster my whole life, I know what they look like.”
Draco could feel his brain melting and trickling out of his ears, joining the sweat that already covered him.
Draco shut his eyes, focusing on the tremors that were still running through his body, not letting himself think about anything else. A few minutes later he could sense a shifting on the bed next to him, then a hot arm was draped across his chest while the hard edge of a jaw pressed against his shoulder.
“You keep saying that.”
Potter nodded and stood, stepping a few paces away.
He grunted softly in annoyance, his smile immediately vanishing as he straightened and looked up where of course Potter was standing a few yards away, quickly becoming drenched, staring at him.
A bright flash of lightning streaked across the sky, followed by a rumble of thunder a few seconds later.
He snorted. “Don’t give me that. As amusing as Potter must have been to you, I know that you don’t like him.”
“Then they started throwing around accusations about illegal potions use, dark curses, awful things like that because of your identity, so I contacted Hermione because I couldn’t think of anything else that didn’t involve throwing an epic tantrum.”
He found himself smiling wider as the arm drifted down his torso, a hand shortly enveloping his cock and slowly stroking it, while the body at his back lazily thrust against him. He reached a hand behind him to run along the hip and thigh that he could reach before bringing it back around to his front, joining the hand that was wrapped around him, linking their fingers together as they moved.
Draco remained for several seconds, taking slow, steadying breaths, before turning on his heel and Apparating to the front step of the townhouse in Bristol. Immediately Potter’s concerned gaze was on him, but he didn’t say anything and only waited for Draco to rap on the door with the polished pewter knocker.
“You can’t just go diving sixty metres underwater and then surface as if pressure doesn’t matter! The body can’t handle abrupt shifts in pressure! We discussed this! You read about it! I know you did!”
Vince blinked slowly, almost petulantly.
“Well, just because you
“No. Make your own chair if you need to sit.”
Potter frowned “Oh. I mean, I meant it when I asked you to stay. I didn’t mean just for, you know, this. I meant stay.”
Once his body was a bit more under control he put the rest of the food away, guessing that it would likely keep him fed for the full week that the charms would last. Then he cleaned up, Vanished the table, and sank onto his chair.
Finally, the man groaned. “All right. You can have your brooms on one condition. Any experiments need to be done under the supervision of Nimbus personnel in case there’s any sort of inquiry later on.”
Draco nodded.
Potter huffed, then shook his head and focused on his tea for the next twenty minutes.
“Draco please—
“Pardon me?”
He suddenly felt stuck, unable to so much as slide forward or back on the broom.
Since there was still no sign of Potter he helped himself to the pantry and soon had the kettle on, and was toasting thick slices of bread above the fire. At nine o’clock sharp there was a loud crack from the front entrance above followed by the sound of brisk footsteps descending the narrow staircase.
“I almost want to report in that you’re planning something illicit with the brooms, so that you have your rights to purchase and use them revoked,” Potter said quietly, not looking up.
Despite them arriving via the Atrium he wasn’t escorted over to the security desk for his wand to be registered. When they were halfway to the lifts he noticed that Hermione was handing him a small visitor’s badge, which he affixed to the outside of his coat.
“I’ll grant you that after a month of making use of a decent bed I am considering purchasing one for myself. I just haven’t had the opportunity yet,” he admitted, mentally reasoning with himself that the words were mostly truthful. Sort of.
Potter was worrying his lip and his face was set in a deep frown. “You need to take care of yourself, Draco.”
And then he made the mistake of looking up, and the man’s eyes awoke every nerve in his body, the heat of his desire burning in his veins. He dropped the coat on the floor, and Potter took another step forward, then another, reaching out to pull Draco close.
“It sounds like you still managed to inspire him, if he’s just as troublesome as you used to be.”
Draco nodded mutely. The dishes, or maybe even the bag, must have been charmed because the smells of the foods were quickly filling the cabin, and he could see steam rising from several of the platters.
Someone, likely Potter, must have gone to the cabin while he’d been unconscious since the clothing that was on the small table belonged to him, but weren’t what he’d been wearing when they were out in the sea. He was just about to pull on a shirt when he caught sight of his chest, and let out a gasp of shock.
He nodded mutely and held a hand out for the bottle, then poured himself one measure, then a second after a moment’s pause. He then scooted back on the bow so that he could lean back against the mast, feeling the burning heat on his leg where Potter’s hand had touched it.
“We could . . . try golf?”
A minute later, once Draco’s face looked much more intact, he asked drily, “I suppose you’ll be taking my trunks away now too?”
Draco looked at her mulishly and didn’t answer, knowing that she was right, but also that as an Unspeakable she probably
“Just don’t—if you decide to go before then, please don’t leave without saying goodbye.
“We can probably test them out tomorrow. We can try an overnight infusion on a few brooms that haven’t been enchanted yet?”
“I’m noting that down as a yes, with Mr Potter listed as the responsible party. Well then, you are free to go.” And with that she swept out of the room.
Draco stood there, unable to move for several minutes.
—Malfoy what are you planning!?” Potter squawked.
“Yes. I just managed to burn myself a little, nothing to worry about.”
He then wondered if it had been partially intentional, as it meant that Draco would need to return to the house for more brewing.
“I’ll need to think about the matter of heat, then. What about the other items you were unsure about last week? Will you be able to handle reversing the anti-tampering enchantments for the specific items I’d mentioned?”
“This isn’t single-malt Scotch, Draco,” Potter said. He looked over and saw the man holding the glass up to eye level, looking at it critically.
Slowly, carefully, he withdrew himself and then lowered himself onto his back, sprawling next to him.
“Oh, sorry if I woke you, Malfoy. I was just coming by to see if you were awake for dinner.”
to be noticed by Potter—it woke up and took interest in the tension of the moment. And it whispered to Draco, hungrily, demanding that he do something to
Draco didn’t really understand what was coming over him, but it was all too much. He felt as his fingers pressed too hard into Potter’s back, and there was a rumbling against his chest as Potter murmured those same words again and again into his ear. If he could take a step back from everything he might have felt mortified at his reaction to the sex they’d just had, but he couldn’t even sort out that much. It was too much.
“Teddy Lupin. Tonks and Remus’s son. He just started at Hogwarts this year.”
, and
Draco and Hermione went through their list and soon the branch was in the chamber being blasted with flames that began red, but soon shifted to a bright orange, then yellow. Just as the flames were starting to turn white a symbol started flashing on the console and Hermione flipped the switch.
And he was overwhelmed by everything that he was afraid to think and feel when the beautiful man rode him, moaning relentlessly, head thrown back, the light of the full moon illuminating their movements on the bed as he sank repeatedly onto Draco until they were both finally nudged over the edge into the abyss, climaxes tearing through them, reducing them both to a shuddering heap of limbs.
The eagle owl gave him an absolutely filthy look before launching into the air, and Vince let out a low, plaintive hoot.
“Hey.” He looked up, and Potter was looking at him with his concerned intensity. “It’s fine. I mean, it’s not, it’s really fucking sad, but it’s fine. That’s all in the past, and now he’s just a kid who has a huge family, even if most of us aren’t related by blood. He knows he’s loved.”
Potter glanced over at him then just as quickly looked away, appearing to be staring intently at the fire. He cleared his throat, then said, “Er, yeah. I’ve got the notes on the, er, heat stuff. And the spells.”
“Department of Mysteries,” announced the lift’s female voice when they stopped at the next floor. The doors opened and Hermione stepped out, looking at him expectantly.
“Oh, I guess that’s all of them then, thanks. Actually, do you want the tree? You could probably use it for firewood?”
“And you’re also wearing boots.”
Draco allowed his head to thunk back against the wall and let out a long breath. “No. She acts as though nothing has changed, as though the War never happened, as though my father dying in Azkaban was some tragedy, or noble sacrifice. I can’t talk to her.”
“Listen, Malfoy,” he began, and Draco threw a glance over his shoulder to find him standing in the doorway awkwardly holding a hand to the back of his head. “I might not be able to make it out next week. It’ll be the run-up to Christmas, and half the office is out with spattergroit since McLaggen brought it back from his Belfast trip.”
“Vince, you’re free to take off when you like. I’ll see you at home,” Draco told the owl who’d been watching him with a narrow gaze.
Draco quirked a small smirk. “Thank you.”
Potter’s next moan contained a whimper and Draco set to work, sliding those fingers in and out of the warmth, curling them, twisting them, seeking the spot that would make Potter scream.
“Stranger things have happened,” she said vaguely, before stepping outside.
A few minutes later he was in the attic of the old Black house with all three cauldrons simmering, making a frankly alarming amount of the solution, while Potter poked around at the wall of junk.
Then he sank heavily into his chair, wrapping his quilt around him, with nothing to distract him from his spinning thoughts.
There was laughter over something that Draco had probably just missed when they entered the drawing room, then as the room’s occupants caught sight of him they all fell silent. Well, almost all of them did.
By the time Potter returned to the drawing room Draco had tidied up the sprawl of books and notes, condensing them to two small stacks on the table. There was some prickling in his right shoulder so he rolled it a few times, sighing in annoyance.
“If you let me know soon I can probably find a nice branch for it. Otherwise, you’ll need to make do.”
They remained silent while Potter prepared their mugs, helped himself to the tea bags, and stood next to the wood stove not looking at Draco, intermittently clenching and unclenching his fists. Several minutes later he handed a steaming mug of tea over to him, then dropped into a conjured chair and pinned him with an intent look.
It wasn’t a terrible way to start the day, he thought to himself some time later, his mouth slowly and leisurely swirling over the leaking tip of Potter’s erection, before abandoning it to nibble along his inner thigh. His mind felt wonderfully clear, not yet completely aware enough to begin to panic over anything. It was nice.
“Hello boys!” she called brightly as she entered, taking a quick moment to glance at each of them in their seats before she shut the door. “Draco, I hope you’re still behaving?”
He spun around. “What do you mean, this isn’t going to work?” he hissed, his eyes narrowed. “I’ve paid for the brooms. I’ve allowed you to put ridiculous restrictions on my access to those brooms. I make the simple request to know what charms are on the bloody things and you wait until now to tell me that I can’t?”
A minute later the air was clear and all signs of the trunk vanished. He sat on the edge of the bed staring at his reflection, dabbing at the litany of scratches that covered his face with the corner of the towel.
,” he pointed out.
He didn’t hear any stomping following him, though there was some cursing in the distance. Once Draco was back indoors and wiping himself dry with a towel he asked, “Say, do you think he’ll storm back here to yell at me some more?”
“I can’t believe it,” Draco fumed as he stalked out of the small alcove where the Apparition point was tucked away, letting the heavy door metal bang shut on Potter behind him. He couldn’t even be pleased by the short yelp that the man uttered before he pushed through the door as well.
“You two seem to work well together,” he said once they were walking between the trees, his feet occasionally kicking up clumps of snow ahead of him.
Vince gave him a slow blink.
Potter’s hands were everywhere, scraping up his back, running up his chest, clutching at his shoulders, gripping his arse. Draco’s were fighting against the multiple layers—honestly, why was Potter wearing a jumper and shirt and a singlet
Swing.
Potter grimaced. “We put a lot of work into it. It still tends to not really let the sunlight in through the windows unless I’m hungover, and doxies keep finding their way to the curtains, but other than that it’s definitely not the museum of horrors that it used to be.”
“We’re going to die.”
back soon,” Draco corrected, pulling out the bright green foam apple bearing some corporate logo that they’d been given as their latest International Portkey. Singapore. Well, that would certainly be hell on their internal clocks. “He doesn’t give a toss about me.”
“Potter.” He spoke slowly and took care to enunciate clearly, wondering if it would help the simpleton understand. “I am going to be enchanting the brooms. These charms will be adapted to work with the brooms. You are supposed to tell me if these charms will cause any issues with those that are already on the
“Are you making
Potter’s mouth went lopsided, his eyes crinkling slightly, and he replied, “Yeah, I guess that was a daft thought.”
There was another long pause, and Draco could imagine the facial contortions that were taking place behind him. But he felt some satisfaction when there was a rustling of papers and Potter started speaking about the broom enchantments.
“Brooms aren’t a violation of my proba—”
“I couldn’t say. I can hardly even keep track of the date anymore, at this point.”
When he arrived he could see his mother strolling up the front lane as if the land was still hers, while Potter had opted to wait by the gate.
He took a slow sip of his soup, waiting. Based on the shifting expression on Potter’s face, he was having some sort of internal crisis.
“And from a personal one?”
Draco blinked his eyes open as he muttered a curse. “Fine,” he bit out. “At least then your nudity will be situationally appropriate.
He tilted his head. “As long as you promise to share your photos with me, I don’t see why not.”
Instead, he spent the time digging deeper into his muggle books about space, learning what he could about the
Draco looked over to see him looking at the horrifying troll leg and raised an eyebrow. “I don’t think you should sound so fond when looking at
He took another minute to collect himself before opening his eyes and following Potter to the front gates of the estate where he’d grown up, his stomach still churning.
“You go back to work next month.”
After a small helping of pudding, when he was feeling warm, and full, and quite content, Potter pulled out a bottle of amber liquid and held it up with an inquiring gaze.
Soon the battered broom was brimming with magic and returned to the drawer, and then the temperature in the chamber was climbing again, the space beyond the window a blinding white before Hermione ended the test.
“Draco,” Potter whispered and Draco’s pulse was racing in a confusing mix of panic from Hermione’s interruption, and the heady need of his arousal. Without thinking his free hand rose to trace Potter’s cheekbone, and he bit his lip as the man’s eyes fluttered shut. Then he dropped his hand when his brain caught up with the words that had been contained in the message.
Draco was just looking over the assortment of ‘junk’, as Hermione had called it, when Kreacher popped in.
“Potter,” he said, his voice coming out raspy.
“All set then?”
He could see Potter’s fingers tightening their hold on the mug so much that the joints were white, but he didn’t pull away from Draco’s faint touch.
A few hours later he hadn’t successfully managed to get the charm to activate when he tested by asking Vince to perch on the broom, but it was activating whenever he so much as touched it. To be certain, though, he wanted another tester.
“I know that you don’t like the idea, but can you agree to accept some help on this?” The concerned look was back.
“Oh, you’re just hilarious,” Potter drawled, rolling his eyes.
“Hmm. You’ll see him before then, right? Or I suppose you can write him, whichever’s easiest.” She was replacing the notebooks that she’d pulled out over the course of the afternoon in her bag with an expression indicating that her words were completely reasonable. Which they weren’t, but he found that he couldn’t bring himself to argue with her.
His partner dragged him into what definitely appeared to be a shady warehouse on the way back, though the people there happily enough sold them a bottle of something alcoholic as long as they also purchased a case of horrendously overpriced water. And so, with the moon high overhead and the seaside town becoming quieter with each step, they made their way back to the yacht.
“Hermione came by,” he said casually while he dug the teabags out of his cupboard.
“Hmm, there we are.” She flipped the switch back and the fire immediately extinguished inside the chamber. Twenty seconds later there was a quiet
“Not my fault you were a spoiled prat and never had to make your own fun with a football when you were bored.”
The afternoon was proving to be even longer, now that the sun’s potent rays were hitting their glass balcony door and the multitude of windows in their hotel room, turning the place into a greenhouse. Or an oven. Or the surface of the bloody sun.
There was sleet each day, accompanied by biting cold winds, keeping him for the most part indoors. By Thursday he was seriously contemplating teaching himself to knit, and he had re-read his science books enough times that he could almost quote many of the more interesting chapters. On Friday he decided to give the inside of his cabin a thorough cleaning and painstakingly scrubbed every stone and every log until not a speck of dust or down remained.
Draco frowned and walked over to open his bedroom door, only seeing his mother’s owl on the perch. “No, Vince isn’t back from his hunt yet.
“Exactly.” Her expression somehow hardened further, then she continued, “The vacuum of space.
Despite Potter frowning deeply at that response he didn’t argue. A few seconds passed and he simply said, “Okay.”
He turned around to see a bemused look on the other man’s face.
“Kreacher,” he then said to the quiet room, “Can you please bring us two glasses and a bottle of something with alcohol in it?”
Draco let out a slow breath, clenching his eyes shut. Despite the small size of the lawn he knew that he was shielded from notice from any muggles who might happen by, but that didn’t prevent him from feeling exposed, standing in a city he wasn’t terribly familiar with, out in the open with all of his emotions. And he hadn’t even had to say more than three words to his mother yet, nor had he approached his father’s grave.
Draco shook his head, then watched as the man conjured one before withdrawing platters of food from a bag inside his cloak.
, but she claimed that she
When he finally awoke it was to find Vince perched in a tree on the edge of the clearing giving him a judging stare.
Potter finally entered and shut the door behind him, then stared at him a bit while he replied, “Molly always sends me home with too many leftovers. And we had Christmas dinner yesterday, and she sent me off with far too much, especially since I’m going to be there tomorrow as well. You mentioned you weren’t doing anything for Christmas, so. . . .” He trailed off, still somewhat staring, and there was a dull flush rising up his neck.
Nine months so far of the classes he had no real use for.
By the time he returned Draco had a tray of diced root vegetables cooking above the fire.
The door shut, then there was the crack of Disapparition.
Amid the loud bang of the trunk shattering there was quite a bit of screeching from Vince, understandably. As the splinters rained around him Draco was distantly aware of the noises from downstairs changing, then the sounds of rapid footsteps pounding up the stairs.
He stared at it.
Potter’s smile turned sad, but surprisingly it didn’t vanish like Draco thought it might. “No. I haven’t really mentioned that I’ve seen you. Nothing against you, but—well, I figured you’d prefer the privacy. And most of them wouldn’t really react all that well.”
?” Potter sounded utterly baffled.
Draco leaned forward to catch his attention. “No. You can’t—he doesn’t deserve that respect from anyone, let alone you. It’ll be a media spectacle! She’s using you to puff up the family name. How can you not see that?”
“Not at all.”
“That is
“Yeah. I’m running out of excuses,” Potter said, worrying his lip.
“You’ve set aside my history for now, since there are other things that you see here that hold your interest. Other things to keep your mind occupied. But once you cease to be surprised by the way that I’m living my life, you’ll remember that I used to be a bully, and that I said and did horrible things to you, and your friends, and pretty much everyone, and that I was a Death Eater, and—”
Draco flapped a hand lazily in response while he started applying the same charms to the large stone. Once he’d finished, he looked up to find Potter looking quite tense and flustered. A part of him enjoyed the sight.
He slowly pushed himself up, supporting himself on his elbows, wincing at the dull ache in his shoulders, and looked around. Well. He was clearly in St Mungo’s, though he had no idea why.
“I’m almost surprised that you didn’t make one on your own.”
Weasley stood there gaping, eyes narrowing while Draco contemplated returning to his cabin, Hermione’s wrath be damned. Meanwhile there was the clattering of footsteps on the narrow staircase to the basement indicating Potter’s approach.
“No. Absolutely do not allow her to have that much power over him. And do what you can to control how much access she has to him, and ensure that he isn’t alone with her without you or his grandmother present. She wouldn’t hurt him, but she would certainly put some persistent ideas in his head.”
Draco glanced up at his face, noting that Potter was avoiding meeting his gaze. “Well now I insist on hearing it.”
“It must be exhausting to be that furious all the time,” he mused, as he dug out things to make dinner.
Draco was lying down on a soft surface that might have been his chair except that it didn’t recline quite this flat. Had he fallen asleep in the clearing again? But no, it was winter, so the ground would be much firmer. And the smells were wrong.
“So, Draco. You went to test the Bubble-Head and Atmospheric Charms. Isn’t that right?” Her words were clipped, her tone sharp.
When he didn’t make any move to sit down again Draco stood as well, his hand gripping his mug tightly. Vince clicked his talons over on his perch.
Then again, the more names he heard in connection with Hermione and her personal life, the more that Potter’s earlier comment about independent women and sexual needs started to make some sense. Even though it was a subject he very much didn’t want to think about.
?” He spat out the last word.
And then it was Thursday, and Potter arrived early again to share a hot breakfast with him before Hermione arrived.
“That’s all for today, I think,” he then said, turning back toward Potter. “I don’t want to add anything else until I can be sure that those charms won’t unravel.”
Draco slid his gaze over, but didn’t see anything other than interest in Potter’s expression. Well, interest and nervousness, perhaps. And that nervousness seemed to intensify the longer he didn’t answer. The part of him that used to thrive on needling Potter was waking up, enjoying this strange tension, so he remained silent.
Draco turned to face Vince’s judging stare.
The liquid was amber-coloured and it burned going down, and Draco supposed that it didn’t quite matter what the faded label read since there was definitely alcohol in it.
“Oh my,” she said, looking intrigued more than anything.
He huffed a quiet laugh before he could even think about it. “Of course not. We haven’t killed each other yet.”
He had managed some progress when he’d tinkered with the charm earlier, using his chair, but he soon realised that the broom was a bit simpler to work with given its smaller size and more uniform composition, at least as far as materials were concerned. He also determined rather quickly that he wouldn’t be able to create a large protective bubble of air around the entirely of the broom; this charmwork didn’t seem to led itself to that result at
“Sorry, Malfoy. Er, I was wondering if Vince is all right? He’s been kicking up a racket the whole time you were in there,” he said, waving an arm toward the steamy bathroom.
What was surprising was Potter hadn’t once been petty or vindictive enough to deliberately order Draco something he wouldn’t like.
“Hermione mentioned that the joint pain sometimes lingers for up to three months,” Potter said in a low voice, and it took Draco a few seconds to piece together the words and their meaning.
“I’ll need to brutally assault a broom,” he said as he drew his knife.
“Seriously. You can’t tell me that that’s not what you’re planning.”
And then Potter was walking toward him, broom in hand. When he was close he asked, “Now what?”
Draco blinked at that, then lifted his head to meet the man’s gaze. “I don’t know why she’d think that.”
Draco took the opportunity to lean further into the man, bracing his hands on Potter’s thighs as he dipped his head to catch one of those dusky nipples with his lips, at first gently running his tongue over it, tasting the salty skin, then taking it into his mouth to suck and nibble at it, feeling Potter’s entire body quivering in tension.
They hadn’t yet made it to the bedroom, nor had they managed to enjoy each other in any new ways; as soon as Potter looked at Draco like
Potter snorted. “Yeah, and
He led the way to the clearing, enjoying the sensation of the crisp leaves and broken twigs crunching under his bare feet as he walked, focusing on the coolness of the light afternoon drizzle misting his face. Somewhere nearby there was a woodpecker, its rhythmic tapping only halting when a loud curse sounded behind him as Potter jogged to catch up.
Potter rolled his eyes dramatically but did so, and grinned at him, his eyes lighting up in excitement.
“Did you finally realise that the holiday season is long over?” he asked when he entered the room, catching sight of Potter carefully removing decorations and placing them into padded boxes.
Potter reached over, his fingers running along the end of the blanket that was still wrapped around Draco. “No making excuses about me being tired?”
Potter huffed, then gave him an odd look that was half frown half smile. “Are you okay to take a break and work on brooms now, or did you need to finish up with this?”
“Hmm.” There was quiet as the boat gently rocked beneath them, occasionally bumping up against the dock with a dull thud. “Is it what you thought it’d be?”
“Yes, but there are dangers to you as well. It’s—oh, I brought something. Hold on.” She rummaged around in her bag and pulled out an enormous textbook, then flipped it open on a page that she’d marked with a purple sticky note.
“The Hogwarts Express will bring him to London next Saturday. So—you don’t need to stay all the way to Easter if you don’t want to. Just . . . another two weeks. Not quite two weeks.”
Potter was pacing, looking all around, as if Draco might be hiding up in the trees of all places. He’d lost the hard edges of scrawniness that he’d had in his youth, and his glasses were narrow rectangular things, but otherwise he looked much as a memory of him would have. If Draco bothered to revisit his memories at all.
he fucking cared and just managed to snap his mouth shut again before the words came spilling out. After taking a breath to find another, less troublesome response, he instead said, “She’s my mother, and she’s trying to manipulate you in order to get to us
He found Potter in the kitchen nursing an enormous mug of what smelled like coffee and he stopped at the doorway.
“Of course I see that!” Potter exclaimed, finally facing him, his eyes burning. “I know exactly what she’s trying to do, because she obviously thinks that the act will disgust me so much that I’ll refuse to do it, and guilt you into going. Because she’s your family, and she and the whole fucking world knows how important family is to me. Anyway, I don’t see why you care.”
Amazingly, Draco received a note by owl two days later to let him know that Potter wouldn’t be by until the following week due to other obligations. He hadn’t expected the man to be capable of any such courtesy. So Draco instead spent several evenings after class fiddling around with the Bubble-Head Charm, determining how to apply it to his chair. If he could enchant a broom with it so that it could produce breathable air around it, rather than maintaining the spell on himself, he would feel much safer.
Draco glanced over just in time to see the owl blink slowly at him.
Finding his mind wandering to the strange things that had certainly already happened with the man upstairs Draco made his way down to the kitchen to find the promised plate on the table waiting for him. He was just bringing it over to the sink to wash up when he heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs and tensed.
Draco was comparing those points against his list and nodded when they all seemed accounted for. “That sounds good. Potter, do you still have that first broom in your bag? We can use that one for the initial test.”
“There is being one on the ground floor,” he replied immediately.
Then he was released, feeling quite dazed as the man stepped around him and cleaned up the mess.
He looked up at that and said sharply, “I do, you twat.” Then he swallowed noisily and looked back down toward the floor.
He liked to think that what he was feeling was merely irritation. Irritation was simple. He could live with irritation.
The horrible bird swooped in through his bedroom window and dropped its letter on his chest before careening over to Vince’s perch; fortunately it wasn’t occupied as he hadn’t yet returned from his latest hunt. Once landed the eagle owl stared at him unblinking.
Draco rose to his feet and slipped on his boots while Potter guzzled what must have been the rest of Hermione’s coffee. “Oh?” he asked casually. “Pray tell.”
“Lunch,” Potter said patiently, though there was a nervous sort of energy around him. “I usually have a few friends around on Saturdays for lunch, and I obviously haven’t done that in several weeks. They’re starting to worry about me so I might head out? If you don’t mind?”
Several minutes later the tingling sensation of a Cleaning Charm swept through his pants and he opened his eyes, carefully rising to his feet. Potter was tucking himself away and doing up his flies, a soft smile playing about his lips.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, withholding a sigh. “And can you
Mercifully, Potter retreated to his loveseat to finish his tea and Draco could breathe. A few minutes later, after Draco had returned to his chair and been looking out the window, Potter broke the silence by sharing a story about the emergency order of brooms that he’d needed to bring to Diagon Alley half an hour before closing on Christmas Eve, because of a toddler’s outburst of accidental magic incinerating half the shop when there was still a queue of last-minute shoppers.
“The sights,” he said again, hoping that maybe his point had been made rather clear.
Friday he was a high-strung emotional mess from the moment he arrived at his cabin in the morning until he finally forced himself to fall asleep that night.
“I’m quite certain that I won’t be attending those events,” he said, thinking of his plans.
“It’s rather late,” he said instead, handing the bottle over to Potter who accepted it with a bemused expression. “I should get home and have some dinner.”
An hour later he landed, his feet squelching slightly in the mud that was beginning to form on the ground.
“Yes. It’ll be best if I bring you there. How about ten o’clock?”
Draco was now seeing how Potter and his friends had managed to defeat the Dark Lord. How Potter had won the Triwizard Tournament. It was almost frightening how focused and decisive she was, on top of the intelligence that he’d always known her to possess. “Yes, I suppose that would work,” he said carefully, then he clarified, “
He knew enough to not bother blaming the alcohol when he held onto the warm body next to him tighter than he’d done before, unable to face those bright green eyes but feeling them burn into him nonetheless. He fell asleep to the sensation of fingers carding gently through his hair while his heart continued to hammer in his chest, his guilt and fear refusing to let him go.
He was content.
So Draco did something stupid first, and leaned in.
“You really should have,” Potter replied with humour present in his tone, “considering we’ve cuddled plenty of times before.”
“Hmm.” She took another sip of her coffee, then her expression shifted entirely. “Well, I guess we might as well decide what we’re going to test out today while we wait for Harry.”
“Hmm? Oh, sorry. Just remembering.” Potter cleared his throat. “This was an umbrella stand right next to the front door. No clue why it was left there all the time, since Tonks would trip over it every single time she walked by. It was impressive, actually, her reliably consistent clumsiness.”
Partway through his brewing he was aware of Potter asking Kreacher to pop over to the cabin to retrieve a few trunks, and so once the solutions were ready he was able to set to work immediately applying the cooling liquid to the first one. Then he set to work on another triple batch, then another, until he had three trunks set aside to slowly absorb the potion.
“Fuck,” he exhaled, breathing hard. “Fucking fuck.”
Potter flinched, then said, “I’m not stealing your post. This came across my desk, so it’s my problem. What are you up to?” he demanded.
. Merlin.
Draco turned away to check the temperature of the jars. They were still quite hot, so he stepped away and sat in his chair. And he took some pleasure in not offering his visitor a place to sit.
Draco glared right back for a few seconds, then sat up and cracked open the letter.
Then on Friday, he celebrated being done with his Muggle Appreciation class by digging out one of his last bottles of birch sap beer from the previous winter and completing an owl order form for a furnishing store. He selected a bath with built-in charms for temperature control, then added a mirror too before sending it off with Vince. He justified the latter by the alarmingly low level of alcohol that was left in the bottle by that point.
The kettle started to whistle, jolting Draco fully back to the present.
Draco exchanged a look with Vince, brows raised. Maybe the rain
The tone was what made Draco pause and actually consider the question. They hadn’t been working together long as Aurors before they’d gotten the assignment, but even then they’d managed to act . . . well, not professionally, but certainly more maturely than he might have thought possible then. There was plenty of snark and attitude, from both sides, but nothing malicious. Nothing spiteful.
And it was so dark. . . .
He turned his head to look at the ceiling. What an exhibitionist.
that!”
On Saturday she arrived a good hour early for lunch and popped her head into Draco’s room long enough to order him up to the attic before marching up there herself.
Draco thought of the things he would be leaving behind, and though the answer didn’t come as easily anymore as it would have when he’d first contemplated the project, it was still there. “Yes.”
Ouzo. Of course.
The weather let up on Saturday and Vince returned late that afternoon, proceeding to sulk on his perch and not meet his gaze.
He nodded in understanding, then frowned at the seeds that were keeping that hand occupied. He walked over toward Potter, holding them out.
“Will you accept help,” he asked again, and was so close that Draco felt the puff of his breath against his face.
“What,” Draco snapped, shifting uncomfortably.
They sat there in a companionable silence for some time, until Draco’s glass was empty. He was just preparing to stand so that he could turn in for the night when Potter reached out and put a hand on his knee, stopping him.
He set to work heating up some dinner, washing the mugs while he waited, replaying the conversation in his head. He supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised that Potter was worried about him dying. The man would likely blame himself should anything happen to Draco, since he was involved in the project. And Potter did have a bloody complex.
Draco couldn’t contain his incredulous expression. “How is that even a question?” The man had been absolutely maddening. Infuriating.
Draco gave a small shake of his head. “I’m at a good stopping point. Let’s go.”
Draco felt something constricting in his chest as he listened quietly, feeling like something incredibly private was being shared with him. He wasn’t aware of how much time they spent with the decorations until Potter reached up for the next one and found all of the branches bare.
“Hmm. Not really, they were a few years under us I think. Mind you their older sister was in our year—Daphne?”
“How excited he is to have
It took all of his energy to simply keep breathing.
Draco couldn’t contain his scoff and turned to face him. Their eyes met and the moment seemed to drag on, the weight of concern in Potter’s heavy gaze drawing him in until he couldn’t hear the crackling of the fire right next to him. He swallowed, not knowing how to break the intensity.
“Yes, that’ll be fine,” he said. “And a mirror, if you don’t mind?”
about the bastard, the sense of inevitability that threatened to overwhelm him when he thought of staying, of trying to
“Hmm,” came the verbose reply. Draco finished with one branch and placed it into a hole, packing the earth tightly into place around it, then moved onto the next branch.
Draco swallowed. “Right. Listen, Gr—Hermione, I really do appreciate your generosity in helping me with this, especially considering what I’ve done to you over the years, and your suffering that I’m responsible for. I know that an apology doesn’t undo that, but . . . I
Then he sank down onto the couch next to Draco, his eyes closed and his head resting back.
Draco could feel Potter’s eyes on him, he could feel the weight of the concern in them, but he couldn’t face them. He felt like he was barely holding onto his resolve, his focus, his state of calm—if he wasn’t so wound-up he might laugh at Hermione’s comments about his apathy, because
Draco read the words twice, then folded up the heavy linen paper, holding it under his nose and breathing in the familiar floral scent. He knew that his staying here hurt her, and that she didn’t understand it at all, but at the same time. . . .
On Sunday, after a morning of reorganising his pantry, Draco was just staring blankly at the loveseat when he heard the loud crack of Apparition out front. A groan escaped him before he could think about it and he rolled his eyes, scooping his hair back into a knot as he stood, and opened the door.
She smiled. It was a friendly smile, though slightly nervous, but certainly not false. “Draco! And please, call me Hermione.” Her jaw hardened a little but she retained smile.
“I should have had an Imperturbable up,” Draco said, still feeling dazed.
“Yeah?”
Potter’s jaw hardened. “That’s right.
,” he paused, letting the word linger in the air before continuing, “don’t act like I’m someone you need to run away from. Because I’m here. I’m
He blinked again. “Hermione, then. Can I help you?”
“It’s no worry, really. As I said, it’s far too much food for me—they still feed me so much, even though it’s not like I’m starved anymore. But—yeah, it’s no worry.”
Draco frowned. “How so?” he asked cautiously.
Draco didn’t know how long he stared at his reflection, but when he finally drew himself away it was to methodically sharpen his knife. Then he sank into a scalding bath, gave himself a good wash, and soaked until he felt like his fingers might be shrivelled forever. After emerging he carefully trimmed his beard until it was neat and even.
“Not a problem. I take it Harry’s not here yet?” Draco shook his head as she sat down on the loveseat, pulling her coat off and digging a thermos out of her bag. “I hope you don’t mind that I brought coffee. Tea’s lovely, but I’m afraid it doesn’t quite do the trick for me in the morning.” She cracked the lid and steam rose from the container, filling the cabin with its rich, almost nutty, aroma.
He was also so
“If I were the type, I’d make some smart comment about your healing charms,” Draco said quietly, the corner of his mouth rising in a faint smirk.
“Just wondering if you were out for a swim,” he replied, gesturing at the towel that Draco had hung up by the door, and then his clothing, likely at the fact that it was obviously still damp.
“No, you go ahead. I don’t have an overly large collection of texts and I haven’t had much occasion to do any brewing, so my recollection of recipes is not the best.”
The other man slowly rose to his feet as well and then took a few steps back, widening the space between them. “No, I can keep it out. I’ll store it at mine, then, so that it doesn’t get carried off by anyone around the office.”
Then the man took a step back, hands clenched at his sides. “Later, Draco,” he said softly.
After that what remained of their list required a bit more research into radiation protection on Hermione’s part, so at half two they called it a day and Draco followed Potter back to London.
“Oh, that would be lovely, thank you,” she replied amicably, as if this was a perfectly ordinary social call.
Draco blinked slowly. “Did I stutter? I said the Bubble-Head Charm.”
He wasn’t really aware of the sounds from the hallway until there was a short knock on the door and he looked up to see Hermione slipping into the room.
Draco was feeling fortunate that he wasn’t the one gripping Potter’s arm, otherwise he was certain he’d have cut off the man’s circulation at the brazen act. “We’re supposed to cross at the lights! Or—or at least a zebra crossing!” he hissed, gesturing with his free arm.
Vince ruffled his feathers, watching him.
Their conversation carried on rather professionally from there, astoundingly, with Draco occasionally interjecting with questions, and Potter needing to flip through his notes to find specific details but otherwise replying without losing his head. After about thirty minutes the mixture had thickened enough so he took the saucepan off the heat and poured its contents into half a dozen jars, leaving them on his small work surface to cool while he tidied up.
Draco was just contemplating taking a nap against the wall when the door creaked open and Hermione entered.
“Oh. Thanks. I’ll just bring it up—actually, I’ll walk up with you. That’s fine,” he stammered, and Draco allowed the final fleeting thought of escape to pass across his mind before burying it.
Draco fought with the window until he worked it open past the initial stiffness in the frame.
Draco blinked a few times, absently thinking that his face felt rather tingly. “Extension Charms and Atmospheric Charms don’t mix,” he said, bemused.
He couldn’t think of a way to respond to that so they sat in silence for several minutes, listening to the crackling of the fire, until the kettle started to whistle. A few minutes later he was sitting back down and they both held steaming mugs.
“—don’t go!” Potter interrupted, then hurried down the rest of the steps toward him. “Really, please, don’t go. It’ll be fine, Hermione thinks you’re great, they’re all nice, Eddie’s here and he’ll tell you all about how much he loves dragons, and I’ll feed you, it’s fine.”
Potter arched against him at the touch, adding his now freed hand to join the other in Draco’s hair. “Enjoy you—gorgeous idiot,” he groaned, then proceeded to suck hard on Draco’s bottom lip.
Potter blinked at him owlishly, then conjured a chair so large it was practically a loveseat, taking up much of the space in the cabin. He then switched seats and slouched, crumpling as if he didn’t have a spine in his back to support him.
Hermione narrowed her eyes but Potter just snickered and shook his head. “Nah, he’s in Hufflepuff. Much more . . . rebellious than I ever was—he has far more friends to involve in his trouble, and the professors don’t even think to suspect him. Despite the fact that he was caught impersonating Flitwick on the first day of class.”
It didn’t take terribly long to anchor his Atmospheric Charms to the broom, though he spent a considerable amount of time finessing the range, and the duration. The success of the former was measured by ordering Potter to walk around the clearing, stopping at certain distances and describing what he felt; Draco remained professional outwardly but there was certainly something about bossing him around that was appealing. The success of the latter remained to be determined.
There was a loud sigh from Hermione, and Weasley laughed too loudly, but soon the rest of the adults in the room returned to their conversation and left him to sit quietly. Which he was fine with.
“Potter?”
“Yes, the last of them headed out a few minutes ago. Harry mentioned that he’s got a plate for you in the kitchen if you’re hungry,” she said absently as her eyes scanned over the list, then she looked up at him. “This looks fine. I should be able to swing by with everything tomorrow.”
Once they’d arrived back at the cabin—and Draco never knew why Potter always accompanied him, rather than simply Disapparating immediately—the other man spoke again. “Tomorrow’s the start of December, so I’ll only be able to guarantee one visit each week, most likely. Christmas sales are sheer madness.”
Shortly the brewing was completed and he opened the trunk, and spent the next several hours painstakingly coating every inch with the thin liquid, brushing on several coats to ensure that it was absorbed evenly into the wood. When the last of the infusion had been used he stood and stretched, then looked around to see that Potter had left the room at some point.
Two days later, after a particularly miserable class involving role-playing the act of shopping in a muggle grocer’s, Draco returned home to find a red-faced Potter pacing outside, yelling for him.
With that she reached up to the shelf above her and grabbed a few paper napkins, then did something out of sight and shortly handed them each a long roll absolutely overflowing with lobster meat.
“Oh, so you are going to pretend to ignore me. Real mature, Malfoy. And what, are you going to pretend I don’t exist when I keep coming back so that you can work on your brooms? Because I’m not going to let this go. You can’t just—shit fuck!”
A tension that he didn’t realise he’d been carrying since he woke up suddenly dissolved and he let out a harsh exhale, looking down at his hands. “And what did she demand of you, to agree to that?”
There was silence for a few seconds, but he felt the bubble of warmth from the broom wrap around him, giving away Potter’s approach. He kept his head facing upward and shut his eyes.
“So you’ve been taking photos of me because you want a collection of photos of me,” Draco said, trying to make sure he was understanding the situation. There was a coil of something that felt like excitement in his gut, and he felt his pulse quicken in response.
Swing.
He sat there blinking the bright spots out of his eyes. Just as he was able to make out Potter’s face in the darkness the other man burst into laughter.
“Oh goodness,” Hermione said, immediately leaping to her feet and opening the door. “I completely lost track of time. Sorry about that!”
“It’s been in the bag the whole time. The bag’s been here, my place, and the office. Oh, and it also came with me to the stadium outside of Liverpool by mistake but your brooms stayed inside the whole time.”
“Are you sure? Oh. I guess I should’ve asked, it’s a bit early in the day still. I can just—”
Pansy’s name was a common one in the society pages, since she’d apparently had some torrid affair with a squib Italian designer a few years earlier and somehow turned into a fashion icon. Theo’s name was all over the business pages after purchasing about half the shops in Knockturn Alley and turning them into a large assembly hall. Even Greg, whose Azkaban sentence had been a mere two years long, was now a well-regarded chef in Cardiff.
A short time later they were in their respective seats, and things were quiet as they ate. Throughout the meal Potter kept giving him odd looks, so finally when Draco had swallowed his last bite he sighed and said, “Just spit it out.”
Potter’s smile, which he imagined hadn’t once slipped from his face, somehow grew even softer and Draco swallowed hard. The man raised his hand to Draco’s jaw, running a thumb along his cheek, then brought up the other one to do the same on his other cheek.
“The brooms need to be attached to the trunk and I need to fashion some living quarters, but yes. It’s ready.”
Potter still hadn’t let go of his arm from when they’d Apparated. “It’s the 27th. Well, the 28th now, I guess.”
The rest of the week passed much in the same way, and Draco thought that he might well go mad. It wasn’t until Thursday arrived that he finally had a break in the monotony.
A few hours later after they’d both eaten, had a drink, and retreated to Potter’s room they spent an eternity slowly enjoying each other’s bodies, but this was different from the times they’d done so before. Draco felt it in every touch, every kiss, every breath, each one so slow and soft and tender. It wasn’t just fucking anymore. He didn’t know how that had happened, but he couldn’t ignore it any longer.
And he was thinking of her as Hermione now, because the look in her eyes when he’d called her by her surname was something else.
Then he put some oil in his hair, tucked himself into his quilt, and spent the next hour carefully combing out his hair for the first time in over a decade.
Mercifully, his owl order arrived on Thursday so he was able to spend the afternoon making the final adjustments to the bathroom. And when he caught sight of himself in the mirror, seeing his own face for the first time in years, he didn’t recognise the stranger looking back at him.
Potter nodded. “All right. We’ll do that.” Then a faint crease formed between his brows in the barest hint of a frown. A few seconds later his expression cleared and he gave Draco a slanted look, asking, “How else can we be of use to each other?”
Potter nodded and seemed to be deliberating over something, then wandered over to sit on a large rock. Draco proceeded to ignore him, getting on with his work.
He would absolutely be having a nap once the infuriating man left. “Atmospheric Charms?”
Draco knocked down the last of the ice and returned to the front door, feeling the bubble of warmth around the broom as he stepped up next to Potter. The man had particularly windswept hair, as if he’d flown in instead of Apparating.
Something about the house was familiar, but with the aching in his joints and the exhaustion that was catching up to him Draco couldn’t spare the focus to try to figure out why. He was led to a bedroom, where felt an overwhelmingly warm sensation in his chest when he saw Vince sitting on a perch next to the window, and somehow managed to get himself onto the bed before sleep overtook him.
“That is
His eyes widened. Astoria Greengrass. And Hermione Granger.
“Here, enjoy a snack while you wait.” Potter accepted them with a bemused expression, then sat on his rock.
Then there was a huff of laughter, gentle in tone, and a murmur that Draco didn’t understand. What he did understand was the brief squeezing sensation and the loud crack before they were somewhere else entirely.
The next few minutes were spent in silence. When his soup was hot he poured it into a large mug and dropped the saucepan and spoon into his wash basin, giving the water pump a few presses. Then he turned, glanced longingly at his empty chair, and settled for leaning against the wall.
Once they broke apart Draco let his forehead fall against Potter’s shoulder, breathing unsteadily, his racing pulse only just beginning to slow. He could feel the other man trailing a hand up and down his arm, leaving goose pimples in their wake.
Draco caught the fingers, threading them together with his own. “No running off if you hear a noise?” he countered.
That question had clearly thrown him, since the man’s eyebrows contorted and he choked on his drink. Well, that hadn’t been intentional but Draco certainly enjoyed it, though he didn’t show it.
The next morning he awoke to find his hand already palming his hard cock and smiled fiercely, swiftly entering the bathroom to bring himself off under a hot steaming shower.
and the large sign dimmed.
Maybe he wasn’t ascending—was he spinning?
Frowning, Draco pulled out his knife again and just as he was about to pry at the fastening that held the bristles to the shaft to loosen them Potter marched over and snatched at the handle.
And next to him stood Potter, looking unbearably smug.
“The safety manual.” A blank look. “The list of enchantments that are currently on the broom.”
Potter made a strange expression in response then pulled a broom from his expanded pouch and handed it over, before shuffling off toward his rock.
“So what’ll you do once you’re in space? Go to the moon? Start a wizarding space station? Clean up space junk?”
Then as he shifted he smiled when his quilt seemed to hug him closer.
Draco swallowed hard.
“Tomorrow’s the 28th.”
He bit his tongue and winced. “Not . . . as such, no. Not yet.”
A bit over an hour after they’d started Hermione tucked her notebook away with a satisfied expression. “That should do it for that particular requirement. And I don’t foresee any issues with your Sticking Charms. You mentioned going to the coast to test the Bubble-Head more thoroughly?”
“I’d planned to go through the safety manual next,” Draco called from the doorway when it became apparent that Potter wasn’t going to wait for him to follow.
He may have fallen asleep in the chair. It was difficult to tell, with how much the trees outside filtered out sunlight even on the brightest of days. But he opened his eyes when he heard a shriek, and sighed when the familiar eagle owl swooped into the room, dropping a letter on his lap. It then settled on the window sill next to the other owl, somehow giving Vince a disdainful look.
Potter said something more, but he couldn’t identify any words in the sounds. He could only feel the relief of the pressure, the warmth of the firm touch, the tension that was bleeding out of the soles of his feet into the kitchen floor.
When Draco awoke the following morning his first thought was that he wished his chair was always this cozy and warm.
Draco swallowed at the tension he could hear in Potter’s voice at that statement, despite the easy way he spoke the words.
“You think I’d doing this as a hobby?”
Draco approached, feeling the bubble of warmth in the air intensify once he was close enough, the charms on the rock overlaying those on the brooms he held, noting that Potter stiffened slightly at his proximity. So he stepped back, giving a bit more space, then handed over the broom with the stone set into the handle.
Well, he imagined he might look a fright. He didn’t own a mirror, and frankly didn’t care what the others in his Muggle Appreciation classes thought of him, and it wasn’t as though he ever saw anyone else. But he hadn’t trimmed his beard since they’d updated his photo with the Ministry upon his release, and his hair was in a messy knot at the back of his head, and if today’s shirt was like most of his others it was probably covered in wood chips.
Thinking over the events of the previous evening and morning he let out a shaky breath. He needed to shower, then find Potter to relay some sort of excuse, then make his escape. He could do that. Three simple steps.
On Saturday Draco couldn’t help but pop over to his house for lunch with the rest of his friends, even knowing that the hours spent with so many people that he didn’t know would be agonising, but he had to do it.
The other man just nodded so they set off toward the clearing.
He didn’t stop staring at the hand that was holding his the whole way.
“What date is it, exactly?” he asked quietly.
A faint flush rose on Potter’s cheeks and his hand was in his messy hair. “I did,” he agreed, his eyes wide. “I didn’t expect you to come.”
He turned to the other owl and said simply, “No response.” Then he rose and went to grab a bowl of the stew he’d set to bubble away several hours earlier, ignoring the bird’s annoyed screeches as it flew away.
“They’re—well, I don’t think they are,” Potter said nervously. “I mean, what I did to you was horrible, but they. . . . Never mind, it’s stupid.”
Draco looked up, wondering what had happened to Potter. He sounded like an even-tempered, reasonable human being. Then man was looking at him expectantly, gnawing on his lip, so he shook his head and said, “No, I haven’t figured out what I’m going to do about the heat yet.”
Once he arrived he was pleased to see that the rock’s enchantments had held, as there was a visible ring of dry grass around it, uncovered by snow. Draco shook out the towel, laying it on the ground within the bubble of warmth and stretching out on it, feeling his upper back twinge, then gazed up at the twinkling sky. His eyes immediately sought the familiar constellations and he spent what felt like hours simply lying there, hearing his mother’s soft voice in his head, until his eyelids grew heavy and he fell into a dreamless slumber.
“You realise I’m going to be keeping that window shut once it starts snowing, right?”
“Thank you, that’s all I needed,” he said, then opened it up to reveal his own clothing and towels from home.
“What the fuck was that?” he hissed at Vince.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Should I have a problem with you being there?” he asked slowly.
Because he
Then the footsteps approached again, and from too close he heard, “Very nice, Malfoy. I’m impressed.”
“Well, she said she’s a researcher. After hearing that, and the fact that she has a magical and a muggle degree,
There was a low hoot from the windowsill.
Draco stared.
“Thank you,” Draco said wryly. “Shall we?”
“There. That should be a decent start for ventilation. I’ve asked Harry to look over the wards already so this is as safe as any brewing cellar. Now, I don’t think it’s wise to begin anything experimental, but if being productive will prevent you from resorting to more dangerous activities then you may as well start working on the brewing from our list.”
His hand came up to nervously mess up his hair and he looked away. “Er, right. I just mean, if you aren’t supposed to be using a wand anymore, then I don’t want to witness anything that I shouldn’t.”
The package from Flourish and Blotts arrived the next day while Draco was in class, so when he returned he dealt with the rest of the woodpile, finished assembling the perch for Vince, and settled into his chair with a mug of tea, a quilt, and his new books, not rising until it was too dark to make out the words on the pages. Then he lit a lantern and placed it on the windowsill next to him, and continued to read for hours.
When he arrived he slumped back against the front door, his breath coming in shuddering gasps, and he was only vaguely aware of the sound of Potter Apparating in before he was being held tightly in his arms. And he couldn’t do anything but continue to try to breathe, and it was so damn difficult, reminding him of being underwater, his body fighting against the dangers of decompression. His fingers were digging so deeply into Potter’s back that he was sure he’d leave bruises but he couldn’t let go of his solid form, since he was the only thing holding him upright.
Draco swallowed.
. . .
He blinked a few times. “I really don’t want to know. I suppose I’m staying with you then.”
Then there was the warm, heavy weight of his hands on Draco’s shoulders, slowly and methodically pressing into those aching spots, and he dipped his head, letting his chin fall to his chest.
After the quiet pop of the house-elf appearing Potter shut the door, the sound of his heavy footsteps fading as he descended to the first floor.
Then Hermione reached into her bag and produced a trunk that she had apparently taken the liberty to
He shrugged. “Might as well, when there’s food to be found in these woods.”
,” Potter whimpered, his fingers digging hard into Draco’s shoulders, and the sound of his name falling from Potter’s lips in that tone almost brought him to the edge.
“Listen, Draco. It’s doesn’t have to—you don’t—”
“Yeah, I know,” he muttered to Vince before rubbing a hand over his face. Then he looked up toward Granger and asked, “Do you mind if we make up a list of all of the concerns that you think we should consider?”
“Agreed.” After waiting for Hermione to fiddle with the buttons a bit more and lead them out of the room, they returned to her office and Draco donned his coat.
He was buried so deeply in his thoughts that he didn’t even hear the crack of Apparation and had to blink a few times before he realised that yes, Potter really was in his cabin and no, he wasn’t imagining things.
His eyes widened.
“Later, Draco. Take care of him, Vince.”
Then there was the whisper of a spell and a cooling tingle brushed over his wrist, healing the burn that he’d forgotten about. Rather than releasing his hand he felt Potter’s thumb brush tentatively over his knuckles, startling him into inhaling sharply.
Draco took a sip even though it was still far too hot. Eyes watering slightly as his tongue burned, he reminded himself that he was doing this for himself. Even if a part of him wanted to answer the questions, and talk to someone other than Vince about what this meant for him. Because as much as he loved the bird, Vince didn’t really understand.
. Some of that process involves proprietary spellwork that I am
“Have you been clearing up your clutter?” he asked as he measured out ingredients.
Draco blinked. “Excuse me? You’re planning on printing these? Don’t I have a say in the matter?”
He refused to dignify that with any response at all.
Draco liked to think that the man deserved the splinters that he got.
The other man snorted. “Yeah. Anyway, she made me stay for lunch, then she showed me the garden, then she introduced me to all of her birds—she has at least twenty of them, I swear, and they all have absolutely ridiculous names—and then finally we got to talking about you.”
“Do you mind if those remain here until they set up?”
The remainder of the meal was spent quietly; their sleep the night before had been atrocious between the International Portkey from London and the time difference, so once they’d finished eating they each nursed several cups of incredible coffee.
Draco spent much of the following week brewing, always under the watchful gaze of Kreacher, and produced samples of the various concoctions that he and Hermione would test out on the assortment of brooms, trunks, and tents. On Thursday he rose early in case the witch popped by once again for a morning visit, then groaned when he recalled the date.
When it was hours past dusk and Draco couldn’t bear to suffer another gulp of the swill he set his glass down and rose to his feet.
“Enjoy!” she said cheerily, then looked away as a couple wandered over, looking to be perusing the menus of all of the little huts.
“It doesn’t matter either way for me. I’m usually up with the sun, so by around eight o’clock this time of year. And as I’ve said before, if I’m not in when you arrive then I’m around,” he said, gesturing out the window.
“I kind of forgot all of this stuff was up here,” he said, sounding almost wistful.
Draco was removing the rest of the seed clusters from his pocket and dropping them into a bowl for peeling when Potter cleared his throat.
Draco narrowed his eyes, not liking how much she had apparently been watching him.
Draco frowned as he looked more closely at the items, and found himself grimacing when he identified what looked like a preserved troll leg and a pile of house-elf heads.
Swing.
“Ten o’clock again, then?”
Then his words caught up with him, and Draco shook his head in exasperation, making his frozen strands of hair rattle against each other. He turned to drag over the next log.
With that settled she left after giving Potter a brief hug. The man then gathered up the two brooms and they set off together in the direction of the cabin.
“How long until we need to head down for the dinner meeting?”
