Harry blindly stumbled through the door of his little one room flat in central London and let his cloak fall to the ground behind him. It was dark and rainy outside but he didn't have the energy to hang up his cloak or even cast a drying spell on himself; all Harry wanted to do was sleep. Walking silently through his flat, not caring that he was trailing water everywhere, he peeled off his wet cloths and fell face first onto his unmade bed without even taking his glasses off. He sighed deeply as he let the welcoming arms of sleep fold around him.
“Damn it!” He swore loudly as his latest potion turned brilliant blue when it was supposed to be dark navy. Vanishing the ruined potion, Draco threw the reference book he was using across the room, wincing slightly at the loud clatter it made as it hit the floor. Draco dropped his head to the table, wondering if he should just close the shop for the day as he was clearly in no shape to brew anything.
Harry’s smile grew, “I don’t know exactly either,” he admitted, “all I know is that I haven’t stopped thinking about how much I wanted to kiss you again.”
Draco nodded, a little too stunned to say anything more.
“I wouldn’t dream letting go.”
Harry pulled Draco towards his chest again, and seeing Draco's confusing, he seized the opportunity to capture Draco's lips in another bruising kiss that sent shock waves through both of them. Draco moaned in the back of his throat as Harry pulled his hair, forcing his head back and allowing Harry's oh so talented tongue to make a thorough exploration of his mouth.
“Can you repeat that Potter? I don’t think I heard you properly.”
“Obviously, I meant useful information Potter,” Draco interrupted, turning again to face Harry.
Draco crossed his arms. “Well, I had to skip breakfast this morning otherwise I would have been late for work.”
Harry waited until Ron had disappeared from sight before following the lone figure down the corridor, and into a boy's lavatory. The scene gave Harry a sense of déjà vu. The lean body slumped over a sink, head bowed, platinum blond hair failing forward, and the slight shaking of his shoulders indicated that Draco Malfoy was crying. If the door falling closed behind Harry startled Draco at all, he didn't show it. Instead, without raising his head or standing straight, Draco spoke. "Come to curse me again, Potter?"
"What's up mate?" Ron inquired as Harry come to an abrupt stop.
“I was hoping to consult with him concerning an ongoing investigation. He is not under any suspicious, I’m merely seeking his professional opinion.”

He made his way forward and noticing the security wizard still pointing his wand at Draco, he said. “You might want to lower your wand Harolds. Draco’s not here to cause problems.”
Draco opened one eye to glance at Harry, but closed it again quickly, a small smug smile playing at his mouth. “So let me get this straight—a mad wizard you’ve been unable to catch blows up me and my shop and you’re blaming me? Nice try Potter.”
Even Hermione with all of her knowledge didn't have an answer for Harry. As he continued to pace around the room, the anger he was feeling mere moments ago gave way to despair once more as Harry contemplated the unfairness of life. Despair was slowly overcome by pain as hot tears built up behind Harry's glasses, obscuring Harry's vision and threatening to fall with the blink of an eye.
Deciding on a course of action for breakfast, Draco called softly, “Tilley.”
"Draco," Harry breathed, "Oh, Draco." Lying there in the bed, wrapped up in layers of blankets, was Draco Malfoy, his usually pale complexion impossibly white, his skin clinging to him like melted wax on a candle. He looked frail and worn; not at all like the Malfoy Harry remembered from Hogwarts.
The face Draco wore in public was a mask- an artificial face he had trained himself to wear, and Harry knew this. He also knew that when he and Draco were alone, Draco took that mask off, letting only Harry see what lay underneath.This relationship between them had developed not long after the incident in the bathroom. Their brief yet disastrous meeting had reminded both boys that life is fragile and therefore should not be spent in hatred. And on this evening, as the sun slowly sank over the horizon and the two boys stood locked in their embrace on top of the Astronomy Tower, the fragility of life became once again apparent. Draco let out a deep sigh before opening his eyes and moving his and Harry's hands off his face. Turning his back on Harry, Draco leaned forward, his arms coming to rest on the railing, his eyes slowly moving to look down to where Dumbledore had fallen just mere nights ago. Earlier that day, with the help of polyjuice potion, Draco had attended the funeral of the beloved Headmaster and had waited inside the grounds of the castle so he could meet with Harry—one last time. Draco did not move as he felt Harry come up beside him, assuming the same pose as Draco. Raising his eyes and turning his head so that he was looking at Harry's profile, he spoke in a soft voice.
"But, I thought…but, he was…" Harry did know what he was trying to say—there were so many thoughts swirling around his head he couldn't keep them straight. Finally he blurted out "But Draco doesn't have one night stands. Ever."
Harry remained silent as he watched Draco delicately stir a potion while adding drops of a red syrupy substance. The potion momentarily turned a brilliant pink colour before hardening into what looked like a solid cauldron-shaped brick.
But Draco made no move to push him away, so Harry closed the remaining space between them, and ever so gently brushed his lips across Draco’s in what could hardly be described as a kiss. Draco sighed, and Harry felt as his last bits of reserve melted away.
"Draco, why did you come to my dormitory?" Harry's tone was still apprehensive, though it now also had an edge of anticipation and curiosity to it.
"Draco, I really am sorry," Harry paused as Draco raised his head and opened his eyes, "I didn't want you to get caught in the middle of this. I didn't mean to…"
"Harry, there is another reason I wanted to see you before I died. A reason I could not write in a letter. You probably don't know this but not long after the war, I married a young witch that my parents had selected for me. Astoria was a beautiful women but I never loved her. I married her out of obligation and we spent much of our time fighting and being miserable. The only good thing that came out of our marriage was our son, Scorpius. Astoria did not survive his birth and I have been raising Scorpius since then." Here Draco paused, drawing a deep breath before continuing, "My parents did not accept my refusal to remarry and as a result, I have not seen them since Astoria's funeral. Andromeda has helped when she can but she has Teddy to raise and I did not know who else to ask."
Turning around, Draco took in all the food laid out on the table under a stasis charm to keep it warm and fresh, “No thank you, Tilley. This all looks wonderful.”
“Why were you with her then?” Draco asked quietly, “If you knew you were gay.”
“How bold of her to assume I want you to stay.” Draco spoke up, breaking the tension in the room, and Harry laughed.
Harry let out a short breath, “But how
"Harry…" Draco paused as Harry turned to look at him, "I didn't mean….I never wanted….I couldn't…"
Harry nodded and turned his head to meet Draco’s gaze. “I didn’t expect you to stay.” He said softly.
Harry didn’t respond this time, he eyes already drifting closed again as he fell back into a light sleep, a small smile on his face.
(XXXXX)
Even though he knew Draco was joking, his words caused a new wave of guilt to wash over Harry and settle deep in his chest. And as if he could read Harry’s thoughts, Draco opened both eyes again, and this time, Harry was unable to hide the wetness in his eyes no matter how quickly he tried to blink it away.
“But Auror Potter,” the wizard, Harolds, began but at seeing Harry’s glare, he clamped his mouth closed in a hurry.
Pulling away, Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s and a minute passed before Draco spoke.
The way a single guy does
"I know, I saw you." Harry swallowed hard, "and let me guess—he is doing brilliantly."
"I love you too, Draco Malfoy." And then Harry reached up to pull Draco down in a kiss that not only portrayed the passion they clearly had but also the love they clearly shared.
Ignoring Draco’s comment, Harry continued, “From Eastern Europe—Bulgaria or Romania most likely. He has already shown to be exceedingly comfortable with spell creation and potion making, and he’s been highly resourceful. Previous samples of his work have indicated a willingness to use dark magic,
Grinning, Draco angled himself forward, causing the head of his cock to hit Harry's prostate continually. Harry seemingly forgot how to talk and he saw stars every time Draco hit that spot within him. Knowing that he wasn't going to last too much longer, Draco reached down and grabbed Harry's cock in his own hands, pumping it at a pace that matched the speed at which he was pounding into Harry.
While he waited for Tilley to return, Draco made himself a cup of tea, sighing contentedly as he took his first sip. Wandering over to the table, where the day’s edition of the
When his world finally stopped spinning and the dark spots disappeared from his vision, Harry looked up to find himself standing outside what appeared to be an old family estate in the middle of a rolling field. The morning fog had just lifted and Harry could see droplets of dew still clinging to the lawn as he and the elf Sophie made their way towards the front doors of the home. Walking into the entrance hall, Harry was surprised by whom he saw waiting for him. Andromeda Tonks stood waiting at the foot of a large staircase, her arms crossed and foot tapping as if Harry was running late.
, Draco thought ruefully to himself as he swiftly made his way through the crowd. Breathing a sigh of relief as he reached the outer edge of the atrium space doubling as the dance floor for the night, Draco snagged another glass of champagne as he left, and began to wander through the darkened hallways of the newly completed ward which was the cause of the evening’s celebrations.
Standing there in sitting room, Scorpius held close to him, Harry couldn't help but feel that this was finally what he needed to help him forget the War and he couldn't help but feel that everything was going to be all right. That he was going to be alright.
Harry turned around but he’d barely taken a step towards the door when Draco spoke up.
They shared a heavy look and Ron turned away, beckoning Hermione to follow him. Leaving the restaurant window, she felt a weight settle deep in her stomach, and with a glance at Ron, she knew he felt it too.
The witch re-emerged and beckoned Harry to follow her into the back. He was intrigued when they came to a stop at the foot of a spiral staircase.
The service was beautifully done, with only a small number of people present. After Draco was placed in the large green and silver marble tomb, and the rest of the guests had made their way back to the house, only Harry remained behind to say goodbye by himself.
In the days that followed Harry requested a few personal days, and despite the firm rules governing Auror training, Kingsley granted his request. Harry spent the majority of his time off at Grimmauld Place, hiding from the media and unwanted attention. He had thus far refused to speak publicly about Draco's death, and he continued to openly dismiss rumours that he was relieved by the death of his so-called “second greatest enemy.”
and had been waiting for what felt like forever.
Harry titled his head back, letting it rest against the brick and Draco chased his movements, not wanting to break contact unless absolutely necessary. Harry’s head lolled to the side as Draco shifted his focus to Harry’s neck and jaw, and he groaned again as Draco sucked a mark that Harry knew would leave a bruise. If he still possessed the capacity to worry, he’d be worried about covering up the bruise before the conference. But his ability to care had seemed to disappear as the blood retreated from his brain. Through the fog though, he still managed to recognize his own name being called from the front of the ally.
Not bothering to look and see if the elf had left, Harry walked into the dormitory and sighed, looking around with nostalgia, remembering all of the time he had spent in this room with Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus. He couldn’t help but feel a bit grateful that his four housemates had all been spared in the battle. Setting down his food on his bed side table, Harry shrugged off his jacket, leaving it on the floor has he crawled onto his four-poster, reviling in the softness of the mattress. Rolling onto his back, Harry reached over and picked up a sandwich.
Harry opened both eyes and stared up at his boyfriend incredulously and Draco shrugged. “We both got what we wanted in the end.”
Neither man knew how long they stayed wrapped in each other arms but each was listening to the other. Draco heard the constant beat of Harry's heart and it gave him comfort, while Harry listened in agony as every breath Draco drew was more laboured than the last. At last, Draco raised his head. Using all the energy he had left, Draco brought his lips down on Harry's in a chaste kiss that contained a lifetime of emotion.
“Did it work?” Harry asked, eyes sparkling with mischief.
Somewhere in his now sex-blown mind, Harry registered the fact that Draco was still fully clothed. Reaching down, Harry pulled Draco's face back to his own, allowing Draco to kiss him deeply while Harry undid the buttons of Draco's shirt, roughly pushing the fabric away from Draco's perfect skin. Using his legs, Harry managed to flip Draco so that he was now looking down at the pale perfection that was Draco's chest.
Draco moved to sit on the other chair but stopped when Harry glared at him. Raising his hands again, Draco took a step back and then he started.
Draco responded to this by casting a lubrication spell and pushing himself into Harry until he was buried completely before either he or Harry has the chance to change their minds or think about what they were about to do.
“But he didn’t, and you will.” Draco extended a bandaged hand, “come here.”
Harry waited until he could no longer hear their voices or footsteps before pulling out his wand to deactivate the alarm he was sure they’d placed on the door. Sure enough, the door handle glowed blue for a brief second and with a small click, the door unlocked.
Harry hesitated, recognizing that he’d been dismissed, but after weeks of waking up from dreams filled with soft lips, fiery kisses and roaming hands, he couldn’t simply walk away without at least trying something—anything—to keep the man’s attention for just a few moments longer.
The kiss started softly, tenderly and Harry felt himself being pulled in deeper and deeper, needing the reassurance of feeling Draco respond in equal part. Their pace was slow, lazy but that just made the connection that much more intense, and Harry revelled in every feeling of Draco moving beneath him.
Both boys fell asleep with smiles on their faces.
Nodding noncommittally, Peters kept reading. Harry was grateful because it meant that he didn’t notice the way Harry’s hands shook as he reached for his cloak or the way he had to try twice to turn the doorknob.
I'm going to mark this as complete for now, but I am toying around with idea of writing more to this story. I'd love to hear what you guys have to say about it, and if I should continue.
Shivering against the cold October air—he’d left his cloak in his haste to leave—Draco made it about half way down the drive before he had to stop, the tears coming thick and fast enough to block his vision.  Sinking down, he rested against the trunk of a bare cherry tree, and let the tears continue. He hadn’t seen his father in months. He knew what Lucius thought of his choice in partner. He knew he would never be the ideal Malfoy heir. He knew he was a disappointment. He expected to hear all that when he accepted the invitation to come for tea.
The feeling of Harry clenching around him and the sight of Harry's cum covering his stomach was too much for Draco. He too came; calling out Harry's name has emptied himself in Harry.
Straightening himself, Harry hurried out of the waiting area, following the Healers who had come out of Draco’s room. As it was, they had barely closed the door before Harry was standing in front of them.
“That new potion shop—Abraxous, I believe it’s called.” Peters mentioned offhandedly, flipping through his own pile of reports.
*Flashback*
And then one of them groaned, and the stillness that had settled on them shattered as hands reached out to grab shoulders, and hair, and fistfuls of stiff fabric. Lips gave way to teeth and tongues, and the kiss deepened as both men sought to draw out more pleasure. Breathing seemed like the second most important function keeping them alive, surpassed by the need for the kiss to never end. Eventually though, the need for air could no longer be ignored, and they pulled away from one another.
Draco shrugged, feeling awkward for the first time at his uninvited presence in Harry’s home. “It was late, and I didn’t think you’d mind.” Draco fiddled with his cup, not returning Harry’s gaze.
The two friends lapsed into silence, as Harry studied the man making his way back to their table with fresh drinks in hand. Turning his head, he looking at Neville, his eyes almost pleading for direction, but Neville didn't want to intervene.
“That’s not true,” Draco interrupted, his indignation clear, but Harry ignored him and kept going.
“What I wanted was to make our dinner reservation that I actually made,” Harry grumbled and as if on cue, his stomach gave a low rumble.
Harry woke with a start, eyes popping open, the sensation of falling still fresh in his mind. Pulling his wand out from under his pillow, he cast a Tempus Charm which told him it was 2:49am. Sighing, Harry sat up, reaching over to his bedside table to grab his glasses. Placing them on his nose, Harry slid out of bed, careful not to make enough noise to wake up his bunkmates. Making his way to the garden door, Harry slid it open and walked into the night. The cool air hit Harry's face full force and he shivered involuntarily. Walking to the edge of the balcony, Harry leaned on the railing, looking over the training grounds. His eyes slowly moved upwards, the glittering stars holding his gaze, and he let his mind wander back to a few nights ago.
"Astronomy Tower."
“Having a bad day?”
Harry only moved again when he felt Draco pull back slightly. Meeting his gaze, Harry gave a small smile as he could practically see the internal battle playing out in Draco’s mind.
"Come again." It croaked as the three walked away.
Draco reached down, taking the hands clasped around his waist in his own, loosening their grip so he could turn around and stare into the green eyes he loved so much. "Just thinking" Draco whispered back.
Walking over to the floo, Draco turned to face Harry, “You coming?”
That night was a good night for Harry. He didn't have any dreams to remind him of what he thought his life should have been nor did he have any nightmares to remind him of what his life turned out to be. No, that night sleep comforted Harry like an old friend, forgetting the horrors of war, the pain of loss, and the disappointment of failure.
Harry met his uncertain gaze and walked slowly forward. Leaning in to whisper in Draco’s ear, he described every exquisite detail of how he would take Draco apart, piece by piece until he could do nothing else but beg. Harry watched as Draco’s eyes slipped close, he jaw slacken and he could feel a shiver run down Draco’s spine as if he remembering exactly what it felt like when Harry pushed into him.
“I’m not gay,” Harry took a breath and continued, pre-empting Draco’s protest, “I’m bisexual. I’m attracted to both men and women, I just never told Gin that. It was easier, you know and besides, I never thought it’d be an issue. We were supposed to always be together.”
“I can’t be late Draco,” Harry tried one last time to pull away, but he knew his heart wasn’t really in it and Draco knew it too.
Harry chucked as Draco dropped his suit jacket to the floor and pushed Harry roughly onto the bed. "Impatient, aren't we?" Harry only managed to gasp out as Draco positioned himself on top of Harry, causing their now full blown erections to rub against each other.
Draco stiffened slightly at this last tidbit of information. “Very well Auror Potter,” he said, turning around again to start working, “I will analyze the potion and provide a full written report as soon as I have conclusive findings.”
“Why not Draco?” Harry pleaded, “Surely you felt something that night too.”
“Unfortunately, yes.” Auror Hanson sounded grim. “As soon as it was deemed safe, crews went in and found Mr. Abraxous upstairs in the remains of what appeared to be his lab. As the shop was closed to the public today, his assistant was mercifully not present. Mr. Abraxous was transported immediately to St. Mungo's.”
Shaking his head, Harry knew it was likely pointless to push the issue and so he turned towards the stairs, mentally calling Draco every kind of prat, idiot and git there was.
Sensing food, Harry raised his head, “Is that bacon?” His voice was thick with sleep still, but he was more awake than earlier.
A look of resolved passed over Hermione’s face and she stood up, reaching for a quill and some parchment.
Harry thought to himself as he made his way to the transportation hub,
Harry’s grip tightened on his wand now in his hand, “Why should I let you? Merlin knows you don’t deserve it.”
dark magic. If you find any trances, you’re to alert the Auror office at once.”
Harry made a non-committal noise and thanked the wizard. Turning, Harry was debating what to do next-he could visit the canteen since he was going to likely miss lunch- when a familiar blonde walked slowly passed the window.
Just like that, he was gone and Draco was alone.
“Do I need to remind you Mr. Malfoy, that loitering is a public offense?”
Draco was momentarily taken aback at the venom in Ron’s voice—they’d been getting along better lately but he recovered quickly and said, “Is Harry with you guys? He not home and we had dinner plans.”
“That’s not what I meant, Harry and you know it.”
“I mean, he doesn’t want to fucking see you,” Ron repeated slowly, “He knows, alright? The game is up so do yourself a favour and never come near him again.”
Harry stifled a yawn and looked at his watch. He was dismayed to see only ten minutes had passed. Merlin, he hated waiting. Especially when he was waiting in the portkey travel office. Especially when he was travelling to the world’s most boring security procedure conference. If he wasn’t the main speaker, he wouldn’t be going at all, but Head Auror Robards made it clear he didn’t have a choice but to accept the invitation when it was offered. Walking up to the service desk, Harry cleared his throat and waited for the wizard sitting behind the desk to look at him.
Leaving Draco alone to ponder her last words, Luna got up and walked over the where Neville was still sitting with the Sword of Gryffindor clutched in his hands. Draco watched her go, rolling her words around in his head. Was it possible that he had come to care for Harry? Draco had always been drawn to Potter but he had always identified that feeling as loathing. But now that Draco thought about it, he could see the logic in Luna's statement. Deciding that he needed to take a walk to clear his head, and also recognizing that it was only a matter of time before somebody else noticed his presence, Draco got up and headed towards the Entrance Hall.
They were almost at the end of the Alley when Hermione broke the silence, “What do we do?”
“And risk losing my parents permanently. Be reasonable, they’re my family.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut against the tears as the door to his father’s study slammed behind him. Wrapping his arms protectively around himself, he blindly walked towards the entrance hall. His feet instinctively taking him where he wanted to go. When he finally reached the front door, he paused. Listening for any trace of footsteps following him and when he heard none, he took the final step out the door of the Manor. He didn’t let himself think about the fact that it might be his last time allowed into his childhood home.
Harry nodded his thanks and made his way over to the lift, clenching his fists to keep his hands from shaking too badly as he waited for the lift to arrive.
A retort about Draco’s constant ego briefly entered Harry’s mind but he decided to indulge Draco instead, which seemed the more expediate way to what he wanted.
“Don’t get short with me,” Hermione said mildly. She didn’t say anything else and Draco squirmed a bit under her intense gaze.
Harry made an exasperated noise. “Look Draco. I can see that something is bothering you but if you don’t want to talk about it or tell me right now, I’m going to go join the lads. We made a big arrest today and we’re gong to have a few drinks to celebrate.”
Harry forced himself to take a deep breath, shoving down the panic building inside his chest. He took another shaky breath, “Yeah, I just have a bit of a headache,” he said, “Actually, I think I’m going to go get something from medical.”
“No,” Draco answered, “but you’ll have to convince why I am letting you stay.”
Once he had finished his sandwiches and licked the plate clean of treacle tart crumbs, Harry sighed contently, closed the curtains on his four-poster, and waited for sleep to come to him.
“Sorry Draco,” Harry said as he leapt up to collect the jars he’d knocked over. Turning slightly, he deliberately bent over slowly, making sure Draco got the best view of his ass, which he knew looked spectacular in this pair of jeans.
"I'm sorry Harry. I'm so sorry." She sighed in his ear while rubbing circles in his back. Harry straightened up, breaking the hug with Andromeda.
Draco flinched at Harry’s tone which had effectively crushed any hope Draco might have felt.
Draco shrugged, this time deeply absorbed by a piece of lint on his trousers.
The Phoenix Ward for Long-term Trauma and Rehabilitation, St. Mungo’s newest addition, would open its doors to patients tomorrow. It was a project three years in the making and was to serve both as a tribute to the victims of the War and as a place where survivors could go for support and recovery. In light of the Ward’s purpose, Draco wasn’t really sure what he was doing at its opening night, so to speak.
creative list. Apparently intending to start his on his list immediately, Miguel reached for Harry belt, but Harry grabbed his wrists before he could get anywhere.
"Draco, I don't care if it hurts and I don't want you to prepare me with your finger. I want your cock in me now!"
"I know you didn't mean to hurt me Draco but you don't need to protect me. You especially don't need to protect me from you; it's my heart and I knew what was at stake." Harry let go of Draco's arm, but Draco stayed rooted in his spot.
But what he hadn’t anticipated was the pure loathing in Lucius’ voice. The anger when he said that if Draco wasn’t going to act like a Malfoy, he should stop using the Malfoy name cut Draco deeper than he expected. But what had hurt even more was that his mother has just sat there, looking at her hands. Not saying anything, not defending her own son. She’d lied to the Dark Lord to protect him but defying Lucius was something she wouldn’t allow herself to do. She never harbored the same hatred of Draco’s defiance as Lucius, but Draco knew she relied on Lucius and couldn’t contradict him. And thinking of Narcissa, sitting quietly in the corner sent another round of shudders through Draco.
“I don’t mind,” Harry nudged him with an elbow, “But I wasn’t talking about last night.”Draco glanced up, and raised an eyebrow, not understanding Harry’s meaning.
Draco closed his eyes again and moaned, accepting that he was definitely not making it to breakfast on time.
“Yeah, uh”— Harry stuttered as he reached into his robe pocket and pulled out his Auror ID. Showing it to the witch, he watched as her eyes widened— “I was wondering if I might speak to Master Abraxous.” Harry continued, repocketing his ID.
In some small part of his mind, Harry thought they should probably stop before Draco’s monitoring sensor brought the Healers running, not to mention how many protocols he was breaking, but Harry pushed those thoughts out. Whatever Draco’s tongue was doing was far too important to not give it his full attention.
Finally, when he could no longer feel his fingers and his chest hurt with the force of trying to take his next breath, Draco stood and considered his options. Obviously, he was going to get off Malfoy property, but he also didn’t really want to go back to his empty flat. Glancing at his watch, he hadn’t realized how late it had gotten. And that made up his mind. Walking out of reach of the Malfoy wards, he didn’t let himself take a glance back as he apparated to Gimmauld Place.
Harry stayed there with Draco wrapped in his arms until he had no tears left. Slowly and reluctantly, he detangled himself and stood up unaware of how stiff he had gotten lying there. Before turning to leave, Harry tucked the blankets under Draco's chin and straightened the long, white blond hair so that it looked like Draco could be asleep. Wiping his eyes once more, Harry left the room and headed back down the staircase towards the large sitting room he had noticed when he entered the home.
(XXXXX)
Draco checked the mantle clock one more time and made up his mind. Standing, he walked to the floo and throwing some powder into the fireplace, called out “Auror Headquarters” before stepping through the emerald flames. Arriving at the Auror transportation hub, Draco was about to head towards Harry’s office when some called out.
Draco was in a foul mood when he stumbled out of the floo into Harry’s perpetually messy kitchen, swearing under his breath as he tripped over the fire poker left lying on the hearth.  Not only was he starving because the restaurant his parents had picked had pitiful portion sizes, he was still seething over the argument he and his father had left unfinished.
Getting up and pacing around the room, Harry continued, "you read some of those letters the Auror Department intercepted, letters promising to cause him pain for corrupting me. And I'm sure you both remember the crazy people now locked away who tried to kill him because he wasn't good enough for the 'Chosen One'. God, how could I be in a relationship with him knowing that our relationship was putting him in danger?"
“I love you too.” He blurted out.
Standing quickly, Harry cursed as his foot caught on the edge of a coffee table which held a few heavily abused copies of
"I love you, Harry Potter." Draco murmured, receiving the shock of his life when Harry's eyes burst open. Draco had fully expected to be pushed out of bed and told to leave immediately, or he at least expected Harry to ask him to repeat what he said. But what happened next was something that Draco hadn't expected ever.
Draco nodded and Harry gave a lopsided grin. “Great!” Leaning in, he brushed his lips over Draco’s forehead, “I’ll wait for your owl then.” And with that, he turned towards the stairs, a noticeable bounce in his step.
Knowing what his friend was most likely thinking, Neville quickly added, "I know you are very capable Harry, but Miguel, while being brilliant, likes to live a fast past life—in all areas of his life." Still sensing confusion from Harry, Neville continued, "Look, I haven't heard from Miguel in a number of years but the last time I met up with him, the combination of alcohol and other substances he consumed should have been lethal."
“Right,” Harry snarled, “you’re the innocent victim here.”
“Just making polite conversation Potter. Why are you being so secretive?”
Harry rolled his eyes and ran a hand through his hair, “If it was nothing, you wouldn’t have run away.”
No way, not me
Leaning over, Draco placed slow, easy kisses the shell of Harry’s ear. And just as he reached Harry’s jaw, he noticed eye lids beginning to flutter open. Moving away a bit, Draco watched as Harry rolled onto his back, staring blearily up at him.
And with that, Harry turned away and slowly made his way back to the house with the knowledge that love was indeed stronger than death.
“Whatever,” Harry muttered, and went to sit on a nearby bench, ignoring Draco’s hand.
“You’re the main speaker. They can’t start without you.” And pressing his advantage he added, “Besides, we won’t take long.”
“You didn’t know it was a date.” Hermione finished, “Oh Draco, I’m sorry. When we saw you, you looked like you were enjoying yourself. We never thought you hadn’t planned it.”
“You’re not even an Auror, how could you be his partner?” The wizard moved even closer, adding “take your hands out of your pockets, slowly and I better not see a wand.”
“Draco?” he asked, still blinking blearily.
It's easy going out on a Friday night
Pausing what he was doing, Draco still didn’t turn around, but Harry watched as he shifted uncomfortably on his stool.
~XXXXX~
Indeed, the words and feelings they were conveying through their kiss were so important that neither noticed when the door suddenly opened.
"I know." Harry cut in, laughing slightly at the look of earnest confusion on Draco's face. "I know you didn't want to kill Dumbledore, I know you didn't intend for everything to be this way, and I know you had no choice. You were just protecting your family, right?" Draco swallowed hard and nodded before Harry continued. "You don't need to apologise for protecting those you love, Draco."
~XXXXX~
When Draco didn’t move, Harry spoke again. “Have you gone deaf? I said leave.”
“Shouldn’t you be inside with the Weaslette, dancing horribly and making the hospital more money by wooing wealthy donors Potter?” Draco watched the rise and fall of Harry’s shoulders, still smirking as the other man turned around to face him, his breath catching in his chest as it always did when he met the Potter’s intense gaze.
Harry exhaled shakily, clearly not convinced, “I don’t know Malfoy. I mean, I fucked up bad and she didn’t want to be with somebody like me. She deserves to be with someone who knows what they want. Not a fuck up. That’s what Ron said when he found out. He said I was confused, and that if I sorted myself out, maybe in a couple years she might give me another chance and that Ginny did the right thing by leaving cause I didn’t deserve her.” Harry’s breathing was coming in heavy pants now and he looked at Draco, eyes bright and a little unfocused.
Harry was pulled from his thoughts and memories by a loud hooting noise overhead. Looking up, Harry watched as a large brown owl circled before landing on the railing not far from where Harry stood. The owl hooted softly again, and raised its leg in Harry's direction, indicated that Harry was to take the note tied there. Harry walked over, wonder who would be sending him post at this time, and thinking that it was a good thing he was outside otherwise his bunkmates would have been horribly angry with him. Harry untied the scroll and watched as the owl flew off into the night once more.Looking down at the scroll in his hands, Harry untied the ribbon holding it together and unrolled the parchment. He recognised the elegant scrawl immediately, and a small grin to cross his face before he even read what the note said. His grin, however, disappeared as he read the note in his hands. Harry could almost hear Draco's voice as he read the note.
Harry nodded, “Yes ma’am.” Making a deliberate effort to not run, Harry turned and started heading back to the Leaky Cauldron.
"I can't Hermione," Harry pulled his hand away from hers, the despair he’d been feeling since leaving the club causing him to lash out angrily. Harry continued, cutting off both Ron and Hermione's attempts to speak. "You know why I can't talk to him, why I can't get back together with him."
“Well then, you’re both fucking idiots—no, you are.” He insisted, noticing Harry’s look of hurt and protest. “You should have told her. You should never hide who you are from the person you love. Though, a one-night stand with a muggle, seriously? That was monumentally stupid.” Draco’s voice softened before continuing, “But she just gave up. Without asking questions, without listening to your side, she simply decided you and your relationship weren’t worth it. Maybe that was stupid of her, I don’t really know, but it’s definitely disappointing.”
Harry rolled his eyes. In fact, he had made a reservation, but Draco wouldn’t believe him even if he said so and besides, that wasn’t the point. The point was that he was
Draco made to interject but Harry just raised his voice louder, “What is so bloody unreasonable about being pissed off at the fact the man I love was on a date with somebody else?”
“I was blindsided. And it didn’t mean anything. You have to know that.” Draco stopped, watching Harry as he processed this, anxiety weighing heavy in his chest as he willed Harry to understand and believe him.
I'm not afraid of movin' on
“Harry.”
“Don’t say a word Potter, I need to concentrate.”
Hermione looked closely at him and was surprising to see he looked ready to cry. She couldn’t keep the confusion out of her voice when she spoke next, “But you had a date Friday night. We-Ron and I- saw you.” As soon as she said these words, Draco paled and gripped his sides tighter. “That’s why Harry is ignoring you.” Hermione finished belatedly.
Harry was so effectively lost himself in thoughts about Draco that when his dance partner turned around and started placing kisses up Harry's throat, Harry jumped a little in surprise.
"Hogwarts—base of the…" Ron's voice died away as Harry cut in.
Clearing his throat, Harry waited for the two Healers to look up from the parchment they were reading before he spoke. “Are you the medi-team treating—” Harry paused, unsure on what to call Draco—“the victim from the fire in Diagon Alley?” He recovered. “I’m from the DMLE,” he added quickly, reaching for his identification again.
"He doesn't have a new boyfriend mate." Ron was looking at Harry with an mixed expression of confusion and pity.
he mentally added, taking another appreciative sip of said good champagne.
After a lengthy pause, Harry started speaking again, "Draco, I'm not coming…" but this time, it was Draco's turn to interrupt.
In the end, he did follow her advice. Leaving the lab, he notified his assistant that he’d be unavailable for the remainder of the day and went home. Showering, he put on fresh clothes, though he couldn’t quite bring himself to eat anything, just the thought made him queasy.
“That’s what you always say,” Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry continued tracing his finger up Draco’s arm, and when he got to Draco’s chin, he tilted it upwards slightly so he could see Draco’s profile more clearly. He continued, dropping his voice even lower.
When he was done, Harry leaned back and waved his hand, moving the tray to a nightstand.
Draco snuggled his cheek closer into Harry's palm, reviling in its softness and warmth. Harry just stared down at Draco, still wondering what twist of fate had brought him to this moment. When Draco spoke again, there was a different edge in his voice; one of authority and power that were only slightly masked by the pain.
“Nonsense. I don’t know to what you are referring to.”
“Oi, who are you?”
"Four days ago I was miserable Draco. I never thought I would have a purpose outside of being the Chosen One but now, thanks to you, I have a new purpose, a new role to fulfill in life." Harry paused, drawing a deep breath and exhaling before he continued, "You can rest now Draco. Scorpius will be fine, and so will I. I promise you. I love you Draco."
“Listen to me, whatever Weasley-Ron—” he corrected— “told you is utter crap. You’re not sick or confused, and you’re not in a phase. You said it yourself, you’re bisexual, or queer, or whatever you want to call it, and there is nothing wrong with that. Just like there would be nothing wrong with you being gay or straight.
Reaching out, Harry took one of Draco's hands in his own and Harry moved his other hand to smooth Draco's cheek. "Shhh. It's okay Draco. You don't have to explain yourself. Your letter was more than enough explanation for me. We both have faced difficult decisions, and you acted with incredible bravery." Harry let his voice fade away, not knowing what else to say to the man lying before him.
. Stopping outside of it, Draco took a deep breath and then pushed it open.
"So this is goodbye then?" Harry asked as he turned back to towards the railing.
“Hurry up, Draco” Harry pleaded, “we’re going to miss our reservation.”
Harry watched with interest as Draco's eyes dilated and a moment later, all of his thoughts were scattered as Draco kissed him with such fervor that all it took all of Harry's will power not to moan into the kiss. Instead, Harry allowed Draco's tongue to enter his mouth as he wrapped his arms tightly around the blonde's waist, pulling him closer so that their bodies were flush against each other and the electricity between them was almost tangible.
"Where did they find him?" Harry asked quietly, not needing to elaborate any further.
"Draco, I can't say I'm sorry for defeating Voldemort," Harry paused as Draco cringed at hearing Voldemort's name, "but," Harry continued, "I am sorry for the rest. It was never my intention to cause you pain. Merlin Draco, I thought about you every night when I was on the run. I wondered all the time where you were, what you were doing. Every night I hoped that you stayed safe. I wanted you to be near me so much it hurt, but in my efforts to make sure we could be together, I hurt you so much more than I could realise. I'm sorry, I just…" Harry let his voice die as he saw a change in Draco's demeanour. He had finally lost control and tears were once again sliding slowly down Draco's face.
Kiss 8: Quick Goodbye—October 2003
We broke up
Harry turned and raised an expectant eyebrow.
At Harry’s last words, Draco turned around, his jaw set.
"Who are you?" asked Harry, lowering his wand.
Ron’s face was grim but his jaw firm, “We have to tell him.”
Looking unblinkingly into Harry's eyes, everything suddenly clicked for Draco, and his eyes dilated with realization. Luna had been correct: he loved Harry Potter. Electing not to speak, Draco instead leaned forward closing the distance between him and Harry and captured Potter's lips in kiss searing with passion.
Green eyes then met grey ones, and both knew it was time. Whatever they had had, whatever dream and love they once shared, was gone, changed and made impossible by war and circumstances. In that knowledge, Draco step forward, placed a single chaste kiss on Harry's forehead before whispering "Goodbye Harry", and before Harry could answer, Draco had left.
“Shame on me then, for wasting such an opportunity.” Harry moved to straddle Draco’s hips, running his hands under Draco’s t-shirt and up his chest.
“Very good,” Healer Morin said, “We will be in contact Auror Potter.” Together, the two Healers made their way down the hall and out of sight.
“Mr. Abraxous normally does not meet with clientele. All professional communications are written and delivered through his staff,” the witch replied, “but I’ll see if he is willing to make an exception. May I ask what this is in reference to?”
Sure enough, it was nearly noon when Draco strolled out of the fire into the living room at the Manor. He immediately noticed his mother sitting in her favourite reading chair a little ways away. Walking over, he leaned over and gave her a kiss on the cheek.
“I’m here for Harry of course.”
Auror Hanson turned to leave and Healer Banks gave them a long stare. “Auror Potter, I will permit you to stay but no strenuous activities. Mr. Malfoy needs rest.” And then, she too left, closing the behind her.
"How do you know I feel like I don't belong?" Even though Draco was pretty sure what Luna was going to say, he couldn't help but ask.
Finally, Harry broke his silence, stopping as he did so, “Why are you here Draco?” He sounded tired rather than angry, much to Draco’s disappointment.
Schooling his features into what he hopped was a neutral, professional expression, Harry walked out of the lift and towards the small waiting area at the end of the hall. If he happened to note exactly what room Draco was in, that was just a side effect of his Auror training.
"I'm not going to tell you what to do Harry, you got to figure this one out on your own mate, but just so you're aware, and I don't know if this is still the case, the last I heard from Miguel, he had a fiancé." With that, Neville turned and walked away leaving Harry to decide what to do.
“May I help you?” The reception wizard looked over at him.
“You’re a bloody coward, you know that Malfoy?” And ignoring Draco’s murmured
Harry raised his eyes from the report he was editing and glanced across at his desk mate, an eccentric Auror name Tim Peters who reminded Harry of  Luna. Harry shook his head, “What happened. Do we know?” He asked.
“Fine.”  He let out a huff. “Why are you here Granger?”
Draco let out a shaky breath, and when he spoke, his voice was horse and tired sounding. "Harry, I don't want,- I know you, -I don't blame you Harry, though it's so easy to. I can really only blame myself. After all, it was my choice—my choice, my heart, my life, my own fault, not yours…" Draco paused, letting out another breath and wiping away some tears. "All those months, I was like a prisoner in my own home. I thought about you, about how you were living on the run, and I was envious. The danger you faced was so abstract compared to having him there all the time; the fear, the danger was so tangible, I hated feeling like a coward. I hate that I still feel like a coward. On those nights I couldn't, or wouldn't sleep, I would think of our time in Hogwarts, it kept me going. I missed you so much."
“Fuck.” he murmured under his breath. He just kept staring, taking in the glass that still littered the street and the colourful liquids running slowly down the steps. Harry didn’t know how long he stood there but the sound of a smaller explosion broke his reverie and propelled him further.
Harry laughed at Draco's confusion and weak tone. "You idiot. I've loved you since last year on the Astronomy Tower, when you couldn't kill Dumbledore. I was there, under my cloak and paralyzed by Dumbledore. I saw and heard the whole thing. Ever since them, I've known that I loved you. Don't ask me why, but I do. And, based on the sex we just had, I am very happy about it too."
"Thank you Kreacher," replied Harry, taking the food from the elf, "you served with honor today. Master Regulus would be very proud." At Harry's words, Kreacher shook with silent tears, and Harry walked passed him, adding "You may go now Kreacher."
“You don’t know what you’re talking about Potter,” he spat, “I know exactly what I deserve and it’s definitely not you.”
“That’s what you think,” Draco said with a filthy grin and a wink, as he entered the green flames. Harry practically ran to follow.
"Hey Hermione, you planning on asking him questions all night?" Grinning at Hermione as she glared up at him, Harry turned and extended his hand to Miguel, "Sorry about her, she likes to talk. I'm Har…"
"Harry, Scorpius means the world to me. He gave me a reason to live, to keep fighting. You are everything a parent should be Harry. You're understanding, smart, kind, brave: everything I want Scorpius to grow up to be. What I am trying to say is that if I named you as Scorpius' godfather, would you raise him for me?"
“Anyways,” Harry continued, “we should both be getting back to the party.”
Draco smiled as he felt strong arms reach around his waist and a head come to rest on his shoulder. He felt shivers run down his spine as a voice whispered in his ear.
"Oh, um, nothing…nothing", Harry replied offhandedly, "You go on ahead. I'll meet you back at the training centre." Harry continued to stare down the corridor, while Ron silently considered things for a moment before shrugging and walking away, muttering under his breath as he went.
Hey, I'm doing just fine
“Well, he’s not here, so you can leave now.”
“Not possible,” Draco actually laughed, “They wrote the definition of straight with you in mind.”
"That was amazing." Harry breathed, wrapping his arms around Draco, who kissed the area above Harry's heart in agreement.
Harry clenched his jaw, “Fine, explain but be quick about it.”
“Shame indeed.” Draco licked his lips as he watched Harry move in closer, his hands moving to grip Harry’s hips.
Draco’s eyes blinked open and he was momentarily disoriented by the unfamiliar room around him. It took him a second to remember where he was and why he was there, and slowly, a smile found its way onto his face, and it kept growing until he was sure he looked ridiculous.
Draco blinked stupidly at Ron, not in the mood to deal with this. “What do you mean? Is he okay?” Draco could see Ron shaking in anger and his confusion grew.
"My love, I'll be waiting for you at the end, but please take your time arriving here."
Draco choked slightly on the tea he’d just sipped and willed the blush he felt creeping up his neck to go away.
“Ginny left me,” Harry said flatly, and it was Draco’s turn to stop.
“What do you want Malfoy?”
Looking at the Fat Lady, Draco asked in a shaking voice "Um, er…would you mind if…if I went in?"
Miguel, once again misinterpreting Harry's reaction, purred in Harry's ear "Ticklish, eh Harry?" and promptly went back to sucking Harry's neck. Harry, on his part, just made a non-committal grunt, not really sure what else to do or say. He hadn't been so close to another man since his breakup with Draco, and it was seriously throwing him for a loop—it felt so wrong, like he was betraying Draco, but it felt so good at the same time. Just as Harry was getting ready to push the man away for some space, Miguel found his weakness—the soft spot behind his ear—and began sucking on the place with such fervor that all thoughts were pushed from Harry's brain, and his mind and body focused solely on the present.
Smiling, Harry made his way to the door but stopped just short and watched as Draco sauntered past. If he didn’t know any better, he’d suggest that Draco was dawdling but Malfoys didn’t dawdle. Stepping out into the street, Harry spoke.
It was Hermione who broke her silence next. "I spoke with Draco tonight."
The venom in Harry’s voice and his obvious movement to retrieve his want from the table jolted Draco’s attention back to the reason he’d come. Raising his hands to show Harry he wasn’t going to fight, he looked directly into Harry’s face. “Can I explain, please?” Even to his own ears, he sounded desperate.
The witch nodded and Harry watched as she disappeared into the back, and for the first time, he took the opportunity to look around Draco’s shop. It was small but neatly organised, and even from a distance, Harry could tell that the potions and special ingredients on display were of exceptional quality.
Harry blinked rapidly a few times, grateful that Draco’s eyes were still closed so he didn’t see the slightly watery smile Harry wore when he spoke, “You were the prat that didn’t notice an altered exploding potion in the package you opened.”
Harry stopped the ministration he had been giving Draco's neck and moved it instead to his earlobe so that he could nibble on it as he whispered huskily in Draco's ear.
Finally, Harry spoke up. “How about we start with dinner?” He proposed, and noticing Draco’s nervous glance, added, “not anywhere public, obviously. You can come to mine. Why don’t you send me an owl when you’re done with that potion—you can come over and we can talk about your findings. Would that be okay?” He said, chewing his bottom lip.
“Hey Draco, I have a question” he didn’t wait for a response, “did you get to skip the lesson on the stupefy charm since you’re such a natural stunner?”
“Was that good?” Draco asked bemusedly.
"Bring this to Harry Potter, he'll be at the Auror training centre" Draco instructed the owl as he tied the parchment to the owl's leg. Draco stroke the bird's head once before it took off, flying into the inky darkness of night. Draco watched until the owl had disappeared from sight, carrying a message that only Harry would understand—a message that Harry had to understand.
Stopping in front of the mantel, Harry looked up and saw a picture from his birthday last year. Draco, with an arm around his waist, was giving him a kiss on the cheek as he held out his wrist, proudly displaying the bracelet that was Draco's present to him. Reaching into his pocket, Harry pulled the bracelet out, and brought it to his lips, his shoulders shaking as tears fell down his face.
“Is there anything else Tilley can do for Master Draco?” The elf asked.
When Draco opened his eyes, he found that night had fallen. He listened for a moment for the sound of students heading to the Astronomy Tower for a late night lesson, but it seemed that classes had ended in preparation of end of year exams. Draco closed his eyes again, thinking of his own years at school—hurrying to finish homework late Sunday night, quidditch games on Saturdays, trash talking the Hufflepuffs—so many good memories marred by the horrors of 6th year. Though 6th year had given him Harry for a brief time, it has also caused him to ultimately lose Harry and so much more that he loved. It was 6th year that had ultimately led him to this night, to the decisions he had made, to the actions he was about to take. Draco opened his eyes yet again, setting his jaw with a certain determination. Reaching into his cloak, Draco pulled out a small roll of parchment. He turned to the owl that had been quietly perched on the railing.
“Good.” Harry leaned in and brushed a kiss on Draco’s lips. And even though it was brief, Draco felt warmth flow through his chest for the first time since he’d left the Manor, but all to soon, it was gone as Harry pulled away, brushing past him as he walked to the floo.
Harry sat in shocked silence, trying to understand everything he had just read. Somebody loved him, somebody he knew. Scanning the letter again, Harry made a few mental notes about who could have possibly written this letter. It was obviously someone in his year at Hogwarts and was not in Gryffindor, the person was in the Great Hall when Voldemort was killed but did not fight with the Order. The list in Harry's mind was getting precariously short. He was so deep in thought that when he heard the loud crack indicating somebody apparated into his flat, he let out a little yell, grabbing his wand to point at the intruder. When no one appeared in his doorway, Harry got up and headed towards the place where the sound originated, moving slowly with his wand at the ready. Arriving in his living room, Harry was surprised to see a small house elf looking shaking nervously.
Sitting in the silence, Harry thought over the emotion roller coaster the night had turned out to be. Contentment from being with his friends turned into lust and desire for a complete stranger, which was replaced by anger and self-deprecation, which finally subsided to leave a deep rooted despaired. Despair over his inability to choose his own life, make his own decisions, to be with who he loved.
So here he was, Monday morning, at work, miserable and still slightly hung-over as even his strongest potion hadn’t managed to get ride of all his symptoms.
Harry added mentally.
Kiss 2: Hesitant—September 2002
"I love you Harry." Draco whispered so softly Harry almost missed it. With that said, Draco's eyes closed for the last time and Harry felt Draco's skin go cold next to his own.
“Harry?” He called out as he set down the bag of take-out on the table. “Harry?”  Draco wandered through the empty halls of Grimmauld Place, becoming more concerned as Harry remained noticeably absent. Returning to the kitchen, Draco grabbed some floo powder and called out for Ron and Hermione’s flat, poking his head into the fire and waiting for one of them to answer.
“What modifications are you making?” Harry peered at the ingredients on the table, interested.
Whatever Harry was expecting, it wasn’t that and Draco watched, somewhat relieved, as confusion washed over Harry’s face, almost fully erasing the rage that’d been there only moments before.
"Thanks Ron." Harry's voice was quiet. Ron only nodded in reply.
Draco paused, turning slightly and taking a minute to actually look at the man standing opposite. He was a bit surprised to see just how dishevelled and tired Potter looked. Brushing away the inconvenient feeling of almost sympathy welling up in his chest, Draco gave a small smile, “Honestly, unlike most of the people in that room, you actually have a personality.” As an afterthought, he added, “And I was bored.”
"You bastard", Harry all but snarled at the other man, and bring his knee up, he drove it into the man's shoulder, knocking him backwards on the asphalt. Stepping gingerly over the man, Harry made his way back towards the club, completely ignoring the other man's protests.
Draco Malfoy was still sitting alone in the Great Hall. Not long after the Dark Lord fell, his parents had apparated back to Malfoy Manor, but Draco refused to go with them. Hogwarts was really the only place he ever felt at home and despite being alone, there was no other place Draco would rather be.
Harry pouted and lapsed into his silent watching. Draco turned back to his equations with a focus that Harry found both highly inspiring and annoying. Not to be deterred however, Harry waited until it was clear Draco was fully immersed in his work before carefully and slowly moving his arm across the table, knocking over several jars of dry ingredients and causing one to crash to the floor.
Draco paid no attention. Instead he was focusing his attention on Harry's neck, alternating between biting and licking the sensitive skin there. Reaching to his back pocket, Draco pulled out the wand he had borrowed from his mother and silently vanished Harry's shirt. If Harry was impressed at this piece of magic, he didn't say so. All he could do was let out a little yelp has Draco brushed a hand over one of his sensitive nipples. Enjoying the sounds he was eliciting from Harry, Draco moved down slowly, tracing his tongue over Harry's skin until he reached his chest and nipples. Taking one of them between his teeth, Draco bit down lightly while teasing with the other between his fingers.
Arriving back at the floo connection, Harry was grateful the area was deserted as he stepped into the green flame.
Harry didn't know what to say. There were so many things he could say, so many things he wanted to say. He wanted to tell Draco not to go, that he couldn't leave him alone, that he wasn't a coward. He didn't want to promise those things to Draco in hopes that not promising would keep Draco here longer, but in the end, looking into Draco's eyes so full of pain and pleading, Harry promised. He promised to keep on going, to keep on loving, to keep on living. He promised because he still loved Draco, and Harry told him that. He told Draco that he was still in love with him, and he would always love him, no matter what. For the first time in that evening, Draco smiled his old warm smile, though his eyes still displayed the pain he felt as he told Harry that he too was still in love, and that no one would have replace Harry in Draco's heart.
The hostility that Harry heard in Draco's voice startled him slightly, though he took it all in stride, passing it off as part of the façade Draco had always put forward. Instead, looking into Draco's icy grey eyes, rimmed with red, Harry reached a hand out and traced tear tracks running down his pale cheeks with a single finger. Harry's hand came to rest again on Draco's shoulder. A little smile crossed Harry's face as Draco cricked his neck to nestle his face against Harry's hand. Standing there with his hand nestled between Draco's cheek and shoulder, Harry thought of the war. In the past year, he had dealt with the grief and pain of loss, and the emptiness and uncertainty of the future, but he had moved on. It dawned on Harry, standing there, that he never considered the loss of the other side. They too had lost friends and family; they had been robbed of hopes and beliefs however twisted or ill-founded they had been. Harry realised that when he killed Voldemort, he simultaneously destroyed some people's whole world and he could see that pain and loss reflected in Draco's eyes, and it was obvious that Draco had not moved on. That realisation settled over Harry as he was reminded of the weight of responsibility he thought he had outgrown. Harry let a few moments pass before he spoke.
Harry’s eyes flashed and he sat up a bit straighter, “So it’s okay to disrespect me, our relationship, that way. So long as I didn’t know?”
Draco turned to watch, and he was just about to ask Harry to come back. Ready to admit defeat to the tears in his eyes and lump in his throat when Harry said, “I’ll see you at home Draco.”
"Goodbye" Harry finished, and Draco nodded. Draco slowly let his hands slide down Harry's arms, making their way from his shoulders down to his hands. Taking Harry's hands gently in his own, Draco squeezed them and then he turned to leave but Harry's voice stopped him before he walked too far."Don't I get one last kiss goodbye?"
Seeing Ron enter the room, Draco started to speak but he was cut off.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Not at the reception. I mean, why are you here with me?”
Draco's skin felt like it was on fire. Everywhere Harry touched burned with passion. Struggling to form coherent thoughts, Draco managed to gasp out "So Harry, ahhh…..what kind of "backing up" did…..you…. have in mind?"
Turning to look at Draco, he asked, “what are you doing here Draco?”
Harry shook his head in frustration. He knew in his heart that he had said goodbye to Draco for the last time, but his head insisted on arguing—not accepting the truth that was staring him in the face. Harry whirled around, suddenly startled by the sound of a door opening and feet shuffling.
"I, um, I just wanted…oh, never mind." Draco suddenly turned on his heel and started walking out of the dormitory before Harry had a chance to process anything.
Four days after Draco's death, Harry stood in the same bedroom in which Draco had died. He looked in the mirror, straightening his tie and flattening his hair before he turned and walked out of the room. Meeting Ron and Hermione in the entrance hall, Harry took Scorpius from Hermione and the three friends headed towards the large willow tree that over looked the pond on the estate. This was where Draco was to be buried shortly and tomorrow, Harry would be moving into the house so that Scorpius could grow up in a place that his father had loved.
“Lunch at 10:30?” Harry raised an eyebrow.
“You could have left.” Harry yelled back.
Draco looked up and met her gaze briefly before looking away again. “My parents,” he took a breath to steady himself, “They don’t care that I’m gay. I mean, they don’t think it matters. It doesn’t stop me from getting married and producing an heir. Love or attraction don’t enter the equation for them, it’s an expectation they have of me.”
“What can I do for you Auror Potter?” He asked politely if a bit stiffly.
“I am an important Private Donor, Potter.”
Both boys fell silent, turning to watch the sun sink out of view, signalling twilight's arrival. When Draco spoke next, it was in a barely audible whisper, "But I couldn't protect you. I tried so hard, but I couldn't protect you from myself." Draco started to turn away, but Harry caught him by his upper arm, forcing Draco around so that they were facing each other yet again.
Out on the dance floor, Harry knew the minute Draco's eyes settled on him. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, and he shivered. Draco's eyes had always had that effect on him. His dance partner apparently misinterpreted his shiver, as he purred "you like that do you?" in Harry's ear as he continued to grind up against Harry in time to the music.
“Um, yes.” Harry stumbled, “I’m looking for the burn victim brought in from Diagon Alley.” He flashed his Auror badge, “I’m from the DMLE.”
Draco could see the rage building in Harry’s face and knew he had to get out what he wanted to say before Harry recovered enough to act. Even a kiss a harsh as that had left them both a bit dazed.
Harry cleared his throat, “Thank you—for listening, and for those things you said,” He said awkwardly.
Harry smiled and leaned in so that his and Draco's foreheads rested against each other's. Reaching up, Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair; his hands coming to rest at the base of Draco's neck while his thumbs gently stroked his jaw line. "Thinking about what?" Harry asked still smiling.
*End Flashback*
“I brought him back to mine. Gin walked out of the floo, and we were on the couch, his dick in my mouth.”
"Harry? What's wrong? Why are you out here?" Ron stood in the doorway facing Harry, his eyes half open, still blurry with sleep.
"It's nothing Ron," Harry sighed, "let's go back to bed. I was just…thinking about something." And with a last glance at the night sky, Harry went back inside and crawled into his bunk knowing in his heart that tomorrow would bring grim news.
"I know. I overheard you talking to Granger and Weasley earlier this evening. I was hiding below. I know you're not coming back to Hogwarts, I know Dumbledore set some kind of mission for you to complete. I know you Harry, and I know you want me to come, to go into hiding with you, to run away from it all, but I can't. I can't leave my family to pay for my actions. I know what the Dark Lord would do to them, and I could not live with myself knowing that I was the cause…." Draco let his voice fade away into the growing darkness.
Hermione rolled her eyes and sat on a nearby stool, “That’s not what I meant you know it.” When Draco didn’t respond, she added, “He’s in pain, Draco.”
Harry turned his back on Draco and resumed his slow walk, and Draco watched him for a few seconds, admiring the admittedly spectacular fit of Harry’s dress robes before deciding to follow him. Between Potter and his waiting dance partners, Potter was preferable. Taking a few long strides to catch up, Draco fell into step next to Harry, opting once again try and get a rise out of the clearly subdued man next to him.
“Healer Banks notified me when you sneaked into Mr. Malfoy’s room.” She gave Harry a stern look, “We will discuss your role in this investigation later, but for now, I believe Healer Banks and I should leave you boys alone. Clearly, the sensor alarm was not caused by medical reasons.”
Rolling over, Draco carefully extracted himself from the blankets, stretching as he looked around the floor for clothing which had been hastily discarded the previous night. Pulling on his boxers, Draco grabbed a t-shirt off the floor, and grinned to himself as he recognized Harry’s scent as he pulled it over his head.
“Draco?” He kept his voice soft, and he watched hopefully as eyelids fluttered opened and registered Harry standing there.
“Wait.”
"I know exactly who you are Mr. Potter" Miguel smiled, and grasped Harry's hand with both of his. "It's an honour to meet you; Neville told me so much about you."
Draco shrugged again, still not making eye contact and mumbled something.
was already waiting, Draco idly read a few articles, through none really held his attention. He startled a bit when Tilley reappeared, cursing slightly as he knocked his tea over.
“Right,” Draco snorted but didn’t bother looking up from the complicated equation he was working on, “I’d believe you but I’m pretty sure you’ve never made a reservation in your life.”
Images of last night played back in his memory. Green eyes filled with lust, mused black hair that Draco couldn’t seem to stop tugging, teeth and tongues exploring and marking. If he closed his eyes and concentrated, Draco was pretty sure he could still feel Harry’ hands on his hips as they rode out their pleasure together.
Grasping Harry’s hand with one of his own, Draco used the other to undo Harry’s bowtie and top button of his dress robes. “Look at me Harry,” he instructed, “take a couple of deep slow breathes.”
Turning to walk away, Draco slipped his hands into his pockets, clenching them in hopes of retaining some control until he got out of sight.
"I love you Draco" Harry's voice went directly to Draco's heart, shattering what was left of his resolve. And despite feeling his heart strings slowly give way, Draco kept walking. Across the lower platform, down the spiral staircase, along the corridors and down the marble staircase and through the great front doors—the same root they used to escape after Dumbledore's death. Only this time, once outside the gates of the school, instead of disapparating, Draco stopped. Turning to face the school and sinking to the ground, Draco found himself whispering "I love you too Harry" before succumbing to the well of pain that had built up in his chest.
Harry resolutely refused to allow Draco’s probing tongue entry, but his control slipped as Draco reached a hand down to cup his growing erection.
Draco smiled weakly at Harry, motioning him to come closer. Still in shock, Harry obliged, moving forward and sitting gingerly on the edge of Draco's bed, trying not to disturb the bed too much. Neither man spoke, only stared into the eyes of the other. Harry's mind was racing, thinking back to the letter he had read only hours before. Did Malfoy really mean what he had written? Had he really loved Harry since fourth year? One look into Draco's eyes silenced all of Harry's questions. Yes, Draco really loved him.
Opening the window just enough to let a large eagle owl in, Harry immediately noticed that the letter it was carrying in his beak wasn't from the Ministry nor from Ron and Hermione, as they were usually Harry's only sources of mail. Intrigued, Harry took the envelope while absentmindedly giving the owl a few treats from the jar he kept on his dresser. The envelope, however, held no clues as to who sent the letter, and Harry wracked his brains trying to figure out who else would send him mail as he walked back to his bed.
Draco’s smile grew as he watched Harry war between being upset over being woken up so early and pleased to see Draco still there.
"No he doesn't." Ron countered, "I ran in Parkinson in the club. She told me Draco was in a right bad place and that she was going to fix him up with one of her friends later tonight. That must be who you saw with Draco."
Both men were silent for a few moments, contemplating the strange truce that had settled between them before Draco broke the silence.
Harry shook his head, “She said she didn’t want to waste any more of her time,” Harry sighed again and replaced his glasses, “Can’t really blame her from walking away from a queer, golden boy or not.”
“Why are you so curious Malfoy?”
Turning around, he saw a young security wizard with his wand out. Draco hunched his shoulders and pushed his hands into his pockets. “I’m here to see Har—I mean, Auror Potter.”
Hermione nodded, and reaching out, took Ron’s hand as the pair apparated away to Grimmauld Place and an unpleasant conversation.
Accepting Harry's somewhat of an explanation, Draco laid back down. "What are we going to do when everybody finds out?" He asked, realizing rather quickly that most wouldn't take too kindly to the Chosen One and the son of a Death Eater loving each other.
Following his gaze, Auror Hanson spoke, “It isn’t pretty is it?” Without waiting for an answer, she continued, “Anyways, I wanted to talk to you because I know you’ve been working with the owner on that international case. A connection between that case and this seems probable given the extent of the damage and early evidence suggests the fire wasn’t accidental. Any theories?”
"Hey everybody" Neville raised his voice to get the attention of his friends in the general area, "this is Miguel. He was one of my guides when I was studying in Brazil. He's also a herbologist and he is here doing some research."
"What happened to Miguel Harry?"
Miles away, at the Auror training centre, Harry was falling, racing faster and faster towards the bottom. The weight of darkness closing in on him, his mind going blank as he resigned himself to a permanent end. Knowing that the end was coming near, Harry closed his eyes and waited…
The two lay like that for a while and as Harry's breath slowed and deepened, Draco thought that Harry had fallen asleep. Muttering a cleaning spell, Draco moved so that he could look down at Harry's face.
yeah, it's tough
Draco could see the light of recognition grow in his eyes and he braced himself for what he knew was coming.
“Why didn’t you leave?” Harry asked, face unreadable.
He took another breath and loosened the grip on his sides slightly. “Recently, they’ve come to realize I wasn’t going to follow their instructions or meet that expectation. We had a big argument over it, and I thought I convinced them. When they invited me out to dinner, well I never thought—I didn’t know—” His voice trailed off and he looked at Hermione, his eyes pleading with her to understand.
It was silent for a few moments, and then Draco said in a soft voice, “We do better. That is, if you still want…” Draco’s left the words unspoken but he knew that Harry caught their meaning anyways.
Finally, Harry nodded, and Draco let out a breath he did realize he was holding.
Not coming up with any ideas, Harry flopped back down and opened the envelope, careful not to rip the front where his name was scrawled elegantly in midnight blue ink. Putting the envelope down, Harry turned the multiple pieces thick parchment over only to see blank pages staring back at him. Harry looked around for his wand before he realized he had left it in his cloak last night. Sighing, Harry put the letter down and went to retrieve his wand before returning to the comfort of his bed. Taping the letter with his wand, the same midnight blue ink and elegant scrawl that was on the envelope filled the pages before him. He began to read:
"Oh, that was quite easy to figure out, actually. Your family has long been the second in command to Voldemort. Your father was imprisoned because of his loyalty and you almost killed Dumbledore to prove you belonged in the ranks of Voldemort. Yet, you refused to identify Harry when he was brought to you not long ago, and when the fight broke out here, you refused to fight for Voldemort. So even though you have changed, or thought about changing your loyalties, you feel that it is too late and that you would be unwelcome among those gathered here because of your past." Luna concluded, letting  her voice die away so Draco could think about the things she said.
Narcissa laughed as her son turned bright red despite his best efforts. “I do want to meet this person Draco.”
As Miguel’s tongue worked its way up his neck, Harry looked around the alley, spotting another man in the corner, who watching them with interest. The presence of this stranger caused Neville's previous warning to flood to mind, and Harry tried to push the shorter man away but Miguel wasn't going to be easily moved. Moving his hands under Harry's t-shirt, Miguel ran his hands over Harry's abs as he went back to Harry's weak spot, murmuring in Harry's ear all the things he wanted to do to Harry and it was a
“Oh my!”
Andromeda was sitting on one of the couches and when Harry entered, she took one look at his face and rose to her feet. Walking quickly over, she gave him one of her rare hugs, holding him tight as Harry broke down once more.
Making his way up to portrait hole, Harry wondered how he would get into the common room without a password but he decided not to worry about that. If the gargoyle guarding the Headmaster's office was any indication, he was sure the Fat Lady wouldn't have a problem letting him in. And sure enough, his suspicions were confirmed as he approached the portrait hole, the Fat Lady greeted him with a smile and swung wide open, telling Harry to go on up to the dormitory.
"Where is Scorpius?" he asked in a shaking voice. Andromeda inclined her head towards the second couch, where Sophie the house elf sat with a little boy who was a spitting image of Draco. Trembling, Harry walked forward and picked up the boy, holding him close in a hug that transferred all the love he had for Draco into a new love for Scorius.
To say that Draco had a bad weekend would be an understatement. He woke on Saturday morning uncomfortable from sleeping in his clothes, hung over from finishing almost the whole bottle of wine, and miserable from finding the bed empty and cold.
“We both fucked up. I should’ve asked you about the date. You should’ve stood up for me to your parents.” Harry replaced his glasses, “but we can’t change any of that, so the question is what do we do now?”
"We always took a unique approach to each other." Draco said with a little laugh, then he paused, looking straight into Harry's eyes, his face suddenly grave looking and deadly serious, "Harry, I have to leave. I don't know where I'll go, or how I'll get out, but I have to. I can't stay here. I can't continue living like this…" Harry tried to interrupt, but Draco ignored him and continued, "It's not your fault, like I said previously. In this case, it really is nobody's fault, it's just the reality of the situation—the result of unforeseeable and uncontrollable circumstances. I don't want to, but I have to…" Draco hesitated and Harry took his opportunity to speak up.
Opening his eyes again, Draco moved closer to Harry. Propping himself up on one arm, Draco slowly began pealing away the blankets that were tucked tight up under Harry’s chin, smiling as Harry tried to burrow deeper into his pillow even as Draco pulled the blankets away.
Harry groaned and let his head fall forward onto Draco’s shoulder, “I really hate you sometimes.”
It was Harry's turn to wipe away tears that were slowly falling. "We've done a brilliant job making a mess, haven't we?" He said with a shaky laugh.
"Let me come with you Draco. We'll escape together, forget my training, forget your family name, and forget history and the war. We'll get out together, start a new life. We can do it—together." Harry's voice sounded eager, even to his own ears, and the brief glimmer of hope that he felt had disappeared even before Draco shook his head.
Draco dropped his quill, and ink splots began spreading across his careful calculations, “Damn it, Harry,” Draco cursed, looking over at his boyfriend with a glare.
Pausing briefly, Harry considered his next move and even though subtly and seduction weren’t his usually go-to’s, he decided to give it a shot. He moved slightly so that he was behind Draco, “I’m just returning the favour, it seems fair that since you’re so good at distracting me, I should get a shot.” He kept his voice light, but he could see Draco sit up a bit straighter and shiver slightly as he felt Harry’s breath on his neck.
Harry felt some of the colour drain from his face and he swallowed thickly. The sound of his heart was so loud in his ears that he almost missed the next words.
Draco whipped around and narrowed his eyes as Hermione picked up the book and walked over, placing it down on his worktable.
Hermione shook her head, “I don’t think so.”
Harry slid his glasses on and blinked at Draco, smiling, “Merry Christmas Draco.” Leaning forward, Harry pressed a kiss onto Draco’s cheek as he reached around him to grab another piece of bacon.
“Time to wake up Potter.” He said in a sing-song voice, taking a bite of the bacon he was holding.
“Modified his memory, called a cab and sent him on his way. He thinks we had a splendid evening that ended in mutual pleasure,” Harry sighed, “By the time he was gone, Ginny had locked the wards around our room, and she left the next morning.”
Harry waited tensely to hear any sound indicating who else was in the room but he heard none. No footsteps, no creaking bed frames, not even the sound of a house elf cleaning up his dishes. Just complete silence. Finally, Harry got tired of waiting and sat up, slowly drawing the curtains back on his bed, his wand pointing in the direction of the door, ready to curse the first thing that moved. But when Harry finally opened his curtain all the way, he was greeted by an exhausted and confused Draco Malfoy staring at him.
“I don’t know what you want from me Harry.” Draco finally broke his silence.
“I am!” Draco’s frustration exploded, “What should I have done Harry?” He yelled.
“Okay,” Draco countered, “Tell me what you did to prompt her to dump you.”
"Yeah", Ron nodded slightly in confirmation, "How?"
Thanks for reading!
“I’m not sure that is wise, Auror Potter.” Draco didn’t even turn to look at him.
~XXXXX~
Draco turned around to see Harry still standing there, his face shining with new tears that had started to fall, and a small grin playing at the corners of his mouth, remembering the last time he had said those same words. Draco stood rooted in place, and Harry could see he was contemplating what to do—trying to decide if physical contact would make this goodbye unbearably hard.
“Very well Master Draco,” the elf bowed, and then added, “Master Lucius bade Tilley to remind Master Draco that he is expected at the Manor shortly.”
“I didn’t catch that.” Harry said impatiently, glancing at the floo over Draco’s shoulder.
“Still observant as ever Potter.” Draco’s smile morphed into another smirk and Harry once again resumed his pacing. “So,” Draco continued, “if not by your side, where is the Weaslette?”
"Because I love you." And with that, Harry shifted Draco over in the bed and moved to snuggle next him. Wrapping his arms around Draco's waist, Harry pulled the frail man close, moving one hand to stroke Draco's hair as Draco's head come to rest on Harry's broad chest.
It was a rare night off for the Aurors-in-training, and Harry and Ron has chosen to spend it at Hogwarts visiting Hermione and Ginny, who had both elected to finish their studies properly. Their visit, in reality, had ended up with Ron and Harry playing exploding snaps while the girls reviewed for their upcoming NEWTs. Nevertheless, the night had ended pleasantly, with the girls eventually giving up on revisions, and joining Ron and Harry in the armchairs by the fireplace. It was close to midnight before Harry and Ron left the common room, laughing and bidding the girls a goodnight. They leisurely made their way to the Headmistress' office as McGonagall had agreed to let them use her Floo connection. Walking through the empty corridors caused a wave of nostalgia to hit Harry, and he let those memories course through him until he was drawn from his thoughts by a lone figure down a side corridor.
Draco spent the next two days trying every method of magical communication he could think of to no avail. He’d lost count of how many fire messages, owls and even patronuses he’d sent only to have them returned, unopened, each one causing his spirits to drop lower and lower until deciding drinking to oblivion would be less painful.
Hermione raised an eyebrow, and Draco wrapped his arms protectively around his middle as he went on. “I came home Friday-we’d planned to have take-out and play chess, but he was gone. And Weasley wouldn’t let me see him.” Draco took a shuddering breath, “He ignored me all weekend and the wards have locked me out.”
Draco nodded, and turning back to his potions table, began pulling various instruments towards him. “Is there any other information you can tell me about the potion or its creator?” He asked.
"You." Breathed Draco as he moved his hands to rest on top of Harry's that were still cupping his face. Draco let he his eyes fall shut, and Harry was left studying a face that only he got to see.
They stood looking at each other for a few minutes longer before Draco spoke again. "I should go Harry…which means that this is…"
Draco nodded, and Harry let out a breath before moving slowing, careful of where he put his other hand.
“There wasn’t any trace of human DNA that they could identify,” Harry admitted, “It’s one of the questions we’d hoped you could answer for us.”
The Seventh Year dormitory was a large circular room, with five poster beds around the perimeter. Posters of various quidditch teams and even a few Muggle football teams lined the walls. Draco looked around with interest until his eyes came to rest on the only bed with its curtains drawn. Not sure of what to do next, Draco just stood staring at the red curtains surrounding the bed in which Harry Potter was sleeping.
“I don’t believe for one second you left because that kiss meant nothing. If it really meant nothing, if you didn’t feel anything, you would have stayed and made fun of me for being shit at snogging, or something equally stupid.” Harry paused, waiting for Draco to do or say something, but when he didn’t, Harry kept on going. "I think you ran away because the kiss meant more than you ever expected-it scared you. And all those things you said about finding someone who is deserving, you might want to try believing it yourself. After all these years, you still think of yourself as a Death Eater who only deserves punishment, and it’s utter bullshit.”
Having Draco's hand on his cock seem to unlock Harry's voice again and he picked up his constant mantra of "Oh god Draco" until he felt a white heat explode in his groin. Letting out a yell of "I'm gonna cum, Draco", Harry let himself go to the pure ecstasy he was feeling.
By the time Draco opened his eyes, Harry had begun retreating but he suddenly felt himself being jerked roughly by the elbow and pulled into the narrow alley between the portkey office and the shop next door.  He just has time to register the took of utter want on Draco’s face before he found himself being pushed against the wall and snogged quite thoroughly.
“Nothing,” Harry said innocently, hiding his grin as Draco gave him a skeptical look.
As Draco pushed into him, Harry felt like he was being split open from the inside. A burning pain spread up his spine, and he let out a yell of pain. Draco watched pain flicker across Harry's face as he let Harry get accustom to the feeling of having Draco in him.
“He doesn’t want to see you Malfoy.” Ron snarled.
“You heard me Malfoy,” Harry ground out.
Sensing that Draco was close, Harry gave one last long suck on his cock before releasing it from his mouth with a loud pop. Draco looked down at Harry, completely frustrated that Harry had chosen that moment to stop. Moving up to steal a kiss, Harry leaned into Draco, grinding their hips together as he whispered in a throaty voice into Draco's ear.
“Is everything okay?”
Throwing his head back at the added pressure, Harry let out a muffled groan, before looking back at the other man and shaking his head firmly—it wasn't going to happen.
When Miguel grabbed Harry's hand and led him towards a back booth, Harry let him. And arriving at set booth, Harry just barely noticed Draco looking at him from the bar where he sat with Hermione. An Auror to the bone, Harry made note to ask Hermione about it later, but any further speculations and observations were wiped clean as Miguel pulled Harry down into his lap, and went back to exploring the depths of Harry's mouth.
Reaching out to pull Draco in even tighter, Harry spread his feet, groaning when Draco’s thigh slotted into place between his legs. Content now to just let Draco lead, he let his senses be overcome by the onslaught of Draco’s smell, his touch, his taste.
Draco tried to look nonchalant, but he failed as that was another thing Malfoys did not do. “I thought I would take a lunchtime walk to the new bakery at the end of Alley.”
“Actually, I’ll require a full report on your past interactions with Mr. Abraxous, as well as a brief on the case.” She sighed, “It’s probably the best lead we’ve got.”
Auror Hanson pursed her lips, “I asked if you had any insight to share regarding the case you were consulting on with Mr. Abraxous.”
"Draco, please, I need you inside me."
"Have you ever been taken by another man Harry" Draco asked, meeting Harry's eyes in a blazing stare. Harry shook his head no and Draco grimaced in spite of himself. That meant that he was going to have to be gentle; the one thing he felt incapable of being right now.
Raising his head, Harry met Draco’s bright gaze, “No, I don’t.” He agreed, and finally giving in, he wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. “Hold on tight.” He instructed.
"Kreacher though Master might like some food. Master fought bravely. Kreacher is proud to serve the noble house of Black." The elf croaked and he handed Harry the plate and goblet.
~XXXXX~
“Is this a new questioning procedure I am unaware of, Auror Potter?” Auror Hanson asked recovering first, and Harry felt himself go red.
Pulling away just enough so he could see Draco’s face, Harry prepared for some sort of violent reaction, but it never came. Draco just leaned in, his forehead resting against Harry’s. Not in a rush and content to just enjoy the other man’s closeness, Harry closed his eyes, absentmindedly he moved hand to the nap of Draco’s neck, and ran his fingers through the short hair there.
Harry cried until he had no more tears left, and when he couldn't cry any longer, he just sat there, knowing that for the time being he was safe. That being here with his friends to support him was the easy part and that in the morning when he had to get up and face the realities of another day without the man he loved, and that sure as hell wasn't going to be easy.
Harry made a noise of agreement and opened one eye to glance at Draco. “You can go ahead and finish your work now. I’ll wait here.”
~XXXXX~
Accepting a cup of tea from Ron, Harry didn't say anything but watched as they each took a seat, and  waited for one of them to ask the first question. It was Ron who spoke first, his voice gentle—a tone he generally reserved for victim interviews or hospital visits.
“Tap into your inner Gryffindor and I’m sure you’ll figure it out.” She said with a smile as she turned to head back to the stairs.
Harry stayed in bed longer than intended the next morning but he was more tired than he thought after his late night. When he finally had gotten up and dressed in his training robes, Harry made his way to the common room and dining area where his fellow trainees were already eating breakfast.
To The End
he?” He pressed, “How extensive are his injuries? Will he recover?”
Wonderin' where they went wrong
Finally, out of pure need for oxygen, they broke apart, gasping for breath and staring intensely into the other's eyes. Running his tongue over he swollen lips, Draco looked down.
“This floo connection is for Aurors only.” The wizard said, walking closer. “Hang on. I know who you are.”
“This morning.” Harry continued, “when you woke me up, I thought you were going to head to the Manor.”
But Draco heard none of it. All he heard was the pounding of blood in his ears and the phrase
“I love you too. And you’re right—you deserve more loyalty from me.” Draco shrugged and ran a hand through his hair, “I guess I’ll be going now. See you around Harry.” Turning, Draco made his way to the door.
Peering up at Harry, the other man pouted. "Ah, come on babe, I know you want it." And as if to prove his point, he moved one hand to cup Harry's erection.
Consulting the board in front of him, the wizard replied, “Room 416, fourth floor. They are still receiving care, but you can wait in the reception area outside of the ward.”
Harry nodded and ascended, emerging in what appeared to be a brightly lit potions lab. Noticing a hunched body and blonde hair in one of the corners, Harry made his way over but before he could speak—
Moving in even closer, Harry reached a hand over Draco’s shoulder and began tracing the back of Draco’s hand. “To start,” his voice low, “your hands. They’re so delicate, graceful and precise when you grip a quill or measure a potion. But when I look at them, all I can think about is the way your hands feel when you touch me.”
Silence met his question, and then— “I didn’t know my private work was pertinent to your official investigation Auror Potter.”
Ignoring Harry's protests, the shorter man pressed forward and dropped to his knees, nuzzling his face into Harry's hip. "Please Harry? I can feel how ready you are for me. No one will ever know. I'm heading back to Portugal tomorrow to join my family, you will never see me again. Promise."
Taking a sip of his drink, Harry watched with interest as Neville approached the group, having gone to get another drink, only he didn't return alone. Neville was making easy conversation with a man Harry didn't know, but wouldn't be opposed to meeting based on his outward appearance. Just shorter than Neville, the man was clearly not from England—if Harry had to guess, he would guess Spanish. Turns out he wasn't too far off.
do to Draco at that moment.
~XXXXX~
Harry smile in spite of himself and rather than responding, pushed back in, capturing Draco’s smile in another kiss.
Seeing that the other man knew he wasn't joking, Harry returned to the club and made his way back to where a few of his friends were still gathered. Pointedly ignoring their questions, Harry just stood there, his arms crossed in front of him defensively, mentally cursing himself for being such a bloody moron.
Draco thought,
“You’re right. I would hate to have to arrest you for loitering and public indecency at the same time.” Harry took a step backward, “If you have no other business here, you’d best be on your way Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco was bored, and he knew he was doing a poor job at hiding it. He dutifully twirled his dance partner one more time and quickly detached himself as soon as the song came to its drawn-out conclusion. Giving his partner a small bow, Draco hurried away before she could catch his eye or hand to engage him in another long and tedious waltz. It wasn’t that Draco minded dancing, it was actually preferable to the alternative of making small talk with the other attendees at the benefit, but that woman had the same level of personality as wet paint.
Absentmindedly moving towards the door, Harry wondered if Draco would actually agree to see him. They hadn’t seen each other since the night of the charity ball a couple of week ago, and since then Harry had to admit he’d been more distracted than usual.
Harry laughed, he couldn't help himself, but it was a cold laugh born more out of pain than humor. "Hermione, the only parts of him that are going to be hurting tonight are those parts of his anatomy he needs to have sex." Taking in the confused expressions of his friends, Harry got the distinct impression he was missing something. "Oh come on, you talked to Draco and he didn't brag about his new beau to you? I find that hard to believe."
Ron chuckled, “I believe you were just dismissed Harolds,” and as the wizard scampered away, Ron shot a look at Harry and Draco, “Listen mate, why don‘t we head to the pub and you meet us in a few when you’re done here, yeah?”
“Okay,” Harry said in an equally soft voice, “We do better.” Harry tilted his chin up and Draco didn’t need to be asked twice.
"Harry, this is going to hurt a bit. I'm going to cast a lubrication spell and I'll start with a finger, but if you want me to stop at any point, just…." But he never got a chance to finish because Harry cut in.
“Draco?” She prompted.
“And I’m always right.” Draco looked please with himself as he gave Harry’s dick a squeeze. “Don’t tell me the prospect of security protocol has got you this excited.”
Harry felt his cheeks go warm and cleared his throat, “Of course, my apologies Mr. Malfoy.” Pulling a small vial from his robe pocket, he continued, “I was hoping that you could take a look at this potion. I know it’s a modified Polyjuice potion and other potions masters I’ve consulted were able to identify several of the modifications. However, they were unable to determine the purpose behind the modifications—” Harry hesitated but then added— “they all recommended that I consult you.”
“Draco.”
Harry knew what Ron was asking, and he took a moment to look down and collect his thoughts before looking up and answering Ron's question. "I just knew. I could feel it." Harry paused, swallowing thickly, before adding, "He said goodbye."
Glancing over at Harry, Draco raised an eyebrow, “What are you doing?”
Draining the rest of his drink, Harry walked around the table he was leaning on and made his way towards the man, deciding it was time to rescue him from Hermione before she talked the man's ear off.
Moving in close again, Draco whispered “Merry Christmas Harry,” as he pressed another short kiss to the edge of Harry’s mouth. Harry made to respond, but before he had the chance, Draco cut him of, “Go back to sleep. It’s still early.”
Done shouting, Harry turned away, clearly unable to keep looking at Draco and resumed his pacing, muttering under his breath about all the things he like to
. Squaring his shoulders, Draco said simply, “Because you’re a good man who has always tried to give everyone a chance, even if they’re an ex-Death Eater who definitely didn’t deserve one.” Draco paused, and pressing the advantage he sensed developing at his words, he added, “If you still want me to leave after, I will. You have my word.”
The elf appeared suddenly and bowed low when she saw Draco. “Yes, Master Draco?” Tilley asked.
“Oh dear.”
Reaching up, Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair, moving it off his forehead and away from Harry’s eyes, which were only half-open, lazily watching Draco above him.
“What are you going to do Auror Potter? Arrest me?” Draco smirked and Harry smiled.
Harry didn’t rise to the bait, “Ginny’s not here and even if she was, I doubt she’d care who I spent my time with.”
"Auror training making you soft? Or is the "Savior of the World" trying to find some clever way to rid the world of his second greatest enemy?"
Pushing himself up against Harry, Draco tangled his hands through Harry's mass of dark hair, pushing Harry back so that he was pressed between Draco and the stone wall behind him. Harry moaned loudly at the sudden pressure change of having Draco pressed into him and he moved his tongue to trace Draco's jawline.
Using his thumbs to wipe the tears off Harry's cheeks, Draco pulled Harry close again and breathed in the scent that was distinctly Harry before he closed his eyes and closed the distance between them. The kiss lasted only a few seconds but conveyed enough emotions for a lifetime and as they pulled away from each other, Draco felts his chest tighten and his heart stings give a painful tug. Opening his eyes and looking directly into Harry's, Draco could see that much like his own heart, Harry's heart was also breaking. Letting his hands fall away, and re-clenching his hands into fists, Draco turned and started down the stairs.
Suddenly, facing Harry under the harsh lights of the Ministry, Draco felt himself shrinking back, recalling the feeling the smallness Lucius made him feel mere hours ago. Not looking at Harry but instead at a point over his shoulder, Draco shrugged, “I just wanted to see you I guess.”
"Oh god, Draco, you're beautiful." Harry gasped as he lowered his mouth to trail hot kisses all over Draco's chest and abdomen. Draco was writhing beneath Harry's ministration, unable to formulate a real answer to Harry's observation outside of a gasping moan.
“One day, mother. One day.” Draco smiled back, thinking for the first time that he might want the same thing.
Collapsing out of the sheer power of his orgasm, Draco laid on top of Harry, while both attempted to regain their breath and organize their brains back to regular functioning levels. When he could finally breathe at a normal pace, Draco lifted himself off of Harry and pulled his cock out of Harry, who moaned at the loss and emptiness he now felt. Snuggling beside Harry, Draco stole a brief kiss before his head came to rest on Harry's chest.
Tilley was busy placed two enormous platters full of all sorts of food down on the table, so Draco used his wand to clean up his spilt tea and got up to refill the kettle.
Laughing again, Draco stood up and offered his hand to Harry, “Well come on then,” he said, pulling him up, “Since we missed our reservation, I guess we’ll have to find something else for you to eat.”
“Before you ask, no I will not tell you what Potter wanted, and I want you to hold all incoming communications for the rest of the day. No interruptions.” Draco said as he heard footsteps and someone walking towards him.
Draco acknowledged the elf with a smile, “Good morning Tilley. Would you be able to bring some breakfast here? It does not need to be a full breakfast, just a few things will do.”
“Hmm?—oh yeah. I’m pretty sure that’s what they said. Are you okay Harry? You’re rather pale.”
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Truthfully, Harry had seen Draco two days ago when they’d had dinner at a little place in Muggle London, but Hanson didn’t need to know that.
Harry started to reply to the elf before he was cut off by the elf grabbing his hand and leading him towards his room. "Please, Harry Potter sir, we don't have much time. Master is very sick, very sick indeed. We need to get you dressed before Master…" The elf couldn't continue as she was overcome with tears. Harry sensed the urgency in her voice and continued into him room, picking up a pair of jeans a t-shirt on his way to the bathroom.
“And what, pray tell, makes me so distracting?”
“How is he?”
“What was the location?” Harry asked, his eyes going back to his paperwork.
“So do I,” Draco said dejectedly.
“Any update on when the next round of portkeys will be ready?” Harry asked.
"I'm sorry Harry." Draco's voice was hushed but he did not speak with frailty or weakness Harry expected of someone who was dying.
“I just need to know if he’ll be okay.” Harry exhaled, shoulders sagging a bit at the look on the Healers’ faces.
Making his way out of the bedroom, Draco meandered towards the kitchen. Opening the fridge, he starred at the dismal selection of food, and decided quickly that nothing there was fit for consumption. Pondering his options, Draco looked through the unfamiliar kitchen trying to find a kettle. Locating one that appeared to have never been used, Draco filled its and set it on the stove to boil. Hopefully, Harry would have proper tea if nothing else. Draco was pleased to find some tea leaves and a strainer sitting in a cupboard next to a collection of mismatched mugs.
Draco closed his eyes and took a breath before opening them again to say, “No, I don’t want to kill him. I’m his partner.”
“Ma’am, I can—” Harry started, scratching at the back of his neck but she interrupted him.
“Both.” Harry replied, chewing his lip as the two Healers exchanged another look.
Putting a hand out to stabilise himself as relief washed through him, Harry looked at the Healers, “Can I see him?” He managed to get out.
Taking one look at her friend, Hermione knew Harry’s night hadn’t improved since she and Ron left the club. Motioning for Harry to come in, Hermione called for Ron to put the kettle on, knowing that his was going to be a late night. Harry, knowing this house as well as he knew his own, made his way into the lounge and took a seat on one of the couches, and while he waited for Ron and Hermione to join him.
“Damn it,” Draco signed and with a wave of his wand, the material disappeared from the cauldron. He turned to face Harry.
~XXXXX~
Slowly, he made his way to the drawing room, and paused to take a deep breath before walking in. Harry was facing away from him, curled in his favour armchair, an empty glass next to him and what appeared to be a photo album open on his lap.
Kiss 5: Distracting—February 2003
Keeping his touches light, Harry kept moving his finger across Draco’s jaw and up around the shell of his ear, “Finally,” Harry was practically whispering now, “when you’re anticipating something, your eyes burn whatever you’re looking at. I felt it last night when I was getting you ready to take me.”
"Draco, wait!" Harry's called after him in a broken voice that told Draco immediately that Harry was crying. Turning around again, Draco watched as Harry half walked, half ran to where he was by the stairs leading to the lower platform. When he reached Draco, Harry hesitated for only a second before wrapping his arms around Draco's waist and burying his face in the side of Draco's neck. Exhaling slowly, Draco removed his hands from his pockets and moved one around Harry's shoulder, the other to the base of neck, holding him close and not caring about the tears stains Harry would leave on his suit jacket. Eventually, Draco moved both his hands to run them through Harry's untamed black hair. Pulling away from Draco's neck, Harry smiled weakly up at Draco and said in a voice hoarse from crying, "Don't I get one last goodbye kiss?"
Harry’s eyes widened and he swallowed thickly, “You sure?” he struggled to get out.
Harry stayed at Draco's grave running his fingers over Draco's name until the sun started to set and grass around him grew dewy in the grey of twilight. Raising his right hand, touched his fingers to his lips, and then placed them gently over Draco's name in a silent show of love. Harry then stood up, and with one last quietly whisper goodbye, he walked away knowing that when his time came and he arrived at the end, nothing would make him leave Draco's side ever again.
Tilting Draco’s head back so it rested against his chest, Harry pressed a simple kiss to the tip of Draco’s ear.
The waiting room was empty. Settling himself in one of the hard chairs that faced the door, Harry tried to focus on his breathing.
“Merry Christmas, mother. I apologize for missing breakfast this morning.” He said as he took a chair opposite her and poured himself a cup of tea from the pot sitting on the tea table.
Tilley bowed, “Certainly Master Draco,” she squeaked and before Draco could add anything, she had disapparated.
Approaching the safety barrier put up by the DMLE and Aurors, Harry was just about to reach for his badge when someone called his name.
“Hypothetically, if I wanted a reminder…” Draco's voice trailed off as he bit the corner of his lip.
In two short strides, he reached harry and walked straight into Harry’s open arms. He didn’t let go for a very long time.
Harry gave a hard laugh, “I’m being ridiculous? You’re the one who went on a date, and when you got caught, turned up here expecting me to act like it’s no big deal cause you were tricked.”
“What the fuck are you---mgh”
Harry nodded his assent.
Draco paused, looking at Harry whose thoughts were swirling. Draco had been married? Draco had a son? Harry could hear his own heartbeat, erratic and quick in his chest. He has a feeling he knew what Draco was about to ask him but he had no clue how he was going to respond.
Rolling his eyes, Draco ignored Harry’s obvious display and focused instead on erasing the ink blots from his parchment.
Healer Banks’ face softened as she turned to look at Harry again, “You know the true identity of the patient?”
What followed was an uncomfortable silence for Draco and a perfectly normal pause in conversation for Luna, as she had gotten used to prolonged pauses. Finally, Draco worked through what she had said enough to ask a question.
Pointing his wand at Harry’s glasses, Draco summoned them and handed them to Harry who was sitting up, rubbing a hand over his eyes.
Draco put his father out of his mind as he set to putting together a tray of food to bring up to Harry. Adding two freshly made cups of tea, Draco made his way back to the bedroom, pausing only slightly to appreciate the view of Harry stretched across the bed, his face pressed into Draco’s pillow.
Draco thought for a moment before answering. “I am attempting to modify a blood replenishing potion to better suit the needs of one of my clients. It is proving more difficult than anticipated.” He added with a grimace.
“As you can tell, I find you very distracting.” Harry said, his voice now normal as he moved away from Draco’s back, not bothering to hide his erection.
But what she, what she don't know
“Can I kiss you?”
Dropping his cuffs, Draco squirmed a bit, freeing his arms enough to return Harry’s hug. After a second, they puled away, looking everywhere except at each other, both critically aware of something shifting around them, even if they couldn’t put a name to it.
When the time came, Harry put on his best dress robes and ventured out of the ancestral Black home under the protection of his invisibility cloak to attend Draco's funeral. He sat alone in the back and stayed under his cloak the entire time as the few individuals who were in attendance paid their respects. It wasn't until after everyone had left, and Draco had been laid to rest in the Malfoy family plot that Harry felt safe enough to remove his cloak and approach the headstone.
“Mr. Malfoy sustained severe burns to a significant portion of his torso and hands. There were some usual properties to the burns that suggest the fire was magically altered. Quite nasty stuff, actually.”
Miguel chucked, "I actually split my time between Brazil and Portugal for work purposes. My mother lives here in London, so whenever I come to Europe, she insists I come and visit. I could never do research here—far too cold or rainy for my taste."
Harry watched as Draco moved carefully into a more upright position, keeping his jaw shut tightly to keep any noises of pain from escaping.
Closing the front door, he noticed his cloak hanging on the stand, realizing his mother most have sent it over with a house elf. After stopping to wash his face, Draco settled at the kitchen table, waiting for Harry to come home.
Draco had no sooner pulled away when Harry dropped to his knees, claiming Draco’s mouth in a searing kiss as his hands scrambled to undo the fastenings on Draco’s robes.  Harry’s hand worked quickly, and Draco pulled away from the kiss to bite into Harry’s shoulder as he reached his climax.
“Auror Potter,” Healer Morin said again, more sternly, “Is your interest with this patient personal or professional?”
It was question that Harry had been expecting and one he had an answer for, though he did not know how he had arrived at this conclusion.
Not wanting to push his luck though, Harry kept his touches light, and even though this was practically virginal compared to their last meeting, the same chemistry grew around them and Harry felt the want growing in his chest.
Harry blinked, “Sorry ma’am. What did you say?”
“The fucking prick,” Ron growled and turning to look at Hermione, he asked, “Do you recognize her? Any chance it’s a relative?”
The two Healers glanced at each other, “Auror Potter,” Healer Morin began.
Harry smiled slightly as he recognised the Slytherin house crest that was carved beautifully below the Malfoy crest. He kneeled down in front of the headstone, running his fingers slowly over the serpent in the Slytherin crest. He watched in amazement as, under his touch, the serpent transfigured itself to reveal the form of a stag with his head held high standing gracefully in the middle of the Slytherin crest. In his surprise Harry pulled his hand away, and the stag was replaced once again with the image of a snake.
"Draco, wait!" Harry called after him, stumbling in his hurry to follow the blond. Draco was shocked at hearing his name come from Potter's lips. They had only ever called each other Potter and Malfoy to the other's face. Stopping in his surprise, Draco felt a hand grip his elbow and he let himself be spun around so that he was face to face with the Chosen One.
"Please babe, come back. I didn't mean anything by it—it was just harmless fun. Please come back."
“I said, sort of.” Draco paused and glanced quickly at Harry before looking away again, this time down at his and Harry’s shoes, willing himself not to cry in the hallway of the Auror Department.
Harry’s eyes flashed again. Draco felt a shiver go through him at the energy that was rolling off Harry and then he ducked as a figuring on the mantle behind him exploded.
“Bastard.” Harry hissed and Draco grinned.
Draco shrugged again, not wanting to admit out loud that for the first time he could remember, he would rather spend Christmas somewhere else than with his parents. They were both silent for a few moments, and then Harry asked, “When are your parents expecting you?”
Harry saw red—cheating, in his book, could never be considered harmless fun. Turning around, he strode purposefully back to where the man was still kneeling on the ground, looking pathetic. "First, and let's get this straight—cheating in no way is harmless or fun. I have half a mind to contact this spouse of yours and tell him what an absolute asshole you are to take something like this so lightly. Second, I am not, will never be, and never was your baby, and if you call me babe on more time, I swear to god I will make you pay dearly for it. And third—stay the hell away from me, Neville, and all of my friends."
Smiling—Draco clearly thought he was his assistant, Harry walked up so that was standing right behind Draco and waited for the other man to put down his quill. Finally, when it looked like Draco couldn’t drop, spill or smash anything, Harry spoke up.
Ignoring this, Hermione looked at Draco critically, “Are you okay Draco?”
The trio kept walking until they were back at the entrance to the Great Hall; Ron and Hermione kept walking but Harry stopped, not sure he was ready to face the crowds again. Instead he told his two best friends that he was going up to Gryffindor Tower. They just nodded, understanding his need to be alone.
“You know my parents expect me to marry and produce a legitimate heir. They know I’m gay and it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s my duty as a Malfoy. I’ve told them that I won’t marry a woman, let alone date one, and it seems like they’ve finally started believing me because they started to arrange dates for me. I found ways to refuse all of them so this time they just didn’t tell me. They invited me out to dinner and invited someone they felt was a suitable match.” Draco let out a long breath.
Once ready, Harry headed back to the living room, where Sophie had sat herself down in front of his door, sobbing quietly into her pillowcase. He picked up his cloak off the floor where he had left it and kneeled down to look at Sophie. Indicating that he was ready to go, Harry grabbed Sophie's hand and with a loud crack, Harry felt the familiar feeling of being sucked into a dark hole that accompanied disapparition.
most guys would've been crushed
“Death eater scum you are, why do want Auror Potter? Going to finally finish him off?” The wizard sneered.
—Auror Potter? Potter?—Harry?”
Standing outside Abraxous Apothecary and Potions, Harry chewed his lip, wondering for the hundredth time if there was someone else who he could consult. But even as this thought crossed his mind, he dismissed it. Every other potion master he’d met told him to come talk to this Master Abraxous—he was the best. The only thing was no one supposedly knew who this person was, otherwise, they might have reconsidered their recommendation. Harry knew though and he still decided to come.
He stood up and offered a hand to Draco, which Draco took if only to feel Harry’s calloused palm under his again.
“What?” Harry stared at him.
Harry was drawn from his reverie and looked up to see a young witch waiting expectantly behind a counter.
“I’m sure you have no idea,” Draco said dryly, “You know, if you stopped trying to distract me, I’d finish sooner and we could be on our way, but—” Draco sighed—“I’ll have to start this calculation over now, the spilled ink has completely ruined it.”
Harry was pulled from his thoughts as an uncharacteristic silence fell of over his group of friends. Looking up, it didn't take Harry long to see what they were all staring at. In the middle of the dance floor, Draco and an incredibly good looking man had totally given up on dancing and were giving a very elaborate display of public affection. Watching the couple, and knowing Draco's physical tells, Harry wasn't surprised when the couple disapparated on the spot. Why can’t it be that easy for me? Harry thought to himself as he stared at the spot where the couple had previously been.
he thought,
The wizard laughed. “As if I’d believe you. Harry Potter would never date a-“ But what exactly Draco was or what Harry would not date was cut off by the sound of laughing voices as a group walked around the corner, stopping at the scene in front of them.
The words stood out on the parchment, shimmering a little in the light of the full moon. As Harry re-read the words, his heart sank and Harry suddenly felt sick to his stomach. Harry looked down at the note, scrunching his brow and running a hand over his scar, a habit he had developed whenever he was deep in thought. He wondered what Draco meant; granted he had said that he was leaving but he surely didn't mean forever. Draco couldn't be leaving Harry forever; he wasn't ready to lose another person so dear to him.
“And it’s the other way around. Ginny didn’t deserve you. Yes you made a mistake, I’m not saying you didn’t but you deserve someone who will accept every part of you, queer or not and from what you’ve told me, she never would.”
“Shame,” Harry replied with a small smile, “I was going to thank you for bringing me breakfast in bed. But we might not have the time.”
Draco didn’t want to let go. Didn’t want to face the possibility that this could be the last time he would kiss Harry, or feel his body pressed up between him and hard surface. But Draco’s luck at keeping Harry where he wanted him finally ran out as Harry took advantage of Draco’s roaming tongue and bit down hard, pushing Draco away as he checked his tongue for blood.
There you have it. Reviews and kudos much appreciated. I’d love to hear what you guys thought of it.
Tilley bowed again and was gone, leaving Draco to curse again at his father’s insistence of continuing the tradition of full Christmas breakfast. As if Draco wasn’t old enough to make his own plans for Christmas.
"Over the years, you and Harry have been told that you have to hate each other. Your destinies have been intertwined from the beginning. It is not hard to see how such a strong emotion like hate could be transformed into another strong emotion like love, especially with the terrors of the past year and everything you both have had to face." Luna paused, looking directly at Draco before she continued, "if you want my opinion, I think the two of you make quite the distinguished pair."
“It’d actually be a nice little solution to your problem wouldn’t it? Date when mommy and daddy are around, keep them quiet and then come home to me at night after washing off any traces of lipstick or perfume. Nice little Slytherin scheme, don’t you think?”
Pulling himself away from Harry long enough to grab his hand, Draco practically dragged Harry back into the Gryffindor's dormitory, undoing the button on his own suit jacket as he did.
Despite the near silence of Draco’s approach, he could tell the second Potter became aware of his presence. Draco smirked, stopping a few feet behind the now stationary Auror.
Their close proximity caused Draco to shift slightly, his hands coming to rest on Harry's hips of their own accord. They stayed still in that pose for only the briefest of moments before both moved to close the gap, their lips fitting together perfectly, as if they were made for each other alone. The kiss, which started out gentle, became progressively harder and more desperate. Draco's nails dug into Harry's hips, and Harry's grip in Draco hair became so tight it was a wonder he didn't pull any hair out, and all the while a familiar and deep passion awoken in both boy's hearts as the understanding of what could have been—what should have been—crashed over them both with an intensity that neither one expected.
“No, you don't.”
Draco was indeed thinking. And if he was being honest with himself, everything Luna had said was correct. Draco didn't feel like he belonged in the ranks of the other Death Eaters including his father, but nor did he feel like he deserved a place among the victorious. The next thought that crossed Draco's mind was
Draco, still in shock that he hadn't been thrown out, let Harry kiss him. When Harry pulled back, Draco asked in a weak tone, "But why would you love me?"
Draco sighed heavily as he looked over the Hogwarts grounds from where he stood on the Astronomy Tower. The sun was barely visible over the horizon; the last rays of sunlight ghosting over Draco's face as he stood there thinking. He thought about the last time he was stood there, almost a year ago. The memory brought a smile to Draco's face, and he closed his eyes, welcoming the memory back.
“What does that even mean?” Draco called at her retreating figure, but Hermione didn’t respond, leaving Draco to decide if he was going to follow her advice.
"What do you mean 'be careful'?" Harry's tone of voice implying that he was an Auror, he could take care of himself.
"Harry Potter, sir, my name is Sophie, sir. I was sent by my Master sir, to bring you to him sir." The elf squeaked out, looking up at Harry with eyes that reminded Harry distinctly of Dobby.
Draco wasn't sure if that was going to work on the general public, but for now, it was good enough for him. He sighed contently, cuddled closer to Harry and let himself be overtaken by exhaustion.
Looking down at the other man, Harry noticed for the first time a chain he wore around his neck. Reaching down, Harry caught hold of the chain and pulled up on it, revealing a gold ring dangling from the end of it.
“Draco?” Harry’s voice sounded from the middle of the pack and Draco let out a visible sigh at the sound.
“Hello Harry, you hear about the explosion in Diagon Alley today?”
Harry laughed again as he stroked Draco's back. "Who cares? I'm the Chosen One. I saved the whole bloody world. I'm entitled to love who ever I want."
echoing in his brain. Acting on impulse rather than any semblance of rational thought, Draco moved around the couch and caught Harry just as he turned, so they were nose to nose. Reaching out, Draco pushed Harry hard towards the closest wall, pinning him there.
Draco took a step back and sniffed, “I do not know what you mean.”
Moving further down, Harry reached the waistband of Draco's pants. Looking up, Harry received a curt nod from Draco before undoing the button and zipper and removing the pants with extraordinary speed. Cupping Draco's erection through the silk boxers he wore, Harry swore he heard Draco mutter "Fuucckkkk" under his breath. Smirking to himself, Harry slide the boxers down just far enough that the head of Draco's cock was visible. And when Harry circled the head with his tongue in slow swirling motion, Draco's quiet moans became all out groans of "Oh fuck Harry" and pleas for Harry to continue.
Harry reached a hand, wanting so badly to touch and feel proof that Draco was alive, but he withdrew his hand, also afraid of disturbing or hurting Draco as he slept. Instead, Harry drew his wand once more and conjured himself a chair at the foot of Draco’s bed. Settling in, Harry resigned himself to watching the slow rise and fall of Draco’s chest, grateful for that small sign of life.
Draco gave a derisive laugh, “Oh, I’m fantastic. Just can’t remember when I’ve been better. Really restful weekend. How are you? Have a good weekend then?”
They had stopped outside a set of beautifully carved oak double doors. Harry went to open the door but before he had the chance, Andromeda placed a hand on his wrist. "Potter….Harry…." she said with a surprising amount of gentleness in her voice, "This is going to be a shock for you; I know it will be, but try to be tactful. This person has suffered greatly and not just from this illness that will soon take their life. They only have a few moments left, so please try not to judge them too harshly." And with that, she released Harry's wrist and turned to leave.
Ron opened his mouth to say something but closed it again, recognising the look in his best mate's face. "If or when you what to talk about it, whatever it is, you know I'll be here for you mate."
Taking the vial, Draco held it up to the light, examining it with interest, “Did the others identify whose DNA was added to the potion?” he asked absently.
“Fuck off Malfoy.” Harry shouldered past him and moved quickly towards the exit.
“No specifics yet. Teams are still there investigating,” Peters shook his head, “but I heard some senior Aurors talking and rumour has it, it wasn’t an accident.”
Harry sighed deeply.
Draco was shocked at the state of the castle. The place he had called home for six years was in ruins around him and it made his heart ache as he walked through the debris filled halls. Without really meaning to, Draco arrived at the portrait of the Fat Lady, which he happened to know was the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
"Oh Harry," Hermione breathed as she got up and rushed to her friend's side. Wrapping an arm around his waist, Hermione took his weight, and slowly lowered them to the floor, where she pulled Harry close as he continued hold the bracelet tightly to his lips. Ron came up behind the pair, and putting an arm across each of their shoulders acted as the anchor that held the three together for the time being.
Harry watched her go, wondering who this person was that could make the impossibly tough Andromeda Tonks look so disheartened. Taking a deep breath, Harry turned back to face the door and slowly turned the knob. Pushing the door ajar just enough so that he could slip through, Harry let the door close behind him with a muted thud. The room Harry found himself in was not what he expected of a room housing a dying person. It was large and airy, the windows open and the pale rays of sunlight providing the only light source in the room. It was almost idyllic, thought Harry, though he quickly became aware of the only sound in the room—a raspy, labored breath coming from a large bed located between two full windows.
“Sorry Auror Potter,” the wizard said, “They’re still tryin to figure out that big group that came in from Beijing. And then they got a big group comin in from Egypt but it looks like some of the Chinese travelers ended in Egypt but their luggage gone missin’. It’s a mess.” Checking his schedule, he added apologetically, “I’d wager another twenty minutes at least.”
His prediction proved true, and he gave a sharp tug on Draco’s hair to warn him before it was too late, but Draco didn’t go anywhere, swallowing the evidence of Harry’s pleasure.
Harry didn't wait for Draco to make up his mind. Walking the few steps forward, he planted himself firmly in front of Draco. He reached up, looping his arms loosely around Draco's neck, he hands finding their way to the hair on the back of Draco's head. Harry pulled himself towards Draco until their breath mixed in the few centimetres left between them.
“You’re being ridiculous” Draco raised his voice, frustration starting to creep in.
Even though every fibre of his physical being was telling him to repeat the experience he’d just shared, Draco knew he needed to leave before Harry opened his eyes. Because despite everything he’d just told Harry about how Ginny didn’t deserve him, Draco knew deep down that he too didn’t deserve Harry. So, like the coward he always knew he was, Draco fled, slipping away almost as silently as he’d come.
There was a general round of "hey", "welcome" and "nice to meet you" from those gathered around. Hermione, of course, walked up and immediate began questioning the man about his work—her love of knowledge not having waned a bit since Hogwarts. Harry watched the whole thing with mild interest, and he couldn't help but notice that Miguel kept glancing his way, as if hoping to catch Harry's eye.
, he thought to himself as he outwardly rolled his eyes as he watched Harry attempt to redo his button and refasten his bowtie.
I can smile, live it up
Draco shivered again as Harry bit down on his earlobe, causing Draco to push into Harry even more. Harry gasped as he felt Draco's growing erection press against his own through far too many layers of clothing.
"What are you doing?"
“Like hell I do,” Draco growled, and Harry shivered as he traced the shell of his ear.
“Of course she wouldn’t care. The Golden Boy would never do anything to damage his golden life, isn’t that right Potter? Especially something as scandalous as getting caught in a gay tryst.” Only years of practice hid the wistfulness and tinge of bitterness in Draco’s voice.
“Fuck Draco,” Harry groaned as Draco took him in his mouth. “I won’t last long,” He added, shuddering as Draco put his truly talent tongue to work. Draco just moaned in response, and Harry let his eyes slide close, giving himself over to pressure and heat building at the base of his spine.
“Let me do it,” he said, swatting Harry’s hands away, “Last thing we need is for you to back in there dishevelled and partially undressed.”
“Leave.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione slowly left the Headmaster's office and made their way back down the stone stairs, stepping over the gargoyle that was still lying on its side.
“Wait!” Draco called after him, “Potter, wait!” Jogging to catch up, he grabbed Harry’s shoulder and pulled, forcing Harry to turn around and face him. “I’m sorry, alright?—I shouldn’t have laughed. Truce?” He asked, extending his hand.
“May I help you?”
Harry grinned and leaned in closer to Draco, “I don’t recall you complaining at the time. In fact, I think you asked for seconds of what I was serving.”
Draco was lost in his own thoughts and he didn't notice Luna Lovegood walk up and sit down next to him.
“Just some muggle,” Harry ran a hand through his hair, “Gin was supposed to be travelling with the Harpies. It’d been a long week, I went out to some bar after hours, and met this guy. We had some drinks—he was hot and willing, I was drunk and stupid.” Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes, and Draco waiting for him to continue.
“Ron? Ron, are you even listening to me?” Hermione stopped walking and turned to find Ron standing in front of a window, mouth hanging open.  Hermione’s annoyance at being ignored was momentarily displaced by curiosity, “What is it?” she asked, walking to stand next to Ron.
Harry timidly approached the bed; completely unsure of whom he would find lying there. Closing his eyes, Harry took the last few steps forward and when he opened his eyes his gaze was met by ice blue eyes that could pierce any soul.
“She just left? She didn’t want to talk about it, you know, try to make it work?” Draco asked, mildly surprised.
Picking up the cracked frames, Harry shoved them back onto his face as he shouldered his way past a group of young witches waiting to enter the Alley through the back entrance. Pulling out his badge, Harry ignored the gapes and gasps from the witches.  “Move, Auror business.” He commanded.
Harry thought to himself, but it sure felt nice to be desired by someone so Harry didn't say anything. Despite Neville's earlier warnings, and Harry's decision to keep things cordial between them, he couldn't bring himself to tell Miguel to stop, so he simply closed his eyes and tried to lose himself in the music and forget the fact that Draco, the man he wanted back so badly, was sitting just across the room and was watching him grind a total stranger. But instead of forgetting about Draco, dancing with Miguel just made Harry want Draco more—Draco knew him, his body, what he liked and didn't like, and while what Miguel was doing felt pretty damn good, it would be heck of a lot better with Draco.
“Take the next one.” Draco answered as he grabbed Harry’s hands and pinned them against the wall, leaning in to again capture Harry’s lips.
Harry, who despite being exhausted beyond belief, wasn't able to fall asleep no matter how hard he tried. He laid in his bed, tossing and turning, finally resigning himself to just laying there. Of course, the moment the door had opened, he was fully alert, gripping his newly repaired wand tightly in his hand.
They lapsed into silence, both thinking, and Draco felt his eyes well up again. He hiccupped a bit and Hermione glanced over at him.
“Good idea.” Harry answered and he and Draco stepped aside to let the group through. “Put the first round on my tab. I won’t be long.” He called as the last of the group stepped through the floo.
“Auror Potter, excellent timing.” Senior Auror Hanson, head of investigations, said, approaching him. “I was just about to send for you. I suppose news of this event has started to spread through the Department?”
“I’m going to need actually food, Draco. You don’t count.” Harry responded, redoing the button on his jeans.
“And when you’re thinking on something you bite the corner of your lip.” Harry traced his fingers across Draco’s lower lip and gave it a tug for emphasis, “You do the same thing when you’re trying to decide if I should fuck you or if you should fuck me.”
Draco gave a little shrug and wiped at his eyes with his sleeve, “I haven’t seen my parents in months. I couldn’t just walk out on them.”
“I don’t need to be inside to woo donors. I have one of the wealthiest standing right in front of me,” Harry retorted.
Reaching out a hand, it took Draco a minute to locate his wand on the nightstand and he cast a quick time charm, which told him it wasn’t yet 6 in the morning.  Draco snuggled back into the blankets, deciding more sleep wouldn’t hurt but he’d never been very good at staying in bed once he was awake. And besides, one part of his anatomy was definitely awake and ready to start their day, even if Draco’s brain was still trying to catch up.
Kiss 1: Breathtaking—August 2002
, Harry continued.
Harry was happy to oblige and pulled Draco's boxers off in one swift motion, taking all of Draco's considerable length in his mouth as he did so. Draco jerked his hips upwards, bucking wildly and moaning constantly at the sudden wet warmth that had enveloped his cock. Harry moved his hands to hold down Draco's hips and his talented tongue and mouth molested Draco's cock to the point that Draco didn't know how much longer he could hold on.
“What potion were you trying to make?” Harry inquired, forgetting momentarily his purpose of being there.
Walking through the archway, Harry move on autopilot stop until he turned the corner at the end of the Alley and saw for the for the first time what remained of Draco’s store. The sight of the charred frame and collapsed roof stopped Harry in in his tracks.
Narcissa closed her book, “That is quite alright Draco,” she said, studying Draco carefully. “I trust you had a pleasant Christmas morning.”
Kiss 7: Can’t let go—June 2003
“Because I couldn’t disrespect my parents that way,” Draco chewed his lip, his parents were always a touchy topic between he and Harry, “They do love me, in their own way. I don’t want to lose them. And besides, I never thought you’d find out.”
