"Do you remember us being down the trapdoor when we were first years and were after the philosopher's stone? Me and Harry were being smothered by that weird plant-”
Ron saw Hermione grabbing her coat and marching out without saying a word. Ugh, he knew she was shaky today!
“What’s so funny?” asked Harry, finally handing Draco his lager with a smile. Oh, his favorite. He gave Harry a nod at a job well done.
And the once slight tremor in the boy’s hand became more pronounced as his hand stopped a few inches from Harry’s form.
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. After Hagrid was done looking at the unicorn, he led Harry and Hermione over to where Neville, Malfoy, and Fang were
“Each year the fifth year students get one first year to sort of look after and mentor,” explained Millicent. “It’s supposed to help ease the transition.”
Harry was nearly at the stairs that lead to the Great Hall then onward to Gryffindor Tower when he felt someone pull him into a pitch black classroom. And here it was. The prank. The joke. The reason that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle hadn’t said a word to him the whole day. It was all leading to this.
When he wakes with a scream, he is sure that he has woken everyone on Pivet Drive. Harry lays there, panicked and covered in sweat, his body twitching violently. Harry waits for and listens for the sound of Uncle Vernon’s heavy footsteps rushing to punish him, but instead of harsh footsteps, stuttering rage, and slamming doors Harry hears his bedroom door open slowly and a familiar voice that casts, “Lumos.”
And the members of the other wizarding school stomped into the Great Hall, their billowing fur capes trailing behind them as each stomp of their staffs hit the ground and sparks shot from the contact. Then, in walked,
“Excuse me, gentleman, but you have a fireplace to catch,” said Dumbledore. The man held up a old watering can and set it on a table. “Home?” Remus said, pulling away from the other man slightly.
“Surely you aren’t so involved with your studies that you need to carry parchment with you wherever you go and surely not such an old piece of parchment?”
“Er…yeah,” said Harry, feeling a little uncomfortable with all the attention. “Ced’s talked about you of course,” said Amos Diggory.
“What is it you were saying, Bulstrode, we could be prefects if we wanted to,” said Fred, moving towards them.
“Well, well,” said Blaise. “Because as Eloise was doing very nice things to my person I do believe I saw another respectable young lady being not so respectable last night.”
Harry didn’t know what exactly was going on between Ron and Hermione, but he knew that he didn’t want there to be any confusion. Ron laughed, but looked more assured than he had before.
Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He was as shabby as ever, but looked healthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals.
“Why would they need a mentor? I didn’t get one when I was a first year,” Harry said. The room quieted immediately. Everyone turned to Harry and looked at him with struck
“No, my sister told me. In return for my being on my best behavior at her wedding this summer and waiting to do this to my hair she agreed to tell me some of the secrets she knew about the school from her time here.”
“Shopping for a new home Weasley?” Harry cringed. “Tired of being a bed warmer for those annoying brothers of yours?” Ron's face went red.
“That’s it?” Harry asked when Malfoy was out of the room. “You’re just going to let him get away with saying all that stuff?”
Hermione looked at her. “Millicent and I knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to go and find anyone. It was about to finish me off when they found me.”
Neville hit the ground facedown. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the Forbidden Forest before it fell out of sight.
“I asked if you were bitter, Professor,” said Harry calmly. “Do you hate the man that saved your life?”
Millicent smiled, looking as if she was doing Bagman a favor by having her cater to his bet. “What they said,” she gestured to the twins.
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense, if I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again Slytherin will have no more points left to its name, and
As they left the Great Hall, someone bumped Harry’s shoulder, but instead of seeing a green robe it was a blue one.
“Hello, ma’am,” Harry said, bowing low to greet Blaise’s mother. “Hello, young ladies,” he said then, turning to the two young girls beside her. Blaise’s mother was as striking as her son. She was a dark skinned woman with sharp cheekbones, and a jawline that Harry was impressed didn’t leave all of her suitors with skinned chins. She was tall, almost as tall as Remus, and Harry was nearly stunned speechless as she cast her gorgeous brown eyes in his direction.
“I’m so sorry, dear boy,” she said dreamily. “the heat of the day, you know….I drifted off for a moment.”
army. I didn’t want to say anything on the train, but Harry, things aren’t going to be the same as they have been every other year. These people,” she looked around the room, eyeing the various students milling about, talking to one another, and getting ready to head to bed.
Harry looked down at the field as dancers made their way to the center of the pitch. Music started and they started to dance. “Veela,” Harry heard someone say in an awed tone. Harry didn’t know what the big deal was, until he started to watch them. Ron nearly bumped him out his seat in an attempt to get closer to the creatures on the field.
Now, this man wasn’t solemn and his eyes didn’t search Draco’s face for a sign of nervousness or worry that he wanted to back out. He just ushered Draco though the rather solid looking door to the exam room. Draco had only ever read about the burning process in a few of the more restricted books in the ministry’s library, and the rather clinical pamphlets FATE had in their waiting rooms. But the real thing was different. The room looked like any other healer’s office, white and sanitary and cold. Few words were spoken, and Draco stayed calm until the healer lifted his wand. Draco had smelled the sickening burn of sulfur melting skin before when he passed by FATE, the smell making him sick by product or association Draco never knew, but now it seemed more clear. When that wand touched his skin and that
“I didn’t need too,” Harry cut in. “Because it changed.” And before Draco could reply with more vile, Harry said. “I changed it to you.”
“Yes,” said Lupin shortly. He was talking quite quickly now. “Sirius and your father and I were friends, but sometimes people aren’t who you expect them to be, sometimes you miss things that should have been obvious or over look things because of the way that you feel about them. Sometimes you make excuses, I don’t know…. It’s complicated.”
And he did…first his head then his body. Tall and untidy hair like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter blossomed then fell out the end of Voldemort’s wand. He walked close to Harry. Harry wanted to reach out to him, but knew he couldn’t. His parents could no more embrace him now than they had ever done.
“Which is why I won’t be taking it off, my parents decided that I should accept this..gift, so I have done so…”
“They would die for you. They would kill for you,” the striking woman said. “And I would do the same for my children, have too. I look out for my children’s best interests, but I also, know that their welfare is more than just physical, and that if something happened to you, that it would cause my son pain.”
Harry thought she was going to say something about his new look too, but she merely said, “It’s hotter than a troll’s underbelly in here.” She moved her hand, and Tracey
Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s. He hesitated not wanting them to know he’d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor door.
Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks. “Really upset she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She’s got her heart in the right place.”
“You’re not worried about that, are you? You’re safe here as long as Dumbledore is in this castle. Besides, the DL will need some time to recuperate both his body and his
“But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. “Your elf’s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!”
Flint looked surprised, but he quickly covered it. Harry thought it must be a Slytherin thing. “Professor Snape, potions professor and our head of house.”
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, other people, some looked like him, some didn’t, but their eyes were all full of love. Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
“And what exactly could Professor Lupin help you with? The man is not an expert in much, surely you didn’t go to him with my classes’ homework?”
Harry keeps quiet, because maybe he did kill the older boy after all. The sinking feeling in his stomach would certainly suggest so.
Two Chapters because I've been so absent. Update Next Week, let me know what you think, and if any lines stuck out to you :)
“Traveling, demontors, and Cyndi Lauper must agree with you, Potter, because you’re looking quite the catch.”
“Yeah, you don’t want me to feel embarrassed, no one will look at the mural anyway, my humiliation is completely unnecessary, I get it blah, blah, blah….”
“Do nothing!” Voldemort shrieked at them. Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening.
No more dragon, no more detention, they slipped down the staircase and couldn’t have felt happier. What could spoil it?
Harry hadn’t meant for it to turn into an argument, but the whole flight to the manor, Harry had done nothing but think. The pain from breaking with Octavian, the confusion that the man had left in his wake, and the bubbling feelings that he had stuffed down for too long had sent Harry spiraling.
Harry is just about to force himself to wake from this odd and frankly tiresome fever dream when he feels a rush of cold across his back. Petunia, he notices, must feel it to because she turns toward the front door. The wind forces the outside metal bins to fall sideways, and their sound startles Vernon awake.
“Breaking already, Potter?” Malfoy asked from his bed. Harry stayed silent. Turning away from Malfoy, rolling over, and instantly falling asleep once again, and when he woke the next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.
“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, finishing just one sheet of all the extra homework they had been given.
Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at their first Defense Against the Darks Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their materials and were chatting when he entered.
“I was going to say intellect, you gutter mind,” finished Millicent. “Besides, don’t we have better things to be concerned about? Like Umbridge, perhaps?”
“We have to help him, he’d do the same for us,” said Millicent, prepared to tackle Snape to the ground if she had too.
“I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight…but your mother needn’t have died….she was trying to protect you…Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain…..”
Draco started to sob violently. “Why now? You didn’t love me then, Potter, you never even looked at me.”
“Because I’m a death eater! Because people still spit on me when I walk down the street and you’re all over me around your family, but none of them ever considered that I was
He had, or at least everyone said he had, some pull in the wizarding world. Could he make it possible for Remus and Sirius to get married properly? What about Blaise, if he fell in love with a man? Ernie Macmillan? Or even himself?
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.
Harry watched in rapt attention as the scene unfolded as it had before. It was different being a spectator instead of a participant. More surreal. And he had to crush his nails into his hand to stop him from going after Pettigrew. He couldn’t mess this up. He had to save Sirius and if that meant letting Pettigrew go, then so be it.
Harry moved to the large doors that led to an outdoor area with stairs that led to the sea. Few were out on the darkened area, but none of the people there took notice of Harry. Harry moved toward the steps, and was almost to the sand when he saw movement in the darkness near the water.
Millicent laughed. “My family has been coming to Hogwarts for hundreds of years, our vault in Gringotts is close to the very bottom, and I am brilliant, there’s no way they’d kick me out.”
“Circumstances change, Harry, we have to take into account several…well, in the present env… Surely, you don’t want to be expelled?”
“You are prepared to believe Lord Voldemort has returned on the word of a lunatic murderer and a boy who as I understand it is not only a Parselmouth but has also been having funny turns all over the place.”
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy,” said Professor Lupin way too cheerfully for this crowd or this weather. “I thought it was time for another practical lesson, but fear not, not all of you will be forced to wade through unknown depths, only those who are craving some extra points.”
Harry didn’t wait around to hear Skeeter defend herself over describing Dumbledore as an obsolete dingbat in her last article and walked back toward the other champions.
“NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!” cried the witch, but Scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then scampered for the door. Scabbers raced out the door and Harry and Ron followed. After finding Scabbers near a bin outside of Quality Quidditch Supplies, Ron pocketed the shaking rat into his pocket.
The Slytherin first years followed Flint through the chattering crowd, out of the Great Hall, and down a marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like led again, with each step his dread intensified. Blaise walked beside him, more like pranced. He had an elegance about him that he shared with many of the other first years, but that Harry seemed to lack. It made him stand out more than he already did.
“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face. “where they’ve got everything….Pepper Imps…they make you smoke at the mouth, and great fat Chocoballs fullof strawberry mouse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you’re thinking what to write next…”
Harry chuckled at the speed with which Draco’s expression went from haughty school boy to shocked but fully awake gaping fish.
“You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived in the village fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. He didn’t like magic my father….
Fred, upon seeing everyone start dancing again, returned to his brooding, stalking off in the direction of the now spiked punch.
“Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!” shrieked Voldemort. Voldemort raised his wand, sick smile flashing for only Harry to see.
“Hagrid, please!” said Professor McGonagall, but Harry felt even warmer toward his friend then he thought possible. “Keep your voice down!”
Blaise wore out from leading quite the charge against a band of Weasley’s during the snowball fight had quickly fallen asleep as soon as he’d drawn his curtains. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed, and pulled the cloak from under it.
“The truth,” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not too in which case I hope you’ll forgive me.”
“Watch out!” shouted Draco Malfoy as Nott moved closer to watch Professor Lupin get the Kappa out of the water. He had stepped closer, slightly knocking Draco closer to the water and Draco looked as if he were about to have a panic attack.
“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.”
“I assure you Kararoff that you have nothing to worry about. Dumbledore has everything under control.”
“You should know that if one, even one more howler is sent in her direction or I hear that one more disgusting word was sent her way that I will not only unleash terror on that person, but the whole school will be subject to ALL HOLY PRANK TERROR!”
Harry huffed, rolling to his side so he could see her better where she hanged upside down off the side of Blaise’s bed. Blaise sitting on the floor beside her.
Thanks for reading, commenting, and kudosing. Also, just thanks for sticking with this story. I truly do love this fandom and all of you.
“Knitting clothes for yourself?” Blaise asked, as Hermione pulled a ball of yarn and two knitting needles out of her bag.
“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. Harry took one look at Neville and knew that if Malfoy and Neville were to go into the woods together it would be nothing but disaster, and if it weren’t for Harry he knew
Harry reached up to wipe at his eyes, and he could have sworn that he saw Draco’s hand twitched in response.
After, before Granger could wisely cover the Chosen One in a blanket, some enterprising person had got a shot of the “Chosen Mark” for the readers of the “Prophet”. It provided a romantic end to a catastrophic reign of madness. Voldemort was gone, but Harry Potter was still a target, though this time of men and women everywhere who proclaimed that they were Harry’s soul match. And though Draco wanted to, he would never dissuade them of that notion. Draco may bear his mark, but there’s no universe in which he was good enough for Harry Potter.
“My family has a long standing tradition of neutrality in the wars of men and wizard alike. Most of my ancestors were only involved in events that benefitted them financially or otherwise. I trust when you say that The Dark Lord has returned. All of whisperings that have floated to my ears has echoed your claims. England is going to be thrust into another war, and you and your godparents are going to be right in the middle of it. But…”
Draco blanched in true terror. And Harry couldn’t breathe. He was above water. He was breathing fresh air, but a monster was circling below him, and if Harry didn’t swim, if he didn’t tread water then it was going to get him and....
“You got a Firebolt and the first thing you do is hide it under your bed?” Flint sounded scandalized. Shocked and disgusted.
Pettigrew blanched. “He’s a dark wizard. Who knows what he learned when he was a spy for You-Know-Who.”
Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes as Harry and Ron told Hagrid all about their first week. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”
“There, now, Minerva,” said Fudge kindly, “Pettigrew died a hero’s death. Eyewitnesses, Muggles, of course, we wiped their memories later, told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing, ‘Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?’ And then he went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens…..”
Draco tried to take inventory of the room. Two clear exits. The door, but there was also one window that he thought he might be able to get out of if pressed.
“Me?” Draco asked, and Harry marveled at the question in his voice. Of course he thought of Draco. Few things in this world made him as happy as the man beside of him.
Harry looked once again at the dancing pair who were laughing quietly as the music suddenly changed direction and they had to readjust their steps.
Maybe that’s what this feeling is, thought Harry, as he held his aunt’s hand for the last seconds of her life. Maybe this is duty or obligation, but even as Harry thought it, he knew it wasn’t true. Harry was denied affection, compassion, and love from his family that was not a family, but that didn’t mean that it stopped Harry from wanting it. He loved them even when they had never felt love for him only commitment. Now, the love was gone, and he was fulfilling a commitment. He could be here now, have this now, and then he could let them all go.
Back at the Slytherin table some far less welcome company than Fred and George greeted him. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said with a smile. “I’ll never tell Malfoy that you helped free the beast that almost killed him.”
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a question. Harry started with an excuse, but McGonagall put her hand up.
The dorms looked the same as they had for Harry’s past two years at Hogwarts though he seemed to have brand new dorm mates. Nott, Crabbe, Goyle, and Malfoy were almost being well, not nice, but certainly polite to him. It wasn’t enough to make him go on full alert, but it was enough to make his ears perk up. Forget Sirius Black, the real threat was a smiling Draco Malfoy.
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet.
Everything was spilling out now. Draco couldn’t keep anything in. His head was hurting, his clothes were scorched, he didn’t know when he was going to be allowed to go back to work, and Harry was going to….
The man laughed. “I heard that they used to be the deepest in all of England, but after the war, things aren’t quite what they used to be are they? Oh, wait,” the man said. “you don’t think this is just about money do you.”
Harry doesn't dream of Voldemort either, with his snake like face staring down at him as he holds the cruciatus curse at his writhing form. Instead, he dreams of people with different colored ties grabbing him, pulling at his clothes and hair, shouting accusations at him, blaming him for killing Cassius Warrington.
It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.
“I’ve noticed that you’ve been getting a lot of attention from a particular judge in this tournament.”
“Firstly, Zabini, this is a sweater…or will be, and secondly, the most dangerous phrase in the human language is, “that’s the way it’s always been”. And besides I have a plan. Our short term aims are to secure house elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long term aims include changing the law about non-wand use….”
“My father told me,” said Nott. “That Snape can light fires with his eyes, he doesn’t even need a wand.”
“Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-dementor, a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.”
Harry nodded, dividing his attention between Pansy and her death stick. Not bothering to tell Pansy he didn’t know how to do one of those two step things either.
“OWLs,” said Millicent. “Fifth year exams. These will be the exams that determine what classes you’re eligible for next year. And since Pansy is determined that she will be the smartest trophy wife in history, she’s obsessed with, “Getting things in order as soon as possible”.
Harry walked into the Great Hall and immediately spotted Malfoy drinking his poncey tea and refusing Goyle so much as a sip.
Snape had also been after him worse than normal. Watching and waiting for Harry to make a mistake so he could assign a champion detentions with Filch. They were just down to testing their antidotes in double potions when Colin Creevey knocked on the door.
Blaise looked at him then, forcibly turning his head away from the mirror. “Your parents?” he asked Harry, voice weak. The calm, stoic face and personality that the Slytherin boy was known for slowly started to come back as he gazed at Harry.
“Oh, no,” said Harry, coming up behind him. “We’ve ate your cooking for days, it’s time for me to cook for you.”
“Sir…sir…Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously. “All the champions have to go, I think they want to take photographs.”
“Good. There’s no point moving them all now. I’ve found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You’ll be able to move them back in tomorrow.”
Draco smiled and laughed at the dorky but wonderful man before taking a few more files and setting back to work.
As the doors opened, and people started to file inside, Harry was ordered to stay where he was by Professor McGonagall. The champions would go in last. While neither Ron or Hermione had made an appearance.
“I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron,” said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. “I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.”
He had to tell someone. He was almost to the dungeons when he ran into Hermione, she seemed to be waiting for him.
Harry was out the door in a second, wand raised. He ran into the same sort of darkness that was in the room, not even the fireplace was glowing.
“Yeah, that’s right,” Harry shouted. “I’ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum and I’m just off to do a bit more….”
“There you are, Harry,” said a voice. Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same time, Stan shouted, “Blimey! Ern, come ‘ere! Come ‘ere!”
“Professor Snape seems to be very interested in the Dark Arts. Have you ever seen his office?” Harry asked, but as Professor Lupin kept sipping his drink, he assumed that it was probably too late for the man anyway.
The Slytherins all around them erupted in a way that Harry had never seen before. Each and every Slytherin even Malfoy seemed to be beside themselves with the news. Harry was even sure he spotted Tracey Davis giving
But nothing happened. The mirror that looked to be made of the most fragile glass didn’t break or shatter. It didn’t even crack.
“First, to Ms. Hermione Granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”
“Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him. “He brought them back from Hogsmeade last time….”
“Oi, Potter, nice to see you. Here, I thought we had officially lost you to the Gryffindors.” He looked him up and down. “Pity.”
Harry and Pansy followed the sound of the crying wolf, but somehow found themselves on the other side of the lake watching as Hermione fell to the ground, Sirius rolled over, weak and white faced, and saw himself try and try again to conjure the Patronus that would save them all. He knew that someone would show up, nearly right where they were standing. He knew that someone would come and cast the Patronus that would save them, but he waited and waited, and nothing happened.
A few other people were introduced to Harry as the party wore on. Elphias Doge. A woman who looked both striking and formidable with a wand. A couple more people were added to the mix, and Harry knew that they couldn’t all be here for his party.
Harry already had an excuse as to why he was out instead of in the common room when he saw what was in Marcus’ hands.
Dinner that night was a new experience. The food was of the very best kind as waiters, not house elves served them a four course meal.
With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeve’s left nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing.
“Wow!” exclaimed Blaise. “That witch, she got you the newest model and all she got me was this mirror.”
The real Mad-Eye Moody was found in a trunk, wizard’s space; he had been stunned and under control of the Imperious Curse. He was weak, but alive. Not Moody turned out to be Mr. Crouch, or at least Crouch Junior. Harry hadn’t recognized him in the graveyard, but when the remnants of the polyjuice potion he had been making all year finally wore off, Harry was told the truth. It was the man who Ely had written him about. It was Crouch’s Death Eater son.
“It’s Christmas, Potter,” Flint said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “The league breaks for Christmas, every team.”
“What company you keep, Potter,” said Millicent, tsk’ing him. “Oh, and Pans,” she said, as Professor McGonagall started to count them in. “I’d shut your mouth if I were you. You’re already inclined to premature wrinkles, and that expression is only going to give you more lines.”
“Everything will work. Sirius and I will both give our testimonies, and the Wizengamot will be forced to put an end to this.”
“You don’t know that you’ll make a complete fool out of yourself,” said Blaise reasonably. “Maybe just a little bit.”
“I think we should tell him,” said Mad-Eye Moody. The Extendable Ears were almost unnecessary to hear the gruff man, he spoke so loudly.
“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly. “Dobby doesn’t care what they think anymore!”
Jasmine laughed, and with a wave of one of her hands, a house elf changed the color of Sirius’ clothes.
“He asked me if I knew how to duel,” Harry went on, but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort’s wands, he found his throat constricted. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of Cassius, the old man and Bertha, and his parents flooded into his mind.
Then Ely McGovern was at his side, faster than even Not Moody in his zeal to defeat Harry, faster than anyone could stop him because Cassius Warrington laid dead on the grass. Ely fell to his knees beside the dead body, and shook him.
“Look at that, you lot… Potter fought! He fought it and he darn near beat it! We’ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention. Watch his eyes, that’s where you see it….very good, Potter, very good indeed. They’ll have trouble controlling you!”
“I never thought to look in here,” she whispered excitedly. “I checked this out from the library weeks ago.”
“I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore,” Professor McGonagall fumed. “I told him that you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but….”
“Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked excited at the news of a mass murderer being within yelling distance. “It was a Muggle who saw him. Course, she didn’t really understand. The Muggles think he’s just an ordinary criminal, don’t they? So, she phoned the telephone hot line, but by the time the Ministry showed up he was gone.”
“Yeah right,” said Draco, moving them back a step. “It’s a wonder Pansy doesn’t have bloody toes by now.”
“And I broke your door down after I left, but you were gone. I searched all over that night, but couldn’t find you. Then I went to the Ministry to try and file proceedings.”
“Someone tell me what happened before I start hexing people again,” Millicent said, eyeing the three people around her.
“Yeh’ve got ter strokes ‘em,” said Hagrid like it was the most obvious thing in the world. As Hagrid left them to get the creature, whatever it was, Malfoy started up again.
“Eat this right before you go into the lake, sir…..it’s gillyweed! It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!”
Harry started to speak again, but Blaise silenced him with a look. “Live a little, Potter, we may not get the chance to do so again anytime soon.”
The train had started to move. Nodding to Mr. and then Mrs. Weasley, Harry ran to the compartment door and Ron threw it open for him and Harry jumped in. Hermione, Ron, Millicent and Harry set off down the train, looking for a compartment that was empty.
The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes narrowing.
“Yes,” Lupin said, looking at Harry, not even trying to deny it. Lupin made a move to step toward Ron, but stiffened when he saw how Ron flinched from him. “I am what she says I am. I am a werewolf. I got the bite when I was just a child. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. As long as I take it the week preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. A harmless werewolf. However, back then there was nothing to control me. But then Dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic. He said if we take precautions that there was no reason why I couldn’t come to school.
“He won’t this time,” said Draco vehemently. Draco would kill the man himself, no matter what that did to his new reputation.
“You’ve been caught red handed elf!” Mr. Diggory roared, though Harry knew that he knew her name. “Caught with the guilty wand in your hand!”
Harry, Hermione, and Ron followed in behind them, but as people rushed past, the two groups got further and further separated from one another. As the group got further away from the explosions and the subsequent fires, the woods started to grow darker, and quickly the two groups lost one another.
“Nearly everyone,” Hermione said as she handed the long scroll to Hagrid. “Loads of people support you, Hagrid, this is just
“The first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges.
“It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the Frog’s head. “I could hear her louder that time, and him….Voldemort.”
He knew that he was intimidating and that he seemed that way to a lot of the kids. He knew that the Slytherins respected him as much as they feared him, and he knew that he relished in what he knew. Snape was
“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once Professor McGonagall was out of sight. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that message.
“Let me go!” Draco shouted loudly, yanking his arms as he did, gaining a bit of freedom, turning then tripping on the rug beneath their feet.
Exam results were in. Millicent was at the top of their class, Hermione had beat them all. Even Goyle managed to pick up his grades, with Millicent promising that she would help tutor him some this summer.
A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him…..
When he woke the next afternoon, it was due to a rather heated discussion going on in the common room. His housemates were all talking about Professor Lupin.
“Hagrid—what’s that?” asked Harry, but he already knew. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
He holds her hand, and tries not to be stiff. Harry doesn’t think she can see her, but on the off chance, he doesn’t want her to see his discomfort in her last moments. But, it was unnatural for him even when she was so close to death to be giving or taking comfort from the woman who had been his family in name only. Harry knew that she wasn’t here anymore, not really, but he had never been quite this close to her before. She had never comforted him after a nightmare or placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder after a fight with Dudley or after a bad day at school. She had never hugged him, and there was never any mention of love, only of duty.
Professor Flitwick cleared his throat. “An immensely complex spell, involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find, unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!”
“Can you believe that?” said Millicent. “Two rolls of parchment about how to recognize and kill werewolves?”
Turning to Harry, “And thanks for the bracelet, Potter. I was surprised to see you had that much taste. Sorry I didn’t get you anything.”
Hermione just laughed and shook her head, for the third time today. "I did not. It was a stupid curse."
"Nonsense. You couldn't miss your exam. You're the only one who actually stood a chance. I couldn't let you give up on a test. Not even for me." Ron gave Hermione a little smirk, but then immediately swiped the grin away.
“But this is servant’s stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d be copying lines or something,”
“Don’t make fin of my piece just because I want you in it.” Draco nodded. He had to admire her work, she was good no matter how he felt about her subject.
When Draco woke for good, he knew that where he was wasn’t Heaven, but was St. Mungos. He had made it out alive.
“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione furiously. “Mr. Diggory, calling her ‘elf’ all the time…and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn’t do it and he’s still going to sack her! He didn’t care how frightened she’d been, or how upset she was…it was like she wasn’t even human!”
Harry wondered briefly how many of them knew the truth of what had happened to him? Was he now sitting in a room with one or more of the people who had beaten him?
“It wasn’t her!” said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. “Winky’s got a squeaky voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper! It didn’t sound anything like Winky did it?”
“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I traveled the world. He showed me how wrong I have been thinking that there is good and evil, that there is this great chasm between them, but there isn’t.
The rest of the summer went by in a calmer manner. They got their books, played Quidditch, and Harry ate more food than he thought he could hold. The only majorly exciting thing had something to do with a wizard named Mad-Eye Moody. Mr. Weasley and Amos Diggory had rushed to take care of that matter. Then before Harry knew it, it was time to board the Hogwarts Express.
“And what the hell does that mean?” Sirius said louder, and Harry could tell that more spells were about to cast.
“You bought Madam Pince a birthday gift last year, as you haven’t seen her in years. I’m hardly special.” Draco tried to sound lighthearted, but Harry caught him out.
“Did you?” Ely asked before placing a piece of parchment in his hand and turning to walk away. “Perhaps you should read that before you go thinking that you know anything.”
This is a Dean/Seamus sort of section to this story, and I just wanted to say, hold on for them because they are clearly working some stuff out, but best friends forever...right?
“No,” said Harry, eager to defend the old headmaster for some reason. “He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you
Draco’s whole body language changed. He stood taller, and faced Harry like he did when they were facing down unfriendly wands. “We do all of those things together. Why do you think we get along so well Harry? You’re the brilliant auror, don’t tell me you still don’t get it.” The words were out in anger before Draco could shut his mouth. And suddenly, the first breath of air wasn’t enough for Harry. He needed it all.
Millicent had painted quite a picture. Beside Pansy’s bed on the wall above the Hogwarts’s issue side table was stuck a list of dates and times, occurrences detailing when she had seen M.G and where.
“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,” Uncle Vernon had said. “I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all.”
“Bravo, Viktor!” boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause. “Knew you had it in you!”
He might not be very good company, but Professor Lupin’s presence in their compartment had its uses. Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again when Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Crabbe and Goyle appeared outside the compartment doors.
“They know what you look like Potter. It would be negligent of the both of us if I allowed you to get back into the field. Malfoy can handle this, or don’t you trust your partner.”
“The first task is designed to test your daring,” he told Harry, Warrington, Fleur, and Krum, “so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard…very important….”
Harry had a great idea, but he sure as heck wasn’t going to put himself in this woman’s sights. Until, “What you have been told by certain members of our community is a lie. Cassius Warrington’s death was a tragic accident, but nothing more. The callous actions of a young man eager to prove himself.”
As they were walking toward the exit, saying goodbye to their families, Harry noted that Fleur handed something to Bill. Harry assumed that it was her address. She was taking the first move. Hermione would be proud.
This is it, Draco thought. He has finally gone insane because there was no way Harry would ever have said that to him.
Harry moved toward the door, wondering what kind of car Remus had borrowed to pick him up in. But just as he reached the boundary between the living room and the hall, Remus put out a hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to Hagrid’s, but Hermione wouldn’t hear of it, rushing him off to class.
As soon as not Moody saw Harry hit the ground, he stood and with a fierce anger in his crazy eyes he fired the Dark Mark into the sky. Then before anyone could do anything, he slung killing curse after killing curse at Harry.
“The dorm,” Harry answered succinctly, wondering where Crabbe and Goyle had gotten themselves off to.
“I can’t believe we are finally going to meet Basks,” said a young girl with purple hair and a nose piercing.
While Millicent and Krum spun around the dance floor looking like a very fine couple, Fred and Angelina Johnson kept stepping on each other’s feet while George Weasley was barely content to dance with his date at all. Draco and Fleur were also going the politician route and since Malfoy had gotten what he wanted in taking Fleur to the Ball and having been seen with her, he seemingly had his fill of the fierce champion and part Veela. She was turning on the charm though as several boys surrounded them, suiting her and Malfoy both just fine.
“Over there,” said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice. “There was someone behind the trees….they shouted words…an incantation…” Crouch seemed to doubt Hermione’s words, but none of the other Ministry wizards apart from him seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione’s words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.
A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.
“How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?” he whispered. “And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?”
Sirius says hello. He is currently out at the shops. The ministry has allowed him that much leave to stray from our residence. We are working on attaining license for a visit to see you very soon. Having a Hogwarts champion for the school looks quite good on the Ministry and a happy one looks even better. I did quite enjoy what you said about SPEW at the first task, that was wonderfully put. Should I think Ms. Granger or Ms. Bulstrode for the lovely outfit you were photographed as wearing? All joking aside, I am glad that you are well. Sirius has been in a tizzy, and I confess that I am not that much better. But using what skills you have and what tools are available is a wonderful lesson for dealing with the Dark Arts and I’m glad that you remembered that. You always were one of the best DADA students. Please also tell Ms. Granger that I still have her last essay with extended notes and commentary if she would like me to owl it to you for her. She has been quite insistent on its status.
Pansy stepped forward hesitantly, but the boggart knew immediately what it wished to become for her.
It looked like an unused classroom. He could see the dark shapes of desks and chairs, but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone
He sat on the arm of the wingback chair Pansy was in and kissed her cheek. The gesture was enough to make Harry puke. He locked eyes with Pansy, motioned to Draco with his eyes then shook his head. Pansy nodded once, discreetly. She had what she wanted now, and that meant Harry had her silence about Sirius and the slate between them was clear, for now.
Harry nodded, glad his friend had gotten a new wand after the Willow incident last year. “And we’ve got all our books,” Ron said.
“Her best interests?” said Hermione, voice still a little too loud for the library. “You mean trying to get her to come and work for you and your mother for free instead of
Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open and a large, roughly hewn wooden cup was withdrawn. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing white blue flames.
Please comment if you have any questions or thoughts. You can also send me an ask on Tumblr at inkdrinkershadowsinger
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course, exceptionally bright, in fact, but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers….”
“Right! Follow me! Great lesson comin’ up,” Harry admired his friend’s optimism. Hagrid led them to the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
Harry rubbed his eyes and cast an Impervius on his glasses for good measure. He couldn’t have just saw what he thought he did. Then, blinking, he saw it again. A black mass floated just in the peripheral of his vision, and Seamus Finnigan was flying straight toward it.
Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view. Then he heard the dormitory doors open.
Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it one of the desks. It was a large, square, and very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and George’s jokes, stared at it.
“Killed someone didn’t he?” Blaise, the boy beside Harry answered. “Didn’t you know all us Slytherins are nothing more than rogues, scoundrels, traitors, and murderers?”
“I mean,” Harry clarified. “I know you hang out with Luna and we’ve all seen Blaise, Greg, and Pansy ever since she and Hermione started working together, but never you.”
Millicent leaned into him as Daphne and Astoria walked into the compartment, and instantly began commenting on his appearance. “You look good, Potter,” she said.
Harry merely nodded, wondering where the man was going with this. He may have only been starting to get to know Remus, but he knew this man really well.
Ron seemed to be stuck. “But, but….maybe someone else can sign for you or Fred and George, they know plenty of secret passages.”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. He grabbed his wand, and summoned his clothes. Fuck! His pants were covered in scorch marks. Harry walked to the cabinet in the room, and pulled out a bag.
Harry never knew Malfoy cared for Crabbe that much. The shocked look on Crabbe’s face said he didn’t either. Draco slammed his hand over his mouth like he couldn’t believe he had just said that, but then Crabbe threw the cucumber at the water demon’s head, and while it was distracted, managed to make it to the other side of the pond and out of the water.
“Lucius Malfoy may have a long arm, but this is my territory, and there is no crossing boundaries unless someone has my say so.”
There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said, “Well, it didn’t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we’d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Roberts’ before they hit the ground, though. They’re having their memories modified right now.”
He noticed how Kingsley Shacklebolt had gotten up at one point, and went over to talk in hushed tones to Sirius. He noticed how the new woman was in deep conversation with Bill Weasley. And how Tonks, the colorful, young cousin he never knew Sirius had whispered conspiratorially with Mr. Weasley.
over, but decided it was far too cold in the dungeon for that. If Malfoy wanted to scoot over, he could. He was the one who sat beside Harry in the first place.
Harry could hear the boos from his housemates as the Gryffindor team walked out onto the field, and smiled a little as they told the commentator what they thought of his comments. Flint and Wood walked to the center of the field with Madam Hooch for a few last minute rules.
“Well, well, Potter, didn’t realize I was your type, domineering, in control, powerful. I could have pitched Skeeter a far more interesting tale than Granger.”
On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of
The elf popped into the existence at the sound of his name, and turned to Sirius who was steadfastly ignoring the new addition to the kitchen.
When friendship developed past partnership and the time clock at the Ministry, Draco felt Harry’s eyes on him in still new ways. Harry watching him as he slowly unbuttoned his shirt as he made his way to Harry’s large, comfortable looking bed. Harry eyeing him over tables at snooty restaurants as Draco slowly enjoyed whatever sumptuous meal he had ordered. Harry gazing up lustily at Draco as he attempted to swallow Draco’s cock.
Harry thought that it might be Snape. He thought he was close to the man’s office. It would just be perfect for the man to find him in this state. He probably wouldn’t even call Madam Pomfrey. If Harry’s mouth wasn’t so sore he would probably have laughed. He wondered what he would say for himself. “Sorry, but I can’t go one whole day around a group of people without them wanting to kill me”.
“I don’t know,” Millicent said innocently. “One moment he was trying to cast the levitation spell and the next his eyelid was trying to swell shut.”
“It was Snape,” Ron explained. “Hermione and I saw him, too. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you. Hermione was most of the way toward Snape when you made that daring leap.”
“You just don’t want to get food poisoning again,” Harry gave him a fond, placating look and Draco relinquished the pot.
The scar on Harry’s forehead seared with a sharp pain again. A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort surveyed the graveyard.
“Oooohhhh myyyy Merlin!!!!!” a shrill voice belonging to Tracey Davis echoed throughout the apartment.
“Then you would know that the castle is protected by more than just walls. There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And I’d like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They’re guarding every single entrance to the grounds. They’d have seen him fly in too. And Filch knows all the secret passages, they’ll have them covered…..”
“Three days,” answered Dumbledore. Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what
“No!” cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs, and pulling out her wand. A moment later with a loud snapping noise Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blonde hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.
“Punishment?” Fudge blinked. “Oh, dear boy, we’re not going to punish you for a little thing like that!” cried Fudge. “It was an accident. We’d be quite busy if we sent everyone to Azkaban who accidentally blew up one of their family members.”
They had missed the sorting, but thankfully, not the food. After another summer with the Dursleys, he would be grateful to be on whole, steady meals again.
Millicent nodded, this was her foray. “Harry, you take the place of that bishop. Hermione you go there instead of that castle.”
I'm not sure if I still believe in the concept of soulmates as I once did, but I still bear a mark of my belief. I can only hope that another bears the same.
Harry nodded, understanding now. “The three and only loves of my life. And when I say, Mr. Potter, that I would do anything to keep them happy and safe and whole, I mean anything. Blaise told me about what transpired after the events of last year.”
Harry had been presented a green and silver Slytherin kit before the task. It had been taken into Hermione and Millicent’s hands immediately just to make sure that it was “just right” in time for the first task.
“Absolutely not,” said Madam Pomfrey, scooting him to the door as Dumbledore gave a significant look to Hermione. She nodded like he had just given her specific instructions as Madam Pomfrey and the others vanished from the room.
“I….I did, as a matter of fact,” said Lupin. “We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry, perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced….I shouldn’t have even suggested this.”
“You called, Severus? I was just grading papers after that staff meeting we had,” said Lupin mildly.
Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King’s Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.
“On my whistle, Harry and Cassius!” said Bagman. “3,2,1…” After a short blast of the whistle, Harry and Warrington ran into the maze. Harry’s chosen path seemed completely deserted, Warrington having split off at a fork some way back.
“You can’t play minus a player, Flint,” said Wood. “And you don’t have an alternate, and you simply cannot play with that leg even if Pomfrey came down right now. Just forget it and we can reschedule.”
“No, Mr. Malfoy, your soulmate doesn’t feel a thing.” Draco nodded to the man, and then allowed himself to close his eyes. His pain and Harry’s name mingling in his mind as the sleeping charm took effect.
Any Slytherins who had been on his side since the match had since turned on him, even Malfoy hadn’t escaped the stigma of losing them so many house points. The only people in the school who seemed to tolerate Harry and his friends were the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws who had enough points now that the race for the House Cup was now between the two of them.
His job was to hand towels to players, to fetch them water, and basically be the mule that carried whatever it was the players happened to have need of. Harry knew he was decent on a broom, but his team was stout.
Quirriell, and Dumbeldore himself did something of course….” He ticked their names off on his fingers.
“What part of keep yourself in peak physical condition don’t you understand, Potter? The last I checked getting body checked by a dementor wasn’t that?”
Harry read the sign to himself. State of the art racing broom, superfine handle of ash, top speed 150 miles an hour, Price upon request.
A horrified look came across Ron’s face, but Millicent barked out a laugh before quieting when she looked over at the sleeping Professor.
“The Champions, and you are one, Potter, and their date start the ball with a dance. It’s traditional.”
“So you found someone to consort with even lower than the Weasleys did you, Potter?” drawled the voice that haunts Harry’s dreams.
“No,” said Millicent. “We have more than just your hunches. We have some proof that Snape is up to something shady. We just need to figure out what he wants, and just what that dog is protecting.”
“But sir,” Harry interrupted. “What about my punishment? The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.”
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small fond laugh. “Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here…ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!”
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Harry stepped carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, holding up his lamp to read the titles.
“Somethings wrong, Hermione….” It was Ron Weasley’s broken voice. Then quietly, “Love, its…..” Then. “Get to St. Mungos, please.” Harry apparated them out of the Ministry before the last syllable was uttered in Ron Weasley’s broken voice.
Approaching him in between classes when the Slytherins had a break was probably his best option. Blaise lurked around the hall as Harry waited to grab Malfoy.
Then Millicent, “It’s a tea that used to be given to really hyper children. Their parents noticed that when they gave them the tea the kids would quiet down, but when they overused it, the kids were worse than ever. They would flip out at the most simple things and go into a downright panic when anything so much as startled them. After those discoveries the use of the tea was banned from the ministry.”
“I know you didn’t like her, but I owe it to her to wait until she can join Vernon, and….and Du…..” Harry stops. He can feel himself starting to get emotional, and he doesn’t want Aunt Petunia to see him cry.
It didn't take much time for him to track her down. She was sitting on that bench from earlier, blocked by the trees. He got to her - shoved a bunch of third years out of his way - and just stood there, silent.
“Well, Ron, tell me. What does Harry think?" Hermione spat the words and looked at him so fiercely, that this time he did flinch.
"But you knew!" Hermione cried out and finally looked at him as she snapped. Her face was wet with tears and her eyes red and filled with embarrassment. "You knew. Everyone did. I was the only one dense enough to not see that I am delusional."
He found her pretty quickly, with him being the tallest wizard around and her being a walking head of hair. He grabbed her by the hand and made her turn around. (Which completely backfired because her hair was like a thousand whips smacking his chest)
After Hermione's apparation test and Ron's temporary illness, they get into a seriuos discussion that everyone saw coming but the two of them.
Ron didn't answer. He couldn't think of anything to say for himself, mainly because he was not sure what he was being accused of.
Hermione uncrossed her arms and started walking quickly away, and right there and then, Ron’s heart broke. She seemed so hurt. By him. He couldn't stand the thought of himself making her this upset. He was the good one! Or at least he was supposed to be.
"I told you it would work" Hermione said as she lightly slammed their glasses on the table. They were both full of warm butterbeer, and Ron waited for about a second before attacking his, leaving a foam mustache on his upper lip. "Thank you, 'Mione. Saved my life."
“Well, apparently everyone has an opinion in the matter, don't they? So tell me, what do other people think about the one thing you don't even talk to me about, huh? I’m just eager to know.”
Ron stared at Hermione for a second, then smiled lightly. He bent down to meet her face. "There's no wood"
“I don't want to hear what you have to say for yourself.” Hermione said without looking up from the ground.
"Look, If anyone should be sorry it's me. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be getting bullied by those… vultures.” Ron knew Lavender and her possy never liked Hermione to begin with, but the last few days things must have been even worse for her. “Bullied? Please, I don't even bother listening to them.” Hermione said lightly, but Ron saw her reaction earlier. He could tell that they got to her, no matter how much she tried to rise above it.
“Too bad my servant wanted to have too much fun, playing with you and your little boyfriend, that one will be the first to go,” Voldemort cooed, the rest of his followers shaking in agreement.
The music shifted, and while some people changed partners Harry’s only pulled him closer. Their bodies were so close to one another’s that a sheet of parchment couldn’t fit between them. The man’s lips ghosted over Harry’s neck and along his jawline, and Harry had to remind himself that this person was a stranger.
If only you knew, Harry thought at Mafoy. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, and led it to his side. Draco looked into his eyes, and Harry nearly burst into tears because he knew what would be there. In his dream, he had felt his mark burn almost like it was branding itself anew onto his skin, but it was not Harry’s skin that the mark was reappearing on. It was Draco’s.
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard them. Professor McGonagall, Snape, and Quirrel came bursting into the room. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall looked angrier than Harry had ever seen her. She looked from Harry to Millicent to a still awe struck looking Hermione.
Harry paused the trio as they approached the meeting point. He had been expecting something, but it surely wasn’t this. Professor McGonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.
Harry blinked away some mist that had gathered in his eyes, and Draco refused the urge to reach out a hand to him.
“I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. “Here, you’ve earned a drink, something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have tried it before…”
“Right then,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing around them. “Let’s do this in pairs, as there are so many of us,” he added. “I’ll go through first with Harry.”
“Well?” said Snape again. “this parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?”
“That woman is horrible. She’s not teaching us anything, and the more that we try and question her the more she makes us do imbecilic tasks. We had to copy from the textbook today, Harry. COPY FROM THE TEXTBOOK!”
“Perhaps you should contact Cassius’s parents before you taint him with anymore lies. Or at least send an Owl to Gringotts,” said Harry. Harry moved past Ely’s still disheveled form.
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”
His voice was casual, but Harry couldn’t help noticing that Mr. Weasley’s ears had gone red, just like Ron’s did when he was under pressure. Millicent looked at him from the corner of her eye, and he could tell that she, too, thought something else wasn’t right.
“You know how she is, Luna, she’s…she’s got an odd sense off humor.” More like an odd sense of the truth, Draco thought.
Everyone seemed to have their dates. Even Warrington with…Ely? Harry had wondered at first if they had just gone as friends until Warrington had bravely and quite proudly pulled his very handsomely dressed date into his arms and kissed him to the shock and awe of quite a few. Pansy however looked as if this was old news.
“Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at this one, From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.
Harry looked to Blaise, but seeing his hesitancy and Hagrid’s pleading look, Harry stepped forward. “I’ll do it,” said Harry.
Harry made sure to make up with Blaise as well. Blaise had been there when Snape had tried to buck him off his broom, and he hadn’t told anyone about the cloak. And Harry didn’t want to lose him as a friend, and was relieved when after a while things seemed to go back to normal. He wasn’t as outspoken or as brash as Millicent, but he was beginning to open up to him despite Malfoy and his crew still bent on either ignoring or teasing Harry at every available opportunity.
They also passed Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played seeker for Ravenclaw. She waved and smiled at Harry and as Harry raised his hand to wave back, water splashed all over his front as Millicent clapped him hard on the back.
ready to be his second in an underage wizard’s duel, and had snuck out of bed to warn Harry and the others that Malfoy as trying to pull something and Harry didn’t want him to think he saw him as anything other than a great friend.
Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes.
Up in the astronomy tower with Ginny’s head between her legs, Luna smiled, glad that the two of them finally seemed like they were going to figure it out.
“Watch it, Potter. I’m giving you a chance to trade up, Longbottom and Weasley for some real friends, friends that will actually be able to help you in the future. Do you think Millicent or Blaise will stand with you when the going
“It’s my rat,” he told the witch. “He’s been a bit off color ever since I brought him back from Egypt.”
He would no longer be able to reach out to Harry at night when he felt the other man toss and turn with a head full of demons. He wouldn’t be able to reach out through their link and calm the other man. He would no longer be able to fight with him. They couldn’t be partners or fight together. He wouldn’t’ be able to watch out for him or to take pain away. After this he would mean nothing to Harry. More impossible, Harry would have to mean nothing to him. After this, Draco’s claim would be tossed aside. And they would each be on their own.
Yet, Harry couldn’t get his dream out of his mind. Voldemort hadn’t been alone there, he had been talking to someone….plotting Harry’s death.
“That one,” he called to the others. “Millicent go for it from above, Hermione get it from that side, and I’ll try to catch it. Right, GO!!!!”
