and opened the door to his office. Apparently the climate spell was glitching again; shortly after midnight, and the sun was shining. He closed the blind and the gaslights around the room lit automatically.
“Healer Black,” she said, as Parvati let him into her office. “Was there a problem with the Portkey?”
“It’s very, very easy to hate someone forever,” she said, pouring cream into a bowl. “Much too easy. It’s hard to forgive them and impossible to forget the things they’ve done. What’s harder still is to stand up and acknowledge all of the hardest parts, the worst of someone… and love them anyway.” She flicked her wand and a beater leapt up to whip the cream.
Draco felt a now-familiar flare of irritation, and he stayed quite a while longer.
It was to be one of

good long time, and then abruptly sat up. “What are you going to do with Kreacher?”
He stretched out on the bed, and imagined Draco at his side.
“You love it,” Harry said, laughing. “Come on, Floo time. I want to take you home and keep you awake into the small hours of the morning. Best ask Rubino to pop in with snacks later.”
He saw Katie Bell, heard the way she’d screamed. The dazed expression on her face when Draco had used the
Yes. This was very, very inconvenient.
“I got a variety,” Harry said, waving at the ridiculous spread. “I never know what I’m going to want until it’s in front of me.” He sat on the floor with his back against the couch and reached for a pakora, dipping it in a spicy raita. He looked at the television rather than Draco. Draco was too easy to look at and the TV was a rotten distraction, but he made a valiant attempt.
Still it made his blood boil. He clenched his jaw, but smiled beneficently when the woman turned back for one last scowl.
He glanced up as the great hall filled with owls. It would never cease to be extraordinary to him.
“Harry?”
“Yes, I really do hate you.”
“So he saved your life,” he said.
Hermione and Blaise turned to look at Draco, emerging from the kitchen. He looked tired, Hermione thought. In fact, they both looked a little unhappy, and Hermione fought to keep the smile on her face.
“Do you think,” Draco said, his expression torn, “that we should — I don’t know, make a pot of tea? Talk a while?”
Harry sat on the stone bench in the courtyard and gently petted the stray cat who had recently decided she enjoyed his company. She ate a tin of sardines and purred in his lap for a while before heading off to chase butterflies, leaving Harry to his tea.
, he thought, but didn’t say.
And then he tossed the parchment aside, rolling his eyes at himself.
She swallowed a sob, and raised her glass. Harry did the same, and the gentle chime felt incredibly important, the bell-like sound shifting the mood from somber to something far more hopeful. She took a deep breath, and let it out, and gave Harry a smile. It wasn’t an easy one, but it was a real one.
Harry poked Draco’s ribs, mean as a snake. “You’re really alright with this, though? I do feel like I… talked you into it. Just a bit.”
He managed, this time, to make his way across the grounds and exit through the gate. The cool air was so jarring, and so pleasant, so crisp and real — like a cold apple in the middle of the spring — that Harry walked for almost two hours before he apparated back to the castle.
know. His eyes were open, darting from Draco’s eyes to his mouth as they broke the kiss again, clutching at his hip, his other hand slipping from Draco’s forearm to his upper arm, to his shoulder, to his neck, into his hair, bringing Draco closer and making him groan with need.
“You old flirt,” Draco said, languidly. “Yours. I’ll bring the wine.” And his nose was back in his book, and Harry returned to his food, and pretended that Neville wasn’t boring a hole into the side of his head with that look.
Except the tiny branch had the most wonderfully responsive feeling, in his hand. It seemed to be warm, almost. Harry laid it down alongside one of Crookshanks’ whiskers.
Draco raised an eyebrow and looked pointedly at his shaking hands. “So I see.” He sighed. “Alright, let’s try something more specific. Any muscle weakness?”
“Thank you for that, Neville. I can always rely on you to state the bloody obvious.”
something to you?”
“I do try. Problem is they’ve read far too much of your press by the time they get here. See you at lunch, Scarhead?”
In the late afternoon Draco resolved that if Harry didn’t wake soon, Draco would wake him. At least to see that he could stand on his own, and walk, and to find out how much he remembered. To eat, and to have a cup of tea, the almighty British healer of all things. But fretting, he kept putting it off, until a shuffling step and a click of the door startled him, and Draco turned around.
“No, you did,” Harry said, and he had a hand on Draco’s arm before he could think it through. Right over the Dark Mark. He pulled away again, slowly, embarrassed.
“You’re fucking amazing, Luna. D’you know that?”
. I had so many howlers on the second day that my ears were ringing for days — almost as many as Headmaster McGonagall.”
“Day off,” Draco murmured into his warm shoulder.
Hermione had won, of course, and she, Ron and Harry all returned to Hogwarts in the autumn to finish their NEWTs. Eighth year students from all houses shared a common room, and a strange collection of bedrooms (singles, doubles, a dormitory; strangely well arranged, actually, and it turned out that everybody’s preference fit precisely within the odd collection). There were fewer students than Harry had thought there might be, and only two Slytherins. They kept themselves to themselves for the first two weeks but after a relentless campaign of inclusion by Hermione they had conceded defeat by the end of the third.
“It should be. It’s a very old bottle.”
“That was surprisingly incisive,” Hermione said.
Hermione nodded as she collected ingredients from the fridge. “Yes. You know, he’s much better as an analyst than in the field.” She sounded a little anxious. She had to know she’d been found out.
“What is your best feature?” Draco sounded genuinely curious.
“Auror training,” Ron said.
“Thank you,” he said. He opened his mouth again, as if to say something else, but shovelled a mouthful of peas into it instead.
“Thank you,” Potter said, raising the bottle in his hand. “I mean it.”
“Oh,” Hermione said. “Yes. Well, I’ll have him brought here in the morning.”
“First of all — no non-verbal magic, and no wandless magic. It’s not fair on the children. They can’t do it. Most of them have no chance whatsoever of ever mastering either of those things, so seeing it won’t teach them a thing.”
“I’d pass those on, but he has a big enough head as it is,” Potter said, and he peeled off toward the second-floor classrooms. He was walking straighter. He looked almost as if he had combed his hair, but that was probably Draco’s unfounded streak of optimism speaking.
“You’re still as pig-headed as ever, and you’ve made up your mind what you’ll do. You’re not interested in my advice, or my rather expert opinion. So why would I argue?”
Harry shrugged helplessly. “I don’t know what to do,” he said. “I keep thinking I should call a Healer. Or Pansy. Or Blaise, I don’t know. Someone. He’s doing better than he was, but I still don’t know why he’s here, and I can’t help him except by… I don’t know. Food, shelter, clothes.”
“The elf will. He knows what he’s doing, love.”
“Well, he did,” Ron said. “And I think he’s right. I decided to become an Auror because Harry was, too. But I think you might have been right, Harry.”
Draco frowned. Or… whatever is slightly meaner than a frown, he did that.
“I can almost hear the cogs in your mind moving,” Hermione said, leaning forward, elbows on her knees. “Please, talk to me, Harry. You have plans.”
She nodded. “I think so. Or he will be. Good gracious, Harry, he would have died. I’ve never seen this before, never seen such a malicious…” He turned away and left her to her fussing.
Ron laughed. “You’re not nearly as stuck-up as I thought you might be. Nah, Harry and Hermione never… I mean, I don’t think Harry ever really…”
“Why?”
“I think I’m going to bed. Goodnight.” And he stood up stiffly and formally, Auror Potter once again, and Hermione’s heart hurt. He was heading for the stairs, but turned around to speak once again.
“We’re not children anymore, Potter. But I shall dream up some stingers for when you’ve slept more than six hours in a week. I hope you didn’t lose your edge in the DMLE. Do you still spend a lot of time with Weasley? Because if your comeback for everything is ‘well so’s your mum’ I shall be very disappointed. As will Mother.”
Harry’s lips brushed over Draco’s hair. “You didn’t. I shared it. Not on purpose, but… I suppose it was just… a magical night,” he said quietly.
“And you can’t tell my boss, right?”
“I trust him,” she said. “Look at this, Ron. The things we went through — and then the things Harry went through on his own.” She recognised the discomfort on Ron’s face. He didn’t like thinking about these things. He never had. What he’d done with his entire life wasn’t dissimilar to what Harry had done in his head. He hadn’t come through unscathed, but he wasn’t drowning in it, either.
Harry found himself smiling. “Perfectly adequate?”
Draco clenched his teeth.
“That was a lovely speech,” Harry said, after a long moment, pretending his mouth wasn’t dry and his muscles hadn’t tightened across his entire body. “Do you have a point?”
He saw the moment of uncertainty on Draco’s face, and he recognised it for what it was; everything that Draco had, everything he’d achieved, he’d achieved by being someone else, Guaritore Christopher Black. If it took Harry the rest of their lives to convince him that Draco Malfoy deserved to be loved exactly as he was — well, then, Harry was up to that task.
“I just heard a few of my students calling you ‘that Gryffindor git’,” he said, and Harry managed a smile. “I mean, I suppose they could have been talking about another Gryffindor git, there are always a few about.”
He set the sauce aside, and raised his glass.
“When are you going to get married?” he asked.
One of Harry’s t-shirts caught his eye. It had somehow made its way into Draco’s side of the wardrobe, and it fit like… a clue, really.
“It was Draco. He’s playing guitar in a punk band. Or was, I suppose.” He reached for his coffee mug, but only turned it in his hand. “I was doing my best to talk an aspiring writer into bed, and suddenly there was Draco up on stage covered in tattoos and with his hair almost shaved off. Playing the guitar. I talked to him afterwards, or tried to… and he broke my nose. That was the last time I saw him, until he showed up asking for my help.”
“Usually. It’s been strange not wearing it as much, the last few months. There are people who know who I am. Professor Piedemonte. A couple of others. He’s not interested in who was on the wrong side of the war. Only in what people do now. It’s refreshing. I still think I’d probably be on the receiving end of an entrails-expelling curse if I showed my face in Diagon Alley anytime in the next century or two.”
“Marry me,” Blaise said. He had a box in his hand, Hermione saw, as she turned around. The ring inside resembled a tight coil of ivy with wide, healthy leaves, the dewdrops thereupon tiny pearls of light. “I know there’s a part of you that wants to tell me to wait, and ask again when Harry is alright. And that’s why I’m asking
Moments later Harry handed her a branch with five satisfyingly glossy green leaves, which began to sprout flowers as soon as she took it.
“At least once more, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said, unconsciously trying to press his hair into submission.
“Son of Salazar,” Draco swore. He stood staring at the door for a long moment, and then heard the unmistakable sound of one of the portraits clearing his throat. He glanced up at Severus Snape, and tried not to glower. “Oh, leave it, Sev,” he said, his eyes narrowed. “I know what you’re thinking. I know what you want to say.”
He didn’t tell her not to cry. He didn’t tell her it wasn’t her fault. He didn’t try to tell her what he’d been through, though she was suddenly desperate to know. He just let her cry. And when she was done, and her eyes were burning, and she was so embarrassed that she thought she might die, Draco carefully pulled away.
“No, really. Will you go and find a couple of bottles of wine? I need to talk to you both, and there’s garlic bread in the oven and risotto on the stove, and I think a nice bottle of celebratory white wine would be perfect. I promise not to let you get drunk.”
“Mate,” Ron said. “Me and George are making you an alarm clock for your birthday. The loudest one you ever heard of.” Mocking. But so relieved to see Harry that he was shaking a little, even as they held each other. At least until the girls started screaming ‘Uncle Harry’ and, still a bit too weak to lift them both the way they were used to Harry crouched on the ground for a very squirmy hug.
“I don’t need this much room,” he said, his voice sounding rather panicked.
Harry wanted to die.
“Now, Harry,” Neville said, after he’d thanked him for the drinks. “Just so’s you know —”
“And your handwriting doesn’t at all look like you dropped a handful of spiders into an inkwell and let them run all over the page.”
“I meant
And then Harry realised, abruptly, that he’d never learned himself. So he waited, and he asked for a lesson, paid the man some Muggle money (he’d always been proficient across the different systems, despite the ridiculous arithmetic) and gave it a shot.
What would happen next — well, fuck. No one could really predict these things. Draco brushed Harry’s hair away from his forehead, and kissed it. And then he pressed his own forehead against Harry’s, so he could taste Harry’s breath, feel the weakening hum of his magic.
The days got longer, and warmer. Spring sprung, bringing with it flowers and new life, the promise of children coming home from Hogwarts for the summer, long days swimming at the shore. Ron and Hermione had talked about going on a holiday, and would he come with them? (Maybe. As long as it was early in the season, long before the children started shopping for wands.) Since January, Harry had been on four dates with very nice men, enjoyed their company and known right away that there was nothing more to it. He’d spent an additional four nights in Muggle London, intending each time to find someone fun to go home with, and each time, he’d gone home alone.
He pulled an old, broken teacup from his pocket. A Portkey, apparently. A whirl of light and shadow, and he was gone.
“Er,” Harry said.
When she arrived, they embraced hard. “It’s been too long,” Hermione said, and Ginny agreed.
The letter read.
Hermione climbed unsteadily to her feet as the elf apparated before the hearth.
There were parts of the manor that were still grimly clinging to life. The beginnings of a couple of staircases that now ascended to nowhere and a fireplace along with a significant part of its chimney still somewhat intact. But for the most part, the manor had been razed. There was nothing about it that felt dead, though.
It seemed so strange now to remember that they had barely shared a single word in six years at school. He loved her. In a way he had never imagined he could love anyone. Every aspect of Hermione was wonderful, to Blaise; her confidence and her uncertainty, her power and her vulnerability, her extraordinary intelligence and her boundless curiosity. She seemed to remember everything she had ever read or heard, but remained skeptical of everything until she had some kind of corroboration or proof. She could command a room or his lap with equal gravitas.
Hermione watched as a gentle breeze ripple across the dark rocks, making the flowers bob and dance. She would bring Malfoy back here when the Spring was in full swing and let him see what he had created.
“Potter has
Draco nodded. “I’d like to arrange for some work to be done there. I want it clean, repainted, and fit to live in by the time I wake Harry up.”
“This is your home,” she said, very simply. “I think it’s good that you want to stay here. And you should come and go from my home as you please.”
“Harry — you
he felt — Sirius’s magic still clinging in places. On top of the dresser a coffee mug with a broken handle held all of the feathers that Buckbeak had left behind. The permanent sticking charms on the Muggle posters didn’t bother Harry one bit; in fact, he had carefully stuck some equally wonky frames around them and quite liked the effect.
“What happened?” Ron asked, incredulous. “She was in good shape for a, for a — well, she didn’t look like she was going to keel over and die. And they were on house arrest, being waited on hand and foot by the elves, right? Not like she…”
“And the others? The Tuscany house, and the one in France —”
She saw the problem at once, and laid a hand on Harry’s shoulder, mimicking his wandwork with the other hand an joining in chanting the counter-curse. Madame Pomfrey placed a cooling compress on Malfoy’s forehead, fretting loudly, though Harry found himself able to ignore her in favour of concentrating on his task.
Draco rolled his eyes in the most dramatic fashion he could muster, given that he was feeling quite cheerful. “Grumbling slows healing, does it then?”
off. Or a decade. Or that I don’t want you ever working again, and you can mooch around in your pyjamas all day and… I don’t know. Paint. Design brooms. Read your way through the Western canon, if you like, though I’ve never taken you for much of a reader. You can wrap your ridiculous octopus arms around me and refuse to let me get out of bed in the mornings, and I’ll let you. I’ll grumble about it, though. You’ll know… you’ll know I don’t mean it.”
just Stun and Body-Bind me for a few hours. You could listen to yourself talk, I wouldn’t be forced to listen to you talk, and I’d finally get a little sleep.”
“I’d forgotten what it’s like,” he said. He didn’t turn to look at Harry, he just stared. Of course, a rock guitarist — or whatever it was that Draco referred to himself as — probably didn’t bother with Christmas decorations. Harry walked silently past the counter and stood by Draco.
“I’ve been in love with Luna Lovegood since she brought me a pocket full of dirigible plum seeds,” Neville said, with a sigh. “She’d cleaned them up, and all, and showed me how to sprout them. But I’ve never even asked her to tea. I only see her when Harry has a party…”
He waited until the door closed, and turned back to Blaise.
Harry grinned. “Come off it, Draco. I need another teacher to help, and you can’t deny, we duelled brilliantly. We’re so different. You’re so agile and sneaky, and that’s really the only thing that works against…”
“Yes, that’s what I said. Perfectly adequate.” He smiled, and cupped his face in her hands. “You don’t need to have been raised well. You don’t need to know about salad forks or how to dance. You don’t need to have this extraordinary magic rippling off you. You’re perfectly adequate.”
“Harry’s worst memory. It’s not a secret, Hermione. We were all there. All four of us. You remember. I know you remember.”
“Or what? You would have cancelled? You don’t owe me a thing, Potter.”
Of course. Draco sounded like he was reporting society gossip and Hermione felt a brief ripple of irritation. They didn’t have a rather more urgent conversation to be getting on with — though she supposed she had been the one to raise the topic.
“You are very, very good at your job, Harry.”
free, darling. And to try to have a little fun this weekend, won’t you?”
“Alright,” Mrs Malfoy said. “Come in.”
“What are you doing?”
The day after Harry’s birthday (which had been a very quiet affair indeed, the occasion marked by a handful of extra tears but also one of Molly’s carrot cakes) Hermione opened the kitchen window for an owl, and accepted a copy of the Daily Prophet. By the time she found Ron and Harry, she was white as a sheet.
Harry grinned. “Are you nearing the end of this list, or do I need to get a quill and parchment?”
“Do you need a reply?” he asked.
“Certainly, Auror —”
“My father loved me,” Draco reminded her bluntly. “That didn’t make him any less of a bastard, in the end, did it? Yes, Dumbledore was thinking of the whole world instead of just Harry, and perhaps he didn’t even have a choice. It’s not one I think I could ever trust myself to make. But when in his life has anyone put Harry first? Ever? He doesn’t even do that for himself, the sodding Gryffindor git.”
“I’m not sure I’ve ever been so alright,” Harry said. He could feel the smile stretching over his face, and he felt lighter than air. “Now, let’s go. Did I tell you that you look very pretty tonight, Minister Granger?”
“I knew it was him. I’d know him anywhere,” he spat.
“Indeed,” she replied, giving him a shrewd look.
He apparated to Grimmauld Place to change into more casual clothes, and more importantly, to pick up his experimental little wand. On Sunday, he had lovingly sanded and then oiled it carefully to bring out the shine, and he wanted to show Ollivander.
Harry grinned widely.
Firewhiskey.”
Hermione froze, and turned her head.
Draco hesitated. “He’s my patient,” he answered primly. “I care for all of them. Goodbye, Minister.”
“I didn’t grow up in Azkaban — I grew up in a cupboard under the stairs. I was marginally raised by an aunt and uncle who hated and feared me. Your vicious barbs in the Great Hall are dead on, because they were never great fans of having to feed me, either, and if I didn’t finish what little was on my plate before my cousin finished his own feast, he’d finish it for me. I am very happy for you that you enjoy your posh wallpaper and your beautiful old furniture but I don’t have those sorts of expectations of life. I prefer to focus on my work. Now, if you’re feeling better —”
“I know.” Hermione ran her finger along the timeline again. “The troll in the dungeon, in First Year?”
“I think I slept strangely,” Draco said.
An errant curled bounced lightly over Draco’s eye, and Harry wanted to tuck it behind his ear. So instead, he stuck his ridiculous hands in his pockets.
“Why not?”
a Death Eater.”
“I’ll call his lawyers,” she said at last. “You mustn’t grieve too terribly, Harry, he had a very full life and he knew what was coming.”
“I thought you’d call when you read the paper!”
He turned to Harry, holding it in his hand.
“The house looks amazing,” Blaise said, when he’d recovered, draping his cloak on a hat stand and looking around. “Have you finished, then? Want to show me around?”
“Fuck, that was hot,” Draco said, as Harry backed him into the bed, smiling against his mouth.
And now Harry was back at Hogwarts again — after years where the nightmares only came every few months — and they were back in full force. Arrangements had been made to release any ghosts that wanted to go; Harry had been surprised at the time that Nearly Headless Nick and Peeves had gone onto whatever was next. Rowena Ravenclaw tended to stay out of the way, and Harry had barely seen her a half dozen times in all of his years at Hogwarts. There were two new child ghosts that Harry couldn’t even bear to think about; they seemed to hover near the kitchens as if hoping for an extra cauldron cake or a mug of Butterbeer, and Harry wasn’t entirely sure they knew they were dead.
Right now, she had three fingers of Dwarvish Scotch in a crystal tumbler for him. He smiled, and took the glass, and rubbed her head the way she liked. She preened, and wandered away, smoothing down the skirt of her pretty dress.
“What’s this, Draco?”
It was one of the writers that Harry decided to hone in on. He stood too close, looked at the man’s mouth more often than was proper, and asked sensible questions about his
Harry had been staying with Hermione for almost three weeks, the day she came home to find Crookshanks tense and flabbergasted by the arrival of a Kneazle kitten of dubious origin and odd colouring, and the house smelling like a rich, peppery stew. Three weeks. He hadn’t yet said anything about going back to work, and she didn’t want to ask. He had spent time with the Weasleys, who still got together on Sundays, as many of them as could gather. He’d talked to strangers in coffee shops. And he’d cooked so much and so well that Hermione was starting to think she’d need to start letting out her robes.
“He only uses his bedroom,” Draco said. “I don’t think he’s set foot in the rest of the house in years.”
Hermione checked the clock approximately every six seconds, which did absolutely nothing to make the time pass any faster. Draco was due at noon, and it was already eleven minutes past, and she was fretting. All she ever really seemed to do was fret, these days. It didn’t matter that Harry was getting the best possible care. He was so far away. She couldn’t sit at his bedside in the evenings and talk to him, and she still wasn’t sure she could trust Malfoy to do that. Talk to him. Be kind.
Fear came, and he acknowledged it, and let it go, which wasn’t easy but he was learning.
Harry sighed. “It’s just…” He waved in the general direction of, well,
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Neville said, evenly. “I don’t. I haven’t even heard his name since his mum died.”
He gave the little girl gripping Pansy’s hand a smile, but she was too busy staring at the mountain of wands to notice him.
Harry’s lip curled into a small smile. Here they were; this was a step. Draco needed to know that Harry trusted him.
Harry stood up. “I’d better go,” he said. “You, too, if you’re going to make your film. What are you seeing?”
“No, Hermione. I’m not his medical proxy. It’s not the same thing at all.”
Everyone helped, in their way. Molly cooked too much food and baked a great deal of bread. It was only days later than Arthur Weasley told Hermione very quietly that Molly had been the one to end Bellatrix’s life. The two women had left, mysteriously, that afternoon, and returned with red eyes and some kind of new and profound understanding. The nightmares, though. They stayed.
Harry dressed in his formal robes.
“Oh, I… Harry. I can’t — oh, this wretched bump! Help me, would you?” Hermione was trying to climb through the window, gravid and lovely, and Harry avoided making a crass comment about how the roof may not hold her. He only laughed, as he helped her settle.
“Please, Harry.” Draco stepped closer. He seemed taller, suddenly, or else Harry was shorter. Something. No, he was shorter — shorter, and skinny, and his glasses seemed to be doing their best to fall off his face. He pushed them further up the bridge of his nose, and pulled away again.
“You poor sod,” Draco said, at last, turning away. “Adored by millions. Free chocolate all the time. What a burden to bear. Next time the world needs saving, I’ll do it. Neville, you’ll help, won’t you?”
didn’t seem to have faded much since school. But in almost twenty years working as a Healer Draco had never seen anyone with so many scars.
“Harry, then. I know you are ready to mount a dragon and fly back to the office to work yourself into another coma but I am the Healer, here, and I insist that you spend some time recovering. I’ll send for Hermione in a day or two.”
“Of course we will,” Hermione said, wiping her eyes. “But right now, I need to do some hard work so I don’t spend the whole day crying.” And that was what they did.
He leapt from his stool, and stood before her, wringing his hands.
“Learning all of his secrets,” he said at last, his voice dull and tired.
He was blessed to be a part of this; and if it was all he’d ever have, it would still be a blessing.
Harry sighed dramatically. “Well, you remember. Sixth year. Remember how I followed you around. Fucking pathetic, really. And I followed you out of the Great Hall, and I found you in the bathroom.”
But maybe he had. Harry could have counted on one hand the number of people who had touched him intimately since he and Ginny had broken up, what felt like a thousand years ago.
“If that’s a Boggart,” he said loudly, “I shall be cross.”
Draco took a deep breath, and reminded himself — in his mother’s voice, no less — that he was from a very long line of pureblood wizards and knew how to comport himself. He stopped at Potter’s shoulder. Maybe Potter had grown up, after all. He looked tired, he looked… he looked like a man who’d barely survived a war, is what he looked like, and as Draco knew what that was like he couldn’t begrudge him the shadows under the eyes.
“Well, I don’t know,” she said. “I was going to say ‘elephant’ but that sounds so Muggle-ish. We’ve been in this world for so long. It’s hard to think about the old one.”
“I take back what I said about you having the upper body strength of a Cornish pixie,” he murmured against the swell of Draco’s bicep. He was all lean muscle, not like Harry’s own bulk, but confidently strong, and elegant.
feel. I wanted him to make me feel the way his
“Alright. So, Blaise Zabini, since I don’t think you’re here to ask me to be your Best Man, or join the Department of Mysteries — what

one thing, Draco, and I did it when I was seventeen years old. D’you know that?”
“Because I had nowhere else to go,” Draco said at last, and took a long pull off his beer.
Ginny closed her eyes, and sighed. “I can’t believe you thought you needed me for this.”
It was almost an hour later that Harry stoppered the bottle. He put it aside, and reached for Malfoy’s hand; it seemed thin, dehydrated, but the normal colour. No further tendrils of magic invaded his wrist, or his arm, and in truth even his face looked more peaceful.
Draco held his gaze, waiting.
making great strides towards accepting that things couldn’t be the same again.
lead, and you can just follow.” He brought Harry closer, and Harry was powerless to resist.
Harry didn’t have the heart to tell Ron he’d never liked it all that much, just, Ron loved it, and Harry had taken a long time to get over the thrill of having a friend, someone who wanted to spend time with him.
“Then I will,” he replied. “Early tomorrow. It’s at its most beautiful at sunrise.”
“I hope it was better than mine.” Harry flushed again. “I mean — better than my unconscious mind’s idea for how to get a day off,” he corrected.
“I’m sure I don’t know,” Draco said. “You can go. Please tell Auror Lisbon to join me in twenty minutes.”
“Oh, yes — gosh, Harry. You should have seen that. Have you read the part; she wasn’t even working. She was on her way to meet friends at the Leaky Cauldron, and the next thing we know she’s calling for three stunned and body-bound burglars to be collected.”
“No, most of us learned shortly after we had mastered walking,” Draco said coolly, stepping closer. “You’re upset.”
“What, just because ex-Death Eaters hardly ever get secret love potions in the post? I’m perfectly happy with my cursed crystal balls and the occasional howler.”
“I don’t know if you can hear me. I don’t even know if you want to hear me. But if you can — I need you to focus. This is going to be fucking horrible, but we need to do it. I forgive you, you know. I do. I only hope I’ll know what to do, when… I hope I’ll know what to say. Fuck, I don’t even know if I can find you.
“Oh, please, Harry. It’s a good glamour, but your posture is unmistakable.”
Draco took a moment, and then shrugged, having apparently elected not to take offence.
Harry’s smile was small, but sure, and dazzling. “I’m well, thank you. I resigned from my job, you see. Several weeks ago.” His expression carried a mild apology but Draco wasn’t especially interested in an explanation for the long break. He knew Harry needed to be ready. And he knew, from the way he held Draco’s eyes unflinchingly that he was, indeed, ready.
Harry regarded the little girl. She was small, smaller than any of the girls who had come into the shop so far that day and most of the boys as well. She looked a lot like Pansy, without the bitter edges.
“Well, I don’t think he’s ready,” Hermione said.
Harry held his breath, and then forced himself to behave like a fucking adult. He slipped his hands into his pockets so he wouldn’t fidget. Draco looked as if he was struggling with something and Harry had made the last few weeks difficult enough.
“No problem,” Harry said, shaking hands with the two new elves in turn. “I’d be very happy to pay you all.” He didn’t argue, though, when Kreacher and Hennie pulled away with appalled expressions. “Did you three do all of this?”
“Topher,” said Luc, brushing ash from his leather pants. “I cannot believe you locked me out of your Floo.” He pouted for a moment, but his attention span was as short as his t-shirt was tight and soon he was stepping uncomfortably close. “We’re going dancing in Rome. Come with.”
No point in finishing
“Time to go and be adults, I suppose,” Harry said, reluctantly, but they both headed for the castle doors. Draco felt almost tipsy. Adrenaline, and joy, and the unfamiliar hum of Harry’s magic, which began to dissipate as they entered the warm castle.
“Got your knickers in a twist? Calm down, Potter, I have homework to mark as well.”
Asleep, Malfoy was even prettier to look at than he was when he was awake. His hair had darkened a little as he’d gotten older, and now it was a dirtier blond, long enough around his shoulders to pull back into a knot when he was so moved, and when free it curled gently around his face. His eyes were still the colour of an unquiet sea but they didn’t have the same anger in them, and that suited him very well.

Harry hadn’t wanted to compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. He’d begged to be excused, on account of his being

“Learning all of his secrets,” he said again, and knew that both answers were true.
magic the world changed so fundamentally. So, Hermione…?”
Harry grinned.
Christopher Black, since Draco Malfoy’s name is Death Eater mud, but beyond that… it was a coincidence, I promise. One I meant to keep secret and would have, without Minister Granger’s mysterious companion. Rather immune to Glamours.”
“Hello, Rubino,” she said. “Where are they?”
The hot water was a revelation, but his hand was a rather better one. He was furiously turned on, and hard as diamonds, and he couldn’t keep the moan in his throat as he fucked furiously into his fist, eventually spilling over his hand, hitting the wall of the shower in ropy splatters.
, Pansy. That’s my
Luna tugged him closer to the stream, and steered him towards a large rock that had apparently been soaking up the sun all day. They sat in silence for a while as the sunset pinked up the water, and Harry was amused to see the way fish, butterflies, and even a couple of birds drew near. Of course, this was Luna.
Rubino opened the door to Draco’s rooms. It seemed strange that he wouldn’t knock or announce himself, and Hermione wondered for a mad moment if Harry had leapt cheerfully from his coma and insisted that elf subservience was very thirteenth century and had to stop.
Harry startled, and his body was suddenly responsive. He pulled Draco near.
“That does bring me to a more salient topic, though. Harry’s head.”
So: being busy, staying busy, holding loved ones close and watching the Prophet for news of the trials meant that for most people, the nightmares began to fade.
He fastened his robes at his throat and walked straight-backed through the door to his quarters, locking it behind him, and opened the classroom door.
Harry cringed. “Draco — it’s me. Harry.”
,” Draco intoned. “
Hermione paled.
“I told you. A very comfortable guest room. Plenty of time to rest. Good food, the healing powers of the ocean — the air is warm and the water is cool, at this time of year. If it makes any difference to you… I work long hours. You would have the place to yourself, for the most part.”
Draco hesitated with his quill over the parchment.
Draco nodded. He paled. His eyes — how had they ever looked cold and calculating? They were warm and blue and much like shallow water at the beach on a warm day. So full of care. If Lucius had survived Azkaban, he wouldn’t have survived seeing his son become such a good and kind man. Harry’s mind ran a film reel: Draco gently coaxing him from some inescapable horror, Draco’s fingertips running over his skin in the morning sun. Curled up against Draco’s body, in front of the fireplace.
“Alright.” Draco looked… disappointed, maybe, or perhaps he was just thinking. “I had an idea, actually.”
Harry took a long shower, trying to keep away the feeling of doom. He made himself a cup of tea, and checked the guest room in case Draco had struggled to fall asleep with Harry wrapped around him like an octopus. Maybe he had left. With his magic back, maybe he’d disguised himself, and he’d be back with chocolate croissants and proper coffee any minute.
“Of course he did. But —”
“Hermione,” he replied, imitating her tone.
Draco woke up in an empty bed. He dragged himself out of it, reluctantly, knowing that Harry would be as skittish as a Cornish pixie. He dressed in neat, dark grey wool trousers, spent a long time considering his shirts and sweaters, and scratched his fingernails over his scalp.
Draco grinned wider. “Oh, I manage. I’ve charmed the mirror to remind me of how handsome I am while I do other things. Same time next week, Professor Potter?”
And then the world was sucked into nothing at all.
“There’s no rush, Harry. I don’t want you to come home and just wish yourself into a mystical coma again.”
“Draco, will you do me a favour? There must be a nice bar somewhere close by. Will you give me a break from my overprotective Unspeakable, take him for a drink while Harry and I catch up?” Hermione turned and fixed Blaise with her Minister Granger look. “I still have Parvati — please, Blaise.”
Harry learned that there was no one way to make a wand. The materials knew what they needed; the hum of this piece of walnut called for dragon heartstring, which would not be coaxed to slither into the bore. The wood needed to be halved, instead, the core carefully stretched until the end of it kissed the tip of the wand, and then the wood needed to be closed again, and made whole, healed gently with warm touch and deep oiling.
“Really, Draco, you are impossible.”
“You only need to try,” Draco said gently. “You need to start somewhere. If you feel ill, don’t finish. But you need to get your strength up, since, you know, you are feeling
“He just needs some help, is all,” Harry said, miserably. “I’m sure when he’s feeling better he’ll be off again.”
map.”
He found himself by the duck pond, and made his way to the little stand where the old Muggle man sold food that was good for ducks.
A shrug. Lucas? Was it Lucas? Harry hadn’t been paying enough attention. “A couple of times.”
And then Duelling Club, after a Monday that seemed to go on forever. At least as entertaining as the one the week before, particularly when Harry (perhaps deliberately) flubbed his Shield Charm and Draco hit him with a dancing jinx and a laughing jinx in quick succession. He wasn’t even embarrassed when he hit the ground, still shaking, and sat up to tell them all he was giving Slytherin House ten points because Professor Malfoy had beaten him fair and square.
The following morning, stepping into the Great Hall, Draco beamed despite himself. The first of December, of course! Hogwarts Castle had decorated itself overnight, and it was snowing in the Great Hall, settling only on the Christmas trees, never landing on the ground, or on a student. The fireplace roared, and the scent of cloves was overwhelming. All students loved this, but Draco was always especially pleased to see the first years’ reactions. The first time they’d seen anything quite like it, and they’d stumble, wide-eyed, or stand stock still with their mouths hanging open.
“All the time,” he answered, slowly, and reached for his glass.
He would wake up sobbing, sometimes alone, sometimes with someone doing their best to comfort him, and he wondered if this was what life was going to be like for the rest of his days; just a series of horrors, nightmare after nightmare until he couldn’t take it any more. And then Ron, though he didn’t scream in the night — he started climbing out of bed and wandering out of the house, finding himself lost and wandless when he woke up at last. Harry and Arthur spent a weekend putting up charms all over the doors and windows that were supposed to sound an alarm if Ron tried to leave.
“Blimey, Draco,” Neville said, during a lull, when a buxom new bartender had brought them two flagons of ale, sensing very correctly that Draco had no need of more Firewhiskey.
“You’re not working today. For the next few days. At least. Don’t you dare imagine that I have forgotten how to tell when you’re lying to me, Harry Potter,” she said, sternly.
Harry didn’t move from the couch, with Rose in his arms, for a long time. He realised fairly quickly that he wasn’t the best company. He couldn’t get out of his own head, and the only person who didn’t seem to be concerned about that was Ginny. She had a hundred stories to tell, of matches all ove the world; Brazil, Australia, the USA (“they call Muggles NoMajs!”), Kenya, Denmark. She babbled about the Seeker on the German team whom she had been seeing for the last few months, kept everyone laughing, and left space for Harry to help Molly in the kitchen.
Draco swallowed. His voice came out weak and cracked. “I’m sure he knows. And I feel quite sure that he is very sorry as well.”
“Kingsley and I had a cousin,” she said, kicking off her shoes and leaning back in her chair. “Guin. She worked at St Mungo’s. She was a good nurse. But as the years went by, she seemed to hollow out. Do you understand what I mean? Do you have any Firewhiskey?”
“I… think you’ve passed. No more interrogations. And now,” she said, carefully, “what is it that you’re waiting for? To go — to go back to Draco?”
Draco waited for a long moment for an elaboration, but none was forthcoming. So. “For fuck’s sake, Emrys. What are you trying to say?”
But he did; acknowledging the work of Kreacher and his…
“But you were in love with him long before he was a patient.” Emrys patted his hand, briefly, and then lifted his teacup, pinkie finger held out straight.
Draco tossed Hermione a grateful look, but didn’t so much as glance at Harry as he led Blaise into the Floo, the Glamour settling over his features as if by habit.
“It is. And someone
“And I need you to think about what I might have missed. A trauma. Something truly scarring. The worst memory he might have of the time before the war. I’ve walked in the Forbidden Forest with Harry, and watched him die. There’s something in his mind which is, for him, worse than that.”
Just how long
have to find something to do with my time, or I’ll turn into some weird old hermit. Not yet; in a year or two. Not a sodding clue what that might be, but if your life is here, then so is mine.” He held Draco’s gaze as he said it. Determined that there would not be any doubt between them. If this ended — if this didn’t even begin — it would be Draco’s decision, not Harry’s. He took Draco’s hand in his own. “I haven’t been so sure about anything since I was a kid.”
babies.)
“We need a table,” Draco said, and he marched to the kitchen without looking up, unrolling the map as he went. He Scourgified the table while Hermione did the lights, and they bent over the map.
powerful. He could resist Veritaserum and the Imperius Curse. He was generally too polite to push hard against someone’s wards, of course. But right then? Exactly where he wanted to be, with the person he wanted to be with, his skin practically magnetised to Draco’s, and knowing that one way or another, he was going to ruin this?
Task completed, Draco sat in front of his desk for a few more minutes. He had a new journal for his findings, and at the top of the page, he wrote the date. He had two aims, for this session; to try to buy some more time, and to convince Harry to open one of the doors.
in his hands and leaned in for another kiss, Harry melted against him. It was true, what he’d said. Draco could feel rather than see or hear the way certain objects in the room began to almost quiver, as the warmth and light which seemed, bizarrely, to be emanating from Harry himself made Draco dizzy with need.
Close to four o’clock in the afternoon, his mother opened the door to his rooms, and swept inside. Of course she was able to breeze past his wards; he’d learned them all from her.
“You didn’t learn a thing. You were an appalling dancer,” Draco said, very reasonably. “And apparently, you still are. So
But it was only a fucking bird, and Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater, and soon he’d be hunting down Muggles and Muggleborns and he’d be doing so much worse to them. He had a soft shell. He needed to do something about that. Couldn’t run crying to a bathroom over a bird. Or over Katie Bell. She was an idiot. She deserved all that she got.
Molly sighed, and turned to Harry, wrapping her arms around him. “Of course, Harry, dear. And you always will be. I just need a minute to adjust. I thought I’d have you for a son-in-law, you know. But you have to do what makes you happy. You know that’s all I’ve ever wanted for you.” She kissed the side of his head, and suddenly he felt like he was twelve years old again, when he’d craved this sort of affection and didn’t know how to accept it.
“I think I might be having a terrible allergic reaction to the universe,” Harry told Neville, strangled.
It was time to go to Draco.
Blaise didn’t argue. He followed Harry inside, and up the stairs to the lit fireplace. “You doing New Year’s Eve this year?”
— Tom Riddle, someone who had faced off with a troll at the wizened old age of eleven, someone who had flown a broom through Fiendfyre, look so very much like he might throw up in the face of
“He’s entirely wrong for you. You are very high maintenance, darling Draco, and so is Mr… Zabini, is it?”
Harry swore under his breath, and raced back to examine the damage. When he pushed Malfoy’s sleeve up, he could see where the curse was growing, the dark tendrils trying to take root. He gritted his teeth. At least it was something that he had seen before. He conjured a small crystal bottle and pulled out his wand.
“I started dropping in to see him from time to time. I always kept my distance. And wore a Glamour, just as he did, but there was no mistaking the way he walked and talked. And I got pretty good at seeing past Glamours anyway, when I needed to, as my training progressed. So it was easy to find him, when I wanted to know what was going on.”
somewhat argumentative.
The wand flew gracefully across the room from where it had been tucked away on the bookcase and Draco directed it to Harry’s hand.
“That love bite on his neck!”
Almost like old times, except he wasn’t stumbling into anyone’s bed. For a moment, before he fell asleep, he let himself imagine Harry laughing at his side.
be long gone. And I’m not. So stop fretting like Madame Pomfrey.” He climbed to his feet, a little awkward but as graceful as he’d ever been, and ran his hand over the short, soft bristles on his scalp. “We might as well make ourselves useful.”
“There’s nothing to discuss, Mother,” Draco hissed, but he smoothed his hair back.
Hermione sighed. “This can wait, Harry. Can’t it?”
“Any day, now,” she said happily. “Fit to burst. Harry. We’ve all done things we regret, every single one of us. Some worse than others, but isn’t that all a matter of circumstance? Oh, she’s kicking again. She’s an athlete. She’ll play for the Harpies, you can bet. Or, if she’s a Squib, perhaps she’ll play football.” She looked up at Harry. “We all need to remember that there are no guarantees. About
After throwing a pair of boxers on, and helping Harry into some pajama pants, Draco fell into bed beside him. In no time at all Harry was curled up against him like a koala and had fallen fast asleep, leaving Draco to run his fingers through those unruly locks until unconsciousness overtook him.
“I may not be fond of your presence, but I will drag your ass out here if I have to.”
He knew what was inside the box before he even opened the flap, he was the one who had labeled the damn thing, but he opened and dumped the contents out nonetheless. For a minute all he could do was stare. Stare at the colorful pairs of mismatched and disproportionately sized socks; stare at the too-bright box of prototype puking pastilles; stare at the remnants of a magic switchblade that had been so badly damaged on that fateful night in the department of mysteries. When his gaze landed on the fading words of a map that no longer hummed with magic Harry whispered a packing charm and rushed out of the room, unshed tears burning his eyes as he stumbled out onto the street.
Pushing himself up Harry managed to pull off Draco, his words cutting into whatever Draco had been about to say, “I wanna ride you.”
Without taking his lips away from Draco's neck Harry summoned his wand, performing a quick cleaning charm on the mess in his boxers, before casting the tempus charm, “early enough that we have time for you to fuck me into the mattress and then get a few more hours of sleep.”
His arm trembled as he lifted himself off the now silent toy. Narrowly avoiding falling onto the floor as he fell forward with an exhausted huff. His whole body shaking with aftershocks as he forced himself to look up at Draco, who looked nearly as wrecked as Harry felt.
Laughing Harry took the noodle and obnoxiously slurped it into his mouth, laughing as he said, “I love you too.”
“Come on, this isn't your first time kissing someone. Use some tongue, get frisky. Get sexy!”
Harry stared down at his list in both horror and amusement at the sheer
Gripping the hair on the back of Draco's head Harry pulled him down and attached his lips to the pale column of Draco's throat, sucking until he knew there would be a dark bruise for everyone to see. But he didn’t stop there. Harry covered one side of Draco's neck in marks before shimmying down the bed, leaving a trail of marks down his chest. A smug smirk crossing his face after he left a near purple mark just by Draco’s hip, and saw the state of Draco’s cock, “you were saying about my stamina?”
it was like being split open.
“Hermione do we have to do this?” Potter complained
Harry to do this and let Malfoy
Draco looked at that moment. His face was flushed and there was cum running down his chin… it was enough to get Harry’s blood thrumming again.
Pulling away Draco looked up at Harry with a borderline delirious smile, “good morning to you too.”
Not giving anyone time to comment on the thin lines that covered his torso Malfoy grinned, “Granger, truth or dare?”
Even with his whole body shaking, and the oversensitivity bordering painful at this point, Harry didn’t stop moving. Looking directly into Draco’s eyes Harry clenched and rolled his hips, his own nails digging into Draco’s chest at the drag of cock against his prostate. Forcing himself to ignore the odd pressure in the pit of his stomach as he kept moving.
Placing his hands on Draco’s scared chest Harry slowly lifted himself until only the tip of Draco’s cock was inside him, before dropping back down. And just like that, he began riding him with the same amount of fervor he had when he was on a broom chasing the snitch.
Topher looked at him in a way that made Ron feel seen all over, and then he smiled.
. You shouldn’t have had to watch Cedric Diggory die for nothing.”
“No,” Harry said. “It just… still doesn’t feel right. I can’t believe I got through the school year with it, but the Auror conducting our training did some measurements and isn’t happy with it at all.”
Harry gave her hands a squeeze.
Hermione felt chastened. And she still wasn’t sure she agreed; but there was definitely something there to think about. Draco sat back in his chair, with a contemplative expression on his face. He reached for his quill, and made a few more notes.
“We’ll need rules, of course,” Draco said, and Harry’s chin snapped up.
“Right,” she said. “I — Blaise told me you…”
Draco buried his face in his hands, elbows on the table.
Draco’s mother fixed him with a glare, and Draco shut up.
“Give him a break, Harry,” Neville said, softly.
“Mistress,” he said, bowing deeply.
“I neglected her so badly, Hermione. I know she’ll never accept me again. Not after all this time. Just… sleeping in my office, and when I went back there I used to Floo into the bedroom directly… all the dust, and probably mould… I really fucked up, there, didn’t I?”
“Oh, stop it.” Draco stabbed viciously at his risotto, though it was very nice and hadn’t done him any harm. “This isn’t my home, Potter, for fuck’s sake, it’s my office. I don’t know what you’re doing, but stop it.”
jeans. You’re hitting a bar or two. I suppose we’ll see you in the morning, whenever you manage to extricate yourself from some cheap Muggle flat in Camden.”
. “Alaric. Are you sure you’re not part giant?”
“Thank you for visiting, Harry,” Mrs Malfoy said.
“My father will probably crawl from his grave to stop the wedding, but I’m game if you are. That could be quite funny, actually.”
“Potter,” he replied, turning back to the stove. And then over his shoulder; “Harry.”
“Come through,” she said. “I’m cooking, and I can’t sit here.”
He wondered if he should call someone. A Healer, maybe, just to check him over. Pansy or Blaise, as they’d been so close. Hermione, because she was the smartest person Harry knew. Maybe even Molly, since — and he’d never admit to Draco that it had ever crossed his mind — Draco seemed direly in need of a parental figure of some sort. It seemed very strange, to think that Draco Malfoy was sleeping upstairs in Harry’s guest room and nobody knew. He wondered who was missing him. Perhaps he could find out how to contact the band, though that seemed very risky as well; for all Harry knew, they were Muggles, and if so, they probably had no idea about Draco.
“Hullo,” he said. Some of the students greeted him back; some giggled (including a few of the girls, hands covering their mouths; Merlin, did he not want to have to worry about something like that), and a few sat waiting for him to, what, explain how they’d won the war?
“Harry. If you don’t mind.”
Potter was staring at the ruins of the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm, but shook his gaze away, embarrassed. “Sneakers.”
“I’m not sure I really want them to,” Potter said. “The other names they’ve used over the years have run the gamut from worse to much, much worse. I filed an injunction on the Prophet eight years ago preventing them from calling me the Saviour anymore,” he admitted miserably and then flushed.
“Malfoy,” he said, with relief in his tone, and then seeing Draco’s face fall, he amended it. “Draco. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come. I didn’t recognise the signs. This is a
Maybe he would learn, here, too. What if — if that night… no.
Draco Malfoy, and you have known him for years. So all this sodding procrastination is because you don’t know how to tell him that.”
Hermione sat up straighter. “No, Ron’s right.”
“And this is the second: you, and I mean you, Harry… fuck the accolades, fuck the stupid titles journalists like to use to sell papers. You, Harry Potter. You wouldn’t fall in love with someone you had made up in your head. You wouldn’t fall in love with the Draco you never saw again after his trial. I don’t believe for a fucking moment that you were optimistic enough to have imagined the man he is today.
“Then why are you here?” the woman said. “I think I was clear — you need a wand, Mr Potter. No one does wandless magic in this training course in the first six months and
of it, so very much, and still he couldn’t understand it. The soft couch and the beautiful curtains that surrounded his bed, the rug that felt like the softest, densest fur under his feet (and did occasionally almost seem to purr).
Blaise laughed, but there was something thin in the sound. “If you see him again…”
. There were no limits of time and space, not in here.
“I’d like to thank you all for the trust you have put in me. I resign my position at the DMLE, effective immediately. I have no plans to work for the next while. I want to focus on my health, and spend time with my friends and family. Thank you.”
“I might have just the thing,” he said, waving at one of the upper shelves until a long silver box floated demurely into his hand. He removed the wand, and handed it to Daisy.
Molly’s eyebrows knit in the middle. “Harry, dear… I’m not sure Draco was ever a scorpion, though. He may have been raised by one. You know, that day over here he spoke to Arthur and Arthur thought that, well, that Draco was very fond of you.” She held his gaze. “
“I didn’t say that,” Hermione said, raising her voice. She cast Muffliato, afraid she wouldn’t be able to keep her voice low. “I didn’t. I’m sure it was hard for you. But Harry… what he went through… and Ron was a wreck, half destroyed. He worked at the shop for a while and then he went to stay with Bill and Fleur at Shell Cottage, so he could recover properly. That’s where he got to know Gabrielle. I got a training position in the investigative division, and Harry was working in the field. So no. For a little while there we didn’t see very much of each other at all.”
And there it was, in the morning. The note that Draco had dreaded finding.
Bonnie stirred the cashew cream into her lentil salad.
“And,” Hermione said. “It’s not — spoiled earth?”
“But if you look inside your heart of hearts, you know you are not an Auror.”
Hermione kneeled to examine the buds, the early flowers. To enjoy the scent of warm, moist earth. It didn’t feel like a place that had seen that much evil. Not anymore.
When Harry closed the shop on Christmas Eve he stood outside in the magic snow with a mug of hot chocolate held between gloved hands to watch the lights twinkle for a few minutes, and to breathe the cool air. He’d lived with a lot of sadness in his life. He knew how to handle that. He and disappointment were old friends, and most of the time, he knew how to keep his expectations low.
Harry laughed, and Draco smirked until he couldn’t smirk anymore because Harry had switched angles just right and he was coming, instead, coming against Harry’s chest, come dripping from his snail trail and over his scars. The sight of it had his hips snapping faster, Draco holding on for dear life.
“And what was the worst thing?”
Potter’s eyes flicked up and met Draco’s and Draco could see that neither of them had been expecting to meet again. Not this way; not trapped together for ten months of the year in a draughty castle full of children. Potter had climbed the steps at the other end of the stage, and now he stood awkward and uncertain. Perhaps he wanted to run.
Pansy paused for another moment.
How obscene would it be to let him live there? Apparently Draco wasn’t even needed for it to work. Perhaps the dream Draco did a better job than he ever could. It was a thought that Draco couldn’t examine too closely. The last thing he wanted to have to confront was a conflict of interest borne from a twenty-five year old crush.
chocolate. I
Sleep was elusive. The sheer power of the rain and sleet rendered silencing charms rather useless. But Harry found the tattoo on the rooftop calming, and his head was full of ideas, so he didn’t mind the sleeplessness. It was different from back when he was afraid to sleep because of the nightmares.
“I,” Harry said, his mouth and throat dry. “It was kind of your mother to… I just.” He looked down and tried to follow Draco’s feet. “I learned to lead.”
to turn out all of the lights. And he made his way up the stairs to his bedroom. He thought he’d read for a little while and then go to sleep.
He sat up, a few minutes later, when his breathing had returned to normal, and he dropped into the armchair by Harry’s bedside. Harry, of course, hadn’t moved. Not a twitch. Nothing but the rapid movement of his eyes under those pale lids, shot through with pale blue veins. He reached for Harry’s hand, and held it, gently running his thumb over the inside of Harry’s wrist.
“Oh, good,” Harry said. Not really a response.
“Would you like to hear about my findings?”
Hermione still looked troubled.
It hadn’t really crossed his mind before but the moment the statement slipped from between Harry’s lips he knew that it was true.
Draco’s footsteps paused in the kitchen, and Harry held his breath. Maybe Draco wouldn’t notice. But of course, he did. He pushed aside the curtains.
“My cousin. Daisy. Her mother is ill, so I said I’d bring her to do her Hogwarts shopping.”
“It wasn’t a hardship,” Draco muttered, when he could, glancing at the floorboards. “I’ll leave you to get some sleep. I eat around seven. If you’re awake, you’re welcome to join me. Otherwise, Rubino can make you breakfast in the morning.” Draco nodded tightly. “Sleep well, Auror Potter. Tomorrow we’ll discuss a recovery plan.” And then he turned on his heel, and he was already closing the door and heading down the stairs before Harry could stir himself to reply.
“Why are you telling me that?”
In the morning, Hermione found them like that, asleep, Ron’s head on Harry’s shoulder. She pulled a blanket up over their bodies and let them sleep while she helped Molly and George in the kitchen.
“Precious little,” Draco replied, deadpan. “You’ll need to be a little more specific.”
,” he said, waving a wand at all of the mess. It felt as if his eyes might be watering from the pain, but he widened his smile and patted her shoulder.
“You don’t, Ron. You don’t!”
“Is there something I can help you with?”
“Fresh as a daisy,” he admitted out loud. “And really, daisies stink. So it’s fitting.”
“Harry?”
“Has something happened?”
“Didn’t need saving,” Julian said. “Are we done? I have more important things to do. Anyway, when’s he getting back from Budapest, or wherever?”
“There’s something I need to tell you,” Draco said, when he was done. Sitting by Harry’s side on the freshly transfigured bed, wide enough once more for the two of them. His face burned. His voice was weak. “You’re not alone in this. I wanted you so desperately at school. I didn’t even know where to put that much need, and I… I’m like a cat, in a lot of ways, I suppose. I scratch when I want to be petted. And the more you hated me the worse I scratched. I didn’t know how else to be, with you. That day in Madame Malkins’ — I decided that you would be my best friend, and then you rejected me. I don’t blame you, of course, fuck, I wanted to be all impressive and imposing and instead I was a little gobshite. But I wanted you. And I still do.” He rubbed his forehead. “Merlin, I don’t know if I hope you remember this or I hope you don’t.”
He pulled an envelope from his pocket. “This is the specifications for the renovations, once the house is clean. Paint colours, carpet, everything. Just give it to Kreacher. He’ll take care of the rest, and he’ll make sure it’s done perfectly. And for the love of all that is Harry, Granger — Kreacher is too old to be alone. I know it hurts your sensibilities to hear this but this is an ancient Wizarding house, and it needs at least three house-elves to keep it in state. They like having the responsibility of a home. Stop inflicting your ghastly white human feminist cultural world-view on other species. It’s insulting.”
“Nine years,” he said, swallowing a lump in his throat.
“What time shall I send the elves with your supper?”
“Alright,” Hermione said, throwing her hands up. “I’ll confirm your attendance, and tighten up the story. And I promise not to ask again.”
Hermione sniffed, and nodded.
“I think I’m lost,” Harry admitted.
“Who competed?”
Lying liar. Lying liar spouting
“I just remembered,” he said.
“No, I… I was just… glad to see you. Surprised. No one’s heard anything about you since…”
He looked at Draco again.
Mrs Malfoy’s voice was gentle, and too kind and inquisitive by half. Harry swallowed a lump in his throat. What was he supposed to say? That he didn’t want to put Mrs Malfoy out, that he wasn’t sure he really deserved a slice of lemon? That taking up as little space as he could manage was the only way he was able to cope with the way his existence tended to take up far too much space in the world? How ridiculous.
“I have post to check.”
Draco shushed her gently. “Not if you’re careful, Miss Hubbard. You need to add the lacewings one at a time and stir widdershins after each wing. Just once.” He glanced around the rest of the classroom, and everyone else seemed to be getting along, so he turned his attention back to Amelia.
“And is that usual?”
“Your aunt and — but you’re
“I was just watching. What did you do, before you came back here to teach, Malfoy?”
Draco bit back a wider smile. “And what are you doing with your days?”
“Fuck off, Harold.” Ron came in, grinning, and looked around where Harry was standing at the kitchen counter. “Well? Where’s the new wand, then?”
“Cuttings. Or… rather, dried branches. There’s good stuff in there, Harry, I promise. I think it’s brilliant that you’re going to be a wandmaker — brilliant! And if I can ever give you anything you need, I will.”
“I need to apologise to him, as well. I didn’t know — I didn’t realise — that the party was for courting. I hope the rest of his night passed more pleasantly. I am sure that any young woman in the Wizarding world would be delighted to make that match.”
“Might be safest,” Harry agreed.
“No,” he said, surprised by his honesty and deflating a little. “I’m not. And I’m not disappointed that I’ve not been allowed into practical classes yet because — I feel as if I’ve fought enough for my entire life. I don’t
“It was Tom Riddle’s fault. They know that.” Harry shifted, back to the window, facing the shop counter with his elbows on his knees. “You lost a lot as well.”
bothered Draco all day. For dozens of reasons. The first and in his mind the most irksome was that the entire concept of love potions seemed like a grotesque violation. No different to… to holding someone down. He also had to admit to himself that he didn’t like the thought of anyone sniffing after Harry that way. It was pretty pathetic, and also, it was Draco’s job.
“I’m not sure I’ve ever seen this side of you, Malfoy. Have you lost all of your snark? I think I might be missing it.”
Hermione’s eyes brightened wetly for a moment. “Put them with Buckbeak’s feathers,” she said, and turned her attention back to her noodles.
Potter had turned, then, and they’d held each other’s gazes for what seemed like an eternity. Potter had looked sick. Gaunt. Not only sleeping too little but not eating properly, either, and Draco wondered if anyone was taking proper care of the git.
“Her,” Harry said. “And her name is Dora. For Tonks. Apparently she has already shown an alarming tendency to change colour when she is plotting something. Isn’t that terrific?”
in his dreams. I assume that when I am not there, he is enjoying a very vigorous sex life with a figment of his imagination, but I have been rather too preoccupied with attempts to open some of the doors around the house and keep him talking to take him up on his repeated and passionate offers. Are we clear?”
way.”
“Don’t pretend you can’t simply flit through my wards,” he said, feigning boredom. Mostly because Draco was feigning it equally poorly as he leaned against the doorjamb.
“You don’t know what it was like,” Hermione said, again. “The three of us… every time we looked at each other, we were back in the thick of it. You can’t know how many times we nearly died. How frightened we were, all the time.”
“So — I can only come to one conclusion. You
The morning was cold, and crisp, and the dawn was barely kissing the sky, when Draco mounted his broom and pushed off into the air.
Draco took a breath.
“I don’t think so.” She took the glass and took a large sip. “You might have mentioned you were in love with him.”
She stepped back a little, careful to stand between Draco and the other two, standing by the couch as if they were waiting to be told what to do next, and maybe they were.
“I don’t know what’s come over you either,” she said, laughing as he twirled her around. “But I like it. Let me owl our guests some invitations, and I’ll bring some bottles of wine up from the cellar.”
They were silent a while, the fire seeming to hypnotise Potter, and Potter having a somewhat similar effect on Draco.
“I didn’t know elves could see you,” Hermione said, when the elf apparated. Blaise didn’t reply. Hermione sighed. “Of course they can. They’re difficult to fool, even if they are easily enslaved.”
“Before… well, the Owls, and Hagrid, and finding out that I was a Wizard, I wanted — I needed magic to be real. It was an escape. And I could borrow from the library, because it didn’t cost any money and they couldn’t… couldn’t
He let Hermione pull him closer, head on her shoulder. “How much do you know?”
Draco was still collected, but he didn’t answer, just waited.
“What makes you think I’ll want to hear from you? You paid your bill. Aren’t we finished?” He tried not to smile, but he could feel the sparkling under his eyelids.
When Hermione came downstairs a little while later, talking at a mile a minute about his cover story, Harry paid no attention.
Hermione sighed. “Two years, perhaps. Blaise will have to resign from the Department of Mysteries and then, after a while, we can come out as a couple — it’s all very complicated.”
“I want you to show me Sirius’s room,” Draco said.
“This has been a thrill, Hermione. I would have voted for you too. Are you coming through?”
Grief, unspilled.
“It’s all true. Well, but can you blame us? Young, fit, no time for a proper social life, or not much of one, anyway.”
His friend leaned in. “Blink-182 without all the optimism. And with more distortion.”
“They’re always with us, Harry,” Minerva said, and then she swept away.
“Here, Hermione,” he said, passing her a new wand.
Back at the shop, Draco disappeared upstairs and closed his door with a decisive click.
She couldn’t take her eyes off the two of them, the kitten working very hard to chew off Crookshanks’ tail and failing utterly, but she dutifully tasted Harry’s stew. It was unbelievably tasty, and her moan was probably more than enough to tell him that it didn’t need anything extra.
“Please, go ahead. I don’t think you were finished.”
“I think we have, Hermione. And he looks like he’s ready to wriggle out of his chair. Spill it, Harry, or we’ll tip you over and
“And then I met this boy. I rejected his friendship, at the time, and d’you know — I could have explained why at the time, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me now. Well, we were children.”
And then Harry went to the Burrow.
He turned to Hermione, who had tears in her eyes, and threw her arms around Harry’s shoulders, hugging him tightly.
That didn’t make a lot of sense. But Harry nodded just the same. He didn’t dare look away from Ollivander’s face; maybe it would give him some clue as to what was happening, here.
Hermione frowned. “Gin?”
“Thank you. I take that as a compliment, these days. And for the record, you’re quite odd yourself.”
Malfoy loves him even worse; but you and me, Hermione: none of that is about us. And this can’t be about them.”
Draco let his nose graze against Harry’s nose, and stole another kiss, this time letting his tongue press curiously against Harry’s lower lip. Harry opened his mouth, after a moment, and Draco felt Harry’s hand slip carefully to his hip. Did he even know? That he was pulling Draco closer, even as he trembled, and seemed to want to pull away? Was he aware of the soft dance of their tongues, the hungry way he was coaxing Draco nearer?
“It’s lovely,” Harry said again, shuffling across the shiny floorboards to open a window and let the sea air in. The room was circular, the four poster bed piled up with what looked suspiciously like old, comfortable, handmade quilts. Not very Malfoyish, if he was honest.
“I helped
His hand was beginning to blister. The colour of the blisters was very worrying. And he was in too much pain to try to sort through it all in his head.
Draco didn’t ask if he was thinking of the moment he’d disapparated from the bloody balcony of bloody Malfoy Manor to avoid being kissed. He felt inordinately proud of his restraint.
Between courses there was an operatic quartet. Harry hated it, but he couldn’t deny that they were good, and he clapped louder and longer than most.
the bigger disaster here and I…”
Merlin.
“I will have some rather
“No.” Harry huffed a laugh. “I did it to myself. I’m sorry, Pans. I really have to go and rest. You should take those with you; I don’t think I could eat a bite anyway.”
“Has your sarcasm become much more convincing, or can I trust you?”
All of these things needed to be true. They had to be, because his father was infallible. And if his father wasn’t infallible, then Draco was in much worse trouble than he’d feared. He leaned over the sink, and draped his tie over his shoulder; he was going to throw up what little there was in his stomach. Katie Bell was a twit, but she hadn’t deserved…
The sudden rise of the music, and the way everyone stepped up excitedly, following the sounds to the ballroom, was a relief. Harry could leave. With all of the movement… he could leave, and this whole disgusting misunderstanding (as if Draco Malfoy could ever want him like that, with his ridiculous, disobedient hair, his Muggle clothes. With their entire sodding history sitting in every room they shared like a boggart in the corner. Draco had taken pity on him, and wanted to help him find a girl to marry) would be over. Like a gentleman, he ushered everyone in ahead of himself, and as soon as he had a chance, he headed outside to disapparate.
“Well, that was true, once. But you’ve taught them all a great deal.”
Draco waited patiently. If only he’d worn his old expression of revulsion, she might have kept her composure better.
He could.
They stumbled into Harry’s bedroom already pulling at their clothes, and Harry was suddenly glad for the practise he’d had, shagging Muggles all over London, think of those first few times when he couldn’t quite figure out the etiquette of getting one’s kit off, wondering if he seemed presumptuous. Presumptuous or not they both knew what was happening here, and by the time Draco’s back hit the mattress all he had to do was lift his hips so Harry could help him with his jeans.
Harry was cautious, a moment, and then he slipped his wand into his robes.
. I hate him even less, now, though. D’you think they’ll all go to Hogwarts?”
“But Kreacher —”
Harry stood slowly, raising a hand to quell the premature spattering of applause.
Harry thought about begging off Sunday lunch at the Weasleys’, but knew if he did, Hermione would show up wanting to know why. And Molly would send him a mournful note about how it wasn’t the same when he wasn’t there. Sunday morning found him hesitating by the downstairs Floo while his eyes were drawn over and over again to the upstairs landing. Draco had only just emerged for his morning pot of tea and to cast an eye over the Daily Prophet.
“I have grown up, you know,” Draco said. “It would be ever so refreshing if you would try to remember that I don’t see the world the way I did when I was sixteen.”
But this little boy hadn’t existed for a very long time.
“I’ll let you know when and if there is anything you can do. In the meantime — just try to act as if Draco
Ronald Weasley was a good person and apparently a kind father, too, a good husband.
“Well, er,” Jake said. “I was — I mean, we were wondering.”
He took a deep breath. Fear came, and it had something to tell him; but he acknowledged it, and thanked it, and sent it on its way. He stood for several minutes by the window, bathed in sunbeams, breathing from his diaphragm until he was solely focused on the sensation of oxygen flooding his bloodstream. He opened his eyes when he heard Persephone fussing, waiting for a snack.
he must have been feeling towards Draco when he had written this. The first ten alone were variations of licking and eating various things off Draco’s body, and the rest were vague depictions of wanting to bend Malfoy over various surfaces and fuck him senseless
Malfoy knew that Potter thought that this would be fun, but with all of these Gryffindor goody two shoes it was dull as hell. It was kind of like going to a rock festival only to learn that it was for actual geological specimens and not fantastic music. Though it wasn't that surprising Malfoy mused, perfect little Potter with his perfect little posse. Oh how the Slytherin would love to show them the ways of Draco Malfoy…
Draco swore into Harry’s skin as he clenched around him, “say it again.”
Harry thought the way Draco said his name was downright
Putting aside the crumpled piece of paper, Harry took out another and unfolded it, thanking the stars that after he made his bullshit one for the assignment that brought the lists about, he had actually decided to spend time to make a real bucket list. Back then, and even now, there were so many things that Harry had never done before and so many more that he wanted to do.
Draco loosened his grip on Harry’s curls so he could pull off and take some very needed gulps of air. Only to pull him into a crushing kiss a moment later, a muffled noise escaping him as he tasted himself on Harry’s tongue.
His mouth dropped open with a muffled noise as a dull roar filled his ears. Harry loved the feeling of his mind lulling into grey noise and the pressure that slowly built up in the back of his head. He loved the moment just before he released his grasp; the burning pressure in his chest and head. But nothing compared to the
“That was, fuck. Wow.”
“I could’ve stopped if you warned me.”
Harry woke to sunlight filtering through their bedroom window. He was about to grab his wand to pull them down so he could get a few more hours of blissful unconsciousness when he paused. Harry has never been a morning person and had never understood how people not only function but enjoy being awake before ten am. However, right now Harry didn’t care what time it was. It could’ve been six in the morning and he still would’ve just laid there, staring.
“Say what? That you feel good,” nipping at Harry’s earlobe Draco hummed, “or
There was one almost unfortunate drawback Harry was dealing with because of all the soft moments and brief touches. The nights when Draco came to bed and curled up against him like a house cat trying to become one with his warmth, or when Harry would blearily wake in the morning and Draco would hush him back to sleep. Those times Harry would find himself zoning out throughout the day as he tried to work, thinking about nothing more than Draco in bed with him. His smooth skin washed out in the morning light or illuminated by pale rays of the moon. His blonde locks tousled from sleep, gently framing his face as he slept. His voice groggy and crackling from waking up.
After building up a rhythm, moaning at each drag of the toy against his prostate, Harry flicked the wrist of his free hand. Nearly falling over a second later when a low hum filled the quiet between his moans and vibrations wracked his body. He was moving and moaning with a fervor that was rare even when he was with Draco.
Moving even more so Draco would be straddling Harry’s chest if he were to sit up Harry retorted, “you already did that, want to fuck my face instead?”
No words were spoken after that.
Draco’s voice suddenly cracked and he arched off the mattress, “fuck- I’m gonna-” his head dropped back, Harry’s name falling from his mouth in a pitched whisper, before he let out the most beautiful moan Harry had ever heard and came. It was as he felt Draco’s cum filling him up that the pressure in Harry’s stomach exploded and a wave of burning pleasure shot through him, his magic making the ground beneath them shake almost as much as he was as he lost control and fell forward.
Harry thought that maybe all the eight years living together could be fun. They’d stay up all night being idiots with each other and maybe sneak out every once in a while. How so
Draco hummed and pulled Harry against his chest, “after you lost control of your magic during that third orgasm, those drunk morons have been trying to get in here.”
Harry stared at Draco, his mouth going dry as he realized this wasn’t a teasing joke. Draco actually wanted to watch him touch himself. This wasn’t something they had ever done before, and he knew Draco would understand if he refused, but… the idea of Draco doing nothing to him, to just
Nuzzling into Harry's messy locks Draco hummed, "yeah, sleep sounds pretty damn nice right now."
Draco laughed and half heartedly fought off Harry’s attack, eventually winning by pushing Harry onto his back with an undignified yelp, and laying on top of him. For a moment all was silent, before Draco whispered in an almost shocked tone, “I really- wow. You look like you were mauled by a very horny vampire.”
“You’re going to keep touching yourself,” using wandless magic Draco ripped the blankets away from Harry, leaving him totally exposed to those critical eyes, “and I’m going to watch.”
” pushing his food around his plate Harry continued quietly, “I want this to make you happy too.”
Their friends were arguing amongst themselves again, but Malfoy was too caught up in his head to pay attention. The image of bending Potter over the couch and fucking him right there, in front of everyone, sent an unexpected jolt of arousal through Malfoy. The mere idea of anyone watching him have sex, with the goddamn savior of the wizarding world no less, was so unbelievably hot that he couldn’t stop the full body shudder that ran through him.
“You’re done out here, but the dare isn't over.”
Harry let out a whine he rarely let Draco hear as he sat back his heels, adding another finger. Trying to feel more full, to feel it deeper. It was at this whine that Draco finally spoke, his voice deep and raspy, almost sounding restrained, “you’re starting to look frustrated Harry.”
Malfoy didn’t get off Potter as he looked over at Pansy, who was fanning herself by the way, and said in a slightly raspy voice that he almost didn't recognize, “is that good enough?”
Leaning on his elbow Draco rested his chin on his palm, a cool smirk crossing his face as he said, “well don’t let me stop you.”
Bringing his hands up Draco's thighs Harry hummed at the way that smooth skin and damn near silky hair felt under his palms. Harry often thought that the legs on this man should be illegal. They had no right to be so attractive and Harry has told Draco as much on several occasions. How he wished he could spend hours here pouring over Draco’s body. He loved the times when Draco allowed Harry to worship every inch of his body, and voice all the thoughts he had… Harry reached down to adjust himself at the mere thought.
Harry looked as though someone had punched him in the gut, “there is no way in hell that I'm doing seven minutes in heaven with
Malfoy wasn’t the only one looking at Weasley with a surprised and confused expression, “You don't want me to do that.”
Potter took the bottle from Malfoy and finished it off before dropping it to the floor and turning to face Malfoy, both of whom looked rather scared to do this. It's not everyday that you do seven minutes in heaven with your childhood rival afterall. Not to mention the fact that they were making out in front of a group of people, of their
“Harry, dear,” Molly said, as the afternoon grew long. “I thought Draco might have come.”
“Is it true that you conjured a fully corporeal Patronus in your third year?” she asked.
“Good with a hex, though,” Draco growled.
There had been a hum of voices which stopped the moment Kingsley Shacklebolt tapped his gavel.
“Thought that was you,” came a familiar and jovial voice. Harry smiled at the figure coming up the street. “I’ve just come from the Leaky.”
“I’m not…” he started, hating the way his stomach tied itself in knots. “I wasn’t raised well, Mrs Malfoy. I wasn’t raised in this world, and I wasn’t really…” Wasn’t really raised in the Muggle world, either, was what he wanted to say. Didn’t know how to do this sort of thing.
. Or if those all have too many syllables, you could just say
“In a few days I’ll show him I’m doing alright, and once my magic is being a bit less… whoops,” he said, leaping to his feet to catch the teapot as it flew at him from the kitchen. “Er. Unpredictable — I’ll make a Portkey.”
“I’m scared now,” Draco said, his breath hitching. “Please. Please, Potter. Please just help me.”
“But I didn’t!” Draco replied as her face disappeared from the Floo.
Harry waited with his eyebrows raised.
“Are you alright, Harry?” she said.
He was sixteen years old. He was terrified; for himself, for his friends, and for his family. His mother. He was supposed to kill Dumbledore, who had only ever been kind and patient with him, however complicated his more adult feelings were about the man, and he was going to fail.
deal of effort to acquire it.”
Shortly after dawn, Hermione emerged, her hair a fascinating great mess and her cheeks pink. She kissed Harry’s forehead and made herself a cup of coffee, as well.
“I simply can’t wait to see you
Hermione nodded.
“I like the way some of them recognise me,” Harry admitted. He handed over an extra twenty pounds. “Give some to the kids for me, will you?” he asked, and then he stepped away. He knew that every time he did it, some of the money went into the man’s pocket, but he always gave some children duck food, and really, both sides mattered equally, there.
Snape was silent, just raising one eyebrow and letting his lip curl viciously. Draco turned away, ready to lock the door to his rooms and imagine that Snape might find another painting to haunt.
Oh, whatever had happened in the two days since Harry had finally woken up… it wasn’t what she’d imagined. Not after seeing the memory of Harry waking happily with Draco in a brightly lit bedroom at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Not after watching Draco change from a caring Healer to a worried friend, seen the anger at Harry’s Muggle relatives and his fear that Harry might never wake up. Draco was clinging to her because he needed to cling to someone, and Harry —
Hermione gritted her teeth, but nodded. For Harry, she’d do it.
“The Malfoys,” she said.
Harry didn’t once think about explaining to Grayson that usually the overcoat was worn over other things and didn’t get close to the sensitive skin of one’s scrotum.
“Not as good as I’ll feel when you start to move,” Draco replied, when he had his breath back. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and shoulders, his legs around Harry’s hips, clingy and needy and exactly everything that Harry had ever wanted. “For fuck’s sake, Potter, move,” he snarled.
“I didn’t see that she’d found those,” Draco said. He couldn’t see the photographs, only knew that Harry had likely kept them tucked away for a reason. “I apologise, Harry. She shouldn’t have —”
“Penelope,” he said, with a broad smile. He was in the day room, taking a seat beside a young woman who had been brought into the hospital the day before New Year’s. Almost three months, now. She gave him a weak smile; she had only begun talking a month ago, and her conversation was still scattered and difficult to follow. “How are you feeling today?”
Ron and Hermione shared a look, and Hermione appeared to kick Ron under the table.
Draco sat up straighter a bristled. “Of course I do.”
Draco edged nearer. An inch, two, five. A foot. And then close enough to brush his fingers over Harry’s side and make him shiver.
. Draco crumpled the note into a ball, and moved to toss it into the fire, awful illegible scratchy handwriting and all. And then he smoothed it out, cast a quick ironic charm over it, folded it, and slipped it into a drawer in his private potions lab.
“Julian?”
“Merlin’s sake, Potter, you eat like you were starved as a child. Ow!”
Fuck. Hermione, Ron — and Fleur’s little sister, it had to be, they looked so alike —
“What did you see in it?”
“I love it when you call me darling,” Harry replied, his pupils so wide and black that Draco had to wonder at it.
“Well, I’ll call my tailor in,” Draco said, like the enormous poncy git he was. He was smiling, though, and bumped Harry’s leg with his knee, under the table.
Or rather — it was Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place the way it was now, in the real present — every surface thick with dust and the gaslights struggling to illuminate the corridor, the landing. The door to Harry’s bedroom was open a fraction and the light in there was stronger, but still weak and watery.
Ellie and Harry were fast friends after that. She also had a glare that would settle anyone who wanted to come and make a fuss over Harry. It was of the Molly Weasley school of glaring and it was very, very effective.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, fuck off,” Draco said, his cheeks burning as he dashed for the stairs.
Draco forced himself to look in the mirror. He looked terrible, his usually pale skin almost grey and his hair limp. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d got even six hours of sleep, let alone the eight or nine that he’d enjoyed for his entire life. And he was trembling. His father would have been disgusted. Malfoy’s didn’t tremble. Blacks, neither; the madness running in that line was the type that heated the blood, not the kind that blunted one’s nerves. But Draco was trembling.
pussy hound. Her manager always trotted out some good-looking bloke for her to take to functions, but I knew her better. She stopped that nonsense. Stopped performing, too, she was bored to tears. Got married to this terrific girl in Tuscany and they bought a vineyard. She still teaches, though.”
“That was brilliant,” Harry said, happily.
remember. Don’t you?”
“I’d tell him I’m sorry I violated his privacy,” Harry said. “And I’d ask him not to hate me for it — because he’s so much a part of me now that I couldn’t stand it.” Harry’s expression softened just barely and his eyes searched Draco’s face, twice flicking to his mouth.
It was the week after the new school term started that Harry arrived at Ollivander’s one morning and knew that there was something wrong. He called out, once, twice, three times, and there was no reply, not even a shifting in the air upstairs. Harry climbed the stairs slowly, with pain in his stomach, already quite certain of what he was going to find. Ollivander had seemed so at peace, the last few weeks. He hadn’t worked at all. He’d drunk cups of tea, eaten nothing but cake and biscuits, and sat on his little stone bench in the courtyard behind the store, eyes closed, soaking up the air and sun and wind.
“I think it’s wonderful,” she said, quietly. “That you’re going to teach. I keep thinking about Dumbledore’s Army. How we learned more from you then than we’d ever learned in class — though Professor Lupin did a good job,” she finished, quietly. Another ache.
And if Potter — Harry — never got an opportunity to see that Draco had changed, then Draco might never learn how he had, either.
“I swear to you, Mother, if you make me talk about this I will move to New Zealand.”
Once the wand was almost a wand, a misshapen lump of wood with a core — it was desperate to funnel… well,
Draco shrugged, and then shook his head. “I can’t see the point.”
Something dangerous and cold gripped at Harry’s intestines, and as the song finished, the guitar player turned towards him, putting one guitar down and reaching for another.
As Draco finished in Mountain pose, and then changed his clothes to start his day.
“What in Circe’s name happened to you?” she asked.
“My Godfather. Sirius. I don’t suppose you ever met him, as a child, but I think he’s your uncle. Your mother must have known him. He was the only family I ever knew. Remus — look how gaunt he was.”
the pan.
“It’s not true.”
The first month after the end of the war — that was the easiest. There was a sense of celebration, even amidst all the funerals and mourning. Everyone had
Any other pig-headed patient who had put themselves into a months-long magical coma, anyway.
, he wasn’t sure he’d survive the hour.
“It’s… lovely,” Harry said. Fuck, one of these days he was going to need to make a proper home for himself. It was far too late for him to do anything about Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. He’d neglected her for so long she would probably resist any effort he made to nurse her back to health. But perhaps he could gift her to someone anonymously. Buy a flat, or something. Let Luna Lovegood help him to decorate it, that would make her happy.
It was a deeply uncomfortable feeling, achieving nothing.
days.
Draco dropped into a chair, all spindly-legged and frustrated, and Hermione Summoned a pot of tea and two cups.
Hermione gave a weak smile, intended to convey that Ron was managing with it as well as he managed with anything; by working hard the shop, refusing to think about unpleasant things and hoping it would all work out. She didn’t begrudge him that. “He’s well. Glad to hear you’ll be coming home.”
“Darling,” Draco said, stepping in front of him, bolder now. “You
Ollivander’s expression was almost serene, for the first time since before the war, Harry thought.
“You will take that hangover cure, won’t you?”
“I’ll become an Auror,” Harry said, surprised.
At 10 o’clock that evening, Harry and Draco lay on the mats, students gone, both exhausted.
Draco indicated the settee, and took the armchair. “How are you feeling?” he asked, trying to keep calm.
When she arrived back in her office, her eagle owl Persephone was perched on the back of her chair. She untied the parchment from Persephone’s leg and fed her a strip of dried meat.
Draco sat with quill in hand for a very long time.
The year after the Battle of Hogwarts had been a terrible one for everyone. There was little anyone could talk about then who they had lost, and who had done what. He’d spent that time, right up until their unprecedented eighth year at Hogwarts sharing a room with Ron and Hermione at the Burrow, and they’d all woken each other up with nightmares at least a few times a week.
me. And I don’t read well.” He flushed. “I don’t, and I read slowly, and for a long time it felt like the letters would change and flip about when I looked at them, but… I loved magic. I
, and the promise was evident in every syllable. “I swear, Malfoy. If you mean it — I’ll help. But it’s going to be hard. You’re going to be scared.”
. I can see it on your face.”
Mrs Malfoy turned to gaze on her husband’s portrait, hanging on the wall. He looked desperately sad, Harry noticed. As if he was listening to her speak, and felt such regret. Harry fancied his hand lifted slightly, as if to reach out, before he turned away, leaving only a sheet of white hair and the hint of a shoulder behind.
Silence.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “You’re going to go telling tales on me to the Minister of Magic?”
Draco helped her to the Floo, kissed her cheek goodbye, and walked back to the school with a head full of nonsense.
Harry slipped his hand between their bodies, conjured a little lube in his hand and took both cocks together, grinning when Draco’s head tipped back, insensible, his eyes rolling in his head. “Is that what you want?”
“Yes, thank you for reminding me of lessons I learned two decades ago — you’re a prince of a textbook, really you are.”
. You don’t owe the world anything else.”
When he had been somewhat reclusive, every time he appeared in public he was swamped with people who wanted to talk to him. Now that he was accessible, he was beginning to be just another British Wizard living in Diagon Alley. People thought of him as an excellent wand maker first, and Harry Potter second, and that was how he liked it.
“Wonderful! What are you reading?”
Harry shook his head, smiling.
When the hour passed, the hourglass trilling a sweet tune, Potter blinked awake; suddenly alarmed to have dropped his guard around Draco. Draco closed his book and moved back to the bench.
“I learned to ride a Muggle bicycle,” Harry said, with a laugh. “It’s much more difficult than a broom. And I’ve been feeding the ducks. Marvellous creatures, they are.”
“I haven’t seen him since… well, I tried to getting touch when his mother died, but…”
On instinct, Harry reached across the space and briefly gripped Draco’s wrist. Draco tolerated it for a moment, and then busied himself rearranging everything from his knees to his robes, pulling away.
Teddy’s hair turned abruptly white, like Draco’s, cropped close to his head. “Harry,” he said, reaching for Harry’s nose. “I’ve been thinking about certain things and I think we should go for some ice cream.”
And then the second month rolled around, and with it, hell.
Draco regarded him coolly. “I see.”
Draco pulled away.
“I know.” Draco hands shook and shook. He wondered when it had started. The end of fourth year, maybe, when he’d seen the crumpled body of Cedric Diggory on the ground outside the labyrinth and Harry screaming. Maybe later that night, seeing his ashen father clutch his arm. “Do you think he’ll protect my parents? My mother, at least. If I asked him. Would he help?”
“You promise,” Ron said, raising an eyebrow. He shucked off his robes and hung them on a hat stand.
; he’d never slipped into his own head in any of these memories, he realised with a start. Only ever feeling Harry. Harry’s feelings, Harry’s memories.
Pressing a hand over Draco’s hands, atop his knees.
“It does,” Hermione said, and she leaned in for a warm, familiar kiss.
“All Aurors have partners, Draco. And we often worked in groups. You look surprised.” He met Draco’s eyes for a moment. He could probably see the green-eyed monster lurking behind Draco’s eyes. Draco hoped not. All of this was getting ridiculously complicated without that to add to it.
“Apprentice wandmaker,” he corrected. “I don’t think Europe has a Headmaster, but I rarely read the Prophet these days. And who is this?”
. And he sacrificed a lot for the cause. But he was a bastard, and a bully, and I —
“Fuck, he’s coming,” Ron said. “What do we —”
“Think I’ll go to bed,” Harry said, before anyone could ask him any more questions.
He slept well. Or better, at least.
“This might be a good time to say something, Potter. Anything at all.”
Draco seemed to bristle at that. He closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. And another, and another. When he opened his eyes, he looked relatively peaceful again. Calmer, at least.
Blaise removed his hood. “Yeah. Two Aurors got turned into werewolves that day. Another four ended up in St Mungo’s for a week or more. Someone messed with Potter’s portkey, never did figure out who. He got there late, but he still made sure no one was killed. Including the… well, ‘Mione called them a terrorist cell at the time but it sounds so…
“And you, as well, Mr Weasley,” Malfoy went on. He met Ron’s eyes for a moment. Only a moment. “I’m sorry I called your family — what I called them. I’m sorry about everything. I hope you can believe me, though I am not asking for forgiveness.”
“Perhaps that can wait,” he said gently. “Fuck, Pot- Harry,” he said. “What happened to you?”
“Draco?”
looked like she belonged on a magazine cover. “And Draco Malfoy.” Hermione kept pushing food in her direction. She really needed something to soak up the alcohol. “Who’d have ever thought.”
“Odd,” he said, frowning.
was returning — they were all there. I wanted to take Draco and leave, hide in Norway or perhaps Hungary, where I know distant relations would have taken us in. But I couldn’t leave Lucius, and he refused to follow. He still thought Riddle was the answer to all of our problems. As if we truly
Draco followed him up the stairs to the guest room, and though Harry didn’t want to ask if he was anticipating Harry falling, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Draco was bracing himself to catch him if he did. He wondered if that was what it would take for Draco to put his hands on him. He wondered if that was what he wanted.
“Er,” Harry said. Really, he should have grown out of that by now. No, he should never have been allowed to grow into it. Those rotten Muggles. “Define a lot?” And then he shook his head. “I’m only supposed to receive post from people I know personally. Sometimes something slips past, though.” He looked embarrassed, despite his good-natured barbs. “It’s fine.”
Hermione leaned heavily against his side for
“Me too,” Alaric slurred. “Oh, but I did have a point, I almost forgot. The point is — I don’t know what’s with you and your, uh. Spindly potions master friend. But. Weirder things have happened. I guess it’s because of the…?”
“I’m sorry, ‘Mione. For everything. For — I know I must look like a coward to you.”
“I’ve spoken to Professor Piedamonte at the
Harry siphoned the potion into several bottles that Draco had lying about, and without need of his wand labeled them all. The raw power in the air made Draco shiver, with fear, with want, with… bollocks to all of this.
“I’m not the same,” Draco said evenly. “I know most people think I’m just toeing a line here, Harry, but I’m not. I was wrong.”
“What’s this, then?”
Who would know what to do? They’d never discussed it.
. We were sitting in front of it. Mirrors have reflections, so it stands to reason that I was sitting there like an idiot with my arms around my ex-nemesis while he sobbed through his childhood trauma and then found some fucking peace. I wasn’t staring at it every second, but I think I would have noticed if it made a rude gesture or something. What?”
Harry let out a content sigh and just laid there. He didn’t move from where he was still sitting astride Draco, nor did he say anything. He simply existed in that moment basking in the best afterglow he had ever had.
Harry glared at the blonde, giving him a once over and seeing the only marks from their activities on his pale body were the crescent marks on his chest. Which Harry thought just simply wouldn’t do.
Standing up Malfoy pulled on a hoodie and pushed past Potter, “Touch me and the only thing that will be dragged out of here is your body.”
After he finished reassuring Draco of the tap system, Harry let his jaw fall open and tongue loll out in invitation. Putting one hand next to Harry’s head, Draco used his other to push Harry’s hair back, before slowly pushing his cock into the mouth that had once thrown insults at him.
” Harry was cut off yet again with a long moan, his next words coming out nearly intelligble to his own ears, “please Draco, I want you inside me.”
Resting his head in his palm Harry slowly trailed his fingers down Draco's face and neck, gently brushing his fingertips along Draco's collarbone before pausing. Idly grazing over the raised silver line of a scar as he gazed at the rest of Draco's bare chest. Harry remembered the first time Draco allowed his shirt to be taken off, and the overwhelming guilt he had felt when Draco admitted that yes they were scars from what happened in sixth year and that yes, he thought they made him look disgusting. Harry spent hours that night tracing every inch of Draco's skin with his tongue and touch, whispering praises and reassurances as he mapped his body out like a new world explorer. Running his tongue and fingers along those silver scars has been one of Harry’s favorite things to do since then, and will most likely remain so until the end of time.
Draco hummed, “no idea.”
Leaning down Harry placed brief kisses on Draco's neck, wishing for a moment he could mark Draco's neck to show the world he was his, but that would wake him up and Harry didn’t want that just yet. He trailed kisses lower, pausing to gently suck on his partner’s rosy nipples, loving the small noises Draco was making, and the little twitches he was doing as a result of Harry's ministrations.
Harry’s voice cracked as he peered through his hands,
“It's obvious that he doesn't want to do that, s-”
Nervously glancing around the room, silver eyes locked with sparkling green for a moment, before he sighed and complied, “fine.”
, I- let me touch you, please.”
Potter rested his forehead on Malfoy’s, panting slightly, and not looking away as he said, “I would let him fuck me right here if he asked.”
he had no pants on
This is my first time really trying my hand at writing smut for other people to read so I'm not sure how well that turned out. Feel free to leave tips or whatever in the comments.
As Draco was walking over to the dresser he heard Harry tiredly mumble something about how great his ass was, and he couldn’t help but smile over his shoulder at his drowsy boyfriend.
“What do you want to do with him, Malfoy?” Theodore asked with a smug smirk.
Seemingly forgetting that they were in a room full of people, Malfoy felt Potter tangle his fingers in his hair and gently tug him towards his neck. Kissing down his jawline Malfoy gently sucked on Potter’s neck before doing something that, depending how you look at it, was either a really bad idea, or a fantastic one. He had paused when Harry let out a shaky breath, his lips brushing the skin of his pulse point before he harshly bit down on the soft skin. With the reaction Potter had Malfoy is pretty sure that he didn’t mean to do it, but he let out a soft moan and arched his body up.
With a laugh Harry let his face fall back into the blankets, “I’m never going to be able to masturbate the way I used to now. I’ve never been able to cum untouched by myself before.”
I tried to rewrite this as just some normal fluffy stuff with a pinch of angst, but my brain kept saying SMUT so my plans failed yet again. I have a feeling I'm going to end up writing quite a bit of smut for this fic and I can't say I'm all that mad about it.
Malfoy didn’t know how, but it seemed like Potter was thinking the same thing as him. One second they were just sitting across from each other while kissing, then the next Potter was on his back with Malfoy laying between his legs and his tongue in his mouth.
For a few minutes all Harry could do was sit there and tremble in Draco's arms. It was only when he felt Draco slip out of him that Harry felt any sense of reality return to him once again, “wow. That- wow.”
Apparating directly into their bedroom, Draco and Harry were kicking off their shoes and shucking off their jackets as they stumbled to the bed, their lips not separating once.
Chuckling darkly Draco brushed his lips against Harry’s, “no.”
Draco paused once he was fully inside Harry which, even though he had begged for this, Harry silently thanked him for. It had been a hot minute since he had something that large in his ass, but holy hell he loved it. He was so
For several minutes the only noise was the sound of the pair eating. Neither boy said a word as Harry carefully watched Draco’s expression as he looked over the papers. He was unusually nervous at how Draco would react to all of this because part of him was still unsure. There was this nagging voice in the back of his head whispering that Draco didn’t actually want any of this and that he was just biding his time until something- someone better came along. Harry knew these thoughts were ridiculous and that that wasn’t the case, but after spending over a month second-guessing everything Draco did, thoughts like that were hard to get rid of.
With already having cum three times it took less than a minute before Harry was whining around Draco's cock and squeezing his thigh to let him know he was close to cumming. The smile on Draco’s face as he realized what Harry was doing was downright sadistic, “oh, what a good boy you are,” his words cut off with a low groan as Harry moaned wantonly around his cock, “waiting for me to give you permission to cum.”
It was a nice evening. Not only did Harry not offend anyone, but Draco charmed the hell out of their waitress to the point where she put her number on the check before handing it to him. Harry would have been pissed if not for two things, first; he was happily buzzed, borderline drunk from the amount of wine he had consumed with his meal. And second; listening to Draco let her down in
“Yeah,” putting his hands on Draco's thighs Harry continued, “I’ll hit your leg… three times, if I need you to back off, so if I gag or choke or whatever don’t freak out and pull away. I’m okay with that. I want to do this for you.”
Malfoy stood up so he wouldn’t wack Pansy in the face and pulled his sweatshirt over his head, instantly everyone in the room gasped as they realized what they were looking at, at the scars. Malfoy was fairly certain it took Potter a moment to put two and two together, and when he did Malfoy honestly thought that the golden boy was going to throw up. Merlin, if his bastard of a “friend” had just changed the dare then it wouldn't have been an issue, but two can play at that game. Malfoy is a Slytherin after all.
Nipping at Harry’s ear Draco whispered, “what if I feel like riding you until the only thing you know is my name and how it feels to have your cock in my ass?”
Grinning Draco leaned back and pulled out so just the tip was inside Harry, before slamming back in, a punched moan escaping the boy beneath him. Draco had a bruising grip on Harry’s hips and the words Harry so desperately wanted to hear started flowing out of his mouth like water, “fuck Harry, you feel so good.
Grimacing Harry said sheepishly, “I’m sorry, I didn’t- it just snuck up on me… I mean
Harry winced at the soreness in his throat as he responded embarrassingly hoarse, “you know you are too Malfoy, don’t deny it.”
Awkwardly coming over the ravenette sat down next to Malfoy, their bare shoulders brushing lightly at the action, “Why am I over here?”
And Harry wanted to give him everything he had left to give, which just so happened to include what would probably turn out to be his most ridiculous adventure yet. An adventure that Harry was so lost in researching and making lists for that he nearly jumped out of his skin when Draco sat down in front of him with a bag of takeaway several hours later.
At this point they were both babbling between moans. Praise and compliments never stopped falling from Draco’s lips, and all Harry was saying were various forms of “I want you to cum inside me Draco” all of which egged them both on.
In the end, Harry and Draco decided on giving the Italian restaurant a chance, on the condition that Harry would leave all the Italian to Draco.
Stretching his long legs beneath the table Draco knocked his feet against Harry, not speaking until the other looked back up to meet his eye, “look, I know I don't usually talk about these things and that I- that I’ve always gotten cagey or evasive when you try to talk with me about feelings but you-” Harry could tell that Draco was uncomfortable talking about this, and the fact that he was pushing through it made Harry’s heart swell, “Harry you’re the best thing in my life and I’ll be happy with whatever we do as long as we’re together, just being with you is enough for me. And I also know that I don’t say it enough, I never have and even more so lately, but I do love you.”
Draco slowed but didn’t stop, “what?”
Along with planning his and Draco’s getaway, Harry let himself go out to meet up with his friends more, now without feeling guilty about enjoying himself or having to lie yet again for Draco. Not only that, but Harry more often than not found himself working into the early morning hours in hopes that he could catch a few minutes with Draco before they went to sleep.
Harry felt the slight blush cover his cheeks at Draco's words, confessions like this really were far and few between, and Harry wasn’t used to it. It was almost weird to hear Draco say those things, but fuck if he didn’t love it. It was things like this that made them who they were and Harry wouldn’t change it for the world.
Draco didn’t even question the offer as he shucked off his pants and positioned himself behind Harry. Harry had a brief flash of panic that Draco wasn’t going to prep him, which vanished with a whine as Draco slipped a lubed finger inside his hole. This was one of Harry’s favorite things about bottoming, the slight burn from the stretch of something going inside him.
And he loved those moments. The moments when Draco fell into bed next to him, mumbling hello and goodnight into his neck. The moments when Harry would still be in the living area when Draco would stumble in nearly dead on his feet, all but throwing himself onto the nearest surface which in turn had Harry carrying him to bed. He even loved the moments when he helped Draco go through his nightly routine because the blonde was too exhausted to do it all by himself.
Pulling painfully at those raven locks Draco said in a tone that left no room for argument, “I want you to touch yourself, I want you to get off while I use you like a good fuck toy.”
Placing kisses down Harry’s neck Draco brought his lips to one of the rosy buds on his chest, swirling his tongue around the sensitive skin before sucking softly. His labored breathing turned into an outright moan when Draco took it between his teeth and pulled away. And all Harry could do was watch as Draco did the same to the other side, a free hand toying with his abused nipple.
Harry hissed as Draco gently pressed at one of the numerous marks that painted his neck, “I wonder whose fault that is.”
Turning to face Harry Draco laughed, nothing but teasing humor in his voice as he said, “you really are a kinky fuck Potter.”
“You know the rules Harry. Now, let's see you boys get down and dirty.”
Draco a handjob would probably be enough to get him off, but he didn't want to. He was lusting after his boyfriend like crazy yes, but said boyfriend was working his ass off and came home every night exhausted. Harry knew that doing something like that, whilst enjoyable for both of them, would only tire Draco out more and could cause his mind to wander, distracting him from what he needed to be focused on. And that was the last thing Harry wanted.
Luna sitting in his lap; Theodore also made out with Blaise, and virtually everyone was shirtless. It was really turning into the kind of party Malfoy loved.
“Is it true that you like girls?”
Thankfully Draco had the brainpower to cast a cleaning charm to vanish the mess on the bed, and their bodies, before collapsing next to Harry.
The next morning there were dozens of letters and fire messages from the press, the ministry, and even some of their close friends demanding answers from Harry. But after their talk, and Harry’s partial breakdown, neither boy wanted to deal with anything that had an even remote semblance of responsibility. So they didn’t. The moment they woke up Draco blocked off the fireplace for firecalls, put all their mail in a box in the closet, and put up charms that repelled owls trying to deliver mail.
~~~~~
If Harry hadn’t been on his stomach on his bed pushing a finger into his ass, slowly working himself open, he would have heard Draco come home. If he hadn’t been moaning into the pillows he would have also heard the choked noise Draco let out at seeing Harry face down ass up in their bed.
Lightly hitting Draco's shoulder Harry sat up, “hey! I didn’t know what I was saying okay, you're the one who's good with languages, not me.”
“Do you have a crush on anyone?”
“Dray, I wanna-” Harry reached down and fumbled with Draco's belt buckle, “lemme touch you.”
For the first time in a long time Malfoy was speechless. He had no idea what to say. He could have just lied immediately and said no, but that brief pause showed his hesitation, and that was an answer in itself.
Sitting up as well Draco chuckled, “that’s true, I wouldn’t have made the mistake of asking that poor woman if her ass was on the dessert menu and if I could have a bite.”
Draco could never understand his fascination with the scars
Harry whined around Draco's cock, his own hips rutting into the mattress as he felt his own pleasure begin to build, “you’re so fucking- fuck,” Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hair and groaned as his entire body began to tense, “Harry- ‘m close. I’m gonna, I can’t-”
Waving his hand dismissively Draco rasped, “fine, I just need a moment.”
Pressing a soft kiss against Harry's neck Draco admitted, "I can't say the idea of choking you is one I'm all that interested in, but seeing you do it to yourself was
“Why not? We all know you have the mark.”
Harry’s mind began drifting to all the possibilities on what he and Draco could do, his cock giving a half hearted twitch just thinking about it. That twitch didn’t get past Draco either, “merlin Harry, I have never known of someone with the stamina you seem to possess. Maybe we could make it a whole scientific study that we could publish in the prophet,
Harry allowed himself a second to finally admire how debauched Draco looked under him; the flush on his face, the messy state of his hair, the wild look in his eyes as he looked up at Harry… It was a sight he never wanted to forget.
Brushing the hair out of Harry's face Draco said softly, "you should take a shower."
Grimmauld Place was, while not in shambles anymore, almost as dark and dingy as Harry had remembered. Part of him was saddened at the state of the house, but after the war, he could barely step foot inside let alone actually work to maintain the house. Yes, Kreacher did come here on occasion to clean, more than he ever had before Harry might add, but it just wasn’t all that it could be. This was home of the noble house of black and had been for generations, and yet it didn’t look it in the slightest.
~~~~~
Sucking on the lobe of Harry’s ear the older boy whispered, “then touch me.”
Harry felt more than heard Draco cast the spell, his magic washing over his tired body like a comforting breeze, "thank you."
When Draco's eyes opened a crack Harry began bobbing his head up and down in the way he knew Draco loved, and he watched as the blonde unraveled. Merlin, Harry could never get enough of the unrestrained moans and babble that fell from Draco's lips in moments like this.
For a moment everything seemed to still as he turned bright red and covered his face with his hands, “Sorry…”
you insinuate that Malfoy would do anything to me without my consent. He might be a right foul git sometimes, no offense, but he would never do something like that and frankly, I’m appalled that you think he would.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s chin and forced him to look into his eyes, “cum for me Harry.”
Malfoy sat up with a frown and went to tell Weasley off, but he hadn’t uttered a single syllable before Potter snapped at his best friend, “how fucking
Soon the shock of Granger's confession wore off and Malfoy was back to his drinking and had tuned out pretty much everything that everyone was saying, which wasn’t all that much. No huge secrets were revealed and no super dirty thoughts were shared. Although, as time pased and more alcohol was consumed, the dares were finally getting more scandalous with each turn; Granger and Pansy had a hardcore make out session (which left Weasley looking shell shocked), Seamus gave Dean a lapdance, Longbottom had made out with Blaise
Harry’s breath hitched at the words, his eyes scanning Draco’s face in search of any sign of deceit or teasing humor, an equally beautiful smile appeared on his face as he looked up at Draco, “not as beautiful as you though.”
Pulling back far enough to look at him Malfoy smirked, whispering, “Scared, Potter?”
“Why would you- oh… untie me would you?” with a wave of his hand Draco undid the spell holding Harry in place, and Harry did something he never thought he would. Turning onto his stomach Harry rose to his hands and knees, looking over his shoulder at Draco’s shocked expression Harry purred, “since I came in your mouth, I think it’s only fair if you cum inside me as well, don’t you?”
At first Draco was tentative, not even going in far enough to make it hard for Harry to breathe. So in true impatient brat fashion, Harry grabbed Draco's ass and shoved forward until his face was against a tuft of blonde curls and he was gagging around Draco’s cock. Draco tried to pull back but Harry held him firm where he was for a few seconds, before putting his hands back on Draco’s thighs, allowing him to set the pace once more.
“Like a date?”
Draco had a dark glint in his eyes as he responded, “maybe I could really tie you down and make you cum so many times you’ll be begging me to stop. It’s bound to happen again like that.”
Harry’s eyes rolled to the back of his head as he groaned and gagged around Draco’s cock, not waiting a moment his hand started flying over his own cock, desperately working himself to yet another orgasm.
Draco felt Harry smile against his chest, “s’good, one of my favorites actually.”
Pulling his mouth back some Harry looked up to see a beautiful flush crawling up Draco's neck and face. His lush lips parted with a quiet moan as Harry swirled his tongue around the tip, sucking down beads of precum that leaked out. For a few minutes, Harry teased and tasted the head of Draco's cock, watching as Draco's body began waking up.
~~~~~
Draco ignored the group as he grabbed Harry’s hand and took them back up to their room, quickly throwing up a locking and silencing charm to give them the privacy they deserved. For a moment the two just looked at each other, not saying anything. Then the next they were both moving and their bodies collided with a sudden need that hadn’t been there before.
