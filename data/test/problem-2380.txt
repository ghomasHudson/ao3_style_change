"I can't hear you if you're mumbling."
"Do you mind if we order something and eat in the office today?" Draco says tiredly, pinching the bridge of his nose. Harry stands up and walks over to him concerned, wrapping his arms around his husband's waist and pulling him closer.
"Stop looking at me like that," Draco says firmly.
"C'mon, Potter, now the real fun begins."
"You're so beautiful." Draco, being as unfased by Harry's anger as he ever was, stepped forward and wrapped the darker man's hands in his own before pulling him into a kiss then whispered. "Can I-?" he didn't finish his sentence, but he motioned in a way the other man could not misunderstand. He nodded slowly as the blonde lowered himself onto his knees (after aiming a well placed cushioning charm). "So, you're telling me no one else has touched you here?"
"But I thought-" Harry started again, but again his husband cut him off.
"No, just wondering what everyone was...er...up to?"
Draco pulled out as far as possible only keeping the tip in before slamming back into Harry. He kept his pace brutal as he wedged himself into the ravenette practically slamming into his prostate with every thrust. He leaned forward and bit roughly into Harry's shoulder.
Malfoy manor hadn't changed much since the war, it was still beautiful in that dark and mysterious way, but since Draco had taken it over it held a lot more items he used to be sure would make a pureblood blush.
"Not me! I want you to tell
part of us with the world. Our home. Our relationship. I was so used to it being about us that I didn't want anyone else to come in and ruin it. Then you were offered the promotion for the Auror position and I was so close to making Senior down with the curse breakers and I wanted to know that I had done it on my own. I was being selfish. I'm always being selfish."
"No, Draco, I
"Well, c'mon. Now it's time for the fun to begin." Harry stood on shaking legs with his head facing the floor as he followed Malfoy out of the punishment room.
Harry kisses Draco's cheek then he's off again.
"You still aren't listening, Potter," said the voice from behind him and he could hear the smirk on that devilish face.
the one being dramatic?"
"Uh- yeah, sure. Of course, Auror Potter, sir."
"What have you done?" Draco snarls, and he knows it sounds like an accusation because it is one.
"I'm going to the ball with Pansy, don't even ask," Draco says, not looking at him anymore.
"You promise not to laugh?"
"You're a sodding bastard."
"Actually," started Harry, standing up, but Draco cut him off.
"You romantic sod," said Draco finally, pulling Harry in for a kiss just as the door to his office vibrated with the sound of an excited knock and they pulled apart rolling their eyes. "It's Travis," the pale man said by way of explanation.
"I know you did. So, what did you
"I-I'm sorry, Master."
"C'mon then," Harry says laughing while wrapping his arm around his husband's waist and placing a kiss on his cheek. "Let's get some food in you, before you do some real damage."
"So," Ron started as he and Harry were walking across the courtyard, "what does she look like?"
"Alright," Draco said with a mix of excitement and nerves. He took a few steps back and appraised the man im front of him. "Let's see the surprise then."
"Change into something more muggle, yeah?" Harry said with a quirk of his lips. The blond agreed as he made his way up to their shared bedroom and began pulling off his curse breaker uniform and sliding into a more comfortable pair of slacks.
"I'm sure he could be convinced. I've heard you're very persuasive when you need to be."
"Fine. I'll take the floo." Without another word he stomped over to the fireplace in the pub, grabbed a handful of floo powder and called out the address to Grimmauld Place.
"It would've just been lunch with a coworker."
"I j-just wanted it to b-be over..."
"Yeah," Harry said cutting her off, "I just wish...I don't know- Did you ever feel like you wanted to tell everyone about you and Ron? Like you wanted the whole world to know?" he asked quietly, not quite looking at her.
"That's one way to put it," Harry said, finally opening the door and making his way out. "Hello, Travis. Goodbye, Travis. Lunch in an hour, Malfoy."
Another tear falls as she gets him to the altar. She pulls a handkerchief out of seemingly thin air and pats lovingly at his face before kissing both he and Harry on the cheek then taking her seat in the front row next to Pansy and Theo and Blaise and Greg and Millie and the rest of his friends who'd been there from the beginning. Ron and Hermione sat on the other side of the aisle where Harry's family and friends were. Even if they'd all become family and friends after more than 5 years together.
tall." When he makes eye contact with Malfoy again, his plan falls apart. "With the most beautiful grey eyes I have ever seen. And hair...oh Merlin, I've never felt hair so soft. Softer than a unicorn's mane probably, with all the bloody product Malf- uh...
"I will murder you, right here in the bloody library of you don't stop being such a git about this. I want you to go to the dance with me. I've asked you to. I apologized. What the hell do you want from me?"
"Alright then," Draco says as he sits Harry up against the side of a desk once he checks for the 5th time to see if he's breathing. He stands and dusts off his trousers then knocks Travis with a
about it first, so I wouldn't lose my sodding job."
"I work for the Ministry so far as it takes to pay my checks. But this job? The politics? It comes second to my husband, always has. Always will." He grips his wand tighter and sends an
Harry let his head fall forward in a mix of tiredness and shame before he heard the door close with a soft click and he felt the locking charm and the wards shift as Draco left the manor.
Draco promised to tell Travis the truth and Harry had agreed to apologize, but it had been almost a week since he'd seen the junior CB and he wasn't about to ask Draco where he was. His problem seemed to solve itself, though, when he was headed down into the lower levels of the ministry to pull Draco away for their monthly lunch date.
'. Purebloods.
"Can I-," Harry asked, reaching his hand out rubbing at the boys pale and lean body, then sliding his cock between Draco's arse cheeks.
The rest of their session melted into studying dragon form and techniques for besting them. Harry doesn't really remember a word, but the look on Draco's face as he talked about the creatures was permanently ingrained in his mind.
They're trying to decide which Muggle place to go to for lunch as they walk through the ministry on their way out. Prying eyes and ears had been following them all week and they thought a lunch out would be much more comfortable.
"You know that I would
"You haven't even been to the states before, mate. How'd the bloody hell you meet a girl without even going stateside?"
Draco gasped at Harry's honesty, but there was a smile rippling across his face.
"Alright, well, can I talk to you for a mo' then?" Harry asked politely and the younger man froze before agreeing.
"They did, then Travis had to go and tell everyone we were married." Draco's arms were crossed, but Harry looked away, back towards the road.
"Get out of my sight."
The day of the Yule Ball is one of the most stressful days Harry has ever had to encounter. His dress robes, though appropriate, were tight and uncomfortable because Draco had picked them out before the entire girlfriend-from-the-states debacle and he had said they made his arse look good. Ron's robes were hideous hand-me-downs and Harry wished he could have helped his friend, even if he did laugh all the way to Ravenclaw tower to pick up Padma.
Going back to the office is a show of self restraint. Harry wants to apparate them both home for a shag on the lounge and in the shower and on their four poster, but he doesn't. They both have jobs and coworkers who know they're married now and would know immediately what they've gone to do.
"Half of the stack is for Senior CB Malfoy, sir. He wasn't in his office and Junior CB Ackers said I might find him here."
"I don't fancy anyone," he blurted out. At their weird looks he blushed and turned away, clearing his throat. "I just mean, I have a um- a
"Will my husband be paying for it?" Draco said with a look of genuine concern that made Harry snort out a laugh.
"Your girlfriend, mate," said Ron, clapping him on the back. "What does your girlfriend look like?"
"He's head of his division you blundering idiot of course they listen to him!" A small part of Draco wonders if he sounded this deranged when he talked about
"That explains why you're always writing letters. So she's a wizard too, yeah? Not that she has to be of course, but I didn't think muggles really used owls for mail. At least, 'Mione said they don't."
Harry took a deep breath and turn his head to face him. They were not as far as Draco first thought.
“Awful. I’ve got tons of work.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about, Weasley. I don’t know anything about a ticket. Now, if you excuse me, I have to be somewhere else.” the redhead reached him by the arm to stop him from leaving. “Take your filthy hand away from me right now, or Granger will have to burden with a one-armed husband for the rest of her life!”
Tell me you didn’t sell it to someone else.” he was desperate. Andromeda looked at her nephew carefully, questioning his mental health.
Draco wanted to smile back at Harry when the brunet left, but he found himself unable to even blink.”
“You cannot go!” said Draco.
“I’m leaving now, Mr. Malfoy. All pending business were accomplished and I have listed tomorrow’s already.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The Apparition Room was one of the biggest rooms the ministry had. An almost-empty space with a high roof and dozens of non-existing windows. Golden tiles and little golden carvings all around the walls. Taking place in the middle of the room, a tremendous mirror-black sculpture. A grieving message written at the bottom
“I thought there would be more aurors around here.”
But he didn’t know if he could put his shame aside.
“I wasn’t talking about the ticket.”
Harry reached for a box while laughing again, opened it, grabbed something inside, and put it in the coffee maker. Water started to pour inside a cup. Perhaps it was because he was kind of jittery, Draco felt the need to talk.
Draco snorted. He was never a mess. At least his looks never were.
Draco thought.
“Mrs. Malfoy’s coffee has run out already, I checked it out and it hasn’t left France. Apparently, they have some kind of problem with his whole delivery system. If you wish to have some, I am afraid you’ll only find Common Salon’s coffee at this hour.”
It was a simple act of kindness, nothing more.
The brunet’s eyes shone, happy and ravenous. Both wizards extremely close. Harry grabbed Draco’s neck, pulling him closer, entangling his fingers in his blond hair, barely caressing his bottom lip with his thumb. When the brunet finally spoke, his voice was a whisper.
He was so close to know if he was going back home kissed or heartbroken.
Draco finished the firsts six months of his report and, for some reason he didn’t allow himself to think about too much, he told his assistant he would be the one taking them to the minister. It was a simple coincidence that the minister was in a meeting with the Auror Department.
Draco found himself alone in his office again. Through the fake-view window, he could see a beautifully painted pink sky, he wondered if it looked remotely the same outside. He doubted it. Draco stretched his neck and kept working a little more. It would be one of those nights.
“There’s a couch over there, if you’re going to take a nap.”
Draco took a seat in front of him, looking for his eyes. But the brunet was looking everywhere but him. In the middle of a cold silence, Draco prepared two cups of coffee. He put one cup next to Harry, and they drank without talking. Trying to act normal, he took a parchment and a quill from his briefcase and started to write. Harry did the same.
“I- I felt like craving something sweet last night, it was not a big deal. Ah- Anyway I came to ask you something. Last night Ron dropped our report and I was wondering if you happened to see it on your way up to finish yours. So, did you?” Draco felt like a fool. Of course, Harry didn’t go to his office just to give him a treat, what a stupid assumption.
Harry laughed again.
“Of course, your fancy French expensive coffee.” Harry mocked him without malice. They both smiled. “We are going to the same place; I’m meeting Ron there.”
Malfoy, but that was not the point!
“I’ve been meeting you on purpose in the lift for weeks. On Wednesday I told Ron I would meet him on that floor because I knew you’d probably be there. On Thursday I didn’t go to your office just to give you some homemade bread, I intended to asked you out, but I chickened out. The only reason I didn’t kill Ron when he lost our papers was because it gave me an excuse to spend time with you.” Harry’s smile grew wider. “I’ve been dying to kiss you again since years ago.”
“Absolutely perfect, Mr. Malfoy. That was all I needed to hear. If Mr. Adams is outside, please let him in.”
If there was someone who could suspect of him being in love with Harry Potter, it would be Harry Potter himself. He avoided thinking about such a sad memory, but sometimes he still saw it in his nightmares. The Battle of Hogwarts was almost over, the hall where he laid was proof of it, it was impossible to know if there were more bricks or dead people on the floor. The smoke was dark and thick, screams filled the place. Laid on the floor, he knew he was bleeding, crying, his whole body aching, but nothing was worse than the pain he felt inside his chest. He couldn’t save him. He couldn’t save Crabbe.
“You bought a ticket, didn’t you? Andromeda told me” said Harry.
“I guess we all did things we didn’t understand. It was holding onto a reason to be alive, or death. And that’s what I want to thank you for.” Harry wasn’t looking at him, his eyes focused somewhere on the floor. His hands clenched. Looking vulnerable and brave at the same time, like someone who jumps off a cliff, hopping there’s a net underneath. Draco’s knees were shacking.
said Harry, trying to emulate him. “You make it sound like something
The brown-haired girl petted her arm as a sign of comfort.
“I haven’t decided yet.”
Draco’s office was big enough to meet his standards, it had a large window that showed a non-existing view and a pretty comfortable office chair to those long sleepless nights that came at the end of every month. His job consisted in wisely employing money, though he couldn’t quite decide if that morning’s galleon would had been his best or worst investment. Sighing, Draco made himself comfortable and started to leaf through the documents in front of him. A couple hours after, he heard someone knocking on his door and, without looking up, he answered.
“Well, I don’t get it either. And I decided to stay so I could help you out with the coffee machine, on the first time I tried to used it, I made a mess. Hermione scolded me all day long.”
The blond heard the lift going up at the same moment he found the coffee maker. Now he only needed to figure how to use it.
“So, did you finish your report?”
Draco was not going down. He wasn’t as fool as to make his hopes grow. No. He was staying in his office, he was as sure of that as he was sure his name was Draco Malfoy. Well, technically his name was Draco
“You should take him to the next Friday meeting.” Justin left before Draco could hex him.
He turned to looked around, there were others witches and wizards picking them. They all read the same. 998.
didn't pull my wand out."
"I wouldn't sit there if I were you," Neville says politely to Travis before peeking at Harry from the corner of his eye.
"I don't think you even talked about Cho this nicely."
"No, yeah, she's a wizard. Loves magical creatures. Heard her say so myself."
"Could you please just call me Harry?"
"Well that's good, right?" asked Harry, laying his head on his husband's lap and looking up at him.
"Not by any means- Harry, it scares me sometimes, how much I love you, how much you care for me. You've wanted to tell people we were married for ages and I kept putting it off because I didn't want to affect anything at my job, but you've been so patient with me."
"Well of course I don't," the blonde said mostly on instinct in his snooty voice. At the look on Harry's face he continued. "-but I do promise that whatever you're scared to show me, won't make me love you any less."
"He won't actually leave will 'e? I can't apparate home like this!"
He almost does it anyway.
"Of course they do," Harry says with a roll of his eyes.
When Draco returns from his meeting, Harry is sucking on a sugar quill. His tongue has turned blue and he is fully ready for a proper meal.
. The worst thing, he thinks, is that as he is sitting with his pumpkin juice, Padma and Parvati long gone to dance with dates who were actually interested, he notices Draco dancing with Pansy. His hand is on her waist and his hair is in an intricate braid that falls elegantly down his back over dress robes not too different from Harry's, and he looks fantastic.
"Malfoy, just come to the ball with me."
Draco scoffed, but didn't deny the comparison as he looked up and asked why Harry was staring so intensely at him. Malfoy's hair was long. Longer than it had any right being, really, but Harry liked days like today where he kept it loose, only brushing it behind his ear when it became too much. Harry was curling a strand around his finger before he realized he was even moving his hand.
Once the fact of the matter that Hermione had a secret date to the ball was out, Harry decided to ask Padma and Parvati if they'd want to accompany him and Ron. They agreed and he thought that would be it.
"So," started Harry, peeking over at him out of the corner of his eyes.
"Not at all," he responds, but the air is already starting to buzz.
Draco finished getting dressed and slowly made his way to meet his husband down by the car. His mind was blasting through scenarios of Harry leaving him, but the man beside him practically glowed as he walked towards him. Some minuscule part of him still thought it was a trick. He couldn't think too much on it, because they were in the car and pulling off into traffic soon enough.
"Come to the Yule Ball with me," said Harry instead. Draco was looking at him angrily, as though he were being intentionally malicious.
"I can try. Was that all you wanted to say to me, sir?"
Draco began walking towards the door before turning to send Harry another feral grin.
"Bloody he- stop calling me sir." Harry took a deep breath to calm down. This kid had a way of pushing his buttons and he wasn't sure how to make it stop. "I just wanted to...er- apologize for my behavior at pub night, last week. And I thought I should extend an invitation for tomorrow. I know Hermione'll be upset if you weren't there. Other than her, you're the only other muggle born."
Draco takes a deep breath then as if he's preparing for something. Harry grabs his hand, intertwining there fingers and when Draco finally let's the breath out, it's a soft sigh of Harry's name. He sits up, turning slightly to face the darker haired boy beside him. The next time he speaks it's low and delicate and Harry knows it means something else altogether. "Are we still meeting in the library tomorrow?"
"Harry-"
Draco walks closer to the darker man who is sitting behind his desk looking off towards his charmed window and taking deep breaths. He takes a seat on his husband's desk and uses his foot to pull Harry's chair closer.
Harry's eyes are determined, the way they always are when he's talking about love and taking care of the people he cares about. It shakes him to his core to remember that Harry loves
the truth. Your friends and the rest of this damn idiot-infested school!"
Harry could almost hear the feral grin as it grew on the blonde's face.
Harry knew better than to answer and he held back a moan as the whip was replaced with a leather riding crop that seemed to be teasingly running up and down his thighs.
"I think punishment is my favorite part of keeping you, Potter." As he finished speaking he lifted the crop and sent it cracking across the globes of Harry's ass. "Count your lashes, slut."
"Weasley."
. Cares about
"If you didn't want to be with me, I wasn't going to make you," Harry says looking down at his feet. He felt tired.
He didn't think about the consequences until he was back in the Gryffindor boy's dormitory.
"You were never a Dragon Scout, you prat. You were raised by Muggles."
"You're brilliant at your job," Harry agreed.
Harry ignores him until he leaves.
Although they're studying and training together again, their relationship is still strained when the Yule Ball is weeks away and Harry isn't happy about it.
The music begins to start the ceremony and he watches as Harry rushes around towards the altar to stand and wait for him with nothing but love in his eyes.
angry. But not because of your stupid lie. I'm angry because you're out there lying by picking your favorite parts of me to build some perfect bride for you, and you know I'm not like that. I've heard the bloody stories from almost everyone still vying for your affection across the grounds. How beautiful and sweet and romantic she is." Rolling his eyes, Draco stands, and stuffs his things into his bag. "You can't just get rid of all the parts of me you don't like. You don't get to do that to a person."
"I panicked, okay! I was trying to tell 'Mione that I already had a date and Ginny asked who she was and then Ron kept asking about her and-"
"He's going to see right through you," Travis says, standing in Harry's way. He has his arms crossed and a put out look on his face. Harry is fully prepared to walk away when the junior curse breaker speaks again. "It's obvious that all of this is a ruse. You don't really care about him at all, do you? Just missed seeing your name in the papers, I bet."
Draco thinks it's different loving someone after you've saved their life enough times. Before, even after years of marriage there was always that part of him that still thought Harry pitied him. That Harry was with him out of obligation. Out of an idea of keeping him safe. But Harry was the one in trouble back at the ministry the past week and although Draco had saved him— saved the whole fucking DMLE if Weasley was to be believed— Draco would have gladly given his life to protect his husband. He had
Somehow, even having eaten at a muggle restaurant, Draco and Harry are plastered on the cover of the Daily Prophet.
"Potter, you can't
He knows that he should probably turn Travis in, but he also knows the younger curse breaker well enough to know it was a mistake and he knows, probably better than anyone, how a mistake can ruin your life.
reminded me that i never updated the full fic for this...so here it is. lol
"Mother," he whines because he didn't want to cry today.
"I'll buy you lunch, Draco. I don't mind," Travis said smiling in a way Draco was sure was supposed to be sultry, but this game want fun anymore.
," whined the blond before he noticed Travis had also walked in with Harry. "Oh. Hello, Travis."
"Are you not included in this
"Holy Merlin, if you don't tell him I am going to bloody murder him."
"Don't move. I will be back after work and I expect to fuck you again after you've stayed like this for a day. And I may think about letting you bathe. Maybe then you'll learn to not disobey me. Understood?"
"Yeah, I mean, Cho Chang's going with Cedric Diggory," Ron added unhelpfully,"Do you fancy someone else, mate?"
"Oh- uh...Auror Potter," said Travis with a polite nod as he lowered his hand from where he was about to knock on Draco's door. "Hi."
"Harry!" she said getting more excited. "That's great! It means he's making progress. He's comfortable in his career and more than comfortable in his relationship with you and-"
"I suggest you answer me before I hex you into next fucking year, Ackers. I swear to Merlin I will end you right now, if you don't tell me what you've done to my husband."
He watches as Granger’s face runs from angry to shamefaced, no doubt thinking that there was no way Potter will ever hurt anyone, even unintentionally, or possibly, that Draco probably didn’t even bleed red, that his getting hurt was out of the question. Draco thinks that the phantom aches of his chest, beg to differ.
It’s the last thing he wants.
See the peacock with the lazy eye? Must be a peacock-seer as it never, ever got caught, despite Draco’s best efforts as a child.
“Any reason as to why you seem to be intent on bringing down the house on our heads?”
He could have written letters. Sent flowers. Wooed Harry back, slowly. Not burst in and demand audience with Harry. But...if he didn't show courage now, didn't face what he did, and take responsibility for what he has done, then he doesn't deserve Harry's time, much less love.
Draco did not lie. It was indeed normal. Feeding from an Omega was comforting both for the Omega and the one nursing. Some say even therapeutic. Potter being moved by the act should even be expected. And if there was anyone most in need of therapy and basic comfort, it would be Potter.
Potter writes to him about the most inane things.
He wants to burrow himself into Potter’s arms, to feel the weight of them around him.
He really doesn’t want to do this. To choke down the no doubt delicious food and pretend like he isn’t a two faced lying cheat. To watch as Harry looks at him like he always does, like Draco is something precious, like he’s in lo--
At Potter’s stricken face he lets a mischievous smile grace his face before continuing with, “I think it needs more practice.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco fidgets with the edge of his button down, “The last time I was here…I never really expressed how sorry I was. For deceiving you like that. For...hurting you like that.”
“I’ve let this go on long enough. I believed you needed space, after which you would pull yourself together, making my possible interference unnecessary, but Draco, enough is enough. Get up, make yourself presentable, and
of catching me doing something nefarious and dragging me off to Azkaban yourself! You fucking-!”.
“You were practically gagging for it just last month. What changed?” Draco crosses his arms and tilts his chin in challenge. He watches as Potter’s eyes linger at his chest before the dark haired boy sighs. He seems to slump, all the fight leaving him, and Draco takes notice.
But with the way Draco had acted and decisions he made these past few years, it could be argued he was just as much at fault as his ancestors.
He’s in love with Harry and Draco’s ecstatic, elated and it’s--
“I was wrong for abandoning you like that. I’m trying to fix it now. Will you let me?”
Draco wonders if other couples -- as much as Potter and he can be called a couple -- have the same problem. If dating for them, also involved an abundance of conversations about housework and House elves.
A beat.
He was also to complete his 7
“Last night…last night was good. Since the war ended, I’ve felt lost. Like I don’t know what my purpose was, now that I’ve done what everyone expected me to do.” Draco watches Potter swallow slowly. His eyes snap up to meet green ones at the next words spoken. “But last night, for the first time in a long time, I felt something. I felt clean and light, like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.”
“Nothing’s changed, Malfoy. I still want it. Badly. But I won’t do this if you don’t want it too.”
Has Potter finally gone off the deep end?
“I want to say…sorry. About last night. You know, with the crying and everything.”
Draco begins striping, starting with his robes, which he folds and place atop a desk.  Just because he's doing something inadvisable doesn't mean he needs to be a slob about it.
He thinks he wants more.
strong enough to mend a broken femur. Potter’s gasp of pain and shock goes a long way in calming Draco.
He distracts Potter by nudging a cup of tea towards him -- Earl Grey, drowned in milk like Potter prefers, the heathen -- and watches as he takes a sip.
Still, even with the way he was raised in the back of his mind, the idea has been planted and Draco can’t help but entertain it.
Potter makes a grateful sound before he slips a large hand on Draco's nape and tilting his chin with his other hand.
Surely if people knew he was dating Potter, if the Golden Boy himself saw the good in him, surely people will give him another chance. Any chance, to redeem himself, his family, to prove that the name ‘Malfoy’ was more than bad in faith.
With that said, surely he was entitled to a break now and then.
He pushes Potter down, until the boy is sitting on the dark brown leather, with his legs spread.
He was going to give Potter what he needed, and hopefully when the other got tired of him,their relationship would have lasted long enough that Draco’s reputation would have been turned around for the better.
It is must be destiny, as Potter for whatever reasons, has stayed for the Christmas hols. Why he would choose to stay behind and spend Christmas alone, is beyond Draco. If Draco had the chance, he’d spend it with Mother in France, or somewhere sunny enough to turn him lobster red. Any place but here, where every corner of the castle seems to remind him of his past mistakes. But the Ministry is an ever- looming shadow in his life, and has forbidden leaving Britain for the length of time his sentence was still effective.
Draco wants to say that he never thought much about Muggles, that they were too flighty, too oblivious, but was grateful for these things about them, for it allowed him freedom to walk among them unnoticed. Especially in the beginning when even his ways of dress and manner of speech was much too foreign to properly blend in.
The Manor grounds are blanketed in white. It’s freezing and Draco let’s the curtains fall.
“You’re cooking. Why?”
kind would see him sent to Azkaban faster than you can say
When Potter is done he slides off his lap, taking care to keep them in contact. He takes a hold of Potter’s arm and pulls him down, until they are both horizontal, with Potter’s head lying on his chest.
“Good morning, Potter.”
“I’m sorry Malfoy. I am. I’ll stay away. Fuck, I-I’ll go now.”
But, with the way he railed on Potter the last time, it he’d look like an complete idiot if he went running to Potter and beg for him ‘to please suck my breast dry’.
The food sits heavy and satisfying in their bellies, warming them up from the inside. A walk would do them good, and as Potter has expressed a desire to see more of the Manor’s extensive grounds, Draco chooses to hit two birds with a stone.
He’s angry. He’s humiliated. He’s interested.
Draco finds an unused classroom. If he is going to have a confrontation with Potter, he wants it out of the way, with no chance of people coming upon them and assuming
Draco’s lips are dry and now it’s his turn to lick his lips -- something he never did, until the months with Harry.
“You smell good Malfoy. Even before you presented as Omega but now it’s amplified. And its been driving me insane.  Hermione, told me it’s the pheromones that you give out. But it’s not just that. It’s something else.”
be able to get the same amount of training aurors next year as always, but the ministry won’t be able to fully paid them the usual financial support. The budget for next year’s financial support will be set on the first week of the year. However, once next year finish, you will be able to offer each and every one of them a permanent position. My department foresees a tough year, but we will get through it.”
Draco seated on his office’s chair behind his desk, organized some papers, looked for his favorite feather and started with what he expected was his last hours of working on that stupid report. He craved for a full night sleep.
coat!”
“There won’t be another raffle.” said Harry. “I am really sorry, but I was against all this since the begging. I’m sure a reasonable solution will be arranged, but there won’t be another raffle.”
He decided.
“If you keep laughing, I’ll leave.” He said. Trying to suppress a giggle.
Harry started to walk and, before Draco could said something, grabbed the door knob. He stood there an extra couple of seconds and turned towards Draco.
Harry evened their faces to look him in the eyes. Plumped wet redden lips, flushed cheeks, expanded pupils. Draco loot at Harry, and knew him he sexiest man on earth. Harry grabbed his hand, and took it to his own crotch. Draco moaned again. Harry’s dick was as hard as his.
“Mate. If he doesn’t get it, just let it go. And stop sniffing on that
So, this is the final chapter! Please, let me know if you liked it. I'm gonna miss writing about these boys. Thank you so much for reading <3
Once Harry started speaking, he didn’t seem to be able to stop.
They never talked about it. Time managed to dilute the memory so much that sometimes Draco wondered if it really happened. But his heart knew it. He had kissed Harry Potter.
“I visit Teddy every weekend, so I knew Andromeda’s shop would sell some tickets. I-” Harry’s cheeks got redder. “I asked her not to sell the last ticket to anyone but you, to wait until the very end. But then Friday came and she owled me in the morning, telling me she still had the last ticket. I thought I had read you wrong all along, but I still wanted to try. I- I was about to ask you to go to the ball with me, but then Justin came and he said you were going with this Adam! I thought- I really thought I was mistaken, that you really weren’t interested… That night Andromeda owled me, she said you showed up with your hands full of knuts to buy the ticket. I didn’t understand why you did it if you were going with someone else. I still don’t understand it… All I knew was that If you had bought a ticket, then I would make sure you would win.”
Draco almost spit his coffee.
“Draco!” yelled Harry, clearly surprised. A tickling sensation making an appearance in Draco’s stomach as he heard his first name leaving the brunet’s lips. “Melin’s sake, Malfoy.” Harry rectified, much to Draco’s disappointment. “I thought you wouldn’t come.”
An hour after arriving to his office, Draco heard someone knocking on the door. He frowned and checked his watch, 9:00, it will be another hour before Amelia’s usual report.
. Next year will close with his boss’ retirement and six months before that they will look for someone to take his position. If Draco wanted to take it, it would really help him to count with the head auror’s support. And Draco wanted to take it. He knew he was good doing his job, and he actually enjoyed it.
Chapter three is already done (;
“You know there’s no other way, I have to go.”
“You can’t go,
“You were supposed to win that raffle.”
“Oh, right, right.” Draco thanked his good luck. “This Saturday is the new year’s celebration, isn’t it? I was thinking to ask Millie out, are you going with someone?”
Now Horry look kind of jittery.
“I’m awake!” he shouted, realizing he had been, in deed, asleep. Harry laughed.
Hope you enjoy it! (:
“I can’t go home yet; I need to finish these.” He was going to protest a little longer, but his reflection on a window made him stop. He was a mess. Hair in every direction, untidy clothes, red eyes. Merlin help him. “Alright, I’ll go home.”
"Do whatever you want," he said, his motionless body sprawled out on the lounge.
"What makes you say that?"
"You know you can help yourself to anything."
He was trying so fucking hard to be a better person. To not be the same person he was in school. That Draco was dead. He didn't exist. Not anymore.
Malfoy smiled. "That was because of you. Anyway, you've been at work all day. Let's eat."
Malfoy hummed. "Huh. Well, I just bought a baby name book and I just open the book and pick a name from that page and then cross it out. That way I don't choose the same name twice."
"You are the last person who should apologise to me."
Draco stood watching Harry as he left. He didn't know what had happened. It had all happened so fast. Had Harry brought up one of his insecurities? He felt like he couldn't remember what happened.
Harry nodded, grabbing his bag and walking out.
"It did," he agreed. "But I think we have a few things to work through."
They’ve been dating -- if you can call it that --  for a month, but they’ve barely seen each other. Draco is busy cleaning up the Malfoy assets and trying -- and failing -- to apply for that healer position he wants.
when the sweet scent of the flower hits his nose.
In the dark they whisper
He doesn’t say this things, but the slight curve of Harry’s lips says that he understands everything he said, and even those Draco did not.
Miraculously, Weasley, eventually steps aside-- dragging Granger with him -- to allow Draco entry. He’s steps into Grimmauld Place when Weasley’s
His eyes are gritty and his throat burns, but Harry’s gently rubbing hands make it bearable.
Harry steps forward, making Draco’s breath catch. More so when warm, rough hands press the chisel into his pale ones.
ugly and unpleasant but it had to be done.
Being nursed from is incredible. He can feel how his heavy, swollen tits are getting drained. Its simultaneously relaxing and arousing. Potter’s tongue gently coaxes his nipple to giving more and it tips the sensation into euphoria.
Potter's gaze is transfixed. And he finds that it does it for him. Having those eyes unable to look away, is very intoxicating.
territory with the intensity -and frequency- of his gaze.  At this point he wouldn't find it odd to wake up in the middle of the night, and discover Potter staring at him with his damnably green eyes.
He speaks about the transparent reasons for being rejected from the Healer program…
With the book gone, he steels himself before he turns to meet Potter’s eye. Sure enough, the blasted boy is staring at him again. He doesn’t even have the decency to look away now that he has been  caught red-handed.  The nerve! Honestly. But it makes everything easier.
Conversation was mild, yet interesting, interspersed by strangely comfortable silences. When they stood up to leave, Draco was shocked to find that over two hours had passed.
“I said no, Malfoy. If it’s the Life Debt you are worried about, then you are free, I have no intention of collecting.” Potter’s jaw is set and Draco watches a tick in the pronounced angle of it.
Potter rants and grips the news paper so hard it crumples in his hand.
But Potter is tugging at his arm, drawing him away towards a bush sprouting golden-pink flowers. He doesn’t recognize them, but they seem harmless witch is just as well as Potter proceeds to duplicate them with a twirl of his wand.
Now that Granger knows, and possibly other people in Potter’s life as well -- Ronald Weasley has taken to glaring at Draco from afar, and Luna Lovegood has recently wished him luck-- it seems that the unspoken agreement to keep things quiet is broken.
At a loss, Draco responds just as inanely. Agreeing that it’s good for him to keep up the care of his ancestral home. Never mind that had it been bequeathed to Draco’s family, the place would never have fallen to such disrepair. The last part he is smart enough not to say.
“How did you know of this place? I expected somewhere…more.” Potter’s skin looks darker underneath the dim light of the pub. Green eyes glinting when they catch the light of the sparsely placed lamps. He looks uncomfortable at expressing his expectation of a place where they would be easily recognized. Draco chooses to ignore this, no matter that Potter had nearly been correct at his assumptions.
Draco’s eyebrows rise at the apology. This was not what he was expecting and he stares into Potter’s eyes. His eyes were always so expressive, one could always find out what he’s thinking through a glimpse of those bottle green eyes. Even the hideous glasses he wore could not hide how vivid and passionate those eyes were.
, he can’t be sure -- and he’s taking the corner a little too fast when he sees them.
Draco regards him for a moment, before he speaks. “It’s not stupid. It’s completely normal.”
Needless to say, he does not know how to deal with the dark haired boy.
He falls in love with Harry on an unremarkable day. He hears his a tinkling laugh that could only be his mother -- but it’s been so
Now those all pale in comparison to what he had with Harry.
“Good morning.”
He sees a pair of gloves, dark brown and butter soft, and he buys it without a second thought.
If this keeps up, it’s only a matter a time before everyone knows about them, hopefully making his plan come to fruition.
He thinks--
It takes a while for Potter to come find him, but by then, it was just the sausages left to fry.
But Merlin, was he awkward. It seemed that Draco returning the favor of staring, was enough to shake Boy Wonder in his ratty Muggle shoes, for he’d now looked away. The raven haired boy had migrated to a nearby desk, the top of which he was gripping with such force, his tanned fingers were turning white. He his other hand was fiddling with his bird-nest hair and his breathing was ragged and-
He talks about before. About how the Ministry sanctions were so bad, he was afraid to even breathe wrong. About how Mother couldn’t go out without being spat on, and how Father in a true show of loyalty, had fled the country into parts unknown, leaving Draco to deal with the fall out…
a long time, and I can’t let you go, not without a fight. Not without at least trying. It’s selfish, I know. But please, please let me try again.”
He knows this, but it does nothing to stop the queasy feeling in his gut, the lodged words in his throat that if released would insist that he wasn’t out to get Potter.
After what seems like both a short and interminable amount of time, the clothe is finally slid off, baring Draco’s chest to the cool air of the room and Potter’s appreciative moan.
Really it was the only explanation why the shittiest things happen to him.
There’s no better way to answer that statement than with a kiss.
If he does, Potter says nothing except, “We usually find the best things when we’re not actively looking.”
For a moment Draco is at loss for words. He nearly forgot how attractive he found Harry. And watching him now, engaging in such physical labour, brings the hunger surging back in force. He wants to keep watching, to preserve this moment forever, but far too soon, Harry is turning, catching sight of him, his face giving nothing away.
For a bonafide hero, there is not much change to Potter. If you disregard the new found height and muscle definition, he is still the same scruffy boy he once knew.  A scruffy boy who wore the cloak of power like it was nothing.
Instead, Draco angles his head down, and kisses Potter’s lips, his cheeks and the corner of his eyes, tasting salt.
There seems to be some unspoken agreement between the both of them, that this, their relationship they are trying to build is to remain a secret for a little longer.
He thinks about taking Potter somewhere fancy. Somewhere with glittering lights that required fancy dresses, where everyone and anyone will see them. He imagines Potter all dressed up in smart robes and shiny shoes, but his insides give a curious little wiggle, so he gives it up as a bad job.
“Okay?”
He doesn’t read the paper, and he thought neither did Potter. If this was what happened when one indulged in questionable reading materials, then Draco is justified in refraining from even picking up the things.
As such, there has been no occasion to meet and be alone for more than a few oddly tense instances.
something.”
When Potter kisses him, the world quiets down.
The other boy shakes his head, and keeps his head down. He mumbles a mortified sorry, that cracks at the last syllable.
Mother stands at the windows, wand raised, clearly responsible for the sudden assault on his vision and the loss of his blankets.
He may have invited the other out, but it was more of a spur of the moment decision, born out of impatience and recklessness.
“When you were…tasked to fix that cabinet,” her voice wavers, but she pushes on, “you did it. You we’re terrified, and completely against it, but you had no choice and the outcome scarred not just everyone else, but including you.”
Their lips cling to each other when they part. And when he opens his eyes, he finds Potter's eyes,  boring into his.
He's ashamed to admit that he may have practically fled the one time he'd dropped his quill and Potter had given it back to him, along with an wobbly smile.  In retrospect running away might have been the better part of valor when it comes to Potter, especially since he has yet to properly thank the former for saving both him and his mother from the tender mercies of Azkaban. The Dementors may be long gone,  but the Caribbean, that place was not.
“If I spent all my time getting angry and upset at what people say, about my family and I, I wouldn’t be doing anything else.”, Draco nudges the filled plate to Potter, “The question is, why are so worked up? I would think, by now, you’d be used to being disparaged by the news.”
Can true love grow on rotten foundations?
So he says to Potter,
He’s going out with Potter, but if not even Draco can feel that he is, how else will everyone believe it?
He wants.
he asks.
Draco never thought much about the future and what it may bring. But with Harry, he’s beginning to care.
Draco has nothing to say. He never imagined that Potter would feel that way about him. No one ever got angry in his behalf. It’s a heady feeling, one that has Draco’s toes curling.
Harry has opened up the formal dinning of Grimmauld Place, cleaning it up and illuminating it with softly shinning candles. There’s soup and roasted salmon in truffle oil, and apple based pie for after. Harry is smiling shyly at him because he likes monthly romantic dinners, and he thinks Draco will laugh at him.
Draco puts away the book he brought to dinner. He’s taken to reading during meals, since it provided the chance for him to learn and shielded him from the scrutiny of other students. His current favourites are books on Healing. Who knew the body could be so interesting?
“Listen closely, Malfoy! You better don’t make a fool of him or I will-”
. It will be one of those few weeks. Maybe going home to get some proper sleep will be no option for the next couple of days, not if he wanted to have his report done on time next Friday, and he really wanted that to happened. The clock on his wall ticked and it wasn’t until his stomach made a funny sound, he realized two more hours had gone by.
He turns to leave -- better to do his browsing another day -- but Granger just follows him and blocks his way, swiping at unruly curls that have escaped her bun.
“Yes it is.” Draco guides Potter to his other tit and allows him to suckle again. “It’s alright. Don’t worry. Take as much as you want.” His words and the hands that pet Potter’s hair and back go a long way to calming Potter.
Loving is rubbish, utter bull.
“Do you know what you’re asking? No proper Pureblood would do such a thing with someone they’re not mated to. It’s intimate Potter! On can’t just whip out their tits willy-nilly and- and
.oOo.
--and everything’s quiet.
He hopes Harry likes them.
Finding out he was an Omega was not shocking.  His mother was one, therefore there was always a chance he would turn Omega as well, no matter what his Alpha father must have desired at one time.  However presenting as he did could not have come at the most opportune and simultaneously irritating time.
Feeding on an Omega was special and intimate. Mostly reserved for between mates and for caring for the off-springs, because the comfort and closeness experienced by the individuals participating in the act was incomparable.
Draco forces himself to meet Potter's eyes loosing himself in the vibrant green. So much so that it's only Potter's gasp that alerts him to the fact that he's shed his school shirt.
He knows his body expressing milk only happens for a three to five days a month. He also knows that it’s only his inherent need to blame Potter for everything has him fancying that it’s other boy’s perversion that is influencing his body’s cycle, and causing it to be seemingly overzealous in producing milk.
It’s the beginning of the end.
“Wait, Potter. What if I tell you…me offering this, is not just about the Life Debt?” Draco nearly cringes with how close to the truth his words are. But there’s a spark of interest in those green eyes, and he forges on.
How the papers paint Draco a villain.
Honestly, he can't take it anymore. It has to stop. Part of his resolution when it came to the second chance at life he given, was to face all his problems head on. As much as possible, while still retaining his Slytherin cunning and self preservation. And in the past, he never gave Potter and inch, no matter what the other boy threw at him. Now was not the time to start.
Draco has a long history of failing to think past the outcomes of his decisions. He sees something, is presented with a situation and he figures out ways in which he can manipulate things for his benefit. He achieves his goals, but he fails to think in terms of
Having an Omega either as a spouse or child was said to be good luck and showed a sign of good pedigree. Gone were the days when Omegas were thought to be properties, useful only as pretty ornaments and for the purpose of breeding.
And then Potter is getting it, face transforming into wicked determination, fingers descending into Draco’s sides.
He rocks back in his ratty Muggle shoes, running a hand through brunet locks and says -- all casual, "So, Malfoy, what do you think about going out with me?"
“Malfoy,” Potter begins cautiously, “… I got your Owl. You said you wanted to meet?”
When Potter said he would stay away from him, he thought it meant the other boy would just keep his distance, and time-willing, they’d both forget the bizarre meeting they had.
Yes, this past few months he has truly felt what it was to be lonely, but he'd rather be a lonely depressing excuse for a wizard, than be liked for the pheromones he gave off.
Granger chews her lip for a split second before she visibly gathers herself to steamroll past his points.
When Potter has calmed, Draco tells him that is fine, they had to face this eventually, and now that it’s here, they’ll deal with it together. He says, “I’m a big boy Potter, I can take care of myself”
“Yes indeed. And that’s his right. However, remember the saying? Nothing ventured…”
That Draco is a dirty bastard, and quite possibly the devil incarnate, second only to You-Know-Who.
He slowly runs his tongue along his lower lip, smirking as Potter’s avid gaze tracks its progress. “We can try to be friends, Potter. And if that works out, we can try being more? There’s something there, if we go by last night.” He raises a sleek eyebrow, and hopes he doesn’t look as nervous as he feels. It wont be the first time Potter has refused an offer of his. He doubts that his reaction to rejection now would be any more dignified than the past years had been.
Potter tilts his head slightly, eerily perceptive eyes trained on Draco. Somehow it feels like Potter can hear all of his other thoughts.
Harry licks his lips. And like always, Draco’s eyes follow. “You want to get back together. To what we had before.”
It’s barely a few moments when he hears footsteps. There is a split second of hesitation before the door opens, and in comes Potter.
She’s right of course. He may not be worthy of Harry, but he’ll never be, if he doesn’t do something to
Draco wonders if Potter is aware that his anger is causing a number of household objects to hover and in the case of a small clock -- to orbit him.
Draco nearly rolls his eyes. Trust Potter to state the obvious. But now is not the time for that.
His ancestors must have committed such heinous crimes, and angered some god enough to curse his whole lineage .
“I realized what it was the day you left potions 3 weeks ago and you had a s-stain on your shirt around your chest and it was the most amazing scent I’ve ever encountered in my life.”
He leaves Draco gaping at the empty classroom, wondering what just happened.
“He could say no,” is his dejected answer.
With that done, he stands up, and walks straight out of the Great Hall. No need to look back and check if Potter is following. If there is one thing that boy can’t resist, it’s his curiosity.
Draco isn’t quite equipped to say anything against the accusations -- as they are quite true -- and neither is he competent at getting someone to calm down -- much less Potter-- quite the opposite in fact, so instead he tracks down the kitchen of Grimmauld place and gets to work.
“It means, Malfoy, that I want what you’re offering. But I wont take it if its just for a Life Debt, or as a payment for anything. I want you…to nurse me because you want to, and not for anything else.”
Except this was not what was happening. Potter literally
She was right, as per usual -- Draco is indeed using Potter to better his social standing-- so in all honesty, his feathers shouldn’t be so ruffled.
For the first two months,  all his suspicions were correct. He was among the only Slytherin of his year to come back (Blaise had run off with his mother while she hunted for new victim/ husband, Pansy had gotten married to a Pureblood in Italy with no plans to return in the near future, and Greg was carrying out his one year sentence in the dreary walls of Azkaban), and those who did, gave him a wide berth. Draco did not blame them.  It would have been stupid to associate with him, what with current climate of society that was decidedly anti-Slytherin and by extension anti-Malfoy.  He was shunned, and a couple of times he was assaulted, though both times he managed to get the best of his assailants. He may have been reformed, but no way in Hades will he allow idiots, too cowardly to stand up for themselves during the actual war, to take it out on him, now that everything was safe.
He buys them just because.
“Or am I not worthy of such consideration?”
Potter stares at him. And since the prat has no social etiquette to speak of, Draco uses the chance to return his stare.
A whimper escapes him, his own hands rise to clutch at Potter’s firm shoulders. When Potter’s tongue strokes his, gently, curiously, Draco presses closer, molding himself to Potter’s burning chest.
“No? Why the fuck not? Didn’t you say you want this?” Draco is indignant. If Potter is fucking with him…
He makes his words silky and his best drawl is put to use, anything to make her just as angry as he is.
The firelight is not nearly as bright as Potter’s smile.
“What if I say, you are not the only deviant in this room? I’m a Slytherin Potter, I just don’t have a single reason for doing things. Suffice it to say, that- that I want this too.” Somewhere along the line, Draco closes his eyes. Honesty is part of his resolution, but no one told him how hard it would be. How painful it was to admit to the things wanted, and to make himself vulnerable.
He startles when he feels a warm hand clasp his. He looks back at Potter to find him staring determinedly at Draco.
However, he had paid for his mistakes. In blood, tears -and at times he felt like- with his soul. No one who experienced the dubious privilege of the Dark Lord practically breathing down his neck for more than a year, could have said he got off lightly. The things he did, the things he saw and the things he felt… Let’s just say the nightmares he endures these days, barely holds a candle to the reality he witnessed.
--” she spits the word like it’s poison in her mouth, “--you is a good call, but I know better. I won’t let you take advantage of him.”
But he digresses. Potter staying behind allows Draco the opportunity to send the Gryffindor a discrete Owl, stating that they should meet. If Potter agrees, he’ll have the boy to himself, without the danger of Potter’s nosy friends bursting in on them, and fewer overzealous teachers around to monitor students.
Harry spins the chisel he has in hand. Over and over, each revolution wrecking havoc in Draco’s gut and composure, waiting for Harry to speak. For each second that feels like an eternity, Draco realizes what kind of fool he was, coming here, after
What was he thinking? How could he let his impulsiveness get him into this position? He knows he is on probation. Everything he did would be under close scrutiny, and what better way to violate his probation than offending the Golden Boy himself? The very person to save him? Wrangling with Potter never ended well for anyone. Just look at the Dark Lord.
She left him to pick up the pieces of their life, and now she’s berating him for doing the same thing.
Draco is glad. If nothing else, at least he did something right by encouraging Harry, once the brunet confessed to being interested in making things.
on Draco’s-. Damn he couldn’t even say it in his own head. But for each instance that he recalled Potter and what he wanted, Draco couldn’t help but feel both horrified and to his eternal shame, intrigued.
He settles down to wait.
“It’s nothing, Malfoy, I’m just stupid. I won’t do it anymore. Let me go-”. Potter tries to pry his hand out from the grip Draco has now turned on him.
Potter rubs his rough thumb over the back of Draco’s hands, causing the blond to shiver. Draco finds he can be brave once in a while.
, bracing himself for the kiss.
“Why aren’t you angry?”
Potter says he wants to live for himself a little. See if the things he wanted in school, are still the same now.
On one hand no matter what people believed him to be, they thought twice before they tried anything with him, for upsetting an Omega - even one as disgraced as he- was generally frowned upon.  On the other hand,  along with the new found tentativeness around him, he gained the attention of people, who just a week ago would not have given him the time of the day.
Draco shushes him. “Close your eyes Potter. Sleep.” Potter remains stiff, which Draco rides out. After a while, the other boy relaxes.
He thinks his plan has failed. He may be above Potter right now, but with the amount of desire in Potter's eyes, any delusions of control Draco has, is rapidly flying out the window.
Draco tucks his hair behind his ear and turns away from the Gryffindor, “I told you it’s fine did I not?”. He can’t help the slight sneer in his voice. After all its still Potter, along with the low hum of embarrassment he feels, it is easy to fall back on old habits.
“Potter.”
side- to tide him over when the fear for his life and that of his mother’s got so strong that he could barely breathe.
“Wait!” Potter hesitates and turns towards him.
Warm hands settle tentatively on his hips, keeping him secure as Potter starts nuzzling him, his chest, his neck, his jaw.
And Draco -- once his brain starts rearranging itself into some semblance of order--
Truth to be told,  he would have much preferred to have completed his studies alone, and only return to take his N. E. W. T. S. He knew what he'd face if came back,  but as previously stated,  fate seemed to have it out for him.
With a horror Draco knows exactly what Potter is trying to say, and he tries to stop the other boy, but it’s too late. It seems that now that Potter has started, there is no stopping him.
But Potter makes no move. He brings his other hand to frame Draco’s face, seeping warmth to chilled skin. They watch each other for a while, cataloging each others features. Potter is his direct contrast. Dark unruly hair to Draco’s flaxen nearly pin straight one. Sturdy bones to Draco’s sharp angles. He looses himself in the dip of Potter’s clavicle, revealed by his smart dress shirt.
And his mother’s hands are warm and gentle as they squeeze his, tugging him down until sits and accepts biscuits and warm drink.
They have sex a frankly absurd amount of time.
He turns back to the other boy, whose head is angled down trying to keep the blood from getting to his shirt. He doesn’t know what to feel.
When it’s over and Mother has excused herself, heels clicking on the polished marble floors, Draco stands as Harry hesitantly explains.
His mother notices him and beckons him forward with a , “Draco, darling, come sit! Join us for tea.”
He wagers Potter’s mouth and rough hands would feel heavenly on his swollen tits right now.
Draco contemplates his answer even as he absently serves Potter some eggs.
For a Pureblood like Draco, he was raised that all acts like this were to be done in private. Hell, if one was able to avoid engaging in such acts, they were encouraged to do so. Never let it be said that Purebloods did not find ways to complicate life.
the one looking for trouble.
And if the thick length he feels pressing against his abdomen is any indication, Potter is hard a well. It’s a simple matter to grind into the hardness he feels. The burst of pleasure that runs through him is so good, that Draco does it again and again. Potter does not disappoint, and brings back his hands to grip Draco’s waist, helping him grind down while he lifts up to meet Draco.
Potter strokes his hair down, calms Draco with dragging touches on his arms.
Draco pointedly pries off Granger’s hand when her grip threatens to cause him permanent harm.
“Yes, Potter. I did want to meet.” He considers the other boy carefully. “I thought about our last meeting, and I believe we can come to mutually beneficial arrangement.”
He sends off that letter before it fully dries. For some reason his fingers shake just a little. Nothing that clenching them hard wont fix.
Potter smile is both sensual and soft, illuminated by the sunrise that has reached the couch they are sitting on. It makes Draco’s heart race and the hand in Potter’s-
They talk about the war and it’s
Fuck, he forgot about his support clothe. Shame burns Draco's cheeks. He wants to run away.
Potter’s face on the other hand had lost the shock it sported at the beginning of Draco’s speech and was now set in grave lines. The intensity he first noted in Potter’s face was back, and up close, it was even more striking.
He reins in the myriad of responses he wishes to say, each more scathing than the last, but this is Granger, and Potter loves her, so he says, “He’s a grown man, Granger. Also, you’re not his keeper, let him make his own choice for once. Good day.”
so fast, for fear the the offer would be retracted. He wouldn’t have said yes to them, because they are not Harry.
"Malfoy, fuck. Please, can I take it off for you?".
Draco thinks--
Its only when they both feel the stiff muscles of Draco’s neck relax, his jaw soften, does Potter stir. He makes his approach slow, showing his intent, allowing Draco to back off. When Draco shows no signs of displeasure, Potter closes the gap between their lips.
That they insinuated that Draco was up to no good.
And it’s awkward, alternatively hesitant and eager, resulting in bruises both planned and not.
Harry is looking at him. Eyes burning, pinning Draco in place, as he spin, spin, spins the chisel.
Everything is a blur and passes in a daze as he sits back and watches his lover and mother interact, as Harry rubs on his neck, ears darkening as his mother sly teases him on their relationship and other things.
Steps meandering and no way in a hurry, Potter eventually settles beside Draco, looking out towards the great lake.
“Is that it, Potter? You think I’m up to something again? Typical, really. You show to the world that you’re all forgiving and kind, when in reality you only spoke up for me, just so you can have the
It was yet to be determined if the change in the way people regarded him after he presented was for the better or for worse.
He’s in love with Harry, and its the best thing that could ever happen to him.
Anytime Draco so much as looked at him, he seemed to simply vanish. If Draco so much as glanced in his vicinity, the raven-haired boy was disappears in a blink of an eye.
It’s selfish. It’s disgusting, and if he really thinks about it, Draco hates himself just a little bit more. But it’s this, or face the continued scorn of the Wizarding world.
“Sometimes I wanted to be alone, but at the same time…not. One night, I stumbled on this place.”
And another.
Potter is sucking his Adam’s apple and biting at his clavicle, hands restless and hot, and Draco can’t say if its the firewhisky he had, or Potter’s burning mouth that has the room spinning.
This time, when they part, it’s only after a long, long time.
“What I mean is no; I’m not asking you to get back together. I don’t have the right, not after how I lied to you. Only you can decide that, and I won’t force you. But, yes. I..I want to try again, Harry. You were the best thing I had in
“I liked last night too. If you want…we can do it again.” Draco feels his cheeks burn, but he doesn’t look away from Potter.
At Draco’s lifted eyebrow, Potter begins his rant.
And it hurts, their insides feel soft and tender, but their wands remain where they left them, far away from either of their hands.
Draco nods. She’s his mother after all. When all things are said and done, they always put each other first.
Thankfully, that was all in the not so distant past. The war was won and the heroes lauded, the villains incarcerated and the dead buried and mourned, and now there was not much to do but to move on with life.
This time, Potter is seems incapable of asking permission, for he just groans and latches on to Draco’s leaking nipple. Draco cant help the gasp he lets out from the feel of Potter’s mouth. The raven-haired boy gives a gentle suction that goes straight to Draco’s groin.
“... Go on.”
They curl up in bed, close, seeking to chase off the chill of the war clinging to their bones.
He did not know what he expected, but random Owls and just the one tea, in the dubious charm  of Grimmauld Place, is not it.
But while the stereotypes have relatively vanished, Omegas were still considered weak by some. But Draco will be damned if he permits anyone one else to think he was weak.  Not after the Dark Lord.  Not after Aunt Bella. And not after his father.
This is it. He’s convinced himself that he has to do this. That he owes Harry this, if he truly does care for the man. Draco’s not hoping for forgiveness, not even even imagining that they get back together, but at the very least, he owes the both of them this.
Draco stares into Potter’s eyes and gives his head a jerk.
.oOo.
Blunt fingers bury themselves in Draco’s hair, fingers softly scratching at his sensitive scalp.
Draco runs gentle hands down Potter’s back, the rhythmic motion lulling them both to sleep.
With that Potter sprints away and is out the door in record time.
That there were hundreds of broken hearts -- male and female -- just waiting for Potter to see sense and come
Potter too seemed to have taken up the cause, if the rumors of him intimidating Draco's would be attackers had any truth to them.
“I enjoyed myself.” Potter says when they find a darkened alley they can Apparate from.
What? Draco has always been saying from the start that Potter was a self-sacrificing idiot, but no one listened. If only people could hear this now.
There’s a quiet snick -- a door opening and closing -- and a rustle of skirts against carpet floors. Suddenly, bright sunlight floods his room, his numerous sheets dragged off his shocked form.
Once Draco’s laughter dies out into the night, the have sex again.
“You are right, Malfoy, I’m not his keeper. But so help me, if you dare break Harry’s heart, or do anything to hurt him, I’ll make sure you regret every minute of your miserable life.”
He tries to see his chest from Potter’s point of view. His normally flat chest is puffy and swollen, just enough that they shake a little when moved. He knows they’d be warm to touch.
And Potter…he gives in. He thought he’d have to come up with drastic measures, but Potter closes his eyes and clenches his jaws. A muscle ticks before in true Gryffindor fashion, he looks into Draco’s eyes and proceeds to decimate Draco’s mind.
year all over again!”.
After a moment, Draco releases a shaky breath and vaguely manages to maneuver them over to the couch he Transfigured earlier.
His body seems to have the same idea, because not only is the thought of Potter keeping him up at night, but his chest has been feeling particularly tender as of late. He feels that he can hardly move without him leaking a little milk. Hes taken to wearing a support -he refuses to call it a binder or Merlin forbid, a brassiere -clothe around his chest that keeps him dry, and stops the flesh from moving too much.
, should have been a boon. A blessing. He can sit back, and relax, allow himself to enjoy being in love and being loved in return.
“Yes!” Potter shocks them both with his enthusiasm. Draco lets out a chuckle as Potter ducks head. The raven-haired boy visibly rallies himself, and speaks, “Yes, I want to do it again. But not just for -um- feeding. I also want a fresh start. We can also try to be friends?” Potter has such a hopeful expression on his face that Draco is tempted to tease him. He forces himself to behave. Well, not too much.
He wants to protest, and plead his case -- he knows if he leaves, nothing will be the same -- but Harry’s eyes are dull, teeth sunk into his chapped lips and Draco should stop. Just stop hurting someone he claims to love.
But every relationship involves taking and giving, and when it comes to Potter, Draco always had problems taking what he dishes out.
Draco has been steadily advancing with each sentence out of his mouth. The sheer anger he feels,  let’s him forget anything he saw in Potter’s eyes. Its only when Potter grabs his raised fist in a warm calloused hand does he realize how close he’s gotten to the other boy.
“Potter, you will tell me what is going on, or so help me-”. He really has no leverage on Potter, and if the latter chooses to leave he can’t very well stop him.  But he threatens nonetheless. “It’s the least you can do. “ He says quietly.
And he’s sorry, Harry, please. His feelings changed, now he thinks its real and --
He was already in love way before that unremarkable day.
Draco can't speak, so he nods. He shuffles over until he's close enough to climb into the couch and straddle Potter.
back to its source.
Why? Its because Harry is perfect and good, and kind, and everything Draco is not. What right does someone like him have, to go after someone like Harry?
He’s mother is still laughing, resplendent in soft orchid robes -- she hasn’t worn any colours in what feels like forever -- and it’s a shock but not as much as Harry. Harry who’s leaning forward in his chair, waving his hands about as he regales his mother with a story.
Draco is a little drunk, courtesy of a Gryffindor -- with the occasional Slytherin in the mix -- get together, and as such had over indulged a smidgen , if only to curb his tongue anytime he wanted to say something overly sarcastic.
He’s in love with Harry.
It’s only as Harry grabs his hand, and soothes him, telling him that everything is alright, does Draco finally man up, and the truth starts spilling out. Harry at the very least, deserves the truth.
The kiss goes on and on and even longer until they’re both forced to separate, breathing hard.
Draco supposes that makes him a hypocrite as well. The mere thought of Potter has him flushing, and a searing heat suffusing his body.
Instead he finds Potter pacing a hole into the threadbare carpet of Grimmauld Place.
“What’s wrong Potter?” The boy shakes his head. “Nothing. It’s stupid.” Potter gulps, and tries to hide his flushed face.
The four-leafed clover he picked seemingly shivers in anxiety within his pocket.
Fuck, Draco’s an idiot. He should cancel. He should leave right now. In fact, he should stop pacing immediately because Potter has arrived and is now watching him warily.
And when he does, it’s with fingers pressed to his cheek.
“If it was someone else who asked you out, say Hermione, or Neville. Even Ron. Anyone of them could have raised your social standing, without the accompany messiness being with me did. If anyone else had asked…would you have said yes?”
“It is?” Potter is looking back at him now. Face open and trusting. He could crush Potter’s little heart with a few choice words.
Draco wraps them up and sends them off with Euripides his owl.
Kissing Potter into dazed silence is a much more satisfying solution than any witty repartee.
He feels strangely shy as he glances beneath his lashes at the Potter. He’s gratified to see that it’s not only him that feels off balance in the light of last night’s actions.
It's the most sensible position for this to work. There are others of course, they could lie down on their sides and have Potter suck at him. Or with him on his back with Potter on top of him. So many ways. But straddling Potter seems to be the only way he can feel in control of the situation.
“I-I’m not watching you because I think you’re up to something. I know you’re not. It’s something else. I’m sorry that I’m bothering you.”
, the worst-- that could ever happen to him.
Draco is confused. Potter never made sense, and he wonders why he ever thought otherwise. “ I don’t understand-”
“No! Yes. But,”
Anger, bitterness, resentment and -- quite possibly -- hurt, sets Draco’s heart pounding. He struggles not to let Granger see how her words have affected him. Instead, he presents the mask he’s perfected when confronted with disappointed fathers, Dark Lords and now apparently, Grangers. Blank and placid.
, pleading like this was hard. Draco is -- was -- prideful. And any other circumstances-- before Harry-- he would have cut his loss, gathered his pride like a shroud and walked away. But this is Harry. Even at Draco’s lowest moment’s, he knew a good thing when he saw one, and Harry was the best there is.
Potter gets a gleam in his eye when he coolly retaliates with insinuations about Draco needing all the sweets his mother sent, back in Hogwarts, to soothe the sting of loosing so frequently in Quidditch.
The have sex.
It’s entertaining taking the role of a tour guide with their hands laced together as they walk. Draco always had the flair for the dramatic and as such, exaggerates his gestures and speech until he has Potter laughing, sides in stitches.
It strikes Draco that they’ve not been this alone with each other since that unfortunate night in the girl’s bathroom.
They stare at each other. In any other situation, with a different set of people, it would have been hilarious. How did they both manage to survive a war, but when faced with their school-yard nemesis and they instantly regress into snot-nosed brats?
The blond has his fingers working on the tiny buttons of his uniform shirt when he hears a squeak of leather.
There’s a burning in the way Potter looks at him, a certain avarice and hunger that has goosebumps breaking out on Draco’s skin.
He settles gingerly in Potter's lap, and nearly over balances when Potter presses a lingering kiss beneath his left clavicle.
The letter signifying his acceptance to the healer program of St Mungo’s is a bitter slap to the face. The letter was the very embodiment of what he wanted. Or thought he wanted. Acceptance, prestige and a good name.
He says that House elves do prefer being given work as opposed to being unemployed, as it gives them a sense of accomplishment, and cites several books on the topic, rambling about the history of the elves and what not.
A terrible thought goes through Draco’s mind.
So Draco changes track and instead focuses on taking care of Potter, petting him and making soothing noises. He’s still hard, and so is Potter. But that takes a back seat to everything. Perhaps next time…
And his fidgeting was driving Draco spare, and he just wanted this over with.
Milk escapes Potter’s eager mouth, but the Gryffindor pulls off his nipple to chase the errant drops. His tongue is hot and wet at it catches the spill, sucking on the trail left of his Draco’s ribs, all the way back to it’s source.
Not unless he finds a way to get what he wants without showing his hand.
His hands have slid into Potter’s unruly hair that turns out to be not as coarse it looks. Draco uses his hold on Potter’s hair to guide him until he’s latching on even better, before curling one hand around the other boy’s neck and down his broad shoulders and back.
He doesn’t pause to wonder if everyone knowing was something to be desired.
He recognizes the opportunity that he's been offered, its the scope of it that he didn’t quite grasp.
He feels trembling hands slip up his waist, up his back and finally to his chest. They both look down when Potter’s hands finger the laces on the clothe he wears. The things come in different types, all catering to lactating Omegas, Betas and sometimes Alphas. Most of them have an abundance of ribbons and laces adorning them which Draco finds bothersome. The one he wears, is a cream coloured silk that covers half his chest and back and held up by thin straps. The front is secured by a crisscrossing pattern of ribbons, which Potter is slowly unraveling. Each time he loosens the garment, Potter’s breath gets harsher.
He’s still pondering how Potter functions, being such a martyr, when he sees Potter make a move to leave.
When Draco said yes to Potter asking him out, he imagined public dates and gala appearances. Meeting people from both of their worlds and such ilk.
In lieu of and answer, Draco floats the card depicting Merwyn the Malicious -- he’s been using it as a bookmark-- towards Potter, knowing that its one of the cards what the other wizard has been missing.
“It will be one galleon, please.”
Draco froze. He wasn’t the one who talked.
Next year’s panorama was not as bad as he expected in the first place. Budget cutting was inevitable, but if both this year’s and next year’s expenses reports were compared, there would be little significant differences between them. All crucial activities would be accomplished. Sure, there won’t be new uniforms for all current staff members, but there will be uniforms to all new employees. There won’t be free biscuits in breaks and meetings, but no one will have to go home with half their salary.
“I really didn’t want them to do it. I don’t even know how they get that picture!”
“I didn’t think I would find you here.” said Draco.
Draco stared at the old witch behind the counter. Her wrinkled face showing both a deep frown and an honest annoyance. She had already asked twice and was no willing to ask a third time. Not kindly, at least.
“You- you know tomorrow is the new year’s celebration and maybe it is too late already but, you know…” Harry was babbling nonsensically. “well, would you like to go with-”
I know I stuck at words but I’ll explain myself. But trust me, it wasn’t a joke!” Draco took a seat; Harry took a deeper breath. “I like you, ok? I never wanted to make this stupid raffle. I’ve intended to ask you out for months now, but I was afraid of reading something that was not there. When the raffle thing came up, Ron joked and said that if you liked me, maybe you would buy a ticket. It was a stupid idea but I needed some kind of clue. Something that would tell me that at least you were attracted to me somehow.”
Harry held Draco’s hands between his, tilting his body towards Draco.
“I don’t get it”
“So, you made the choice. Take good care of it”
“Well, yeah, I- I don’t have so many options.
“Could you please leave your games and be honest for a moment? I’m doing this because I don’t want my friend to get hurt. Your ticket’s number will be the one coming out of that box.”
“So, how’s work going?” Apparently, Harry was feeling quite chatty today. Draco loved it.
I have asked the old Francis and I can’t get him to talk straight.”  The old Francis, as the head auror put it, was Draco’s boss. “Mr. Malfoy, will I be able to get new training aurors for next year or not? I need a straight answer.”
“I gotta get going, guys.” said the brown-haired man as he waved goodbye. “Draco, tell Adam I say hello, I hope I meet him tomorrow.”
“His name is Adam, no you don’t know him, he left with November’s cut. Now, for the love of everything that is holly,
He felt childlike, wishing Harry had made it specifically for him. Draco took a bite to the homemade bread. It tasted like the sweetest delicacy.
“Mr. Potter is waiting outside; he requests seeing you.”
It was there, Draco knew. That was the exact moment where he was supposed to jump. He felt his blood warming and reddening his face, the shacking of his hands between Harry’s; who was getting closer and closer to him. He gulped.
“An excellent report, as always, Mr. Malfoy. But we know next year will be
Harry took the coat and
“Mr. Malfoy, this way please. Head Auror Richard is waiting for you in his office.”
help, I will grant you the honor of having one of my French sweets.” Harry raised his hand facing up and Draco put the little sweet on top of it.
Draco nodded without hesitation. “Yes, I won’t lose the ticket.”
, he loved teasing Harry Potter.
When coffee was ready, he put two cups on the table. One for Harry. One for him. They started to work in silence. The sound of quill against parchment filling as background music. As he sipped his coffee, Draco recalled Harry’s homemade bread. It would have been good to save some to enjoy it together.
He walked towards the lift.
“Of course, I know how to use it, Potter, I have one myself at home. I just need to figure out where to put the filter and ground coffee.”
Both wizards were looking at each other, there was some electric feeling between them, they were so close again. Draco felt dizzy looking directly into those wonderful eyes. A heartbeat went through. Two. Three. Draco’s pulse was beating inside his ears, he knew he had that stupid smile again. He just couldn’t help it!
Music was soft and cheerful, barely perceptible above the crowd’s whisper and the tableware’s clatter. Witches and wizards dressed in their finest robes, wearing their favorite makeup and their happiest smiles. The Common Salon, elegant and lustrous, looked nothing like the office it had been the day before. Full size windows had been placed on every wall, enchanted to show the nocturnal landscape of some cold foreign country. Candles and lanterns placed everywhere to bestow a beautiful, warm, golden-like light.
He passed next to the sculpture every day, but he had never done so with Harry by his side. It made the situation different. Suddenly, everything the war had put them through felt too real. Without planning, they stopped to face the horrible thing. A non-stablished form. A smooth surface. Its black color mirroring the warm orange from the lit lanterns. Some said the sculptor based his work upon the shape Harry’s spell took when killing Voldemort. To Draco, the sculpture always reminded him of the Fiendfire’s shape.
“I didn’t mean
“Well, it seems to me and all the Auror Department that the raffled has been intervened. The owner of the ticket which number is 998 has been disqualified. Once we know what and how it happed, we’ll inform you the details of the new raffle. Thank you so mu-”
What did Weasley mean with that?
“The winning ticket is one which number is nine hundred and ninety-” Draco couldn’t breathe. “-eight!” It had to be a dream; it couldn’t be true. “Nine hundred and ninety-eight! The winning ticket is nine hundred and ninety-eight!”
at it. He tried it on, it was a little bit too long at length and more than a little tight on the arms. Harry didn’t complain.
“I need that ticket. This
“Why did you buy it, Draco? Why did you kiss me on the battle?”
Draco said a polite answer, but after that, Harry didn’t move nor say anything for a while. He looked even more edgy than before.
“So, what are you doing down here?” Harry seemed confused. “You said you were meeting Weasley. But he already left and you are still here.”
“Here is a copy of the conclusions of this year’s expenses. On the last page I wrote next year’s recommendations. They have been approved by the ministry already.”
Draco, chin lifted, was on defensive mode, wondering how his little joke had managed to travel that far. And what did it had to do with Weasley, anyway?
Draco wasn’t a big fan of straight answers, he usually preferred to leave an open room in case of any mistake. If he answered Richard’s question it would definitely put him against his boss. On the other hand, he was already on bad terms with
“Malfoy!” a very recognizable voice called from behind. Justin run towards them. “You left your copies behind, Mr. Richard asked me to bring them back to you.” A startled Draco reached for the papers. For a moment, he was sure Harry was about to ask him to the ball. Next to him, the brunet was paperwhite.
“I could lend you a coat, you know?”
Draco heard someone whimper.
The lift reached his requested floor and doors opened, but Draco didn’t move. Once the doors closed, he selected his office’s floor. Suddenly he didn’t feel like seeing the minister.
He hesitated. He was two or three inches taller than the brunet, but Harry had muscles Draco didn’t. Maybe it wouldn’t fit him, maybe Harry didn’t even want it. He looked so vulnerable. Draco smirked, took one coat off and threw it at Harry’s head. The blonde cackled.
At 10 o’clock in the morning, his assistant knocked on his door and entered, ready to recite that day’s business pending.
“Theo was there, so Monroe.”
Ron Weasley was seated next to him, attempting to look indifferent, but failing completely. Draco didn’t say a word, trying to figure out if the redhead had addressed him, or some invisible being among them. He arched a brow when Weasley turned his head to see him.
Draco thought. Shacklebolt always memorized his speeches, that was one of the reason Draco respected the man. He was a great speaker. The minister started to speak to the crowd, the same calm rhythm he usually used. However, this time Draco detected some sorrow in his words.
“That report is sent on new year’s first week, not December’s last week. It has always been like that.”
been told it is elegant and luscious.” Harry nearly choked. “Who’s laughing now, ha?!” said the blond.
Draco took the papers Justin handed in and started to read them. He sighed. Time went by.
A peculiar silent remained after. Draco knew he was welcome to join his department’s colleagues, they made sure to let him know it a while ago. Draco actually went to a few of those Friday meetings along the years, but even though he tried, he never could get used to been around that much of bustling people. He kind of wish he could, sometimes he wanted some bustling in his life.
Silence embraced them. It was no secret the redhead and the blond couldn’t stand each other. Draco faced the door, feeling how the conversation drifted away. He got a little surprised when he noticed another poster at the bottom of the doors. It wasn’t there that morning. He released something between a laugh and a snort.
Draco saw two fully-grown-up men and one young witch left the room looking rather sorrowful. The head auror was known for having a bad temper. The blond stepped inside.
The crystal box started spinning. No one made a sound. Every witch and wizard who bought a ticket held their breath.
Two months after the meeting, coming along with the autumn winter, the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, wishing to throw his now budget-cut annual Halloween party, accomplished to collect enough money to not only paid his now small Halloween party but to create what they called the Helping Fund. It was a collected fund that would be given to those associations supported by the ministry which would see their budgets cut. Because of that little first fund, a small hospital could offer rehabilitation procedures a little longer. There was no need to say that Shacklebolt loved the idea, he even said he encouraged it and proclaimed an extra full paid vacation week to that department which get to earn more money before this year’s end. From that point, it all went down stairs to Draco.
It was 9:05 in the evening, Draco had spent five whole minutes staring at his watch. He was not going down. Not again.
“Pardon?”
Draco wanted that conversation to end. He didn’t need a remainder of his boring life.
Shacklebolt was a good minister, though sometimes he got a little crazy about deadlines. Draco always managed to send his papers on time, nevertheless a couple of those times Draco had to work until dawn at his office.
work. Now, he knew it was there where his current tortuous predicament had started, though in a completely different way.
Draco didn’t understand why he didn’t just make Weasley do it, if he was the one who dropped it in the first place. Weird gryffindors.
Draco had barely laid a foot on the Common Salon, when he heard Weasley’s voice.
“Please, come in.”
“I will come back.” it felt like a promise, and before he could say something back, he found himself alone.
