“Sounds to me like you’re jealous of your baby sister…” Rose teases him and Albus goes red and grumbles a “
they talk about on the flyers…” Scorpius looks borderline devastated, and Draco doesn’t know for sure what that says about
Draco looks around with genuine curiosity, taking in the modern setting of the room. It’s nothing extravagant, but still spacious and comfortable. While the children’s room looks over the garden, theirs has a better view of the city lights. The grey afternoon seems to have dissipated into a clearer night sky, though it’s still humid and there are no stars to be seen.
It takes him a second to understand what’s going on, but Harry is still smiling and it doesn’t look like he’s about to leave.
“No magic, remember? It’s an adventure.” Harry smiles, moving to sit down on the bed and kick off his shoes in a way that’s both inelegant and stupidly sexy.
“Tosser,” Draco scoffs fondly, shrugging off the button-down he’s finally gotten open and going for his trousers next.
as it causes him to buck forward; causes him to moan softly against Harry’s mouth and his cock to cry a dollop of precome inside his underwear.
Instinctively, Draco’s hips keep moving as his body wants more. Their legs tangle together in the most natural of ways as he shifts to lie on his other side, finally able to see Harry fully. And there he is, sans the lumpy jumper Draco is sure he’s gone to bed in, in only the worn trousers through which Draco can perfectly discern the contours of an erection. The sight makes his mouth
It was two years since Harry got divorced and exactly ten days since he and Draco got together when Hermione asked, and twelve days
“There you go,” Harry coaxes, and Draco feels himself unravel. He comes with a low cry, shutting his eyes as he spills over Harry’s fist, his cock and their laps.
“Mum was really excited to go see the Natural History Museum! She told me Dad lost it when he first saw all the dinosaurs because he thought the Muggles had made them up,” Rose giggled.
Instinctively, he runs the pad of his thumb over the underside of the wedding ring he’s never taken off.
The kids are all exhausted when they finally make their way back to the hotel. They insisted on going to the British Museum to get their tickets for the next day, just for the sake of taking the
“You were a right prick back then,” Harry smiles, shoves more chips in his mouth, and quickly looks around to see if any of the kids has heard him curse.
He also doesn’t want to question his place in Harry’s life — not when they’re about to undress in front of each other for the first time, and sleep in the same bed for the first time, and maybe do things that Draco hasn’t done with anyone since Astoria died.
it looks. Behind the lenses, Harry’s eyes look like a mottle of green and black; like bright irises and long eyelashes and some sort of
“Of course not! That would be silly.” Draco shakes his head and smiles, then, still not having looked directly at Harry. He’s pretty much afraid of what the children would read in his face if he did.
Harry looks at him for a couple of seconds, his eyebrows raised. It’s barely a moment, but it feels like it may be what ruins this all.
“I’ve only been with Astoria. I’m not sure you know that.” Draco purses his lips and fights the wave of embarrassment that is caused by the weight he has just given the fact, more than the situation itself. “I have
Charm over the window to clear out the condensation so he can look at the buildings and the traffic down below them.
Draco wakes up feeling excessively warm and takes a moment to figure which one of the Kneazles is lying right on top of him
Draco can feel the heat rise on his face and gets busy with his own clothes, peering at Harry from time to time and drinking in his form in shy sips.
When they fall asleep again, it is Draco’s arm that rests around Harry’s middle, Draco’s soft kisses to his nape.
press against him, either, Draco realises with a small thrill as he tries out the words in his mind.
“Stole the words right out of my mouth,” Harry tells him, and it’s cheesy and the perfect line at the same time.
“On three?” Harry jokes, putting his now-ironed clothes down on the bed and taking hold of the hem of the shirt he’s wearing.
Draco takes a special interest in the réchauds and is positively impressed by how effective they are in keeping all sorts of food warm. He knows Harry is watching him as he leans closer to peer into the hot water reservatories and manages to keep his expression neutral enough that it only elicits an amused chuckle from him.
Thanks to Astoria, Draco had the opportunity to invest money and what was left of any family influence into changing some of the worst, most bigoted laws the Wizarding World still kept from the inside, and that had earned him some unexpected friends — all of whom had been there by his side when, years later, he lost his wife to her family’s blood curse.
That is, at least until Harry James Potter runs his fingers through the mess they’ve both made all over his middle and
They are going to need a shower in the morning, and Draco honestly hopes that the water pressure will be the thing to impress him about their hotel room. This time, they remember to close the blinds — and also to text the children to meet them downstairs for breakfast at eight, so there won’t be any surprise knocks on their door.
Draco looks at him again, letting his eyes linger. Harry looks different than what he’s used to, but that doesn’t feel like a bad thing. He’s got his hair cut recently, and it’s shorter on the sides, though not enough to hide the sprinkle of grey at his temples. It suits him, Draco reckons, finally moving to remove his own coat.
to have that knowledge at all, in fact — but he has never realised that they would have left physical scars as well as the emotional ones. It’s nothing obnoxious, really. A faint round outline where Harry’s chest hair is sparse and the skin is a different texture.
“So you and Mr. Potter will share, Dad?” Scorpius asks, and the doubtful tone in his voice breaks Draco’s heart a little.
In a second that seems to take at least a thousand more, Albus’ eyes narrow as he slowly turns to look at his father — who’s now fixing the ends of the braids in Rose’s hair as they chat merrily about the paintings she wants to see the most today — and then back at Draco.
the spark they’ve been sharing for the past years as their friendship clearly changed and shifted and their feelings for one another began to show. It is that thrill of a new relationship that they are just starting to build — this time on a much more solid foundation than any relationship Draco had before.
deep down, knowing the whole thing was built without any magic and that some of the structures have been there for a hundred years, but Draco made his best effort to find the Gryffindor in him and brave through. It earned him some giggles from Rose and Scorpius, and a few concerned looks from Albus, which he was surprised by but appreciated immensely. Luckily enough, Harry decided they’d had enough Muggle transportation for a day and agreed to bend the rules of their Muggle adventure a little bit and use magic, Apparating them to the point closest to the hotel so they could walk the short distance over.
So, it was a little surprising to hear Draco being so vocal and sappy. It made Harry’s whole-body melt in love. Well, except for one “stiff” part. “Now, where were we?” He could hear the smirk on his lover face and was almost about to give up, when Draco wrapped his long fingers around his cock and squeezed, making him gasp. Draco chuckled pleased by his reaction, knowing well that Harry was almost at his limit. That little shit.
While he feared Potter might go easy on him, he proved wrong when he started to fuck his face with strong and fast thrusts, forcing his cock down his throat with little to no finesse. Draco released an involuntary whimper, his own cock throbbing in his hand. He knew it was going to hurt in the near future, but just the thought to feel Potter in his throat for the next few days was absolutely exhilarating.
“Potter, while I think it’s admirable how honourable you may also be in such a situation where I’m asking you to destroy my throat with your dick, I can assure you that you’re not going to hurt me. Yours isn’t the first big cock that I have had the pleasure to deepthroat and I always managed just fine. And as for your inexperience, there is no reason to be tense. It's not advanced alchemy, really.” Potter’s stiffness melted, a slow and kind smile ghosting his perfectly kissable lips. “All right, no need to brag and rub your sexual experience in my face. It’s not my fault people get scared of my dick.” “Now who’s bragging?” He asked with an arched brow. Potter laughed sheepish before cancelling the distance between them. The kiss was quick and a little unexpected. As they come, his lips were gone almost immediately, leaving behind only the tingling of his beard on Draco’s mouth. But he did not let the other escape so easily. Grabbing Potter behind his neck, he crushed their mouths in a real kiss. All tongue and teeth. Nothing innocent about it. He kissed meaning business. What he gave, he received back. And it did not come as a surprise that even Potter’s kisses were addicting like the most lustful of drugs. The man kissed with his whole body, with such an intensity to make him breathless.
The atmosphere at their table reminds him of the one between him and Harry from a few months ago, thick with something sweet and special, with every glance in Harry’s direction making him smile.
‘I was curious about sleeping with a woman and Harry was on board, so we talked to Jones, our Keeper, and she told us about this place… and then he wanted to try it with a bloke so–’ Draco remembered hearing and trying not to blush, to which his wife had held his hand and leaned against him on the sofa they were sat in, in a comforting gesture he didn’t know he needed at the time.
“I’ve heard you’ve slept with people in worse conditions,” Draco tries for a light tone, but regrets it as soon as the words leave his mouth.
“Hope magic can save my data, really, because it’s the seventh picture since we left this morning…” Albus grumbles.
“Gran just sent me another picture of Olivia… I can’t believe uncle George managed to make her mobile phone work in the Burrow—” Albus’ voice startles Draco out of his reminiscing.
In fact, he’s been seeing them for over twenty years, since Astoria joined Hermione’s class at the Wizarding Law department’s school and they struck up an unexpected friendship that got the Malfoys invited to dinner parties they never thought they would be welcome at.
,” Harry replies. He moves up his arm that’s been holding Draco’s middle, shifts and uses his large hand to gently tilt Draco’s chin towards him.
It makes him blush, to notice that his body has responded even before he could think of it, his hips undulating off their own accord as he sought Harry’s warmth. There are several layers of clothing between them, and no movement towards taking them off — which seems to take away from the pressure from last night and leaves only this electric, bright anticipation in its wake. Meanwhile, Harry is still breathing deeply behind him, and Draco wonders if he has fallen back asleep. He misses the kisses to his nape, even though Harry’s body has not stopped responding to his movements.
“That’s rich coming from the little shite who bought out the trolley witch in ‘91,” Draco teases him.
,” he shakes his head and Harry laughs. “But I did. Scorpius has been talking about this Museum trip for months in his letters... I’m glad he got to see it, even if Ronald and Hermione couldn't take them.”
He likes the way Harry doesn’t bother shaving every day, and the way there are specks of silver in his beard, as well. He likes that Harry wears the cologne Draco bought him as a Christmas present a few months ago, when they were still circling each other and the tension between them was dense and sweet, as if they both already knew where they would end up and there was no rush.
.” Draco twists his nose in something reminiscent of a sneer; something that means he’s got his guard up, and that has Harry stepping back.
people could be attracted to more than one gender at the age of twenty-three, but it was never something he had given too much thought to. Draco knew he was well-attracted to women by a young age, but desiring men was not something he was even allowed to consider in the context he was brought up in.
“Ron and Hermione had booked a room for the kids and one for themselves, so all they’ve got is a double bed,” Harry explains, and that much Draco has grasped already, thank you ever so.
“We’re all sharing, so I don’t see why that’d be so terrible,” Rose Granger-Weasley interjects, popping from behind Scorpius with a fizzy drink in her hands and Albus Potter right beside her.
Draco remembers floundering a bit at the mental image of a club where people went to pick up strangers
He also wasn’t sure of why she listened to all of his babbling and didn’t run away, but she stayed. She made them two strong cups of tea and they had the first open conversation they had ever had about their sexualities and what marriage meant to them. It was one more topic in the long list of things they had been taught in a small-minded, conservative way, and figuring it out together brought them closer. Even if they didn’t intend to explore things with other people, learning about each other’s curiosities fuelled their
They kiss again. Draco retreats to the en-suite for his nightly routine and is surprised when Harry pops by behind him with a toiletries bag that’s even fuller than his own. Leaning against the door, he watches as Harry bloody Potter applies several Muggle skin care products he’s never heard of, and tries to learn a thing or two.
“That’s not news,” Draco jokes, a tad bit self-deprecatingly, adding a tiny smile to his expression for effect.
“That’s a lot of built-in furniture,” he observes once they’ve swiped their key card (!) and made their way inside.
“It doesn’t bother me that you’ve done things. I—” he exhales, and the whole thing sounds juvenile in his head. He’s in his forties and he’s got a son; he’s been married, and widowed,
“Next time,” Harry tells him, matter-of-factly. “I’m sucking you off. And then you can do it right in my mouth.”
Once they are all there, Harry and Draco check if the children have everything they need, from bath towels to pillows to the recommendation that they do not empty the mini bar.
Draco can hear the snicker in his voice, though he remembers the occasion was nothing to laugh about. Albus got very ill at the time, and Harry suspected something more serious.
, by the way,” Harry continues, gently kissing Draco on the cheek, and then moving to the other. “I don’t mind taking things slow, not at all. We’ve waited for things to feel right all around.” Harry moves to his jaw, then, to the shell of his ear. “And I’m not in any rush, Draco. We’ve got no reason to be.”
“‘S that alright?” Harry asks him in a sleep-heavy tone, and Draco can feel the smile in his voice when Harry presses a soft kiss to the back of his neck.
“Hagrid bought me a burger the first time I went to Diagon Alley,” Harry tells Draco with his mouth half full of chips. It’s disgusting and endearing.
“Was that another one of your nicknames for me? That’s rather long, isn’t it? Doesn’t roll off your tongue that easily,” Harry responds and they make their way to the room they’ve got.
‘It’s gonna be good for the kids to see you together,’ she winked, and Draco thought he would die a little.
“Let’s go leave our bags in the room, then.” Harry beams at him and the kids all engage in more excited chatter.
Harry knew that if every Auror in the country had been pulled into the Ministry and asked to come in early that something was going on, something massive. He half expected it to already be on the front page of the Daily Prophet, along with Skeeters name and her unique flair for destroying everything that could be useful. Rita had an infamous following in Slytherin as the woman somehow managed to get a lot of the important secrets from many pure-blooded witches and wizards.
Draco sat down on the empty sofa, ignoring Crabbe and Goyle for the moment. “Harry,” he said softly, “maybe one day you’ll let me work with you on one of your projects, whether it be a spell or a potion.”
“A single ticket for an adult was fifteen Galleons,” said James, his nose screwed up slightly. “Two tickets would be twenty-seven Galleons, three would be thirty-nine Galleons, four would be fifty Galleons. It got cheaper the more you purchased, due to the fact that it would benefit those with larger families.”
?” asked Harry as he watched the snake slither around in a circle on the dirt, which looked rather warm.
“They do not really have names as they deem it pointless,” said Atieno. “Humans and creatures that are humanoid in nature and seem to be the only species that names themselves. Serpents began to adopt names when Parselmouths gave them names and were able to communicate that to them.”
“Please, Harry, don’t use big words,” muttered Lily, ignoring the knowing look on her son’s face. “I love that you’re intelligent and that you know these words, but the rest of us don’t.”
“Be quiet for a second,” said Pansy. “You summoned each individual glass shard and then repaired the vase mid-air, while it was flying at you. What in bloody hell where you thinking and why can you do that? If anyone saw you do that, they’d be impressed instantly. I know I am.”
“You are under the impression that Pettigrew is a pure-blood himself,” said Professor Snape, his dark eyes filling with slight amusement. “Pettigrew cares not if you are light or dark, pure-blooded or a Muggle-born, or whether you are fat or thin. Pettigrew is attempting to seek out and kill Neville Longbottom, who is, as you should know, a pure-blood.”
Before Percy could reply a frantic appeared, her red hair flicking wildly with the loud crack that filled the room as she landed just near the front door.
“Shush,” said Vasily, smiling. “Come on, I’ll introduce you to everyone. Feel free to sit wherever you want.”
Draco gets distracted for a second as he looks Scorpius over, reaching out to fix his hair out of habit, earning himself a “That’s fine, dad!” and a laugh before he runs off to get himself some food.
Gathering up some more of the courage he used in the underground, Draco circles the bed with a small, shy laugh and broad steps. He’s met with a smile and Harry’s reach for him. With a deep exhale, Draco wills his shoulders to relax, rolling them back before Harry can get his arms around his neck.
He doesn’t remember feeling this way in a long time — having small shivers run up his spine just from feeling someone else’s body against his. He’s never had anyone’s
When they kiss, it feels like a natural progression of their last movement; like closing the distance between them and touching Harry’s lips with his own is just the way of the universe, the way it’s all supposed to be. It’s soft and soothing, and it helps drain the tension from Draco’s body, to which Harry’s hands respond by tangling in his hair.
And, to his surprise, the dinner parties had remained. As it turned out, Ronald Weasley had a great taste for wine —
, Draco thinks, and snuggles closer. He lets out a soft sound in agreement, too, just for good measure. After all, Harry feels warm and solid behind him; his body engulfing Draco’s in safety and the faint smell of woodsy cologne.
for some mysterious reason, with the sounds of way too many people walking and chatting about. There are children giggling, a baby crying, someone who is probably an employee looking for
“I’m sure you can transfigure something…” the youngest Potter says, and Draco isn’t too pleased about that arched eyebrow he sees. People may say he’s the spitting image of his father, but that’s a Ginevra expression, if Draco has ever seen one.
Harry laughs softly at that, but doesn’t comment on how Draco’s using magic again. Instead, he holds his own pyjamas out for Draco to Charm them, even though Draco is pretty sure that they wouldn’t hold up against too strong of a spell, since Harry’s sleeping clothes consist of a decrepit pair of flannel trousers, a threadbare vest and a bumpy woolen jumper with an H on it.
He and Harry have also talked about more private things, but not as often. They have talked about his childhood, but not much — ‘My mind healer says depression is clinging to the past, so I’m trying to get over that’, Harry explained and Draco did not pry further —  and about the people in their lives. They talked about how lonely Draco was five years ago when Astoria passed and he lost his love and best friend, and they talked about how betrayed Harry felt when Ginevra asked him for a divorce, even though it had been coming for some time. ‘We just weren’t in love anymore, even though we loved each other. How sad is that?’ Harry cried to him and wrapped his arms around his shoulders, and Draco felt a wave of warm, confusing feelings surge inside himself. He remembers it to this day, breathing in Harry’s cologne and
“Is that why you won’t use transfiguration on the furniture?” Draco turns to look at him, then, reciprocating Harry’s amused expression.
. They’ve been on two official dates at stuffy restaurants and there’s been one snogging session after they ditched the third posh place for a trip to the little greasy-smelling joint near Harry’s cottage and ended up walking home. Kissing by the front door like teenagers before he made up an excuse and Apparated home hardly counted as intimacy, Draco told himself at that point, and wondered when (and
“I told Hermione your wee Pureblood arse wasn’t ready for the bright electric lights and the loud noises,” Harry laughs and just like that there’s a weight off Draco’s shoulders.
“Changing is fine. I’ll do it as well.” He clears his throat. “And you can look, if you’d like,” Draco adds, feeling the harshness in his own expression melt away as he relaxes.
Draco breathes out again. “She did. And then I had Scorpius to think of, and I didn’t have any room in my life for someone else because I had to be there for him.”
‘Is there something you want to talk about?’ Astoria asked him that night when they came home, and Draco wasn’t sure of why he’d ended up intoxicated and crying in her lap, of all things, while telling her he loved her and that he would never leave her and that they were happy and he didn’t want to go to any
people in the past, and I have— we have— uh,” he lets out a shaky breath and braces on. “I was taught to wait until marriage and I did. We had the child we both wanted so dearly and then—”
“Now that’s not cryptic at all,” Harry teases, stepping closer to him. He’s already removed his coat and scarf, leaving his neck bare for Draco to see.
has got him this hot and bothered and he doesn’t make an effort to. He doesn’t have to think of any of that right now; just the fact that Harry’s hand has slid down, and the way it has found its way onto his arse, holding onto the flesh and squeezing it merrily.
As Draco lowers himself to remove his socks, he thinks about how the years of being home with the kids are also there — in the softness of Harry’s belly and the smile lines around his eyes.
“You’re gorgeous,” he whispers, almost as if thinking out loud, and Harry has the audacity to blush.
All of his nerve ends feel alive, and the sensation is right on the perfect spot between sultry and overwhelming. And so he sucks on Harry’s tongue ever so gently, and caresses it with his own and basks on the sound that Harry makes — breathless and broken. Harry squeezes his arse cheek and kneads it in his hand and pulls Draco against him, and Draco is pretty sure he may melt.
Instead, he groans. He squeezes his eyes shut, tilts his head back and takes it as Harry sucks a bruise onto his neck. Draco doesn’t think of another world where he would have walked through the halls in Hogwarts sporting that love bite as a trophy because that world will never be as good as this one, that they inhabit together.
This time, he’s the one to draw Harry close. Draco fits their bodies together and gasps out loud when their hips align.
Draco smiles at him and tries to decide what to do with the tightness he feels in his core, the pulse of his building arousal thrumming in his ears. For a second, he can feel himself get closer to that mindspace of panic as doubt threatens to arrive for good, but Harry’s quicker.
That and hearing about the wild things that the Potters got up to on a regular basis at their frequent dinner parties — with Ronald constantly leaving the room to get them one thing or another because
“It’s not about the money, Al, it's about us not having to rush you to St. Mungo’s in the middle of the night to get your stomach pumped because you ate too many sweets
With a small sigh, then, Draco lets his eyes fall shut once more and shifts closer to Harry, melting into his embrace. Feeling bold, he slides one leg over Harry’s, inviting him to fit his thigh between Draco’s. And
He can’t tell if Harry looks hurt or angry, and suddenly the foggy glasses feel like a terrible nuisance. Gently, Draco reaches to take them off, using the little wandless magic he can perform to send them floating over to the bedside table behind them. It works as a distraction, as a way for him to gather his words and make sure he doesn’t say anything dumb again.
Rose’s voice coming from somewhere behind him startles Draco, who almost spills his tea all over himself. Harry, the bastard, laughs.
Skilfully, Harry wiggles enough to get his trousers down, working on Draco’s next, just enough to get his erection free. With one murmured Spell, his palm is full of warm, slippery liquid and Draco barely has the time to process it before Harry’s got his hand around them both and
and all but trapping him in place. It has happened before — they are heavier than they look, and entitled enough to think it is their right to use Draco as a self-heating pillow whose only purpose is to serve them — and so he goes instinctively for the proven method of wiggling and turning. Except, when he wiggles, there’s an
he remembers slurring in a terrible stage whisper to Astoria one night, as everyone laughed heartily — and Hermione Granger was witty and sharp and ruthless, and Ginevra had stories to tell about Quidditch and– well. About hers and Potter’s
“It turned out well for the kids, and we get to spend the weekend together.” Harry nods, and Draco finally realises how silly of a scene they must make, speaking from opposite sides of a hotel bed for no reason at all.
“I love the way it feels deep down my throat, while you fuck my mouth like you own it… I know you like to see my pretty lips stretched around your ridiculous girth, the tears in my eyes as I try to accommodate all of you… When I choke on your huge cock, you dirty bastard…” Well, when he put it like that, Harry could not disagree. He did love to have Draco on his knees for him, sucking his dick like it was the most delectable food on earth. He still remembered the expression of shock and lust the first time Draco saw him naked. The way his lover had licked his lips and his eyes had darkened with desire, worked wonders for his ego.
Draco closed the door behind him absentmindedly, eyes wandering around the room and ultimately fixing on him. “Harry… How…Where did you… I am…” Seeing his boyfriend so at loss of words made him chuckle, which helped to lose some of tension from his shoulder and steady his heartbeat.
He was trying to picture the man’s dick in his mind, when Potter called his name, giving him almost a heart attack.
“That’s not what I meant. I was just afraid mother did not give her blessing. That’s all.” “Oh. She did. She kissed me.” He blubbered incoherently, to which Draco chuckled and he felt his cheeks get hot. He was making a fool of himself. “I hope not on the lips.” “No, on the cheeks.” Draco hummed. “Good. I’m the only one who can kiss you. Those lips are officially mine now. Forever.” He turned his gaze to the rings and stared for a few second in complete silence. They two jewels were a pair, a yellow gold band studded with emeralds and a platinum band covered with rubies. They were thin and elegant, and Harry thought they were the perfect union of the two of them. They would thus wear both the respective colour of their own house and of the other.
“I love you too, sap.” “But I’m your sap.” Chuckled Harry and Draco felt his already wide smile becoming even more warm, his heart swelling as a balloon ready to explode in a rain of glitter. “Yes, you are.”
“You lucky I love it too.” And just like that, he wrapped his lips around his cock, pushing down the foreskin to reveal the throbbing head. Surprisingly not, Draco played with his gland, tongue teasing his little cleft, making him grit his teeth in a desperate attempt to maintain control over his body.
“I love how good you are with Teddy. You’re a great role model for him and I’m so happy the three of us are able to spend time together. I love how much commitment you put into redeem yourself from your past mistakes. You apologized but never asked for forgiveness and it was one of the most noble gesture I ever witnessed. I love how you submit yourself to Weasley’s lunches and dinners even if sometimes they can be a little bit too much, just because it makes me happy. I love how kind you are, even if you’re always trying to hide it, and how caring you are of the people you love. I love how jealous you are, even if it makes us fight in vain, but the makeup sex it’s always mind-blowing, so it’s more than worth it. I love how possessive you are. It makes me feel wanted and desired, something I did not really experienced before you. This might sound cruel, but I also love how lonely you get when I go away on a mission for a couple of days. It makes me happy because it’s the same way I feel when I don’t see you even for one day…” As tears would not cease to fall, Draco bit his trembling lip, clearly trying to keep his emotions under control. Those tears showed him how much Draco was affected by his words, how much he loved him. Ignoring the knot forming in his throat, he went on.
“That colour is an eyesore… that gorgeous body of yours doesn’t deserve such slander.” Something flicked over Potter’s face, it almost looked like shyness, a light blush over his face. How someone could be so hot and adorable, confident yet shy, at the same time was a true mystery, as well as charming.
They kissed each other with scorching passion, his hips moving on their own accord, grinding his cock on his lover’s. In a desperate moment of clarity of mind, he cast a wandless and wordless lube charm over their pricks. It was not perfect, the lube was a little cold and too much, but he did not care. Patience had never been his strong suit. The friction became more smooth and pleasurable, and a relived growl escaped from his wet lips.
“I love how masculine your chest is. I know you’re a little insecure about how hairy you are, but you should know by now how much it turns me on. I love the feeling of our chests pressed together. My skin will burn for a little while after and it drives me crazy…” Draco sucked on his nipple and Harry almost groaned in frustration, because it was not enough. His dick was fully hard, laying on his stomach enquiring attention. “But I also love it because it’s the home of your heart. I’ve never met a man or a woman with a kinder heart than yours… It’s compassionate and forgiving…” The fact that Draco was managing to arouse and making him emotional at the same time was simply maddening. Harry was crossed between fuck him into the mattress and get on one knee and ask him to marry him. Luckily, he was ready for both.
“All right, but you still need to let me go.” “And why is that?” Merlin, he was so unnecessarily cute. It made his heart swell to size bigger. “So I can kiss you, love.” Draco let go and moved away. Their eyes met and he could see tenderness into those two lakes of silver. He cupped a cheek with his hand, stroking gently the skin with his thump. He kissed him slowly and adoringly. No lust left, only the crushing feeling of love inside his chest, burning like the sun. They brushed their lips languidly for what it felt like hours but were only few seconds. One of the many effect Draco had on him.
Sitting with his knees spread, he took out his fingers and put his hands under Draco’s thighs, lifting him and positioning his legs around his waist. He lined up his already lubricated cock and pushed gently the head over the ring of muscles. They both gasped and then moaned loudly in harmony.
He sighed tiredly, shifting his gaze to his bed, where his costume for the ball was laid ready to wear.  That fucking ball. He clenched his hands in two iron fists, pressing his nails into the skin until it hurt. If only he had kept his mouth shut. If only he had thought and asked before acting, they would be together now. Cuddling in front of the fire, drinking some wine and eating some food stolen from the kitchen. Instead, he was alone, in his lonely cold room, wondering where Harry was and if his mistake had cost him the most beautiful thing he had ever had in his life.
The door unlocked and his heart skipped a beat. He swallowed heavily, his mouth dry, and took a last deep breath. It was showtime.
Looking back, Draco should have known that the “Golden Boy” would have been nothing but trouble. After the war, Draco had the time to finally explore the complexity of his own mind and feelings, coming to the conclusion that he liked men and probably had had a crush on the Saviour of the Wizarding World for quite a while. Simply tragic in his modest opinion. So, when he found himself in front of the new charismatic and objectively hot Harry Potter, with long hair and a sexy beard, he knew his weak gay heart would have betrayed him.
“I’m going deeper, now.” Announced Potter after a while, voice strained with pleasure. Right on cue, his dick hit the back of his throat and went a little deeper. The action sent shivers down his spine and straight to his dick, which he finally touched with relief, jerking off at the same rhythm of Potter’s thrusts. Little by little, Draco found himself swallowing all of him once again, nose in his pubes, throat tightening around his girth.
The pale green of the hills mixed with the autumn colours of the threes. Little cottages were scattered around, in what seemed to be a casual pattern. The only sounds he could hear were the wind and the little breaths of Harry. It was quiet and relaxing. Only at that moment, he realized how much he needed to escape from the commotion of the city. The sound of nature was a relief for his stressed nerves. That, and the gratifying cuddles.
“How does it look?” Asked Harry, voice rough and deep with hunger. It sent shivers long all his body. “Magnificent.” He answered honestly, pleased to see how his praise made the man blush. Draco felt his own dick throbbing between his legs. The way his boyfriend could be so adorable and hot at the same time was a real crime. “You flatter me, but I would lie if I said I didn’t like your compliment. Cause I do, a lot.”
“Your legs are strong and have the honor to carry around that perfect tight and sculpted ass of yours…“ He kissed his thighs, tongue teasing lightly and setting his skin on fire. He really wanted that devious mouth on his cock. “I’m fond of them, because they always bring you back to me. No matter how far you go, or for how long. I know as long as you can stand, they will take you home…” Harry was not sure, since he could not see Draco, but he almost had the impression that his lover was getting emotional with his own words. His heart was beating so fast for so many reasons. One, his dick was rock hard, and he knew it was the last thing left on his body worthy of praise. Second, Draco always managed to surprise him. Draco was a little clumsy to show his emotion when he felt vulnerable. He struggled a little when he had to say the three words that were so easy for Harry. He preferred to show it with small gestures of affection. Bringing him a perfectly prepared cup of tea and something to eat in his office when he was too immersed in his work to even notice how hungry he was. Saying welcome back if he was the first to get off work and welcome Harry home, or announcing that he was back when he was late. Every time he apologized first when they argued. Every time Draco got on his flying motorbike, even if he was terrified of flying on it. Every time he saved him from the horde of journalists, who could not conceive the simple concept of personal space, using sharp words like razors, leaving the paparazzi speechless and Harry amused and a little turned on.
The numerous round tables were covered with heavy black velvet tablecloths, while cutlery, plates and glasses were bold purple. The chairs were in black brocade, with a tone-on-tone pattern. As table centrepieces, huge antique vases were designed in purple, filled with black roses and black lilies covered with cobwebs. At the foot of the composition, an assortment of pumpkins with disturbing bloody smiles. Heavy deep purple brocade curtains framed the windows on the two walls, being the last touch of decoration to the Great Hall.
Even with his eyes closed, Harry could feel the weight of Draco’s gaze on him, and he knew it was full of adoration and lust. “Harry… You’re so gorgeous. I will never get tired of soaking in the sight of your body…” Draco was talking like he had honey in his throat. His voice as soft and teasing as a silk scarf brushed over his hot skin. He loved being drowned in Draco’s praises, as Draco did. It was a shared kink of them, probably caused by the lack of parental approval in their youth, if he had to have a wild guess.
“What are you trying to say?” The man lowered his hands and gave him an exasperated, but fond look. “What I’m trying to say is, you’re not the only one who made the mistake of trying to cheer up Harry during this period of the year or try and make him forget, for a couple of hours, the death of his parents. We didn’t know better. We assumed, in our naivety, it was what he needed. But it wasn’t. He got angry with us, said some regretful words and then came back to apologize for it the day after. Now we know better. He likes to spend the day remembering and not forgetting. Usually, he goes to anybody who had known his parents and asks them to tell him anything they remember about them, even the most insignificant of the particulars. That’s what he craves and needs.” Draco felt his eyes burning but kept the tears under control. Crying in front of him would have been simply humiliating. “He could have just told me so. I would have understood. Even if I’m a, and I quote, an
“I must confess, I was rather disappointed when I woke up all alone in a cold bed.” He could feel the smile on Harry’s lip even without seeing it. “I’m sorry, love. I thought to surprise you and bring you breakfast in bed, but you beat me.” Draco watched over his lover’s shoulder and saw the wooden tray filled with a plate full of vanilla pancakes with chocolate and blueberries and two cups of coffee.
He reached for his wand on the bedside table and cast a Tempus charm. It was one in the afternoon and his stomach grumbled to remind him it was time for lunch. He slowly got up, a yawn escaping from his mouth as he summoned a pair of slippers. He opened the heavy velvet curtains and the light of the sun hit him right into his face. He grunted in displeasure. Merlin, he really hated night shifts. He hated going to work at ten in the night and returning around seven in the morning. He hated sleep during the day, recovering from the night of work, and he hated sleeping alone. And, on a vainer note, it was not healthy for the skin. He had lovely skin and he would have liked to maintain that, thank you very much.
He tightened the belt of his ice-blue silk nightgown, as he kneeled in front of Harry, who watched with a predatory glint in his eyes every movement. Placing his hands on his knees, he made him open wide. Eyes locked together. Without a word, Harry opened his bathrobe. Draco drunk in the glorious view of the man, all beautiful light dark skin covering the strong muscles of his chest, abs and legs. Dark hair obscured his broad torso and a tantalizing happy trail led to his low abdomen, where, between bushy and wild curls, rested his cock. That stunning thick and long cock that drove him crazy like anything else. Seven inches soft and nine hard, no matter its state, it was always, in a single word, impressive. Such artwork deserved a better frame, something more prime and polished, to emphasize its beauty.
He really wanted, but he should have not, or that night he would have not slept a wink. But before he could do that, he fell back into the arms of Morpheus, Harry's only rival. The second time he woke up it was accidental. He looked around the room confused. The fire was still burning, bathing the room in warm light, but now sunlight could be glimpsed behind the curtains, hitting the floor. How long did he sleep? Did he dream about Harry waking him up or did that really happen?
“Fuck, you’re so big… You’re stretching me so good, filling me entirely up… I can never get enough of your massive cock…” Between the praise, washing over him like a hot pour of desire, and the actual carnal sensation, Harry felt dizzy, his blood boiling inside his veins. The way Draco was biting his plump lip was maddening. He slammed right into him, all way to the base, making Draco scream.  “Sorry, sorry… Did I hurt you?” Frenetically asked Harry, coming to his senses, heart hammering in his chest. “No, no… Fuck me, please, Harry… I need you to fuck me hard and fast…” Reassured by his lover, he was more than happy to comply. He gave a few slow thrusts, giving Draco the time to adjust to his size and find that perfect angle to hit his bundle of nerves that would make him shake and scream like a banshee.
Taking a deep breath through his nose, he dived in, taking all of Potter’s huge cock, his nose finally touching his pubes, Potter’s scent was so strong that it hit him like a punch in the gut. A jolt of pleasure shook his whole body, which ended right on the tip of his cock, precum oozing onto the floor. “Holy shit!” Exclaimed Potter, hand coming to held Draco’s head, finger slipping in his hair in a surprisingly gentle touch. Draco’s eyes burned with tears as he struggled to keep Potter’s deep down in his throat, little gagging sounds escaping against his will.
“I almost forgot about your most valuable asset… How deplorable of me.” He kissed all his length with feather like kisses, while with his free hand played nonchalantly with his pubes. Harry’s body trembled under his touch and had to concentrate all his willpower to not take over.
Dumbledore just smiled and turned back to James and Lily, ignoring Harry for now. He had informed the boy plenty of times to lodge a complaint if he so desired. “It’s good to finally see you out and about, James. I haven’t seen you in a while,” he said, smiling. “Be sure that you don’t turn into another Cornelius Fudge and neglect your family, now. That, of all things, would be such a shame to see.”
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” smiled Dumbledore and chuckled slightly before correcting himself. “You may ask me one more thing, however.”
While the playing was back in action Lee began to commentate again. “Slytherin in possession – Flint with the Quaffle – passes Spinnet – passes Bell – hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose – I’m only joking, professor – Slytherin score.”
“And then it all clicked in place?” said Harry, leaning forward. “Your tolerance for pain is amazing. The very first throb of it was enough to make me annoyed at the level of pain.”
The man smiled and nodded slightly. “Many people fear the unknown, child, whether it’s death and comes after, Gods, or anything that cannot be explained by their pitiful minds. Many fear immortality as it can upset the balance. People tend to think that fate exists and that it’s a living person that stalks through the world, hoping to find anyone ruining her plans – stupidity at its finest. Legends say that Death himself was once a wizard who sought immortality, and succeeded, but was cursed into being alive, but dead at the same time – death, in all aspects.”
“She put ideas in your head, Draco,” said Harry. “She made you doubt yourself and then you tripped and instantly thought she was correct. None of her predictions have been complex. I could do the same thing right now.”
Harry couldn’t help but snort as he got up and tucked the book back in his trunk. He had barely gotten through the introductory section when the clock revealed that it was almost eleven o’clock at night. He was somewhat confused on where the time went as dinner had felt like it was ten minutes ago.
“I can move mountains,” said the Master Mutilator. “I can lift trees with a look, create craters in the blink of an eye, and I could easily level a city by the time you lift your wand. Do you desire to test me?”
“Alas, it is the Malfoy way, but we all know you’re as much of a Malfoy as I am,” said Nicolas with a knowing glint in his eyes. “Now, tell Mr. Potter that I’ll be here every day, I love a good ice-cream, of course, I’m sure he already knows about this.”
“But you’re not a normal wizard, are you?” said the man, grinning. “I do wonder what you call me in your head. Do you just call me ‘the man’ or define me by the colour of my eyes? You seem to have forgotten manners and not asked me for my name.”
“I have been reading about Harry Potter and what happened with him, I have found nothing on why he detached his soul and sent it to me, or how it even found me, was it a coincidence or intentional? The only thing I have found was that it was a rare ancient piece of magic, something a mere fourteen year old boy shouldn’t be able to do. It was made for duels for magic, with only a select few people being able to do it they become powerful and the magic consumed them, no one since has done it, it slowly drains magic, it pinches at the magic of enemies no matter how close they are and slowly removes
“Let’s get you to your bed,” Snape picked Harry up and walked towards the Gryffindor tower, he ignored the looks from the students, and he got to the Fat Lady and frowned.
“All myths,” said Salazar with a disinterred tone. “She gave herself to me willingly when she realised that her snakes did nothing against me. My mother was part Gorgon, I will have you know. My affinity with snakes did not come from nowhere.”
“Here,” said Professor Snape. “It’s from your mother. Take it and open it when you feel the time is right.”
“The more they know about you, the more time they have to spend mentally countering any action you may take.”
“Oh, really,” muttered Draco, grinning. “Maybe you’ve been skipping meals, then. Tell me, Harry, do your feet even touch the floor from the stool or do you need to hop off the stool to stand?”
A second-year girl, who had been staring at Terence Higgs, coughed. “I don’t understand why we have to attend the games of the other teams,” she said shyly. She avoided eye contact and stood a little straighter, hoping to sound more confident. “I mean, it didn’t happen last year, did it?”
He moved his mouth, his wrist easily slicing into a pattern, and promptly fell backwards, his vision going from blurry to pure black.
growl,” said Nott. “You’re really testing my patience, Potter. Your attempts to try and thwart my plans and usurp my position haven’t gone unnoticed.”
“In that case, perhaps we should return to my list,” demanded Lucius. He wasn’t going to waste any more time in this store than he had to. “I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today.”
Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signalling the start of afternoon classes.
“Well done, but appears as if it’s straight from a book, perhaps the one that you purchases recently?” said the man, smiling. “What do you know of Golpalott’s Third Law?”
“Lily is far better at this than I will ever be,” said James. “I did vow, though. Take a seat and sit down. We should have a chat about it. Talking helps. It’s what I do with new Aurors after their first time in the field.”
“Hey! I was gonna read that,” he said, gently yanking at the book with his fingers. “Bad, Draco! That’s very, very bad. Put it down.”
“– of course I wouldn’t mind being the Defence Against Dark Arts professor, I’d love to help future children grow into intelligent members of the wizarding society.”
“I will give you a fifty,” said Atieno, holding his hand upwards and shaking it a little. “You made some strong points, but you also fell behind with a few others. The Dark Arts are called that because they were used in the Dark Ages, which is not something most people are willing to talk about and it has been struck from history. Only an insipid moron would dare try and use the argument that any spell could be Dark Arts if you tried enough. They are not worth your time because they are spewing the same old nonsense that was used centuries ago by those who really wanted to be relevant but lacked any talent whatsoever.
.’ Draco couldn’t break his thoughts; he wanted to Kiss Harry, he really wanted to. He wanted to tell Harry how he felt and what happened before, but he wasn’t brave. Draco was sure Pansy would be screaming for Draco to kiss Harry. Draco should have by now, he was never this hesitant before, but now he is.
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED, STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” bellowed Peeves as loudly as he could. “STUDENTS OUT OF BED, THEY’RE DOWN IN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!”
Out stepped a handsome boy, which caused a sigh in the male populace of Hogwarts, who was wearing a pale blue uniform lined with gold trimming standing out like a broken wand. The boy said something, his voice soft and his light brown eyes going across the castle, which soon filled with surprise as he leant back into the carriage and then stepped away moments later, waiting.
“Right,” said Professor McGonagall with slightly narrowed eyes. “The feast is almost over, you two better return to your tables.”
“Bellatrix,” said Lord Voldemort, looking mildly annoyed. “Didn’t I tell you to remain at the front of the house?”
“Yes,” said Harry in cold tone of voice. The entire room went silent, not that there was any chatter before, but it was definitely silent now, all eyes turned towards Harry Potter, even Dudley’s eyes focused on him.
Harry studied the cage, his eyes narrowed. “They’re Cornish Pixies, not very dangerous, just a nuisance. Of course, their Ministry of Magic Classification is XXX, as such, competent wizards should cope with them,” he said in a flat tone. The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. “Dealing with groups of them can be difficult. They won’t really ever harm a human, they’ll just –”
“Yes,” said Harry simply. “This whole situation is just another child’s attempt at playing politician… another
“Hello, Potter, you look like you just climbed out of bed,” said Tracey with a smile. “You’re lucky you have short hair, if you were a girl you’d have to at least brush your hair.”
That was why it was no surprise that he currently had his head pushed between the pages of said book while everyone was socialising.
Harry tried his hardest not to smile, barely managing to succeed. He decided to study the group of snarky people as silently and as judgemental as possible. He needed to look like the silently broody type if he was going to make some sort of impression.
Lockhart stepped forward eagerly. “My office is nearest, headmaster – just upstairs – please feel free –”
“Jörmungandr is a sea serpent in Norse mythology. The serpent grew so large that he was able to surround the earth and grasp his own tail. As a result, he received the name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. When he lets go, the world will end,” explained Harry, just as he had back in Hogwarts to most of the Slytherin students. “That’s putting it simply.”
“Would you like to come in?” the man said, breaking the slight silence. “I can show you what the property has to offer.”
. No matter how he moved his head, looking at the white words from different angles, which was sure to make him look like a curious child, the words inside of the dark blue line always flipped so that he could read them. He saw them reverse when he looked at the floor in a mirror from a door.
The room paused for a moment, everyone leaned on the edges of their chairs and waited for the next spell to be cast. It was a dark purple spell cast by the boy which caused the girl to scream and dash to the side. The spell sailed between the gaps between her legs. The girl stood up and glared at the boy, furiously sending spell after spell at the boy. The sound of glass smashing and something that sounded like a gong echoed throughout the room.
“When your body is buried, your last desire… as long as it’s in reason is fulfilled!” Draco said sadly, “your last desire was essentially that you didn’t belong here and you wanted to leave. You will be forced out of Hogwarts as your dying desire will be fulfilled.” Draco went pale.
No one cheer or shouted as they did in the very first meeting that Theodore Nott had called. There was an exhausted aura resting over the group, especially from those in their third year. The sixth-year and seventh-year students had deemed the entire thing a waste of time and stopped attending the meetings.
He put his clothes in the hamper, making note that the hamper emptied almost instantly, which meant that the house-elves were already cleaning and preparing for the day, and muttered a quick greeting to Crabbe, who responded in kind. He bid farewell before the said boy could deafen him with his godawful singing. It was quite a humorous exchange, with a greeting being said and then mere seconds later, a farewell.
“Sounds useful, thanks,” said Susan, turning to look at Ginny Weasley. “Why do you actually suspect her?”
Harry really wasn’t sure on how he should respond to that seeing as he still failed a spell that Longbottom had successfully cast.
He easily followed behind the girl, making sure that he maintained an average speed, only going faster when he had to, mostly because Clara decided that they were going too slow and decided to push herself and the broom faster. He did not speak, which would not have worked as their words would go unheard due to the rushing sounds of the wind.
“Why do you still call him Harry?” muttered Ron hoarsely, emerging over the table top, looking pale and sweaty. “Potter called Hermione a mudblood, Hagrid.”
“Thank you,” said Harry, his face twitching a little as he tried not to sound too awkward. “I try to not come across as a know-it-all, despite the fact that most people are content on remaining ignorant on almost everything. I do know when to fold, and accept the defeat, or when to play my hand and reel in my winnings.”
“They didn’t even search you when you were abducted,” said Robin, pressing his forehead against the bars. “Perhaps because you offered your wand without resistance, they assumed you were clean… or, maybe, because your father already started a fuss and they didn’t want to annoy their boss. However, this
Harry was able to take down the ward with ease, as it hadn’t changed from what it was previously. The spell that he used wasn’t a ward-breaking spell, it was rather different, instead of temporarily allowed access, not destroying the ward at all. The spell was probably a dark spell, which hardly bothered him as he already learned that the bias against the dark arts was skewed in more ways than one.
Harry smiled, “alright then, everyone but Molly is to leave and not peak, go into the living area.” After they all left Harry sat next to Molly, “you’ve done so much for me, I cannot help but feel like I owe you the world, this house is your world and that means I want it to be perfect.”
“This is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the Tournament tasks are unknown and could be difficult and dangerous,” said Dumbledore. “Due to the nature of us not knowing what they are, we cannot determine whether they will be suitable for those below sixth and seventh year. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.
“Not very much,” said Harry with a facial expression that almost drew sadness in, as if he was upset about not knowing it. “It’s mentioned in Advanced Potion-Making, but it doesn’t explain anything about it.”
Harry looked down at the harmless looking black diary which belonged to Riddle, could it be T. M. Riddle? The same person who sent him the Dark Arts books? He debated it for a moment before he glanced up, ready to move from the room. All he needed was an opening.
“You didn’t actually have to be a piece to play the game, you could stand on the side and call out or simply be the king and concede before you would be taken and restart,” explained Harry. “He sacrificed himself for nothing.”
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. “Firenze!” thundered Bane. “What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”
“I asked if you needed anymore clothes,” she said when her son finally glanced up, a confused expression on his face. “I can pick you up some while you’re browsing in Gringotts.”
Harry hissed out a spell that sent Neville flying through the air. He watched as Neville rolled along the ground, his head hitting several places as he rolled and then came to a stop, his robes covered in dirt. “Now, what did you say to Draco a while ago, Weasley?”
“The Quidditch World Cup is the last major event to happen in the United Kingdom for most of our lifespans,” said Harry, leaning forwards with a slight frown. “That’s assuming everything goes right, too. However, from what Lucius told me, the tickets were gone in as little as three hours.”
Harry muttered something under his breath and leant back, and sighed. He toyed with the seat for a while before he lost himself in thought.
“Because it is the only book on Inferi in the United Kingdom that refers to them as Inferius when there is only one of them,” said Albus. “I know this, Mr Potter, because I wrote the book with an old friend of mine. I assume you did not look at the author.”
He could hardly fault any of them, though, knowing that most of them were only going to put their name into the Goblet for fame and prestigious to attempt to impress their friends and family. He knew well enough that no one that was currently hesitating desired to compete and they were praying something would come up that could make them not put their name in.
“Accusing me of making your friend cry isn’t being nice,” said Harry with a sneer. “Now, if you wouldn’t mind?”
“You ruined my hair didn’t you Potter,” Draco groaned and summoned a mirror, patting it down in places.
“Of course Minerva, I doubt the students wish to hear me talking solely, a fresh voice is always welcomed.”
“Our goal is to not harm or distress any children,” said the wizard with silver embellishments on his robes. “Our goal is to prove to the Ministry that everything they own can and will be touched. Our aim is to send a message… a message to the Aurors, the parents, to Dumbledore, a message to
“Seems as if my theory was correct, somehow Harry and the Dark Lord have a connection, the Dark Lord can influence Harry however he wants to, and because Harry is awful in Occlumency it wouldn’t take long for the Dark Lord to breach Harry.” Severus turned to leave, “as for you two, I assume it may be wise to tell Harry the truth, he doubts Draco’s love for him and most likely believes you’re trying to interfere with his and Draco’s non-existent relationship.” Severus said to both Draco and Blaise and walked out.
“It is rumoured that the phoenix will die when mankind does,” said Albus. “The Guardian of Death will also perish when there is nothing left to collect. However, it is all speculation and whether it exists or not could be debated for hours on end.”
“I don’t think Fudge expected them to sell so rapidly,” said James. “If you look at past attendance of the World Cup, it’s never been this attended by so many people, no matter how and when you look at it.”
“Well that’s fantastic!” said Gemma with a wide smile. “Not that I care for Quidditch, but you’re just the build for a Seeker, too. Light – speedy – we’ll have to get you out to tryouts as soon as they start, if you don’t make the team I’m sure Professor Snape won’t mind someone else using the broom.”
“Welcome, everyone, I’m sorry for the rather abrupt notice-” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled, he focused his eyes on Draco, “-but there’s plenty of things I would love to talk about.”
Harry, on instinct, flicked his hand out and caught the package before it could slam into the table and throw food and drinks everywhere. He watched the owl hoot and landed next to him, clearly wanting to steal his food. He gently stroked the owl’s slightly mismatched feathers and handed it a piece of bacon.
“Maybe she couldn’t come,” said Neville, frowning at how much sugar Ron put into his tea. “I wish she’d let me know, though. We can’t wait around much longer for her.”
Harry slowly placed his index finger against his closed eye. He could feel a headache coming on and he knew that he was far too young to be getting regular headaches at the petty arguments of other children. “Can you just go stand over there, Longbottom? Your mere presence is practically headache inducing.”
The four of them watched as the three-headed dog’s eyes, all six of them, began to droop. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased – it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“I guess they do see me as some kind of head figure,” said Asahi. “That comes with age, experience, and wisdom. I am simply their elder and they show me respect. I am not some hidden warrior that defeats evil, saves damsels. I have been open and honest with you from the very moment we spoke.”
Draco watched as a few students left, mainly the Gryffindors. Every single Hufflepuff and Slytherin student remained, as well as a few Gryffindors who remained because of Longbottom, and a few Ravenclaw students remained as they were in awe of Harry’s knowledge, obviously.
“What makes you think I’d be chosen even if I did enter,” said Harry. “There’s plenty of other students who are better than me at magic.”
‘Of course,’ thought Harry, understanding exactly where Tom was going with his argument. ‘Those things took decades to think about and create. We can stop Muggle diseases, but we can’t stop our own. Dragon Pox, for example, has killed how many people? We’re still not even close to a cure because we just don’t have the – I don’t know. It just can’t be cured at this point. We found cures for Muggle diseases while making a cure for Dragon Pox. It was all accidental.’
“Well, in Slytherin, we work by a favour system. As long as the favour asked is valid and won’t cause any harm or social stigma to the person it’s acceptable and is used to pay off any debts that you have accumulated.”
“Thank you,” said Petunia softly, picking up the tea, which was oddly the perfect temperature, but she made no comment. “I honestly cannot wait to try what you have made.”
“Well let’s go to breakfast, don’t worry Blaisey, I’m sure it will be worth it.” Draco grinned and led them out.
Harry just smirked at the Gryffindor captain which proved to make said boy angrier and angrier. He walked away with a determined glint in his eyes. ‘That’s part one of the plan completed,’ he thought as he weaved around a group of students. ‘Part two will be to add as much confusion before the game begins as possible.’
“It shouldn’t mean anything at all! The only thing my house represents is the colour of my robes and the type of emblem I’ll receive. Neither of those are a big deal, but you made it into one,” said Harry, his tone snappish. “I’m not the adult here! It’s not up to me to run around after you, nor is it my job to try and be the parent. Y’know, I’m kinda glad that I was sorted into Slytherin as it revealed your true colours regarding the situation.”
“James!” panted Lily, snapping her husband from his thoughts. She skidded to a halt in front of her husband, who glanced up and gave her a goofy grin. “Harry’s door is locked and I cannot open it with any spells that I know! What if he’s hurt and needs our help?”
“Hello, Flint,” said Harry, dropping into the seat directly opposite Marcus Flint. “I would assume by the facial expression that you’re making that you either have a very bad stomach ache and I should vacate this seat right now or you’re confused.”
Lily nodded, and kept nodding to each word that was spoken, it was all that she could do. The miracle that her son had lived was something that she treasured and she would make sure he had a safe time at Hogwarts, if it meant that she would come and ‘Harry-proof’ the entire school. She had pleaded that the faculty keep Harry’s condition private and that no one except the Malfoys knew about it.
“Right you are, Professor,” said Lee Jordan, a smile on his face. “I was just giving a little bit of background information to the students that were curious. Speaking of which, the Firebolt has a built-in auto-break and –”
After finishing her shower, which woke her up fully, she set off downstairs and began to prepare herself a quick, yet filling, breakfast and ate it at a rather slow pace. She thought heavily on how she would handle the situation and how she would act as if she were shopping. Perhaps she could grab a few everyday items, such as bread and some other essentials, which should cover the trips real purpose nicely.
“I hate apparating, I have since I was little.” Draco finally spat out as he kicked the snow softly.
“I do!” said Neville. “I’ve got to! What if the Dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose this game we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup!”
!” he cleared his throat. “One, he always places a book back onto the shelf an inch away from the edge. No exceptions. Two, his quill and ink are always perfectly aligned, according to Dean. Three, his writing is always precise and evenly spaced. Four, he –”
4) A vampire Harry that is the first natural-born vampire in a thousand years. He will simply become the ‘king’ of vampires and all of them will seek his council. He will be young inexperienced, and fumbling his way through Hogwarts with some insane level of power (think of Atieno). Many vampires will seek to kill him, humans will seek to control him. This will be mainly Drarry, but he will need two other partners (does not need to be sexual) to feed from.
Rosier coughed. “Harry,” he said, fidgeting with the few utensils on the table. “I just wanted to say that I’ve been a bit of a prat these past few weeks –”
Harry verbally agreed with Draco. “There are spells and curses flying around everywhere – should two of them connect and hit someone, well, it could be fatal.”
Harry repeated those same words back at Hermione Granger, in a slightly higher pitch than what was said. He rolled his eyes and prepared to take a step.
“No more revision,” said Ron excitably, a smile forming on his lips. “You could look more cheerful, Neville, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.”
Harry, who had dragged Draco along, paused just in front of the window, curious. He already knew that it had to be a new broomstick on the market, the issue was actually getting an eye on the thing and seeing what it looked like and who made it. They slowly edged around the large families that blocked their vision, gently nudging people out of the way so they could see the broom, not that they were going crazy like a few other people.
“Of course, I was just thinking about who to choose,” Harry looked at the eager students, “Ronald Weasley, would you verse Draco Malfoy in a duel? And who will be your second?”
“Wait, Mr Nocturne? He’s still alive?” said Harry. “Diagon Alley was built in the fifteen hundreds. There’s no way he’s alive unless…”
Harry woke up with the sun beaming down on his face, the blinds were raised and the curtains pushed aside, allowing a thin beam of sunlight to break through into his normally pitch-black bedroom. Ignoring everything as he got out of bed, groaning, and grabbed a handful of clothes. He may have stumbled on a piece of furniture once or twice before he managed to escape his bedroom. He had forgotten the socks, as he usually did, and muttered under his breath.
“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’ yeh see,” said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library – Dragon-Breeding for Pleasure and Profit – it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on ’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ see here – how ter recognise diff’rent eggs – what I got there’s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They’re rare, them.”
“You are using one of my many quotes,” said Severus, stalking around the room like a predator. “You failed to include the most important part of that quote. Recite the whole thing to me.”
Harry nodded to Atieno and watched as the vampire twisted around the corner with surprising speed, nearly knocking something over in the process. He walked as silently as he could, following, and watched as the two men exchanged a whispered conversation. He was curious, even more so when he felt a force wrap around his stomach and pull him towards the two men. As he drew closer, he heard Atieno hiss, the force around his stomach vanish, and then another force drag him directly behind said vampire.
“It looks like no one failed the spell, excellent,” said Professor Moody, vanishing the tables and chairs to the side. “Guess we won’t be needing those. Now, to get this out of the way so you’re all not pestering me about it, the colour of the spell doesn’t mean the wizard is good or evil. Blue isn’t good and red isn’t evil. Are we clear?”
While he had been focusing on his researching on Ekrizdis, despite the fact that he had essentially only just started researching the man, he also attempted to branch out and study other things that had a connection. The library at Hogwarts was huge, as he often said, but it did not have a book, tome, or even scroll for every piece of information. After the Great Library of Alexandria was burned, wizards took that as a sign to spread out their literate and sources in case something similar happened.
“If not,” said Harry, smirking. “I’ll just have to do a favour for him and demand his silence that way.”
He closed a thick book and opened another, ignoring the sounds of chatter as students discussed lessons and their plans. At least, the students who were actually speaking to each other. He pondered whether it was caused by the Goblet of Fire, but realised that it would do it to him, not everyone else. Something about overcoming adversity and such nonsense. Although, he did read that it often caused jealousy between competitors and their closest friend, which made them feel alone.
“Professor Snape’s not mad ‘cos we’re in here,” he said, whispering. “It’s more to the fact that he’s asked them to sit down and remain quiet. The first thing they did was begin a conversation like they were in the Great Hall.”
Harry took a deep breathe, “I don’t really like eating in front of others, it causes me to lose my appetite, I always ate by myself in the corner and when others are around I don’t eat as I feel awkward.”
“I heard that Potter’s father was an amazing Chaser in his days at the school, even has an award on the third-floor for it,” said Terence as he chewed on a piece of bacon. “Honestly, if I were in your shoes, I wouldn’t discredit him or the talent he has a broom. Potter’s father most likely drilled Quidditch into him, hoping he’d go into Gryffindor.”
“Well, they’re always complete opposites,” said Lavender. “I just figured if Neville was a defensive dueller, Potter would be aggressive.”
Harry had his theory on these attacks, as people called them, and he had a few reasons for them. His first theory was simple and had a lot of flaws, but it was solid. He thought that the entire thing was a hoax and that the Chamber hadn’t been opened at all and that whoever did it was done with their joke now. Another was that the ‘attacker’ had simply lost their nerve. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious.
“I see,” said Dumbledore, ignoring Minerva who muttered about Slytherins. “I guess we could switch this around and see what you know about the subject.”
“No potion fails, Potter, no attempt is for nothing,” said Professor Snape in an icy tone. “Perhaps I was an idiot myself for assuming that you had a basic understanding of potions. You may not have made what you wished, but you created something else, something unique.”
Harry nodded, slowly stepping out of the car. “Thank you, David, I appreciate it,” he muttered softly. “Who knows what could’ve happened if you hadn’t shown up. You can always write to me, if you want. I’ll reply in the same way. Call me old-fashioned.”
Narcissa couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Abraxas and his hypocrisy, seeing as the man slept in longer than both Harry and Draco combined. She mouthed one word to her husband and that reflected how she felt easily. “I have been invited to have tea with Pandorea Parkinson, that’s Pansy’s mother.”
Harry just gave the young man a look that said it all. “I’m the most intelligent person to ever step into this castle.”
“Sorry Severus, and not really, he wasn’t at dinner, when you dismissed us to go and talk to Dumbledore, we went separate ways.” Draco straightened in his seat, “is he alright?”
“You think he’s a Parselmouth?” said Severus, looking concerned. “When I asked how to deal with the situation, I didn’t mean to discuss this.”
“Yes,” said Narcissa. “He was picked up by a house-elf before the alert even sounded and that’s because Mopsy is bonded to him and knows where he is and what he is doing because he recently called her.”
Lily herded her son from the store, aware that he was obsessing over his wand, and directed him towards Draco Malfoy, who was standing alone with a bored expression on his face.
Fred rubbed his hands together and watched as his brother clasped his arm around Neville. He knew they could trust Neville with a lot of things, especially pranks, but he wasn’t too sure this time around.
“Dumbledore has all this sway in the magical world and no one would bat an eye if the destroyer of Grindelwald broke a prisoner out of Azkaban to use in a nefarious plot to allow Longbottom to best them sometime during the school year.
Sitting down on the comfortable sofa, Severus glanced around the room, looking at the details as if he would remember their position for all eternity. The sofa that he was currently sitting on was positioned in a way that the warmth from the fireplace would instantly cover the sofa first, which then of course, the warmth would spread out to other parts of the room and finally end up in the dining room.
Professor Snape!” said Harry with complete disdain. “And of course Professor Snape would be helping the headmaster with such a task. He’s highly talented, after all, not many professors in this school could even come close to the level of skill that he has at potions. No one alive, except the headmaster, could even hope to beat Professor Snape in a duel.”
Harry, moving forwards at a careful rate, studied the books with trepidation, hoping that something hadn’t been released in Flourish and Blotts. Instead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass which held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.
Harry could help but smirk as he looked out the window, at the two boys who were still spraying each other with water. “It means what it implies,” he said. “Scientia potentia est.”
“Of course it is, which is why you should start with it, although, that may be on the N.E.W.T exam, I would actually start with Polyjuice.”
“Nah, Dumbledore trusts me now,” said Neville, reading his friend’s thoughts clearly. “After the Stone issue, we spoke over the summer and he realised that it was bad to turn us away when we asked for help.”
“The Ministry wanted the whole ordeal done,” said James. “Too many witches and wizards in one place gave everyone a headache. The Minister is planning to raffle a few off, give some away, and do other things to earn him some more praise with the public.”
“Then you would be glad to assist,” finished Harry, smiling. “I know and I’ll come to you anytime that I need your opinions. You know me, Draco, out of everyone, you’d be the first hat I come to for help.”
“Ah, but you cannot. I’m not sure how to explain it, Draco is currently Harry Potter’s anchor-” Voldemort fiddled through the books, “-they have been for quite some time too, I think it started last year.” Voldemort sat back down, “if Draco leaves Harry Potter for an extended period of time, I fear Harry Potter will lose control over his magic, and blow up the school, as much as I’d love to see that place blow up, Harry Potter will keep growing in strength until he destroys half the world, both Muggle… which isn’t a loss, and the wizarding world.”
Lily’s eyes instantly narrowed. “Even if I had the desire to join you or your ranks as a Death Eater,” she continued slowly, making sure her wording was decent. “I couldn’t. I have a husband who is firmly on the side of the light, and I frequently get together with friends who would be rather furious if they saw your symbol on my arm.” Sighing, she took a very small back, that way her footing was flat and not on a slight hill. “I’m going to be purely honest, not that I haven’t before, but I don’t care about this war, I just want my son, my Harry, to be safe.”
“Right you are, Mr. Potter,” said Dumbledore. “So we best get this started and not waste any more time. A few of the professors have expressed certain concerns that the work we’re providing you with, Mr. Potter, is not adequate for your skill level.”
“What do we do now?” asked Miles. “There’s still a few of ‘em that don’t have any stripes and they’re looking rather upset about it.”
“My logic isn’t flawed!” snapped Harry, kicking at the stone slab in the grass. “I have studied the logic very closely and have determined that it’s true! Casting any sort of magic on the flower will cause it to wilt!”
“There you are, Susan, that was much better,” said Harry, his tone of voice filled with praise. “Now levitate this book, and be careful not to break it.”
Severus waited patiently for Harry to make the first move, like most duels it all started off on the first move and if no one moved the duel could be at a standstill for a while until something for agitated enough to throw the first spell. He knew that Harry always played black in chess, so he’d use the same tactic and use the first spell of the enemy to capitalise and push on from that. The issue was that both of them had that same tactic.
“Wow,” said Harry simply. “It’s good that his mother allowed him to stay, we need to hone and train our magical skills… an untrained wizard is more deadly than a trained one.”
“Quit thinking so hard,” said Professor Snape as he peered into the cauldron. “Only people that achieve an ‘Outstanding’ on their O.W.L.s are allowed into my class. I do not tolerate slackers.”
“Oh my yes,” said Mr. Ollivander. “The more showy types of duellers or casting. There’s some that believe that a duel should be as excitable and dramatic as possible.”
“I’m not so sure, Harry, after all, you did wake us all up with your unusual cheerful mood and then you instantly retreated back to your bed in order to read a book,” said Draco, attempting to imitate Professor Snape, which he almost succeeded at. “I do apologise, Harry, I had no idea that the tapping of my foot was disturbing your reading.”
Harry sneered and then blinked, wiping the expression off his face and replacing it with a polite yet charming smile. “That does make a certain degree of sense. Here,” he peered downwards and got a look at the books she was carrying, the smile morphed into a slight smirk, “allow me to help you with your search.”
Narcissa summoned the candlestick from the sobbing house-elf’s hands. “Mopsy, Harry will not be impress if he finds out you punished yourself, you know he doesn’t like it, it makes him cry.” It was a lie, Harry wouldn’t cry, but he would glare at the thing and try and soothe it. “You did well, Mopsy, you saved his life.”
“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Flitwick, jumping slightly on the pile of books. “If you’ll just come into the room over there, we’ll get your practical part done in just a jiffy.” He led Harry into the small and dark room, which was almost pitch black, just a few strands of light flickered in from the windows. “Before we continue, would you like to try for some extra points?”
“We haven’t found out what caused the wards to drop yet-” Lucius walked in and raised his eyebrows at Narcissa gently rubbing Harry’s back, “-is everything all right?”
“Thank you Harry for getting rid of him, as well as you Hermione for casting a privacy charm. Ten points each to Gryffindor.”
“Wards can be broken and pried into, this place cannot.” Lucius paused, “You may meet someone very… interesting in here, don’t be afraid.”
your mother. It seems like your brain and magic worked in tandem to fight against the negative effects of Veritaserum. Are you, as of now, of sound mind?”
“It was great, Harry enjoys his room, he was really impressed with the house, and he assumed it would be a dark and gloomy mess.” Narcissa frowned.
“Come on, Weasley,” said Harry. “I didn’t stutter and I know that I used simple words for you to understand. We better leave the angry kitty cat before it coughs up a furball or something else as disgusting as that.”
The two boys stepped into the potions classroom and glanced around, both their gazes lingered on the irate Potions Master briefly before they announced themselves with a subtle throat clear and then a sigh. They walked in and stood at the desk facing the potions master.
Harry nudged Ron and caused the boy to fall down the trapdoor. “Oops,” he said, an innocent expression on his face. “I slipped.”
“I didn’t want to come here! Professor Quirrell is such a huge reason why that I felt as if going to Durmstrang would have been better than here. The man stutters and often ignores half the class to fawn over Longbottom, I’ve only had two lessons with him so far and I have learned nothing of importance. What use does the Wand-Lighting Charm have in Defence Against the Dark Arts, especially when we’re learning about that in Charms sometime next year, just before we go into our second year?”
“No, Granger, you see, Weasley is correct, his pitiful excuse for a family has no money, so they became wannabe detectives.”
At first, he wanted to argue with Tom about it, it was just one thing and if Muggles called them freaks, who really cared, but then he realized he didn’t care about the Muggles. “I can do magic, so what?”
“Yeah, mate, he made off and then wasn’t seen again for most’ve the night,” said Ron, while pushing open the doors to the hospital wing. “Haven’t you noticed that he hasn’t really aged? I mean his dad is tall and Lily ain’t short either, yet he’s tiny.”
“Desperation,” corrected Atieno. “He has been lurking around the school ever since, looking for a way in. He, like every other person alive, believes the Philosopher’s Stone to be destroyed. He attempted to get in last year when the Chamber was opened but was warded off by the headmaster, who looked highly furious that he had come back so soon.”
“– it isn’t life threatening, but she is sick,” continued Narcissa. “Your father is staying with her and refuses to leave her side, making sure that she has everything she needs and what she doesn’t need at the moment is her son flinging around words that personally insult her. He forwarded the report to Lucius, who in turn pushed it to me, claiming that I was better prepared to handle it.”
Harry swallowed loudly and looked at Draco, “now that we’re somewhat friends, I want to apologize. You see the day I used your shower I accidently knocked your hair products flying when I tripped, I fixed them but I’m sure they’re not in order anymore.”
Susan shot the boy a very, very confused glance, one that would have caused even the most oblivious person to notice it. She didn’t follow the boy’s thought process on why it was a good idea, although, Professor Sprout did state that not many could actually follow the boy’s line of thinking, that he was odd in his own way, and that was the only leaving advice that she was given regarding Harry Potter. “Alright, alright, but I didn’t think that Slytherin wanted to take part with the other houses.”
You have all been so patient and great. :) I'll try not to let you all down again. I'll fix up any mistake later on if there is any left. If you see any, feel free to let me know.
“Right you are, Mr. Potter,” said Dumbledore. “But that doesn’t mean that you should learn everything before you’ve even sat for your O.W.L.s.”
Lily nodded sadly, she had heard about the struggled that Lucius was having. She offered silent support to her friend and took a sip of her tea, hoping for any more news on the matter.
“Thank you for letting me know that I was required to leave, wouldn’t wand Madam Pince coming after me.”
Salazar and Atieno were nothing short of geniuses, even more-so considering their time. They had obscure knowledge that could rival Voldemort and Dumbledore combined. However, in his eyes, he was better than them. He wouldn’t say it to their faces, but he knew. He had devised, created, and perfected a spell that would be nothing short of perfection. It would become a new staple in a lot of circles.
Neville and Ron went back to the common room. Neville slumped into a chair and glanced at Ron. “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail.”
The only light came from him and it hardly illuminated the cave-like walls that were slowly surrounding him. Wrapping his arms around himself, he rushed forwards, walking at a speedier pace.
Harry sat up straighter and looked at Nicolas Flamel. “Mr. Flamel, I must admit, that sounds like a very reasonable idea.”
“Is that what this is about?” said Daphne. “You’re jealous that he found someone else to spend his time with? You’re angry that he’s branching out?”
Petunia didn’t smile back, instead she looked beyond the two, making sure nothing freaky was going on. “I’m good, you?” She glanced down from Lily and looked back into green eyes, almost exactly the same as Lily’s. “And you must be Harry.”
“You can get drunk off Butterbeer,” said Michael. “They did a massive write-up on it in the Daily Prophet. It’d take a lot, but you can get drunk.”
“Because you’ll just do something stupid anyway and defend him, I’ll do whatever you want, but you dying will not be one of them. Those thoughts need to leave your head Harry, I’m apart of you, I feel what you feel, I know how much you love and care for Draco, if the future looks bleak, focus solely on him, let him be the light in the darkness.”
“– an act! When has Harry ever done something like this? He may be my son and I may have been a prankster in my youth, but never on this level. Harry’d never do something that would upset Lily, and vanishing off a train during an attack isn’t something that would cross his mind. Stupid man!”
Ron gaped at the professor, slowly adding up the total that he just lost in his head. Twenty points.
“Maybe,” said Harry. “Still, we live far beyond that timeframe that it’s nothing. What’s twenty years when we can live for up to two hundred?”
Eventually one Healer had mentioned that perhaps Harry had already lived half his life already, which was a nice way of saying he had three years to live and that death was certain at the age of six.
“What method is he teaching you?” asked Narcissa hastily moving her bishop out of the way, she needed that piece to checkmate her son. “There’s multiple ways to put Occlumency in practice, not all are known and practiced, but they count. I assume it’s one of two more common methods. You’re disguising your real emotions with fake ones, so when a Legilimens looks into your mind he or she sees the fake memories and is swindled, a real Slytherin approach.”
The sleep was peaceful for Harry, whom had dreamed of some stupid mirror that held nothing for him in it, well it showed something but he couldn’t remember it. The other part of his brief dream was something about Rowena Ravenclaw and a Diadem, which she apparently hid in a shrub. He was woken by Draco who shoved him gently to wake him up. “Hm – Draco – what do you want?”
“Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” asked Hermione, pointing at the masses of spiders. “I’ve never read about spiders acting this way – it’s like they’re afraid.”
“Rookwood is only joining us for a year,” said Professor Snape. “Keep the petty pre-school rivalries off the school grounds, Mr. Nott. Now come, there’s plenty to discuss.”
“Harry cannot floo,” said Lily, her face betraying none of the annoyance that she felt saying it for the third time. “We portkeyed here. It took about three minutes to get up the path, but it was a nice walk.”
“Not likely!” said Neville, throwing up another weak shield. “If you’re so good, why haven’t you won it yet?”
Harry nodded and started to dig around in his shoulder bag, searching for the notes he had prepared for this very situation. It payed to be prepared for anything, at least that’s what Lucius said. “If you could, please, I’d appreciate it. I feel so bad that it took me a long time to compile, but I’m sure the neatness and the layout will benefit anyone that actually reads them.”
Severus stood next to Draco, he had a faint smirk on his face, hoping sometime soon something like this would happen. Harry has always been a somewhat advanced dueller, not because of knowledge, because the power he holds will guide him either way, Harry could use smart friends, like Draco. Granger isn’t so bad, because she’s smart, how she wasn’t placed in Ravenclaw was completely beyond Severus. Severus was thrown out of the thought when he saw flashes of light and a few gasps.
Harry wasted no time in admiring the lush room that was decorated with gold trim and a nice dark blue that swirled throughout the walls. He ran his index finger over the spines of the books, hunting for the book that Draco had described to him before he came, already knowing his father’s policy. ‘Purple cover, with a leaf that changes colour based on your mood,’ he thought, making himself angry and then happy. ‘Title is obscured and impossible to read… not because of damage, but because the book wishes it to be.’
Draco crawled out of a hole with a triumphant smile. His hair was spiked up in all directions, no part of it in place at all. His smile quickly faltered as he looked for Professor Lupin, his dirt covered face seeking out the professor at once.
“Fifteen inches, dragon heartstring, beech – curious, very curious.” Ollivander said calmly. “This wand was the first wand you picked up. Mr. Potter, it’s curious that the real owner had been in the store at the time.”
Lily tensed when she saw a cloud of black smoke slowly engulfing her son, she wondered if he had already accepted. But the spell just cleared off without any other prompting. She had a million questions about what that was.
Harry was receiving letters from Draco via Hermione, he debated telling her to sod off because it was cheating but read them anyway, it revealed that Slytherin would let Harry win assuming he would pick them in the next event and that they score at least one hundred points. Harry agreed to it, he could do with that, ‘sneaky snakes.’ Harry chuckled to himself as he drifted off to sleep for the sixth time that day.
Harry mentally fought his urge to twist around and face the man, which it had to be as it was quite a deep voice. If he turned, his face would be revealed and then he would be tracked down and thrown into the Ministry holding cells, which he desired to avoid at all costs. He instantly thought about Robin, the man who had taken the consequences for someone he never knew. Oh, how he hated that man. He knew that no one would take him seriously, as did Robin, and that any attempts to jump on a table, screaming for the innocence of Robin Banks, would go ignored, even if he was chugging a phial of Veritaserum, which he would not do for obvious reasons.
“Your parents would know, Granger, as they’re Muggles and clueless on anything that happens in our world. Mine are far too young and weren’t around prior to Dumbledore being a headmaster, same with Weasley’s parents. However, Longbottom’s grandma is old enough to have attended Hogwarts prior to Dumbledore, seeing as she’s like ninety.”
‘And to think, Hogwarts is claimed to be the best school,’ he thought bitterly. ‘Why couldn’t I have gone to Durmstrang? They at least teaching duelling, fighting, and other spells that are of use.’
Harry’s glare intensified, daggers were an understatement. Harry was glaring two-handed swords at Blaise.
“Shut up, Potter,” shouted Ron, his voice travelled across the Great Hall, echoing off each wall as if it was a stray spell.
It became rather interesting when he noticed the boy tapping the desk in a pattern four times and a cauldron to appear. He couldn’t help but be surprised, seeing as the boy’s hand went through the cauldron when he was tapping. He really wanted to take a step closer and observe the potion, he tried his hardest to inspect it without moving, but more than once he felt Potter’s eyes fall on him or near him with suspicion filling the dulled green-eyes. Of course this did not deter Severus in one moment, especially when some moments later the boy in question stood and dashed towards the storeroom.
He paused unexpectedly, lifting his head as he caught sight of Draco. He bit into his lip and turned left, giving the boy a wide berth. He knew that Draco would be angry, not that they were currently speaking, but it was best to avoid that particular confrontation until they had both calmed down.
Harry smiled; Ginny was by far the best Chaser Harry had ever seen, she would go places if she pursued a career in Quidditch. Harry flew around and caught a glimpse of the Snitch, he heard Lee announce a few more goals, and by glance Gryffindor was leading seventy to zero. Harry thought now would be a great time to fly after the Snitch and he did. He was only a few inches when he caught Ginny falling from her broom, not high up but the fall would do damage.
“Professor Snape,” said Harry, correcting the red-headed boy once more, which he took great pleasure in. He ignored the approving look that Granger sent him. “But your accusation is clearly wrong. I can assure you that Professor Snape isn’t after whatever that dog is guarding.”
“I will, thank you,” said Harry with a slight smile before pausing in his leaving once more, his shoe squeaked along the floor. “Same time next week then, I assume?”
“That’s easy, I’ll arrange it as soon as this is finished and it should be set up for you to use tonight, what would you like Harry?”
“Of course I do, I love the Malfoy Manor. Spending time in the gardens with your mother is my favourite pastime, except maybe of course beating you in Quidditch,” Harry smiled at the glare he got, it was all he needed to raise his spirits. “You’ve beaten me plenty of times, don’t be so sour about it.”
“Ronald Bilius Weasley!” she barked, already knowing that both of them were awake. “What have I said about using such
“Harry,” said Draco in a slightly worried voice. “If your parents are there, mine will want to come along also, you know how my mother is.”
He twisted and avoided a pole, which had seemingly come out of nowhere. He glanced downwards and realised that they were somewhat closer to the ground than what they should have been, especially considering they were meant to be trying to not be seen, whether be Aurors or witches and wizards that were there to see the World Cup. It made no sense to him that they would travel through the few scattered tents and random people in an attempt to win a race.
“I’m Gemma Farley by the way. I’m a Prefect for Slytherin, you’ll meet the other Prefect soon, he’s spending most of his time gloating to his fellow fifth years, and unlike him I’ll actually help you.”
“I know I will as they’re just over there,” said Harry, steering Rosier with his hand towards the blond-haired boy, or better known as, Draco Malfoy. “Draco!”
Harry sighed, but kept walking regardless. “Maybe it’s because I was sorted into Slytherin, or because I’m intelligent and attractive –”
Harry shook his head, forcing the thoughts away; he gently placed his glasses on the bedside table and lay down on his bed. He cursed himself soon after for not using the bathroom before attempting to sleep, he didn’t bother with his glasses. Harry flicked his legs off the bed and slowly tiptoed towards the lavatory.
The owl hooted and picked up the box with its foot and flew away, Lucius wrapped Narcissa in a warm hug.
“Unlike you, I was listening to them during Defence Against the Dark Arts and I learned something… something that’ll put us ahead of them.”
“What?” he said angrily. “I didn’t get that last step, so why are we stopping like I’ve mastered it when I clearly haven’t?”
Although, it did not take long before he witnessed the swift defeat of the Gryffindor. It was pretty much rapid. One red, two red, three red. All within the span of five seconds.
It was almost nine thirty when she finally got around to seeing Harry, who was happily sitting in his cot making various sounds that babies did. Already changed and fed, as it seemed. Both of which had surprised her as it must have been James before he left for work, which was a very rare thing.
Harry nodded in slight agreement. “Besides, you still have to help me perfect this base on this potion, something about it seems off, and I have invented my own potion before and I cannot for the life of me figure out why it’s like this…”
“Your mother Lily was sorted into Gryffindor, your father wanted to be with her, so your father demanded the Sorting Hat to place him into Gryffindor, the Sorting Hat couldn’t object due to him being a Potter and obliged, you did the same, except so you wouldn’t be with Draco, which was to be expected… the Potters and Malfoys never got along, animosity lasting generations. The Malfoy family wanted to be like the Potter family, jealousy caused a great debate, and in fact you and Draco are the first Potter and Malfoy to actually get along since the whole ordeal started.” Snape let out a malicious grin, but that was interrupted by Dumbledore.
“His revenge was tacky, but made sense,” said Draco, eyeing Harry. “You’re now the baby of Slytherin… a little child.”
Meanwhile, in the changing rooms, Harry and the rest of the team were discussing strategy. Nothing new or exciting was really explained and everyone seemed to pick up on it quickly.
“What do you expect Seamus? Harry used his magic in a duel trying to beat Professor Snape, then he gets up and walks- no runs around the castle like he’s fine, fatigue is catching up.” Hermione scowled at Seamus.
“I’m still glad you see me as a friend Harry, all that I have done to you.” Ron stood up and held out his hand out towards Harry.
“Father would be displeased if you did that at home,” said Draco, watching Harry lean against the wall, the chair creaking as if severe pressure was put on it. “You’ll break the legs!”
“Is a light wizard,” said Salazar. “He cannot sense the aura of the Dark Arts or he would expel half of the Slytherin students. Only a dark wizard can sense a dark wizard.”
Harry smirked and turned to Marcus, odd how the brutish boy became Marcus in his head and not Flint anymore. “As for your playmaker issue, I can probably assist with that,” he said softly, not wanting to draw any attention and get blamed for holding up the team. “I’m great at strategy.”
“…the worst name I have ever head,” said Harry, scratching his forehead. “I’m a tad more creative than that, you know.”
“It wouldn’t bother me because you’d be the one shortening a nickname,” said Harry. “Harry is a shortened version of Hadrian or Harrison. Making a nickname of a nickname is
He pointed his wand at a lone Inferius, a fireball emerging from the tip for a split-second before it sailed through the air, exploding on impact with the creature. A few moments later, a whip made of fire emerged and sliced through three Inferi, cutting deep into their rotting flesh, dismembering limbs, causing them to fall over and roll around uselessly. He spared them a slight glance before incinerating them with a wave of his hand.
“Should we depart?” he asked, gesturing towards the side benches. “There’s no need to dance and I’d love to just talk.”
“Don’t take too long,” said Draco, splitting off from Harry. “Father will be very displeased if we keep him waiting.”
Harry was trying to return to the Gryffindor common room as quickly as he could; he turned around a corner and walked straight into someone, “s-sorry!” Harry muttered as he attempted to stand.
“Not yet,” said Severus, his facial expression just the same. “Despite the fact that I’m one of few potions masters, I feel like work just isn’t coming. The Dark Lord has all but ruined the chances of holding a career in that field as he destroyed most, if not all, the imports from ingredients for the rarer potions.”
“Harry, you’re one of few that has the right to call me Dumbledore, you don’t need to address me any other way. I said the same thing two years ago.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
“No one cares, Granger,” said Harry, watching the carriage. “Go jump in the lake and talk to the fish.”
“Is pure magic, enough magic to feed the beast for a millennia,” said Atieno. “I am amazed and curious as to why it has not devoured it yet. It must be attempting something. Before you even ask, they are not native to this part of the world, which means someone either unknowingly brought it here or something suspicious is going on. It is curious, however. I would love to ask it, but if I get to close to it, well, it will devour me and that cannot be done.”
“That’s one way to interrupt a class so rudely, Mr. Longbottom,” said Professor Snape, sneering. “Fifteen points from Gryffindor. Sit down.”
He bit his lip, stopping himself from swearing at the trunk, which meant that Longbottom had it elsewhere. He stood and glanced around the room, wondering why Longbottom would leave it in the open, of course the thought was stupid, he was a Gryffindor, and none of the other Gryffindors would dare read another person’s book. He walked around to the desk near Longbottom’s bed and flicked around in it, shifting around quills, half-completed work and of course a few inkpots. He picked up the half-completed essay for Potions and snorted, it was terrible, badly written and a few things were wrong, it would be an Acceptable at best, if Professor Snape was feeling generous.
“Terra Fractorem!” Harry shouted and Harry knew the incantation was a little off, but it should have worked.
“It’s not exactly fair that the three of you are discussing the Tournament and talking about upcoming tasks without Neville,” said Hermione, folding her arms. “You’re all working together, leaving him out of any information that you learn. It’s almost as if you’re teaming up against him, purposefully excluding him because he won the first task and he seems like a threat.”
The duel raged on for a few more moments before the girl was sent skidding along the platform by a very nasty looking bright blue spell, which had the boy laughing like a loon.
He bit the inside of his cheek, his eyes flicked towards the floor-to-ceiling window that caused the Slytherin common room to fill with a green glow and focused solely on that, not being able to not look at Draco was not a weakness, instead he was making sure that he didn’t crush the boy further than he already did.
Thinking back to the Elixir of Life, he thought that maybe that could be the issue. He had been using it, rather frequently, over the years and no one had studied the long-term effects of drinking elixirs. Some could make you mad, others sad, and some leave you comatose. But no, despite how secretive Nicolas Flamel and his wife had been, they had made a promise.
“I’m not sure, Weasley, the food was pretty bad, but clearly not as bad as the food that your mother cooked, now that was terrible…”
“He didn’t do it,” said Harry, his tone cold. “Granger, Longbottom and Weasley found the cat like this and arrived moments before the entire group did. In fact, they had a small argument about running away from it.”
3) Scabbers is Peter. Ron found him prior to school while searching the garden. Percy never had him and none of the other Weasley family know about him. James and co. have never seen Scabbers, just heard him described.
Petunia didn’t move or complain about the magic saving the cake she had spent hours and hours making, instead she just sat there, her eyes focused on the floor as if waiting for it to swallow her whole.
“If that’s all, headmaster, I would like to go and re-join my fellow Slytherins and tell them about the wonderful adventure I had,” said Harry. “I’d also like to soothe Draco, who is most likely scratching at the walls or something as dramatic.”
“You assume that I convinced Mr. Potter, a student, to openly taunt another student?” said Professor Snape. “If I could convince him of anything, it’d be to drop that stupid phrase of his.”
“In memory of two students who departed the world far too soon. While they may be gone, their spirit and impact on Hogwarts remains,” he said, sliding his finger over the metal. “Stephen Gardner, fourteen, Hufflepuff… a kind, forgiving wizard that wanted to change the world. Edward Reid, fourteen, Ravenclaw… studious, brave, everything that all young men should aspire to be.”
He dodged to the side when a vine appeared from nowhere, slamming into the ground where he was. He had time to blink once before he felt a vine wrap around his ankle, lifting him up almost instantly. He flicked his wand, trying to slice the vine in half, yet was unable to hit it. He dangled, frustrated, for quite a while until he was dropped on his head. Before he could move, the vine wrapped around his torso, turning him onto his front. He felt another slide across his legs, over his bottom, and up the indent of his back. He shivered slightly as the vine wrapped around his neck, squeezing slightly. His fingertips brushed against the handle of his wand for a moment before his arms were trapped by another vine.
“You lost,” said Harry bluntly, shrugging. “You caught the Snitch, yes, as I planned. We were one hundred and sixty points in front, so it put you ten points behind. It takes a good Seeker to catch the Snitch, it takes an even better Seeker to know when to not catch the Snitch.”
“Take another step forwards and you’ll regret it, Weasley,” said Harry, smirking. “I personally want you to push me so I can curse you.”
“It was too late,” said Lily. “Now, they’re forced to try and get witches and wizards through the barrier without alerting the hundreds of Muggles out there, panicking and screaming. The best course of action was to, in the long run, not meddle.”
Professor Lupin paused before giving his answer. He hushed the group and crept forwards, hoping to find the lost student as soon as possible. “We’re close.”
“Yes, and my feelings Pans, they hurt with that remark.” Draco rolled his eyes and went to wake Harry up.
Theo lifted an eyebrow but said nothing else on the matter, he wondered briefly what Harry would need to make a potion and why he didn’t just go to Professor Snape or Madam Pomfrey. “You were making a potion? When did you even have time for this? I always see you around.”
“Yeah, the same thing happened when I was eleven, I had to restore the wards and was set as a founder so I wouldn’t keep shattering them, I forgot to tell you.”
Harry woke up with drool dripping down his face; he gently slid off his glasses and looked at Draco, “when are we leaving this place? I am so bored, and hungry, and tired.” Harry closed his eyes briefly before opening them, “can I copy your potions work? I didn’t do it and I don’t want Snape to assign me more that I won’t actually do, no one cares about half the stuff he assigns. Why would I need to make a potion when I can just go and ask him for one and he will give me one?”
Severus’ smirk grey wide when he learned that he would soon figure out how the boy was getting through the ward and being able to take ingredients freely, as it was locked after lesson time to stop this kind of thing.
politician when you’re older. You’ll be better than Lucius, he and I both know that... I’m sure even you know that.”
“They are perfectly valid,” she said. “A distant friend, who is a Muggle-born, purchased them for me and I know he would never be taken advantage of.”
“Oh my yes,” said Lily. “It shocks me to no end that something like that happened! He could have died.” She glanced down at her son, who had a rather bored expression on his face, as if he hardly cared if Neville died or not. “Thank Merlin he didn’t die. I’m not sure what I would have done if the positions were reversed and it was you in his position. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing that you were in any sort of danger.”
. Your father, with the help of – and this will amaze you – Ronald Weasley, created mock weaknesses for the entirety of the Auror Department. Somethings may be their weaknesses, but most of them have been reversed. Nymphadora Tonks is one of the agilest witches I have ever seen.”
He said his goodnights to Petunia and Vernon, who were still awake, and headed for bed, intent to sort this out and figure out if these Masons were the same as the wizarding kind, as it seemed probable.
“Me? Nothing, I just wanted him out of the library,” said Harry with a smirk. “He was so loud and he was simply distracting me, so I made him leave.”
Harry ducked it, glaring. “Avis!” he muttered and watched as a flock of small, colourful birds appeared from thin air. “Oppugno!”
Harry snorted into his goblet and looked at the girl who had just sat next to him. “I cannot believe our headmaster is messed up in the head.”
Slytherin was already in the finals due to winning all their games. Points hardly matter in the long run as wins were more important. This was to stop teams banding together and allowing one team to win by thousands of points, pushing the leader out. Point tallies were only added in case of a tie between houses.
He reached across his bed and picked up his pyjamas and slipped from his room, walking straight towards the bathroom, planning on getting ready for bed in record time.
“No one is to ever know,” said Harry, a hint of determination in his voice. “No pictures, no pensieve memories nothing that can incriminate me in the future about being a girl.”
Draco used his free lessons to spend it with Harry, who told him about his adventures in the castle, Draco secretly used this time to hunt for Harry’s body, however, he thought he found something earlier that day, and that he would have to talk to Hermione later on, and maybe borrow Harry’s cloak. The two boys relaxed on the grass until the sunset. Draco realized he was late for curfew and couldn’t afford a detention at this point, Harry scouted the way back for him, and got him back to his common room without a detention, of course Snape caught Harry and suspected something, but decided not to pursue it.
Snape sighed, “Lily gave me permission to use it on Harry during school to make sure he was fine, that’s why I can, I need permission to use it and I doubt his mother would approve. This discussion is over Draco and keep it quiet, no one is to know.”
Harry finally finished his conversation with Hermione, she hadn’t noticed anything suspicious with Ron, but then again she did say he was being a gigantic arse and she was avoiding him anyway. Harry was amused with the statement and turned to speak to Hagrid, but he was gone. Harry pouted a little bit and then realized that there was one ghost in the school that would still enjoy talking to him, at least until he can find Draco.
“Hi Ronald, I’m great actually. Being able to fly and go through walls is actually rather fun.” Harry turned to Hermione and shot her a smile. Hermione attempted to hug Harry, but just fell through him.
The crowd leaned forwards in anticipation, the second through to fifth-years were all present, as if they had a little notification on whether Neville Longbottom would get embarrassed on a particular day.
“Thank you! Thank you!” cried Lily repeatedly, pulling away from the almost one-sided embrace she sent him a warm smile. “Please come in. I’m so glad that you came, you have no idea.”
“Flint makes it his daily goal to harass the first-years. I have a feeling that’s what Gemma challenged him to a duel over, as it has cut down significantly, but it’s still annoying have him loom over you throwing out petty taunts.”
The walls were a soft light blue with white swirls through them, almost representing clouds. The panelling which took up less than half of the wall was oak wood, which had square designs on it.
“Good morning,” said Draco. “I’m sure a lot of people are gonna be awake early. They all want to go and stalk the Goblet to see who puts their name in it.”
Harry allowed Vasily to get a few steps ahead of him so he could better study the five men he had yet to meet or speak to. He fully expected to be greeted in a foreign language, to have to deal with hard to decipher accents, and a few stares at Vasily so he could translate those hard words that do not cross into other languages. Of course, he was hardly concerned about starting a group conversation where he would not be able to understand six out of seven people.
Hermione waited for the students to leave the field. She watched as another Slytherin boy went to collect the frozen Harry Potter and edged him out of the gate, a sneer on his face. She closed the gate and the latch and followed after Neville and Ron.
“You – Granger – why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? Trying to upstage the Boy Who Lived? Ten points from Gryffindor.”
Mrs Weasley stopped whatever she was going to say, glancing towards the fireplace, which had given a slight ‘ding’ sound, as if something inside was ready.
“I don’t like how he acts so caring,” said Harry. “He doesn’t care that one third of the school targets one House mercilessly. I know he doesn’t encourage it, but he allows it, which is worse than not stopping it. I guess, my Slytherin side just detests that he has so much power and influence and never uses it. Britain could be so much
“Yes, not that it bothers us honestly, he’s been a git this year, hopefully the Muggles at least put him in place.”
Harry sat in the formal dining room, which was primarily used for partied and large events, and studied the mahogany table with slight annoyance. One was built from stone and had a large fireplace directly in the centre, each side had an arch that led into the hallway. The three other walls were built from big glass planes, allowing the room to be submerged in natural light. Of course, there was a small pond with a waterfall and various plants that blocked the glass, allowing for a nice view as you ate.
“How interesting,” said Dumbledore, every word that he had said was true. “Severus is rather talented at spell creation. I am glad that he has taken you under his wing and aided you in your learning. I feel foolish for not realising it before, but that explains why you are decent at potions.”
“Look there, see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”
“I must, I admit,” said Draco, a fake smile plastered over his face. He couldn’t stop the laugh that happened when Harry began to try and pat down his hair. “You do know that this is revenge for calling Theodore ‘Teddy Bear’ in public, right?”
“I do, I do,” said Harry, sneering, not that anyone could see it. “Why don’t you go and fight him, Weasley? Maybe he’ll kill you and his bloodlust will be sated. That’s a win-win situation, Weasley, you die and Pettigrew doesn’t kill Longbottom.”
“Get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred, attempting to nudge his brother out of the way. “Neville’s in a hurry!”
“Please, call me Harry,” said Harry. “And I never implied you to be weak, but we stand no chance against a werewolf if we don’t work together. I do admit that I am saddened by the fact you haven’t heard of me.”
Harry however, did not deem that a very legal play and blocking the Seeker should be punishable, although if they wanted to play like that, he would join in and make them taste some justice. He hovered near Lucian Bole, who was doing a perfectly fine job as he hit away multiple Bludgers in quick succession. “Bole, give me your damn bat!” He practically shouted and caught the bat that was tossed to him.
“Apparently Harry apparated Draco to an unplottable location, that in itself makes no sense, but let’s hope Draco can get Harry to safety, else we’ll be hunting for two.” Dumbledore nodded and sat back down.
Harry stared at the headmaster, curious, debating whether or not he should say something about his spell being a destructive based spell. He decided against it, just before he opened his lips to say that it mimicked a volcano’s eruption and burned the person alive. “I’m not sure if you know that when I was a lot younger I worked with Professor Snape in various things, such as potions and spells, and we came up with an idea. The spell was rather simple and it was hardly a new thing, but how we were going to implement it and make it work was,” he paused, noticing that his mother, James, and the headmaster were all intrigued. “It’s a lot like the Stinging Hex, just slightly different. Instead’ve stinging the opponent, it tickles them. The spell was designed to be something to help younger children learn to duel.
“That was awesome, Harry!” said Dudley while giving his cousin a soft slap on the back, already learning how frail his cousin looks. “I never thought you’d actually go and pick it up, it’s like you understood it.”
Harry dashed over towards the sinks and washed the knife, as well as the other potions ingredients and neatly packed them away. He pulled out a piece of parchment and began to write hastily.
Harry, disregarding Professor McGonagall’s orders, opened a different book and a different page and began reading. He frowned when the book was snatched from his grip and floated towards the professor, who began flicking through it the instant it had reached her. “Professor –”
There were no taunts, as expected, no sounds of frustration, no sounds of various spells smashing into conjured or summoned objects, no destruction, and no sounds of an audience. The whole area seemed to be washed in some kind of serenity, allowing complete ease and concentration. The sounds of spells being spoken seemed to not exist outside the sphere of the arena.
Ron, who already had his wand held tightly in his hand, jumped up and knocked the chair backwards slightly. “Say that again, Potter!”
“When the champions’ names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and then go through into the next chamber,” said Dumbledore, gesturing towards the door behind the staff table. “Once there, they will be receiving their first set of instructions and details.”
Lily turned and looked at Draco Malfoy, who was standing proudly. “We want you to come, Draco, we really do, but the more people that come along, the harder it will be to find him and keep everyone in check.”
“You shouldn’t speak like that, Harry. People may think you grew up in Malfoy Manor,” said Draco, letting out a very soft half laugh. “Although, I can assure you that you pretty much did, you even have a room there!”
“You will find out everything you need to know, in the morning!” Filch said in his usual tone, all while grabbing Draco by the sleeve and nearly pushing him down the stairs. Draco didn’t both to argue, he just slouched and kept walking.
James, on the other hand, was almost radiating anger as he listened and absorbed his son’s words. “I’ve never said anything like that,” he said, his eyes flickering with betrayal. “I may’ve tread the fine line, but I have never claimed that all Slytherins were Death Eaters. Damn it, Harry, I’m the Head Auror! I cannot be biased.”
“It’s a large school, Rosier,” muttered Harry. “It’d be odd to not see a rodent around. It’s probably searching for food.”
Harry decided he would talk to Draco for a while before doing some homework, while he walked down the stairs he noticed a letter taped to his wand. Harry noticed it was addressed to Draco, he quickly hurried along. Harry ran into a familiar face and couldn’t help but frown.
“Yes, it’s true. When he was with Ginny, he had never done anything of the sort. He must be really into you.” Although he was pleased to know all this, he could not avoid feeling a slight twinge in his heart. “I’m not sure he’s feeling the same anymore…” His words came out as a whisper, but loud enough to be heard, letting his fears and concerning transpire.
He walked out of the room and looked for Harry. He found him in his home office, doing some paperwork. Even in his comatose state, Draco could not help but notice how beautiful his man was. In a simple white shirt, the sleeves rolled up, showcasing his muscled forearms, he looked effortlessly charming. The first two buttons were undone, giving a little peek of his hairy chiselled chest and his shoulder filled obscenely the piece of cloth. His wild curls were tousled as always, giving him the urge to run his fingers through them. Even when sitting, doing something so mundane as work, Harry managed to transpire power and strength. He leaned against the door jamb, arm crossed over his chest, waiting for Harry to finish his work, or notice him. As if he had heard his thoughts, Harry looked up from the documents he was working on, his face brightening as the sun itself, a tender smile tucking his lips. Draco’s knees went weak.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?! I was about to cum!” A malicious smile bloomed on Draco’s face. He loosened the grip and stroked with both hands Potter’s strong sweaty tights, to prevent himself from touching his neglected cock. “Oh, I know. But I need you to do a little something for me, will you?” Potter frowned in confusion and a little bit of curiosity. “What is It?” His smile became toothy. “I want you to fuck my face.” Potter’s brain seemed to stop working for a second, cause his face went blind but his cock bopped heavily between his legs.
Fingers left his body, but Draco had not time to feel empty, as Harry’s cock soon was seated between his buttocks. “Lift.” Instructed Harry and he did as told, standing on his knees and hands-on Harry’s wide shoulders. He let his boyfriend guide him as he lowered himself until he felt Harry’s cock pressing against his entrance. He took a deep breath because no matter how much Harry had fingered him, two fingers were nothing in compare to the real thing.
Draco had noticed in the last few days, as Halloween approached, the way Harry had become more detached. How he would space out during a conversation, with a dark expression shadowing his face. How much his appetite had diminished. He knew that the day many people would spend celebrating, he would spend it mourning his parents. He had experienced how dangerous the demons inside one’s head could be, and he did not want Harry to go through that too.
So, the question was, what the hell did Potter get to hide? The only answer Draco could find was that the Saviour was as not as well endowered as he had visioned and therefore embarrassed by his lack of… cock. While the idea of Potter having a micropenis did not make sense with Draco’s fantasies, he was surprised that it did not bother him all that much. Bloody hell, he was even willing to top if it meant to have Potter without clothes, and the thought alone was horrifying as it was. But the more he observed the man, the less he believed in his theory. While Potter did take great care in not showing any more skin than necessary, he also did it with natural nonchalance and peace of mind. He did not seem uncomfortable or scared that someone could have torn his towel away as a joke, like sometimes it happened to their colleagues, and exposed him to the whole room.
Harry took a look around the familiar place with white walls, a wooden floor, various bookshelves, the chairs for the patients and the coffered desk that had seen more action that it was supposed to. He took out his wand and set to work.
As his hands reached for the towel, Draco’s heart drummed in his chest, but his mind was fogged with euphoria and a little bit of madness. The burgundy fabric touched the floor and for a moment, the world stopped. Well, he had been dead wrong. Potter was not small or pierced. No. It was big. More than big actually, huge was the most appropriate term to describe it. And from the look of it, he was not even fully hard. He felt faint.
Invisible to the muggles, they flew over the roof’s houses, leaving the busy London at their backs. As soon as they reached the countryside, they landed back on road, making sure nobody was around to take notice. Again on solid ground, Draco felt the tension in his shoulder mitigate and found himself able to finally open his eyes, that he had not noticed he had closed.
Feeling his skin wrinkling and his eyelids getting heavy, he decided it was time to get out of the tub and take a nap. Wrapped in his bathrobe, he walked back to the bedroom and changed in a pair of joggers that hung low on his hips and one of Harry’s sweaters, which was rather big for his frame. Perfect for when he needed a little bit of comfort and his lover was not around. He lit up the fire in the chimney and then settled under the cover in their big King-size bed. As he laid his head on his soft pillow, fatigue soon prevailed, and before he knew it, he found himself falling into a deep sleep. And, maybe, he dreamed a little bit about Harry. Just enough to make his heart satisfied.
He slipped a hand between their bodies and when he circled Draco’s entrance with his finger, he found it loose and wet. His finger entered without resistance, making his boyfriend shiver underneath. “You’re already loose…” He stated while pushing in a second finger and starting to fuck him. He found immediately Draco’s sweet spot and pressed with intention. Draco screamed and arched his back in a beautiful arch. God, he was gorgeous. His velvety milky skin was flushed pink and his platinum hair were ruffled all over the place. He was the definition of disheveled and looked simply delicious.
He watched, enchanted, as Harry thickened under his touch, licking his lips unconsciously. Draco cupped his heavy balls, tugging a little bit and getting out of him a low moan. With that, Harry’s cock became of steel. Now, with the stiff nine inches length pointing forward, thick and proud, Draco could proceed. After having rubbed the unscented shaving cream at the base of the shaft and on the ball sack, he switched to the razor blade. With the skin pulled tight by his erection, it was easier to shave the delicate place. His movements were slow and precise. Every few sweeps, he cleaned the blades in a bucket filled with water placed at his side.
He started to suck, bobbing his head in a nice rhythm, not too slow and not too fast, so he could get used to Potter size without making a fool of himself or worse, getting hurt.
He slightly got better in the years he had been in a relationship with Draco, starting to wear more fitted clothes and ditching hoodies and jeans as his to-go outfit. Draco said they did nothing for his great physique and, in retrospection, he was right. The only thing his lover seemed to approve of his old wardrobe, was his leather jacket. Not that he would have thrown it away if it was not so. It was Sirius’ and it was one of his most treasured possessions.
“You’re so warm around me… It’s like my dick it’s going to melt.” Breathed Harry, his voice full of wonder and lust. “That would be a real tragedy.” He said with a smirk, clenching his walls against the nine inches of heaven. “If you don’t start to ride me this instant, I’m going to fuck you hard and deep. Until you cry.” Threatened in a poor attempt Harry, which had Draco smile like the devil he was. “While it sounds amazing, that’s not what we’re doing today.”
For a gay man, the men Aurors’ locker room was like a meat market. Or at least that was what Draco liked to think. While the stench of so many sweaty men altogether, especially at the end of a long day of work in the field, was not pleasant in the slightest, he did enjoy the display of muscles and flesh.
“Watch your tongue, professor. What would say Lovegood if she heard you? She would think you were trying to flirt with me.” Gasped Draco in mocking disbelief. Longbottom’s loud laughter filled the castle. “Don’t worry about Luna! If she was here, she would agree with me. Who I should be afraid of, would be Harry. He’s rather the jealous type. At least for you. One time, I saw him throw a wandless and wordless jinx at a man who was eye-fucking you at the Three Broomsticks.” “Really?” He asked surprised. He had never noticed any jealous behaviour from Harry, but maybe he had been too busy ogling at him.
“I was on my way to the Great Hall; I was coming looking for you. When the Room of Requirement appeared on the wall. I thought it was strange, so I got inside. There was a closet in the middle and inside it the costume. I guess the castle knew you were dressed as a vampire and was telling me to come and find you. The time I got out of the room and checked the map, I saw you and followed you here. Which was not easy, since you seemed to wander around completely lost.” Draco huffed feigning indignation at the teasing of his boyfriend.
Harry’s mouth moved to his neck, while a second finger stretched him wider. He moaned as he pressed down on Harry’s fingers, almost fucking himself on them.
It was Harry who broke the comfortable silence between them. Speaking lovingly in his ear, his voice thick with emotion. “You know, usually the only thing on my mind on this day are my parents, but this year was different. I couldn’t stop thinking about you. How guilty I felt for screaming at you. How lonely I was without you. I always feel particularly lonely around this time of the year, but this year was simply unbearable. Not only I missed them, but I also missed you. Next year, I want to bring you with me when I go to visit them. What do you say? Will you meet my parents?”
As Draco smile widened without control, so did Harry’s, whose singing voice strained a little bit, losing a little of tune, but he did not care. Being serenaded first thing in the morning by your very handsome and hot boyfriend was enough to melt his brain in a mush of sappiness and love.
Now it was his turn to be the first. The first to apologise for being insensitive and blind to Harry’s needs. The first to lower all his barriers and remain completely naked with his feelings, vulnerable and helpless. Admitting out loud that he was irrevocably in love with his reckless, brave, kind and selfless Gryffindor.
No need to say, the last two months had been rather hectic. Between their works, the preparation for the engagement party and the party himself, and the reporters that had harassed them for weeks for an exclusive, they had almost no time to just enjoy their new status. It was unfair. Though he had had a good time at their party, surrounded by friends and family, he missed having little dates with Harry. A walk in the park, taking Teddy to somewhere, going to a nice café to taste a new popular cake or tea. Simple things, but that he found to be the most valuable.
