“You know about that?”
Healer. She didn’t seem to think anything of it, however, perching on his bed and smiling her unsettlingly radiant smile at him.
Possibly.
Malfoy was close now, but if he saw Harry watching him, he didn’t show it, just briefly nodding in Harry’s general direction. “Potter.” He’d used Harry’s last name, but it seemed devoid of any emotion: no taunt, no jab, just an acknowledgement of Harry being there, nothing more. And it took Harry by surprise.
“It’s your turn to get the Hangover Potion,” Harry teased, without actually opening his eyes yet. Draco groaned. The monthly get-togethers with their friends - whoever was available joining them - were always soaked in alcohol, which invariably meant they needed Hangover Potion the morning after.
Malfoy was wearing a pair of black jeans that hugged him in all the right places and a sleeveless T-shirt that was so tight he might as well not have been wearing anything at all, the fabric clinging to him like a second skin. As soon as Harry had spotted him he found it was completely impossible to look away.
Or perhaps she had just vigorously shaken her head and Potter had said ‘good’ to that, Draco’s mind grimly provided.
It was nice in a way, supposing a level of amicability that Draco really wanted to believe was still there somehow.
Harry just nodded now, still watching Draco intently. Then he suddenly moved closer and for one breathtaking moment Draco thought Harry was going to touch his face. He didn’t though, touching Draco’s shoulder instead. It was light and fleeting, but it left Draco’s skin tingling violently all the same, even through the layers of clothing.
Harry had probably been staring at Malfoy for too long, however, because Malfoy averted his gaze. “I should get back to bed.”
“I wouldn’t say the other side, I’d say the right side,” Draco now answered Nott’s question.
Nott was older now than when Harry had known him at Hogwarts, of course, but he still had the same weedy build and rather inconspicuous features.
Harry smiled to himself. Draco was good at this, really good. After Hermione had put in a good word - well, quite a lot of good words actually - Draco had been accepted to train under the Head Potioneer at St Mungo’s, only to wind up in the position of First Assistant within an astounding ten months, which meant he usually only brewed the more intricate potions now, the ones the other assistants were not allowed to make, the ones that sometimes needed a whole week to brew so that Draco had to come in on his Saturday off and stir.
“And they’ll be of the same high quality?”
“Well, you don’t have to,” Harry retracted. “You probably have somewhere else to be again today.” Harry didn’t guess as to who Draco could be meeting up with: he was not making that mistake again.
So he up and left, leaving Harry puzzled. Didn’t Draco remember last night? He’d been pretty sloshed after all, so perhaps he didn’t remember and was ashamed of having been that pissed. Or he might have remembered just fine, being ashamed of
Potter at least had the good grace to blush a bit, before answering. “I know. I just wanted Harris to have the book.” Draco must have looked exactly as incredulous as he felt, because Potter added: “If I’d wanted to have a look at your teaching again, I’d have been here earlier.”
want to go to your own flat?” Harry did this searching gaze thing that Draco still had to get used to. It was as if Harry wanted to look straight into Draco’s soul.
to be together that last time - the day before the engagement, when Draco had gotten back from Hogwarts - but it had just happened and Harry had let it, thinking that Draco had known, that he had known that this would be the last time. Because everyone had known.
“Malfoy, are you awake?” Harry asked once he’d made it up the stairs too.
Then, without any further warning, Harry’s hand was softly slipping over the nape of Draco’s neck and Draco heard himself groan quite involuntarily and ever so softly, slightly leaning into the touch at the same time.
And besides Harry’s prowess being very helpful in their current situation, Draco had to admit it was also utterly attractive.
It took Draco some time to ponder what struck him most about that sentence, finally deciding on the ‘we’ part. Potter seemed quite serious about that, though, because the tray held two plates, one of which he gave to Draco.
sorry and it made Harry itch a bit: he hadn’t even thought to ask whether there was anyone who needed to be notified when Malfoy had been taken in. But well, Malfoy hadn’t told him either.
kind of people.”
“Oh,” Harry just said, painfully reminded that that would probably have been the time that he wouldn’t even have as much as glanced at Draco’s letter. He couldn’t even remember ever having gotten it.
It was only then, when they’d put some distance between them, that Harry realised just how hungry he was.
Malfoy just nodded.
Terry Boot was loitering by the door to Robards’ office when Harry and Malfoy got there.
Harry woke up with a start, panting and sweating: he knew he’d had a nightmare again, the images still close. It had been about an Animagus this time, a white tiger that Harry had had to find. And he
The boy saw Harry’s Glamour drop and then there was just surprise. “But, you’re Harry Potter,” he all but yelled.
“Kendrick.” Zabini’s whisper wasn’t loud per se, but clear all the same.
“You could go to the canteen for lunch, you know. There’s no need to come all the way down here,” Draco started, after they’d eaten. He was quite sure this couldn’t last: Potter wouldn’t keep coming to his office to push a baguette his way forever. It wasn’t a new thought, but this time Draco’d decided to say it, to Potter, out loud.
Malfoy looked a bit taken aback by the question. “I didn’t think-. You’re probably in a hurry, so I just assumed-.”
Fuck.
. That was his job after all.
“But he didn’t,” Blaise simply stated.
“It was okay, really. You probably wouldn’t have known where to look for it anyway.” Draco said gently. “I-, I tried to find another one after that, but I-, I failed.” There was a thickness to his voice that made Harry watch him closely again. Draco was leaning his head against the wall behind him, a few silent tears running down his cheeks that spoke of a loneliness and pain that Harry knew he would never put into words. “There are spells for this," Draco finished, waving his hand at the stars around them, "but it’s-, it’s not the same.”
Draco made to sit upright, still looking slightly dazed as if he hadn’t been able to pull himself out of his dreams completely yet, but definitely more lively than Harry had seen him since the curse had hit.
“No.” Harry shook his head vehemently, because otherwise he would have to -: “No, I don’t dance.”
Of course he had known Potter would be here: Astoria was marrying Seamus Finnigan, for fuck’s sake, who, quite predictably, had invited every damn Gryffindor in his year in Hogwarts, plus some.
And again, Draco actually knew that gaze, most of it anyway, the hungry bit, the bit he’d seen with so many men before. He just didn’t know what to do with the other part of what he saw: the softness that was also there.
partner, provided they’d both qualify for the Division that was.
?” There were so many things that started to click into place now. How Draco wouldn’t have been able to Apparate for one. He couldn’t have gone to St Mungo’s even if he’d wanted to the day before yesterday, when he’d been cursed, when he’d ended up on Harry’s doorstep. He’d certainly been in no shape to walk all the way.
Malfoy smiled a little. “I mean exactly like by a Fidelius Charm. I’m its Keeper and as you remember I’ve told you where we were going just before we got there.”
He didn’t add that that was probably for the best, since he was hardly eligible, considering the side he’d been on throughout the war.
Then Potter smiled that nice smile of his again. “I wasn’t sure you actually would.”
“Yes. Yes, I do.” Draco still didn’t exactly know whether that was a good thing necessarily, but they
apparently.”
That it was dangerous in a way that no ward could ever be.
So, the stairs it was, then. By the time Harry had resigned himself to having to walk up to the twelfth floor, Malfoy had already darted up to the first. “Do keep up.”
The protective shield Draco put up was absolutely impressive, even by his own standards - deflecting whatever Mathew had cast - but the problem was that it couldn’t protect Harry as well: he was too far off.
Smith did the sensible thing and left.
Was it, because …: “Malfoy, I shouldn’t have come into your room. I just-”
Blaise watched him. “Well, he won’t be able to ignore it completely, because it’s not an owl: he won’t be able to shoo it away without even opening the parchment.”
“No, I’d rather come back for it,” Harry answered quickly, finding he actually meant it, somehow following it up with a question that made it out of his mouth unfiltered. “I erm, I actually was going to grab some lunch just now. Do you want to come?”
“You can actually keep standing there?” Draco’s voice, barely audible, sounded incredulous, in awe.
Then Harry watched Zabini, who was still fighting off assailant number two, but who didn’t really seem to need any help. Zabini bent backward impossibly low to evade a spell fired his way, while at the same time sending a spell towards his attacker full on.
“Of course. When Ron and Hermione just moved into their house I waited for their bath to arrive for ages.” Draco felt his face mimic the complex array of feelings that swept through him.
Harry should probably have turned back then and there.
lost, where he might have been a tad disgruntled, clearing the board of its remaining pieces in one swipe and probably with slightly more force than the situation had warranted).
That solved itself.
“Yes well, let’s just say we own property in France,” Draco answered, not wanting to explain more elaborately. Because of this property Draco’s parents had thought it necessary for him to not just
“Yes, they said I live in a Muggle area.”
Draco felt so happy he could easily have cast a Patronus without accessing a memory at all.
Of course it did.
should have stayed in bed.
But it hadn’t hit Nott, unfortunately.
Draco nodded. “More or less.”  He hadn’t told Harry about the practice runs he’d had to find the right recipe.
And Draco felt happy, happy that he’d made that choice, that he’d given into Harry that day over a year ago now. That he’d taken a chance on them. On Harry.
“Draco’s only just left,” ‘Harry’s‘ Healer said, smiling at him a little as if she knew exactly why Harry was looking for him.
“Draco, it’s okay. Don’t talk. Just-. I’m going to take you to your room. Okay?” Harry’s voice sounded reassuring and warm as he said it, which to his own surprise was exactly how he’d meant it.
friends. It made Harry happy and proud, proud of his friends who had accepted Draco with minimal fuss, their reactions ranging from Hermione’s ‘Harry, you do realise you’ve been obsessed with Draco since sixth year, don’t you?’ and Luna’s ‘Draco’s quite sweet, really. I think you two make a really lovely couple.’ to Ron’s ‘Don’t ask me to like the git yet, but if he makes you happy, that’s enough for me.’
Draco recognised Ron Weasley straight away, of course. He was brought in by his brother and his arm was completely limp, signs of massive burns all over it.
Draco nodded. Monday. Yes.
“Hey, you’re awake.” It wasn’t a question, although Draco hadn’t actually turned around to look at Harry.
Draco had braced himself. He knew what most people thought of him and his family, his blond hair rather conspicuously screaming ‘Malfoy’ even if he didn’t want it to, but he had decided that if he was going to try and make this job work, he wouldn’t let that define him.
Malfoy himself was dressed in a pair of expensive looking, black trousers that he needed to take in a bit at the waist, a beautifully crisp, white shirt - sleeves rolled up to the elbows again - and a grey waistcoat with black pinstripes that brought out the colour of his eyes. It was the first time Malfoy had looked like that since he’d been in Harry’s house - apart perhaps from that first day when he’d come from Blaise’s club - and Harry found himself staring entirely against his will.
In reality he plonked down on the curb instead, right next to Malfoy, who immediately stopped watching Harry in favour of the street in front of them.
hard not to stare at. At least if you were Harry apparently.
Next Malfoy transfigured the rug into a neat mattress - piling it with the bedding and pillows that Harry provided him with - after which he started to undress himself in silence, his back pointedly towards Harry. Harry decided to do the same, changing into his pyjama’s quickly, only then realising that Malfoy obviously wouldn’t have anything to wear for the night.
Then Malfoy got up, levitating the black, wooden box from a shelf behind him to his desk. “But I hardly think you’re here to talk about my lunchtime habits, so let’s have a look at this here.” Malfoy paused, just a moment, then continued: “It’s a Constellation Box.” He smiled a little at Harry’s undoubtedly confused face. “And you probably don’t know what that is. Well, I can assure you: most people don’t. As I mentioned, these boxes are exceedingly rare.”
Harry could see the exact moment that he did, though, for Draco sat up straight in one movement, obviously regretting it immediately and putting his hand to his, undoubtedly also pounding, head.
need to leave for work soon, Malfoy wasn’t there. He’d apparently been there, though, because there was a full fry up under a Stasis Charm on Harry’s kitchen table, but Malfoy himself was conspicuously absent.
Eventually he had to, though. He had to work the afternoon shift after all, so he towelled himself off, slinging the towel on his hips afterwards.
Sometimes Harry felt so tired of being him.
It would spare them the awkward conversation about breakfast, the one that Draco wasn’t prepared to have, really. Harry would not want him to stay – Draco’d undoubtedly overstayed his welcome quite enough already - but Harry would offer him breakfast anyway, because he was a Gryffindor and altogether nice and Draco would stay, because he couldn’t actually do anything else when it came to Harry.
Okay, so perhaps Harry wouldn’t come. It was almost nine o’clock now and still no sign of Harry whatsoever. Draco felt worried all of a sudden: perhaps something was wrong, perhaps that was why he wasn’t here yet.
“Hermione, I haven’t … .”
Draco had spent some time looking for accessories, but he hadn’t managed to find anything to his taste. So he’d left for his still empty flat.
Draco shrugged. “I didn’t think you’d be bi, either, so I suppose we should just conclude that neither of us seems to be very good at assessing that sort of thing,” he smirked.
So Draco just clenched his jaw and bit back a retort, at the same time that Harry got up from his chair, all strength and confidence, gazing at Smith in a way that clearly didn’t bode well. Draco couldn’t look away from him, feeling Harry’s magic almost tangibly curl around him, pinning him in place. It was electrifying and Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen anything or anyone this attractive any time before. Harry was absolutely gorgeous.
“Yes, I’ve noticed,” Malfoy deadpanned, adding: “I needed to ward it, before I let you come in. It’s a rather vicious piece.”
taking him into custody at this point.”
Harry noticed the suitcase was wizarding and could probably easily have taken the contents of the whole room.
Harry really, really couldn’t wait for Ron to come back.
This obviously being lunchtime, The Leaky was crowded and Draco didn’t think they stood any chance of getting in, but Harry pushed through all the same.
“So you worked in France all this time?” Harry asked next. Draco nodded, thankful for the change of subject. “Why did you come back? For Astoria?”
“Dinner’s almost done,” Harry changed the subject. “Could you lay the table?”
Harry smiled, still not completely awake, his green eyes were so soft it almost hurt. “You know you didn’t have to,” he said, pulling Draco down towards him, “’M just really glad you’re here.”
Harry knew he should leave it at that, he very much should.
“You don’t want me to?” Harry finally decided to ask.
Why hadn’t Harry been able to protect himself? He could cast a Patronus in his sleep. Draco suspected he could even do it wandlessly. Why hadn’t he done so? Why had he been taken out?
Right, so this apparently was the kind of Dittany you needed to
Harry was, though, going to retrieve the object straight away.
Malfoy’s face showed a sense of relief that was almost disconcerting. It was swift, gone within the second, but Harry was sure he’d seen it, though.
“Hey,” Potter said, looking up, when Draco walked into his office. His door had been wide open - Draco hadn’t even had to knock - and Potter was smiling that slightly tentative thing again. Draco found it kept unsettling him, because every time he saw it, he thought it would be the last.
“Goodnight, Potter.”
When a door did open shortly after, Harry knew it wasn’t Draco’s, because he could still feel the solid wood of that door against his back.
It had probably helped that he had apologised to most of them. And meant it.
It had gone nine in the evening already and Draco had never been this late.
“You mean more like eight or nine in the evening, instead of one in the morning,” Harry laughed, obviously knowing more about Draco than Draco should be comfortable with.
“And you brought a friend,” the girl said next, seemingly having spotted Harry, who was standing in the doorway, only now. Then she saw the suitcase. “Are you going on holiday?”
Draco spent the rest of the afternoon waiting.
Harry didn’t answer. He just leant in, kissing Draco swiftly but softly. Then he got up and stuck out his hand for Draco to take, pulling him to his feet too.
Furthermore: I’d like to thank all of the people who’ve been cheering (especially) Draco on. I really liked reading your comments (and he definitely needed them😊).
Hooded and black.
Because he knew that whatever Harry had been thinking just now, it couldn’t possibly  have  been
It had left Draco both completely happy and profoundly unsettled.
When Harry came in, Malfoy was on the sofa in their shared living space, getting up the moment he saw Harry.
Harry had never actually given any thought as to what that would be like at all.
“Thank you.” She still didn’t quite look him in the eye and Harry supposed it probably had something to do with his name again. Sometimes that really was quite annoying.
a room.
Now wasn’t the time to go into that, however, as Francois produced some parchment, that obviously required Harry’s attention. Harry noticed Francois’ movements were easy and sure, which probably made sense, in his line of business and all. “This will be your identity. Learn it by heart and be sure to be this person any time we meet, both in looks and in actions.” There was the arrogance again, but it wasn’t menacing.
So before he could really think about it, Harry went to Malfoy’s room, easing the door open as softly as he could possibly manage. He half expected Malfoy to be awake and extremely annoyed, so it was probably just self-preservation that made him move inside as quietly as he could.
Once he’d noticed, it took him shockingly little time to do so, meticulously casting diagnostics afterwards, just as he’d been taught to.
At least his protective shield proved enough for Harry not to freeze completely, but he felt his movements slow down, as if he was moving through water, then mud. He also felt Draco by his side now, steadying him a bit, while casting with his other hand.
“What?” he asked absentmindedly, getting up, feeling his face drain of all colour. “No, sorry, you don’t have to-,” he said, stopping Hermione from explaining everything all over again, “I-, I should leave.”
There was a barely veiled hunger in Harry’s eyes that Draco wouldn’t have been able to resist even if he’d tried to. Which he didn’t. Because he wanted this, wanted it so badly he could almost taste it, so badly that every step he had to take was one too many.
“It’s Blaise’s, isn’t it?” Harry found Malfoy standing next to him.
He was right, though. Harry had never been particularly good at any of those spells.
At least Luna had been completely upfront about
When Harry finally got to the kitchen, he knew he’d have to go for his toast and tea routine again.
It obviously caught Nott’s attention, his men standing down for the moment.
“Don’t you want to go, too?” Draco asked Harry, once he’d sat down on the grass next to him, close enough to catch a whiff of Harry’s scent: warm and woodsy and by now comfortably familiar.
Harry shook his head. He
gave him the name of that club and that
“Yes, I think you’re right.” Draco said, contemplating. They didn’t feel like normal wards.
Malfoy turned his head to watch him, lazily tucking a stray strand of hair away as he did so. His hair was longer than when Harry had last seen him. It suited him. “What are you going to say to your friends?” he asked. He seemed genuinely curious, his voice somewhere between a drawl and a slur. “Hey, I was just outside sitting with Malfoy for a while?”
“No, I don’t have a partner,” Draco answered firmly, adding rather pointedly, because he knew exactly where this was going, ”and certainly no
“Well, Potter, here we are again,” Malfoy said, voice low. Malfoy’d probably already been somewhere else this evening, because Harry could easily smell the alcohol on his breath.  Plus Malfoy was late of course. “So, how do you want to play it tonight?” Malfoy asked, seductive purr in place. He was close, effectively pinning Harry against the wall behind him. “Dance? Or shall we skip that altogether?”
“So, you actually do have wings.” Harry now said. Penelope had just left and they were alone in Harry’s house again. Harry reached out to touch Draco’s back.
Harry saw how Draco had hunched in on himself now, his body shaking violently and Harry closed his eyes, forcing his gaze away, focussing on Zabini instead.
Oh, that-, actually made sense. “Before you started working for Zabini.” Harry suddenly understood.
At first he was slightly alarmed, but the wards let whoever it was in without a hitch, which could only mean one thing: Malfoy had just got back.
“Sorry, visitors are not allowed to Apparate in here.” Draco didn’t sound sorry, not even remotely.
“Well, it’s most likely they won’t develop any further. We think you’ve completed the transition by now, so you probably won’t develop full-grown wings,” Luna seemed to regret that. “But after your birthday we will know for sure. They might still change,” she sounded much more cheerful at that prospect. “The humps will almost certainly recede again, though, so you won’t have them all the time. They’ll just be there when a Veela would have used its wings. So when you’re angry, provoked, protective.”
Harry just nodded like he understood.
So, as far as Harry was concerned, the whole thing had been over when Draco’d left for Hogwarts. They’d had their fun, Harry had known for sure that he was bi and that, to him, had been the end to the benefits part.
He rose from where he’d just sat himself down before she’d even asked, just shooting his eyebrows up in question.
“Draco!” Draco, still casting at the incoming guards, heard and shifted position, turning his broom swiftly, enough not to get hit, but not enough to get his broom completely out of harm’s way however: it splintered out of the air.
“I’ve set up a meeting with our head, so you can show us what you can deliver.”
“Malfoy.” Potter’s voice sounded shocked, if anything, and Draco couldn’t help but look at him, desperately trying not to flinch at the pain.
“So you usually eat with Nurie and her family?”
“Well, we’ve had breakfast,” Harry started to say pointedly, after they’d eaten, adding, when Draco didn’t respond immediately: “I think I heard you talk about presents.”
Harry was just glad he had been with him this time. Which reminded him, though: “What were you trying to do? You know, the fire and the log and trying to get me out?” Harry still felt quite indignant just thinking about that.
“Should it?” Malfoy just said, his tone somewhere between icy cold and, well, sad, tired.
“Draco, what are you doing?” Potter’s voice sounded completely astonished. And he had called him Draco. He’d called him
If he’d ever
“Yeah, of course,” Potter said, adding: “Erm, on Friday nights we usually meet up with some people at The Leaky. Want to come? Blaise is there regularly, too, you know. So you won’t be the only Slytherin.” And then Potter smiled, he smiled as if being the only Slytherin would actually worry Draco, as if that would keep him from coming.
The witness they were supposed to extract was sitting in the middle of the room, her eyes closed and around her chair, in a circle, there was conspicuous white powder. Draco recognised it as a protective ring straight away and Harry apparently did so too, not proceeding to go in, but watching Draco instead. This was obviously the curse breaking part of the test.
Was it that late already?
Potter wasn’t there, of course. Draco really was ridiculously early, the club not packed with people yet. And Draco decided that was a good thing: he would be able to dance and talk to people, perhaps even pull, before Potter would even get here.
He made a stop at the reception desk to make sure an extra bed would be placed in Weasley’s room, then he made to leave.
Again it made sense.
Draco was nervous when he felt the tug on his wards and he got to his front door in a moment, but forced himself not to open it too quickly.
It had been an absolute relief: Lisa didn’t comment on Malfoy being in Harry’s house at all and at first Harry’d thought she might not know, but then they’d been talking about the potions thefts and she had broached the subject. She hadn’t said anything demeaning about Malfoy, however, just stating that she was glad that maybe Malfoy would be able to shed some light on the case when he’d retrieved his memory, because the whole thing still didn’t seem to be going anywhere without it.
“So you did.” Draco smiled, straightening to his full height. “Just let me change first.”
Harry thought he looked utterly adorable.
“So I heard Granger and Weasley finally got married. Was it nice? The wedding? You know, seeing everyone again?” For a moment Harry felt completely off-kilter. Malfoy asking after Ron and Hermione’s wedding was, well, strange. So he didn’t answer, which apparently made Malfoy want to explain. “It usually helps me to think about something else, you know, after I’ve had a nightmare. So I thought you might-.” He stopped, his voice having gone uncharacteristically quiet.
He was quite sure this
The first time Harry saw him again it took him completely by surprise. Yet, there he was: Draco Malfoy. In a Muggle club. Harry couldn’t help but stare, because, well …, Draco Malfoy in a
When Harry started his lesson somewhat later, he found he was feeling slightly off, though.
“It’s not the same constellation.” Harry concluded softly, when all the stars had settled in place.
“Yes, I do.” Potter paused briefly. “Now, anyway. Ron taught me.” His voice had changed from almost indignant to something a lot softer, less sure.
Draco had to take a moment to cope with the effect those words had, a warmth spreading through him in waves: Harry really
Harry smiled again, broadly this time and Draco loved every bit of it.
Potter seemed slightly on edge. He’d probably blurted the first thing that came to mind when he’d seen Draco, already regretting having asked. “No, thank you,” Draco answered. It had taken him some time to find his voice, but he knew he’d been able to keep his face carefully blank. Potter still seemed a bit tense, though.
So Harry got up and plonked unceremoniously down on the bed next to Draco, holding on to his courage while he still had it. “I don’t regret it,” Harry stated with all the certainty he felt. “Kissing you,” he added, just to be sure.
Draco’s Saturday had passed as uneventfully as it usually did. He’d been sleeping in to start with, because he unquestionably disliked getting up early and as it was, there was quite enough of that throughout the workweek already.
Draco sighed. “Just get on with it.”
Penelope sighed. “Yes quite, there were so many loose threads, so many things that didn’t sit right after … . And we needed to follow up on all of them, to find out whether he had done anything like this before.” She was silent for a moment, then added, more quietly: “I should never have left you to deal with those wards on your own.” She was clearly addressing Draco now.
Early morning light was seeping through the curtains when Draco woke up again. Well, ‘woke up’ probably didn’t exactly cover it. His head hurt like hell and opening his eyes was a whole jolly challenge in and of itself.
Then just the swirl and crack of Apparition.
“I heard you’re training to be an Auror.” Draco’d actually read it in
“I do understand why you’d want your father out,” Harry now said quietly and quite without warning. He didn’t specify out of what, but that part was obvious.
Charlie and Draco both noticed who it was at exactly the same time.
, before smiling at Harry professionally. They had been having regular meetings for the last three weeks, but nothing much had come of it yet.
Eventually he saw Hermione still kind of dancing, but mainly just watching Luna doing something intricate and weirdly beautiful. Ron wasn’t with them anymore.
Somehow it apparently mattered that Malfoy wouldn’t feel guilty about getting downstairs this late.
Draco shrugged and from the almost embarrassed look he shot Zabini, Harry gathered this probably wasn’t the first time he’d pulled a stunt like that, throwing himself into a situation he wasn’t technically supposed to get into.
“So how would you go about dismantling this construction?” Penelope asked. She’d apparently come down too and was watching the objects with the rest of them.
?” Potter’s voice sounded angry and incredulous.
It effectively rendered Draco completely incapable of any conscious thought.
And just like that Harry asked: “Do you know-? Was he abused, there, in Azkaban?”
So Draco nonchalantly threw his robes over the back of his chair and gave Harry a smile that was much gentler than he had wanted it to be in current company. Then Draco leant in to kiss him, just a peck, soft and fleeting, adding: “Want to leave with me tonight?”
“Yes,” he wasn’t going to tell her that strictly speaking he’d been off for a few hours already, “but if you would like me to stay, I can,” he heard himself say.
Fuck.
Someone was yelling at the top of their lungs and it wasn’t a particularly joyous sound.
So Draco wasn’t offended by Harry’s evasive manoeuvre, knowing exactly what it meant. And how flattering it actually was.
“You don’t suppose we’re sleeping in there together?” The disdain in Malfoy’s voice was very obvious indeed. It was clear he didn’t much care for sharing a bed either. Harry briefly considered saying that, yes, he did actually have that in mind, just to spite Malfoy, but in the end he refrained.
Harry didn’t say anything, didn’t know how to, but Draco did: “It-, well, it wasn’t your fault, really. I was on the verge of casting something much worse.” Draco was silent for a moment before adding: “Sometimes I wish it
Draco nodded quietly, silently speaking of things he didn’t say, things Harry could only imagine.
Draco felt his legs give way just before everything went completely black.
That had been a mistake, though. Why hadn’t he done the sodding charm work at home! Because there he was: Harry Potter, very much awake and sort of staring at him. Draco almost felt compelled to tell Harry he was sorry for still being there, because he was, but for some reason the apology didn’t quite make it out of his mouth, though.
Of course Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy for the rest of the week, but as soon as Friday lunchtime rolled around Harry found himself actively looking for him. Malfoy hadn’t come into Training early, like last week, though. And although Harry hadn’t really made up his mind as to what course to take yet, when he placed his order in the canteen, he found himself ordering two baguettes. To go.
“I didn’t know whether you’d believe-. And I did have to get my clothes, anyway, so I thought-.” Malfoy went heavy on the drawling, but this time Harry had the distinct impression he was making an attempt at hiding something else entirely.
“Draco, you’re here.” A beautiful, teenage girl, with golden skin and lush black hair smiled at Malfoy. “Mum said you weren’t in, but you didn’t forget.”
That actually made Harry laugh. “Seriously? You can do potions. If you can get those right, I think cooking food shouldn’t be a problem. The recipes essentially work the same way actually.”
That moment, however regrettably, was when his body made a decision of its own accord, determining it had had quite enough of standing up: Draco’s legs, very much without his permission, gave way.
“Is there something else we need to discuss? Because if there isn’t, I think I should leave. Malfoy needs to go to some charity thing this evening and I can’t risk being late. I think he would probably hex me into oblivion if I was.”
When Harry heard his alarm go off the next day, he felt grateful, more than anything: he’d slept even worse than he usually did. No nightmares, though, just waking up much too often for comfort, idly watching the dark before being able to fall asleep again.
He didn’t hear anything on the other side of the door and although that could also be due to a Silencing Charm, Harry didn’t take it as a good sign.
tired.
“Fuck, it’s -, I promised George and Ron I’d help try some things from the new shipment of stuff that came in today. I should get to the shop. I’m already running late.” He looked startled and sort of guilty at the same time.
“You-, you don’t have a Floo?  But you’re a -.” Harry had wanted to say something like
“Only if you give me one more chance at beating you in chess.”
A whole constellation actually built around them, here, in Malfoy’s office. It was bewildering and completely and utterly captivating all at once.
didn’t feel like staying anymore. “No, in fact, I think I should be going. There’s a briefing I need to attend first thing tomorrow morning.”
And it was then that Harry remembered.
Harry felt an alarming need to touch him. Which he valiantly ignored, though, knowing it would probably startle Malfoy away. “Yeah,” Harry just said instead, “it should.”
The rest of the afternoon was spent reading the casefile on their assigned case. They would be clearing a house that had been a safehouse for a group of Death Eaters.
“Okay, it’s not very good, no,” Harry said and when he looked up at Malfoy, Malfoy’s face was doing a whole array of expressions in fast succession that Harry didn’t even try to understand. Eventually his face evened out.
Draco had another Firewhiskey, while watching them dance.
“I’m David, David Goodwin, and they have my sister,” the boy simply stated.
He tried to put it aside.
He couldn’t even finish his sentence, though, because Draco cut him off: “Well, you two seem to get along just fine. Much better than just friends, I‘d say.” He would never dream of holding Astoria the way Potter had held Ginny Weasley this evening. “Are you sure you’re divorced, because you still looked very much the couple to me.”
bitter.” His eyes held a hint of defiance that Harry didn’t quite get.
And a big thank you to my Beta, of course!
actually
“So you really must know something important, something that is incriminating enough for those thieves to lash out,” Lisa concluded, her eyes on Draco again.
Harry shook his head silently.
Sometimes it was better to stop things before someone else did, bringing the all too familiar pain of rejection in its wake.
Harry was on the floor, unmoving, seemingly hit by a spell, but still keeping the Time-Turner close, which of course was exactly what the stupid git would do: keeping this thing safe, even if he wasn’t able to protect himself.
to see him, had been looking for him.
Then he’d decided on the way he would lay the table and when exactly he was going to do what, so that when Harry came he could give him his full attention.
“It’s okay.” Malfoy’s voice was still gravelly from sleep, but soothing, too, like it had been the last time Harry’d had a nightmare. “It’s just a dream.” His touch was there as well, his hand lightly on Harry’s shoulder.
“Okay, but we’ll have to be quick. I really do have a major assignment I need to finish today.”
Draco looked around, but there was fire everywhere, an unbreachable wall of flames and thick smoke, no way of escaping it.
“No offence, Zabini, but no,” Harry smiled.
Blaise just smiled. “Not ready to bet on that really. Anyway, let’s eat. I haven’t brought all of this food over just to ignore it.”
Before Harry’s engagement had made it into the newspapers the next day.
Malfoy hesitated just a beat before answering: “No, I first had a room somewhere else.” He averted his gaze and Harry realised that, however curious this answer made him, Malfoy was not going to tell him more.
Somehow something seemed to have irrevocably changed between them since yesterday, since the Sunday morning they had shared, and Draco knew they’d both felt it. It was almost like there was an invisible force around them when they talked, an energy, sparking and sizzling, that was there even though they both tried to ignore it.
“Potter,” Malfoy stated, looking up, “have a seat.”
“Potter. You’ve arrived.” It most definitely was his usual drawl, but his jawline clenched and his eyes closed briefly, then he looked up again, watching Harry. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here to welcome you, but I trust Madeleine has told you all you need to know.”
Wood had been playing as a professional Quidditch player in America for the last five years, but now he would be back on British soil, reunited with Puddlemere, his first professional team. He wasn’t going to be a player there anymore, though, but their coach instead, expected to catapult them back into first place in no time.
Draco would have to leave soon.
“We have to get out of here.” When Draco spoke up again it was with quiet determination. “I have called for backup through the bracelet, but it could take them hours to get here, especially given the protection around these grounds. I don’t think we’ll be able to sit that out here. They’ll probably breach the door long before that.”
“Yup, Draco will have lunch here,” he answered the old house elf.
“Good morning,” Malfoy greeted Harry. He was quite obviously already in Harry’s kitchen and Harry couldn’t help but be a bit startled at first. Malfoy had been elegantly leaning against the countertop as if he belonged there - even though he was just wearing pyjamas that looked much too loose on his slim frame and his feet were bare - but now he pealed himself off, taking a plate so full of food that some of the toast was actually precariously balancing on top, and offering it to Harry.
serious about this.
“I’ll keep watch. I suppose
Draco proceeded to undress, folding his clothes and leaving them on a chair in his bedroom after which he went into his new bathroom again, the underfloor heating comfortably warm under his feet. He walked straight into the shower cubicle, starting the spray of its enormous rain shower, so that soon water was running hot and soothing over his body, making his muscles relax instantly.
And he was smiling.
When they were gone, Draco turned around, only then realising he hadn’t seen Harry cast his Patronus. It became clear why as soon as Draco had turned and looked behind him.
Perhaps Draco really was ill. It was something that had crossed Harry’s mind before of course, but he actually didn’t believe it himself. Not really.
“Have you been checked, physically I mean?” Harry now asked and there was a worried tone to his voice. Harry had apparently picked up on something, even through Draco’s efforts not to show.
It was that evening, just after dinner, that the next Ministry owl found them. Again it sort of flew into the window head on, but this time that seemed to be, because it was carrying a cube that was slightly too heavy for its frame.
him? In
“Well, I think that would make for the perfect opportunity to celebrate,” Malfoy added. Harry shot him a quizzical look, not quite sure what they should be celebrating and Malfoy seemed to get that, a glint of humour in his eyes while explaining: “You know, that we haven’t hexed each other yet.”
“So, still here, I see.” Smith was standing a few feet away, spitting his vitriol. Draco looked up at him slowly, feeling bone-tired all of a sudden. “And Harry’s still your bodyguard. What happened? Can’t poor Malfoy take care of himself?” For that last sentence Smith had used a voice that sounded so much like Moaning Myrtle it almost made Draco laugh. He stifled it straight away, though. Smith actually
Zabini. Draco had come here with Harry and Harry had decided that meant he could stare all he wanted.
Not really.
So Draco started casting.
It had been a few days and Draco hadn’t heard from Harry at all anymore. He knew it was only to be expected: he was hardly Harry’s friend, Harry had just taken pity on Draco’s kitchen-less existence and cooked for him, that was all.
intended to be there, but he just needed all his strength to actually get up, exhaustion and that bloody pain clawing him down the moment he tried to stand.
“I don’t think we’ll be able to just Apparate out, either,” Harry said flatly. Zabini shook his head.
“I think we’ve actually done rather well so far,” Harry answered. “We haven’t even hexed each other yet.” He smiled and it came out absolutely genuine.
Harry, standing to his side to be able to reach his wings, glanced at him, hooded, pupils wide. Then he pulled Draco in, flush together, one hand still lightly touching Draco’s wing from over his shoulder.
Harry concluded it was too late to think about that at this moment, so he didn’t, instead just opting to turn the television off and go to bed.
It was a glance Draco felt emboldened by, planting his hands on Potter’s hips more firmly now, guiding him to move along with him, along to the music. And Potter let him. It felt deceptively like trust.
Draco gave him a slightly bemused smile: “Who said anything about
It felt like resisting
He looked like someone who genuinely wanted to take revenge, whatever the consequences to himself might be.
Harry didn’t know
could be more, that they could be real. Some day.
Then Harry heard the wards react to someone at the door. It obviously couldn’t be breakfast anymore, so Harry went to the door as stealthily as he could. When he peered out into the corridor, he saw it was Blaise Zabini, though, conspicuously leaning against the wall opposite their door, easy to spot.
Malfoy nodded almost imperceptibly. “Sometimes.”
It was a very strange realisation to have in the early morning with a horrible headache and Draco still sleeping peacefully beside him. Okay, Harry had known he had started to like Draco better of late, but going from that to this definite, obvious, physical attraction. Well, it was something that would likely take some getting used to.
“I’ve already had lunch in my office in Curse-Breaking, but there’s a small pile of correction work I’d like to finish before class, which is why I’m early today,” Draco added, offering an explanation.
Potter watched him, his eyes trained on Draco’s for a moment too long and Draco just hoped he wouldn’t see the signs that Blaise definitely would have picked up on. Because Potter would want to know-.
can’t crack this thing, no one can.” And what’s more, Harry seemed to mean it.
But now they actually seemed to have found something worthwhile, judging by the tone of Harry’s voice.
Narcissa had been quite well when Harry had seen her, so she must have been treated.
him, that he could take care of himself. “You should just look the part when you’re with me and get on with your other job when you’re not.”
And then the club had happened, but Draco had always lived by the rule that he didn’t refer to anything that had happened at the club throughout the rest of the week. And fortune had apparently smiled upon Draco for this once, because that seemingly also was how Potter dealt with it.
“There you are. Finally.” Harry greeted Draco  “Well, I can now officially tell you that your kitchen actually works.”
Hermione just nodded, though, producing an empty vial, which in her line of business would probably be pretty standard for her to carry.
“Well, yes, but also just because you’re you. You’ve actually changed quite a lot.”
More than anything his feelings for Harry were like an itch, something Draco rather desperately wanted to scratch although he knew it wouldn’t solve anything, that it would only make things worse.
Harry moved closer, his Auror training the only reason he kept going slow enough not to be heard.
Malfoy considered him for a brief moment, before answering, rather slowly: “Yeees, that’s what bodyguards usually do.” Here Harry wanted to object, but Malfoy didn’t let him: “And before you mention it: yes, I know you’re supposed to do your other job while being my bodyguard, but you will actually have to accompany me
“He has changed, don’t you think?” she said in her dreamy voice, still close to his ear.
Apparently this was not an evening for disclosures.
“Yes, Potter, I’m taking those down.” He sounded every bit as Malfoy-ish as he used to, but there was something else there too, sounding suspiciously like amusement. “But as I suppose you haven’t come here to fill me in on that particular tad of information, there must be another reason for your visit?”
“Sulking on your own.” Astoria’s words, absolutely not phrased as a question, were accompanied by a soft touch on his upper arm. Draco realised he’d become used to her touch: it had been a constant over the past fourteen years, always just there when he’d needed it.
Harry got out of bed softly - no need to wake Malfoy yet – before he realised Malfoy wasn’t actually sleeping in his room anymore: Harry had given him the guest room just across the hall, the cube thing they’d gotten last night ensuring that Malfoy wouldn’t escape.
When his lips finally crashed into Harry’s - needing, claiming - he didn’t even ask what Harry wanted, but just moved them to a dark corner, apparating them out on the spot.
“What do you mean?” There was a tinge of hostility to Malfoy’s tone that hadn’t been there before. For a moment it sounded like he was going to say more, but he seemed to think the better of it.
Which for all intents and purposes seemed to be taking close to forever.
Harry smiled at him in a way that was much too telling. “It’s quite clear what’s on
Harry shrugged. Okay, so Malfoy didn’t really seem to understand why Harry was here, bringing him lunch. Which wasn’t all too strange, because honestly, Harry had some difficulties coming up with a reason too. “I just supposed you might like a baguette and since you probably wouldn’t have time to go to the canteen and I was heading there anyway, well …,” he inadequately started to explain.
Draco should count himself lucky it had lasted as long as it had, really, that Astoria had been willing to be with him this long.
Harry’s spell was meant to bind the two intruders, of course, but instead of normal ropes, cables the size of full-grown Boa Constrictors sprang out, binding the men quickly and unrelentingly.
Draco usually flushed a bit when he won, being pleased, but not rubbing it in, like he probably would have done years earlier. Instead he just flushed and smiled genuinely in a way that Harry could easily have watched for hours.
Malfoy gave him a swift once over and for some reason Harry thought he wasn’t going to answer. Until he did, anyway: “Yes, sometimes. Not at this particular moment, though, in case you’re wondering.” There was that playful tone again, and for some reason Harry noticed he’d been waiting for it, wanting it to reappear, but not thinking it actually would anymore. It made the sting of disappointment Harry felt at Malfoy’s words, at their implication, bearable. Because there actually
So Harry set to work: making tea and toast, of course, but also fried eggs, bacon and sausages. He even salvaged a tin of baked beans from his pantry: he’d never cared much for those himself, but Malfoy might. He knew Ginny had loved them.
He was a mere boy, certainly no more than twenty years of age, but his face was set in determined anger.
, of course Harry would be on a first-name basis with the Minister of Magic himself. "Tomorrow around seven I’ll pick you up for dinner, though. Nothing too fancy and definitely Muggle. That okay?” Harry continued.
Draco cast diagnostics, but all there seemed to be left were a few basic protection spells that he was able to take down easily. “It’s safe,” Draco remarked, but Mathew didn’t seem completely convinced.
When they reluctantly let go of each other again, Draco’s eyes were watching Harry’s intently, as if he was trying to peer straight into Harry’s soul. Harry gladly let him.
When Harry had stumbled out of the Floo in his house and gone to his kitchen, he was welcomed by a fresh, lemony smell. The kitchen looked clean, the floor shining and all dishes - including the stuff that had been used for breakfast - neatly tucked away in their appropriate cupboards.
Draco turned slightly, careful not to show the surprise he was clearly feeling, his lips just short of touching Potter’s face. “Of course.” He knew he most definitely wasn’t going to back out of this again: just having concluded that he and Potter really
Feel free to drop a comment, if you'd like to. They're read and appreciated (even if I don't always reply. I'm not particularly good at replying, I'm afraid).
This Chapter was written to:
Okay, not a room, a suite, and a large one at that. For once Harry was actually glad the pompous twat had expensive taste. Otherwise they would probably have been stuck in a room with only one bed. Which would obviously, and for all sorts of reasons, have been absolutely unbearable.
That seemed to temporarily focus Draco’s attention: “Yes, we-, we can’t risk, the Cartel finding out-.” His breaths were sharp and shallow. “When we're ready, here, just take me-, take me to hospital. Ask for Corentin. Corentin Didier.”
be the end of it.
Their separation had been hard, but not near as hard as it should have been, which, Hermione had pointed out, probably meant they’d been growing apart for quite some time already.
“And I don’t know what exactly they took yet, but I do know you should talk to that piece of Malfoy sc-.” The owner of the shop must have picked up on something in Harry’s face, because he stopped, adjusting to: “To that Malfoy boy. One of the burglars walked into him, just before turning the corner, and he looked him straight in the eye before running off again, the Malfoy brat didn’t even lift a finger.” Here the man looked pointedly at Harry and Terry, adding, apparently wanting to be sure they knew exactly where to find Malfoy: “He works in that club a little further down the street.”
The relief he felt was short lived, though, because he was
It seemed an unbearable thought all of a sudden and the desperation Harry felt at that apparently made up for his lack of courage. “Do you remember?” Harry blurted out, entirely out of context, “You know, after we went to that club a few days ago?” Draco looked puzzled, but the pink on his cheeks intensified while he was seemingly holding his  breath and suddenly Harry found his bravery, pulling his courage from hiding as if it were a rabbit from a hat: “That we-, that we kissed? Do you remember that we, erm, kissed?”
And then he remembered.
of all people.”
“I think I will be able to. I just don’t know how long it will take, though.”
Draco suddenly found he couldn’t ignore it any longer. The pain that had been a low, burning hum in his shoulder blades most of the afternoon had fired up again, apparently meaning business this time.
Okay, that actually was a fair point. But then again: perhaps Potter had just lost track of time. “Yes, well, anyway,” Draco started, “I’m off now, so I erm-.” He finished not actually finishing and pointing at the door.
“Hey, you’re here already,” Ginny came in, not addressing either of them in particular, followed by Neville and Luna a few seconds later. Ginny turned immediately, aiming her next words at Neville. “You know it’s your turn to buy the next round. You were gone so early last week, that you didn’t get to buy a round all evening. So, your turn.” Ginny was smiling rather sweetly, but Neville wasn’t fooled and made it to the bar, immediately buying them their first round.
to a wound, not drink as Draco was used to doing.
It was what Nurie had said. And Harry just felt a need to ask: “So what
Because, yes, he was handsome, annoyingly so really, he’d always been: Draco was wasted enough to let himself appreciate that, to let himself stare for a bit.
Harry had cast
Harry’s eyes widened a little when he saw Draco, but he recovered quickly. “Draco.” There was surprise to his tone, but something else too, Draco noted hopefully.
“Ah, yes, so you still live in the old Black house,” Malfoy said, obviously completely in control once again, his words seemingly no more than an observation. Harry was only surprised at his knowledge for a very brief moment, before realising Narcissa Malfoy’s maiden name was Black. Of course Malfoy would know the house at Grimmauld Place had been owned by the Black family.
Harry seemed to take that as some kind of consent, his fingers travelling to Draco’s cheek softly, but with a strange sense of urgency, his hand eventually ending up cupping Draco’s jaw. His eyes had been holding Draco’s captive all the time, neither of them able to let go.
Draco frowned for the slightest moment as if he didn’t quite believe what Harry was saying. Then said: “Yes. Standing’s not-. I can’t really-.”
“I don’t actually think I’ve got my Saviour Complex on me today, thank you very much.” Harry kept his tone light, smiling slightly, but completely genuinely. “And I wasn’t going to say that. I just-. I just have a hard time believing you don’t have a Floo, you know, with your wizarding background.”
That’s when the elbow hit him right in the ribs. “Oh, sorry,” the man said, “didn’t see you there.” He had apparently been muscling his way to the other end of the bar through the crowd.
that way?”
Harry just nodded like Draco
“I also have every reason to believe the nightmares will get progressively worse. That would make sense with this sort of curse: to make sure anyone would spill their information eventually, however strong they are,” Corentin continued.
Dementors.
“How did you-?” Zabini started to ask Harry, then obviously changed his mind. “No, not important. I’m glad Corentin’s here. If there is anyone who can find the counter-curse to this, it’s him.”
Kreacher didn’t comment on their state of rumpled undress, not even under his breath, just giving them a look that Draco couldn’t decipher.
, it all was dangerously easy, deceptively domestic. And that it couldn’t possibly last.
All this had taken rather a lot of time, though, so when Harry finally got home, his afternoon shift had officially already ended well over two hours ago.
“Well, I thought I’d order some take-away,” Draco answered without thinking. It
Harry found he couldn’t look away now, though. He wanted to reassure Draco, wanted to touch him, like he had yesterday, but he wasn’t sure how that would be received now.
“No, just you,” Draco’d said it without thinking and he really wanted to elaborate: he should explain how Harry made him feel. It felt like something he should do, like something important, but his eyes just felt so heavy and he decided to close them first.
to come.”
It very much wasn’t – when had Harry ever been able to restrain himself when it came to Draco – their kiss long and lazy and utterly sweet.
While having dinner later that night they’d talked effortlessly, apparently completely at ease with each other. And somewhere throughout the evening – Draco was nursing a tumbler of  Firewhisky, just the one - Draco registered he felt happy, really happy.
Terry had already talked to Robards, of course.
“Actually Harry,” Hermione now started as if she had miraculously read his mind. “Draco has changed quite a lot and I meant it when I said that if you can
“But, … .” Potter sounded a bit surprised, like he wanted to object.
It was Draco Malfoy.
That was when Malfoy and Astoria started to dance.
Later that evening they were still on their beds, neither of them inclined to move. Draco had effectively confiscated the remote control for the television – ‘Potter, you wouldn’t even know how to use it’, which was quite unfair because Harry had lived in a Muggle household – zapping through a few channels before landing on a film with pirates and lots of elegant costumes. It probably figured that Draco would actually like that kind of thing.
They hid behind the first stalagmites they encountered - thank Merlin for caves - taking in their situation, sort of regrouping their rather pathetically small group.
Harry thought he’d never actually wanted to caress Draco quite this much, but for some reason his courage - the courage that had made him into
“Is anything the matter?” Malfoy was leaning in the doorway of Harry’s kitchen again, a look of concern on his face that up until now Harry had only seen directed at him at night.
He caught Harry watching him. “Aren’t you going to join me here?” Draco thought it was a legitimate enough question, but Harry drew in a sharp breath, taking a step back from the bed - which really wasn’t what he was supposed to do - but keeping his eyes trained on Draco nonetheless.
They apparated to Draco’s flat just a few short minutes later, their lips together as soon as the spinning had stopped, their kiss quickly changing from soft and sweet to deep and wanting. It was when Draco gave up all restraint, his hands snaking under Harry’s clothes to find bare skin, to discard of all this damned fabric that was in the way.
Then Zabini smiled: “You’ve probably just seen the living room.”
He was gorgeous.
“Malfoy,” he nodded back, realising how his own voice sounded a bit more stunned than had been his intention.
That was when Malfoy groaned, though, and Harry, panic rising, registered it was too late to bolt, because Malfoy had also opened his eyes.
Potter watched him with an open, genuine smile. “If I did, would you join me there?”
Fuck!
He’d left the kitchen before Harry’d had a chance to say anything else.
want him out, really,” Draco then answered, possibly even more quietly. “But my mother wants to try, wants to be able to take care of him, now he’s this ill. And I, well, I get
Harry shook his head. “No, it sounded like Latin, though, something beginning with Some-, ending in -um.”
spoke French, fast and fluently.
Oh fuck, who was he even kidding.
When Draco and Harry came out the light was blinding. They were congratulated on their clean result: having been able to extract the witness safely and keep each other unharmed too, without messing things up and attracting all sorts of other problems in the process. Only one other team had ever managed to do so before, but that team had apparently taken slightly longer to get there: making Draco and Harry top of the list in one fell swoop.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry was losing patience. Why couldn’t Blaise just tell him what he wanted him to do? Damned Unspeakables.
Harry nodded towards the entrance. “Both sides of the door?”
It annoyed Harry considerably. What had the git expected: that he’d trust him enough to have his own room? So Malfoy could take off without Harry noticing early enough to do anything about it? That definitely wasn’t going to happen. Harry might think there was something off, but that certainly didn’t mean he actually trusted Malfoy.
So Harry dropped their protection, feeling Draco’s solid back reassuringly against his.
And now he had to come up with another plan, although he really had no idea at all what that could be.
If she was at all surprised that Draco’s Patronus came in the form of a rather large dragonfly, she didn’t show.
“They’re asking for you back in room three,” a young mediwitch he hadn’t seen before, said a bit sheepishly. She probably also realised he wasn’t even supposed to be here anymore. “Someone has been brewing an unknown potion in his living room and it exploded. His whole family was there.”
Harry answered something in muffled tones and when Draco made it to the door and glanced in, he saw why: Harry was talking into Ginny’s hair, having pulled her so close she was almost sitting in his lap.
Harry put a tentative hand on his shoulder. “We really are going to do everything we can to make them pay,” he said with feeling.
Draco closed his eyes again. Perhaps if he just gave in to sleep, he would wake up tomorrow and all of this would have gone. It was most definitely worth a shot.
Because eating at the canteen also meant they wouldn’t be able to disappear into a dark corner the way they had at the Leaky. The canteen simply didn’t have any dark corners.
“Yes,” Malfoy shot him a quick glance. “Yes, it is.”
Zabini watched him in surprise for a moment, so Harry decided to add: “Yesterday evening we went to the Muggle club he used to work at.”
“I’d rather not, if it’s all the same to you,” Draco deadpanned, the words out before he could reign them in. “Let’s pretend I didn’t just say that. And yes, that would be Penelope.”
“So, you were obliviated?” Hermione addressed Draco now. It was very much like her to skip straight to what needed to be done, even though she’d been in Australia and Harry hadn’t seen her or Ron for almost a month.
Harry.
Harry didn’t say anything else, though, instead just softly pulling Draco towards him, meeting him in a kiss. It was slightly awkward at first as there was just the tiniest bit of resistance on Draco’s side, before he too melted into it, closing his eyes and giving as good as he got.
It really
It was a feeling he hadn’t had in a long time and he should probably tamp it down, before it became something he’d get used to. Before it would be taken away again. Before Harry would realise what he actually meant to Draco.
He had probably been walking to his bedroom, but had stopped short when Harry came in, looking Harry over rather slowly. It left Harry, obviously still just wearing his pyjamas, feeling uncomfortably underdressed: Malfoy was wearing a particularly beautiful Muggle suit in a shade of blue that was reminiscent of the sky at night. And, of course, it fit him to perfection.
Draco turned towards him, smiling a little, still feeling so blissed-out that everything in the whole, wide world seemed all right for a moment. “Of course not. Just sleep,” he said, his voice warm with how good he felt. Then he manoeuvred his arm heavily over Harry’s waist, leaving it there.
Ah, there she was. He found Ginny somewhere to his right, talking to a witch Harry vaguely remembered. She probably worked in Magical Games and Sport, or perhaps it was the Department of magical Accidents and Catastrophes, or it could also be-.
know if Draco was actually in, who would know exactly where he was hiding.
Zabini didn’t even nod, just cast a diagnostic spell by way of an answer. There were wards, but they were considerably less than there had been on the outer layer and Harry recognised most of them as the sort of basic wards even he had been taught to dismantle. Zabini started on them straight away.
buying,” he added in an attempt to balance things out a bit, because he knew he shouldn’t have gone along with it, that it was as stupid as it was unexpected.
Harry kept smiling at him, though, and he knew it was soft, completely fond. He was utterly unable to look away from the grey of Draco’s eyes and even though Draco was probably right – Molly would undoubtedly not take kindly to them being late again - Harry still pulled Draco in for a kiss, intending it to be short.
Harry didn’t go tomorrow either.
So eventually Draco surrendered and apparated straight to Grimmauld Place, knocking on Harry’s door instantly.
Okay, Harry was going to make him spell it out, so Draco did: “Well, let’s see. You don’t want this. And I certainly don’t want to make you. So, we’ll just have to find another way to-.”
“Yes, we just talked. I wasn’t allowed to bring him anything, of course.” Harry knew that, as it was part of the rather harsh regime in Azkaban: few people were allowed to visit and no one was allowed to take anything to the prisoners there, not even cake on their birthday, but what concerned Harry more was that Luna had apparently
Corentin nodded again, obviously thinking. Then he set to work, casting numerous  diagnostic spells in quick succession. In a way it looked rather similar to what Draco had done earlier, when they were getting into that damned, fucking house.
“Did you see how Professor Malfoy took down the curse on that cube? It was quite amazing, wasn’t it: all those threads of magic suspended in the air and how he just took them apart as if that was the easiest thing you could possibly do.” Harry heard the conversation in passing while he was walking up to the front of his classroom. He refrained from saying anything.
