“Oh you mean the one the troll immediately smashed through?”
“Well then you’re out of luck, Potter.”
“Why didn’t you then—take your pick?”
“Maybe he just doesn’t care about his looks?” Greg ventured softly. Draco was surprised he’d join this conversation.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes in irritation. “Under me. And yes, since you so clearly need all the help you can get. Now be a good boy and fetch our ingredients.”
The three didn’t need to be told twice and swiftly left the teachers and troll behind in the bathroom.
but he also was feeling slightly sick to his stomach already, so he just helped himself to some of what was closest.
“Did you not have many wizarding friends growing up?” Blaise asked gently, though it still felt like a gut punch.
“Er, I don’t know. She already took away ten points…”
“You’re dismissed.”
“Okay…” Harry had no idea what to do with her bluntness, but was glad that it wasn’t pity at least.
“I don’t!” Harry squeaked. “Despise you, I mean. Malfoy I absolutely still despise.” Hermione beamed. “Friends?”
When he looked back, a feast like nothing he’d ever seen had appeared on the table. It was overwhelming. He wanted to try
Harry was on top of the stairs when a hand caught on his sleeve and held him back.
“I take your point. I just hadn’t planned to train a new seeker for another year.”
“I see.” Snape’s face fell.
“I’m not afraid of the lake.”
“Potter, stop. Whatever harebrained scheme you’ve cooked up this time, you can’t go up against a
When she looked at him expectantly he replied “…but your enemies closer?”
She smiled. “He’s just a child, with a talent that deserves to be nurtured.”
“Exactly. So,” she drew up her legs under her and turned a little towards him, but continued speaking in the general direction of the common room. “Snape hates you for some reason. And I think it’s quite unacceptable that he makes no secret of that.”
,” he snarled in an eerily good rendition of Snape at his most malicious. “
“You teach me then.”
“Uh, Harry’s fine, sure, Blaise?” He nodded. “And, um, it sounds cool, but I’ve actually never played before, so…” Adrian looked up mildly surprised.
“I was
“Of course, darling.”
“Blaise Zabini,” the other boy offered neutrally, as if he could hear Harry’s thoughts.
“No! I just didn’t want it to break.”
“Umm, will many people have a problem with me being, well, half-blood?” He thought of Malfoy’s disdain for anyone he considered less-than.
“It was pretty useless in this emergency.”
Flint scowled at him, as if to say
, catch it, and then effortlessly pull up, more unrestrained joy on his face than she’d seen on it in weeks.
“That’s what I’m saying!” Draco agreed. “And the holes? He’s inherited the Potter fortune. He’s hardly destitute.”
“Um,” he glanced at Malfoy who didn’t look up, “because I didn’t cut the dandelion root in time,” he admitted sheepishly while Snape surveyed their workstation.
“Potter wanted to heroically swoop in and rescue you from it but instead he just led it to you.”
like him.” And Malfoy almost, pouted?
In the sudden quiet, his racing heartbeat was all Harry could notice. What was happening? He didn’t understand. Then the world came crashing back in. Blinding light. A torrent of whispers. Then the cheers from the far table draped in green. Was he imagining the vaguely threatening edge to the loud applause?
To Harry’s utter shock, the regally handsome boy took the seat opposite his and graced him with a lazy smile. “Potter,” he greeted with the most minute incline of his head.
Harry shook his head. “Uh, no, why would they?”
Harry was tired, too. He spent so many evenings in detention with Snape, scrubbing cauldrons and sorting through potions ingredients gone bad, after inadvisedly rising to the bait again and again, which left nights for homework. It felt like he was back at the Dursley’s. He knew it was unsustainable but he also wasn’t about to just let Malfoy get away with everything.
It was Gemma who released him from his inner turmoil and he thought she perhaps wasn’t completely hopeless at this emotional support thing. “Anyway Snape’s a teacher, so it’s probably fair to expect him to be better than that. And he’s your head of house, so he should definitely treat you better than that.”
“There’s a troll outside,” Harry panted.
“This is about Granger? Are you out of your mind? This is not the time to try and impress a girl! Is there some star-crossed lovers plot going on that I didn’t hear about? If you want to throw your life away, fine. But leave me out of it!”
It started small, tripping Harry in a corridor and then demonstratively trying to help him up again, vicious whispered remarks and no way to retaliate under Snape’s watchful eye, notes, so many notes from Malfoy detailing all his inadequacies. Malfoy was the ringleader, obviously, Crabbe and Goyle his steadfast companions. Though Pansy Parkinson and her little gang got their fair share in, too. Daphne stayed out of it as she’d said, but she also didn’t distance herself from Parkinson, so that assurance felt somewhat hollow. Blaise similarly talked with whomever he pleased, only declaring “these schoolboy larks quite tiresome” but then he found most things boring. Theodore Nott always had his face in a book except when he had breakfast half asleep with Blaise and Harry, though when Malfoy strutted in late, loud, and annoying, he was frequently nowhere to be seen.
He practically heard his father’s instructions to get close to Potter in his ears already. His letter would be so
“Um.”
Their dorm was two rows of beds and wardrobes, windows to the lake on the far side, and a small fireplace in the corner. His trunk was waiting for him at the foot of the bed closest to the fireplace. Next to him was Theo and then Blaise, and opposite them were Vince, Greg, and Potter. He supposed it was appropriate that his and Potter’s beds were as far apart as possible, but it still felt odd somehow, being thrust into new sleeping arrangements and not even getting to chose his bed. He thought about making Theo switch with him, but changed his mind. “Good thing I have the bed by the fire,” he drawled. “This castle’s heating charms are a mess.”
“Nah, nah, nah. I’m not taking credit for this mess. Also I only talked about positive reinforcement. What you’re suggesting is negative punishment, that’s not the same at all.” Harry stared at her, completely bewildered, while she tried not to laugh at him. “You’re not getting out of studying so easily, little boy. You’ve shown what you can do, now keep it up.”
“By sticking his wand up its nose?” Snape’s tone was caught somewhere between disbelief and disgust.
“When it didn’t find us in the shattered stalls, the troll came to the ones on our side,” Hermione continued. “I screamed,”
Meanwhile Malfoy who had apparently waited around for Harry was ranting at him. “…ridiculous, when my father hears of this… you aren’t really going to join the team, are you? Snape was joking, wasn’t he? Actually I have never heard him make a joke, I don’t know if that wouldn’t be worse. But in any case, it’s not like he’s just going to do what McGonagall wants, where would we end up… Potter, I’m talking to you!”
“No, really I’m hopeless. And up to now I’ve been partnered with Malfoy who’s some sort of prodigy so if anything the change will be for the worse when we’re starting solitary brewing tomorrow.”
“You were the one who emptied the rest of the bottle in the troll’s face…”
“I don’t know. The evidence certainly seems to point in that direction… he could have hardly done more to declare you an outcast.”
“Proving the stereotypes others have about or house right doesn’t seem like a good way to get rid of them.”
you to mix them with the flobberworm mucus.”
“Sit down, Mister Weasley,” Snape cut in. “Keep your quarrels out of my classroom. One point from Gryffindor.”
, “had shattered. And one scratched its eye and it was whacking everywhere, and then Harry finished it off.”
“Yeah, yeah, you’re very old and very cool.”
“We have to wash the beetle eyes? It’s not listed in the instructions.”
He rode that high right into his Saturday detention where Snape had him cleaning all sorts of little lamps, stoves, and burners, which if charitably interpreted felt almost like a continuation of the last lesson. And he was still in high spirits when he went to the quidditch pitch with Marcus Flint, team captain, and Terence Higgs, the current seeker. Flint was terrifying and Higgs was airy and hard to pin down in the way that Slytherins often were.
Gemma turned serious. “Some do. Less so than with muggle-borns. It’s fucked, but I can’t say it’s terribly uncommon. You’re a Slytherin now though. Above all, we are loyal to our House. If anyone gives you shit, we will have your back, always.”
“Awkwaaard.”
a Slytherin,” Harry retorted, though under the self deprecation the comment still stung. And really, he hadn’t even known about Slytherin’s existence for all that long.
“Yes, haha, very funny. So will you play quidditch or not?”
“You never know who might sneak up on you.” She casually interlinked their arms and led them towards the common room.
Only their heavy breaths interrupted the quiet of the empty hallway. Then Harry continued walking and a second later Malfoy was back by his side. “I’m not going back
“Did you know that offering emotional support to younger students is part of my responsibilities as a prefect?” she asked him without any introduction.
“Leading you into a trap right now?” She laughed. “No, Greengrasses are nothing if not diplomatic.”
“No matter. If you ever find yourself out of your depth, I’m positive Miss Farley here will have all the answers.” He nodded towards the tall girl with long brown hair on Harry’s other side.
“You tricked me.”
“I still despise both of you,” Malfoy spat out before turning on his heel and marching off.
Harry gritted his teeth. Sure, he’d had no idea that a stasis charm was something you could ask for. He still wasn’t sure it was something anyone but a Slytherin could ask for. But did Snape have to make it so obvious that he knew, too? Ugh, this was hopeless.
“What do you mean ‘no’?”
“I am not!”
“So? It’s a troll. We weren’t supposed to win against it in a fight.”
“Er, yes, actually.” He smiled shyly and sat down opposite her. “Can you teach me how to brew the herbicide for tomorrow‘s potions class?”
Conversation picked up more leisurely now that people were eating. “So, Harry—can I call you Harry?—are you interested in a spot on the team?” Blaise asked him with a nod to their seat neighbours.
The third match was the longest. Harry mirrored Higgs in circling the pitch but the snitch was nowhere to be seen. Then finally Harry saw it by the goal posts on the far sight but Higgs was so much closer to it. He feinted a climb and luckily Higgs took the bait but then when he wanted to circle back to the snitch, Higgs blocked him, and he lost sight of it. Higgs grinned at him. “Nice job, Potter.” Harry grinned back. Then they both saw it again. It was a simple and fair race to the other side of the pitch. Harry leaned forward and spurred on his broom with all his heart until they were both stretching out their hands and
She watched Harry slump away as she made them lock away the brooms, looking in turns relieved, miserable, and apprehensive. When she’d dismissed them, she set out for the dungeons.
“So reprimand him, don’t punish the rest of your house. I was under the impression you rather cared for their performance in the quidditch cup.”
The dorm was going to be a nightmare.
Draco stared after him and then looked back at the others. “What was that?”
it was his fingers that closed around the snitch.
“The price of heroism.” The return of Malfoy’s arrogance, smirk in place, strutting around the place as if he owned it, was jarring. Harry skipped the crowd and went straight for the showers, safe in the knowledge that by tomorrow the tale of how Draco Malfoy had singlehandedly slain the troll would have spread far and wide throughout the castle. Harry didn’t care. He was alive. And he had made a friend.
Minerva sighed at the prospect of what she had to do, of another lost cup, of Severus’ sneering, but it needed to be done. If flying like the devil made that boy happy, Gryffindor would just have to work harder, Wood would have to understand. It wouldn’t do to keep a natural seeker like that grounded. The mere idea was unbearable.
“A what?”
She threw him a curious look and raised a silencing bubble without comment.
“Sorry, sir. I don’t know.”
“Snape was—decent to me??” he immediately burst out. “I mean not nice but fair-ish? He allowed me to try out late for the quidditch team! And he reprimanded Malfoy!! What did you do?!”
Potter snorted at Blaise’ sing-song voice. Greg and Vince were hiding their grins very badly, while Theo didn’t even look up from unpacking his trunk. Draco glared at Blaise. “Not if I set all your socks on fire.”
“Very well.” Snape waved his wand over the potion which immediately froze under a golden bubble. “Two minutes should suffice. Do try to pull your weight, Potter. Mister Malfoy, two points for Slytherin for your foresight in asking for a stasis charm.”
“Do you have that agreement in writing?”
She fell silent for a while, then sighed. “Slytherins don’t always have it easy in this school.” Harry snorted, though in the back of his mind thoughts were stirring, trying to remind him how he had been turned against the house before ever setting foot on school grounds. “I guess he fancies himself a counterweight of sorts, someone who will always be on our side.”
“I mean it!” He hissed, and clamped his hand over Malfoy’s mouth. “Do you hear that?” The rumbling was getting louder now. Those were definitely heavy footfalls, and something big being dragged along floors and walls. “Quickly,” he whispered, and crept towards the other end of the hallway.
“Snake in training. It’s fine. Next time you figure out someone’s intentions, try not telling them to their face.”
“Where were you? You reek!” Pansy greeted them the second they entered.
So when they entered the dungeon that day he quickly secured a spot in the back. Blaise joined him at a much more sedate pace. Harry didn’t understand at all why Blaise put on such an air of bored disinterest for their classes—magic was awesome!—but right then he was grateful for it.
“Why, are you worried about me, or what?”
She focused him with a sharp look. “How do you know the subject of tomorrow’s lesson?”
Draco scoffed, but before he could say more they were herded further into the dungeons to the dorms. “Goodnight, Draco,” Pansy called to him.
“I’m, uh, pants at potions.”
“Too bad, I like it here.” Draco grinned. Theo rolled his eyes.
“Minerva, this blatant attempt at manipulation is beneath you.”
In the next match he held nothing back. He just pushed the broom as hard as it would go and raced and raced in jubilant turns and sprints. They saw the snitch at the same time, far below, and Harry knew for sure then that reckless dives were what he lived for. He caught the snitch and marvelled for a moment at the glittering thing in his hand until Flint whistled and signalled for him to restart.
The one bright spot had been the Weasley prat’s horrified expression at Potter’s Sorting. A rough awakening for him and his ilk.
“No, I suppose not.”
“Good night,” he smiled at the girls as they were separated.
“No, professor,” Hermione answered meekly. Harry still couldn’t believe she was lying so brazenly to shoulder all the blame. “Harry and Draco saved my life.” More like endangered it.
His hopes for obscurity were crushed with haste. “Mister Potter. Our newest celebrity. Slytherin House should be so grateful,” Snape sneered as he entered the classroom from the back, black cloak billowing and stopped beside Harry’s workbench. The class immediately fell silent. “Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” The Gryffindors hadn’t even arrived yet.
She did laugh then. “Oh, don’t be dramatic. Come on, off to the library with you.”
“Great, ask her. She’ll want to prove she actually knows best, so she’ll definitely agree.”
“Does this look finely diced to you?” Malfoy was rapidly talking himself into a rage. “In which universe are these ugly chunks small? Or cuboidal?” Harry couldn’t help but laugh at Malfoy’s indignation which only set him off more. “Do you
“You’re a prefect?” Harry asked, noticing she was wearing a badge just like Percy’s.
Draco was aghast. “I should think these rags hardly qualify as clothes. You’re
“I suppose.” Draco watched the two squabble. It was strange. That this crowded little room under the earth(/water) was where he lived now. No one brought up the topic of Potter’s ill fitting clothes again when he returned from the bathroom. And they all went to sleep soon after (each in their own bed). It was some time more until Draco fell asleep as well.
, “with the broken fragments of the mirror, the troll,”
“Hm. What are the uses of a bezoar? Nothing, Potter?”
“Oh, so it’s only okay for him to bully students in other houses?” His anger had spiked suddenly and he vaguely felt that Gemma did not deserve to be its target but he was so sick of this.
“She would put you on the quidditch team.” He leaned back and enjoyed the twin looks of shock on their faces. Perhaps Minerva’s advice had its merits after all. He still considered rejecting it, out of principal, for its sheer ridiculousness. Except, Minerva was deadly serious about quidditch. She’d never joke or exaggerate about this. It made him wonder. If Porter was as good as she claimed, he wouldn’t be able to keep him from the quidditch team for long. And why should he? Making Potter Junior trounce the Gryffindors seemed like a remarkably better use of his time than anything the boy would come of with on his own.
Blaise grinned. “That sounds quite cynical. Apt guidance though, I suppose.”
“Why do you ask me, and not Malfoy?”
He found Hermione in the library.
looked around the room with all the wide-eyed wonder of a plebeian. He kept staring at the windows to the lake and the carved fireplace as if they held more than murky darkness and some much needed warmth.
House and yet reject his company a second time, choosing to immediately cosy up to the quidditch team and
Malfoy snorted. “I have determined that your company makes me distinctly less safe.”
“Huh?”
The first years who had already been sorted all sat clustered around Malfoy who at least, Harry was gratified to see, looked just as shell shocked as himself. He had no intention of sitting with them. So he just dropped into the first free spot near the front end of the table, his back to the rest of the hall, and tried to pretend everything was fine.
Harry had his doubts about that. “What if the shit comes from inside the House?” Gemma turned grim, but Blaise cast a knowing glance down the bank to where Malfoy was presumably still glaring at him.
“What about qui—yes, of course,” he subsided after another quelling look and reluctantly left the room.
he’d thought, hardly believing his luck. What a wonderfully cruel twist of fate. Oh, the possibilities…
“Malfoy, shut up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then stop following me!” Harry swivelled around to face Malfoy. This was ridiculous. “Go back to the common room and tell everyone how glad you are to be rid of me.”
“I see. Perhaps we should try something simpler, yes? What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?” His voice rang loud and cold against the stone walls and Harry couldn’t think.
“Oh don’t pout.” Blaise had changed into his pyjamas and was lying on his belly straight across Theo’s bed, grinning at him. Draco threw a pillow at his head and smiled when he failed to dodge it.
“Eh,” he thought telling Hermione about the records Slytherin house kept of syllabi ranging back centuries might be a bad idea then. “I don’t
“Oh,” but Gemma quickly recovered. “Well then the change will be even more noticeable.”
“Er, none actually. I grew up with muggles.” Harry was pretty sure that everyone in the vicinity was listening now, even though they were speaking quietly.
“…Well my Gryffindors may be glad to have another year’s respite before they have to face Mister Potter on the pitch.”
“Oh, well, if that is all,” her excitement visibly drained. “He respects her, I’m pretty sure. Might be a one-off then.”
“Ew, that’s vile, Granger!”
“Ugh, fine. If I get a dose of your dental potion.”
Harry stared at her. “You… screamed. At… Snape?”
They laughed it off but something contemplative remained in Gemma’s expression that worried and intrigued him.
“Yes,” Harry laughed. The others might have been onto something. Quidditch was brilliant.
Flint grinned. “Deal. Potter, you’re in. Practises are Sunday and Wednesday evenings, starting at six.” The
“But he probably won’t, since he’s a lazy sod, busy with NEWTs,” Higgs added in a low voice making Harry snigger.
“I misjudged you, Harry—“
“Yes, very clever.” Inwardly he begged the spirits for patience. “Both of your behaviour is unbecoming of your house. But you especially should know better.”
“Did I,” she laughed, “suggest anything that ambitious?” Harry shrugged helplessly. “Well, I suppose a bit of creative blackmail… a student revolt might be asking too much.”
when there’s a troll on the loose.” Harry ignored him. They were almost to the girls’ loo. “Have you even stopped to consider just telling a teacher to send her a patronus?”
The class hadn’t even officially started yet and he already wished for nothing more than it to end. On the hour, Snape opened the door again with a dramatic flourish and let in the Gryffindors. It was their first class together, and Harry suddenly dreaded facing them after having spent the whole train ride together. When Ron’s eyes fell on him and Malfoy in the first row, his eyes narrowed and expression hardened. He walked up to Harry, his whole posture accusatory. “So you’ve changed your mind then?” he said, a bit too loudly, with a disgusted look at Malfoy who was lazing back in his chair enjoying the spectacle.
Just as they reached the door to the girl’s bathroom, the troll rounded the corner of the corridor. Three meters tall, wielding a spiked club half its size, and coming for them. Frozen to the spot, Harry slowly reached to open the door and then Malfoy pushed them both inside and locked the door with a “Colloportus!”
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Malfoy smirked at him. “Setting up the flame and cauldron is delicate work. Now, shoo.”
“Neville Longbottom’s remembrall, sir.”
“Why?” Harry genuinely couldn’t take much more of this.
“It was charging at me! What—should I have discarded my best weapon to
“Do muggles not know how to tailor garments to size?”
“I think it’s very relevant to her romantic choices.”
“Uh…”
“Lucky me,” he replied distractedly.
“Potter, I will permit you to try out for seeker. Marcus Flint will decide whether to take you on. If you continue to flout the rules, to refuse to act to the benefit of your house, or if your marks get any worse, I won’t hesitate to take you off the team. Do you understand?”
would you think that would work?”
Ron snorted incredulously, but before he could say something he’d surely regret another boy from Gryffindor dragged him to a seat. Snape proceeded to scare the class into submission with his take on a welcoming speech and then posed the same questions he’d used to humiliate Harry to the class. Harry couldn’t believe it when Slytherins that had clearly just looked them up, smugly answered all the questions, while Hermione Granger was flat out ignored. If this was what was meant by Snape having their back, Harry was sure he didn’t want it.
Power dynamics are adrift in House Slytherin. Someone’s not happy about that.
“On his way to the hospital wing!” Potter countered hotly. “That doesn’t mean you can just take it.”
“Because last year’s results suggest we desperately need Potter..?” he sneered. Her expression lost some of its cheer at that.
“My..? It’s an eau de toilette, and I really think now is not the time.”
She looked at him blandly for a moment before breaking out in laughter. “Of course not! Merlin, you should see your face. I intend to live a bit longer.” It took a moment for the bewilderment on Harry’s face to catch up and morph into a (still slightly bewildered) grin. “No really, I’m sorry, I only made the subtlest remark. I don’t think he even noticed. I wish I could take credit. Any clue what brought this on?”
his rule breaking tendencies?”
“Yes, sir.” It was barely a whisper but he was tired of dealing with them, so he let it slide.
If you like it, please tell me ╰(*´︶`*)╯
“Yeah, rough deal, mate.” Ron laughed. “No one hexed you, yet?”
“So you’re saying you have nothing to gain from bullying me at the moment?”
Writing Draco was surprisingly hard, poor thing might no longer be the biggest fish in the pond, please give him a hug.
And now he sat there and had to bite his tongue because of course it wouldn’t do to complain about Slytherin’s newest jewel
“Er, McGonagall saw me flying when I wasn’t really supposed to, so she reported me to him. And he
He doesn’t respond to Luna’s inquiry, but she doesn’t seem to notice and they fall into a comfortable silence. Just when he thinks his confusing thoughts might’ve gone unnoticed she asks him, “Harry...why is your head so full of wrackspurts?”
Just as a look of realization flitted over Ron’s face, Draco reached out to touch Harry’s arm in an effort to comfort the boy. Much to Draco’s surprise Harry violently jerked away as if expecting a blow to be delivered upon him. Draco was getting increasingly more concerned for the boy when Ron calmly leaned closer to Harry.
“Why bother crying about it?” Pansy asked on Draco’s other side. She had a Slytherin scarf artfully draped around her shoulders and she wound the tassels on the end round and round her fingers. “It’s not like they can go running off into the woods to find her, is it?” she said with a wicked grin. Draco couldn’t contort his face into a reaction they would approve of, so he instead stood.
"All packed?" he asked brightly and Scorpius nodded, taking a deep breath. "Looking forward to it?" Draco continued and Scorpius nodded again. Both boys had grown a few inches over the summer, and both were now lanky, coltish, though Albus was broader at the shoulders than his brother. "Oh, I almost forgot!" Draco said, remembering. He reached for his wand, bring it out from his back pocket and flicked it overhead. From upstairs, a door clicked open and there was the sound of rushing wind, before a small, tattered but well-loved looking bear came zooming down the stair bannister, heading straight for Scorpius.
“Malfoy, would you like to join us for lunch?” she called to him, and he looked up with a bewildered expression that quickly smoothed out into a neutral one. Harry opened his mouth to protest but Hermione stood on his big toe (entirely on purpose, despite Hermione’s apologetic smile).
“Harry!” Ron was incensed, the tips of his ears red. He had an arm around Hermione, who looked pale again. “How long have you known this – why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone – we could still go–” he protested and with a small moan, Potter went to his knees in the sand. Draco lurched forward and went to him, taking him by the shoulders, but Potter was still talking.
What about under the loose stone near the door to the boys dormitory? No.
“Why did it burn?” Potter asked and Draco looked skyward – above him was nothing, just like what surrounded them, and he felt a bit of vertigo at the thought.
"Shall I get another round of tea, Mr. P? And I think Minister Granger's broadcast is about to start, if you want to tune in?" she said. Harry nodded, and waved his hand in the direction of the wireless which sat in a corner of the room. It crackled to life and the dial adjusted itself into the evening broadcast. Ron went to sit back at the desk while Malfoy gaped at Harry slightly.
Draco snorted in amusement and Ron grinned at him as Hermione lifted the edge of the cloak and he slipped back under its cover.
He went to dinner and picked uninterestedly at his food.
“Get up, climb up, come on–” Harry said, grasping Draco’s cloak and practically throwing him at the dragon. Draco climbed. He found a foothold in the crook of the dragon’s leg and pulled himself up onto it’s back, turning around instantly and hauling Hermione up behind him. Weasley followed, sitting behind Hermione, and then Harry climbed up, swinging a leg over the dragon’s spine just in front of Draco. The scales were hard and cold beneath them and Draco shot off a jinx at a human guard that came too close.
“One minute,” he told his mother through the crack in the door and then he shut it as he turned to fetch his things for dinner. Shoes, for one. Despite the heat of the day, he had not rolled up his shirt sleeves, in fear of seeing what lay hidden by the fabric, and he shrugged on a dark robe so he could conceal his wand in one of the inner pockets. He paused to look in the mirror above his desk and it tutted at him despairingly. He ran a hand through his hair and it fell limply around his face.
“You know Law back to front, Hermione,” he said reassuringly. She gave him a small smile and continued to pick at her breakfast. He did the same until Hermione stood, brushing down her skirt and giving the clock over the fireplace a significant look.
anymore. But – as Head Boy, Snape had told him that he had the ability to reset the password to the common room if needed. They might have stripped his powers after he fled the school, but he had to try.
“Well it– it screamed,” Potter added, before reaching into the blankets and struggling for a moment before pulling the locket out of his still damp jeans. He held it up and Draco caught sight of it – it still glinted cold in the lamplight, but had faded somehow, become less than it had been. Potter threw it at Hermione and it landed in her lap. She picked it up with trembling fingers and turned it in her hands, examining the shattered windows.
“The Chamber of Secrets,” he said and Draco gaped at him.
Draco watched the three Gryffindor boys work, looking up as Hermione, Fleur and Luna approached. Hermione, unsteady on her feet but determined, held Fleur’s arm as she walked. Fleur, now wearing a white apron tied around her waist which had a bottle of Skele-Gro in the pocket, handed Bill a travelling cloak as she passed, which he swung over his shoulders. Luna patted Draco on the shoulder and then slipped past him. With a moment’s hesitation, he followed. They climbed up the slope and found Ron sitting shoeless and sockless, with Dean positioning a wooly hat on Dobby’s head.
“He really is,” Harry added, reaching out a hand to Draco who laced their fingers together and stepped in close. Longbottom studied their interlocked fingers for a second before nodding once and reaching out a hand to Draco, who took it.
“His pulse is racing. He must be having another vision,” she said and then Bill was behind her, crouching down on the ground.
An all-out brawl was building in the Great Hall. The bodies of the dead had been tucked away somewhere, who by Draco didn’t know, but he watched as another Death Eater and Protector of Hogwarts alike took up arms against each other. Neville let go of his arm to join in a fight with Fenrir Greyback, who bared his bloody teeth as Neville raised his wand. Draco raised his too.
“Like Morgana I am,” Draco said, whipping his own wand out. He whirled it around his head and ran as the objects on either side of him began to cave in, sending piles of books and chairs and tables falling over Crabbe and Goyle. Draco didn’t even look back, sprinting as fast as he could, further into the room.
“Shall we head home?” Harry suggested and Hermione gave him an assessing look and then nodded. They wound their way out of the atrium and over to the Bodleian Library, where they found a quiet corner and turned on their heels, disapparating away.
“Barney Weasley. I thought he’d be useful in tracking Potter, but just my luck, he’s not heard from his cousin in years,” he said bitterly and Weasley coughed again.
"I didn't realise you would go through with it! I thought that your sentimentality might win out, might mean that-," Malfoy cut himself off, running a hand over his face. "This isn't the time. Tell me what I can do," he said, pushing himself away from the wall and walking over to stand in front of Harry. Ron cleared his throat.
“I have the honour this evening of announcing that we have awarded this years All Souls Fellowship to-,”
Hermione finally righted herself and pulled her beaded bag free with shaking hands as Harry joined them. He had his arms around himself, his wet hair attempting to spring free. Hermione pulled a bottle of the essence of dittany from the bag and unscrewed the pipette, letting a few fall to her hands first before passing the bottle along. They all hissed as the dittany healed their sore hands and faces, and Harry set the bottle down next to him on the grass as Hermione pulled out some bottles of pumpkin juice, handing them round, and then some clean, dry clothes.
The green flash did not come. All fell silent. Draco opened his eyes and took an involuntary step back as he saw Dumbledore standing in front of him, looking like he had done before all this, before Draco’s cowardice. He smiled, his blue eyes twinkling as he looked at Draco over his half-moon glasses. There was no one else on the Astronomy Tower.
“- we can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, take her if you want her.”
“Well… Why don’t you give it one more go?” he suggested and Draco ran a hand through to his hair and then lurched away from the alcove. Potter stepped back and crossed his arms over his chest, the pale wood wand dangling loosely between his fingertips.
“Why would I need one?” Father slurred and Draco felt an eyebrow involuntarily quirk in disbelief. Father had been in the bottle since that disastrous night on the Astronomy Tower, and hadn’t bothered to poke his head out since. Draco would be surprised if he had any idea what was truly happening in his house.
“He might kill me himself if he finds out I’m not,” he said and Harry gave him a small smile before pulling away and standing up. Draco stood as well, dusting himself off.
“Here,” Hermione said behind him, nearly making him jump. She brandished a cup of tea and Draco took it, setting the jar of bluebell flames down in front of him. “He seems a bit better,” she said, nodding her head in Potter’s direction as she settled cross legged on the floor next to Draco, her own mug of tea in her hands.
"Why our boys?" Malfoy had asked and Harry ignored the urge to correct him - they hadn't been Malfoy's boys for a long time, but now wasn't the time to point it out.
!” and Draco cursed him silently. They would know, and they did, and the Death Eaters fell back, crowing “It’s him! It’s Potter!” into the night.
It hadn’t happened.
“You?!” Greyback sneered and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Hermione, I’ve been short-listed!” he shouted down the phone and there was a moment of confused silence before Hermione shrieked and Ron swore in the background, obviously startled awake.
“Sometimes. But then sometimes not. They get overshadowed by other dreams. I’m sorry I can’t remember,” Potter told him solemnly and Draco only nodded. Potter shifted forward slightly, so now their knees were touching. “Did it hurt less when I touched you?” he asked and Draco realised he was talking about the burning Dark Mark.
The headstone was only two rows behind where they had found Kendra Dumbledore, and Draco approached carefully behind as Potter came to stand in front of it. It was made of white marble, and it seemed to shine in the dark. Draco read the inscription;
’ Draco thought just as Travers said it.
?” Harry said with a frown, running his fingers over the cover, his fingertips catching on the name of the author ‘
“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me,” he said and Draco had to interrupt.
"I dinnae agree with this, Po'er," he announced to this, squaring his shoulders. Harry nodded, and Begbie's expression softened. "But, it's yer sons. Try nae tae ge' killed, mind," he said finally, before turning himself and Disapparating away. Malfoy gaped after him.
"It doesn't make any sense," Malfoy protested from the sofa. "Yaxley couldn't have
“That’s good, isn’t it?” Draco asked, and Hermioned sighed, worrying her bottom lip.
“I am Fellow Williams. As a brief introduction, Mr Potter, this Viva will take about half an hour and in it we will be discussing the answers given in your four examination papers and any questions they may have raised. The Fellows in this room are Witches and Wizards and under the Statute of Secrecy, nothing you describe here that involves Magic will be divulged to our Muggle Fellows. Do you have any questions before we begin?” he said, and Harry shook his head.
“You – you reckon?” he asked and Potter turned away again, pacing once more. Draco turned the Snitch over in his hand as Hermione gave him a concerned look. It was a small, warm weight and heat seemed to radiate from inside it. He looked up as Potter froze in the middle of the tent, his fingers pinching his lower lip as he was lost in thought.
"I asked him to come here, Hermione - remember?" he said and Hermione's expression softened slightly.
“I only meant to dim them,” he muttered. He flicked the wand again and the lamps flared back to life, though brighter than before. “It’ll do. Mine’s broken,” he added by way of explanation to Weasley, who was frowning at Draco.
“I don’t think so. It took me all this time to find you, at least. I don’t imagine Snape will have an easier job,” he said, cradling the mug of tea and bringing it close to his chest, holding it to him. He suddenly felt very tired and drained.
Left upstairs alone with Scorpius' trunk balanced in front of him, and Albus' just inside his room (Draco could see the leather of the trunk just inside the doorway), he took a moment to reflect on what his life was now compared to what it had been a year ago.
The gargoyle that guarded the Headmaster’s office slumped sideways against the stone archway it guarded. It looked up dazedly as they approached, and Harry gestured to the staircase just visible behind it.
"They're in the mirror," Draco said quietly, firmly, and for a second Harry felt like he had eleven years ago, when he had found Draco lying flat on the floor, staring at the blue patterned wallpaper of their room, telling Harry in muffled whispers that a woman was trapped behind it, and she needed to get out. Draco looked over at Harry and took a deep breath. "The Mirror - it's enchanted. It used to be an escape route, during the witch hunts. Those of Malfoy blood can enter the Mirror and be kept in a safe space. He'll be keeping them in there," he said and Harry nodded, stepping up to stand next to Draco. He shook his head. "You can't come through with me, Harry. I have to go alone," he told him quietly, and Harry felt himself go pale.
"Mr. P!" Belinda shouted through the door, which was pulled ajar, and Harry looked over. She had poked her head through the gap, a pained look on her face. "I've a man here to see you Sir, said it's important, won't take no for an answer. Tall, skinny, blond - actually, if I didn't know better, I'd say he looked just like Scorpius, Sir, just a bit more… pointy," she commented and there was a noise of outrage from the person just outside the door.
He visited Dalby Forest twice more, but never found any further hints as to where they might have gone. And every other night, his Dark Mark scorched his skin, trying to summon him home. He resisted, crying and screaming and retching, but he resisted. He would not go.
“I remembered. Marvolo Gaunt, I saw him in a memory – he claimed to be a descendent of the Peverells. And – he had the ring! Dumbledore’s ring! What if that was the Resurrection Stone?!” Potter exclaimed, his voice rising in pitch as he started linking things together, and Draco froze. The ring on Dumbledore’s rotting hand, the one with the black stone that seemed to never catch the light… Could it be?
for my sons?"
“He beat you!” Ron shouted while Draco cried “You’re a liar!” Across the way, he saw his parents find him in the crowd with identical looks of horror on their faces. Whatever had silenced them before suddenly broke and the defenders of Hogwarts began to scream and shout, Draco among them, fury coursing through his veins. He wouldn’t remember, after, what he had shouted, only that it was all he could do to stop himself running across that gap.
“There’s so many people, Mama,” she whispered and Ginny nodded.
“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I–” but he broke off, staring at a spot behind Draco’s right shoulder. Draco whipped around as quickly as he dared under the cloak and had to smother a small shout of surprise. A heavily wrapped figure was limping up the lane towards them, caught only in the lights from the square in the distance. Draco couldn’t tell if it was a man or a woman, but they were moving slowly, as though worried about slipping. Granger reached and wrapped her hand around Draco’s wrist, as though scared, and he turned his hand to slip it through hers. On his other side, Potter did the same, taking a loose hold of Draco’s hand, in case they had to Disapparate quickly.
“You can see me?” Draco asked into the darkened room and Potter stretched, his t-shirt riding up to expose the soft skin of his lower abdomen. Blood rushed to Draco’s cheeks and he turned away just as Potter rolled his shoulders.
Without thinking, he pulled his wand out from his jumper and pointed it at Potter, who was knelt near the tent entrance, frozen. There was the bang from his wand and an echoing one from across the tent, and then Potter buckled over, clutching his face, groaning in pain. From the other side of Potter, Draco could see Hermione with her wand out too. They had both hit him with a jinx at the same time.
?” he asked and Potter snorted.
’ – Isobel MacDougal was a pure-blood, as was Draco. As for leading their fellow students on the right path, Draco could only guess. Behind him, the gargoyle cleared its throat once more.
“I thought I would find you here,” Snape said, his voice as kind as it could ever be. Draco scrunched his nose a little in distaste, and rose to stand, closing the book he had been reading and marking the pages with a finger.
“But I’m good! Papa–” Lilyana turned to her father and complained loudly in rapid Bulgarian, but he only smiled at her.
“I can assist with a Sleeping Draught if you so choose–”
“Yes, I think she does,” he said firmly and Granger chewed her bottom lip for a second before nodding and stepping back.
“No,” he groaned, his head starting to loll, his eyes becoming unfocused. “Hermione’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes,” he murmured, and Draco turned around to Ron.
And with a twist, Harry's world went falling away.
“The Chamber of Secrets was only a story though, wasn’t it?” Weasley piped up, settling himself into one of the clean armchairs, sending dust spilling over it. Draco fought not to tell him off. “What if what Lovegood was saying is true?”
“Uh, a few pages before my Father took it back, why–?” but he didn’t have time to finish the question before she scooted along to his log and shoved the book into his lap, nearly spilling his tea. She was warm against his side, apparently all personal space forgotten, as she tapped at one of the passages on the page she had been reading.
“What in Merlin’s name are you on about?” he asked and Potter turned that grin on him.
'. He knew the book, of course. It identified those families known as the ‘
“You always said you
With all three of them, it was a tight squeeze, but they turned to face each other in the darkness, listening for movement. There was noise still from the pub, louder than before – apparently the congregation had decided to continue their festivities in the pub. Draco could see Potter’s eyes linger on the pub but then Granger spoke.
“Are you a dream?” he slurred, still half-asleep and Draco had to tamper down his smile.
?!” he asked incredulously even as Hermione began to speak.
“I can’t believe anyone ever thought she was a legitimate journalist,” he said finally, tapping Rita Skeeter's name on the front cover. He gave her a guilty look as she let out a huff of a laugh. “Do you remember in fourth year, when all those articles came out about–?”
“Stag!” Aberforth sounded incandescent with rage. “Stag! You idiot –
“You’ll be best man, right?” Ron asked, sounding worried but Harry could only grin in return.
The lessons had been normal to begin with, but now October was well and truly underway and there had been changes. Many of the professors were still teaching the same, though all now were in the habit of barring their doors (Draco had heard a rumour that it was because a Ravenclaw third-year was taken from a Charms lessons directly to the Ministry of Magic and hadn’t been heard from since), and none of the professors engaged in talk about what was happening around the school.
The war had been over for 3 months, Voldemort finally dead for the past ninety one days. The wizarding world had in that time begun to heal. But the memories of those who lost their lives fighting in the battle of Hogwarts still sat heavy in some of the hearts of the heroes of the battle. It was this reason that Mrs.Weasley had suggested while Bill and Flear were visiting Flear’s parents some of the kids, well could they even be called kids anymore, take the trip up to their cottage by the sea.
“I would be willing to bet that she would never do that to you, even if she didn't feel the same way. Because, along with her headstrong qualities comes kindness and it wouldn't be very kind of her to do anything remotely cruel to who anyone can tell is a very important person in her life.”
The only thing that keeps Draco from falling apart at the thought of anyone wanting to inflict something so terrible on his wonderful boy, is knowing that experiencing it must’ve been a thousand times more painful.
Severus Snape bristled. What he had done to encourage this sudden chinwagging by Minerva was beyond him.
“People are never too old to change,” she sniffed. “Stop pointing out flaws in my perfect plan, it’s very rude.”
“We’re in the dungeons. A stone’s throw from our common room, or Snape’s classroom, or office! Do you really have to protect me from bullies here?”
in them, Potter! Is that why you’re afraid of the lake?”
“No, sir.”
had screamed. “So it came for me first, but then Harry burst out and levitated its club before it could hit and Malfoy disoriented it with a spray of, uh, eau de toilette. And we,”
“Mister Potter,” he flinched at the icy edge to her voice, “would you care to explain why you were flying without supervision or really any regard for your personal safety?”
“We don’t fight,” Gemma stressed. “Not publicly anyway. Use some muggle wisdom,” she winked at him. “Keep your friends close…”
“Oh.” That was… well nothing he hadn’t grown used to already anyway.
Telling the temperature by sight was fiendishly difficult, and it reminded Harry of aunt Petunia shrieking if the bacon was too hot or the tea too cold. But he used all the timers and tricks he had practised with Hermione and at the end of the lesson he had a herbicide that was definitely usable, he was pretty sure. Of course Malfoy’s next to his was (literally sparkling) perfect. Harry fully expected Snape to pass him by with no or only a derogatory comment, so when he got “a passable attempt, try not to get distracted next time,” he was almost ecstatic.
“It’s only for emergencies!”
She watched as he hastily pushed something at Ronald Weasley behind his back and sighed at their clumsiness, but decided not to pry. “That much is evident. Ten points from Slytherin for reckless disobedience and self-endangerment. Professor Snape will hear of this, make no mistake.” Let Severus deal with whatever foolishness they were up to. That’s what he got for stealing away Potter.
“That doesn’t justify what he does to other students.” He thought of Neville, close to tears, in more than one potions class.
weren’t friends with that slimy git, Malfoy!” Beneath the defensiveness he sounded hurt.
“Oh,” she blushed a bit. “Well, alright then.” Harry smiled hopefully. “Where do you want to start? Is there a particular part that’s unclear to you? Or do you want to go through the whole recipe? Do you want to analyse how it works or focus on the technical requirements for brewing it correctly? I mean I think it’s easiest if you understand why you’re doing it a certain way, but we only have one evening, so maybe we should start by reviewing the instructions.”
“Hey, I pass and all, I got an E last term! I just don’t think I’d be a very good teacher. First year is so long ago.”
She caught herself and rushed out to the grounds. She couldn’t help thinking back to another of her students, his boisterous laughter, imagining the pride that would swell James’ chest seeing his son take to the air like he was born for it. Like a particularly fearless little bird, not a boy who hadn’t known magic for a decade.
“Oh yeah?”
“Positive reinforcement! Muggles do it all the time!”
Harry snorted. “Me being forced to work with you is a favour?”
“Let me go back to bed now and I’ll stay on a while longer to train him for you.”
He let the door to his office swing open at the knock but didn’t look up. Malfoy dragged his feet in querulously, Potter followed more hesitantly. Severus finished grading the last essay before he called on them. “Sit. Explain.” His eyes came to rest on Potter, who gulped and stumbled over a reply.
“Oh really?”
“Right, well I’m going left here. See you around..?”
“Just do it, please. Raise your hand and use your words, Potter.”
“Want to switch?” Draco asked.
“I don’t,” Malfoy sniffed, his nose high in the air, like the perfect little prince that had temporarily forgotten he was about to be mauled to pieces.
“Ugh. Really? They’re after
“What?”
“These snakes travel in packs, Harry. I thought you got that by now.” She seemed unperturbed about having scared the life out of him.
, “attacked it,”
“Giving him another outlet, I’d say. And there’s no rule forbidding first years to join a house team,” she answered gently.
“I don’t know,” he answered very quietly.
He half listened to the prefects lecturing them and moved to the windows. “Afraid the merpeople will abduct you in the night?”
The highlight of Harry’s next day was Snape announcing to the class that they would be brewing a simple herbicide today. He exchanged a covert smile with Hermione. The problem was, brewing the herbicide was all about execution, and preparation could only do so much. He still came armed with extensive notes. A fact that escaped neither Snape’s nor Malfoy’s notice.
Potter, who’d frozen in his tracks midway to the bathroom, flushed angrily. “Clothes, Malfoy, what’s it to you?” he hissed defiantly.
“Weasley, Ronald,” Professor McGonagall’s voice cut through his thoughts. The line of students had dwindled considerably. He couldn’t believe that he’d almost missed Ron’s Sorting. Ron looked distinctly unhappy as he walked to the front. It only took a second until the hat yelled “GRYFFINDOR,” and relief flooded Ron’s face as he quickly went and joined his brothers. Harry’s heart sank. He immediately felt guilty. This was what Ron wanted. But he couldn’t help but panic as he felt the last chance of a friendly face among his dorm mates slipping away. Oh god, a dorm, he would be sharing a dorm with Draco Malfoy.
“He will kill you.”
more lessons.” He heard it come out whiny, but it was
“Oh, always.” She grinned at them conspiratorially.
Harry laughed—almost! He snorted instead. “Yeah okay, I can see it now, you look
Malfoy looked at him in disgust. “Your Snape impression is awful.”
“And why is it that you need one, Potter?”
Draco mirrored his movement and frowned, while the other boys continued unpacking by hand. Should he have asked his parents for ward stones? They weren’t allowed, strictly speaking. And his family’s reputation was supposed to be protection enough. His trunk and bag were secured against pilferers of course but he hadn’t considered the wardrobe. Bother.
“Oh, tomorrow—that’s perfect! Positive reinforcement works best if there’s no time delay. Just ask your partner to tutor you.”
The hat tutted, “Everything you need to thrive in Slytherin at your hands, and yet you’d spurn your destined House? Interesting, most interesting. You’ll certainly cause a whirl wind. Anyone would be hard pressed to say who’s to benefit more from your Sorting, you or… SLYTHERIN!”
Potter turned away from the lake to scowl at him. “Why, are you?”
“I never thought I’d
“You shut up.”
He wished his attachment was that easy to get rid of. “In private?” he added with a sideways look to Malfoy who was about to throw a fit again.
“Hey this was all your idea!”
“Nice to meet you.” Harry was as grateful as he was unnerved by Blaise’ demeanour which he found impossible to read. He held out his hand and Blaise shook it, with—curious?—amusement, perhaps. He wondered if all Slytherins were effortless conversationalists and what in the world the hat had been thinking in including him with them.
“Oh it’s ‘us’ now?”
Flint mirrored his grin and grabbed for his bag. “I brought order forms. I think you should get the newest Nimbus, there are a few other options, but this one’s just a really great broom all around…”
“Yeah, I gathered.” His eyes crinkled with amusement. “I’m a chaser on the quidditch team.” He indicated the students sitting behind him with a lazy hand wave. Most of them nodded at Harry, and eyed him with barely concealed interest. The one opposite Adrian introduced himself as Marcus Flint. Where Adrian’s handshake was firm, his was crushing. “Our dear captain, calling us together before the year’s even started… Careful of this one, Harry.” Marcus was tall, heavily muscled and looked menacing enough that Harry wasn’t entirely sure whether the warning had been in jest. The rest of the team was similarly imposing, though Adrian moved with such languid confidence even as he dodged Marcus’ kick under the table that Harry found himself with renewed curiosity about the sport.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione, marvel that she was, still had only a single instinct when presented with a question. “Trolls, trolls… aggressive, impenetrable skin,…” Malfoy had successfully shocked her out of her stupor and into rattling off everything she knew about the topic. “…excellent sense of smell…”
Severus silenced him with a look. “So you want to talk about your behaviour first?” Dread finally seemed to creep up on Malfoy’s face, whether at being chastised or at the idea of inadvertently causing Potter’s recruitment to the team remained unclear. He didn’t move or say a word. “I thought not. Tell me, Mister Malfoy, why you would provoke a member of your own house to such impossibly foolish behaviour?”
“Give it to me. Maybe we can mask our scents. Wash your pits, Harry.” Completely beyond the surrealism of the situation, Harry let himself be shoved to the sinks, and subsequently be sprayed with a mild citrusy fragrance from a tiny bottle Malfoy had produced from the inner pocket of his robes. “Take the stalls on this side, make yourself small, and don’t move.” If only it could have been this simple.
Minerva McGonagall was out of her chair in an instant when a shadow shot past her office window. She froze by the window, watching Harry Potter dive at breakneck speed after
else to occupy his mind, so this would do. He turned to the front of the hall to watch, but was met with a rather dazzling smile instead.
seemed heavily implied. “Higgs may call additional seeker practise if he so desires.”
His first official practise the next day only bolstered his good mood further. It carried him comfortably into the next week but by Thursday, when Flint caught up with him after lunch, it had mellowed a bit.
“Of course the great Harry Potter couldn’t just ask a teacher for help.”
“Harry,” Gemma sat down next to him on the couch in the corner of the common room.
“Um.” Harry hadn’t expected to be interrogated like this. “I think you’re much nicer than him?”
not be caught philosophising on main but I love the bittersweet conjunction of post-canon fics where Draco learns that Harry could have been in Slytherin and yearning for what could have been  and Slytherin!Harry rewrites where those dreams become reality putting what was lost in so much sharper relief. Alas this is the fic where wishes don’t come true and I just keep them struggling. As much as Draco wants to be a part of the golden trio, I feel a large part of him would have hated it. The attention and glory? Sure. But following Harry’s shortsighted lead into countless life-threatening situations? idk. Not that Ron and Hermione are gluttons for punishment, I just think Draco would need more time to grow into it.
obviously.”
“Yes, Granger, does your infinite store of knowledge contain anything about three first years surviving an encounter with a mountain troll?”
“I… we were just having a laugh. Forgetting a remembrall is, you know…”
“Oh.” Harry didn’t like where this was going. “But my mother was a witch.”
“And do you still think it was wise to pursue a troll on your own, Miss Granger?” McGonagall chided.
Except, how could he forget? Harry wanted nothing to do with them.
He held up a hand to silence them. Merlin, what a tedious contention.
“Oh you know, the usual. ‘I’m a big dungeon bat. Have some detention, Potter, since I’m not going to deduct points from Slytherin.’”
He frowned as he watched her sweep out of his classroom. So, Potter had finally found something to be good at besides causing trouble. And it just happened to be quidditch. How novel and unlike his father.
“Um, just wanted to chat? You know like …friends do?”
Malfoy smirked. “Well, he left it behind, so…”
It’s the day of the first potions class, and Harry isn’t nervous at all, why do you ask? /s
smells. I smell like a human.”
“Guys!”
But Blaise only laughed light-heartedly and tapped his wand to a button on his trunk, making his clothes fly into his wardrobe. “I’d like to see you try and get past my wards.”
“Shut up, Malfoy.” And with that Potter simply stormed off, nearly running into Vince who was coming his way.
sabotaging us?”
His annoyed gaze flicked to Draco Malfoy who was just about boiling over with irritation before looking back at the ground to her feet. She had to suppress a snort. These two were so lacking in subtlety, it was a wonder they’d survived a day in their house. “I’m sorry, Professor, I wasn’t thinking,” Harry ventured in his best imitation of meekness, though there was some real fear in his voice. She idly wondered what Rolanda had told them to keep them on the ground.
Harry huffed in frustration. He stared at Gemma, the slightly wicked twinkle in her eyes when she smiled, the harsh edge to her quite voice, how the greenish light flattened the auburn notes in her hair to darkness. And he imagined how easy it would be for her to don a cruel facade if someone wronged her. He wanted to protest, to insist that wasn’t him. He thought back to how Ron had hurled accusations at him in that first potions class, and how he’d gone after him and cleared it all up. But would he have done that if he had been just slightly less lonely? If the accusation had been something less disturbing than being friends with Malfoy?
“You’re not the first year with some discord among yourselves, but this level of animosity should not be encouraged. You’re a Slytherin, Harry. You all are. Snape should support you, too.”
I’ve enjoyed many a great enemies-to-lovers and Slytherin!Harry fic and just thought this would be a neat setup to combine the two! Not planning a grand rewrite here, but I do have a few more scenes up my sleeve.
She grinned pretty wickedly then. “Oh Harry, we’ll make a proper Slytherin out of you, yet.”
Harry conceded that he might have a bit of a point there, not out loud of course. “So, you carry perfume around with you?”
here?
“Gemma?” he looked up from his textbook.
“So it seems. With a huge helping of luck on their side I might add,” McGonagall sighed. “Five points from Gryffindor for this utter recklessness. Five points each to Mister Potter, and Mister Malfoy for bravely coming to the aid of your fellow student.” Malfoy bristled at this even as they were rewarded with house points. It came dangerously close to being called a Gryffindor. “Now please go to your beds without anymore detours before this one wakes up again,” she gestured towards the knocked out troll.
“Potter—what on earth are you wearing?” Everyone looked up at Draco’s voice. Blaise twisted half onto his side, and Theo just sat there on the edge of his bed in his pants.
They walked the rest of the way to the common room in silence.
Not only had Harry Potter decisively rejected him once already, now he had the audacity to join
“Yes, sir.”
“Everything alright there, Harry?” Blaise asked.
“Thank you. Look, who’s second best in your potions class?”
She looked at him pityingly. “He practically called you a simpleton who couldn’t be trusted with a potion. And he made it abundantly clear that anyone was welcome to bully you as long as they kept it within the House.”
“Snape won’t make an exception,” Flint tried very hard to appear practical about this but Harry could hear the incredulity in the slight shake of his voice. “But you still need a broom. So. I arranged with Madam Hooch that you can donate a school broom. We can store it in the Slytherin locker room and she promised you’ll get it back once you’re in second year.” That was… not an option Harry had even considered possible.
Harry tried to buy time by chewing thoroughly on his shepherd’s pie but he could genuinely barely swallow past the knot in his throat.
Professor McGonagall must have taken the hat back. Which meant he must have just gotten Sorted, into Slytherin. Mechanically he walked to his House. He didn’t look back at the queue, at Ron, or anyone. But he knew the tone of those whispers, the weight of those stares on his back. They were
Her laugh was dry but not unfriendly. “Yes, though he was also referring to me being a half-blood like you.” When Harry stared at her uncomprehending, she elaborated. “My father’s a wizard, mom’s a muggle.”
. Well, Pansy would probably hear him out. And he could count on Greg and Vince‘s loyalty. Blaise had already shown his disgustingly diplomatic side. Theo remained unclear, though overall unlikely to engage with any conflicts.
ableist humiliation by a teacher
“Oh, yeah. Did I do something to make Snape hate me?”
“It’s fine. I just don’t like them very much.”
As they headed to their first potions class—early—the prefects’ warning to the first years on their introduction to the common room rang in his head.
“This is not a reward for that little stunt of yours.” He waited until Potter nodded. “For that you will serve detention.” He almost expected a protest, but Potter was apparently too overwhelmed to speak. “Saturday morning at seven, in my classroom. Now leave.” Potter scrambled out of his chair and the office as fast as he could. He tried and failed to suppress the customary reminder that this was what Evans’ sacrifice had bought.
“Er dunno, just kidding.”
“Er…” Snape had announced an end to partner work for the next class. Harry knew he’d be doomed without Malfoy.
They flew back to Flint, trying to catch their breaths.
“Absolutely not.”
Hermione flushed bright red. “Which is not a substance that cannot be found in girls’ bathrooms.”
“Shut up, Potter.” Frustrated, Malfoy grabbed the knife himself and began furiously cutting the pieces into smaller stripes and then little cubes. In the privacy of his thoughts Harry could admit that the speed and accuracy with which he wielded the knife was somewhat impressive, and scary. “Ask for a stasis charm,” Malfoy told him off-handedly, his attention not wavering from the root in his hands.
Two minutes later, Malfoy had miraculously saved the dandelion root and added it to the cauldron just as the charm lifted. By the end of class, he had also prevented two more accidents at Crabbe and Goyle’s workstation next to theirs, and Harry was grudgingly wondering if he deserved some of the praise Snape was heaping on him for their perfect potion which he had produced with minimal input from Harry himself. And when Neville’s cauldron had exploded, he’d even been a little bit glad not to sit on the Gryffindor side.
of all people. Blaise, I’m above House politics, Zabini. Of course he would coincidentally forget being pointedly bored if it meant being the first to feel out Potter.
Since then when he had looked for Snape at the staff table, more often than not the professor had actually met his gaze with scathing glares that didn’t exactly inspire confidence in Harry.
She inspected her nails. “I’m pants at it.”
McGonagall shushed Malfoy. “What happened then?”
. This was everything he’d feared. He’d just joined the House known for exactly one thing: producing a string of evil wizards leading right up to his parents’ murderer. Harry felt numb.
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing?”
Malfoy only shook his head sadly. “Dreadful, embarrassing really.” Then he straightened his spine, drew his shoulders together, and whirled around to him, his cloak
Gemma gave a startled laugh. “That’s great, Harry, congratulations! Or good luck, I guess. I’m glad my screamed lecture on the importance of in-house unity to Snape was so immediately effective.”
He had always been picked last at school, because of Dudley. He had no idea if this time would be any different. He remembered Adrian and the team, congregating first chance they got at the welcome feast. Harry had never been part of a team. He knew he wanted to be. Desperately.
“Hm, yes, that’s something we’d have to plan around.”
, contempt written all over his face. “
“Well, yes,” Malfoy deflated a little. “So what did Snape say?”
“That was an accident. Maybe you could have used your best weapon even once.”
“There is one against owning a broom, and one against unsupervised flying, the latter of which he already broke.”
“You wish.” He wondered if he could train Malfoy, too. But he shuddered to think what positive reinforcement would look like for Malfoy, also he’d probably never get an opportunity to use it, since there would have to be something positive to reinforce first.
He just stifled his cry of frustration because Gemma dropped the silencing charm.
made it seem like it was her idea?”
“We should have run! Never put ourselves in this position in the first place! Screamed for help! Take your pick.”
“Can you tell how imminently qualified I am?” Harry was pretty sure she was asking in a self deprecating manner.
“He did? Oh.” More pitying looks. “But you aren’t?”
“No, but we can still use this!” she perked up again, though Harry suspected it was more for his benefit than a genuine reaction. “Can you be brilliant in your next potions class?”
but nodded curtly. It occurred to Harry that Flint must have invested quite a bit of time into conjuring up this weird setup all for Harry to have his own broom (at least in practice if not on paper). He grinned.
Harry grinned back at her. “Yeah.” Then Hermione turned towards Gryffindor tower and he hurried back to Malfoy. “Hey what happened to not walking the corridors alone?”
“Eh, right.”
Gemma sighed very patiently, if that was something you could even do. “Ask someone else? Yes, potions is difficult. But there are in fact plenty of competent people who I’m sure would be happy to help you. Just focus on one potion at a time and you’ll be fine.”
“Hmm. Rough lesson for you there today. And then you just ran out…”
“What am I now, then?” He tried for indignant, but ended up grinning back at her.
Once he returned, Malfoy rifled through the ingredients, made unimpressed noises, picked some out and started measuring and crushing them. “What are you waiting for, Potter—an invitation?” he suddenly turned to him. “You can wash and dry the beetle eyes then mix them with the flubberworm mucus and dice the dandelion root.”
“Sure, what is it?” She turned towards him with a smile, and the other fifth year she had been with went off somewhere else.
“Come on, get your clothes off, and come to bed,” Blaise began pulling on Theo’s trouser legs.
“These things were nowhere near his size,” Blaise seemed concerned. “Even if he’d had lost half his weight before, he wouldn’t be tall enough for them.”
Draco Malfoy was not having a good time. This was not how his illustrious entrance into Hogwarts was supposed to go at all.
Her wide smile was brilliant and only a little bit hesitant. He wasn’t sure what he had just agreed to but it couldn’t be completely horrible.
“Aha!” Harry wasn’t sure what point this proved but there had to be one.
“Ugh, I really don’t have time for this, Malfoy.” He shook him off and continued half walking, half running.
Ron laughed which seemed to startle himself so that he awkwardly stopped. “Sorry. Never thought I’d be friends with a Slytherin.”
“This is really your first time playing?” Higgs asked.
Snape abruptly turned away from him and walked towards the front of the room. “Miss Parkinson, switch places with Mister Potter. Mister Malfoy, make sure he doesn’t embarrass himself.” There were some quiet snickers at that. Blaise grimaced at him sympathetically. Harry’s face was burning red as he gathered his bag, parchment and quill and went to the first row to sit next to Malfoy. Pansy gave him an ugly sneer as she slowly vacated her seat. Malfoy on the other hand looked like the cat that got the cream. He gave Harry a slow, predatory grin that made his skin crawl.
Ron turned around wearily. “Hey, what is it?”
“Oh please call me Gemma,” she said.
“Perfect! Glad we’re in agreement.”
can, I should, too. He  hasn’t even—“
“That’s hardly relevant right now.”
“Tell Granger that. I wouldn’t have suggested wasting a perfectly good bottle of
“Only masochists become prefects, you know?”
“Hi,” he replied nervously and cursed himself for not listening to McGonagall.
“If I were you and he was anyone else, I’d recruit him to the team immediately. Though maybe it’s all a bit too much, I think he’s not having the easiest time adjusting to school as is, but you know that of course, I see you already giving him special attention…”
“I don’t know, Potter. Remind me next time I get caught in your orbit of destruction.”
“Nervous without me, Potter?” Malfoy whispered with a smirk.
“Not in the cauldron, you heathen!” Harry was about to argue more, but Malfoy just turned away from him. “Turn the heat down now, Goyle, and hurry with the snake fang paste or this will end in disaster. Thickener now, Potter. Yes, that’s the mixture you’re holding. Thank you. Merlin. The dandelion, now.” Malfoy was so much more aggravating in higher doses. He had no idea how Goyle and Crabbe could stand it.
She didn’t look up when he approached her table. “Er, hey,” he said and didn’t know how to continue. What was he
His dreams within grasping distance, and Draco had already preemptively and thoroughly mucked it all up.
“Aww, does poor little Draco get cold tootsy-wootsies?”
“Ah, well I can assure you that you’ll meet many people here who share that sentiment.”
“A Gryffindor’s second best in potions? Good for her. And sure, why not. If it’s useful to you.”
“I’ll take a watch. No,” he said, interrupting Draco’s protest before it could even begin. “You look knackered. Get some sleep. I’ll just grab my wand and head outside,” and there it was. The moment Draco truly had been dreading. Potter blinked at him expectantly but Draco watched as the expression melted into confusion. “Draco, where’s my wand?” Potter asked and Draco would’ve liked the chance to enjoy his name coming from Potter’s mouth but there was no time as Potter’s lips set into a thin, stern line. “Where is it?”
“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!”
“Yes, Genealogy and Anthropology,” he said eventually, sitting up straight in his chair and lifting his glass too. Hermione’s eyebrows shot up.
“It is customary for the Headmaster to extend his personal congratulations to the new Head Boy and Girl for their exemplary contribution to Hogwarts,” Snape began and Draco raised an eyebrow. “You have both been chosen as you represent the ideals of this school – hard-working, studious, the best of your year–”
! Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?” she asked, turning to face Draco. He glanced at Hermione, whose chin quivered.
’!” he said, remembering Hermione's earlier announcement. Ron flushed pink, even to the very tips of his ears, and Hermione smiled.
“He didn’t want to say goodbye,” he told them both and Hermione sniffled, pressing a shaking hand to her mouth to stifle the sobs. Ron cleared his throat, blinking rapidly.
“Alright. Hey, if you want to get some sleep, why don’t you use my bunk?” Potter suggested and Draco suddenly wanted to crawl into that bed and cocoon himself in Potter’s lingering warmth but forced himself to shake his head.
It smelled of Albus.
“Lucius, stop,” she told him firmly and he waved her away, sending his crystal tumbler crashing to the floor, where it shattered. He stood up heavily, and the glass crunched underneath his boot.
“A Potter, you mean? And you thought my name was bad…”
“How’d you do?” Hermione asked, and Malfoy shrugged again.
“Wait - you saw You-Know-Who?” Ron said, and Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. After all this time, Ron still insisted on never calling Voldemort by his actual name, even though he was very much dead this time.
“Now,” Bellatrix crooned, as if telling very naughty children that she was disappointed in them, “I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again. Where’s Cissy?” she asked Draco who grinned at her.
“-ARSE-”
They sat in silence for what seemed like hours. Blaise came and joined them, sitting on Draco’s other side, and they watched as Neville Longbottom and Oliver Wood brought in more bodies. Some of the injured were being carried in too and Draco saw Ginny Weasley come with one, holding tightly onto the hand of the girl in the stretcher. Ginny looked up and over at them as Pomfrey worked, and she gave Draco a nod, her jaw tight, but then she turned back to the girl who spoke again. There was a tenuous sort of peace, which was fractured by the sound of the Dark Lord ’s magically enhanced voice.
“The silver doe!” he said excitedly and Draco pressed a hand over his eyes in embarrassment. “Was that you too?”
There was only one portrait that remained mostly serene, directly behind the Headmaster’s desk. Albus Dumbledore, his long beard nearly down to his knees, was crying silently. Painted silver tears slid from behind his half-moon spectacles and he looked at Harry with pride and gratitude, enough to fill Draco’s heart. Beside him, Ron sniffed and rubbed his nose roughly on the back of his sleeve while Hermione wiped her tears from her cheeks and gave a small bob of a curtsey, awkward, as the Headmasters and Headmistresses continued their standing ovation.
Though the boys seemed to enjoy having him around, Draco had not been able to comfort them after their nightmares, during the days following their kidnapping - in the dark, he had looked too much like Lucius, which had caused both boys to rear back in fear. Harry had given him apologetic smiles and comforting kisses, but it still stung, and it hurt even worse to hear them sob and cry and not even be able to comfort them.
“They’re going to get us all killed. Harry needs to tell them, we need to go. He’s fighting off another vision, I can tell,” he told her and she shrugged one shoulder.
“Like Dumbledore’s was for Potter?” he asked and he noticed Snape twitch infinitesimally at their names. Draco catalogued his reaction – it was
“You didn’t know what that mark was until a minute ago,” Draco pointed out with a sneer and Weasley looked like he wanted to smack him, though he resisted.
“I don’t believe it! Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed–” she was saying and as Draco appeared she stopped speaking. They both stood on either side of the campfire, as though circling each other in a fight. Hermione’s eyes were bloodshot and her lower lip was trembling and Potter looked like he was one second away from breathing fire, he was so infuriated.
“My father can barely walk in a straight line these days, and his wand was destroyed in that fight, so he’s not exactly having fun,” he snapped back and Potter froze.
“I would’ve come sooner but you were hard to track. I left Hogwarts after – well, things have changed. We’ve been… made to practise spells on each other. Dark spells,” he admitted slowly, cautiously, and Potter made a noise of outrage.
“From Dumbledore’s office, actually. I Summoned it soon before the summer holidays started,” she admitted and he gave her a concerned look, though part of him wanted to laugh at the sheer audacity of it. He remembered the gaps in the shelving in Snape’s office and wondered if those were the spaces for the books she had Summoned.
“Oh, right… Hermione,” Potter said but his eyes flickered over to the chest of drawers where he had last heard Draco. “I think she wants me to go upstairs with her,” he said and Granger nodded, as though steeling herself.
“If it’s between you and the Dark Lord, Potter, I’m…. well, I’m on your side,” he said and Potter looked a bit stunned, his mouth falling slack. He shook his head, clearing away his expression and Draco only glared at him. “I am! Even if I have to throw my lot in with the blood traitor and a Mud– Muggle-born,” he said and Potter’s eyes took on a glint that Draco had only ever seen in Quidditch games – determination. Fearlessness. “I have lived this whole summer with Him in my home, Potter, and I am – I’m scared,” he admitted and Potter’s gaze relaxed.
“He’s with us, Nev,” Ron said, stepping forward and laying a hand on Neville’s shoulder. “He’s on our side,”
His other friendships had grown as well. Hermione, now a high-ranking Ministry official, poised to become Minister for Magic in the next election, often visited them at Hogwarts in the intervening years, and she and Draco exchanged many letters on various academic articles. Ron had actually completed the full three years of Auror training, spent two years revolutionising the Auror department and then left, preferring to join his brother at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, where Draco occasionally consulted on potions. Draco often sent boxes of contraband items taken from students back to the shop, much to George’s delight.
“They’re safe,” he told Ron, who had looked around in alarm. Bill shucked his travelling cloak, draping it over one arm. “It’s lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts, they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she’s safe too.” He surveyed the group and then looked somewhere behind Draco’s left shoulder. Draco looked up and over, and noticed Potter standing there, leaning against the door frame.
Another dream, though this one felt different. He didn’t feel numb like he had in the others – instead, he felt warm, like he had just stepped into a cosy room.
“Mibby, please be fetching some sandwiches and drinks for Master Draco,” he asked the house-elf Draco had met on his first visit. She gave him a concerned look but then nodded and went to one of the counters. Dobby made his way to stand in front of Draco and snapped his fingers. With a
“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” she told the school primly, and shouts and cheers erupted from the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables. There was a rustle of noise from the Gryffindor table and Draco looked to see Potter edging his way slowly along it, eyes scanning the table. He tapped Blaise on the shoulder and pointed – Blaise nodded and they wound their way around the tables, heading for Gryffindor.
“I need to get cleaned up,” Hermione murmured, more to herself than anyone else. “I told him that was an Erumpent horn, didn’t I?” she suddenly snapped to the air and Weasley and Potter groaned next to her. “I
“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus, let’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and the
“No, not that school Sir. It was very exclusive, invitation only to apply, that sort of thing,” Hermione explained quickly before he summoned the Gordonstoun applicant, and Longshaw blinked but otherwise looked mollified by the explanation.
“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?” Ron said and Harry blinked at him.
“You thought you did, but you were wrong,” Harry said and the crowd around them stirred, as though awoken from a trance. A gasp rose in the air, and held there.
“Got put in Kingsley’s team, battled some Death Eaters, fought off some spiders… Watched Lupin go down. I was just about to get blasted out of one of the windows when You-Know-Who told them to stand down,” he said and Draco nodded. “What about you? Where’s Potter?” Blaise asked and Draco turned to point.
“Not used to all this fresh air, Pansy,” he said casually, forcing his face to relax into a familiar smirk. It felt forced on his face now, and his muscles twitched, unused to what had been his daily mask before. He turned to face Crabbe and Goyle Senior, who frowned at him. “I think I’m about ready to go home,”
“The locket?” he asked and Potter hummed to himself. Would all conversations in this dreamscape be this disjointed? The scene around him wavered slightly, as though Potter was changing the landscape around them, and Draco closed his eyes for a second. Potter mumbled something that Draco couldn’t quite make out.
“I wanted to go in the maze,” she whined and her father made a shushing sound.
“Potter, it can’t be any more dangerous than having the Dark Lord skulking about your house for the entire summer holiday,” he said and Potter rolled his eyes. Draco’s hands tightened on the mug, the heat almost searing his palms. “I’ve spent the last six months of my life living in abject terror every day. I’ve been made to torture people. I’ve been made to sit quietly at dinner as he rambled on about how he was going to kill you. I have been spat at, and kicked, and threatened, and, by Merlin, whatever you’re doing here is not going to be anywhere near as dangerous as that,” he spat and Potter looked shocked, his eyes wide, the green bright against the winter that surrounded them.
A soft rap on his door caused Draco to unfurl himself from his seat by the window and pad to the door. He cracked it open and his mother was waiting there for him, her back turned to the door – it was a habit they had all adopted. Don’t leave your back unguarded to the hallways, lest a stray jinx be sent your way.
“Yes. I had to Apparate outside the wards though,” he said and Draco shrugged.
“Me too, Professor!” little Astoria Greengrass added and then Blaise called from behind Draco.
Instead, he lay back and stared up at the dark canopy over his bed and when Ollivander began to scream, Draco didn’t bother to brush away the tears.
“Ravenclaws, follow on!” and the younger years of the Ravenclaw table stood and were escorted from the hall. There were a few tearful goodbyes, older siblings hugged their younger brothers and sisters and waved as they followed on from the Slytherins. The Hufflepuffs went next and then finally, the Gryffindors, which barely shifted in their seats.
He had found him.
“Grab one!” he shouted, pointing at the pair of heavy broomsticks in a pile of junk. Ron grabbed one and straddled it, pulling Hermione on behind him, and Harry did the same, Draco winding his arms around Harry’s waist as the burning world below them fell away.
“I’m sorry,” he eventually said after a few minutes of Draco glowering at him. “I don’t know… I don’t know what I can say to you,” he said and Draco scowled.
Potter trudged grudgingly back through the snow as Draco reached Granger, crouching down beside her.
“How about your dear cousin, Malfoy?” Rowle sneered across the table. Draco felt his shoulders tighten, but didn’t say anything in response, picking at the flakes of salmon on his plate. A jeer from further down the table distracted Rowle and he looked away. Draco let out the breath he had been holding.
to attend,” he explained and Ron wrinkled his nose.
“You want us to leave?” Potter guessed and Draco thought that sounded like a fantastic idea, to leave this stinking house with it’s mute occupant and go home, but Bathilda shook her head and pointed at Potter, then herself, and then the ceiling.
!” he shouted and without thinking, Draco pushed Hermione down to the floor and lay over her, the green bolt of the spell zipping over his head with millimeters to spare.
“Can we go up?” he asked and if the gargoyle had been able to shrug, it would have.
He found the stream not too far away and crouched down next to it, sticking his hands in first. It was piercingly cold and his fingers instantly ached with it, but he splashed the water up his arms and then cupped some in his hands and splashed his face with it.
"So you did," Harry said and Malfoy made a small noise. "I'll leave you to it. If you want anything washed, just leave it by the door. We have an Elf, Dinky, who comes in every morning to do some laundry and a general tidy," he explained, slowly heading for the door, but Malfoy called him back.
The house tables had been replaced, the bodies of the dead, which came to over fifty, were laid out where the top table had been. Voldemort’s body had been roughly moved into another room, away from the grieving, who Harry had dutifully spoken to. He held their hands as they cried, listened to their stories and their sorrow, all without flinching. Draco kept an eye on him, but had to speak to his parents.
It was a beautiful thing to behold. The moment was broken by Granger finishing her work and tilting her head down to meet his gaze, which made her frown.
“So you don’t believe it then?” Weasley asked from behind him and Draco kept his eyes trained on his book, even as his shoulders tightened.
To see their names and the short span of their lives engraved onto cold stone made Draco feel breathless. Tears pricked in the corner of his eyes and he wiped them away as Potter began to speak, reciting the last line of the inscription.
“Actually we were just catching up, Fellow Longshaw. We attended the same secondary school together,” she explained, giving Harry a quick glance. Longshaw’s robe wasn’t piped with purple which marked the Magical Fellows from their Muggle counterparts, so they had to be careful what they said.
“Er – what – ?” Ron asked, confused, and Draco echoed the sentiment. He must’ve only been asleep for a few minutes at that, but it felt like he had missed an entire conversation.
“Yes, it did,” Harry admitted. “You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done… think, and try for some remorse, Riddle…”
They drifted into silence. Fleur came out of the kitchen with a plate of sandwiches which she put on the squat table in the middle of the room. She pointed her wand at the fireplace and the driftwood fire came to life, sending a wave of warmth over all of them.
Malfoy had been given potions to drink and pills to take and then two weeks later, Harry had come home to find him knelt by the bath tub in the second floor bathroom, lazily drawing patterns on the waters surface.
“I love you too. I have to go,” Harry replied quietly and Draco thought about fighting, thought about convincing him to stay, but he could only nod.
“Dinner, Draco,” she murmured over her shoulder, her long hair falling over one shoulder. She was remarkably beautiful in her own way, his mother, but the stress of this summer had turned her skin sallow and her hair lank. Though not as badly as it had affected his father.
“There are always whispers. I don’t believe anything I hear these days,” Draco told Blaise, who slumped back on the sofa, long legs kicked out in front of him. They slipped into silence. Around them the common room was humming with activity, friends reunited after a summer apart, first-years trying to find an out-of-the-way corner where they wouldn’t be eaten alive by the older students, Crabbe and Goyle watching Draco darkly from near the bookshelves. It was suffocating, claustrophobic. Draco pushed himself out of the armchair, and Pansy’s eyebrows shot up into her hairline.
They re-entered the wards to hear the rhythmic ‘
"An old family - probably one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, or a branch of one. Someone to whom family history, and an heir, would be highly important," he explained and Ginny nodded, picking a few files out of the various ones dotted around the room. She passed them around, until everyone but Harry and Malfoy had a few files sat on their laps.
The night sky was lighter, though not by much, and he joined Bill Weasley where he stood, watching Potter who was digging in a patch of ground that overlooked the sea. Bill looked around at him as he came closer, but turned back to watch Potter.
The last days of autumn slipped away as October became November and the tent was cold at night. Draco bundled himself up in layers of t-shirts and jumpers, but he still shivered in his sleeping bag, and he would wake in the morning to light layers of frozen dew on the tent. It was slow to bounce up and fold away now, whatever charm had been on it fading with time. He had been away from Hogwarts for nearly three weeks now, and he was no closer to finding Potter and Granger.
. Granger whipped her wand out and a bang went off, a flash of red light flaring as the snake was bodily lifted off Potter, who was wheezing on the floor, and slammed into the wardrobe at the back of the room, which caved under its weight.
“He wasn’t a coward,” Father slurred, taking uneven steps towards Draco, leaning heavily on his chair and then reaching for Draco’s, stumbling that last final bit. He leaned down over his son, his hair swinging forward, until they were nearly touching foreheads. Draco pressed himself back into the armchair, his breathing shallow. “He was a good son, he followed–”
“When did this start?!” Weasley asked, looking put-out but not furious. Draco sipped at his wine.
He laid the materials out in a pyramid shape and then dragged over some logs to form seating around the campfire, like they had done in Wychwood. He was just about to strike a match when Potter reappeared from the tent and studied his work.
"They're missing, Hermione," Harry murmured, sounding very lost, and Hermione made a soft, pained noise.
Help.
Death Eaters by any other name would smell as sweet.
?” Longbottom asked and Harry gave him an apologetic school, lifting a hand to rub at the scar on his forehead. His eyes closed involuntarily, tightening for a second as if in pain.
“There you are!” Hermione said with a smile as they finally got close, and the circle of adults and children widened to let them in. Much like Harry, her hair was beginning to show signs of silver running through it, and Ron’s as well. Hugo, Ron and Hermione’s son, was pinned in place by his father’s arm across his chest, and he had a familiar wild look in his eyes, like he was about to dart away and lose himself in the crowd. Rose, their daughter, lingered with Tatiana by her trolley, their heads bowed together as they talked. Rose was another new first-year and she had the same amount of precociousness as her mother had at the same age. Draco was already dreading her first Potions lesson.
“Thank you for bringing it over Rachel. I’ll make sure you don’t receive anything else for me,” he said and she bobbed her head in acknowledgement and then left him to it. Harry sighed and finished scribbling out his request list, dropping it on the small tray on a shelf in the room and turning to the parcel while he waited for the books to be sent up.
"Long and blonde - but you don't think-," Ron began, his eyebrows shooting up towards his hairline, but Malfoy stood up, breaking the connection of his and Harry's hands. Harry looked up at him, and he was white, all blood drained from his face and he looked down at Harry with a terrified glance. He ran to the office door and threw it open, shouting to the room at large.
Fenrir Greyback rounded on her, his eyes glinting yellow in the starlight. “Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if he’s on my list,” Greyback said in such a way that it sent chills up Draco’s spine. He craned his neck to look and Greyback took a step closer to Hermione who recoiled, looking terrified. “Delicious girl… What a treat… I do enjoy the softness of the skin…”
“I do?” he asked. Draco snatched up one of the folded blankets that Potter hadn’t used and smacked him on the arm with it.
“Before you know it, Taitana Krum, you will have more friends than you can count. That’s the beauty of Hogwarts,” he told her and while she didn’t look entirely convinced, she nodded, a touch mollified. Draco straightened. “Harry’s on the train if you’d like to say hello, Ginny,” he offered, and she nodded.
“Fine. Lead the way,” he said, settling the backpack straps over his shoulders. She nodded and turned on her heel, setting off deeper into the forest, Draco following along behind her.
!” behind them.
There had always been a chance that Harry would die. To think otherwise had been foolish. It was always going to be one or the other. But now, Draco couldn’t imagine a life without Harry in it. A life in which they grew old together. To have a future without that… Draco didn’t know if he could survive it.
“Yeah – on the upside, we got the Horcrux!” he said cheerily, flexing one of his hands where new skin was reforming. “On the downside…”
“It does not
“Death Eaters did this!” Ron bellowed, pointing at his brothers. “Your people did this!” he shouted and Draco pushed himself forward, emotion swelling inside of him.
With a great cry, it flapped once more and took off from the lake edge, rising higher and higher into the sky until it was swallowed by the waking stars.
“It could be?” Draco said and his father turned to scowl at it.
“Yes, you too,” he said and then he gave them a final smile before squeezing between them and exiting the building, his hair shining gold for a second in the doorway.
“Dobby can do that, Master Draco,” he said firmly and he nodded once, his bat ears flapping. “Master Draco can count on Dobby, sir. And when the time comes, Dobby can get Master Draco out of the castle.”
“It isn’t, actually. Harry pulled it out of the Sorting Hat in his second year,” she said and Draco nearly laughed again. He turned to Potter, who had gone a bit pink.
“Well enough, I hope. One of my questions was to translate a passage of ancient Mermish, and I might have mixed up the past participle with the past perfect, but otherwise…,” he shrugged one shoulder and Hermione nodded. “Yourselves?” he asked politely and Hermione launched into a blow-by-blow walkthrough of her Law paper, leaving Harry to contemplate whether he could have written more about the work of George Ripley while answering question 62. As Hermione launched into an explanation about her third answer, Harry stood, interrupting her.
“Gryffindor Golden Boy, of course you do!” he said and Potter laughed, lifting one hand to shield himself, the other shielding the porridge balanced in his lap. Draco dropped the blanket and smoothed it over his lap. “You make me want to, at least,” he admitted quietly and Potter’s smile faded a little. Draco looked up and caught his gaze and for a second it felt as though the snow outside had cut off the world and it was just them in that moment, Potter’s gaze hopeful and Draco’s longing and –
They Disapparated from Shell Cottage and landed on the London street outside the Leaky Cauldron. The city was just waking up and red double-decker buses zipped by, taxis following in their wake. Muggles walked past them, and if any of them had seen three people appear out of thin air, none of them mentioned it.
Harry had answered his first two questions and was reading the rest of the questions on the General II exam before him. Sat a few rows ahead of him, he could just see the curve of Malfoy’s spine as he leaned low over his desk, and Harry thought if he listened hard enough, he could make out the scratch of Malfoy’s pen above the others, though he was probably lying to himself about that.
“Want to talk about it?” Ron asked, and Harry thought for a second. At Hogwarts, he had spent so long trying not to burden anyone with his nightmares that he had let some very important people down - and even got Sirius killed. It still stung, that one, even after all this time.
“No. I will not do this here. I have to – we have to do this, now, or it will never end,” he told her quietly and she studied his face for a second and nodded. Draco reached out a hand for Harry, who took it and pulled him close.
!” he hissed and the owl swooped out of the tip of his wand, letting out a shrill shriek that pierced the night. The Death Eaters whirled around, some of them calling out to their fellow members. But too late, because Potter’s silver stag came galloping as well, head lowered, its antlers outstretched. The owl clicked her beak at it, and it shook its antlers in return.
“Surely you can see that she’s just trying to survive, Draco,” Snape hissed, leaning forward in his chair so suddenly that Draco flinched back. One corner of Snape’s mouth was raised in a sneer. “After the events of June, she–”
! She’s mine!”
"Boys," he said thickly, his voice croaking with emotion. "This is your father, Draco," he said and both boys turned to look at Draco, as if seeing him for the first time. Albus flung an arm around his neck first and dragged him down, and Draco wrapped a shaking arm around his son, pulling him close. Scorpius tilted himself too and tucked himself in close to Draco, sobbing but with a slight smile on his face.
“He shouldn’t have snapped,” he whispered to her and Granger shook her head, tendrils of borrowed mousy brown hair breaking free from the low bun Granger had tied it in.
, Harry would reflect later. Every day he returned to Malfoy Manor after spending the morning with Hermione at Grimmauld Place, and Draco would greet him enthusiastically and kiss him, before handing him books relevant to his research, and they would spend the rest of the afternoon sat in comfortable silence reading, trading the occasional kiss when passing books over for the other to read interesting passages. If Mrs Malfoy thought anything strange was going on, she never mentioned it, but she started to smile broadly whenever Harry appeared on her doorstep, and Harry came to enjoy seeing her eyes wrinkle in the corners as she smiled.
“If you couldn’t make it out, Harry, how can you be sure?” Hermione shot back, and Potter seemed to wilt a little. As much as Draco wanted to support Potter, he had to agree with Hermione – if there was no proof, that was it.
