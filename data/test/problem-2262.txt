“You didn’t tell me that was bothering you.” Draco said, linking their fingers as they walked unnoticed down the bustling corridor.
Thanks to everyone for reading and leaving kudos and for your kind, thoughtful comments! One exam down one to go! Appreciate your patience with me a massive amount.
“You think I wouldn’t have acted the same?” Harry asked, “You think seeing you strangled and unconscious would make me act
Draco’s thumb grazed his cheekbone in a slow, deliberate fashion. “And you can feel me touching your face?”
“Twice a day, morning and evening for two weeks,” she clarified, looking at him expectantly “He can manage the active aspect himself, but I expect you to help him through his range of movement exercises, like so—lie back, Mr. Malfoy, if you would.”
“I know, baby,” Harry soothed, rubbing a gentle hand over Draco’s burning arse. “We’re all done with that. You were so strong, so brave, I’m terribly proud of you.” He leaned in, kissing the inflamed skin reverently. “So so good,” he repeated. He slid his hand back between Draco’s thighs to cup his prick. He squeezed softly, jerking and stroking slowly, until there was a flicker of response.
As if summoned by his words, a broad-faced, blond witch appeared. She wore clothes Harry could barely begin to describe: black trousers that appeared loose and billowing from thigh to mid-calf, where they sharply tapered and clung tightly down to her ankles. Her spotless white top was more geometry than attire, a stark inverted triangle from shoulders to navel, her tanned sides exposed. On her feet were aggressively yellow deck shoes.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek contemplatively. “I don’t know,” he said, despising the idea with everything in him. “I guess I could give an interview. I will if it makes things safer for you.”
“Malfoy, what happened?” Harry repeated, more authority to his voice this time. It unnerved him to see Malfoy like this. Despite the destruction of his family’s reputation post-war, he had arrived for eighth year with his head held high, smooth mask of superiority in place and enough friends to level him some protection—apparently not enough.
Draco turned and examined the man’s face. He didn’t look curious or keen at the exciting diagnosis like some healers had. He didn’t appear to be plotting or calculating Scorpius’ worth to the right buyers. No, Potter looked distraught, concerned for Scorpius’ welfare. His dark brows were curled inwards, tucking under the straight line of the black frame of his clubmasters. His mouth was pursed with the gravity of it all. Potter wanted, Draco realised suddenly, to
“I know you didn’t,” Harry sighed, giving Clark’s hand a little squeeze where it lay on his arm. “But Draco knows the tricks my healer’s taught me to help me get through it, and so we got through it. You're safe and I'm sorted and that's what matters.”
“Maybe,” Harry said, uncertainly. “I think I should pursue this publicist idea. I don’t know where to start with all that, though. Would your mother know?”
your social clout, not skirt it. I am not entirely sure how you’re going to survive the world outside Hogwarts, sometimes. You’ve no idea what to do with people at all.”
“We think…” Harry started carefully, “that some DA members are getting aggressive—physically so—with some Slytherins. You two are closer to most of them now anyway, do you know anything about it?”
To Harry surprise, Malfoy didn’t argue, just shuffled down the bed and flipped over. “Fine,” he muttered into the crossed arms he slid under his face, “Just so not hard. And for fuck’s sake use some lotion.”
Ron stared at Draco’s hand as though it might sprout fangs, but with some hesitation, he clasped it in his own.
“Right,” Harry swallowed. “Well. I’m wondering now if Ginny was trying to convince herself—and me too, I suppose—that she was happy when really she wasn’t. The further out I get, the more I realise that she wasn’t happy at all. In fact, I believe she was profoundly miserable. And all I want to know is when she started feeling that way, and what caused it, and why on earth she thought she couldn't tell me. Sorry, are you sure you don’t mind hearing about all this?”
“But you’ve forgiven him?” Hermione asked, flashing her eyes at Ron. Harry knew his best mate was charged and ready to go off about Malfoy at the slightest signal from Harry, but he didn’t want that.
“Do you want me to make a statement?” Harry repeated, “Confirm we’re together? You’d think taking you out for a Valentine's Day meal would be sufficient, but I guess not.”
“Exactly!” Harry said. “Is that what you want? Do we even like the same things? I can’t even talk to you about half the things you're keen on!”
His stomach lurched as he thought back to that final night, the pure terror on Malfoy’s face as he tried and failed to rescue Crabbe. Harry could still feel Malfoy’s arms clutched impossibly tight around his waist, his screams for Harry to get them to safety before he buried his face in Harry’s shoulder to avoid the billowing smoke.
Malfoy pinched his thigh and pulled back, looking up at Harry, almost hurt, “I...I only like nice names,” he insisted, quietly.
Potter gave an exasperated sigh. “So much for ‘don’t interrupt me’,” he said dryly. He turned his head and shouted down the hall. “In the sunroom!”
“You mean Remy?” Lily said. “No one calls him Remus because that was Teddy’s dad. He died in the war, but Dad doesn’t like to talk about things like that, so I don’t know much about the first Remus.”
tore through me. I was a useful little pawn for controlling my parents, wasn’t I?  And you think a bedsheet with some mean words would leave me shaken? Merlin, you really are unbelievable.” His pale face was pink with rage, icy eyes narrowed with distrust.
Draco’s heart plummeted to his feet. Shaking, he turned. He realised distantly that his face was wet with tears he didn’t remember having fallen.
“Oh,” Harry gasped when Draco shifted to kiss his strong, stubbled jaw. “Fuck, you might have said!”
With his free hand, Harry lazily slapped the tawse upwards, striking where he knew Draco’s scars to be congregated. He felt the prick in his hand lurch and he grinned into Draco’s shoulder blade.
Clark just now.  Worry gnawed at Harry’s every thought, as he ran through mental what-ifs. What if Draco had failed the dreadful Arithmancy assignment and was anxious over N.E.W.T.s and his future? What if something had happened to his mother? What if
“What if I don’t want that sort of power?” Draco whispered, lifting his face away from his hands. Harry’s body stilled, and he didn’t reply, so Draco continued, words tripping out of him: “What if I don’t want to be able to stop you? What if I want those decisions left to you? I trust you. I know you won’t overdo it. I just...I don’t—”
Clark sought him out before lunch that Friday, all but shoving him into an empty classroom. His bony arms were crossed and he was glowering, but Harry had a feeling the boy was more scared than anything.
Ginny rolled her eyes, “Merlin, Harry, you really are dense. You think we did this for you?” She was more amused than irritated. “You’re not our commander, you know. We are all students here. We all care what happens. You were busy. If we needed help, we would have asked for it. We’re all perfectly aware you had your own business—” at this, she cocked her head towards Malfoy, still propped nonchalantly against the wall at the back of the room, “to attend to. We needed you to be a figurehead just now, and you were. Duties managed.”
“So, we need to look into Legilimency on non-human creatures and summoning spectres, is that correct?” Malfoy said, sitting back and allowing his words to take on a more businesslike quality. Hermione was jotting down ideas on a slip of parchment.
“You know,” Clark said, “Like I’ve done to you a couple of times, with Occlumency. I left my amulet in my room, and honestly it was ages before she showed, but eventually she took the bait. Hopped in my head to convince me of this or that, and I just held her there ‘til dawn so she couldn’t get at anyone else. And it worked right? She can’t be in two places at once. I mean, there was that one day at the quidditch pitch when she got at everyone, but she had her mum's help with that. And besides, she says she has to be right mad for big pushes and sometimes she can’t muster it. Says people have always accused her of being moody, and apparently that didn’t change with death. I said I thought that was a good bit of self-reflection and she said she doesn’t have much else to do, except get angry and think about her feelings. I think she might be lonely, really.”
“Has this...happened before?” Draco ventures, setting the teacup on a saucer and sliding it towards Clark, a biscuit balanced on the lip of the little plate.
“Oh,” Draco remarked, shifting onto his side to look at Harry fully. “You said you were there that night. When Dumbledore was killed. Did you mean it?”
Fort pulled one foot out from under Ri’s leg and used it to give her friend a playful shove. “We can’t all just fawn like Jamie,” she pointed out. “Then you’d be even more insufferable than you already are.”
“Because you said I had a home with you, and if there is no you then what happens to me? Especially when it’s the only one I have since Mum just wrote and said she doesn’t think it’s a good idea for me to come home for Easter or maybe even summer because she’s apparently in a really good place right now and she doesn’t want me to mess that up. Well, that’s not what she said exactly but I know that’s what she meant. And I don’t know what I’m supposed to take from the fact that even just seeing me is disruptive enough to send my mother to the psych ward, especially when I really do try to be fucking quiet and helpful and keep Jared out of her hair but it’s not enough, I’m not—”
“Scor!” he cried out suddenly. Harry looked up from the sink to see Scorpius stumble into the kitchen. He looked horribly bedraggled: pale and brittle as chalk. His father stood behind him, lips pursed unhappily.
“I’m joking, Harry, no need to look so forlorn. Why would I want to sit alone listening to parents and their offspring fret over robes, parchment, and quills?”
“Alright, so the cottage is furnished and the basics are supplied, that is handy. We can leave all the kitchenware and whatnot here at the house, then,” he remarked. “Besides clothing and bedding, we’ll just need school supplies, Remy’s things, and whatever Lily wants with her in Hogsmeade.” He turned his attention back to his daughter. “Some books and things, sweetpea? A few favourite toys? Does that sound nice?”
for being such a committed friend and editor! Thanks for catching my failures in tense usage and my repetitive language!
Clark seemed to bite back a grin. “I guess I ought not to lose so much sleep over it just yet,” he relented.
want Tiering to give Quidditch a shot, if only to get the kid some friends. He also had a secondary motivation: proving Malfoy wrong. The student body was not just going to fall to pieces because Harry existed.
He reached out. He didn’t know why he’d assumed there would be just one neat line bisecting Malfoy’s chest. He should have thought: His magic had been wild and desperate, not orderly and precise, and the silvery slash marks on Malfoy’s skin reflected that. It looked like he’d been ravaged by some wild animal with unforgiving claws. Harry traced the worst of the lot, which began just above Malfoy’s left hip bone almost to a hair below his outer clavicle. Malfoy hissed at the touch, arching so as to push more firmly into the curious pads of Harry’s fingers.
Harry laughed, “It is a bit nebulous. Doesn’t matter. I’m glad you’re alright. Please stay alright, if you could.”
“Well, you lot weren’t making any effort to keep quiet. I was doing you a favour, really, making sure no one sneaked up on you.”
“I never say no to a Honeydukes’ hot cocoa,” Hermione smiled, releasing his arm with an affectionate squeeze.
PS. if you are a British English speaker and would like to be pestered with Brit picking questions from time to time, please let me know?? Google sometimes is so unsatisfying. (My discord is umbrellaless#0352)
Harry placed another kiss above Draco’s eyebrow, precious Draco, the hope of his household. He thought about Narcissa Malfoy's eyes that night, demanding to know that Draco lived. Maybe it was the Firewhiskey, but it all became quite clear.
“And I can just do that? Leave it suspended there, unnamed?” Harry questioned, there was a note of frustrated frenzy in his voice that he knew must make him sound far too high strung.
Draco quirked a perfect blond eyebrow. “I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. I’m a model houseguest,” he proclaimed.
“He’s been a bit unsettled since the whole running away thing. I think he got worried that we’d disown him or something, not that we have any official claim to him or anything. But any time he jokes around with us he kind of backtracks like he’s worried if he steps out of line we’ll ditch him. And telling him that we’re not going anywhere doesn’t totally seem to help.”
Harry couldn’t think of words to respond, so he pressed a kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth, sliding his forehead against the other boy's temple.
“Ron, you know as well as anyone Malfoy’s motivations. I doubt you would have done differently if it was your mum’s life at stake.”
Harry expected a terse remark about not needing an au pair, but to his surprise, Malfoy just agreed, “Yeah, alright. Probably best to keep him busy, anyway.”
“Next time,” Harry said and felt a glow of anticipation when Malfoy simply nodded his agreement. “So, ah, how have you been?” Harry tried, supposing they should do at least some small talk. “Anything new?”
have that. I’m alright, okay? I’m still mad and such, about Mum, but it’s getting better, a bit. So, like, calm down, yeah?”
Draco gave a great, loud sigh and crossed the distance between them. He took Harry’s collar loosely in his hands and fussed with it. “Oh, don’t you dare, Potter. I’m not blaming you for your reaction, you know that’s not what I meant. I certainly don’t want an apology.”
“A bit,” Draco agreed, maintaining a board straight line from his knees to the crown of his head. Harry saw how much the other boy needed this: clear rules, objectives he could achieve.
The idea of Molly discovering Harry had already had someone new in his bed, that it was Malfoy of all people, and not even three months after Gin had walked out, well—Harry might lose the family’s good regard forever if they learned about that. Even still, he knew the threat of that wouldn’t stop him from seeing the other man again.
He turned in early, his gaze bouncing between Draco’s bed and his own. He’d not slept in his own bed for over a month and he found he didn’t want to. He knew he’d get odd looks in the morning, crawling out of Malfoy’s bed with the other boy nowhere to be seen, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. His head ached and he was alone. He curled around Draco’s pillow and breathed in the faint, sweet smell of grapefruit.
He found himself standing in the great entrance. The Hufflepuff quidditch team burst through the castle doors, making Harry jump.
Scorpius was a little less enthused. The idea of all those hexes zipping around made him nervous. He tried to shake the sensation off. The Ravenclaw second-years might be diligent, but they were always fair, and surely Professor Potter would put an end to any spells that managed to land. Besides, it was important to Scorpius that he succeed in all his studies, especially Defence. He wanted to be ready if anyone ever came for him again. He shuddered in the warm air, trying to force back the memories of strong hands clamping onto him in the disorienting darkness. If Father hadn’t heard him—
Draco shuddered at that. He’d been with men who liked that sort of thing before, grovelling and cowering, but he’d never acquiesced. He would not do himself the indignity, not for anyone—anyone who wasn’t Harry, apparently, because Draco realised with perfect clarity begging was exactly what he would be doing tonight.
Looking back at the dormitory, Harry caughts sight of a pale foot reflecting orange light, sticking out from behind the bed at the end of the row. He ran for it, skirting the footboard and finding the lanky boy facedown on the ground.
“Let me help you, hm?” Harry offered. “You come as I say, or not at all. Does that make your decision easier?”
“We’ll talk at lunch, Ron,” he promised his friend, who was still clearly enraged, “I know DA's important to you, but stopping these attacks is important to me. And I think Hermione will agree with me.”
Jamie jogged towards the Entrance Hall, where he’d seen Scorpius heading moments before, but stopped short when he saw that the boy was, as ever, in Al’s company.
“You heard the man,” Finnegan announced from beside his boyfriend and taking over in that exuberant, dictatorial way of his, “Leave off, keep your eyes in your own head. If anyone deserves a fecking breakdown, it’s Potter.”
“Just enough to identify the finale and know we didn’t have to break the door down to rescue you,” Seamus obliged.
“So good, so good for me, sweetheart,” Harry murmured into the kisses, "you were such a mess for me, weren't you?"
“Decent of you,” Harry said, still in disbelief that they were doing all this for him. “Really. Thank you.”
Again, he led Harry and Clark through a cursory meditation and then Harry went to it, hopping into Clark’s thoughts. Clark immediately cast the counterspell,  and Harry found himself, for the first time with Tiering, in a completely black void.
think you’re incredible, amazing actually. Even when you only communicate in grunts. Even when you torture your brother, and grumble about chores, and refuse to leave the basement.”
“Right,” Harry said, frustrated at his lack of a lead. “Well, thanks for your help. I appreciate it.”
“Oh,” Harry said, “It’s no problem. Er, sure.” He knelt and swept the hair off his forehead. The three boys stared. The littlest one reached out to touch it but one of his brothers batted his hand away.
“Oh,” Harry bit the inside of his cheek. He’d not thought much about it. “Just habit, I guess. Al was a finicky baby. I spent a lot of nights with him fussing in my lap between feedings. So I just started practicing wandless magic, simply for something to do. Moving things about on the wall, sending books from one end of the room to the other. It was all trivial, really, but I suppose I got the knack of it with practice.”
Harry blushed at being found out. He didn’t know if he just liked the warm solidity of Draco’s hand in his—that they’d faced down all that betrayal business and were still standing—or if he was being more demonstrative for the sake of more dubious onlookers. “Is it too much?” he asked.
Potter’s lips parted, about to protest, but the effect the words had on the boy were immediate. James straightened his spine and schooled his expression into one of polite sincerity.
“Clark,” Harry observed, sadly, “Should have expected this. Should I go to him, do you think, or will he want to cry it out on his own?”
“Cheers, mate,” Ron agreed. They sat shoulder to shoulder watching the flicker of the flames in the hearth, and listening to the peaceful crackle of the logs. “Might be the whisky talking, but I’ll miss this.”
The words were barely out of his mouth before Harry had summoned the thing, feeling the sturdy leather handle snap against his palm. It was a broad instrument, thin but firm, with two flattened prongs. Harry felt a rush of confidence realising that Malfoy had considered this, had planned for it. He’d left the Manor hopeful for this very moment. Harry wasn’t about to fuck it up.
Harry eased off a bit, “Sorry, it’s just a bit of a mess in here. Need it to release so it doesn’t happen again, I reckon.”
Harry raised his head from off the pillow. It took a great deal of effort. He yanked on Draco's arm, dragging the other boy close to him and cuddling in contentedly. He smiled as Draco sighed and relaxed into him as though he were making a great sacrifice. It was all a front. Draco
“Well, what did he expect, with that ludicrous haircut!” Draco responded, rifling through his satchel distractedly.
In it, Wilma Brown stood in the entrance hall, just as she had that horrific evening. Draco was there, but instead of protecting first years, behind him was the entire Weasley family, cowering and wandless. Fenrir Greyback was hunched over at Mrs. Brown's feet, feasting on the remains of her daughter. The slick, viscous sounds of Lavender's viscera sliding down the werewolf’s gullet made Harry queasy. Draco’s bones were breaking again, only this time, Harry was watching it happen. He realised all at once he was immobile under his invisibility cloak, Draco’s voice raw with screaming as she snapped each fragile bone in his body. Not just his hands and arms this time, but his feet, his knees. Draco dissolved to the floor as his frame was shattered. The Weasleys’ eyes were on him, George’s gaze cold and unmoved, a thin-lipped smile tugging at his lips as Draco convulsed with pain, a frothy white mess dribbling over his chin.
Fawkes left through the open window he'd flown in through before Harry returned to school. It was bittersweet; Harry had been glad to see him, but knew he wouldn’t stay. He watched the broad fiery wingspan in the faint morning sun until Fawkes was out of sight.
And Harry was right. Clark ought to have put on his slippers. He had lovely slippers. He might even add them to the list of possessions he’d rather not do without. But he’d not thought of that, because he was stupid and he did stupid things like waking Harry and Draco up in the middle of the night for no reason. Because he was scared of nothing but a damned memory. But he had, and now they were both looking at him expectantly and he had to say
“Clark, no!” Harry shouted at once, but it was too late, the scarlet and silver figure emerged and before Atwal could reissue the containment spell, Clark had shouted for her attention.
Corin Bingham did appear to have the right of it. Albus thankfully didn’t see any cages or any trained animals amidst the brightly coloured banners and drapes spanning the Quidditch pitch, and spilling out into the fields beyond. Bleachers had been arranged in front of a makeshift platform at one end, and Headmistress Clearwater was standing with the Head Boy, Sterling Main, and Head Girl, Albus’ cousin Molly.
“Well, I don’t much fancy him walking in here to find me with a great bloody hard-on, either,” Harry grumbled.
Harry shrugged, “It’s hard to know what’s off when I don’t know who’s supposed to be here. Any of the names look familiar?”
“Did I handle that poorly?” Harry mused aloud, “I don’t see how else I was supposed to react, but she seemed awfully upset with me.”
“That’s a very kind offer, I’m sure, but magical wounds can be trickier to heal.” Draco should know; he’d spent some time trying to counter the inflammation the night before.
Lily stepped in close to her father, which did not surprise Draco in the least. He was mostly a stranger to the girl.
Draco sighed and shifted about. Finally he sighed, giving in and resting against Harry's placid body. “Do you forgive me at least?” He muttered.
As they meandered into the nursery, Harry noted that Hermione had already moved a trunk into the room for the baby’s things. As they stepped through the door, Ron grabbed Harry’s forearm. Surprised, Harry looked up.
The sapling of a boy entered the room, chin up, defiance trying to belie his anxiety and uncertainty. Harry again had the impulse to give him a hug.
At last, Draco swung his feet around, placing them on the floor, and stood up. He strode across the room to Tiering, placing both his hands on the boy's shoulders. Clark flinched and looked up at him.
want to do as Harry asked. Making Harry happy seemed suddenly much more important than his own nebulous hesitancies.
“Anything else?” Harry said, as the afternoon drew to a close. He felt satisfied with most of his Christmas purchases, and Clark was still preening in his brilliant orange buffalo plaid wool coat and a freshly cut mohawk of a similar shade. Draco actively winced every time he saw the boy.
“Yeah, but it would be nice to have a win as well, Potter,” said Mathieu from Bristol, slinging his bat over his shoulder.
“In doing so,” she continued, “I sacrificed what I cared about most, darling, which was your safety. I won’t ever forgive myself for that."
“You’d think I’d not need an O in History of Magic, either, but they like overachievers, no matter the subject.”
“You’re deflecting,” Draco pointed out. He appreciated Harry speaking the word aloud, he found: villain. Narcissa had never been half so frank in naming Lucius so. Her warnings had been full of euphemisms and futile attempts to soften reality. ‘Your father has a temper,’ she would say, or ‘mind your father today, pet. He’s in one of his moods.’ As though Lucius’ emotions and behaviour were an act of nature: something one could only weather and endure—never alter. But this new label,
Clark licked his lips, “It’s ancient magic, seems pretty obscure. I tried to look into it at the library but most of the books were in the restricted section.”
“I’ve already said I will, haven’t I? I'll be less reckless, I'll ask for help when I need it. I won't go off tracking down Lavender alone. Happy?”
Hermione filled one of the mugs and passed it to him. Draco took a small sip, then sat back and closed his eyes. He felt Granger’s gaze on him but she didn’t speak. He heard the scrape of her fork against porcelain as she ate her crumble.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry agreed. “It’s not really that I’m worried about. I don’t know how to say this without sounding pervy, because it’s definitely not pervy, and I know that, it just sort of
“Sorry,” Harry said to Malfoy. “You were saying?” He repositioned Remy and looked up. Merlin, how long had it been? There’d been the brief sighting at the Hogwarts Express in the autumn, but Harry hadn’t had a chance to really observe the man then. He was still lean, still pale and blond, and somehow less ferrety, which felt like an injustice. Harry knew he had worcestershire sauce and baby vomit on his shirt, that he’d not showered in maybe three days, and he couldn’t actually remember how long ago he’d bought this particular pair of trousers, but they were certainly fitting more snugly now than they did when he had. Malfoy looked perfectly put together: his clothing smartly pressed, his face an immovable mask of poise, save for the amused quirk of one eyebrow.
“But I don’t expect that of Draco. I never once thought about him waiting at home for me with dinner.”
For a moment Harry thought to turn down the boy’s generosity. After all, it was Teddy’s holiday, and he only had a month off before he’d head back to Germany to continue his magical language studies. But Harry was dead on his feet, with another month of four kids at home facing him, so he accepted the reprieve gratefully.
“Stick to the sides, not the middle, we don’t want to be cut off from the exit!” Harry shouted over the milieu of voices shouting the spell. It wasn't enough. A flash of some terrible flamed beast leaped out, grasping at a nearby Ravenclaw. Harry only just flung them out of the way, shouting, "Gibbens, run up and have Neville send us down another two groups. We're making progress, but not enough! The rest of you fall back!"
“Myrtle?” He called out, feeling foolish. He peeked into the stall containing the cistern she was apt to haunt. “Myrtle, are you in here?”
“Oh, forget him, mate,” Bernard insisted. “He’s just gone and hit puberty a year or two ahead of us mere mortals, but I can still kick his arse, and plan to later. I hear they have a whole room that’s charmed to bounce you off it, and then they charm you to be bouncy too. It’s going to be a riot.”
He dropped the stick at Neville’s feet, then swept back to the other side, taking down another few players as he went.
When the wards went off, Harry was making beans on toast, cradling a fussy Remy to his chest with one hand, and trying not to grind his molars as Al and Jamie screamed at each other in the drawing room over Merlin-knew-what.
“Thank you for telling me that," Harry whispered, pressing his lips to Draco's forehead, "So. Crowding you, crushing you, bossing you. Physical discomfort. Those are all things you like?"
“You want so badly to submit,” Harry explained, “but you’re terrified of giving up control. You say you don’t want to make decisions, but then you set the parameters. Only pain, for as long and as hard as you want it, nothing more, nothing less. I think you leave a lot untapped when you focus just on that. Not that you’re not beautiful when you’re holding so still for me and taking whatever I give you, but there’s that, and there’s this: you, embarrassed and miserable and yet
“We’re trying not to remark on that so much, remember, Goyle? Because it doesn’t matter?” Neville said kindly, with only a slight grimace.
“Oh, honestly,” Harry sighed. “I appreciate the concern, Ernie, but I’m not in any danger, least of all from Draco. I’ve just had some bad news and need to discuss it with him. Alone. If that’s alright with you.”
Harry was afraid to look. He turned his head. Ron. Arms crossed, storm clouds quickly gathering on his face, an indignant jut to his chin.
“You don’t have to come with us, love,” Harry reminded him, but Draco just glared harder and Harry gave up, loading Clark’s trunk into the boot.
Harry walked between James and Albus as they made their way towards the Gryffindor tower. Both were sulking and glaring. Harry wondered how outraged they’d be if he told them just how alike they looked when they did that.
“Enough,” Draco shuddered. “All this honeyed rot’s gone to your head, Granger. I expected better from you.”
While Harry had played seeker for the first round of games a couple of weeks earlier, it had felt too imbalanced with the eighth years in play. It just wasn’t a lot of fun out-seeking a second year. The coaches had collectively decided to step back and focus on instruction, and continue with friendly eighth-year only games when they had the chance. Harry found he didn’t mind, he could easily get invested from the sidelines, feeling something like pride stirring in him.
Harry obliged, back up against the opposite wall, readying his hands to shield himself. Neville planted his feet, wand arm extended, a look of grim determination on his features.
“Yeah." Harry sat with the heavy sadness for a moment before his mind stuttered back to their previous conversation. "But hey, I do have galleons, if you want,” Harry insisted. “If that’s something you need, I can—”
“Hullo,” Harry greeted them, as they came closer. Harry went in for a handshake just as Dudley went for a hug and then there was the awkward laugh and rearranging of limbs that ended in a truncated, stilted embrace. “Er, Dudley, this is Draco; Draco, Dudley.”
“Break Bone Bewitchment works directionally, from distal—that’s farthest away from the centre of the body—to proximal, making a neat fracture in every bone as it goes. Start with his littlest finger there, Harry. The tip of it, that’s called the distal phalanx. Hold it between your thumb and for forefinger and place your wand along his skin and send your magic out, it might help to close your eyes at the beginning. See if you can find the crease, it feels darker, out of place.”
Finally, though, they were together. Draco wasn’t reading like he usually was. He was lying on his back, staring up at the canopy. Harry lay beside him, and Draco’s hand sought out his. Harry held the newly healed digits tenderly. He couldn’t get the vision of Draco kneeling in the great hall out of his head in the dark like this. He lit up his wand. Malfoy threw a forearm across his eyes
“Oh, keep your shirt on,” Charlie smirked, “things like that are just more fluid in the desert. No time for British prudery.”
“Where is everyone?” he mumbled, grateful that Draco hadn’t put him down. He didn’t usually get carried about so much. It made today feel a bit special.
Draco’s familiar fingers wrapped around his mug and his unfaltering gaze met Harry’s. “The thing is, Potter, I suspect we already are.”
Harry didn’t bask. He stuck around long enough to be appreciative, but it wasn’t very late when he tugged on Malfoy’s sleeve, tilting his head subtly towards the dorms. Draco gave him a nod and the two slunk off.
“What about loyalty, kindness, and affection?” Zerk asked, “Do you think those might be important to a boy whose father showed none?”
“Didn’t know you could read, is all,” Al retorted, clearly just to get a rise out of his elder brother.
“Merlin, I am more than okay,” Draco reassured him, “That was just really fucking hot and I...I suppose I didn’t know it could be like that. I felt, I don’t know, entranced, or something. Oh Merlin, Potter, don’t look at me like that, I’m trying to say it was fucking incredible. You’re fucking incredible.”
Draco chuckled, taking in the cedar scent of Potter’s soap. He thought about Potter as a boy, so ready to jump into action, so easily baited. Fatherhood had mellowed the man some, and grief seemed to have edged out the majority of his anger. Draco wondered now if Potter had ever been as insufferably proud as Draco had believed him to be when they were at Hogwarts together. Such pride certainly wasn’t detectable now. Despite Potter’s own misgivings, he was clearly a competent father. Albus and Lily obviously adored him and so did James, underneath the layers of sullen attitude. Potter might seem scattered, but Draco could hardly blame him. When the situation with Astoria had devolved as it did, Draco had all but locked Scorpius away in the Manor and flung himself into finding a cure, to the neglect of everything, including his son.
“Are you playing quidditch?” Zerk asked. Surprised by the question, but a bit pleased, Harry launched into an explanation of the inter-house quidditch league. He was proud of it, and of the Wyverns, and it was certainly a more pleasant topic of conversation than the mess that had been the day. Curiously, Zerk seemed truly interested in it, asking lots of questions and responding with genuine enthusiasm. Harry even told him about his having a trial day with the Arrows, and Zerk was really thrilled for him.
is friendship, Potter,” she informed him, coolly, “You’re not the only one with people to watch out for you.”
He looked so appalled that Harry laughed and took him by the waist, pulling him in to snog him silly.
“Al, love!” Harry exclaimed, crossing the room hastily. He sank down beside the boy. “Whatever is the matter?”
They meandered through the usual chitchat—Draco seemed particularly interested in the Grangers’ explanations of muggle dentistry—and then they were all summoned by Mrs. Weasley to the dining room table.
“That’s all I ask.” She gave his wrist another affectionate squeeze, then pulled back, surveying the disaster that was the inside of Eiderdown End. “Would you like some help with all this? I know tidying doesn’t truly fix anything, but it’s a place to start.”
“You know what I mean! You’ve twisted his perception already. Oh yes, poor pampered Malfoy, he couldn’t help but become a Death Eater, it wasn’t his fault!”
McGonagall looked at him like she was about to stop him, but she only nodded said, “Very well. Come along.”
Clark shoved a toffee in his cheek, nodding seriously. He chanced a few glances at Draco from beneath his sandy-coloured eyelashes, but Draco didn’t offer any praise. Poor kid, thought Harry, he's barking up the wrong tree if he's wanting validation. Malfoy just waited until Clark swallowed the toffee down.
“Yeah?” Harry breathed. Malfoy raised an impatient eyebrow as if to imply he did not like having to repeat himself. “Alright.”
“Well, that is about all I have to report. I will ask the students to keep their aversion amulets on at all times, and Mrs. Brown is to be kept under strict security.”
Jared, having finished with his trainers, escaped properly this time, his sights set on Constance who was perched dejectedly on a dining room chair. The two had become fast friends during their first meeting the previous summer. Crystal Tiering had had a difficult season that year, and the boys had spent more time with Harry and Draco than not. Constance had proven a source of consolation for the young boy. The great bird perked up at the sight of Jared, who fished some lint-covered turkey bacon out of his pocket.
The Three Quays was a small, modern-appearing district with three arched, metal piers jutting into the Thames. Too-bright lights glinted off frigid beams in the early evening light.
After speaking with Professor Loon, who was exceedingly pleased with the opportunity to learn about mp3 players, Harry went looking for Malfoy. He found him in the library. Given that it was a Saturday afternoon in September, the vast room was otherwise abandoned, Draco scritching away at some parchment at a table in the back.
She managed to maneuver herself to the far side of the desk, coming precariously close to disturbing a particularly high pile of paper, “Now, what can I do for you, Mr…?”
“You should help!” Clark urged, “You know the spell, don’t you? You don’t need to watch me, I’ll stay here, I promise. If you can help, go! I'll even let Karan watch me, alright?”
“I can make my own decisions, you know. I don't just copy you! Besides, you’re not even going to be here next year, so you’re going to have to learn to trust me!” Clark reproached them. Harry could tell he was overtired from the whinging note in his voice.
— “That’s enough, Harry,” clipped, McGonagall, promptly booting him out, “more than enough skill for some lessons.”
“He’s told me a bit more about the, er, experiments? That he and Scorpius got up to? It’s sugar, I guess. Sugar or a high enough heart rate, either will trigger an attack. George always loads them up with sweets. I should have mentioned something, it just slipped my mind. So. He’s alright, Scorpius, I mean. It was just the sugar that brought it on, so I don’t think you’ll need to fiddle with the dosing.”
“Ugh,” Albus shuddered. “Is my Dad going to say horrid things like that once he’s my professor, too?”
Thank you x 10000000000 to everyone who read/kudosed/commented. Cannot say it enough how much it means to me!
“Draco,” Potter said carefully, reaching out a hand to settle on Draco’s chest. “I’d never use those things against you, not in ways you didn’t like. Felt pretty chuffed that you told me at all, really. Chuffed and impressed. Takes guts to say those things out loud, doesn’t it?”
“Ted’s sent an owl. He’s staying at Uncle Bill’s for the night. From the sounds of his note, they’ve already been at the cider.”
wicked. It was challenging, but, well, I think I did alright, and I just desperately want to do it all over again so I can fix the mistakes I made, fuck, it was all such a rush, so bloody brilliant. I don’t even care if they don’t pick me—well, I care a little—but I am just so glad I did it. And Brocklehurst and I went for lunch after and sounds like her portion sounds like it just as thrilling. Merlin, I wish I could tell you simply everything! I had no idea it would be like that, but I loved it, Draco, truly.”
The Hufflepuff sniffed and turned up her already rather upturned nose, and marched off. Ron stifled a giggle.
The uncomfortable tug and lurch of the portkey was over before it began and then Draco, Clark, Jared, Constance, and all their luggage were plopped into the foyer of Malfoy Manor. The vestibule was spotless: marble floors glinting and the stone pillars polished and unwelcoming. It was the last place in the world you would expect to see Jared’s plastic Muggle suitcase. Mother was there waiting, dressed in a cream coloured silk blouse and a neat grey skirt, a string of pearls at her throat. Her cold, neutral resting expression blossomed into a sincere smile when they all appeared, even as Clark stumbled against his trunk and frightened Constance, who made an ungodly squawk and rocketed upwards to find a perch on the stuffed head of a manticore, hunted by Corentin Malfoy in 1762.
Scorpius’ small face was drawn with concern and Draco silently reprimanded himself. He attempted to be honest with his son, but Merlin, how was he supposed to admit that he’d given into his baser instincts and goaded the Weasel because it was a bit of spiteful fun and he’d thought he could get away with it? Maybe Harry was right and Draco hadn’t reformed nearly as much as he liked to think.
"And see?" Draco continued, as if proving his point, "He no longer snaps at the bait. On the one hand, it's less fun, really, but it is also proof that these things can change. Anyway, where were we? Ah yes, meditation. For Occlumency you have to get to that nothingness, that distance, very quickly, almost instinctively. Going forward, I would like you to meditate at least once a day, preferably twice. The more often you reach that state, the more easily you can recall it. I’ll guide one this evening, sit.”
“Yeah,” Harry echoed, kissing the corner of Draco’s mouth as though he couldn’t help himself. “‘Course.”
Draco supposed he should be the adult in this situation. Merlin, he wished Harry had been the one awake for this. “Look, Clark,” he began as they returned to the drawing room, “those sorts of dreams...happen. It’s, ah, quite normal.”
“By all means,” Harry agreed. The living room window glowed a welcoming orange, signaling a fire lit within. “How do you want to play this?” he asked. Molly had been minding Remy and Lily that evening so Harry had been able to return to the school. “I’m sure we can just tell Molly that Scorpius is sick, but if you’d rather not deal with her this evening, I can hide you in the back and let you in once she’s gone.”
His other cousin, his uncle Percy’s daughter, Molly, who they usually called Mols to avoid the confusion, was Head Girl, and she presided at the other end of the Gryffindor bench, surrounded by her gaggle of friends. Her older sister, Lucy, had only just graduated the year prior, and his uncle Bill’s kids all went to Beauxbatons, where Auntie Fleur hinted they were less likely to die a grisly death. Jamie supposed it was nice to have family all around. He couldn’t imagine being an orphan like his dad had been, to have shown up at Hogwarts with barely a friendly face to be found, only having just learned he was a wizard.
“Alright, that’s alright,” Harry soothed, “Let’s just duck in here until you’re feeling better, then.”
“Those are not the feelings giving me trouble,” Harry muttered under his breath, banishing thoughts of a naked and willing Draco. Maybe two days and nights doing nothing save indulgent, intermittent fucking perhaps wasn’t a strategy for quidditch sucess, but Merlin, it had been incredible. Harry couldn’t convince himself to regret it.
Harry couldn’t speak for fear of dissolving all over again, so instead he gave them a weak wave, and followed the headmistress towards the Floo.
Draco acquiesced, clasping his hands on the table in front of him. His wrist landed in something gummy and cold, and he lifted his arm to examine some days old strawberry jam smeared there. Potter raised his wand and Draco flinched reactively.
“Suggesting something, Potter? That I should welcome my mother back into my life, my son’s life, so that I don’t live to regret it? Is that what you would consider the righteous choice?”
The return Hogwarts and the first few weeks of the new year were blessedly uneventful. Harry tentatively let himself believe that perhaps Wilma Brown was the lone culprit for the attacks in the autumn. Quidditch, the DA, and Occlumency lessons with Clark resumed without issue and Professor Haberdash-Pewter’s lectures returned to their customary omphaloskeptic tone. Hermione continued to collect funds for the Magical Children’s Equity Fund (she’d had to be talked down from the Fund for Under-served Kids). The M.C.E.F. was expanding, and Narcissa Malfoy was proving to be an astute administrator, building a board of directors for transparency and recruiting Harry for pleasant, personalised responses to major donors, which Draco insisted on editing.
“It’s alright, dearest,” Malfoy said, voice calm. “Mr. Potter has no intention of hurting me, I’m sure. Isn’t that right, Mr. Potter?”
Harry was a bit surprised that there would be such a lag, but the other three didn’t seem to think this was news, causing Harry to suspect this was not any of their first trial days. Harry wondered if that gave them an advantage on the course.
Harry went for Malfoy’s throat. The movement was instinctive, thoughtless. There was nothing but the need to drag his teeth along the faint trace of bruising. As he did, Malfoy’s breath rasped in Harry’s ear. Malfoy extended his neck, granting access, and pressed forward until their bodies were flush. Harry soothed the reddening skin beneath his teeth with his lips, desperately wanting to leave sucking kisses in his wake, but knowing Malfoy’s sensibilities would never allow something as gauche or juvenile as love bites—at least not where they could so easily be seen. Harry shifted instead, finding the underside of Malfoy’s jaw, then, finally, his mouth.
She ushered them to a small side office which, shockingly, had adequate lighting. The lot of them blinked and squinted while the witch, who Harry supposed was the
Draco scrutinised him, those pale eyes mournful and uncertain. Nevertheless, he rose, coming to stand within arm’s reach.
The question took Harry off guard. He went to answer and then stopped himself, suddenly unsure. “Everything is twisted up,” he said, finally. “I want to say he likes...being taken care of. Not financially, I don’t mean, he’s got loads more money than I do. More like, looked out for. But now all the sudden taking care of him feels all wrapped up in the status and power thing. Like maybe he knew I would protect him. Maybe it’s all part of the fucking ruse.”
He paced in the waiting room, surrounded by squabbling kids and haranged parents, who thankfully were too caught up in their own personal narratives to place him. It probably also helped that this was an unlikely place for him to be. Another ministry witch walked by Ms. Provincel’s office and was summoned inside. The door was closed behind her. A few minutes later she left, and then, a few minutes later, she reappeared with Kingsley Shacklebolt.
Okay fair warning, this and next couple of chapters might be considered Ron-bashing, but I really was just trying to be emotionally realistic and I promise it is
He thought about just crawling into his own bed—Merlin, he was exhausted—but he couldn’t help but wonder where Draco had escaped to. He figured he’d check the bathroom just in case.
The more Harry considered the question, the more agitated he felt himself becoming. “And I don’t know why else he sticks around,” he continued “I’m not particularly funny or clever, not like him. He works bloody hard, he thinks about things, he’s organised and neat and has an eye for things I know nothing about.”
Harry shrugged, “Can’t miss what you never had, I guess.” He knew he was diverting but he couldn’t sit with that heavy, mournful feeling any longer, not without cracking open. “But I guess I thought Draco saw me as a person. Like, we joke about him only being around for the status but it’s always been a joke, I’ve never believed it.”
“Lovely penmanship you’ve got there,” Main commented, nodding to the homework Scorpius had laid out on the dark, stained table. Scorpius did have lovely penmanship, but he refused to be flattered by someone who so clearly wanted something.
“We’re much more willing to sit down and have a think on behalf of someone we care for," Professor Haberdash-Pewter suggested, "And I encourage you, and all my students, if they can bear it, to break bread with those who oppose them, for comraderie is a great modulator. It softens extreme edges, brings people together. It’s harder to hate a group of people if they are your neighbours, your teachers, your shopkeepers. Certainly not impossible, of course, as we are shown repeatedly, but it helps.”
“I’m serious,” he said, and it suddenly felt so vitally important that Draco understand him, “I know it’s been shit keeping this all hidden away, but it’s not forever, love, I swear. Hermione and I have a plan and I think it’s a good one. And it it doesn’t work, fuck them. We’ll move to...I dunno, Montreal, and change our names and take up ice hockey. No matter what, I’m choosing you.”
“So lovely, darling,” Harry murmured, “That was so incredible, so perfect, I could barely fucking stand it.” Harry cast a wandless
“Yeah,” Ron grumbled, “because with Zabini gone to Beauxbatons and Crabbe dead, there are only like five of them left.”
Harry opened the door that led to the entrance hall. He was surprised to hear the sounds of a struggle—incoherent shouting, and the flurry of limbs—from the far end of the hall. Several hooded bodies were descending on a single, blond figure. Harry immediately, wordlessly discharged his Patronus. The stag galloped across the vast entrance in seconds, having the desired effect. The figures scattered immediately with a series of startled cries, the Patronus circling round Malfoy and herding the offenders, who at once escaped the hall.
“That’s lovely, thank you,” Harry said and the young woman flushed happily. She ducked her head obligingly and hurried off.
“Yes, Harry.” Draco’s voice was low in his throat. Harry scanned his face: the set jaw, the need and apprehension in his eyes, and nodded.
Scorpius still didn’t know what had happened to the lot of them. He remembered the bitter, earthy taste of the sleeping draught Father had  given him that night before tucking him into the big bed in the master bedroom. He remembered his disordered dreams and the acrid taste of bile.
When Harry stepped off of Hogwarts grounds, he apparated. Instead of Grimmauld Place, he was surprised to find himself instead at the entrance to St. Mungo's. He supposed that was what was on his mind. He’d seen Zerk only a few days ago and they’d talked about the damned article, but Harry hadn’t been able to make a decision. His conversation with Clark had rattled him more than he thought, he supposed. As much as he wanted to see Draco, he somehow still wasn't ready.
every other day, kind of hard to forget. Welcome to Fletcher’s Field, I’m Shanna, the director of operations, and I’ll get you signed in.”
Lily didn’t look convinced. “It’s been ages since you acted all weird,” she told him. “And just with Jamie that one time. I’m pretty sure you don’t do that anymore.”
“Pudding’s here!” Jamie announced from the drawing room. “Let’s eat it in the garden, it’s stuffy in here with the damn fire going.”
Harry was in a group with Neville, Mandy Brocklehurst, and Goyle, and they were sent off towards the greenhouses.
Auror Hewstone looked around uncomfortably, and gave a cough. “Well, yes, Mr. Potter. Some are concerned…”
Draco opened his mouth to answer the question. Of course he knew what he’d had, he’d only just been thinking about it. But it was gone. He couldn’t remember a moment of it: not the taste or smell wafting off his plate, words he’d exchanged with Scorpius, or even the cleaning up. It was simply gone. “Merlin,” Draco breathed. “Extraordinary.”
"Playing a prank," Malfoy seethed as they headed back to their dormitory, "I cannot believe you would just throw me to the wolves like that, Potter."
“Generally speaking, I’m not sure. All I know is second hand from Granger—she’s in another meeting with McGonagall, but she’s been in to see you—It was as though...those messages whoever-it-is has been sending, they were amplified. Instead of just going to one Slytherin, they went to all of us. I felt it, heard her come in, but I shut her out so fast I didn’t hear what she said. Those of us who’ve heard her before didn’t respond, because we recognised it, but students who hadn’t heard it—they took it to heart. Apparently she said, I don’t know the wording, but basically that other students were threats, that Slytherins needed to protect themselves, that it was urgent.
Harry saw Professor McGonagall enter from the direction of her office with six lime-green cloaked St. Mungo’s healers, stepping briskly and carrying bags. Harry doubled over coughing again and Ron gave his back a tentative pat.
Harry ran a hand down along the back of Draco’s thigh, over the swell of his arse, along the cleft. He cast a wandless
“I know, Mum,” Draco replied, keeping his tone level lest Jared—who was now staring rather wide-eyed at the seat Clark had just vacated—retreat beneath the dinner table. “I’m afraid Clark rather takes after Harry when it comes to an abiding and occasionally tiresome attachment to idealism.”
The two older boys chaperoned Clark back to the entrance to the Slytherin dorm, Draco insisting they take common routes.  “Good, you've now been seen with Harry,” he explained, “When people ask, just shrug and say he’s helping you with some more advanced spells. Then change the subject, play it cool. Don’t answer follow-up questions.”
“So, er, how’s things? What are you up to this year? Still at school or have you finished up?” Dudley asked, after they’d ordered pints.
“Any change?” Harry asked quietly, drawing up a seat next to Draco. He looked down at Clark. The boy wore flannel, plaid pajama bottoms that were too short for his gangly legs and a faded grey t-shirt. Harry made a note to pick up the kid some new pajamas on his next Hogsmeade visit.  Of course, his brain supplied unhelpfully, the boy wouldn’t fucking need them if he never woke up. Harry felt a shudder run through him and Draco’s hand came to the back of his neck reflexively to gentle him. Clark was still in the bubble head charm Harry had placed, and his features were distended strangely through the fishbowl lens. He hated it, wanting to reach out and touch the boy’s face.
“I don’t know,” Jamie admitted. “I’m not sure what my interests are right now, besides Quidditch and graphic novels. I did Care of Magical Creatures last year, but this year I...wanted to try something new. Besides, I ought to start thinking about my career.” Jamie liked that word,
Potter had left with an awkward wave, and Draco was now seated side-by-side with Albus at the dining room table, with Scorpius peering over his friend’s shoulder, balancing on the heavy wooden rung between the two back legs of Albus’ chair. Draco leant in, trying to make out the unruly penmanship which was familiar to him from Albus’ various essays on potion properties over the last year.
“Beside you, mate!” Yelled Ron, and Harry looked back to see he was indeed flanked by Ron and Goyle, “We’ll keep ‘em off you!”
“We were each confronting something much larger than ourselves,” Draco added, picking up the thread and giving Harry a much needed break. “While your father was trying to get the world to listen, I had been charged by the Dark Lord to murder Professor Dumbledore,” Lily pulled back from Harry’s side far enough to hazard a curious peek at the professor. “He had taken over our home, had clear control over my father and mother. He told me they’d die a most cruel death if I failed at the task he’d set before me, and so would I. I believed him. I’d seen first hand what he was capable of by then. I was terribly afraid.”
The pale blond boy shriveled impossibly backwards. “Leave me alone,” he whispered. His face was towards Harry now, but he still didn’t seem to quite see him. “I’ll not tell you anything.”
“Okay,” Harry said. He wiped his palms on his trousers, the calm he was feeling replaced with discomfort because he wasn’t quite sure he had the right words for this. “So. Clark is staying with Draco and me for the weekend, because his mum wasn’t up to having him and his best friend’s gone home for Passover and I didn’t want him to be at the castle alone.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Hermione sighed, pulling on the silver chain around her neck. “Ron and Draco’s ridiculous one-up-manship over you has him looking like the cat that’s got the cream. Proprietorial. And like he wants to devour you whole, but also smug, as though he knows something we don’t.”
Lily looked dubious, but seemed to decide not to press the matter. ”Would you like to see my locket?” she asked instead.
“Anyway, he said if you came by to tell you not to worry and it’s not serious, but Scorpius was feeling a little off this morning so he took him to St. Mungo’s just to be safe.”
“Well, your dad’s just making you some toast with almond butter and then you can go back to sleep, how’s that?”
“Draco has that effect on people,” Harry agreed with a gentle chuckle, “but so long as you’re trying, he’s truly not thinking ill of you. Besides, he can’t see or judge what’s inside your head. So you can put that fear away, yeah?”
To Jamie’s relief, the professor didn’t dismiss him. “That’s an excellent question,” he began, instead. “And gets into some of the finer points of Dark Magic.”
“Hello, yourself,” he said, taking Draco’s hand and turning towards the eighth year table, their friends fanning out beside them, “Fancy some lunch?”
Ahead of them in the shadows, he saw Seamus sling an arm around Dean with that same easy affection. Another kiss and then the two slowly faded from view.
“Like I said, you’re welcome if you change your mind.” Harry repeated. The girl blinked furiously and then stormed off, and Harry had a funny feeling she was going to cry, although he couldn’t quite think why.
“It’s hardly fair for you to expect me to act rationally when I’m now a creature of pure emotion, Harry,” she said, sounding hurt.
Seemed almost too pretty to use, but options were scarce. First, he wiped off his tear-fogged glasses and then he gave his nose a raucous blow.
Fortitude Jordan had been a friend of Jamie’s since first year. They’d joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team together this past year with Jamie as Seeker and Fort as one of the Beaters. Harry hadn’t realised, however, that they were so close.
“Good play, Tiering!” His exclamation was cut off by Ginny’s shrill whistle, for, completely unbeknownst to Harry, Magnolia Sitthi had gone and captured the snitch, without even Ron noticing. It was victory to the Wyverns.
“Mmhmm,” Jamie assured the other boy in a tone that said he would be making no such attempt. He was so congenial and at ease here, in Hogwarts, alongside his friend, that Scorpius barely recognised him. Gone was the surly James, slouching around the house and sighing emphatically to signal his displeasure, and only ever a breath away from snapping at Al.
Harry yanked at his knuckles, a habit he seemed to be acquiring for when it came time to parse his feelings. He still didn’t say anything.
“About that,” Harry hazarded. “Do you mind keeping this between us? Just until I’ve had the time to tell my friends and family.”
“Nothing that can't wait!" Albus pleaded. "Besides, let us go today and I'll do double chores tomorrow. We all will. Please, Dad? Uncle George said I could bring a friend round and he’d show us prototypes! Please? Scor won’t get to see them if I’m not with him!”
Draco scanned Albus’ list. It included words like snip, edit, alter, skip and prune with their Latin counterparts scrawled to the right.
Harry wanted to say yes, but he sighed and shook his head. “Not with Molly here. There will be questions and she’s protective. She’s been stressed as it is, what with Ginny taking off, and I don’t want to put more on her just now.”
“You’ll notice that all parties are speaking their spells aloud,” Neville explained, “this is just for demonstration purposes. In your own combat, we encourage you to try for wordless magic, so your opponent doesn’t know what’s coming.”
Harry scrunched his nose and rolled onto his side to appraise Draco. For all his whinging, Draco had greatly enjoyed his training. He was working under the round-faced healer who’d attended Clark after the fire. Healer Upchurch was all friendly composure and medical precision and more often than not, Draco was bursting with newfound knowledge, explaining incantations and healing salves in excessive detail to an amiable, if not fully attentive, Harry.
“Are you staying the night, too, then?” Lily demanded. It took Draco a moment to realise she was speaking to him.
“It just used to make me so mad, growing up,” Ginny continued, when Harry didn’t say anything, “It was always “Ginevra, help your mother in the kitchen,” and then Hermione showed up, and Mum expected the same of her, and she was a guest! Oh, the boys had to help with cleaning up, but I can count the number of times I’ve seen Ron help cook on one hand. It was an unspoken rule, witches in the kitchen, wizards waiting to be served. I don’t want that for myself.”
“What’s happened?” Harry asked, as he and Draco met with Hermione and Ron in the sitting room. They’d arrived by Floo and Kreacher had already set them up with tea. Clark was evidently still asleep.
“I’m not entirely sure. I suspect she’s doing some reckoning in there,” he gestured to the hallway which housed Lily’s bedroom door. “It’s funny, isn’t it? How different they can be? Jamie’s always been careful with his tastes. He’s modified them to fit what he thinks is cool and acceptable. He can’t bear to be mocked. Meanwhile, the people who factor into Al’s algorithm for likes and dislikes are very few and far between. He couldn’t give a toss what people think of him, he’s far too busy.”
“Oh my God,” Clark kept whispering fervently as he hopped from cage to cage, “Harry, come look at this one, look, it has ears! Oh my God, this one looks so disturbed, it’s hilarious, oh my God!”
“It's fine, I mean it's not, but I’m not trying to get your sympathy, I’m just trying to explain. You see, I think...I think I grew up believing I was only worth what I could do for others. Not that I got anything for it, not from my aunt and uncle or even from Dudley, at the time. But it was what I was good for. Unfortunately, I think maybe I bought into it until I actually believed I wasn’t worth anything at all.  I wonder if maybe it is just a bit easier for me to risk my safety, to sacrifice myself because of that. Like maybe I could prove I was worth something if I was just good enough, just noble enough.”
“No, but thought it might be nice to have over the holidays, since I don’t suppose I’ll have any luck convincing you to spend it with me at the Manor.”
“Mm,” Harry agreed, pressing his lips to the hinge of Draco’s jaw. “Is that what the, ah, what was it. Person. In Faering. Who was bothering you.”
“Bully for you,” groused Harry, but he still took the book, happy not to have to be wandering the stacks.
“Oh, we can get along fine,” Ron agreed, “but he’s still a bit of an arrogant git, always thinks he’s got the best ideas, always bossing Harry around.”
“Chatting about your love life, were you, Potter?” Draco asked, shooting Harry an incredulous look. “While the whole castle burns?”
“Oh, come on now,” Harry said, chiding him affectionately, “it’s just going to be an adjustment, but that’s okay, people adjust all the time.” To Harry’s drunken ears, it sounded almost profound, “Anyway, don’t let it get you worked up; we don’t have to sort it out quite yet, we’ve loads of time. I’m not going anywhere.”
cloak,” Harry called out, summoning the one he’d worn on his way to the pitch but had soon discarded as practice warmed him up. He draped it over the skinny boy, Malfoy casting a tidy hemming charm. Tiering looked irritated but still burrowed into the thing.
I do have finals coming up in a couple of weeks, and I need to (a) study and (b) sleep so apologies in advance if chapters appear less frequently. I'm done around mid June, and after that I'm on summer break and promise to return to a more regular posting schedule then!
Scorpius seemed to take that as fact, because he slithered down the wall and under one of the endless misshapen quilts Molly had made over the years. His little body relaxed and he stilled.
“Well, if she’s not here, then we’d best be going,” Draco determined. He reached for Harry’s hand, then froze. His eyes widened, and then his hand curled into a fist. “Get out!” He yelled.
Usually when the need to be hurt got too distracting, Draco would seek someone out. There were places he knew he could go, to find men with needs counterpart to his own. No matter how brutal the partner, though, Draco found himself with too much control. He was more clever, more fastidious, always certain to never be truly trapped. Those precisely calculated experiences were so unlike the interlude today, which left him choking in Potter’s drawing room, a singing terror streaking through his veins. The violence and the powerlessness had served as an aphrodisiac. And he’d let Potter know.
“Then why is Draco Malfoy in hiding, if he’s so innocent?” Someone shouted out from the buzzing crowd in front of Harry.
Draco shuddered but kept talking, “It was actually good, though, I think I almost encouraged it. Better that...better that than him finding out how I felt about you.”
As if sensing his thoughts, Lily tucked in close to his leg, and Harry stroked her head absentmindedly as he reviewed the letter.
“What are you doing?” Hermione hissed, but Harry ignored her until he found what he was looking for:
Clark nodded solemnly and went back to scouring the cages. Draco glanced quickly up and down the aisle before putting a hand on Harry’s waist and leaning in to kiss him briefly.
Hermione and Ron looked uncomfortable, like they wanted to be able to defend Draco somehow, but knew it was impossible. It
“Well,” Ri began, “while ignoring Professor Binns in class today—I read a complete history of the Goblin wars when I was eight and prefer intersectional perspectives to Binns’ antiquated—”
Ms. Veldt pressed a palm to the file and grinned. She had dark red lipstick and a rather ageless face, but Harry would guess she was perhaps in her forties. “Quite a bit of press on the two of you,” she said.
“First year nerves, is all,” Madam Pomfrey commented, “He’ll be right as rain once he makes some friends.”
“Alright, that’s a drink for everyone who had any of the following: ‘erotic dreams, souls, love, and penetration!’” Declared Ron with delight, helping himself to two generous sips of Firewhiskey. His face was ruddy and his arm slung happily around Hermione’s shoulders.
The conversation was perfectly pleasant, but their days apart left his hands itching to touch Potter. He ought not to risk it, with Lily likely to make an appearance at any moment. He helped himself to a glass of water instead, waving away Harry’s attempt at offering to get it for him.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed, “What do you mean? You love school. You’ve so much to look forward to: Quidditch and all your friends and assisting Professor Malfoy…”
Harry wasn’t an idiot. He knew he ought to have warned Ron and Hermione that Draco was planning on attending their annual end-of-summer meal. The issue was this: Harry wasn’t convinced that Draco truly would come, not really. And the only thing worse than breaking the news that he and their old enemy were now quite friendly, was being stood up by him. So Harry hadn’t spoken it aloud, just in case he jinxed it.
“You may,” Harry agreed, and for a second Draco’s heart skittered, half in excitement, half in disappointment that this all would be ending so soon. It was a paltry bit of begging, after all. “But you can’t use your hands to do so. You’ll have to rut against me like an animal.”
“No, it isn’t,” Harry agreed. “The war, well, it’s difficult for me to speak of, love. I spent some time truly believing I wouldn’t live to see twenty. I was...angry. Angry and determined, and no one else could understand the weight of it all, not truly. I thought I was destined to die to protect a world that had not once protected me. Nothing felt safe, not even my own mind.”
The man was back to his old disdain and Harry felt a fresh wave of anger beneath his skin. “Yes," Harry agreed bitterly, "I have been. I have a four month old baby who rarely sleeps, a wife who just left me, and two devastated, confused boys who've been at each other's throats ever since. All of this was presented to you upon your arrival, and still you opted to drop your child and leave the country, with no way for me to contact you.”
Their conversation was cut short when Luna blew a shrill whistle, “We’ve only got so much time with this potion,” she said, sitting side-saddle on a broom in what looked to be a shockingly unstable arrangement, but Luna didn’t seem to mind. She crossed one knee over the other and gathered several shawls around her shoulders. “So teams are roughly Gryffindor and Slytherin vs. Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. I’ve hidden a green and scarlet stick and a purple and yellow stick somewhere on this pitch—on the opposing team’s side. First team to bring their stick across the midway point is the victor! Begin!”
“Why won’t you just leave me alone?” Scorpius whispered to that unseen presence. “I can’t tell you what you want, Father’s seen to that. And I won’t go with you, either. I’ll scream, I will.” The boy looked sick with terror and Harry had a terrible feeling that all this wasn’t just stemming from an overactive imagination.
“This was not how I wanted our first night to go. Or our first morning,” Harry grumbled. He felt the loss more acutely than he wanted.
Switching tables in the Great Hall was not particularly common, but no one ever hassled James Potter and his friends, even when a plate was upset as he wriggled to make room. Jamie grunted an apology to the fifth-year beside him, and the fifth-year only smiled and magicked up the mess. People seemed to like Jamie—Albus excluded.
“Scor? He’s not here, Professor, sorry. Is he okay?” Al asked, sounding worried. When, Harry wondered, had his son become such an impeccable liar? He sighed deeply. He was struggling at this very moment in time to remember why he’d ever thought he wanted children so desperately.
Not two minutes later, Malfoy erupted to his feet, “Oh fucking hell, get away from the cauldron, immediately, you’re useless.” Harry held back a laugh as Malfoy pushed past him to salvage the mauve, simmering concoction.
“Anyway,” Harry continued after a long moment. “I wanted your advice on something else, too. Do you think...hm. Should I tell Al and Jamie about the Horcruxes?”
“Except he’s gone and promised to be a servant to Malfoy,” Ron reminded them, sitting down with his own mug.
Malfoy gave a blasé wave of his hand. “This is exactly why we’re doing this. Might as well get the first exposure treatment over with.”
“Oh, come off it, mate,” Ron laughed at Malfoy’s horrified expression, which only amplified at the use of the casual ‘mate’. “Think about it: six, idolizing younger years you get to order around and strategise with, what’s more Malfoy than that? Besides, think of it as part of your bargain. Harry makes you tea, you make an attempt to be social with someone who isn’t Pansy or Greg.”
“I’ve still got loads of ink from last year,” Albus informed him. “But can you get me some more broad nibs, please? And some raven’s quills?”
“Surely, I should get a say in that particular agreement.” Harry looked behind him to see Draco appearing, as if out of nowhere. Harry grinned drunkenly, exceedingly chuffed to see his boyfriend.
“I don't know, Harry, figure it out,” Hermione snapped, her patience for this issue obviously at an end, “I’m tired of secrets and I’m tired of lies. The longer this goes on, the more hurt he’ll be when he finds out you kept it from him. And he'll be even more hurt if he finds I've kept it from him, too. He is trying extremely hard, Harry, despite his not insignificant grief, to give Draco a chance. You're his best friend; the least you can do is to give him a chance, as well.”
“You didn’t think her that awful, if I remember correctly,” Harry chided, the lightness to his voice perhaps a little forced. Draco found the valiant front to be just so typically, endearingly Potter.
Draco snorted at that. “Oh yes, that is what all the headlines say: ‘Harry Potter, dull as dishwater’.”
“Oh yes, because just what every newly single parent needs is space,” Draco scoffed. “Not someone to stop by with groceries or meals and help out around the house and childcare.”
Draco narrowly managed to keep from wincing. The words were a bitter reminder of how badly Draco was bollocksing things up. He’d not told Harry about the letter that still weighed heavily in his pocket to prevent this very thing: Harry waiting on him hand and foot. That was the problem with Harry. He would do anything anyone asked if he thought it was the decent thing to do, but Draco didn’t want to be just another obligation. No, Draco was independent, he was capable. That was what he offered Harry—competence and company and a little fun in the bedroom. There, Harry indulged Draco’s interests, but in return Draco made Harry’s life easier. That was his role and that was what he would keep doing, because if he stopped being useful…
Dudley clapped him on the back with a massive hand, apparently not angry about Harry’s eschewing of his plans.
“I’m not holding my breath,” Harry replied, trying to keep from snapping back, “Do you need help down or what?”
” hollered Harry, his wanding pointing at the wolf closest to the girl. It snapped at the hem of her pajamas with flaming teeth, then hissed as the violent spray of water from Harry’s wand doused it. It scampered off, alighting a burning trail in its wake.
“Al,” it was Potter’s voice in the hall. There was a brief knock, followed by the click of the boy’s bedroom door being opened. “Half an hour, then it’s time to start getting ready for bed.”
“Yeah. I...I think I can do that,” Harry nodded, somehow feeling better having a bit of a plan, even if it was not concrete. “Can I go? I hate being away from Draco right now, it must be awful for him.”
Thanks for your patience and for reading and for your lively, lovely comments. I am so glad you exist.
Draco looked bored. “People are overwhelmingly stupid, particularly in a crisis. More often than not, they are happy to have someone else take the lead.”
“My time as a mortal was brief, and Glaistig are very rare,” she replied, but Harry couldn’t help but feel as though she were holding something back.
The Slytherin common room felt strange without Albus: lonelier, maybe, and larger than usual. Conversations echoed off the walls, distracting Scorpius from where he was proofreading his Charms homework. Usually Al would be here with him, either doing his own work or faffing about with some new invention or flight of fancy.
It wasn’t often Harry got to catch Draco off guard. He found he rather liked it. He crossed the bedroom in two determined strides, hand circling around the back of Draco’s neck and pulling him in for a hungry kiss.
“We thought nothing of the sort, did we, darling?” Draco said smoothly, rescuing Harry from his befuddlement.
“Yeah,” Harry said, blushing stupidly. “You know. He’s a good-looking bloke. Kind of, I don't know, pretty and flowery and things.”
“Very well,” Draco said in a voice that suggested that Harry was yet again exposing his criminally poor taste.
“You need fuel, Potter,” he reminded him, “Won’t be very impressive if you are too weak to stay astride your broom.”
After dinner, Harry and a handful of other eighth years met in the library. Harry’s plan— well, Draco’s plan, actually, but Harry had agreed to go along with it—was to finish his potions homework. Potions on a Saturday evening, Harry thought, shaking his head, he could barely recognise himself. Malfoy was, however, rewarding Harry’s industriousness with proximity: the press of thighs and the covert touching of hands which Harry found in equal parts gratifying and exhilarating.
“Lily’s always been more like Al,” Harry reflected. “She is exuberant about the things that she likes, and isn’t afraid to let it be known, but instead of being an outsider, others around her tend to follow suit. At Hogsmeade Primary School for the Magically Inclined, however, there is one Anthea Embury who is also seeking the position of lead trendsetter, and seemingly does so by putting her competition down.”
Slughorn beamed at them, “An old favourite of mine, really, and thought it would be good for you all to start the term with a bit of levity!”
Draco squeezed Clark’s shoulder, feeling helpless. He wished for the thousandth time that week that Harry was here. As much as he hated to admit it, he felt off-kilter without Harry, less competent somehow. It was unpleasant.
“Lovely,” Hermione beamed. “All of us here echo those sentiments and applaud you for your efforts. So, please remember to set your alarms and meet with your buddy shortly before sunrise. Breakfast will start early for anyone peckish, and the house elves will have worked tirelessly to prepare something nice to bolster your spirits. So be sure to thank any you see!”
“Certainly seems that way,” Draco declared. “Well, Jared, what do you think? Want to follow your brother to Hogwarts in a few years?”
“He’s fine now,” Draco confirmed, “Thanks, Thomas. Just give us a bit of time alone in there, yeah?”
upon her. The spell took hold at once. Harry pulled at a glancing memory and followed it. A young Rowena Ravenclaw—Harry recognized her from her portrait—was striding through a copse of young birches, her daughter by her side and a basket suspended from her forearm. The two appeared to be harvesting herbs, although Harry could not understand the Gaelic-sounding language passing between the two. The Ravenclaw founder crouched to pluck a leaf from a bilberry shrub, rolling it between her fingers and lecturing the bright-eyed, dark haired girl beside her. She passed the pilled greenery to Helena, who examined it thoughtfully. Her mother smiled, watching her.
Ginny blew her whistle, “Enough berating your team, Malfoy! We’ve got to do an equipment trade off so the next two teams can get started!”
Clark took a step forward and stumbled and Malfoy swept in, catching him easily, his hands bracing against the boy’s shoulders.
Harry felt a bit better with a task at hand. He dug out his favourite knife from a cluttered drawer and started chopping the vegetables. He let Malfoy sort out the venison—
“I know,” Potter agreed with a helpless shrug. “I wish I could keep track of what they get into, but Al especially is hard to pin down. He throws himself at his interests. Last summer, it was ant colonies. He found a nest of those, oh, what do you call them, thatching ants, I suppose, in the woods beyond the garden. It was all we could do to drag him in for dinner. Twelve hours a day, he was out there, diagramming them and comparing them to pictures in great tomes of fauna, making meticulous notes on colony structure. And then one day he just dropped it and was onto something new, and he never mentioned the bloody ants again.”
“Pinch me, here,” Harry motioned to his thigh, “if you need me to stop,” he said, rubbing his hand gently along Malfoy’s face, “you understand?”
“That’s very kind of you,” Scorpius said, his mask of manners falling firmly into place. “But I’m quite alright, I assure you.”
“Hm,” Draco agreed. “How about instead of talking about my affliction of a father, you kiss me some more?”
I really need to learn to be less attached to my characters so I can actually sustain a fight for more than a chapter. My conflict aversion is showing!
“It’s a start,” Malfoy explained. “It’s a bit of a murky situation, isn’t it? You, freshly heartbroken, and both of us with children to consider. Seems foolhardy to rush into anything more concrete.”
“I suppose,” Ginny replied, “And Neville, he’s so fit and lovely, but I know he’d propose tomorrow if he didn’t think it would send me running for the hills.”
Draco jumped and made a noise that certainly couldn’t be described as a squeak, before clearing his throat. He didn’t know why, but he’d been expecting an implement. Harry’s hand felt...intimate. “Sorry,” he muttered, resuming his composure.
“Not really,” Harry sighed, “I spent summers with my aunt and uncle, or at The Burrow when I could. I don’t really live anywhere, save Hogwarts. But it’s mine.”
“So he said something daft and you took it to heart and then ratcheted it up a few degrees, sounds like,” Ron said.
Clark heads to the stairs with the freshly varnished hardwood that only went in this summer. He’d seen most of the transformation himself. It made him feel like it was his own life that was being stripped away and refurbished. He walks along the hall. It’s painted a deep dusty rose, the colour of his Wyvern uniform. He’d been dubious when Draco asked his opinion on it–because Draco always asks his opinion on things—even things Clark doesn’t know the first thing about—but Clark thought it looked actually pretty good, in a fuck-conformity sort of way.
“Yes, Weasley, I’m sure a being composed of concentrated rage will be open to a quick chat. We’ll simply show her the error of her ways and she’ll retire to the seaside,” Malfoy replied.
Harry’s eyes snapped to him, “I should hope you would know a thing or two about second chances, Percy.”
Harry grinned and swiped his tongue experimentally across Draco’s cockhead. The vaguely unpleasant taste of precum was instantly made worth it by the strangled yelp of surprise that sounded overhead.
It was George’s turn next. “I’ll pass on this one,” he said breezily, dropping a card face up on the table that read
for? You barely tolerate me. If it wasn’t for everything you did today, I would have assumed you still hated me.”
“He’ll come round,” Hermione assured him. “Just keep talking to him. You’re not the one he’s angry with, you know, you’re just the one who’s there to shoulder the attacks.”
Before he could turn and leave as he’d intended, he caught sight of Tiering’s face. It was frozen, lips parted in fear, his sandy brows dipping down in a look of concerned despair. “You’re done?” Clark whispered, “with me, you mean?”
“You know how to show a bloke a good time,” Ron teased and Harry momentarily froze at the words. Merlin, had Hermione said something? Had Ron found him out? But Ron’s face showed only good-natured cheer and a willingness to reconcile, so Harry forced himself to smile and clap Ron on the shoulder.
” Bellowed Harry, and the rest of the gaggle followed suit, save for one boy who ran off immediately.
. Ron and Harry increased the pace, transitioning to wordless magic that made the game feel that much more exciting, bright cracks of spells flooding the room with light. Harry felt nimble, ready to dodge any spells that Malfoy couldn’t deflect, but those never came, Malfoy two steps beside him, firing off protective spells in quick succession and frustrating Ron’s efforts.
Malfoy didn’t look convinced in the slightest, but he didn’t press. Instead, he reached a hand into a small satchel he carried and pulled out a phial with a cloudy, ice blue liquid. He held it out to Harry.
The Protegoes went up. Hermione and Seamus’ shields joined to form a bubble around their party. Harry wound his arm round to hold tight to Draco’s waist, as though the crowd could tear them apart. As they moved forward, so too did the shield, and soon the mob had no option but to step aside as the spell gently but firmly deflected them.
“It didn’t bother me,” Harry assured him quickly. “You’re well aware that I like it when you are all brilliant and organised. Saves me a lot of hassle, at any rate. And I’ve mostly given up on caring what strangers think. But for me...people are never total strangers, are they? People like her, they act almost like they know me. It’s odd. They’re aware of so many things about me and my past, and yet I don’t know a thing about them.” He shoved a hand through his hair and he saw Draco’s cheek twitch. Harry felt himself smile, knowing Draco was restraining himself from reaching out to tidy the messy strands. “And I just don’t always like being known.”
“Well, it wasn’t as though you were about to learn it before it was absolutely necessary—like the moment you were about to Apparate there. Speaking of, we’ll have to set up some wards. I don’t like the idea of people just Apparating to your house. Save for myself, of course.”
“I can accept it from people I trust. I believe it when Ron or Hermione says something, or Professor McGonagall. Sorry, not trying to say I don’t trust you—”
Karanjeet gave them all a narrowed-eye glare, but rose and stalked out of the burnt-out door. Draco followed. Harry started for the door but was stopped by a sudden tight grip on his arm. He turned back to see Clark looking up at him.
“Are you sure you about this?” Draco asked. “I’ve been trying to tell you all along that you don’t owe them anything. You have a right to yourself and your stories and your privacy.”
The peaceful atmosphere made it only more shocking when there was a sudden loud crack and Draco Malfoy apparated onto the sparse expanse of rug between Harry and the Christmas tree, unconscious and wearing only his pants. His face, Harry registered in the suspended moment of shocked silence, was wet with tears and the bared muscles in his arms were twitching as if he was trying to fight.
Al shook his head as he followed the corridor from the deserted common room into the dormitory. He felt an ugly mix of persistent anger and worse, shame. He oughtn’t to have talked about Scor like that. His friend wouldn’t have liked it and Al sometimes thought he would do anything to keep Scor’s friendship. Scorpius was never irritated when Al changed focus from one project to the next, he was always game for an adventure, but would stop Al from doing anything truly foolish, and, well Scor
“Yes, well, we all have our way of dealing with things,” Draco sighed, readjusting his compress. “Besides, it likely doesn’t help that Weasley and I never got on in school. I think perhaps it can be easy to revert to old patterns if one is not vigilant.”
“I’m glad you’re alright. I know I can be somewhat...reserved. All this doesn’t come as easily to me as it does to Harry. He cares for you a great deal, loves you really. And, well, so do I. Just so you’re aware.”
The remaining pain from her accident was obviously not too troublesome, because Lily launched into an explanation of her latest acquisitions: the next two books in a series about Godiva Greatstrides, a fearless young squib forging her own path in a magical world.
“Of course, of course,” Penelope agreed warmly, squeezing Harry’s arm. “And I can put ears out for work for Ginny. We might even have something here, she’s been in administration, hasn’t she?”
He nodded to Harry when the hand completed a revolution, and the whistle sounded a second time, sending the Ravenclaws rushing forward, Grantly Owens leading the vanguard, as usual. Owens seemed to have a real chip on his shoulder. Everyone knew the Owens family had been Gryffindors since Hogwarts’ inception, but he’d broken that pattern, and seemed determined to prove that Ravenclaws could be just as brave. Scorpius found it honestly a bit exhausting. Houses only meant something because people pretended they did, that was his opinion.
“You’re fine,” Draco reassured him, allowing his gaze to rove over Harry’s body. The clothes were plain, certainly, but they were very
“Oh, believe me, Ronald,” Hermione asserted, “you’ll never have any guessing to do when it comes to what I am feeling. I've learned that lesson.”
“I guess it is fine, then, if you are certain. Lils, did you want to stay here with Professor Malfoy or come home with Remy and me?”
“You do a bit, though,” Hermione laughed. “Especially when you’re looking at Harry, like ‘he’s the answer to a question you didn’t even need to ask.’ Isn’t that what the article said?”
Draco pictured his meal that morning: the poached egg wobbling atop the buttered rye and sprinkled with black pepper, the tea in the white china cup with a chip in the rim, Scorpius' expression of affectionate exasperation. It was only that that gave Draco pause. He was loath to forget a single moment with Scorpius. He shook his head; he was being too sentimental by half. How many such breakfasts had he forgotten? Few meals were novel enough to twig long term memory storage, and this one would soon join the years’ worth of unremembered mornings, with or without the spell.
Harry laughed, then his face fell more solemn, “A lot of the post that’s been coming in has been going on about Harry Potter the auror, Harry Potter the politician, the spokesman. I wonder if I’m walking away from my responsibility by doing something as frivolous as sport.”
Next, Harry and Mandy served as mediocre keepers for a while while Rivers executed perfect precise shot after perfect precise shot. Once they were all significantly sweaty and exhausted, they called it a night.
“Er,” he said, unhelpfully. Draco shot him an exasperated glare from where he stood at the back of the classroom, arms crossed as he leaned against a wall. Harry couldn’t help but think he looked a bit like Clark. “Nothing to add, particularly,” Harry started, “I just want to thank you all for your diligence in this. The amount of consideration, research, planning, practice and care that went into this is astounding. So, thank you for that, and thank you for working to keep the school safe, and for looking after one another. We’re all in this together.”
“Just please don’t make me do small talk before I eat something,” Malfoy muttered back, “I’ll positively perish.”
Harry rubbed the skin above his eyebrow with the pad of his thumb. “Merlin, what a mess. Lavender, I don’t suppose there’s some sort of, I don't know, light you could go towards? At the end of a tunnel, like?”
“You’re just as impossible, I see,” she commented dryly. “But what I’m trying to say is that I’m glad you were here. We couldn’t be and you were.” She paused then, her intelligent brown eyes searching his, before continuing. “He’s better, I think, or getting there, and I’m grateful to you for that.”
“The news ones,” Hiram gasped, desperately. His owlish face was even more pale and distraught than usual. “I forget my charms book and Marvin here went back with me to the dorms to get it, only there was a bunch of smoke billowing out into the hallways, so we raced back here, oh, Merlin, I didn’t know what to do!”
Morning was a quiet affair with tea and toast and Harry’s tousled hair managing to look rather roguish and enticing. They’d come together a second time in the middle of the night. There’d been no fanfare that time, only the feel of Harry’s mouth on his neck and a sense of urgency as they’d brought each other off. They both knew it might be a while before they had an opportunity like this again.
“Hermione,” she said serenely, “I believe there’s a fire in the Ravenclaw tower, also. It’s quite pretty; fiendfyre really does make the most entrancing shapes, but it is also quite exuberant. I just thought you should know.”
“If she’s that far gone, we’re the clear option,” Draco offers. “She’s reasonable otherwise, and not vindictive. Having you and Jared here when needed seems to work for everyone, and I don’t see why that would change.”
Harry looked on, rapt, as Draco fucked himself open. The tentative press soon gave way to the forceful sliding of fingers.
“I wasn’t sure if you wanted to talk or if you’d rather hide out for a few more days, but I wanted to see you.”
“Nineteen years of commemorative speeches in the Great Hall...all those bright young faces and the place still feels like a graveyard. I’m fine to put on a public front for the kids, for the memorials, and for Teddy’s graduation, but Merlin, I half expect to trip over bodies as I walk the halls. I don’t know how you don’t.”
“Because we’ve got vials of extra bounding potion and it would be a shame to waste it.” Harry replied.
But Potter only laughed harder. “So, what you’re saying is you’ve not changed as much as you might like people to think.”
“There’s nothing I can do for you that will replace that, but hopefully, we can supplement it a bit. Maybe help relieve you of some of the undue responsibility you seem to have decided to shoulder, now that you have that as a choice.”
“I know you can," Ron assured him, "and it's awfully generous of you, but Merlin, I don't know, maybe it’s old-fashioned or what have you, but I think I want to make it on my own. Besides, knowing Hermione, she’ll be Minister of Magic within the year and supporting my sorry arse, and we’ll be just fine. But I know you’d help if I needed it, and if I need it, I promise I’ll not be too proud to ask, how’s that?”
Harry looked up from his charms homework, “Oh, hell, Hermione, I’m sorry. You’re not my secretary, you didn’t need to do that.”
was unfolded on the table between them. The front page had included a portrait of the supposed victim from Valentine’s Day, along with a puff piece about Draco Malfoy’s newfound heroism. The actress hired by Narcissa Malfoy had given an over-dramatic account of her near drowning. Harry noticed students edging closer to the eighth year table to sneak looks at Draco and make their own assessments. For his part, Draco was sporting a bashful, it-was-the-least-one-could-do countenance, which didn’t at all suit him.
the door before allowing himself to be consumed by Draco’s enthusiastic lips pressing against his own.
“Harry!” she exclaimed, stepping round the pram to give the man a ferocious hug. She eased back, still holding him by the shoulders. She looked like she’d like to give him a good scolding, but held back as her eyes drifted towards Lily. Instead she gave him another tight hug, standing up on her toes to whisper a reprimand into his ear. “Where have you been?” she said aloud. “It’s been ages, we’ve missed you all terribly!” She stooped to give her niece a hug and a kiss. “Where are the boys?”
“I’m not a complete idiot,” Potter interrupted, a flash of his own irritation sparking in those green eyes. “And he’s only just told me, so I have no proof. Perhaps it is his imagination, I know kids can believe the wild notions they dream up. But you have to understand: Al is very determined. When he wants something, he will take pains to get it.”
Scorpius tucked a lip between his teeth and worried it, considering. “So you don’t like him?” he asked.
“I was wondering why it is your house but his name’s on the family tree in the drawing room,” Clark said thoughtfully, “But can we go back to the bit about me being used, because I feel like that’s something I should know about.”
“Yes, alright,” Lily nodded. She appeared solemnly appeased. “Not that I want you to die, either. But if I had to choose…I’d rather it was you getting killed.”
“Get your hand off him,” Harry demanded. Malfoy looked down, confused, at where he held his son’s arm. He pulled his hand away abruptly. He faced Harry fully now, a storm brewing in his grey eyes. “You can take him home when you have calmed down,” Harry informed him.
“You ought to get out in the sun once in a while,” he murmured, giving into his urge to suck a love bite into Malfoy’s waiting flesh.
Secretly, Draco preened. He preferred his men big and broad, like Harry, but if Harry appreciated a more compact view, who was Draco to argue.
“Muggle what? Cauldrons?” Draco asked nonplussed. That didn’t sound quite right. What on earth would a Muggle do with a cauldron?
Despite the mismatch of their desires, Draco arrived back in England feeling well-rested and renewed. He was quietly pleased with his refreshed stores, and some new interesting specimens with which he was curious to experiment. He spent his first evening back clarifying labels and storing and drying flora as necessary. He owled Potter to let him know he’d be by in the morning to collect Scorpius. He flew over the Manor grounds, admiring the dahlias and tithonias cultivated by his gardners. He determined he’d have Scorpius help him bottle the pollen for potions later that week.
“Share that one around, would you? I would love to finish up my time at Hogwarts without the nightly lullaby of my classmates wanking.”
Harry was too exhilarated to even make it to the bedroom. In a fit of foolishness, he cornered Draco against a wall in the corridor, kissing him deeply.
Harry’s lips twitched, thinking of Ginny over the break. “Interdependence,” he said with a dry laugh. “A friend told me about it. She read about it in
Draco was reading by the light of his wand and he didn’t look up when Harry entered the canopy. Harry leaned up against the headboard beside him, forearms resting on his knees.
“It’s a simple problem with a simple solution,” Draco advised, “there are few of those in life; enjoy them when you can.”
“Wow, Dad, great manners,” Jamie said under his breath. Sarcasm had become second nature to the surly teen ever since Ginny took off. Harry could hardly blame him, but Merlin, it grated. “Hey, Professor,” Jamie greeted Malfoy.
spread open on the table before him, and was feeding Remy a bottle. Scorpius had to admit that it was a bit strange to see his dad with a baby. He’d never given much thought to his own infancy, or what it had been like for Father to find himself a parent. He certainly looked at ease now, but surely he’d found Scorpius more cumbersome. His dad hadn’t grown up with younger siblings, or even cousins, so it wasn’t as though he’d had any practice before Scorpius had come along, but then again, he tended to be terribly good at everything—at least so far as Scorpius could tell.
“Quite the expert for someone who just dipped their toe in all this so recently,” Draco drawled dryly.
“Doesn’t matter though, because Al’s smarter, I know he is. And I’ve been a shit friend this summer, so who knows if I’ve even got friends left.”
“But Malfoy, he's not bad,” Clark said, “I mean he can be bossy and a bit stuck up, but he’s good at teaching, and he’s smart, and generous, and he’s really nice to you and even to me, mostly. I could tell the newspaper people that, if you wanted?”
Draco rolled his eyes, “It’s a bit much,” he stated, then stepped in neatly, and in front of anyone who cared to see, planted a brief, firm kiss on Harry’s mouth. “Hello, darling.”
“Yes,” Draco sniffed, “but if I’d given that voice then you might not have done it at all. And I...wanted you to.” He knew as the words left his mouth just how rotten they sounded.
“Merlin, I didn’t bite you, did I?” Scorpius whispered, mindful of a group of Ravenclaw students walking by them.
Draco knew there was very little he could say that wouldn’t cause a row, and he knew that his mum’s intentions were nothing but pure.
“Look, I know that the bulk of that article was bollocks, and I know that you love me. Those two things are true, right?”
Draco dropped his wand and swept in front of children. Harry had no choice but to let the door close, lest he give up their advantage.
“Fuck,” Harry breathed. “Fuck, I don’t know. Like on one hand, I fucking want it: I want to know what’s coming, I want to play quidditch, I don't want to leave all this, I don't know,
Harry found Ron and Hermione in the common room. He flopped down in a wing-back chair across from them. He checked his new watch. Draco’s hand was still at ‘school’.
“Oh, I think it’s enough if I say it’s enough. Let go of your arse, grab your cock. Spread your legs, let me see."
He shook his head. He needed to tell Draco, but he didn’t want to. He was afraid the other boy would take it too much to heart, that the rejection would wedge its way between them. It was as if all a sudden, the future he’d let himself imagine had been nabbed from him, and he was staring down the barrel of...what? A year training, he supposed, but was there any point? Would any team take him, especially once he and Draco were living at the same address? Or did he have to start looking around for some other profession he might enjoy? There were worse things than not having it all sorted at eighteen, he supposed, but it still felt like a void where there’d previously been light.
Draco was torn between losing his balance and actually having to touch the handrail above him. Another lurch, and he settled unhappily for the latter and Harry reluctantly let his hand fall away. “Never again,” Malfoy vowed, “your cousin better be an absolutely fucking delight.”
“Well?” Draco prompted. “What’s happened? You had me quite convinced accepting the offer was out of the question.”
“Clark,” Mother responded affectionately, returning the embrace then stepping back to put her hands on Clark’s bony shoulders. “Look at you, I’m sure you’ve grown four inches since Easter!”
“Merlin, Malfoy! I’m just trying to keep you and your friends and kids like Hiram from having the stuffing knocked out of them for no good reason. If you have a better idea, I’m all ears!”
“Fuck,” Malfoy murmured a moment later, exhaling painfully, “Yeah, it’s gone. Merlin, what the hell was that?”
“There are instructions on the back, or I can just show you, see if I still have the muscle memory after all these years.”
“It would be my pleasure,” Hermione said, and she strode off toward the common room, leaving a quivering, raging, and powerless Jones in her wake.
Harry awoke early that last morning in Grimmauld Place, curled close to Draco. Pale winter light seeped in through the cracks around curtains in the ugly little room, illuminating the overwrought furniture and musty carpet. He tightened the arm he had slung over Draco’s waist and nuzzled his face into the pale skin of his neck, inhaling the sweet smell of his shampoo.
“I don’t think you are quite the same as Potter,” Draco went on, thoughtfully, “I think if you are really committed to learning this, you will. What you need to get out of your head is all this worry about judgement. Do you think all your muggle anarchists are worried about what other people think?”
of all people. I’m not sure if I’d be so easy to forget it all, if it was one of my kids who had been hurt.”
Potter managed to school his features into something slightly less mirthful, even if his damn eyes still exposed his amusement. “What’s so bad about that, though, hm? I want to do it again, too, you know.”
“He was a child, Harry. What would Jamie do now if your life was threatened as Narcissa Malfoy's was, do you think? He’s nearly the same age as Malfoy was when he was forced to choose between his family and his headmaster."
“Oi, Jamie!” Fort called out, launching a grape over Ri’s head into Jamie’s temple. It didn’t hurt, but Jamie rubbed the spot all the same and glowered at her.
“Well, I wasn’t exactly acting,” Harry retorted, “I would like people to stop being such ruddy arseholes and make an attempt to get along. I’m just relieved I got through to some of them at least.”
“No,” Harry said sternly, though Merlin knew he wanted that sweet fucking mouth on his cock. He took Draco’s eager face in one firm hand, looking down at him. Those pale grey eyes flashed with needy agitation and Harry gave him a knowing grin. “Seems as though you’re forgetting how this works.”
Clark resumed his seat, a bit glossy from the sweat of all the waving and shouting, cheeks as pink as his hair.
They barely made it out into a corridor before Draco yanked Harry into an empty classroom, slamming him up against the wall, mouth fixed to his.
“No,” Draco admitted after a moment. He was oddly relieved to get at least that much out in the open. “Probably not.”
“Perhaps you ought to find better ways of meeting blokes,” Harry suggested gruffly. Not, he realised, that
Draco examined the idea, and his response to it. He didn’t have the niggling jealousy he surely would have felt in his youth. Instead he found only curiosity and the pointed desire to be once again on the receiving end of all that ragged, crackling potential. He would be no match for the man, if it came down to it, and that fascinated and enticed him.
Still unsettled with the ideas he was unbottling, Harry propped his feet up on the squat coffee table between them and sighed.  “It’s like this: When I was a kid, Molly Weasley read some nonsense piece in a magazine about Hermione jilting me in love or some rubbish and instead of just asking us about it, she was really rather horrid to Hermione. Jamie’s a bit like that now, too. He’ll spend days chewing on something I’ve done or some throwaway comment I’ve made, gathering self-righteous anger around him like a great billowing cloak, interpreting everything I do as a mark against me, and further evidence of injustice for him to hurl at me later. It’s about as charming as it sounds. You know what I mean?”
Scor only shrugged. “Might have been. I remember seeing a unicorn in a golden cage. I got terribly upset, inconsolable, really. I think I begged Father to let us leave.”
reanimated corpse. I mean, he’s not Harry’s corpse, not like that, eurgh. I just meant that he’ll be obliged to take pity on me.” Ron paused and stretched his neck from side to side, finishing off his last sip of whisky. He extended his neck so that the crown of his head was pressed against the supportive back cushion of the sofa, and looked up at Draco assessingly. “Think I might be a bit sloshed," he noted mildly. Then, jaw dropping and with an accusatory finger leveled at Draco, he exclaimed, "Hey! You do know which Weasley I am!”
, in a way which was more appealing than it ought to have been. Bloody hell, Draco liked the sheer breadth of him, the square shoulders and those solid, powerful thighs, the evidence of all that physical strength Harry never used for harm. Draco wanted nothing more but to be overwhelmed by it all. “More than fine actually.”
Tomorrow would be a fresh start, Harry reaffirmed as he tracked Meat Pie’s flight path across the waning moon. Tomorrow, they’d all be somewhere new, and maybe, with a little help, he could start to staunch the flow of grief that poured from his family.
“Fine,” Al muttered. “I’m sorry for losing it with you, I know you didn’t mean Scor any harm. And I guess you can spend time with Scorpius. But only if I’m busy.”
For the very briefest of moments, Harry felt Clark’s hand slip tentatively into his as they walked. Then, blushing, Clark pulled away, racing ahead.
Scorpius glanced over at him, trying to express that all was forgiven, but Al was mid-launch, and another bit of parchment hit Scorpius right between the eyes, which caused Al to snort in hysterical laughter. He tried to hide his braying with a loud and obnoxiously insincere sneeze.
Harry just caught himself from saying it out. Only Percy was in the room with him, currently. Ron and Charlie were still downstairs, celebrating. Well, not celebrating exactly, but certainly drinking. No one had been in a particularly celebratory mood for all of Christmas Day, despite Mrs. Weasley's best attempts at cheer.
“Having a good time, are you, love?” Potter asked the baby. “Was hoping you might kip off in the pram.” Potter lifted his gaze. “Sorry, Malfoy,” he began, “We’ve got to be going. If I push Remy’s nap any later, I’ll pay for it for a week. There’s too much excitement around here for him, I think.”
“And we’ll need an act of reparations," Hermione said, "Something subtle. Anonymous, preferably, but that somehow gets leaked. A sizable donation, a gesture on behalf of the Malfoy family. Maybe to war orphans?”
Harry gave an exaggerated yawn and idly extended one of his large feet until it was resting, heel-up near Draco.
When Harry reached them, Draco realised they were trembling, he and Harry both. Nevertheless, he managed to pass off Remy without dropping him. Harry checked the baby over, but Remy seemed more startled than anything, and calmed somewhat once he was settled in Harry’s arms, although his thin, reedy cries continued.
The bank was bustling with holiday shoppers queuing up to access their vaults. The three joined a line.
“Yes, I’m aware,” Harry said dryly, licking a stripe just beside the hole in question. “And you’re mine. All of you. Including your pretty little arsehole, which I fully intend on tongue fucking until you see stars, so stop bloody stalling.”
“Why couldn’t we just do that loud crack-y thing you did last night?” He demanded, when he caught his breath inside the main foyer.
"I see," the Headmistress folded her hands upon the top of her desk, "Let me make some discreet inquiries, see if anyone has noticed anything else about Wilma Brown's behaviour or whereabouts that would give us cause to suspect. I commend you all for bringing this to me. I will be sure to keep you apprised of the situation as it unfolds."
“Manners, please, Lily,” Harry chastised. “You could say hello first before bombarding Professor Malfoy with questions.”
“Are you sure?” Narcissa asked, peering into Draco’s eyes, instead of staring at their clasped hands on the table.
“Oh!” Potter looked surprised, like he hadn’t expected attention to be turned onto himself. “You mean like something you actually might not know?”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco interrupted her, voice chilled. Pansy was circling too close to something aching and undefined within him, and Draco desperately wanted to leave it untouched and unexamined. “I’m not a frightened child anymore. I don’t depend on the praise and validation of others, at least I certainly hope I don’t."
“I thought it was familiar. Good book though, and I’m not sure where my other copy got to. I enjoyed it just as much this time,” Harry commented.
“It’s not that, Dudley,” Harry sighed. “I guess it’s a relief to have someone who was there for all that stand up and say it really was as grim as I remember. That it wasn’t okay for them to have done the shit they did, because it really, really wasn't. I appreciate how you’ve thought about it, how you’re trying to do right by me, I do. I just probably need some time. We’ll get a pint this summer, how about?”
“James, Albus,” Malfoy gave the boys each a nod, before his eyes returned to Harry, who was attempting to shush Remy, still squalling in his arms. “Have I mistaken the date?”
“Well, yes, but he’s still dealing with his feelings,” Hermione tried to explain, “I could barely convince him to come with me to school, and he’s been very distant all term. I think I hurt his feelings when I left him at The Burrow.”
“Is my mind close enough to human’s for your spell to work on me? That is a question indeed.” The Ravenclaw ghost gave him a pensive look.
“You’ve been so good,” Harry said, just letting words fall from his mouth without thinking. “You took everything I wanted you to take, I can see it on your skin, the way you’re burning for me. You’ll feel those marks all night. And tomorrow. You’ll see them on your skin every day and know it was me who put them there. And what’s more, you begged for them. You’ve been incredible, Draco, so good for me. Finish me off now, babe, and then you can come too, I want you to.”
“Yeah,” Clark agreed, “To see my mum and brother. Mum hasn’t exactly been in touch; she can’t adjust to the owl post thing, I don’t think.”
James snorted, “My father do a mending spell? He wouldn’t know where to begin. Mum took care of all that.”
After dinner, with Remy safely asleep in his swing, Harry set about clearing both tables and tackling the dishes.
“I’m wild and untamed,” Pansy corrected, her dark eyes sparkling. “Now, tell me! Was Paulo everything you were hoping and more? Are you leaving the continent to wed?”
“It’s a nice idea, mate, but you know he’s sitting across the room, right?” Ron asked, “Like, I can see him from here, even.”
“Come on, Scor,” Al mumbled. “Let’s get your things.” The two boys left the drawing room and for one final blessed moment, Harry and Draco were alone.
