Harry nevybíravě zaklel, kousl ho do krku a s výkřikem se udělal. Draco ho následoval a sotva orgasmus odezněl, napadlo ho, že tohle bylo mnohem lepší, než jak si představoval, že by to s Potterem mohlo být.
„Rone, někde jsem zapomněla učebnici Věštění z čísel, pomůžeš mi se po ní podívat?“ zvedla se Hermiona, hned jak skončily Lektvary a už Rona táhla ke dveřím. Harry se tázavě podíval na Draca a ten přikývl.
Přesto ale Harry neměl náladu na bolavé vzpomínky, které bez varování útočily na jeho mysl. Kývl hlavou k východu a komnatu opustili. Draco automaticky zamířil pryč, ale Harry ho zadržel:
„Nebuď srab, Harry. Podívej, ani nebyli unavení.“
Draco zavrčel, přetočil Pottera pod sebe, a zatímco jeho krk zasypával polibky a drobným kousáním, zbavoval ho košile, aby měl prostor ke zkoumání. Ten okamžitě náležitě využil a dlaní hladil boky, jazykem a zuby zkoumal bradavky, kůži na krku nebo na břiše, kde ho magneticky přitahoval proužek černých chloupků. Nemusel Harryho pobízet, aby mu doteky a polibky oplácel, naopak Nebelvír byl velmi snaživý a přiváděl Draca k šílenství.
* * * * *
„Blbost, nikdo nemá takovou výdrž.“
Ron s Hermionou dál mizeli, ale Harrymu už to tolik nevadilo – s Dracem si našli vlastní zábavu. Často utíkali do Komnaty nejvyšší potřeby, do prefektských koupelen nebo na pozemky, zkrátka na místa, kde mohli být sami, stranou od ostatních. Kupodivu neměli jen sex, ale byli schopní se spolu i bavit. Ventilovat myšlenky a názory bez urážek toho druhého. A bylo to oběma příjemné.
Draco se stranil všech a věnoval se čistě studiu, zjevně neměl ve škole nikoho, s kým by se bavil. Harry nepochyboval, že mladší Zmijozelové ho mezi sebe zpět nepřijali, Mrzimoři byli pod jeho úroveň a od Havraspárských ho odrazovala Lenka, která byla na Malfoye až příliš excentrická.
„Harry! Kde jsi, u Merlina, byl? Všude jsme tě hledali!“ sepsula ho Hermiona, sotva se s Dracem usadili ke stolu.
„Věř tomu nebo ne, ale v jeho přítomnosti se přemýšlí dobře,“ odsekl Harry. „A nemusíte mě hlídat na každým kroku. Jsem dospělý a schopný se o sebe postarat,“ dodal podrážděně a úplně ho přešla chuť k jídlu. Co jsou? Jeho rodiče? A proč se najednou zajímají?
„Jak to děláš, že to dokážeš jedenáctkrát?“ Ron zmateně zamrkal.
* * * * *
„Teprve?! Sakra, Harry, je teprve jedenáct. Představ si, že už bys za sebou měl třikrát sex.“
„Au! Šlap si po svých, Pottere!“ napomenul ho Zmijozel polohlasně a párkrát přešlápl.
„No, Malfoyi, zase jen my dva. Měl bys otočit stránku, tuhle čteš už dobrou půlhodinu.“ Malfoy poslušně otočil stránku.
„Buď v klidu. Bylo to jen chvilkový poblouznění, než jsem zjistil, že mě mnohem víc zajímá pěkně tvrdý chlapský tělo.“
„To nejsi ani trochu zvědavý?“ kývl Draco hlavou k portrétu, za kterým dva Nebelvíři zmizeli.
„Šestkrát,“ oplatil Harry.
Draco s Harrym udané tempo vydrželi dva dny, pak se pohádali, přiznali si, že Ron je sexuální bůh hodný uctívání, ale že vyrovnat se mu vlastně vůbec nepotřebují, a ustálili se na snesitelném průměru jednou za den nebo dva. Noci trávili většinou společně v Dracově ložnici, protože jako jediný osmák ve Zmijozelu měl celý pokoj jen a jen pro sebe.
„Stejně to nechápu,“ rozhodil Draco rukama, zatímco se chystal do postele, kde na něj už Harry čekal.
Harry chvíli mlčel, pak si odkašlal. „Žádný nemám.“
Harry zakryl překvapení z toho, že na něj Malfoy vůbec promluvil a pokrčil rameny. „No co, myslel jsem, že dnes jíme prostě tady.“
„To je ono. Přesně. Díky.“ Podíval se na Draca, který měl taky oči navrch hlavy. „Ne, dozadu ne! Víš co, to nemá cenu. Měli bychom jít. Stejně za chvíli začíná hodina a ti dva na nás určitě čekají.“ Hermiona zněla podrážděně a Draco s Harrym se rychle vrhli do chodby, kterou přišli, a utíkali, co mohli.
„To není možný. Když to dokážou oni dva, tak my taky.“
Než ale Ron stačil odpovědět, ujala se slova ředitelka školy a vyžádala si jejich plnou pozornost.
„Možná,“ zamumlal Draco tlumeně, jak měl tvář zabořenou do hábitu zmuchlaného na lavici v provizorní polštář.
„Který chci ošukat? Jo.“
„Sexznam, u Merlina. To jsi panic?“ protočil Draco oči a netečně pokračoval v nabírání své ovesné kaše. Harry to nekomentoval a soustředil se, aby nezrudnul. A to panic vážně nebyl.
No dobře, dokázal, ale nechtěl, jasné?
„Nebuď směšný, pravděpodobně si ani nevšimli, že chybíme. Mají hlavu tak plnou jeden druhého, že my jsme to poslední, co je zajímá.“
„Tak už to neřeš. Nebo se Rona zeptej, jak to dělá. Třeba na to je nějaké kouzlo.“
„Malfoyi!“ chytil ho Harry za rukáv, ale Zmijozel už prolézal otvorem za portrétem.
„Zbláznil ses?“ vyjel po něm Malfoy ostře a za loket ho vytáhl do stoje, jako by ho posílal pryč.
Draco se odtáhl a lapal po dechu, jak mu Harry zatěžkával hrudník.
A než stačil cokoliv říct nebo udělat, Draco se v jeho sevření uvolnil a zároveň zvedl hlavu, aby zajal Harryho rty. Polibek byl vláčný, Dracovy rty měkké a teplé a Harry dokázal myslet jen na to, jak přesně k němu pasují. Zasténal do Dracových úst, když se špičky jejich jazyků dotkly, a když se propletly, přitiskl se k blonďákovi co nejblíž. Chtěl víc, cítit ho, dotýkat se, milovat se s ním…
Dělá si prdel? Pomyslel si Harry, když pochopil, že Malfoy se před ostatními vrací ke své masce.
„Možná?“ pokrčil Harry ramenem. Draco přešel třikrát podél stěny a Harry ho následoval, když se před nimi otevřely dveře.
Přál jim jejich štěstí, ale tak nějak doufal, že prožije klidný rok se svými přáteli, ne se zombie, která nereaguje. Cítil se osamělý a možná trochu žárlil, že Ron s Hermionou měli jeden druhého. Stávalo se, že Hermiona řekla narážku, Ron se rozesmál, Harry jen zmateně zamrkal a vůbec nic nepochopil a nastalo trapné ticho, kdy si všichni uvědomili tu propast…
having your own
Harry begins to shake his head.
But until such time, he stands half an inch shorter than him and at least a head shorter than Draco and Blaise, so he turns expectantly to the two of them now.
”But first…” he says warmly, clearly picking up his speech where he’d left off. ”Allow me to announce the winner of this year’s House Cup…”
Unforgivable curses that night, and if they weren’t conjured with Krum’s wand nor Harry’s own — you’re welcome to check his wand right now — they must have come from a third one, as I’m sure you’ll agree?”
”My turn?” he says, even as he feels his eyelids grow heavier and heavier.
”What?” Harry demands again.
”I wouldn’t worry about it, Harry”, Remus says kindly. ”It sounds like he was just trying to avoid the Cruciatus curse or worse…”
”Really?” Harry says.
”Merlin, he’s shaking like a leaf…” Madam Pomfrey whispers.
”Are you… I mean…” Harry hesitates, then tries again. ”Are you okay?”
Suddenly the dense wall of the rose bushes behind Harry and Ron is blasted apart and as the light of the moon outside spills in through the hole, it illuminates the silhouettes of two other students before they run through the hole with startled yelps.
Dawlish and Williamson exchange an uncertain look.
”It’s absolutely mental”, Sirius growls, sending his husband a glare.
”Oh, I see… sick of me already, are you?” Harry says wryly.
”And Severus Snape.”
He takes a shuddering breath, which immediately morphs into a sob.
She tries to dig her heels in but simply ends up sliding along the stone floor and flailing with her arms. Harry ends up more or less dragging her across the corridor while she desperately tries to comb her fingers through her hair. She also keeps pinching her own cheeks for whatever reason and Harry shakes his head.
The man’s robes are torn and bloody, his gaunt face is scratched like he’s been stumbling through the forest for days — and maybe he has, he certainly looks exhausted enough!
”No”, Harry gasps again, squeezing his eyes shut.
that…” the girl mutters with an eye-roll.
”Okay”, Harry says uncomfortably. ”Well, like I said, it’s a good thing the prophecy got lost… then…”
”Oh… All right…” Diggory mumbles. ”Parkinson?”
Before he can try and locate the direction of his own disembodied voice, a guttural scream cuts through the night and sends chills up his spine.
”Harry…”
But the tension between his House and the other three is really something that he could do without. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, as they leave a drizzly March behind and trudge into a dreary April, Harry and the rest of the Fifth Years become more and more aware of the impending O.W.L.s and feeling the stress more and more keenly.
”Stand back!” Lockhart says loudly, ignoring him.
to conjure it?”
”I do
”Ministry, is it?” he greets Ogden sourly.
”Draco
of them. Something off, and wrong, and the fact that they look and sound so familiar just highlights it and makes Harry feel uneasy.
”I’ll see you guys in class”, Harry says hurriedly as the two Gryffindors begin to bicker and he slips out of the library just as the bell rings.
Draco lets out an impatient huff and leans over, grabbing Harry’s hand and physically makes him stir his potion clockwise.
”I know”, Harry says shortly, silently adding
He spots Blaise watching the two of them on the other side of the room and makes his way over.
Pulling on Harry’s hand, he leads the way to the carriage, shoving a few third-years out of the way in the process.
”Well?” Riddle prompts. ”How did you manage to survive?”
”Oh yeah”, Seamus pipes up on the other side of Draco. ”Pucey was practically draped over Flint all throughout dinner, but apparently he threw a paddy again in the Common Room later…”
”You’ll see”, Draco says and smirks.
”We have to practise all weekend —!”
about Hogwarts…
”Oh yeah…” Harry says, shaking his hand. ”I think I recognize you… you work with my dad…”
Draco tilts his head and plants a soft kiss to the inside of Harry’s wrist. And just like that, both the hurry and the awkwardness drain from the moment, leaving it heavy with affection instead. So heavy, it almost makes it hard for Harry suck some air into his lungs.
” the woman asks curiously, leaning in to peer at Harry’s forehead.
”All done?” Draco says when Harry rolls up the letter and puts his ink well and quill away.
”How was Divination?” Harry asks innocently, smiling down at his essay.
”I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ’Arry Potter in person”, the dwarf proclaims and starts plucking at his harp.
Suddenly Harry’s bare arms and the back of his neck are showered with a spatter of cold water and he yelps, scrambling frantically to pull the cover over himself. However Draco pulls it right out of his hands and the next thing Harry knows, the blonde has shoved his whole head — wet hair and all — into the crook of his neck.
”Why don’t you try listening for a second instead…” Remus says, letting go of his shoulders again. ”I’m trying to ask you if you would like to come with us—?”
A sudden cacophony of exclamations and gasps erupt in the room and Harry’s heart jumps into his throat, pounding furiously as he holds his hands out, barely refraining from backing up against the closed door behind him.
Harry feels his cheeks flush again, especially when Seamus and Blaise both mutter, ”
” Sirius barks.
Draco fingers the hem of his night shirt, avoiding Harry’s eyes for a moment. Harry glances around at the others, but everyone else seem to have gone to sleep already. Draco swallows a couple of times and then finally looks up at Harry through his lashes, looking quite shy suddenly, and Harry is reminded again of what Remus told him about Draco showing him another side if only Harry got to know him better.
"It's a party. What could go wrong?"
”Oh…” Draco blinks in surprise, his gaze flitting to Harry’s right hand fleetingly. ”I don’t know. I think she might have been fired — I mean, the official story is she resigned because she was needed at the Ministry.”
”I have a free period now, Sir”, Harry smirks. ”But I’ll get out of your hair. Thank you.”
”The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day”, the woman’s voice says and the door slides open.
”Okay, in case your daddy is right and you
But Draco is right, with only one open spot, they know for sure that they won’t both make the team. At least if there were two or more spots open, there would be a tiny possibility that they could both make the team and so they could happily fantasize about that whilst practising their flying all weekend… Now, they’re definitely each other’s competition.
finally, he thinks hopefully.
”Of course we are”, Draco says, forgetting to whisper. ”What do you mean?”
, Harry thinks, feeling himself sag a little with relief.
”Yes”, McGonagall says curtly. ”Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time — it’s my understanding that he received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic this morning and he flew off for London at once.”
”That’s because gentlemen don’t kiss and tell”, Blaise counters smoothly. ”And before you say it — I’m not talking about
”Oh…” Slughorn says, blinking a few more times.
”So why d’you think it’s important — the stuff, you know the things he stole from them other kids in the orphanage?” Seamus asks him curiously, side stepping a Moly plant gingerly as they trudge across the vegetable patch towards greenhouse five.
He twists around and stares up at her with a frown. Her magnified eyes are bulging more than ever behind her spectacles and she looks positively excited.
They reach the very last house on
Draco gives him a sympathetic look and pats his knee awkwardly.
— causing the Gryffindor boy to trip over for real and land with a muffled
he thinks desperately.
Griselda Marschbanks, the Head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority, stands next to the desk and waits for them all to find a seat, then turns the hour-glass and tells them to begin.
”Okay”, Harry says.
Looking around in a panic, he sees Seamus’ light blue dress robes slung carelessly over the footboard of his bed and on the hangings of the four-poster next to it, Blaise’s dress robes are hung with a Temporary Sticking Charm. They’re a nice, subtle ox blood.
Pretending to hold up his measuring cup to make sure he’s poured enough armadillo bile into it, Harry sneaks a quick look at the two professors. Karkaroff definitely looks agitated now, fidgeting at Snape’s shoulder and looking around worriedly while Snape continues to glare across the classroom, looking angrier than Harry has seen him in a while… His dark eyes flicker down to meet Harry’s and Harry quickly ducks his head again, adding some more armadillo bile to the measuring cup.
Harry and his friends make a beeline for Professor Snape who promptly instructs them to line up, but let the first-years come to the front. They all look around and swiftly start ushering all the short, baby-faced and scared-looking boys and girls in Slytherin ties to the front. One girl yelps when Pansy grabs the hood of her cloak, her arms flailing in protest as he whimpers ”I’m in second year!”
”Well, that’s hardly an option, now is it…” Remus murmurs not unkindly, giving his husband a pinched smile.
Draco chuckles silently, stealing Harry’s glass from him so that he can lean in for a kiss.
say when I’m older!” Harry snarls.
”O-oh… Ehm… whaa… what would you like me t-to say… then…?”
”Oh, I wouldn’t worry, dear…”
”FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC”, he reads the headline, then cranes his neck and tilts his head awkwardly to read the smaller print of the actual article, as Draco looks up and stares around him eagerly.
”Get up…”
Draco lingers in front of Harry, his eyes boring into him with meaning, but eventually he steps back and returns to the grown-ups.
at him, he just shrugs.
”I’m surprised none of them got expelled actually”, Parkinson says, looking decidedly disappointed about it.
insist on going away for the full moon now that I know, even though you drink Wolfsbane and I keep telling you it’s perfectly safe, because you don’t like the idea of transforming near me,
”— to join me in a brief reconstruction? Come now, don’t be shy!”
”I have given evidence in this matter already”, he says calmly. ”Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater, but prior to the Lord Voldemort’s downfall he turned spy for us at great personal risk… he is now no more a Death Eater than I…”
”GET OFF ME,
A small sliver of golden light appears at their feet. It grows steadily until the whole box is blasted with light. Harry blinks. The box comes to a shuddering stop on the gleaming hardwood floor and the sense of deja vú is so strong, Harry keeps glancing at the two professors on either side of him, just to remind himself that he’s not with his dad.
— and twists the doorknob; the door flies open as he yanks on it and almost knocks him in the face before he throws himself inside, looking around in panic —
in the middle of the hallway, Harry draped over Remus’s shoulder like a cried-out toddler…
Snape’s eyes flicker up to meet his again, so Harry nods again.
Professor Umbridge’s smile widens again and she straightens up to her fullest height (which isn’t very impressive, but she still manages to look imposing behind her teacher’s desk), and Harry is perversely pleased to see that her forehead is a little shinier now.
”Chocolate is your answer to everything”, Harry mumbles good-naturedly, smiling around the piece of chocolate before biting a large chunk out of it and chewing happily.
”Draco”, Snape snaps and the blonde startles slightly. ”Take this and go wait for Harry in the Common Room.”
They walk in silence for a moment, but Draco obviously isn't done having fun because he soon resumes his Colin Creevy impersonation. Harry just laughs and shakes his head. Suddenly, he hears something though... Another voice under Draco's high-pitched, mocking one... An icy, venomous one that sends a chill down his spine...
was in the room with him.
trapped in his throat growing bigger and itchier by the minute, but he manages to restrain himself before he spits it out.
”Good. That’s good… And ehh… Did you and Draco talk…?”
That is, until they’re playing Ravenclaw and Goyle ”accidentally” sends a Bludger into Harry’s back that nearly knocks him off his broom.
”I’m — I’m s-sorry,
”Don’t be ridiculous, Potter”, McGonagall says dismissively. ”You’re a Gryffindor—”
”Yes”, she mutters.
”Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, Harry Potter, Sir! Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby a job, Sir!”
”You’re not allowed to use it for exams!” Seamus snaps, pointing an accusatory finger at him.
Draco gives him a small smile, but says nothing.
Snape glowers at him, the effect hightened by the dramatic swirls of potion fumes in the air.
”Mr Lupin left last night”, Madam Pomfrey says over her shoulder. ”I’m not sure he’s coming back…
He starts off towards the stairs straight ahead that he knows will lead him to the fourth floor of the main castle, which is the quickest route to Gryffindor tower. But almost immediately, he notices that the two men behind him haven’t followed and pulls to a stop to give them another questioning look.
would have some explaining to do…”
, he reads and quickly grabs his quill to begin to write again…
”Whoa, you guys”, Blaise says and smooths out his copy of the Daily Prophet. ”Someone’s broken in at Gringotts!”
”I think she would”, Harry shrugs.
”Good morning”, the students mumble as one.
Harry frowns.
”, Snape says loudly and clearly over the ruckus of everyone gathering up their things, and then ignoring the collective groan that this homework assignment garners, continues, ”on the ways you recognise werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want it by Monday morning… Class dismissed.”
”Hem, hem…”
The snoring stops with a sudden snort.
”Well… You know there are no official records of house-elves and their names, since they belong to the same wizarding family all their lives… I could ask around, see if anyone’s heard of a house-elf named — what was it, Dotty? — Yeah, but unless we happen to know the family he serves, it’s unlikely we’ll find him — I’ll ask around, though!” Sirius adds firmly as Harry’s face falls.
Again, his mind is flooded with images of his dads; horrible fantasies of the look on their faces as his dead and mangled body is dumped on their doorstep, like some hateful special delivery in the green glow from the Dark Mark conjured over the cottage… and he imagines Dumbledore standing up in front of the whole school in the Great Hall and making a small speech where he tells them all, and then Trelawny nodding sombrely as if to say,
Harry shakes his head —
”WHAT THE BLOODY HELL ARE THEY DOING HERE?”
”You’re not… mad?” Harry asks carefully.
Harry… Beg for death and Lord Voldemort shall comply… you see, I’m not heartless — not anymore, thanks to you —  so
as Remus calls it. But in the next moment, Sirius’ face clears again and with a deep breath, he sits up a little straighter and grins somewhat convincingly.
But on the morning of his sixteenth birthday, it’s neither. In fact, it’s not any kind of sound that wakes him up, but rather sensation.
“Shove off, Finnegan”, Pansy grouses, grabbing Harry roughly by the arm and steering him back towards the doors. “Let’s just get this over with!”
”Weasley, skin Malfoy’s Shrivelfig”, Snape says smoothly, then turns to give Seamus a sharp look when the boy lets out a snort of laughter.
”Fine, thank you”, Granger says. ”How are
”Harry, will you accompany Draco to the Hospital Wing?” Snape says smoothly.
”What”, Harry says flatly.
Draco sits back up and raises an eyebrow at Harry.
”Yeah”, Harry mutters.
when Remus would read them to him when he was younger and charm the book to make the illustrations come alive…
Harry looks up in surprise. The man gives his powdered beetle eyes a meaningful look, frowning deeply. Harry hurries to tip them into his cauldron, then reaches for his ginger roots instead and begins to cut them into even pieces.
”Nothing”, Harry says. ”I didn’t say anything. Ma’am.”
reassuring”, Sirius grumbles.
The crowd applauds again, cheering excitedly this time. Harry finds himself pushed away from Lockhart again, but before he can slip away completely, someone thrusts a whole tower of books into his arms and he almost trips over.
and it’s
”Cool…” Harry says, smiling for the first time, but then he remembers what Professor Snape told him and his face falls again. ”Oh, ehm, actually… I should probably tell you, as a champion I have to dance at least once, to… er, open the ball. It’s tradition apparently, so… if you’re okay with that—?”
Harry allows Malfoy to lead him by the hand all the way to the dorm, feeling like he’s walking through a dream the whole time. He’s not entirely sure how his legs are moving at all.
”Now, let us take a moment to just consi—” Dumbledore interrupts gently.
”Barty Crouch!”
But something catches his eye, distracting him… He squints into the darkness of the room… There it is again, something glinting in the far end of the room. He pushes away from the wall and walks closer to it…
”Hm?” Harry mumbles, lining up the ingredients in the order in which he’ll need them.
, but he has no idea what it might be now…
”No? You didn’t think that was entertaining? Everyone else certainly did. Your fathers were definitely popular when we were at school — all three of them!” He snarls.
”Potter, I know what I’m talking about!” she says shortly and waves her wand at the books and makes them pile up in her arms again. ”I suggest you two go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.”
”Probably not a good idea…” he says finally, a hint of regret in his eyes.
Remus looks over at Seamus and favours him with an equally hard look, ”Firewhiskey?”
Harry cries, his voice muffled by the cloth shoved into his mouth.
real—!”
”He answered the question”, Ginny says again, glaring at Blaise. ”Give him the bottle. It’s his turn.”
gone as long as there were people at Hogwarts who believed in him, and that
The stones in the wall start to wriggle, just like the wall concealing the entrance to Diagon Alley, and Harry smiles to himself as they rearrange themselves to create a narrow archway.
Harry grins and nods.
”Secondly”, Dumbledore says as soon as the noise dies down again. ”Since Professor Kettleburn retired last year in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs, our gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid has agreed to take up the position as Care of Magical Creatures teacher in addition to his gamekeeping duties!”
Harry doesn’t need to be told twice.
”No — I mean yes, but — you don’t understand”, Harry shakes his head in frustration, dislodging the man’s fingers in the process. ”
”Yes…” Remus says slowly. ”Go on…”
The magical eye seems to be quivering in its socket and a grim smile stretches the Ex-Auror’s lop-sided mouth. Harry represses a shiver.
Kicking the sweaty covers away from him and peeling off his soaked pyjamas, Harry grabs a towel and some clothes from the trunk by the end of the bed and makes his way out of the dorm.
So as soon as Draco’s eyes narrow and he snatches Harry’s hand from where he’s holding it gingerly in front of him, and holds it up for a better look, Harry sighs and tells him everything.
”Yes,
”Sirius.”
Sirius says nothing, just smiles and leans in to peck his husband on the side of the mouth.
Harry lets out a huff.
”No”, Lucius says in a clipped tone and glares down at his pocket watch again.
”Harry …”
”Sorry for being… you know…” he murmurs quietly.
Harry’s pulse steadily picks up its pace as he listens to Moody and one quick glance around the classroom tells him the rest of the class is equally excited — even Draco, although the blonde looks slightly resentful about it…
Harry is reminded of his own broom back home and feels a flutter of excitement in his belly. He glances over at the other boy, catching his curious, steel grey eyes briefly before he quickly looks away again, pretending to be bored once more. Harry smiles to himself, if only he could tell this boy… He would be so impressed with Harry if he knew… if he realised that Harry had similar intentions of smuggling a broom into Hogwarts, that they had that in common… Maybe they could even become friends…
Wheeling around, Harry stares in horror at the gleaming, silver mask that emerges out of the shadows like a disembodied, floating skull leering at him, before the shape of a man draped in black robes appears around it, the long platinum blonde hair that Harry knows belongs to the voice, hidden for the moment under a black hood.
”I know”, he mutters and forces another morsel down, swallowing several times to keep it down.
literally explodes out of her mouth with such force that her hands fly away from her mouth, and she more or less dives out the door to a deafening roar of laughter that erupts from the students (and some teachers) behind her.
”I think that sounds like a reasonable idea…” Remus says in a level tone of voice. ”Did it work?”
He scrambles out from under the desk, wand still held out at the ready in front of him and adrenaline pumping through him. The Death Eater is fumbling to catch his wand again as it goes flying up into the air and while he’s off guard, Harry hurls another Stunning Spell at him. It hits him straight in the chest just as he manages to get a secure grip on his wand again and he goes flying backwards, smashing into a bookcase and knocking an antique carriage clock down that promptly falls on his head.
”I’m making chocolate”, Remus annouces.
”Just answer the question”, Remus snaps.
”Now can we eat…?” He mutters after a moment and Harry chuckles and nods.
Harry feels his cheeks heat up slightly, but smiles at her and shakes her hand. He glances over at Draco shyly and it strikes him for the first time that the meagre inches of his own growth spurt is nothing compared to the blonde’s transformation. Draco is now almost a head taller than him and although his frame is still lithe, his shoulders have definitely started to broaden... Harry flushes deeper as Draco catches him staring.
Despite Draco being careful and barely even touching the cut with his own fingertips, the contact with the salve stings before the magical properties of the salve begins to work and Harry bites the inside of his cheek to keep from wincing in pain, and by the time Draco has finished, a metallic taste has filled his mouth.
”We should get up”, Draco grins happily.
”How did you—?”
”Well, alright then”, he says, before she can come up with something. ”We’re going to the party. Why don’t you go on ahead and I’ll put all of these back…”
Pansy snatches the paper from them and huddles together with Daphne to read the article as well. Harry watches them warily, waiting for their reactions, half-expecting smirks or giggles, but to his surprise and relief, they continue to frown. Finally, they look up again.
”O-oh, erm, yeah”, Harry mumbles, blushing. ”S-sure, of course. S-sorry I didn’t, you know, sooner.”
”Yeah…” Harry says slowly, unable to tear his eyes away from the other boy’s body. ”Remind me again why we can’t stay in bed all day?”
The next day being a Saturday, Draco allows Harry to sleep in to a reasonable time in the morning and the fact that he doesn’t insist on dragging Harry out of bed before dawn lures Harry into a false sense of security and he thinks, rather naively, that the blonde has calmed down and possibly even dropped the idea of getting back at Umbridge, but as they make their way out of the Great Hall again after breakfast and Draco immediately pulls Harry towards the great marble staircase instead of the direction of the dungeons, he begins to suspect this was rather foolish of him…
He wanders the castle aimlessly for a while, feeling sorry for himself again and almost wishing he would run into Peeves, just for the excuse to relieve some of his frustration.
”Wh-what was it…?”
”Nice loud howl, Harry!”
”We will all do our best to restore everyon to their rightful places as soon as possible”, Dumbledore says, looking between all of them. ”But if it should take a while… Can I count on the two of you housing our… Guest… During the summer?”
had a fright, then …”
”No really. We’ll talk in the morning. Good night, Harry.”
They’re just getting ready to leave when Draco bursts through the door, breathing hard as if he’s been running the whole way from the Divinations classroom in the North Tower, his eyes wide with panic and immediately, Harry’s shackles go up and his heart begins to beat wildly.
”Give me your hand…” he says quietly.
— come here — I’’ll — I’ll kill you —!”
He feels cool glass touch his lips and opens his mouth to drink the potion. It burns down his throat and fills him with warmth. He coughs a little and splutters, but manages to get it all down. His daddy murmuring encouraging nonsense to him the whole time and then gently lowers his head again. Harry feels his muscles relax as the shock and adrenaline is drained from his system. His mind feels thick and cottony inside his head, and waves of exhaustion travels through his body.
There is a moment of tense silence. Lucius purses his lips and gives Dumbledore grave nod.
Harry let’s go of Draco’s hand and pushes him to the side, manouvering him into the shadows behind one of the pillars.
The soothing sound of running water is broken up by the
”Do we have to do this every year?” Harry mutters.
”Sure, I guess…” Harry mumbles. ”We’ll… We’ll be there…”
, a traitorous voice whispers in the back of his head…
” — that he thought he might miss.
Harry turns to see the Hufflepuff Sixth Year begin to climb the first hedge, his long limbs flowing over the obstacle seemingly without any effort at all, making him look a lot more graceful than either of them had been. Harry scowls to himself and turns back around to face Bagman, but quickly looks down instead when the man gives him one of his infernal winks.
”Just get out”, Harry snaps at him.
Harry’s gaze in immediately drawn to the one part of the Headmaster that is not glittering, mainly his blackened right hand. He remembers seeing it up close at his birthday party and realising that the dark colour was not coated onto the skin, but rather the effect of dead, if not cursed, tissue. A soft gasp next him tells him Pansy must have noticed the hand too, and judging by the wave of whispers sweeping over the Hall, she’s not the only one.
”There’s a picture too, Weasley!” he says loudly. ”There’s a picture of your parents outside their house—”
”You yelled at Professor Umbridge?”
”It’s not important.”
”No, nothing.”
”That doesn’t answer my question”, Draco grumbles and narrows his eyes at him.
, Harry thinks.
Sirius’ anger seems to simmer down finally and he looks regretful as he eyes Harry’s alarmed face.
”Yeah”, Harry says heavily.
He struggles to his feet and focusing on putting one foot in front of the other he starts making his way back out of the forest. It’s not until he slips back inside his dorm and collapses face down on top of his four-poster bed that he relaxes.
”You’re here…” Harry murmurs happily.
Harry doesn’t say — because it really doesn’t matter what the answer is; whatever Draco wants to do, Harry’s answer is still YES! — so he just nods eagerly.
”I dropped… ehm… this”, Harry says, gesturing vaguely with the half-empty bottle of armadillo bile.
I wish you could have been there and seen it —
”I am merely guessing, of course”, Dumbledore says. ”But it is my belief that Merope stopped using magic after her husband abandoned her.”
Draco leans away enough so that Harry can’t capture his mouth again.
”I’m sure.”
”Yes, thank you, Professor”, Pansy says heavily, melting into the settee next to Harry and dabbing at her own forehead with her fingertips.
Harry tries to focus his eyes on him, but his vision has already started to swim.
They order their breakfast and then spends a few moments commenting on the decor and the mood of their host, or rather Draco makes comments, most of them derisive, while Harry listens and grins like an idiot.
”I know about portraits”, Harry says, bringing them back on topic. ”I just don’t know about any Slytherins who are friends with Gryffindors. That’s all.”
Suddenly, there’s a knock on the door and Harry startles.
”It’s always been a wolf”, Remsu says softly. ”Harry… I hadn’t even
”Morning, runt…” Sirius says lightly. ”Did you finish packing?”
”Fine, two minutes — I have an outfit picked out already”, Draco shouts over his shoulder and jogs away from them.
”Muggle-infused fashion is all the rage on the continent, Tonks said”, Sirius says a little defensively. ”Just wait. Around this time next year, all the kids in Britain will be wearing stuff like this!”
double-standard… They don’t care who you keep company with, as long as you marry an appropriate candidate of the opposite gender and produce an heir—”
”Shut up, Malfoy!”
Something about the other boy’s posture, how he seems to just
Harry feels a steadily growing pain start shooting through his boneless arm and winces. Remus immediately loosens his embrace, ”Oh I’m sorry, was I crushing you again?”
”Morning sleepy-head…” Draco says softly. ”Happy Christmas.”
. Can we talk?”
”Are you all right?” Draco frowns.
such a social butterfly…” Draco murmurs, his lips twitching.
”Come on, Draco. They’re going to fight…”
Harry leans back against his pillows and stares up at the canopy above his head. For a while, he tries to make the pieces fit together in any and every other way that he can think of, but none of it makes sense. However, Malfoy following him, hugging him, worrying about Harry being angry with him and then essentially giving him the cold shoulder, and their mutual friends rolling their eyes and making dry remarks about them fighting again and telling Harry to
”Severus”, Dumbledore says placidly. ”You demanded proof and now—”
”You can’t
he’d asked, since he never even noticed the shift when he’d spoken it in Duelling Club… And the blonde had nodded excitedly and… and then he’d made a
” Harry laughs. ”That was brilliant!”
As they enter Lockhart’s office, there is a flurry of movement all around the room as inhabitants of Lockhart’s many portraits of himself leap out of sight but he manages to catch one with his hair in rollers and face smeared with some sort of ghostly white facemask. If the circumstances had been different, and Professor Dumbledore wasn’t putting Mrs Norris’s stiff body down on the desk and her owner Mr Filch wasn’t slumped over in a chair, sobbing desperately, Harry might have struggled not to laugh. As it is, it’s not a laugh obstructing his throat but a massive lump that he swallows convulsively around to try and dislodge, but no matter how hard he swallows, the lump keeps growing bigger.
”That’s barely enough for one person…”
”I had breakfast before I came here—”
Harry nods and disentangles himself from his daddy’s embrace again. He leads him over to the loveseat in front of the fire and moves the Exploding Snap cards out of the way so he can sit down next to him. Clearly unable to maintain any sort of distance, even if it is just a matter of inches, Remus drapes his arm over the backrest just so that he can continue to pet Harry’s hair… Harry doesn’t mind though, he leans into the touch gratefully and sighs.
, he thinks furiously.
”Thank you, Sir”, Harry mumbles. ”Was… Was that what you wanted to talk to me about?”
”Miss Parkinson”, Professor Snape interrupts and the girl jumps, sitting up straight again to accept her timetable from the Head of House.
Looking up into the man’s face, Harry again takes notice of all the other tiny but, the more he looks at them, significant inconsistencies in this Remus’s appearance — And it’s more than just a few grey hairs and lines in the face, it’s the stoop of his shoulders and the look in his eyes, the way he holds himself…
?” Harry frowns.
Harry keeps brooding over it for the rest of the lesson, but finally forgets about it again as they make their way to the next lesson. It’s their first new subject of the year — Divination — and if the long trek up the North Tower wasn’t enough to distract him, the gloomy, incense-heavy classroom surely is.
Draco is now sitting so close to him on the bench that he accidentally elbows him in the chest while cutting into his steak and kidney pie.
”Anyone sitting there?” the boy says and points to the seat opposite Harry. ”Everywhere else is full.”
”Of course they can. I’m not of age yet”, Draco murmurs tonelessly, then he glances over at Harry and gives him a soft look. ”Relax, I’m not going back there.”
”Well, I don’t think we should risk going outside or we’re bound to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris… We’re better off finding some place inside the school.”
”Naturally, naturally…” Dumbledore murmurs. ”But in essence divided?”
”So, what’s the problem?”
the match”, Draco corrects with a smirk. ”I’ll be the one directing the Harry Potter fanclub to cheer —”
As they finish breakfast and make their way to the first lesson of the day, Harry’s good mood quickly deflates again and his nerves kick back in.
”Jolly good — eight o’clock — see you there!”
”Voldemort’s grandfather.”
”You’ll have to talk to Professor Slughorn about using the Potions classroom, it’s really up to him now. I can’t see him objecting, but if he does, you are welcome to use my private lab — for this purpose only!”
(See the end of the chapter for
”Yeah, uh-huh…” Harry nods quickly, while inside his head, his inner voice has forsaken all rational commentary and just moved on to screaming.
Harry lets out a huff of a sigh and shoots the girl a sour look. Of course she can see right through it and grins back. Harry feels his own face twitch with all sorts of repressed amusement, but stubbornly reigns it back in and glares ahead again instead.
”Oh no”, Umbridge says lightly. ”Not with your quill. You’re going to be using a rather special one of mine.”
, his oxygen-deprived brain supplies seconds too late.
Draco gives his head a small shake, without tearing his eyes away from the article on the front page, his face twisting into a rather ugly scowl.
He leans his head into left hand. The palm feels cool and soothing against his feverish skin, but the pain persists and his thoughts feel sluggish inside his head.
as if that’s not a big deal at all.
”What was that—?” Pansy mutters.
Harry blinks, giving his head a small shake. He misheard, he tells himself numbly.
”The school year”, Snape clarifies, his lips twitching in some kind of smirk when Harry slumps in relief.
” Madam Pince hushes aggressively from behind a shelf.
”, it says.
Harry is so excited he can barely sleep a wink all night and asks whether he can have coffee instead of chocolate at breakfast, but Sirius lets him try a sip from his cup and Harry immediately pulls a face at the bitter taste and opts for chocolate in the end after all.
He doubles back and runs to the staff room in the other end of the same level. He knocks on the door, but there’s no answer. He hesitates for a moment, then with his heart hammering he decides to push the door open and peer inside.
Dumbledore had said this was the most important memory, but it was useless. Harry wheels around and glares at the old man as he resumes his seat on the other side of the Pensieve.
Harry sighs, ”I just… I don’t see the point of worrying them, they… they worry too much, especially Remus.”
no, it’s
Harry decides to save the letters for last and reaches for the oldest edition of
”Oh yes…” Moody whispers. ”I hasn’t been easy, I’ve had to use every ounce of cunning I possess to get you through these tasks… although I have to say, you improved significantly after the first one. I was very pleased indeed that I didn’t have to aid you at all in the second one. And I knew, as long as I got you in that maze, preferably with a head start, then I could get you to that Cup… you may have noticed you barely ran into any obstacles inside that maze, well that was because I was patrolling around it, keeping an eye on you…”
Dumbledore is now leaning as far back in his chair as the backrest will allow, holding his hands up in a placating manner. Harry realises he’s got halfway out of his own chair, more or less towering over the desk between them. The effect is nowhere near intimidating, considering the headmaster is still taller than him sitting down. But Harry slumps back in his chair all the same and starts counting backwards from ten in his head like Sirius has taught him.
The sight of the dark waters of the lake reflecting the grey clouds overhead and lapping rhythmically at the shore, makes Harry’s chest feel impossibly tight.
Harry and Draco make their way across the Slytherin Common Room and inside the boys’ dormitory in silence. Not until they’ve both crawled into their respective beds does Harry speak up and tell Draco he’s sorry for getting him into trouble.
The eagle’s eyes seem to glint at him. Harry glares back, rocking his weight onto the pads of his feet and taking a deep breath.
”Come on”, Remus says again and stands up, putting his arm around Harry and leading him down the cobbled street.
”No, I’m fine”, he says, before turning back to Snape with an apologetic look. ”It’s working really well, I’m sleeping loads better, thank you, Sir…”
A look of confusion flickers into Remus face.
”Harry…” Remus murmurs. ”You awake?”
Tearing his eyes away from the picture of Draco, Harry traces the bloodline back to Narcissa and then glances past the charred mark where Andromeda used to be and looks at Narcissa’s sister Bellatrix… there’s something about her heavy-lidded eyes that reminds Harry of something, like he’s seen her somewhere before but he can’t quite put his finger on where… the name too,
”What’s he doing?” Draco whispers in his ear. ”Why is he just standing there? Why doesn’t he call it again?”
Remus pulls back swiftly, even though Harry tries to clutch his shoulders and hold on, and he fixes Harry with an intense look, ”Promise me, Harry!”
”It was found on the body, yes”, Dawlish says, squinting suspiciously at the other man. ”Why do you ask?”
Draco usually does this for him…
Sirius gives a small eyeroll, but smoothly changes the subject again and they all keep chatting light-heartedly until Remus stops puttering around and finally joins them at the table.
”Don’t even”, the man says with an affronted look. ”I’m coming and that’s the end of it!”
It’s not a perfect system, but it works…
”When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent —
”Yeah”, Pansy joins in haughtily, wrinkling her nose at a particularly deep gash in Seamus’ cheek that rather than bleeding is now oozing some kind of transparent liquid. ”How come you didn’t get yourself fixed up before coming here — I

”They can live for hundreds and hundreds of years”, Draco says. ”So it fits… And it will literally kill you just by looking at you! And that ghost girl, she said the last thing she saw before she died was a pair of big eyes!”
Harry somehow doubts Hagrid would do such a thing, but then again if he really is the one who’s been opening the Chamber and letting a monstrous spider loose on innocent students all this time then he obviously isn’t who Harry thought he was…
”You guys go ahead, I just need to talk to Professor Snape, I’ll catch up”, he tells his friends.
Draco knocks his knee against his under the desk and Harry tears his eyes away from Ron and looks at him instead, mouthing
think this means we will make a tradition of sleeping in on the morning of the first of September every year!” Remus growls, the kiss that Sirius plants on his lips barely registering as he continues to glower at the other man. ”Besides, Harry is not sitting on the Hogwarts Express yet. I’ll relax when he is — Harry, come on now!”
”Is there a problem—?”

Harry wheels his head back around and frowns at the other boy. His eyesight may be bad, but the noticeboard is only a few feet away. Does Draco think he can’t read anymore?
— I look like a
”Let’s just have breakfast, I think this is going to take a while”, Remus tells Sirius quietly, a hint of fond amusement in his voice.
He staggers to his feet, careful not to trod on any of the creatures that have now begun to croak and jump around on the floor.
”Even if they don’t get here until the 2
Harry could have sworn the blonde just rolled his eyes at him, but it happened so quickly it could just have been a trick of the light. Draco’s smirk twitches a little, but Harry blinks and the other boy is just as serious as before again.
”Merlin…” Draco huffs and then mutters something else under his breath.
anyway and blushes a bright pink while doing so. Harry smiles fondly, then turns back to his dad.
”No, runt, you know no-one allowed inside… I’ll just be one second though!” Sirius says, shepherding him out of the lift and into a dark corridor with black-tiled walls.
…” Harry stresses. ”They got together in school and they’re the love of each other’s lives.”
”This is good”, Sirius says, breaking Harry out of his thoughts again. ”It means Voldemort won’t ever hear the end of that prophecy…”
”My Lord…” Lucius whispers. ”
”Yeah”, Harry agrees. ”It was… Hey, do you want to go for a fly tomorrow? Before the Feast?”
Harry frowns in confusion.
Damn it…”
”Well, he agreed to give an interview anyway”, Harry says. ”She came to our Care Of Magical Creatures lesson and I heard them decide on a time and place for it—”
”I was going to suggest we take this to a bed…”
Harry scrambles to his feet and backs away from the door as the two of them stride towards it and disappear into the gloom outside the dorm together.
”Of course it is”, Harry mutters, the butterflies in his belly turning to lead.
”How do you know—?”
”Level seven: Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club and Ludicrous Patents Office…” the same woman’s voice that greeted them in the fone-box says to the lift at large, before the lift comes to a clanging stop and the doors open to reveal a rather untidy corridor, walls papered with countless Quidditch posters in a sort of patchwork style.
It could work a little better just at the moment, he thinks. But he figures it’s working as well as it can considering the issue is yet to be resolved and neither of his dads is here with him. Harry sniffles a little and gazes down into the dark beverage. He can’t remember the last time he felt this miserable.
Harry bristles at the word adoptive, but before he can say anything Pansy’s sharp nails have dug into the flesh of his arm and he hisses in pain.
”Let’s go”, Snape says shortly.
”Harry?” Draco’s voice cuts into his reverie.
The stone gargoyle has moved aside, revealing the hidden staircase behind and Professor Snape is stepping off the revolving spiral stairs. He looks just as grim as usual, his dark eyes narrowed into suspicious slits as he beckons Harry closer. Feeling a surge of relief, Harry runs back and nearly crashes into the man in his eagerness.
The next thing he knows, he’s lying curled up under his covers and sunlight is streaming in through the window. He blinks his eyes open and squints out into the room. He can hear at least one of his dads’ tinkering out in the kitchen. He arches his back languidly and stretches his arms over his head, knocking his knuckles against the headboard.
”Harry Potter…”
”Very good, very good, have a point for Gryffindor”, Slughorn says happily, then gestures for the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaws. ”Now, what about this one h—?”
” they can hear Sirius mutter from the kitchen just before they slip out the front door.
Draco’s lips twitch a little, ”Oh, is that all?”
”Harry”, he tries to reason. ”You are not allowed two pets at Hogwarts. That’s the rule. It’s not up to me, I can’t change —”
”No”, Draco says with a frown. ”But still… Can’t hurt to have a look, right?”
The pages of the diary starts flipping of their own accord, as it disturb by a heavy breeze, then finally stops on a particular page and the words
”You, my dear, for example”, she says to Draco, who immediately tenses up as she comes to a stop just behind his chair. ”Were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn… Am I right in saying, my dear, that you were born in mid-winter?”
Harry and Bell quickly shook hands and then stepped back from each other again.
”, Seamus argues.
Looking around, Harry sighs again. Now that his scar has stopped hurting and his nausea has subsided, the whole thing feels even more ridiculous and he really just wants to leave again. But he’d promised Professor Snape he would tell Dumbledore everything, so sits down in the chair in front of the desk and waits for the Headmaster to return.
Harry thinks and gives the stone basin a second look.
He clasps Draco’s limp hand in both of his and holds it firmly, focusing on the feeling of warm skin,
Finally the music stops and the effect is instantaneous. All the men, and the few women, who’d been enthralled by the Veela regain their bearings and those who, like Ron, has tried to clamber out of their boxes and get closer to the pitch, quickly resume their seats as Ludo Bagman introduces the Irish Team’s mascots which unsurprisingly turn out to be a thousand leprechauns, zooming into the Stadium and putting on a magnificent show that culminates in a heavy rainfall of gold coins.
The bed in Professor Snape’s spare bedroom is marginally bigger than the one supplied by the muggles and a lot more comfortable, Harry discovers, gratefully stretching out on top of it before snuggling down under the duvet. He wakes up feeling fully rested for the first time since he left Hogwarts and makes his way into the kitchen with an actual spring in his step. Something that doesn’t go unnoticed by the Potions Master, who gives him an arched look over his shoulder before turning back to the stove.
”I love you too, you know…”
The older Auror huffs out an annoyed sigh and looks over at Sirius for support, but the other man just sneers back.
”N-Nothing… I mean, yeah, I get that… I get it… That must be, ehm, terrible…”
are celebrating…” Draco repeats and gives him a meaningful look.
on the kitchen counter.
”You”, Harry chokes out.
”No”, the blonde murmurs coolly. ”I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Fatbottom to find… How about… up a tree?”
”But nothing. I want to sleep with you tonight.”
Draco leads Harry to the space between their own beds and promptly pushes him to sit down on the edge of his, before he uncorks the small glass jar Professor Snape gave him and scoops up a generous amount of salve on two of his fingers.
Harry feels like someone has just doused him in ice water. It’s obvious to him that his daddy is only regurgitating what Dumbledore has told him to say — which means that he really
doing out there, Sir?” Harry asks carefully. ”You told Dumbledore you heard me—?”
Finally, after a gruelling four hours of training, Flint calls a halt to the practise and the team trots back to the castle in exhausted silence. Harry and Draco collapse into their respective beds as soon as they get to the dorm and Harry feels his eyelids droop the minute his head hits the pillow, only half aware of Draco in the other bed grunting about how he’s fallen out of love with Quidditch…
He pulls out the parchment and unfolds it.
”I’ve been practising the Summoning Charm”, Harry says and bites into one of the rolls. ”I was going to sneak into the kitchen later…”
”Yeah”, Harry says, moving out of the embrace again. ”I guess.”
”You’re joking!” one of the Weasley twins says loudly over at the Gryffindor table, finally breaking the tension in the room and making the other students laugh.
Another heavy silence descends over the group. Draco is glaring at the ground in front of him and hugging himself, but Harry can’t tell if it’s because of the conversation or the cold wind that’s gradually growing stronger around them.
… sorry”, he says. ”I don’t know what got into my dad, he never acts like that!”
”Yep, fine”, Harry nods. ”Great.”
It’s not signed. But it really doesn’t need to be.
— Drip —
Remus is watching them with misty eyes when they join him outside the marquee.
”You have to understand”, Karkaroff says breathlessly, his whole body trembling inside the confines of the chains. ”that He Who Must Not Be Named operated always in the greatest secrecy, he preferred that we — that’s to say his supporters — and I regret now that I ever counted myself among them —”
”You’re not singing this year?” Harry asks, looking curiously between his dads.
”No, it’s alright”, he mutters. ”I just feel really awkward talking about them like they’re my parents, I mean
he thinks, mildly surprised at his own attitude.
He slowly softens the kiss again, letting his fingers slacken around the other boy’s head and gently massages his skull through his hair instead.
Harry lets out another frustrated yell and spins around, ready to punch the nearest thing until his eyes land on Draco and he reels the impulse back in. Draco is glaring daggers at the portrait, his wand hand twitching at his side. Harry understands his urge to hex the painting, but it wouldn’t do any good — plus they’re running out of time!
”There are plenty of beds in here”, Pansy argues, but lets go of Draco’s hand and stands up.
Lungs screaming for air, Harry finally has to sit up again and he sucks in a deep breath desperately. His heart is pounding.
, as Remus had called him — is one of few wizards Harry’s own age that he’s ever met, it’s hard not to think about him.
Harry sticks close to the group all day, perfectly happy to keep a low profile if it means he’s got someone to sit with. By the time lunch rolls around, Seamus is actually talking to him. Harry isn’t sure if forgiveness is really at the root of that development or if the Irish boy is just happy to discover that he’s heard of muggle football, but he’ll take what he can get.
”We’ll take two for seven a piece”, Draco drawls, making a show of looking elsewhere as if bored and ready to walk on.
”W-w-what—?” Draco hisses.
”And… And dad…?” Harry asks quietly.
Harry doesn’t bother asking who she means, just nods sadly.
Remus gets up and starts collecting everyone’s empty plates. He leans down and gives Harry a kiss on the temple before walking over to the sink.
”Oh, much better!” Harry exclaims happily. ”We actually slept together last night—!”
”No…” Remus says slowly and serves Harry an even bigger slice. ”We had a discussion, that’s all… And then he went out for some air to clear his head, so he’d realise he was wrong and I was right.”
… We must force it to assume an amusing shape. Something that makes us
”Are you serious?” Harry says. ”My daddy?”
it is…” Harry murmurs happily, leaning in for a kiss.
Harry beams as his daddy gives Draco a gentle pat on the shoulder and then pushes past him to shake the hands of all of Harry’s other friends casually, as if it’s not a big deal at all that he just hugged Draco for the first time. Draco is standing rigidly, still clearly in shock, when Harry brushes their fingers together and then he shakes out of it slightly and meets his gaze.
”Well, have you had a look at the career advice pamphlets?” Professor Snape asks in a long-suffering voice. ”There are plenty of professions that allow you to
Draco suddenly slams the
”The Imperius… I was under my father’s control and hidden under an Invisibility Cloak, day and night… Winky was my carer and my keeper… she pitied me and persuaded my father to give me treats sometimes for good behaviour, like going to the World Cup…”
”No, she is still alive… But only just…”
”Hi Ron”, he says.

Draco removes the diary from his pocket and hobbling over to McGonagall’s desk he puts it down. Everyone in the room follows his movements in stunned silence, then stare in shock at the old book with the huge fang sticking out of it and still oozing ink.
Remus seems to think about the answer for a while, but finally says he hasn’t decided yet. Harry nods in understanding. He’s prepared to side with Sirius on this one, but he also understands why Remus is considering it. It’s war. Sometimes you have to put your own wants and needs aside and do the right thing.
”Yeah”, Goyle grunts, his beady eyes flitting over to Draco and Umbridge immediately turns to him instead.
The blonde trails off and frowns at the book.
”First Potions lesson of the year”, Pansy says. ”Slughorn had brewed a whole cauldron of it. It was just sat there for the whole lesson — anyone could have taken some!”
And I’ll be happy to tell you… But first, you’re going to answer some of
”At least it’s getting better”, Sirius will say. ”It’s not every night anymore…”
he thinks.
to—?”
”But you said it takes years”, Harry protests. ”I’ll be in my twenties by the time I’ve finished if I don’t start now!”
The Atrium seems a lot eerier now compared to the last time Harry was here. The only sound that can be heard is the steady rush of water from the massive fountain and his and Draco’s heavy breathing.
”Surely you have time to stay for one cup of tea?” Harry insists. ”Daddy made a really delicious chocolate cake the other day—”
”Okay”, Harry agrees quickly. ”I’ll… I’ll tell them…”
— we are not doing it! And before you say anything else, it’s not just our own expulsion we’d be risking, because listen to this…
”First meeting tonight”, Blaise informs Seamus and Harry. ”I wouldn’t mind going. Some duelling lessons might come in handy one of these days…”
have to
Remus smirks, ”You can list your skills. Don’t be silly.”
The blonde rolls his eyes, but there is a fond twitch in his lips.
past,
Harry smirks to himself.
He looks over at Harry seriosuly.
”Boys keep back!” Professor Grubbly-Plank says firmly. ”Unicorn prefer a woman’s touch, so girls to the front and no sudden movements, please…”
Why did he start to think of Malfoy as gay anyway?
”It’s nothing”, Harry says quickly. ”Look, I need to be going — erm — I need to get to the owlery before Transfiguration, but eh… Yeah… I’ll — eh — see you around, I guess…”
But just in case, he writes a short letter to his dads explaining the situation and what Umbridge said when he showed her
”Oh you know”, Ron says darkly. ”Any sexual activity counts. I have a fluid approach to the concept…”
”W-Wait… I…”
”I didn’t mean it like that”, Draco says and there’s an oddly soothing quality to his voice. ”But I’ve never done this before, so I want you to talk me through it—”
They trudge over the soggy lawn towards Hagrid’s hut where the Gryffindors have already assembled. They all turn their heads and stare at Harry and Draco after Hagrid waves a massive hand in greeting and Harry’s eyes lock with Ron’s briefly before the redhead turns away again. Harry flashes back to their last interaction and feels a twinge of guilt, remembering Ron’s beet read face and the hurt look in his eyes when Mr Malfoy, sitting snugly at Harry’s side, insulted Ron’s entire family in one off-handed comment. And Harry had just sat there.
It comes as no surprise that Professor Snape is good at chess, but when he’s got Harry in check mate after only three moves, when Harry is still working out his strategy, it starts to dawn on Harry that he might very well be the best chess player he’s ever met, better than both Ron and Draco combined… They keep playing though, and after the first two games, the professor starts giving Harry pointers and they actually end up having a good time together. So much so that, when the hour has passed and it’s time to go to the feast, Harry feels like they’ve only just got started and he’s actually reluctant to stop playing.
Harry keeps his hands clenched into fists on top of the table and continues to stare at her, even when the scratching of quills against parchment erupts all around him as his classmates finally comply. He can hear Blaise whisper something to Draco about using spells, but doesn’t tear his eyes away from Umbridge.
He trails off, looking slightly terrified at the idea and Harry feels a stab of pity for some reason. How someone as scared-looking as Quirrel could have become a Master of Defence Against The Dark Arts, he can’t understand. Glancing at his daddy again, he detects a similar look of pity on the man’s face and hides a smile when he offers Quirrel a rather gentle smile and bids him a good afternoon.
”But there’s no market for a story like that”, Skeeter says impatiently.
Sirius, who clearly hadn’t thought of it from that angle, is suddenly looking less convinced of the whole plan and blinks at his husband. But he says nothing.
”It’s not a lie!” Harry barks. ”I saw him, I fought him!”
”Into a particular memory of one Bob Ogden”, Dumbledore says, struggling for a moment to unstopper the small phial of silvery substance that Harry now knows to be memories, with his blackened hand, until giving up the attempts and using his wand to pull the cork out instead. ”Bob Ogden was an Auror — he died some time ago, but not before I managed to track him down and could persuade him to confide these recollections to me…”
”It is tradition”, Snape says in a clipped tone.
, he concedes, throwing his boyfriend a sidelong look. If it distracts Draco from everything horrible that’s been happening lately,
Slipping and stumbling, they follow Hagrid down a steep, narrow path. Nobody talks. Neville, the boy who has lost his toad, can be heard sniffling once or twice.
sorry!”
”Yeah, our boy’s got big”, Sirius agrees and hands Harry his glasses. ”Go on, runty, open your presents!”
”It’s complicated”, Harry says wryly.
”Clumsy”, Harry says indignantly. ”
”Any idea what it could be?”
Draco sucks in a shuddering half-breath, fisting the front of Harry’s robes as his whole body begins to spasm as if he’s having a seizure.
”Wow, you get your moneys worth with those two, don’t you…” Blaise comments lightly.
”Not here…” Harry mumbles self-consciously, glancing over at Goyle in the next bed as the large boy lets out another snore and rolls over. ”Common room…”
Harry blinks startled. For a second, he’d forgotten all about Ron in the other bed. He can feel the redhead’s eyes on him now and hurriedly binks the wetness out of his eyes and clears his throat awkwardly.
”Ehm, Granger…” Harry mutters.
Harry just blinks. His mind is reeling. Is it possible that he and Draco have been having two completely different fights for the past week? Could it really be possible that Draco isn’t scared of him at all?
”What?” Harry gasps. ”Really? I can come to the meeting with you?”
”Nothing?” Snape repeats softly, his dark eyes narrowing.
”Er… yeah?”
Squinting his eyes open, Harry’s discovers the room to be flooded with pale light from the large windows and realises it must already be morning. He peers up at the blonde, blurry blob hovering above him and shaking his shoulder mercilessly.
By the time they’ve all tired themselves out and Remus has called them all inside for lunch and cake, the atmosphere is significantly lighter even though Draco is possessively crowding Harry’s personal space the whole time he attempts to talk to Granger and get to know her better. Harry doesn’t mind that much, but it does make him feel a bit abashed when trying to give the gryffindor girl his undivided attention, and some strands of blonde hair suddenly tickles the side of his face…
The blonde continues to pace in front of the them and there is a loaded pause as everyone in the group seem to simultaneously swallow their sighs, while exchanging subtle looks with each other.
”It will last longer”, the blonde adds with a smirk.
”Well”, Harry chokes out a little hoarsely, discretely clearing his throat and giving their surroundings a furtive glance to make sure no-one’s listening in. ”We’re not friends.”
”Yeah, when he’s not having a narcoleptic fit and falls asleep on his broom”, Blaise cuts in drily.
”Are you deaf, as well as blind and stupid? I said
They make their way out of the dungeons and up to the second floor.
”And you didn’t turn out so badly, either…” Remus cuts in with a small smile.
Finally they reach a statue of a rather bewildered looking wizard who appeared to have been depicted with his gloves on the wrong hands. Draco walk up to a door on the statue’s left and whispers something, then turns the doorknob and opens the door.
He holds his hands up in a placating manner. ”Okay. Okay. Let’s… Let’s talk now…”
size, you see? He was the last court dwarf in Europe. And he was nice to me, because he knew what it’s like to be different to the average man. Even if he didn’t know what it was like to be large.”
”Perfect”, Dumbledore says gently. ”I shall see you then… Remus, it was nice to see you again. I’ll see myself out —”
”Lucky me”, the girl says drily, looking away.
again, but only gets smile and a pat on his cheek in return.
”Have a seat, won’t you, Harry?” he says and waves his hand.
, Harry thinks.
”What is it with you and the Gryffindors”, Blaise says.
Ron had his Head of House visiting him, and his friends and family too, Harry thinks bitterly.
Harry curls up in his bed and turns his back to the room — and Draco — and pretends to fall asleep, but even after the last stragglers, probably Crabbe and Goyle, have started snoring in their beds, he still lies awake, trying not to cry.
” Seamus echoes incredulously across the table.
”T-Tom?
When they get back from the Easter holiday, Flint has revised the Quidditch practise schedule for the third time this year. Harry quickly scans it and groans.
He clearly isn’t. Even Harry can tell that, but he’s a boy himself and he knows what it means when you tell your friends you’re fine even when you’re not. It means you want to be left alone. So he’s going to leave Malfoy well alone, and when he gets over whatever is bothering him and wants to talk, or kiss, or whatever, Harry thinks, I’ll be nice to him and everything will be fine.
He slides the door shut with a definitive
So for the next few days, this becomes Harry’s new routine. He retires early in the evening and spends most of the night tossing and turning in bed, dreaming of being chased by images of himself and startling awake every so often with a gradually growing sense of dread in the pit of his stomach. There’s also a niggling thought that lingers at the back of his mind, but he stubbornly waves it away every time and goes back to sleep.
”Er — my right, Sir”, Harry mumbles.
… honestly, I barely know her at all…”
They’re all idly getting ready for bed when Seamus tells them that his mum almost wouldn’t let him come back to Hogwarts this year, because of everything the
Harry leans his head back over the backrest of the sofa and sighs heavily.
”I… I did it…?” He breathes out, hardly daring to believe it.
Harry and Ron turn to stare at each other in shock, then turn back to look at the girl.

He doesn’t get a chance to follow the plan to catch up with his real friends until after lunch, when he spots Ron and Hermione in the courtyard with Neville and the Weasley twins. Feeling a surge of excitement, Harry quickly rounds a group of First Years playing Gobstones and makes his way over.
, he reminds himself.
”Yes!” Flint says.
, as Slughorn likes to call it.
”My birthday isn’t for another week”, Harry reminds them.
Harry thinks numbly and steps into his boots before hurrying out of the dorm.
”I’m sorry!” Harry blurts, heart beating a steady tattoo in his chest. ”I didn’t mean—”
He grabs Draco by the arms and pulls him up with him, then grabbing his Nimbus 2000 from where it had clattered to the floor in one hand and interlacing the fingers of his other hand with Draco’s he starts running and doesn’t stop until they’ve reached the hidden door of the Slytherin Common Room.
. The grey hairs, the lines around his eyes and mouth, the tension in his shoulders…
”You’ll be fine, it’s in your blood—!”
”Can’t we talk while we’re eating—?” Sirius asks mildly, but Harry immediately shakes his head.
” Harry cries. ”Don’t you get it? Voldemort’s got my dad! He’s torturing him
like her…” Riddle’s eyes glint and he raises an eyebrow. ”Well, she wasn’t wrong, was she…” he drawls and his gaze flickers back to where Draco is hiding for a split second.
”So is that a monthly publication,
Harry follows him to get the ingredients for his and Draco’s potion, smirking slightly as he overhear his Irish friend mutter to himself about
Draco shifts his weight a little, putting his hands on his hips and glaring at a loveseat next to him.
”Yes”, the Potions Master says shortly.
”We’ll make an appearance, stir things up, and then come back here”, Draco rattles off quickly, clearly a familiar drill from offering terms countless of times before.
”Come on, no dallying…” Remus says, leading the way with sure strides and Harry feels Draco pinch the robes’ fabric at his back and shuffle closer, so as not to lose him in the small crowd.
”Thank you, Sir…” Draco murmurs.
”They’re addressed to me though, aren’t they?” Harry insists.
”Sirius, please”, Remus says, giving his husband a frustrated look.
”But we didn’t even
”What…” Harry mutters.
!” Snape snaps. ”Everybody in the Common Room
” Blaise hisses, glancing over his shoulder.
”The room with the clocks?” Granger starts drawing some kind of diagram on the bottom of the parchment. ”We were in that room too and nothing happened, so you must have done something differently — can you think of what?”
”I used to be there”, he says, as if sensing Harry’s confusion. ”My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home… Kreacher’s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath, so I knew about it for ages, but I hadn’t actually seen it… until now…”
Both portraits, who one moment appeared to be in the deepest of sleeps, immediately snaps their eyes open and stare back at Dumbledore.
”They wouldn’t have had to brew it…” Blaise murmurs heavily, giving Harry a grim look.
before Arthur Weasley distracted him.
When Remus, seemingly alone, walks into The Leaky Cauldron, a witch approaches him and attempts to strike up a conversation, but he rudely shoots her down and continues walking towards the corner fireplace. Once hidden away from sight, he relaxes a bit and pulls the Cloak off of Harry and Draco and throws them both an apologetic look.
”Right then, everyone listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you have now successfully Vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell, I think. So today, we shall be —”
”I do”, Draco says stubbornly, snatching the last word.
”Yes, Sir…” they mumble in unison.
”He’s training you to take down Voldemort!” Draco exclaims in exasperation.
The Gryffindors approach the wooden crates cautiously, peering inside.
”N-no, my Lord…” Lucius whispers so softly that Harry can barely hear him anymore.
he enjoys a very long lie-in. In fact he stays curled up under the covers, half-asleep well into the afternoon, until Remus knocks on the door to his room and demands he get up, if he wants any lunch before he has to make his way over to the Station. Stomach growling at the mention of food, Harry stretches lazily and with a yawnn he kicks the cover off and drags himself out of bed.
Draco untangles himself from Harry and leans away for a second, but reappears at his side almost immediately, pressing the glass phial into Harry’s hand.
”Come now, Harry… I know you weren’t really supposed to, but you’ve got away with it, haven’t you? You don’t need to worry about getting into trouble, so tell me the truth…”
”Yeah!” Harry says. ”So why don’t you just do that here?”
Harry tosses the quill down on the table and feels a thrill when a drop of ink — no, blood — falls from the tip and soaks into the lacy table cloth.
”He’ll be fine. He’s strong. Remember he’s already done more stuff than most wizards do in a lifetime —”
Suddenly a large shape emerges from the gloom in front of Harry and his heart lurches, as he thinks he might have encountered the giant squid after all… But it’s not the giant squid. It’s not even a living thing. It’s several stones stacked together to make some sort of buildings and with a jolt, Harry realises he’s reached the merpeople finally.
”What, Voldemort put a
Finally the two Slytherin Prefects — Cyril Lympsham and Scarlet Cowe — both stop abruptly next to a stretch of stone wall, empty save for a couple of torches on either side of the spot Lympsham is looking at intently. Harry cranes his neck, trying to get a better look and see what the older boy is staring at, but as far as he can see, there is nothing there.
”Well—”
”Hm…” Snape says noncommittally.
”Got it!” Harry yells in triumph.
He hurtles along another corridor that is unusually dark — all the torches having been extinguised somehow — but it doesn’t matter, Harry has made his way from the Entrance Hall to the Transfiguration classroom countless of times, he could find his way blindfolded —
of performing such a rudimentary charm…” he says coldly, with a withering look at Longbottom. ”Leave your cauldron where it is and
”There’s a book signing”, he replies and points to a gigantic banner stretching across the shop window and doorway.
”Pansy, you are the queen of gossip”, Harry counters and tries not to sound like she’s just completely let him down. ”You’re meant to be on top of these things—”
Harry nods eagerly, reaching for the butter.
Harry staggers back.
”I see…” Dumbledore murmurs, gazing down at his own stapled fingers. ”Harry, m’boy, please tell me all about it…”
”Dreadful thing, Dumbledore”, Lucius says and retrieves a roll of parchment from his sleeve and holds it out. ”But the governors feel it’s time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension. You’ll find all twelve signatures on it…”
Harry thinks in dismay, even as that nasty voice in the back of his head whispers,
He follows her glare to the corner of the chamber where Granger is practising wand movements erratically and shakes his head in amusement when she accidentally pokes Ron in the eye.
He’s looking into a liquid mirror.
They can hear Filch getting nearer and nearer. Frightened, they finally break into a run and pelt through the doorway at the end of the gallery and down one corridor then another, before ripping a tapestry aside and hurtling along a hidden passageway behind it until they burst out into the Charms corridor.
Draco doesn’t show quite as much as eagerness over the prospect of being fed, but he too reaches for a dish almost immediately and Harry is — perhaps disproportionately so — happy to see him fill his plate with a lot more food than he normally would. He takes his sweet time, as always, but he does finish everything on his plate and Harry barely refrains from offering him some kind of encouragement, but thinks better of it at the last minute and bites his tongue.
Harry can’t deny that that would have been brilliant, but he still can’t shake his unease at having witnessed the way Umbridge treated Hagrid, especially knowing his dads’ reactions would have been quite the opposite to his friends’, if anything, it would have been similar to Granger’s…
”A word with you please…” Umbridge titters.
”Potter!” the Slytherin barks, but Harry ignores him and focuses his attention back to the fluttering owl in front of him. ”What’s your problem? Potter!”
”And then Harry made that comment about — Yep, I remember”, the other girl nods, squinting seriously at the ceiling.
”You don’t have to call me Sir”, Sirius says with a careless flick of his hand. ”Call me Sirius.”
Draco’s eyes seem to glitter in the gloom, ”Practise?”
, romantic novels, to be exact. Harry’s face grows hot when he discovers the first one, and hotter still as he picks it up for a closer look and spots the second one underneath.
”Harry, give them to me…” Remus says calmly and holds out his hand.
by either Pansy or Seamus… Draco gives him a worried look from his spot in the sofa, but Harry just shakes his head.
Mrs Norris!” Harry exclaims, his voice finally breaking out of the confines of his own closed throat.
”Draco, are you okay?” He asks instead.
”I’m really sorry you had to hear that — I mean — what Mr Malfoy said to your dad, it was out of order.”
”What time is it now?” Harry sighs.
”No, Draco…” Harry mumbles, pulling away from the other boy’s embrace. ”Just go to your own bed. There’s no reason for both of us losing sleep…”
”Did he get yeh?” he growls.
”I know you were really close friends and everything, but can you please call him James? It just feels really weird when you call him my father…”
”What?” Harry says, around his last mouthful and Draco scrunches up his nose and shakes his head. ”You’re the one who wanted to check out the Goblet of Fire!”
”Sherbet lemon”, McGonagall says and the gargoyle immediately springs to life, hopping to the side and revealing a doorway behind it through which a spiral staircase can be seen.
He watches as his friends all exchange concerned looks. He wants to reassure them, but he doesn’t have any answers.
”Of course, I’m not stu—”
He feels a tug of familiarty watching the banter between the two Gryffindors. It reminds him of Pansy and Draco somehow. He feels another tug, this time of longing.
”Come on, let’s go celebrate with the others…” he says, as he leans away from Harry again.
Harry stays rooted to the spot, counting slowly in his head while he waits for the other students to leave the classroom. His friends send him sympathetic looks over the shoulders, then disappear out of the door as well, leaving him all alone with the Toad.
”Your
Finally, when it’s been at least an hour since Professor Snape came to collect him and there still is no sight of him, Harry can’t stand it anymore. He quickly makes up an excuse to Slughorn and Gwenog Jones, then gets up to leave. He’s vaguely aware of Blaise murmuring something behind him and then another set of footsteps following him out into the corridor.
”Dad said I could come?” he asks. ”He
”Listen”, he says hurriedly, cutting off Adrian’s heated response. ”I can’t see anything with you two flying so close to me, the only way I’ll catch the snitch this way is if flies up my sleeve! Go back to the rest of the team, and let me worry about the bludger —!”
”Heya Fred, George, Lee…” he says brightly.
”You’ll see…” Draco says, smirking playfully.
”Well, actually, yeah”, Harry says wryly.
”Well, Mr Potter…” McGonagall says. ”Do you want to tell us what happened tonight?”
”Come here, then…” Sirius says gruffly, holding his arm out in invitation.
I’m missing something, Harry thinks and opens his mouth to speak again, but whatever he might have meant to say gets snatched from him when the other boy leans in and presses their lips firmly together. Harry’s stomach flutters and he eagerly presses back.
”I already told you that I don’t want any!” Harry snaps, then immediately feels guilty and sighs again. ”Sorry…”
Heart jolting in his chest, Harry steps through into the circular room with all the doors and blue-flamed candles and crossing it with determination, he opens the door directly opposite him. It, too, swings open easily at his touch and he eagerly steps through.
want is to witness a
Everyone turns to stare at the large lake where the smooth, black surface suddenly begins move as though boiling; large bubbles rise to the surface and great big waves lap at the shore as a massive whirlpool is formed in the middle of the lake… What appears to be a black pole emerges from the eye of the whirlpool and continues to rise steadily, but then Harry sees the rigging and realises it’s a ship’s mast and sure enough… Within moments, a whole ship has risen out of the heart of the lake and lies bobbing for a few seconds in the still turbulent water, before it starts to move towards the shore.
”How do they keep finding our address?” Sirius growls as he sits back down heavily.
He startles awake and sits up in his sweat-damp bed. For a moment he imagines he can still smell and taste blood, but gradually the scent of coconut overpowers the coppery tang.
”I’m surprised it’s not bigger news, I mean look at her”, Pansy continues in a low, excited murmur. ”She’s ugly. Surely people must suspect something!”
”I…” Draco croaks. ”Uhm…”
Harry shrugs to himself and takes another large gulp of coffee.
”I didn’t do anything”, Harry mumbles again, well aware of sounding like a petulant First Year.
”Don’t be silly”, Draco whispers, mopping up the cold sweat on his arms by rubbing soothing circles over them. ”Come on… It’s okay… I’ll get you a new pair of pyjamas.”
But ever since Toad Face started teaching it, Harry would do
”Good to know…” she murmurs.
”Thank you for telling me all this, Harry”, he says gently. ”And never hesitate to come see me again, it really is no bother…”
”Oh-oh… naughty, naughty…” a high-pitched girly voice giggles behind them.
”Drink. It.”
The rest of the team sniggers good-naturedly at Harry, who glares back half-heartedly. Draco keeps his hand on his arm, cupping his elbow loosely until he’s standing firmly on both feet and even then he gives his arm a gentle squeeze before letting go. Harry shoots him a grateful look.
While Professor Flitwick levitates Finch-Fletchly’s lifeless body and starts guiding it towards the Hospital Wing, McGonagall instructs all the students back to their classes and then conjures up a large fan that she hands to Ernie Macmillan with the instruction to waft Nearly-Headless Nick up the stairs. When they’ve finally disappeared from view, Harry slowly starts inching away from the wall again. McGonagall turns to stare at him, her face sterner than he’s ever seen it (with the possible exception for when she walked in on Harry, Draco and Granger in the bathroom with the mountain troll in first year…)
His skin is itching and his wand fingers are twitching. He needs space.
Draco huffs in amusement, but doesn’t say anything else. Harry wonders if maybe he’d nodded, but it’s impossible for Harry to make anything out in the darkness of the room, especielly since he’s not even wearing his glasses.
”Well, yes… You have a point… But”, the older man says, regaining some of his positive composure once more. ”If anyone can change that, it’s The Boy Who Lived!”
They spring apart and whirl around. Harry squints his eyes out into the room, but can’t see anyone standing there. Draco swears silently next to him.
With a carefree chuckle, Ron keeps spinning him round and round and, somewhere around the third or fourth spin, just before he starts to get dizzy, Harry cracks up and also relaxes for the first time since they stood up from the table. When the other boy finally stops spinning him, Harry crashes into his chest, laughing hard as his vision clears again. The taller boy is grinning down at him and Harry finds himself returning it stupidly.
”It all boils down to lineage, you know, furthering the family bloodline”, Sirius explains in a much too soft voice, which makes the whole thing worse, more real. ”It’s a very pureblood-typical,
”Why does he always have to…” Draco trails off with a frustrated sigh, but a sheen of hurt is clearly visible in his eyes and Harry’s chest twinges at the sight.
”I know. But I think he has every reason to this time.”
When Harry rejoins his friends in the travel section, Narcissa is still nowhere to be seen but her husband has appeared next to Draco and seems to be having a rather tense conversation with Mr Weasley.
”I’m just saying… Our boy has grown up to be a very talented wizard, I think he could have given James a run for his money!”
”Nothing”, Harry says quickly. ”Just… no, nothing…”
Harry doesn’t mind it all. In fact, it makes it so much easier for
”What is going on?” McGonagall demands, returning to the landing and scowling at the both of them. ”Potter?”
”Should I get Snape?” Draco asks uncertainly, squatting down next to him and gently rubbing his back. ”Harry? Do you want me to get Sna—?”
”Come on, get up…” Moody growls quietly.
Draco suddenly gores rigid, halfway under the desk. Harry’s heart lurches and lodges in his throat and he scrambles to grab a hold of him, but before he can a black-gloved hand suddenly appears and starts groping at him and manages to grab a hold of his ankle… In the next second, they both disappear with a
”Morning…” Harry murmurs thickly and smiles.
”Oh, I dunno”, Harry says loudly. ”Maybe
”I have been lead to believe that you are very close with Mister Malfoy, of course, but you are also quite friendly with Mister Zabini and Mister Finnegan, aren’t you?”
Narcissa’s mouth twitches and she inclines her head politely, then leads the way inside the small restaurant.
”Nevermind”, Draco mumbles and looks down sheepishly. ”You’re right…”
”What? — Was that another one of your brothers’ pranks—?”
Draco glances back and smiles, then brushes his hand again. Harry immediately lets his arm still along his side and angles his hand a little outward. Draco slips his fingers through Harry’s and slides his palm into place against his and Harry releases a breath he wasn’t even aware of holding and gently squeezes the other boy’s hand.
Harry considers telling him he has, but then decides he’s done enough lying for one summer and shakes his head with a pinched smile instead. Remus doesn’t look the least bit surprised and mirrors the smile sympathetically.
”Well, she wasn’t”, Daphne admits. ”Hestia was. But Hestia had a big Potions essay to finish, so Flora took her place. Don’t tell anyone I told you. Anyway… This Christmas party is apparently going to be
Harry thinks, aware of the darkness encrouching on him more than before the deeper into the maze he gets.
”Empty threats, Karkaroff”, a growling voice says and everyone turns around to see Moody standing inside the door, leaning heavily on his staff. ”You’re not going to abandon your champion, and he has to compete. They all have to compete. Binding magical contract, remember? Convenient, eh?”
”And what was he doing? Who else was there?” Snape prompts.
, Harry skims through the text, skipping for now the parts about what the werewolf is like while transformed.
, Harry thinks and blushes.
”But I don’t want to compete!” Harry blurts out finally.
”Are you sure?”
The blonde frowns a little, looking concerned.
”How much?” Harry asks.
Harry leaves the Potions Master’s office and makes his way back to the Slytherin Common Room in a kind of daze.
”You don’t want to talk about it?” Remus says, giving him a kind look.
”Now, now, Moony”, Sirius says soothingly. ”We talked about this, remember? Let’s leave the DADA professor for Dumbledore to deal with, yeah?”
”Ehm…. Please?…” Harry adds uncertainly, his excitement quickly ebbing away at the looks on his dads faces.
” Sirius calls after him.
”Not really” Remus says, closing the book he’s been reading. ”Harry’s other dad is though…”
He can’t make out any words though, so he scrambles off the bed and walks back out into the kitchen.
He jumps to his feet and wheels around. Hands are on him in a second, pulling him roughly to the side and then he’s got his daddy’s arms around him once more. Twisting his head, he sees Professor Snape and Sirius advance on Moody, their wands raised and pointing at the man’s heart… for a brief moment, he think this is the first time he has ever seen his dad and Head of House standing this close together and glaring at someone else, as opposed to each other.
”You know I told you earlier that Pansy was having me on…?” Malfoy says quietly.
”Of course, we’ll get your pet”, Remus says and steers him over to the Robes Shop. ”Harry, would you mind terribly if I went and got some supplies while you’re being fitted?”
… But stealing a look at the boy’s lithe frame he decides a few more calories won’t exactly hurt him either…
Harry bristles.
he thinks frantically.
, wouldn’t you?”
”I… thought you should know”, Granger adds, smiling awkwardly and Harry nods his thanks.
”What was that about?” Harry says as they leave the chamber.
When they get there, Ludo Bagman and Fleur is already standing at the edge of the pitch. Except it doesn’t look anything like the pitch Harry is used to anymore. The usually smooth grass surface has now been divided into countless compartments by a series of low walls weaving together in an intricate design all across the pitch.
Harry is seized by an irrational fear of having an embarrassing love note recited to him by an angry dwarf in paper wings, and spins on his heel and starts to run away… Unfortunately, the dwarf is much more adapt at weaving his way through the crowd and manages to overtake Harry next to a long queue of giggling first-years.
and walks over to the boys dormitories. Draco is lying on top of his bed, reading a book and doesn’t look up when Harry walks in.
”G-Good, very good, who’s next?” Remus says.
”You-Know-Who was questioning Rookwood about something and Rookwood said that your dad had cast an Imperius on Bode to get him to do something—”
”Go on…” Remus sighs.
… looking around,
When the first couple of tears tumble over the edge of Draco’s lashes, Harry forces himself to look away. For a second, he allows himself to glare at Umbridge, and he allows himself to fill up with pure hatred for the woman as she smirks back at him. Even as he tears his eyes away again and fixes them on his parchment, he keeps the hatred alive inside, like a fire keeping him warm from within… he feels his heart beating in the wound on his hand and with every beat, every throb of pain, he thinks
, he thinks and clings even more desperately to Remus.
he thinks hopelessly as he watches yet another spurt of silvery sparks shoot out of his wand, only to immediately fade away again.
”Well, that is disappointing…” Snape says. ”I never thought I’d meet a third-year class incapable of recognising a werewolf if they saw one, Professor Lupin —”
”No, not really. I just have a thing for you…”
They all kick off the ground and soar into the air, zooming around the chamber and diving through the swarm of bewitched keys, grabbing at them blindly but the keys dart around so quickly it’s almost impossible to catch one.
but will any of them be
”I don’t hang out with them”, Draco says and squints his eyes at Harry. ”Are you feeling alright?”
”But that just goes to show you, that certificate means nothing”, Sirius adds.
Harry is aware of Krum in his peripheral as the older boy also draws his wand, but he doesn’t dare tear his eyes away from the figure that keeps approaching silently.
There it is: a twelve-feet tall mountain troll, its’ granite grey body lumpy and stinking, dragging a huge wooden club along the floor and shuffling closer and closer to them.
”This is a lie—”
”Please”, he scoffs. ”If anything, that anomaly of gryffindorkish behaviour is clearly Granger channelling some repressed Slytherin tendencies…”
kept it as a pet…
”Simply outrageous!” Draco says as soon as the class has been dismissed and they’re out of earshot.
Pansy’s glare of suspicion grows colder and she points an egg yolk dripping fork at Harry threatheningly.
Blaise’s and Pansy’s potions are still lilac, although significantly paler than Seamus’ purple brew. Daphne seems to have gone wrong long before the stirring, because her potions looks closer to a midnight blue and is spitting angrily at her. By the way the girl is glaring at her cauldron, it looks like she’s considering spitting back.
What’s Hagrid got planned for their NEWTS,
opinions about my strategies—”
”But I need my wand”, Harry says. ”I need my wand, I start school in a few days!”
He imagines hearing the Potions Master letting out a soft snort, before promptly turning away and descending the staircase at a brisk pace.
As the Headmaster sidles up to his bed, Harry feels his eyes well up again and shakes his head firmly. He promptly curls in on himself and turns away before the old man reaches him and burrows into the bed as if hoping it will swallow him up, especially when he can hear everyone begin to whisper again, like so many snakes hissing a chorus all around him, with Dumbledore’s gentle barritone breaking away from the others:
Harry’s heart jumps into his throat and he quickly shrinks back. Seized by an indescribable fear of having to face even a Boggart version of Voldemort and not be able to deal with it, in front of all his friends and in front of his daddy, he quickly decides to hide behind Crabbe and Goyle and accidentally stumbles into Draco in his haste to get behind them. Draco, it seems, has had the same idea as him. They glare uncomfortably at each other, but don’t say anything.
Professor Snape blinks, then scowls even deeper than before. But, even though Harry usually hates it when the Potions Master directs his scowl at him, since that usually means he’s in trouble and he’s disappointed his Head of House yet again, this too feels so familiar that Harry’s smile only grows a little wider at the sight of it.
Harry, feeling a surprisingly strong sense of loyalty and protectiveness towards Granger, stays close to her the whole time, making sure she’s okay and doesn’t trip over her feet.
”This can’t go on.”
Remus nods quickly, and gives him an encouraging smile but there’s definitely a red hue to his cheeks, ”Okay! That’s fine! Like I said, natural and… fine for now, really. I mean. If you should want to do… other things…
on those feelings, it is perfectly natural that you should… want to… ehm, act on them”, Remus flounders slightly, but quickly composes himself again, adding quickly, ”With Draco.”
He makes a beeline for the paddock next to the small house and darts inside, moving to stand where he knows Bagman won’t be able to see him. He then stands very still and listens for any approaching footsteps, but it would seem as though the man has finally taken the hint.
”Here, you can read it yourself”, Remus says and hands him a rumpled piece of parchment.
”What… What do we do now…?” Harry says, looking around, feeling suddenly lost.
”He went out for some air, but he said we could start without him…” Remus says casually, taking his seat at the table and serving Draco a large slice of treacle tart.
”I am!” Harry exclaims. ”I’m
—!” Snape thunders, but cuts himself off and takes a deep breath to compose himself.
It is quite possible that he’ll just pass out, he thinks and but also tells himself sternly that if he faints and misses the window for the switch, he’ll never forgive himself. He’s aware of a warm hand splayed on his shoulder. He focuses on the feeling of it, allows it to steady his racing pulse. With a deep breath, Harry pushes himself up to standing again.
”Of course you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?” she says offhandedly, but her gaze remains intense and pinned on his, catching his every blink and every muscle-twitch in his face. ”Do you think that it was the trauma of your past that made you keen to prove yourself in this Tournament? To live up to your name?”
Seamus comes bounding over to him, grinning manically from ear to ear. He clutches his shoulder and thrusts a glass in his face that smells suspisciously like firewhiskey when Harry gets a whiff of it, before recoiling.
”What’s wrong?” Draco pants, curling the hair at the back of Harry’s head round his fingers idly.
he thinks uncertainly.
Harry looks over at the other boy; He looks paler than Harry has ever seen him. His jaw bones jutting out as he grits his teeth and his pale grey eyes focused on Fawkes as well, but there’s a light in them… He looks thoughtful, excited even… Harry frowns; He would think his boyfriend would be a bit more upset by now…
He orders a tankard of butterbeer from Madam Rosmerta and smiles thinly when the older witch flirts with him shamelessly, much to the amusement of a rather tipsy wizard slouched over the bar.
”—I hear it in my nightmares—”
being
”What’s the deal with those two…” Harry mutters.
He unclenches his hands from the back of the chair and slowly walks around it, inching closer and closer to the cowering man in circles, like a vulture circling its’ meal.
At the far end of the room he can see his friends and Draco, his platinum blonde hair standing out like a beacon in the fog, guiding Harry forward. With each step, the air in front of Harry seems to grow thicker and thicker, and he has to put his whole weight into each push forward and still he only manages to push himself an inch or so forward. It gets harder and harder to suck it into his lungs as well, his heart hammering desperately at the lack of oxygen.
”You’re not getting expelled”, Remus mutters.
Harry flinches and ducks his head again, slumping even further in his seat. A tense and heavy silence settles over the office. Peering over at the Potions Master cautiously, Harry catches him rub his left arm through the sleeve of his robes while once again glaring at the pickled toad.
Harry thinks bitterly.
His dark eyes flickered up to meet Harry’s and, once again, Harry got the strange sense that the man really disliked him. But the moment was over just as quickly as it had started and Professor Snape continued down the list. He then continued to tell them about the subtle science and exact art of potion-making, and although his voice was barely above a whisper, every word was heard clearly since he, like Professor McGonagall, seemed to possess the gift of keeping a class silent and focused without any effort at all.
” Draco says, giving his chest a light shove, but the only thing Harry cares about is the pink blush in cheeks and grins in triumph. ”I
”Gentlemen!” Professor McGonagall’s shrill voice rings out in the tense silence of the classroom. ”What is the meaning of this — Mister Malfoy, kindly return to your seat,
His voice catches in his throat and he trails off with a shake of his head.
”Harry!
— Images of his dad and daddy flash through his mind and he chokes on a sob…
Draco’s wand clatters to the floor, but no-one pays any attention to it.
”You don’t have to overdo it”, Draco mutters.
Harry doesn’t say anything else, but he can still detect a hint of sadness in his dad’s eyes as he gazes at his family’s faces on the tapestry.
Clearly unable to find his voice, Draco just swallows a couple of times and shakes his head. His eyes shine silver in the gloom and just as Harry leans in to cover his mouth once more with his own, a small tear seeps into the line of lashes underneath.
if you stopped coming up with idiotic and reckless ideas that will get you
Harry frowns, momentarily distracted by the disconcerting sound of Crabbe cracking his knuckles.
”Ehm…”
Lupin gently and carefully plies the mug from Draco and starts reheating the chocolate with a heating spell, then lets his fingers linger on Draco’s as he hands it back.
doing here?” Harry splutters, frowning at a group of Hufflepuffs over Blaise’s shoulder, all crowding around none other than Cedric Diggory.
”Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it”, Ron mutters after the girl and the toadless boy has disappeared again. ”Stupid spell — George taught it to me, bet he knew it was a dud…”
”So you decided to go to the Department of Mysteries”, Remus says with an air of exasperation. ”Harry … How many times …”
”Sir, I-I don’t think Harry is well, he woke up from a nightmare and he seemed really confused a-a-and—”
Not caring whether Goyle and probably-Crabbe are still around to notice him, Harry starts running down the corridor until he reaches the large gargoyle at the far end.
”Meow…
Harry drops from the back of the owl and watches as it flutters over to an armchair standing on the other side of the room with its high back facing Harry. Looking down, he sees two dark shapes on the floor on either side of the chair, both of them stirring awake… One is a huge snake… and the other a plump little man with a balding head and watery, beady eyes…
He gestures vaguely behind him. Bagman looks over his shoulder in surprise.
Fawkes comes swooping down from the ceiling again and leads the way through the shadows. They find Ginny sitting on the floor, shaking uncontrollably.
”Harry”, Remus cuts in, pinning him with a serious look. ”Regardless of whether the detentions were deserved or not, why didn’t Professor Snape write and tell us this at the time? Two weeks of detentions is quite serious. Usually he’ll write to inform us if you’re more than ten minutes late for a lesson…”
”Time for
”, Snape snaps. ”I am your Head of House, concerned only with your immediate wellbeing, as in
Riddle’s answer comes even faster this time and his handwriting becomes sloppier, as if he’s writing in a hurry, just like Harry…
”Just the one night?” Harry says, trying not to let too much of his disappointment shine through, well aware that he can’t expect his dads to just leave everything and keep him company in Hogwarts Hospital Wing.
you how it feels to be back —”
”And here they are”, Dumbledore continues, his eyes twinkling behind his halfmoon spectacles. ”Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!”
”I can write my brother Charlie, he works with dragons in Romania. I’m sure he can help.”
The Gryffindors burst out laughing, some pointing at Draco’s face as it pales at the suggestion before quickly growing pink with anger and embarrassment.
”Stop it”, Harry snaps. ”You’re not fooling me!”
”I think it’s outrageous”, the blonde mutters savagely, stabbing a sprout. ”He’s unfit to chase down Dark Wizards, but he’s fit to teach in a school…”
”It’s fine”, Harry tells her. ”He wasn’t exactly much help anyway, fidgeting and throwing furtive looks at the door—”
Draco is waiting for him by the door and doesn’t say anything, just gives him a gentle smile when he finally joins him. Harry tries to return it, but his face feels numb and he just ends up twitching nervously.
”—and there are about a hundred of them outside — I’m not trying to be funny! I’m telling the truth!”
fast, if it wasn’t for his incessant
Suddenly, he feels Draco pinch the sleeve of his robes and pull him to the side. Frowning in confusion, Harry stumbles after him and stops next to him behind a large oak tree next to the rundown old pub The Hog’s Head.
”Well, that’s the weird part”, Blaise says. ”Nothing was taking. Apparently the vault that was broken into had been emptied earlier that same day!”
Remus pulls him into a hug again and hushes him gently. Harry hadn’t even realised his eyes had filled with tears.
”Well, let’s go then! I can only afford to take a ten minute break, then I have to come back here…”
Suddenly something heavy slams into his back and he tumbles through the fire and rolls out of the fireplace and onto the wooden floor of the lounge.
”I — I —”
But just because he can’t deny it, doesn’t mean he has to do anything about it, Harry figures.
”Righ’ then…” Hagrid says, clearly having lost his thread. ”So yeh’ve got yer books an’… an’ now yeh need the magical creatures. Yeah. So I’ll go an’ get ’em. Hang on…”
”Yeah…” Harry breathes, hardly believing it himself…
Harry thinks and sighs.
Sagging with relief, Pansy gets up and grabs the largest, silver teapot and hands it to the Professor.
As soon as the string comes off the owl’s leg, it takes off again and Harry absent-mindedly shoves the window shut with his shoulder while unrolling the message… His heart leaps at the sight of the familiar handwriting…
”No way!” Seamus exclaims. ”You’re goin’ ter be able to turn into a cat or something, like ol’ McGonagall?”
”Yeah, he’s really quite talented”, Remus says, smoothly steering the conversation back on track. ”Must be all those Potions lessons…”
Harry’s heart immediately stutters to a stop.
”Yeh always wait fer the Hippogriff ter make the firs’ move. It’s polite, see? Yeh walk towards ’im and then yeh bow… If he bows back, yeh can go ahead an’ touch ’im… If he doesn’ then yeh better back off sharpish ’cause those talons hurt… Now, who wants ter go first?”
Harry takes his usual seat in front of the desk and has to fight a very strong sense-memory induced impulse to hang his head, and reminds himself sternly that he is
Every so often, he’ll find his gaze drawn to the mop of blonde hair across the Common Room, wishing it was Draco sat here in front of him instead, impressed by his stories.
Harry nods, but there’s still a tightness in his chest.
I’ve no choice, Harry thinks.
not get back until late, in which case I promise to look in on you and say good night.”
because yes it
Draco gives him a secretive little smile and the merest hint of a wink, then slips away from his side and joins the small crowd instead. Harry feels the first stirrings of nervousness as he strides across the pitch and turns to face the other students, meeting their expectant eyes head on. He clears his throat and inclines his head in greeting.
Pansy and Daphne who are sitting opposite him both flinch and twist around to scowl at the girl standing behind them, but unsurprisingly Loony seems completely unaware of their intentions. In fact, she seems to take their acknowledgement of her presence as some kind of invitation, because in the next moment, she squeezes down between them on the bench.
, he thinks.
”Fine”, she says. ”I’ll go get changed into something a little more presentable—”
”Remus, the train is moving”, Sirius says.
Harry snorts.
”I don’t know!” Harry snaps angrily. ”Inside my head—!”
”Very good, Potter… Now hand it over to me…”
The kisses stop.
”Your son is quite the hero”, Dumbledore says pleasantly.
, he thinks hopefully.
”We’re not—”
Harry raises his eyebrows expectantly, the line of his mouth pressing together even further.
”… that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden for students when unaccompanied by a teacher. And on a similar note, Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four-hundred-and-sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr Filch’s office door… we have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons—”
like it?
”I doubt very much that your newfound ability to speak parseltongue is any cause for alarm, but as your Head of House I am entrusted with your safetly and well-being whilst at Hogwarts and as such I am also obligated to inform your legal guardians of any abnormal incident involving yourself that might occur throughout the school year… Also, I rather they hear it from either of us, as opposed to through the Hogwarts grape vine.”
Something pink catches his peripheral and he looks down to see the silk necktie clutched in the other boy’s pale fingers.
”I don’t want to talk about this anymore!” Harry snaps, heart pounding in anger inside his tight chest.
”I swear to Merlin, Finnigan”, Draco whispers furiously as soon as the professor has left the room and jabs his finger into the Irish boy’s chest. ”If you breathe a word about Harry and me outside this dorm, I will have you expel—”
silly.”
”Harry?” Remus says. ”Everything alright?”
”Draco!” Narcissa Malfoy calls from the doorway behind them. ”Time to go!”
Harry squints his eyes open in a glare and opens his mouth to snap at the other boy to go away and let him sleep, but before the words are out of his mouth it’s been covered by the other boy’s and he’s being thoroughly kissed. Harry lets out a muffled groan and immediately melts into it… And by the time Draco breaks the kiss and leans away again, he doesn’t even remember what he was supposed to be angry about.
”I’m sorry, dad”, he murmurs.
”Did I stutter?” the girl scoffs and shoots him an unimpressed look that makes him want to throttle her, but he takes a deep breath and counts backwards from ten like his dad has taught him.
Harry and Sirius are still engrossed in a silent argument over who’s turn it is to speak some sense into Remus, so they’re both pleasantly surprised when Draco pipes up, ”What about our morning classes, Remus?”
”I think it’s just for checking weight and height, as stuff like that”, Blaise says.
have to play them”, Pucey mutters.
”She’s an animagus! She can turn into a bug and she’s been sneaking into classrooms and stuff”, Draco tells him.
Draco pulls back again with a smirk, then quickly dips his head and captures Harry’s lips in a searing kiss.
You’re lying to me…”
”Nothing. That’s all I saw.”
”I-I’m s-sorry I woke you up…” he gasps.
”Never mind that”, Draco snaps. ”Has he expressly told you not to tell us or your dads about the things he shares with you?”
The boy in the reflection’s smirk widens into a happy smile, and then — Harry stares wide-eyed — the boy slowly puts his hand in his trouser pocket and pulls out a blood-red stone, shows it to Harry, then puts it back in his pocket again — and as he does, Harry feels an added weight suddenly appear in his own trouser pocket… Somehow, incredibly,
… he also recalls the other smells around him in that moment; the grass and soil of the Quidditch pitch, the hint of metallic in the damp evening air…
Harry watches Snape disappear into the shadows of the corridor and even after the man has been swallowed up by the darkness, he remains outside the common room, holding his breath and listening to the echoes of the man’s footsteps. He then takes a deep breath and whispers the password. The wall rearranges itself and allows him entrance.
That’s how far back we go, that’s how pure our blood is — do you know how much I’ve been offered for this here ring, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone, do you?”
”Now, I want to make it clear that you won’t be able to visit him every weekend, but —”
in Draco’s swirly handwriting, not Harry’s hippogriff scrawl.
”Shut up, and move over”, Draco tells Seamus, giving his leg a gentle kick and as soon as the Irish boy shifts towards the other end of the loveseat, he plops down and pulls Harry down to sit in his lap. ”How did it go? Did you get it?”
”How do you do, how do you do?” says Fudge, smiling at them both and then doing a double-take as his eyes find Harry. ”Merlin’s beard!”
”I felt really weird… like… like empty and sad and…” he trails off and just shakes his head.
, his mind supplies and he cautiously approaches it.
”, Harry recites, then gives the other boy a sharp look. ”You knew that!”
he thinks nervously and glances sideways at the other boy.
”Yeah, of course?”
”If you don’t mind, Harry”, the old man says. ”I have two more memories to show you, both obtained with enormous difficulty and the second of them is, I think, the most important one that I have ever collected. So…”
With their next lesson being Double Potions with the Gryffindors, literally as far away from the North Tower as possible unless you count the greenhouses or Hagrid’s hut, they don’t get even a minute’s break between lessons, but have to head straight to the dungeons and even so they have to walk quite briskly the whole way to make it on time.
Harry feels like the bottom plummets out of his stomach.
”I don’t know, maybe not. He doesn’t look very happy”, Harry mutters.
”Fine”, Seamus bristles. ”
”Yeah I’m not him”, he mumbles, biting his lip to prevent his smile from growing too wide.
” Severus says incredulously. ”You mean to tell me —?”
The owl sticks his leg out and allows Harry to untie the small roll of parchment.
”Muggles?” Sirius frowns. ”What muggles?”
”You know, if the pink-eye curse fails and you can’t summon your broom, plan C could be to just chuck Draco at it…” Blaise says lightly.
AND YOU WILL FIX THIS,
”How?” Ron and Harry say in unison and the girl blinks and focuses her eyes on them again.
”But when she got petrified by the basilisk in Second Year, the first thing he did was write home and tell his mother that he was top of all his classes”, Harry adds matter-of-factly, before taking a drink.
”No, cub…” Remus says softly. ”He only served one year of his sentence in the end… after that he… well, he died…”
”Harry, you coming?” Seamus shouts over the storm.
”Yeah, but I just sent him one like an hour ago…” Harry mumbles, his heart hammering in his chest as he keeps staring at the words scrawled on the parchment in Draco’s familiar, swirly handwriting…
Lupin nods, ”I’ll see you on Friday — we meant it, by the way. You
Výbuch hysterického smíchu od podivné nebelvírsko-zmijozelské dvojice naplnil celou Velkou síň a ještě mnoho dnů bylo předmětem dohadů, co ho vlastně způsobilo.
„Jdi k čertu. Kdo je ještě na tom seznamu?“
„Dobré vědět.“
Draco se usmál. To nebylo odmítnutí. A Harry bez pobídky pokračoval:
„Nebudu dole,“ zavrčel Potter a Draco se ďábelsky usmál. Tuhle větu už párkrát slyšel a vždy nakonec dosáhl svého. Když vzal Harryho penis do úst, protesty se přetavily ve sténání a prosby a Draco mu rád vyhověl.
* * * * *
„Co kdybych řekl, že jsi na mém sexznamu?“ opovážil se Draco a zadržel dech, aby slyšel jakoukoliv reakci, která by mohla přijít.
„Do prdele, tak tohle mě překvapilo,“ přiznal Draco. „Proč on?“
„Dobré ráno,“ pozdravil Harry, když se složil vedle Draca u snídaně. Zarazilo ho, když Malfoye viděl u stolu, obvykle totiž chodil později, až když tam Harry a jeho přátelé už byli, a navíc seděl u stolu Zmijozelů. Harry se rozhodoval jen okamžik, než k němu zamířil.
* * * * *
* * * * *
„Seamus je ucho a arogantní blbeček. Strašná kombinace. Dean má charisma. A víš, co se říká o černoších,“ zazubil se do tmy.
„Počkej.“ Přešel třikrát podél stěny a znovu vstoupil, s vyzývavým pohledem, kterým Draca zval dovnitř. Blonďák zaváhal, ale nakonec Harryho následoval. Uvnitř se teď rozprostírala nekonečná temnota a Draco nedokázal odhadnout, jestli má prostor na délku dvacet nebo dvě stě metrů. Přelila se přes něj úzkost, ale necouvl. Ve světle, které ještě doléhalo z chodby, viděl, jak Harry trhl hlavou nahoru. Následoval jeho pohled, a když se za nimi dveře konečně zavřely, viděl hvězdnou oblohu, která vyzařovala dostatek světla, aby dál dokázal vnímat Harryho postavu vedle sebe.
”Clearly”, he croaks and blinks his eyes open once more.
scheme, right?” Seamus whispers.
”Harry?”
”That’s neither here nor there”, Ogden snaps coldly.
”HE’S HERE! POTTER IS HERE!” one of them screeches.
” Granger repeats incredulously.
Harry spins around to look at him and Professor Snape.
”So who did you ask…?”
Granger nods eagerly, ”And the steam rising in characteristic spirals, Sir!”
”…’s fine”, the mumbled tail end of his reassurance to Sirius, quickly morphs into a tired greeting, ”Morning boys! Coffee is ready — can I make you some eggs?”
”I, in no way, blame you for Sirius’s death”, Remus tells him stiffly.
Draco gives him a tight smile and returns his attention to assembling all his toiletries into his silver toiletry bag.
”Stay still, Harry, there’s a good boy — I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the
“Sorry”, Harry mumbles and rubs his face.
”You get used to it…”
Harry thinks.
”I know…” Harry mutters.
”Yeah”, Harry croaks around the pulsating lump in his throat, feeling a rush of relief, panic and excitement overwhelm him at the thought. ”Later.”
” the blonde demands and wrenches his arm out of Harry’s grasp. ”Stop for a second—!”
”What? What are you talking about—?”
”No, no…” Remus assures him, then seems to hesitate for a second before he continues. ”No, it was a Dementor. Or two, apparently…”
”Maybe tomorrow”, Lupin interjects before Harry has a chance to respond. ”It’s getting late and, Draco, you’ve had a very long day. Time for bed. Harry”, he adds, giving him a meaningful look. ”Help me make up a spare bed for Draco in your room.”
”I was
getting older and… and I’m sure you’re having all sorts of…
”It’s good to see you, Professor”, he says and tries not to smile too widely, just in case the man thinks he’s poking fun at him. ”Did you have a good Christmas?”
”It was very nice having you over, Draco. I hope to see you again soon…”
”I sincerely hope you said that to get rid of her, Mr Potter. Because I will not now — nor ever — discuss such
— you
These robes, though, Harry observes, glancing down the man’s body. They’ve clearly been patched and transfigured countless of times, and they’re still coming apart.
During breakfast, Hedwig returns with a reply from his dads stating that he’s welcome home for lunch on Easter Sunday and if Umbridge has a problem with that, she is also more than welcome to join them so that they may discuss it with her.
”It doesn’t matter”, Harry says with more conviction than he actually feels. ”If you make the team, I’ll be happy for you and I’ll be your biggest fan!”
Ron moves, and immediately the White Queen pounces on him. She strikes him over the head with her large stone arm, knocking him off the horse and he crumples in a heap on the ground. The Queen grabs him and the horse and drags them off the chess board.
”Ow, what was that for?”
Snape’s eyes dart between Draco, Harry, Granger and the troll, but he says nothing, just walks over to the troll and bends over it. Meanwhile, McGonagall looks between Draco and Harry, her lips pressed thin with barely suppressed rage and her eyes flashing dangerously behind her spectacles.
Draco points to the tiniest of all the bottles and Harry feels his stomach sink. The bottle is not only tiny, it’s also almost completely empty.
permeates the confused atmosphere and the murmurs around the Hall rise in volume as well as excitement.
The room seems to be holding its breath, waiting for his reaction…
”I had a lovely time”, he murmurs softly and Harry’s stomach flutters.
”I have, Sir”, Karkaroff wheezes. ”I wish to be of use to the Ministry… I wish to help… I know that the Ministry is trying to… to round up the Dark Lord’s supporters and I am… eager to assist…”
The blonde’s eyes immediately swivel back to Harry, looking positively scandalised.
on Wilbert Slinkhard’s view on counter-jinxes?” she says, rather shrilly.
he tells himself sternly.
the smug grin on his face without his glasses on, he can picture it perfectly and barely refrains from sticking his tongue out in response.
Sighing heavily, Harry pads over to his bed and sinks down on the edge of it, reaching for the jar and gently pulls the stopper out.
”Draco”, Pansy says slowly, a hard undertone cutting into the vowels. ”If you don’t calm down, lower your voice and stop scaring the First Years, I will confiscate
— Because it’s Umbridge staring at him. He’s looked up and caught her several times, so he knows it’s her. And she seems unfazed and surprisingly unapologetic about it, as well. In fact, whenever he meets her gaze head on, she only narrows her eyes suspiciously. But she doesn’t look away.
Harry shoots Draco a look, silently asking him for help but the blonde just covers his smile with a hand and looks away.
”I got a hold of Narcissa”, Remus confirms and takes his seat at the table again. ”And according to her, Draco has been wasting away in his room all summer…”
”Well, he’s creepy!” Draco insists, but his lips twitch.
Mr Ollivander takes a swift step closer to Harry, who tenses up further.
”For what”, Harry persists. ”I don’t get it—!”
”I think I should come with you—”
Draco whimpers and steps closer to Harry, clutching his arm.
”What terrible things?” Harry frowns. ”Who’s plotting them, and how come
The noise immediately dies down and Ron swiftly hides the half-empty bottle behind his back, blushing furiously.
Snape slowly raises it to his head and with the tip touching the roots of his long, black hair and when he pulls  it away again, a silvery strand of some smoky substance comes away from his head as well.
”Great”, Harry mutters sarcastically and puts the cup down on the table, bending down awkwardly to blow on it.
Confused and dizzy, Harry staggers to his feet and looks around. He recognises the room immediately. It’s the Time Room. But the silently wailing Death Eater with a baby’s head is nowhere to be seen, nor is any of Harry’s friends or the Order, or the anyone from the Ministry.
They all slow down to a stop and turn around to see their portly potions professor come waddling up the stairs behind them.
Harry grins at him.
So much better in fact that he really doesn’t want to spoil it and ruin the festive spirit by invoking his dads’ wrath by finally telling them about his detentions with Umbridge, even though a small voice at the back of his mind (sounding suspiciously similar to one Professor Snape), keeps reminding him that the longer he puts off telling them, the worse he’ll feel when he finally does.
”If you say so…”
Remus refrains from retorting, but the frown stays etched on his face until Harry changes the subject and tells him the class can’t wait to have him back and that they’re less than impressed with Snape filling in for him.
With another sigh, Harry settles back into Draco’s arms.
Spitting toothpaste into the sink with a lot more force than strictly necessary, Harry glares at his own reflection.
”You want to dance?” Draco asks innocently behind him and Harry can practically hear the amused smile in his voice.
”W- Wi-
”, he mutters, shrinking the spider back to its original size before putting it back into the jar and scooping up the third. ”Right… anyone know any others?”
Dumbledore holds his wand out and steps around the massive tree trunk.
”Relax, Pans”, Harry mutters and sits up as well. ”We didn’t mean to fall asleep here, it just happened, get over it…”
”Diggory”, Harry scoffs. ”I heard he’s dumber than a broomstick… You heard what Dumbledore said. It’s going to take a lot more than physical strength to win —”
Draco simply glowers back, but also takes a small bite. He immediately washes down with several mouthfuls of coffee. Harry and Pansy exchange a worried look.
The half-giant’s face is entirely hidden behind a snow-caked balaclava, but it couldn’t possibly be anyone else…
HIGH INQUISITOR!
The only thing he’s ever really loved, is flying — but if he tells Professor Snape that he wants to be a professional Quidditch player, the man will most likely tell him he’s an idiot and that he needs to grow up.
”Do you think you might want to persue a career as an herbologist?”
Harry bolts. He’s only vaguely aware of charging into the bodies of two stunned Death Eaters who stagger aside as he pushes them away. He hurtles across the graveyard while everyone is still too shocked to react.
”No”, Granger says firmly. ”I think we’ve seen enough articles about Harry losing his marbles, don’t you?”
Harry forces out a strained chuckle.
Harry frowns and looks a little closer at his boyfriend. The blonde is practically trembling with the effort of remaining outwardly unbothered by the behaviour of the two larger boys who, Harry now remembers, are both sons of Death Eaters — possibly even fledgling Death Eaters themselves, who knows if Draco was the only sixteen-year-old to be offered the
Draco makes quick work of the drawstring in Harry’s pyjama bottoms and only shoves them down far enough to free his erection. Harry shivers pleasantly as the cool dungeon air hits his hot, sensitive skin and then nearly swallows his own tongue as he feels fingers wrap around his throbbing flesh so tightly it almost hurts. Almost.
Crabbe and Goyle joins them suddenly and Draco immediately snaps his mouth shut again. The five of them exchange tense looks and Seamus quickly changes the subject to quidditch, while Draco and Blaise continue with their chess game.
”The… Headmaster wants to see you, Draco. Now.”
— I think they’d be rather keen to read it.”
”Ehm, this one’s from Blaise… These are from Adrian Pucey and Terence Higgs —”
”Who cares”, Pansy speaks up from behind Harry. ”It’s not like any of us are in danger, anyway… I mean, we’re in his
”Can’t be nothing”, Harry argues half-heartedly, but part of him latches onto the reassurance and relief eagerly, convincing himself that it must be nothing, because if it wasn’t, then Draco would tell him.
Light spills into his head; time curves around his back, gets tangled up in his legs, arms, he can hear bir sogn; His Daddy is handing him a mug of hot chocolate; the universe bends around him, twists over his head; Sirius opening the
”Excuse me?”
”What?” Draco says again and turns to look at Harry.
”Insult to…” Harry shakes his head in wonder. ”Bloody purebloods…”
”What did you tell them?” Harry asks Draco.
Scrambling up to the headboard, he sits cowering and panting, every single one of his muscles pulled tight, ready to
Within moments of joining the festivities in the Slytherin Common Room, Harry’s world explodes into a whirlwind of colour and sensation. He figures either Draco or Pansy must have something to do with it, whether he’s been hit with a similar spell to the one still making Granger bounce around like an excited terrier, or if it’s simply something extra slipped into his drink.
He gives Draco space for the rest of the day, concentrating on his school work and talking to his friends. The other boys, especially Blaise, keep throwing worried looks in Draco’s direction whenever the boy brushes past them to select a seat some way away from them.
They walk in silence for a moment. Harry glances up at his daddy’s face, wondering if he can risk asking him about his Boggart, but the wistful, almost sad expression on his face makes Harry decide to leave that question for another time. Instead he tries to think of something that will cheer him up, and that’s when it strikes him —
as well? Didn’t I tell you at the start of term that I wanted to put in extra practise time this year and really bond as a team? Didn’t I tell you that I expected everyone to put Quidditch first, or they’d be off the team? Is that what you want? You’re both good fliers, but I will kick you off the team in a heartbeat if you don’t start taking the Quidditch Cup seriously and don’t think I won’t!”
He quickly flicks back to a page where there’s a sketch of him, in profile, sitting in a classroom and it’s dated
”Before we go… there’s something else I need to tell you…”
Ron dives, Draco rockets upwards and the key, flitting between them in fright, darts to the side — but Harry is ready for it — he snatches it and squeezes it tightly in his fist, the poor thing flailing frantically.
”Your… Your scar is hurting you…?” Remus asks carefully and Harry catches a flash of fear in his eyes that he quickly blinks away.
”That other group you were talking about, Nirvana, is their music similar to that?” Harry asks curiously.
Harry snaps.
The blonde simply shakes his head, his wild eyes darting between the leering faces of the merpeople all around them and Harry’s face.
of being branded with the dark mark this past summer?
”Well, there you have it… You’ll be able to face any Boggart now…” Remus says with a chuckle.
, Harry thinks, pausing at one in particular that really catches his eye.
„Hmm. Můžeme?“ Draco přikývl a pak neodolal, aby si Harryho nepřitáhl k poslednímu polibku, nejistotu ze všeho, co se stane, až projdou těmi dveřmi do skutečného světa, vepsanou ve tváři se nesnažil skrýt. Tma to udělala za něj.
„Nebuď takový suchar, Pottere. Jestli má skutečně tak působivou výdrž, možná ho znovu zahrnu do svýho sexznamu.“
„Hagrid.“
Tak se jedno deštivé říjnové úterý stalo, že si Draco Malfoy během snídaně mlčky přisedl k triu svých spolužáků z ročníku a Nebelvíři ho stejně mlčky přijali. Od toho rána u nich Draco sedával na všechna jídla a po týdnu s nimi trávil i dobu, kdy se přemisťovali na jednotlivé hodiny, učili se ve Velké síni nebo v knihovně.
* * * * *
Zůstali ležet v objetí až do večera, když s prázdnými žaludky naznali, že v Komnatě nemohou zůstat na věky, ačkoliv by jim ta myšlenka nebyla vůbec proti srsti.
Jenomže po obědě se situace opakovala, a když pak mířili na Kouzelné formule a Hermiona houkla:
„Ach,“ hlesl Harry a sledoval tu spoušť. V podstatě vešli do spáleniště. Kromě černočerného popela všude kolem se jen místy objevila nějaká hromádka ohořelého harampádí. Pryč byly stěny knih a starého nábytku, police, cetky, křesla, učebnice a sešity, zapomenuté brýle a ampulky s lektvary… Nic nezbylo a Harrymu se sevřel žaludek.
„Ty, Weasley,“ dloubl Draco během poslední večeře před vánočními prázdninami Rona do žeber tak silně, až zrzkovi zaskočilo.
* * * * *
„Draco Malfoy,“ zašeptal Harry. „To je poslední jméno na mém sexznamu.“
„Víš, jak to myslím,“ mlaskl Draco nesouhlasně a ve světle hůlky kontroloval, jestli má svou vlastní kravatu.
Harry si povzdechl, tohle se stávalo čím dál častěji, občas se ani nenamáhali s omluvou, prostě jen zapadli do nějaké prázdné učebny, zatímco na ně Harry po cestě mluvil, a než si všiml, že mluví do prázdna (Malfoy se nepočítal), byl pro smích několika skupinkám kolemjdoucích.
„To bych věděl,“ odmávl to Draco rukou jako naprostý nesmysl. Harry jen pokrčil rameny.
„Nahoru!“ vyštěkl Draco, když vypadli zpoza portrétu opět v pátém patře. Takhle zadýchaní si nemohli dovolit na své spolužáky narazit. Zastavili se až v chodbě v sedmém patře.
„To je jako seznam lidí, který…“ zasekl se Harry, jak hledal vhodný výraz.
* * * * *
Na rtech cítil Dracův horký dech, přerývaný, jak se zadýchal, když se Harrymu bránil. Oči měl otevřené dokořán, zorničky ve tmě rozšířené, takže světlá v jeho očích nebyla téměř patrná. Harry ho držel za zápěstí a cítil tak, jak Zmijozel zatíná ruce v pěst.
„Tak pojď taky,“ hodil Harry rukavici a velmi dobře viděl vnitřní boj mladého Zmijozela. Tady o tebe nikdo nestojí, zůstalo nevyřčeno, přesto sdělení viselo ve vzduchu. Když teď půjde, přizná porážku. Ale co získá výhrou?!
Ona dvojice byla rozhodnutá vzít si své tajemství do hrobu.
Zbylí dva Nebelvíři před učebnou Lektvarů ale nečekali a Harry znervózněl. Znovu se ohlédl do chodby a konečně je uslyšel. Když vyšli zpoza rohu, napadlo Harryho, že je zdržela mantichora. Jinak si ty rozcuchané vlasy a neupravené školní hábity vysvětlit nedokázal.
Harry Draca podezříval, že to místo vybral schválně. Byla tam tma a dělali to zezadu. Nebyl si tak úplně jistý, že to, co do něj pronikalo, byl Dracův penis.
Večer oba padali únavou, což bylo po sedmi číslech pochopitelné, zatímco Ron s Hermionou u jídla vtipkovali a bavili se na jejich účet. Harry neměl sílu na popichování reagovat, a když mu hlava upadla na Dracovo rameno, prostě ji tam nechal.
„Přípravám,“ zaskřehotal Harry.
„Seamus,“ pípl Harry a Draco se musel kousnout do tváře, aby se nerozesmál.
„Asi šli rovnou na hodinu. Můžeme?“ Draco přikývl a ulpěl na Harrym pohledem déle, než bylo obvyklé.
„No?“ zaskřehotal po chvíli.
„Děláš si prdel, že jo? Pottere, to je jako kdybys řekl, že chceš píchat rumovou kouli. Totální sračka.“
Povzdechl si… ale no vážně. Když to zvládne Ron, tak on taky. Rychle naházel věci do tašky a následoval svého milence do Komnaty nejvyšší potřeby. Než vyšlapali sedm pater schodů, z nichž dvě šli dvakrát, protože schodiště si s nimi zahrávalo, byla polovina jejich přestávky v trapu. To se prostě nedalo stihnout. Byli vyřízení, ještě než se vůbec dostali ke svlékání.
„Nejsem panic,“ ohradil se polohlasně se zavrčením.
„Pětkrát,“ stiskl mu Malfoy ruku.
„Dělám co?“
„Takže víš, co se říká o černoších,“ konstatoval Draco. „Nepřekvapuje mě, že je na tvém seznamu. Spíš mě překvapuje, že jsi to s ním nikdy nezkusil. Nebránil by se.“
* * * * *
„Cože? Děláš si srandu? Jsou to mí přátelé!“
„Víš, kdybys to zkusil vnímat, a pak mi řekl, o čem ta kapitola byla, ušetřil bys mi práci. Můžu ti to oplatit kapitolou z Bylinkářství.“ Bez reakce. Harry si povzdechl. Sám jako kůl v plotě. V plotě bez výpletu. Jako úplně, naprosto sám…
Draco se k němu sklonil a zašeptal: „Sevři mě… Udělej se pro mě.“
„A mně se směješ za Seamuse?“ zašustil pod Harrym hábit, jak nevěřícně zatřepal hlavou.
„Do svýho čeho?! A jak znovu?“ vyhrkl v přestávce mezi záchvatem kašle, způsobenými několika vločkami, které zbloudily do míst, kde neměly co pohledávat.
„Takže už ses rozhodl. Bezva. Sbohem klidné dny.“ Škoda že Harryho stížnosti nedopadaly na úrodnou půdu.
Harry se cítil uvolněně a byl to pocit, který nezažil… už několik let. Starosti přestaly existovat a to, že něco takového zažíval ze všech lidí zrovna s Dracem Malfoyem, bylo při nejmenším zvláštní. Zvláštní, ale ne nepříjemné. Podržel Dracovy ruce u země a přetočil se na blonďáka, takže teď seděl obkročmo na něm a musel obličej přiblížit jen pár centimetrů od toho Dracova, aby dokázal rozeznat, jak se tváří.
„Každý ho má. No tak, jedno jméno z mého sexznamu za každé jméno z toho tvýho.“
Po třetí použili prefektskou koupelnu a byli vyrušeni Ufňukanou Uršulou, která si neodpustila komentář nad jejich výkonem.
Po páté si Harry vyžádal omluvenku, protože měl hlad. Draco mu dal na jídlo pět minut, přičemž stejný čas ve Velké síni strávili i Ron s Hermionou, a pak se vypařili.
Harry šel.
„Kluci, běžte napřed, my vás doženeme“ Harry se zarazil v půli kroku a Malfoy do něj silou vrazil.
Dělali to v přístěnu na košťata.
„Jistě. A hned druhý den by o nás věděla celá Británie,“ poznamenal Harry suše.
Když se k němu připojili i Ron s Hermionou, nebylo o čem přemýšlet. Z ročníku nastoupili ještě Dean a jeho přítelkyně z Mrzimoru, tři Havraspáři včetně Lenky Láskorádové a Draco Malfoy jako jediný Zmijozel.
„Tak fajn, kolikrát do večera?“ natáhl Harry ruku před sebe, když ho smích přešel.
„Jsem v pořádku.“
„Nic,“ zavrčel, protože jí rozhodně nechtěl říkat o tom, že Malfoy má spadeno na jejího přítele. Hermiona se výjimečně nevyptávala. Nejspíš měla až moc dobrou náladu, aby si všímala…
„Asi jo… Co tvůj sexznam, Pottere?“
Nemluvil, ani když ho oslovili, prostě jen byl. Nebelvíři se mu po nějaké době přizpůsobili a trávili ve společenské místnosti minimum času, protože to bylo jediné místo, kterému se tichý Zmijozel vyhýbal.
„Protože se zítra ráno většina studentů vrací ke svým rodinám, mám pro vás malý vánoční dárek už dnes. Po večeři prosím zůstaňte sedět na svých místech. Skupinka dramatického kroužku pod vedením Hermiony Grangerové a Ronalda Wealeyho, kteří přípravám kulis, scénáře a celého programu věnovali každou volnou minutu, si pro vás nazkoušela inscenaci známého mudlovského vánočního příběhu. Věřím, že si představení užijete.“
„Jsou jako králíci, do hajzlu,“ zajíkl se smíchy a s potěšením sledoval, jak i Dracovi cukly koutky.
V tichosti dojedli u nebelvírského stolu, a když se Ron s Hermionou neukázali, pokrčil Harry rameny:
Ale v chodbě na ně nikde nenarazili, a když vyšli, stáli před jednou z nepoužívaných učeben. Harry se nerozpakoval přiložit k dřevěným dveřím ucho, vlastně ani nevěřil, že by uvnitř Ron s Hermionou byli.
Harry nastoupil osmý ročník s očekáváními, která se realitě ani v nejmenším nevyrovnala, dokonce se jí ani nepřiblížila. Válka skončila, Voldemort byl mrtvý a Harry nevěděl, co dál. Měl plány na budoucnost, ačkoliv v okamžiku, kdy se dozvěděl, že je posledním viteálem, se jich vzdal a nepočítal s tím, že by přežil.
„Víš, jakou musí mít fantazii? Přece to nedělají furt stejně… jedenáctkrát za den… Tomu nevěřím. Pojď, třeba se něco přiučíme.“
„Snape.“
Harry frustrovaně vydechl, a když ho Malfoy pobídl, nadhodil další jméno: „Blaise Zabini.“
„Vy nás doběhnete, jasně,“ mávl Harry rukou a rozmrzele sledoval, jak jeho přátelé zmizeli v tajné chodbě v pátém patře.
„Co řekneme Ronovi a Hermioně?“ nadhodil Harry, když si kouzlem vyžehlil oblečení a pracně se do něj navlékl.
„Pojď, srabe.“
„Pokolikáté už?“
Byla jen půlnoční klidná obloha. Tma dokázala skrýt mnohé a Draco se hodlal schovávat v její náruči.
Ale přežil. Dráha bystrozora ani život po boku Ginny Weasleyové se mu však nezdály být tou správnou cestou. Ginny mu nechávala prostor, aby se „se vším srovnal“, ale Harry si byl jistý, že se k ní nevrátí už nikdy. A bystrozorem být nechtěl. Svou úlohu splnil a chtěl klid. Vrátit se do školy a pro změnu si užít jeden klidný rok, během kterého bude jeho největší starostí odevzdat úkol do Lektvarů, se zdálo jako příjemným odpočinkem. Bude mít dost času ujasnit si, jakému oboru se chce do budoucna věnovat a dokončí si vzdělání.
„To je… To je… Komnata…“ snažil se Harry popadnout dech. „Komnata nejvyšší potřeby.“
„Je to lepší než venku. Člověk nenavlhne,“ přerušil Potter trapné ticho ještě trapnější poznámkou.
„No, technicky ještě není večer, takže děláš ukvapené závěry,“ vyřčené zmíněným Zmijozelem ho proto v první chvíli šokovalo. Zůstal zírat, čelist mu někam upadla a pak se nahlas rozesmál.
Draco pustil Harryho loket, pohledem překontroloval svou snídani, jako by mu mohla dát nějaké odpovědi, a pak pomalu kývl. Vítězoslavné úšklebky Zmijozelských viděl jen Harry a zamrazilo mu z nich. Zmijozelové jsou děsiví, to mu nikdo nevymluví.
„Tak co?“ vyhrkl Draco dalšího dne ráno, aniž by Harryho aspoň pozdravil. Když se večer viděli naposledy, bylo to pět a výsledek tudíž nejistý.
Harry shodil z ramenou svůj hábit a lehl si na něj, Draco ho po chvíli následoval. Okolní svět přestal existovat. Nebylo půl třetí odpoledne, čas na hodinu Přeměňování v hradě plném otravných lidí, kteří po Dracovi divně koukali a šuškali si, kdykoliv prošel kolem. Neexistovaly starosti o otce, který čekal v Azkabanu na spravedlivý soudní proces, ani o matku, která se uzavřela do sebe a donutila tak Draca vrátit se do školy. Doma by se totiž zbláznil.
„Když to zvládnou oni, tak my taky.“
„Ještě trochu doprava,“ uslyšel náhle Hermionin hlas a leknutím odskočil.
„Kurva!“ zaklel Harry, když se mu podařilo popadnout dech. „Ty a Ginny?! Tohle už z hlavy nedostanu!“
* * * * *
„Každou.“
„Myslím, že jsme to ráno nedořešili,“ dloubl Harry do Malfoye, zatímco ten předstíral spánek na hodině Dějin čar a kouzel. „Ron byl někdy na tvém seznamu?“
„Ten tón se mi vůbec nelíbí. Jako by ses už rozhodl,“ konstatoval Harry a bál se na Draca podívat.
„Pošesté se vytratili, když jsem ve společenské místnosti hrál šachy. Pak ještě Ron odešel z ložnice, když si myslel, že už spím, a vrátil se, až když se rozednívalo. Možná kdybychom naše tipy sečetli?“ navrhl Harry a jeho hlasem prosakovala zoufalost. Nemohl uvěřit, že si jeho nejlepší přítel tak užívá!
Trvalo dlouho, než Harry odpověděl. „Tak to nic moc neznamená, pokud i ty nejsi na tom mém.“
Bylo mu příjemně a rameno hřálo, nic víc nepotřeboval.
* * * * *
„Vypadni,“ zavrčel Malfoy a už se po nich otáčeli nejblíže sedící se zlověstnými výrazy v obličejích.
„Kulis,“ doplnil Draco bledý jako stěna.
„Zakázané ovoce, možná? Nevím. Charisma? Až když zemřel, jsem zjistil, že mě celé ty roky chránil a pomáhal mi. To s jedním zamává. Myslím, že to bylo jen platonické poblouznění nebo tak něco.“ Cosi v jeho hlase ale Dracovi naznačovalo, že v tom z Harryho strany bylo něco víc.
„Dnes? Teprve potřetí.“
* * * * *
„Pravděpodobně. Ginny Weasleyová.“ Harry se zakuckal. „Co? Mýho ptáka bohužel nezajímá, jestli je ta osoba čistokrevná.“
to get one of the library’s copies!”
”Oi —!” Seamus yelps, flinching so dramatically he almost topples backwards off his bed. ”You nearly took my eye out!”
After they’ve finished their tea, Draco follows Sirius out into the garden to help him coax the gnomes out of Remus vegetable patch and Harry stays behind to help Remus with the washing up. Once it’s just the two of them, he asks his daddy about the change in Sirius attitude towards Dumbledore, worried the two of them have fallen out because of him.
that you—”
”Like Sirius said, it was probably a combination of shock and some lingering effects of the dream… that’s all…”
Madam Pomfrey comes bustling over and starts to wave her wand over his body while he sips the chocolate and finally declares some food and rest and he’ll be fit as a fiddle. Harry can’t even think of food though. It’s all he can do to get the hot chocolate down… But sleep sounds good. Amazing, in fact.
”All right, Marcus, that’s enough, they’ve got the point…” Adrian mutters and next to him and Flint immediately wheels around to pin him with a furious glare.
Slick™’
Harry and Granger both let out surprised chuckles, and Harry nods in agreement. Granger, on the other hand, seems to be in doubt.
He can tell when Draco has woken up properly, because his breathing becomes shallower and there’s a sudden tension in his arm, like he’s trying really hard to keep it loose and relaxed around Harry’s body so as not to disturb him.
”There was another article?” Harry says, feeling himself grow heavier at the idea, especially knowing that his dads will probably get another handful of hateful letter soon, if that’s the case.
”You’ll have to excuse Harry’s dad, Draco”, Remus says with an exasperated yet fond glare in Sirius direction. ”He can be a little abrupt at times… But please, do have a seat…”
”What?”
The whole thing is just too weird, Harry decides and doubles back to the door. He has to make it back to the Slytherin dorms before Snape gets back to the dungeons, in case he decides to make sure Harry really is in his bed…
Harry gives the girl a sidelong look, then glances at the twitching Chocolate Frog leg on the table in front of her, that is no closer to being Vanished now than when she’d started hurling the spell at it a quarter of an hour ago.
He knows he should tell them. Now, while he has the opportunity.
He’s avoiding Harry’s eyes and when Harry turns his head to look at him, his already rosy cheeks turn an even deeper shade of red.
Several Gryffindors turn to give him weird looks.
Harry sighs, then begins talking. He knows there’s no point in sugar-coating anything, so he simply ploughs through everything that he remembers Dumbledore telling him, more or less verbatim. Then finishes by reciting the prophecy about himself and Voldemort.
rather sharply, that it occurs to Harry that maybe Seamus is the house-elf prying him with firewhiskey (or whatever the spirits in the drink is. Harry stopped tasting it after the second one.)
Then he’s gone.
”All right…” Remus says. ”Why don’t you just invite your closest friends from Slytherin?”
”Zzzzz….”
Seamus gives her an exaggerated nod of encouragement, “
! Fine, I’ll just go and you guys can visit him”, he tells his friends and then turns away and storms back down the corridor.
There is someone who wants to do him real harm, and it’s not a dragon or a merperson, it’s a human being, probably a Death Eater… and whoever they are, they’ve just murdered Barty Crouch, because he was going to warn Dumbledore…
Draco looks up again, a glint of something akin to hope in his eyes.
—!” Draco pants behind him.
He fidgets next to the goblin a little nervously as he waits for him to unlock the door. He peers inside the vault, mildly surprised to see a small mount of gold. Venturing inside, he has to remind himself to only fill his money bag up halfway. Even if there is a lot of gold left and only two more years of school, he still doesn’t know what kind of job he might want after graduation, if he’ll need to continue his studies beyond Hogwarts or not, and if it turns out Dumbledore is right and he has to go to war…
Blonde strands of hair tickle his abdomen as Draco ducks his head to give the inside of Harry’s thigh a teasing lick, right where it connects with his groin.
Just go!”
”Only a very powerful witch or wizard could have hoodwinked a magical object like the Goblet of Fire”, Moody says quietly.
