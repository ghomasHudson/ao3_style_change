31. There was something in Draco’s face, something in the tilted moonlight of the expression that told Harry that Draco wanted Harry to kiss him, that Draco wouldn’t do it himself. Harry always walked into the forest to die, this was no different. Draco watched him walk.
Draco is there when he arrives. Both the spilled tea and empty cup from yesterday have been removed from the room, though by Draco or some invisible cleaning staff, Harry has no idea.
“That I don’t want to know Malfoy’s deepest darkest secrets? How is that surprising?” Harry asks, then wishes he’d just agreed. He’s thankful no one else is home yet and waits quietly for Luna to read his soul out for him like a scroll.
“Fire burns hotter than blood,” Draco replied, his face entirely glamored. It was in this way that they let each other know the ruse wasn’t up.
“No, you have to sign up for those special,” Malfoy responds, pushing the radio across the counter. Harry can’t tell if he’s annoyed or amused and doesn’t know which one he hopes it is. He doesn’t know when Malfoy started being so hard to read. “Take your radio.”
Dara rests a hand on her chest, pretending to be swept away. “I’m so impressed with you right now that I can’t even be mad that you got it first.”
Ron rolled over with a groan, blinking up at him with groggy eyes. “Why are you so chipper this morning?”
Draco is looking crossly at himself in the window, having noticed that the back part of his hair is sticking straight up. It doesn’t look all that different from the way it had in the fuzzy morning light when he’d woken up at Grimmauld Place. Harry wishes he didn’t have such a vivid memory of how vulnerable and awful Draco had looked in his sleep.
He saw Nagini in the thick scaled body and intelligent eyes, even though he knew this snake couldn’t be her. Horrid memories trickled through his brain, of threats, idle and serious, of snapping jaws unhinging, the dripping of venom on the table, the words ‘swallowed whole.’
“If by that you mean, ‘do I have detention’, the answer is yes,” Harry replied, shoving her book to the side and giving them a smile. “Why, do you have grand plans?”
Harry laughs, which Draco doesn’t think he’s ever made Harry do before. Draco’s crush on Harry, which has been growing steadily larger and more unwieldy all year, is reaching truly horrifying proportions. He is never going to recover. He is going to be like this forever: gaping fondly at Harry when he laughs.
“Oh no,” Pansy said, dragging him by the arm until they could push their way into an empty classroom. “Deep breaths, darling, please.”
“She’s basically the devil, but you know the saying: ‘keep your friends close and your enemies closer.’” Draco says, and Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” Draco snipped, giving the grass one last kick before looking insolently back up at Harry, who had the strange and horrible urge to smile.
“Oh, no, no you got most of it,” Harry says. He knows he should look away before Draco stands up, but he doesn’t, just watches as Draco dries his face with a dish towel, scrubbing his hair back with his free hand and standing tiredly in the kitchen, staring back at Harry. Ron has his back to both of them and is humming, the radio still going, and Harry knows somehow that he’s not turning around on purpose. Draco won’t break his gaze, his eyes gray and still wild and maybe a little sad, and Harry is waiting for him to say whatever it is he’s going say, but he just deflates a little, tossing the tea towel onto the table. “I’m. I’m going to go outside.”
Harry shakes his head. He’s never kept it a secret, but it was a part of him no one ever really wanted to know about. “Abusive childhoods are usually the backstories of the villain, not the hero.”
“I really think she wants us to be friends,” Harry said, still feeling silly about it even as he said it. “Maybe even real life friends.” Draco looked stricken, and Harry shrugged, trying to brush it off as a minor fancy. “I don’t know, it’s just an idea.”
Pansy purses her lips at him. It’s only his expert reading of her facial expressions that allows him to detect that she does think he’s being a bit cute. “Alright, who has kissed Draco?” She raises her hand, as does Blaise, but the rest of the party looks tremendously relieved to not have to put their hands up again. “Very shocking.”
“I kinda thought,” Harry begins. Draco thinks he’s quite brave for trying to start a sentence right now. “That you maybe didn’t like me very much? I think maybe that’s not true. I’ve been rethinking that. I think maybe you do like me?”
“Are you okay?” He whispers as they walk towards the front desk, and Draco nods stiffly, ever the best pretender.
“I don’t think we can often help what we do to what we love,” Draco replied slowly, not sure why’d he’d taken the conversation into personal territory but wishing nothing more than to drag it immediately back out. “Read it to me.”
Luna is sitting in the middle of a pile of clippings, photographs, and large sheets of paper in their underwear and a particularly enormous sweater. He recognizes this as one of the later stages of the Quibbler’s development: all of the little pieces being placed on pages and resized and moved and resized again.
“Are you just making that up?” she asks accusatorially, and Draco shakes his head. “Ask one of the nurses to get you a flower code book, they’re all in there.” He pauses for a moment. “Harry, I know you’re out there.”
“I’m not! I’ve only dated two people,” Harry said, looking affronted that Draco would suggest such a thing. “You’re the one who gave it to me, how does that make me a tart?”
“I could probably be more enthusiastic,” Harry replied apologetically. “I’m shit at dancing. No rhythm.”
“She’s going to be the minister one day, I’m telling you right now,” Ron tells Harry seriously, as Hermione swats at him with her magazine.
“I’ll read your tarot some time and then we’ll see who’s smug,” she says, then flips her notepad open. “Got the interview with Opal McGovern.”
“So I see, very provocative,” Draco said, apparently playing along for once. She turned to Harry, leaving Ron to try and untangle Ginny from her yarn prison. “And what exactly are you working on?”
“Really mature, Potter,” Draco snapped, her arms crossed defensively over her chest. She had her face screwed up in a scowl, although she wasn’t actively throwing a tantrum so she appeared to be accepting her fate.
“Yes I’m aware,” Draco says primly, and Harry wishes he wasn’t so endeared by the way all his old mannerisms come back when he pretends he doesn’t care about things. “Just be grateful my father has passed or I’d make you meet him too.”
In order to lead Draco to his bedroom, which has clothes all over the floor and an absolutely bizarre collection of items on every surface, Harry has taken him by the hand. He’s done it very casually and possessively and it’s doing a very evil, twisty thing to Draco’s heart.
“Potter.” It was said imperiously, without a tremor but backed by some violent emotion Harry couldn’t begin to understand. “This is highly unnecessary. Any debts you might assume you owe to me, I can assure you, are settled.”
This one had been off to such a calm and regular start, which should have been Draco’s cue that something was about to go terribly, terribly wrong. Draco had identified this as the kind of night where he’d eat all the snacks, have at least one weirdly intense conversation with Blaise, Hermione, or Luna, and be curled up in bed by midnight.
“Because I need to show you,” Draco said, tugging him along. He looked up at the canopy, his face screwed up in distress. “We’re leaving!”
“What was that?” Harry asked, looking up at the forest with concern. “I feel like she’s always pushing us together, like she wants us to be friends maybe.”
, Harry thinks vaguely, and looks pointedly away from the lean, muscular lines of Draco’s shoulders.
He doesn’t know why he can’t stay away, doesn’t know why seeing Malfoy like this makes Harry want to comfort him, makes him need to be comforted. He looks at Pansy’s face, red and blotchy with anger and something more desperate, maybe love, looks at the sidewalk that gives him no answers and at the passerby pretending not to stare.
“Coming, love,” Narcissa calls back, a clattering of china floating in from the kitchen. Her voice is familiar from the trials and before and Harry wants to hide or sink through the cream colored carpet. “Sit down, make yourself comfortable.”
Near the front of the room, McGonagall was demonstrating the steps to the waltz with Michael Corner, who looked equal parts amused and terrified to be dancing with her. Harry and Anthony gave it their best go, doing a few stilted 1-2-3s as the music reverberated through the space.
“I love you, Zabini, but I don’t trust you as far as I could throw you,” Draco said, wishing even as he said it that he had someone to tell, someone to unload all the horrible secrets onto so he didn’t have to carry them alone. That said, if he could barely keep his mouth shut about it, he had no illusions about how anyone he chose to confide in would react.
He blows almost-smoke-rings and rubs his fingers over the dead flesh of the dark mark. It used to be so sensitive, used to feel like fire when he brushed up against it and now it doesn’t feel at all, which is disorienting. If he smokes three cigarettes it’ll be good luck. One for Mother, one for Blaise, one for Pansy. One for today, one for yesterday, one for tomorrow. All three, just for him.
“None taken,” Harry said, raising his glass in a mock toast. Harry could have used a miracle, or a few extra years between himself and everything that had happened. He thought he might be getting better, but he wasn’t entirely sure what being better would mean. He didn’t think that he’d ever be without scars.
The curtain rustles and Draco appears from behind it, his fingertips dark with grease, undereyes dark with lack of sleep. “Back again.” There’s a tiredness there that wasn’t there when he first started coming, and he hopes it’s the kind that comes with death and not with him.
“Tell me about it,” Harry said, scanning the fray, which reeked of sleekeasy’s hair potion, a particularly potent muggle hairspray that Lavender swore by, and an interesting cocktail of perfumes and aftershave. “They said party and the Gryffindors said yes.”
He hadn’t saved the pictures from the last time, the ones where it had looked, if possible, even worse. He wishes he had, but knows that whatever he found doing a side by side comparison would make him need to shut himself permanently in his bedroom until he died.
“You’re still shaking,” Draco said, reaching out a hand like he might offer it and then pulling it back.
You really need better taste in men. It’s enough to make me want to come back from the  grave and haunt you. Next time you get within five feet of anything that hideous I’ll rattle some chains around until he leaves you alone. Isn’t your celebrity status good for a proper conquest? I’d guess that maybe ugly is just your type, but the girls you dated were at least nice to look at. You’re making it too easy to make fun of you.
“I don’t want to,” Draco said, still gripping the windowsill with a controlled anger. “But I’m going to be stuck with you whether you’re shit or not so we might as well.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. He hasn’t felt this small in years. He can feel the slide of the knife, expanding against all of his organs. He is nothing again, he is Harry Potter, he is nothing again. He was okay this morning, this morning Draco hadn’t set foot into his brain and he hadn’t remembered. It hits like a freight train, like the snap of a rubber band. “I’m sorry it’s not fun for you, like your fucking childhood. I’m sorry it’s ugly and that you have to deal with it like I had to deal with it for eleven years.”
“Have I hurt anyone?” Draco asks, reaching up to touch his hair, which is a mess. He fusses with it until it resumes an approximation of its normal shape, leaving only a few strands in the back that haven’t quite cooperated. There’s also a fair bit of dirt in it, and a shred of a flower petal. Harry pointedly does not mention the flower petal.
“I’m really am so glad you’re alright, Harry,” she says, picking up one of Ron’s weird sandwiches and giving it a skeptical glance before nibbling on the edge. She’s wearing her Ministry robes and looks miles better than any of the rest of them, except maybe Dara who has appeared in the doorway looking quite clean in a Molly-Made-Jumper and a pair of ratty joggers. “When Draco and Ron told me I was worried sick.” Her brow furrows. “And then I was pissed.”
Recovered from his lycanthropic jaunt, he’s as sharp, glittering, and unforgiving as a dagger and it’s a bit much to deal with, even over coffee. He keeps making Harry want to smile.
It’s a whisper of fear and barely being able to reach the top cabinet. It’s a deep crushing sadness. He had forgotten it. He had forgotten the sadness. He wants to leave. He wants to leave. He wants to leave and he is so sorry, someone is so sorry, and he’s pushing and they’re spiraling up again, out of memories until he’s sitting in a chair across from Draco feeling absurdly torn apart.
Letting Dara leave is the nice thing to do, and comes with the added bonus that she won’t be present for the horrors likely to unfold once Draco wakes up. Saying embarrassing things about Harry is Draco’s lifelong personal joy, and if he does say anything, Dara will bring it up once a week until Harry dies.
“Open your eyes,” Draco says, looking him over with a discerning eye. “Close.” Harry does, feeling the press of the pads of Draco’s fingers against his eyelid. “Okay, done with that, you can open.”
“She knows who I am,” Draco says idly, like it doesn’t bother him, and Harry wonders if that’s an act.
“You go be the hero, Mione, I’ll take Blaise off of your hands,” Ron said, earning herself an elbow in the side from Hermione.
“I think you’re having a panic attack,” Harry says, retrieving the cup of tea from the counter and placing in front of Draco, who is on the special line between vibrating and utter stillness. “I wouldn’t say I’m not freaking out,” he says as gently as he can, when Draco just keeps staring at him. So much about this situation is reminding him of all the ways that he, Ron and Hermione learned how to talk each other down after the war. “I think maybe you’ve made some logical leaps that our tamperer won’t have made. No one thinks we’re doing Auror business.” Harry grimaces. “They think we’re dating.”
He’d felt vaguely ill from the moment he’d left the forest in the dawn light, maybe even from the moment he woke up outside of Harry’s arms. He still couldn’t fathom it, that the truth might be that it really was Harry, that he’d been pulled into the forest just as Draco had. It seemed incredible that he hadn’t considered it until that night, the possibility that they were both lost in the same place. He’d been so convinced that Potter could never feel anything for him that he’d never once considered that Potter must think the same sorts of things.
Ron wiggles his fingers experimentally. “Awesome, love my new hand. Palfoy, if you would come help me make some lunch, that would be great.” Ron is doing an admirable job of pretending that this new configuration of friends sitting in his living room is incredibly normal. The fact that Draco and Ron have effectively worked together is easily the funniest part of all of this, and it’s taking all of Harry’s self control to not make a bigger deal about it.
“Awesome,” Harry says, remembering that part of the reason that he and Dara are such a good team is because she always, no matter what, has a plan and a can-do attitude. “What’s on the docket today?”
Draco sighed deeply, standing slowly and taking two awkward pacing steps like she didn’t know what to do with her body before finally just standing there staring out the window. “As long as I don’t have to be nice to you when you’re being a knob.”
Harry nods enthusiastically and Pansy looks more lost than he’s ever seen her. Standing here with both of them is odd, the knowledge of all the things they did and didn’t do weighing heavy in the air. He wonders if they have nightmares like he does, if they regret choosing the wrong side and if they regret it for the right reasons. He hopes they do, but he’s always had too much faith in people.
Ron’s eyes went wide and then amused, sliding out of bed with a grin and following Harry to the bathroom.
Harry presses a soft kiss against the curve of Draco’s jaw. “Afraid someone will know you’re leaving lip marks on boys?”
Draco finally turns to look at him and Harry holds his gaze defiantly. The feelings aren’t going away, just swirling around in his gut as he studies Draco’s gray-blue eyes. He wants to put his hands on Draco and that doesn’t make sense but it’s the only thing he has.
“Your turn to put a sickle in the Pizza Party Jar,” Harry says, picking up the jar full of coins and holding it up for Dara, cheering when she digs a sickle out of her pocket and wings it straight in with a clatter.
“It’s just the forest,” Draco said, sounding pained in his repetition. “It doesn’t matter if it’s only in the forest.”
“Very sure,” Harry responds, meeting the challenge in Draco’s eyes. He’s so invested in winning their little staring contest that he trips over the curb and Draco laughs at him.
The forest had never actually spoken to him with words and he was fairly positive that she couldn’t, but he thought she might speak the messy and inexact language of human emotion. There was something giddy about her, tempered only by a measured kind of ceremony, like she wanted things to be special.
“You’re the one who didn’t know you could get yarn from rabbits,” Harry said, flicking Draco in the knee. “Besides, what are you here for, can you knit?”
Draco breathes out in one long huff, closing his eyes like that makes it easier. “You don’t want to be seen out with me, you’d never hear the end of it.”
She gives him a look that somehow conveys that she sees through him, although he’s not entirely sure what he’s hiding. “He’ll be here in about an hour, he usually works weekday mornings. Are you his friend?”
Draco shrugs, leaning up against the wall. Harry is suddenly aware of Draco’s body, of the sharpness of his shoulders and legs that are almost too long to be proportionate. He can’t remember ever being so interested in the way someone’s waist dips in and he wants desperately to reach under his jumper to feel the warmth. He has the bizarre desire to make sure Draco has a heartbeat.
After years of the freezing Slytherin dormitories and having his house occupied by the Dark Lord himself, Draco had become quite talented at warming charms. Even so, the trek back up to the castle refused to be anything but brisk and not even a scalding shower could entirely warm him back up.
35. “Do you remember, when you cursed me, how much water was on the floor? I thought I would float away, if not in the water, then in the blood,” Draco said, a fire going in the fireplace, everyone else long asleep.
“Mr. Macmillan, have you been practicing?” McGonagall asked, and though Harry recognized her attempt to speak more softly to him, he still cowered.
Draco noticed the glare and Harry’s annoyance from three tables away. Any amusement he might have once drawn from Harry’s dour mood was overshadowed by how accustomed he’d become to meeting Harry’s sleep heavy eyes from across the table. In retrospect, he felt that something about those glances had conveyed empathy.
“I was so tired last night,” Harry volunteers, picking at the seam on the chair and avoiding looking at Draco. “Luna took pity on me and made me pasta and I was in bed by eight.”
“I didn’t know,” Harry repeated, the softness in Draco’s features making her nervous. She didn’t know Draco could be that soft, that her pointy features could look warm like that when talking about something she loved.
Hermione blinks at him for a long moment, teacup suspended halfway to her mouth. “And by talking do you mean exchanging friendly words or stalking and harassing?”
Harry is pretty sure Malfoy doesn’t want him to stay, but he doesn’t want to deal with the rain so he lingers at the counter for a moment. “I’ll just wait here, if that’s fine?”
Harry nodded, first perfunctorily and then like he couldn’t remember how to stop doing it. He had liked it, the clean violence, the flames.
“Legilimens.” Draco casts before Harry can stop him and they’re flying through old memories, through Harry watching Cedric play Quidditch, yellow robes whipping out behind him, sun hot on the grass. The scene changes and it’s pouring, Harry’s hair slicked down around his ears, Cedric turning circles on the far edge of the pitch.
Harry wasn’t sure she could remember a single time that the post-Quidditch party had been an open event for anyone but significant others, but she thought maybe it was a sign of the times that most of the upperclassmen were packed into the common room as someone blasted the last ten years worth Now That’s What I Call Wizard Rock.
“Unless she’s not in or there’s something unusual with the order, that’s something she usually does,” Draco says, finally meeting Harry’s gaze. “I’ll take this month’s to see if I notice anything strange.”
The next morning Harry realizes they’ve been touching each other like they’re afraid of catching something this whole time. Even in the aftermath he can remember the eager movement of Draco’s body, the eagerness of his mouth, the grin on his face as Harry kissed him far too gently.
About a year later, Draco still can’t decide if the Slytherin/Gryffindor parties are the best or the worst idea that Hermione’s ever had. There’s technically a Ravenclaw involved too, but regardless of house, Luna remains the least predictable person that Draco has ever met. After they arrived with jello shots that cursed everyone with the uncontrollable need to dance, Draco had upgraded them from Non-Threatening to Very Sneaky. The dancing incident, in which Draco had discovered he could do a body roll, had made a compelling argument for staying far, far away from Gryffindors and etcetera.
“I forgot how tiny teenagers are,” Harry says. “I thought, fifteen, that’s a person, right? Wrong! That’s a child! Tiny! Why did they let us try to defeat the greatest dark wizard of all time as literal infants?”
Draco knows that he needs to ask Harry if its alright to kiss him, but the idea of saying the words is so heinous that he nearly stands back up and walks straight out the door. Against his better judgement, he takes two calming breaths and stays exactly where he is.
Harry wonders if anyone has noticed they’ve gone missing yet. Since they’re always running out to do field work, Ron might not notice if he misses work tomorrow, but if he doesn’t show up to family dinner with Ron and Hermione on Thursday they’ll know for sure that he’s either dead or kidnapped. He hopes they don’t have to wait that long, especially if the case is on the line. He realizes, with minor embarrassment, that Draco will almost certainly notice that he’s gone, since they’ve been making a habit of showing up at each others’ houses in various states of disarray every twenty four hours. He wonders if Draco has already sent off a letter in his neat handwriting asking politely if there are any updates. He wonders what he’ll think if Harry doesn’t reply or come tumbling out of his fireplace unannounced and at what point he’ll realize what’s going on.
Draco wants to be more disapproving of the fact that Harry is clearly a sap who wants to cuddle after sex, except that he is absolutely going to deign to curl up against Harry’s chest, which is now very clean and very warm. “Do you think our friends have noticed we’re gone?” Draco asks, mostly into Harry’s chest hair.
“Ginny told me that Draco waved at Harry earlier today,” Seamus added conspiratorially, once again proving the sheer unstoppable force of the Gryffindor Gossip Mill.
The feeling bubbling in Harry’s chest like old lava doesn’t have a name but it feels like bile in his throat and he wants to throttle Draco before he can say any more horrible words. He’s lying but he saw everything, knows everything, knows things Harry wanted to forget, and Harry knows nothing about him, is only guessing in the dark.
I didn’t even send that last letter, and yet I still manage to feel horrible about it. When I titled this letter Potter it felt really dramatic and angry but now it just looks stupid. I’m going to try again.
“Potter,” Malfoy said lazily, sitting up on his elbows to give Harry a searching look. Harry tried his hardest to read Malfoy’s expression but couldn’t get past his mask of indifference.
“I think she is, you know she can’t resist a pretty dress and a party,” Parvati said fondly. “And I need her to do my makeup, I still can’t put on fake eyelashes by myself.”
“Not helping,” Draco replied grouchily, as Blaise continued to get ready, shoving a few quills in the outside pocket of his bag.
“I don’t want to be empty like you,” Harry spits back, looking at the places that Draco is shivering on the edge of falling apart, how his skin looks too thin and shows all his veins, how he’s always too still or blurring into motion. Harry keeps wanting to compare him to animals.
It’s not every day that Harry trudges through muggle London with a broken record player in his arms. In fact, today is the first time he’s had to deal with this particular situation, and he’s sincerely hoping he’ll never have to deal with it again. He’d apparated as close to the tiny shop as he could, but the trudge from the alley to the door seemed especially long in the inclement weather. Next time Ron’s stupid record player breaks, he’s going to have to get it fixed himself.
“I’m not in the mood for gossip, Pans,” he said, letting her take his arm as she steered them toward the great hall.
Draco tilts his nose into the glass. “Mmm. The bouquet, so complex. I’m detecting… hmm. It must be grape.”
Harry wasn’t entirely sure what she understood, but he thought it better to finish his eggs and tune back into the idle chatter of the table than to ask for clarification.
“Of course, love,” she replies, affixing Draco with enough sympathy that Harry is sure she knows about the death of his father.
“What do you think that was?” Harry asked, looking up at the gently swaying branches, the movement making the spiderwebs glitter like water did under moonlight.
“I’m trying not to think about anything but your hands,” Draco said, the honesty scraping his throat raw. “It’s for the best.”
The music came on and Draco led her into the first steps, both of them falling into the easy rhythm of the dance. It was beginning to feel almost natural, all the hours of detention she’d put in beginning to make her arms stronger and her back stay a bit straighter.
“We can,” Harry said, caught up by the way he had to tilt his head a little bit up to kiss him, the way he smelled herbal and like comfort. “I want to.”
“You did,” Draco replies. “I still have a scar.” He makes a drawing motion down the center of his chest and finds a hint of his old drawl back. “Very heroic, a hit with all the blokes.”
The bell rings as he pushes in and Malfoy’s at the counter, looking soft in a gray jumper and a beanie. As Harry approaches the counter, he can see the frayed cuffs and the spot of grease smeared across Malfoy’s jawline, and he likes the way he isn’t half as pristine as he used to be. The only thing better than pristine is the way it rubs thin and goes to shreds.
“Have you packed for America tomorrow?” Draco asks idly, shading some snow on the side of one of his mountains.
“I just don’t know if this is a good idea,” Harry said, almost like a question, a last breath of logic left on his lips. He wasn’t sure about the implications of getting off with a mirage. He wasn’t sure about the implications of getting off with Draco. Once again, he found himself unsure which one was worse.
When he entered the forest that night he registered the spaces between the trees as peculiarly empty, even as the trees reached down to wish him a good night. The paths were simple that night, sending him in slow circles and up small inclines.
“Fortunate,” Draco says dismissively, before letting his face shift back to his other, gentler expression, something pleased in his eyes. “I don’t think I’ve lost it.”
“I think we crossed that bridge a long time ago,” Draco snipped back, arms coming to cross over her chest.
“What?” Draco asked, something in his eyes betrayed, something in his casual demeanor beginning to break already. Harry had hoped he would have known, that being a creation of the forest would have meant that mirage Draco would understand why he had to leave and would kiss him goodbye one last night. He hadn’t thought he’d have to explain, that maybe mirage Draco would miss him.
“You have to watch the game to heckle properly, mate,” Ron said seriously. “How else are we going to know what to heckle?”
“I’m reading the book,” Draco said, fumbling to pick it up, shoving it into Harry’s lap. “You told me to read muggle books.”
Harry is concerned to notice that Dara is starting to look at him with the same long suffering look she directs at Jess when Jess begins to argue bedtime. “Why don’t you let the people who want to fuck you decide whether or not you’re likeable, hmm? Give yourself the chance to be ghosted. Give yourself the chance to be stood up at a mid-level Italian restaurant.”
“I think so too,” Harry said, meeting smiling glances with grins of her own. “Kinda makes you feel like things are finally okay.”
“Smells great,” Harry says, dropping into a stool and pillowing his head in his arms. “Is there an open burner?”
Just as he thought it, the branch he was sitting on bent slowly down towards the water, depositing him stumbling back into the lake. Though his shirt instantly saturated with water, he stayed mostly upright and didn’t grab for Harry even though it was his first instinct.
“Yeah, Anthony said it would be okay,” Harry replied, smiling brightly in the hopes that she would be spared.
“What are you afraid of?” Harry asks, sitting back in the chair and pulling a leg up to rest his chin on it. He knows they should keep practicing but he feels like everything has been wrung out of him, that if he goes back in he’ll die in there, watching roll up bugs and feeling the knife move.
“What on Earth did you do last night?” Draco asks, fetching two floral printed cups from the cupboards. “You smell like smoke and you look a fright.”
Anthony seemed at a loss for words, opening and closing his mouth a few times before settling on a mild expression. “Maybe you should talk to her.”
“Because you’re the bloody problem!” Draco replied, eyes wild. He turned on his heel before Harry could reply, stomping off across the gardens and back up to the castle, leaving Harry standing alone by the lake.
Pansy snorted, her own table fairly successful, if a bit wobbly. “What a mess, truly. I don’t know how Granger stands either of them.” She made a face at Ron, who was doing the exact same thing as Harry. Hermione, perched on her own table, watched them with amusement.
Harry isn’t sure how long it takes before he gives up, slumping back in his chair with a glare. His hand has started to cramp and he has the first ticklings of a blinding headache accompanied by a low murmur of nausea. “You’re supposed to let me read your mind.”
Draco looks like he quite agrees. “Well, you already know I’m a werewolf,” he says, lowering his voice for the last word. He seems to be steeling himself for whatever he’s going to say. “And I trust you.” Harry gapes, and Draco cuts him off before he can respond. “I think you’re a knob and a pillock, but you’re a good person, even when you don’t have to be. It’s your whole thing.” Draco delivers the last part of this declaration as if he’s gently breaking the news of a death in the family.
“Okay - and I’m being dead serious here so you can’t laugh at me - I asked Luna out and she said no,” Blaise said, looking faintly embarrassed even in retrospect.
“Ms. Potter you have improved quite a bit since our last lesson,” McGonagall said, not even needing to correct Harry’s form when she paused to watch them. “I am glad to see you both back here looking no worse for wear.”
“I slept,” Draco said heavily, pulling himself out of bed and retrieving a clean uniform. The one from the previous night had been shoved unceremoniously to the bottom of his laundry hamper, although he’d briefly considered more dramatic options along the lines of burning it.
Harry lost track of what to do with his hands, the knife in his hand, the hands in front of him. Draco’s hands were out of sight. “I guess you would.”
The boy blinked up at him before shaking his head and replying with a mumble. “But he’s a Death Eater.”
“I broke my tv,” Harry says, and he knows how stupid this is but he’s beyond stopping himself anymore. He feels like he’s been giving himself excuses to talk to Malfoy since forever, and at least he can recognize that for what it is.
“You should tell him all of it,” the snake said, soft silvery voice in his mind. “He’d care, he’s like that.”
Over the course of an hour, the other trainees ended their own matches in disarmings, hexes, and the occasional well placed stunning spell, but Harry and Draco continued even after the high ceilinged training room grew quiet. They fought until the only sound was their heavy breathing, the movement of their bodies, and the fizz crack of magic. Around them, wands lowered and brows furrowed.
They stand like that in the fall chill, Draco’s head on Harry’s shoulder until Harry gets the courage to reach an arm around Draco, pulling him into his side. It’s the most they’ve ever touched, he realizes belatedly, and suppresses a shiver.
“You can sit wherever,” Harry says, and stifles a laugh when Draco looks relieved and picks Harry’s favorite aggressively-patterned red armchair. “I’ll get us a drink?”
Draco groans, reaching a hand up to pinch off the blood and then yelping when he realizes his nose is in fact, potentially broken. “Will someone fix me,” he says. “Whenever someone has a minute. At your convenience, really.”
“Not since you defeated Voldemort!” she says, eyes widening, not in fear but rebellion. He knows they’ve all been told by their parents not to say that word, but it’ll never hold the same chill it held for his generation. It’s terrifying that the memory can lose it’s pain that quickly, but maybe it’s better that way.
“Hufflepuff has no chance at the cup,” Harry said, slapping her hat down on the table. “Neville, stop letting Hannah Abbott tell you dirty lies.”
Some of the twinkle returns to Draco’s expression. “Copied them from the Prophet. I was at the library archives yesterday doing some general research.”
“Come on Harry, be realistic,” Hermione says, then sighs. “I can’t believe this. Next time anyone is fucking I want to be the first to know.”
“I know,” Harry said, letting his voice become muffled by the blankets. “Do you ever think I’m going to be normal again?” Everything worked in layers, he peeled the first one back.
He’s getting better at moving but he still doesn’t know how to leave or how to run to safety. No matter what he does they’re still there, all of his memories swirling up to meet them. Cho is crying, she has her head cradled in her hands and her elbows propped on the shiny pink table cloth and the helplessness is a secondary emotion to the sucker punch of grief. Harry is bad at crying and he is bad at dealing with crying and he wants to apologize but he doesn’t know why.
When Draco saw the figure through the trees he almost called out, assuming it must be Harry in the field of flowers made just for them. He quickened his step, breaking into the clearing only to find Hermione staring at him with a peculiar look on her face.
“I mean yeah, obviously,” Dara says, backing off. “Of course we’re still going to treat it as an emergency, I’m not saying we aren’t.”
“You have a really distinct magical signature,” Draco said, looking a bit haughty, like he was trying to make up for the pinkness of his cheeks. “It was what made me guess that you were real.”
Draco casts and Harry feels the flames as cool and bright as forgetting as they swallow him up, curl over his head. Draco is looking at him like a last resort. When the flames die down, Draco is watching the place where he used to be, the empty space where he stood. Harry has seen this expression on his face before, back in sixth year, back on the day of the battle, like he’d lost everything.
He nodded, standing before she could pull him up and straightening his shirt. So he’d fucked Harry. So he’d fucked him. So he would go back into the forest that night and do it again. So he would tell him secrets he’d never told anyone and read muggle books so maybe he could begin to understand. So he’d put all of it in a box labeled ‘fragile’ - so when school was over he’d seal it up tight.
“And then it’ll get easier?” Harry asks hopefully, the connotations behind everything pressing heavily against his chest.
“What is everyone else going to think?” Harry asked, squeezing Draco’s hand in his with a disbelieving kind of fervor. “My friends hate you. I mean no offense, but they do. And I think your friends hate me.”
It wasn’t until all his housemates had gone to bed that he pulled on his loafers and tip toed out of his room, through the deserted common room, and out to the Forest.
“What exactly does this hatred feel like?” Hermione asked slowly, her eyebrows high on her forehead.
“Glad to know my hair is a losing battle,” Harry replies wanly, and Draco shrugs, looking pleased with himself.
“To be fair, the hospital windows aren’t the worst place to watch Quidditch from,” Harry joked, remembering the many times she’d been laid up there while the Gryffindor team played.
Anyway, I’ll try not to gloat too much more about you and your failed relationship, though it is a little gratifying. The girl Weasley was always rather horrible, I’m glad you’re free of that. Go find yourself a nice boy to settle down with, Potter. Isn’t that funny, I’m making fun of you because you’re gay. I can’t believe I missed out on this opportunity for all seven years of our lovely friendship.
Insinuate that you are curious about his skin, that you want to know if it will peel off like the film on old milk.
Harry can feel his face doing something terrible and knows that he looks terrified, that he is terrified, that he doesn’t know how to speak.
“Oh always,” Harry replies with a smile and only Draco would understand the subtext, but the man smiles back anyway.
As he walked, the ground began to get boggier, the mud so sticky that he had to take his shoes off so they wouldn’t get ruined. A curling pale mist worked its way through the trees, almost soft in constitution as it tugged at his mop of hair and slid under his shirt.
“I’m not,” Harry protests, perhaps too strongly. “I just can’t figure it out. Why tamper with the potion now? Why do it at all?”
When Harry pushes open the door, Draco is already seated in the armchair on the left, arranging his robes and looking uncomfortable. He hasn’t seen him in person since they became partners and yet nothing is different.
“I want to play good guy,” Draco says snidely, and it’s so shrouded in sarcasm and contempt that it seems like more than just a throwaway comment.
“I’m glad we’re on the same side now,” Harry says, which is such a small way to say it, but a right one.
“Not too far,” Draco said, watching as Harry flipped through the pages until he came across Draco’s dog eared page.
“Where have you brought me, Potter?” Draco asks almost immediately upon materializing in the dank alleyway, frowning up at the still falling rain. “This is hardly sanitary.”
“Oh, fun!” The boy grins, reaching his hand out to Harry, who laughs at the absurdity of any of their schooltime interactions being labeled as ‘fun.’ “I bet you got up to tons of poncy private school adventures.”
At this point, Harry can barely tell the Death Eaters’ names apart, all the faces and atrocities running together, but Draco looks as if he can remember names and actions far too well.
“And once they know, they’re going to wonder how it is that I know and then they’re going to look into it and know that I, me, Draco Lucius Malfoy, am a werewolf and then, then, they will wreak both havoc and disaster upon me and my mother who, when her friends find out I’m a werewolf, will make clear to her that this is just one of many unfortunate slights upon the Malfoy family name, a name which can only truly handle so many more slights, in a way that is more subtly cruel than if they’d just flat out just said something mean.” His manner of speaking reminds Harry of a box of marbles being opened at the top of a flight of stairs. “Which compounds my previous point in regards to the untold horrors that will be visited upon me and London’s werewolf population at large, the likes of which I scarcely care to imagine and haven’t a clue how to prepare for.” He stops, bright pink, and takes a steadying breath. “Not to mention. The paper itself.”
“I mean, it’s really not, I don’t know how to do anything else,” Harry replies uneasily, unsure of how to proceed. He’d only started after being roped into it by Hermione on one of her crusades to help him get his life together and just never stopped. That doesn’t mean it’s good enough.
“That was the goal,” Draco said, trying to look disapproving but just looking pleased. “I was right about your eyes, they look less like pond water tonight.”
“How is she?” Draco asks, sounding only vaguely interested. It’s both an odd question and an odd tone, but when Harry looks up to study his face all he sees is a peculiar blankness. He’s struck by how many ways he’s seen Draco’s fast twist, how expressive he is, how schooled he is now.
Connie’s eyes narrow, and Harry identifies the experience as similar to being glared at by a gossipy version of Professor McGonagall. “You’re finally investigating my toad complaints? After years of being ignored by the Aurors, now you’ve come to reign justice upon Rob and his illegal toads?”
“You’re the stability I need in my life,” Lee says with a wink, ferrying their orders back to the kitchen.
Harry nods. “I know.” He leans back, looks at the man before him, conjures up empathy, up kindness. It’s not Draco’s fault Harry’s memories are tangled like brambles. It’s not his fault they were both pawns. Maybe it’s his fault that he never questioned it, that he spit horrible words with a smile and held Unforgivables on the edge of his tongue. It’s his fault he’s here now, if that’s anything.
“I’ll bring it to the back,” Draco says, picking up the radio and heading through the blue curtain. He doesn’t look back, but Harry follows anyway, hopping up on the enormous wooden table as Draco puts the radio away. “Belinda does all the tv and radio stuff, she only lets me fix the record players.” He dusts off his hands, always deadpan. “They don’t explode if you fuck up.”
“From what I heard you mostly just need to follow,” Anthony replied with a shrug. “I’ll try not to step on your toes.”
17. “Blood runs thicker than water,” Harry said, when Draco appeared in the kitchen, where Harry lingered always, in the wooden chair by the little table, waiting for things to come out of the oven.
“A surprisingly forward-thinking offering from Filbin. Last time he asked me if I had any experience with ‘rashes.’ Not any particular rash. Just in general,” Dara says. “And the kicker is that as the proud owner of a toddler, I do have experience with rashes, but you know what? Not for Goat Cheese Filbin.”
“Or the ones right before and after it, really.” Dara says. “Someone did a serious Obliviate on him.”
The forest tried to breathe as hard as it could, let the air shake its roots and tremble the tops of the trees so Draco could feel it, because the forest was worried for him and wanted him to breathe more slowly, to let his heartbeat calm.
While it’s happening, it never occurs to either of them that it’s the potion. It feels hyper real, saturated and reeking. Harry imagines he can see every pore of Draco’s skin, every vein pushing up against skin, every healed over scar. It’s like they’ve always felt like this, like it will always feel like this.
They were friends now, Harry remembered with a start, they’d talked and now they were friends. In years past they might have stopped to say something rude to each other and in the beginning of that year that might have merely pretended not to see each other but it was different now, not that Harry knew what that meant.
“Sixth year everything began to fall apart and I couldn’t pretend I didn’t feel things that I felt and that meant that I felt guilty and tired and that I had to acknowledge that everything I felt close to was changing. I couldn’t pretend that the family I loved was different from the family that killed people or that money and blood status actually mattered anymore. And I had to accept that much of the hatred I felt towards you was jealousy and desire.”
Harry can’t think about it for too long without wanting to scream, so he does, in the backyard in front of the tomato patch and then feels stupid for doing so. He wants so many things to feel like relief, but none of them do.
Pansy lets out a screech as Harry, who is sprawled on the couch, leans his head back to look over at Hermione, who looks like she’s beginning to regret her honesty. “What ‘Ermione?”
“If I thought McGonagall would give me Ernie back, I would ask in a minute,” Draco replied scathingly.
“Why not?” Harry asks, because it’s ridiculous but it doesn’t feel wrong. It doesn’t feel like what he expected or even like something safe, but its fun and he likes the way Draco kisses and the serious tilt to his frown.
“Dancing, Harry,” Anthony reminded her quietly, and Harry allowed herself to be danced around, though she tugged at Anthony when he tried to move her away from the conversation.
Wandering the castle that night, Draco thought it was inconvenient that despite the facade of normalcy, his body didn’t seem to want to heal. The only thing worse than his father’s suicide was the way Draco’s body refused to work as it should, resisting sleep and food and revolting against his efforts to breathe normally. It was as if Lucius had poisoned him too. Sometimes he still felt himself breathe like a swimmer coming up for air without any reason for doing it, and Pansy would sweetly tell him to stop hyperventilating, darling, please.
“I’ll see you, right?” Harry said, reaching for Draco’s hand like she might shake it, but instead pulled her in for a hug.
“They’d see through it,” Harry replies, only having to mentally conjure an image of Hermione glaring at him to be sure that they wouldn’t be able to pull anything off in time.
The electric orange of the shock blanket covers most of the familiar lankiness of Draco’s body, only his head and shoulders and a delicate hand visible. He looks unearthly, pretty, like flowers at night, Harry thinks, and then subsequently wonders if he should just leave Draco under the shock blanket and bolt if he’s going to be thinking thoughts like that.
“I think that’s a fair trade,” Hermione said, laughing at Ron’s blush. “What color mittens would you like?”
“Good evening, eighth years!” McGonagall began from the front of the room, clapping her hands twice to get everyone’s attention. “While this year’s Yule Ball will be quite different than the one we hosted during the festivities of the Triwizard Tournament, I still expect all of you to learn to dance to the best of your abilities. I firmly believe that in all of you is the potential for beauty and grace, though you may not see it in yourself. I’m immensely proud of the progress all of you have made this year in making this school a home for yourselves and your fellow students, and hope that the Yule Ball with continue in this regard while also allowing you to have a bit of fun.”
“Am I?” Harry asks, but he does take off his shirt, and then for good measure wriggles out of his trousers and his pants. Harry is covered with curling dark hair and his legs are even longer and more toned that Draco was already concerned they would be. Draco considers himself a garden variety hot person, but this is fucking ridiculous. It’s actually a good thing that Harry wears bizarrely fitted shirts and pants, Draco realizes with horror, because he would be too hot otherwise. “Good enough for you?”
Draco kisses him on the forehead, on the temple, on the jaw. Every place Draco touches feels like it belonged to a real body, a real person. Harry doesn’t know how to ask him to never remove his hands, so he just holds still and hopes Draco will absentmindedly forget them there. “I don’t hope for anything anymore.”
He sighs, pursing his lips and casting again. This time, he’s met not with resistance but with a quirk of surprise as Draco realizes he’s in his head again. Harry tries to take advantage of it, pushing forward into thick swirls of memories that don’t follow any order he’s used to. They’re connected, but it’s not quite a web and it’s strangely departed from the tunnel he felt in his own mind. They’re connected by criss crossing threads of recollection and it’s intensely disorienting. He’s nearly decided how to get anywhere when Draco shoves him out with a viciousness that surprises him.
“She’s making one for Ginny’s new girlfriend now, they’ve been dating for what, 3 months?” Ron scoffs. “You didn’t get one until we got engaged!”
Harry thinks, through the steamy fog in his brain that if Draco’s skin is already so pink and pale, that he’ll have an easy time sucking very obvious bruises onto it, which is exactly what he’d like most. Draco hums a moan as Harry clutches him close and bites down on the fragile skin of his neck, sucking until the skin is red under his teeth.
“Maybe her face is stuck like that?” Neville added, and both Ron and Harry nodded in very serious agreement.
I hope you’re well. I really do. I’m quite worried for you, you really don’t seem to be taking any of this very well. I’m sure things will turn around for you, but I’m a bit perturbed that I’m not going to be around to complain about it.
“Ah, your poor nose,” Lee says. “Wouldn’t want you to go the way of old Voldy.” He pauses for a very tragic looking expression. “Well, enjoy your food, let me know if you need anything.”
Draco smiled a secret kind of smile as she leaned back in, her hand falling back onto Harry’s jaw as she kissed her. Harry thought she might have had something she wanted to say, some kind of apology or words of comfort, but this was a beginning and they had as long to find those words as they wanted.
Harry shrugs. “I mean, that’s fine. You think I’m hot, so I feel fairly comfortable admitting that I think you’re hot.”
“Sit down, you’re hovering,” Draco says, waving him towards a trim little armchair. Draco’s apartment is as staid and tidy as the rest of him, but the longer Harry looks, the more strange treasures he sees lying on shelves and tucked next to books and other reasonable things. Harry spots, inexplicably, what appears to be a framed, crayon drawing of a princess and a knight, and bites back a smile when he recognizes Teddy’s handiwork. “All the dragons accounted for?”
“I’m Jay, it’s great to meet you,” he leans forward, like he’s imparting a secret. “Draco’s so tight lipped about school, I want to hear about what he was like. Adriene thinks he must have been even more posh at school but I don’t believe it.”
“I’d never ask anything like that of you,” Harry said, and she wasn’t worried, because Draco’s eyes were soft like they were when she talked about something she loved.
“Can you not be a bitch all the time?” Harry replied, ripping herself out of Draco’s grip. “Like I’m serious, can you just be fucking civil to me for two fucking seconds?”
“Thanks anyway though,” Harry replies, and he knows he doesn’t have any excuse to exist here any longer so he trudges out, not minding the rain as it gets in his hair.
Draco and Hermione have embarked on a line of conversation involving the various perks of high quality quill nibs, an affection that possibly only they and the literal Percy Weasley share, and Harry listens in relative confusion until they come to a stopping place before nudging Draco’s knee with his own. “As much as I love you all, I think it’s maybe time for me to find a shower and a real bed.”
Harry caught sight of the label, which read ‘Borneo’s Miracle Bruise Cure,’ and did not feel overly comforted.
He nods even though Draco’s the one who brought him here, even though he’s not responsible for Draco drinking until he’s too wasted to apparate. “Of course, I’ll get a cab.”
During a presentation on self defense charms, Harry receives a text from Draco that reads ‘do you want your shirt back.’ Harry doesn’t remember getting his number, but it’s in his phone under ‘Draco’ followed by a dragon emoji, a green heart, and two green apples. Luckily the demonstration is nearly over, as thinking about Draco makes it infinitely more difficult to concentrate.
“Sometimes worse,” Draco replied, trying to make it sound airy. Even though the forest shrouded him in protection and Harry was barely anything more than a dream he couldn’t fight the urge to try and be blasé. “I was never sure how they got so bad.” His mouth quirked up at the side, overwhelmed by the sudden urge to spill all his memories. “Used to be too scared to go down there. Any time mother would try and send me down there I’d track down a house elf instead.”
Draco nods, seeming like he actually believes what Harry’s told him. “I hate feeling like there’s nothing I can do.”
He knows he’s being stubborn about Draco, which, all things considered, is the most familiar and comforting part of any of this. He considers whether or not there could be any truth to Dara’s suspicions, but keeps returning to the morning he’d shown up at Draco’s flat and he’d touched Harry’s face with a kindness so disarming that it still makes Harry’s chest constrict to think about it.
“Have to use the loo, be back,” Draco says. Luna smiles and waves him off, taking a dainty sip from the absinthe bottle. Harry is not in the hall directly outside the kitchen and he is not in the living room, weird sitting room, dining room, hallway, or meeting room, so Draco is left with no option but to tentatively take the stairs. He makes it up one flight and is looking around for answers when Harry appears out of a bedroom doorway, looking very flustered.
“Come sit!” A pink haired girl grabs him by the hand, pulling him onto the wood floor next to her with a grin. “I’m Emma by the way.”
“Malfoy getting in trouble is very high on my list of personal interests,” Harry replied loftily. “It brings me joy, like Christmas or chocolates.”
Draco doesn’t answer, but he kisses Harry’s cheeks, the bridge of his nose, the back of his closed eyelids. Harry can feel him shaking, has felt him shaking since the first time they touched.
Draco’s magic curled around him, searching him out and wrapping him up and Harry tried to do the same as he moved his hips to meet Draco’s thrusts, which were quickly growing frantic and quick. He grit his teeth so he wouldn’t moan, desperately rocking against Draco until he felt his orgasm pull over him. He tensed, coming with a broken gasp as Draco thrust against him a few more times before stilling, his lungs heaving.
“I studied in Manhattan for a few years after Hogwarts,” Narcissa says pleasantly, taking a sip from her cup. The set is fine, all delicate gold handles and pretty flowers, but there’s a chip on the side of Narcissa’s dish and he wonders how old all of this is. “They have such a brusque way of casting spells. I think they lose some of the finesse, really.”
“And Hermione,” Harry says, even though that’s probably pushing it. If they’re tempting disaster there’s no point in doing it halfway.
“You both meant the actual moon?” Draco asks, looking up from his cauldron where he’s minding the test potion. “The moon moon?”
“You probably wouldn’t hear anything if it was them, would you?” Harry says. “You don’t still have any sources we could try?”
He looks up when Harry comes in, circles under his eyes like he hasn’t been sleeping again. “Find more things that need fixing?” he asks wanly, adjusting the beanie he’s thrown haphazardly onto his head.
“You could have just cast a Reparo. I thought the record player was a coincidence, lord knows you have no idea how that works. It wouldn’t have worked on the radio, it wasn’t broken, you’re just ridiculous, but you broke this one.” He pauses, purses his lips and gives Harry a searching look. “On purpose.”
The girl at the counter is chipper when they sign out, and Harry promises he’ll back soon as they walk into the front hall, shuffling their feet as they figure out how to say goodbye.
Draco held his hand out and knew the snake would curl around it, hard scaly body sliding against his skin, tender like a caress.
“Hey,” Harry says. He doesn’t seem to know what to do with his hands. Once Draco notices this, it occurs to him that he has no idea what to do with his hands either.
One time, they don’t even take their clothes off. Harry arrives in the empty classroom and Draco is sitting there dead eyed, his legs dangling off the side of the long table. His arms hang down too far, Harry thinks, his mouth is too much like a wound. Harry sits behind him for an hour, his chin on his shoulder, trying to catch his breath.
“Probably. B definitely can,” he says, examining the shards of glass. He seems like he’s about to say something else but pushes it down, and Harry wants to ask but he’s too afraid of the response. “I’m going to take it to the back, it’ll be a few days before it’s be done.”
He felt something inside him deflate and he sat down just on the inside border of the trees, just sitting and watching. The cavern of loneliness opened up wider in his chest and he dropped his head, watching as small green sprouts peeked up to say hello.
He watched the sun slip down beyond the trees and then when the grounds had gone dark, traipsed back up to the Gryffindor tower to do homework in the common room until it was time for his nightly jaunt.
The questioning goes on like this for another two hours, at which point Rob realizes that he has to check his tadpoles, and then they go trouping through the swap after him with continued questions and borrowed wellies. Harry’s have little bumblebees on them and Dara’s are bright pink, and they’re both quite pleased with the situation. Rob explains the taxonomic differences between the Eastern Belching Blue Toad and the Western Belching Blue Toad, goes quite deep into the personal secrets of his esteemed client Mimsy Porpington, and describes his upcoming trip to the Amazon with great relish two separate times. By the time they make it all the way to the bottom of the list, Harry has twenty pages of mostly nonsense notes and is becoming vaguely concerned that where his brain used to be there is only a small toad hopping jovially from side to side.
“Who says I haven’t already told them?” Dara says, pulling up her hood so she looks like she’s peering out of a purple pansy. “See you tomorrow night, champ.”
Draco pursed her lips, her eyes finding something very interesting over by the door. “You don’t happen to remember a conversation that we had during the party, do you?”
“You want to get all of our friends in the same room together?” Harry asks, then realizes that Draco is still looking thoughtful, like he’s actually considering it. “You’re serious?”
“Draco,” Blaise, says, moving a chess piece across the board. It picks up one of Ron’s pawns and bludgeons it against the board with a few performative screams.
“Watch closely,” Draco said, the decoy metal in his hand. Draco slipped it into his mouth. Harry imagined it under his tongue, warming there like a coal. Draco didn’t murmur an incantation. He didn’t go to touch his wand.
“Well you look lovely, it brings out your eyes,” Seamus assured her, kissing her on the cheek before tramping off to find Dean and Ginny, presumably to make sure their matching corsages were all in order.
“Do you think I’m wrong?” Draco lifts a single eyebrow, a move that Harry doesn’t remember him knowing how to do.
Harry almost replied, but was cut off by the return of Draco lips, insistent and warm. Harry felt it again, that tidal wave of something that was more electric than ‘like.’ It made his hands shake again, but unaccompanied by the familiar rattle of anxious nausea. He tried to steady them by holding onto the fabric of Draco’s robes, pulling him closer in the process.
“Oh no,” Harry says, realization dawning on him. “It was the case equivalent of one of Luna’s crossword puzzles. Multiple intelligences.”
Harry leans over the machine, grimacing when he fits the plate in, but the band doesn’t wrap around the pin. “My fingers don’t fit,” he grumbles. lifting it back off and handing it to Draco, who pretends to look sorry for him.
He found himself smiling, wider than he knew he could, sticking his wand back in his pocket and swirling the green water around, taking in the smell of the lake. He wondered about the other smells, thought that the spice and the snow were new, but the roses might have been similar to something in his amortentia.
“You probably think terribly of him, but he was as important to me as Greg was, once,” Draco said. “A lot of things went to shit last year.”
Harry picks Draco up from work the next day, watching him through the window as he fills out a form. He’s smiling about something and bopping his head so his blonde hair flops into his face. He’s wearing one of his too big sweaters and Harry wants to cuddle him so badly. He wonders what Draco’s opinions on cuddling are, if he’d let Harry be the big spoon. He thinks probably not, but it would be worth a try.
“Oh,” Draco said, unsure what to say, remembering that he was supposed to be a mirage, even though he understood. “Why’d you come?”
Anthony just stared at her, looking unsurprised. “You’d think that would be a good thing, considering that you’re enemies.”
At this juncture, Ron has put on the wizard wireless, Pansy keeps finding new things to scream about, and Luna is holding one of Draco’s hands very gently in theirs, telling him something about his aura. Draco is trying very, very hard not to look at Harry. If he looks at Harry, he is terrified he’s going to kiss him again. He has so little self control to begin with and he doesn’t think, slightly absinthy, he will be able to resist.
The overbright lights of the bathroom make all the new tile shine bright and white, everything crystalline and clean, and Draco’s lips feel like the only color in the room. Draco is still fussing in the bag, taking out small pots of things and shoving them back in and Harry has the suspicion he’s making a production of out of ignoring him.
The next morning he didn’t wake, merely put his book down and crawled from behind his curtains when he heard Blaise rusting outside.
‘Everything’ weighed heavy in the forest air, pulled the boughs of the trees down and made the air sink until it was heavy, until the forest itself was pulled in the direction of that word.
“Oh.” Harry thinks briefly about just taking the bag from the sink and doing it himself, but the urge passes and he nods, turning to go with his hands shoved deep in his pockets. He’s at the door when Draco clears his throat, quiet and short.
“Cheers,” Harry says, raising his cup of coffee in the direction of Draco’s teacup. Harry looks down at the tablecloth, where the wolf in Calypso’s arms turns to stare at the camera over and over, her grin not quite sane enough for his liking. “Where did you get these pictures? Did you just have them lying around?”
He sneaks a glance at the man walking next to him, noticing the way he tugs his jumper sleeves down over his hands and the shiftiness to his movements. Years ago, he would have labeled the behavior as highly suspicious, but it only reads as anxious now.
“Not if you strangled me first,” Draco says, and there’s something in his eyes that Harry can’t place. He thinks Draco might feel the same thing he does, a soft ghost of things that never were, that specter that whispers that maybe they need each other now, that they’re the only ones left who understand.
“I said getting along, I didn’t say friends,” Harry said, feeling triumphant. “Unless you want to be friends.”
“Terrified,” the snake said, beginning a slow loop around him. “You’re terrified. That’s the real reason you can’t sleep, isn’t it? You’ve become afraid of all the dark.”
39. In the Wizengamot one afternoon, Hermione breaks down in tears. There are muggleborns that never returned to the wizarding world after the war and so many people don’t think that that’s a problem, certainly not one they should waste resources on. Harry hasn’t been following it very closely. He finds all of this easier if he doesn’t get emotionally invested, if he doesn’t hope except when Hermione brings home a few bottles of wine and tells him there’s something to celebrate.
Draco’s breath on his cheek, the smell of his aftershave and the clean smell of his skin, his body curled around Harry’s like he was trying to become him. Harry thought of the emptiness that used to follow him around like a cloud, the one that seemed to eat away at any desire but couldn’t touch this one, couldn’t begin to erode at how much he wanted them to consume each other.
The forest seemed to be laughing, something in the nighttime sway of the leaves almost like amusement as the mirage of Draco pulled him somewhere deep within the trees. He thought about pulling away and trying to find his way back alone, but considered that maybe Draco was taking him to their goodbye. He wanted to leave but Draco’s hand felt real as it always had around his forearm and he couldn’t, deluding himself to the last.
Her pout deepened and she leaned up against him to try and offer comfort. “But you’re sleeping again.”
He’d fussed with spells he half remembered but the bruise hadn’t faded even the smallest bit. It wasn’t like he could go around asking for help. Telling his friends he’d been off snogging hallucinations in the woods wouldn’t convince them of his sanity.
Harry remembered the night their magic had spilled out of them and intertwined, the sensation of being overwhelmed and tangled up in Draco. The sensation of sinking into the essence of him, of being held so desperately. “Your magic felt so wild I thought you were just an extension of the forest.”
“Its spinning too slowly,” Harry says, noting the way everything Malfoy does is quieter than he ever remembers him being. Still so regal, but more understated now, like all his fire has faded to embers. Harry almost wishes for that spark back, for the return of the drawl that used to ring so loud in Harry’s memories.
“We have to try again,” Harry says, and even getting the words out is a chore. He’d walked in with vague apprehension and now he feels like he might disintegrate, but it’s not like he has a choice.
“We’re figuring out who is the best kisser and Hermione and I both said Harry,” Pansy says, which makes Ginny give Hermione an appraising look.
“So you’d rather I’d just left you to die?!” Harry yelled, knowing that she was poking at old wounds even as she did so. Here she was, letting Draco drag her back into a feud they’d been feeding since they were eleven.
“Draco?” Harry asked the wood, terror coppery in his mouth. He was ashamed of the fear in his voice, ashamed of the tremor of it. The trees shifted and shimmered in the breeze, the night folded over itself.
She opens the door and when she sees him holding her breakfast, her face crumples. She sets the bowl on top of a stack of towels and hugs him in the desperate way that sobbing people do. She’s the only one who can do that without him wanting to slough his skin off and he thinks it must be because they have so much practice.
“Not likely,” Draco said bitterly. A hippogriff would probably have a better chance with Harry than he did.
“Put makeup on me?” Harry glances at Draco’s lips and his hand and the unreadable shine of his gray eyes. “I’ve never done it before.”
“Hello,” Draco says, after a pause that’s had time to sit and fester. He seems inconceivably distant and Harry doesn’t want him crawling around in his mind, doesn’t want to crawl around in his. From here, it seems impossible that he could ever look into Draco’s memories and see anything other than the tight set of his lips and his white knuckles.
He finds a tv at the same secondhand shop, one of the big, old ones that he has to struggle to carry, and when he gets it home he breaks the screen in with a hammer. It’s almost therapeutic, smashing the glass until it’s shattered and all over his kitchen floor. He sweeps the refuse into a pile, waters the houseplants on his windowsill, pulls on a scarlet jumper, and heads out.
“I’m very familiar with that hex,” Harry says, remembering fondly when Ron had tried to cast it on Draco, who had quite deserved it. Ron had ended up vomiting slugs, but that was besides the point. “You should know how to defend yourself.”
“I’ve always thought it was so cool when girls did that,” Harry says, feeling like he needs to say something, hoping it’s okay, no longer sure what they are and aren’t allowed to do in the unwritten rules they’re following.
“I know,” Ron replied. “All you can really do.” Harry could feel the affection in his voice thick as the air in the forest, the quiet camaraderie that still tied them close. “Wanna go do something?”
“You aren’t balls at anything, Harry,” Luna says, seeming to pull from their well of patience as they come over to walk their fingers gently up his arm. Their hands are stained berry red and their hair is up in a wildly printed scarf and they’re ethereally comforting.
Draco nods. “We communicated with bouquets during the war. Mother thought we had a courtship, that was quite a surprise for her.” He pauses, sticking his hands in his pockets. “Begonias still make me feel ill.”
“That’s the worst thing you’ve ever said to me, thank you so much,” Harry says, remembering for context that Dara has saved his life multiple times and is probably smarter and more talented than most of the department. “I’m worried this case is hitting a dead end,” he says. “Rob hasn’t gotten back to me for questions, Hermione wants me to do more research for motives, but none of my research is turning anything up and we don’t have that much longer before the next full moon.”
“Of course I do, you fucking idiot,” Draco replies, looking put out about the whole thing. “You’re impossible not to like, it’s infuriating.”
It’s so late and I’m so tired but I don’t want to say goodbye to the moon yet. When I was little, mother used to say that my ancestors were looking down on me, since all the Blacks are named after the stars. I’m sure you’re familiar, Sirius was your Godfather. He’s always easy to find up there. Did you know that Draco is circumpolar? You probably don’t, you never paid attention in Astronomy. That means that it never sets, at least if you’re in the Northern Hemisphere. What I’m saying is that I would appreciate it if you went out and found me, but you’re under no obligation to.
“So you’re the Golden Boy who can do anything and I’m what, the bottom feeder you got partnered with? And together we make one full human being?” Draco asks scathingly.
“Wasn’t about them being muggles,” Harry said levelly, almost like he knew what Draco was trying to do. “Not sure you’d understand, your parents loved you.”
After the bands finish playing the party starts to disintegrate, and it’s a few hours later when Draco stumbles a little when he moves and kisses the cheeks of every new person he sees. Harry’s been watching him drink with an eerie deliberateness, and even though Harry’s pleasantly buzzed, he hasn’t tried to match him. He’d ask about it, but it’s not his place, because Draco is his friend and isn’t. It’s a strange line and he doesn’t know where they fall on it.
“If you’d like, you can watch us work for a bit and then decide if you want to help?” Luna offered, letting Draco’s hand fall and taking Greg’s.
“Sure thing,” Dara says, then Disapparates with a crack that reverberates through the empty street. At the sound, Draco stirs but still doesn’t wake.
Sunday, after sleeping in until one and running down to the Great Hall to catch the last ten minutes of breakfast, Harry helped Ron set up the library wide scavenger hunt she was using to ask Hermione to the Yule Ball.
“Right,” Harry said, quirking up an eyebrow like he knew that most of his attitude was a front. “How far did you get?”
Harry lay down on the forest floor and stared up at the canopy, listening to Draco’s breathing beside him as he did the same.
Harry tastes very absinthy, which he hadn’t before, and is pressing his entire body against Draco’s, holding him quite forcefully against the wall. It’s a very Gryffindor way to kiss someone, so much like he’s trying to do it the most and the best he possibly can.
“I’ll let Dara know, hopefully it’s a coincidence or we can weasel some information out of her,” Harry says. Draco is listening to him, but fiddling absently with his quill like part of his mind is still caught elsewhere. “We’re still trying to get information on Rob, no leads yet. I’d been meaning to ask you, when you have your suppliers make deliveries, do you pick those up, or does Jasmine?”
“Truly, just walks,” Draco replies, trying to level his glare. The number of intense eye-conversations in his life were beginning to become emotionally taxing. “I don’t know, maybe I’m just getting better.”
“Hello everyone,” McGonagall’s voice rang out across the Great Hall as she took her place at the podium, the sleeves of her dress robes glimmering sky blue in the light. “If you would take your seats at any one of the tables, dinner will be served shortly.”
“This is fun. You’ve been so cordial lately, I don’t even know what to do with you,” Draco said, watching Harry flounder. He wondered if he could convince the forest to make this mirage more often, it was even better than the snakes.
“Just be careful. With him and with you.” She smiles at him, a stray curl sneaking out of her ponytail like it has a mind of his own. She’s grown up so much since they left school, all of the energy she used to put into bossing them around going straight into her job. He can still see all the insecurities that barely bother her anymore and is sure she can see the same in him, which is just as comforting as it is terrifying.
Harry thinks back to the night before the kiss, watching Draco smile and tease everyone, thinks about how it takes a while to understand when he’s joking because he wears his attitude like a shield but his real humor is quiet and how he dances sometimes when people aren’t watching. Harry wonders if he asked nicely, if Draco would dance with him. “Yeah.”
“Actually I was thinking that I could be with Ernie!” Harry said, as if McGonagall had somehow misunderstood. She had the overwhelming feeling that she had not.
“Do you want to come for me?” Draco asks, and Harry nods desperately, nose bumping against Draco’s. “Ask nicely.”
“Not even Parkinson? Zabini? Goyle?” Harry almost asks about Crabbe, but then remembers with a jolt.
“She just likes to put them through the wringer to prove they aren’t just in it for her money. It’s mostly an act,” Draco says, losing some of his affected tone. Harry wonders how much of what Draco did and does is an act, and thinks with a dip in his stomach of how his eyes sparkle when he’s being earnest. “But I’m very intimidating.”
When Harry comes back a few days later, there’s a woman standing near the counter who doesn’t look like she belongs there. She’s wearing shiny little heels and her hair is neatly cropped, and by the time Harry realizes who she is, it’s too late to leave.
Draco didn’t meet his eyes that morning either and Harry would have exploded if he wouldn’t have had to explain the destruction later. As it was, he very deliberately joined back into the discussion on Gryffindor’s quidditch prospects. Ginny was telling them quite animatedly that their seeker was ‘almost in Harry territory’ as Ron scoffed in disbelief.
Harry didn’t get the full lesson on fiber art until she descended the North Staircase Saturday morning to find that it had inexplicably grown a small army of multicolored yarn pieces.
“It’s fine,” Ernie said, looking as if he’d recently dropped an ice cream cone scoop-down. “Thanks anyway.”
Draco stirred against him, cuddling closer to his body and Harry felt a sharp rush of guilt that almost read as pain. “I can feel your heartbeat,” Draco said, and it sounded more mildly concerned that anything else. He voice was stretched out and languid, stripped down in that moment. “You’re shaking.”
“But it won’t work,” Ron adds, delivering the coup de grace. “Because Hermione Granger-Weasley is, as we speak, eviscerating him in front of the whole council and he’s going to lose his nasty little job and probably go to evil wizard jail. Azkaban. Evil wizard jail is just Azkaban.”
Harry watched her hands as they flew in front of her face, and tried not to think the word irreparable. He remembered Luna telling him that she didn’t ever want to be in a romantic relationship and wondered if maybe that’s what this feeling was. And yet, that didn’t quite ring true to him. It wasn’t that he didn’t want one, he wanted someone so badly it made his chest contract, he just couldn’t drum up feelings for anyone other than a fucking mirage.
Dara and Harry meet Rob Spreckleroy in what can only be described as a swamp. Dara still has the healing remains of an impressive burn curling down her neck, but she looks remarkably well rested as they take the swaying bridge across a clearwater stream to Rob’s lopsided little cottage.
Draco is telling a laughing Ellen that she’s the best thing ever when she leans over and whispers to Harry. “Can you make sure he gets home alright?”
“She is put together,” Draco replies, and Harry knows there’s something under that but he doesn’t think Draco is going to let him see it. “Your tv is fixed.”
Draco sniffs. He’s doing a fair approximation of dignity for someone who is covered in dirt and scrapes, which Harry considers to be one of Draco’s special talents. Harry recalls that he’d even looked rather dignified with Harry’s cock in his mouth, which couldn’t be less of a helpful thought, all things considered.
” Harry says, around a mouthful of food. He’s still concerned that Draco is kind of making fun of him, but something about the way he says it feels sincere.
“Oh,” Harry replies, knowing even as he tries to calmly take another bite of donut that he’s turned bright red. “Yeah, that’s part of the problem.”
Draco tucked his book under his arm and followed as far behind the snake as he could. He was lead through the parting branches, only the odd night light of the forest to guide his way.
“That was a long time ago and he deserved it,” Hermione replies primly, tying her hair back so it stops falling in her face. “The war was hard on everyone, you know he and his family lost everything.”
Blaise perked a bit at the compliment, before becoming serious once more. “I wouldn’t tell if it was like, really bad, you know.”
Harry nods, sets his tea on the floor, and sits patiently like he does for the Healers. He feels overexposed even though he invited himself into this position, a situation that feels rapidly like its about to roll off the tracks. Draco is so close to him, examining the gouge on his face with a serious expression. Harry notices the shape of Draco’s nose, how it’s actually kind of large, as noses go, but how it makes sense on his face, with how sharp his jaw is and how high his cheekbones are. It’s all Harry can do to breathe.
“Well what I saw during their match with Ravenclaw was all waiting around and no acting,” Harry replied. “They never put the pressure on, sometimes I’m not sure if I’m watching a Quidditch game or a casual garden broom ride.”
Harry nods along, taking a sip from his cup as she continues her story, and the rest of tea goes much the same. Narcissa is fascinating, warm and shimmering in the cottage with too much furniture and the finest, chipped china. When they finally apparate back, after Narcissa gives them both a goodbye kiss on the cheek, Draco lets out a sigh like he’s been holding it for ages and he slides onto the kitchen counter still in his dress robes.
In the center of the clearing lay Harry, his glasses askew on his face and his hair even more of a mess than usual, laying in a bed of fallen leaves and flower petals.
“Malfoy,” he said, finally meeting his eyes. His stomach dipped at the contact. Malfoy’s eyes were just as gray and intense as they had been in the forest. Somehow he hadn’t expected real Malfoy to look exactly like his mirage, with that same pointed nose and careful set to his bones, like he was always posing for something. Harry hadn’t counted on the gut wrenching feeling of want returning, even outside of the darkness of night. Malfoy was still gorgeous, still infuriating, and Harry wanted so desperately to kiss him.
“Thanks,” he says, sitting down on their fuzzy duvet and curling up into fetal position, letting his shoes fall to the floor so he doesn’t get dirt on their bed.
“What have you been drinking?” Harry asks, narrowing his eyes at Draco, who looks deceptively innocent.
“Could be much worse,” Draco said, attempting to remain aloof even when Harry started to fuss with his ridiculous hair.
“Are you seducing me?” He asked the forest with a carefully raised eyebrow. He thought he felt the forest laughing, and she was.
It was only because she could see into all the mysteriously labeled boxes inside him that she knew he was scared too.
“Still fantastic,” Harry says, shoveling the last few bites of potato into his mouth before Lee can take his plate away.
“Yes,” Harry says, collapsing into the chair. He watches Draco move around the kitchen, turning the faucet on and off, pouring the tea, moving plates around. Draco drops two neat sugar cubes into Harry’s cup, bringing it over to him.
“I’m sure we’ll meet them when you’re ready,” Hermione said, laying off on her pressuring for the moment.
Draco shakes his head, turning to look at him. Harry feels like he’s been cornered and doesn’t know how to leave. “There, that’s exactly what I mean. You devalue it and that’s completely ridiculous because you do so much good? Volunteering at hospitals and helping kids cast spells is incredible.”
“I’m dreadfully upset with you,” he finally decided was an appropriate response. “And I think you’re awful and cruel and full of yourself.” But I think I missed talking to you and I was only mean to you last time because that’s the only way I’ve ever really talked to you. We could try something different, if you wanted. Draco swallowed the unspoken part down with peach juice.
“My mum died when I was a baby,” Luna says. They speak so slowly, each word a new continent. “But it was senseless. Anyway, Draco might think the only good thing he can do is risk his life, but don’t you think that too? Didn’t you?”
“Yes?” Harry asks. Draco nods. “Great,” Harry says, and then pushes Draco back against Grimmauld Place’s very green wallpaper and kisses him.
Harry feels a queasy sensation of knowing more than he should and it only makes him more curious. He knows he doesn’t need any of this information but he wants it, and he doesn’t want to think about why.
“Potter’s new girlfriend?” Pansy said, looking a bit wary but letting him take the conversation back to familiar ground.
“She really said no?” Draco asked, feeling as if he should have been more shocked by this piece of information. Certain things were having trouble making contact, and all he could think about was how Harry would react to Draco asking him out. Just the thought of it made him vaguely nauseous, though he knew Harry would just think it was a joke, that he was making fun of him. Maybe he’d figure out that Draco meant it and do that awful pity thing he did so well, stammering as he backed away with his friends.
Ron quirked a grin at him, shoving his shoes on. “Love that girl to death,” he said, a flush creeping over his already pink cheeks.
“Well you were!” Hermione replied, spearing her sausage and putting on a bit of a show of being indignant.
“I barely tapped it,” Harry said, still smiling. Draco looked vaguely upset with him and he was still clutching his book protectively to his chest. Harry wondered at the thickness of his shell, at the thought that maybe Draco truly didn’t want anything to do with him. “It’s getting chilly out.”
“I mean obviously it’s not every pureblood,” Harry concedes. “I’m sure there are complicated politics behind it that only Hermione understands, but this isn’t the only example. Like, why freak out about Professor Lupin but then let Fenrir Greyback just do whatever he wants?”
Draco does wish that Pansy would avoid calling him a cocksucker in polite company, but then would have to admit that he considers this polite company. Considering that the last time they’d gotten together, Millicent had shared the entire tale of the time she got on the wrong end of a vomiting jinx and tried to convince the hot St. Mungo’s Healer to take her on a date while actively hurling, he doesn’t think it really counts.
He’d hoped that if he stayed away he’d be able to convince himself that the kiss had been something other than fantastic, but he had the sneaking suspicion that as he got more sleep deprived he only became less rational and more tangled up in memories of Harry.
“You’re both philistines,” she says. She’s wearing an eclectic combination of wizarding robes and Muggle accessories in a variety of colors which seem to be coordinated with her eyeshadow. Harry had been expecting her to be way more uptight given that she’s going to be a prefect, but she reminds him of a whip-smart, black Lavender Brown so, in short, entirely too small and powerful.
Harry pulls him to a stop, pressing a kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Hope you don’t treat all your least favorite people like this.”
The water drew up over his knees as he walked through the shimmering lake and past the softly phosphorescent trees. The mangroves created twisting and winding canals for him to follow, leading him deeper and deeper inside.
“Accidents happen,” Harry replies with a shrug, and Malfoy looks for a moment like he might laugh again. “Can you fix it?”
She stared at him in that piercing way she had, her dark eyes glinting in the phosphorescence of the forest as she fit all the pieces together. “You’re here for Harry.”
“You think so?” Luna asks, spooning a bit of the sugary jelly foam off the top of their jelly pot. They’re easily the scariest thing he’s ever seen in an apron, sans maybe Molly Weasley on a holiday.
Draco nods reluctantly. “Losing my vital organs would be more of an indignity than one more side-along with you.”
“I suppose so,” Draco agrees. He knows that all things considered, there is a very high probability that the next time Pansy sees him she is going to scream at the top of her lungs, and that there is no small chance that that will happen tomorrow at the breakfast table. He thinks that after eight hours asleep in Harry’s arms, he’s prepared to have a sense of humor about it.
“Okay, you wait in the kitchen, I’m going to get dressed,” Harry says, throwing off the blankets and picking up yesterday’s clothes from the floor, slipping into his bedroom in only his boxers, and scowling as Ron snickers at him.
59. Draco ties Harry’s wrists back with the handkerchief and kisses him until Harry is a mess of sound and breathing. Harry wants everything to feel like relief. He’s worried this is the closest he’ll ever come, but doesn’t think he can complain.
His mind spun in circles. If the forest made up Draco, that could mean that she was trying to coax him into feeling things again. If she made Draco up from real Draco’s image, it might mean that real Draco wanted to kiss him. Very unlikely. If she’d made him up from Harry’s head, then maybe Harry had always wanted Draco to kiss him. Horrifying. Confusing.
He hadn’t picked at his fingernails until he’d needed something to do with his hands, and he hadn’t needed something to do with his hands until they’d started shaking without any conceivable explanation.
Harry shakes his head. He’s lonely, and he’s known for a long time that he is, but thought it was okay, like how Petunia would always have the telly on, how he stopped noticing the background noise until the rare moments that it turned off. “No, not really.”
“Not that my romantic entanglements are any of your business...” Draco replies, eyebrows high on his forehead. Harry feels a little like he’s been chastised, but it doesn’t sting so he doesn’t mind. “But no. No proper boyfriends.”
Draco pointed wordlessly to the blackboard, which read: ‘work on your dancing until eight thirty, at which time you will be free to go. - Headmistress McGonagall.’
“I’ll share,” Harry says, pulling Draco under the water and kissing him, sliding his hands up Draco’s slick chest, over the all of the scars there. Draco makes a vulnerable noise into Harry’s mouth when he’s touched and leans into him as Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s shoulders.
“You do an awful lot of worrying,” Draco says, leaning down so their foreheads are pressed together and Harry can’t bring himself to pull away. Draco’s staring at him with those quiet gray eyes and he feels like nothing has ever mattered more than this.
“You need practice,” Luna counters. “It’s scary when people sift around in your head. You remember things you’ve forgotten. You remember things you don’t want to remember and then you have to live with the fact that someone else knows them too. It’s not easy, it’s really difficult both magically and emotionally.”
“About what?” Harry asked, screwing up her nose. “‘Oh hi Draco, it’s Harry, I was just wondering why you stopped trying to punch me in the face?’”
“Of course I have, you knob.” Draco hissed. “Weren’t expecting that when you told me to kill myself, did you? Bet that guilt feels terrible.”
The pause pulled and stretched between them, thick like the air and incomprehensibly heavy. Draco had nothing to say to him so he pulled his hand away extra slow, replacing his thumb with the soft pressure of his mouth because if he knew anything it was that if you were kissing you didn’t have to talk.
“Did I do something wrong?” Draco asks, eyes going concerned. He pets at Harry’s hair with one of his hands and it’s soothing and gentle and Harry wants all of this. “I won’t do it if you don’t want me to, it’s okay.” It’s worse, because this side of Draco is soft and caring and wants to make sure he’s okay, and he doesn’t ever want to lose it.
Draco was so completely affronted that she pulled their dancing to a complete halt. “You’d think by now you would have picked up some manners,” Draco hissed. “Greg’s my friend and we’re going to the Yule Ball together because we’re friends and my sexuality isn’t any of your business!” She wrenched herself very dramatically out of the waltz hold. “I’m getting a drink!”
“Oh for Salazar’s sake, Potter,” Draco says, looking unmoored in the dining room. “This is a disaster already and you’ve made it worse.”
After sipping his way through two cups of coffee and shoving down two slices of buttered toast, Draco made his way to the library with homework in mind. He truly tried to do work, but found himself browsing the few books about the Forbidden Forest the library had available.
The street is quiet in the early November gloom and Harry wonders if this is the universe’s way of telling him to turn around and go home.
“Do you think that everyone who dies, dies for a reason?” Luna asks, and doesn’t wait for Harry to answer. “I suppose you would, that’s such a part of your personal myth. No one’s death serves any purpose, Harry. It’s no different than pulling Death in Tarot, as likely or unlikely as pulling an ace…” they trail off, their elbow on their desk and their editing forgotten.
Lee zips back to the kitchen, leaving them in a silence that feels like it could turn into anything.
Harry lets him go, watching as he spells off the makeup with a careful flick of his wrist. “Would you like me to do you?”
Harry was silent, listening as her breath fogged up the glass, muffled music creeping down from the Great Hall. It felt almost like an honor, Draco telling her stories of before, like she was giving Harry a part of herself wrapped in pretty Christmas paper.
