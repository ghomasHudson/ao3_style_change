Draco would admit it did look a bit suspicious that he came in with blood soaked into his clothes. He also had quite a reputation for hating Harry.
(yes yes it's over you're all welcome)
"Alright calm down dad" Harry chuckled and walked back into Draco's bedroom. He placed his belongings on Draco's bed side table. "I much prefer daddy" Draco smirked and followed Harry.
Draco watched him do so. "Like what you see?" Harry smirked and did a full spin. "Hell yes" Draco smirked as well.
"We have someone who needs to be thanked for saving our chosen one, for saving all of us" Dumbledore said and smiled warmly. Draco felt his heart stop, he hoped he wouldn't be the one Dumbledore chose to give some long boring speech.
Harry could not stand to be alone. He also could not stand to meet new people. It was a constant internal battle within Harry. Meet new people, or be alone. He could never decide
They both scowled at the same time, clearly both annoyed at the utter shit Dumbledore was speaking. "But maybe this will be an opportunity for a new friendship...Now I've already had house elves take your things to your new dorm." Dumbledore pulled a lemon drop out of a bowl next to him and popped it into his mouth.
"Two times?" Harry said looking up at him curiously. "What with me ending up in your room somehow?" Harry said rolling his eyes. Draco thanked Merlin Harry was stupid enough to not see through Draco's lies. Draco had remembered by that point that it was himself who had brought Harry in there. Draco just stood there. "Well then are you done interrupting my beauty sleep?" Draco crossed his arms. "Yes I am, I apologize for not putting a silencing charm on the door" Harry said softly.
"Snape hates me" Harry said. "Doesn't matter he won't if I tell him not to, now come on" Draco grabbed Harry's shoes and his own. He gave Harry his shoes and put his on. "Are you sure about this because..." Harry faltered. "Yes now come on" Draco walked into the hallway, Harry following. They walked to Snape's classroom. Harry was nervous, Snape hated him with a passion.
Hogwarts was his escape from all of that ugliness in his so called home. Harry was forever grateful for his home away from home and the people who befriended him. The people who befriended him became his family. They were more of a family than his had ever been, that's for sure.
"you don't like being late" Harry replied. He felt Draco shrug, "I won't be late" He slowly licked a circle on Harry's neck. Harry grabbed Draco's arms. Draco slowly started sucking, lightly brushing his teeth against the sensitive spot. Harry tilted his head back and rested it on Draco's shoulder.
"What did I say about that formal garbage? Call me Narcissa" She pulled away from the hug and smiled. "We were actually just talking about you Harry" Snape cut in.
Draco dragged his fingers along the collar of Harry shirt and removed his tie as well. Slowly slipping it through his fingers. Draco removed Harry's robe slowly, taking as much time as he could. Harry whined slightly, Draco was taking too long.
"What? A bet? With who, about what?" Harry scrunched up his nose. "Yes Potter a bet, with a person, about you and Draco" She smiled.
"For all those years I convinced myself I hated you, but it's like from the day I turned down your handshake I knew there was something so intriguing about you" Harry said. Harry shook his head chuckling. "I couldn't shake the thought of you for the rest of that night, well for the rest of the year"
Draco slowly rubbed his thumb along the backside of Harry's hand. Harry's cheeks turned a slight shade of red as he felt it. Draco smiled and pulled his hand away slowly. Harry was at a loss for words. He didn't know what to say, or how to say anything. Draco let himself fall into Harry's eyes.
Barty smirked. "Hon, this is going to be our biggest accomplishment yet." He said. Bellatrix turned around to face him. "I couldn't be more excited" She said with a devilish smirk on her face.
Draco ran over to Harry's body. Harry was writhing in pain, everything hurt. Harry could feel his warm blood soaking his clothes. "Dray" Harry gulped.
As much as he enjoyed watching Harry trip over his own feet he would much rather watch Harry's eyes. Harry looked up at Draco and locked eyes with him immediately. "Just let your body move to the music" Draco spoke softly. Harry nodded and by the grace of some miracle started dancing correctly. "Look you're a natural" Draco chuckled. "Thank you sir" Harry smiled.
Harry and Ron were laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Hermione was trying to ignore it, but she was laughing to herself. This whole dinner was a completely fun mess. "It's a valid question" Blaise said smirking.
Draco smiled a small smile and sat down on Harry's bed. Hermione and Ron sat at the end of the bed while Draco sat up by the top with Harry. Draco dug into his food. It was really very good. Hermione and Ron talked to Harry about classes and what he's missed. Harry would laugh, or smile whenever they spoke. He would respond like everything in his life was fine. Like he hadn't just cried, like his wrists were clean, like his body was blank. No bruises. It hurt Draco to see how easy it was for Harry to fake.
Class had started. Harry looked back at Draco, his smile faltered when he saw Blaise take a seat next to Draco. Draco's face fell as well.
Harry walked in and Professor Flitwick was inspecting the students tables. Harry took a seat alone in the back, he didn't really feel like being bothered. He pulled out his wand preparing for the class.
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind"
His heart felt heavy, he began feeling nauseous. "Are you alright what does it say?" Harry asked peeking over Draco's hands to see it. Draco folded it up quickly and put it back in the envelope.
"Alright Dray if you say so" They finally reached the tower and cheated a tiny bit to reach the top. Draco made sure no one was around then used a spell to transport them to the top. Harry laughed when they got to the top.  They cheated their way there and it worked.
Harry drifted off to sleep.
Harry turned on his side and saw Draco laying there. Well someone he assumed was Draco from the platinum blonde hair. How in hell did Harry end up in there? Harry yawned quietly and got out of Draco's bed slowly. The cold floor under Harry's feet caused a shiver to shoot up his spine.
It took Draco 64 steps to reach it.
"Bathroom" Ron continued to look. Draco's heart sunk. Draco sighed and walked over to the bathroom. He hoped Harry wasn't in there but with his luck, he probably was. Draco pushed the door aside. He saw Harry looking small and helpless. Just standing there staring down at the parchment, an envelope in his other hand. Draco's heart fell even further and a lump formed in his throat. "you were just gonna...gonna not tell me, not let me know any of this" Harry said, his voice rising towards the end.
"If you want him you have to get through me!" Draco yelled at her and threw spells at her like a madman. Harry did the same. "I'm okay with killing you and him hon." Bellatrix giggled.
Draco felt tears well up in his eyes. He had to end things with Harry in order to keep him alive. Draco knew his father had sources at the school, but he never thought he would escape.
"I want to properly court you, I want to hold your hand in the hallways, I want to be able to call you love in public, I want to show you that you are worthy of love. I want to show I'm not scared or embarrassed to be with you. After I almost lost you I realized there's not time for all of this hiding. I love you and I'm okay with everyone knowing if you are" Draco said all in one breath.
Draco looked up and was speechless. "wow" Draco said under his breath. Harry felt a slight blush creep up onto his cheeks. Draco got up and walked over to Harry. He wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and kissed him. Harry smiled and kissed back.
"Care to explain?" Ron said following at her heels. "Well I think it's not 'all of a sudden' seems like it's been brewing for a while. I think they like each other." Hermione smirked. Ron stopped dead in his tracks. "What?" Hermione glanced back at him. "Come on it makes total sense Ron" Hermione continued walking to the library.
If Harry had been listening, he would've heard what Snape said which is just common knowledge. Amorentia smells like whoever you desire the most, someone you love.
Harry awoke at around ten, he had been jittery all night. Excitement pumping through his veins. Harry was genuinely excited about Christmas this year. Amazing family, gifts, Draco. Everything was perfect, absolutely perfect.
Harry sniffled and wiped his eyes. "I'm sorry" Harry said softly and tried to blink back the rest of his tears that were trying to fall down his face. "Don't apologize to me." Draco said. Harry thought he was angry. Harry heard what sounded like edgy coldness in Draco's voice, he might've been imagining it or it was really how he said it.
Draco noticed whenever Harry felt he would be rejected or in trouble his voice softened. He was so delicate and fragile. Harry turned into a little mouse when it came to being confrontational. It made Draco's heart skip a beat. Frankly Harry being shy was adorable.
"Hurry up love Im cold" Harry snuggled up under the covers.  "So needy today darling, give me a second" Draco wrote the same thing on all three pieces of parchment.
"Harry" His little cousin nodded towards him. Harry looked around, his nasty uncle was no where to be seen. "Sit down" His aunt motioned towards the old dusty couch. Harry took a seat and placed his hands in his lap. "I needed you back here to explain some things." His aunt said and sat down on the other end of the couch. Harry tensed up and watched her. "I refuse to continue getting anonymous letters from people at your school telling me you're gay." Harry's heart fell to his stomach. Who in bloody hell would've told them.
"We can pick this up later?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry smirked and walked out of the room. Draco followed him downstairs.
Draco took a few deep breaths and stood up steadily. He opened the bathroom door to find Harry sitting on the couch struggling to get his shoe on. Draco wanted to help him, but he restrained himself.
Harry looked over to his open door. "Were you sleeping in my room?" Harry chuckled and turned his head back to Draco. "Maybe" Draco smirked.
"Fix my hair" Draco smiled and sat down. All three of them got to work on separate last minute things.
Harry watched the portrait close. He shook his head and started walking back to his quarters. Harry was looking down at his map when he saw footsteps coming towards him. Before he could read who it was he bumped into someone.
Blaise chuckled and said his goodbyes. Him and Neville exited the room, they could hear the two of them say farewell to Narcissa.
Harry whimpered because Draco hadn't touched him yet. Draco took the hint and wrapped his hand around Harry's shaft. Harry arched his back and squeezed his eyes shut, grasping onto the silk sheets roughly. Draco slowly began pumping his hand, sucking on Harry's earlobe and neck while doing so. Harry moaned out, and grabbed onto Draco's shoulders.
Everyone already knew he was gay because Blaise decided to out him. Blaise did it simply because he was angry Draco had broken things off. But then again. It was Harry Potter, the golden boy. Draco would just be rejected.
"The Gryffindor emblem on the door duh" Hermione said back.
They made it back to the dorm finally after what felt like ages of walking. Harry flopped down onto the soft couch and rubbed his head. "You alright?" Draco toed his shoes off. Harry nodded and held his stomach. Draco furrowed his eyebrows and took Harry's shoes off for him. "What's wrong?" Draco sat on the couch laying Harry's head down in his lap.
Harry unwrapped it, a piece of paper. Harry tilted his head a bit, sort of confused. He opened up the paper. Harry read over the words and basically attacked Draco with a big bear hug. Draco fell over with Harry holding him. Harry was in tears, happy tears.
Harry plopped down on his bed, he was unaware he could just flip his switch from happy to angry so fast. Harry stated up at his ceiling. Draco could never care about Harry, Draco would never care about Harry. Harry may have been overreacting, he was angry over Draco not telling him about a dream, a silly dream. Draco hated him Harry thought. Harry was an idiot for trying to get close to Draco. Once Harry started feeling any kind of good Voldemort was back in his head. Harry didn't mind Voldie in his head. Although he did mind Voldemort talking about Draco.
Harry nodded, re-assuring Draco it was okay. "Harry I'm so sorry, what I did was evil and cruel. I'm not like that I promise. I would never do anything to hurt anyone intentionally. I was just so jealous of you" Blaise and Draco were stood right next to each other. "that's a load of bullshit" Draco mumbled.
Draco and Harry both sat breathless. Harry between Draco's legs, plump lips, ruffled hair, and flushed cheeks. Draco staring down at Harry with stars in his eyes. Draco smirked and ran a hand through Harry's hair. Harry looked up at him smiling. "Was it ok?" Harry stared up at him sheepishly.
Draco sighed a happy sigh and continued to read. Harry did the same. They read for what felt like hours. Draco would occasionally underline sentences he liked. Those little things made Harry smile. One specific line stood out to Harry the most.
"Let me see him." Draco said angrily. "I need to know you didn't hurt him as you claim you haven't" Draco gritted his teeth. "Okay go right ahead Draco. He's right through there, the dungeons" Lucius' smirk never once left his face.
Harry knew Draco wasn't straight. That always sparked some sort of odd interest in Harry's soul. Draco's ex boyfriend, Blaise had outed him. Harry had always had a thing for Draco, whether or not he convinced himself it was hatred it was still there. Harry always hurt the ones he loved in some way. Whether or not it was intentional, they ended up hurt emotionally, physically, or dead. Harry was doomed to be alone for his lifetime.
Draco's brain started working and his heart rate sped up. Could Harry be gay? Did he have chance? "But people really think we did?" Harry said cuddling back under the blankets. "That might be a tad bit my fault Potter" Draco chuckled and Harry fumed. "Fuck you Malfoy." Harry spat at him "Jeez Potter at least ask me to dinner first" Draco chuckled and continued on "I feel so very honored to know the dirty truth on Mr. Harry Potter, he doesn't like girls" Draco smirked and also got back under the covers. Draco was trying to get more information out of Harry.
Harry and Draco came inside on cloud nine, they had planned a future together.  A beautiful everlasting future of pure bliss. For an hour or two they lounged around the living room of their suite in the Manor.
He wrapped a towel around his waist and went to grab his clothes which were now missing. Bollocks, the house elves always cleaning something they shouldn't be. He sighed and kept the towel wrapped around his waist. Harry unlocked the door and walked out. He was on his way to his room when he stopped dead in his tracks to see the blonde staring at him from the couch with a book in his hand. Harry's cheeks went red with embarrassment. No one is supposed to see his weaknesses.
Draco walked into his bedroom and pulled his pajamas out of his wardrobe. "Hurry up I'm cold" Harry complained and snuggled under the duvet. "I am love" Draco responded and changed. Harry's eyes fell on Draco's body.
"Neville can make it" Harry smiled. "Ron and Hermione can too" Draco said throwing the envelope to the side. He opened the third one. "Blaise can as well" Draco smiled. "Looks like we're set." Harry said. "Good. Well then what are we going to prepare for dinner." Harry rolled over onto his elbows. "We could make a chicken meal? or a steak dinner?" Draco said throwing out ideas.
Harry snapped out of his daze and hugged Draco. Harry hugged Draco, he hugged Draco like he had just saved Harry from a burning building. Draco didn't take a moment to hesitate this time around, his arms just landed around Harry. Draco nestled his face in Harry's hair. Harry smiled. "The pillowcases" He said softly. "What about them?" Draco lifted his head up and looked at them.
Draco let out a sigh and shook away the thoughts..he probably was over thinking as always. "Y- yes of course right" Draco stuttered, he only stuttered around Harry. It was embarrassing. Draco pulled his hand away from Harry's tear stained cheek. "Well then it's just about lunch isn't it?" Draco said clearing his throat.
"Dray" Harry said once more a tiny bit louder, hoping he would hear. Draco did hear him, his wand clattered to Harry's stone floor. He ran out into the common room to see Harry sitting on the floor clutching his side. Draco was relieved Harry was home, but also worried.
Draco captured Harry in a passionate kiss, pulling him closer by his waist. Harry's arms fell around Draco's neck as a reflex. The kiss, long and full of fire. They needed each other.
He rolled his eyes and laid his head back on the rim of the tub. "I'll be back" Draco smiled and walked to the door. "Yes?" Draco said to Hermione. "Where are the cups? I don't want to search through your cupboards. That would be disrespectful" She said politely.
"Let's stop speaking now." Draco covered himself. "You're just mad green is an ugly color" Draco rolled his eyes. He wanted to say no, no green is not an ugly color. Especially the green in Harry's eyes.  "Like red and gold are any better" Draco scoffed and Harry smiled, covering himself as well. "Go to sleep potter" Draco said as secretly smiled to himself. "And i'm not in here for you, i'm in here because.. my room smells funny" Draco said trying to ease any tension he internally felt. Harry just chuckled to himself and dozed off. Now feeling safe, actually safe for the first time in a few years.
"Do you really want me to come with you?" Harry became very serious all of sudden while Draco was removing his shoes. "What? Why would you think I don't?" Draco looked at him, very confused and walked past Harry into the bathroom to brush his teeth.
"Yes I would love that, I mean" Neville cleared his throat. "Yes I will check my schedule." Neville said trying to sound more in check. "Okay neville" Harry chuckled and Neville got up to go sit back at his normal spot of the table. "Oh and Harry" Neville stopped and looked back at Harry. "Not that I care or anything...but Blaise will be there too?" Neville said nervously. Harry cracked a smile and nodded. Neville smiled and kept walking.
"you're so perfect" Harry said under his breath. Draco finished getting dressed and smiled. "no we're so perfect" Draco slid under the duvet next to Harry and wrapped his arms around the boy's waist.
"We're getting married today love" Draco smiled and kissed Harry. "I cannot wait to be officially married to the love of my life" Harry smiled and got up out of bed. "I have plans with Ron and Hermione, they are going to help me get ready" Harry changed into some comfortable clothes.
"Oh that's odd why?" Draco looked at them. "Well this is just us but, since we're already in love Amorentia doesn't affect us" Hermione said smiling. Harry's eyebrows shot up and Draco's cheeks reddened. "Well I have somewhere to be, so Harry I will see you..well you know when" Draco winked at Harry. "Good day Granger, Weasley" Draco walked off.
Draco instantly opened Harry's wardrobe and began sifting through it. He was trying his hardest to ignore the smell of Harry. The smell of his boyfriend.
"Love it looks like some of these are for you" Draco looked back at Harry. Harry turned to look at Narcissa. "Oh you didn't have to do that I feel terrible" Harry looked at her with sincerity. "Oh don't be silly it's not Christmas without gifts right?" Narcissa placed her hand on Harry's shoulder and smiled. "I guess you're right" Harry smiled. He felt like he belonged here.
One spell did hit someone, a stupefy spell hit Narcissa. She fell unconscious. "Your own sister! You're evil!" Draco shouted at her.
Harry's eyes widened. He'd cried and acted like a fool for that long. "Oh my it is?" Harry frantically stated.
His father was the cause of most of his panic. His father was abusive, to him and his mother. He never physically hurt Draco except for a few times, his mother on the other hand was a different story. His father would hit his mother whenever she would 'disobey' him. Lucius was the main reason Draco thought he was worthless. That's all he was told throughout his childhood.
"Now c'mon" Harry got out of bed tugging on Draco's hand. "I am I am calm down" Draco chuckled and got up. He put his slippers on and handed Harry his. Harry slid his own on.
Ron actually smiled, Ron let himself smile at something Draco had said. "Shove off Malfoy." Ron said hiding his smile. "Is that all
"Not what" Harry said between kisses.
Once he was breathing normally again he looked up at Draco. "I can't go you know i can't go" He sniffled. "You don't have to, we can just stay in all this weekend. Dance and chat and read" Draco smiled a little trying to sound cheery and convincing.
"I couldn't let him take you away, I couldn't, I just absolutely couldn't" Draco rambled on. "And why's that?" Harry's voice never raised, he kept it soft and cool. "well, because" Draco mumbled.
"I would absolutely love to see these on you" Draco smirked and threw them onto the bed as well. "Maybe you will, maybe you won't." Harry chuckled. "A sweater" Draco threw that.
"Wanna go for a shower?" Draco caressed Harry's arm softly. Harry nodded. "You can go first" Draco said. Harry nodded again and got up. Harry inhaled sharply as he tried to walk. "Did you break my legs or what?" Harry chuckled looking back at Draco. Draco laughed and got up. He put his underwear on and picked Harry up. "You might be a little sore" Draco carried Harry into the bathroom and turned the shower on, making sure it was at a nice temperature.
Draco began dancing around the room gracefully. Harry watched in awe. Draco walked over to Harry and bowed. Harry smiled. Draco then put his hand out gesturing for Harry to take it. "May I have this dance?" Harry smiled. "I cannot dance for the life of me" Harry chuckled and set his hand on Draco's. "That's alright I'll teach you." Draco smiled and wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. Harry set his hand on Draco's shoulder. Both of their other hands were intertwined.
"Well then what's on the agenda for you two today?" Ron asked them. "You know just shagging all day" Draco smirked. Ron, Hermione, and Harry just about choked on their food. "I'm joking morons" Draco chuckled.
Draco was trying to soothe Harry in any quiet possible way he could. Soft kisses to his temple, caressing his side, whispering reassurances into his ear. "I'm here to kill the boy, as you all probably have figured." Barty said.
They turned their attention to Ron. He was wearing a black suit, blue tie to match Hermione's dress. His hair was done nicely, it was slightly long so it was parted down the middle. He looked rather dashing. "Ron you look gorgeous as well" Harry chuckled and hugged him. Ron smiled and hugged back.
"Go put it on" Neville said. Draco nodded and went into the bathroom, he opened the bag which contained his suit. One thing was for sure, he had a great fashion sense.
"Well then why don't I feel anything, we feel anything?" Harry looked up at Snape. Snape simply shook his head and chuckled walking away. "He's so odd" Draco said smiling. "Hermione will probably know why it didn't work, she knows everything" Harry said smiling.
Harry's mouth was slightly agape and his emotions were all trying to flood him. The flood gates were trying to open. Harry took a deep shaky breath. "Good day Potter" Draco walked away from Harry. Draco wanted to look back and apologize. He didn't. He couldn't have Harry killed.
Harry had never given up a fight, no matter the circumstances. He wouldn't give up now. Harry wouldn't give up Draco, he wouldn't give up the life they've made. Harry wouldn't give up their future plans, Paris, the home in the countryside.
Draco turned to face Harry. "Come here to embarrass me again Potter?" He spat out at Harry. "On the contrary Malfoy, I came to say..sorry" Harry looked down. Draco couldn't believe his ears, he had Harry Potter apologizing to him. What a strange world.
"Yes that one, it was a messy scene, of course they didn't know I was watching" Myrtle giggled again and laid on her back in the air. "What? What do you mean a messy scene?" Draco was starting to panic.
"I love it mum thank you." Draco said pulling away from the hug. "I'm glad" She smiled and began walking to the door. "I'll leave you two to get accommodated to the room." She waved and walked out and downstairs. Harry turned to Draco and started instantly crying.
They would simply make out, hopefully maybe more eventually. But that would be all, no sweetness, no love, no feelings. Unless more happened, unless something blossomed. Draco's heart deserved to stay cold. Draco deserved to be alone.
Harry slid into his bed and curled up under the covers. The bed felt unwelcoming and stiff. They had slept in Harry's room only once, the bed didn't have Draco's heavy scent. It didn't have the perfect indentation of their bodies. It felt like a strange far away land, laying in his own bed.
"Sorry?" Draco looked at him confused. "Yes Sorry, would you like to hear it in a different language?" Harry said smiling. "You're sorry, to me?" Draco said still not believing it, he was sure Harrys friends made some evil plot to make a fool out of him. "Yes Malfoy i'm sorry, i'm sorry for just now and i'm sorry for last night" Harry mumbled. "Last night was..a bad moment for both of us, we were both angry for no reason" Draco shrugged.
He couldn't lose his true love. Draco couldn't even bare the thought of how much pain Harry must be in. It made him sick.
"I cannot believe you." Harry had the biggest smile on his face, his cheeks began hurting. Narcissa was just watching with love and endearment. "I love you boys" She scooted over to them and hugged the both of them. They both reacted instantly hugging her back.
"You open yours first." Harry nudged Draco and smiled. Narcissa was watching intently, she knew what both of them had gotten each other. "Fine fine" Draco unwrapped his cute little box. It revealed a black box.
Draco turned around and his eyes widened. "Mum?" He looked at her. "Hi darling" She smiled.
"this might hurt but it'll get better ok?" Draco stared up at Harry. Harry nodded. Draco kneeled between Harry's legs and slowly inserted his middle finger halfway. Harry inhaled sharply. "Are you ok?" Draco looked at him. Harry nodded. "More" He managed in a small tone. Draco slid his whole middle finger in. "Fuck..more" Harry almost yelled. Draco added a second finger.
"No Malfoy that was different." Harry said softly. "That one wasn't a terror " Draco was looking at him holding onto every word Harry was saying. "That was just a regular old nightmare" Harry said chuckling. "Don't worry Potter just think of me and you'll have sweet dreams" Draco smirked smugly.
Draco kept his hand there slowly rubbing his thumb along his knee cap.
Draco came into the bathroom. "I have no idea" He shrugged and began brushing his teeth as well. Harry put on comfortable clothes and walked out into the bedroom. "Neville said he would be here at around 5:00" Harry put some house shoes on. "So did the other two people." Draco smiled.
Harry laid there breathless and watched Draco's head fall lower with each kiss. Draco looked up at Harry and flipped them around. Harry now straddling Draco. Draco re-connected their lips. Harry kissed him hungrily. Draco kept his hand spread out on Harry's waist line. Harry did something that shocked Draco. Harry began kissing down to Draco's neck.
Harry felt angry and embarrassed. He felt embarrassed because Draco had seen his wrist, he was angry for obvious reasons. Harry slammed his fist down on the counter top. He hated himself. He hated the way he looked. He hated the way his family treated him. He hated being so weak. Harry just wished he was what everyone made him out to be.
"Everything feels so right" Harry said into Draco's chest. "Everything is so right" Draco smiled and kissed Harry's head. "I just can't shake the feeling that something is going to go wrong" Harry sighed. "Love stop worrying, everything is fine" Draco said reassuringly.
Draco bit his lip at the sight of Harry satisfying himself on his leg. "Eager are we?" Draco whispered breathily into Harry's ear. Harry shivered and moaned softly. "Please fuck me Draco" Harry whimpered, he was so sexually frustrated. Draco went crazy at the thought of it.
"I could ask you the same question. I fell asleep in my room." Harry stared back at him. "Clearly not. Do you sleep walk or something Potter?" Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco kissed Harry's forehead. "I'm gonna go and get Sev ok?" Draco whispered. Harry nodded. Draco got up and grabbed his shoes. He put them on. "I'll be back in a few minutes" Draco opened the portrait. "Be safe" Harry said as Draco left. "You know I will." Draco said before the portrait shut behind him.
Draco picked Harry up and took him into his bedroom. His bedroom which was now torn apart, most likely from Granger and Weasley searching for whatever they were searching for.  The envelope maybe.
Draco turned around to see Ginny Weasley staring at him. Draco narrowed his eyes. "What?" He asked coldly.
Back in the Gryffindor quarters Hermione was trying to have a serious discussion with Ron. Ron on the other hand was too busy complaining about how hungry he was. "I think something is seriously wrong with Harry, didn't you notice he's acting a little..off?" Ron simply shrugged "I didn't notice much" Hermione scoffed
Walking up the aisle was one of the most nerve wracking things Harry had ever done.
Ron choked on his food now. "All choked up now aren't you Ron" Harry smiled. Hermione was just staring wide eyed, mouth agape. "You asked" Draco snickered. "Well I didn't need to know" Ron stated catching his breath. They all quieted down. Harry and Draco smirked at each other and continued eating.
"I could get used to the whole suit and tie thing." Harry checked himself out in the mirror. "You look hot as hell in it" Draco smirked looking back at Harry, Draco was fixing his tie. "We both do" Harry smirked and walked over to Draco.
"You could get in trouble for being out here you know that right?" Harry asked and continued walking. "I thought something happened git, pardon me for being paranoid. You're known for getting into trouble." Draco said walking next to him. "I just went out for a stroll" Harry shrugged.
Harry yawned a little, tired from being up every other hour of the night and from what had just a happened. "Tired?" Draco asked looking down at him. "A little" Harry said rubbing his eyes.
Draco apparated them into their hotel room and smiled. "You are so beautiful fiancé." Draco kissed Harry's cheek. "Fiancé that has such a nice ring to it" Harry smiled and held Draco's face.
He was finally returning to Hogwarts after his awful summer with his terrible aunt and uncle. They had never treated him with even a drop of respect.
"He needs to die son" Lucius said calmly. Draco clenched his fist. "Go to hell" Draco spat at him. "I'll see you there Draco" Lucius smirked and looked behind Draco. "Oh look who's decided to join us"
Harry melted into a smile. "Thanks mate" Harry couldn't stop smiling. They knew and they were alright with it. Now Harry knew as well, he was most definitely not straight.  "So um" Draco cleared his throat. "What was it you two blokes needed?" Ron looked over at Hermione who was now questioning whether or not she should bring it up.
"The bathroom, as in only one?" Draco did not look impressed "Yes Mr. Malfoy is that a problem?" Dumbledore simply turned to look at him.
Harry was smiling and beaming pure white light. These dreams seemed fathomable. That's what made everything better. "We can tell our child about how we came to fall in love, about how we made it, about how we beat the odds" Harry smiled and kissed Draco softly. Draco kissed back with a large smile plastered on his face.
"Come on." Snape was now on a mission, nothing was going to get in his way. Draco followed him. They stopped at Professor McGonagall's, Lupin's, and Mad eye Moody's doors. Draco also made Snape alert Hermione and Ron. Once they had assembled all of them, they all met back up in Dumbledore's office. Snape stood up in front of all of them.
"I didn't..I uh didn't out you" Ginny stuttered and her eyes began to flick through each one of the people standing in front of her. They went from Harry to Draco to Hermione to Ron. "You're stuttering, you're lying" Ron said as he wrapped his arm around Hermione.
Harry snuggled up to Draco and smelled him. Draco smiled and held Harry. "This is all I ever want" Draco said softly. "You are all I ever want"
"It's nice to see you so openly talking to me about this." Draco smiled. "I wanted to tell you how I felt for so long, it's wild that you know now." Draco looked down at Harry. Draco sighed.
"Stable, but weak. You may go see him. " Snape patted Draco's shoulder. "He'll be fine" Snape said as Draco passed him on his way into the room. Draco smiled slightly and nodded. He slowly entered, scared of what he would see. Draco saw Harry laying down in one of the beds. Draco took in a shaky breath and slowly made his way over to Harry's seemingly lifeless body.
"Just because Harry isn't here doesn't mean you can't have some fun, we won't bite we promise" Ron smiled. Draco bit the inside of his cheek. Draco would go for a quick drink and be back in an hour. "Fine yes I'll go with you" Draco said.
Harry smiled against Draco's lips. Draco softly pulled away and breathed heavily. They just stared at each other. They were both staring at each other with swollen lips, red cheeks, messy hair, and a burning passion hiding behind their eyes.
"Good morning!" Bellatrix came into the room and waved hello to everyone. Harry smiled at her, then noticed she had her wand tucked into her pocket. He found it odd, but let it slide. Maybe she was ready to defend them against an intruder or something.
He lead Harry through the halls to the Great Hall. Harry barely acknowledged his friends, they hadn't even seen him come in.
Bellatrix had opened all of her gifts. She got up and hugged everyone, saying thank you along the way. "I'll be right back" She smiled and disappeared into her room.
"I figured i'd make it a fair fight, wouldn't be much fun if I could take it so easily so here." Barty tossed each of their wands to them. Harry's trembling hand reached out and grabbed ahold of his.
The pain was love, and the love was pain.
"You're so manipulative Draco, you know that?" Harry put his finger on Draco's chest pushing him out of the bathroom. Hermione and Ron took the hint, collected their things and left.
"Oh yes some of the things I could tell you" Narcissa smiled. The fun, cheery, and loving banter continued for the rest of the meal. Harry took in the moment, he was really digesting how it felt to have a happy family.
a shell of who he used to be.
Harry kissed down Draco's chest. Draco watched him, Harry was walking a fine line. Harry kissed down Draco's stomach and stopped right where Draco's pant line started.
Draco and Harry were finally on their long awaited and well deserved trip to the capital of love.
"Doesn't matter to me" Harry rolled his eyes. "Liar" Hermione said under her breath. She smiled to herself. "What was that Mione?" Harry looked at her.
"I really want to genuinely apologize" Draco finally looked up from the pillow to meet eyes with Harry. "Apologize?" Harry looked at him as well once he felt Draco's gaze lingering upon him. Draco fiddled with his fingers.
"So yes Harry. Someone does love you. Someone does love you with their whole fucking heart." Draco ran his hand over his face. Harry took Draco's hand. Draco looked over at him. Harry was staring at him wide-eyed. "I'm sorry, it all just came bubbling up." Harry mumbled.
"W- well we're about to be so let's go" Harry pulled out of Draco's arms, catching his breath. Draco chuckled. Harry turned back to look at him. "Always leaving me breathless somehow"
Leaving just the tiny couch for Blaise and Neville. The two couples exchanged smiles knowing they both had the same idea.
Draco was cut off by Harry smashing his lips up onto Draco's. Harry's hand moved from Draco's shoulder to the nape of his neck. Draco took a moment to adjust, once he did he quickly had his arms around Harry's waist.
Draco bit his lip softly and smirked. Draco was extremely turned on by the sight of this. He had never seen that side of Harry before. That side that was so, outgoing and confident. Draco liked it.
"Wh- what" Harry said looking up at the ceiling. "Oh my god you are so gay" Draco sat up. Harry fiddled with his fingers. "I have no idea what you're going on about Malfoy." Harry glanced around the room now getting nervous that someone would have to find out.
"My owls name is Hedwig" Harry smiled. Draco smiled as well. "Hedwig"
"Oh I see you two have become friendly hm?" Dumbledore ran his finger along the back of their couch. He inspected his finger as if looking for dust. "Yes sir we have
Today would most definitely be awful.
Harry
Harry hit him with a pillow. "So? so ew that must've been weird for her idiot" Harry chuckled. "Wanna look for some formal clothes for dinner?" Draco looked down at Harry as he got up, going to his wardrobe. "Yes where's my trunk?" Harry looked around. "Check your wardrobe I bet mum bought you clothes" Draco smiled and pulled out a dark emerald green suit.
Draco nodded and cleaned up the mess. Class finished up a little later. Draco and Harry walked out of the classroom and met up with Hermione and Ron. "Hey 'Mione we had a question" Hermione looked over at Harry. "Yeah what is it?" Hermione held Ron's hand. "Well the Amorentia didn't work on either of us" Hermione and Ron both suppressed smiles. "It didn't work on 'Mione and I either" Ron said smiling.
The wedding.
"God that was embarrassing" Harry put his head in his hands. Draco smiled and moved to sit on the couch next to Harry. Harry leaned into Draco and yawned.
"Malfoy"
He was being a bit harsh. Harry knew he should calm his attitude, he was just so angry for some reason. "Jeez someone woke up on the wrong side of the broomstick this morning" Draco rolled his eyes. "Whatever Malfoy, go away" Harry shooed him with his hand.
"..Alright" Draco sat on the other end of the couch.
"We need to tell Snape" Draco said finally standing still. Harry shot up. "What? Are you mad!?" Harry asked furrowing his eyebrows. "He's not as bad as he comes off, he is my godfather after all." Draco said.
"What is going on?" McGonagall said. "Harry has been taken." Snape said in his normal monotone. Gasps erupted from the people in the room. "By who?" Dumbledore looked at Snape.
"Looks like Ron left his jacket  here." Harry picked it up and set it on a table. "He can grab it whenever we do our next gathering." Draco smiled and kissed Harry's forehead.
Harry was actually looking at Draco's eyes for the first time. The fire in Harry's eyes turned to question and confusion. Harry had never noticed how genuinely beautiful Draco was. Harry stayed there just looking in his eyes, exploring them.
"What is?" Harry said.
"Thank you so much." Draco looked back at Ron and Hermione them embraced them, almost knocking them over. "Of course" Hermione said smiling. Harry got up and joined the hug. They all held each other for a little bit there.
"You're right, let's just hope for the best." Hermione said and kissed his cheek, getting up to go to her room. Ron smiled and went up to his room
"Oh and boys I have a nice surprise for the two of you." Narcissa smiled mischievously. The two boys exchanged confused glances. "You won't get it until we arrive at the manor" Narcissa continued.
Draco looked over at the clock on his wall. It read 12:04. He got up from the floor and opened his wardrobe. He got out his pajamas and slid them on. Draco ruffled his hair and yawned. He slid into his bed and covered himself. Draco looked around at the empty room. He wasn't used to sleeping alone. He was used to having dorm mates. Draco had always hated sleeping alone because when he slept he was most vulnerable. Anyone could come in and kill him and he would have no help.
Once Draco was out of sight Harry broke into a large beaming smile. He satisfied Draco. That made his day. Harry loved having the satisfaction of knowing he could satisfy another person. Not just another person, a man. Not just any man, Draco. Harry looked over into Draco's mirror and fixed his hair. Harry looked like a lovesick puppy dog. It made him smile.
"Continue seeing some boy and I will have your head on my wall, you pathetic loser" His uncle grabbed him by the hair and lifted him off of the couch. Harry whimpered and let a few tears fall. "Now go do the dishes" His uncle said and threw him onto the kitchen floor. Harry clutched his side. Bruises, more bruises. "On with it then" Vernon kicked him. Harry feebly got up and grabbed onto the counter for support.
Draco sighed and walked into the hall. Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall all watched him enter. They hadn't expected him to join the rest of the students this afternoon, considering the events from earlier.
"Yes really now come along" Harry smiled and walked to Gryffindor table.
Harry wasn't put in his new dorm because the feast in the Great Hall where the announcement of Head boy and girl hadn't happened yet.  Ron and Hermione unpacked and got comfortable.
"Why did you do it again?" Draco asked softly. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and stared at Draco. "He's right, I'm worthless Draco. I'm nothing Draco. Don't act like you're going to care about me once this year is over" Harry said angrily. He was angry for no reason, everything was just happening so fast. All of Harry's insecurities were just surfacing at once. It was quite overwhelming.
"Oh woah woah no" Draco and Harry said chuckling. Neville appeared confused. "No not like we're not in love or perfect or anything. You just definitely don't want all the threats and worry." Draco said. "Oh yeah right" Neville said, sounding a little less confused. "Neville you should come by sometime, we could hang out, Blaise could come too" Harry said smiling.
Ron and Hermione rushed over to him, placing their hands on his back. Hermione's hand clasped over her mouth when she saw Harry.
Harry never had a hefty appetite because of the way he was never correctly fed. If he ate too much he would throw up. If he ate too little he would just cry over how bad his stomach hurt. His aunt and uncle never fed him, they always made sure he was frail enough and scared enough so he would never leave them.
He opened the door to find a sleeping Harry thrashing wildly and crying. Harry had streams of tears running down his face. The blankets were thrown to the side, the sheets were all messed up. Harry was gripping onto the sheets so tightly his knuckles were about as white as Draco. Draco became very worried all of a sudden and ran over to Harry softly telling him to wake up. Harry arms shot up and wrapped around Draco. Harry was still very much asleep.
Draco's hands were now moving along Harry's upper body. Harry's hands rested on Draco's shoulders. Draco pulled away and left sloppy kisses down Harry's jawline. Harry tilted his head to the side and let out a soft subtle moan. It was one of the most gorgeous things Draco had ever heard. Draco sucked down Harry's neck. He wanted to make Harry feel desired and needed.
"I'm just kidding Dray" Harry chuckled. Draco grabbed his heart. "Jesus Harry don't do that." Draco took a deep breath. "You were really worried weren't you?" Harry looked at Draco.
"Every time...every time I try to open up, or let my guard down...something happens. Why in hell did I think Draco bloody Malfoy would be any better. I showed you, i showed you things about myself that no one knows about! You made me feel better ! It was a lie! Because if it wasn't you would've talked to me about this!" Harry was crying, and yelling. He felt so messy. So angry.
Draco melted and smiled. He toed his shoes off and got into his bed. "You like the way I smell?" Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry laid his head down on Draco's soft sweater vest. "It makes me feel safe" Harry snuggled into Draco and closed his eyes. "Do you want to put pajamas on?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry shook his head. "No I'm comfy" Harry smiled. "Alright then" Draco  took off Harry's glasses and smiled. "You really know how to make me melt Harry Potter" Draco said softly. Harry just subtly chuckled and began falling asleep. "Goodnight Harry" Draco kissed his forehead. "Goodnight Dray" Harry said back softly and quietly.
He saw most of the professors from his school there. Snape spotted him and immediately embraced Draco with a comforting hug. "I'm so sorry my dear boy" Snape said and held Draco. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, attempting not to cry. Snape pulled away and smiled at Draco. It was a very sad smile. The loss of Harry Potter was a great loss, an impactful loss.
"We will be the hottest couple here tonight." Draco smirked and pulled out an all black suit. Harry pulled out another deep red one, a black tie. Draco an emerald green tie. "Yes we are definitely going to be on fire" Harry smirked and began putting his suit on.
"i just can't believe you!" Harry yelled.
After Harry was out of Draco's sight he ran to the dorm. Harry chuckled and ran inside, the portrait opened, letting him in. He smiled and ruffled his hair. Harry couldn't believe he had just done that. He knew Draco would probably finish his food and not come. But he got to tease Draco a little, leave an open invite.
Draco stood still, staring and admiring Harry's complexion. "You're really tempting me right  now" Draco smirked and stride over to Harry. Harry's breath hitched in his throat, his cheeks heated up.
"..It seems we have two head boys." Hermione, Ron, Harry, and just about the rest of the Hall gasped. "Yes, yes I know it is surprising but this is the decision we've made." Dumbledore spoke. "Now for who they are..We have.." The whole hall was watching Dumbledore impatiently. "Mr. Harry Potter"
Draco and Harry's tongues fought as Draco counted to pleasure Harry and only Harry.  Draco sped his pace up. Harry's moans were quieted because their mouths were connected. Draco removed his lips from Harry's and sucked down his neck instead.
Harry smiled to himself and moved his head back down, slowly drifting off to sleep. Draco also smiled and felt his heart flutter, although it had already been fluttering all night. Draco pitied Harry. Draco wanted to know who the hell had been hurting him. He wanted to tell Harry everything would be alright, he wanted to hold him and kiss him, he wanted to be the one always there for him, he wanted to be the one Harry would trust with all his secrets.
Harry let out a breath of relaxation and relief now that Draco was gone. He never thought once in his life Draco would be the first to find out. Draco doesn't know the whole story and Harry had hoped he never would. Harry couldn't control himself anymore, he broke down crying. Draco was the only person Harry had ever truly wanted. Harry promised himself he would never ever act on it. The things Draco said about Harry made everything worse. He thought Harry was ugly.
Harry rested his head on Draco's chest and yawned. Draco ran his fingers up and down Harry's arm slowly. Harry drifted off to a peaceful sleep. Draco smiled and fell asleep not so long after Harry had.
"Well because he seemed like he had something he wanted to say" She continued smiling. Ron was too busy trying to take food off of Hermione's plate. "Really think so?" Harry looked up at her. He felt guilty for being rude.
"Did you hurt Harry? I swear to god if you touched him even once you will be a dead man. Coming in here covered in blood, and now Harry's in the hospital wing. What did you do?!" Ginny walked towards him and poked his chest.
"Mine-" Two people said at the same time but both stopped talking. Blaise and Neville, the two of them began speaking at the same time. "Oh you go" Neville said. "No no you go" Blaise said putting his hands up.
Dinner was finally over. Harry said bye to his friends. Seamus and Dean also came over to wish him luck as head boy. Harry made his way out of the Great Hall to the place Draco had said to meet him. He saw Draco come out of the Great Hall alone. "You're such a prat" Harry said softly so anyone passing by wouldn't hear.
Harry began crying silently, he thought he had put this all behind him. Harry's mind could not even begin to focus on one thing, so much was running through it. His tears wetting his cheeks.
He walked back into the bathroom and took his pajamas off, getting into the tub with Harry. "We needed this" Draco said softly and kissed Harry's cheek. Harry laid his head back on Draco's chest. "We really did" Harry smiled. Draco began to rub Harry's shoulders, they were tight from stress. Harry let out a breath of satisfaction and relaxed into Draco.
Draco placed his hand on Harry's. Harry looked up at Draco and smiled. "I got you a gift." Draco said softly and handing Harry a box. Harry quirked his head. "I've got one for you two." Harry handed Draco a smaller box.
The next thing they knew they read through half of lunch. They didn't need to meet up considering they were already with each other. "Skip lunch?" Draco looked over at him. Harry nodded. "But let's go back up to the dorm, i'd much rather read on the couch"  Draco smiled and got up. Harry got up as well and tread upstairs and through the many twists of Hogwarts to their dorm. They arrived in their dorm and took their shoes off.
Draco and Harry fell asleep Christmas eve with the biggest grins anyone could see. They were both so excited to give each other their gifts. They were restless but managed some sleep throughout the night. The sun arose bright and early.
Draco walked through the halls nodding at Slytherin who acknowledged him first. Someone was calling his name. He turned to look back. It was Luna Lovegood. Looney Luna. "Finally I caught up with you" Luna said smiling cheerily as always.
"You're not gonna leave me for Weasel right?" Draco smirked down at Harry. "Even if I wanted to Ron is straight. You have nothing to worry about." Harry smirked right back. "I'm more into blondes anyway"
"Oh none of that Harry it's the best day of your life. It's amazing don't be nervous" Hermione said as she smiled and sat down on a chair at the vanity shoved in the corner of the room. "We have your hair to do, shoes to shine, and a tux to get on without ruining your hair. Well then I guess we should put the tux on first" Hermione was trying to figure out the steps to her perfect plan for Harry's wedding.
"I know, but the view is much more intriguing  than my food" Draco smirked and ate his food. He was teasing Harry, trying to embarrass Harry. Harry felt a slight blush creep up on his cheeks. Draco looked over at Harry who was only poking at his food.
"You're not ugly" Draco kissed down his neck. He softly laid Harry back down. He unbuttoned the buttons Harry had managed to clasp. It's was just the bottom three. Harry went to stop Draco, but didn't . "Is this alright?" Draco looked at Harry. Harry nodded.
"Well I'll explain why I'm here." The man smirked devilishly and looked at everyone in the room. Draco had Harry pushed up against him, scared and trembling.
"So Neville, top or bottom?" Harry smirked. Blaise and Neville choked on their food. Ron and Hermione tried to keep quiet, not burt out laughing. "I'm sorry what?" Neville said catching his breath. "I said how do you like the last name Longbottom?" Harry smiled. Draco smirked.
"You're lyin-" Harry cut Draco off. "Draco let him speak. Come here both of you" Harry gestured for them to come closer. Draco had this look on his face. A look of 'what the hell are you doing?'
"Okay we have preparations to do come on!" Hermione lead them into Ron's house and up to an empty room which had Harry's tux handing on the back of the door. "I'm so nervous you two" Harry said as he came into the room and sat on the bed.
"Except this year it seems we have a dilemma, or shall I say a..slight change" Dumbledore looked around at all of the children staring back at him. The students all quietly murmured amongst themselves.
Draco sighed, he didn't know how Harry would come back. He didn't know if Harry would be fine alone for an hour.
"No we did not, he's lying. I put much thought into the gifts." Harry smiled a satisfactory smile and sat back as everyone began unwrapping their gifts.
He wanted to pin Harry against a wall and make him feel needed, wanted, desired. Draco did want, need and desire him.  Harry's tongue slid along his bottom lip. Draco would've completely lost his cool expression if the portrait to their housing hadn't opened. "Who is that?" Harry whispered. "Maybe Dumbledore, I'll go check" Draco said grabbing his wand. Before he had time to get up, Harry's door handle had been turning.
"Fight!" Bellatrix said and smirked. She began targeting Narcissa, spells flying left and right. Narcissa deflecting them all and throwing them right back. "My own Sister!" Narcissa yelled at her. "Oh whatever!" Bellatrix rolled her eyes out and stuck her tongue out at her. The spells kept flying through the air.
He sat down next to Draco, all the Slytherin turned their head to look at him with disgust.
"The little red head Weasel girl. She saw us making out. How the hell did you think it was me?!" Blaise said to him. Harry and Draco's faces matched. Both of them were more shocked than they ever had been.
"We can go up with you if you want?" Hermione rubbed Draco's shoulder comfortingly. Ron nodded and looked at him. "No I need to do this myself, but thank you" Draco sniffled.
Harry began trembling, his whole body set into a fit of shivering. Draco pulled Harry closer to him and slowly backed away. "Wh- what are you doing here?" Draco said, trying to sound stern and unafraid. "Bella didn't tell you?" Barty smirked.
"Harry, it's really something I feel should be talked about in private" Dumbledore was starting to get a little angry. "Whatever you need to say to me can be said in front of him" Harry wanted to grab Draco's hand for comfort but obviously couldn't. "If you insist on being so stubborn, fine" Dumbledore let out an exasperated sigh.
Draco was empty.
"Woah Hermione swearing so aggressively I never thought I'd see the day" Draco looked impressed. Harry on the other hand was red as a tomato.
Draco was trying to soothe Harry in any quiet possible way he could. Soft kisses to his temple, caressing his side, whispering reassurances into his ear. "I'm here to kill the boy, as you all probably have figured." Barty said.
Draco and Harry made their ways down to the massive dining room with the crystal chandelier hanging over the long dark wood table. Draco's aunt was already seated, she was wearing a long black dress.
"You can choose I don't care but don't make it something Gryffindor like" Draco said not as angrily as if he was still thinking about the bruise he had seen. Quite a large bruise. Right on the backside of his wrist. It looked as if he had been grabbed roughly. Like someone grabbed him aggressively and dragged him away.
Draco hit himself for what he was about to do. He picked Harry up, bridal style. He carried Harry into his room and laid him down under his silky green sheets. It hadn't occurred to Draco in that moment that he could've probably just taken Harry into Harry's room. Draco covered Harry and laid down on the opposite side of the bed.
"What kind of question is that potter?" Draco said "No no, not like that I was going to take a shower, I was just asking so if you had to use it you could before I did." Harry said now embarrassed and a little red in the cheeks. "Oh well no I don't have to, go shower Potter you smell anyways" Draco said glaring down at him. "Oh alright " Harry immediately turned away and scurried to the bathroom.
"Harry James Potter" Draco looked down at him. "Full name? Okay what's on your mind?" Harry looked up at Draco.
"Draco" Harry whispered. "Draco" Harry said a little louder. "Hm? What?" Draco jumped a little. "Oh Harry, you're awake" Draco looked at him.
"You could say that" Draco smirked. Ron was just sitting there clueless. "What are you even talking about?" He turned his attention to Hermione. "They fucked." Hermione said. Ron looked completely mortified.
Draco's palms were sweaty. His mouth felt dry. He managed to keep his composed face and remained calm. "N-no" Harry said he could feel his cheeks heat up. Harry loved Draco being this close. Harry could smell his scent, green apples and vanilla.
Bellatrix had opened all of her gifts. She got up and hugged everyone, saying thank you along the way. "I'll be right back" She smiled and disappeared into her room.
Draco's arms were growing tired and his knees were weak from Harry's tongue on his neck. Draco carried Harry over to the couch and sat down putting Harry on his lap, he was straddling Draco's lap. Harry was now moving onto another spot of Draco's neck. Once Harry's lips made contact, Draco knew that was his spot. Draco moaned and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist pulling him farther up on his lap.
Your darling Harry
"Don't." Draco said groggily. He was barely conscious. It was kind of how a drunken man's words are his sober thoughts. Except in this case it was a tired man's words. Draco kept his arms around Harry, Harry re-wrapped his arms around Draco. "Sorry to wake you." Harry said softly.
"Kind of surprising though" She continued.
Draco was smirking like usual. "Well then, it's been lovely seeing the both of you. Harry I'm glad you're better" Hermione stood up and pulled Ron up as well. Ron waved farewell, still not completely back in reality. He was still quite mortified from the thought of it.
"Lunch is over in 5 we have the rest of our classes to go to" Draco said sighing and bookmarking the spot they were at. Harry whined. "Ugh fine" He got up and put his shoes back on. Draco chuckled. Draco got up and stood behind Harry wrapping his arms around Harry's waist. Harry tensed up but relaxed almost instantly.
"I despise you Draco Malfoy" Harry hopped off of the counter and glided his hand along Draco's pants, along Draco's zipper. Draco bit his lip and scoffed. "this should be fun" he mumbled and followed Harry out into the common room. "Let's go eat" Harry smirked and walked out of the door. "My dinner won't be the only thing getting ate tonight" Draco said into Harry's ear and walked out in front of him.
"Lucius thought it would be great to torture Draco with you and me." She sighed. "I'm sorry that you're here. It's all my fault Ms.Malfoy" Harry looked down. "Hun it's not your fault at all. And please none of that proper speak. Call me Narcissa." She took Harry's cold hand in hers. Harry smiled and felt a little warmer knowing Draco's mother accepted them. She was a complete sweetheart as well. "Darling you're freezing. This is just awful. I cannot imagine how you must feel right now. If it's any consolation I know he'll come for you" She smiled and rubbed Harry's hand.
"Any other bruises or marks or anything?" Draco looked down at him. Harry rolled up his pant leg. A bruise on his shin. Draco sighed and softly caressed Harry's arm.
"If it's any help I don't hate you. Zabini means nothing, he's a moron a bloody moron, you're still one of the most respected people here at Hogwarts" Harry offered a smile up at Draco. Draco felt a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. He looked around the empty bathroom.
Draco snapped up once he heard someone in the common room. He grabbed his wand and made his way to the door.
"Oh..yes they were" Harry stopped for a second but continued looking. He walked into the bathroom and looked around. To his surprise the envelope was just thrown carelessly to the side. "What an idiot" Harry whispered under his breath.
Harry was ready to sacrifice his life for Draco. That was real love. Real, raw, genuine love. The feeling of an eternal bond being created between two hearts. Souls being bound together. Soulmates.
He saw all the times he had cried himself to sleep. He saw all the times he went to bed without breakfast, lunch, or dinner. He had saw how weak he was and how inferior it made him feel. He tore himself away from the mirror and got in the shower. He felt the hot water hitting him and relaxing all his tense muscles.
Harry let out a shaky sigh, and looked down at his wrists. Draco swallowed thickly and let a  tear fall down his cheeks as well.  Harry was embarrassed he was so weak, so weak he couldn't even control himself. Draco took Harry's wrist, lifted it to his face and slowly kissed the cuts.
"Harry!" Ron smiled and drank some of his pumpkin juice. "Hey Harry" Hermione smiled as well. "I've missed you two" Harry said and made himself a plate. "We've missed you too, you're back in classes today right?" Ron asked.
Harry was going to do whatever he could to keep the visit off of his mind. He was going to distract himself all day, until the time would come for him to go.
Harry just rolled his eyes and finished putting his shoes on. "Can we get in trouble for this?" Harry asked walking over to Draco. Draco shrugged. "Maybe...but that's the fun part" Draco smirked and grabbed Harrys hand, leading him out of the dorm and throughout the dark corners of the hallways.
Harry sat down with his friends and they both hugged him. "Hey Harry" Hermione smiled. Ron was sitting on the other side of the table. Ron's eyebrows furrowed. "Mate what's that on your neck?" Ron asked still confused. Harry blushed and pulled his collar up. Hermione just giggled quietly and poked at her food. "Oh I just- I- Uh a spell gone wrong?" Harry looked at the both of them. "A spell gone wrong.. what? ...three times?" Ron asked and chuckled.
Draco let one of his hands fall down to intertwine with Harry's. Harry smiled and let out a deep breath he hadn't even realized he was holding. Draco knew what he was doing was wrong. Draco promised himself he wouldn't fall for Golden Boy, after all he wasn't good enough for Harry.
The music came to a halt and Draco pulled away and bowed. "Thank you for the lessons" Harry bowed as well. "Anytime" Draco smiled and re-wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. Harry was looking up at him.
Ron and Hermione's eyes both fell to the boys swollen lips and Draco's neck. Their gaze fell further to Draco's arms tightly wrapped around Harry's waist.  Harry blushed and covered his face with his hands. "Well then, we'll be going, maybe another time" Hermione said smiling. She was so happy to see Harry genuinely happy. Even if he did look a little embarrassed.
Draco was crying, holding Harry. "Bellatrix, turned on us brought Barty in the house" Draco sniffled and pointed to Barty who was laying unconscious on the ground. Harry was trembling, scared. He was trying to calm himself down by burying his face and body into Draco. Smelling him. Trying to make sure he was really there.
"I'll see the two of you sometime before break ends okay?" Harry said as he walked Ron and Hermione to the door. "Of course you will mate. We can't stay away from you for long anyway." Ron chuckled and hugged Harry.
"I'm not an evil person I promise I won't try to kill you again." Bellatrix offered a smile. Harry decided it would be best to not have any enemies this Christmas break so he decided to forgive her. "Okay, that's good to know" Harry said politely.
They truly made a perfect pair.
Would he have to be all alone?
"I'm just not sure I'll be very..good at it" Harry said. Draco smiled softly. "I'll lead you through ok?" Draco whispered down to him.
They woke up the next morning bright and early. Draco woke up first, Harry refused to get up. Draco pressed his lips to Harry's exposed neck. "wake up darling" Harry shivered slightly and cracked his eyes open. "i don't wanna" Harry whined and snuggled Draco.
Neville, Blaise, Hermione, and Ron had arrived to the Manor.
They silently walked through Hogwarts hallways and out to the lake. Harry lead Draco over to a tree. The leaves were orange and falling off. Draco sat down and leaned against it. Harry looked around then sat down and leaned against Draco. Draco smiled and wrapped his arms around Harry while opening the book. "I'll miss you" Draco said softly.
"Love they need to take him, let go" Narcissa held him on the floor. "I can't, I cant.." Draco sniffled and watched Snape carry Harry away and into the green fire. Draco buried his face in his mother's shoulder. Narcissa's legs had Harry's blood on them. Hermione and Ron both did as well. Harry's blood soaked Draco's hand and clothing. "It's ok" She whispered and rubbed his back.
He was following the two of them when he bumped into someone. A tall person, platinum blonde hair, people dressed in green surrounding them. Although the people just looked like green blobs considering Harry's glasses had fallen off.  A scent of vanilla or green apples lingered in the air. Harry sighed, he most likely just pissed off a Slytherin.
Harry let his hands drop down to Draco's hips. Harry loved the way his hands fit perfectly on Draco's body.
Draco looked at him.
"Stop worrying love, nothings going to go wrong ok?" Draco grabbed Harry's shoulders softly and kissed his forehead. Harry sighed and nodded. "You're probably right" Harry kissed Draco's chin and walked out of the bathroom. "Let's go eat" Harry walked out into the hallway, Draco followed. "I obviously have got to cancel plans with Neville and Blaise" Harry said as they walked.
"Fine, I'll quiet down" He rolled his eyes and poked around her room. "Have you gained the boy's trust Bella?" The man looked at her.
Draco pulled out two sweatshirts, he figured it would be cold. "Here love" Draco handed it to him. Harry put it on and cuddled into it. Draco pulled out two sandwiches, a red candle, a bottle of champagne, and a few napkins. "I'm in love with you. Im so in love with you" Harry pulled Draco's face down and kissed him gingerly. "I love you too darling" Draco smiled and sat down next to Harry. He poured them each a glass.
Draco slowly and softly bit on Harry's bottom lip. Harry let out a soft sound, not a moan, not a whimper. Just a sound of pure pleasure and bliss. Draco smirked and now slowly picked up his pace. His hands traveled Harry's hips and waist. He was careful not to be too aggressive because of the bruises.
Draco stared down at Harry, very confused. Draco sat down next to Harry and took his hand. Harry smiled. "Good because Harry I have a favor to ask" Blaise smiled and sat in a chair next to Harry's bed.
"Neville's one of my best mates." Harry smiled. Harry could already tell where this conversation was going. Blaise seemed like a good person. Anger overtakes people, it makes them do things they don't want to do. Harry knew Blaise would treat Neville right.
He came out of the bathroom, walking back into the room with Ron and Hermione. Hermione smiled and felt her eyes fill with tears. She walked over and hugged Harry, careful not to wrinkle his suit. "I'm sorry I'm such a crybaby today." She sniffled and pulled away.
Harry just stayed there staring at Draco. Draco's hand laid on the back of Harry's neck. Harry was completely infatuated with the way Draco's hands felt on him. Draco moved slightly closer.
Draco and Harry both shot up. "God why is it never peaceful?" Draco groaned and rolled his eyes. He looked around for his wand. It was still in Harry's room. Draco got up and walked towards the door. Harry followed him. "Stay back" Draco whispered.
"What the bloody hell why? I hate that wanker he's bloody awful and a pain in the arse" Ron said.
Dear My Love,
"I love you so much." Harry looked up at Draco and took Draco's head in his hands. "I love you too" Draco connected their lips softly. Harry smiled into this sweet kiss. A knock on the portrait startled them.
From,
"Harry it's you, I found out because Dumbledore said you hadn't responded to him yet, but congratulations" she continued looking at Harry while Ron looked completely dumbfounded as if he had no idea what they were talking about. "Oh I did get a letter I just never got around to reading it." He shrugged. Harry hadn't read it because he saw who it was from. Usually when he would get letters from Dumbledore, it was bad news. "Who's head girl?" He asked, wanting to know who he would be sharing a dormitory with.
What Draco had done just moments ago was something he never thought he'd be doing. He comforted Harry, in the only way he could. He offered his mouth and his body, the only things he was good for. Draco knew he had to stop being sweet on Harry. He decided he wouldn't be anymore.
Draco cut him off. "You don't need to apologize or explain yourself to me Potter. I just wanted to help you forget" Draco offered a small smile down to him.  Harry sniffled and wiped his eyes. "Thank you" Harry sniffled and started standing up. "You're welcome" Draco said softly helping Harry up. "Are you alright now?" Draco asked and didn't know why. "Yes I'm fine..really thank you." Harry said smiling up at Draco. Draco smiled back. "Do you still want to go to dinner?" Draco asked.
Oh no. Green. Slytherin. Draco.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry's waist causing Harry to gasp. Draco flipped them, getting on top of Harry. Harry pulled Draco's face back down to his by the nape of his neck. Draco kissed down Harry's neck. Draco looked at Harry for permission to remove his shirt. Harry nodded and removed Draco's as well laying it on the bed somewhere.
Harry ate half of his plate, that was half more than he usually ate. Breakfast was over, the golden trio made their way out of the Hall. They went to their scheduled classes. Harry enjoyed being back on a schedule, having some structure. Although he did miss being with Draco all day. Harry couldn't deny the way he felt. He never could. No matter how hard Harry tried to push Draco out of his head, Draco stayed and ran laps through Harry's brain.
"Great answer" Harry said sarcastically. Draco sniffled and chuckled. "From now on, any time anything happens with your dad or Dumbledore or for god sakes anyone who threatens either of us, let's tell each other" Harry smiled. Draco nodded.
Draco took this opportunity to kiss Harry. To silently let Harry know that he was completely infatuated. Harry softly kissed back. Draco pulled away and smiled down at him. "Thank you" Draco said softly. "What for?" Harry's eyebrows knitted. "Helping me, helping me grow, helping me be stronger" Draco smiled. Harry kissed him again. Harry kissed him to silently let him know he would help Draco time and time again.
"Of course I was, you twit. I thought I had lost you." Draco held Harry's hand. Harry rubbed the back of Draco's hand with his thumb. "You can't get rid of me that easily" Harry smiled. Draco chuckled and sniffled. "Making jokes at a time like this?" Draco watched Harry's eyes look around the room.
Three times.
Harry slowly sat up, Draco helped him. Harry removed his shirt slowly. Draco let his tears fall when he saw the big bruise on Harry's right side. "Oh harry." Draco whispered and traced the bruise's outline with his finger softly. Draco's eyes fell to Harry's right wrist. A new one. Draco's heart tightened. "You're never going back there again I promise." Draco said.
"I remember some of it, but how did you even know?" Harry looked at Draco. "Were you paying attention to which bathroom you went into?" Draco asked him chuckling. "Oh god, girls lavatory?" Harry asked looking down at him. "Girls lavatory" Draco chuckled. "Well thank Merlin for Myrtle" Harry said smiling.
Draco went over to his wardrobe and put his robes and clothes back on. He straightened his tie and slid his shoes on. He fixed his hair and made his way back to Harry's room. He knocked. Once. Twice. Three times. No answer. "Potter?" Draco said. "One moment, i'm just putting my shoes on." a shaky voice had said from behind the door.
Draco pulled Harry's pants and boxers off completely and took a moment to rake his eyes over Harry's body. "damn.." Draco mumbled and felt his own pants tighten. Draco took some of the jelly like substance and smothered his fingers in it.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's cold lifeless lips, his tears soaking Harry's face. "M-my love.." Draco said through tears, his voice breaking constantly. Draco brushed a piece of hair off of Harry's forehead.
Harry began washing dishes. His side hurt, he was sure his uncle had most definitely broken something in Harry's body. Oh how Harry longed for Draco to be at his side helping him.
"You're welcome" Draco handed him his pajamas. "I'm going to brush my teeth, change and then you come brush yours" Draco smiled and left the room. Draco started brushing his teeth. Harry closed Draco's door and changed swiftly. Harry walked out of Draco's room and into the bathroom.
He didn't want to relive the moment. Harry knew he would eventually have to, and he felt comfortable doing it in front of Draco. Harry sounded small now. "he threw me onto my own bed, shut the door and...well..you know" Harry nibbled on the inside of his cheek. Draco's heart shattered. He had figured that's what had happened, but he didn't want to believe it.
He came back into the living room. Blaise and Neville were collecting their things as well. "Leaving?" Harry said. "Yes they are they have Christmas plans to attend to" Draco smiled at Harry. "Alright then. It was lovely seeing you two." Harry smiled. "Let's get together for a double date sometime yeah?" Blaise said to Draco and Harry as he took Neville's hand.
"The teasing sickens me" Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Darling, I love you." Draco smiled down at Harry and turned around to begin washing himself. Harry sat down on the shower floor wanting the water to hit his sore muscles. "Move out of the wayy" Harry hit Draco's shin softly. "Gimme a second I need to wash the shampoo out" Draco looked back and down to Harry.
"Yes, it is" Draco said chuckling. "Would you care for some lunch or not?" Draco said looking at him. Harry was rather hungry, his stomach felt empty. So did his head. Harry grumbled and shook his head. He wanted to sleep, starve. Draco tilted his head a little. "You sure you're not a little famished?" Draco moved a piece of hair off of Harry's forehead.
Harry simply nodded and started dinner. It took him an hour to make but when it was finally done he was rather proud of the work he had done.
Neville was clearly much more nervous than Blaise was. Neville wore a black suit with a red tie. His hair looked messy yet neat, it looked as if it was completely neat at one point but it had been messed up from Neville's hands nervously running through it. Neville looked jittery and full of anxiety.
Draco kept his hand on Harry's lower back, rubbing it in small circles.
His aunt said to his cousin right in front of Harry. "Hey freak you heard what mom said" Dudley chuckled.
He opened the envelope and began to read. He felt his heart drop and his legs go numb. His mouth ran dry and his head began to pound. His hands were shaking.
Draco told Snape the clean version of how whatever him and Harry had, had come to be. Snape listened intently. "Speaking of, your father is back in Azkaban" Snape interrupted once Draco had gotten to the letter his father wrote him. Draco's face lit up. "Really?" He asked Snape. Snape nodded. "Proceed with your story" Draco continued.
"Who is doing this to you" Draco said. Harry couldn't respond. He knew if he tried to talk he would cry. Draco understood completely and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist pulling him up onto his lap. Draco slowly and softly placed his lips on Harry's. Harry dropped his arms around Draco's neck.
"Darling, may I have this dance?"  Draco bowed down. Harry giggled and took his hand. Draco pulled Harry close to him and began swaying to a beautiful slow song. The same song they first danced to that night in the Astronomy tower. "I couldn't be happier." Harry said with a smile. Draco nodded in agreement and continued to sway with his fiancé.
Draco smirked and placed his lips on the exposed part of Harry's neck. Harry shivered and inhaled sharply. "we have classes" Harry whispered looking back at Draco. "In 5 minutes" Draco spoke softly into Harry's ear.
"Okay now all we need is Blaise" Harry turned back to Draco. Draco nodded and looked around. "Found him" Draco said. "Blaise" Draco half shouted. Blaise's head shot up and Harry motioned for him to come over. Blaise cautiously got up and walked over.
Draco left three love bites along Harry's neck. Harry couldn't help but let out sweet soft moans at the feel of Draco's mouth and tongue on his neck. Draco licked over each mark he had made. Draco kissed back up Harry's jawline to reach his lips again. Draco kissed him hungrily. Harry kissed back just as eagerly.
Harry almost laughed at the nickname Draco had given Snape. "What is he doing here?" Snape said looking at Draco.
Draco's face dropped. "Stupefy?" He looked up at her. Her face lit up "Oh yes yes that's the one, Harry fell to the floor and closed his eyes, the other boy opened Harry's mouth and poured something from a vial into Harry's mouth, once Harry awoke he was smitten" Myrtle smiled and giggled.
He had gotten Blaise and Neville a joint gift, necklaces. One said he's a catch, the other said he's a keeper. Harry thought it was a funny cute gift for them because they were just starting out. Blaise was very passionate about quidditch so Harry found it to be a perfect gift. It was cheesy but cute.
"I'll see the two of you sometime before break ends okay?" Harry said as he walked Ron and Hermione to the door. "Of course you will mate. We can't stay away from you for long anyway." Ron chuckled and hugged Harry.
"We figured you were probably bored, we are going to sneak out to Hogsmeade maybe get a drink at The Three Broomsticks" Hermione said. "Oh well thank you that's very kind." Draco smiled softly. He wanted to go but he didn't want to have fun while Harry was being tortured. "Maybe another time." Draco said softly.
Draco let his hand fall from the brick, he took it upon himself to slowly intertwine his hand with Harry's. Draco squeezed Harry's hand softly. "Oh and he holds hands? I am finding out so much about you today" Harry smiled and looked at the carvings on the brick. The poor brick Draco had taken his anger out on.
"I'm glad I was" Draco looked him in the eyes. "Now would you like to get back to your sleep, because if not I have somewhere we could go."
Draco wanted to kill whoever put their hands on Harry. Draco was always having a constant internal battle. He wanted to tell Harry, to let Harry know how he felt. At the same time he didn't want to be labeled as some guy who got rejected by 'The Boy Who Lived'.
Draco put the suit on, careful not to wrinkle it or ruin anything. "Today is the best day of my life" Draco smiled and came out of the bathroom. "It's amazing Draco. Shit how much did that cost?" Pansy stared at him in awe. "Oh let's not worry about that" Draco chuckled, it was quite a lot.
They finished up in the Great Hall, everyone said their farewells and went their separate ways. Draco and Harry made it back to their dorm and removed their shoes.
Blaise bowed his head as a farewell. "I'll see you two around" He exited the hospital.
"Goodnight Harry" Draco mumbled and smiled. "Goodnight Draco" Harry replied and laid his head back down on Draco's chest. Draco held Harry and rubbed his back softly. He continued to until Harry drifted off to sleep. Once Harry was asleep, Draco fell asleep as well.
They decided on James Scorpius Malfoy-Potter.
Draco smiled and sat up just looking down at Harry. "What?" Harry looked up at him. "Nothing you're just.." Draco studied his body. "...so pretty" Harry blushed and smiled softly.
Draco was in his bedroom just staring at a wall. He heard Harry cry. Draco heard Harry's whimpers. They hurt him deeply, he had hoped they weren't because of him. Draco wanted to go comfort Harry. No, no Draco would never comfort Harry Potter. Draco was strong and much better than Harry. At least he thought so.
"Please be safe" Draco turned to Harry. Harry turned to him. "You know I will" Harry said softly. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's waist and pulled him closer. In all honesty he forgot Snape was even there. Whenever him and Harry were together it felt as if no one else was in this world. Draco kissed Harry softly. Harry smiled and kissed back. Snape was surprisingly unfazed.
Harry sat back down on the bed just as Draco finished up his shower. Draco came back into the room, dressed in more comfortable clothes. Harry smiled. Draco smiled as well. "Have fun snooping around?" Draco smirked and put his shoes in his wardrobe.
"I won't have to" He smiled in one of the absolute most creepiest ways Harry had ever seen.
Harry stumbled into Snape's classroom, the door was already open. "Professor?" Harry said as he entered the room.
"Petrificus Totalus" Snape yelled and Lucius was paralyzed. Lucius was distracted when Snape casted that spell by Harry bleeding out. Lucius was frozen with a smile on his face, he was convinced he had finished his master's deed.
Draco would scowl at every other person looking at them. They got back to the dorm and entered. They were both utterly shocked to see the Headmaster looking around their common room.
"I told you one moment Malfoy!" Harry cried out, angry and sad. "I- I-" Draco went over to Harry and gave him the only thing he could offer. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and kissed him. Not with the passion, but with a sweet savory feeling. Harry's cries slowly subdued and he started kissing back. Draco continued to kiss him.
"Ha ha very funny Malfoy" Ron said. "Well then sorry to intrude" Hermione said smiling.
Harry felt his cheeks redden and saw his friends mouths agape. He signaled to them he didn't know what was going on and got up. "Zabini, partner with Crabbe" Blaise fumed and got up. Harry stopped at the side of the table, letting Blaise out. Blaise scowled at him and walked away. Harry sat down next to Draco.
"Now come on let's go eat dinner alright?" Blaise helped Harry up and lead him out of the bathroom. Harry hadn't even realized he'd ran into the girls lavatory in a fit of panic earlier. Blaise walked next to Harry holding his hand.
Whenever Draco got an opportunity he would look into Harry's eyes. Just so he could try to figure out all of Harry's secrets. All of the problems he hid from the world. All the times his family hurt him. Draco wanted to know how they hurt him, and why he hurt himself.
"I'll be back." Draco got up after taking Harry off of his lap. Draco left the room, going downstairs. "So how's it all been going?" Ron looked at Harry. "It's been truly amazing. You two don't even know. I never thought I could feel like this." Harry smiled and basically drooled over his relationship.
Harry tensed up. Draco. Harry realized his arms were wrapped around Draco's waist and Draco's arms were wrapped around..well Harry in general. Harry's head laid on Draco's firm yet welcoming chest. Draco's head laid on Harry's.
"Enough" Draco said sternly staring at all of them, making them look away. Harry couldn't lie, it was hot when Draco took control so easily. All the snakes turned back to their food once Draco had told them so.
Draco was shaking slightly, his heart hurt. His heart genuinely hurt. Draco didn't know a heart could actually heart. He let Harry fall into this immediate danger. "Where would he have taken him?" Professor Lupin asked. "I don't know" Snape looked down at him.
Harry nodded. Draco threw the floo power into the fireplace. "Okay come on" They went in and came out in the middle room of Draco's home. The room where Lucius had died and Harry had almost died. They both shuddered at the memories.
Harry's brain was overflowing with the smiles and laughter of Draco. He couldn't bare to let that laughter go quiet.
Harry's tears were long gone, the sadness and uneasiness in his stomach had disappeared. Draco slowly sat up and looked down at Harry. Their hands were still intertwined. "Thank you" Harry said quietly.
"Merlin I slept that long?" Harry said getting up out of bed running a hand through his raven hair. "Yeah and? what's the big deal it's not like we have classes to attend." Draco snorted "But we missed breakfast." Harry said sadly looking at Draco. "That's okay I can call a house elf to bring us some food does that sound good enough for you Golden boy?" Harry nodded "Yes that will do"
Snape looked at Draco. Then his eyes fell to Draco's neck. Snape's mouth once again almost fell off of his face. Harry blushed and looked away. All of a sudden the wall had become very interesting to Harry. Draco smirked. "Thank you Sev, we will see you in class tomorrow" Draco smiled at his shocked god father.
join their conversation.
Draco caught a look at Hermione's hand on Harry's and couldn't help the wave of jealousy that rushed over him. Draco knew Granger and Weasel were a thing. He shouldn't even be upset, Harry wasn't his, and he wasn't Harry's. Draco returned a scowl to Harry. Harry's expression had softened slightly but went back to a look of anger. The amount of mood changes Harry went through was insane. Draco couldn't keep up.
Harry looked behind him when he heard the portrait open up again. Draco stood in front of the entrance with a smirk on his face. He walked over to Harry and stared down at him. "God Potter, you really know how to leave me breathless" Draco chuckled. "Now it's your turn" Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. Harry's cheeks turned pink, but he continued to smirk, this was going just as he had hoped.
Harry and Draco turned around to see Ron standing there with Hermione. "Hey you two" Hermione smiled. Draco and Harry waved at the same time and turned their attention back to the rude red head standing in front of them.
Harry was done before him and waited patiently for Draco to finish. Draco finished and looked at Harry. "Afraid to go into my room alone?" Draco chuckled. "Just thought it'd be a bit rude to show myself into your room" Harry shrugged and messed with the bottom of his silk red pajamas. Together him and Draco looked like Christmas.
If you're reading this that means the worst has happened. I'm writing this while you're in the shower. I can hear you singing. It's soothing yet so damn funny. Things have been too perfect lately, I just keep anticipating something going wrong. The thoughts in my brain aren't good ones. All I can think about is the worst. Draco, you mean the whole world to me, you are my light, my reason to live. You saved me. You are the other half of me and I'm sorry it took me so long to realize it. I know that I'm dead considering you're reading this. I want you to know I love you with every bone in my body. I love you so much and you deserve every single ounce of it. Please Draco, go to Paris. Go see the Eiffel Tower. Think of me while you're doing it. Do it for me. Buy the Manor on the countryside. Remember you're so fucking amazing. I don't want you to stop living just because I have. I hope you can feel my love radiating through this. Haha maybe you can wouldn't that be amazing if you could. I'm sorry that was off topic. I love you. I hope you don't ever have to read this. If you do, I love you. Stay safe Dray, don't ever forget me.
"You seem upset, whatever is the matter?" Myrtle tilted her head to the side. "Well, potter played with my emotions, I was stupid enough to let him, now he's off with Blaise. My damn ex." Draco said sadly.
Harry gulped and tried to remain composed. Draco sat there and just studied Harry's face. His face was skinny, his eyes were a little sunken but not much, his lips were bruised. Draco smirked at that. "This will sound odd, but it's not" Draco took in a deep breath. "Take your shirt off" Draco said lowly staring at Harry. Harry immediately went defensive. "What? Why?" He backed up a little.
"I will talk with him sometime, thanks Harry" Neville smiled. "But, anyways what's going on with this whole situation?" Neville pointed between Harry and Draco. "Oh..ha...well. you cannot tell anyone if I tell you" Harry said sternly inching closer to Neville. Harry trusted Neville, there wasn't much to be worried about with him.
"I'm sorry we're meeting under these circumstances. I've heard quite a bit about you from my son" She smiled and nudged Harry slightly. "Draco?" Harry looked at her. "Yes, Draco writes to me quite frequently. His letters recently have been all about you" She straightened out her long skirt.
Harry nodded. "Come here" Harry scooted over and patted the spot next to him. Draco took his shoes off and got into the bed. Harry snuggled into Draco's arms. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry's hand entangled in Draco's silky hair. Draco stroked Harry's back soothingly.
"Then put your shoes on let's go" Draco got up and fixed his hair. Harry slunk off of his bed and slid his shoes on. Draco waited for Harry patiently. "Could you go any slower?" Draco prodded.
Draco looked up at the sky. "I wonder what time it is, we must get back to the dorm before dark." Harry looked up at him. "We are going back to the dorm bloke" Harry rolled his eyes playfully. Draco nudged him and continued walking. Harry walked silently, avoiding the looks he and Draco received once they entered the castle.
School had finally come to a close. Although it was sad to see it go, Harry had never felt more free. No watching eye of a head master. No worrying about his family. No judgement.
"When I was made head boy, I first saw Harry in our dormitory and told him to stay out of my way" The whole hall gasped at the fact Draco had called him Harry. The people who lived off of drama were eating up every second of this speech. The proud Gryffindors and Slytherin were utterly disgusted. The fan girls/guys who had made up their own fantasies were thrilled. The closeted students were very excited that this hopefully meant Hogwarts would become a safer place with less judgment. The other students who really didn't care about anything continued to eat.
A tender kiss to all four, kisses that would linger on his wrists for years to come. Harry smiled through his sadness. Draco pulled away and looked at Harry. Draco had watery eyes just as Harry did.
"God why?" Harry looked up and rolled his eyes. "I'll go look." Draco said and got out of the shower. Harry sighed. Draco slid on the green robe that was in the bathroom closet. They had just gotten their bath robes a week prior, they hadn't even known they were going to get them. Draco put his wand in the pocket of the fluffy bathrobe.
"My first name, you saying my first name" Draco looked down at him. "Oh well, I like it too" Harry smiled and walked out of the room in front of Draco. "Well let's go eat, then classes, we can meet up before lunch maybe?" Harry looked back at Draco. Draco smiled. "Cant get enough of me can you?" He chuckled. Harry blushed and looked away. "Of course we can meet up before lunch" Harry looked back at him smiling. "Let's goo" Harry said smiling and walked out of the dormitory and into the hallway. Draco chuckled and followed him.
He took his glasses off and set them beside him. Harry rubbed his eyes, Harry thought he had gone into his bedroom. Although he was most definitely still in the bathroom. He slowly fell asleep on the bathroom floor. Exhausted from all the emotional stimulation. It was more of a pass out than a sleep. He didn't intentionally do it, he just did. It was like his body collapsed.
They both fell asleep, their hearts beating in sync. No one could ever understand why two hearts beat to the same melody. A unique melody made for two, those specific two people. Only those two hearts would skip, jump, and beat to the same tune.
Draco was standing at the alter. The wooden alter, a wooden arch with red roses weaving their way through it. Chairs lined up evenly on either side of the aisle. There was no separation for the two's different sides of family. Everyone was mixed together. It didn't matter which side anyone sat on.
Harry winced. "I don't want to hurt you boy" Lucius hissed. "Just want to finish what the dark lord started" He pulled his wand back out and pointed it at Harry.
He decided to wake him. He got down on his knees and whispered "Potter" Draco got a little louder when Harry didn't wake. "Potter" He said once more. Harry never once even flinched. Draco put his hand on Harry's neck to make sure he wasn't dead, he was indeed alive. Draco let out a sigh of relief and watched the raven haired boy barely move.
"And who cares what anyone thinks?" Harry said softly.
The man who he had once watched dance around the room with such joy and passion was now dead. The man he had once held tightly in his arms feeling the warmth he radiated, was now in his arms, but cold and lifeless. The other half of Draco had just been ripped from him.
Harry limped over to the shower and got in. "You know what I'm even sore" Harry smirked, teasing at Draco. "Your limp says otherwise" Draco chuckled looking at Harry through the glass shower door. "No limp, I'm fine" Harry pushed on as he washed himself and his hair.
fed this weekend.
Draco licked Harry's bottom lip, triggering a shiver down Harry's spine. Harry parted his lips softly letting Draco's tongue enter. Harry held onto Draco and fought with his tongue.
Harry was more than teary, there were tears actively rolling down his cheeks. Harry basically threw himself at Draco and began sobbing. Draco kissed the top of Harry's head and held him tightly. "I love you. I love you so much. I love you" Harry repeated into Draco's shoulder. Draco smiled and wiped Harry's teary eyes.
"Wouldn't hurt to look would it?" Ron got up. Harry shrugged and got up as well. Hermione got up too. They all walked around Harry's dorm searching for an envelope. Ron made his way into Draco's room and began to search. "Harry?" Ron asked "Yes?" He replied. Hermione was looking in the common room.
"..The other head boy... is Draco Malfoy"
"I want you to know, I couldn't be happier. Draco found a good boy. Someone good for him. I know you two will take great care of each other." She was rather giddy and happy for being locked up in a dungeon. "If you don't mind my asking why are you here?" Harry looked at her and rubbed his head in a spot where it was incessantly throbbing.
"I don't like looking like a bloody hunchback in front of people" Draco said huffing. "You look fine, even if you had a hunchback" Harry smiled. Draco's expression softened and he smiled as well.
Draco was hit with the smell of him. It hurt to not be able to know how Harry was doing there. To not know how they were treating him.  Draco sighed and walked over to his bed where Harry's sweatshirt was neatly folded. A piece of parchment lay carelessly on top of it. Draco picked it up and unfolded it.
Draco couldn't even begin to pay attention to that. "Harry No!" Draco was repeating, a loop of his words. "You can't die!" Draco yelled at Harry's body. He grabbed ahold of Harry's shoulders. "What about Paris?!" Draco shouted in a sob. "What about our dream life?!" Draco cried and held Harry's body close to him.
"Oh good" Blaise let out a sigh of relief. "Could you maybe..oh I don't know put in a good word for me? Maybe? Please?" Blaise smiled a little and adjusted his seating position. "Yes, Neville talked about you quite a bit. He always talks about how amazing you are at potions. He always says he wants to be your 'friend'." Harry chuckled at Blaises reactions throughout his sentence.
Draco opened it, there lay one of the most beautiful  rings he had ever seen. "Oh Harry.."Draco was at a loss for words. A large band, an emerald in the middle. Shapes and grooves carved into the metal band. "You always complain about how you don't have enough rings, so I got you one more to add to your tiny collection." Harry smiled at his reaction.
"Now come on let loose have some fun" Ron said. "Yeah alright" Draco said.  They drank and chatted for a few hours. They finished up and made their long way back to Hogwarts. "That was actually quite fun you blokes aren't as bad as I thought." Draco smiled and stopped in front of his portrait. "Well we'll see you tomorrow or Monday, thanks for coming you're not as bad as we thought either." Ron smiled as well. Hermione nodded. They walked away and Draco entered his dorm.
Harry got up to see who it was. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. "Always a pleasure Malfoy" He rolled his eyes and walked away. Harry was not going to put up with Draco's shenanigans this year.
His uncle chuckled. "Come on Dudley let's go watch tv" Vernon said. "Alright" Dudley replied and walked over to the tv.
"Yes Malfoy you angered me happy?" Harry said softly, always softly, Harry's tone never rose above it. Except for when he was angry, Draco had just yet to figure that out. Draco felt an overwhelming need to hold harry, tell him he shouldn't be sorry now, not ever.
"I'm gonna talk, and your going to listen alright?" Harry said sternly and sat on the couch. Draco was now nervous, extremely nervous.
Draco tilted Harry's face upwards. "You're strong Harry, you're a strong amazing person. You can do this I know you can I believe in you" Draco leaned down and kissed Harry. Harry kissed back. Harry felt Draco's soft lips against his own. It made his heart warm. They pulled away and sighed. Harry got up and grabbed his trunk. Draco went to the portrait and opened it. To his surprise it was Snape.
you know how to say Weasel?" Draco said chuckling and looking up at him.
Harry let out a deep sigh. Draco cleared his throat and began speaking. "About what I wanted to talk about earlier.."
"Voldemort" Harry's voice and body shook. Harry hated saying that name.
"You will not be doing that in my home" Lucius hissed. They pulled away and all looked at him.
"Oh nothing just choked on a piece of food"
Draco started to panic. He opened the door to the study, it was empty. His heart rate quickened. He thought someone had taken Harry. He shouldn't have cared as much as he did. Draco went to the bathroom and opened the door slowly. His eyes fell to the floor. He saw Harry sleeping peacefully on the bathroom floor. His foot was jammed up against the cabinet, that must've been the bang.
"Are you hungry though?" Draco said again. "I'll be fine until dinner." Harry said softly and sat down on his bed.
Draco studied Harry's face for what must've been an hour and a half. Dinner was in 30 minutes so he decided to wake Harry. He softly shook Harry. "Wake up dinner's in 30" Draco said softly. When Harry didn't wake Draco thought of a much better way to wake him.
Harry hated everything about the way his wrists looked.
It finally came to be Christmas.
Draco walked up to the entrance and slowly walked in. Everyone patting his shoulder on the way in, they were all feeling sympathy for the poor boy who lost his soulmate.
"I just wanted to make sure you two had a safe place to go whenever it was needed. I wanted you to know your always welcomed here." She smiled and wiped the tears from her eyes. "I love you mum" Draco hugged her tightly. Harry stood by and watched.
Draco just looked him in the eyes. He hoped Harry knew he wouldn't make fun. Harry smiled a very sad empty smile. He looked nervous and scared. Harry reluctantly began slowly unbuttoning his shirt. Draco didn't break eye contact. He didn't dare look down until Harry was finished. Draco just stared at Harry. Harry stared back and finished unbuttoning his shirt.
He rubbed his eyes and stretched. Draco grumbled. Harry smiled and got out of bed. He left his glasses on the bedside table. "Wakey wakey drakey" He said annoyingly. "Call me Drakey ever again and I'll hex you"
Harry and Draco walked back to the dorm in sad silence. They both knew it wasn't going to be a good weekend. Draco was beyond worried about Harry. Harry was beyond scared of being without Draco, and being with his family.
Twice.
Draco rubbed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.
Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's waist soothingly. "What about?" Harry furrowed his eyebrows. "Christmas break is very soon as you probably already know" Snape said.
"I don't deserve you" Harry looked up at Draco. Draco scoffed. "If anyone's undeserving it's me" He said. Harry chuckled. "Right right uh huh" Harry buried his face back into the crook of Draco's neck. Draco stroked his hair softly.
My dearest boy,
"I cannot believe you." Harry had the biggest smile on his face, his cheeks began hurting. Narcissa was just watching with love and endearment. "I love you boys" She scooted over to them and hugged the both of them. They both reacted instantly hugging her back.
Harry clapped his hands excitedly and began handing out their gifts to the rest of the people in the room. "We got these all last minute so if you don't like them, sucks" Draco said with a smirk and Harry hit his shoulder.
Harry pushed the image of Blaise and Draco making out, very far out of his head.
He grabbed his wand and mumbled "colloportus" and it locked.
Dray,
Harry looked up at him with his head quirked. "That's all? So why is everyone being odd?" Harry asked. "I may have seemed a tad bit in love with you..." Draco smirked.
Draco stood next to Snape, curiously watching Snape's wand. "Harry you're good to go." Snape said and tucked his wand away. "Thank you sir." Harry stood up a bit too fast. The room became filled with fuzzy dots of random colors. Harry felt Draco's arm reach out to hold him steady. "Are you alright?" Draco asked.
Draco took a seat next to him. Hermione and Ron acted as if this was normal and treated Draco kindly. "Hello there boys" Hermione smiled. "Hi" They said at the same time. Ron waved but was like always busy shoving his face. "I'm going back home for the weekend" Harry said softly trying to sound happy. "Oh that's great Harry! Have fun we'll miss you" Hermione smiled at him.
It came time to say the vows.
He came back into the living room. Blaise and Neville were collecting their things as well. "Leaving?" Harry said. "Yes they are they have Christmas plans to attend to" Draco smiled at Harry. "Alright then. It was lovely seeing you two." Harry smiled. "Let's get together for a double date sometime yeah?" Blaise said to Draco and Harry as he took Neville's hand.
"You don't want your beloved Dumbledore to come check in on little old Golden Boy?" Draco said and it hurt Harry. He hated the nickname 'Golden Boy' it made him out to be much more than he was. Harry had said nothing and just continued talking about the password. "What do you want the password to be Malfoy." Harry asked.  He looked up at Draco who seemed to be looking at Harry with a questioning look.
Draco caught up to Harry and walked beside him. "Once dinner's over we can meet back up here and go back to the dorm alright I want to talk to you about...some things" Draco said "Alright?" Harry's eyebrows furrowed. They arrived in the Great Hall. "Well then enjoy your dinner Mr.Potter" Draco said. "You as well Mr.Malfoy" Harry smiled and walked to Gryffindor table. Draco walked over to Slytherin.
A proper date.
"Draco Malfoy" Dumbledore said. Draco's head shot up and he stared at Dumbledore. The whole hall turned their heads to look at Draco. Looks of confusion and admiration circling him. Draco felt his cheeks heat up. "Draco Malfoy was brave enough to save us all from the threat. To save us all from who hurt Mr. Potter" Dumbledore smiled.
Harry gripped the black comforter, his knuckles turning white from how hard he was grabbing. Draco swirled his tongue around every mark he had made. Harry moaned and grabbed Draco's shoulders aggressively. Draco smirked.
Draco got up and stormed off. Harry's heart ached but his mind was too fuzzy to know why. Harry looked up at Blaise. "What's his problem?" Blaise shrugged. "I have no idea" He smiled and started eating.
Draco drifted back to sleep thinking of how he could get rid of his and Harry's anger. Harry fell asleep questioning why he deserved to be breathing.
Draco smirked mischievously. Harry raised one eyebrow. "Where?" Harry questioned him, his eyes burning into Draco's.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. "In case he comes back early" Draco mumbled. "What's was that?" Hermione said opening the door to The Three Broomsticks. "In case he comes back early." Draco said. "If he does he'll be fine for an hour or two alone" Ron said.
"I know, odd right? Saying his first name" Draco chuckled at their reactions. "Slowly I let my guard down, Harry had become a very important person in my life. Therefore when I saw him being taken I did what I had to. I gathered professors and took them to where I knew he was being held. While we were all there, the evil man had hurt Harry in such a deep way. Blood was everywhere..." Draco gulped. He didn't enjoy reliving that moment.
The next two months went by a breeze. The same routine every day. Eating, classes, reading, sleep. They gradually found out more and more about each other. Harry didn't mind it, neither did Draco. It was calm.
"We need to get him to the hospital wing immediately." Snape looked around frantically.
December eleventh was the decided day. The day the two men would profess their love in front of all their friends family.
Harry smiled and looked over at Draco. "Thank you" Harry said softly. "Of course" Draco said smiling. "You seemed down I figured they would cheer you up a bit" Draco put his plate on the bedside table. Harry couldn't stop smiling, Draco really cared. Draco turned back to face Harry. Harry threw himself at Draco and held onto him. Draco was shocked at first but held Harry.
"No Harry, I'm not did you not just hear me? I was not going to tell you my father wanted you dead!" Draco said raising his voice a little. "I know. You thought you were doing it for all the right reasons, to keep me safe. Which in my opinion was stupid, but very noble" Harry chuckled a little and smiled. Draco managed a watery smile.
The plan for a calm year had already gone to shit. No way he could have a quiet year living with Draco Malfoy.
Blaise was wearing a grey suit, white tie. His hair has been freshly cut it was easy to tell. Blaise smelled of cologne and nerves. A blind man could see how nervous he was.
"So now they're gone?" Draco said chuckling once more. "Yes they've completely disappeared, good for you Draco" She skipped off and stopped along the way to tell people about their wrackspurts. He chuckled. Looney Luna.
Draco sighed and kicked the covers off of him. He got up and paced his room, trying to tire himself out. "1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8" He counted eight steps then turned around and counted once more. His mother had taught him that. She told him "Draco, honey, if you're ever stressed or all panicky count to eight, count eight steps, eight items, eight anything" She would say that to him whenever he'd go into his fits of panic.
Snape got up and glided across the floor to the spot they were sitting. "Oh hello Professor Snape isn't it just a lovely day to be in love?" Harry said smiling. Blaise smiled up at them. "Is there a problem? Blaise said innocently. Snape looked down at him. "Potter come with me." Snape said folding his hands. Harry stood up.
"Parkinson, Pansy Parkinson" She held her hand out and smiled. "Harry Potter" He grabbed hold of her hand and shook. "I know who you are" She giggled. Harry's eyebrows furrowed. He dropped it, most people knew who he was after all.
Harry grabbed onto Draco's shoulders for support. "If it hurts just squeeze my shoulders ok?" Draco said softly. "Just fuck me already" Harry licked his lips. Draco slowly slid himself in, just halfway. Harry gasped in pain and pleasure. Draco groaned, Harry felt so tight. "Are you ok?" Draco kissed Harry. "Y- yes more" Harry nodded and kissed Draco. Draco slowly slid all the way in, waiting until Harry relaxed.
Draco had felt this overwhelming feeling that he needed Harry. He would never go through with it, ever. Draco had started feeling a strange connection and yearn for Harry. Everything was just becoming too real. He knew they would go back to being prats to each other the next day. So why even bother trying.
Your Father
Harry turned on the shower then undressed and laid his robes out on the counter. He stared at himself for a moment, absolutely hating what he saw. He saw bruises on his body, he could see his ribs. He saw all the times his family had hit him.
Draco sat there and waited for what felt like the longest six minutes of his life. Harry rambled on about Blaise and his eyes and his hair and whatever else he could. Draco watched Harry eventually fall asleep. That hopefully meant the potion had worn off.
"Already putty in my hands." Draco smirked and let go of Harry's dainty hips. "I can see the dirty scenarios you've created  behind your eyes" Draco kissed Harry roughly, just to pull away. Harry whined when the warm sensation from Draco was taken away.
"You are a moron" Hermione turned into the library.
"Can you write the letters? I wanna get out of this suit and lay down" Harry grumbled as he walked into their bedroom. Draco laughed. "Of course I can love." Draco took off his tie and his rings. He grabbed three pieces of parchment. To send to Blaise, Neville, Ron and Hermione. Harry walked into the bathroom and removed his tie, his suit, and his glasses. Harry put on his pajamas and walked back out into the bedroom.
"Anymore what do you mean?" Pansy pushes on. "nothing Pansy." He replied with his head down. Pansy sighed and looked over at a table behind her and motioned for the door. "Well I hope all gets better good day Draco" She smiled and walked out of the hall.
"Draco, it's almost time." His mother said from outside the door. "okay.." Draco said quietly. Draco's voice never rose above a quiet. He missed the way Harry's voice was always so soft and quiet.
"So you've been having fun?" Ron asked. "Yes it's been nice" Harry continued to eat, Draco made him want to eat. Draco gave him a reason, a reason to try.
"Here Harry" Narcissa pushed his pile of gifts towards him. Harry looked completely stunned, his face frozen with a large smile. "Thank you so much, you really didn't have to" Harry managed out. Narcissa shook her head and smiled. "You deserve it hon." She smiled and gave Draco his pile, then Bellatrix her's.
"I- i just- i don't know what to-" Draco couldn't finish speaking he honestly had no real answer. Harry looked up to meet Draco's eyes. Harry eyes were watery. "You weren't going to at least let me know? That your father wants to kill me!" Harry said with an angry watery voice.
"Love, we must go back inside. I hate to pull us out of this daydream, but we must go back inside. We'll catch a cold if we stay out here any longer my darling." Draco pulled Harry inside. He made sure the house elves were tidying up the garden before he went back inside.
"I could get used to having Malfoy around" Ron said while finishing up his dinner. Harry still wasn't focusing. He was trying to even out his breath and calm the butterflies in his stomach. "Yeah me too he's not as bad as I thought" Hermione said smiling. "Yeah..yeah he's not bad" Harry said steadily. "You would think that" Ron smirked. "And what is that supposed to mean?" Harry looked at Ron smiling. "Check your neck" Ron chuckled and reached for Hermione's plate.
"Oh no I insist." Neville said. "Speak now." Blaise slightly commanded. Neville's cheeks heated up. Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were watching in awe. They were all trying their best not to laugh.
Draco ran over to him and sat down, taking Harry into his arms. "Harry, oh Harry what happened?" Draco held him. "I'm sorry" Harry mumbled through his tears. "I'm sorry I really tried I'm sorry" Harry sobbed into Draco's shirt. Harry continued to ramble on about how sorry he was. Draco sadly knew exactly what Harry was apologizing for. "It's okay, sh sh it's okay" Draco stroked Harry's hair.
What or who had caused that? Draco thought. He was getting slightly angry at the thought of someone putting their hands on Harry like that. Draco tried to push the thoughts aside. He convinced himself he wasn't getting angry because someone was hurting Harry, it was because he wasn't the one doing it.
"Your mum totally knew what we were doing" Harry grumbled from under the pillow. Draco took the pillow off of Harry's face. "So?" Draco snickered.
Draco slid Harry down, getting on top of him. Draco pulled away for a split second to look down at Harry.
They returned back to their hotel suite. Draco walked in after Harry and began removing his shoes. Harry unbuttoned his shirt, so he could change into his pajamas.
Draco closed the door and re locked it. "Well that was actually enjoyable." Draco chuckled and walked back into the living room. Harry followed and agreed.
"Calm your murmurs students..this year we don't have a head girl.." the students were now completely confused and lost.
Harry awoke at around 3:14 am. His arms were entangled around Draco who was sleeping soundly.  Harry's head felt heavy, his eyes felt watery. He barely remembered why he has woken up in the first place. A bad dream probably.
Draco smiled and wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. Harry looked up at Draco. Draco dipped Harry and captured him in the most meaningful, loving kiss they had ever shared. Harry was taken by surprise but fell into the kiss immediately. They only pulled back when they heard applause.
Harry felt relief flood him. Harry bent over and held his side, he knelt down to sit on the soft carpet. "Draco" Harry called out softly. He knew Draco probably wouldn't be able to hear him, but it hurt to do much of anything. Harry couldn't take all of this pain. He hadn't felt it for so long. Harry began crying.
Draco looked down at Harry's plate and saw the food was only moved around. Draco slightly nudged Harry. Harry looked at him and Draco looked down at Harry's plate gesturing for Harry to eat. Harry picked up his fork slowly and began to eat.
"Jesus Harry" Draco rolled his eyes and took in a deep breath. "I do! Can't you see? I thought those glasses were supposed to help you see better! Merlin I went fucking crazy not knowing how you were doing!" Draco rubbed his temples. "I didn't know if you were alive, I didn't know if you were hurt, I didn't know what was going on. It drove me fucking insane! Your bloody friends took me out for a drink but I could not stop thinking about you!" Draco looked down at Harry who was just staring at him.
"Yeah we're back in classes today" Harry nodded. "We're?" Hermione looked over at him. "Oh, Draco and I are back in classes" Hermione and Ron both stared at him. "Draco?" Ron said almost choking on his food. Hermione just smiled and looked down at her food. "Oh yeah, well wouldn't be nice to be on a last name basis with my roommate" Harry said smiling and poking at his food. "Just your roommate?" Hermione giggled. "Yes just my roommate, maybe a friend" Harry ate some of his food.
Harry turned and walked over to the Slytherin table. The Slytherin Table, Harry thought. He walked straight and proudly, confidently. He wasn't any of those things.
"Did I anger you Potter?" Draco said while placing his hand on harry's frail arm. He had never realized how small Harry really was. His height was not far off from Draco's but his body, his body was incredibly scrawny. Yes Draco wasn't the biggest boy but he was definitely bigger than harry, hell even Hermione seemed bigger than Harry. Harry was staring down at Draco's hand on his arm. Harry's heart rate quickened and his mouth went dry.
"Harry Potter." A tiny smile appearing in the corner of Draco's mouth. Harry stared at him, waiting for him to continue.
Although the spell failed, Bellatrix fell dead instead. Her body hitting the floor with a thud. Someone had killed her before she got the chance to finish speaking. Harry fell to his knees, shaking.
One spell did hit someone, a stupefy spell hit Narcissa. She fell unconscious. "Your own sister! You're evil!" Draco shouted at her.
Christmas Morning.
"Is this our first date?" Harry chuckled as he took a bite of his sandwich. "Yes Harry I believe it is" Draco smiled and looked up at the sky.
Draco returned with Snape. "Eager to get out of here are we?" Snape looked down to Harry and pulled out his wand to begin a proper inspection. Harry laid there impatiently waiting for Snape to finish. "I'm in no more pain, everything is steady. I would really like to get out of here" Harry looked around, this part of Hogwarts brought back bad memories.
"I'll see you later darling" Draco smiled and watched Harry leave. Draco got up, stretching.
Harry wanted to scream, cry, and punch something all at once. Nothing made sense to him. He wanted Draco so bad. Harry wouldn't let himself get hurt, so he decided to shut him out. Harry wanted to punch Draco square in the nose for making him so confused.
Moving day had finally come upon them.
Harry removed his glasses and placed them back on his night table. "Well I was lucky enough to stay out of your grip." Draco smirked. "You know what Malfoy you're just so sweet" Harry smiled. "What?" Draco looked at him. "It was sarcasm moron" Harry rolled his eyes.
"I know I know, I'm being silly" She smiled. "I won't keep you two any longer. Go start your lives together." She hurried them along with a large smile. They both chuckled and pulled her into a group hug. "We got you a moving out present." Harry said. "Oh yes I almost forgot, thank you darling" Draco smiled and ran inside. "What is it?" She asked.
Draco's head snapped towards the general direction of the doorway. Draco got out of the bed and stomped over to the person. Harry turned around to see who it was. "What the hell are you doing here? You're lucky I don't rip your face off!" Draco scowled. "I know you should I deserve it..I came here to apologize." Blaise said sincerely. At least he sounded sincere.
Draco felt a sudden wave of anger and concern wash over him. He wanted to comfort Harry and apologize for prodding into his life. He also wanted to insult Harry and make him feel bad. The feeling of concern overtook the feeling of anger.
"Fine. I did." Ginny messed around with a lock of her long red hair. "Why?" Harry spoke up and stepped a tiny bit closer to her. Draco grabbed Harry's wrist softly, not to agitate the scabbed over marks on his wrist. Harry stepped back. "I read your journal Harry." Ginny looked down at the floor and twiddled her thumbs.
"That was embarrassing" Harry threw a pillow over his head. Draco chuckled and leaned back on his elbows. "Why love?" Draco looked over at the pillow covering Harry's face.
"My mind"
It had taken him exactly 64 steps to reach Harry's bed that held Harry's limp body.
Harry's heart rate sped up. He tried not to let himself become too worried. Harry took a deep breath and opened the door to the study. "Draco?" Harry said shakily.
"Mum? What happened to the second floor?" He looked at her. Draco remembered his home having an open second floor, many bedrooms on this floor, and a long hallway with a bathroom at the end of it. "You'll see" She smiled and opened the door. She walked in and Draco and Harry followed. Draco's mouth hit the floor. Harry's did as well. It was stunning.
"Come up" Snape whispered into the dungeon. Narcissa and Harry both made their way up.
"Harry, please remember..well you know what now don't you?" Dumbledore remarked snidely but played it off as caring. Harry swallowed thickly and looked at his feet. He felt anger well up inside of him, tears stung his eyes. Harry quickly blinked back his tears. "..yes sir" Harry said dryly, sadly.
Draco snickered and they continued to walk.
"You have to come in with Snape, Lupin, and I. You know your home better than any of us. The rest shall stay on look out, and be back up in case we need it" Dumbledore motioned for Draco to come join them at the front. Draco took a deep breath and walked up.
"Why did you leave without telling me Potter" Draco said quietly so only Harry could hear. "You're not my keeper Malfoy, I don't have to tell you where i'm going." Harry scowled back.
He arrived in the great hall. He looked around but someone walked in front of him, barely blocking his view but they were there. "Malfoy, can I speak with you?" A voice said. He looked to see who it was. Louis. It was Louis, one of the only out people at Hogwarts. "Could it wait? I'm in a hurry" Draco said. "I just want to know how it's going with Potter" Louis said teasing him.
Scars.
"What are you doing over here Malfoy?" Ron asked. "Oh nothing just got bored of my Snakes." Draco said. "Sounds hard to believe" Ron snorted. Draco placed his hand  on Harry's upper thigh under the table. Draco softly moved his thumb along his inner thigh. Draco planned to tease Harry until he begged for more.
"Why didn't you tell them?" Ron looked down at Hermione as they walked out of the dorm. "I feel like it would be better if they just fell in love naturally and figured things out alone like we did, you know without all the pressure of us knowing" Hermione said walking hand in hand with Ron. "We hid it from Harry for like 2 years" Hermione snickered.
There was just one more room to check. The bathroom. Harry cautiously put his hand on the bronze doorknob. Harry closed his eyes and inhaled deeply while opening the door. He opened his eyes to find an empty bathroom.
"Ron, what?" Harry said trying not to laugh at his friend's stupidity. "He slept in your bed and you didn't shag? Impossible " Ron said staring at Harry. "No Ron we did not shag, he simply slept here in case I had another one." Harry said smiling. "God no I would never shag Potter that's disgusting" Draco made a revolted face. Hermione walked over to Harry and sat down. "So how's it going living in here?" She said trying to change the subject off of shagging.
Draco chuckled. "Third cupboard from the wall." He pointed out to the cupboard he was referring to. "Thank you." Hermione smiled and walked away, Draco shut the bedroom door again.
"He knows." Harry said quietly. "What?" Draco was now extremely confused. "He knows what they do to me, he doesn't try to stop it or help, he tells me to stick it out" Draco felt anger boiling in him. "He knows?!" Draco said getting up and running a hand through his hair.
Snuggling. Everything about it felt so right. Harry and Draco, Draco and Harry. Their bodies were made for each other. A match truly made in heaven.
"Harry it's not like that...it's not.." Draco was breathless. "Not like what? Like you were going to just give up and not talk about this with me?! It concerns me too Draco whether you think so or not." Harry continued yelling.
Harry kissed Draco's chin. "So that whole enemies with benefits went to shit didn't it?" Harry smiled and looked up at the ceiling. "It seems as if it did" Draco smiled.
"I know.. I know" Harry said softly into his shoulder and sniffled a little. Harry was so frantic, it made him look messy and unstable. Harry slowly unwrapped his arms from around Draco. "I'm sorry" Harry said clearing his throat. "For?" Draco said looking down at him.
Harry messily put on his shoes and speed walked to Snape's room. Snape must know where Draco is.
The two boys sleeping side by side in their warm bed had little to no idea anything would be happening. Anything tragic for that matter.
"What's got you all down in the dumps?" Pansy said taking a seat next to him. Draco chewed on the inside of his cheek, trying to remain calm. "Harry." Draco replied. "Thats it? Harry?" She looked at him.
Harry woke up a little while later to see Blaise standing over him. "Well hello there Harry" Blaise smiled down at him. Harry's brain felt fuzzy, he couldn't understand anything except for the fact that Blaise looked so...handsome.
Harry rolled his sleeve back down and huffed. He turned on his side and slowly closed his eyes, trying to silence the rude voices in his head.
"Well of course I can't do it now." Bellatrix rolled her eyes at the moron standing in front of her. "I never said do it now" Barty said annoyed as well. "I said do it soon." Barty said. "Leave me alone you wretched lizard. I told you I shall do it on Christmas." Bellatrix stuck her tongue out at him, mocking him.
They arrived and walked into Harry's room. "Ok open up my wardrobe and I'll tell you what to grab" Harry pointed over to his wardrobe. "Alright" Draco opened it up. "Give me three shirts" Draco pulled down three shirts that he liked the most and threw them onto Harry's bed. "Three pairs of pants" Draco picked his favorites and threw them. "Three pairs of boxers" Draco smirked and began sifting through Harry's under garments.
"I should kill him" Draco said getting angry again. "Draco, I will handle this accordingly you stay here with Potter" Snape winked and walked away swooshing his robes dramatically once more. Draco sat down and watched Harry. Harry was starry eyed and somewhere else in a daydream of Blaise.
Draco looked at him with concern. "What? What's wrong?" Draco stared at him. "I'm just so happy Dray." Harry nestled his face into Draco's chest. Draco relaxed and placed his arms around Harry. "Me too" Draco kissed the top of Harry's head.
"Okay Harry it's around..." Draco looked at the clock on their wall. "4:30" He said "Let's get dressed" Harry got up off of the warm couch and he strode off into the bedroom.
"How's Draco?" She looked up at Harry and continued walking. He followed walking side by side with her. "You know him?" Harry said while facing forwards, still holding onto his belongings. "Know him? That twit is my best friend" She giggled again. "Well he's doing fine." Harry smiled.
Harry let out a breath of relief and smiled as well. "I'll go change, be in your room in 5,"
Harry slowly rolled up his sleeves. Draco took his hand and turned it over so he could see his wrist. Draco saw two red scabbed lines on Harry's right wrist. He turned the other one over and saw two more red lines, one was not scabbed, it looked fairly new. That must've been what happened in the bathroom Draco thought.
"You know the only reason I actually suggested it was so I could attempt to get closer to you, it wasn't to just shag or anything" Draco said softly. "That's the only reason I agreed to it" Harry said back.
They had decided Harry would be the one to walk down the aisle. Although they would both have bouquets of flowers, deep red roses. Deep red against white snow is a beautiful scene. The time had come, Harry and Draco were at the venue in separate areas.
"Oh my god. Thank you so much." Harry reacted out of impulse and hugged Narcissa and Draco. They both hugged back warmly.
"Yay" Barty smirked and pulled out his wand.
Draco's eyes were beginning to pool with tears, he couldn't lose Harry. He couldn't lose the one person he cared of most. He couldn't lose the one person who completely him, the one person who filled the empty hole in his heart. Draco's heart was beating out of his chest, that was all he could hear.
Harry finally reached the alter. Draco took Harry's hands, Harry smiled up at Draco through his tears. "You look beautiful" Draco whispered with a smile. Harry's cheeks turned red and he chuckled.
Draco let out a soft sigh and smiled. Harry felt like he needed to cry. He had a strong urge to cut. He felt weak and sad. The reason why was unknown. Harry wanted to be loved, not just..used. He knew who Draco was, he knew Draco wouldn't use him. The fact that the thought even crossed Harry's mind made him sad. Harry zoned back into reality and saw Draco staring at him with a look of worry or panic.
"Friends with benefits?" Harry said staring at Draco. "Yes because then we can continue doing this" Draco smirked softly and removed his arm from Harry's waist and ran his thumb along Harry's bottom lip, wiping it. "But my only rule is, we must keep this between us" Draco said wiping his own lips now. "And no doing this with other people while we are" Harry said insistently.
Hopefully tonight would be a good night because of Draco, one without the night terrors.  He changed into his red pajamas and got into his bed. He snuggled into the covers trying to get comfortable. Harry must admit this bed was much bigger and more comfortable than the one in his old dorm.
Draco went into the only bathroom he could think of so he could find someone to talk to. The girls lavatory. "Myrtle?" Draco said shakily. He wiped his eyes. He would not cry over Harry Potter.
"Okay we'll see you at lunch Harry, bye" Ron and Hermione said bye at the same time. They really were soulmates Harry smiled.  Ron and Hermione walked in the opposite direction Harry was. Harry was going to sit in the library and think. He made his way to the back of the library and found a place to sit.
He wanted to make Harry forget all the pain. He wanted to make Harry feel good. His lips, mouth, and hands were the only thing Draco had to offer. Draco constantly thought he wasn't worth much other than that. No, scratch that Draco knew he wasn't worth much more than that.
Harry, Draco, Hermione, and Ron hadn't even noticed yet. Draco was the first to look up and see. "Oh my god" Draco said under his breath causing all of them to look. They all watched in awe. Confused as to how these two incredibly shy boys had come to do this.
Harry ignored the stares while Draco fed into them. Draco would hold Harry's hand or rub Harry's hip every time a new stare appeared. Draco was doing it to taunt them of course, but being touched by Draco in public was something Harry really appreciated.
Streams of tears falling down his and Harry's faces. All Harry could think of in that moment was the first time he truly saw Draco's eyes. All he could think of was how in love he fell. He could only think of every time Draco had comforted him, held him, kissed him. Draco had been there for Harry in his darkest hours. The love of Harry's life was ready to die for him.
He could hear a door shut and figured Malfoy went to his room. Harry sat down in the shower and tried not to cry once more about how ugly and weak he felt. He ran his hand through his hair and started washing himself. He ran his finger along each one of his ribs. Harry wanted to cry, break down, and hide. He wouldn't, not this time. He finished washing himself and got out.
Draco stood at the alter, nervously but happy. His heart was pounding out of his chest, he couldn't see any of the other people there. All he could focus on was the aisle, anxiously waiting for Harry to walk down it.
"No one knows? Oh I'm the first to know the dirty truth on Mr. Malfoy" Harry acted as if he was about to dramatically pass out. Draco hit his shoulder softly. "Mhm mhm" Draco mumbled smiling. Harry smiled, just like the sun.
Harry smiled. "What can I say? I'm just that good" Draco smiled smugly and Harry hit his shoulder.
A girl, with red hair, gryffindor robes. No doubt a Weasley, stoped in front of them. "Harry what are you doing with this muck. You shouldn't be associating yourself with this gay wanker." She stared at Harry. Harry was holding back his laughter. "Gay wanker, that's funny" Harry said and chuckled. "Well goodbye Ginny great talking to you" Harry pulled Draco away.
Draco finally pulled their faces together. Their lips meeting. Draco felt something that was like electricity go through his body. Harry melted into Draco's touch and let Draco explore his lips. Harry kept his hand tangled in Draco's hair. Harry was no longer in control of his body. They had both wanted this for so long that's what made it so special. Draco let his right arm fall to wrap around Harry's waist as well. Draco pulled their bodies together, closing whatever space was left between them.
"Get your hands off of him Zabini"  Draco said angrily. "Well why don't we ask Harry what he wants?" Blaise looked down at Harry. Harry just snuggled into Blaise. Draco felt confused, angry and sad. He felt his cheeks heat up and tears well in his eyes. Was this Harry's plan? The whole time to use him.
Harry sighed a little. "It's okay, I'm okay now" Harry didn't let go of Draco. Draco just smiled. Harry let out a soft breath and pulled away. "I never thought once in my life I would hug you" Draco chuckled. "And I never thought you'd be the first to find out just about everything there is to know about me" Harry smiled a little.
The big day finally arrived.
"Yeah but this is..different..Shakespeare's writing is just gorgeous, it all flows so sweetly" Draco whispered opening the book. Harry watched him open the book. "Mind if I read with you? You've sold it pretty well" Harry whispered back. "Knock yourself out" Draco scooted closer and made the book visible to Harry.
"I'm so sorry Draco, I know it looked bad but I made a promise and I would never break it, please don't be mad It wasn't my fault I would never do tha-" Draco kissed him deeply cutting him off. Harry kissed back resting his hand on Draco's shoulder. Draco pulled away and looked at Harry. "I know, i'm not mad at all , If anything I should be apologizing for the way I talked to you. I spoke on impulse...if you even remember" Draco said offering a smile.
~~Two years later~~
Blaise looked red as a tomato. "So you're into him?" Draco sat back up and looked at Blaise. "It's like how you were always into Harry. You know it's just always been there." Blaise smiled wider. Harry smiled as well. "I'm very happy for you" Draco smiled too.
Draco smiled in return and slowly removed his hands from Harry's. "If you need something come get me" Draco said getting up from Harry's bed. Harry sat up. "I will" Draco nodded and left the room.
They arrived at their dorm and walked in. "I'll get the book" Draco smiled and began walking away. Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him back. "What?" Draco looked down at him. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and laid his head on his chest. Draco held Harry tightly and sighed. "I know" Draco mumbled. Harry sighed as well. "I'm scared"
"I know you do and I'll be there with you for all of it. You're not nothing Harry! You're everything." Draco exclaimed. "Don't you get it moron? No one loves me! No one needs me! I'm nothing do you hear me?" Harry was crying once more.
"Oh my, you were gone for Merlin knows how long" Harry smiled at the familiar voice and wrapped up his cloak.
"Thank you." Harry said smiling. In all honesty he wanted her approval whether or not he would admit it. Harry hurt Ginny, he knew he did. He wanted to know she was okay with everything. Before Harry and Ginny had started dating, Ginny was one of his closest friends. Harry wanted that back and maybe he would get it back someday.
The next week would surely be a breeze. Family fun, their friends all getting along. It would truly be the calm before quite a storm. The days leading up to Christmas would all be fantastic and full of love. The day of Christmas, may bring much else than love. Sorrow. Pain. Despair.
"I know he will" Harry smiled. "So, seems we'll be here for a while. Tell me all about you and him" She smiled trying to lighten the mood. "Is he a proper gentleman?" She looked at Harry. "Yes he truly is" Harry nodded and chuckled. They continued to talk about anything that involved Draco and Harry. She was so interested in how her son was doing and how he was treating Harry. It put a little light on the dark situation.
It opened before he could make it. It was Hermione and Ron. "Figured we'd find you here" Ron chuckled. "You wankers scared me. Don't do that" Draco walked back over to Harry's bed and sat down.
Harry dropped the robe he had put on and slowly stepped into the tub. Once he was in the bubbles covered him completely. "you're so gorgeous" Draco said under his breath. "Why don't you join me love, you must be a little stressed to-" Harry was cut off by a knock at the door.
Draco immediately knew something was wrong. He opened the door to find a now fully dressed Harry sitting on the floor with his head in his hands, a blade next to him. It was clean, it had no blood on it. Meaning he didn't do what he clearly wanted to do. Draco just stood in the doorway, shocked at what he was seeing.
"Let me see maybe I can identify this 'spell' that went wrong" Hermione smiled and pulled Harry's collar down. "Oh yes I recognize this one" Hermione said smiling and looking at Ron mischievously. "It's the 'Harry has love bites' one" Hermione laughed and Ron did as well. Harry turned a deeper shade of red and pulled his collar back up. "So we were intruding earlier" Ron said chuckling and shoving more food in his mouth.
Harry pushed past Draco and started walking to his room when he grabbed onto the mantle of the fireplace. He was woozy and groggy. Draco came over to him. "I feel it's only right if I see you off to your room. So I know you're actually in your bedroom and not wandering off into mine" Draco snickered and watched Harry go into his room. Draco made sure Harry actually made it to his room.
Harry got quiet once more and re-adjusted his sitting position so he was closer again, but not as close. Not too close, but close enough. "No, no it was not I..I like that they came in, I didn't mind at all" Harry said looking anywhere and everywhere but Draco's eyes.
"Not as much as Malfoy will" Ron snickered. Draco chuckled. "Shut up Ron" Harry said playfully. "He's not wrong" Draco smirked. Harry blushed and turned his attention down to his food. Hermione smiled at the two of them. "How were classes yesterday?" Draco asked Ron. He was trying to make civil conversation. "Quite boring really, just like everyday" Ron smiled.
Just Draco and Harry remained standing in the hallway. "Journal huh?" Draco looked down at Harry smirking.
"Listen it's not something I enjoy talking about Malfoy.. No one knows and i don't ever want anyone to know..can you please keep this between us, and whatever you do, do not tell Hermione or Ron" Harry looked at him pleading. "I don't see the big deal Potter." Draco said but he looked like he had more to say, turns out he did.
Back in the dorm Draco had come back to Harry's room because he was still confused at what Hermione's whole revelation was about. Plus he just wanted to be around Harry. "Well how about we stop talking about her and start talking about something else." Draco suggested sitting back down on Harry's bed. "Alright well what about?" Harry said sitting down.
Ron and Hermione walked to their dorm. "Somethings wrong I know it" Ron said and followed Hermione. "Malfoy hasn't given us a dirty look since last year" Ron continued. Hermione and Ron finally arrived in front of their dorm. "Here's to hoping they didn't change the password yet." Hermione said and walked up to the painting, whispering the password.
They arrived in the great hall and took their seats. They had arrived just in time. Dumbledore had just finished giving one of his boring speeches to the first years. Harry caught a glance of the Slytherin table where he met eyes with a certain Slytherin, Malfoy, who was staring at him with a look of arrogance as always. Harry found himself admiring the platinum blonde hair atop his head and his rosy red lips. He caught himself and tore his gaze away from Malfoy. Harry was straight. Right?
It had taken him only 64 steps to reach the start of the rest of his life.
Draco licked along Harry's bottom lip basically begging for entrance. Harry happily and immediately obliged. Draco's tongue entered Harry's mouth desperately searching it. Draco had yearned for this for so long, it was hard to believe it was actually happening.
Harry walked up to Snape's desk taking his place next to Draco. Snape looked up at the two boys trying not to smile. They both looked so..smitten. "What's this problem?" Snape asked looking at Harry. Harry took a deep breath.
"So you're telling me you enjoy kissing all
Harry looked back and smiled waking up to Draco. "Oh thank you Draco" Harry took his glasses and put them on. "I like that" Draco said softly. "What?" Harry looked up at him. Draco smiled.
Harry moaned quietly. Just as Draco reached the waist band of Harry's pants, a knock at the door. Draco rolled his eyes. "God never can go un interrupted can we?" Harry sighed and chuckled slightly.
"No I do not sleep walk Malfoy. We will figure this out in the morning. Good bye" Harry scowled. Draco got up and opened his door for Harry to leave. It hadn't hit Draco yet that he was the one who had brought Harry there.
"How did that bloke find out the new password?" Harry said looking up at Draco, changing the subject back to Dumbledore. "He's always listening, who knows." Draco said, clearly annoyed. "What the bloody hell is going on here?" Ron asked again "I had a night terror, Malfoy heard and came to help." Harry simply said. "So what then? One night of living together and you're already shagging?" Ron said scoffing.
Harry let a tear run down his cheek. He ran his hand through Draco's soft silky hair.
Harry's nails dug into Draco's shoulders as he bottomed out.
He boarded the train with his friends and finally relaxed for the first time since school let out before summer. This summer had been the worst in a few years. His so very loving aunt and uncle had been worse than ever. Not to mention his cousin was a twat as usual. He had been hit, treated like a slave, shoved in a cupboard, although that part was normal, and touched in ways he shouldn't have been sometimes by his Uncle Vernon. His rotten, foul, nasty, Uncle Vernon.
Draco went into Harry's room quietly. He walked over to the bed. "Potter" He said in a normal tone. Harry made no move or reaction to his words. Draco took Harry's hand and gave it a little squeeze. "Wake up" Draco said a tiny bit louder. Harry groaned and his eyes fluttered open. "What" Harry said softly and put a pillow on his face shielding his eyes from the light. "I brought food" Harry sat up and rubbed his eyes.
Draco sucked one a little lower. Harry let out a loud moan when Draco's lips hit that spot on his neck. He had found Harry's sweet spot. Draco smirked softly against Harry's neck and sucked on this spot intently and gently. Draco held Harry, he held Harry like he never wanted to let go.
"Yes go talk to him" Hermione smiled and shooed him away just as he had done to Draco a few moments ago. Harry collected himself and stood up slowly. His palms were becoming clammy. Hermione nodded and turned to Ron, swatting his hand away from her food.
"Let's go." Snape said. They walked up to the front door of the Manor. Draco grabbed his wand and pointed it at the door. "Alohomora" He whispered. A series of locks began clicking open. It took five locks to open before the tall dark door was fully unlocked. Dumbledore stepped in first. He looked around, studying the manor.
"That was no reason to invade my personal life and out me." Draco snapped at her. Ginny sighed. "It was wrong of me to do that and I know that, it was also wrong of me to call you two the f word. I'm sorry." Ginny sounded sincere enough. "I still don't like all of this but I guess I will try to get used to it." She continued.
"Like him? Merlin I have the biggest knot in my stomach, I've been crying for the last two hours, and I can barely focus on anything. He's the only bloody thing running through my mind." Draco clenched his fist as he slowly got more and more worked up over what his father had done.
"Harry remember you're mature enough to handle this." Hermione smiled and lead Ron out of the hall. Harry watched them go as he heard a slow clap behind him. "Awe such a sweet moment within the golden trio" A voice who he immediately identified to be Draco's, taunted him.
"Yay" Barty smirked and pulled out his wand.
When Harry opened his eyes he was standing in front of a place that haunted every single corner of his brain. He shook his head and took a deep breath. Draco, he thought. Harry remembered Draco and made his way up to knock on the door. It took him 64 steps to reach the door mat. His aunt opened it before he could knock. "Enter" She said coldly. Harry took a small deep breath and made his way inside. He looked around and memories came flooding back. Awful sad ones.
"I'm hungry" Harry grumbled and turned on his side. The empty feeling in his stomach had finally hit him. "We can eat dinner in the hall with your friends?" Draco questioned. "Snape said no" Harry looked up at Draco. "Who cares?" Draco chuckled and leaned back into the couch.
"Need some help?" Draco smiled and helped Harry place the trunk by the doorway. "Thank you" Harry kissed Draco's cheek and ran into Draco's bedroom. Harry must've changed while he was packing because he was now in his pajamas instead of the sweatshirt and joggers Draco had given him after his shower.
Harry subtly took Draco's tie in his hand "Well, I'll be going back to the dorm...you can join me if you please" He slid his hand off of Draco's tie and got up making his way to the doors. Draco bit his lip and watched Harry walk away. Something about Harry made Draco lose control.
He sat there and just let himself bleed. He looked down at his wrist and cried more. Harry hated what he was doing to himself, but he couldn't stop. He could never stop.
"Of course I will you big sap" He could barely get his words out from crying. Harry kneeled to Draco's level and threw his arms around him. Draco kissed Harry's cheek and then his lips. "I love you, I love you" Harry smiled and kissed Draco again. Draco pulled the ring out of the box and slipped it onto Harry's finger.
Draco was walking through the library when he saw a certain raven haired boy. He walked closer trying to see if it really was Harry. It was. Draco took a seat next to him. Harry looked up from his boom startled.
"I had this place renovated so you two could have a place to stay out of Hogwarts. Like your own little house" Narcissa sniffled, she was so happy they had each other. "Oh my mum it's amazing" Draco felt tears prickle in his eyes. Harry was just frozen and speechless staring at the gorgeous place in front of his eyes.
Draco wouldn't be able to sleep well knowing Harry might be thrashing, crying, and scared. Draco opened Harry's door again. "And none of that" Draco said. "Oh, okay" Harry said not protesting one bit. Draco smiled softly. "Goodnight" Harry said smiling. "Goodnight Potter" Draco closed the door and went to his room.
Draco walked into their bedroom, then remembered something Harry had said.
"Wouldn't you like to know" Myrtle giggled and twirled her hair. "Myrtle this is serious. What happened next" Draco said sternly.
Draco pulled Harry's shirt over his head and threw it to the side. Harry dropped his head into the pillow and arched his back as Draco's lips made contact with his skin. Draco trailed his hands along Harry's bare skin.
"Draco Malfoy. My boy. I can't imagine my life without you. I don't know how I lived so long without you...You know those days when everything feels dark, like the weight of the world is crushing you. Like you can't breathe? You are my breath of fresh air. You are the reason i'm still alive. There was always something in my heart telling me one day we would end up here. I tried to tell my heart to just shut it. That didn't work. I'm glad it didn't work, I wouldn't be half the man I am today without you Dray. I love you" Harry took many pauses within his vows. Harry kept getting all choked up.
"What about?" Harry stood his ground. "Well, I will elaborate in private. Draco would you mind going to your room?" Dumbledore turned his gaze over to Draco. "No. I think I'll stay right here" Draco smiled mischievously and looked at Dumbledore.
"So it's after dinner, wheres the promised amazing time in which I received a much appreciated preview for?" Harry smirked innocently. Draco bit his lip and took off his tie.  Harry slowly walked forward. Both of their eyes filled with a burning lust.
"She's really being an angel" Harry said as he scrubbed dishes next to Draco. "Yeah, I actually believe her sob story now about how Voldemort was controlling her" Draco dried the dishes after Harry was finished with the washing. "Darling I'm tired" Harry yawned and rubbed his eyes. "How about we go send the letters to everyone coming to dinner tomorrow and then go to sleep?" Draco came up behind Harry, rubbing his sides.
Harry began crying silently, he thought he had put this all behind him. Harry's mind could not even begin to focus on one thing, so much was running through it. His tears wetting his cheeks.
"Of course mum" Draco kissed her cheek. "Now go on!" She pulled away. "Okay okay we're going" Harry chuckled. He walked to the passengers seat of the truck and hopped in. Draco was walking away, but Narcissa grabbed his arm softly. "Take care of him okay?" She said with a soft smile. "I would do anything for him." Draco replied with a smile as well.
Draco and Harry both breathing unsteady, their lips not touching. Just their bodies. Their fully clothed bodies. Draco had enough of the wait, he ran his right hand up to Harry's cheek. Draco softly caressed Harry's hip with his left hand as well. Draco knew just what Harry would like. Harry bit his bottom lip softly. Draco slowly pulled Harry's face closer and stopped when their lips were almost touching. "Scared potter?" Draco whispered. "You wish" Harry smirked softly.
That was a lie. Draco was extremely nervous.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek. He didn't like the way Harry's friends talked so highly of his family. Of course they didn't know but it was still odd to hear her talk to greatly of a family who abused Harry.
Everything began moving in slow motion for Draco. His fight or flight instinct immediately kicking in. Draco backed up and wrapped his arms around Harry, keeping Harry behind him. Harry held Draco's arms. "I love you" Harry whispered into Draco's ear. Draco looked back at Harry with tears in his eyes.
Harry rose to his feat, Draco watched with his hand still entwined with Harry's. Draco grabbed his wand and stood up as well. Draco was willing to fight, to die for Harry. "Ah looks like we'll have a fair duel after all" Bellatrix clapped cheerfully.
Hermione and Ron had announced their relationship after the Battle of Hogwarts concluded. They had been hiding it from Harry for about two years. Harry was rather angry when he found out they were hiding from him. Once he got over his anger, it was replaced with happiness for his two best friends. Some sadness for the lonely life he lived. How beautifully lonely it truly was.
Neville, Blaise, Hermione, and Ron had arrived to the Manor.
"Wow I really exhausted you didn't I? Since it's my fault, I guess I can wake you for dinner Potter" Draco said smiling "Promise you'll wake me?" Harry asked looking up at him. "Promise i'll wake you Potter" Draco said smiling. "Okay Malfoy" Harry mumbled and drifted off to sleep. "Anything for you" Draco whispered softly and watched him.
"We've got two weeks off love make sure you pack enough" Draco said and rubbed his tired eyes. "Go pack so we can cuddle up when we're both done" Harry encouraged Draco to stop being lazy in a kind way. Draco groaned and dragged himself into his room. He carelessly packed his things.
Harry grabbed a piece of parchment and wrote a letter asking if he could skip today. He sent Hedwig off with it. Harry made his way into his own room. He removed his shoes and robes.
"I know it's ugly" Harry whispered, buttoning up his shirt as fast as he could. That just resulted in him fumbling with the buttons not being able to button them fast at all. Draco reached out and moved Harry's hand from the buttons. "I know i'm ugly" Harry said in a hushed tone.
Hermione hugged Harry as well. "I'll see you around. Be safe ok?" She said as she smiled and walked out the door. Harry closed the door once they were gone, and locked it.
Draco still felt uneasy and got up to go check on Harry. He had promised himself he wouldn't be sweet on Harry, but he needed to make sure Harry was okay.
Hermione began talking to Ron about how class is not 'boring' it's just not for the weak minded. Draco chuckled and ate his food. Harry ate as well. Harry ate quite a bit considering he knew he wouldn't be well
Ron was going to be sick.
"My bag, I have floo powder" Hermione said sniffling and reached through her bag. She pulled it out. Lupin grabbed it and threw it into the fireplace. Draco was sobbing, a complete mess. He was holding Harry's hand so tightly.
"I wouldn't continue testing me, I could ruin you Harry Potter" Draco smirked. Harry bit the inside of his cheek, trying not to let his mind wander. "No, no way" Harry wanted him to.
They left and Harry lifted his head back up. "We really have got to change that password" Harry smiled and ran his fingers along the other side of his neck. Draco rubbed his hand along Harry's back. He could tell Harry was tired or..worn out.
Barty had been sent to Azkaban. Narcissa made a full and speedy recovery. Draco could never recover, he could never recover from this silence. There was never any sound of Harry's breathing, or Harry's laughter, or his voice. Draco would give his life to hear Harry once more.
"No, no he's wrong. You don't deserve to be alone, I know there are plenty of people who are willing to risk dying for you." Draco chuckled a little. "I doubt it" Harry whimpered.  "I know I would" Draco said softly. Harry smiled.
"Gross. What do you two faggots need?" Ginny crossed her arms and stared at them. Harry clenched his fists, as did Draco. "Watch your mouth 'little sis'" Ron happened to be passing by with Hermione.
"What did you feel when you saw it was Harry?" Hermione said and Harry looked at her questionably. "I felt like I needed to do something, I mean if someones thrashing around like a wild beast and crying I'm not  just gonna stand there and let it happen." Draco said shrugging once more.
Draco laid his head down on the bed and slowly fell asleep waiting for Harry to wake up. Draco dreamt of home, he dreamt of Harry, he dreamt of happiness.
"My uncles way of punishing me was...much worse. The first time it happened was a few years back when dinner was missing a side dish he had asked for. My uncle..got up from the table and dragged me away to my room by the collar of my shirt" Harry took a deep breath.
Harry adjusted the way he was sitting trying to remove Draco's hand. "Well then, how is your dorm?" Hermione asked trying to be nice. "It's very nice, the rooms are huge, the bathroom is stunning, the beds...the beds are comfy" Draco smirked. Draco turned his face away as if he was looking back over at Slytherin table.
"You cannot just do that Dray I was so scared I thought I'd lost you again. At least leave a note or somethi-" Harry was cut off by Snape clearing his throat. Draco turned back around as did Harry.
"Dumbledore knows what has been happening he just tells Harry to 'stick it out'" Draco said angrily. "Of course the bloody moron did, I'll take care of this" Snape said. "But for now let me clean these bruises up" Snape pulled out his wand and started mumbling healing spells.
With Love,
The rest of the gifts really weren't mentioning, just funny little things. Gifts lining up with inside jokes between Harry and Hermione and Ron. They had gotten the others small cute things. Everyone had finally finished opening their gifts and saying their thank you's.
"No love I don't want to put you out" Harry said and got up, dragging himself to his wardrobe. "I insist" Draco smiled and walked into the bathroom, turning the water on. He grabbed some candles and positioned them around the tub.
They arrived there at three-thirty p.m. Draco had surprised Harry with a beautiful penthouse suite. A large window overlooking the city, Harry could see the Eiffel Tower from his bedroom.
"I love you" Draco said right before he fell asleep. "I love you too Dray" Harry said back in a whisper and fell asleep. Draco let out a breath  of stress. He knew Harry was right, everything did feel too right. Draco knew things didn't just work out for him or Harry. He was just waiting for whatever bad thing was going to happen next.
You knew I would never stay locked up for long didn't you? I know about your little love affair. You probably thought I wouldn't find out, son you should know by now I know everything. End it with him, before I end him myself. I don't plan on returning to Azkaban anytime soon, they won't know where to find me. Just remember I know exactly where to find you and your little lover boy. I want what's best for you.
"Draco" Harry smiled. Draco hadn't heard him. He continued arguing with his father. "You took him for what?!" Draco yelled.
Four times.
"No Sir i'm not i'm sorry.." Harry said backing away "You will be sorry" His uncle got up and unbuckled his belt sliding it off. Harry gulped and starting backing away faster. His uncle caught up to him and whipped him with the belt. His back was red and scarred from what his wretched uncle had done.
He sat down after getting his food and slowly ate. The food looked completely unappetizing, Draco could barely manage to swallow it.
Harry stared at Bellatrix. "Didn't you try to kill me?" Harry crossed his arms. "Guilty" Bellatrix put her hand up as if she was taking accountability. "And I'm sorry. I was under the influence of Voldemort, I thought I was doing the right thing. Now I know I wasn't. I did kill some, my biggest regret being tonks. That whole point in my life is a blur..I barely remember doing anything that I did." She looked lost in thought, full of sadness and despair.
"Better start packing you two, you leave for break on Monday" Snape said. "It's been moved up this year, Dumbledore thinks it's best for some reason. He won't explain why, but I guess it works out for the students they get more time off" Snape chuckled slightly. Snape chuckling was a rare  and enjoyable sight.
"Oh no, daddy is just trying to get you dressed for Nan's house" Harry said and picked James up, then placed him on the floor in front of him. Draco walked towards him and James began running again, back and forth in their bedroom. "I'm gonna get you" Draco teased and 'chased' James. He looked at Harry and winked. Harry just laughed the whole time.
"No it's not stupid Potter, I mean you are stupid but, I've had night terrors it's not a fun thing to be alone for" Draco said softly. Frankly, Draco didn't want to be alone either. He climbed into Harry's bed. Harry made a mental note to ask Draco about his terrors.  "God this place is disgusting all the red and gold makes me sick" Draco said looking around. "And green is just soo much bette-" Harry started to come back at Draco's previous remark but was cut off.
Draco walked into the great hall and shot Granger and Weasley a dirty look. He was really trying his hardest to be his old self. It wasn't as easy as it used to be. He sat down at his table and made a plate.
Harry just stood there and watched him leave. Harry wondered what he had said or done. His mind was spinning, he turned back and walked back into their dorm. Harry was in a state of shock, he plopped down onto the couch. His brain hurt, as did his heart. He felt like a pathetic little school boy with a broken heart. Harry didn't feel like going to class today. He needed to think over what had just happened. He knew Dumbledore would let him skip, he had Dumbledore under his spell somehow.
"I know he is, I hate him as much as you do, but if Harry falls in love with him or something we have to be nice. I mean come on ever since the Battle of Hogwarts things have been...different." Hermione said still reading.
He looked back to his own table questioning what the bloody hell he had just done. It was odd how often Harry caught himself taking a peek at the Slytherin Table. It's not like it was for anyone certain. Harry looked back to see if they were causing any trouble. Yeah that was it, that was the excuse Harry was going to go with for today.
Harry blushed and sat down. "Alright well, I was out on the grounds walking around minding my business when I run into someone, a girl. I ask her who she is. She says How's draco. I ask her her name. She says Pansy Parkinson" Harry stopped for a breath. Draco sat down as well.
There wasn't much else going on around it. On the right side of the door there was a Gryffindor flag, on the left side was a Slytherin flag. They had clearly already prepared for their arrival. "The password is Phoenix as of now..you boys can change it to whatever you please" Dumbledore said then he repeated the password to the painting which happened to be Salazar Slytherin. Harry thought that Dumbledore hated that guy.
Everyone had come up separately to congratulate the newly weds. It was truly a beautiful and significant day.
"Because Malfoy, because" Harry said angrily, but with a hint of need and despair. A need to show Draco. Draco took a breath to keep himself calm. "I'm sorry I shouldn't keep pushing. If you don't want to, that's fine I won't push you to do something you don't want to" Draco whispered. Harry was fragile and he could tell. Draco was usually very good at reading people. He always knew what the right things to say were. But with Harry he would always somehow be at a loss for words. Draco couldn't read Harry, his eyes had many scattered emotions and thoughts swimming through them.
"Will do sir- Sev, sorry" Harry shook his head. Draco was smiling. "Now what has happened this time?" Snape looked down at Harry, examining the boy. "My rib cage and my shin" Harry said. Harry's shirt was still on the floor. Snape studied the bruise on Harry's rib cage. He mumbled healing incantations while reviewing it. Snape looked down to Harry's shin. Draco got down and softly rolled up Harry's pant leg.
"Okay, well you're a Gryffindor" Blaise said. Draco laid down, his upper half on Harry's legs. He crossed his hands and twiddled his thumbs. "Well yes" Harry chuckled. "Do you know Neville?" Blaise asked sheepishly. Blaise seemed to grow smaller when he mentioned Neville's name.
Harry walked into the bathroom and was hit with the soothing scent of the bath. "Thank you Dray" Harry smiled and kissed Draco softly, laying his hand on the back of Draco's neck. "Of course love anything for you" Draco smiled down at Harry.
Draco shrugged and moved even closer, a mere few inches of space between them. Harry swallowed thickly and held in a deep breath. Harry felt a need to kiss Draco, to feel his lips, his touch. Draco's breath had gone unsteady. Harry's breathing was altered as well. Draco slid two fingers under Harry's chin so they could make eye contact. Draco tried his best to keep his hand from shaking. He felt Harry's breath hitch and Draco smirked.
Hermione and Ron had ran over as well. Narcissa was holding her son who was holding Harry. Harry soon couldn't take the pain, he passed out. Draco cried. Hermione cried and Ron held her. Ron was watching his best mate bleed to death. He could barley look, Ron buried his face in Hermione's shoulder.
"And that's about where we are now" Draco concluded. "Well I am very proud of you for figuring out who you are and what you want, if I must say I am not surprised it was Potter" Snape said. "Really why?" Draco looked at him. "There was always something there I just never wanted to believe it was Potter" Snape chuckled. "Well it is, it always has been" Draco smiled softly.
Draco smiled a little. "I'm glad he chose me too" Draco stared down at Harry. "If he wakes up come get me. I'm going to eat quick I promise"
Harry and Draco's love was even stronger than before, everything that happened to the two of them on that awful Christmas evening left an imprint on their hearts.
