“Delores Umbridge? The head of the Muggle Born Registration Commission? What did she want from you?” A middle-aged witch looked down her nose at Harry and Draco felt a spike of irritation.
“Thank you, but nice try.” She laughed. “You need to look nice too!”
“Figure what out?” Draco’s voice sounded behind him and Harry shuffled over to make room for him. “Good morning, Mother.”
"Ok!" Teddy agreed easily before wandering off to the next exhibit.
“Forcing me to order for you.” His expression softened with a teasing smirk. “Now if you hate it, it’s all my fault.”
"It will be a nice distraction for both of us." He muttered, rubbing soothing circles on Draco's arms.  Draco sank into the comfort.
“What’s there to talk about?” he glared sullenly at the shower drain, watching the water circle it once before disappearing forever.
“What do you want?”
“Are you joking?” Granger gave her a calculating look.
“Ah, I see.” Draco smirked. “And all of the trivia?”
“I’m doing fantastic.” He grinned, kneeling in front of the flames so he could talk to her properly. “You look as lovely as ever. How are you?”
“Great, that means you have time to help me with mine.” Harry quipped.
“Shame, that.” Draco planted a quick kiss on Harry’s temple.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat as his fingers fumbled with the mokeskin pouch around his neck. He pulled the snitch Dumbledore had left him and put it up to his mouth. The familiar writing materialized.
“Can’t we do this later?” Draco winced. He didn’t have the emotional capacity to deal with any of this bullshit.
"Of course I do. It's perfectly natural for people who have lost what we have lost, Harry."
Now that Pansy put the damned idea in his head he couldn’t help but envision spinning Harry across the dance floor, his head on Draco’s chest as they held each other tightly. He couldn’t stop himself from dreaming about stealing kisses under the mistletoe after they danced until they were sore. Or taking a moonlight stroll on the grounds to cool down, holding hands, and just being content to be with each other. Draco wanted it. He wanted it so much his heart felt like it would break.
"That's quite a lot to process." His father sighed deeply, sparing Harry a curious glance before turning back to Draco. "Somehow this isn't how I envisioned a night at the ballet going when you gave me those tickets."
Well, there went that idea.
He knew he was rich now, and that if he converted all of his gold into muggle money he would have a lot more than Draco was holding, but he had still never seen so many banknotes in his life. It had to be at least a thousand pounds. Why did Draco carry such a large amount of muggle money?
“Snacks?” Ron perked up at the mention of food.
“He makes you happy?” Seamus pressed.
“Here’s to us, the best of friends, and if we tend to disagree fuck you, and here’s to me!” Harry grinned as they clinked their beers.
“Yeah, they are. They’re marked.” Seamus gave him an odd look, but it only incensed him further.
“-attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah. I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him! Did it ever occur to you to keep some of the Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety! Wouldn’t it have been smarter to keep them here?” The disembodied voice sounded again. It was oddly familiar and yet completely strange to Draco.
“Go ahead, try something you wouldn’t normally get.” He smiled when their eyes met and Harry suddenly had to remind himself to breathe.
"That would be appreciated, yeah." Harry said slowly.
“Don’t be difficult.” Draco glared at him, the black eyeliner making his eyes smolder.
Harry gave her a weak smile before turning to look at Ron. He was standing ramrod straight with a frightened expression playing at his pale features. Hermione was watching them apprehensively, her eyes flicking from one face to the other like she was following a tennis match.
He had been on three dates with Harry already, and countless non-dates before that.
They started circling each other at the exact same moment and Draco rushed to pull his mother and himself out of their path.
“He says he can hear it.” She frowned, studying the waterfall in her hands. “I wonder if I could charm this to run off magic instead?”
“Over a decade?” He couldn’t stop the idiotic grin he could feel curling his lips.
The pain of losing everything.
“Of course I did, we still have a whole day to spend together.” Harry felt his stomach flutter at the way Draco’s face lit up.
“I haven’t seen Potter show any preference either way. He might be gay for all we know. Skeeter is a lying cow.” Theo said in a low voice, bending over his fish and chips so he could talk discreetly.
Inside were multiple rows of oil paints and every type of paintbrush Draco could imagine. Pansy must have cast an undetectable extension charm on it to fit everything in. There was a small note nestled behind the brushes and Draco pulled it out, grinning like a fool at Pansy’s thoughtfulness.
“This is only the beginning.” Harry smiled.
“They didn’t have a choice! You have no idea what they went through- you don’t know them at all! Where do you get off judging them?”
Kingsley poured three drops of the flavorless potion on his tongue, giving Harry a wane smile. Harry returned it then took his seat at the witness stand while they waited for the potion to take effect. The entire room was still staring at him and he was just beginning to feel jittery. He wished they would stop. A few moments later, everything that had been worrying him or making him uncomfortable ceased to matter. It wasn’t quite like being under the imperious curse, there wasn’t any of that blissful calm feeling. It was more like his entire perspective shifted so that all of the eyes on him no longer mattered. The only thing that mattered was the truth. It was paramount that the truth be told.
“Pansy, stop!” Hermione laughed. “I fancy you, too.”
He changed into the outfit she had picked out for him and frowned at his reflection. Even if he thought he was still too thin, the shirt fit him for the most part and the shorts hung to his knees the way he liked. He had put on some muscle during Auror training, but he was more lean and wiry than bulky like most of his coworkers and he’d be lying if he said it didn’t bother him.
“Story?” Harry’s expression became puzzled and Draco didn’t know what to make of it.
“Well, yeah. That’s a start. Maybe not the ‘hating each other’ part, but you two were friendly enough during that dinner the day they got out.” Ron said bracingly.
“Doesn’t the Elder wand need to be taken by force to change allegiance?” A young wizard in horn-rimmed glasses asked eagerly as if this were a lively lecture on wand lore.
Harry buried a snort of amusement in Teddy's hair. Having heard the opposite said to him on countless occasions he was happy to not be on the receiving end for once.
“No press? Or idiotic Potter-rotters?” He was close to caving. She could sense it.
“You provided a service, let me compensate you for it.” She narrowed her eyes quizzically. Arimere had never turned down any type of revenue before.
“Thank you, I just moved in fully this past week.” He tried to keep his tone light and friendly.
“I have.” He sniffed.
“Glad you could make it, Pansy.” Harry stepped forward to greet them.
“We honestly expected you to,” Fred agreed “you hadn’t given any prior indication that you were even slightly bent.”
“That’s alright, I’ll host your housewarming party. All you have to do is come out of your house and onto the beach and let the guests use your bathroom when necessary. Oh, this is going to be wonderful! Make sure you get next weekend off!”
“Something to get rid of the horcruxes.” The Weasel said in a very matter of fact tone.
That’s what he would do. He would find Hermione, tell her he got tossed in the pool, and take an early leave. She couldn’t possibly be upset with that. He opened the door with an air of confidence. He didn’t have to stay at this stupid party. He was Harry freakin Potter. As soon as he stepped out of the bathroom, however, his plans were derailed.
A fresh set of paints and brushes for my favorite artist. The rest of your present is already set up in the living room. Love, Pansy
He shouldn’t go free, he knew that. Now that it was a very real possibility, however, he wanted it more than anything. He wanted to chat with his mother about the article and the likelihood that all three of them would be granted freedom, but he knew better than to push his luck. Gerald had risked enough giving all three of them a Daily Prophet. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't seem to focus on anything so he contented himself with dreaming of what it would be like to be truly free.
“Fuck off, Parkinson. I don’t-”
“I do?”
"I wanted to give you some tickets for opening night. Give them to your friends and family. It's my way of thanking you for making this production a reality for me." She beamed, handing him two thick slips of rectangular paper.
“Can I hold onto it? I would really like to study it, see what information I can glean about this tortured soul before I meet him.”
"Ah, well, I suppose there is Theo. He's about the only real relationship I've ever had, but we never went on any dates. The rest of them were flings and one-night stands so I don't think they count." Draco could feel the blush in his cheeks spreading to his neck and ears.
Harry snorted at that.
No sooner had the goosebumps risen on his skin, George was pressed behind him, trailing kisses up and down his neck as Fred plundered his mouth. The sensation was almost overwhelming. Harry couldn’t get enough. All too soon, they pulled away at the same time.
“Good answer.” Ari nodded curtly. “Needless to say, you hurt him, I'll hurt you. I don’t give a damn if you’re the Chosen One. Have you got that?”
“Alright, are we going to play, or what?” Dean demanded, snapping him out of his reverie.
“What? Proud of you? Immensely so.”
It was funny where life had taken them.
It was just a dream.
“Harry! Wait!” Kingsley called but he didn’t care.
Zack frowned at him before changing the subject. No one could understand his stark defense of the Malfoys. To be honest, Harry didn’t completely understand it himself. He just knew that it was wrong to send them off to Azkaban when they did so much to help him.
He couldn’t believe that had worked.
"I won't." He promised.
“I can be both of your best friends.” Pansy rolled her eyes.
He pulled Harry into his arms and kissed his hair. If Harry wasn’t ready he wouldn’t push him. Harry wrapped his arms securely around Draco’s waist and muttered something unintelligible into his shoulder.
“Sort of.” Harry took a sip of his sugary soda. “I had a rough idea of where I wanted to take you, Hermione just helped me narrow it down and fed me interesting facts. I had originally planned on spending more time at Westminster. I thought checking out the palace and touring Parliament sounded brilliant, but that security guard sort of put a wrench in those plans.”
“You still let him.”
“Nice?” Harry narrowed his eyes at him, seeming unsure if Draco was joking or not.
Before Draco was even aware of what was happening two wizards had grabbed him from behind and held him still while the others swarmed around him. A number of people gave him a swift kick anywhere they could reach while others opted to use their fists. There were some, however, that must have been unsatisfied with the spittle falling short because they made sure to hit him this time around.
They worked well together. Zack Gryffin had been his partner since they both joined the force and Harry had grown rather fond of them. They were level headed where Harry was reckless, and passionate when Harry was apathetic. They balanced each other out. Zack was also a genius at paperwork. Harry completed one document for every three of theirs. By the time Zack decided it was time for lunch they were almost halfway through the stack.
They each looked a lot healthier than they had after the battle. Draco had grown his hair out. Harry didn’t know if it was by choice or by force, but he liked it. He looked softer somehow. In place of his usually carefully arranged locks his hair was wavy and slightly tousled. Draco's eyes met his for the briefest of seconds before Draco looked away, flushing slightly. He no longer looked gaunt and the dark circles under his eyes had disappeared entirely. If being held in prison improved his countenance so drastically Harry hated to think of what it must have been like for him during the war.
"You do?" Harry asked hopefully.
“Never.”
“I just needed some air. Too many people in a small space.” He sighed, not even bothering to turn around.
A ghastly, insipid face looked hauntingly back at him with dull and empty eyes.
As always a massive shout out to my Darling AlexClio, she is the best beta reader ever and I owe her so much! 😭 She helped me out a lot with this chapter, so I hope you enjoy it!
“Embarrassing for you? Sign me up.” Draco smirked, pulling Harry out onto the dance floor.
The next sensation Harry was aware of was pain. Terrible pain erupted all over his body.
“Bloody hell, that worked.” Harry blinked in surprise. “You can really hear me?”
“I’m teaching Harry Potter about pureblood culture, filling in the gaps his muggle upbringing caused. He doesn’t even know about the Sacred Twenty-Eight so I said I would help him get up to speed.” He snuck a glance at her face and saw her expression soften.
“Bullshit. Kreacher stopped by to tell me you hardly ate breakfast this morning. Now eat.” Ron’s glare was impressive. He must have been spending too much time with Hermione.
“You don’t have to give me your tickets.” Harry stared at them apprehensively. “I don’t want to put you out.”
Pansy giggled gleefully as she expertly tied it with deft fingers. Just as she was making sure it sat straight Hermione walked into Draco’s room.
“You are running out of time, Draco.” Dumbledore leveled him with his gaze. “I think it is high time we discuss your options.”
“This is our dorm too, you can’t just kick us out.” Tracy scoffed, turning the page in her book with an unconcerned expression.
“I only made it halfway through fifth year on Saturday.” Harry protested without looking up.
“But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe. . . . So tell me, while we wait for your friends... how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.” the maddening old prat said conversationally.
“I had to have them added.” Draco’s voice brought him back down to earth. “There was originally wood paneling and rustic rafters, but I wanted to see the sky.” He was also gazing up at the stars and Harry found that he quite appreciated the look of wonder on his face.
It looked like the entire house was there, making the muted green light seem even dimmer. The older students had commandeered the sofas and armchairs by the fire, talking quietly amongst themselves. The study tables were overrun with second and third years and even the first years were milling about. The fourth years trooped up to the boy’s dormitories by silent consent, still chattering excitedly about buttons. Pansy joined Draco on his bed as everyone settled in.
“No need to thank us for being decent human beings.” The woman grasped his hand in both of hers and squeezed before joining her husband.
It looked like a box of crayons threw up all over the walls and the fluorescent lights reflected harshly off the white tiled floor, but Harry was determined to see this through. He exchanged a meaningful look with Draco as they found a seat towards the back of the room.
The Globe was everything Draco had dreamed it to be and more. They had caught a late afternoon rendition of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing and Draco was over the moon. He had been to Wizarding theater before, but muggle theater was in a league of its own. They were so creative and managed to do so much with the limited resources they had. It was absolutely fantastic. After the play was over and everyone had cleared out Harry helped him sneak onstage and Draco reveled in the exhilaration of standing on such a hallowed piece of history. They decided to not press their luck and left before they could be chased out by a security guard for the second time that day. When they stepped back out onto the bustling London streets he turned expectantly towards Harry, lacing their fingers together as they walked.
"I was angry!" Draco looked up miserably. "I was mad. I didn't mean to- it was that damn Weasel. He got me all riled up and then bloody saint Potter came charging to his rescue and I just got caught up in the unfairness of it all."
“I destroyed one of them.”
“I figured they might feel that way. So how is it here?” He grasped the hilt reverently.
"That's not very reassuring, Potter!" Draco hissed, stumbling slightly as he tried to get used to the weight of the skates.
“And this Regulus went after it?”
“How do you know then?” He challenged.
“I don’t give a damn.” Harry said with finality as if that settled the matter.
“Any wizard?” Ari pulled back and tried to flash him a mischievous grin. He wasn't very successful. “Does that include you?”
Draco’s showers were amazing. Harry had all but forgotten what a wonder modern plumbing was and now he was determined to update his own at Grimmauld Place. The water pressure was absolutely heavenly and you could control the water temperature beyond hell water and arctic tundra.
Ron didn't know how the group would react to Draco, and he didn’t want to overstep his boundaries by telling them Harry’s business. He wasn’t sure if Harry wanted them to know. Either way, their curiosity would be satisfied soon enough. Whether it was satisfied with the truth, or a cleverly constructed lie was up to Harry. He could introduce Draco as just about anyone if they both wore a glamor and Ron wasn’t about to blow their cover before they even arrived. He glanced towards the door of the pub and was relieved to see two unfamiliar men heading straight for their table.
“You look great, Draco!” She smiled as she wrapped her arms around Pansy’s waist and kissed her neck.
“I’m afraid I’m not familiar with this... cuisine. Perhaps we could all order something different and share it family style. That way we all get to try new things.” his father suggested as he glanced over the menu.
“What are the Weasley’s doing here?” Tracy sounded incredulous.
“This is nice. I really miss you when you’re not around.” Harry frowned slightly as they collectively cleaned up, leaving no trace of their presence in the shack.
“You don’t see yourself clearly.” Draco rolled his eyes, knowing it was futile to tell him exactly how incredible he was.
“Yeah.” Harry frowned. “Unless you’d rather do something else?”
“Really? You guys brewed an illegal and infinitely complex potion in a bathroom just to find out if I was the Heir of Slytherin?” He snorted in disbelief.
“Merlin’s beard, what is this swill?” He glared at the contents of his glass with such a Malfoy-ish expression that the black hair and green eyes seemed like pointless subterfuge.
It worked. He could see the open book in front of him.
Pansy sighed impatiently as she knocked for the third time. Draco didn’t normally sleep in and she was eager to see what had become of their nefarious planning. Did Harry stop by or not? She gave him a generous additional five seconds before digging her spare key out and letting herself in.
“Oh.” Hermione looked thoughtful. “That actually explains so much. How did I not see it? So that would mean that he and Theo are…?”
Harry dropped Neville on the step they had been on and raced towards Sirius. He still had a smile on his lips as he fell backward through the whispering veil.
They had their three. Why did things like this always happen to Harry Potter? He swore softly under his breath as the Great Hall erupted into chaos. It seemed as if the entire school was booing and hissing as a shell-shocked Harry stood and made the long trek up to the staff table. Pansy shot him a curious look and he frowned, shaking his head.
“Who placed you under the imperius curse?” Irys continued, frowning down at her.
Harry ignored it, brushing his teeth as he waited for the water to warm up. The outdated plumbing took forever to deliver hot water. He kept meaning to fix it but always forgot, got distracted, or simply couldn’t find the motivation. He was lucky he had the energy to shower, let alone fix anything.
“Er, it’s sort of this public game center with lots of different things, like video games and skee ball and pinball machines.”
Memories of last night slowly began to surface and Harry threw his arm across his eyes dramatically as he remembered some of the less spectacular parts of the club. The overwhelming jealousy when he came back from the bathroom to see Draco being grabbed by a stranger was a new sensation. He had never experienced anything like it before. It wasn’t that he thought Draco would ever be disloyal, but just seeing someone else putting the moves on his boyfriend awakened a beast inside of him. The venom in Draco’s voice when he told the redhead he wasn't interested, however, made the green dragon of jealousy in Harry’s chest purr in contentment.
Draco didn’t respond. He couldn't. He was frozen, staring unblinkingly at the shell of a man before him. He looked already injured and Draco idly wondered what had happened.
The water was starting to bubble towards the middle of the lake. Another champion was coming up and Draco desperately hoped it was Harry. After a few moments of tense silence as the entire crowd collectively held their breath, Cedric Diggory broke free of the lake’s surface and was towing a confused looking Cho Chang to shore.
“I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but I wrote Ronald a rather nasty letter when I first got hired on at the Ministry urging him to not be friends with you. I had bought into the Ministry’s cock and bull story about you being a deranged nutter. I was never more wrong in my life and I am sorry.” Percy fidgeted with his fork instead of meeting Harry’s gaze, but the sentiment seemed genuine enough.
“You’re talking about Harry going on about Draco?” She asked just for clarification.
“Why did you lie to the best legilimens in over a century instead of telling him the truth and going to find your son with him?”
When he entered the living room he found Harry looking at his old sketchbooks, turning the pages almost reverently. A warm feeling settled in the middle of his chest at the look of wonder on Harry’s face.
“Yeah.” He agreed quietly, eyes still on the now-empty staircase. “I reckon he’s slowly losing his shite.”
Nobody spoke, no one even so much as moved. They were all huddled in the front garden at the Burrow, holding onto one another for support. The twins were inside, tending to George’s ear and Kingsley had left for Downing street not ten minutes previously.
“You DARE?!” She screamed, raising her hand to strike again, but his father caught her wrist.
“That must have been incredibly difficult for you.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Here, I got you this.” Draco pushed the frozen coffee across the table, hoping he hadn’t overstepped the unspoken boundaries that existed between them.
“Alright, fine.” Zack grumbled, disappearing from their cubicle and walking into Harry’s. “But only because I like your moxie, Potter. Not because you’re the Chosen Auror Who Lived.”
They both were shirtless and working on the other's trousers somewhat inefficiently since they were doing it blind. Their faces were otherwise occupied. There was a sudden tapping on the window and Harry jerked back with a gasp, looking around for the source of the sound. Draco sighed and went to open the window. A handsome Eagle Owl hopped onto his arm immediately, holding its leg out so he could detach the scroll of parchment attached to it. As soon as its letter was delivered the owl took off, soaring gracefully into the night.
"Merlin!" Zach jumped. "Don't do that to me."
The rest of the world slipped away and all Draco felt was white-hot hatred. His vision tunneled and all he could see was Vernon Dursley, his only driving thought was to make him pay. He wanted to make him hurt the way he hurt Harry. He needed to break him, humiliate him- even the score. An invisible force was holding him back. He thrashed and fought against it when he saw the abhorrent man strike out once more before casting Draco a look that was filled with both fear and revulsion. Draco watched helplessly as he grabbed his wife and beat a hasty retreat, disappearing inside a luxury sedan. After the sedan peeled out of the parking lot, Draco became aware of two pairs of arms holding him back. When he relaxed Blaise let him go, but Luna held fast, pulling him into her for a rather one-sided hug.
“Thanks.”
"She lost everyone. Her husband, her daughter, her son-in-law...me and Teddy are all she has left." Harry tried not to let the memories overwhelm him. "She has you too, now. And your mum. Reconnecting with her sister will be really good for her."
“I really don’t.” Harry tried one last time. “This is ridiculous, can’t you transfer me to a different healer?”
“Be careful, Draco. Come back to us alive.” she begged.
Draco struggles with feelings of rejection and makes a brave decision.
“Yeah, I was wondering if you would mind bringing me a fresh change of clothes and my shower things. We’re going out for breakfast.” Harry smiled fondly at the elf and Draco was confused by their familiarity.
“Two of them are marked death eaters, so the use of veritaserum is expected.” Kingsley’s deep, soothing tones failed to disguise the absurdity of the situation.
For Harry, it probably was. What Harry wants, Harry gets.
“May I offer my opinion?” Malfoy glanced up at him and Harry was caught off guard by how disarming his steel-colored eyes were.
“We’ll be fine, Lucius. Don’t worry about us.” Harry waved him off.
What the hell was he playing at?
“That’s the reason.” Draco snorted.
Draco wakes up slightly hungover from his housewarming party and finds a pile of thoughtful gifts on his table. Narcissa goes into protective momma mode and Lucius comes to terms with how he acted under the Dark Lord's influence. Hermione subtly nettles Draco to do something about his feelings for Harry and Pansy forces him to wear eyeliner.
“Please, who doesn’t?” Theo teased. “Well, maybe Greg and Vince don’t.”
“Well, he’s named after the stars, right? It’s a Black family tradition? So I’m getting him a tea set with stars on it.” He shrugged.
“So you started tormenting me more than ever because you liked me?” Harry couldn't stop the foolish grin from spreading across his face.
Padfoot was gone.
“Mr. Potter told us you were placed under the imperius curse during you-know-who’s first reign. Is this true?” She asked loudly, if not confidently.
“What do you mean they haven’t made a decision yet?” Harry huffed angrily.
A high pitched ringing filled his ears as one by one his resentments and fears slipped away. He no longer cared what was right or what was wrong. There was no morality, there was only truth. Quite suddenly, the only thing he cared about was sharing the truth.
“He’s on his way.” Draco confirmed. The shiver of terror that ran through him was mirrored in both of his friends. “Come on, we better get going. How are we supposed to get inside? I heard Snape telling my parents that McGonagall barricaded the entrances.”
“You are.” Draco realized he had been gazing at Harry for an uncomfortable amount of time. He distracted himself by polishing off the last of his tartiflette before his staring could become embarrassing. “So this cinema is like the theater, but in a picture?”
“We can grab dessert at the cinema.” Harry flashed him a lopsided grin and Draco found that he would go along with just about anything Harry wanted when he smiled at him like that.
“I am about to die.” He whispered to it.
“Yes, and the Parkinsons. Those families make up the Elite Three, meaning that they are the three most powerful and respected bloodlines. If there were such a thing as wizarding royalty, the crown would be restricted to those three families.” Draco said with a detached air.
“Guess I’m in good hands then.” Harry pretended not to notice.
As soon as the way was clear they rushed back into the lobby, wands at the ready.
“Godric, you’re right. We would have spent all our time in the library.” She groaned in defeat. “Well, I’m glad we’re friends now. It would have been a tragedy to miss out on our friendship entirely.”
"With what?"
This one was wrapped in black wrapping and didn’t have a name on it. Draco opened it very carefully, curious as to who else would have gotten him something other than alcohol. The box was nondescript and gave nothing away, only containing a serial number and barcode. When he pried back the lid he let out a quiet laugh. It was a tea set.
Lucius stiffened. He released Narcissa with jerky movements, dumping her on the ground unceremoniously. Snape gave a lazy flick of his wand and Lucius raised a shaky fist. It hovered there for a moment before Snape swished his wand again and his fist made contact with Narcissa’s soft flesh. They both cried out in pain and Harry came to a horrendous realization at the same time that Draco seemed to break out of his trance.
“I did. We’re meeting for coffee tomorrow.” He grinned, feeling strangely triumphant.
“He was never given a choice.” Harry suddenly looked at him again and this time Draco was the one who refused to look away. “I know what that feels like. I was also never given a choice in this war. Those who were older or more powerful pulled the strings and we just had to go along with it. In those rare moments where Draco was able to choose, time and time again he chose to do the right thing.”
“Admitted what?” Harry looked over at her, appearing mildly lost.
“A verdict has been reached, the Malfoys are cleared of all charges. I will write up the paperwork and get it pushed through before the end of the day.” She said in a crisp tone. “Now, if you don’t mind, Mr. Potter, I would like for us to get back to the matter we had been discussing before you exploded into the room.”
“Yeah?” He cocked an eyebrow at his least favorite Weasley.
Something about that phrase pulled him up short. Draco hadn’t considered that as an option. He stopped pacing and sank back down onto his bed.
Harry felt that he finally understood what it meant.
“Thanks.” Harry shook his head as if to get rid of a persistent fly and then shot him a shy smile. “Enough about sad stuff, though. It’s your birthday! We should be celebrating.”
“Er, it wasn’t exactly sanctioned,” Harry admitted. “We stole the ingredients and brewed it in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.”
"Me too." Draco sank down into the dark wood bench and started unlacing his skates. "What were you thinking?"
“If my appraiser hates it and says you have no talent, I won’t force you to throw a housewarming party when you officially move to Rye.” She said delicately.
“You don’t want to know.” Draco shuddered.
The others made noises of agreement before dropping their whiskey and Irish cream shots into the dark stout and slamming it all in one go. Five empty glasses hit the table in rapid succession and Harry could feel the rush of the alcohol flooding through his veins.
“...and it could say ‘Support Diggory, The Real Hogwarts Champion’. Can you imagine Potter’s face when he sees it?” Blaise was gushing, a manic grin making his dark eyes ignite like smoldering embers.
"What won't Andromeda mind?" Andromeda Tonks walked into the kitchen with a turquoise-haired toddler attached to her hip.
“I could.” Bill narrowed his eyes. “Have you been bitten by a non-turned werewolf?”
"Oh, shit. I'm sorry!" Harry moved away and sat up, rubbing at his eyes.
It didn’t take long before Dean joined them with a tray of brightly colored drinks and a pocket full of change.
“Ten points from Gryffindor, for your cheek. I’ll take another twenty for the muggle clothing in place of your school robes and thirty more for your tardiness.” Snape radiated smug satisfaction. “ I don’t think any house has ever managed to go into the negatives before term even technically begins. You must be proud, I think you broke a new record.”
“What do you like on yours?” Draco gestured to the bread and cut meat on the counter.
“I mean that we will not be able to leave this room for anywhere between one to twelve hours, depending on the severity of the breach.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes. Harry had noticed he did that whenever he got upset or worried. “I apologize for your inconvenience. I’m sure you didn’t plan on getting stuck here.”
“I wouldn’t count on it, father.” Draco’s voice sounded weak, even to his own ears, and he cleared his throat.
“Have fun!” Ari called after him as he quickly exited the gallery.
“Consider me impressed.” Draco laughed and Harry looked up hopefully.
“You should get what you like, though.” Harry frowned.
“Shut up, it looks great.” She rolled her eyes.
"Shite, I completely forgot." Harry almost dropped his empty mug.
“Oi, he saved you from Azkaban. The least you can do is buy him a coffee.” She slapped his wrist playfully.
“Fine, just a bit sore.” Harry shrugged, then grimaced before peeling his robes off to reveal casual muggle clothing. He shrank his robes with wandless magic and shoved them into his pocket, glancing around surreptitiously to make sure he hadn’t been seen.
Since when did Ron sound reasonable? Harry couldn’t deny he had a point, though. Harry hardly reacted well to being cut off from the wizarding world for a few months every summer. He could only imagine what Malfoy must be feeling after being cut off for a whole year.
“What’s it to you? Curious how I’m still managing to slip him a love potion from over two thousand miles away?” She sniffed.
“Cruci-”
“You do. And that’s ok, I have to pretend sometimes too. It’s ok to not be ok.” She looked over at him. “You don’t have to be the hero all the time.”
Since the third floor was deserted he risked a quick Lumos to help him get his bearings as he exited the apartment. They had studied the blueprints of this abandoned apartment complex a hundred times. He closed his eyes and tried to visualize the schematics. He was in the middle of the third floor so the stairs should be down the hall on the left. He made his way over to them swiftly, keeping his eyes and ears on the alert for any sign of movement and pushing his magic out to search for any hidden wards or hex triggers.
“Oh? And why is that?” Ari pretended to pout when Draco let him go and moved to gather Karen Burke’s discarded merchandise.
“He wasn’t, actually. He was a magic purist. He believed in keeping the magic in his house strong. Purebloods just usually have the strongest magic because it runs through their veins like blood.”
“Draco looks happy.” Lucius laced his fingers with hers and she smiled at the gesture.
As he watched her walk away a flash of bright hair caught his eye and his smile slipped from his lips. Draco was coming out of the bathroom alone, still buttoning his shirt back up. Before Theo could even register that, Draco was already ordering another drink and scoping out his next victim. He leaned casually against the bar, chatting up some ginger bloke with wide shoulders.
“Her name is Pansy and she didn’t do anything wrong to you. Now leave her alone.”
“It is.” She said somewhat stiffly.
The entire courtroom erupted into chaos and Harry was mildly amused. He had never intended on anyone outside of his small circle of friends knowing he was the last horcrux. Seeing everyone’s intense reaction, however, was somewhat entertaining.
“Your symptoms, Harry.” Hermione tutted impatiently, running her wand up and down the length of his body while the tip glowed blue.
“How expensive?” Draco was looking at the album with an apprehensive expression.
Draco said nothing. That wasn’t a question.
“Bye, mum.” He watched her disappear down the hall before taking the dishes to the kitchen.
Teddy seemed to be in agreement. He spent longer at the penguin's habitat than any other animal, including the snake house. If Draco hadn't been so interested in the penguins the snake house would have probably been his favorite. There were so many different breeds and colors. Harry talked to all of the snakes and was able to give them incredible information none of the nameplates had. Draco learned that boa constrictors had a surprisingly morbid sense of humor and that the pythons were just as excitable as Teddy. He could probably spend an entire day there with Harry and not grow bored.
“I’m glad their little scheme worked, then. Our short dance was honestly the highlight of my night.” Harry winked playfully.
Harry didn’t know which way was up. All he felt was pain. If Remus hadn’t been trying to hold him back only moments previously Harry would have collapsed onto the floor.
Avoiding one another's gaze was a dance in and of itself. The most difficult part was the pas de deux at the very end, but Draco managed it without looking at Harry's face at all. A strange sense of pride washed over him at having accomplished such a difficult feat- but it still felt like a part of him was dying inside. He let Harry go as soon as the last note faded and they both stepped away, putting as much space between them as possible while they waited for feedback.
Darkness began to slowly eat away at the golden glow and Harry was able to make out Draco’s features. His face looked hollow and there were dark circles under his frightened silver eyes. He met Harry’s gaze and Harry felt Draco’s fear.
“Which one do you like more?” He hedged.
“What are you doing here?” Harry laughed.
“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to those foolish enough to continue to oppose me.” with a lazy flick of his wand the Dark Lord set fire to the sorting hat, eliciting a scream from Longbottom.
“I was actually thinking tomorrow? Night or day. Whatever works for you.” Harry scratched at the back of his neck, staring at the box that was still filled with his old belongings.
Draco finally discovers why he was the only new recruit to feel pain while receiving the mark. Kreacher finally meets Young Master Malfoy. Harry covets modernized plumbing and plans a date in the shower. Draco is forced to order for both of them. Harry finds an album he's been wanting, and Draco makes an adorable confession.
“Why are you all the same?” Pansy huffed.
"There is a good place by my work, but it's Wizarding public." Draco frowned.
“You can’t be here! You-” Harry cried in alarm, the fact that Draco Malfoy was here at the Burrow finally sinking in.
He shot Ron a pleading look but he shook his head grimly, shrugging as if to say ‘just let her get it out’.
“They can help! We don’t know where… it is. We’ve got to find it quickly. We don’t have to tell them what it is.” Hermione’s hazel eyes were alight with the sort of fire Harry had come to associate with exam week.
Another successful performance goes in the books, Harry is unprepared to meet Draco's parents, Lucius goes into protective Papa Bear mode, Narcissa lets out her inner lioness, and Draco realizes just how happy he is.
“I might have known.” He nodded his head genially. “Thank you, Granger.”
Happy reading!
“I never thought of it that way.” Harry kissed his neck as he regarded the sleeping statues with a fresh perspective.
"Come on then, Potter. Don't keep the kid waiting." Draco teased.
“It is a rather difficult case-”
“I apologize for what you’re about to hear. I don’t like to let you see this side of me.” She sighed in warning before shoving the door open and stalking in. “Alright you useless twats, clear out. I need the dorm and you’re not invited to stay.”
His father would wonder why rugby practice let out so early and Draco really didn't want to have to invent a clever lie right now.
“I am.” Draco reached out to caress his cheek, reveling in the novelty of being able to do so. “I do have plans in the evening though that I can’t get out of.”
“You certainly could.” The man rang up his purchases on the till. “Will that be all for you?”
Especially after what had happened last week.
Harry pushed himself up and then offered his crisscrossed hands to Draco to help him up too.
“How did you and Fleur get to be such close friends?”
“That wasn’t so bad.” Harry nudged him in the ribs with his elbow as he watched the last of the black fade from Draco’s hair.
Harry kept his head down, eyes trained on the stone floor of the charms corridor as he rushed off to class. It seemed the entire school was back to hating him. It felt like second year all over again, except that he had at least had Ron on his side back then. Having everyone think he was the heir of Slytherin and attacking students had been a low point for his time at Hogwarts, but it was nothing compared to now. He chanced a glance at his surroundings and scowled when he caught sight of ‘Potter Stinks’ badges flashing at him from every direction.
“Oh, I have got so much to tell you!”
“You have until midnight.” The Dark Lord’s voice reverberated through the castle.
That pulled him up short. The truth was he wouldn’t. For whatever reason cleaning Ron’s face for him would be weird, but cleaning Draco’s wasn’t. He couldn’t say exactly what made it different, it just was.
When she went back to the bar he pulled out his coin purse. He had emptied his vault at Gringotts the day he ran. Getting it changed into muggle money seemed like the smartest move. He had been right. The wad of strange paper money had been greatly depleted by now, but he should have enough to survive on for another year if he was cautious. He carefully peeled a couple of twenty-pound notes from the stack and put the rest away. That was his budget for getting sloshed. If he kept drinking the same thing he would be rightly pissed in no time.
“There’s more.” Harry motioned for him to dig deeper into the bag.
Apparently, Harry was thinking along those same lines because at that exact moment he pulled back and pressed their foreheads together.
“Merlin, Potter. You don’t know who the sacred twenty-eight are? Sometimes I forget you were raised by muggles, then something like this happens.” He pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Why don’t we start meeting up once a week? I can teach you about the complex intricacies of magic and you can teach me the sodding secret to mastering nonverbal spells.” She leaned forward conspiratorially.
Harry slipped into the freshly cleaned drawing-room and shut the door quietly. He needed to get away from the others. There was just too much energy in the house. Hermione and Mrs. Weasley kept trying to talk to him about his hearing and didn't have anything else to say about it. He backed into the room slowly, as if expecting someone to throw the door open and pull him back into the chaos.
“Ah, but what kind of pie?” Draco challenged.
“Thank you.” Granger smiled and her posture relaxed. “Though I don’t know what you have to be jealous of, you’re pretty and clever. That’s a deadly combination.”
“I don’t know when he got so good at billiards.” Seamus groaned fondly. “He wants to put a table in our spare room. I think he’s barking.”
Harry snorted in laughter before they split up outside in the hall. Hermione watched him trudge off in the direction of the dungeons wistfully.  She was adamantly resolved to do some research into mental health.
"You should clear your mind and try to get some sleep. I can keep watch till you wake up." Hermione grabbed his hand and held it, giving it a reassuring squeeze.
“There’s more?” Lucius turned his piercing gaze back on Draco and Draco held it, refusing to flinch or back down.
“Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Malfoy. You may return to your seat.” He said calmly.
Draco gulped. Even utterly pissed he knew better than to cross Pansy when she used that tone. He nodded quickly to show he understood and sat back against the shower wall.
“Don’t you have to shift?” Harry protested feebly, rubbing circles on the back of Draco’s hand with his thumb.
“You’re not mad?” Harry looked undecided.
Tonks felt different.
“Did he get back together with George?” Dean asked conversationally as he sipped his beer.
He grabbed his scarlet Auror robes and shuffled sleepily into the en suite. He thought being an Auror would give him a sense of purpose. He thought that living on his own would give him the space he needed to heal. He had been wrong on both counts. He still felt just as lost and broken as ever.
“You’re such a bitch sometimes.” Tracy snapped, carefully marking her place before closing her book and standing up. “Come on, Daph. Let's leave Pansy to fondle her Gryffindor lover in peace.”
“Are you sure?” Harry gave his hands a comforting squeeze.
He only had eight more days to go.
“Yes, sir! It is being Fili’s honor, sir!” The elf cried happily before disappearing with a crack, taking all of the used plates and platters with him.
“You love it.” Draco smirked, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders when he settled his back against Draco’s chest.
“Does he have a name?” Ari persisted.
He hadn’t heard anything about how she was doing this whole time and he felt slightly guilty that he hadn’t thought to ask.
"Leave the horcrux." Harry's voice was low, but Ron heard him.
Harry sat up, disorientated.
“Alright, fine. What is it?” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. He almost always had a migraine these days.
“I am absolutely on board with that.” Draco envisioned being alone at the top of the eye with Harry, snogging and taking in the view.
He smiled as he caught sight of Draco, his legs automatically moving to take him closer to him. He was wearing his golden Bridesman robes again and Harry quite appreciated the way they fit his slight frame.
“It’s not a sell, it’s the truth, and if you lot won’t even give them the benefit of the doubt then I’m out. I don’t have to sit here and listen to this.” Harry fumed, standing up angrily and rushing out of the pub.
“WOW.” Seamus mouthed with wide eyes and Harry ducked his head, trying to hide his chuckle.
So not dating then.
“I only speak the truth. So, tell me how this all came about!” She grinned conspiratorially at him.
“That’s a myth. A wand’s allegiance can change whether it was taken by force or not. The wand chooses the wizard.” Harry almost looked bored.
“You’re taking me to the ballet?” Draco stared up at the opera house in complete shock.
“I was a Hufflepuff Prefect during your first year. I remember your sorting. Our whole house was praying to get Potter.” Ari said wistfully.
“When do you want to talk about it, then?” Harry frowned.
"Therapeuo medela, therapeuo medela, therapeuo medela…" He chanted, hovering over the worst of the burns first. He was not prepared for the sudden drain of energy as Greg's skin started responding to the spell. He almost wanted to stop, but he couldn't. Greg had to survive. When he could not physically move his wand any longer he staggered back and collapsed onto the bed next to Greg's.
“See you out there.” He managed to say before taking off to find Pansy.
He missed by about a foot and the button fell to the floor with a soft clatter. Theo brushed off their teasing, blaming his bad aim on the booze as Draco fell back in laughter. Draco looked up at Pansy with a stupid grin and she rolled her eyes, pushing him off her lap.
“Why?”
“We gotta get back to the shop.” Fred said sadly, kissing Harry on the top of the head.
“Not horrible. Did you have fun?” Draco relaxed his stance and stepped closer.
“Oh, piss off. We’ve been dating.”
“Everything alright?” Harry asked in lieu of a greeting, shutting the door behind him.
“It’s very you- shite!” Harry swore as the sketchbooks that had been on top of everything else went cascading to the floor. A few loose pictures fluttered out and Harry stooped to grab them after setting the box on Draco’s coffee table.
“They just let me know this evening before I left.” Bill beamed.
“I didn’t invite him. He wasn’t supposed to come.” He managed to choke out. He didn’t catch the response before a solid wall of panic hit him full force. His ears quit working. Everything sounded as if it were being filtered through an underwater tunnel and his vision pinned. He could only see Dumbledore. The wasted face looked resigned.
“Happy to help. This is Bill Weasley, one of the best curse breakers in the business. Bill, this is Draco.” Harry stuffed his hands in his pockets, slouching awkwardly.
Harry stared, drinking the sight of her in. She looked so beautiful.
Harry ended up wedged between Percy and George at the table. He couldn’t have asked for more awkward dining partners than his ex and the person who told Ron he was deranged. The fire whiskey kept flowing, however, so he found he was quite easily able to ignore the hesitant pauses in conversation. Before he knew it dinner was over and Molly was serving dessert. She had made an excellent treacle tart and Harry felt obligated to eat some despite the queasy feeling in his stomach.
“What’s the weirdest part?”
“It’s not intimate!”
“Did you see his face?” Theo asked softly, eyes on the dirt and grass strewn path in front of them. “When Potter said he was gay?”
“Thank you, Kreacher.” Harry called, doing his very best not to feel resentful towards the elf.
He hated them. He never wanted to see them again. They were just a reminder of everything he had lost. Sod Harry. Sod Theo.
“Don’t play dumb with me Nott, it doesn’t suit you.” She huffed in annoyance. “ How long?”
“Ari normally gives me Saturdays off, if you want to meet up tomorrow?” Draco hoped he wasn’t pressing his luck, but he felt like if he didn’t get a solid commitment now the coffee date would never happen.
He did another upward spiral, reveling in the exhilaration of the air rushing past him. When he leveled out his feet, he made contact with something solid and the Nimbus vanished from underneath him.
He had thought long and hard about what George had said over the past two days, and he had finally reached a decision. When Harry had told Ron and Hermione about his inconvenient feelings for the Malfoy heir they hadn’t seemed surprised in the least. After getting over his shock that his feelings for Draco weren’t shocking to anyone else, he had lamented on not knowing what to do about it. That was when Hermione casually mentioned the fact that the Ministry was still holding all of the Malfoy possessions as evidence. From what he had seen at the Manor the other day they had obviously replaced most of it, but it was the principal of the matter. He had sent Lucius and Narcissa's things via owl, but Ron had convinced him to deliver Draco’s things in person.
"Harry," Ron began, his voice grave, "whoever put your name in that goblet - I - I reckon they're trying to do you in!"
“Oh.” Harry blushed and fidgeted with the chip he was about to eat. “I, er, actually did a fair amount of research last night to find the best places to take you.”
Hello! Welcome to my first fic.
“How can you possibly be this good without even trying?” Harry groused as they packed away their materials.
And with that he disapparated and silence fell.
“Kreacher will return with master's things shortly.” The elf disapparated without being dismissed.
His boyfriend.
"I need to tell father." He took a deep breath to steady himself.
Burns and scars marred the once bronze flesh. Barely an inch was left unblemished. Harry winced when his Uncle twisted his hand around his wrist, using the friction to irritate the skin.
“All the same.” Draco frowned. “I am truly sorry for how horrible I was to you and for all of the nasty things I said. I didn’t really mean any of it… I suppose I was jealous of you. It seemed so easy for you. I had to try. I worked so hard to earn everyone’s approval and admiration. I had to push myself to my limits, and often beyond them, to gain recognition and validation. Then you came along and people just fell in line to fawn over you- it didn’t feel fair.” Draco was toying with his spoon, swirling his ice cream around in his cup as he spoke. “Not that there was ever an excuse for the way I treated you and your friends. I was a complete arsehole, and I’m sorry for that too.”
Remus knew better, of course. He didn’t know why he was standing here, uselessly staring at this damned black veil. What was he supposed to do now?
Both Bill and Harry turned to look at him with surprised expressions.
“Oh! I’ve found him!” A female voice shouted from much too close.
“Believe me, Dray. I do know. My parents expect that too. I know it sucks. But we don’t have to let them control us. We are the masters of our own destiny! We can do anything we want. As long as we do it together.” Pansy grabbed her wand and shut off the water but didn’t even try to get up. She cast drying charms on both of them and leaned over so she could rest her head on Draco’s shoulder. “Whatever happens, we do it together, yeah?”
Malfoy's jaw dropped.
“Of course, that’s an excellent idea.” He conceded.
“It’s Harry Potter!”
“I see.” Draco tried to keep the apprehension off his face. “Are you canceling our plans or inviting me into the lion’s den?”
“It’s not our fault you scratched on your only turn.” Draco leaned over the table elegantly, cleaning the striped balls from the felt with sure movements. He didn’t miss a single shot and Dean glowered at him, but the dark glare was colored with a healthy amount of respect.
Right.
"Thank you." Draco almost smiled. "Everyone has always told me how much I look like my father. It's an honor to be compared to my mother."
Harry glanced at her cautiously. Last year, she’d been smiling and full of jokes most of the time. The Tonks walking next to him silently in the night was withdrawn and flat. It felt wrong.
“Isn’t that incredibly romantic?” Draco sighed, leaning into him. “They are literally together forever.”
“When I read that not only was Murtagh alive but that he and Eragon were brothers, I had to put the book down.” Draco told her excitedly.
“Just discussing the pros and cons of getting back together, little brother.” George rolled his eyes, giving Harry a look that told him this conversation wasn’t over.
Wasn’t that disrespectful? Wouldn’t he have to punish himself now?
He wiped his mouth and returned to the tent. Hermione had made him mint tea and he sipped at it gratefully.
“I’ll take him home.” Luna’s voice was laced with sympathy but Draco couldn’t meet her eyes. He couldn’t bear to see the understanding pity he knew he would find in them.
“It’s ok Draco, I’ve got you. Sod the rest of the world, yeah?” Theo muttered, pulling Draco into his lap.
He tried to stop his shoulders from shaking, but he was alone so what did it matter? His path had been chosen for him long ago. He was a Malfoy, after all. That thought almost made him smile as he added shading to Harry’s hair. Drawing the object of his forbidden love was just about the most Un-Malfoy-ish thing he could do and he relished in it. The rest of the house was asleep and he was finally, truly alone. If he didn’t have his art as an outlet he didn’t know what he would do. He flipped through his sketch pad with a twisted smile on his face. Every single page had Harry staring up at him. That finished the last sketchbook he had bought this past summer. Luckily he knew Pansy’s real present was a new one secured safely in his dorm back at Hogwarts. His parents had been pleased with her Honeydukes decoy though, and that’s all that mattered. He would just have to draw on spare bits of parchment for the rest of Christmas break. Maybe he should try to draw someone other than Harry…. Then again, maybe not.
“See?” Draco muttered. “No idea.”
“Webster?” Malfoy repeated, confusion written plainly in his sharp features. “Frankly, now I’m not only questioning who on earth you are, I’m also questioning your sanity.”
“You don’t like it?” Harry asked, confused.
Draco stepped out of the fireplace with all of his usual grace, and finally, Harry registered that his face was stony and ashen. All of his worry instantaneously increased tenfold.
Draco swallowed another bite of his biscuit, still smiling. “I think I would have to agree with you.”
Birds were singing in the garden as they held each other beside the fragrant rose bush, which Harry had christened, only that morning, the Farewell Point. He was due at the Auror office in a little while, and Draco had once again willingly agreed to see him off.
Harry snorted, amused against his will, and released Draco’s arm with one last shove. “Why won’t you let me see your notes?”
Harry laughed loudly. “Good segue. And so much for not talking about sex.”
And there was Harry, his Harry, the Harry of dreams and the Harry of reality, proving himself a hero once again by simply being there. Harry hadn’t left. Harry had stayed.
“So,” he began, deciding it was safer to stick to his notes going forward. “Do you recall the first time you met Harry?”
“Like I already told you, I almost was,” Harry laughed. “And it just seems really unfair that I’m telling you every single thing about me, and you’re sitting there all close-lipped and stoic.”
Draco allowed himself to consider that possibility. Maybe Harry was right; maybe Draco had just been quick to assume the worst, just as he always was.
It was her way of letting him know she was still angry, but that she still cared about him too. He dropped his hand to his lap and blinked rapidly.
Without stopping to think it through any further, he pushed past the students in front of him and grabbed the sword by its hilt. It vibrated violently in his grasp and he almost dropped it. He gripped it tighter and, after a moment, it seemed to accept him as its wielder. It stopped trying to shake itself out of his hands and started to feel more like an extension of his own arm. The words ‘Godric Gryffindor’ glinted in the moonlight before Draco raised it and charged at the Dark Lord.
“No, we need to stick together.” Hermione coughed, brushing uselessly at the soot all over her clothing. “I say we- Harry, what’s that on your arm?”
“It’s hard to say. Originally, I thought it to be only those first eight years. It wasn’t as powerful as the one he had cast on my wife. He wanted me to still act like me, you see. He just planted himself in my brain, affecting my judgment and - ah… political views.”
Draco took in a few deep breaths while Harry continued to give muttered reassurances in a soothing tone. He was immensely grateful he had already told Harry exactly why the library was the worst room for him. Having Harry here supporting him made him feel like he could face down his demons.
"Don't do it again then, yes?" She pulled back and gave him a stern but fond look.
"Not really, no." Harry smiled as he wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist.
“Perfect. That means you’re sobered up just enough to talk about Potter.” A mischievous smirk played at her full lips and Draco let his shoulders sag in defeat.
“Pansy wanted me to wear it,  I didn’t.”
"Yes, I imagine it will be good for my mother as well." Draco agreed.
"Oh, Draco. There is no need to apologize-" Andromeda moved towards him, but he held up his hand to stop her.
“Is there a problem here?” Harry asked innocently as Draco cast a quick scourgify to clean up the spit and dirt clinging to his clothes.
"Merlin's fucking tits, Potter." Malfoy cried.
“Yes, you do. Now go.” She shooed him away with her hands.
“Lemmings.” Harry nodded solemnly.
“Tickets?” Draco felt slightly overwhelmed. It was an awful lot of nonsense just for a bit of fun.
“I don’t know, I just-”
He felt like crying until he drowned in his own tears.
“No room for dessert?” Draco had been looking forward to something sweet to balance the savory meal.
“They saved my life.” Harry snarled.
"Draco? Draco Malfoy?" Dean's jaw dropped in shock.
"Wha? Whazz 'appening?" Harry jerked awake when Draco prodded him in his ribs.
“I’m so glad that you think my feelings are a joke.” Draco hissed, jumping off the couch and stalking towards his still barred door. “Do me a favor and never speak to me again.”
He was still thinking about those damned eyes while the Minister gave him three drops of the wretched truth serum. He obediently swallowed, then shuffled over to the witness stand where he sat and waited for the potion to take effect.
“Albus. Order. Phoenix. Mad-eye. Bones.” He tried in rapid succession, growing ever more frustrated with each wrong password. “Sirius! Dumbledore! Wolfric!”
“Come here, let me help.” Hermione bossed, pulling out her wand and waving it across his face and shirt. “Tergeo!”
He desperately needed fresh air. He felt like he couldn’t breathe. As soon as he was free of the mass of people he made a beeline for the back door, not stopping until he was halfway down the path that led to the field they used for two-on-two Quidditch.
This time there was no hesitation when he knocked on the door and Draco answered almost immediately.
Draco didn't respond. Knowing Harry was alive brought a small sense of comfort, but Harry was only part of his fears.
He had been dying to know who this mystery man was that had captured his sweet little cinnamon roll’s heart.
“Merlin’s beard.” Dean was regarding the table with something that was almost awe.
“Mind? Of course not. I was going to invite you myself.” Draco reached out and gently stroked his face from temple to jaw.
“Kill him.” Draco sounded like he was crying and Harry held him tighter. “You need to win. You have to defeat him. Please.”
He had a coffee date with Harry today.
“And you don’t mind me coming to dinner?” Harry had to make sure.
“How do they stay up like that?” Draco reached up to touch the silvery orb, testing the dexterity of the latex with his fingers.
“I’m not hungry.” Harry said automatically.
“Cool ones.” Harry grinned.
His mother shot off a killing curse so fast Draco didn’t even see her wand move. Aunt Bella didn’t stand a chance. Her taunting smile froze on her face as his mother’s curse found its mark.
The elf turned to look at him as if he hadn’t seen him sitting there.
“The genealogy records. In the library. All of the sacred twenty-eight bloodlines are meticulously recorded dating back almost nine centuries. Purebloods love proving how pure they are.” He scoffed.
“Hardly,” Draco chuckled. “Few Gryffindors are.”
PS: I can’t wait to see you tomorrow.
“There you go,” Harry said. “Might be nice to see her, and Blaise.”
“Right,” Harry chuckled, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes with his fists like a fucking child. It made Draco want to smother him with kisses. “Well, unfortunately Andrea and I have to take one last trip back to North Wales tomorrow, and then do a mountain of reports and such whenever we get back.”
“You seem kind of jumpy, Draco,” Harry said.
“Potter,” Draco gasped breathlessly, “you’re not wearing underwear.”
Harry shrugged. Hearing him say so certainly erased some of the hurt feelings, anyway.
“You really love him,” Draco muttered as he took rapid notes.
Draco nodded. “I’d heard.”
“Because you’re basically a living work of art,” Harry said, as if it was obvious. “And since you’ve really never had any kind of overtly sexual experience with anyone before, then what you did in the kitchen is somehow even more impressive than I already thought. Plus, honestly, I can’t fathom how you’ve gone twenty-one years without someone snapping you up, because you’re pretty damn ideal, in my opinion.”
Draco couldn’t help it, he laughed. “I know without a doubt that it’s the very opposite of wise.”
Harry snorted again. “No one’s died. Sit down, Draco.”
“Go on and say it, then,” he muttered.
Draco chuckled even as he blushed. “I’ll be sure to put that in the article.”
Draco grinned.
Harry nodded. “Yes, I know.”
Draco laughed. “I feel it, I assure you.”
Draco watched, oddly mesmerized, as Harry took out two of Draco’s large, clear glass mugs from the cupboard and set them on the counter beside his small tea service tray. Harry then walked over to Draco, took the spoons from his hand, placed them inside the teacups, and spelled all the dishware onto the tray, setting it down on the counter beside the kettle. Draco wanted to make a snide remark about Harry making himself at home, but it died in his throat, because he found that he really didn’t mind so much, having Harry taking over his space. He may even go so far as to say he liked it.
“I already did,” Draco bellowed. “I told you to get the fuck out of my house.”
“What if I’m not your type?” Harry probed further, thinking of all the times Draco had insulted his scar, his glasses, his hair… Draco claimed to have changed, but Harry couldn’t envisage anyone changing that much.
“Of course,” Harry replied, smiling. “I want to try everything with you.”
Draco looked up at him and raised one of his eyebrows. “Really? With that mop of hair?”
He heard the anxiety ringing in his ears, felt it buzzing through his fingers as he willed desperately for his mother to say something. He needed her to be alright with this. He needed her to love him through this. He tried counting to five, but it did nothing to help him now.
“Your friends all hexed me after fourth year!” Draco continued, feeling anything but relaxed now. “In front of my friends!”
“Hey, maybe if I’d been sorted into Slytherin and we had shared a dorm, we would’ve been wank mates,” Harry said with a laugh.
“Well I’m happy to have unknowingly assisted you in your romantic life, Malfoy.” He rolled his eyes, but he didn’t look happy. He looked vaguely annoyed, and a little pink.
“You don’t like being a celebrity,” Draco surmised.
“I dunno,” Harry told him, knowing he most certainly didn’t have a favorite word. He thought about it for a moment. “Eureka?”
“You will,” he said quietly, his voice shaking. He wasn’t sure if Harry heard him.
“And the bacon?”
“Yeah.” Harry smiled sadly back at him. “I reckon it’s selfish of me to say this, but one of the things I miss the most about him is that he’s not around to tell me about my parents.”
“I can warm you up.”
Draco stared at his hands and bit back a grin. “I suppose.”
Harry tilted his head incredulously, and Draco finally peered up at him.
“Yes, it was fun,” Harry said softly. He paused. “I’ve never actually done that with a man before.”
“Can we go inside now?” Harry asked when he pulled away, standing up without waiting for an answer. “It’s chilly.”
When he exited the shower, he felt wonderfully awake and oddly jolly. The grey pallor in his face had vanished, and he looked marginally better. Draco may have even gone so far as to say he looked pretty good. Perhaps glowing skin was a happy side effect of being in love.
“Thank you for that, Draco,” Hermione told him, smiling politely. “Are you fond of cooking as well?”
“Actually, you’re more interesting,” Harry said. “Everything you say surprises me.”
“Maybe a little snarky, and, okay, a little bit of a bastard,” Harry allowed, grinning. “But that’s just part of your charm.”
“Are you going to do the interview, then?” Hermione asked as they all stood up and made their way towards the sitting room fireplace. “For the Prophet?”
Harry snorted. “My sappiness is rubbing off on you, Malfoy.”
“How did anyone this cute come from you, Weasley?” Draco retorted, leaning forward and taking Rose’s hand between two of his fingers. She babbled cheerfully at him.
Draco smiled and pushed his face away playfully. “No.”
“You can admit it,” Harry pressed. “You miss flirting with me, too. And I think you’re kind of turned on right now.”
She smiled and lifted her hand in surrender. “Alright. It was merely a suggestion. Think it over in the morning?”
“Yeah,” he answered, flashing him a thumbs-up, because he remembered Draco smiling the last time he’d done so. “Took a while for us to match up our schedules, but we can all make Friday evening work, if you can. Ron’s off that day, and Hermione is theoretically off at four, but she never leaves on time, so we settled on meeting up around half five. The seventeenth, or whatever date Friday is.”
Never mind the way he’d acted with Draco, Harry also had Hermione’s pregnancy to deal with. Now that he was thinking more clearly, he knew that his strong reaction to the news was borne from jealousy more than anything else, and it made him feel ashamed. Obviously he was beyond excited for them, but fucking hell, he wanted to be a father more than anything.
And for Merlin’s sake, he wished Harry would stop staring at his mouth.
Harry laughed. “You really do. Particularly because I’ve essentially admitted that I’d willingly sleep with you at any given moment. And also because we’re suddenly very alone in this long, dark corridor.”
“No,” Draco said honestly. “You look good up here.”
Harry levitated the tea tray onto the coffee table and dropped himself comfortably into his usual armchair in the corner. Draco followed him, sitting down (with far more grace) on the chair across from him and picking up his cup. Oh, the way he moved… Harry had missed it even more than he thought.
“Well at least I’m no longer being called a stranger,” Harry pointed out, shrugging nonchalantly despite his still-racing heartbeat.
Harry kissed his neck. “Alright, sweetheart.”
“Fucking Ron.”
Draco didn’t have any words, so he nodded. For the first time, his head, his heart and his soul agreed on something. He knew with everything in him that this was right.
“Eloquent,” Draco laughed.
“I wasn’t flirting,” Harry said. Another blatant lie. “
“I’ll never stop telling you how handsome and wonderful you are, Harry Potter,” Draco admitted, kissing the lightning bolt scar on his forehead. “And I love your egotistical arse.”
Draco knew it was silly, but he felt fluttery at the question and rather like a Hufflepuff third year all over again.
Their eyes met again, and Draco’s were sparkling much less than before.
“First off, can you think of any possible motive for this assault?” Ramesh questioned. “Previous disagreements, any arguments you two may have had recently, that sort of thing? Anything that might’ve spurred the attack?”
“No,” Harry said through his own wide grin, moving his hips and lifting his leg up for a moment to prevent Draco from moving. “Not because of you, you weigh half a stone. Don’t move.”
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said with a smile, because somehow, it was. “The name itself really doesn’t mean anything, either, so that’s not much of a clue, on its own. Maybe you’re right that I was only named for my out-of-control hair. That’d be pretty funny, I reckon.”
Harry’s heart was racing now. Everything about Malfoy was incredibly familiar, and yet it had been so long since he’d seen him in the flesh that this might as well have been the first time. His facial expressions were far less disdainful than they once were. Instead, they were… well, careworn. Maybe even a little defeated. He looked tired, but then, it was the middle of the night. Harry couldn’t deny that he looked good, however. Had he always been so…?
Suddenly horrified, Draco gave his head a vigorous but necessary shake and picked up his quill, jotting ‘
After the remaining introductions were made, Harry pulled out a chair for Draco to take a seat. He looked so stone-faced that Harry couldn’t resist discreetly rubbing a comforting hand along his back as he sat down in the chair next to him, desperately trying to tell him without words that whatever it was, it would be alright.
Draco forced himself to think of other things; Harry was unsurprisingly the first thought to flit into his head. He tried to busy his mind by coming up with words to describe the exact shade of green in Harry’s eyes, an impossible feat that distracted him sufficiently from the chills in his body.
Draco just looked at him. Harry lowered his hand.
“I won’t,” Draco said, unsure about exactly what he was agreeing to but not caring either way. Really, Harry could’ve told him to dance naked down the street at that moment and he would have complied with no questions asked. “I won’t leave, Harry.”
“Double espresso, please. Triple, if you have.”
Harry sighed and looked over at him, leaning forward with his forearms resting on his thighs. “I suppose telling you to piss off wouldn’t affect you either?”
“What’ll your prize be?” he asked with a smile.
“Well, since we’re being honest, I think you’re good looking, too,” Harry told him. “And yes, because I know you’re dying to know, I happen to like blondes. A lot. Like,
“Was I complaining?” Draco asked. He licked his lips as slowly and suggestively as he could, and he was gratified when Harry’s eyes followed his tongue like it was enchanted.
“Oh, was it that obvious?” Harry said.
“I should probably go to work now.” Harry sighed.
“Afraid is not the only reason.”
“Perhaps now,” Draco agreed, though it wasn’t quite the truth. “But you got under my skin every time I saw you, back at Hogwarts.”
Harry pointed both his thumbs at himself wordlessly, a cheeky smirk on his face.
“You did say earlier that you were a few minutes ahead of schedule,” Draco helpfully reminded him, grinding his hips against Harry’s in order to tempt him further. He dropped his hands another inch or two and massaged his fingers against Harry’s arse. “Despite having to wait so unbearably long for the shower.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Draco smirked, eyes glued to that pert, jogger-clad arse. “And don’t shave.”
Draco lifted a dubious eyebrow at Harry, but he obediently closed his eyes. Harry stared at him unapologetically. He was always so...
“...and you watched me. And you like my clothes.” Draco grinned to disguise his very earnest investment in this conversation. “It all points to the fact that you hopelessly fancied me.”
You horrible man. You had me thinking that you were delivering some dreadful news, but instead, you were merely reiterating just how Hufflepuffian you are. I will most certainly not send kisses with your owl, Potter, whatever that means, although I know you will pretend that I have. Honestly, you are the worst, and I am unmitigatedly besotted with you.
“Thank you, Mother,” he said, reaching for her hand again and placing a gentle kiss upon it.
“Would it help if I told you my type now?” Draco ventured, rubbing his fingers softly on Harry’s t-shirt clad chest.
Thoughts of snuggles and kisses danced in his head as he slowly refocused on his book, but by the time he was several chapters in, he was beginning to grow impatient for Harry… and maybe a little worried.
Finally Weasley shook his head. “Damn. How the hell did this happen?”
“Well give me a moment,” Harry sighed. “I’m sort of hard.”
been intentional. “It’s quite alright.”
Harry sighed into Draco’s mouth and brushed his tongue against Draco’s. Draco eagerly returned the favor, running his tongue in a circle over Potter’s once, twice, three times.
Harry looked at him, his eyes so clear.
“Yes, it was,” Harry agreed, nodding.
“Hey, woah,” Harry’s voice broke through the ringing in his ears and Draco turned to him, pathetically holding his arms out, desperate for his touch.
“What?”
“I suppose you’re right,” Harry agreed, sighing.
“Excuse me,” Draco uttered, “I most certainly do know that. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, Harry. You won’t lose me.”
“Just please stay still,” Harry insisted, squirming as he willed his cock to stop twitching. “I don’t want you to hurt yourself even more.”
“Well, there was Ginny during sixth year, which I’m sure you know about already,” Harry began. “That was fun, and I cared for her a lot. Still do. But it was never going to go anywhere. We weren’t meant to be. She’s great, of course, just… like a sister.”
“Three weeks as of last night,” Harry said softly, his head tilting to the side. “Any complaints so far, Malfoy?”
Harry rested his knee against Draco’s, and he felt the familiar heat, the fluttering of snitches all through his body.
Potter stared at the table for a moment longer but didn’t reply. Draco took a few swigs of his drink in an attempt to calm himself.
Harry lifted another finger, and another, so that they were laced up in Draco’s, moving, touching, exploring. Draco mirrored his actions, rubbing his velvet-soft fingers slowly and gently against Harry’s. The gesture should’ve been harmless and playful, and it was, in a way; but at the same time, Harry wanted to scream with the pleasure of it. Were fingers an erogenous zone? Merlin
Harry lifted his middle finger up to Draco’s mouth and pushed it inside. Draco moaned as he sucked the drop of liquid from Harry’s finger. Harry’s eyes were hungry, lewd, wicked.
“Please?” Potter said, looking up at him, and Draco felt a sense of dread knowing he could never, ever say no to those green eyes.
“Harry!” he screeched.
“You’re really sexy,” Harry blurted out.
Truth be told, Draco had expected some kind of apology this evening, since this was Saint Potter they were talking about. But he still felt rather speechless all the same.
“A hundred batches?” he asked softly.
“It’s definitely not about any of that. And you didn’t do anything wrong,” Harry muttered, his voice gruff. He slowly turned around and kept meandering unsteadily down the narrow hallway, running his hands through his hair as he did.
They laid like that for what might have been hours, or years, or mere moments. Draco didn’t care about anything that might be happening outside of this warm cocoon that contained just he and Harry and their very promising future together. He was in love, and that was all there was to it.
“You say that like it’s a bad thing, Potter,” Draco said, but he stopped kissing Harry all the same. Instead, he skated his lips across Harry’s cheek, up his temple, and back across his forehead. He ran his tongue over each inch until, without noticing, he was licking the lightning bolt scar on Harry’s forehead. He could feel the bump of scar tissue beneath his tongue, ragged and rough, and he found that he loved the feel of it.
“You’ve never sucked a man off before either, have you?”
“Well, not a lot of people know this, and I might be an idiot for trusting you with the information…”
“Oh Draco, I don’t…”
“I’m supposed to be finished by nine tonight, so as soon as I’m done work I’ll go home and change clothes and check on Ariadne, and then I’ll be off to Ron and Hermione’s.”
And Potter still hadn’t lowered his hand.
That being said, it was the circumstances which surprised Draco so much. He, a (former) Death Eater, having a beer with Harry fucking Potter. And not only were they not killing each other, but they were actually enjoying each other’s company. Draco was, at least.
“Good,” Draco said in a surly way.
Harry smiled into the fire. “We’re falling for each other.”
“That seems… oddly dangerous.”
“No.”
“But I guess the real answer, no filter, is that I wish none of it had happened at all,” he continued, looking lost in thought as he stared out the window. “I wish I had never been singled out from birth. I wish I’d had a normal childhood. A normal life.”
There was a long pause, and Draco tried his hardest to just breathe and focus on the way the flames danced in the fireplace.
“Merlin, you’re such a stalker.”
Malfoy once again lifted his eyebrow in surprise and stared at him. “Is something about this funny?”
Draco sighed. “You’re right.”
“Draco,” Harry whispered back. He paused. “I’m falling in love with you.”
“Ah, did I hate you?” Draco asked warily. “At Hogwarts? I suppose it’s likely, since I hated most people there. Did I mention that I was a prick?”
“Do you like it when I touch you like this, Harry?” Draco whispered, almost surprised at his own words. Once again, Harry had a way of pulling things out of him.
“Thanks,” he smiled. She said that every time. “You too.”
“Don’t?”
Harry leaned forward and touched their foreheads together.
Harry wanted to wank just thinking about all of it, but there wasn’t time; his drunken self had created too many damn problems for his sober self to sort through this morning. Or was it afternoon now?
Draco pulled his knees up a bit, so that they were touching Harry’s under the blankets. Harry’s foot was still tucked in between Draco’s legs, and they were breathing in each other’s air. He felt Draco trace a finger over his eyelids, so gently that it was like his hands were singing Harry a lullaby.
As he reentered the sitting room, Draco arranged the biscuits neatly on the plate with his wand. He saw that Harry was seated comfortably on the couch, one arm flung over the backrest and his ankle resting casually on his knee, as it was before.
But Harry just smiled. “Relax, Malfoy. I love Newcastle.”
Draco decided to take a moment to confront his nerves, and (more terrifyingly) the causes of them: first and most obvious was that he was about to see Harry, a fact that had been flitting around his mind like an overexcited snitch all day long. Secondly, he was about to reunite with two of the people whose lives he had worsened for several years. (Well, three of the people, he supposed, though for some odd reason, he didn’t really count Harry among that list anymore.)
He knew his mother ran in a vastly different social circle from the Weasleys, but as he had pointed out to Harry earlier, this kind of information always had a way of getting back to her.
“It makes me feel sad that no one seems to understand it but us.”
Ordinarily, Draco didn’t receive mail at his quaint cottage on the outskirts of Diagon Alley. In fact, he couldn’t immediately think of anyone who would send him mail via an owl he did not recognize.
Harry just kept smiling expectantly at him, and when Draco remained silent, his cocky expression suddenly turned into bashfulness. When Harry began chewing his lip, Draco instantly disregarded every single reason why he shouldn’t answer him.
“Sit down, Harry,” Draco told him.
“It seems the responsible thing to do.”
Harry glanced at him curiously. “What?”
Potter licked his lips in a way that Draco would’ve missed had he not been staring at his mouth already. Potter had very nice lips, really.
He laughed. “Do you want to start tidying up the house, or help me with Rosie’s bath?”
Harry didn’t respond, and Draco thought he might get off easy. No such luck.
“I live here,” he said, trying to see the house from Harry’s perspective.
“Yes you did,” Harry snorted. “I wanted to hex you, and punch you, and push you to the ground and fuck you. All in equal measure.”
“Thank you.” Draco turned to leave.
Malfoy,
Harry leaned back and folded his arms across his chest, contentedly listening to their easy banter for a moment. His two favorite people, two sides of the same coin. Not for the first time, Harry wondered where he fit in that equation now.
Harry fixed him with a somewhat suspicious smile. “How do I know you’re not lying now?”
“Stop that,” Draco whispered.
“I sincerely hope we never become so boringly domesticated as that, Potter,” Draco said, lying back down and folding his hands behind his head.
“We are,” he nodded. “And yes, for a time, I moved back into the Manor.”
“And why is that?”
Harry laughed at him, and the way he looked in that moment… Yes. Draco had to leave. Now.
And Harry turned on his heel and headed into the kitchen towards the back door. Draco scrambled after him in shock.
Rather than leave Draco’s comment hanging there like a soap bubble between them, Harry lifted his hand once again and skimmed his thumb gently along Draco’s jawline. It was soft and smooth; he must’ve borrowed Harry’s razor. The image made Harry’s heart burst.
Harry just smiled at him as if he held the sun, moon, and stars in his hand. Suddenly Harry gripped his arm tightly and spun on the spot, apparating them both into Draco’s bedroom.
“Draco,” Harry murmured. “It’s okay.”
“Shut the fuck up,” Harry laughed.
Draco nodded to himself. It wasn’t an earth-shattering response, but it was… well, quite nice, all things considered. Potter enjoyed spending time with him, then. Draco had been fairly sure it wasn’t one-sided, but it was nice to have it confirmed all the same.
“Potter, you should consider a hat regardless,” Draco countered.
“Engrave it on a plaque and marvel at it later!” she barked. “The point is, he’ll only do the interview with you!”
“No! Let me throw the damn pillow at you, Potter!” He picked up his last pillow from the couch and clutched it madly in one hand.
Draco nodded back; that was a relief. The man was vile, but he was also smart: Draco didn’t believe that Alex would sacrifice his own arse just to take him down. Well, as long as he didn’t misuse any information that might harm Harry, they wouldn’t have any problems.
Looking in his eyes, lying near enough that he could feel the heat coming off of Draco’s skin, Harry felt something close to reverence. Draco reached over and took Harry’s hand again, beneath the sheets. (Who knew Draco was such a hand-holder? What a lovely thing to discover.)
Draco moaned into Harry’s neck and then pulled away just enough to kiss him again. Draco drowned in the kiss, lost himself in the intoxicating taste of Harry. Their tongues hungrily thrashed against one another, their hips finding a rhythm as they rocked together, and Draco was hardly even conscious of the embarrassing sounds he knew he was making. He could feel a spot of precum blooming on the outside of his trousers.
didn’t give me this scar,” Harry said gruffly, pointing at the lightning bolt on his face.
“Malfoy…” He rubbed the back of his neck, which he had always done when he was uncomfortable. Draco smiled to himself at the familiar gesture, which looked normal now that Potter had his own face back.
“Do you often attempt to lure prospective lovers in coffee shops?” Draco asked, grinning down at his notes before taking a long sip of tea.
Harry lifted his eyebrows in shock. Surely Malfoy wasn’t asking him out on a date?
“It’s French, Potter,” he explained, pinching Harry’s arm. “The English pronunciation, faineant, is also correct, though I’ve always preferred the word in the original French.”
Draco bit his lip. Harry reached his hand up and clumsily brushed a lock of hair away from Draco’s face.
They both sighed then, and Draco was surprised when Harry suddenly leaned forward and sucked on his nipple. Draco felt his cock twitch.
“Oh, well, many thanks, Potter, I’m all better now,” Draco spat sarcastically.
They stopped at the apparition point near the front of the building.
“You did the same thing, Harry,” he reminded him gently. “For much of your life, in fact.”
Harry could feel himself blushing. “Well, at least that last one is more complimentary, if only a little."
Harry waited for him to add something else, but Draco merely poured their two cups of tea in silence.
Draco snorted. “I never say anything just to appease you, Potter.”
After opening a particularly vitriolic one, however, which had been accompanied by a cursed Galleon that Draco had noticed too late, he had wound up in St. Mungo’s for nearly a week.
“Harry?” Draco asked, brushing a hand through Harry’s slightly sweaty black hair. “I’m sorry, should I not have done that?”
Draco smiled at him in return.
Draco nodded at him. “By all means.”
“You don’t bake?” Harry took a bite and Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry sighed. “Please just tell me?”
“Hey,” Harry whispered, and Draco didn’t know anything in the world except for Harry James Potter.
Draco obeyed, setting his wand in his lap as he perched himself, as dignified as was possible, on the rickety old stool.
Draco smirked at him. “But the real reason, though I am loath to admit it, is that I was jealous of you, Weasley.”
“You’re the absolute worst,” Draco told him with another eye roll.
“Lots of nice things?”
“No specifics as to which man?” Draco asked, a tiny smirk gracing his handsome face. “Should I be worried?”
“Certainly,” Draco replied, nodding. “Moving on, then, for now.”
Draco glared at him, and Harry could see that his fists were clenched now, his chest heaving. His eyes raked over Harry’s chest again, and once more he licked his lips. Gone was his usual gracefulness, the lithe movements that so captivated Harry. This Draco was skittish, and nervous, and agitated. It was all wrong, and Harry couldn’t help but feel like it was his fault, that he really
“But… it’s more than that, isn’t it?” he continued. Part of him knew he was taking a risk with these words, but he recalled them hinting at this subject not so very long ago. He didn’t care as much as he should’ve, anyway; all caution was lost in a haze of overpowering lust. “You like being dominated.”
The praise, spoken in Harry’s gravelly, suggestive voice, made Draco even harder, just when he thought it was impossible. He would have been embarrassed by the noises he was making if he hadn’t known that Harry loved every one of them.
“Yes,” Harry said suspiciously, bracing for a snide remark. “It’s cute, no?”
Dammit, Harry was frustrated and tipsy and horny as hell, and in his experience, that was never an ideal combination. He could only assume that throwing Draco into the mix would result in some uproariously stupid decisions, and he didn’t have it in himself to care which particular stupid decision he would end up making this time around. When it came to Draco Malfoy, all bets were off.
“Hirsute,” Harry chuckled. “There’s no way that’s a real word.”
“Because you’re Harry bloody Potter, for Merlin’s sake,” he spat out.
Harry let out a pained sigh. “I… I don’t know.”
Harry gaped at him, mystified. “Sorry?”
He stared.
Harry shrugged again. “It’s how I am.”
“Right, I’m a freak, in a good way,” Harry summarized, grinning at him as he popped the last bit of his scone in his mouth.
Draco filed through his mind for any safe topics of conversation, though he knew he was spinelessly avoiding the one topic he needed to raise. He had always avoided bringing up work, as his parents failed to understand the concept of teaching in a muggle school as proper employment, and there never seemed to be much else for Draco to talk about.
“--was it, mate, ten galleons?” Harry heard Ron ask him in the back of his mind. Thankfully, Ron only glanced back at him for half a second, so he failed to notice that both his and Draco’s hands were suspiciously out of sight.
“A fire in which I’m left with no wand, and no other means of putting out said fire?” Draco asked incredulously, leading them down the spiral staircase.
Draco positively quivered. He had to stop rubbing his cock for a moment for fear that he would come too soon.
“Leaves an impression?” Draco repeated, still smirking. “Well, I’ve been told far worse. I quite like leaving an impression, as a matter of fact.”
good looking?”
After Harry had placed his order, and the barkeep had turned to retrieve the drinks, Draco watched, alarmed, as Harry abruptly turned around and met his eyes across the bar. He’d been caught staring and oh bugger, Harry was grinning at him with that unusual face, his head tilting to the side again.
“That you’re dumping me,” he muttered.
Ron merely stared. Draco stared back.
“Be sure to save me a few crumbs, will you?” Draco teased.
For all the unbearable sexual tension Draco was feeling in that moment, he was also deeply moved that Harry was this concerned about his feelings. He couldn’t remember any man ever asking him if he was sure before.
. Draco bucked his hips, pushing his cock deeper inside Harry’s mouth; he was going to come violently down Harry’s throat, at any moment…
In a feeble attempt at disguising his feelings, Harry shoved him back before picking up his tea. “Piss off, wanker.”
Harry valiantly smiled at him. “That may be a first.”
Draco began fumbling at Harry’s flies with shaking fingers, suddenly desperate to get him naked. Harry’s lips were on him in an instant, kissing him, hard and eager. Draco moaned when Harry twisted his tongue lecherously against Draco’s, and he pulled clumsily at the zipper and button of Harry’s jeans until they were finally undone. Quickly he tugged at them, Harry taking the hint instantly and lifting himself up, helping Draco pull the jeans down a few inches, over his arse. Draco could see the top of Harry’s cock struggling against his jeans...
“So full of compliments this morning,” Draco said, smiling at him and reaching for the marmalade.
“And what else do you think, Harry?” he asked, covering his full mouth with his hand as he spoke. Damn, that was a bloody delicious cheese toastie.
“Warn me, Potter,” he mumbled, smoothing down his hair out of habit.
There was a long pause, the radio still playing softly in the background, and Draco once again fiddled with his wand, feeling Harry’s eyes on him. Suddenly he was a ball of nerves.
“Yeah, not fond at all."
“Wow,” Draco muttered. “That’s awful.”
The irony wasn’t lost on Harry that he had managed to deal with his problems far better when he was actually experiencing them in real-time; it was only long after the danger had passed that Harry truly felt the effects of it. It was a little exasperating that the horrors of his past kept him up at night more often now, at twenty-seven, than they had when he was a teenager.
“I’m halfway there already,” he muttered.
“You make me feel nervous,” Draco began, quietly. “I was afraid of the things I was starting to feel already, because it hit me so forcefully, and this is all totally out of nowhere. And, yes, it made me afraid, because I’m entirely powerless against you, Harry. That’s why I was acting so erratic in there. Because you make me feel as if I have no control, and that’s… That’s a feeling that I don’t handle well.”
everything.
“Perhaps,” Draco ceded, suddenly inspired. “Oh, shall we test it now?”
Hermione tucked a loose lock of hair behind her ears as Ron started to assist their daughter with her dinner. “Lord, is anyone else completely famished?”
Despite the less-than-ideal colleagues, and the fact that he wrote about the most humdrum of subjects, Draco was incredibly happy to have the job. At times he was even sort of glad to carry the title of auxiliary reporter (a fancy term for non-essential), because while he loved writing, he hated stress. Averaging one story per week left him with plenty of free time, though it was all too often spent serving as the newsroom errand boy and occasional emotional punching bag for the overworked reporters. He was fairly certain that at least half of his colleagues still thought he was an intern.
“No, actually I’m really fucking warm,” Harry nearly growled.
“I want to kiss you,” Draco said. “Very much.”
“I do,” Harry said.
Draco growled into his beer. “Must you say things like that, Potter?”
“Aren’t you leery of going out in public?”
“You trust me?” Draco repeated as he lifted an eyebrow. “Since when?”
“You do?” Draco asked.
“He was a bit hard to crack at first, so we started off with the least intimidating topics,” he explained. “Obviously this is just the tip of the iceberg.”
Draco breathed in and out, quickly, so quickly, and gradually felt himself rejoining his body. He had draped his arms loosely around Harry’s shoulders without telling himself to, his fingers laced together behind Harry’s neck. He opened his eyes and straightened his head to see that Harry was staring at him, an indefinable look on his face. Perhaps it was something like wonder.
“Well, Ron obviously laughed when I said your name, because he assumed it was a joke. Which I totally called, by the way.”
“Did you ever regret leaving Hogwarts before your final year?” he asked her a long while later. It was the final question on the page.
Draco felt his face grow warm as he looked down and tried to focus on the slow curl of steam coming from the spout of the teapot.
“Say the word and I’ll go tell them all now,” Harry whispered.
“It was pretty awful, yeah.” Harry chuckled to himself. “The worst part was that when I flooed her to ask about it she denied that she had said anything. I foolishly believed her, until she gave a full-blown interview the next day about how I was stalking and harassing her. She used a couple direct quotes that made me look a little less than gracious, so at least that was proof that the comments were actually from her this time, if somehow she was being honest when she said the first ones weren’t.”
“Oh,” Draco said softly. “I’d gathered you weren’t fond of her, but your face says that’s an understatement.”
Draco nodded. “Yes.”
“My apologies, Harry,” he said, his voice deathly quiet. “I was detained.”
“I wouldn’t do that,” he said gently.
“Piss off,” Draco chuckled. “You know what I mean.”
“Just a head rush,” Harry replied as Draco refilled his glass. “Reckon I could use another butterbeer.”
“It made me uncomfortable in a good way,” Harry said softly, resting his hand against Draco’s cheek. Draco leaned into it and kept looking into Harry’s eyes, unsure.
Breathing heavily with his eyes closed, Draco sighed deeply and rested his arm on top of his head. Before he could even form a coherent thought, he felt Harry’s tongue on his stomach and his eyes snapped open.
“Yes, please.” Draco grinned. “I feel as if I’m right on the cusp of it, but my drunken brain cannot connect the dots. It’s quite maddening, frankly.”
“I’m furious with you, Harry, and I’m going to throw this pillow directly at your head, and you’re going to fucking stand there and take it, and that’s the way it’s going to be!”
“Of course I want to fuck you, Harry,” he answered, unable to stop himself. “I want to bend you over this table right now and spread your arse open, use my mouth to stretch your hole for my cock, and pound you till you’re moaning my name like it’s a prayer.”
Harry forced a smile.
“Hi,” she said.
“Yes.”
“So what changed?” Draco felt reasonably less jittery about pursuing the breakup line of conversation and leaving the question of Potter’s sexuality behind them, at least until he could process it alone.
Harry gave him a sympathetic smile. “I’m sorry, angel. You deserve so much better than that.”
They both finally looked over at Ron and Hermione… who were staring back at them as if they had both lost their minds.
“Cheeky fucker,” Draco replied with another smirk.
“Why is it so hard for you to be honest?” Harry asked him.
Once he and Harry were alone, Draco felt nervous once again, and suddenly all he could think about were Harry’s rough fingers touching his own underneath the table. He could feel the tension crackling between them like a spell, and he couldn’t look at Harry again.
Harry tugged on his hair a little before planting a kiss on the top of his head. “Angel,” he whispered.
“Do you really think we’ll be able to stop at just wanking?” Harry asked, and the words made Draco instantaneously harder.
“I know this is too soon,” Harry said softly, his warm, loving eyes full of tears. “Way too soon. And I know I’m an impatient idiot and people won’t understand it and you have a dozen reasons to say no. But… don’t say no.”
Harry sighed and reluctantly smiled at him. “That’s awfully big of you.”
“Only around you,” Potter grumbled. “It’s been this way for ten bloody years. No one else gets to me the way you do, and I don’t understand why.”
“I do not,” Harry said, smiling and lacing his fingers through Draco’s soft blonde hair.
Draco could only breathe out something like a laugh, feeling almost hysterically euphoric, his legs feeling like water.
“You have no idea,” Ron mumbled in agreement. “The things he was saying about you yesterday were bloody disgusting.”
“Air,” he whispered to himself as he scrambled to his feet.
There was a ferocity in Harry’s eyes that stirred something in him. Harry touched the sides of Draco’s face.
PS: May I presume that you will be buying the first round, as you have so rudely deprived me of my wand for four years? You know, in the spirit of not making things awkward?
Draco shook his head slightly and took a few more deep breaths, and a few more deep swigs.
“Who the fuck is that arsehole?” Harry growled. “And if he were to receive a massive shipment of dungbombs, would anyone suspect your involvement?”
“Delicious,” Harry countered.
“Yes.”
“What was?”
“I forbid it,” he said, so quietly that Draco barely heard him. “I refuse.”
Draco just looked at him, still trying and failing to come up with a logical explanation as to why on earth he was still pushing the idiot away when he wanted so desperately to pull him closer.
Of course Harry would be thinking about other people's feelings at a moment like this; selflessness was another one of his best qualities. But if Draco was honest, he hadn't even thought about Hermione's news in light of his own personal life; his first and only concern had been for Harry, and that was new and terrifying for him.
“You said.”
Draco straightened his back and narrowed his eyes. “I assure you, I’ve put every effort into this story, and I will continue to do so--”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked.
“Banshees don’t
“You’re a prick,” Draco mimicked him, and now it was Harry’s turn to laugh at him.
“And you’re still going to have it all done by the thirtieth?”
“You think awfully highly of yourself, Scarhead.”
Harry laughed and leaned his forehead against Draco’s. “I love you so much.”
“Yeah, sure, whatever’s easiest for you,” Harry told him, shrugging.
“I want you to come first,” Draco said, as authoritatively as he could, despite his quivering voice. He was fighting off his own orgasm, and he knew that seeing Harry come for him would easily push him over the brink.
“You talk like a Victorian prince, I swear,” Harry said.
She looked at him curiously at the seemingly random choice of subject. “Yes, I had heard that. Months ago, as a matter of fact. Why on earth do you ask, darling?”
Draco smiled. “That’s because you are rather lovely, Harry.”
“You must be tired, too,” Harry said quietly, staring at her. Ron and Hermione were having another baby. Ron and Hermione were moving forward. Ron and Hermione were taking one more step away from him.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “Your mystery? You have a lot of attributes, Potter, but mystery is certainly not one of them. Nor, apparently, is humility.”
“More luck,” Draco interjected.
“I want to tell them, Draco,” Harry said gently. “You know that.”
“Hey, what do you usually do at the weekend?” Harry said a moment later, placing his hand on top of Draco’s.
He refused to let himself feel embarrassed about saying that, because it was so true. Draco had always known Harry was fiercely loyal to his friends, and he had been envious of it many times, including now. Draco wanted to be the reason Harry’s face lit up.
“Anyways, the only other physical experience I’ve had was a fairly steamy makeout session with one Ravi Hewitt. I was in sixth year, he was in seventh. He found out I was gay, or guessed it maybe. So he took a chance and cornered me in the locker room after a Quidditch practice and kissed me. And how could I resist such bravery?”
He reached a hand out from underneath his blanket and mindlessly traced the black lettering on Harry’s shirt, just staring at his striking face, watching the way the sunrise painted the features into something new.
Their mouths met in an aggressive kiss, desperate for each other. Draco felt Harry’s erection poking stiff against his leg, and Draco was fully hard as well. He refused to let himself feel nervous as he rutted up against Harry, grasping at Harry’s body as their tongues writhed against one another.
He set down his quill, and for a moment, he observed the top of Potter’s head, still nestled in his folded arms. Draco felt inexplicably peaceful as he looked at him. Merlin, Harry’s hair was very shiny. He wondered what it would feel like if he ran his fingers through it; would it be soft? Oh, what a humiliating thought. But, would it? Merlin’s sake, it had been far too long since he’d had a shag.
“There’s something you should know…”
Draco took the cup and had a sip before answering. “As if your ego needs any more stroking.”
“With bells on?” Harry asked, poking at his arm playfully. Draco thought they might have to get some sobering potion in him before they did anything else.
“He’ll buy me whatever I want, of course,” Draco continued. “Shower me with endless compliments. And when he asks me about that silly hairy-chested boy I fell for when I was young and foolish, we’ll both laugh and laugh. And then shag some more.”
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked him after a few moments of quiet smiles. “Is your head okay? Are you in any pain?”
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco groaned as he snickered, yielding to the most innocent of his impulses and running a hand through Harry’s thick hair.
“Fine, five on three, so much better!” Draco said. “I was humiliated!”
Draco was beaming. He sighed. “You complete sap.”
“Why do you always smell so good?” Harry muttered into his chest, before Draco could probe further.
“You’re going to Wales tomorrow?” Draco asked. He wasn’t sure why he felt so taken aback by the information; it wasn’t as if it mattered. “For how long?”
Harry grinned. “Do you think I’m good looking?”
“Scary, isn’t it?”
This wasn’t a version of Malfoy that Harry could easily reconcile with everything he thought he knew about him, and it made Harry vaguely uncomfortable. Speaking with Draco now, Harry simply couldn’t justify the way he’d treated him in the past. Furthermore, he hadn’t been ready to feel such a strange and overwhelming sense of kinship with the man; it made him suddenly regret all of the things he had done to Malfoy over the years.
Draco let out a lofty ‘hmph’ and lifted his chin. “What of it?”
“Stop fishing for compliments, it’s very unbecoming.”
“I feel like you’re trying to get rid of a bad one-night stand,” Harry muttered, a little insecure all of a sudden.
“And now you’re referring to yourself in the third person,” Harry laughed. “Could you be any more annoying?”
“Nothing major,” he replied evasively.
to manhandle you. In every way. Preferably until neither of us can walk anymore,” Harry growled, low and seductive, looking hungrily at Draco’s mouth.
“Oh, no,” she laughed, gesturing towards the back of the shop. “You can just head on back, sir. Just through there and down the hall, on the left. Door’s always open.”
Harry fixed him with wide eyes, and Draco rolled his own.
Harry lifted his head at that moment and stared at Draco with a wary look on his face. Rather than break their eye contact, Draco stared back, mesmerized. Now that he was really looking, Harry Potter was actually even more attractive than he’d initially thought. No, Harry Potter was…
Potter laughed again, this time looking over at Draco as he did so. Draco stared back, and for the first time he realized he was smiling again, smiling back at Potter as if they were both enjoying themselves.
“Interviewing Ron and Hermione,” he explained anyway.
He took another deep breath and tried again. “I grew up there, and of course there are fond memories, and I cherish those. I was the centre of my parents’ universe. I could do no wrong in their eyes. Sometimes my mother would sneak up behind me and give me a hug and kiss the top of my head until I laughed. My father taught me to fly a broom and then practiced with me when I made the quidditch team. I always knew that I was loved. And that house contained all those memories for me, all those feelings.”
“I think I’m a bit pissed,” he said, then chuckled a little at the truth of it.
Draco snorted. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco snorted. He stared straight ahead and took a deep breath. He could say it again; he had said it earlier. But this time felt heavier.
Harry pulled his head away abruptly, and Draco did the same, looking up at him in confusion. But Harry looked positively delighted.
Draco snorted at him; served him right for tormenting him with Patrick sodding Hunter. Draco sent another bean flying his way and Harry caught it effortlessly.
“Is it short for Harold?” Malfoy continued. “Henry? Harrison? I know your middle name is James, after your father, but there was some debate about the origin of your first name while I was researching. Is Harry also a family name? Or was your shaggy black mane the sole inspiration for the moniker?”
He felt Harry sit down very close beside him on the small bench.
Harry gave him a reluctant grin.
Draco inhaled sharply. “What?”
“Well, rest assured, I’m not suing anyone,” Draco grumbled. “You’re welcome.”
“Hey!” Harry laughed with him. “Eat dirt.”
,’ and took another jelly bean. ‘
“Were you attracted to me at Hogwarts?”
“Mr Potter has requested that you be the one to conduct the interview.”
“That was… what, exactly?” Draco said in a daze.
Would Potter respond? Draco tried to ignore the fact that he wanted to read another letter from Potter, tried to pretend that he wouldn’t be thinking about it all day.
“I’m sorry,” he said quickly. “It’s just… I’m actually not…”
Harry nodded. “A cupboard.”
“Plenty,” Malfoy smirked. “Faintly irksome and highly ill-mannered, for example; but above all, incredibly intriguing.”
Draco shrugged. “Well… yes, essentially.”
“Bollocks,” Draco said, taking another sip of his tea regardless. “Although, this certainly isn’t half bad.”
“Yeah, turns out Malfoy’s not nearly as bad as we thought,” Harry stated, grinning at Draco as he said it.
’ was the sole word on the paper.
Harry snickered.
Harry grinned. “Sorry, David.”
“Please, tell me what you’re thinking.”
“I’m waiting, Malfoy.”
Harry laughed at his reaction. “Well, I think it's sweet, anyway.”
He sighed. “I know. But I want to see how charming you are with a three year old.”
“I see.”
Draco huffed and fiddled with his tie. “Who was flirting?”
“Come on,” Harry said gently. “Stay. It’s still only like five in the evening. And you don’t really have to go into work tomorrow anyway, since it’s a weekend and they know you’re on assignment now, so you could theoretically stay all night. If you wanted.”
“Oh bollocks, are you one of those grammar weirdos?” Harry asked, smiling.
Draco moaned again. “Harry… yes, Harry, jerk me off. Jerk us both off.”
Draco’s breath hitched and his vision seemed to blur, zeroing in on Harry’s darkening eyes.
“I wonder how many hours of life you’ve wasted just doing your hair,” Harry teased him, flying low in a circle around Draco. “Dammit, would you bloody well hurry up, Malfoy?”
The strange owl hooted at him from the windowsill as if to urge him on, and Draco looked down warily at the letter on the table.
“Fine,” he said bravely. “Ask away. Draco.”
“Yes, I’m sure you do,” Draco said, shifting in his seat. “Now let me tumble into my drunken stupor alone, if you won’t join me there.”
“Don’t forget, it’s Saturday,” Draco reminded him. “Very few reporters make a habit of coming in at the weekends, which is why it was a particularly unpleasant surprise seeing Alex here this morning. And believe me, if I’d known he was here, I wouldn’t’ve bothered coming in either; being forced to endure him during the week is punishment enough.”
“You can show me around.”
But he had to admit it stung a little all the same, knowing that Potter didn’t immediately hear his posh drawl, for example, or spot the way his mouth drew down at the corners. It was further proof of Harry’s total lack of interest in him. Or perhaps Draco had just changed in the last few years. Everyone he knew seemed to think so.
“Granger falling asleep on her feet is a good indicator that we’ve long overstayed our welcome,” Draco teased.
“Alright,” he said, surprisingly conceding.
Draco smiled back. He loved it when Harry called him a wanker.
“I love you,” Harry nearly sobbed. “More than anything…”
“No,” Harry said casually.
“It’s Ron, remember?” Ron teased. “I know I’ve aged ten years, but let’s try not to be rude.”
Harry inadvertently trembled at the words. “No.”
Harry smiled back at him. “I guess not. But I’m sure you can think of something, given that your imagination is just as vivid as mine.”
“Look, it’s nothing,” Harry asserted once more, but he knew he wasn’t at all convincing. “I just think he’s kind of cool.”
“Yes, obviously that does happen to you sometimes,” Draco said, and regretting it immediately. “My apologies, I shouldn’t have brought it up again.”
I really don’t know how to start this letter, except to say that it has
The thought shot into his head without pause, but Draco knew it was another honest and true thought, because it felt so at home and completely
“Well, we’re both just so unequivocally good at sex,” Draco murmured, his eyes fluttering shut as Harry gently raked his teeth over Draco’s skin.
“I’m surprised you don’t take sugar,” Draco said, deciding that small talk may, in fact, be the best way to go now. “Weren’t you always quite the animal come dessert time back at school?”
“I know you are, Harry.” He tried to smile. “It’s just… Well, he--”
“Anyway, what’s the big deal?” Ron asked him. “You know me and Hermione don’t really care. Sure, he did a lot of shit things, but all of that’s ancient history.”
“Potter--”
He had to admit that Draco wasn’t entirely off the mark, however; Hermione did seem a little frosty. Understandably so, of course, but it was discouraging nonetheless. Harry felt guilty all over again for springing Draco on her and Ron.
But Rose was perched in Ron’s arms, facing Harry and Draco, looking very sweet in her white cotton pyjamas, and Harry’s ire waned
“No,” Draco said.
“Scoot over a bit, will you, Harry?” Ron asked him without ceremony, nudging at his arm impatiently for only a moment before giving up and shoving Harry’s entire chair over to the left.
Thanks for your patience, everyone! Enjoy this chapter! :)
A tiny stone fireplace in the center of the far wall was the room’s crowning glory, and Draco looked forward to lighting a fire each evening once it became cold enough. A fluffy grey and white rug sat in front of the cozy hearth. Draco had spent hours on that rug, staring into a blazing fire and getting lost in thought.
“Why were you named Harry?” he asked.
“Why are you doing that?” Harry asked him, staring mysteriously at his lap.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked him quietly.
“Certainly not, Potter,” Draco said, “and I’m insulted by the suggestion.”
Harry moved his hands, hesitantly tracing the scars on Draco’s chest once again.
There was no resisting Draco’s pull now; Harry’s body had taken over his logic, and the idea of putting distance between them was abhorrent to him now. In fact, there was too much distance between them as it was.
“Ridiculous, more like.”
Draco wordlessly sat down and picked up his wand, vanishing the spilled tea from the coffee table. When the surface was dry and Draco could no longer avoid Harry’s eyes, he slowly shifted in his seat, turning his body to the side so that he was sitting cross-legged on the couch, completely facing Harry.
“What face?”
“Please, let’s not talk about the weather,” Draco mumbled in disgust, draping his jacket over the back of what had become his usual chair at the kitchen table. Harry adored watching him make himself at home. “You know how I detest small talk.”
“You have some very telling mannerisms,” he said, leaning back slightly and observing Potter over his glass.
“Yes, I do know,” Draco answered.
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco said firmly, trying to calm him with his voice. “People are knobs sometimes. At any rate, I seldom go out in the magical world at all, much less without a glamor.”
“A wee bit?” Draco repeated skeptically. “A wee bit, he says!”
“Hi,” Harry said, smiling jovially.
“These fickle sods were singing my praises not ten minutes ago,” Ron complained good-naturedly, using his wand to pick up a runaway noodle from the floor.
And there it was. He heard it immediately, now that he was consciously looking for it: the heavenly sound of Harry snoring softly behind him. It made Draco want to weep.
“Well, you’ve obviously changed,” she told him, running her fingers lazily through Rose’s ginger hair. “Perhaps people see that.”
“You do?” Draco asked, looking sufficiently distracted.
“Well, I’m sorry, maybe I’m just a nonsensical little tosser.”
Harry was the star of every scene.
“I am sorry, though, Draco, and not just for wasting your time,” Harry said, feeling shy and embarrassed. “I know I was a little… a little forward last night. I guess I can be kind of… erm, flirtatious when I’m drinking. So… sorry. If that made you uncomfortable at all, I mean.”
Harry just stared.
“Very well,” Draco said, smiling indulgently.
Draco’s remarks only reminded him that their time together had an expiration date, and all of a sudden, he felt sick to his stomach. They both lifted their teacups and took an awkward sip in silence. Draco adjusted his writing supplies, ignoring him for a few minutes, until Harry kicked his foot against Draco’s.
“Fuck,” Harry whispered, pushing a lock of hair from Draco’s forehead. “You look absolutely debauched.”
Draco just stared, astonished. He had not been expecting that, either, but it seemed to make a little more sense as he rolled it around in his shocked mind. He felt himself nodding almost unconsciously, just looking into Potter’s slightly wary green eyes.
“I thought maybe I scared you away,” Harry admitted, unfiltered again. “When you were gone for so long.”
“But he--”
“Professional restrictions?” Harry snorted. “We’ve already obliterated most of those, honey.”
“The bacon, or your chest hair?” Draco grinned.
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat and turned to see that Ron and Harry were finally descending, merrily tossing the quaffle between them. Mercifully, Weasley looked to be only teasing him and, in true Weasley fashion, had sufficiently managed to ruin the moment. Draco couldn’t say he was too upset about that in this instance; he felt as if he’d just run the longest race of his life.
“You’re sleeping!” Draco exclaimed rather stupidly.
“Of course, I have nothing further that I wish to discuss. And again, I do apologize, Ms Peters,” Draco muttered guiltily. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you meeting with me today.”
Harry thought that was a very good way to start.
“You’re looking remarkably well, dear,” she said, studying him carefully. “Your skin is positively glowing.”
Harry couldn’t control himself any longer; he stood up and began pacing the tiny room, on edge. He could feel Draco’s eyes following his every step now. How could Draco be so okay with this? How could he always be so resigned to the abuse?
“But it’s your past,” Harry said simply. “It’s done. That’s not really who you are anymore.”
Harry pulled away with a groan. “If you keep kissing me like that, I’ll get hard again.”
Without warning (or a snarky retort), Harry wrapped both of his hands tightly around Draco’s oversized coffee mug. To be fair, Draco had set it almost directly in front of him, since the table was hardly big enough to hold everything he’d laid on it. Nevertheless, Draco reached over and smacked him on the wrist.
!” Draco shouted, looking uncharacteristically flustered.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. Very sure. I want to climb onto your rooftop and tell the entire world, actually.”
“But,” she said, “I take issue with his one condition.”
“Your good sense is one of my favorite things about you, Draco,” Harry said. “But you’re listing off all the things that could go wrong in just about any relationship, not just ours specifically. And I don’t see any reason why we need to let those doubts into this, because despite what
“Well, that makes it all okay then.” Harry was gazing at him with pure love. “At least I can die in peace, knowing that you’ll be well taken care of.”
“Summer?” Harry grinned. “Wear a lot of jumpers in the summer, do you?”
Draco groaned and gently smacked his own face once or twice to force himself to focus. He was really acting quite ridiculous; any self-respecting Slytherin would shake their head at him if they could see him now. But it really wasn’t his fault. Harry just did things to him. Mmm, Harry.
“You know I believe that, Potter,” Draco said with a smile. “And I’ll see it someday. But not today.”
Draco shrugged noncommittally and Harry drank deeply from his bottle.
“Hardly,” Draco muttered, finally smiling at him as he took the coffee. “Thank you, pet.”
Harry sighed again. “You don’t know that.”
“Hi,” Potter replied.
“Well, that certainly eliminates the vast majority of my classmates,” he said at last, all the flirtation now gone from his voice. “Their hatred of me was totally justified, of course. I was an arrogant little prick at best, and pure evil at worst.”
“No.”
Draco shook his head. “But you’re not normal.”
As awkward as it sometimes was to be the third wheel in their friendship, he had truly adored watching the two of them progress into what they were today. But every so often (like now, for instance, as he watched Ron steal a sip from Hermione’s teacup as if it was supposed to be for both of them all along), Harry felt a pang of envy at their love. He wanted to share his cup of tea with someone, too. He wanted someone to think he was fetching. He wanted love to be easy.
“I think it might,” Harry muttered.
Draco wasn’t too confused to let the compliment settle on him like a fresh spring rain, calming and delighting him at once. He felt a shy smile creep onto his face.
“Normal
There was a letter on Draco’s desk when he arrived at work on Friday morning, and he abandoned his coffee (and his already precarious self-respect) in favor of lunging at it eagerly, hoping it was from Harry. Sure enough, a short note was scrawled on a torn-out piece of notebook paper, looking like it had traveled from overseas instead of just a few kilometers away.
“Are you trying to trap me into admitting how I feel about you?” Draco teased to avoid answering.
“I don’t hate you,” Draco argued.
Harry sighed and rolled his eyes. “Walls, walls, walls.”
Draco nodded, unwittingly fascinated already. “What kinds of thoughts?”
“Oh fuck, sorry,” he said anxiously, pulling his hand swiftly away. “I swear that was not intentional.”
Harry laughed and kissed his forehead again. “Alright. Then I love hearing you talk, too. And you’re perfect.”
“I don’t want to lose you either,” fell from Draco’s mouth, and he clutched tightly at the fabric of Harry’s t-shirt.
Draco glared at him. “Fine…” How bad could it be?
She scanned the first sheet and furrowed her brow, which made Draco a little nervous.
Rosalind sighed again. “Yes, I’m painfully aware of all that. After all, this is the key feature in our ten-year anniversary special edition, one of the most important issues since Cuffe retired, the most important of my career thus far, and you’re a bloody auxiliary reporter, for Merlin’s sake.”
Harry leaned against the doorframe and gave Draco one of his loving looks as he pulled the button of his jeans closed. Draco gazed upon his hairy chest, his slightly crooked glasses, and his dishevelled black hair, and wondered if anyone else in the world fell in love like this.
He heard Draco’s breath hitch, and Harry swallowed, staring straight ahead, his nerves so tense that the slightest breeze through the open window might’ve knocked him to the floor. Was this allowed? Was he crossing a line? Merlin, he must be; this felt fucking illegal. Draco had only to move his leg away, or to slide his chair an inch or two to the left, and the spell--and all that was left of Harry’s hope--would be shattered.
They both held each other’s gaze. Finally Harry released an audible sigh.
“Except for Patrick Hunter,” Draco muttered, before he could think better of it.
Draco smiled sympathetically before he continued taking notes.
“That’s right,” Ron agreed. “It was a minor mention, not a real mention.”
But Draco
Draco looked over at him, feigning innocence. “Oh?"
Their eyes locked, and Harry was thrown back to the coffee shop. ‘
He handed his tea cup back to Harry, who took it with a smile.
“Yeah. I like flying; dunno if you knew that about me,” Harry joked.
“No, but--”
Then, suddenly, Draco realized something.
“Well,” Draco replied, “there is a certain resemblance between Weasley and himself, as regards their total immaturity on a broomstick.”
“Come on in,” Ron muttered without looking up.
Draco cleared his throat and took a deep breath before sauntering over to Potter’s table, fists clenched tightly.
“Oh,” Draco said. He looked at the table. “Sometimes it’s odd to think that I have a cousin, really. Well. Had.”
Draco gaped at her, aghast. “Wh-- no… we’re not--”
“I am nothing if not efficient.”
“And you never have to,” Harry argued, scooting forward to the edge of his seat. “Don’t talk like this.”
“I wouldn’t have you any other way,” Draco said truthfully.
Ron shook his head as if Harry had been serious. “S’alright, we’ll wait till you’ve gone home.”
Harry deepened the kiss, and Draco responded in kind, pulling Harry’s body flush against his own. Harry melted into him, wrapping his arms over Draco’s shoulders.
