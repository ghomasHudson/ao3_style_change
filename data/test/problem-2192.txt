“Then of course Gramma Cissy knows,” Albus adds taking in the amused faces of the other Slytherins.
“Sure, but you are aware of what my Patronus is,” Draco says quietly.
“Oh sure,” Draco smirks, “and you are sure it isn’t because you know we are better than any Gryffindor.”
“Guess I forgot.”
Whispers erupted around the classroom, and Draco spoke again, “I can tell I am not going to get your attention back on potions for a while, so is there anything else you wanted to ask?”
“Fraternal twins,” Scorpius reminded him, “Also if we looked identical the world would have known when we were born.”
‘You ready?’ Albus thinks.
“Well, I have never seen either of them with a wedding ring on,” some other girl adds in, “and their sons both suspiciously don’t have mothers.”
“Good idea,” Draco says with a tired smile, “I can get those changed tomorrow if you bring them to me.”
“Riddikulus,” Harry says, and the boggart doesn’t turn into anything funny, it just dissolves into black dust and floats back to the cabinet. Harry then turns to his son who is sitting on the floor with Scorpius kneeled next to him, “It's alright. I am right here.”
“I like that idea,” Draco says, copying his husband’s action.
“Does too.”
“Professor Malfoy? Would you care to demonstrate?” Harry asks with a soft tone that most people don’t hear.
“I understand Headmistress,” Albus speaks up.
“We have the quidditch game at the end of the week, maybe we could get our jerseys changed to Malfoy-Potter,” Scorpius offers.
‘Our parents,’ his tone clipped, ‘I know the reason that they kept this a secret was so the whole wizarding world didn’t invade our lives, but it feels weird acting like dad is just my teacher.’
“Yeah, it was the first fear I thought of when I stepped in front of the boggart,” Harry says, flicking his hand and watching as the desks and chairs go back to their correct spot.
Across the Great Hall, Scorpius and Albus heard their fair share of the rumors and even got a few questions, but were mainly left to their own, except their friends who never had enough of teasing them.
“Well, now the entire wizarding world knows,” Zach said, skimming through the paper.
“It seems like something that would happen,” Louis says turning back to his soup.
“Okay, so for wordless magic, the key is to think really hard about the spell you want to perform,” Harry says, pointing his wand at a Rubik's cube sitting on his desk, and it floats, “see? Now you give it a try.”
The Gryffindor Seeker, Roxxane Weasley, has also caught sight of the snitch and is now flying directly behind Scorpius. Scorpius reaches forward to try to grab the snitch, but it zooms up just out of his reach. Both seekers fly up and just before Roxxane could grab it, the snitch goes impossibly faster, making a dart to the stands where the teachers are sat.
It was almost a month before Zachary and Vincent could convince everyone that they should get together for some games. That meant almost a month of people spreading rumors and a lot of people moved on to other gossip, but Zabini and Goyle were still convinced to figure out what was going on.
“I forgot how much I missed flying,” Harry starts, “And I miss playing Quidditch, but I don’t like all the praise that I get for it.” He pauses, “Like it feels like I don’t deserve it.”
“I think that after all this time, I should get used to it,” Harry says turning to his husband, “But I never really do.”
“Potter, Truth or Dare?”
“Goodbye,” Scorpius says giving his dads a hug, “well kinda.”
“Best not be late,” Harry calls after them.
Draco turned to Harry almost as if asking, ‘should I talk about this?’ and just received a nod.
“How was the rest of dinner?” Albus asks.
“I mean it is a very protective talent,” Draco’s face falling serious, “To spare you the details, I learned this skill while Voldemort was staying at the manor, and it helped me to sleep at night.”
“Malfoy, Potter,” Zachary Zabini says as he moves over to be sitting across from the brothers, not that Zabini knows they are, “how was your lockdown, it feels like I haven’t talked to you two in so long.”
“Well,” Roxxane starts kind of laughing, “Either that snitch really liked you,” she pointed to Harry, “or you are a way better seeker than we will ever be because you barely moved and you caught it.”
“Wait, one thing,” Zach starts then gestures between him and Vincent, “Our parents were close with Malfoy, so why didn’t they know?”
“Hey!” the other three exclaimed, offended.
“That is precisely what they do,” Harry says, “a boggart can be whatever you are afraid of, that is what makes them so powerful, it also makes them very dangerous. But the one thing that can stop a boggart is laughter, so there is the spell ‘Riddikulus’ that can make whatever the boggart had turned into, funny.”
“Zach, you were in all of our classes, you should know,” Scorpius says grabbing his pajamas to get ready for bed.
“God fucking damn it,” Albus swore under his breath when he saw the headline on the front page.
“Sure, well, ‘Mr. Potter’ is also my dad,” everyone’s jaws hit the floor, no one spoke up so Scorpius continues, “Our dads kept it mostly secret so it wouldn’t become this big deal.”
“Well, I am sure you two were having your cute moment and all,” Scorpius says.
“They are good,” Harry says standing crossing the room to give Draco a kiss, “they are getting really good at simple spells with wordless magic.”
“Your auras,” she says, and when she sees the confusion on the two men’s faces she elaborates, “Your auras are like the magical force that makes you who you are, I had noticed that your auras were very similar, making the two of you compatible, back in your second year. After that, I started the bet with Albus and Severus about the two of you.”
“Then go to sleep,” Vincent says.
“Go on,” Harry encouraged and opened the cabinet back up.
“Well, I am just excited to see which house wins the house cup this year,” Draco says kissing Harry on the cheek, “I personally hope it’s Slytherin.”
The Gryffindor table is buzzing at dinner that night. Mainly with theories to why Malfoy’s Patronus was a stag.
“See you guys in the morning,” Albus’ voice flat, walked out of the room without saying anything else.
“Of course,” Draco stood up and held his hands out for Harry to pull himself up, but in their sleepy state, harry almost made them fall over when he collapsed into Draco’s chest, “You okay to walk inside?”
Harry had gotten his fair share of praise for his ‘acts of heroism’, but he found them often too much to handle sometimes. So, when the whole school just saw him catch a small fast-flying ball while barely moving a muscle, that was sure to earn him praise and too much attention cast in his direction.
Draco followed his husband and caught up to him just outside the quidditch pitch, “Hey,” his voice was soft and comforting as loud noises often reminded them of less fun memories, “how are you feeling?”
One set of footsteps come bounding down the stairs, followed by a cool voice, “Good Morning Dad.”
“I don’t think they are ready to hear that,” Albus says with a smirk.
“Of course, honey,” a voice calls back.
“True,” Draco says.
The whole Slytherin common room was silent and everyone seemed to be deep in thought.
‘It’s not just about the bet,’ Scorpius says in his head as they sit down with their friends.
“Well,” Albus says, trailing off.
“Good job both of you, it takes a lot of practice to get it perfect,” Harry says, “we have the whole hour so we might as well use it.”
“Okay fine, I’m sorry, just don’t get Dad,” Scorpius says, and he hears footsteps outside the door, their other roommates must be back from dinner.
“I wonder if his Patronus changed because they are in love?”
“Sure, but may I ask why?” Draco asks, he knows that Harry would have a good reason that he wants company, as he usually sat alone on Halloween.
“Yes.”
“Scorpius Malfoy-Potter seems to have spotted the snitch,” the announcer calls, the stands turn to watch the seeker, but just about every person in the stands is shocked by the announcement of the double last name.
“You know Dad’s old map?” Albus turns to his brother, “According to Ron and Hermione, he used to use it to follow Father around.”
The gossip about the Slytherin and Gryffindor heads of house was also taking over many groups around the Hall, maybe because it was Harry Potter, but this seemed to spread faster than most other gossip the school had.
“They are currently reading up about dementors, then I am teaching them about Patronus’,” Harry explains when an idea hits him, “would you like to join the class, so that way I can have another example.”
Could the boy’s true parents be revealed? Has Harry Potter fallen into the trap of the once evil Malfoy? Were the boys raised with by this unconventional family? All questions that will be answered in due time.
“Hay is for horses my love,” Harry says, stepping backwards away from the big crowd of people who have gathered to congratulate both teams, and to Harry’s dismay, Harry.
“So, the possibilities of you two becoming step-brothers are now more and more possible,” Vincent teases, the boys just share a look, kind of suggesting that he couldn’t be further from figuring out the truth.
“Hey Dad,” Albus calls as he walks into the lounge alongside Draco.
“Okay, I know you two have played a seekers game before,” Harry says, Harry and Draco, along with many others of their chosen family had taught their kids how to fly from a young age, “So I expect you to be able to pull this off with no problems.”
“He really is, he was even more insufferably humble when we were in school,” Draco says before Harry elbows him in the side, “Hey!”
The Slytherin common room only ever felt lively when people decide to play games, on every other day it was damp and gloomy. So today when there is a group of many students gathered in a circle sprawled across various furniture was one of those days it felt fun. They had played a few rounds of never have I ever, and some of the younger students had decided it was too late to be up on a school night, now the game was coming to an end when Scorpius whined, “Hey, that’s targeting.”
Let’s just say that the actions following this weren’t what you call “Family-friendly” so I shall leave it to your imagination and continue with the story.
“I would be fine if they did know,” Albus says, “But I was scared that I was going to be the reason that our secret would be shared.”
“Well, when I last faced one in school it had turned into a dementor, but my greatest fear is fear itself. So, my boggart has always changed based on what my current fears are,” there is a certain sadness in his eyes as he says these words, as the last time he had stepped in front of a boggart, it had shown him the most horrifying image. His two sons and husband lying on the floor helpless, dead.
“Best be off to the library,” Albus says waving to his dad, “McGonagall is having us write 3 pages for transfiguration.”
“So how would we do this?” Albus asks.
Draco involuntarily smiles at the mention of the man, “Yes, yes I am.”
“I just came to see how you were doing, as I don’t have a class this block and I was bored,” Draco explains, “so, what are you teaching?”
“Fine, I dare you to tell us who your mother is,” Zabini says.
“I do,” Draco breaths out before closing the gap between them, the kiss was slow and loving, only to be interrupted by Scorpius in the doorway clearing his throat.
“Well, then at least tell us what is going on with your dads,” Zabini begged.
“Yes?”
“Okay, take your positions,” Draco says handing Harry his broom which he had summoned.
“I know you are a Gryffindor and all, but please tell me you are rooting for Slytherin to win,” Draco whispers to Harry.
The infected students were given a potion that was to cure the virus within a few hours and were told to wait in the classrooms and the food of the feast was going to be brought to each classroom.
“Well that is a relief,” Hugo chimes in, “It has been really weird not seeing my friends for the last 6 months. So maybe we can go back to as normal as possible for a while.”
“Since your second year,” McGonagall says nonchalantly.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry says, but his tone is way too fond for the words to stick, he then turns back to the field as Slytherin scores again, making them tied.
Both Albus and Scorpius run upstairs to check on their trunks and that leaves Harry and Draco in the kitchen. With a flick of Harry's wrist, the plates go flying to the sink and start washing themselves, when Draco had first learned how little Harry needed spells or even his wand, he had kept saying how uncommon that was to be that in control of your powers, but by now it was just normal.
“Al, no, please no,” Scorpius begged.
“Good job, I am proud of you both,” Draco says, as the two seekers walk up to them.
“Good morning Scorpius,” Harry says with a tired smile, meeting his son at the bottom of the stairs, “Kreature is making breakfast, then we should be off to school.”
“Speaking of,” this gets Harry’s attention, “when are you going to give them your dad’s old map?”
“Well, they will be answered,” Albus took a sip of his orange juice, “Eventually.”
In the library, there are Rose, Scorpius, and Albus sitting in silence writing their essays before dinner when Rose spoke up.
“I barely even think about it before I do it anymore,” Scorpius realizes.
“Okay, does anyone want to play truth or dare?” One of the 6th years asked.
“OUR dads?” Zach finally made out.
“Yes, Patronus’ can change forms,” Harry says shooting a glance over to Draco, “the change can happen when you are deeply in love with someone, or you had a major shift in your character. They don’t always change, but when they do it is stemmed from powerful change.”
“Sure, whatever you say,” Harry takes Draco’s outstretched hand and stands to walk to the kitchen.
Just as suspected, when the newspaper was dropped in front of Harry the front page was plastered with a moving picture of Draco and him sat with arms draped around each other at the quidditch game from the day before.
“I just do what needs to be done, everything else just happens,” Harry says, taking a quick look down to the Slytherin table to check on their sons, “I sure hope they stay out of trouble this year.”
“Okay brooms in the air,” Madame Hooch calls and everyone flies up, “Ready, set, go.”
“Your boggart turned into Voldemort, right?”
“Thank you,” Harry says, “and to my knowledge, your Patronus made a change.”
The class seems to be jotting down notes, when someone’s hand sticks into the air, “Vincent, you have a question?”
“Yes please Andy, that would be lovely. I'll go in the sitting room with Teddy.” After an okay from andromeda I head to the sitting room and find Teddy already there attempting to put his coat on.
I opened the door as quietly as I could and peered inside to see what kind of mood Draco was in. What I saw froze me and made my heart break. Draco was sitting at the table (the one he’d made the elf’s move in here just so he and I could eat in private) with his head in his hand clearly sobbing his heart out, his dinner and mine just sat there going cold. I must have made a noise then because Draco looked up and over to where I stood. Tears ran down his face, as well as snot, and his eyes were red rimmed. It looked like he had been crying for a while. When he saw me he turned away and wiped his face and then tried to pretend nothing had happened.
My mouth presses in a hard line.
“Yes.”
17    The Dominant and the Submissive have discussed the activities set out in Appendix 3 and recorded in writing on Appendix 3 their agreement in respect of them.
A couple of minutes later, Draco comes around.
“You look fantastic, Draco. This open neck suits you, and I get to see and feel all this beautiful skin.”
“What?” He asks cautiously.
“Ron’s last day in and he gets called out?” I ask Hermione.
‘I agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my punishment ought to be; only - only - don't make it more than I can bear!’
“Goodnight grandma, goodnight uncle Draco. Thanks for today.” He says sleepily. They say their good nights back and we head upstairs.
15.20    The Submissive shall submit to any sexual activity demanded by the Dominant and shall do so without hesitation or argument.
“Ermm...well our cook has just left to take his break, but I could make you a sandwich?” I duck my head to hide my persistent blush.
“Hey Hermione, how are you?” I ask, finally looking around to her.
Draco x
“You lived with him?”
“Is there anything i can do?” I ask him and place his dressing gown over his shoulders to keep him warm.
“Hey, are you okay?” I stopped him and lifted his chin. He smiled and looked back down.
I help her up and give her a big hug.
“I can guess.” he teases softly.
“Yep that's right, ducks.” Draco laughs at me coming over.
A few minutes later we are chatting and watching Teddy play with the ducks. He’s giggling and running around with them pretending to quack.
“I think you’re clean enough now.” he murmurs, and he stops. What! No! No! No! My breathing is ragged.
“And this is my brother, Ethan Parkinson,” says Pansy to Harry.
“So you are graduating this week?” Lily asks.
“I won't be able to go to their graves this Halloween. Draco’s due just 10 days before.” I tell them sadly after most of the tears have stopped.
Sorry I’m late posted this chapter. Enjoy x
“Draco!”
“Did you put me in bed?”
“I never said that! You look beautiful and you can’t even tell a difference.” He seems to calm a bit then and takes a breath.
“Well, I’m sure Dobby will get them out.” He swishes his hand and the sheets fly into the wash basket and new ones are put on. Does he ever use a wand?
“I don't know what Severus wants to do.”
“You look at that house and what we have been through. Then put yourself in Draco’s shoes and imagine you found out that the girl you bullied throughout school and who got torchered by your aunt, had done this to you, how would you feel, Hermione?!” Now she looked like she might cry. Dammit, I can’t feel guilty. I need to defend Draco.
“Has he used any strenuous magic today?” She sounds a bit less worried now and Harry calms even more.
7    The Dominant shall take responsibility for the well-being and the proper training, guidance, and discipline of the Submissive. He shall decide the nature of such training, guidance, and discipline and the time and place of its administration, subject to the agreed terms, limitations, and the safety procedures set out in this contract or agreed additionally under clause 3 above.
The hall is crowded. Severus has gone to sit with the other parents and well-wishers in the back of the hall. I’m wearing my robes properly now, closed so my muggle clothes aren’t showing, and my cap, and I feel protected by them, anonymous. There is no one on the stage yet, but I can’t seem to steady my nerves. My heart is pounding, and my breathing is shallow. He’s here, somewhere. I wonder if Pansy is talking to him, interrogating him maybe. I make my way to my seat amongst fellow students whose surnames also begin with M. I am in the second row, affording me yet more anonymity. I glance behind me and spot Severus way in the back. I give him a wave. He self-consciously gives me a half-wave, half-salute back. I sit and wait.
After she’s gone, I sit and read the contract again, making more notes as I go. When I’ve finished, I fire up the laptop, ready to respond.
“But I know you’ve not done this before. Initially, we’ll take it slowly, and I will help you. We’ll build up to various scenarios. I want you to trust me, but I know I have to earn your trust, and I will. The ‘or otherwise’ - again it’s to help you get into the mindset; it means anything goes.”
“Wait really?”
“Sure.”
“Oh okay, i hope Draco is okay.” He says with a sad face.
“Hiya, Greg. How are you? Why are you back here? America kicked you out?” I tease him.
“What are you doing here Malfoy?” I say to him angrily and hold Teddy closer to me.
Harry Potter
“I know Harry, I was just being stupid.... Can I stay here tonight?”
He is still frowning at me when I calm down and simply incline my head to him.
It’s past midnight now and Draco is clean and dry and fast asleep in bed. I’m next to him with Leo sleeping in my arms. Katie checked Draco over again before she left and said she would be back in the morning.
What about my issues?
“Hello?”
Harry Potter
The tea comes to an end and I’m thinking of asking Ron for a chat when Draco speaks up.
“Your speech was great, Pans.”
“Nothing specific at the moment.” I whisper.
“Hey mate, don’t forget, leaky cauldron 7pm Saturday. You promised both you and Draco would be there.” Ron shouted after me, hanging out the door.
“If we order today it will be here by next Saturday.” He says and takes another look at it.
We floo to our house after we get changed and the front door is still locked which means she didn’t use the spare key to get in.
“I do. Everything I did during the war. It’s coming back for me.” He sobs some more and I brush the tears away gently with my thumb.
“Except when you blush, of course. Which is often.” He clarifies. “I just wish I knew what you were blushing about.” He places a piece of muffin in his mouth and starts chewing very slowly, not taking his eyes off me. And right on time, I blush. Shit.
I blush, crimson.
“Ugh, fucks sake Draco!” Blaise jumps back in disgust. Potter is next to me then and pushes the hair out of my face. He gently leads me over to a raised flower bed, and I note that it's in relative darkness. Thank fuck.
“Merlin, remember the first time you had a panic attack in front of me. That was horrible. I didn’t know what to do.”  He looked worried again so i squoze his hand and chuckled.
“It’s like having a child.” He whispers back and we both laugh.
I hug myself.
“He seems très cool about it, Draco. Don't sweat it. Look at him now - Harry cannot take his eyes off you.” I glance up, and both Sev and Harry are looking at me. “He’s been watching you like a hawk.”
I flush and shift, trying to pull away from him. His hand clamps down on my thigh, stilling me. I reach for my wine in desperation.
“Why, thank you, Mr Malfoy.” He says politely. I think he is pleased, but I’m not entirely sure.
I smile at and reach for the body wash, squirting some soap onto my hand. I do as he’s done, lathering the soap in my hands until they are foamy. I do not take my eyes off his. My lips are parted to accommodate my breathing…..very deliberately I gently bite my bottom lip and then run my tongue across it, tracing where my teeth have been. His eyes are serious and dark, and they widen as my tongue skims my lower lips. I reach forward and place one of my hands around his cock, mirroring his actions with mine. His eyes close briefly. Wow.
“About this house. She said we would spend time together and have fun. I don’t know about you but I’ve had fun.” I looked to my right at his face and smiled at him.
“Edward...close your eyes.” Draco says this time and goes around the back of him to gently place his hand over Teddy’s eyes. Teddy is so excited he looks like he has been shocked by electricity. He lifts his hands out higher and has a big grin on his face. I place the broom in his hands and close his fingers around it. He gasps and Draco removes his hand just in time to see Teddy’s eyes shoot open.
“Fifteen.”
“What’s her name again?” I ask, rubbing her back.
“Thank you,” he says, and before she can reply, he takes my elbow and steers me into an empty office. He checks to see if it’s empty, and then spells the door locked.
“-The end. Did you like that one?” I ask him and he nods sleepily. “You know which one is our room if you need us, right?” Again he nods and closes his eyes slowly. “Goodnight cub.” I kiss his head and turn the lights out.
“That’s a great idea Teddy.” Hermione says and reaches into her bag for some duck food. “Here you go, only a little at a time remember.”
“Well, I have a few questions, you know, about sex.” I stare down at my feet. “And I’d like to ask Pansy.”
I open my eyes and roll onto my side to look at him. He looks so peaceful and so damn beautiful. He’s on his back with one hand above him under the pillow and the other one resting on his belly. I stare at his stomach for a minute, trying to imagine it in a few months when it’s huge. I’m a little nervous, if I’m honest, about this whole baby thing. But it's happened and I’m sticking with him no matter what. I want to put my hand next to his on his belly but I don’t know if Draco would be okay with it, so I leave it for now and return to look at his face. Only this time, his eyes are open. A blush a bit from being caught staring and give him a long loving kiss.
No more emails unless you have questions.
I shake my head and strip my remaining clothes. I get in the shower and let the water cascade over me. I welcome it and for a moment I forget everything that happened last night, and I forget about Harry Potter. Then I remember him. All of him. And I want him, really bad. I want Harry Potter. I want to go to bed with a man for the first time in my life. I want his hand on me and mine on his. I want to taste his lips and have them taste my whole body. My dick is hard again and this time I grab it. I start to stroke softly at first and keep thinking of him.
“So, you want to possess things?” Definitely a control freak.
“Yeah mate, I’m sure it's going to be fine.” Ron says and hugs me over Hermione.
“Yeah and remember no magic in front of the muggles.” Draco says from the doorway.
“As you wish, Mr Malfoy,” he says, his face impassive. “I’ll escort you to the lobby.” He holds out his hand.
“I said yes, it's happened a few times.” Seeing my face is starting to panic he’s quick to assure me. “Just over the last few weeks and it seems to be getting better, so no need to worry.”
“What?” I ask her only half listening as most of my attention was on my godson who was currently giggling and telling me ‘higher’.
At 2 o’clock we floo to the burrow. Draco hasn’t worn his ring around anyone yet or told anyone. His mother and Ron and Hermione and Nia know but that’s it. Until now. He has put it on and said he’s ready to tell people but only if they notice.
Holy shit, what is this about? What does he want?  I walk through the doors with Potter and his...security?...following.
“So is she living with you now?” Teddy asks.
Draco Malfoy
“Yes.”
“Yeah, he’ll be okay.” We all go off to get things done then.
“Where are we going?” I ask again.
I gasp, automatically unlocking my lip, shocked.
Draco Malfoy
“Would you like me to show you around?” He asks.
“Okay, great, see you then.” I am flustered and breathy.
“It is.” He closes his eyes briefly. When he opens them, they are wide and grave. “Draco, you have to go with your gut. Do the research, read the contract - I’m happy to discuss any aspect. I’ll be in Scotland until Friday if you want to make this work. In fact, I’ve never wanted anything as much as I want this to work.”
I look down. Her precious words and smiling face give me a warm glow inside.
“Papa!” They all shout.
To the right is the hammock and to the left and back a bit is a huge oak. Nia walks over and leans on it.
Harry Potter
“I know, Draco. I just thought if I kissed you, it might change how you feel.”
“Master Harry sir.” He bows at me and then carries on. “Master Harry is meant to be seeing Master Draco sir. Master Harry told Kreacher he was leavings at 6 and Kreacher sees it’s nearly time, yet Master Harry is not ready.” I finally click on to what he's saying and look at my watch. He’s right! It's 5:45 and I’ve not had a shower or anything. Shit!
Humour has returned to his voice.
“Congrats darling! I’m so happy for you.” She says in his ear.
“Wow, I bet Draco’s exhausted.” Ron says.
Sweet Merlin. That was extraordinary. He gazes down at me, a satisfied smile on his face, while I’m sure there’s nothing but gratitude and awe on mine.
“I’m going to have a shower. Unless you want one first?” He asks with his head to the side, still grinning. My heartbeat pulses and my cheeks flush. He grins even wider at this and strokes his long fingers across my cheek and over my bottom lips. I stop breathing.
“Maybe you’re just lucky.” I say loud enough for him to hear me. This wasn’t on the parchment Pansy had given me but the guy was being arrogant and an arse. I look up to see a brief flare of surprise in his eyes.
Why didn’t you tell me there was danger? Why didn’t you warn me?
Holy shit. I just wanted to call Pans, I want to call after him, but his sudden aloofness has left me paralysed. What happened to the generous, relaxed, smiling man who was making love to me not half an hour ago?
“Draco, you should always read anything you sign.” He admonishes me.
“I’m free right now to come look at it. It will only take 5 minutes and then I can get some plants ordered.”
“Oh my. Harry I’m sorry dear. I didn’t mean to offend.” Molly looks awfully guilty now which makes me feel bad.
I go back to my bedroom and switch on the laptop. There’s an email from Harry from late last night or very early this morning, depending on your point of view. My heart rate spikes instantly, and I hear the blood pumping in my ears. Holy fuck….maybe he’s said no - that’s it - maybe he’s cancelling dinner. The thought is so painful. I dismiss it quickly and open the email.
His expression is warm and appreciative. The red-haired woman beside him turns and beams at me, a full megawatt smile. She stands, too. She’s impeccably dressed in a camel-coloured fine knit sweater dress with matching shoes. She looks groomed, elegant, beautiful, and inside I die a little, knowing I look such a mess.
I head into the bathroom and really want to brush my teeth but there is only Harry’s toothbrush there. I could just use a spell, or….I could have part of him be in my mouth. I grab the toothbrush and feel that the bristles are still wet. He must have used it lately. I spread the toothpaste on and brush my teeth. I feel naughty and very slytherin.
“Yes.”
“He did not say that.” Then he sits down next to us on the bench I installed.
“Thank you, sir. I understand that you’re a very keen potioneer.”
“Right let's get pissed!” Shouts George then and we cheer and hold our drinks up.
By the time my shift finishes it is 1 o’clock in the morning. Pansy was right, I am exhausted, but working meant that my mind was kept off Harry Potter.
I apparate to the gates of the manor and they open to welcome me in. So far so good. I walk up the drive and to the front door, but then I start freaking out a bit and breathing hard. ‘I’m okay, this is for Draco. I love him.’ I keep repeating this to myself and it gives me a bit of confidence to knock on the door. A house elf answers the door and tells me to come in and wait when i tell him I’m here to see draco. The little elf directs me to a sitting area and I take a seat on the couch. I’m a little uneasy and I’m tugging at the sleeves of my jumper when I hear running. Draco skids around the corner with wide eyes.
Fucking hell! I nearly spit my drink all over him and choke a little. That is very personal...and he didn’t answer me when I asked.
“I need knickers, at least 4 pairs. Over there in the top drawer.” She points to her chest of drawers. I go over and grab a hand full, probably 5 or more. I shove them in the bag.
“Yes you are. And I’ve got lots of friends and family to go to when I’m sad. Just like you.” He smiles and we sit there rocking for a little longer.
“So when are you seeing him again?” she asks.
“You’re acting like a pregnant woman.” Nia says then and laughs. Except me and Draco don’t laugh and instead stare at each other. Nia stops laughing and looks at us. “What….” she looks at me and then at Draco. Her eyes wonder down to his stomach and she gasps. “No! Can wizards get pregnant?! Oh my god.” She looks about to cry then, so I start to go over to her to calm her down. Then she launches herself at Draco. I freeze and don’t act quick enough. By the time I have my wand out, anything could have happened. I look over and...well she’s hugging him. That’s all. I really need to calm down around Draco, I’m going to kill someone. I quickly put my wand away before Nia see’s it and freaks out.
“That seems reasonable, I'll owl you.” He turned to get some floo powder but I didn’t want him to go just yet, so I grabbed his hand.
“Oh…..did she know you were...bi?”
“This soup tastes lovely babe, you’ll have to ask the house elf’s to give me the recipe.” For starters we have homemade soup, and it’s one of the nicest soups I’ve had in a long time. Not to tell Molly that of course.
“Yeah I guess I did.”
“You’re moving this weekend to London. If you make the right decision, can I see you on Sunday?” He sounds hesitant.
“Why are you wearing your shirt?” I ask. He stills. After a beat, he shuffles out of his shirt, and he lies back down on me. I feel his warm skin against mine. Hmmm… it feels heavenly. He has a light dusting of hair across his chest, which tickles my back.
He stares at me, his gaze intense. The seconds tick by.
No! Stop this! Get up, go to your room, and get studying. Forget about him!
“Good, thanks. You?”
I take a small bunch of grapes. That I’m sure I can manage. He narrows his eyes at me.
Tonight
Had some spare time, so here’s another chapter. I’m sorry it’s so similar to the 50 shades book, I’m trying to put my own spin on it but it just isn’t working so far. Hope you enjoy anyway! X
“Draco, you tell me what it is right now or I will go inside and close this door on you. Forever!” I clarify so he knows I’m being serious.
“Is it the money?”
The next day.
“Shhh, yes but it’s fine. Go back to bed. We may be here a while.”  She nods and heads back upstairs. I go back into the room with the sheets. Draco is sat on the end of bed leaning backwards with his hands flat on the bed.
“Right, you get washed and I’m going to make you a sandwich. I’ll be back in 10 minutes to help you out, okay?” She says gently. I nod at her and she leaves. I place my head against the back of the bath and just lie there for a minute. Then I start washing myself because I know that if I am not washed by the time she comes back up, then she will wash me herself and I don’t want that.
I frown at him and sit back a bit. What the fuck is his problem. What has it got to do with him anyway? I'm not his, and that's his fault.
He places my tea in front of me and puts down his coffee and a blueberry muffin. He is so well put together. Whereas I’m so uncoordinated. He can get from one place to the next without falling flat on his face. I envy him. He looks so comfortable and at ease with his body.
“Thank you Narcissa.” I hug her close and then get up. I really need to get to Draco now.
“My brother can tell her.”
Patiently, I explain the essence of my email without giving anything away.
“Just because we know he isn’t very well behaved for you Harry. And we didn’t really want to put the responsibility on you either. We knew you and Draco had your anniversary coming up, and didn’t want to stress you out.” She looks at me with big eyes, and I could tell she wasn’t lying. They really did this in my best interest. I give her a quick hug then.
Theo now has her in a dramatic hold, sweeping her off her feet and into a low dip, so that her hair is touching the floor. He is continuing to kiss her hard.
“It’s okay Harry, and I really am thrilled for you two. Congratulations.” We stay still for a minute just hugging while she cries on my shoulder. Then she pulls away and wipes her eyes and smiles at me. “Wow your going to be a father Harry!” She says and squeezes my cheeks. “You’ve been so good with our Teddy, I know you will do just as well with your own.” She pulls away and we go back into the sitting room.
“Good luck with the interviews. Let me know how they go.”
“Thanks! You're the best.”
“Draco, I’m in the moment, trust me.”
We walk for a bit longer and see a few students along the way. Suddenly, Potter takes my hand. I gasp as I feel the current run between our hands, and then blush.
He glances up and grins.
Me, Draco and Hermione all freeze with wide eyes. Molly looks from Luna to Draco to me, then lets go of Draco’s hand. Ginny's eyes go wide and she nudges Luna, who had obviously told her already. Then I look to Ron. He’s looking at me and then Hermione and back again. She looks guilty and I think he knows she knows. He stands up and leaves through the floo.
*call me*
“Thank you Harry.” She says and then the baby is placed on her chest.
“My brother Theo is talking to Miss Parkinson.”
He gazes at me for a moment, and he relaxes.
“Charlie Tango, come in please, over.” Weasley interrupts my reverie. Harry answers him, telling him we are almost there. I look down at London and it looks absolutely stunning from up here at night.

“Would you like some more wine?”
I inhale sharply. I look back up at Harry and a shadow of a smile crosses his lips, but it’s fleeting. He briefly closes his eyes and, on opening them, resumes his indifferent expression. Following a swift glance up at McGonagall, he stares ahead, focusing on the main doors. He doesn't turn his eyes towards me again. McGonagall drones on, and Harry still doesn't look at me. He just stares fixedly ahead.
As we were leaving, I put some quick wards up to repel anyone from coming near, not that anyone would want to get near this place but better safe than sorry. I grab Draco’s hand and prepare to apparate but he stops me by saying something.
“That’s our baby.” I say back.
I can’t even pretend to put up an argument against that. Of course I would, if he asked me - as long as he didn't hurt me and if it’s the only way to be with him.
Nervously, I open it.
“No, unless you want me to go.” I murmur. Oh no…. I don't want to leave.
“Ron. you cannot keep me from my son.”
“Okay.” I blink up at Sev, trying to find my equilibrium.
“Who wants food?” I say coming into the room, pretending I didn’t hear anything.
“Are you thirsty, Draco?” he asks, his voice teasing.
“Yes.”
15.1   The Dominant shall make the Submissive’s health and safety a priority at all times. The Dominant shall not at any time require, request, allow, or demand the Submissive to participate at the hands of the Dominant in the activities detailed in Appendix 2 or in any act that either party deems to be unsafe. The Dominant will not undertake or permit to be undertaken any action which could cause serious injury or any risk to the Submissive’s life. The remaining subclauses of this clause 15 are to be read subject to this proviso and to the fundamental matters agreed in clauses 2-5 above.
10 minutes later we apparate to the park.
“Mr Potter, there’s an issue with the Darfur shipment.”
I turn around and Harry is staring at me intently, as I knew he would be, his expression completely unreadable. I turn back around and walk further into the room. The feathery thing has me intrigued and so I walk over to it and touch it hesitantly. It’s suede and there are small plastic beads on the end.
I nod. The power of speech remains elusive.
He smirks. “Ditto, baby,” he says as Weasley drives us into the night towards Godric’s hollow.
“No.  But I do understand them.” She smiles and we stop laughing.
“Wow you're getting so big now.”
“Did he now?” Harry murmurs, gazing at me, his expression unreadable.
He passes me a cup of hot water with the tea bag on the side. He remembers. I like to watch the water turn colour and know exactly which colour I like it. I instantly put the tea bag in and start to watch the colour drain from the bag.
“He’s with Molly tonight, I’m afraid we won't be staying late though. Need to get back to my baby.” Angelia declared proudly. We carried on chatting for a bit and then Hermione comes out of the bathroom looking slightly green. This could also indicate she’s pregnant or it could mean they are both sick.
I stiffen. I’m sure they’re not talking about professor Binns.
“Yeah I’m fine.” He says and then after a minute starts speaking. “Merlin Harry, a whole year. Me and you, who would have guessed?” I look down at him while he’s sorting my injuries once again. I've come back from work multiple times and had to have Draco’s help with injuries. I look at him with love and think back to when that look used to be hate.
“In here.” I hear Ron call out from the kitchen. Good he’s home.
“Do you have everything you need?”
“Subject to the soft limits, yes. I’ll try.” My voice is so small. Harry closes his eyes and pulls me into an embrace.
May 26 19:27
“Where were we, Mr Malfoy?”
“But that will take months, what about your job?” He turns to look at me.
“Merlin, that’s a while away. You will come back for my show won’t you?”
I land near the main door of Hogwarts and make my way to mine and Pansy’s rooms. There are no lights shining out from under the door, so I suspect Pansy isn’t in. I'm relieved. I don't want her to catch me crying again. As I undress, I wake up the laptop and sitting in my inbox is a message from Harry.
“Fine, is it me?” God, I hope it’s not me.
“oh, please.” I beg. I’m not sure I can take much more. My body is wound so tight, craving release.
“Does Harry have to be here?” Draco asks then, looking away from me and crossing his arms. I stare at him in hurt with pleading eyes but he refuses to look at me. I guess I deserve this.
His cool fingered trail languidly across my belly. My skin is oversensitive, my hips flex automatically, and the now-warmer liquid from my navel seeps over my belly. Harry moves quickly, lapping it up with his tongue, kissing, biting me softly, sucking.
I’m grateful for her question, distracting me from my discordant thoughts, and I tell her about our move.
“Congrats guys! I’m so happy for you.” I say over the loudness of the table. She places her hand over mine and smiles with tears in her eyes.
Oh, shit. Don't get your underwear in such a twist….
Draco Malfoy
My heart is pounding. I can feel that pull, that delicious electricity between us charging, filling the space with static, the magic. He’s sitting so close to me, his eyes dark green, his elbows resting on his knees, his legs apart. Leaning forward, he slowly undoes my bun, his fingers freeing my hair. My breathing is shallow, and I cannot move. I watch hypnotised as his hand above my head, running his long, skilled fingers through my hair.
When we get back to grimmauld, we do exactly what I said. We have a sandwich and a fruit salad and sit and watch tv. After 20 minutes Draco is fast asleep, curled up on me. So I decide to take a nap with him. He’ll be fine tomorrow, I’ll make sure of it.
I am daunted by his kitchen. It’s so big, with lots of muggle appliances. It takes me a few seconds to figure out what I need, and what not to touch. Perhaps I should cook Harry breakfast. He was eating an omelette the other day….um, yesterday at the hotel in scotland. Jeez, so much has happened since then. I check the fridge, where there are plenty of eggs, and decide I want pancakes and bacon. I set about making some batter, dancing my way around the kitchen.
We had finally finished Nia’s loft last week. We had painted the slanted roof navy blue with yellow stars and a moon. Draco had put a charm on it so that the stars twinkle and every so often a shooting star appears. Then with the moon he had done it so it changes from full to crescent as it does in the sky. The rest of the walls were a golden yellow and had emerald leaves dotted about which Draco charmed to sway like in a breeze.
I’d like to reward another A.
I’m refreshed but suddenly nervous. Holy shit, I am meeting his parents! He’s just worked me over with a riding crop and tied me up using a cable tie, for fucks sake - and I’m going to meet his parents. It will be Pansy’s first time meeting them, too - at least she’ll be there for support. I roll my shoulders. They’re stiff. His demands for a personal trainer don't seem so outlandish now. In fact, it’s mandatory if I am to have any hope of keeping up with him.
“Absolutely.” Teddy says happily. “Does that mean me and grandma won the guessing game? Because we did guess James.”I laugh and ruffle his hair.
I cast a tempus to check the time and sigh.
“I need to be home this evening.”
“You’ll call me if you want to do the photo shoot?” Once again he’s all business. I nod and hand him his change back and he puts it all in my tip jar.
“Did you choose these deliberately? Aren’t they known for their aphrodisiac qualities?”
They shake hands. Harry holds his hand out to me.
“I will be back in 10 minutes. If you need me call the buzzer.” The healer says and then leaves.
“Shall I press the buzzer?” I ask her and grab it.
“Asking him to drop by?”
As McGonagall gets to her feet and kicks off the proceeding with her speech, I watch Harry subtly scanning the hall. I sink into my seat, hunching my shoulders, trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible. I fail miserably as a second later his eyes find mine. He stares at me, his face impassive, completely inscrutable. I squirm uncomfortably, hypnotised by his glare as a slow flush spreads across my face. Unbidden, I recall my dream from this morning, and my cock starts to harden.
2: Not sure why this is solely for MY benefit - i.e., to explore MY sensuality and limits. I’m sure I wouldn’t need a ten-page contract to do that! Surely this is for YOUR benefit.
Ugh. he has to write these down! Of course - they all look very sensible and, frankly, necessary …. Any sane person wouldn’t want to be involved in this sort of thing, surely. Though I now feel a little queasy.
“Hello. How have you been my baby? Has Harry been looking after you?” She says to the cat in a baby voice. The second question was clearly aimed at me though.
I look at the wall of photos behind the sofa, which started with the photo of Teddy kissing baby Leo’s head. There are so many more photos now. All the kids are up there and the rest of the family. There is Teddy pushing Lily on the swing outside. There’s one of Orion trying to reach an apple off one of the trees in the orchard while Leo holds him up. There is a picture of Ophelia feeding one of the horses a carrot. And one of Phoenix riding his horse. He always goes so fast. There’s a picture of the twins in the tree house, out back, shouting down something and laughing. Then there is the picture that started this wall, of Teddy holding baby Leo for the first time. I love this wall and this family.
“Yes please!” I laugh and kiss his head.
“I’ll have another.” I say dryly.
5 hours later. It has only been 5 fucking hours and this cat has destroyed my living room. He has put at least one hole in every pillow, he has brought the curtains down trying to climb up them, he attacked the fireplace and got soot everywhere, he’s smashed at least 3 things, and he is currently trying to dig through the sofa. Ive text Draco multiple times for help but he must be busy at work. I just can’t get crookshanks to stop, he won’t listen to me. I am definitely not letting him out of this room though. I've set up his litter tray and tried reading the pages Hermione gave me but he pounced on them like they were prey and ate them!
“I did catch on to that. It was cute. Maybe this whole baby thing has made him realise you are sticking around.” I lift his chin and give him a kiss. He smiles at me and we head towards Teddy and Andy.
“She gave a great speech.”
Oh fuck. Harry rakes his hand through his unruly hair and gazes at me.
“Are you hungry?” he asks, distracting me from my thoughts.
When we have showered and dressed, we finally sit down for our tea.
He’s sitting on his couch reading when I floo in.
“Draco! You’re back!” Pansy shouts from her spot on the floor. She is surrounded by books and has her laptop open in front of her. She’s trying to teach me how to use one but the phone was hard enough and I’ve not cracked it yet.
“Milllkk please uncle Harry.” He says and goes back to talking with Draco.
“Why not? What’s wrong with my company?”
“Is he here?” I hear a screech from within the house. I glance nervously at Harry.
“I’m profoundly grateful and touched by the great compliment accorded to me by the professors of Hogwarts today. It offers me a rare opportunity to talk about the impressive work of the environmental science department here at Hogwarts university. Our aim is to develop viable and ecologically sustainable methods of farming for third world countries, magical communities and muggle; our ultimate goal is to help eradicate hunger and poverty across the globe. Over a billion people, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, live in abject poverty. Agricultural dysfunction is rife within these parts of the world, and the result is ecological and social destruction. I have known what it's like to be profoundly hungry. This is a very personal journey for me….”
“Oh please uncle Harry, pleassseee…”
Thank you.
“Harry, are you sure about this?”
“No.” My voice is small.
And as we get sat down Louis starts angry babbling. He wants victoire to sit next to him and can’t see her past fleur. But fleur tells him no so he throws his head back and balls his hands into fists. Most everyone’s ignoring this and talking to whoever is next to them. But I like to watch this big, lovable, angry family. My family. I look to Draco then, who is talking quietly to Hermione, probably about what happened in the bathroom.
“Loads of fun!” He declares happily.
“Oh merlin, I’m sorry if I’m interrupting.” I say slightly embarrassed. “I should have called first.”
“Yeah.” He says.
“Draco, I’m quite worried about your ops. I think I’m going to have to suggest you go on bed rest now, until baby comes.” She gets up and puts her wand away. “Your blood pressure is very low and probably why you fainted. Just keep your feet up and stay in bed.” He looks sulkily at her and she laughs. “Hey, you have it easy compared to some people. This one woman I know had to be put on bed rest at 4 months. She had to stay in bed for 5 months, I’m sure you can do 2 weeks.” She smirks and winks at him. He nods and smirks back.
“Look, Blaise, now's not a good time.” I glance anxiously over to the door, where I expect Harry to show up any second. I turn back around.
“WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!” Then something smashed above my head and I ducked. “I’ve looked everywhere for you! You said you’d been at the house, so i went there and you weren’t fucking there! I’ve been worrying all day! I even called Hermione but she hadn’t heard off you.” Draco was still shouting but seemed to have calmed down a tiny bit knowing I was okay.
“No he won’t, he’s fine here.” She says coolly to the healer. “Don’t you dare leave me!” She hisses at me then and holds my hand for dear life.
“It’s okay. So, are you still okay for tomorrow's lesson? Mcgonagall sent some plants so we can start herbology.”
“Merlin Harry please.” He begs breathlessly.
“Hold on.” I whisper and apparate us to the bedroom. I push him down on his back on my bed and crawl between his legs. All the while trying to kiss him and touch him as much as possible to keep him in the moment. I want this to be good for him. I pull my top and trousers off quickly leaving my underpants on. Next I go to grab his top and pull it over his head but he thinks I’m leaning in for a kiss so he leans forward too. I don’t mind giving him that of course. I’m nearly losing it by the time we break apart so i pull his shirt off and undo his trouser buttons slowly while kissing each one. He tries to thrust up but I hold his hips down.
“No that’s okay sir, I’m just here to speak to professor McGonagall.”
“Be careful Teddy, no snatching.” She says and lets him see while she’s holding it. “Wow, look at it. How far along are you Draco?” She asks while Teddy is staring in amazement at the moving image of his baby cousin.
“Harry that’s awesome!” Hermione had taken on some of Ron's laid back language since they had been spending so much time together and I just loved it and it made me laugh to myself. She pulled back and looked at me.
Harry frowns as he gazes at me.
“Boys please. Can we just have a nice dinner together.”
I gasp, and I’m Eve in the Garden of Eden, and he’s the serpent, and I cannot resist.
“What sort of basic training did you have in mind?” I ask, my voice slightly too high, betraying my wish to sound as natural , disinterested, and calm as I can with my hormones wreaking havoc through my body.
Placing my hand in his, I slide out and stand up beside him. He releases me, and his hand reaches for my elbow. He leads me back through the bar and up the grand stairs to a mezzanine floor. A young man in full uniform approaches us.
“I kind of feel lighter if I’m honest. Like I was being weighed down by this secret and now it’s out and everything is fine. I don’t know why I was so stressed about it.”
Chapter 1
“Right, I’m going to put this one to bed. Is that alright with you Andy?” I ask her before moving from behind Draco.
“That’s okay. We can try new things. Have you ever thought about what you would want?” I lower my voice and get close to his ear. “Have you ever thought about how you want me?” He moans again and leans his head back.
“You’re tears say differently!” Hermione tells Draco stubbornly. I get up and rush to the living room. When i see him, he has clearly been crying, i pause. He looks just as bad as me truth be told, but always so beautiful.
We land on the edge of Hogwarts and the breeze catches us straight away. The beginnings of summer in the wind. I turn to say something to Harry but stop and stare instead. He is looking at Hogwarts with all the wonder of a child. For a fleeting moment he seems his age: young, carefree, and heart-stoppingly beautiful. He turns to me and grins. Is this the key to him? Hogwarts?
“Mr Potter?” I turned around and looked down to see professor flitwick.
“Thank you aunt andromeda, that means a lot.”
I don’t see anyone or leave the house for the next week. I don’t get much sleep and I hardly eat. I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling. I haven’t showered all week because what’s the point. What’s the point of anything anymore? I should have died when Voldemort threw the killing curse at me.
“What?!” He tries to play dumb.
“No.” And I can’t help the small tinge of pride in my denial.
“Hmm maybe I have.” We walked the rest of the way mostly in comfortable silence still holding onto each other.
This chapter carries on from chapter 1, back in the present. X
“Of course, now move.” She pushes me aside and goes through. She must really be in pain to shove me.
“Sorry Narcissa, Draco locked me out again.”
“Sorry Lottie, hope it’s okay?” I tell her as she lets us past.
“Draco, trust me, I can afford it.”
“What no fireworks tonight George?” Draco asks sarcastically, and people laugh.
“I just really wanted you all to myself.” He says in a seductive voice. I get my other shoe off and turn myself around.
“Hello Mr Malfoy, Mr potter. What seems to be the issue today?” She says to us, very professionally. It seems to work though because Draco has relaxed a bit. Although he doesn’t seem to be able to speak.
Draco Malfoy
When he comes back Teddy is holding Leo and smiling down at him.
“Hello, Draco. Congratulations.” He nods at me.
“Yes,” I snap, exasperated. “Okay, she’s old. But she’s mine, and she’s flyable. My Godfather bought her for me.”
“You like this?” he asks softly, his teeth grazing my outer ear, and he starts to flex his fingers in and out, rubbing a circle on that spot each time.
“What the fuck was that?!” He said when he came back. “I was only joking about the stabbing.”
“Who says we are going to sleep?” he murmurs.
He smirks at me. Pompous arse. He picks up his phone and puts it to his ear.
“I do have something else to say, well to ask.” He stands up and gets down on one knee in front of Hermione. He pulls a ring box from his pocket and opens it for her to see. “Hermione Jean Granger, I love you so much and I will love this child just as much. I know how much friends and family mean to you so i wanted to do this with all our friends around and when you had this plan of telling everyone together i just knew i needed to do this at the same time. So ‘mione will you marry me?” She’s crying now and everyone is silent waiting for her answer
He stops dead and turns around.
“Nia we aren’t going to hurt you.” I tell her in a soft voice and put my hand on her shoulder, but she flinched so I moved it away.
After a few more minutes of chat, I finish my cup of tea and head to bed. I wrap myself up in my mothers quilt and instantly fall asleep. That night I dreamt of bright green eyes.
“Yeah, all we are missing is a hufflepuff.” Lily says and looks at Mr Potter, they grin at each other obviously remembering their Hogwarts days.
“Do you think she’ll like it?” Draco asks me over breakfast. He’s been a bit shy about this whole thing for the past week. I think he really likes Nia and appreciates her friendship. She is the first person Draco has made friends with that he didn’t know before the war.
I look up at the sound of the door shutting. Draco must have just left. Oh well, ‘Rome wasn’t built in a day’ and all that. Maybe one day we will talk nicely to each other, maybe even be friends. I laugh to myself thinking that maybe one day I will be ‘Harry’ to him and he’ll be ‘Draco’ to me. Yeah right, when dragons swim.
Hmmm…. I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls around the end. He’s my very own Harry Potter-flavoured popsicle. I suck harder and harder, pushing him deeper and deeper, swirling my tongue around and around. Hmmm…. I had no idea giving a blow job could be such a turn-on, watching him writhe subtly with carnal longing.
“Bed.” he orders. “You’ll be exhausted in the morning.”
“Deal.” He chuckles.
“I’m never going to leave you Harry, I promise.”
“I think my water broke…” he says, sounding tired. Then he gasps and leans forward while holding his back. “Contraction!” He groans out. I grab his hand and rub his back until it passes.
“Thanks Hermione, where have you been anyway?” She sits down and now we’re squished together, but just like with Draco, it’s comfortable. She puts her head on my shoulder and looks at the sleeping baby tucked in my arm.
“You also invest in farming technologies. Why are you interested in that area?”
“Oh my gosh guys!” She squeals and  looks about to cry. “Wow, this is amazing.” Then she goes over to Draco and puts her hands out as if she’s about to touch his belly, but he flinches back and she pauses. “Can I see?” She asks him timidly.
My head jerks up to glare at him, and his eyes burn forest green with compelling need.
“I thought I’d find you here- oh.” She stops when she sees Nia. “You must be Nia?”
Whoa...what?!
“I’ll find the way.” This isn’t going how I expected and he’s putting a downer on the night.
As I fly away, my chest constricts, my tears start to fall, and I choke back a sob. Soon tears are streaming down my face, and I really don't understand why I’m crying. I was holding my own. He explained everything. He was clear. He wants me, but the truth is I need more. I need him to want me like I want him, and deep down I know that’s not possible. I am just overwhelmed.
“Oh Harry, sorry. I was just looking around...and...and. Well this is quite a collection of rare books you have.” He strokes a few book spines along a shelf.
“Anyway, did you come here for a specific reason, Hermione or just to tell us off about wrongly accused sexism.” I shot her an annoyed look. She just turned and smiled at me and then said,
“Here you go, Mr Malfoy.”
My belly curls at the thought.
“Babe, I need you to calm down. Take a deep breath.  She’s fine. The healer has been in and she’s nearly ready to push. Ron isn’t here yet though. I was just about to ring him when you rung.” I can hear him calming down.
“3 night dresses. Second drawer down.”
“Then where are you going? And what time? And with who?” I ask him because I know he won’t be able to answer. He may be good at lying but not to me.
“Hey cub, how are you doing today?” I ask him while running my fingers through his hair, which is currently changing from light brown to black to match mine.
“Just keeping it real, Dray. The whole package - looks good. You’ll have him eating out of your hand.”
“Thank you for this weekend, Draco. It’s been….the best. Wednesday? I’ll pick you up from work, from wherever?” he says softly.
I purse my lips. Entertaining, huh? I turn and grab the eggs back, continuing to whisk, probably beating them a little harder than necessary. In a moment, he is beside me. He strokes my cheek.
“Hey.” he summons me. I peek up at him, and his head is cokced to one side. “Draco, you’re a very beautiful man, the whole package. Don't hang your head like you’re ashamed. You have nothing to be ashamed of, and it’s a real joy to stand here and gaze at you.” He takes my chin in his hand and tilts my head up to reach his eyes. They are soft and warm, heated even. He’s so close. I could just reach up and touch him.
“No. Blaise and I are good friends, that's all. Why do you think he’s my boyfriend?”
Harry unlocks the door, his mouth in a grim line.
“Then you should have told her when she obviously told you!” I say right back. Luna looks near tears too now and I can’t stand this much longer. I storm past them and up to the floo.
“Since I was little, although we didn’t become close until starting at Hogwarts. She’s a really good friend.”
“Are you okay?” Harry asks across the room.
“That is such a Gryffindor thing to say,” Goyle scoffed.
“Sorry,” Scorpius half-assed the apology, “Family stuff.”
“Hey boys,” Harry says with a smile, “Are you ready for your ‘detention’?” He uses air quotes around the word, and it confuses Albus and Scorpius.
Albus shoots a look of desperation to Scorpius, hoping he will save him, but he looks just as scared as Albus feels, “I don’t know how, I never asked. No, she isn’t dead. I just don’t have a mother. There are your answers.”
That is until one Gryffindor speaks up without raising her hand, “Professor Malfoy?” Draco stops talking as she pauses finding her words, “Is it true what was in the papers yesterday, are you really married to Mr. Potter?”
‘I hate you,’ Scorpius thought.
“Oh, right,” Scorpius says grabbing his bag, grabbing Albus’s arm, and rushing out of the classroom.
“Please,” Zabini begged, the whole circle now fascinated by this new information.
Without thinking, Albus says “truth.”
“I have never seen a snitch go that fast,” the announcer calls, the little gold ball circling around the teachers stand.
Harry came into the classroom when Detention only had 10 minutes left, “Hey guys.”
“Can’t I just come to see my three favourite people without a reason?” Harry says his smile so wide.
‘I see it,’ Scorpius responds diving after the snitch.
“How was your first day back?” Zachary asks.
Harry smiled into the kiss and pulled away to say, “Can we go inside? The heating charms are wearing off, and I want to go to sleep.”
“Good Morning,” Harry says, “we need to get going soon, so why don’t you run along to the kitchen to find your breakfast.”
The Hall erupted into applause, before she continued, “Thanks to Professor Malfoy, Madame Pomfrey, and all of the other staff for cooperating with these measures to keep us all safe.”
“I have so many questions,” Vincent says, and a few murmurs of agreement came from the people surrounding them.
“Does not.”
Albus and Scorpius nod and McGonagall dismisses them to go back to their dormitory.
“Yeah, apparently his Patronus is the same as Mr. Potter,” Her friend replies.
Soon the two brothers are walking through crowds of wizards and muggles pushing their trolleys towards Platform 9¾, they arrive on the platform with 6 minutes to spare and find a compartment with Rose Weasley and her brother Hugo, both of the children of Ron and Hermione, Harry’s best friends.
“Oh, and the whole reason he wasn’t was because of a certain blonde-haired Slytherin,” Albus says, unphased by the shock from the others.
“True,” Vincent says, turning back to his eggs.
“Precisely Scorp,” Draco says, “Occlumency is being able to block people from entering your mind, it is kind of the opposite of Legilimency.”
The two boys across the table look bewildered and confused before Zach finds his words, “What aren't we ready it hear?”
“I guess I am,” Harry turns to Draco, “but only because it’s our sons, no other reason.”
A lesson in Occlumency quickly turned into a general lesson in protection charms, as Draco had become quite good at those when he was being scared shitless with the Death Eaters.
“Okay,” Albus agrees, pointing his wand at the now fallen Rubik's cube, and thinks hard about the spell ‘Wingardium Leviosa’ he repeats the spell over and over again, before the colourful cube hovers slightly before touching back down, “I did it.”
Albus and Scorpius fell silent and just listened.
“Hey, Al, I never asked if you were okay after that DADA lesson,” says Vincent to Albus.
Oh, how the turns have tabled.
“Well, Dad says that we should only have to worry about separating out for a few weeks,” Scorpius says and takes off the mask he had previously been wearing, “before we can be sure that Hogwarts is safe from it.”
“Dad, at some point you need to teach us how to that,” Albus says with a slight smile, gesturing to the now perfect classroom.
The game continues for 2 hours before anyone even catches sight of the snitch, and both Harry and Draco were getting kind of bored. Gryffindor is at 170 points and Slytherin close behind with 160. It is Albus who notices the small golden ball first.
“True,” Draco says, moving closer to Harry, “When I first cast it, it took the form of an albino peacock, like the ones that lived near the manor when I grew up,” Draco says, reminiscing before his face falls serious again, “then for a while I wasn’t able to cast one. But when I was able to make one again, it was different.”
Murmurs and nods of agreement came from the class, so Harry says, “Good.”
“Wait, so they have been together for over twenty years,” Vincent looks baffled, “how the hell did they manage to keep it secret?”
“Welcome back to Potions 4th years,” Draco says coolly, “I am sure you have just received the whole honesty, integrity, and hard work speech from your other professors, and I am here to remind you how much you need to respect that to be in this class. This class should not be difficult if you pay attention, follow instructions, and do the homework, but that doesn’t mean it will be easy.”
Harry and Draco disappearated and arrived at Hogwarts to receive a briefing on all new rules and protocols regarding the virus. While Scorpius and Albus were left to make their way to the platform before 11.
A tired-looking Harry opens the door with a smile, “Hi boys,” he steps aside to let Scorpius and Albus step into the room, “what brings you here at 11 at night?”
“I certainly doubt it,” Draco chuckles, “remember how we were in school, or even last year, not a month went by without one of them getting down to the Headmistress’ office.”
“I don’t have a mother,” Albus says, with a false sense of nonchalance.
“I don’t know,” Harry says truthfully, “once I decide to stop using it to catch students out after curfew.”
Roxanne speaks up, “I mean they are both smart enough to not do that unless they meant to.”
The boys stay silent the whole way there and walk up the stairs up to McGonagall’s office and Harry goes back to teaching his class.
“Yeah, once he climbed up a tree to get Dad’s attention,” Scorpius chuckles.
The Hall yet again was filled with clapping from everyone before McGonagall had dismissed everyone to enjoy their Saturday.
They feel the train take off beneath them, and like that, they are on their way to Hogwarts again.
The room of students echoed his words a few times before Harry told them to form a line to face the boggart. A blonde Hufflepuff girl was first, her boggart turned from a vicious looking wolf to a small harmless puppy running around licking the girls’ fingers. And soon each 4th year got the chance to face their fears. Second to last was a Ravenclaw boy whose boggart turned into a floating red envelope addressed from his mother, screaming at him about god knows what, and after the boy muttered the charm, it changed to an origami paper plane that flew directly into the side of Harry’s head, the class then laughed and the next student stepped up, Albus.
“I didn’t say anything, but they kept asking, and even at breakfast this morning they seemed like they wanted to ask again,” Albus explains.
Draco isn’t there when he gets there so he takes a seat on one of the comfy armchairs, just waiting. A few minutes later Draco emerges through the door and smiles when he sees Harry.
“Then after that, they decided they liked their little bubble and honestly I much preferred growing up out of the public eye,” Scorpius adds, and Albus nodded along, “So the only ones that knew were their closest friends and family, like Ron and Hermione were the first to know, and the Weasleys are like our family so they know.”
“Potter!” Harry recognizes that voice, but why was he walking in on the DADA class? The students must have wondered the same thing and they turned to look at Professor Malfoy.
They both get under the cloak and move up the stairs to the wall and exit the common room. Walking down the hall towards their father’s potions classroom, they knew about the passage to their dads’ room through both Harry and Draco’s offices. Walking through the vacant classroom Albus pulls off the cloak and Scorpius opens the door to the office.
“Go lick the window.”
Clearly, this is something that every other student wanted to ask, as they were all looking at him expectantly.
The Great Hall erupts into applause and is soon taken over by the chatter of friends catching up and people eating.
Albus reaches out for a hug, so Harry crouches down to give him one.
“Oh, kind of like how Al and I can like have conversations in our minds,” Scorpius notices, “Like we can only read the thoughts that were meant for the other.”
“I thought we weren’t hiding anymore,” Harry says in just as soft of a tone.
“Oh, right,” Scorpius says, pulling his own mask out of one of the pockets of his coat before slipping it on.
The brothers realized more faces were now listening in on the story, Albus continues, “Well when they got together it was so soon after the war so they decided that for their own privacy and to keep it out of the papers,” He gestures down at the newspaper now abandoned on the table.
“Of course,” Draco says with a fond smile.
“That was the point,” Albus says.
“So, what do you say we uh,” Harry trails off and pulls the hem of Draco’s shirt slightly up, pulling him into a passionate kiss.
“How did you know?” Draco asked, knowing full well that if McGonagall had made this kind of bet, she would have some real reason to back up her side.
‘Yeah?’
He walks to their dorm to find their dormmates asleep, so he goes to his nightstand and goes into the drawer, and grabs the silky cloak. He then returns to the common room and finds his brother pacing, waiting, “Let’s go.”
Such as Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, they weren't students, but teachers. They had both returned to the school over a decade ago, after deciding that being an Auror wasn’t the career for either of them, they had seen their fair share of dark wizards for a lifetime. Over the years since the war, they had been able to overcome their differences and form their relationship as it stands today, husbands. They kept the nature of their relationship away from the press, as they were very happy with their little bubble of secrecy. Obviously, their friends and families knew, well, Lucius didn’t know, he was rotting in the cells of Azkaban for life, but aside from that, no one knew.
