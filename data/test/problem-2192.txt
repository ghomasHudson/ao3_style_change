Laddley’s face was strained. “Mr Potter,” he hissed, “what are you doing here? I might have lost it a bit, but you must understand… you sure don’t want to swim close to a homosexual either, right?” He gave Harry a pleading look before addressing Tommy again, “You piss off, Hillborogh, and Mr Potter and I will pretend, this conversation never happened, as long as we don’t see your face near the pool anymore, right?”
Harry held his breath expecting Draco to explode again, but the guy just snorted. He seemed to take Ron’s remark much better than Harry’s.
Harry was startled. Those grey eyes had never looked so warm before. Still he was somehow confused about Draco’s reply. What had Cass to do with Ginny and Draco’s attachment?
Ron gawped. “You did? Don’t tell me it’s true what the rumour mill says, that you spent your nights together in the common room?”
And what if they caught Draco under cover of the Invisibility Cloak? That would be proof of Harry’s abetting. He was not concerned for his own reputation, but he dreaded to be cut off from the investigation. Would Ron and Hermione keep searching for proof of Draco’s innocence, if Harry was banned to do so? Should he try to open the door again in an hour? Or instead send a message to Draco? He didn’t dare using his Patronus, the silvery stag was far too easily spotted. What the fuck was he supposed to do?
What to make of that, Harry had no idea. Draco Malfoy, prick extraordinaire and first class ass, was obviously capable of tenderness and caring deeply for another human being. Which didn’t prevent Draco from stomping on Harry’s foot without an apology, climbing out of the coach a few minutes later. Harry sighed.
Ron stopped in his track. He looked at Harry for a second – and then Harry found himself in a bear-hug.
For the next few days Harry’s attention was torn between school and worry. The Headmistress still insisted on Harry’s presence during lessons but kept him informed of any progress in the investigations. Not that there was much progress. Taurus Malfoy was supposedly still on the run, Laddley still unconscious. McGonagall had once again asked Harry, Blaise and Tommy to take care of the swimming lessons, which was at least something Harry enjoyed. Focusing on the needs of younger students gave Harry some hours free of worries.
Draco gasped. “Seriously? You think I’ve got a problem with you being gay?” He stared at Harry. “That is… beyond absurd. I’m just not used to your gay fan-club! I’m ever so sorry, but I don’t enjoy the attention you draw to our group… or to our table as much as you do!”
Harry inhaled sharply but tried to brace himself. “Go on then. Torture me. I’m not going to tell you.” His heart beat frantically but he was determined. If he had to endure pain, so be it – he would not allow a total lunatic to have the power of the united Deathly Hollows and especially not the Elder Wand.
They entered an elegant and spacious room. The view out of four large windows was nearly as impressive as from the owlery. Several comfortable looking sofas and chairs were spread around the room with small tables at their side, each of them covered in staples of books. So this was where McGonagall spent her spare time! The room was big enough to entertain a party and Harry wondered, whether the Headmistress sometimes asked other members of staff to join her in the evenings? Had Dumbledore done that?
She beamed brightly. “Finally you are here! Come on over to our table, we sit right in the middle of the hall – isn’t that fantastic! All of the seventh- and eighth-years together!”
secret to keep or share, you know? And anyway – I don’t know where exactly he is, I just know that he’s safe and I’m awfully glad about that.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat when he saw Draco’s face among them… and yes, there were Lucius and Taurus Malfoy as well as Gregory Laddley. Some of the others looked slightly familiar too, Harry recognized at least two prominent Quidditch players and the owner from the Early Bird Café at Diagon Alley. Well, as the living breathing Sylvia Silver was long deceased, it was fairly unlikely she knew any of them.
“The Ministry lifted the ban on the hospital wing just for today, because Aberforth is transferred to my ward,” she looked quite pleased. “The Healers of St. Mungos agreed to let him go since he insisted on leaving London. Says, he won’t get well in the city.”
Draco blushed violently, but was spared an answer by Blaise Zabini, who fell into the seat to Draco’s left with a booming, “Good evening, folks – who would have thought I might end up sitting close to The-Boy-Who-Lived!” He grinned at Harry who rolled his eyes in reply.
It was Friday night and they had gathered once more in Harry’s room to compare notes and plan further proceedings. Harry had the distinct feeling, neither of his friends wanted to have him in their rooms. Probably to keep their sleeping arrangement secret, Harry suspected.
Finally the gravity of the situation seemed to sink in and the students fell silent but for some urgent whispers.
Compared to Harry’s own upbringing, the Malfoy family seemed to have been even worse. While Cass kept stroking Otto’s soft feathers, he contemplated her story and asked, “I’m really sorry for you… and for Draco of course. But… what I don’t get is– why did Lucius and Taurus hate each other in the first place? And if so, why did they still live under one roof?”
Harry stepped into the corridor. He carefully closed the carved door behind him, before he adressed his Patronus to Josh, urging him to tell Kingsley all about his latest findings as soon as possible.
Draco shook his head, “That bird nearly gave me a heart attack! And she calls him Pinkie? Seriously?”
“Don’t bother, Harry,” Hermione said. “I think we can guess what you want to know.” She passed a glance with Ron, who whispered, “Go on!”
Harry filled his plate. The food smelled delicious but he was not sure how much his stomach could take in the presence of Josh. His insides squirmed whenever he looked at the handsome guy. Josh’s eyes seemed like liquid chocolate, he had cheekbones to die for and Harry was afraid, if he kept his eyes on Josh’s full lips for too long, he would grab across the table and kiss him…
“It’s alright, you don’t have to say anything, ok? What I wanted to tell you… I want you to know, that I am totally convinced of Draco Malfoy’s innocence. Whatever the crime in question may be. Draco is serious about his probation, about respecting the law, I’m sure about that. He’s truly reformed and I think that his affection for you has been no small reason for his remorse.” Josh looked intently at Harry.
“Thank’s Kreacher, for seeing me. I think we’ll better talk outside… just follow me, please.” Harry looked at Hermione. “Shall we?”
She smiled at him. “I just couldn’t stand it any longer… a certain amount of pining might be fun, but eventually it gets unhealthy.”
“What a vicious circle!” Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “We have to do something! We need to find a way to prove Taurus Malfoy is the culprit! There must be a way to nail this bastard before he does even more harm!”
Ron exploded with laughter spraying soup from his mouth all over the table. “Thank’s for that image, Zabini,” Ron said mopping up the mess with his wand, “I assure you, Harry’s not on Malfoy’s payroll, he’ll just defend anybody under attack. He’d do it for a troll as well, I assume.”
Ron grinned. “You know what? I actually agree. How about I nominate Ginny to replace me and stay back with Harry instead? Okay? I’m really no good with delicate stuff.”
Harry nodded. Playing crazy mind-games was at least one way to draw their interaction out and increase the chance of somebody – anybody! – coming to his rescue.
Suddenly Harry remembered a D.A.D.A. lesson from a few weeks ago. Josh had taught them a spell for uncovering hidden threats before entering a place. But would he be able to apply it wordlessly? He pressed his lips close to the keyhole and mouthed the spell without a sound. A faint tickling and a distinct decrease of temperature in his wand was the result. That was good, right? In case of hidden dangers his wand was supposed to heat up instead – so Harry should be safe to enter.
Before Harry had a chance to ask her, what she was hinting at, Andromeda turned around and waved her wand to make pot, plates and spoons set themselves at the table while asking, “Why don’t you give the cup to Narcissa when you have tea with her at the Manor? You will have to bring her some gift anyway, if you want to prove your manners,” she added with a smirk.
Harry grinned. Hermione might be an insufferable swot sometimes, but she was also one of the most daring and adventurous witchards he knew.
The applause following her speech was immediate and roaring, all the seventh- and eighth-year students at Harry’s table got up and cheered on top volume. Harry was unsure whether McGonagall’s or Draco’s face was the one showing more pride and delight.
The frame started to glow and for a second the whole painting was obscured – until the sight was clear again. The scene on the painting had changed significantly.
“Sorry to interrupt,” he said, “I just wanted to let you know, that I’m leaving for St Mungo’s because Auror Shacklebolt and the Healers want to interview me. The Headmistress fire-called from the hospital and told me that I’m unbound from patient’s confidentiality concerning Professor Laddley.” He hesitated. “She asked me to talk to you all before I leave. Apparently she thinks, what I know might be relevant for whatever you are discussing presently?”
“In that case come to my room in the early hours. You’ll probably have to wait until everybody has retired after the ball… let’s say if we have not been able to get together until two in the morning, we’ll meet at my room instead. I’ll leave the door slightly ajar as an all-clear. Then we can talk about the whole matter and I promise, I’ll tell you everything I know, alright?”
Luckily enough Christie was anything but shy. She chatted away excitedly and therefore spared Harry any trouble of finding something to talk about. She even included Laddley in her conversation as she seemed to be rather fond of him.
Laddley paled suddenly. “But the freedom of mind is also a human right, I should think! You cannot seriously expect me to –”
Harry’s mind raced. Whatever that lunatic wanted from him, he needed to play for more time. Molly and Arthur were supposed to call on him later in the evening. They would go to his room, find the letter pinned to his door and search for him. He just needed to prolong this absurd conversation.
A third wave of pain crushed Harry to the bone. This time he did not need to fake passing out, he actually did, which gained him another wet-rag-hex.
Harry could not hold back any longer, he threw Otto up in the air and his arms around Cass. He held her close.
“And if your friendship is useful for our investigation – all the better,” Hermione said with finality, “I suggest, you keep asking Draco to suss out Laddley’s past. It doesn’t sound as if he wants to protect Laddley… I wonder what Laddley might have done, that didn’t stop the school governors from hiring him?”
Now he was awake before sunrise once again and lay in bed reminiscing about yesterday’s events… his suspicions about Ginny and Draco’s feelings for each other, the horrible story about the Malfoy family, Draco being a suspect in the Imagic affair and finally the Halloween Ball’s challenging motto – it certainly had been a crazy day.
Josh passed a glance with Laddley. “Well… just so you know. Mr Laddley has asked to talk to you, that’s the sole reason for his transfer to Hogwarts.”
“What’s going on?” he cried, “Ms Weasley, Ms Malfoy – I hope you have a good reason for bursting in here and interrupting the dance!”
“Sorry,” O’Malley added, “that’s about all I know, I’m afraid… I’m not even sure why they want to interview me at St. Mungo’s, but I’m afraid I have to leave right away, the Headauror was very outspoken about it.” He sighed and with a final nod he opened the door and left.
Up until now Hermione had spent less time at his house than the Weasley siblings. When she did, she was unsurprisingly the most efficient help, clearing out cupboards and closets with her usual vigour. But understandably enough her priority for this summer was to make up with her parents, who were extremely cross with their daughter for having been shipped off to Australia under a memory charm. Her family trouble was yet another reason for Harry’s nagging feeling of guilt.
“Wow, that was Josh Jordan – he really is hot!” Hermione sighed as soon as the door was closed. Turning towards Cass she asked, “He’s Draco’s probation officer, right? Probably making sure the transfer is safe?”
“Of course I’m concerned,” he replied feeding her some half-truths, “but I’m trying to keep a cool head… if I freak out –like Cass– they will ban us from the investigation altogether. We need to do some damage control here until Draco turns up again.”
“Ah, Mr Potter, Mr Hillborogh, I bid you a good evening,” the Imagic said very politely, “would you please be so kind as to name the present password?”
“Quiet everybody!” a booming voice demanded, unmistakably Kingsley Shacklebolt’s. “I am very sorry to interrupt but I have to make an urgent announcement concerning Mr Draco Malfoy. Mr Malfoy, you are asked to step forward immediately! The Auror Department has strong reasons to suspect you violated your probation regime. You are therefore ordered to turn yourself in for questioning.”
“Oh Merlin!” he chuckled, “Ginny – you can’t come in here dropping dirt like that – I’m sorry for whatever happened to you, but the pool has to stay clean!”
“That’s not so easy, Ron,” Hermione explained, “Clients’ confidentiality is legally protected. But surely the Auror Department – ”
“You know about that? Me wanting to be an Auror?” Harry was astounded. “I’m fully aware it’s a tough job and I’ll probably fail the aptitude test or the training, but I still want to try,” he added somewhat defensively.
Having Josh for a teacher was far less distressing than Harry had feared. Any awkwardness was gone after the first lesson, Harry’s fascination for D.A.D.A. got the better of him. Josh being an excellent teacher helped too. During each lecture he shared stories from his work as an Auror and he reserved plenty of time for practice as well. Soon enough everybody agreed on Josh being their best D.A.D.A. teacher since Lupin – well, everybody except Draco Malfoy, who seemed to somehow resent Josh. Cass blamed Josh being Draco’s probation officer for the dislike, which sounded reasonable enough.
“Then what? Are you threatening me?! Well, that’s rich coming from you, as you didn’t even retrieve your wand so far! And if you don’t join your mother in a flash to see those Ministry officials, who are going to drop by, you might be without a wand just a bit longer!” Harry shouted.
Hurrying back to his position close to the pool Harry tried to compose himself by focusing on his task at hand. Group two swimmers were doing well enough. One fourth-year boy stood out, he was far better than the others of Harry’s group. After a short consultation with Tommy, Harry called him to the railing and squatted down.
“Yeah, I’ve heard, Draco told me,” Cass looked worried, “but… you will not get Aunt Cissy into trouble for it, Harry? I think, she isn’t even aware that her hexed painting is illegal.”
Harry closed the door of his room, heart pounding. Luna’s insinuation, Draco might fancy someone, was extremely disturbing. But why not? As far as Harry knew, Draco was straight. The only person Draco had been dating at Hogwarts was Pansy Parkinson, at least for the time Harry was at school. Draco and Pansy had been an odd couple. She was fawning over him, while he seemed to tolerate or even to endure her affection rather than return it. Back then Harry had assumed, that was just Draco’s arrogant way of being with someone.
Floppy nodded. “It is the best part of cleaning bedrooms, Master Harry Potter Sir! To look at the pictures wizards and witches keep in their rooms. Especially pictures on their bedside lockers.” She paused for a moment. “Many many bedside tables with pictures of Master Harry Potter, and not just at the guest-house…”
“And it’s about time, that you have reason to laugh and be joyful again,” Hermione said. “We all deserve that, actually. That horrible war is over and we better get on with our lives which should include plenty of fun for a change.”
“Wow, Longbottom sure knows how to impress,” Blaise said, stepping closer again. “And who’s Daisy? I thought, you’re gay, Potter?”
“Exactly, me neither. So – as soon as Slughorn was transformed, I felt sick as hell and the tracker went baloney. When he changed back, I was okay again and so was the tracker.”
Hermione grinned, “Yes, that’s part of the description too! So… if the missing Imagics are indeed trapped, we can set them free as soon as we find the hexed painting. For a start we need to find out how many copies of this book exist and whether any suspect had access to them.”
“Exactly,” Harry nodded, “that’s where you’ll be heading to. And you need not fear detention, Hermione, this is an official invitation from the Headmistress. As Madame Pomfrey still believes me to be unfit for Apparation, I’ve been asked to name someone to step in for me – and I took the liberty of giving them three names. McGonagall agreed. It’s going to be quite a large search party anyway, McGonagall, Flitwick, Shacklebolt, Josh and Narcissa.”
“Excellent muffin,” he said and then asked, “I guess you will take the Hogwarts Express as well? How about sitting with me and my friends on the train? Ginny Weasley will be there as well – my best mate’s sister – she’s also a sixth-year student.”
Kissing Draco was far more exciting than any kiss Harry had ever shared before. Their tongues met – jolting a wave of arousal through Harry’s body. This was different, this was new, this was what he wanted. Harry groaned without moving away from Draco’s mouth.
“Exactly, it’s a pattern of runes. On request from Professor Dumbledore – the real wizard, not the Imagic – Professor Flitwick painted these runes onto the curtain. Filius had no idea why, he just did what Dumbledore asked him to. When he examined the painting after the Imagic was gone, he found the pattern changed. It seems that Dumbledore’s Imagic was able to switch the position of the runes, so he could leave a message on the curtain before he disappeared.”
Luckily Hermione and Cass knew a lot about Lady Library and her love affairs in the cause of Hogwarts’ history. They retold stories of her previous lovers and for once everybody listened closely to a history topic.
Harry felt a violent flush creeping up from his neck to his cheeks. He wanted to say something, explain himself – but nothing but a croak left his throat. Ginny was way too observant. And being his ex, she knew him far too well.
Of course Ariana was all alone in her portrait, Albus Dumbledore’s Imagic could hardly have swaped places like that, from the Ministry Archives to the Hog’s Head Inn. Harry sighed. Admittedly he was still a bit disappointed. He had hoped without reason to find the familiar bearded face at her side. Well, that would have been too easy. Plus Aberforth most probably would have reported the continuous presence of his brother’s Imagic to the Headmistress.
Cass and Draco stored their trunks away and sat down. Harry’s friends stared at the newcomers, as if they didn’t believe what they were seeing until Ginny blurted, “Wow, you two really could be identical twins! Harry told us you look alike – but I didn’t expect… this is… wow.”
Draco shook his head, “No, they won’t. Jordan simply removed the spell. Didn’t work properly anyway and he had pity with me suffering from side-effects. He just made me promise not to run away – can you believe it? Hufflepuffs!” He snorted.
I've just revised several chapters to eliminate a mistake: Luna is of course a member of Ginny's cohort and not Harry's. Sorry about that. And a special 'Thank you!' to the splendiferous Potter expert M.G. ;)
When Harry and Cass finally climbed down the staircase from the owlery and were walking back to the castle’s main entrance, they bumped into Ginny and Draco, who had just returned from running and were both drenched by the rain, all sweaty and laughing amiably. Seeing them so happy together, Harry’s jealousy melted. How could he begrudge Draco this? Dating Ginny would eventually bring Draco closer to the Weasley clan, the most loving and caring family Harry had ever known – maybe that was exactly what Draco needed…
Just as Harry started to write down the first question, the door opened and Draco appeared, slightly dishevelled, hair tousled and wearing a navy-blue dressing gown over pyjamas of the same colour. They stared at each other for a moment – until Harry started to laugh with relief.
“As long as I stick with the topic of last lesson or Transfiguration in general, she’s talkative,“ said Hermione, “but as soon as I try to bring up any other issue, she locks up like a clam.”
“Hermione just told me what’s happened at your D.A.D.A. class, that everybody knows about his… his Patronus… and now you’ve turned him down, apparently.” She stared accusingly at Harry.
Draco shrugged with a crooked smile. “Can’t be careful enough. I’m up against an army of devoted fans, have to mark my territory.”
He cleared his voice and looked right into Harry’s eyes, “To spell it out for you, I’m gay. Did you really never get that?”
“Well, we’re a boring old couple, Frankie and I. Frank’s a vet and I’m a social worker, mainly doing school counselling. In a way, that’s how we met David, because I mistook him for one of my students. You know David’s cousin, Cass?”
“Ballroom dancing is considered part of pure-bloods’ social skills repertoire,” Draco said with a shrug, looking up at the ceiling as if talking to no one in particular, “Cassy and I had lessons together when we were just kids.”
“I’ve talked to the Headmistress already,” Harry interrupted, “and –sorry Hermione– I’ve got no time for homework this afternoon, I need to check something in the village.”
So this must be Martin McBride. Harry gulped. The man was tall and broad shouldered, had dark hair and a strong chin – in fact he was as handsome as a Muggle film star. Harry didn’t like the looks of him one bit.
Carefully Harry touched the frame – and hardly believed his luck, when the window sash moved! Heart beating frantically, he charmed the hinges to keep quiet and gave it a careful push – ever so slowly, ready to stop at the slightest sound. The magic seemed to work as the window neither creaked nor rattled, it just opened in slow motion. As his eyes adjusted to the dark Harry looked closer. In the meagre light that fell inside from the moon above Harry could barely make out a bed in one corner, two chairs, a chest of drawers.
“Well, you might want to reconsider Christie’s offer, Harry,” Tavin said, “I know her brother, his name’s Carter and he’s actually quite a babe… handsome face, nice bottom and friendly as well… for a Ravenclaw, that is.”
“No, no – it’s only gossip as long as you’re talking about somebody else, right? What I’m asking for is to tell me about your
“Hello Daisy, nice to meet you! Of course I don’t mind, in fact it’s very good of you to come. Please call me Harry, ok?”
The Imagic hesitated before he continued, “Mr Potter, please allow me to bring up another topic – may I ask you how Mr Malfoy is doing? I hope he is well? You seemed rather… close when we met a few weeks ago at your common room, that’s why I’m asking.”
Harry turned towards Hermione, “What do you make of the latest abduction? The Fat Lady, huh? That’s an attack against Gryffindor, don’t you think?”
“You don’t need to be gay to know that homophobia just sucks,” Blaise said, reluctantly accepting Laddley’s prolonged presence at school.
“Good to see you too, Mr Dumbledore! And of course you’re right about Seamus, he’s just dodging to buy the next round,” Harry grinned and predictably enough his friend rose to fetch them drinks. Their laughter drew the attention of other customers and Harry realized that Professor Laddley was watching them too.
Harry did not know what to make of Draco’s attitude. Was he really jealous just because Harry simply talked to another guy who happened to be handsome? Harry did not know whether to laugh or to be offended.
“Exactly, Miss Weasley,” Narcissa agreed, “I am fully aware of that, and therefore I want to express my sincere gratitude. And Draco’s.”
Josh seemed to anticipate Harry’s impulse of rage. He shook his head and whispered, “Stay put, Harry.” With his free hand he grasped Harry’s wand-arm and held him back. Harry was startled by the sudden touch and froze. Being so close to Josh was… irritating. But not in an unpleasant way.
he thought. He sighed and started to put the many parchments and books Hermione had left at his bedside table into a bag.
“Thanks for the fashion advice, by the way!” Harry gestured at his and Draco’s outfit and winked at Hermione.
Daisy smiled, “Oh no, I love to be in the forest at night! The Headmistress told me exactly how to behave anyway… and I have a friend to keep me safe.” She grinned and pointed up the tree behind her, which was so tall its top must be way above the frame. Up in the highest visible branch Harry could barely make out massive claws of a bird, hidden in the thick of twigs and leaves.
“What for?” Draco blushed deeply, “You just saw it yesterday, I assure you it’ll be still the same.”
“Hallo everybody!” Josh flashed his signature smile at them before turning to Draco, “Mr Malfoy, would you please come with me for a moment?”
Draco had regained his spirits again and protested, “You are getting me in so much trouble, Potter!”
Draco obeyed. He touched Harry’s chin with soft fingers to make him raise his face again. He kissed Harry’s lips, the corner of his mouth, his cheek. He lingered for a moment at the soft spot just below Harry’s ear before he kissed his way down Harry’s neck.
“I wouldn’t expect you to,” Harry reassured her. “Honestly – I’m quite impressed, that he spent his holidays studying for your sake – but don’t ever tell him I said that!”
“May I remind you, Harry, that I’m not a guy,” she said with a flush and pulled her dress straight again, “but I get your point. Sorry, we got a bit carried away.”
Duck Egg’ the painter had called it. Oh well, he did not want to consider what his subconscious was telling him.
“Are you insane?” Harry took Draco’s wrists, locked him into position and hissed, “You are not turning yourself in, do you hear me?”
He opened the door with a knock, gave his usual call, “Hello, it’s me, Harry!” and headed straight for the kitchen. To his utter amazement the only person present was Josh Jordan. The subject of his latest erotic fantasies was wearing an apron und busy preparing lunch.
And with a warm smile, a dazzling glance of those damn beautiful grey eyes and followed by a final bow of courtesy Draco Malfoy turned away to approach a group of very excited fourth-year girls and asked one of them to dance.
“I never said it’s simple, relationships never are! It’ll be anything but easy, because we’re both stubborn. There will be misunderstandings and fights, but also –“ he nodded towards the spot where the Patronuses had disappeared “– this! Don’t you think, this is worth some struggle?”
“Ginny said, Ms Malfoy offered to help you to get rid of that annoying portrait of Sirius’s mother in the entrance hall? I wonder why she thinks she can do anything about that, when even the best Aurors of the Ministry have failed.” Hermione said. “Not that I’d miss being called ‘
“Must have been in August… I don’t know the exact date. It was a Monday, I remember that much,” said Harry. “You see, it didn’t seem to be such a big deal at that time. And with an Auror present I thought it must be ok… I’m sure Mrs Malfoy isn’t even aware, that the hexed painting is illegal! She never asked me to keep quiet about what she did and she told Josh- ah, Professor Jordan in advance, did it right under his nose! She would never have done that, if she had been afraid of getting Draco or herself into trouble, don’t you think?”
at the Burrow as long as I can remember, but I always assumed this was dad’s thing! Come to think of it the journal mostly rests on her bedside table, not on dad’s.” Ron shook his head. “When mum was always pushing us kids to excel in Defence, I thought it’s because she wants us to be safe – not because she’s an ace in this!”
Harry had heard more than enough. Finally he regained control of his legs again, turned around and headed back for the safety of his own room. When he closed the door, he exhaled deeply. To think just minutes ago he had considered confessing his feelings to Draco! Blaise had spared him an emotional disaster.
To the sound of trumpets all members of staff entered the hall and took seats at their table. Harry was oddly touched to see, that Josh Jordan too was wearing a kilt. Flitwick looked dashing in dress robes displaying a pattern of colourful flowers and even Hagrid had wrapped an apron over his trousers for the occasion.
Harry proudly presented Otto in his cage and the bird blinked his huge eyes at Hagrid, who immediately started to fawn over the owl.
No, Harry was not going to chicken out of this. He had encouraged Draco to hide, so it was his call to tell Draco the threat was over. Harry pulled off the cloak and stepped to the door. Just minutes before he had been afraid to disturb the sleep of Draco’s host – well apparently that he need not fear for. Would Draco be at least a little bit pleased to see Harry? Or rather disappointed? And what if McBride opened the door?
Harry liked this place very much. He felt extremely comfortable and relaxed in this kitchen, in the company of their hosts although he had just met them. Odie and Frank joked and laughed a lot, in fact their constant teasing reminded him of Ron and Hermione. Frank shared stories from his work – pet owners seemed to be a funny species all by themselves. The dogs snored under the table and Harry just wanted to stay in this cosy place forever.
Once again Ron and Hermione were the first students at their table, due to Ron’s larger-than-life appetite. “We’ve been worried about you! McGonagall wanted to see you at breakfast and we still have to finish our homework and –”
“Don’t worry, Professor,” said Harry, “I think we best ask the formerly abducted Headmistresses – if I am right, they have talked to her before and might therefore have some sort of connection.”
Cass smiled at him, “She and Draco went cross country running with some others from Josh’s class – early morning sports, can you believe it?”
“Of course we’re going!” Ron said. “Why’s the food late today? I need to eat properly or I might drop some china later!”
They stared at each other for a moment until Draco said, “Do you have a minute? I’d like to… you know… explain something.”
Fake-Draco laughed. He put the stone in his pocket again and grabbed for Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.
Cass burst out laughing. “I know very well, who you are,” she said. “Living in Edinburgh did not prevent me from knowing all about famous Harry Potter.” She glanced sideways at Draco, “I’ve heard lots about you.”
Harry scratched his head. He didn’t want to talk about his deceased parents… but the Weasleys most certainly had proved to be very supportive. “They’re okay… more than okay, great actually! Of course it helps that I’ve got an elder brother who’s gay as well.”
Professor Jordan cleared his voice. “I see. Thank you, Mr Malfoy. A very fine Patronus indeed.” He cast another
“Girl power, that’s what it’s called nowadays, right? You are as crazy as my freak of a daughter, Potter!”
She took the enchanted beaded bag from her cloak’s pocket and pulled out a leather-bound book that was tied with strings and looked oddly familiar.
“Don’t you remember me, darling?” fake-Draco said with mock disappointment. “Oooh, have you forgotten me already? You’re breaking my heart, Harry!”
She pulled a face. “You still should not go alone, Harry… and isn’t it a bit early to invade a pub anyway? I suspect Aberforth is not exactly a morning person.”
“Good afternoon, Mr Potter. First of all, I want to explain, why I suggested asking for your help. It is no secret that Headmaster Dumbledore thought the world of you and used to spend some time with you alone, especially during the last year of his life,” Snape’s painting cleared his voice. “In the course of these occasions he might have shared something with you that could help us to solve this… puzzle. Maybe something personal about his past. Maybe something that just slipped from his tongue unintentionally. Maybe something that had seemed totally unimportant at that time.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “you obviously had no idea that I’m gay too. Tell you what, neither did I until recently. And it doesn’t make me another person, you know? I’m still the same.”
And suddenly they stopped fighting. Both silvery stags took a step back and ever so slowly Harry’s stag turned sideward and presented his vulnerable flank to his opponent.
Only when Luna said, “Oh this is wonderful, I’ll grow a beard for that occasion, I’ve always loved facial hair…” and Dean squinched up his face in uttermost terror, Harry finally started to laugh wholeheartedly, as did all of his friends.
Cass appeared to become best friends with Ginny in no time, but still kept close to her cousin. In fact, the three of them seemed to get along just fine. The first time Harry watched Ginny and Draco laughing together, he was deeply irritated, but tried to accept it for Cass’ sake. Astonishing enough Ron didn’t object. Maybe he tolerated the new addition to their gang because Hermione obviously rejoiced in the intellectual battle of words with Cass and Draco. All in all having Draco Malfoy around every day didn’t feel half as bad as expected. In fact it was quite… interesting.
Narcissa Malfoy shook her head. “No. Imagics change size to fit in any other painting they enter.” She looked determined. “As I said, stay out of sight and let me handle this.”
“Eric, what are you doing in my group? Don’t you usually swim with the advanced guys? Come on, move to Tommy’s lanes!” Eric blushed, switched lanes and had of course no problem keeping up with the advanced swimmers.
Harry could have kissed her for this statement. He just about refrained from actually hugging her in the presence of Flitwick and beamed at her instead. They had moved away from the former trap painting after encouraging an exhausted Sylvia Silver to take a nap and now sat around Flitwick’s desk to discuss the latest findings.
“Makes sense,” Ron smiled at his girlfriend, “and makes one wonder, what else we should ask our elfish friend…” He turned to Kreacher again, “You haven’t by any chance come across some Imagics in unusual places? Here at Hogwarts I mean?”
anybody for your sexual orientation? Why would I? There is nothing – absolutely nothing wrong with being gay! It’s nothing to be ashamed of, nothing out of the ordinary – it just happens to be rarer than being straight.”
“Good evening, Headmistress,” Laddley said before he turned towards the students and added, “Mr Potter, Mr Hillborogh.”
“Exactly,” Harry said with glee, “mind you, my hands were still flaming red this morning! But Madame Pomfrey suggested some changes to the potion, the Healers gave their consent – and the new recipe works wonders! I think I might even be ready to fly again this weekend! That’s why I didn’t push coming along tonight… better take it easy for now – to be in good enough shape for finding Draco as soon as possible.”
Suddenly Harry had a lump in his throat. “I know.” He gulped. “It’s just… I promised… I can’t talk about it… it’s not
Cass crossed her arms in front of her chest and Harry assumed, that was her way of refraining from punching him.
“Sickness, dizziness mostly… feel’s a bit like making an apparition jump while being drunk. It’s supposed to happen when they put the tracker on you but not for long. As my tracker went off and on several times some days it was no fun. So Jordan had mercy with me… I told you, he’s a decent guy and he would be perfect for you. Did I mention that I hate him?”
He improvised, “Listen, before Draco left, on our way to the ball, he finally mentioned something about Laddley. Remember, I pestered him for weeks to spill the beans about that homophobic arse? Turn’s out Laddley has a huge grudge against Draco’s father. I want to know why. Aberforth mentioned being friends with Laddley’s late mother so he might know something about that.” He paused. “And of course you can come along, I just intended to make it quick and fly–” he looked at Hermione, “knowing you are not particularly comfortable on a broom I thought I’d rather go alone and hurry back, to tell you everything.”
“So I asked myself: Had you somehow gained ownership of the Resurrection Stone too? Well, that’s when I remembered this little gem.”
“Harry asks you to tell him… tell us, about Professor Laddley’s room.” Hermione said. “Was there anything unusual about it? Maybe an item Professor Laddley hid or stored in an unusual place? A bottle of potions for example?”
“No need to feel sorry for me, not all of my family are homophobic idiots. Draco, Aunt Mella and even Aunt Cissy always stood firmly at my side. They are the family that counts.”
“Oh, no,” Luna laughed, “at least, I don’t.” She smiled at Draco. “But I’m glad we are friends this year, Draco… I really like you, after all… but of course, you fancy somebody else.”
To avoid that, he shoved some food into his own mouth. “Wow, that’s fantastic,” he said after the first forkful.
“I’ll be delighted to serve the noble house of Gryffindor!” the Imagic had declared, wich reminded Harry of Dumbledore’s comment about sorting too early. Headmaster Severus Snape truly had been one of the bravest witchards of all times.
Harry was bewildered – that was certainly not what he had meant! He was just about to protest vehemently, when he realised Narcissa Malfoy was maybe… teasing him? Well that was a first. He grinned back at her. “As long as you don’t tell him.”
Shooting Harry a grateful glance for having kept his promise, Cass replied, “Well, my father insisted and got away with it. But you are quite right, it’s compulsory, ever since the Act of Magical Education was passed in 1778 as…”
Only a few hours after Draco must have written these lines, Harry was still in bed reading and rereading the letter Otto had delivered at dawn. He smiled to himself, relieved that Draco had come to his senses and dropped the crazy idea of going Muggle. On the other hand, the mental image of young Master Malfoy busily cooking and cleaning was highly entertaining – disregarding the unknown entity of his hosts. As Draco kept referring to them in plural form, Harry had to fight a mental image of a shared house full of hot young men, who all tried to get into Draco’s pants. Which was ridiculous of course. Draco had written nothing to suggest anything like that, but still.
“Honestly, I think he would be safer here at school. You can tell him to return as soon as any suspicions about him being involved are dropped. Therefore we need to prove he was indeed framed by his uncle and whoever was his accomplice in this – most likely Laddley.”
“Well, I doubt that she intended to help me… but anyway. I was lurking near the main door of the castle for ages and was about to give up, when she suddenly appeared and distracted the Aurors on guard. She asked them a lot of questions and insisted on leaving the door open for some minutes… said she needed some air. It was the perfect opportunity.”
“You’ve a point, Mr Malfoy! When Blaise found out that I’m gay, he even offered to hook up with me,” he said to Draco.
“Which makes us go last, I assume? I’ll mentally prepare the Slytherin kids for the road,” Blaise grinned at Harry and Draco, “if you two can spare me for a moment, that is?” he smirked and off he went leaving Draco and Harry alone.
“The thing is, Kreacher…” Harry hesitated – should he tell Kreacher what he needed to know? Or maybe… “I would like to talk to those Maiden-elves myself, if possible? I have a few questions they might be able to answer. Could you fetch them for me and –“ he turned around searching the corridor, yes, there still was this large fancy alcove next to the stairs. He had hidden in this place several times. “We’ll wait for you over there, right?”
He glanced across the table at Draco Malfoy’s mat – and had to admit that it was of exquisite beauty. Lots of green and blue lines formed a vivid picture of waves, with some yellow and bright red highlights looking like sunshine glittering on water.
That’s why Daisy had always felt slightly familiar! Finally he remembered what his subconscious had wanted to tell him for the last two weeks! And he knew exactly what he needed to do this afternoon.
They were in the first floor common room, sitting around the table. Josh had prepared tea for the three of them and Harry was grateful for the hot drink, although his sensitive skin protested painfully when he tried to wrap his fingers around the cup. And of course the tea was less perfect than the many cups Draco had prepared for Harry one floor upstairs.
“Well, I don’t think I’m in trouble,” said Harry, “I’m just curious, what the Headmistress has to say. And as you two,” Harry nodded towards Hermione and Ron, “seem very eager to stay out of harm’s way this year, I’ll make sure I find other people to tell what’s going on, in case McGonagall has some exciting news.” Harry was immensely pleased by the shock on the faces of his two best friends and long-time confidents.
The Final Countdown: TWO pending issues - where is Albus Dumbledore's Imagic and where is Draco Malfoy?
“Kreacher will provide for Master’s friends anytime Master Harry Potter wants him to,” the House-elf said earnestly.
“Fine, it is settled then,” Madam Pince sighed, “I’ll wait for you at the library… not hungry any more…” she murmured turning away, “… way too excited…”
Harry sighed. Immediately Draco turned around with raised eyebrows – and Harry focused on Professor Flitwick for a change.
“Maybe he is… but it didn’t feel like that,” Hermione said, ”plus lately he started to call me by my first name, haven’t you noticed?”
“Well, I’m not cooing and I insist I’m most certainly more of a man than my baby-owl,” Harry said in mock hurt making Ron and Hermione laugh.
The Imagic made a swift gesture with one hand but kept quiet. McGonagall turned to Flitwick silently asking for his support.
“But why, you might ask, did Patronuses rarely change in former times? The reason is simple enough: because all kinds of romantic attachment were far less important than they are today. People rarely got married because they were in love. Marriages were often arranged or entered for practical reasons, so the feelings involved were far too weak for any Patronus to change. If it happened at all, it was mostly for switching ones political allegiance or general mindset, which still can happen nowadays. For example, if a former Death Eater’s Patronus were to change, it might be a sign of true reform. Any more questions on this topic?”
“But… I’m not even a very good student! Surely teachers need an academic mind and I’m more… the practical type. I mean, I love Hogwarts but…”
Suddenly Draco couldn’t keep silent any longer and said, “Cass, relax. You won’t need any coaching, you are better than most of the sixth-years – I’ve told you so a hundred times.” He pulled a face.
“There you are, Harry!” said Josh dropping Harry’s bag in front of his room. “I guess you’ll want to retreat for a bit? Take a rest?”
“You know what Hermione thinks? She thinks, you know where he is. She thinks, you helped him get away.” Ron said. “And she’s usually right, Hermione.”
Flitwick and Kingsley nodded eagerly whereas Harry was not totally convinced. As far as he could remember, Dumbledore had indeed sometimes talked in a rather old-fashioned way.
Harry gulped. Seeing Cass so distressed, he felt his own anxiety rising. On the other hand, how could Draco’s mother be so… detached?
A young man jogged around the corner, two well-groomed Shelties on leash. The guy was wearing sweat pants, a hoodie and very dirty trainers. Harry’s heart pounded so fast, as if he had been running and not Draco – because this indeed was Draco Malfoy! Harry could hardly believe his eyes. Draco looked just like your average Muggle teenager – no, not average of course – like an extremely handsome Muggle teenager. In fact Draco looked even better than Harry had ever seen him, relaxed and healthy. He might have gained some weight and it suited him well.
One Thursday afternoon Ms Malfoy fire-called to confirm that she had gained the Ministry’s permission to visit his house, in case Harry still wanted her help dealing with the portrait. Despite Ron’s and Hermione’s scepticism he accepted her offer. He too was not optimistic about Ms Malfoys abilities but wanted to let her try anyway. The prospect of having a Malfoy in his house for some hours seemed a minor inconvenience compared to being stuck with that horrible painting forever. They settled on Monday at two p.m. for her visit.
“You really took me by surprise, Mr Potter, as I wanted to present you with a gift and most certainly did not expect to receive one.” Narcissa hesitated for a moment, before she continued, “As far as I know, you used to keep a snow owl? By the name of Hedwig?”
Harry was only a little bit embarrassed. The kitchen was cosy, it smelled fantastic and he was very hungry indeed. “Thank you,” he said.
“Well, if you must. But no talking! Do you hear me?” She sighed and took a quill and parchment from her apron’s pocket. “I’ll give you five minutes with your friends, just to get an update, assuming you won’t be content without knowing what’s happened.”
Harry opened his eyes with some effort. He was at Hogwarts’ hospital wing and saw with a jolt of pleasure that yes, indeed Ron and Hermione were sitting at his bed. He gave them a lopsided grin. Otto, perched on Hermione’s shoulder, hooted some more.
“Ms Quotation and Prince Charming, my I have your attention please?” Harry jumped in to prevent yet another Granger-Weasley bickering duel. He knew from years of experience, that his friends would go on like that for hours, if he didn’t interfere. “For whatever reason we make different progress, at least there is some progress at all. Let’s stick to our plan and write down what we have learned so far.”
Draco stared at Harry wide-eyed. “This… this is unbelievable! I remember that painting of course! Listen, when I moved into my room, it was already hanging above my bed! That naked lady sprawled across the pink sofa, making luscious movements whenever I looked at her… so gross.”
“Don’t peek, Harry!” Daisy shouted and covered the sheet in front of her with one hand. “You are making me nervous! And I’m sure Ariana feels the same!”
“Yeah, I want to fly into the village and thought Otto might join me,” Harry shouted back before he addressed his pet, “You’re not riding on my shoulder up in the air, my friend! Don’t you remember you’ve got wings and can fly on your own?”
“Well, well… this has to stop, Potter, I need you alive and sensible,” Taurus Malfoy said, “let’s agree to disagree, shall we? I know that I am an excellent artist, you are clearly in the wrong to think otherwise. Anyway, we need to focus on more pressing matters.”
Harry chuckled, “I agree, he might be a bit of an idiot… but at least he tries to make himself useful… I’m afraid he’ll be back soon.”
“Quite right you are, Mr Potter,” the Imagic sighed, “but death – I must say – has a tendency to unmask absurdities, as you will find out for yourself one day… may that day be far from now. Anyway, I’m not here to discuss your friendship – “ Snape lifted his hands in defence when Harry started to protest, “I wanted to have a word with Mr Potter. As soon as our messenger,” he pointed to a red squirrel that jumped eagerly from oak to elm, “has alerted me – as was her duty – that you, Mr Potter, were up already, I dropped by. I expected you to be alone.”
“I have no idea what you are talking about,” Harry said before he cleared his voice and turned towards Ron, “Where’s your lovely girlfriend by the way? Still flirting with Lady Library?”
“Hogwarts has a life of its own, haven’t you realized that by now? The castle can sprout rooms… like a tree might sprout new branches. I’m sure if there are students desperately in need for a secret room to hide in, the castle will provide for them, same as it did in the past.” Aberforth grinned, “But I guess you didn’t come to see me to discuss Hogwarts’ architecture – although this is a fascinating subject.”
“Exactly,” Draco shouted back, “but only for a few more months! You’ll be ever so glad when school’s over, won’t you?”
It was a painting indeed. On the wall next to the upright piano there was a large oil-painting with a beautiful forest scene on display, a sunlit clearing surrounded by tall trees in autumn colours.
“Alright he is,” was the answer. Pale hands with freakishly long fingers planted three glasses in front of Harry with so much force the butterbeers spilled over. “Enough said.”
“C’mon Dray, let’s go – clearly we are not wanted!” Cass laughed and darted off into the grounds. Draco shrugged, stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets and followed his cousin in a more subdued pace, not without glaring at Harry one last time before he turned around and was gone.
“I had no idea, Molly was such a star in Defence!” Hermione said hurrying next to Ron, who seemed determined to reach Gryffindor Tower in record time. “But of course she must be excellent! After all she was the one to defeat Bellatrix Lestrange!”
“And you can come and visit – if you want to sit between piles of books, that is,” Ron winked at Harry. “Well, that’s what happens, when you open your relationship to third parties, I guess.”
“McGonagall thinks Kingsley is a traitor? Has she lost her marbles?” Ron said with a bewildered expression and Hermione just gawped at Harry.
Before Harry had a chance to reply, Draco hissed, “Shut up or I swear, I’ll curse you!” It did not sound like a joke at all.
“Willingness is quite enough at this point,” McGonagall nodded supportively, “I wouldn’t trust you one bit, if you pretended to be all comfortable with our arrangement so quickly. I’m well aware it’ll take some time to adjust. If you stick with your part of the agreement, we will see how that works for you in good time.”
The cup had gone missing at the day of the Battle of Hogwarts. As it was holding an Imagic, it was as good as unbreakable and could not simply have been crushed. The timing of its disappearance alone was suspicious to Harry. He told the Headmistress about his theory and insisted on enquiries about Laddley’s whereabouts during the Battle. But he had to concede reluctantly, that his least favourite teacher could hardly have nicked the cup, while holding his position in Geneva, still in service of the Ministry. The other new teachers were also in the clear for that night. Tharros had still been abroad and Josh had spent the night on duty securing the Ministry at the time of the battle. Another dead end apparently.
“That would only be Millie and Floppy,” Kreacher nodded eagerly. “Kreacher will fetch them in an instant!” And with a final crack he was gone.
“Your aunt said your grades are really good! And I’m sure you are brilliant as you managed to pass at all, considering you never attended regular classes,” Harry said.
“If you’re trying to spot Narcissa Malfoy, you can stop looking,” Ginny said falling into her seat. “She’s having lunch at her own room and Cass is keeping her company.”
Laddley looked crestfallen and Josh jumped in. “Harry, just… of course it is your decision, nobody is forcing you to listen, but… you might want to reconsider. Others have heard his confession and… frankly you should know as well. Take your time. It doesn’t have to be today. Mr Laddley is staying at Hogwarts under my surveillance for the weekend. I’ll accompany him back to London on Monday.”
“Well, I wasn’t sure until recently… just never came around telling them my doubts, other stuff always seemed more important, like fighting Voldemort and such nonsense.” He grinned at her. “How come you weren’t surprised at all? We’ve just met and still you knew?”
As soon as she had closed the door, Tavin said, “An impromptu Transfig’ test? Seriously? She’s the worst! I bet she won’t even do that tomorrow, she just enjoys winding us up! One hell of a Transfig’ teacher – she sure knows how to transfigure good mood into strained anticipation!”
“Yeah, exactly – David’s suggestion of course. His favourite book… such a huge fan he is.” Odie chuckled.
“I get your point,” Draco chuckled, “just give me a second…” and with swift fingers he moved both his own and Harry’s sporran aside. Yes, this was much better. Instead of two bulky bags Harry could feel… well, two other bulks. When he moved his hips tentatively, Draco responded immediately.
Why, oh why not? I crave your comments, they delight me - so please don't be shy, spill it out, babe!
“Aren’t you in a brilliant mood today,” Cass muttered before turning her attention back to the others. “Well, at least one of us is happy – I’m totally excited, can’t believe I’m finally going to Hogwarts!” Her grin was as wide as possible.
“Are you not? Well, this gets even more interesting,” fake-Draco cocked his head. “Let’s see… you want to know who I am? How about I tell you as soon as you have guessed correctly, what I want from you?”
“I give up,” Harry raised his hands in mock despair, “if you don’t get the difference… you’re hopeless. But a good dancer, I’ll give you that.” He grinned at Draco and was rewarded with another smile. They seemed to be back on friendly terms – for the moment, at least. Certainly no need to feel threatened, Harry thought, so why was his pulse suddenly racing?
They started with the second floor common room. Harry knew what to expect when he heard the music. He opened the door and – yes, there was Draco playing the piano, in fact he was the only student present. The others were probably outdoors on such a fine day.
Harry’s mind raced. He was full of questions but at the same time unable to speak. He suddenly remembered that Charms lesson, when they had practiced changing the colour of clothes… he had feared of giving his feelings away by creating that perfect shade of bluish green for Draco. And now Draco’s feelings had been exposed… or had they?
“I’m afraid I have to go fetch my owl now. Thanks for the tea, you’re an excellent, if adventurous cook! And I’m looking forward to seeing you again soon.”
“Most helpful. It took me just one glance and I knew the place. Actually, Ginny – you’ve been there before with me – it’s the little teahouse of the Manor.”
“Yes, but let’s face it: they did not raise me. Draco’s upbringing and mine… that was tough. We are both survivors in our own way… we are so very much alike.”
“Harry!” the rough voice of Hagrid drowned out all other noise as Hogwarts’ gamekeeper found his way to them.
“Oh Merlin,” Harry gulped. Lost for words he reached for Laddley’s shoulder and pressed it for a moment. The unexpected touch startled the man and he stared at Harry.
“But this is ridiculous! This is not your decision to make! You only have to ask yourself, if you want to be with me! That’s it!”
“What is it, Harry?” asked McGonagall as soon as Laddley was out of sight. “Some good news would make for a nice change.”
“If you say so,” Harry said, “don’t worry, I’m not going to rip his head off or something, we’ve managed not to kill each other for seven years now – so I guess we’ll survive another one,” Harry grinned. “I’m just glad you finally get a chance to go to Hogwarts, it’s such a great school. Ms Malfoy said you’ll be taking sixth-year’s lessons? I’m sorry you won’t be in our year but the sixth year students are a nice crowd as well.”
Today was not much different. Harry trusted Neville to elbow him, in case he was about to miss something essential. Harry gave his neighbour a glance. Did he guess why Harry was rather absentminded? Well, Harry could not help it. At least Neville never made obnoxious comments like Blaise, who had lately started to tease Harry during swimming lessons quite a bit. Which was totally embarrassing, but at least Draco didn’t hear any of it. Harry just hoped Blaise would not broadcast his suspicions… although knowing Blaise that seemed rather inevitable.
“Oh.” Draco blushed. “Thank you!” He smiled warmly at Harry who was glad to be seated – otherwise his knees might have given way.
“Sorores – that’s Latin for sisters,” Andromeda translated. She picked Teddy up from her lap and sniffed at the baby’s bottom. “Time for a nappy change, Master Lupin – maybe your uncle Harry will take care of that, while I heat the soup?”
Kreacher nodded and gulped down his tears. “Master Regulus died… and then they took Master Sirius away and Kreacher was all alone for a long time… until Master Taurus Malfoy came by with the nasty book and tried to work out how to open it properly. Kreacher could have told him how to do it, of course, but Master Taurus never asked.”
Harry nodded again. Suddenly he was painfully aware that he rarely spent time with Ron alone anymore. It was always Harry, Ron and Hermione. And as much as he liked Hermione –she truly felt like a sister to him– he missed being with Ron alone. Just the two of them, two guys. During previous school-years Ron and Hermione had not been an item – well, at least not officially. Quidditch practise and of course separate dormitories for girls and boys granted that for a few hours, Harry and Ron were without her.
Not much progress had been made since the release of the Fat Lady and the Headmistresses’ Imagics. The only significant news was Flitwick’s discovery that the two trap-paintings –the Lady’s Boudoir found at Draco’s room and the Banquet kept at the Manor– had indeed both been hexed by the same person. As Ms Malfoy and Cass insisted, that Taurus Malfoy had hexed the painting at the Manor, he must be responsible for the other trap-painting too.
“I understand,” Harry said amused. He had a strange feeling, seeing this Imagic of a girl… her old-fashioned dress, her long hair reminded him of something, of someone… although he was sure he had never seen her before, she triggered some déjà vu – but he could not remember clearly.
Hermione and Ron entered. Hermione in black tails looked passably conventional compared to Ron’s sexy gown of cinnamon coloured silk, the plunging neckline showcasing his ginger-haired chest.
“Draco, is it now?” Ron raised his eye-brows in mock horror, “well, well, things have come to a pretty pass.”
The impressive claws lifted from the branch and within seconds a huge raptor sailed to the forest floor touching down next to the girl. Both Harry and Draco involuntarily took a step backwards and Draco even cried out. The bird was gigantic and with sulphur yellow eyes and a beak bigger than Daisy’s hand the beast looked positively terrifying.
“How about a leash and a muzzle? Would that make it easier? You could ask Flitwick to paint some,” Harry suggested silently bemused by Snape’s fear of a toy poodle. Thinking of animals to be afraid of, Harry asked, “Where’s Daisy, by the way? She’s alright, I hope?”
“Before you ask,” Draco said in a surprisingly calm voice without turning around, “no, it wasn’t always a stag. It used to be a whippet… a nice dog actually.”
“Harry,” McGonagall said, “calm down. Do I really have to remind you, that in his attempts to kill Dumbledore he wounded innocent others – Ron Weasley among them?”
“No,” Ginny sighed. “Josh Jordan fetched Cassy right after our last lesson to guide her towards her aunt’s room. She’s staying at the guest house by the way.”
In the afternoon McGonagall and Shacklebolt returned from London and immediately called for another meeting. This time Molly and Arthur also took part in it. Harry was immensely relieved to hear that Laddley had turned the corner. The Muggles Studies teacher was still unconscious but the Healers were convinced he would survive and be well again. In the course of the meeting Harry managed to gain Kingsley Shacklebolt’s assurance, that the A.D. would no longer treat Draco as a suspect, when he returned and that they would secure Draco’s journey back to school. Back at his room after dinner Harry had written his letter to Draco, impatiently waiting for Otto to wake up.
“Sorry to disappoint you, Luna, but that’s just rubbish,” Dean said, “it’s simply a game, not an oracle.”
“Oh, wow… wait… wait a second,” Draco pulled back. “It’s just… it’s getting a bit hard –“ Harry’s hips surged against Draco’s once more who immediately pushed back, “– I mean hard to ignore, isn’t it? Pity the Room of Requirement was destroyed.”
After a moment of silence Aberforth addressed Hagrid, “Well, I think we better get back to the task at hand, shall we?”
“Sorry, just have to practice the Slow Waltz some more!” Hermione shouted over her shoulder and Ron’s protest.
He made a wild guess and said, “How come I’ve never seen Cass at Hogwarts? She can’t be a Squib as she’s joining this year?”
“Draco? Oh – he hasn’t returned yet… but Kingsley is confident they’ll find him eventually. Or maybe he’ll come back on his own account, if he reads the Prophet – by catching Taurus Malfoy you made the front page of course.” Hermione said. “Anyway – Draco’s no longer in danger and that’s the main thing.”
“Harry doesn’t like chess and this is anything but boring, Blaise!” protested Luna, “I find it very entertaining indeed! And the cards can even predict one’s future while playing!”
Apart from that he was full to the brim. Odie’s fresh bread had been accompanied by bacon and eggs, fried mushrooms and peppers, home-made marmalade and in the end a slice of rich chocolate cake – which gave Harry a pretty good idea why Draco might have gained some weight in bareley a month.
“No, definitely not interested, at least not anymore,” said fake-Draco. “That might have been my intention a few weeks ago. I admit to setting him up, but luckily that didn’t work out and I found something far more worthwhile to fight for.”
“Right… first question- house loyalties? Well, Jordan seems to be just as truthful and trusting as any Hufflepuff is supposed to be. As head of house Tharros has to be a Gryffindor of course.” Harry jotted down their houses’ names, “Laddley is a Slytherin, that’s at least one fact I’ve established. I’ve even heard rumours that he might become the next head of Slytherin as soon as Slughorn retires. That’s supposedly why the board of school governors brought him in – to enforce some change on Slytherin, 'cause having a Muggle studies expert for Head of House is a big thing, of course.”
“She says, she doesn’t know the name of the place, but she could draw it, if you want?” Daisy repeated.
Lovely readers, if you happen to enjoy my story, I'd be delighted about social media postings to attract new readers. *greeeedy Auntie*
As Blaise was very fond of gossip he had already told several people about Harry’s conflict with Professor Laddley before the Headmistress had asked for his discretion. He didn’t even known what exactly had happened and wasn’t fully aware of Tommy’s involvement, but still rumours spread among the students like wildfire.
“Hear, hear,” Harry said, “I remember well enough the P.E. lessons at primary school to fully agree with Malfoy for once – what a waste of time that’ll be.”
Cass nodded, “I’ll take a sandwich to his room after dinner. I’ve been doing this quite often, whenever he skipped a meal.”
“Ah, the famous cloak,” Draco touched the delicate fabric lightly from inside. “We could even stay right here, hidden under the cloak, couldn’t we?”
“Kreacher wants to air all the rooms properly, dust off the furniture and have a good look around to make sure everything is the way as it should be for Master Harry Potter Sir,” the House-elf declared with great importance.
The Gryffindor common room was packed and everybody cheered when he entered. The news of Harry Potter’s visit had spread quickly and more and more students were hurrying down from the dormitories. Harry grinned widely, it was really nice to get such a warm welcome.
“Hi Harry, come to see your feathered friend?” Hagrid shouted over the agitated cries of dozens of owls. He pointed at Otto who immediately fluttered towards Harry to sit at his shoulder. The familiar grip of sharp claws was a little bit painful but still very comforting.
“Is it still done today? I mean, the pure-blood kids at school, are they all spoken for?” Harry asked incredulously.
“Well, apparently their affection for me was rather short lived. It just took some very intensive cross country runs in bad weather plus the latest news of your coming-out – and they were ready to trade me.”
“It’s simple enough. Both of us tie a hair around his leg and I will add a spell, that’s all. Nobody else will be able to follow his flight or to obtain the letters we pass. You still won’t know where I am but we could write to each other… if that’s what you want?”
“Home-schooling is done among Muggles as well, you know,” Hermione said to Cass, ”some very conservative parents like to keep their kids at home to ‘preserve’ them from learning stuff they don’t agree with, no matter if it’s solid Muggle science.”
Harry was taken aback. “Look – I didn’t want to offend you! Aberforth is a friend of mine, I just wanted to make sure he’s alright, ok?”
Harry shook his head. Whatever he felt, he was not appalled. Surprised, yes, even disappointed – but at the same time he was grateful, that Draco was candid about it.
“We wanted to ask you something, if you have time? It won’t take long, maybe we could come in for a minute?”
Harry gasped. “No way! I don’t believe this for a second, there must be a mistake surely. Draco can’t be involved!”
Kingsley cleared his voice, “However unfortunate it is that you did not mention this before, Harry, at least we know now. What interests me most: Where is that trap painting you claim to have seen?”
Narcissa Malfoy went on, “That was the last straw. Her parents were furious. You have to understand that traditional pure-blood families have their own way of dealing with homoerotic preferences. Wizards may enter same-sex relationships as long as they also get married and reproduce. But intimate relationships between witches are never ever tolerated.”
They all rose and went to the easel. Daisy grinned proudly and held a drawing in front of her chest.
“No, unfortunately not,” McGonagall said, “it’s the two Headmistresses and the Fat Lady. As happy as we are to have them back, I’m afraid they will not be very helpful in solving this case. But maybe I’m wrong… Filius is presently preparing to remove the hex. I hope we’ll find out soon enough what they can tell us about their abductor.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat when everybody’s favourite dancing couple came to a halt next to him and Ginny.
For the moment they had to deal with an overcrowded pool area as about twice as many students wanted to join the swimming lesson today than usual. Quite a number of them had probably come to show their loyalty towards Harry and not because of their sudden interest in swimming.
The other Healer said, “Well, that’s settled then. Madame Pomfrey, before we head back, we need to tell you about Mr Dumbledore’s treatment so far. Maybe we could talk somewhere in private for a minute?”
“Yeah, I know,” Harry said, “I’m worried too. But I can’t do anything about it, if he refuses to let me!”
Harry could relate a lot to Cass’ story. He recalled all too well Aunt Petunias fury whenever his hair grew back the way it was meant to look and how unable he was to be the ordinary Muggle boy his relatives wanted him to be. Furthermore his new-found awareness about his sexual orientation was yet another thing he seemed to share with Cass. They had so much in common – he really was looking forward to get to know her.
Laddley exhaled deeply. “I met Taurus Malfoy six years ago, at a Muggle dinner party actually. At that time I was working for the Ministry in Geneva. We easily spotted each other as wizards and started to talk. I had no idea he was Lucius’ brother, of course, he called himself Taurus Mayfield at that time. We became sort of friends and eventually he told me how much he hated his brother – before I even realized who that brother was. When I found out his real name, we bonded over our mutual hatred, disregarding our other differences. Taurus knew that I was a loyal employee of the Ministry and didn’t support Voldemort, so when he moved back to England after Voldemort’s return, we lost contact.
“Right.” Harry said. “To imply this painting of a nude lady belongs to Draco is simply absurd. I can assure you, he is not interested in… this kind of picture. At all.”
“Are you laughing at me, Potter?” Draco snapped his book close and looked at Harry, who was deeply satisfied by the startled expression on his rivals face.
“Good morning to you too, Potter,” Draco Malfoy said with raised eyebrows. “As your eyesight must have left you completely in the course of last night, let me tell you: I am reading a book and drinking tea.”
There was a lump in his throat and his eyes burnt… he touched his cheeks suspiciously, yes, he was crying. Harry had not cried for a very long time. In fact, he couldn’t even remember the last time he had cried. Was it at Dumbledore’s funeral? Or maybe when Sirius had died? Well, now he did.
Harry was amused. If he wasn’t totally mistaken, Malfoy’s mum seemed to be quite fond of him – which wouldn’t please that twat one bit.
“That is not a very nice thing to say, Potter. But I can see your point. I most certainly did what I could to keep nosy guests at bay.”
Because there was yet another Draco, again unconscious, bound to a chair and gagged, right in front of him.
Draco Malfoy stood next to his cousin and had heard her story. He rested his hand on her shoulder. “But this is over, Cassy, we’re all safe now,” he said and Harry had never heard him talk with so much tenderness.
“Okay, listen, here's what we'll do... we start with the regular swimmers. Blaise will work with the first group, beginners in lanes one to three. I will supervise the second group, next level swimmers in lanes four to six. Which leaves lanes seven and eight for advanced swimmers, who will be instructed by Tommy.” The regulars cheered and dived, climbed or dropped into their respective lanes and Harry raised his voice some more.
With some effort he managed to draw his eyes away from Draco. There was an extremely handsome boy standing next to him, as tall as Harry, a head of curly blond locks and an admirable shoulder-to-hip ratio. Harry had seen him several times before, always surrounded by a bunch of friends. If he wasn’t mistaken the guy was a very popular fifth-year Ravenclaw.
"Dinner with Ron’s parents was rather helpful as well," Hermione continued, "Molly's and Arthur’s grief put my parent’s anger somewhat into perspective."
Harry shrugged. “I respect your remorse, Prof– … Mr Laddley, but I don’t need to know why you chose to do what you’ve done.”
“No!” Aberforth cut him off again. “Leave it, Harry! I will never tell you – it’s personal and painful and – frankly that’s none of your damn business, boys!” He glared at them.
As soon as Draco was out of earshot Harry said, “I’m really sorry, Professor Jordan, I don’t know what’s gotten into him!”
Tommy cringed again. “He always ridiculed me, made some nasty remarks… plus he complained about my swimming, although I know, I’m not bad.”
Headmistress McGonagall rose from the staff table and the noise and chatter ebbed down. The place to Harry’s right side was still empty. The name ‘
She paused and closed her eyes for a moment, “After your fifth year at Hogwarts Draco… he had a nervous breakdown and then insisted on becoming a Death Eater! I tried to talk some sense into him and Cassiopeia argued with him all summer – but to no avail. Lucius rejoiced in Draco’s decision of course, but I could not understand why my son wanted to take that step when he wasn’t even seventeen years old!
“Welcome to Gryffindor – home of the brave at heart!” Ron said. “Who would have ever thought that possible, a pure-blood by the name of Malfoy with enough spirit in them for our house!” Ron grinned at Draco.
“Poor Aunt Walburga, I am so sorry for your distress.” Narcissa sighed. “I wish I could ease your pain.” She sighed again.
As the game was obviously on hold until Neville was done, Harry addressed Dean once more, “But who taught you, if you didn’t learn it at school… how to charm pictures, I mean?”
Professor Flitwick deeply regretted the changes he had made to Daisy’s pet, he was horrified about the fire Pinkie had set to the pub. When Harry complimented him on the power of his creation anyway, Flitwick declined.
“Hi Harry,” she sat at her usual place with a book in her hands and beamed at him, “yes, your friend Neville told me. What do you want me to do? Shall I try to find the Fat Lady?”
“Nektaria Tharros started to teach right after taking her N.E.W.T. She first went to Durmstrang as an assistant teacher –“
McGonagall paused for a second before saying, “Well, I think we earned us a treat. But before I’ll ask for tea, I suggest we all copy the incident board to take it along.”
“Where’ve you been, mate?” Ron shouted as soon as Harry was close enough, “you look as if the Bloody Baron has haunted you! Everything alright, eh?”
He slouched on his sofa and dozed off for a bit. When he woke up again he browsed through some of his text books.
Harry wrecked his brain and continued to pace the room when a soft noise startled him. He gawped at the window, hardly trusting his eyes – for a split second he thought Otto had come to visit, but of course that was impossible, his pet was still at the hospital wing. So this must be another snow owl glaring inside. He opened the window and fetched the letter, half expecting it to be a message from Narcissa Malfoy. Maybe she wanted to give him her side of the meeting with Arthur and Molly? The owl took off again without waiting for a reply.
Which made Harry wonder, what his friends would say, if they knew whom he actually fancied at the moment? He had tried very hard not to think about Josh for the last week of his holidays. But since they had boarded the train, that would eventually bring him face to face with his crush, he had to admit he was quite nervous to see Josh again, he dreaded this moment as much as he craved it.
“I know he isn’t. But my hatred drove me crazy. I thought I had found a way to hurt the father by harming the son, just like my father, my whole family has been destroyed by what happened to Tim.” He shook his head. “Madness of course.”
Harry wondered what sort of problems Gregory Laddley might have, apart from the recent loss of his mother? Must be quite serious, if Aberforth Dumbledore looked concerned, a man who had come across plenty of troubles during his own life-time.
“No! That is not what I meant!” Harry shouted. He felt a sting of unpleasant truth in the words of his enemy. “Whoever that is, let them go! This is crazy for fuck’s sake!” And he rocked and wriggled some more in his chair.
Dressed in matching robes of dark burgundy, Cass and Ginny walked to the centre of the circle. The classical music stopped – and a fast tune of dance music started.
Harry flattened the parchment they had prepared last Sunday afternoon, which listed all the questions, they wanted to get answered, and three columns, one for each suspect.
Harry shook his head. “That’s just… crazy in so many ways! Mrs Malfoy… in the end… I guess none of us – neither you, certainly not Cassy and not…” he gulped, “not even myself – is responsible for what has happened now, right?”
“But you love us none the less,” Ron said embracing his girlfriend and planting a smack on her cheek, which made everybody laugh.
And from that day on, Harry found his tea at the ready when he stepped into the common room before dawn. No, he was not going to switch that quiet hour for morning work-outs. Which didn’t mean that he suddenly liked Draco Malfoy. Because he did not. At all.
“Ten– no, twenty points from Slytherin for this sexist comment, Mr Zabini,” Josh Jordan said with a deadpan stare and Blaise had the decency to blush.
That is why Harry was content with looking at Draco for the time being. Every time they locked eyes, Harry’s heart jumped. Draco’s smile felt like a promise. Harry was all at once delighted, excited and occasionally a little bit embarrassed about the recurring bulge hidden behind his sporran.
He took a shower. He brushed his teeth a second time. He shaved. He opened his trunk for fresh clothes – and that's when it suddenly hit him.
Molly let go of Ron and gave both Harry and Hermione a quick kiss on the cheek. “And why are the kids in your office on a Sunday morning, Filius? What’s going on? I hope they are not in trouble?”
Suddenly so many things from the past made sense – Draco’s absurd and megalomaniac attempts of killing Dumbledore, his constant hostility towards Harry –
“Don’t worry, we have other places to go… the Wizard’s Wood is just one of four large landscapes that were painted by a famous Charm’s master at the end of the nineteenth century. We still can go for a stroll at the Magic Mountain, the Bellevue Beach and the Merry Meadow. All four of them belong to the Headmistress’ living room interior, Professor McGonagall can still admire three of them in her quarters.”
“That you punched me?” Harry grinned at her, “Nah, I won’t. It’s actually good to know that I’m not the only one worrying about that bastard… have you noticed, how skinny he’s become lately?”
Snape’s eyebrows rose even higher, ”Not at all Mr Malfoy, quite the contrary. Truth being told I’ve had the feeling for some time now, the two of you have very much in common and might be able to get along quite well, if you were ever ready to overcome those ridiculous house prejudices.”
“We are in this together, Harry! Don’t you forget that! I have searched tons of material all week and we need to talk this through properly!” she ranted, “do you have any idea – “
“Yeah, I know… I went to a Muggle school and have some close Muggle friends.” Cass said. “But my father had reasons of his own, he most certainly didn’t want to preserve me… doesn’t matter anymore – I’m here and I intend to enjoy every moment of it!”
Harry frowned and asked, “Aren’t they supposed to be your fan-club? I really don’t need this sort of attention.”
A shrill outcry was the response but it only lasted for a second. “What on earth… who are you… Cissy? Is this really you, Cissy?” the portrait of Walburga Black was baffled.
She turned towards the teacher, “I am very pleased you agreed to take my offer of support and will stay with us at Hogwarts for the time being.”
“Tommy!” Harry was outraged. “That is so… that is beyond disgusting, the guy is totally deranged! You have to report him to the Headmistress! You can’t let him get away with this!”
The morning went by in a blur. Harry was so sleep deprived after several nights of worrying that he found it increasingly hard to be attantive during lessons. Stepping into the great hall for lunch, he felt rather nervous. Would Narcissa Malfoy already be there? Would she sit with the teachers like visitors usually did? He found his place and stared at the staff table.
Harry smiled at the younger student and was just about to say something encouraging, when suddenly a very annoyed looking Draco appeared at his side.
A deafening blast shattered the room. Harry’s chair toppled over and he found himself lying on his back, legs up. He coughed and gawped through dust and smoke – apparently he had done rather too well. Not only had the window disappeared, but most of the wall to the yard was also gone.
Harry did not even want to contemplate, why he was supposed to be listed in Narcissa Malfoy’s bloody good book – he just cleared his voice and said, “Apology accepted, Malfoy… ah, Draco. And no need to get soppy about my testimony, I just told the truth and that’s that.” He shot Narcissa Malfoy a rebellious look and crossed his arms.
performance at school than about my son’s! At the same time he refused firmly to admit to his feelings. Whenever I suggested as much he got angry – I think more with himself than with me.”
“What is it, Cissy?” Walburga Black had obviously taken the bait. “What do you have in mind, pray tell me?”
The other young men grinned. Dean Thomas was obviously having it bad for their blonde Ravenclaw friend.
Harry was in no doubt about the three sisters’ names: Bellatrix, Narcissa and Andromeda Black. He drew a deep breath. There was no denying his entanglement with all three of them.
A sudden knock startled them. Without waiting for an answer the door opened and the Headmistress rushed inside.
“’Morning, Harry!” Ron shouted, “Guess what? All students are confined to Hogwarts’ territory! Even us eighth-years are no longer allowed to go to Hogsmeade – what do you make of that?”
“Never interfere with quarrelling siblings,” Harry told Hermione, “that’s what I’ve learned. As an only child, you and I have no idea about the weird ways they express their love for each other. Even if it looks like Cain might kill Abel – he might just show his affection.”
Ginny and Ron whispered frantically to each other. They did not dare to complain openly about their mother’s presence at school any more, having been told off by Harry and Hermione the day before. But they still looked lamenting.
“Brilliant!” cried Flitwick. “You think instead of interrogating her directly, we simply have to ask some other Imagic to get her to talk!”
Hermione looked at Harry with determination. “Right. Let’s take stock, ok? On the plus side – we have three Imagics back. We know that Taurus Malfoy is the main perpetrator, we know about his means and motive. Laddley was probably his accomplice but has been knocked off before he could own up to it.”
Close to McGonagall sat the heads of houses, Professors Sprout, Flitwick and Slughorn plus a middle aged witch Harry had never seen before. Maybe this was Nektaria Tharros, the new head of Gryffindor house, Arthur Weasley had been talking about? With her olive skin tone, black curls and dark eyes she looked like a Hellenic goddess, Harry thought, very beautiful but like someone you wouldn’t dare to cross. Further down the table, between Kingsley Shacklebolt and Hagrid, Josh Jordan was sitting – and Harry was surprised to realize he had not thought about Josh since their last encounter on the train. Maybe he was able to get over his crush after all?
He was still in the kitchen preparing a night-cup of tea, when Otto, who stayed at home for the weekend after his long-distance training, hooted excitedly. Harry’s stomach dropped as he saw not only one, but two other owls at his window. One brown barn-owl and one familiar looking snow-owl with a snarling glare. At least Otto was obviously happy to see his uncle – or whoever that owl was to him…
“Well, that would be the strongest reason for expulsion ever, but I can’t imagine the Ministry didn’t check each member of staff most carefully,” Hermione said and Harry had to agree with her.
“Get off me, Hermione,” Ron said, “If I read everything you recommend, I’ll drop dead, killed by information overload!” He raised his hand to get the waiter’s attention. “Could you please bring us some more toast? Thanks!”
“What an outrageous fake!” McGonagall snorted, “Albus would never address his fellwos so ridiculously formal! The choice of words is so very unlike Albus –
He would see Draco soon enough, Harry expected. Draco would surely turn up again this morning? They would meet at the common room for early morning tea, they would talk… and maybe today was the day to tell Draco how he felt? His heart beat faster at this prospect. Of course the thought alone was scary, but to go on like before seemed even more torturing.
“As much as I appreciate your jealousy,” Ron said kissing his girlfriend’s cheek, “I can assure you, I’d rather become a monk than let Malfoy grope me,” which made them all laugh.
“Thank you, Madame Pomfrey,” Hermione smiled and addressed Harry again, “You’ve been unconscious for seven days, Harry. Today’s Thursday, the nineteenth of November.”
Ron continued, “I still can’t believe you are sending away our friends to save a seat for Malfoy and his cousin of all people… that Malfoy-babe sure must be hot.”
“Hello Harry,“ Daisy beamed at him. “We hoped to see you anyway but didn’t want to wait here, next to that strange knight. So we lurked just a painting away, hidden behind curtains until he came to search for me.” She giggled again. “That Sir Cardogan is so, so weird! Always tells ridiculous stories about his exploits. We don’t believe half of it, do we, Ariana?” Daisy pressed her friends hand and Ariana Dumbledore nodded vigorously.
Whenever the terrible itch of his healing skin kept Harry awake at night, he could not help wondering… if Draco quite simply did not
“Have you heard of the Chudley Cannons’ latest win?” Ron suddenly asked. Apparently he had used his capacity for talking about feelings to the limit which was just fine with Harry.
“Why did you never tell me –“ Harry stopped mid-sentence, as Hermione was led to the dance floor by Ron. They were no match for Draco and Cass, but still did very well, compared to other couples. Their bodies just seemed so comfortable together… one could actually see how much they loved each other. Harry sighed.
“We’ve got a visitor, Frankie!” Odie shouted over the barking and whining of the dogs. “And you’ll never guess who he is!”
Kreachers eyes were even bigger than usual. “Of course, Master Harry Potter Sir! Kreacher will fetch all them Maiden-elves. But… but that place will be very crowded. Kreacher is afraid it will not be comfortable for Master and Master's good friend,” he took a bow to Hermione, “with seventeen House-elves.”
Malfoy Manor was undeniably beautiful. Sandstone walls, huge windows, cornices and pillars made for an impressive building. But having been here under the worst of circumstances before, Harry felt nothing but repelled by the place. He was glad Ms Malfoy had offered to welcome them at the tea house instead. Still they were supposed to meet her at the front door of the Manor.
“Because you’re an idiot, Ron.” Hermione snorted. “Do you really need some other idiot’s approval – “ she pointed at Blaise “ – for not feeling embarrassed by your own mother?”
Aberforth nodded and turned around holding the door open for them as they stepped inside. Instead of climbing upstairs to his private rooms Aberforth walked along the corridor to another open door at the backside of the old house. Harry and Ron followed him out into a small garden behind the building.
Harry felt deflated. “No, I don’t. You just told me about the whole affair a week ago and said, the collection of Imagics is part of Hogwarts’ security system – but I never really understood how that’s supposed to work.”
Sylvia looked at the other female Imagics’ with pleading eyes. “Why did he put me there in the first place, if he did not like the looks of me? I tried to make myself especially appealing, like Lodovicus had told me to do, taking off my gown and smiling at him… but then he seemed even more distressed.” She sighed. “Finally he took my painting down and stored it in his closet. That is when Pippin disappeared as well and I was devastated, all alone in that closet for days. But Pippin turned up again, first with Amanda and Selena – “ she smiled at the Headmistresses, “and later on your friend Voluptia joined us – “
Much too quickly for Harry’s liking Draco pulled apart again. “But this I can’t have without ruining your life as well – so I’ll make for once a decision based not on what I want, but on what is the right thing to do. I’ll go Muggle.”
“Ah – the dreaded word: but!” Draco threw up his hands. “Well, just let me know, if you change your mind.”
Harry gasped. Ariana’s scetch was perfect in every detail and it took him just one glace to know exactly where the cup was hidden.
“Sorry, pal, but she’s right,” Harry agreed, “I told you so before – you should be damn proud of your mum. So I guess I’ll keep my seat for the time being.”
McGonagall nodded and Harry was shocked – did she seriously consider the possibility of violence swapping into the real world, not just threatening Magical Arts?
Polly the squirrel jumped and landed safely on the Imagic’s shoulder, who smiled and started to pet the animal. From the hall outside the common room Harry heard voices and doors banging.
“Fair enough, pal, fair enough,” Ron slapped Harry’s shoulder, “so let’s get your Slytherin sweet-heart back – Merlin, how weird is that! Hah!” He laughed and poked Harry in the ribs with the handle of his broom.
“So, let’s all go to the gym, check out the dance party, shall we?” Ginny said eagerly. “I think I really want to try ballroom dancing, as Flitwick said I don’t have to bring a partner… pity, you’re paired with Draco already, otherwise I would ask you to dance, Cassy!”
“What?” Harry shouted, “That’s a bit rich coming from you! If I remember correctly, you of all people were quite into those ‘
Harry’s heart sank but he was not altogehter surprised. In fact he had expected something like this.  He nodded gravely and said, “I see. Including Dumbledore’s?”
Cass pulled a face, “Aunt Cissy is exaggerating. I’ve got just one ‘Outstanding’ for Transfiguration and that’s my favourite subject so it barely counts.”
“My first thoughts exactly, Harry. The entry of Draco’s name made no sense at all. That is why I stayed for a few more days and decided to confide in Kingsley Shacklebolt, as he has not been to the archives for months and I never believed him to be involved in the first place. Kingsley quietly checked Draco Malfoy’s tracking records without giving notice to Auror Jordon and had to tell me, the records are dubious for the day in question.”
They were dressed very much alike, except that Draco’s tartan colours were a softer. Harry especially liked the blueish green of Draco’s jacket, the very shade he had created for Draco during Charms lesson.
Maybe his opponent was waiting downstairs, expecting Harry to enter at the backdoor as suggested in the letter? To prevent any intrusion, Harry cast another silent spell, blocking the door to the hall. And one more spell to seal it properly, just to be sure – that should do.
“Quiet please,” Flitwick cried, “In exactly three weeks Halloween celebration will start with an afternoon tea party for all students at five p.m. followed by a festive dinner at seven. After dinner fourth to eighth-year students are invited to stay at the great hall for the ball, younger students will spend the evening at their respective common rooms.” Disappointed sighs and much grumbling from three tables made clear, how the younger students felt about that.
“I had to gain most of my magical education from books up until now…” Cass shrugged. “Plus I’ve always loved books.”
“Good evening, Mr Potter,” said the Headmistress looking as composed as ever, “perfect timing, to see you right now. I wanted to let you know about Professor Laddley’s decision anyway.”
He addressed the other girl directly, “Ariana, I’ve explained this before – we need to find your cup, it’s very, very important to get it back. If you don’t want to talk to me – which is totally okay – why don’t you tell Daisy and she will pass it on to me? How about that?”
“Right,” Harry mumbled. As much as he was impressed by the sheer amount of information that had recently been added to the incident board –mostly the results of Hermione's reasearch– he felt like they might soon drown in facts and not be any wiser.
Laddley nodded. “Yes of course. I’ll think of something for the three of you… to make amends,” he said to Harry’s amazement.
Harry was touched by the Imagic’s eagerness and pondered his offer. “Well, let’s see… what about the dog? We need to know where that poodle came from, who has trained him. Maybe you can take him for a walk, coax him into going to his painting of origin? That would be splendid!”
Draco stepped back, “Wait a minute! You mean to tell me I’ve been hiding without cause? All these precautions not to be caught – and the Aurors are not even searching for me but for someone else?” He looked delighted.
Narcissa Malfoy nodded. “Although Otto will no longer deliver your letters, he might still guide you to Draco’s place of hiding provided that you fly along with him… but only if Draco’s spell includes this backup.”
Harry felt a violent flush creeping up from his neck. “Right,” he croaked, “I’ll have a look upstairs then… see you…” He turned around before Cass had another chance to tease him.
“You are probably right. It’s just… I’m feeling so helpless. Blaming myself, assuming that I could have prevented what has happened makes me feel less… powerless, I guess?” She sighed. “It is all rather pointless. Are you aware that even Cassiopeia is guilt-ridden? Because her very own father is a threat to Draco? I tried to soothe her but she still feels terrible about it.”
Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who both looked as worried as he felt – Laddley must indeed have been Taurus Malfoy’s accomplice and when he was about to come clear, Taurus Malfoy had tried to get rid of him. The question remained how they had managed to stay in contact?
“As I said, first he just created Pippin but then he painted other stuff into my room as well, two letters and a bottle. He told me to put one of the letters into the empty bottle and then he trained Pippin to carry these items around at his command. That wasn’t too bad. Finally he seemed to be satisfied with Pippin’s obedience and then he did something horrible with my painting – I don’t know what exactly he did, I just felt terribly sick and even lost consciousness for a while.” She shivered.
Cass jumped in, “What exactly are you insinuating, Blaise? Draco doesn’t need any excuse, he can practice whatever sports he pleases – just like the rest of us.”
Finally they reached the Hog’s Head Inn which was unsurprisingly still closed. Harry knocked at the door and waited.
Ron protested but Harry went on, “Oh yes, we do. We’re both from fucked up families, both complicated and stubborn. You and Hermione – you come from loving homes, your parents are good, kind-hearted people –“
… he awoke with a jolt, heart pounding. It was only a dream, he had to remind himself, a weird dream. Harry sat up and stared out of the window. It was still dark outside, this was his usual hour to wake up, although yesterday he had gone to bed very late. Nevertheless he was wide awake now.
“Pity, actually, but at least you won’t be disappointed to hear, that I don’t want to talk about the ball, but something else entirely,” said Cass and with an apologetic smile at Hermione and Ron she added, “how about going for a walk after breakfast, Harry? Now’s probably our only chance to go outdoors, before the rain starts again.”
Gregory Laddley looked rather unremarkable, Harry thought. Middle aged guy, sandy hair, friendly face – and rather broad shoulders.
“Apparently Ministry and School Governors alike wanted to improve the Muggle Studies’ curriculum. They decided Muggle politics were more important than dish-washers after all,” Hermione snorted. “Plus he has the option to become Head of Slytherin, remember? Head of House at Hogwarts– that’s not a bad step for anyone’s career. Anyway, when Laddley answered to the job posting he said, he wanted to stay in Britain
“Seriously?! You are joking, right?” Harry stared at her. “Cups for girls and sticks for boys – that’s unbelievably…”
Whenever one of Harry’s friends felt up to it, they joined him in his new home and helped to declutter the old house. Ron, Ginny and even George sometimes just hung around to get away from the atmosphere of grief at the Burrow. Harry did not blame them for needing a break now and then. He knew better than anyone how exhausting it was to grieve and to come to terms with losses. His pain sometimes felt unbearable, especially seeing Molly and Arthur or Andromeda Tonks.
“Are you insinuating one member of my department, Auror Jordan, who also happens to be a suspect in this case, knows about that hexed painting as well?” Kingsley raised his voice staring at Harry.
Harry would not dare to hope they still had a connection, a future, a… – something to look forward to.
“I wonder what McGonagall has to say about this,” Harry said, “but listen – as we have to wait for the Patronuses, I’d like to fetch the Hogwarts’ Cyclopedia of Mean Arts from upstairs, ok? I think it’s time Flitwick takes a proper look at this book… I’ll be right back, ok?”
Harry was confused. Whatever did she mean? There seemed to be nothing wrong with Cass, she looked healthy and – if Harry wasn’t completely mistaken – she was easy-going and friendly.
Blaise, who was still watching from behind Harry’s chair, rolled his eyes, ”Totally insane, that game!”
“Yes please, Dray!” cried Cass climbing up from the sofa, “Play some dance music, will you? A slow waltz maybe? I want to teach Ginny the steps.”
Narcissa Malfoy started to draw the curtain with the uttermost care and said politely, “How do you do, Aunt Walburga?”
“You look like you might throw up any second now, Potter,” Draco said with raised eyebrows, “Afraid I might ask you to dance, are you? No worries, I won’t.”
“But sureley not anymore! Now that we know about his involvement in the Imagic matter, he’s got no chance, right?” Harry asked.
“But why not? The old squeaker might even enjoy it! He has already learned something new by this investigation, remember? He had never heard about the trapping-hex before! Maybe he’s quite interested in your research… at least he will appreciate your effort.”
“Oh, Harry! That’s… fantastic,” Hermione said and her voice was thick. “We’ve been so worried!” She reached for his glasses and carefully put them on his nose.
“But you might not love their filthy paws. They’ve just returned from a walk in the dirt… Frank – that’s my husband – it’s his turn to clean them.” Odie stopped at the foot of the staircase and shouted upstairs, “Frank!? Do you hear me? Don’t forget about the dogs!”
As Harry was not allowed to leave school and go searching for Taurus Malfoy he had decided to focus on the other main suspect, Gregory Laddley.
Draco continued, “Sex seems unlikely considering… well, never mind… but money on the other hand… father has lost any claim on the family fortune because of his criminal conviction, so at the moment most of the money and property is frozen. Mother is only permitted to stay at the Manor, we both have an allowance of our own. But as soon as my probation is over I’ll inherit everything. It’s a lot… more than I’ll ever need.” Draco pulled a face. This prospect did not seem to have much appeal for him.
When he opened the door, Harry was flabbergasted. He stared at the middle aged man in front of him, round face, slightly balding and very kind eyes.
“What?” Harry was shocked. “Are you insane? You want to drop out of the wicharding world?” He knew it was rarely done but now and then a witch or wizard would stop using their magic abilities altogether. Mostly those who had chosen a Muggle partner and were not too talented anyway.
Harry forced his legs into motion and approached the music… at least he wouldn’t have to see them dancing together like last Saturday. Small mercies.
“Miss Granger has of course no idea what you are talking about, Irma,” said McGonagall dryly and Harry was somewhat relieved that at least the Headmistress had returned to her usual matter-of-fact way of talking.
Harry and Cass stepped to one of the owlery’s open windows and gazed down. “Wow, that’s amazing!” Cass was awestruck. The castle stood in all its glory between the Forbidden Forest and the lake. Heavy clouds in the morning light made for a dramatic backdrop.
“Ouch,” said Blaise, “and you’re such a Cassandra, one might forget your full name is Cassiopeia. But, Harry, maybe next week we could do morning workouts? Before breakfast, how about that?”
“'You alright, Mr Potter?” Draco called after Harry. He sounded slightly worried – had he missed Harry at the early morning hour? Or was this just wishful thinking?
As Harry’s gaze fell on another empty frame he asked with alarm, “Where’s Professor Snape? He’s not missing as well?”
“Actually, yes… deputy Headmaster Flitwick has asked to see you after breakfast at his office… Ms Granger and Mr Weasley are also welcome.” The Imagic smirked, “I think Filius has taken an even stronger liking to Ms Granger since she has told him about her research. I got the impression that he now has a serious grudge against the Sorting Hat, for not putting her in Ravenclaw.”
He scooped soup into his bowl although he was not particularly hungry. Soup was maybe a good choice for his empty and slightly upset stomach.
She addressed Harry again, “The Headmistress has informed me about you and Mr Hillborogh having a late dinner for some reason. She also asked me to tell you, that she has spoken to Mr Zabini but it might have been a bit too late. You understand what that’s supposed to mean, I assume?”
“Of course,” Harry said and realized with a pang, that his best friends probably wanted to spend some couple-time without him.
Without ever mentioning it, not to each other and certainly not to anybody else, Harry and Draco Malfoy had both made a habit of spending an early morning hour at the common room before breakfast – together.
“Oh, don’t look so doubtful! I’m pretty sure there are not too many copies of this old thing around considering even Flitwick didn’t know the hex. For a start someone has to ask Madam Pince, I’m sure she knows a lot about it… someone else than me, obviously, as I have… ,“ she flushed and cleared her voice, “I have obtained the book in a slightly unusual manner.”
“Give us some credit, mate,” Ron added, “Plus– anything that’s important to you is important to us as well. Mind you, I still don’t care much for the bloke, but as you insist on becoming friends with him… and Ginny as well…” Ron gulped.
Draco nodded solemnly. “I think it’ll do me good. Find a job, make a living.” He looked at his hands. “I’ll never regain my reputation in our world, no matter what. I’ll always be Malfoy – rich but still the youngest Death Eater ever, not to be trusted.”
Harry stared at her. Suddenly several things seemed to fall into place. His growing aversion to the Auror Department and the Ministry as a whole, his love for Hogwarts, the joy of being with younger kids – maybe he had to reconsider his career plans?
“And the handsome young man, that would be the picture in the bottom row, second from left.” Which was Draco’s picture. The blow did not come totally unexpected, but still Harry winced.
“Well, I’m half Slytherin, what did you expect?” Harry took Draco’s elbow, pushed the curtains aside and started to walk them along the corridor.
will produce every necessary fact. Whatever does not appear, will be of no use to the case.” Harry was glad, to be addressed informally again, she seemed to have forgiven him.
It was unmistakeably a stag. Slightly smaller than Harry’s and with fewer antlers – but without doubt the same animal.
Gregory Laddley squirmed and said, “Well, I’m willing to give it a try… not totally sure about the outcome, though.”
Exactly one week after he had regained consciousness, Harry sat on his bed, still in the hospital wing, but fully dressed. He looked out of the window. It was a beautiful morning, freezing cold but the sun was shining. Today he was finally allowed to move back to his own room, although he had been granted a few more days to recover before having to attend lessons again. Harry planned to make good use of his freedom. Walking in the grounds, some light workout – he was eager to get in good enough shape to fly. He wriggled his fingers. Would he be able to hold onto a broomstick yet? The skin looked still red and bruised, but Madame Pomfrey was optimistic.
Harry laughed at Hagrid, “They’re not abandoning me, Hagrid, really, don’t worry!” Hagrid’s reaction was actually quite helpful, it made Harry realise how ridiculous it was to feel even slightly offended by their need to be alone once in a while. He would certainly want to be alone with his lover – if he ever was lucky enough to find one.
? But maybe Harry had misunderstood? Maybe Draco was really annoyed about having been sent away by Snape last morning? Still, just in case, Harry prepared two cups of tea, his usual Assam with milk and a cup of Earl Grey with a hint of sugar, just the way Draco liked his tea.
“It is time for me to leave, Mr Potter,” said Snape’s Imagic, “Don’t hesitate to contact us, if you are in trouble or in possession of information. Until then, I bid you a good day… and… please allow me to add some piece of personal advice – don’t cling to the past, but embrace the present.”
“Why are you suddenly interested in what kind of literature I prefer?” Draco asked back and the adorable smile was replaced by a familiar sly expression, “How about I’ll let you know what I read, as soon as you tell me what Snape’s visit was all about?”
“So, Ms Silver, have a good look at these pictures, take your time.” Hermione said kindly. “If you happen to recognise any of these men, just tell us.”
“Well of course it’s a huge relief to have that horrible portrait cleared out,” Hermione said, “But that hexed painting of hers? I am quite certain that’s illegal. You know, the regulations on Magical Arts and Crafts are rather strict. I have definitely never heard of any permitted spell to lock people into a painting.”
“Yeah, Flitwick said as much…,” Harry nodded, “of course they made him stay at Hogwarts this weekend so he had no chance of sneaking out a painting.”
Harry’s embarrassment reached an all-time high, but Draco just rolled his eyes and said, “Glad to make you feel at home.”
“Well… I thought you might consider... recuperating by visiting the Manor for a few days? We have lots of interesting portraits, fabulous people who would rejoice in seeing you again… and you could return to your home refreshed afterwards.” Narcissa sounded sad, “But I assume that’s just me being selfish, because I would certainly love to have you around.”
He put on a warm sweater, his coat and gloves. Flying without gloves on a cold November night – not a good idea. When he reached for the Invisibility Cloak, he hesitated.
“You want a drink, Minerva? Mr Potter and I are having pumpkin juice but it sounds, as if you need something more substantial? Firewhisky, I suggest?”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed, “does it really matter what we think? It won’t change your mind, you are obviously totally convinced that Draco is innocent. Still you know as well as we do that Kingsley and McGonagall have excellent reasons for their suspicions–,“ she raised her hands to stop him, as soon as Harry opened his mouth to argue, “ –no need to repeat what you said yesterday, Harry. Ron and I– we totally agree, Draco’s involvement makes no sense at all.”
And so Harry did. They sat down on the sofa and he told Draco everything beginning with the abduction of Dumbledore’s Imagic at the Ministry archives and Draco’s name enlisted at the registry.
“Ok, so let’s see… what have we got?” Ron rubbed his hands in anticipation, ”I think we should concentrate on the new teachers – hey, we can rule out any teacher, Dumbledore has met while still alive, ‘cause surely he would have given us their name, if he had known them! Harry, you said, the message just reads
“What?” Cass looked confused. “Oh no! That’s no problem at all!” She grinned widely. “I’ve always been out and I certainly don’t want to hide now! Hey, just look at me – don’t you think people will get it no matter what I tell them? Believe me I would go for a different styling, if I wanted to pass as straight.”
Laddley gave him a grateful look. “By the way – I’m very glad you’ve decided to keep up swimming, Mr Potter. It’s such a fine sport! And thanks again for stepping in while I was… indisposed.”
Cass gave Harry a shy look. “Oh well, now you know more about our lot, than you ever wanted to know, I guess. To sum it up– Taurus hexed that painting to impress his sister-in-law. He tried to seduce her again and again… don’t look at me like that, Harry, I saw him groping Aunt Cissy on more than one occasion! She mainly escaped by keeping a maid with her at all times. And my mother just had one miscarriage after the other and pretended not to see, what was going on.”
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “But this is so unfair! I feel really bad about her fate – Dumbledore treating her case and mine so very differently…”
Harry still tried to go on with his decluttering project but gave up any hope of finishing all of the rooms before school started. He decided to be quite content if he got the ground floor done and the one bedroom he had finally chosen for himself, which used to be Regulus’ old room. Sirius’ room still felt burdened by the memories of his godfather’s death and reminded Harry too much of those nights when they were still on the run, of nightmares and unwelcome connections to Voldemort’s mind.
But even without Draco Malfoy his group of friends was different nowadays, Harry had to concede. Six eighth-years amiably walked to the village together – Harry, Ron and Hermione, Dean, Seamus and Neville – but as soon as they arrived at Hogsmeade they split up. First Hermione declared, she wanted to go to Tomes and Scrolls – and Ron immediately agreed to accompany her.
Walburga seemed to have made up her mind. “Cissy, we must be quick, before that Potter-boy interrupts us… I just need to take a step and then…” Harry heard a swash of heavy robes and then her voice trailed off.
