“Why do I have to constantly remind everyone how embarrassing romance is for me,” Harry said. “I will third wheel Ron and Hermione and it will be glamorous and beautiful.”
“I think that’s just his face,” Neville suggested, his hair flopping into his eyes.
“We could have a party,” Draco says ponderously. “Haven’t had a proper party in years.”
“But it won’t work,” Ron adds, delivering the coup de grace. “Because Hermione Granger-Weasley is, as we speak, eviscerating him in front of the whole council and he’s going to lose his nasty little job and probably go to evil wizard jail. Azkaban. Evil wizard jail is just Azkaban.”
“Personally, I suspect Calypso,” Draco says, pointing to a picture of a brown haired witch blithely cuddling what appears to be a full sized wolf. “She supplies the lupine saliva. I’ve been working with her since I opened the shop, but she’s from a weird old pureblood family and I wouldn’t be at all shocked if she was behind something like this.”
“Just wake him up?” Draco asked uncertainly, sneaking another glance at Harry. His skin was illuminated by the lazy flickering of the lightning bugs, candy colors ghosting across his skin.
It occurs to Harry that if Draco is content to boss him around, then maybe he’ll also let Harry be the little spoon when they nap, which brings him such an acute joy that he kisses the only part of Draco’s face he can reach, which is his ear. Draco holding him so tight and so close is doing something very terrible and squishy to his heart, something that he fears maybe be permanent.
“Why does everyone care so much about what I fucking like,” Harry spits, glowering at the far wall, which is blank and white and does nothing to distract him from any of this.
“And Seamus,” Ron conceded, shedding a bit more light on the situation.
Harry hopes that whoever has them trapped in here hasn’t fully taken into account that they have Hermione Granger on their side.
“I have a bunch of his birds charmed over my bed,” Draco said, leaning back against the couch. “He taught us how to make cranes third year, we used to have hundreds flying around the common room. Blaise’s are the best though, he folds them like real songbirds and he can charm them to sing.”
The curtain rustles and Draco appears from behind it, his fingertips dark with grease, undereyes dark with lack of sleep. “Back again.” There’s a tiredness there that wasn’t there when he first started coming, and he hopes it’s the kind that comes with death and not with him.
“You told him I was a werewolf?” Draco interrupts indignantly.
It should have made him nervous and he thought that Hermione wouldn’t like it, but she also didn’t know, didn’t feel the forest underneath her feet. If she felt it, she might understand.
Harry is examining the graffiti on the countertop (a smiley, a shark, what looks like a penis) when he hears the slide of a curtain and a soft, strangled noise. Harry looks up and promptly has to clutch the counter for support because there’s a ghost in the doorway and he knows him.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, his words inadequate. Sorry was seldom enough.
Draco looks at the floor, shuffling his feet. He lets out a sigh like Harry’s being a tax on his emotions. “One of my friends from community service really likes them. She’s a squib but lives as a muggle, does a lot of volunteer work.”
“Oh fuck off,” Harry replies, even though his friends have fallen into something close to domestic bliss. Hermione is coming up on five months pregnant and they already have the baby’s room neatly decorated in yellow and pale green.
Harry finally seemed to notice his hand clasped in Draco’s, and blinked at it in confusion, as if he wasn’t quite sure how it’d gotten there. “Did I...?”
Ron appears from around the corner, already yelling. “Harry! Dara!” He looks for a moment like he’s going to hug them, then seems to think better of it, checking to see that they’re all accounted for before tearing down the hallway towards the stairwell. “Follow me! We’re going to get out of here and then Apparate back to mine so we can get patched up.” Ron holds up his left hand. “You may notice that I, for example, have acquired a broken finger!” Ron’s hand is quite swollen, purple blossoming across his pinkie and ring finger, both of them held at an angle that makes Harry’s stomach turn a little.
Harry doesn’t read it nor does he care to know what it says, but Hermione doesn’t come down for breakfast and so he takes her oatmeal upstairs and finds her weeping in the linen closet.
“You just wait until I retire,” Dara’s saying, her boots squelching in the mud. “I’m going to get my own swamp and you’ll only hear from me on Halloween and Christmas.”
“So I think to myself, who has keys to all of our offices and would want to tamper with Harry and Dara’s werewolf case and I think, oh, of course, that little slug Millence Filbin.”
“You think so?” Luna asks, spooning a bit of the sugary jelly foam off the top of their jelly pot. They’re easily the scariest thing he’s ever seen in an apron, sans maybe Molly Weasley on a holiday.
The smell of the lakewater clogged his nose, almost sweet as it floated up to him, tinged with things he’d never smelled in a lake before. There was treacle tart, warm and nearly physical, an herb he thought he’d smelled in herbology, and the sharp briskness of new fallen snow. There was something unnerving about smelling all of these in the forest, especially one firmly situated in late Autumn.
Whoever it is stops short, the door clattering shut behind them. “Why aren’t you at the party?”
Harry texts him ‘I’d love it back, come to my house’ and regrets his forwardness almost immediately. He doesn’t want Draco to think he’s desperate, even though he knows he is. Wanting to see Draco as much as possible wasn’t such a big deal with when ‘as much as possible’ meant ‘maybe once a week.’
“Thanks anyway though,” Harry replies, and he knows he doesn’t have any excuse to exist here any longer so he trudges out, not minding the rain as it gets in his hair.
“He told me he’d rather die than have me in his head,” Harry says.
Draco just blinks at him for a moment, apparently unfazed. “I’m extremely charming you know, it’s not my fault you never noticed.”
“Keep it up and I’ll let Princess know you think they’re fit,” Harry says, deciding that everyone knowing he’s slept with Draco is at least as embarrassing as the eyes Dara makes at their favorite bartender every time they all go for pints.
“Helga and Godric themselves send their accolades,” Harry says, grabbing his quill and starting in on the mountain of paperwork before them.
“Mmm. Both.”
When Draco saw the figure through the trees he almost called out, assuming it must be Harry in the field of flowers made just for them. He quickened his step, breaking into the clearing only to find Hermione staring at him with a peculiar look on her face.
He sifted through them, through what Draco had said about all versions of him wanting to kiss Harry. That was the most unsettling part, really. It was horrifying to think that he wanted to kiss Draco, but it also came as a sort of begrudging realization, because Draco was attractive if nothing else. The idea that the real Draco might also want to kiss him made his blood freeze.
“Feel like I’m walking into a lion’s den,” Harry mutters, following him inside.
Harry shakes his head. He tries not to let cases get to him like this, but it’s worse when there’s a time limit, worse when it’s something he really cares about. He worries about Bill, he thinks about Lupin, who is gone now. “I just feel like we’re hitting dead ends. What happens if everyone’s potion test comes back okay and we still don’t know why you were targeted? What if everyone’s potions are compromised but not everyone is using the same suppliers?” Draco is looking at him in a strange way again, and it’s making Harry grouchy. “What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
Dara and Harry meet Rob Spreckleroy in what can only be described as a swamp. Dara still has the healing remains of an impressive burn curling down her neck, but she looks remarkably well rested as they take the swaying bridge across a clearwater stream to Rob’s lopsided little cottage.
Even after everything that’s happened, he still likes this one. It tastes like butterbeer and Ginny smells like fresh grass and victory and he’s so proud of everyone his chest is full with it. It feels like it’s supposed to: there’s him and the girl and all his classmates, and nothing has been ruined yet. It’s the sort of memory that will feel good forever, a patronus memory even, one that stays good even after everything around it ceases to exist, just because it existed.
Dara makes a face. “I just wonder about Malfoy. He’s a git. Can’t trust gits.”
He nearly ran into Draco, who was walking in the opposite direction on the path, and when they met the Forest sent a wave of petals so thick they got caught in their hair and flew down their sleep shirts.
“Harry,” he said, testing the word out in his mouth. “Harry wake up.”
“Goodnight.”
they say in his brain like a looping chant, and he feels disgusted and intrigued all at once.
“Yes,” Draco replied, folding his collar down with practiced hands. “Can’t stay here forever, can we?”
Blaise pretended to look offended, though he knew his reputation as well as Draco did. “Fair enough. How about I tell you something about me, barter system style? Then we both have something on each other.”
Draco sighs. “There were a lot of wounds to heal in the manor during the war.”
partner,” Ron says, flicking on the burner and clattering the pan down on the stovetop, before hovering a cutting board and a pile of strawberries in front of Harry. “Cut those, would you?”
66. Harry turns his handkerchief bright red and lays it on his pillow. He doesn’t want to touch it or let it out of his sight. Harry doesn’t know what’s gone wrong and there’s no one left to ask.
“Alright, we’ll do it the hard way,” Ginny turns to the room at large. Sometimes, Ginny is Draco’s favorite. “Who has kissed Ron. Fess up.”
“The only colors I wear are plum, emerald, and neutrals,” Draco replied. “They look good with my skin tone.”
“I think you’re about to,” Draco replied, still slow and sleep heavy.
When he entered the forest that night he registered the spaces between the trees as peculiarly empty, even as the trees reached down to wish him a good night. The paths were simple that night, sending him in slow circles and up small inclines.
“Elbow,” Draco murmured, as Harry ticked her elbow back up and they continued to dance. It should have felt silly, the same moves over and over, and on some level Harry felt completely ridiculous, like she was a parody of someone doing a waltz, but Draco looked so elegant that she didn’t feel entirely like a farce.
Potter’s eyes flick away and it takes all of Draco’s willpower not to tick his chin back up so they’re eye to eye again. Every part of him pouts ‘look at me’ and he counts the times Potter blinks so he won’t act on anything.
“Do you really think we’re complementary?” Draco asks, crossing his legs and refusing to make eye contact. “Or were you just saying that?”
“Of course you were,” Harry replies, keeping his hand around Draco’s forearm as he leads him into the living room. He can pretend it’s for convenience and not because they’re holding hands if he keeps his fingers wrapped loosely around Draco’s wrist.
“Then stop me,” Draco says, aggressive in the small space. “I don’t want to see that.”
“We’re just happy that you’re finally doing something constructive instead of trying to hurt each other,” Pansy says, giving them both a sympathetic smile. “Although Harry, let it be known that if you step out of line I will kill you.”
Malfoy nods, leaning against the counter and looking at the record player. Harry feels a swell of that old irritation, feeling almost annoyed that Malfoy isn’t glaring at him or teasing him or being a miserable shit. He’s given up the game and Harry doesn’t know what to do about it. “Yeah, I can do it now.”
“How do you do it?” Harry asks, because he wants that protection, he wants to be able to keep his mind to himself for once. Not even the threat of Voldemort in his head had been enough to make him good at it, and he’s terrified he’ll never be able to manage.
“Oh no,” Harry says, realization dawning on him. “It was the case equivalent of one of Luna’s crossword puzzles. Multiple intelligences.”
“I want to suck you off, but I’m not doing it in a hallway. You have a bed here. Where is it,” Draco asks. He can’t believe he’s saying any of this, but here he is, being brave again.
“Have we known that?” Draco asks, and then wonders if perhaps he’s protested too much. Luckily, everyone seems to be more interested in agreeing with Blaise, who looks very vindicated. Harry looks as if this is the very first he’s heard of this, and is taking it less like a compliment and more like Blaise has told him they’re cancelling Quidditch.
As it turned out, quite nearly the whole school did know by lunchtime, except for Draco, who didn’t know anything for sure, because he’d been too anxious to leave his room until five minutes before his first class of the morning.
“I thought so too,” Anthony agreed, smiling beatifically.
“At least I’m trying,” Harry replies. “I didn’t throw my cup at the wall and storm out and I was trying to tell you I thought we could work together and you were making it all about how you’re a bad person. I think this would work a lot better if you spent less time fixated on how much of a shite human being you are and more time trying not to be one. Why are you even here?”
“It wasn’t so bad fourth year,” Hermione said entreatingly. “I think it’s a good idea.”
“Why do I think everything you do is hot?” Draco means to think, but accidentally says, which just makes Harry laugh.
Harry sighed, watching him slump off as she entered Advanced DADA and sat with a thump next to Hermione. “I think I just crushed the last of Ernie Macmillan’s will to go on.”
This time, it was Harry, unaware as the snake slunk closer to his feet and bit at him, ruthless as it began to tear him to pieces, methodical and cruel. Draco had tried to warn him, his heavy lungs unmoving as he rasped out a warning too late.
“Hmm?” Harry responds, looking up from the drawing.
“Why would I be afraid of what’s in your head?” Draco asks, looking just the smallest bit caught of guard.
She frowned, looking at him too closely. “What is it?”
Draco shakes his head, closing his eyes and pressing a hand to his mouth. “I said kind of.”
“Yeah, only works sometimes though,” she replies, a scowl in her tone.
He’d only been coming to the forest for a week now but it felt like forever, like the forest was sewing him back up again. Like it was clearing the fog he’d been peering through for ages. He wouldn’t have even questioned it if it weren’t for Malfoy. He felt like the forest must have shoved them together for a reason. Like he was supposed to be doing something.
“Probably a good idea,” Draco says, looking distant. “The Mulcibers were a terrible family.”
“For my Aunt Bella,” he said, the one that rang truest and most heavy with blood.
Sincerely,
“You look like candy floss,” Harry said delightedly, noting Draco’s lipstick, which was a shimmery rose nearly the same shade of her dress. “I think you might glow faintly pink.”
She nodded, a protective glint in her eye. “Take care of him please.”
Potter doesn’t answer for a moment, and Draco makes the mistake of turning to look at him, finding him close enough to inhale.
“Stop!” Draco said, grabbing his arm and holding him fast. “Come with me.”
Luna doesn’t answer right away, just shuffles their papers around and stands to go pour two cups of tea, one of which she places at Harry’s feet. The mug is bright yellow and says ‘Have A Magical Day’ over a cartoon of a bright pink puffskein. It feels vaguely mocking, and Harry glares at it. “It’s not my job to tell his secrets.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, glancing up at the forest in quiet thanks. “You are too. You look less dead over breakfast.”
“Exactly,” Rob says, looking like he likes both of them quite a bit more already, and launches into the rest of the tale, which has at least three twists and a surprise ending.
Two days later, the tv appears in front of his door, repaired and pristine.
The forest laughed at his tone, the undergrowth rustling in amusement. She was enjoying it, loved pushing them together and watching them play off each other, guarded and unexpectedly vulnerable. She could feel them piecing themselves slowly back together under the watchful arms of her magic, fighting her and each other and anything they could get their hands on.
Harry is surprised by how much Draco smells like dirt. He hadn’t remembered Lupin smelling that way. Harry considers that it has something to do with it being nighttime, or that he’s been up for so long, or that Draco is stark naked in the middle of Muggle London. Harry doesn’t know why that would make him smell like dirt, but Draco’s extremely visible arse is making him feel a little panicky and he’s out of explanations.
The door unlocks for him, and Harry, feeling foolish now that he’s arrived, takes the stairs up to Draco’s flat. Draco looks entirely too put together for so early in the morning, waiting in his doorway as Harry comes to the landing. Harry feels acutely that he looks like he just stopped an international dragon smuggling ring and then spent the entire rest of the night taking victory shots at the pub and Draco is his usual immaculate self. Draco is looking at him in a way that he doesn’t know how to parse, and Harry looks down at his feet so he doesn’t have to meet Draco’s gaze.
“You always push things,” Draco said, standing up with a sigh. She looked tired, tired like it was beyond her body and into her heart too. “Maybe I don’t want to be friends with you. Maybe you can’t just be friends with everyone.”
“Thank you Blaise,” Draco says. Blaise begins another sentence with “and also more than talented at-“ which Draco nips in the bud by throwing a pig in a blanket at the back of his head.
Draco, at his glance, lets his face fall expressionless, his voice clicking right back into his old drawl, his head at a tilt like a cat and his eyes hard as flint. “Did you have something you were trying to say, Potter?”
“Lee.”
“Where are we? How long have you been awake?”
“I’m not staring,” Harry says, even though he is. “I’ll keep my eyes on my menu for the rest of breakfast if that makes you feel better.”
“The flower code. He told me about it. Each flower means something.” Harry stares at his screen, scrolling until he reaches the Gs. “Comfort. That’s what Red Geraniums mean.”
“Well that’s too bad,” Draco replies, his stare challenging. “Because I do like you. So. That’s that.”
“Pansy,” Draco replies with a shrug. “You convince her to like you.”
It’s written in a tight, nervous scrawl, and Harry pictures Draco pacing in his shop, fussing distractedly with a potion while he waits. Harry and the rest of the Aurors have the day off so they can catch up on sleep after the sting, but he knows from experience that going to bed now will just mean staring at his ceiling for another few hours. He dithers on the doorstep before grabbing his broom from the entryway and heading back out into the chill, cloudy morning, a breeze whipping his hair as he pushes off. Even as he flies towards Draco's flat, he's vaguely aware that he has no real reason to go there.
“Thanks,” he replies, sliding around the counter and heading for the door. Harry gives Belinda a wave as they leave, following Draco out onto the sidewalk, shivering in the chill November wind.
“Sounds good.” Harry shook out her stiff arms, going to get herself a hair tie. It was only after she’d pulled her hair back that she glanced at Draco, who was standing by the windowsill again, her forehead pressed to the glass.
Draco raises his eyebrows, making an insolent face. “Feisty.”
“Done,” Harry says. “Tufty.”
“Well, anyway, enjoy your shirt,” Draco says offhandedly, then grimaces. “Fuck I’m dreadful at this.” He does an awkward little wave, trying to slide back out the door. “I suppose I’ll see you around then, when you have time to stop by the-”
Blaise had brought caviar and crème fraîche tartlets and Ginny had brought pigs in a blanket, and Draco found that if he alternated bites of them he could reach something close to bliss. He’s just taken a bite of tartlet when he hears the siren call of what he would recognize at fifty paces as gossip.
“Done,” Draco says finally, a hand pushing his face from one side to the other like he's being examined.
“I don’t think the plebeian lexicon has provided an adequate label for our situation,” Draco replied dryly. “Not enemies, not friends.”
“If you can perfect the under-arm turn by the end of the lesson I’ll tell you,” Draco said finally, like she thought the entire prospect unlikely.
When Harry finally looks over to find the clock reading just past five, he’s struck by how much it feels as if they’ve been here forever, that this room and Draco are the only things there are. That’s probably part of the training, but it’s still unsettling.
“Eight thirty,” Draco said, glancing up at the clock. “Guess we’re free.”
“Correct,” Draco replied with a glare, pushing Harry into the first steps of the waltz without any warning. She had her right side pressed firmly up to Harry’s in a way that Anthony certainly hadn’t done and Harry found herself tripping over own feet.
“I’m kind of in love with you too,” Harry says. He isn’t quite sure how it happened, but it’s definitely true.
“There’s no long game!” Draco protests. “She’s tiny! Practically a dust mite!”
“Were you looking for me?” Malfoy says, and it sounds accusatory but there’s something light behind it, like genuine curiosity.
“Oh my god?” Harry says, aware that at some point Draco has started supporting a fair amount of his weight.
“It’s a muggle book,” Harry replied.
“Potter,” he begins. He can do this. If there’s anything Malfoys are good at, it’s high stakes social rituals. “May I kiss you.”
Harry stifles a laugh when Draco loses track of his balance and nearly keels over into the siding of the nearby house. Draco looks at him like if he laughs again it’ll be his last time doing so, so he schools his face back into seriousness.
“I think it’s a Ravenclaw thing,” Harry said. “‘Going way too hard’ is practically their house motto.”
“I don’t really want to play games right now,” Draco said tiredly, turning around with a flip of his cape. He was in his neatly pressed school uniform, the pajamas he sometimes wore conspicuously absent.
“Gordon and Potter: freaks in the streets, but not in the sheets. Sheets as in paper. Paperwork.” She slides off his desk, returning to hers and placing both of her boots on its scuffed surface.
Draco watches him with his sharp gray eyes. “I know,” he says, and then, “Thank you.”
“Why won’t you let me help you!” Harry shot back, getting up as well.
It felt so real, every bit of skin warm and soft underneath his hands. In the daylight it hadn’t seemed so dire, touching another person and knowing it wasn’t any better than his imagination.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled insolently, sticking her elbow back up, only to have Draco shove it level to the ground. “Can you not fucking manhandle me?”
“I can, if you don’t want to.” Ron offered, but Harry shook his head.
Harry freezes, hoping that he doesn’t look too comical. “Because I break things?”
“Why not?” Draco asks.
Harry scoffs, letting out a quick, angry laugh. “You know I slept in a cupboard, right?”
“It’s really intuitive, it’s like a puzzle,” Draco begins, his fingers worrying the hem of his jumper. He has a lot of nervous ticks now: feeling the hems of his shirts, touching his hair, running his fingers over the Mark. It’s kind of sweet to watch, like he’s trying to comfort himself. ’“One of the girls I met doing community service had one, she taught me the basic stuff. That’s how I got the job here.”
“And for the things I said about you,” Draco added, even though she was something foreign and beyond him. She was still a better witch than he’d been a wizard, still more worthy of Harry. He thought maybe that had been some of why he’d always found it so easy to hate her. “And to you.”
Draco went to drop Harry’s hand but found it being squeezed back, Harry blinking up at him in the low light, his eyes the same green as the forest leaves.
“You aren’t going to tell,” she said shrewdly.
Harry stood where Draco had left her, feeling very silly and very sorry for herself. She thought maybe she should vacate the dance floor, but Malfoy was cross with her again and quite a few people were watching her and so she thought the best course of action would be to stand there until she dissolved or the world swallowed her up.
Draco stirs. The dirt smell hits Harry again, stronger this time, something almost like cloves in it. He wonders exactly how long Draco has been a werewolf. He feels like he should have been told or maybe sensed it intuitively. It’s possible that Draco had even been a werewolf back when they were sleeping together and that he hadn’t had any idea. That he could have missed such a crucial detail makes him feel strange, like a staircase with one more step than you’re expecting.
Draco nods. “Practice.”
“You can get yarn from alpacas and angora rabbits as well,” Hermione said, her needles stilling. Blaise was examining the stitching on the mitten he’d been given with interest, holding his mittened hand up to the light to get a better look.
“Probably not,” Harry said with a laugh, looking around at those dancing, drinking, or just standing around smiling. She even spotted a few Ravenclaws who seemed fairly unperturbed by their loss, including Anthony who was chatting with Seamus over by the punch.
Draco blanched, peach pit hard in his hand. “I don’t hate them, you know.”
“Kiss me again to be sure,” Harry says, kissing Draco’s temple, along his cheek, his mouth. Draco is so endlessly warm and sure in all the places he’s touching Harry, something certain in his movements that Harry wouldn’t have expected and doesn’t remember being true before. “Come home with me,” he says, and Draco is nodding, kissing him, and nodding again.
The apartment is silent around them and he can hear them both breathing, the quiet movements of their lips and he can’t pretend that this is anything other than what it is. There’s the knowledge that this is wrong, that it ruins everything, and then there’s the way that Draco holds him a little too tight like he’s afraid he’ll get away, the way that Harry feels safe for once.
“She is put together,” Draco replies, and Harry knows there’s something under that but he doesn’t think Draco is going to let him see it. “Your tv is fixed.”
Harry’s mop of hair is at Draco’s touch height, and he finds himself with his hands buried in Harry’s curls. Harry lets his eyes go a little closed as Draco plays with his hair, a far too familiar gesture for the amount of time they’ve been making out, which is about fifteen minutes total.
“I’ll have Circe’s Skillet,” Harry says.
In order to lead Draco to his bedroom, which has clothes all over the floor and an absolutely bizarre collection of items on every surface, Harry has taken him by the hand. He’s done it very casually and possessively and it’s doing a very evil, twisty thing to Draco’s heart.
Draco flushed a pink quite a bit softer than the cloak had been, thrusting her chin high to try and trying to sound prim. “It was my favorite color.”
And yet, stranger still was that it had worked, that Malfoy had stormed out instead of laughing in his face. He wonders, with a sharp, sharp stab of panic, if it hadn’t just been the revulsion he’d picked up on, but jealousy too.
Harry can’t tell if Belinda knows this is all an elaborate excuse or if he’s just being paranoid. “I’ll take a look at it,” she says kindly, and he nods.
“Oh,” Draco says, looking surprised and quite pleased. “Are you really?”
“I am really sorry, about everything. I know I did so many unspeakable things,” Draco begins, both hands cupping his glass. “I didn’t see any way out. You can’t possibly imagine how much I hated myself by the end.” He glances over at Harry. “Well, perhaps you can.”
“Pansy has been pestering me about a ministry position for years,” Draco confirms. “I think she’s used the words ‘real job’ about twenty times. Like anyone there would respect me, I’d be doing menial bullshit until I fucking died.”
As Harry runs his preliminary survey of the wards, he’s pleasantly impressed to find that Draco had been right about their quality. The spellwork is clever and layered, filled with evil little traps and switchbacks, and their threads indicate to him everyone who’s passed through them over the course of the month in a slow trickle of detailed information. Harry is particularly impressed by a trap door charm that sends any wood-be burglar down into a crevice where they’ll be very stuck until rescued.
“You’re not turning into my dad, are you?” Ron asks, peering in from the kitchenette.
There’s something cheerful and pop-y playing and he has to smile at the thought of Malfoy working dourly as it plays. Malfoy sets the tv up on an enormous wooden table in the middle, scrawling out a Post-It Note and sticking it to the top of the tv.
Draco shakes his head. “Not exactly. There’s a thing called a flower press, if you put flowers between the pages the flowers flatten and dry out so you can use them for stuff.”
“I wish I hadn’t kissed you,” Draco says, more to himself than to Harry. It hurts, even though Harry would much rather pretend it didn’t make him feel anything. “I don’t need to be your experiment after all of the shit we’ve done.”
By the time he strides into his office, he’s decided to try and have a sense of humor about the whole Daily Prophet thing, something he’s had quite a bit of practice with considering that the Prophet has been running annoying, mostly-false stories about him for his entire living memory.
“Okay,” Harry says, because Draco is right, even though he can’t quite believe it. Doing the right thing is pretty much his entire bit, even when that means helping Draco, who is, most dreadfully, hot now. “What do you think is going on?”
“You’re different this time,” Harry said, bemused.
“Sorry,” Harry replies.
“How many little white furry things died to make that coat, one or two?” Harry asked Ron, not entirely expecting a response.
Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, Newt Scamander
“Oh, of course,” Connie says. She doesn’t seem to be as affected by the unnatural heat, and Harry can feel his dislike of her quickly mounting as he tries to discreetly daub sweat from his forehead. “She had on one of those big pink hats, the new ones from Madam Malkins, maybe you’ve seen them?”
“Your crepes show it.”
Addressed To:
Draco places his hand very delicately on his chest, his other hand holding his cushion protectively. “Me? Surely not.”
Draco is suddenly looking a lot less assured, particularly for someone actively bringing himself off. “I can’t tell if you’re threatening me or propositioning me.”
“You could have just cast a Reparo. I thought the record player was a coincidence, lord knows you have no idea how that works. It wouldn’t have worked on the radio, it wasn’t broken, you’re just ridiculous, but you broke this one.” He pauses, purses his lips and gives Harry a searching look. “On purpose.”
Draco nods. “It seemed to get harder for me, as if every time I saw him he’d gotten worse, more horrible. He reminded me of the dementors, sometimes I couldn’t completely tell the difference.”
At this juncture, Ron has put on the wizard wireless, Pansy keeps finding new things to scream about, and Luna is holding one of Draco’s hands very gently in theirs, telling him something about his aura. Draco is trying very, very hard not to look at Harry. If he looks at Harry, he is terrified he’s going to kiss him again. He has so little self control to begin with and he doesn’t think, slightly absinthy, he will be able to resist.
When he entered, the Forest sent a rush of warmth to greet him, a wave of rosy affection down from the waving branches. The air felt thick and summery, tiny blue flowers sending petals down like a rainshower, and Draco felt comforted in the knowledge that at least he hadn’t ruined everything.
She nodded, giving the three Slytherins a wave goodbye as she turned to head back down the hallway. Harry watched Draco, who looked both fond and bemused as she followed them down the stairs, Greg and Pansy trailing slightly behind her.
The moment stretched and moved, a few people sniffling as the weight settled around them.
Dara looks venomous. “Won’t even know what hit ‘em,” she says. “Might help us figure out where the fuck we are.”
“And shit at sucking dick,” Blaise amends, which Draco would find less personally embarrassing if Harry wasn’t still looking at him like he’s been involved in something very charming.
“Great. See you soon. When you have case updates.” Draco says, leaning against the counter as Jasmine gives him a cheerful wave and goodbye. As the door closes behind him, he hears Draco say “Not. A. Word.” to Jasmine, which he decides not to read into.
“If you’re buying,” Draco says, which is a little ridiculous considering that Draco is, historically, quite rich. Harry is also historically quite rich, but Draco has been much more of a cunt about it.
“Should we do it now?” He’s not sure either of them are up for a fight, but maybe that’s the point. Draco looks almost excited, despite how exhausted he’d looked earlier.
“Well you clean up decently,” Draco says, giving Harry an appraising look that lingers on his hair. “Perhaps we should have gotten you a hat.”
“Well I was thinking, maybe, since we’re in different houses and it would still be inter house unity, I could switch partners? Just to help out? Maybe?” Harry offered, forcing herself to power through despite attracting the attention of most of the room as well as McGonagall’s piercing stare.
Harry didn’t stir, and Draco reached out tentatively to touch him, his hand hovering at Harry’s shoulder before settling on his hand. Draco took it, twining his fingers through Harry’s and wiggling them slightly.
“Hope you’re daydreaming us a suspect,” she says. “Though you’re shit at divination, aren’t you?”
Draco rolls his eyes, moving the record player over to the finished area. “She’s exceedingly lovely, I’m not surprised.”
“You sound like Hermione,” Harry says, straddling his broom. “We’re hoping to question Rob tomorrow. Hopefully that’ll help us piece everything together.”
As Anthony was guiding Harry back towards the other side of the room, she managed to catch Ernie’s eye and shoot him the best sympathetic look she could, hoping that one of his housemates would help him loosen up.
Draco Malfoy found sleep just as easily, and also found dreams. He was no stranger to dreams, especially not in the months after the war where he’d been plagued by snakes that tried to snap at his hands and curl around his middle until he couldn’t breathe, running away from unknown terrors, and walls that closed on him. This dream was different; it was barely even a dream, more a soft sensation of warmth and arms around him.
“So you’ve said,” Harry says, trailing Draco out of the room and to the dormitory, where he strips out of his pajama top and rifles through his trunk for his robes, tugging them over his head and messing up his hair again.
His favorite part about the forest was that inside there was nothing to hurt, nothing to crush, and there was power that walked right into his fingertips. He thought, wandering around the paths that night, that being in the forest itself was power, was control and banishing fear. The forest didn’t care what kind of half-monster he might have been.
“It’s nice out here,” Potter says, and his voice sounds so different without all the malice in it. It’s like he has a whole new voice that Draco hasn't heard before. Truthfully, Potter might not know what Draco’s real voice sounds like either, but it probably doesn’t matter to him so much.
“Probably not,” Hermione replied. “But who knows, I guess we’ll just have to wait until next week.”
Draco looks affronted, which Harry should have expected. “Are you quite finished insulting my spellwork, or did you have more you wanted to say?”
He reaches for the dart full of antidote they’d shot into Draco’s shoulder, easing it out and bagging it up for evidence, trying to make his glances strictly clinical. Even passed out on the ground, Draco looks tired, his terribly pink mouth slightly open, the line of his jaw as sharp and unforgiving as it had been under Harry’s hands.
The way he says it makes Harry suddenly understand, want to laugh until he cries. “Rock paper scissors,” he says.
On three, Harry casts, sending everyone flying backwards for a radius of thirty feet. There’s a moment of shock and then pandemonium, but they’re already pelting towards the door, and have made it out into the cloudy morning and Apparated before anyone else gets their hands on them. They all land in a heap on Hermione and Ron’s doorstep, then bang their way inside, warding the door shut behind them.
Luna invited Pansy and Blaise as well but only 2/3 of them went. Draco would be more angry about Pansy’s absence if he hadn’t watched her have a panic attack for fifteen minutes after receiving the invitation, the aftershocks of which lasted about three hours.
“That’s awesome,” Harry says when he finds his voice, folding his letter back up and setting it on the ramshackle letter holder, a useful relic from their Great Grimmauld Place Attic Clean. “You guys are great, she’s fantastic at defensive spells.”
“That sounds-” Harry stumbles over his words, still so unaccustomed to the way Draco has seemed to slide into muggle life, even as Harry is so alienated from both worlds. Draco’s good at everything and that shouldn’t be as surprising as it is. “It sounds really lovely, actually.”
“Cupboard makes it sounds so dramatic,” Draco said, sure that though Harry probably hadn’t grown up in a bedroom quite as sprawling as the one of his own childhood, everyone must have been exaggerating. He’d always wanted to ask him about it, but it wasn’t the sort of thing you asked a boy who didn’t speak to you in anything other than insults.
“All the particulars,” Jasmine says, watching him wade through the warding spells. “We also had an impromptu defense class this morning and he taught me this sick slug vomiting hex. And some other stuff, but that was the highlight.”
“Okay,” Harry replied, feeling like she’d been punched in the gut even though Draco hadn’t even touched her. Try to be nice. Try to be nice. “I want that too. Do you think, maybe you could try and not bite my head off in the process?”
“Are you sure you really hate her, Harry?” Hermione asked, her quill finally stilling, so Harry knew it was serious.
“Mostly sober Harry thinks it’s a great idea,” Harry said, while Seamus pretended to swoon. “And this way, no can pressure me into actually asking a girl.”
Draco wants to tease him for being so needy, but he can’t seem to figure out how to stop kissing him. Draco maneuvers his hand so he can hold himself up and still play with Harry’s curls, which feels like the most urgent priority somehow, second only to touching his dick. Draco is unbelievably aware of the fact that Harry still has a steady hand on his waist, which is maybe the hottest part of the whole thing.
Draco looks up at him with a bloody grin, letting Harry haul him up as they’re approached from all sides by security wizards. Draco slides behind him so they’re standing back to back, firing off spells at the opposition. Harry can see Ron and Dara to their left doing the same, and is pleased to see that Dara has somehow got her hands on a wand and is doling out hexes with impressive gusto.
“That’s right,” Rob says. “You can come in, but I have some very important tadpoles I need to babysit later today, so I can’t be long.” Rob jimmies open the door to his cottage, holding it to reveal a cozy interior that feels like the slightly damper version of Hagrid’s hut. Rob gestures to a set of bright green wooden chairs, settling into one of his own.
There is something in wondering if your not-lover is going to murder you.
“My what?”
“Put makeup on me?” Harry glances at Draco’s lips and his hand and the unreadable shine of his gray eyes. “I’ve never done it before.”
Harry nods, willing himself not to think it’s a date. It’s very obviously a business meeting, the actual opposite of a date, but his brain keeps going ‘date?’ without his permission. Sitting across from Draco now, he feels a little foolish for being so terrified to bring him here, like he’d expected Draco to snap and start dramatically performing the time Harry fell from his broomstick third year.
“A surprisingly forward-thinking offering from Filbin. Last time he asked me if I had any experience with ‘rashes.’ Not any particular rash. Just in general,” Dara says. “And the kicker is that as the proud owner of a toddler, I do have experience with rashes, but you know what? Not for Goat Cheese Filbin.”
“You’ll forgive my skepticism,” Harry says. “You’re not the first person to tell me that and be wrong.”
“I will if you unclench your asshole for two seconds,” Harry bit back, and Draco’s hand tightened on hers in what appeared to be a violent twitch.
“You weren’t interested in him were you?” Draco asks carefully, and Harry doesn’t know what the correct answer is. Somehow an outright no feels like a lie.
“Merlin,” Draco said with a sigh, arranging them into waltzing position. “Are you ready or do you have a few more lame jokes to crack?”
“Is there a possibility that I can stay up here forever instead of going downstairs and having the most awkward confrontation imaginable?” Draco asks, when what he’s really asking is if he can stay the night. He knows if he stays the night he’s going to be in love with Harry forever, but he’s very concerned that at some point that has already happened. Draco doesn’t think that Harry is in love with him yet, but he thinks they’ve made astoundingly good progress for one night.
“So what is her favorite color?”
He thought Draco was lovely too, caught on the intensity in his eyes and the bare skin of his neck and his long fingers, but he was beyond saying it. Draco would probably snarl at him if he did, so he focused on the feelings building in his stomach and tried to feel all of Draco at once.
“We should start looking into this as soon as possible. Would you be able to file the official report in the morning?”
“That’s what all future ministers say,” Ron counters, and Harry raises his glass in agreement. Hermione shushes both of them, but there’s a pleased blush to her cheeks and they all know she loves it.
Harry almost mockingly makes the sound back to him out of habit, but at the last moment reminds himself that he’s trying to be civil. Instead, he gives the menu a perfunctory examination, folding it back up almost immediately. He’s come here after shifts often enough that he practically knows it by heart.
“I was wondering if there was even the smallest chance you could volunteer to be my dance partner,” Ernie said. “It’s still inter-house unity and I think if you offered, McGonagall might not say no.”
“Yikes,” Ron said, still staring up at the ceiling as Harry buried his face in Ron’s covers. They smelled like Ron and The Burrow and were comforting even as his hands stubbornly shook. “You wanna talk about it?”
Harry tries to find his words back and but can’t seem to find the right ones. “I can’t begin to figure you out.”
Draco, for the first time, smiles. “Me too.”
“Your flat’s nice,” Draco says when they get in, Harry turning on the kitchen light and clicking the kettle on. Harry shrugs, getting a mug down for himself as Draco hoists himself on the counter, crossing his legs primly in front of him. “Aren’t you going to make a cup for me?”
Draco suspected, though he wouldn’t have let it slip to anyone, that his mysterious affliction was a result of the kiss. As he curled up in his thick, emerald blankets he wondered what the physical effects were of kissing a mirage, if he’d caught some odd kind of cold.
“I did also think you were evil and conniving,” Harry says, raising his eyebrows so it’s a challenge. They’re talking and it’s incredibly bizarre, but it feels right somehow, like they’ve healed some of the rift between them.
“You’re perfect for each other, really,” Luna replies. “Gemini and Leo is a very interesting combination, you balance very well.”
Draco reaches over to squeeze Harry’s hand, and he registers that they’re both equally nervous, which is the farthest thing from comforting.
This is the only level of conversation that Draco is going to be able to sustain for the rest of the party. “What else is it telling you?” He asks Luna, determined to prolong this as long as he can, when he, mistake of all mistakes, glances over at Harry.
“I said getting along, I didn’t say friends,” Harry said, feeling triumphant. “Unless you want to be friends.”
Harry just stares at him for a long moment, feeling like a deer caught in the headlights.
“Maybe I’ve outgrown petty insults, Malfoy,” Harry said tiredly.
“Maybe I will,” Draco says cooly, and Harry feels like he’s being punished for something, even though its not like he’s done anything but lose. He wonders if maybe this is the reprieve for the sharp sting of Draco’s repulsion, a comeuppance for lingering in the warmth of the kiss with Ginny.
Harry pushed through two Hufflepuff boys making eyes at each other to sling her arms around both of their shoulders. “Hello, my favorite boys!”
“You look tired, I don’t know, you haven’t been-” Haven’t been looking at me across the Great Hall. “I just wanted to be nice, alright?” Harry looked resolutely back down at the grass, feeling a bit stupid. He’d never actually tried being nice to Draco in real life, and realized belatedly that he had no idea how it would actually go. Draco had extended an offer of friendship first, but that had been years ago, years full of taunting and fighting.
Harry sits there, feeling as if he’d been recently dragged from the bottom of a especially discomforting lake. Finally, when he can think of nothing else to do, he gathers his things and Floos home, the workday barely half over.
He can’t imagine that this is why she died for him, that she wanted him to be like this. He does not know where the better love is hiding; he has been searching too long for Draco Malfoy.
“You don’t have to indulge an old woman’s fancies,” Draco replies harshly, and Harry knows it’s a front, because Draco’s nerves make sense now. He wasn’t just afraid that Narcissa wouldn’t like Harry, he’d been afraid that Harry wouldn’t like Narcissa, that he’d see the way she’d cobbled together something like a new life out of pride and the pieces of her old one and wouldn’t want to stay.
“All in good fun,” Harry agreed with a conspiratorial laugh.
Draco doesn’t answer, but he kisses Harry’s cheeks, the bridge of his nose, the back of his closed eyelids. Harry can feel him shaking, has felt him shaking since the first time they touched.
“I just wanted to say goodbye,” Harry said, forcing himself to look at Draco’s face, forcing himself to know it wasn’t really him.
Around them, other couples got into position and Draco held up her arms. “Ready?”
“Not that my romantic entanglements are any of your business...” Draco replies, eyebrows high on his forehead. Harry feels a little like he’s been chastised, but it doesn’t sting so he doesn’t mind. “But no. No proper boyfriends.”
Harry doesn’t know how true that would be, but he knows better than anyone how deep prejudices run. “This works for you somehow.”
“I smell nice,” Harry protests, trying to correct her posture and feeling like a class act idiot. “You’re a nightmare.”
“Of course it matters,” Harry said, the truth shattering all the pretenses he’d put up, all the pretending he’d done. “What happens in the forest matters in real life. I can’t just kiss you and then go home and have it be okay. I still carry it. I carry it everywhere, I can’t just have it not matter.”
“You don’t happen to know how Luna got those beads on there, do you?” Hermione asked Neville, tapping the beadwork on his gloves. “I’ve been thinking about trying to do something like that but I can’t imagine how.”
“Maybe,” Harry says. “Won’t know until we pay him a visit.”
Draco nearly chokes on his wine. “That’s because you walk around looking like this all the time.” He furrows his brow, frowning with a vengeance.
“Smells great,” Harry says, dropping into a stool and pillowing his head in his arms. “Is there an open burner?”
“Very impressive,” Hermione said. “Knitting aside, getting it up there must have been a nightmare.”
“It takes time,” Harry says. “My friend Hermione got turned into a cat once and that lasted ages.”
Harry faked a coughing fit, spitting out Slytherin in the middle.
Pansy and Hermione exchange a look and Pansy elaborates. “Well for one, I talked to Belinda yesterday and she had some interesting information for me. For another, you were suspiciously cheerful in your denial of my offer to set you up on a date with that delightful reporter boy.”
“I don’t want to cast it.”
She nodded. “No I know, I just-” she seemed to run out of things to say and bit her lip instead.
They remain in that quiet bubble of summertime until Harry hears the roll of the Dursley’s tires and all of the warmth begins to seep out of him with a fearful kind of dread. It’s not a beautiful memory anymore and Harry feels himself being tugged out. He’s dragged up from the depths, back to the surface where he hasn’t stepped foot in that yard in years, where he doesn’t feel so desperately lonely.
“Well why else would you be wandering around the Forbidden Forest at night?” the snake asked, slithering up closer with careful slowness. “Don’t worry, little one, don’t worry. Just follow me.”
“Oh it was. I can’t imagine how much I would have enjoyed it if it were someone else’s life,” Draco says, sounding sheepish but not sorry. “By the time I figured out what I liked, the war was in full swing. Not much time for boyfriends.”
He waits for Potter to go away. He waits eight whole seconds and then sighs when he hears Potter move forward in three quick strides like he’s been steeling himself and then sit down next to him on the porch. Potter leans back and their shoulders brush and this was not in Draco’s stupid plan at all.
“Impermeable,” Draco says, holding his tea cup, which has jackalopes printed around the rim, very close to his chest. “I’m alerted if anyone even tries to get in.”
“No Quidditch if I’m injured though,” Harry replied. “I see you trying to get me out of the game, Goldstein.”
“Well then what’s the problem?” Harry snarled, prodding his wand towards Draco’s chest, wishing it would be over, that he could go back to bed and sleep and be okay again. That he could undo completely, stay here with the mirage and let that be the only thing left. “I’m sorry I even tried to say goodbye,” he said, turning on his heel to leave.
“I want you too,” Draco said, mumbled into the skin of Harry’s neck, every part of him wishing he could run away but unable to slip out of Harry’s hands. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been held like he was something precious.
“This is how Slytherins express love,” Draco offers. “Blaise, tell them I’m a good kisser.”
“She’s lovely,” Harry says. “It was lovely.”
A smile flickers across Draco’s face. “The Slytherin Common room was my favourite, everyone would lay out on the floor and do their homework right before exams and the seventh years would bring everyone treats and help you if you needed.”
“Did you want to have a talk with Ron Weasley in your boxers and my tee shirt?” Harry snips back, face heating at the image. They both know exactly it would have looked like and what it almost was.
“I know,” Harry said. “I can feel my blood pumping in my ears.”
“It’s just you, maybe,” Harry says, then cringes. “I don’t know, it feels better if it’s just you. I don’t know.”
Hypocritically,
“I work in a muggle shop,” Draco replies, refusing to meet his eyes. His eyelashes aren’t long but they curl just a bit at the end, soft and dark blonde. “Do you really think I’m out for anything?” He pauses and Harry waits for him to speak again. “I’m just trying to be like, myself or something.”
“This was a really nice idea,” Harry said, looking around at everyone smiling and glittering. “I definitely wasn’t into it at first, but it’s nice to see everyone out.”
“I don’t care about being minister, I can do so much more in the Muggle Relations branch,” Hermione replies, swirling her wine around and frowning when Ron puts his feet on the coffee table.
“Did you want my pants?” Harry asks, and Draco gives him a look that could kill a small animal. “That’s what I thought.”
“Would you like me to try?” Draco replies, and he almost looks devious, eyebrows creeping up his forehead, his mouth quirked.
“Someone will miss us.”
None of this is new anymore.
They’re being too careful with each other, and though Harry thinks it enough times, Draco never comments on it, because then they might have to face the consequences. Harry still hasn’t asked Draco if he should take a turn casting and he almost doesn’t want to. He doesn’t know what he’ll do when he has to look Draco in the face and know all his secrets. He wants them, wants them desperately, but he doesn’t want the reality of them.
Harry nods enthusiastically and Pansy looks more lost than he’s ever seen her. Standing here with both of them is odd, the knowledge of all the things they did and didn’t do weighing heavy in the air. He wonders if they have nightmares like he does, if they regret choosing the wrong side and if they regret it for the right reasons. He hopes they do, but he’s always had too much faith in people.
Harry nods, because he had to say it, even though he knew Draco would shake his head and tell him no. He supposes they’ll never know how it would have been different, never be able to go back again and save each other. He knows his eleven year old self wouldn’t believe any of this, because Draco was just as awful as Harry was oblivious, but they’re both wiser now.
“You could practice the pushing me out part,” Draco says, looking sorry again. “I’ll cast and I’ll hold and you can push me out. I won’t try to push back again-” He hovers on the edge of that sentence. “I promise.”
“You’re not just ‘boys,’ Potter,” Draco says, his hand still curled over Harry’s shoulder. “And you’re the one who’s leaving lip marks on me.”
Draco’s smile shrank, his face going colder, and Harry wished in that instant that he’d played along and he’d called Malfoy names like they were third years and Draco was his enemy and not an ex Death Eater he’d watched fall from grace.
“There was a snake,” Harry began, his forehead crinkling, and Draco felt the way that Harry spoke to him high in his throat, talking to him like he was an ally in that sylvan maze. Like Draco was one of his confidantes, friends, even. “It told me something about darkness?”
“C’mon Malfoy, you’re stunned, not dead,” Harry mutters. He gives Draco a gentle push on the shoulder in much the same way that he would nudge something he suspected might explode.
Harry moves to stand beside him, sticking his hands in the pockets of his jacket. “Pansy owled Hermione yesterday. Apparently we’re worrying them.”
“I don’t want to have a secret relationship,” Harry replies, unable to meet his gaze. “I don’t think I can do that, it’s not fair.”
“Mother sent me chocolates, would you like one?”
Condemned,
Draco could feel drowsiness creep up on him and knew the forest was trying to pull them apart again, send him to sleep and take Harry back.
They fall into silence, and Harry tries not to be obvious that he’s staring. He just wants to kiss him, because with Draco’s mouth on his there’s no question of whether or not Draco really wants him.
“Okay 1. Posture. Terrible. 2. Elbows don’t point at the floor. 3. Don’t lean into me, I’m sure you smell awful.” Draco said, the list falling smoothly from her mouth.
“Was she someone you recognized?” Harry asks, and Connie shakes her head. “Would you mind giving us a thorough description of what she looked like and what she was wearing?”
Draco blinked up at him, looking uncomfortable and distressed on the old rickety bench. The trees in the courtyard had dropped much of their leaves, only a few red and yellows stragglers remaining on their branches. Harry wondered what season was Draco’s favorite. He hadn’t asked him the night before. He wondered if real Draco and forest Draco would say the same thing.
“Good luck,” Harry replies, turning to Draco who’s petting the shoulder of a bemused black haired boy. “Ready to go, Draco?”
“Oh, no, no you got most of it,” Harry says. He knows he should look away before Draco stands up, but he doesn’t, just watches as Draco dries his face with a dish towel, scrubbing his hair back with his free hand and standing tiredly in the kitchen, staring back at Harry. Ron has his back to both of them and is humming, the radio still going, and Harry knows somehow that he’s not turning around on purpose. Draco won’t break his gaze, his eyes gray and still wild and maybe a little sad, and Harry is waiting for him to say whatever it is he’s going say, but he just deflates a little, tossing the tea towel onto the table. “I’m. I’m going to go outside.”
“Did you learn to dance?” Hermione asked, darting her eyes down to her work and back up again as Harry took the place next to her on the couch.
“And I’m glad you’re not such a fucking tosser anymore.” Harry chances.
“Dara,” he says finally. “I’m begging. I would rather rot in here for the literal rest of my life than listen to you continue to kick that wall.”
“Oh, I do,” Jasmine says, the effect not dulled even by the fact that her feet don’t touch the floor in the seat she’s sitting in.
“Of course you aren’t a bad person,” Harry replies, because war changes people. Harry knows that.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Leave it to the Weasley’s.”
Draco groans, reaching a hand up to pinch off the blood and then yelping when he realizes his nose is in fact, potentially broken. “Will someone fix me,” he says. “Whenever someone has a minute. At your convenience, really.”
“He’s fit for a dude,” Dara says. “Pretty. I’m not blaming you for sleeping with him, I’m just saying.”
“Well it can’t be that common,” Harry shoots back. “Maybe it is, I don’t know.”
“I’m sure you did not, Ms. Malfoy,” McGonagall said evenly, turning to correct Paavan’s form.
Draco nods, taking a sip. He’s sitting very still but somehow he doesn’t look calm. Harry is reminded of animals playing dead or cats freezing before they strike, he’s not sure exactly which. “It was a three cup day, but I only had time for two at home.”
Draco shrugged, watching the lines of Harry’s arms and the quirk of his mouth and resting in the familiarity of it. This was really Harry, the one he’d known all his life, real and solid in front of him, letting himself be teased. “I don’t make the rules.”
“Thanks,” he said, giving Draco a peculiar look.
Harry thought about saying that he’d missed him, but he didn’t think that would go over very well at all, so he just settled on nodding.
It’s not until after he’s fled the gym barefoot that he realizes its barely afternoon.
“I can’t think of any other way to talk to you,” Draco said finally. “How are you supposed to talk to people who aren’t friends or enemies?”
When he fell asleep, he did so with a few flowers strewn in his bed and his fingers picked back to bleeding. He imagined they probably looked a lot like his heart: scabbed and raw and mostly numb.
It's not the sweetest thing that has ever touched his lips, but it's still so sweet.
“That’s lovely,” Narcissa says, giving him that warm smile again.
“What?” Ron asks. “What are you talking about.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Harry replied, because she had a bad feeling that Ginny was creeping towards what Hermione had brought up before she went to her first detention. She wondered in a panic if everyone thought that, if they were having secret Gryffindor meetings where they discussed whether or not they thought Harry liked Draco. Which Harry did not, even if they were friends.
Draco and Hermione have embarked on a line of conversation involving the various perks of high quality quill nibs, an affection that possibly only they and the literal Percy Weasley share, and Harry listens in relative confusion until they come to a stopping place before nudging Draco’s knee with his own. “As much as I love you all, I think it’s maybe time for me to find a shower and a real bed.”
Ron looks at him, really looks at him, and doesn’t seem to know what he’s seeing. “Water flows faster than fire?”
“This is probably going to sound worse, but I was honestly just surprised that you could make friends,” Harry says, then feels immediately like a twat.
“I don’t think we can often help what we do to what we love,” Draco replied slowly, not sure why’d he’d taken the conversation into personal territory but wishing nothing more than to drag it immediately back out. “Read it to me.”
“Is it about me?” Harry asks, not truly malicious but brushing against it.
“You’re not a monster,” Harry replies, wishing Draco would just look at him. He’s playing around but Harry knows that he believes everything he says.
“No, you’re right,” Harry replied, a smile alighting on to her face. “If I wear green, you should wear pink.”
“Me too,” Draco said, kicking her foot out so it knocked Harry’s. “What are you sad about?”
“It’s a shame Cho graduated,” Parvati whispered with a wink.
Nearby, Draco had been busying himself with a book he’d snuck out of the library. Normally, he didn’t sneak books out, but he didn’t particularly want anyone to find him reading this one, despite the fact that he quite liked appearing well read. It was thick, with a worn old cover: ‘20,000 Leagues Under the Sea’ embossed in fancy silver font.
“That’s what I like to hear,” Harry replied, feeling slightly less doom and gloom about the whole thing. Anthony was truly not the worst, and Ron’s reactions to Hermione getting paired with Blaise would be funny for Harry if no one else. She was fairly sure no hexes would be cast and Hermione and Ron were at their most entertaining when they were teasing each other.
“Have you two been talking?” Harry asks, narrowing his eyes at the both of them.
Draco nodded, looking out on the grounds and lapsing back into silence.
The forest, giddy with excitement, breathed her answer into his ears and surrounded them in soft summer breezes. “It’s me,” she whispered to him. “I did it for you.”
Harry nods, scribbling attentively on his pad ‘you know how frogs are with cucumbers,’ then crosses ‘frogs’ out and writes ‘toads.’ “Of course,” he says, knowing deep in his heart that he’s going to know far more about any type of amphibian that he’ll ever need to know by the end of this. “Typical toads.”
“I am aware of what you were thinking,” McGonagall replied, that sparkle of amusement back in her eyes. “But now that you mention it, I think that partnering with Ms. Malfoy could be constructive for both of you. And Ms. Malfoy, you will be able to lead, as you had hoped.”
The wind pushed a few red gold leaves across the grass and sent ripples across the lake. Draco was ignoring him, although Harry saw the muscle jump in his jaw and knew that it was deliberate. Harry briefly considered trying to out-wait him, but he didn’t think that would make him feel any better about any of it.
“It does,” Draco said, as firmly as he could. “Would you want me if you could have me? The real me?”
“Missed my mouth,” Draco said.
The forest welcomed him back in when he appeared at her edge, the sharp swell of his magic reminding her of the history he’d left in her depths, both blood and youth and the sticky scent of fear.
Just as he thought it, the branch he was sitting on bent slowly down towards the water, depositing him stumbling back into the lake. Though his shirt instantly saturated with water, he stayed mostly upright and didn’t grab for Harry even though it was his first instinct.
“We need to figure out how to make you talk less, it’s in no way the sexiest thing you do,” Draco says, looking around. “Where is your shower?”
Harry has an abrupt mental image of Draco imperiously waving away a poor, unsuspecting young wizard as Pansy presides at his left elbow. “That seems bizarre to me.”
“Thanks for making me pasta,” he says, instead of confirming what he’s sure Luna already knows.
“Very small,” Harry said. “As opposed to the amount of homework I still have, which is very large.”
“Yes?” Draco offers.
“Of course,” Harry said, giving her a grin. “I’m just glad you actually did it, I was worried when I didn’t see you.”
Harry stares at him, trying to connect what he’s saying back to himself even though it doesn’t seem to fit. He loves what he does, likes it better than paperwork and protocol and working with the ministry, but he’s so used to the pity other people gave him after he failed at being an auror that he doesn’t know what to do with this.
He wonders if Draco can read his inner monologue and feels irritation spark deep in his chest, because that feeling isn’t for him. There are only so many happy things and Harry wants to hoard them close to his chest and keep them secret. He wonders if that’s where the anger starts, and tries to grab and push at it. They trip into another memory with the abruptness of a slide change and Harry thinks he might have gotten it.
“I’ll bring it to the back,” Draco says, picking up the radio and heading through the blue curtain. He doesn’t look back, but Harry follows anyway, hopping up on the enormous wooden table as Draco puts the radio away. “Belinda does all the tv and radio stuff, she only lets me fix the record players.” He dusts off his hands, always deadpan. “They don’t explode if you fuck up.”
“Okay, Pansy, fess up,” Hermione says, turning to her.
Draco brushes his lips across Harry’s cheek, speaking softly into his ear. “Ask me again.”
“You’re a little ridiculous about Malfoy, you know that, right?” Anthony asked mildly, as they continued their waltz.
That night, the forest waited for him with eagerly waving branches and trembling fronds because she had something special for him. She knew she’d have to move slowly, because Draco was fragile like her butterflies, but she wanted to give him this one thing.
“Guess you’ll never have the privilege of knowing,” Draco said, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Harry sighs from somewhere deep inside his chest. Harry wonders how many of their charming friends have assumed that they’re sleeping together and how exactly he feels about it. If he’s honest, the emotion is closest to blind panic. “We’re honestly not, and you and everyone else can fuck off with it.”
Harry started to open her mouth, but was cut off by Draco. “Actually, forget I asked that, I’m sure you have more. Let’s just start.”
“Tell me.”
Malfoy blinks at him and for a moment Harry thinks he’s going to say no, but then he shrugs, lifting the tv up and carrying it through the blue curtain without waiting for Harry to follow.
Even if some horrible chain of events ever allows you to read this, I expect that by then I will have been kissed by another. By that I mean I will be dead. Dementors make terrible lovers, you know. See? I’m capable of humor, there’s another thing you never knew about me.
“Might as well deal with it,” Draco says, pushing through the doors with a sigh.
“Muggles know about those?” Draco asks, thinking of the earth magic they learned about, dream catchers and old rites.
Harry doesn’t argue with him, just picks up the tv and wishes he could stay longer. He wants to let Draco in, to trust him even though he has no reason to. He wants to ask Draco questions and have the answers make sense.
Draco shrugs, eyes fixed somewhere in the middle distance. “But we probably should.”
It shouldn’t work like it does, they shouldn’t have been able to fix all the frayed wires and missing parts between them, and yet somehow, it works better than anything else Harry’s ever had.
Harry could see groups of her friends beginning to gather on the dance floor and for a moment she almost joined them, but as she pulled out of Draco’s hug and started to walk she found herself pulled toward the doors instead. She smiled as she passed people she knew and drifted outside without a word, something heavy settling inside her as she took the slow walk down the empty corridor.
“I’m aware,” Anthony said, looking just a little bit fond. “Now go fix whatever you just fucked up.”
“No,” Harry said.
When Harry sees Draco leaning up against the sink in a loose tee shirt and dark green pajama bottoms, he nearly has a heart attack. He’d thought he was the only one in the eighth year dorms - everyone else in class or camped out in the library in preparation for their N.E.W.T.S - but there’s Draco, nose pressed nearly to the mirror, a tube of bright red lipstick in his hand.
Harry hurried over to her as fast as she could in heels, a smile on her face as she saw more of Draco’s outfit. She’d gone for a low cut pale pink dress with a skirt that swished about her knees when she moved and a pair of heels that added another three inches to her already tall frame.
It was bad enough that Harry had testified to his and his mother’s innocence at their trials, he didn’t need him savioring around after that with his stupid righteousness. Just because they had their little staring contests over breakfast didn’t mean Harry was allowed to barge into his life like that. The smallest bit of him registered that Harry was probably trying to be nice, but it was horribly overshadowed by the humiliated bit of Draco that just wanted to stop owing Harry things.
Harry can feel his face doing something terrible and knows that he looks terrified, that he is terrified, that he doesn’t know how to speak.
“I thought we were showering,” Harry manages, as Draco sucks a bruise against Harry’s collarbone. Harry is already hard, in addition to being moderately sweaty and blood covered, and is not sure he’ll be able to successfully perform his role as ‘the person who actually gets them into the shower.’
“Draco,” Harry manages, registering that he takes his own name like a blow. “You’re in love with me?”
“I can’t believe you’re actually wearing Slytherin green,” Seamus said as he held Harry’s hair up so she could clasp her necklace. “So ballsy.”
23. After Draco killed his father, he got reckless. He burned down the Manor. His mother had been dead for a long time, and he never talked about it. When he returned from this errand he smelled like smoke, even under the clothes, the skin. So much of him was a dead giveaway. Harry couldn’t believe that no one noticed, but no one had ever watched Draco like he had.
That night, the forest smelled odd, something he could only catch brief hints of through the heady scent of earth. It was, he realized after long minutes of walking: roses, a bright winter day, spice, and something else lingering and vaguely familiar.
“No, I usually have History of Magic,” Harry says, biting his lower lip to keep his smile from growing too wide.
“I am so proud of that boy sometimes,” Harry added. “How did he ask?”
“No, I suppose not,” Harry managed finally, looking almost guilty. “What are we then? Friends? Ex-enemies?”
“You did,” Draco replies. “I still have a scar.” He makes a drawing motion down the center of his chest and finds a hint of his old drawl back. “Very heroic, a hit with all the blokes.”
“I’ve always thought bright purple was a good color on me?” Blaise said, Draco nodding agreeably as Hermione quizzed him about sort of details he’d like on his mittens.
“Is he sleeping?” Draco asked the snake, who was circling them with slow precision. Draco felt a strong wave of protection, a sense of intense safety in the clearing that overwhelmed even his thrumming alarm at the snake.
It wasn’t until later, after he’d made his way back to his liquor cabinet, that he picked them up and sat in his favorite chair and weighed them in his hands. He could see the curl of Draco’s poncy, tight hand on cream colored parchment, and he wanted more than anything to tear them into tiny, tiny pieces. He wanted to tear any memory of Draco into tiny tiny pieces, until they were too small to touch him.
“Less kissing,” Draco says with the smallest quirk of a smile. “Probably. You can never really be sure.”
“You’re the one who didn’t know you could get yarn from rabbits,” Harry said, flicking Draco in the knee. “Besides, what are you here for, can you knit?”
Harry nodded, pausing only to move Ernie’s elbow level before following Draco out into the hallway, finding her standing with her arms crossed by the drinking fountain like she’d been waiting for Harry to show up.
“I’m here.”
“I see,” McGonagall said. “Do you think he has learned sufficiently?”
The longer Draco walked in the forest that night the more he felt it in his bones, felt the way it breathed and shifted beneath him. He thought wildly that if he opened his mouth and spoke to it, it might speak back.
“Potter, Merlin almighty, what is this? Are you scared he doesn’t like you back? Are you scared of what people are going to think?” she asks, staring at him curiously. Harry hates the way she looks like she’s seeing a new side of him for the first time, and wishes he knew how to cover it up.
“It sounds weird when you say it like that,” Draco grumbles, stepping back from the counter to cross his arms. “I just didn’t want to waste glass on something you broke on purpose.”
Draco begins to collect the newspapers. “Do you think we have a chance of solving it before the next full moon?”
“You forgot,” Draco prompts, and he’s starting to look almost angry. “You just let me. You let me. I thought Severus had taught you, I thought you knew what to do.”
“No problem, Potter. I love charity work,” Draco replied with his most winning smile before turning back to Pansy, who was raising her eyebrows at him.
“Hard to tell.” He watched her, setting his homework down with a sigh and patting the couch next to him. He remembered sixth year when she barely left his bed because both of them were too afraid to face anything, because they felt safer when they weren’t alone. They never talked about anything that was happening because he knew they felt differently, but the closeness always helped.
“Do you wish it was real?” Draco asked, the shaking of his hand making the light quaver. His breathing was wrong and Harry was sorry he’d never been good at compartmentalizing, was sorry that everything ran together.
“Use your ever present charm and wit,” Draco says, then smiles crookedly so Harry knows he’s joking. “I won’t throw you to the sharks, I’d like you to be invited back.”
In the forest, when Draco’s mother leans down to ask if he is safe, Harry can see her son in the curve of her mouth and the almond shape of her eyes.
“I could make you a flower crown probably,” she says, giving him an appraising look.
“I don’t know,” she said, a sadness in her eyes. She seemed to be searching for something to say, looking around at the flowers and the foliage like they’d give her answers. “Are you two-” A pause, scuffing her school shoes against each other. “In love? Do you love him?”
Draco’s eyes didn’t leave the moonlit grass as she spoke and Harry watched her, the careful movement of her lips and the gentleness that her eyes got when she wasn’t being so deliberately sharp, when she wasn’t trying to keep the world out.
“Yeah,” she says.
They nod like they’re taking his opinion into careful consideration, though he’s sure they know far more about layout design that he could even conceive of. “It’s probably going to get harder until you know everything.”
Draco looked as if she’d eaten something sour, and Harry fought the urge to laugh since she thought it would make Draco even more testy.
“No problem, Mione,” Ron replies, leaning over to give her a kiss on the top of the head.
A kettle goes off in another room and Harry glances out the window, surprised to see a white picket fence separating this yard from the next. He doesn’t know why he expected Narcissa to be at the manor after everything, but this cottage with its pretty furniture and peeling wallpaper is still surprising. The room seems almost overfilled and doesn’t quite all match, and Harry thinks he might recognize a table from his brief time at the manor, like maybe all of Narcissa’s favorite things were crammed in this little room.
“Draco, it’s me,” Pansy said, frowning. Her bangs were falling into her eyes but she didn’t drop his hands to push them back. “You haven’t had a panic attack in weeks.”
“I feel like I just got told off by a kitten,” Blaise said dismissively, brushing off his cloak and giving Draco a firm push in return.
Draco
The third, which he’s put off until last, is from Draco, it reads:
“I just don’t know if this is a good idea,” Harry said, almost like a question, a last breath of logic left on his lips. He wasn’t sure about the implications of getting off with a mirage. He wasn’t sure about the implications of getting off with Draco. Once again, he found himself unsure which one was worse.
Draco tries to think of a response, really he does, but the only thing he can seem to think of is that Potter is talking to him like a real person and they don’t do that with each other. They
“It’s very possible,” Harry says as seriously as he can, swallowing a moan as Draco twists his hand in a clever way. Harry can see how hard Draco is, and knows that he’ll probably lose his hand privileges if he tries to touch him again, which is a good enough reason for Harry to try, grinning when Draco grabs his wrist and twists it behind his back.
“I do like jumpers,” Harry says tentatively, because they’re soft and cozy and an absolutely delightful invention.
“You know which bit,” Harry says. “Ask nicely?
“But what about right now? This second, what’s stopping you?” Harry said, watching Draco shiver as each of the words hit his back. He looked as if he might be unspooling somehow.
3. Fifteen cows brought to the Hogwarts grounds for a petting zoo wandered into the forest one night and were never found.
“I don’t know,” Harry begins, knowing the words aren’t good enough even as they come out. He feels that same niggling terror he felt when trying to talk to Cho for the first time and thinks maybe he should just stay out of relationships if expressing his feelings always makes him want to gouge his eyes out. He takes a deep breath, trying to do better so Draco doesn’t curse him, or worse, leave. “Well like, no, I do know, at least, a little.” He rubs the heels of his hands into his eyes until spots of color grow in the darkness, trying to find the right words for once. His mouth goes dry when he meets Draco’s eyes so he talks at the blanket, words slipping like wet leaves from his mouth. “You make me feel safe and I feel like you understand me and like I understand you, more than other people do. I feel deeply connected to you and I don’t know if that’s a romantic connection or if it just means that we’re like, meant to be close somehow, but I like being with you. So much. I meant what I said, I do have a crush on you. It’s dumb, but I do.”
“Just like you told me you had a crush on me?” Draco replies, scowling over at him from the other side of the couch.
“You goaded me into it,” Harry says, looking away so Draco won’t see the way his cheeks have heated up. “How’s your potions miracle coming along?”
“I’ll try my best,” Harry assured him before rushing back her table, victorious at the thought of Draco in pink.
“You’d never trust me to do that,” Draco said, putting his wand away and brushing his hair back out of his face.
He peers inside, trying to observe without being noticed, and catches a glimpse of Draco’s blonde hair and a dark skinned girl with flora growing out of her skin. He lingers by the door, trying to catch snippets of their conversation.
“What are you laughing about?” Draco asked, her eyes narrowed.
“Do you suppose that if we kidnapped elder Councilman Filbin we could negotiate the firing and possible permanent murder of the younger Secretary Filbin for his release?” Ron proposes, looking a tetch too excited about the prospect.
Draco huffed. “It’s fine.”
Someone takes the microphone and calls the next band up, three girls taking the stage, one on keyboard and the other two on guitar.
“But why?” Harry asks. “Surely there’s someone else you’d rather ask.”
“I’m not in the mood for gossip, Pans,” he said, letting her take his arm as she steered them toward the great hall.
Anthony seemed at a loss for words, opening and closing his mouth a few times before settling on a mild expression. “Maybe you should talk to her.”
His memory couldn’t have done justice the feeling of another body pressed against his, Draco breathing heavy against his own stumbling breaths. He almost smiled at Draco’s fingers twining in his hair, the same mess of curls he’d claimed to hate so much. The irony was delicious.
“That’s cool,” Ron said, voice level. “The Forbidden Forest is a weird place. Mum used to tell me she’d kill me if I ever went in alone. There are some nasty stories, it can eat people up.”
He wandered through the sweet air, a faint mist beginning to snake its way through the trees and pooling at his feet.
Hermione glances over at Ron, who’s deeply involved in a game of wizard chess with Blaise, which Neville and Millicent are spectating. “Well, I’ve only kissed one other person here.”
He wanted to say something about Draco’s body, something that could possibly mirror the way Draco had called him lovely in a moment of distraction but the words didn’t seem to come. Harry pressed closer, sliding his arm over Draco’s shoulders and tugging him closer, gratified when Draco let himself be pulled into a kiss, his fingers curling around the soft parts of Harry’s hips.
“She probably hoped that you two would end your ridiculous feud and actually work together,” Hermione said sagely. “Which you could do. That would be quite good.”
“Hazza,” Lee says fondly, letting the check float down onto the table as he takes their dirty dishes back to the kitchen.
“You look like you just saw death,” Blaise said when he swept past him, a towel tied around his waist. “Nightmares?”
The woman at the counter - Belinda, her name tag says - is ringing up another customer when he enters, but she catches his eye before he can slip back out the door, and so he at least has to ask her.
“Much appreciated,” Harry said, glad at least that Anthony was proving to be less cripplingly awkward than she remembered him.
She saw Draco shift but she didn’t understand what was happening until she felt Draco’s free hand on her chin, tilting her head up until their lips met.
Delia’s eyes light up and she tells him that she’s going to go there, her little watering can arms shaking with excitement. It’s not an overly interesting conversation, in fact, he’s had similar ones hundreds of times over, but he knows that for these kids, he’s the only person they’ll talk to all day that isn’t a nurse, that to them it’s the most riveting thing in the world. When he’s there, he feels like he’s making something better, but explaining it to everyone else makes it sound hollow. There’s no way to pretend that it’s better than being Head Auror and no one believes him when he says it.
She nods, the jewels in her hair glinting in the light as her head moves. She has a way of listening that makes Harry feel like she’s never heard anything more interesting and it’s as fascinating as it is disconcerting. “Service, of course.”
Someone makes a choking noise. He has no idea who. He hopes very much that it’s not him. Harry is still bright red and staring, a curl falling very artfully into his eyes. Harry’s nose is a little crooked from a sub-standard Episkey. It’s entirely possible that Draco is the one who broke it, and it looks so rugged it should be illegal. Draco had known this, but up close it’s so much worse. Draco is so, so, so utterly fucked. This is the last thing he needs. Why is Harry so hot? What evil, vengeful god made Harry so hot?
“Handcuffs next time?” Harry suggests, which makes Draco smile again, that evil whisper of a thing that feels like a shared secret.
Harry reaches for his arm, pulling him back inside. “Aren’t you going to stay a bit?”
“It’s ice cream, how pretentious can it be?” Draco scoffed, crossing his arms. Somehow, pretending to be mad at Harry was almost as easy as really being mad at him.
“You should try death, you might like it,” Harry said sharply. “Maybe you could pull it off this time.”
Draco nods, the purple under his eyes the crumpled color of Aunt Petunia’s summer pansies. “I practiced a long time before I got the hang of it. You just have to uncleave. I know you’re capable of it.”
“I don’t quite believe I am,” she began, still standing very quietly. “In the way that you are.”
“Merlin forbid something isn’t fair,” Draco said, and even without the edge in his voice he still made Harry’s words crumble. The silence between them filled with the swish and rustle of the forest and Draco breathed in very slowly. “It’s not really snakes.”
“But can I?” Harry pressed.
Harry didn’t know what happened to the clothes he went to battle in. He couldn’t really remember how he’d felt, only the scratch of a tag on the back of his neck, his blue t-shirt dark with sweat and dirt, a stain that covered the entire left sleeve that must have been blood.
Understanding dawns on him. “Oh.”
She gives Harry a look as she leaves, hazel eyes meeting his before she slips out.
“I think so too,” Harry said, meeting smiling glances with grins of her own. “Kinda makes you feel like things are finally okay.”
Harry bites back the cranky remark he wants to make, and instead permits Dara to kick the wall for a solid twenty minutes, during which he develops a headache he can only sufficiently describe as a catastrophe.
“I’m just awful at reading people,” he says, unable to resist the urge to mope. He feels wretched, trapped, and stupid and he doesn’t want to go back to Auror training, doesn’t want to go anywhere that isn’t the yellow warmth of Grimmauld place. “I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. It feels bloody awful. I feel like he’s trying to torture me. I’d call him a sadist but he doesn’t even seem to enjoy it.”
“It’s a beautiful day, aren’t I allowed to smile?” Harry asked, even though they all knew he’d been caught out.
“Oh no, not that. I’m just. You know. Hosting.”
“Thanks for not kicking me out,” Harry adds cheekily, and Draco just cocks his head.
Draco examines the menu carefully, like it’s a wine list, ignoring Harry completely. “Mmm.”
“Fair points made across the board,” Harry says.
“Bugs are cool,” Harry says, but without much enthusiasm. Draco gives him a skeptical look, and he shrugs. Luna has been running a column in the Quibbler on Neville’s coolest mushroom finds from abroad, so he has more than the average amount of energy for indulging the weird, random things people love.
Harry nodded back, waving awkwardly as trees grew up between them and they lost sight of each other, trapped on either side of the criss crossing branches.
“Small blessings,” Harry said, leaning in to kiss the lipstick smudge and secretly hoping she would make it worse.
“Of course I’m fucking back,” Draco hissed, crossing his arms over his chest. “And so are you.”
“Don’t put your hand in mine like a dead fish and expect me to just tolerate it,” Draco replied firmly. “And don’t schlump when you dance. I can already see your posture falling.”
Draco nodded, sneaking a look over at Greg, who had picked up a pair of needles and was working on a long strip of scarlet yarn with a smile. “He wanted to go but he wouldn’t go alone, so we mobilized.”
“Jess has almost certainly not been kidnapped too,” Harry says, rolling his neck gingerly. “Those stupid biscuits. They weren’t even delicious. We were conned by mediocre biscuits.”
“I read another muggle book,” Draco said, voice floating up into the air. It reminded Harry of being in the dorms with the Gryffindor boys, of talking past lights out as they gazed at the scarlet of their canopies.
He’s a little worried Draco is going to take offense at him asking, but the question doesn’t seem to bother him. “Probably not. How strange. The mechanisms of evil move on without me.” Then, he shrugs languidly. “They don’t even send me the Death Eater Digest any longer.”
“I don’t want to,” Draco said, still gripping the windowsill with a controlled anger. “But I’m going to be stuck with you whether you’re shit or not so we might as well.”
“No, Ernie!” Harry said firmly, then softened her tone when his face crumpled. “It’s not that I don’t want to help you, I just don’t want to stick Anthony with Draco and I don’t want to piss McGills off.”
“You do not have to be nice to me when I’m being a knob,” Harry said seriously. “If you were nice to me then I would know that you were really out for my blood.”
“Oh?” Ron prompts, pulling the beginnings of breakfast down from the cabinet. Cereal for Luna, upstairs in the attic. Strawberries, toast and sunny side up eggs for Harry, in Sirius’ old room. Scrambled eggs and toast for Hermione in Regulus’ old room.
“I hope not,” Harry says, then, “That’s all. It was almost nothing.”
“So that was weird, right?” Ron whispered as soon as they turned the corner. “Was that the most bizarre shit ever or am I losing it?”
43. “When did you decide to trust me?” Draco asks.
“Like what?” Harry asks, still looking at the bruise blossoming across Draco’s cheek, the blood still dry on his neck, his hair, which hasn’t been neat since the day began.
“McGiggles!” Ron repeated, looking like Hermione had just said something quite incredible.
“Are you, you know, sleeping okay?” Harry asked, his voice cracking on the first you even as he tried to keep it steady.
Harry’s mind drifts back to the muggle repair shop, to Malfoy, quiet behind the counter. He almost wants to bring it up, but he doesn’t think he can do it without all his strange feelings bubbling up into his mouth.
Draco nods, brushing his hair out of his eyes with a hand that, after everything, still shakes. “Let’s try again. Push me out. I mean it.”
“You probably could,” Harry replies, although he can’t think of anything Draco might say that would make him feel that old animosity.
Draco rolls his hips as Harry strokes him, whimpering against Harry’s neck. Harry is swept up in the bizarre urge to call Draco some kind of pet name, which he’s never done in his life and is terrified to actually open up his mouth and do. As he moves his hand over Draco’s cock, his thumb sliding precome across the head, Harry also seriously considers telling Draco that he loves him, which he thinks is definitely something they still need to work up to.
“If she’s the only vendor, would she supply to other potioneers?”
Pansy snorted, her own table fairly successful, if a bit wobbly. “What a mess, truly. I don’t know how Granger stands either of them.” She made a face at Ron, who was doing the exact same thing as Harry. Hermione, perched on her own table, watched them with amusement.
The moment they finally fall upon manifests as a tight ache in his chest that it soon becomes clear is breathlessness. Next is the ache in his legs and the thump of his feet against dry grass and he realizes he’s running. This could be any time, it happened so often it first blurred and then became nonsensical.
Draco is becoming quickly aware of the fact that his strategy of mainlining mixed drinks and listening to other people’s conversations, while his favorite party activity, is perhaps not as clandestine as he’d previously assumed. “She did say you first. Only under duress did she say Harry.”
Go figure that Draco would even smell expensive. Harry was fairly sure she smelled like the apples in her shampoo.
“Oh,” Draco says. “Did that help?”
“I like you better when you’re not falling over yourself about Malfoy.”
She was just about to see if the dart game could use another player when a very drunk Draco Malfoy stumbled into her, grabbing Harry’s arm and shoulder.
“Congratulations on your win Saturday,” Harry said when Draco finally made her way over, a beanie pulled over her hair. Hair that Harry knew to be quite soft, which was yet another bit of knowledge she probably could have gone without.
“Do you think she scowls when she sleeps?” Ron asked.
The forest was being especially gentle with him, making the air sweet and hanging the trees heavy with peaches for him to eat. The forest felt badly about the way that Harry and Draco had fought, as she’d hoped that the feelings they both held simmering inside themselves would have made them kinder.
Harry doesn’t answer her and Ron comes back a short time later, the mood a little quieter even as he tries to crack jokes and tease them both.
“I’ll probably just ignore it and ask Luna. They’re a great date, they smell like flowers and don’t really care if your hair’s a mess,” Harry said brightly, remembering the absolute shit show that had been both Parvati and Cho. Truly, the worst thing about the whole Yule Ball debacle was rehashing the most traumatizing romantic period of Harry’s life.
“I’m trying,” he said, feeling like she’d taken a small bit of his torn up heart, like she’d looked at it with her sharp eyes and deemed it something better than rotten.
“My circulation’s bad,” Harry replied, trying to pry himself out of the death grip Draco had on his wrist. “I died, remember?”
“Thank you Ron,” Hermione says sarcastically.
Draco nods vaguely. His fingernails, Harry notices, have dirt underneath. In his memories, Draco is always so clean, and it’s jarring to see him like this, a little less so. It always surprises him how much he still knows about Draco, how much he’ll probably always know.
Recovered from his lycanthropic jaunt, he’s as sharp, glittering, and unforgiving as a dagger and it’s a bit much to deal with, even over coffee. He keeps making Harry want to smile.
“I am conniving.” Draco leans his head back, smiling wryly at Harry, who feels his stomach flip. He thinks it’s the first smile he’s ever gotten out of Draco, maybe ever, and he wants to make it happen again. “Merlin, how is it that neither of us ended up dying? You’d think with how hard we tried to kill each other, one of us would have figured it out.”
Draco glowers, fussing anxiously with his straw. “Will she tell? I’m aware that it’s a story. I’m surprised Rita Skeeter hasn’t smoked me out yet.”
Terrified,
“You’ll survive,” Harry replied. “Now put a shirt on and come to breakfast with me.”
He walked through the winding paths just for something to do with himself, listening as the trees swayed and odd bird calls drifted from their branches. He smelled the soft warmth of Spring in the air but couldn’t understand what any of it meant. He worried that maybe the forest wasn’t trying to tell him anything at all, that this was some strange dream that he should have woken up from by now. Then again, if it was a dream, he should at least be able to kiss someone pretty again.
Draco kisses him again like he can’t stop and Harry melts into it, clutching Draco’s jumper.
He’d known for a while that he fancied blokes just as much as anything else, but having Draco’s mirage kiss him was still a surprise. He was hoping the mirage wasn’t a construct of his own mind, because he wasn’t sure he was comfortable knowing that he’d dreamt up a Draco who wanted to kiss him. Nevermind that he was finding he wanted to kiss Draco back, which scared him just as much as it made him feel a rush of hope. He couldn’t figure out if wanting a mirage still made him broken.
“I don’t know, maybe,” Draco said, looking heartbroken, looking like he had when he was young. Everything blurred together and they were everywhere they’d gone, they were everything they’d been to each other, they were enemies and lovers and things without names. They were beyond names. They were two boys who wanted to love each other but didn’t know how. “You’re the one who tried to leave.”
“Because I thought it would be nice,” Draco replies, suddenly prickly as he turns.
Draco recognizes the look on Pansy’s face as Highly Meddling and Dangerous and realizes that he has made a terrible mistake. The obvious choice would have been to gloat that he’s the only one who hasn’t stooped to kissing Potter, as he most certainly doesn’t secretly want to. He has fumbled the tease, because he does want to kiss Potter, so, so badly that it makes looking at him for too long absolutely unbearable.
“Couldn’t tell you,” Harry replies, leaning against the table and watching Draco examine the machine.
He’s the one who crept into Draco’s life and fell for him, he has to pick up the pieces.
“Sometimes,” Draco says, popping open a tub of something shimmery and white and running the tip of his finger across the surface. He leans into the mirror, brushing his finger across the top of his eyelid, leaving behind a shine of pearly white. “Not that it’s actually any of your business what I do.”
“Are you going to hurt him?” she asked after a pause that even the forest couldn’t adequately fill with her soft breeze and slowly falling flower petals.
“Oh?” Harry asks, watching the photo of Calypso stroking the ears of a wolf so he doesn’t focus on the way the flush on Draco’s cheeks creeps to the shells of his ears.
“A fair criticism of ballroom dancing,” Hermione mused. “But they only make us dance a little, you can refrain from touching boys the whole rest of the night.”
“I’d never ask anything like that of you,” Harry said, and she wasn’t worried, because Draco’s eyes were soft like they were when she talked about something she loved.
“Still, it is a motive,” Harry says, considering it. “Dara already talked to her and didn’t have much to report, but I can send her back for a second opinion.”
48. “You’re not bad. I know bad people and you’re not bad,” Harry says.
“What are you daydreamin’ about, HP?” Dara asks, perching like a bird in one of the chairs he has arranged in front of his desk, her strappy boots squeaking against the leather.
“Just like,” Draco shrugs, looking through the windows instead of at Harry’s face. “You aren’t under qualified to give talks. I’m not sure if you know how good you are at that sort of thing.”
“Indeed,” Draco said, dabbing again at the tears that finally seemed to have slowed.
The forest remembered the way he had been and she missed his arrogance in the face of her winding branches, because she thought he had been so funny, so stubbornly prideful in the face of his own cruelty and terror. She was also cruel and adored with the same destruction he did, and so she loved him.
