‘Cherry cigarette. I don’t smoke them normally, because they’re hard to find, but I do keep a pack for special occasions.’ Harry pulled a pack from the drawer and offered it to Draco.
‘No, not the trigger, the appearance of the band itself. When they approached that old lady. It’s right there next to you.’ Draco moved to pick up the parchment, but Potter was faster – he was already standing behind him, reading and chewing on his bottom lip. ‘There, look!’ Draco vaguely registered that Potter was showing him something in the report, for all his concentration seemed to fade away with the feeling of Potter’s chest being pressed into his back.
‘You could properly dry yourself before coming out, you know? I’m going to snap my neck on that water you’re leaving all over the place.’ It was weak at best, but it was all he got for now. His brain was severely lacking blood supply at this point it seemed like, because all of it was rapidly rushing south.
‘Hermione, slow down.’ Neville looked white as a sheet. ‘If he hasn’t lost any blood and he isn’t bleeding his soul out, how will someone else’s blood help?’
He and Malfoy were dying for the same thing, committing the same sacrifice, but nobody cared. Malfoy would die here, probably rot here, and nobody would care why.
“Why must you die by my hand, Malfoy?” He asked, quietly, keeping his emotions and thoughts in check. None of this made sense. None of it.
His legs were curled slightly and his arms were at odd angles, one up near his head and the other at his side. The awkwardness of his body spoke volumes; Harry knew what that meant, had seen it too many times to count.
Harry tried not to flinch when Draco’s legs fell limply as Hermione let go, tried to ignore the smartly clothed heel that bounced off his knee.
Harry let out a deep exhale. He looked at Malfoy, the conviction and the restraint. Malfoy was not here to trick or deceive. He needed Harry to kill him.
“Like you pity me.” Malfoy replied, looking him directly in the eye. His spine straightened just a little, and his hands slid down his thighs in a smoothing motion. “Let’s not pretend we are friends. We hate each other. However, I need you to do one thing for me.”
Harry’s death was going to significant to the Wizarding world, everyone knew he was going to Voldemort now. His death was a prophecy, an expected sacrifice.
Voldemort had prepared that they would find the Horcruxes, and made one that nobody would expect. They’d hesitate to kill him, try and manipulate themselves around it if given half the chance. But when it came down to it, they eventually would. They would lose too much if they didn’t.
They travelled through the castle, Harry taking the path that avoided Colin’s body until they reached the heavy door to the grounds.
“Take his arms, Ron will take his feet.” She instructed, voice firm but gentle. When neither of them moved to touch Draco, she gritted her teeth.
Harry growled as Malfoy heaved himself to his feet and started running away. Harry reached for his ankle from where he knelt, trying to bring Malfoy down again, but missed. Malfoy darted across the garden, quick as a ferret, stumbling over half-dead plants and barely glancing back at Harry. He darted up the stone steps of the hut as Harry followed closely with red-tinged vision, and yanked the door open hard. Harry raced after him, enraged that Malfoy was going to destroy this once last peaceful place.
Harry reached out and touched it before he could stop himself. It was soft, and Harry couldn’t stop touching it.
Harry waited, watching carefully as all Malfoy did was breathe and stare, but not beg. He didn’t beg. He didn’t even open his mouth, instead simply staring him down, grey eyes meeting Harry’s and not looking away. He breathed heavily, chest heaving with the desperate grasp for oxygen, but otherwise did not move.
“We need to get started.” He spoke, and looked to see Hermione already summoning two shovels. “Nobody can suspect what we are doing.”
Harry leant back as Malfoy’s weight shifted in the chair. He looked up to see Malfoy’s bony hand reaching for his right sleeve, lifting it up his arm gently.
He felt Hermione reach for him, trying to hug him. But he stepped away, towards Draco. He couldn’t bare to be touched with any measure of love.
He wondered idly if that anger was really about Malfoy, or whether the blonde was a merely convenient scrape-goat that stood in his way. Whether he was somebody to take it out on, because violence and anger came too easily when faced with Malfoy. Harry abruptly scoffed at himself, as he realised what they were doing. He was pointing a wand at Malfoy because the blonde was just standing still in a garden.
It stumped Harry for a moment, tilting his head a little in his confusion. Their interactions had only ever consisted of threats, sarcasm, or violence. Harry and Malfoy had never stood in a room together and only shared silence.
But this close, it wasn’t hard to see how human Malfoy was. The normally steel grey eyes were now open, and Harry realised that look he’d seen in his eyes before it was hidden behind anger and pride was fear and hurt.
Harry remembered himself. In less than twenty minutes he had to be dead or they were going to lose this war.
He wished he’d been kinder to Draco in his last moments. None of that crap that happened in the previous years mattered. Harry forgave him.
Malfoy, for the first time in his life, sat silently. Now that he wasn’t laying on the floor, the differences in before and now were much clearer. Since Harry’s had known him, Malfoy always had perfect posture, sharp eyes and sharper mouth. His clothes and hair were always perfect, mouth set in a constant sneer.
After they both died, Voldemort would be weak. He hoped Mcgonagall or somebody else would have the strength to finish it. He hoped beyond all hope that this war would end today with them free. It had to.
He needed them to win this war, even if it was at the cost of the cold blooded murder of a wizard he had grown up with, in one way or another. He wondered where the Harry that refused to kill, refused to use dark magic, had gone. His own sacrifice had made him cruel and desperate, willing to do anything to achieve his goal.
He walked past the destruction, the death permeating his home. He felt betrayed by those he had viewed as his father figures. They all knew he was to die, had known for years. They put him through all of this because he was a sacrifice they could afford. That they needed to die so they could win.
Draco’s hands laid awkwardly at his sides, and Harry struggled to decide where to lay them. On his chest? No. Then he’d look like a vampire.
Malfoy gripped at his wrists, trying to pull himself free. Harry held strong, even as Malfoy’s nails raked down his hands. When he couldn’t get free, Malfoy started pushing at his chest, breathing heavily as his eyes were glazed over; wet but not crying.
Malfoy was evidently looking for something, but obviously wasn’t expecting to get a knock over the head.
Harry had to bite his lip at the blooded slur. He wanted to react, to remind Malfoy he had no right to use that word, but Malfoy was so far away and Harry was afraid to bring him back. Malfoy had obviously thought about this war a lot, and it seemed odd to be so pessimistic about it, since he was on the winning side of the war.
“We could have been friends, in a different life.” He whispered, and Malfoy tilted his head back and laughed. It spilled out of his long throat, like it was punched from his chest. It was a choked, mirthless sound but a laugh nonetheless.
He was sick of being manipulated, sick of being forced. He felt like a puppet to fate. Because of course. Of course he couldn’t go peacefully to his own death, accepting and ready.
Harry stood up immediately, the anger coming back like a long lost friend. He got into Malfoy's space, towering over him. Malfoy recoiled like a snake ready to strike, body tense and eyes bright.
Across from him, Malfoy folded his arms over his chest and gripped his own elbows tightly, like he was restraining himself. Harry sat back into his seat fully, and ran through every possibility in his head. How was Narcissa Malfoy going to help them win the war? Was she going to kill the snake? Why would she? She was a death eater, married to Voldemort’s closest, and had born a son for the cause. She was on the other side, through and through.
He did now, because upon touching Draco’s cold hand, the wand stopped responding. It had realised its master’s death.
“I have to.” He said, and Neville just nodded. He looked away from Harry’s face, and a tear dripped down from his eye. It created a path through the dirt on his face as it rolled down his cheek.
They still didn’t move, standing over Draco but not making any attempt to touch him. Harry couldn’t touch that cold skin again. Not again.
Now his shoulders here slumped forward, hands clasped demurely in his lap. His hair was longer than Harry remembered, falling into his eyes in light waves. Harry hadn’t known that Draco’s hair wasn’t straight, for the the entire time he has known the blonde his hair was always gelled back. His dark suit was dirty, ripped and burned at the hems, and his shoes were dusty and scuffed. His eyes didn’t meet Harry’s, and that was probably the most shocking of all.
Ginny’s voice brought him out of his head, just like it always did. He watched her for a moment longer, heart longing. He hoped that Ginny would learn to love another, because she deserved so much more to mourn for him for the rest of her life.
“You need to explain. Right. Now.” He hissed. He didn’t have time to play Malfoy’s games, but he wanted them to win so badly. He wanted a guarantee before he died, that they would win.
Harry waited for the usual cowardly pleads and threats, because it was what Malfoy did best. The boy was a bully and a coward all rolled into one. He didn’t have much else.
Harry remembered his first time in Ollivander’s, how crazy the man had seemed when talking about the wands making decisions and choosing the wizard. Harry had never quite believed that they were sentient, or could make choices.
For years afterwards, gossip filled the Hogwarts halls; bounced off the walls and whispered in dormitories.
And now that he could see it, he was astounded that Lucius Malfoy hadn’t seen it himself. That he still threw loyalty at the man that had ruined his family and was complacent in the destruction of his son.
And that just made Harry angrier. Voldemort had made Malfoy into a weapon like he was nothing more than a locket or a cup. Treating a human being like an inanimate object to be used and weaponised without their consent.
Harry felt a wave of remorse. Even now, she spoke in code, refused to reveal what Harry did to Draco. Harry didn’t deserve her protection from what he had done.
“Why does it matter, Potter?” Malfoy sighed. “You won’t be around to dictate it anyway. Come on, stop delaying. You need to go.”
“Potter?” The blonde git yelped as he came into view, the older boy scrambling backwards on his elbows and feet as Harry kneeled over him.
Harry wanted to throw up. He squatted down, balancing on the balls of his feet as he rested his elbows on his knees. He pressed his thumbs firmly against his temples, trying to not to lose it in front of Malfoy.
“That’s because it was.” Malfoy smirked at him, the first sign of the Malfoy that Harry knew. Or perhaps not. The smirk was cheeky, without any anger or hate. He’d never known Malfoy to do that.
“I’m sorry, but it’s true. He was a Horcrux. We knew from the beginning that we had to destroy every single one.”
“Why are you here, Malfoy? What do you need from me?” He asked. Malfoy bit his lip, but when he spoke it was with conviction.
But Malfoy did not try to take it. He simply lifted his hand, and made Harry point the wand at his chest.
Ron and Hermione were all grown up. They were young adults now, but not in the way Harry imagined them growing up together. They were weighed down by his war, the joy and laughter they shared in their youth all discarded to focus on survival.
Wait. Malfoy didn’t have a wand, because it was in Harry’s pocket. He came here, defenceless, on purpose. Why hadn’t Harry noticed that?
“Did you Harry? Did any of us deserve what happened in this horrible war? No. We didn’t, but this is war. War takes and takes and we have learnt to accept it.”
“You’re an arsehole, Malfoy, but you were good when it mattered. You didn’t kill Dumbledore. You didn’t give me up to Bellatrix. You were cruel and dumb, but you understand your own failings and now you’re trying to fix them.” He reached for Malfoy, gripping his shoulder and ignoring the feeling of Malfoy’s bones under his skin. “I don’t know about you, but that sounds like a good person to me.”
“Just do it you giant git.” Malfoy snapped suddenly, harsh in the quiet that settled, eyes reflecting the light outside the broken window over Harry’s shoulder. They were bright with anger, pure and unadulterated rage. The sudden anger made Harry flinch, his wand hand dropping slightly before he brought up it back up again in automatic retaliation when faced with an angry Draco Malfoy.
He was so young, and now he would no longer age. His skin was clear of wrinkles, of sun spots and freckles beyond the faint dusting on his cheeks.
Harry looked without meaning to. Draco was where Harry left him, crumpled on the floor near the wall like a discarded doll.
“Anything.” He whispered, and he meant it. He would give everything short of his own life to Malfoy in that moment.
He’d no doubt noticed how his hands wouldn’t stop shaking now that he wasn’t carrying Draco. Sometimes Hermione was so awfully compassionate.
Colin was only sixteen, but then again, Harry was eighteen; and he was about to die just the same way. A killing curse to the chest, and death was instant.
“Why should I care?” Harry asked, a little of his usual deflective tone already setting in. He knew how to do this.
He felt his knees buckle, landing next to Draco’s body. Only Harry’s frantic breathing could be heard, because Draco was so still and quiet. Draco looked like a doll, for there was no blood or any other evidence of death. He just looked like he’d stopped breathing, and that was all. His eyes were glassy and hollow, staring up at the ceiling without any emotion or life. His blond hair was splayed around his head, a tuft of it hanging in his unseeing eyes.
‘I don’t know. We’re not a couple, but there is something, at least when we’re drunk. So it doesn’t seem like we’re exactly just friends either.’
(he might be gay, he might get off on mental images of Potter, but Draco was firm on refusing to admit, even to himself, that looking at the bloody Chosen One gave him a boner – not even when all he could think of right now was his arse…
Harry and Draco didn’t talk for the next couple of days, each one lost in their own thoughts. Draco was too afraid to tell Harry what conclusion he reached sitting in the common room (once again, behaving like a bloody coward, he thought glumly) and Harry was too busy trying to figure out what it was he was thinking really. He didn’t accomplish much by Tuesday evening, when Draco stood in the doorway looking at him worriedly.
Harry, on the other hand, didn’t get any sleep at all. He was trying to wrap his brain around the events of the past few days. All the love he still felt for Draco told him he should believe what he was told, but the logical part of him wasn’t sure about it. He decided to wait and see if there were going to be any more situations like that before making up his mind on whether he wanted this relationship to continue.
- You want more baby? Just say it. – Draco couldn’t restrain himself from sprinkling a little of his order-giving into it.
‘But Minister…’ Neville looked almost as terrified as Draco ‘if we don’t even know if he’s involved, how can we let him on the case?’
‘So you’re a doctor now? Give me a break, I puked once and it was after downing half of your vodka in under 10 minutes.’
‘What razor?’ Neville pressed his hands to his mouth. ‘Oh God, I’m sorry, I forgot about the Veritaserum… Don’t answer that!’
The coma didn’t work exactly as the healers would’ve expected – actually, it did at first, but the more time has passed, the more Harry became aware of what was going on around him. He heard the hushed voices of people in the room, he felt the cold from the open window bite him, he knew that Draco was next to him. The only thing he wasn’t able to do was to tell, or even indicate in some other way, that he was fully conscious under the appearance of sleep. So he laid there, taking in all the sounds of his hospital room, trying to shake off the last remnants of whatever potion he’s been given, to fully wake up and tell everyone he was ok. He felt weak, but luckily there was no pain, so he was more concerned about Draco than himself really.
Harry was sitting in his office, burying himself in paperwork, when a small ‘pop’ of apparition, followed by a string of curse words, shot him upright. Ron has appeared in the middle of the room, his hand firmly holding the wrist of some unknown man. The man was trying to get out of Ron’s grip muttering derogatory terms under his breath. The whole scene looked rather surreal – in Harry’s experience, if someone didn’t want to be taken along by apparition, they would usually try and hex the person kidnapping them immediately upon landing, but this particular man looked more subdued – his movements were slow, like there was a thick layer of invisible jelly surrounding him, and even his constant verbal attack towards Ron seemed strangely calm, like he knew that was what he was supposed to be doing but wasn’t really in the mood for it. Ron had no trouble forcing the man into a chair at Harry’s desk. As soon as he was forced to sit, the man calmed down, like even pretending to try and run away drained him, and looked at him with a confusingly amused expression. Just as their eyes locked, Harry’s blood turned to ice.
- You wouldn’t… - Draco was never this afraid in his whole life. Would Potter really out him? He tried to decipher the other man’s expression, but Harry only put his clothes on and shut the door behind him.
‘I have no idea. I thought at the time that maybe he wanted me to know he killed himself because I caused this.’
‘There is no way for him to do that, you know that.’ Hermione tried to be reassuring, but looked worried. ‘Besides, who could he be scheming against? He won’t go after Kingsley’s job, he doesn’t want the responsibility and everyone knows you can’t touch Kingsley. And every other job at the Ministry is beneath him, so there is no possible target.’
It was nearly three weeks into their stay at the Manor, when Harry and Draco finally managed to sit down to discuss their future work plans, both with each other, and with Narcissa.
- I have not caused anything. As you know, since you were apparently the expert on everything during my trial, I was cleared of all charges. I haven’t done anything that would warrant punishment last year and before that I was not an adult. And besides, repairing a cabinet is not a crime.
‘Oh, hi, good evening.’ Draco couldn’t decipher what her expression was. ‘How are you feeling? Does it still hurt?’
‘That was before he came back and got himself involved with the snatchers! And with you! You clearly cannot be trusted around him!’
‘Harry…’ the blonde looked him in the eyes – Harry could clearly see he was worried ‘if it hurts maybe I should try to open this. Besides, father said it was sealed with his blood, so my guess is that mine will be the most likely to unlock whatever this is.’
‘I think you’re right, Hermione.’ Harry said. ‘But I still think it’s a bad decision on Kingsley’s part. You can’t trust any of them, and to give that kind of a job to Lucius… I can’t see anything good coming out of it. I’m just scared he’ll try to pull some scheme again.’
, it’s not like I was doing nothing all those years, you know?’ Draco pouted. ‘I’m not lazy! I just… I just lack sufficient concentration skills to do it for more than 10 minutes.’
- Yeah, she’s in our room snogging Wesley. I had to get out of there. – She made a disgusted face. – Draco, what are you still doing lying down? Up with you!
a Slytherin, so he wouldn’t just settle for not knowing. ‘Nobody who runs a scheme like that operates without a plan for this long and manages to not be captured.’
‘There has to be something in there, I know it. We just can’t crack it.’ Draco was determined to find the answer. He
- Oh, that tone and language seems hardly suitable for the Chosen One, don’t you think? – at this point Draco was so angry he didn’t even bother to be civil towards Potter. After all, he earned it. – Besides, you smacked into me, it’s hardly my fault you don’t pay attention to anyone enough to look where you’re going.
They were lying in bed, reading. Harry looked at Draco stretched out on his back next to him, one arm folded under his head, causing his black t-shirt to ride up, revealing a stripe of skin at the bottom of his stomach. His muggle sweatpants (Harry mentally thanked himself for introducing Draco to those) were just barely covering his hipbones. Harry turned to the side, his book now on the bed between them. He read a couple more lines before reaching out and running his hand across Draco’s exposed skin. The blonde looked at him slightly shocked, raising his eyebrows.
It was nothing like their first time. It was slow and sensual and deliberate, not like before, where they both just wanted to fill their greed for each other. Draco felt like each stroke and each flick of Harry’s tongue on him was thought through, like it was designed ahead of time specifically for his pleasure. He never wanted it to end and his body seemed to agree with him – he felt his orgasm building slower than usual, almost as if his own body wanted to prolong the moment as much as possible, on its own accord, without any interference from his mind. He looked down. The sight was breathtaking, with Harry looking in his eyes directly, savouring him like nothing else in the world would ever matter, like it was precisely his sole purpose in life. Draco knew that if he kept looking at his boyfriend any longer, it would all be over. He closed his eyes and threw his head back. “God, baby, you’re so beautiful…” – it came out breathless and barely audible, but that was how he was feeling. It was all so surreal that he half-expected any words to burst the bubble they both seemed to be surrounded by. His mind went completely blank when Harry ran his tongue along his length. He didn’t even scream, it seemed like his orgasm happened in slow motion when he came in extensive bursts with just a long, shaky exhale.
), when the water stopped and the bathroom door opened. Draco didn’t want to look up, he really didn’t, but there he was, looking at Potter standing there, wrapped in only a towel, water still dripping from his hair. Was he always this handsome? No, he used to be a scrawny teenager for far longer than it was normal (how did Draco even notice this?). So how did he become so… manly, all of a sudden? Being an Auror would force you to get some muscles, sure, but that much? Was this just an undisclosed job perk or was Potter actually doing something to get this ripped?
‘Oh, hello, Weasley. Looking for someone?’ The man said politely, clearly not fazed by Ron suddenly appearing in his doorway. Ron was starting to suspect that the thing the man was smoking must not be a cigarette.
- Told you, you can’t know. Point is, I behaved like a monster and I had to step back not to do it again, because I’m apparently completely unable co control myself. And now I’m here with you, Harry is alone for all I know, and I don’t know how to go on from here.
- No, Harry, we can’t. You know as well as I do this will happen again. I cannot control myself around you and I’m going to end up hurting you again. Harry, baby, love… I’m sorry, so sorry, but we can’t do this. I love you too much to risk hurting you like that again. You deserve to be safe, I swore to do it, and I failed.
- You keep convincing yourself. For all I know, he didn’t even know it was you and didn’t want to risk his boss getting angry at him.
- “Incautious”. God, you’re dramatic… - Harry laughed out loud this time. Soon, Draco joined him. Maybe McGonagall was up to something when she decided to assign them to the same room?
- Stay. – It sounded like an emotionless instruction, but Harry knew Draco only wanted him to feel good. – I want to know how you taste baby.
‘Miss, I’m sorry to inform you, but those young boys were most likely swindlers.’ Ron was rather shocked at the revelation. ‘You see, Death Eaters have all been locked up and with Voldemort gone, there isn’t exactly anyone there to get them started again.’
- Ron, I think you might be right. – Seamus joined in. – See how it’s “us” now? I think the bravest Gryffindor in Hogwarts just turned into the most traitorous Slytherin!
‘That’s where the tricky part starts.’ Hermione sighed. ‘Since this is ancient dark magic, it’s based on blood. So, if everything worked as it should, you should’ve bled until all that’s left in you was your worst qualities and memories and then it should’ve closed up…’
‘Enough. You’ll be spending some time in holding, at least until I figure out if your alibi checks out.’ He stood up and left the room, gesturing for the guard to secure the door behind him.
‘I don’t either. I haven’t been in the house for three years, I don’t even have a clue what happened to it after parents lost it.’
‘My… my father? You want me to talk to Lucius?’ He was panicking. Ever since the end of the war him and Lucius weren’t even speaking – after Voldemort’s defeat Lucius shut off from everyone and Draco blamed himself for not being able to pull the family back together, and since the conviction he slowly grew to hate his father for what he put him and his mother through.
‘Gentlemen, as much as I applaud your sacrifices to your job, spending three nights in some field in northern Scotland, I cannot do that. Mr. Malfoy is, for all intents and purposes, an innocent person, so there is no way I can have him sent to Azkaban just because of Mr. Weasley’s intuition.’ Draco looked relieved. ‘But I do agree that Mr. Malfoy’s propensity to vanish at a drop of a hat poses a certain threat to this investigation. Under normal circumstances, Mr. Malfoy would be placed on house arrest until this matter is resolved – however, I am aware, that there are some unusual circumstances in this particular situation. Hence, I suggest one of you two takes responsibility for Mr. Malfoy for the time being.’ Harry and Ron groaned.
- Oh my God, how are you going to survive here then? Do you have any friends who could help? Where did you even sleep last night? – Mina was visibly shocked.
year at Hogwarts. He never wanted to be a Death Eater, he never wanted to do what he had been ordered to do then, he never wanted there to be a war. He just wanted things to be as they used to be before Voldemort came back – he wanted his peaceful, rich and respected life back. He desperately wanted to be back to being someone, without actually having to serve the Dark Lord and choose sides. Life was much easier when there were no sides to choose and he could bask in the glory of being a Malfoy in safety. But that was long gone – the war happened, “his” (although he never thought he really belonged there) side lost, Potter was once again a hero, and all it meant that now was that not only did he have to face all the people who despised what was currently covered by his sleeve, but he also that lost those who embraced him because of it. The fact that, as far as he knew, the only Slytherins that returned were Parkinson, Nott and Zabini, didn’t exactly bode well for him either.
- Easy, he doesn’t know it was for you. Pansy here was clever enough to foresee your reaction and didn’t tell him. – By now Draco was sitting next to Potter with his hand resting on the Gryffindor’s arm calmingly. He looked over his shoulder. Pansy had left, the two of them were alone.
- Uh, okay… - Harry sighed. – It’s just that… We’ve been together for some time now, and I know you are willing to wait for me, but… - He didn’t know how to put it without causing a problem. – But I thought you might loose interest, so I acted.
- I don’t remember. There is still some left if you want some. Or if you want to try and figure it out.
- On the contrary, Mr. Potter. The fact that this is the most private room available simply means that there would be fewer distractions from your former classmates to provoke, even unintentionally, any kind of tension between you two. I trust you noticed the rest of the rooms have for instance one bathroom per two rooms, whereas you and Mr. Malfoy have a luxury of having your own?
…’ He winced. Somehow, he thought he saw, for a brief second, a tinge of pain in Draco’s eyes ‘and if we fuck anything up or something isn’t up to standard, we’ll both be fired. But hey, we’ll be fine, we can do this! And the best part? Weasley’s working with Longbottom now, Chief thought we needed to be separated, so we’re flying solo.’
‘Wow, are you complimenting me right now?’ Harry registered that sober Malfoy would’ve never smiled when he said that. So, he concluded, the blonde must be as drunk as he is. ‘And how on Earth do you know what a twink is? You said you weren’t gay.’
‘Sure, of course, I’ll go see some mediocre shrink and tell him that I’ve made a guy I hated, who has been missing for months, kill himself by the virtue of my very own existence!’ Harry snapped. Ron didn’t exactly understand his best friend – if all Harry did was stumble upon Malfoy somewhere in Muggle London, why would it be his fault that Malfoy decided to off himself? There must have been something else, something more, but they went over this dozens of times by now, and Harry insisted that they only talked briefly. At some point Ron came to a conclusion that Malfoy just must have been ashamed of being seen by someone from the Wizarding community and couldn’t live with it, but it didn’t make sense why Harry would blame himself.
The feeling of Harry’s lips closing on him ripped a scream from Draco’s throat. He felt Harry smirking upon hearing him, but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered anymore, not even the fact that he was definitely not supposed to do this, because Harry’s tongue was now swirling circles around his head and Draco thought he was going to go insane. Everything was blurry, his heart was beating so fast that  he was sure he’s going to have a heart attack if this went on any longer. Like through a fog, he saw Harry’s head bobbing down and all he knew was that he was falling, falling down from somewhere out there, somewhere where Harry got him. He came crashing down when an orgasm ripped through him like a wave of hot, molten metal. He might have moaned something, but he didn’t even register it – his mind was entirely somewhere else, seeing sparks and stars and all the things he thought he would never experience again.
‘It’s ok, really. I didn’t know there was any other option back then, so it didn’t bother me.’ Harry smiled. ‘And besides, most kids in the Muggle world have some chores to do around the house, it’s just I had to do most of them.’
Draco could swear that over the groan of Weasley’s disappointment, he could hear Harry’s quiet, satisfied
‘Think logically, father.’ He quickly composed himself. ‘With all they’ve used against you, they need new evidence to keep you here. Where would they go first? My guess is – the Manor. So I’m asking, is it completely empty or do I have to go there to get rid of things they haven’t managed to find yet? I have watched the house being emptied and all the secret storage I knew about, they found. But if there is something else, something only you knew about, you have to tell me…’
- Yes, future. It’s not going to be easy, but I won’t let you go. And you can’t make me. You can try to break up with me all you want, but I’m not having any of it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still scared, I still need to work things out in my head and frankly, your display with Theo tonight does bother me, but I’m willing to let go of all of this and start fresh. If we come up with some way to put it all behind us. Do you think we can do that?
- No I wouldn’t! If you told me from the start, I would’ve never touched you! I would’ve just left! What the fuck am I supposed to do now, huh?
Inter-house unity was absolute bullshit. Whatever was McGonagall’s reasoning behind forcing the 8th year students to abandon their houses and just form one group, was absolutely and unequivocally not thought through enough. „Abolishing barriers in order to promote solidarity and peace in the Wizarding World” – what and absolute load of crap. She should’ve known better that to assume after the war everything was going to run smoothly. And even more, she should’ve known that forcing people who stood on the opposite sides (even if only in each other’s perception of things) to „unite” and try to work things out for themselves was never going to work. Malfoy sneered to himself looking at the long piece of parchment nailed to the wall next to what used to be the entrance to the Slytherin common room. HIS common room, he realized bitterly, since younger Slytherins were still allowed to remain there – the “unity programme” only applied to 8
He saw Harry drop one of his arms down, reaching for his own cock. Draco reacted on instinct, he grabbed the wrist and pulled Harry’s hand back up, locking it above his head. –
- Don’t worry about it. The night is young. You can repay me after you’ve composed yourself. – He pulled the Gryffindor close to him. They kissed for what felt like an eternity before Harry pulled back and looked at Draco hesitantly.
- Whoa, I’m scared! Can you tell how scared I am? – Ron was back to mocking Draco and Harry’s patience was wearing thin.
? He looked like he was about to blow the whole courtroom up!’ Draco was laughing, for the first time since this whole thing started.
- I’m not. I’m merely trying to provide you with the opportunity to speak your peace once and for all, without the danger of getting attacked, however justly, by my fellow Slytherins. – For the first time since they came back Malfoy seemed like his old self.
- Wait, can you explain this like a normal human being please? – Draco was irritated, but intrigued. – What’s “joined ownership of assets” and what about the house?
- It’s not like that. He changed, I know this. No, scratch that, he never was a bad person, it was just what he has been forced into. He was just trying to protect me back there.
- Well, yes and no. I enjoy taking control and giving orders, but that’s not strictly what being a dom is about. It comes out in a relationship, where I not only gain control over my partner, but also take responsibility for them. It’s more based on trust and understanding what the other person needs than simple barking orders at other people. It’s deeper than that. But I thing that it goes hand in hand with the fact that I do like being a leader to my friends, it’s a nice complement to that.
Like an out of body experience, from somewhere outside the house, through the window, he saw Ron and Neville lunging forward towards his frame on the floor and heard someone howling ‘No! Please! No!’. After that, there was just complete darkness and silence.
- What the bloody fuck are you… - Nott was shocked. He didn’t have a chance to finish his question because Draco’s lips were suddenly on his own and all logic went out the window. Alcohol took over and seconds later they were both naked, Nott on top of Draco, pushing one finger inside him.
‘I swear to God, if you finish this question, you will not get out of here alive…’ Harry’s voice was barely audible and his face was completely white. He reached for his wand and pointed it at Weasley’s face. For the first time in his life, Draco was actually terrified of Harry.
- That you’re in love with Potter! You certainly proved this last night. – Nott looked him with the same “I told you so” expression Draco received from Pansy before.
It was almost a week later that he decided to try his hand at making dessert. Harry was sitting on a kitchen table, while Draco buried his nose in a rather impressive-looking volume he found at the bottom of one of the cabinets.
‘He did. He never should’ve talked to you about this case. Why did he anyway? Was Ron right? You never answered.’
They were sitting on the living room floor, drinking Firewhisky and celebrating Draco’s acquittal, laughing like maniacs at Ron’s reaction to the verdict.
‘Well, you’ve been sort of…’ Ron hesitated ‘used by a band of snatchers running a scam, trying to convince elderly wizards that Death Eaters were on the rise again and that they, those snatchers, would provide protection against them. And they’ve been pointing you out to people as evidence.’
Two days later, it turned out that he was right. He was just getting ready for bed, when Ron and Hermione stepped into his living room. He was about to tell them to leave him alone when he saw Ron had a black eye.
They kissed again, slow and deliberate this time, like they were completely in sync, like they’ve been doing this for years and knew exactly what to do. Draco thought vaguely that he was tasting cherries on Harry’s tongue.
year, nobody asked your opinion, and last year it only escalated. And from what my instinct tells me, that is not your personality.
An hour later, he was walking alone, a couple shots of tequila in his system, when he decided to visit one of the places he used to frequent. He hasn’t been there in months, but tonight it felt like the place to be. He hailed a Muggle cab, gave the driver the address, and 10 minutes later he was greeted by the door by his favourite hostess.
But something wasn’t right. If it was just longing for another person to be there for him, why would it get triggered like that at the mention of sex? Literally anything else would do just that if it was the case. He sighed and lit a cigarette. If he was to be honest with himself he would have to face the ugly truth – on some level it was loneliness, but at this point he was so exhausted with his life, that he wasn’t even capable of human needs like companionship. No, the human need to have someone there with him was reduced to the animal need to
- And why is that? Picked up some tricks from your guru last year? It couldn’t have been much, I mean the guy didn’t seem to be able to conjure himself a nose…
- I know. But he has had it rough enough. It’s not like he’d be coming back to the life he had, that one’s long gone and nobody can do anything about it. But I was thinking, maybe if someone helped him out, he could rebuild himself, you know? Everyone deserves a second chance. I’m not talking about becoming friends with him all of a sudden, just giving him a place here and letting him get back on his feet on his own.
Harry didn’t know what to think. He just knew he had to talk to his boyfriend in private. Without a word he stood up, took Draco’s hand and led him into their bedroom.
Harry couldn’t look anymore. He closed his eyes and tried to focus on the real-life Draco still clinging onto him. He slid his hand underneath the blonde’s t-shirt and ran his fingers lightly along his spine. ‘It’s fine, it’s not your fault…’ Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s temple ‘they forced you, it’s not your fault… I’m here and I’ll stay with you… I love you, I always will, no matter what happens…’. He felt Draco’s whole body stiffening at the words.
‘Oh, you little…’ Draco didn’t finish, because his train of thought suddenly got lost in the sensation of Harry’s lips on his own and being wedged between his boyfriend’s body and the table. ‘Mmmmh, as sweet as you are, I really need to get back to this pie. If we are ever to be let out of here, we need to show my mother that we’re not going to starve to death. Otherwise, it’s living at the Manor for the rest of our lives.’ A couple of minutes and a few loud, clattering noises later Draco emerged from the pantry looking very proud of himself, holding a jar of something white. ‘I think I managed to obtain some cream!’ He exclaimed victoriously. Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
years. He sighed and turned around – it was no use standing there like an idiot, he was now forced to spend his time in the new, 8
‘Not now. I’ll explain later.’ Harry shivered, but reached into the drawer and pulled out a thin, silver knife. With a shudder, he realized that there was dried-up blood on the blade.
- Don’t speak on things of which you don’t know anything, I’m warning you. – Draco was snarling by now. For a brief second Harry was scared of him.
- No, I don’t know who’s there and I don’t know what it means. – Harry wasn’t even convincing himself, so convincing Pansy was out of the question.
‘Why are we even talking about this?’ Suddenly, Potter was looking ashamed and slightly angry. ‘Aren’t there any other topics for conversation?’
“An actually useful suggestion for once Mr.Potter. Since there are 10 levels I would pick the first hint and easiest level, then continue to the 5th hint to accurately gauge the level system.” Harry refrained from reacting to Snape's petty comment but nodded. It was as good a plan as any.
“I see you have brought by tributes! Very good my tiny, little mortals the contract is fulfilled!” Her eyes sparking in malicious delight as she spotted the six of them being offered up like a prized turkey.
“Here’s how this will work, first and foremost you are allowed to leave at any time you wish” she explained as a plain oak door appeared on the otherwise blank wall.
Somewhere in the distance a clock chimed happily, declaring the start of a new hour, but the sound only seemed to echo menacingly in Harry’s ears.
So what if it made him a freak like his relatives used to taunt, so what if he was broken. It’s not like he was going to live much longer anyway. Smiling sardonically, he ran his free hand down his chest lightly caressing the contours that his slouched body made.
“Why don't we try a hint? That way we have a place to start.” Harry suggested, bemoaning the fact that he was stuck with two of his most taboo fantasy subjects in such a situation.
“What are you doing le—let go of me!” Draco’s stuttering response to Harry’s unconscious tightening of his arms brought Harry out his lust induced stupor.
Harry and Severus both looked at Draco with new eyes. When did he become so mature? One of them must have spoken out loud because Draco responded looking annoyed.
There was nothing furnishing them except each had 1 large fluorescent light that illuminated the sparse room in an almost blinding fashion.
“I should hope you do not really think of me as a mere miscreant Lord Malwood” an eerie voice mystified the room as a floating women descended from the shadows of the room.
“Now, don’t be too hasty. The world already thinks you’re dead and as per the deal that was made, the moment one of you leaves the Dark Lord will return to the world as if he had not left.” A somber feeling washed over them as they realised none of them would dare leave, it was as good as a false hope to escape.
Harry groggily woke up. His head was pounding. A mid-afternoon light streamed in from the windows nearby.
Only one thing to do before the grand celebration they were all imaging for themselves was inform those who lives they just signed away to their duty to The Wizarding World.
“Draco!” Severus quipped, “leave it for later.” So Draco did what he did best slid his mask into place and waited for Severus to lay down before gently touching his hand.
‘I was thinking Magical Accidents, there’s apparently a lot of stuff going on there all the time, so it sounds like a good place for me.’ Draco smiled. He was feeling truly happy and serene right now. ‘But I’m still debating.’
‘And, Mr. Weasley, it is my understanding that you have not managed to present the Court with a conclusive proof of the suspect’s identity, in a form of a wand?’
- Guys, let the man talk! There’s respect to be shown for one half of our new Slytherin royal couple! – Zabini was trying not to laugh out loud.
‘Oh, come on, Draco, your mother hasn’t seen you in almost a year!’ Harry loosened. He didn’t want to admit it out loud, but ever since it was decided they were going to spend the summer with Narcissa, he was a little worried about how she would receive him. It was one thing to support her son’s relationship while they were miles away at Hogwarts, after all, but welcoming them into her home was a whole different cup of tea. But her reaction to their arrival gave Harry hope it would all be just fine.
‘I’m not. Do you seriously think I’m going to have another go at killing myself because some Muggles were kissing?’
‘Wow…’ Draco still looked shocked. ‘So we’re really doing this? How does it work from now on? I stay behind a desk while you go catch the bad guys or what? And what about Weasley? What did your boss say?’
- Well, if you put it like that, maybe we ought to help. Regardless of what he’s done, he’s one of us and we had it bad enough already.
‘Now, calm down. Drink and when you wake up I’ll send Healer Harris to talk to you.’ She practically forced the potion down his throat.
‘Honestly, I get it. I have the same thing with Grimmauld Place. It wouldn’t be right to sell it – like I would betray Sirius by it or something…’ Harry tried to shake the memory of Sirius off for now. They had a job to do. ‘Guys, how do we get in, anyway? I’m not sure I know what protection the Ministry used.’ He addressed Ron and Neville.
No need to worry them with his pathetic self loathing. He had already planned on making sure they made it through the war even if he didn’t so this really wasn't much of a change.
Harry mentally berated himself for thinking such things as he again slipped Draco’s arms out of the fabric tossing somewhere besides them.
He knew of Ginny’s crush and he silently hoped she would get over him but one selfish voice of him wanted her to remember him always. He had always been secretly jealous of the Weasleys large family and burned for one of his own.
“We best get started or we’ll stand here all night” turning to Draco, Harry muttered a brief apology before gently tapping Draco on the shoulder. Which sent him prone and spiralling into Harry’s waiting arms.  Now blinded Harry slipped to the floor with Draco in his embrace.
Draco was only in his pants now. Harry himself was having a hard time staying calm; after all there was a soon to be naked man situated in his lap.
Harry took a deep breath and looked back at Draco, fuck. He might not like the prick but he certainly didn’t deserve what Harry did to him.
That’s when Harry belatedly realized that his glamours weren’t working. 17 years of  the Dursley's not so tender love and care came into view on his exposed torso. Well there goes any normal he could have had, soon they would both know he was a freak.
“As much as I loath to say this, but we must continue.” Severus looked at his God-son with apprehension, knowing his body was in just as bad if not worse shape than Harry’s. What a group they made. Draco only nodded, still looking a bit dazed no doubt rethinking every interaction with Harry to see if he had missed something telling. He probably had.
“We are a pretty lie, Potter. Always have been. We are bred for the use of powerful men. Our hunger for power and prestige makes us pawns. My father doesn’t like to admit it, but we are.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione whispered, her hand coming up to wipe away the tears he hadn’t realised were running down his cheeks.
Harry watched her go, swallowing the exhaustion and fear down. She was already using past tense for her son.
Harry didn’t feel guilty about ending the Malfoy’s, but he felt guilty about cutting Draco’s future short. The Malfoy’s would fade from the wizarding world with the death of the sole heir. Harry fancied that Draco would find it liberating after all those years of manipulation and expectation.
“Nobody will look for him.” Harry said, abruptly realising what they were doing, looking up at his friends where they stood around Draco. “Nobody will care.”
“Harry, what’s going on?” She whispered, still gripping his shoulder. Ron stood behind him, waiting.
Harry felt the despair rise up inside him, unbridled and unrestrained. It gathered in his throat, choking him and making his eyes sting fiercely.
A slither of the rising sun from outside had cast itself through the gap in the door, running up the wall and across Malfoy’s face, catching one of his eyes.
He quickly placed Draco at the bottom of the grave, the soil moist and cold where it brushed his bare skin. It wasn’t nice, but at least it was soft. They had no coffin for Draco, only a lonely hole and a bed of dirt.
“Voldemort treated him like a slave, held my mother hostage and kept me locked up like an insurance plan.”
The curse was on the tip of Harry’s tongue, the magic welling up in his core in response; but then he looked Malfoy in the eyes.
They were never truely enemies, not in the ways that mattered. It seemed so cruel to realise that now. It was too late.
“Why don’t you just jump off the bridge if you want to die, Malfoy?” He hissed as he pushed Malfoy’s hands away from his shoulders, pinning them to the floor. It brought their faces closer than he would have liked, but at least it stopped the annoying punches and scratches.
And it just made so much sense, now that Harry thought about it. The Malfoy’s were loyal, and Voldemort could keep the youngest Malfoy on a tight leash. Keep him close like he did the snake, a secret Horcrux that nobody would think of.
He had to. He had even more reason now. If he did not die now, in this forrest, Draco’s sacrifice would not have been worth it. None of this would have been worth it, and Draco would have simply been another teenager to die in this war.
“Maybe, Potter.” He said, but the humour died as suddenly as it came. Malfoy looked at his muggle watch under his tattered sleeve.
“He didn’t stop me from getting the mark, Harry.” Malfoy responded, tone suddenly dry, like he’d attempted for humorous and fell short. There were faint rustling sounds as he did back up his shirt. “My mother didn’t know what he did until it was over, but my Father was happy. He thought it was a honour to the Malfoy’s.”
Harry couldn’t take much more of this. He didn’t recognise the person in front of him, and he didn’t know if he could take knowing why. Was Malfoy always like this behind the front of anger and pride he put on for the school and his father? Or did the war change him?
Malfoy but his lip, and looked away. He stared out the window into the rapidly brightening sky, worrying his top teeth over his bottom lip. Harry had never seen him do that before, showed emotion like that, and it shocked him into silence as Malfoy gathered his thoughts.
“You are a Gryffindor, Neville Longbottom. Remember that.” It was a double meaning, one he hoped Neville would understand. The hat would help him, if he remembered who he was. Harry couldn’t tell him anymore because if any legilimens got into his head, they’d have no chance.
“It was when I got my mark. I didn’t realise until recently. I thought all the darkness and the visions of him were because of the mark. I was unconscious from the pain of getting the mark, and he’d brought in a Mudblood and killed them to do it.”
He cried silently, blinking away the tears as he continued to run a hand through a Draco’s hair, like the affection could somehow reach his soul and...soothe it.
They moved in silence, only the sounds of their footsteps in the dirt and the distant sounds of birds accompanied them. They walked past the edge of the garden, where only hours earlier Harry and Draco had exchanged blows, the dirt still scuffed where where Harry had held Draco down in that fit of anger, hating Draco for being the last person he’d ever see before he died.
It would become a proverb, a story to tell small children. “Don’t be elitist or you’ll end up like the Malfoy’s.” Harry was content with the legacy it left, for there would be no other blood war. Harry was glad for that, at least.
But when his toe hit something soft, he stopped, almost tripped in the sudden halt of his body. His legs locked, his breath locked halfway up his throat.
“Mrs Malfoy?” He asked, turning to face her. She looked small, so frail and worn. Her clothes were as dirty as her sons, torn and scuffed around the edges. But her chin was held high, her poise still held strong. He looked down at her wrists, they were magically bound.
“That’s different.” Harry said, and tried to ignore the feeling of Malfoy’s heart beating wildly against his hands. He hid it well, but his heart didn’t lie. He was scared.
“I’m sorry too.” He said, and it wasn’t enough. He wanted to tell Malfoy he was sorry for the rejection, the judgment, the othering, the isolation, the hate... and everything else. Their history had been so bitter, both sides fighting for the sake of it.
Ron grunted a bit at the uncomfortable position and he leant over to pass Harry the body, but otherwise silence ruled as Harry steadily took Draco’s limp weight. Ron let go slowly as Harry got an arm under Draco’s back and the other under his thighs.
Malfoy always met people’s eyes. He never looked away, as though doing so would make him weak. Not once in his life had Malfoy refused to look him in the eyes when they’d been near each other.
“Look at me, Malfoy.” Harry said, because it was too strange otherwise. He needed a sense of normality.
And Harry abruptly realised that this was probably what Voldermort wanted. If he was going to lose, he wanted them to destroy themselves to do it. To kill a young wizard for the sake of the war, to taint themselves with his blood in order to win.
His dismissal only seemed to make Malfoy more angry, more upset. His voice was thick with emotion when he cried out.
Harry just stood there, still as though he was stupefied, as he watched Malfoy shift unsurely on his feet, looking around as though he was expecting something. Malfoy’s wand burned in his pocket, like it was sensing its master.
Harry bit his lip until it stung something fierce, focusing on his breathing to stop himself from screaming.
He stepped into the garden, walked past the gouges in the unattended soil where he and Draco had fought and scuffled earlier. He walked up to the door, just reaching for the handle when the pain stopped working, stopped distracting him. He froze, hand reaching out but no further.
Harry threw his wand away, worried the git would grab it and use it on him. Malfoy always fought dirty, and he didn’t want to be on the pointy end of his own wand. They tussled on the floor, exchanging punches and scratches like muggle children. Malfoy managed to roll on top of him, before Harry grabbed his hair and yanked it, forcing the older boy off him. He climbed over the other, digging his knees cruelly into Malfoy’s abdomen and chest, using his weight to hold him down. Malfoy was tall in the elegant way all the Malfoy’s were, but he was thin under Harry. Thinner than Harry remembered from before the war. Harry idly realised that whilst he only got stronger living rough and fighting hard in the war, Malfoy had got thinner and weaker.
She must have linked Narcissa’s behaviour with Harry’s revelation. He realised that she had assumed that Draco was still alive, and that Voldemort had a chance to come back. He turned around, and yanked open the door before he could stop himself. He stepped into the room without looking inside, standing aside and letting them in.
“My mother. Voldemort threatened her life, if I failed to succeed.” Malfoy replied, voice firm and soft.
“Your mother sent you here to die, Malfoy.” He said, because he was bitter, and in his opinion in she didn’t deserve Malfoy’s undying love. She didn’t protect him so why should he protect her?
In the quiet moments, when it was just him in the darkness of his own thoughts, he hoped Draco was too.
Out the corner of his eye, Hagrid’s hut caught his attention away from his spiralling thoughts; sitting quietly on the edge of the forrest. He didn’t notice when his direction down the hill had shifted to bring him closer to the building. He stopped where he stood, about twenty metres away from the the hut, cloak settling around his feet on the dewey morning grass.
Harry leant forward, and pressed a hand against Neville’s chest. Over his heart. It silenced Neville.
He stood, unsure of what else to do. His legs were flat and his arms where on his stomach, head rested back on the soft soil. Harry’s hands fidgeted for a moment, restless and increasingly anxious. What else could do? Was there something else he should be doing? He didn’t know how to bury someone. The only experience he had was Dobby, and Dobby wasn’t a fully grown wizard.
He knew what he had to do, and he couldn’t let anyone stop him. He couldn’t stop. Couldn’t say goodbye. They would find out, eventually. Harry knew how it felt to not be able to say goodbye, but he hoped they wouldn’t hate him for taking away their chance.
To some it would seem and easy choice, as another death eater would die for the good of the war. But Harry was done weighing up people’s lives like pawns.
In the back of his head, the constant ringing. He hadn’t realised, so wrapped up in the anger and the fear the last few days. He’d been too busy fighting off Voldemort in his head, worrying about his friends. He hadn’t heard it.
“You really intend to listen to this hogwash minister? It’s obvious this is just miscreants idea of a joke” an exhausted Wilkan Malwood stated to the equally exasperated room.
Not that any of the men were truly paying any attention to their surroundings. Mostly their minds were occupied by the overwhelming feeling of still being alive.
Harry’s brain did what it usually did in such situations, shut down. He distantly felt Snape tense under him, but he didn’t really care all he heard was the rushing in his ears as his mind slowly floated away.
Harry, Draco and Severus glanced at each other as the goddess’ voice departed. What could they possibly have in common?
Harry shushed him “ it’s alright I’ve got you, I’m sorry for starting you. I’m going to start now if that’s ok?” Harry asked, the world now completely dark. Draco just gave a curt yes before Harry started taking charge of the situation and began to spread his hands out over Draco’s chest to find the clasp of his robes.
“I know it won’t be enough ok? But maybe it might make it better” Harry said, still looking at the ground.
The darkness seemed to meld with her; flowing black hair, piercing coal eyes, skin a parlor of deep gray, and swathed in hues of dark amber, she looked as many would liken a goddess.
The past 48 hours for Harry Potter were in one word hectic. He had received no less than what seemed like thousands of letters; Grimmauld Place had filled to the brim with them. Each one some sick variation of thanks for offing yourself for us, we are grateful blah, blah, blah.
‘Potter, don’t make me laugh.’ Draco scoffed, offended. ‘Me? Forced to do something? Have you not seen me duel?’
- Well, ok… - Harry decided that a different perspective might help him. After all, Ron didn’t need to know the whole story. – Sit down, it’s a long one. You know how Malfoy disappeared after his parents’ trial?
- Do you really want me to be the one to do that? Or is it just the idea that appeals to you? – He was hesitant, but he tried his best to word his concerns in a way that wouldn’t upset Harry.
‘How do you think he even pulled that off?! After it took three days of deliberations to even get him acquitted in the first place? What was Kingsley thinking?’ Ron was in clear disbelief, shaking his head over a copy of
- Well… - Hermione spoke hesitantly. – If he has enough privileges to still send letters, it’s really all he needs…
- What the fuck, Malfoy? Are you trying to kill me? What was that? – It was safe to assume Potter was fine. He wouldn’t be able to yell at Draco like he did if the antidote didn’t work.
Silence fell between them as they smoked. It wasn’t exactly uncomfortable, but Harry felt something weird, something like longing, rising in him. He decided he needed a drink.
- It’s obvious. Malfoy is still, and if you ask me, he will always be, what he is. He was always a bully and last year he probably became even worse. You can’t change that, not even with whatever the two of you are doing in your room.
‘It’s been empty this entire time.’ Harry said as quietly as the wind would allow. ‘The lawyers took it, but the Ministry sealed it and wouldn’t let them do anything until we’re completely certain it’s safe. They’ve been paying insane amounts of money in damages because of how long it’s been taking, actually.’
‘Oh, that’s such a cool job… Although I would’ve thought you’d be more of a law enforcement kind of person. Well, you never know, right?’ She flashed them a bright smile and pushed still sulking Dean out onto the street. ‘Write to me, guys, as soon as you get settled in London!’ She shouted before shutting the door.
‘Because you’re idiots. And besides, from what I gathered, you didn’t exactly have a plan in place. ‘Find them and destroy them’ is not a plan, Potter. No, this is different, they clearly know who they are going to target and they are knocking them off one by one…’
. Treat it as a trial period. If anything goes wrong or isn’t done according to proper procedures, you will both be fired, do we understand each other?’
- I’m not always like that. I mean, you’re right, I normally don’t go too far if I’m the top… - He hesitated. – Apart from that night with you, Harry. It was the first time I lost control like that. But anyway, how far I wanted Theo to take it is not how I normally do it. It was just that I needed the pain to pay for what I’ve done. It wasn’t even about getting off, being hurt like that was the goal, not the means to an end.
- No, Hermione, it’s a good thing I know how he feels. – Harry said bitterly. – I thought you were both supportive of me, but it’s good to know who I can count on.
‘Oh, that he was… When the snatchers said they had no idea who you were I thought he was going to curse them! Oh, that was glorious. Shame you didn’t get to see this, it was comical really. What were you doing for all that time anyway?’
- Yeah, I guess so. I think I owe Theo an explanation for my actions tonight. – He turned around to go into the bedroom and all of them gasped. There was a long, red gash along Draco’s spine. It would’ve looked like he was sliced with a knife if not for the fact that the edges seemed burned.
- no, not that voice again! He was in no shape to talk to himself right now, he needed to get rid of that voice immediately. Ok, breathe in, breathe out, focus. You’re into women and Malfoy, that much is safe to assume. But what about other guys? Harry tried to imagine his other friends in this particular scenario. Neville, Seamus, Dean, Ron… Oh God, not Ron! No, definitely nothing.
‘Then it’s settled.’ Narcissa stated. ‘Harry, you’re applying to the Auror office, and Draco will try at St. Mungo’s. Oh boys, I’m so proud of you both… When did you even become old enough to think about your careers?’ Suddenly, she started crying with emotion.
This thought was somehow very disturbing to Harry – how on Earth did he notice that? Why was Malfoy’s diet embedded in his brain enough for him to access it like that? He didn’t pay attention to the git after all. He decided he must’ve registered the lack of tension which usually subconsciously indicated the presence of the blonde and that was how he knew when he wasn’t in the Great Hall at meal time. Yes, that must have been it. There was no need to overanalyse this.
‘You did WHAT?! Do you have any idea what this means?! You just blew this whole thing! I’m going over there and telling him that at this point it’s either me or you! He gives Draco a job and I stay or I’m quitting!’
‘You’re telling me I slept next to Voldemort’s possessions for years? What’s inside? And how do you open it?’ He was raising his voice.
If there’s time, save Draco first.’ Harry was deliberately not looking at him to not give him a chance to object. ‘I have a bigger chance of surviving whatever might attack us than he does, I have more experience with dealing with things like these.’ Without waiting for another word from the rest of the group, Harry turned to face the wall and hissed the command.
?!’ Potter followed him and now he was hovering over Draco like an annoyed parent. ‘Are you suicidal?!’ Suddenly, Potter’s gaze fell to the razor on the table. He picked it up. ‘WHAT IS THIS?!’
‘I told you, I don’t know.’ Harry sighed. ‘I just have this feeling that something is off. Will you tell me if anything weird starts popping up?’
Summer was nearing an end and Draco was getting more and more nervous about his job prospects. He had sent the required paperwork almost immediately after getting his references, but August was almost over and he hasn’t received any response yet.
‘God, I’d never tell you this if I was sober, but…’ Draco didn’t look at him. It was clear he was embarrassed. ‘but yeah. I mean, I saw you in that towel that time and…’
- More or less. Usually they would ask if you have a clientele you attract, you know, to see if you’ll be a good fit for their profile, but since you haven’t done this before it’s not an issue.
‘Last I checked, they were testing antidote combinations. We don’t know what that potion was, there is no sample, so the healers can’t curate an antidote for it.’
- MALFOY?! What the fuck?! – Harry bellowed. Draco suddenly felt a wave of cold brush over him. His glamour and self-transfiguration have been lifted.
‘More or less. Ironic, isn’t it?’ Hermione smiled a little. ‘But it does pose a threat. It won’t work indefinitely, there is a limited, well, supply, of dark magic within you, so when it runs out you’ll be exposed to what should’ve happened in the first place. Once the Dark Mark is gone, you’ll start bleeding normally and that is when we have a serious problem.’
‘No, it has a paper bag inside where the dirt collects. When the bag is full you take it out, throw it out and put a fresh one.’
- It was, he shouldn’t have inserted himself there. Seamus wasn’t offended by Malfoy’s comment, he actually found it funny. It wasn’t Ron’s business. But even so, what Malfoy did was way out of line. Turns out you can get out of being a Death Eater but you can’t get the Death Eater out of you.
was it anyway? He has slept with women, that much would imply he’s not entirely gay. But then again, that kiss proved that he was into blokes as well.
Draco decided to write to his mother again, asking her about her financial situation should his father really stop supporting both of them in the face of his relationship with Harry. He told Narcissa about the plan they’ve set in place in case she was to be evicted from the Manor and hoped she would agree to move in with the two of them if she needed to. It was 3 days before the end of the year when he got a response.
Harry was lying there, on the floor, next to him, his head propped up on his arm, looking down at him. They locked eyes and Draco could swear he has never seen anything nearly as beautiful – he could get lost in these eyes for ever, just being there, and nothing would make him go back to reality. But, just as every good moment in his miserable life, even this had to come to an end when he wasn’t even remotely ready for it. This time, the end came in the form of Weasley opening the door.
‘From what period of time, Minister?’ Draco looked calm and collected, but Harry could feel his hand trembling. He knew that if Minister asked for anything after the war, he could find out what Draco did in the Muggle world.
Through the sound of distant cheering of the group of Slytherins by the Lake and the feeling of pure bliss that seemed to hug them both in a pleasant mist, neither of them heard a muffled “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!” that came from the direction of the castle, where Ron stood rooted to the spot in pure disbelief.
Since everyone was looking at them suspiciously as soon as they stepped out the common room 15 minutes later, Harry and Draco figured it’s no use trying to hide they were together. Draco took Harry’s hand in his own and they confidently marched down into the dungeons for potions. Even though they both felt safe together, they decided that they’re going to stick to their original potions’ partners for now, so Harry was working with Neville, while Draco sat with Pansy on the other side of a narrow space between the tables.
‘Minister…’ his voice was still hoarse from crying ‘I’m sorry, but I can’t go back there… I can’t face all that happened. I know… I know that what you saw is not enough, but… but I can’t see the rest with you. It gets worse… I…’ he clung to Harry again, hiding his face from the other men ‘I killed that man. They made me.’ The tears came back and Harry instinctively pulled him closer.
- I think I should be the one to explain this, actually. – Nott looked up at Draco searching for permission. When Draco nodded, he continued. – I never said I wasn’t into it, I said Draco takes it much further than I do. At least on the receiving end of things. – He sighed. – Merlin, I would’ve never thought I’d be explaining my sex life to my friend’s boyfriend, let alone with an audience, but here we go: we both like hurting people during sex. Now, don’t panic just yet, it’s not like getting fucked without lube or getting sliced up is a normal occurrence for either of us, tonight was way beyond anything I have personally ever done to another person. When I said we’re “not compatible” I meant that when Draco’s the top everything is, well, pretty normal, at least for people like us. There is some pain, because that’s what we like, but he hasn’t done anything I wouldn’t agree to or I would regret agreeing to. There wasn’t any serious or permanent damage, if you know what I mean. And I knew he wouldn’t go further without my permission. Now, when we switched, it was a whole different story. I don’t know if it was this particular situation, both those 2 years ago and tonight, or if he’s always like that, that’s for him to explain, but he wanted much more pain and, well, frankly, abuse, than I was comfortable with. Honestly, I don’t know if I should or shouldn’t be telling you this, but the only reason he ended up with only that one gash tonight, is because I forced myself to come earlier than I would’ve normally, because I could feel he wanted more than that. – Silence fell over the group. Everyone was looking at their own hands not knowing how to react. It took a couple of seconds for Draco to speak.
‘Draco Lucius Malfoy, do you mean to tell me that you have proposed and it was not the first thing out of your mouth when you saw me?!’
Oh, and side note: That book I was refrencing I just came up with, although Draught of Peace actually exists within the HP universe in case you wondered.
- Pansy, it’s not his fault. – Through Pansy’s screaming nobody heard Draco and Nott come into the room. Harry saw instantly how much of a bad state Draco was in. Both his face and eyes were red, like he had been crying for quite some time now, and he was even skinnier than usual, his sweatpants nearly falling off of him. The skin on his chest acquired a grey tinge and his stomach looked like he hasn’t eaten for days. – I was the one to break it off.
‘So, Harry, what now?’ She asked looking around hesitantly. ‘We’re in London, but how are we going to get to the Diagon Alley?’
‘And in simpler English, please?’ Draco understood Harry perfectly, but some part of him wanted to hear it again.
‘You can do this, and you will. You have to. Besides, at least you know how this things go, you’ve seen it first-hand.’
That was all it was. He just needed that one thing to fill the void and Potter was just there. He laughed bitterly. An hour ago he was sure he went through all the vices there were – yet, he forgot about that last one, the most powerful of them all. And he should’ve known better, after all his history was littered with mistakes like that and their consequences. And it was those consequences that made him decide that however much he thought he needed it, he was never going to actually act on it – he has proven time and time again that it was a bad idea when a guy was gay and there was no chance of seeing him again. When Potter was not only straight, but also in the same apartment, the outcome would be catastrophic.
- Stop being stupid. – Pansy was getting angry. – You know whose room that is, you know what happened in Charms and you know the history. It’s obvious what happened and if you had half a brain cell you’d know why it did.
It took them at least 30 minutes to achieve something even remotely similar to what the picture in the book showed. And by that point, hey had what they estimated roughly to be enough dough for at least four pies. Nevertheless, Draco found a pie tin, lined it with their (rather abysmal, he concluded) creation and threw it into the oven. He was determined to make this work, even if it meant running out of all the necessary ingredients. His determination quickly received a swift blow, however, when he turned his attention to what was supposed to be whipped cream by now. It turned out the white substance hasn’t changed whatsoever.
And yet, not even a week later, Potter was back in room 20, biting Draco’s nipples and fucking him senseless, while Draco was doing his best to imagine that he’s having sex with somebody, anybody else. He became quite good in faking pleasure and orgasms, so he usually wasn’t worried he would disappoint his clients, but with Potter it was different. Yasmine was a master in moaning encouragements - Draco wasn’t. And as soon as Potter came through the door, Yasmine was nowhere to be found and Draco had to face another night being Potter’s toy completely alone. He felt the man getting close to orgasm, so he decided it was time to put on his best show. Arching his back and holding his breath he entangled his hand in Potters hair and pulled him up, forcing him to look at Draco’s face.
