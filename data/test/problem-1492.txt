“Because I know what it’s called and how to get there and I don’t know what’s near where I currently live.”
But he is getting ahead of himself. There will be time enough to discuss this with the others once he has reunited Ron and Hermione.
“Oh, the potion’s fine,” Draco said, waving at the cauldron dismissively. “Tell me who you’re planning to be!”
“Dunno,” he said through a mouthful of sausages. “Hopefully what job I’ll have after school. Then I’ll know if I took the right subjects for my N.E.W.T.s.” Harry nodded absently. He was hoping he might see the outcome of his fighting Voldemort, but at the same time, he was worried that it would show him a future where he had died.
“I’m going to take this cue to leave,” Neville said. He stood up and went back inside. Once there, he marched with purpose over to where Claudia and Cormac were dancing amongst a group of Hufflepuffs. Then he did as Draco had said and tapped her on the shoulder.
you love him?” Pansy asks. She leans forward and stares at Draco. “And don’t change the subject this time.”
Harry’s hand made its way south until it reached Malfoy’s arse. He rested it there, his stomach thrilling at the contact. Then, gently, he squeezed it.
“It’s ok,” Harry said through gritted teeth. His shoulders were hunched in pain. “I just need to use more of the ointment. Would you mind fetching it from my bag?” Draco nodded.
Draco peels off his coat, letting it fall to the floor, and pushes his hands inside Massi’s, struggling to get the jacket off in as smooth of a manner as Harry had yesterday.
“I just mean, we had a fun afternoon, and now it feels like there’s nothing left to do tonight except wait for bedtime.”
“Ron, Hermione,” Harry began to count them off on his fingers. “Seamus, Dean, Neville — so all of the Gryffindor boys — Blaise, Pansy, Ernie, Justin, Colin.” He stopped. He thought that was everyone and said as much. Draco looked around the room.
“Lads,” he says. He drops Pansy’s hand and Pansy finds herself more annoyed at the pair than she ever has been before. Of course, they’re harmless, but right now, they are the enemy. So she quietly pulls out her wand and sends a silent trip jinx their way. In the ensuing scuffle, she grabs Greg’s hand and pulls him first into a standing position and then down the corridor and into another room.
“Can it wait? I’m busy.” To make her point, Pansy turns back to the punching bag and hits it with a sharp jab.
Draco bites his lip nervously for a moment but then does as she asks, gulping down the water in one go. She takes the glass from him and hands it to Harry. Harry leaves the room and Draco isn’t sure if he is glad about this or not. He glances instead at Pansy who is lounging against the wall behind Granger. She flashes him a thumbs up.
“Mistress Narcissa is sick. Medi-wizard Burlington is here and will give you the details.” There’s a scuffling noise on the other end of the phone and then another voice is bellowing down the phone.
“Yeah,” Seamus said. He started to move away, but Justin grabbed his hand. He turned back in time for Justin to peck him quickly on the cheek before walking quickly into the Great Hall. Seamus put a hand up to his cheek and blushed. He shook himself. He was getting soft. Although, the image of Justin walking away, or more accurately, the shape of Justin’s arse as he walked way, lingered in Seamus’s mind for long moments before he followed the other man into the Great Hall.
“There’s something strange going on,” he says. His voice is quiet and it is clear to Pansy that he is scared of being overheard, even when there’s no one around.
In hindsight, should Ron have been surprised that Hermione had spelled her bag to be able to carry more? No, he should not. But he was all the same. She never ceased to amaze him.
“Can’t say I blame her.” Hermione gives him a small smile. Harry sighs and leans back in his chair. Most of the anger he had been feeling is gone now, and he’s rather ashamed of the way that he kicked McLaggen out of the Cooler. “So what is the Simurgh Society up to anyway?” Hermione shakes her head.
“It feels weird. Like it’s alive or has its own tiny heartbeat.” Draco frowned at him and snatched the diadem out of his hands. He glared at it, lifted it up to look at it more closely, and held it up to his ear before lowering it again.
He was starting to lose track of who knew about them. Neville, Colin and now Justin? Blaise and Hermione were right. They really
“I didn’t mean anything by it,” Blaise said quickly. “I wouldn't either. I just wondered if you Gryffindors weren’t as shiny as your reputation would have us all believe.”
“Uh,” Harry said. “Yes, what he said.” Colin gulped and scrambled off of the bed. He handed his camera to Harry who placed it on a side table.
“-And anyway, didn’t you start Dumbledore’s Army last year? Isn’t that kind of the same thing?” Ron asked, cutting him off.
“I can’t believe you’re real,” Harry said, reaching out to take Draco’s proffered hand. Draco pulled him upright.
“He said he will work on it as soon as he’s killed Harry Potter.” It took every ounce of Harry’s self control not to flinch at that. “He says he doesn’t have time to research my condition right now.” Harry wasn’t sure if a snake could sound bitter, but if it could, she certainly did. She was still looking away from him, occasionally flicking her tail.
“Potter, I didn’t know you were so kinky,” Pansy said. She winked at him and he felt his face blush scarlet.
“Well obviously I’m not.” Draco does not know why McLaggen keeps bringing this up. Perhaps he is in the closet himself. Or maybe he’s just homophobic.
“Literally, whatever’s open.” Ron nods and picks up the half full bottle of red that’s sitting on the counter near the sink. He walks over to a cabinet and pulls down two stemless wine glasses before uncorking the bottle and pouring two heavy pours of wine. He hands one of the glasses to Draco.
“Brilliant,” Ron said in a loud whisper. Harry looked around Draco and grinned at Ron. Pansy rolled her eyes.
“Why are you bartending at all?” Harry asked. “I would have thought that you would think this was beneath you.”
“I’m sorry,” he says. “I should have told you. I should have found a way to bring it up.” He takes another deep breath. “And I should have done it before we took our clothes off.”
With Pansy’s introduction out of the way, Big Dick goes on to the rest of the announcements, and Draco mostly tunes him out. Something to do with them expecting a continued stream Hogwarts students. He sidles up to Pansy.
“Merlin, don’t get your knickers in a twist,” McLaggen says, but he performs the cooling charm anyway.
Wednesday dawns dark and cold as it is the midst of winter. But either way, Harry, Draco and Massi sleep late. Massi, technically, is still unconscious, but that is not the point. The point is that Harry and Draco actually get a good night’s rest for the first time that week. They finally stir around ten in the morning when a beam of light makes its way through a gap in the curtains and hits Harry in the face.
“I see,” Draco says. He picks another shirt off of the floor and carries it over to the closet. He can almost feel Potter’s eyes on him and he resists the urge to look over at him.
“I understand that Mr. Malfoy was in your year at school,” Dempsey says. She looks up from her stack of papers. Pansy frowns, thinking for a moment that the General is referring to Malfoy Senior, but she realizes her error and nods.
“The house elves won’t let me learn,” Draco says once Potter’s attention is back on him. “Not after the tiny fire I started with the pasta.”
Draco is shit out of luck as it turns out. Not because he has to miss the opening of La Scala but because they run into Massi the following evening in the VIP area of a night club. Draco had wanted to dance the night away with Harry, but now they have to make small talk with the dickhead who thought he could take advantage of Draco.
“As in, do I think they’re secretly fucking? Yes.” Pansy suddenly seemed to remember that Hermione was on the other side of Blaise and looked uncomfortably over at her. Blaise’s mouth had fallen open into a small o and Hermione was doing her best to keep a straight face as she stared back at the both of them.
Hannah waves to Draco and Greg as they enter the Cauldron and immediately begins to pull a couple of pints for them.
She took his hands and placed one on her hip and held the other out. Before he could protest, she began leading him in some sort of fast dance, where he mostly seemed to stand still while she moved around him. And it was like she projected the dance moves into his brain, because he barely thought about what he was doing - he just moved with her and with the music.
“You seem distracted,” Greg says. He and Draco are restocking the cooking magic section of Flourish and Blotts and Draco is doing more staring into the distance than stocking of shelves. This is in part due to the fact that he is tired - he usually has Mondays off, but Big Dick called everyone into the store with only three days to go until Christmas - and in part due to the fact that he is, against all odds, worried about Granger.
“That’s an awfully long apology,” Ron said. Hermione quickly buried her head in her hands to try to hide the fact that she had burst into laughter. “What?” Ron asked.
“Oh shut up,” Harry mumbles, leaning back in his seat. He takes a large sip of his wine to hide his displeasure but in reality he’s pleased that Draco and Ron appear to be getting along, particularly if he’s going to bring Draco to Christmas dinner.
He should have expected it, but Harry was still surprised when Lucius Malfoy appeared in the corridor he was in. Harry knew that there’d been a breakout at Azkaban, but even that knowledge hadn’t prepared him to see Draco’s dad, haggard, with knotted, dirty hair, brandishing a wand at him.
“I think I have something that will help,” he blurted out before he could think better of the idea. Everyone turned to look at him. “I have a map of Hogwarts.”
“What?” Ron asks. His voice is loud with worry. A pink flush makes its way up Susan’s face. She glances quickly around the room.
“Oh, go on,” Harry says. “Why not?” Draco glowers at him, but Harry just smiles blithely back at him. With a grumble, he acquiesces, scribbling his name near Harry’s. He resists adding a ‘fuck you’ to it. Barely. Luca punches the air, flushed with success, and runs off to show Joe. Draco glares at his retreating back. When he turns back to Harry, the brunet is laughing.
It doesn’t take Massi long to finish and shortly the woman stands up, wiping her mouth. Massi tucks himself back into his trousers and indicates that they should go dance. Draco doesn’t need asking twice. He quickly downs the rest of his drink and follows Harry and Massi onto the dance floor.
While the six of them were still getting some strange looks from the rest of the student body, they had emboldened others to sit wherever they wanted. Neville was an almost constant fixture at the Hufflepuff table, having officially starting dating Claudia - the girl who none of the rest of them had heard of until Neville had introduced them. Ron still wasn’t one hundred percent sure which one she was.
“Yes,” Dumbledore said. “I was getting to that. Do you remember when I showed you all the memory of Riddle in the orphanage?” They had all gone pensieve diving during the past few hours. “I had been working with Patterson on the problem of horcruxes, and we figured that cave was as good a place as any for Voldemort to want to hide one of them.” He paused, looking around at them sadly. “Jonathan got it into his head that he should attempt to retrieve it alone.”
He even fills out the paperwork for the Assistant Manager position that Big Dick keeps droning on about. He doesn’t particularly want it, but if he’s going to have more flexibility with his timetable and more of an excuse to stay at the store for his cover, it’s something he needs to do.
“Obviously.” Potter narrows his eyes and glares at Draco, but there is no venom in it. In fact, Draco can see the ghost of smirk on Potter’s face. Draco sticks out his tongue in playful response. He nearly bites it in his haste to put it back in his mouth. He is horrified at his behavior. What is he
“Fetch my wand and some veritaserum,” Massi tells the elf, who nods and disapparates with a loud crack.
“Yes. No. I don’t know,” Draco said. He frowned at Harry and then flounced over to the couch and threw himself down on it. He crossed his arms across his chest and glared up at Harry. Harry wasn’t sure what to do, so he went and sat down next to Draco. Draco turned his torso so that they were facing each other. “What?”
“No, I’m not,” Harry says quickly, even as he sees Draco’s jaw go slack, which means that Pansy sees Draco’s jaw go slack in the reflection. Harry can see the moment that she realizes what she’s said is true. She closes her eyes, clearly summoning patience, before opening them again.
“But you get to be this cool sexy guy, who saves the world from aliens, and I'm the bald asshole who threatens to blow everyone up.”
“-Well, don’t. You’ll stay right there.” Potter nods and nervously crosses his legs. Draco is secretly pleased that Potter won’t be leaving him alone just yet.
Harry groaned. He didn’t want to work with Draco right now. He knew Draco couldn’t have had anything to do with the attack, but he figured it was more than likely that his family had been. He felt sick. In the last two or so weeks of their dating, Harry had pushed aside all thoughts of the senior Malfoys and their psycho boss. But no good thing could last forever. Reality always seeped back in. He and Draco were going to have to have those difficult conversations that they had been skirting.
Harry feels as though a great weight has been lifted off of his shoulders. He hadn’t meant to tell Draco about his feelings for him, but the moment had come up and Harry couldn’t bear to hurt him again with a lie. He knows they need to talk about this more - it’s complicated after all - but at least now Draco knows that when Harry holds his hand, it’s because he likes him and not because he feels like he has to keep up a charade.
“Fair point,” he says instead. Then he closes the gap between them, pressing his mouth to Harry’s. Harry’s lips part and Draco slips his tongue inside Harry’s mouth. Harry moans softly and Draco slips a hand behind his head, tangling his fingers in Harry’s hair. Harry gently maneuvers them until Draco is pressed up against a pile of boxes.
“It’s not what it looks like,” Harry spluttered before Snape could say anything. He grabbed one of the cushions off of the sofa and held it over his lap, careful not to touch anything with it.
And yet, when she had knocked on Potter’s door this morning, she could have sworn that Draco had been naked in the bed behind him. But that can’t have been right, could it? She had only seen a flash of Draco before Potter had obstructed her view, so perhaps she was leaping to conclusions. And if there was one thing that had been drilled into her since day one of Hit Wizard training, it was not to jump to conclusions.
Malfoy drew in a deep breath “these are the clothes im wearing for tonight” he said wearily “ you really don't listen to me when i speak to you do you? Not about anything that actually has to do with me.”
“If that was true” Harry spat coldly “then i’d never even have gotten together with you given how much they dont even like you after everything you did to them.”
He touched as freely as any Weasley ever had, which had been an odd thing to find out. The first time he had laid his arm across the back of the booth they had been sharing, only to run his fingers through Harry’s hair absentmindedly had frozen Harry on the spot. Parkinson and Goyle had not batted an eye, but Harry had seen Ron blinking owlishly at them while Hermione had a considering look on her face. Later when it had been Harry’s turn to get up for the next round he had come back to find Malfoy in the same position on the other side of the booth, and Goyle had been the newest recipient of the long fingers in his hair. Harry had tried not to let his face show the disappointment he felt.
When they drew up Harry moved to pull out Malfoys chair, but he had already moved around to the other side of the table and pulled out his own seat. Harry kicked himself for not moving sooner. He took off his jacket casting a subtle look at Malfoy, smiling when he saw the man sweep his gaze over his the way his shirt stretched over his chest and shoulders.
“And who’s fault was that huh?!” he hissed at him through clenched teeth trying and failing to reign in his anger.
Ron cast his patronus, bringing up his favorite image of a topless Draco sitting on their bed with two red haired infants between his legs making funny faces at them. The look on Draco’s face when they laughed for the first time never failed to bring forth a blindingly bright, giant bullmastiff. The large dog  bounded down the lane to Draco.
Ron noticed tears on everyone’s faces as they listened to the boys talk. His heart hurt knowing it had been so long since they had likely heard anything like it.
“Harry, they get together every other week! And on the other week we go see Ron and Hermione! I know you're not coming with me, whatever that's fine but I am going to go.”
oh man this one turned out long! that's what I get for saying my Drarry's were too short. to be fair this is very firmly pre-relationship. So canonical Major Character death here and a lot of playing fast and loose with canon elements. hope you like!
"I suggest you move your pointy toes then" Harry said listlessly. He hadn't been feeling good that morning, Draco knew, perhaps he was still under the weather.
He stood next to his parents and watched as the dog illuminated the car enough to make out Draco and Blaise. It dissipated once the message had been delivered, only to be replaced by a small ferret he knew to be Blaise’s Patronus. The sight never failed to make him snicker.
“You're actually quite ugly when you're ill.” he told him. Harry glared at him. His eyes too now that he could see them looked fever bright and greener than ever.
“She’s been wanting to see the both of them actually.” Charlie said. His booming voice almost startling Ron. It had been so long since he had heard his brother’s voice. He had never been close with the family, distance and personality separating them even when they were younger.
“Ok, ok yeah. Just me and you tonight. Let's get this shirt off of you so we can see the damage.” Neville said, voice hitching on the last word.
“You do,” she says bluntly. “But I wish you wouldn’t. Rolf says you are the most helpful person there.”
“Hermione,,” Tusneem says, turning to face her. “I will leave the rest of the details to you for now. I expect a full report before the end of the day.”
“Yes,” Potter agrees in a rather clipped tone. “It is. No offense, Parkinson, but I think it might be best if I laid out the ground rules and brought Malfoy up to speed on how our cover will work.” Pansy stares at Potter coolly for a moment before she shrugs and turns back to her food.
Instead, he walks into his bedroom and places the book on his bed. If he is going to read a book he’s not supposed to read at a time when he should instead be sleeping, he is going to do it properly. Quickly, he takes off his clothes until he is just wearing his boxers and goes through his evening ablutions. It is only when he is tucked up in bed, propped up against the pillows, that he picks the book up again.
When he had finished the vegetable course, he glanced down at his place setting. There were still three sets of utensils and a dessert spoon. Most of the courses thus far had been a few bites of each thing, but nevertheless, he was starting to get full. He wondered idly whether or not he would have been able to eat more if he were in his normal body.
“The open sales position,” Pansy said again. She keeps the smile on her face and hopes that it doesn't look manic.
look a bit silly. But he’s supposed to be Father Christmas, so that’s kind of the point. He has so much latex on his face that Harry can barely recognize him. The only thing that gives him away is his hair, but McLaggen’s now working on getting his wig ready, so even that will be disguised shortly.
“I don’t know,” she said. Neville made a move and Hermione ducked around the foul smelling spray as she lost a point. It instead landed on Ron.
“For you, yes.” Massi’s face is open. His brown eyes are wide and hopeful. His face is framed by the gentle waves of his hair. His lips are pink from where he’s been chewing on them. And so Draco calls him on it.
“Fine.” He reaches into the inner pocket of his suit jacket and pulls his wand out. He hands it over, watching Potter’s face as the other man’s hand closes around the wood. He looks… surprised? But of course. This is the wand that Draco had all but given Potter at the Manor, for all he’d tried to hold on to it as Potter had snatched it from his hand. That he’d used at the Battle of Hogwarts. The wand he’d used to kill the Dark Lord. Draco had been surprised when it had arrived in a parcel left on his doorstep a few weeks after He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had died, but he’d been so grateful to have his wand back, that he hadn’t thought much of it. It was
“So we’re all agreed then?” Harry asked. “We’re all in on the plot to bring down the Dark Lord?” Everyone nodded. “Wonderful. I'll let Snape know. You can join our Occlumency classes.”
“Good. That was the point. Now tell me more about the Sim-whatchamacallit’s plan to take over Muggle real estate.” McLaggen takes a large quaff of his G&T. He wipes his mouth on the back of his sleeve.
“Manhattan, please Potter,” Draco says, blowing him a kiss. Harry smiles sardonically but he nods nonetheless.
“Soon, I hope,” Harry says. “As much as I love being on vacation with you, I’m ready to get back to work.”
“Well color me impressed.” They lapsed into silence, each of them sipping at their drinks. Draco shuffled closer to Harry on the couch and leaned onto his shoulder. Harry extricated his arm and put it around Draco, reveling in their closeness, and reveling in the fact that he could do this because the only other people in the room already knew about them. He turned his head and buried his nose in Draco’s hair, taking in the scent of him. He smelled of basil and bergamot.
He looked up from his plate to find both Hermione and Seamus staring at him in disgust. He shrugged and pushed his plate away. Ron bounced up from his seat and they left the Great Hall together.
“-Pansy, wait for me,” Ron’s voice came from behind her as the offending redhead stepped out onto the balcony as well. The door slammed shut behind him. Harry and Draco sprang guiltily apart wearing matching deer in the wand-light expressions. Ron cringed at the look of shock on Pansy’s face.
“Well it’s fucked everything up.” The first figure rounds on the second. “Now the Ministry’s investigating.”
“Yes,” Ron cried excitedly, waving his microphone about. The vodka had gone straight to his head, but he could hardly be blamed for that. They were all drinking on empty stomachs.
on a date last night. It would be an easy cover to sell - I just figured it made the most sense. After all, no one was going to believe you were dating me.”
“So what if I am,” Draco replies haughtily. He crosses his arms in front of his chest to make his point.
By the time Draco and Greg stumble back across the alleyway to their own house, they are both three sheets to the wind. Once they had gotten to Hannah’s, they split a of bottle of wine between the three of them. When Hannah’s boyfriend, Ernie MacMillen showed up (Hannah and Ernie, the Hogwarts sweethearts, did not help with Draco’s preconceptions about Hufflepuffs), they opened another one. The promised Chinese food never materialized and instead they threw together some spaghetti dish out of things found in Hannah’s kitchen. Finally around eleven thirty, Draco glanced at his watch and called an end to the evening.
“Harry, Draco,” she says once they are settled in their chairs. “Thank you for coming in. Something has come up.”
Training turns out to be much harder than Draco had anticipated it being. They go through everything he had been teaching himself during his breaks in a matter of a weeks worth of lessons. Soon he is learning complicated counter-jinxes and brewing potions that are well beyond N.E.W.T. level. He is surprised to find that Harry is much better at Potions than he remembers from school. When he asks Harry about this, Harry just laughs.
Harry moves into his new house, and he and Draco spend the occasional night there. True to his word, Harry has left half of his giant closet open for Draco and Draco has moved some of his fancier dress robes and suits in. They have decided it is easier to stay at Harry’s place after missions, so that Greg doesn’t wonder as much about how many events they seem to attend.
“I look fucking ridiculous,” says the old man sitting in front of Harry. It is now Friday morning and Draco is sitting in the middle of the cooler while McLaggen flits around him holding a Muggle prosthetics kit.
“Are you ticklish, Potter?” he asked, unconsciously switching back to Harry’s last name as his brain tried to keep up with the situation.
“I couldn’t get there in time,” Harry mumbled. He realized they had managed to get to this point in the conversation without revealing to Snape that he and Draco were romantically involved, but it now seemed like they were about to get to the big revelation.
For a moment, Malfoy looks at him blankly, but then Harry sees something in Malfoy’s posture shift as he almost imperceptibly stiffens in surprise and Harry’s heart sinks. The book is gone. Malfoy has read it. And in that moment, Harry knows that his mission has changed. Now, Malfoy is the asset, and thus is the thing that Harry will have to bring in to Croaker as soon as he possibly can. And to do that, he is going to need Malfoy to trust him. He quickly changes the subject, moving away from any work-related topics.
“Interesting,” was all she said. He opened his mouth to protest and then shut it again. There was no point.
“Are we sure this is a good idea?” she asked. Blaise sat back, letting his arms drop from around her shoulders to rest around her waist instead.
“Just ask her out, MacMillen,” Draco said. He dragged his hands down his face and then dropped them to his sides. “Life’s too short to waste it worrying.” Then he stalked off down the tunnel, leaving Harry standing with Ernie. Harry grinned at his retreating back. At this rate, he’d be able to make out with Draco in front of their entire year by summer.
Along one wall, there are two doors. One is the door to the closet; the other leads to the ensuite bathroom. Draco pushes himself off of the bed, and walks over to it. It’s pleasantly large, with both a shower and a bath along with his and hers sinks set into a long countertop along one wall. A mirror runs the length of the cabinet, making the room appear larger than it is. Along the wall opposite the counter, there are several large windows, curtained with sheers, which let in the yellow light from the streetlights outside.
HALLOWEEN MASSACRE: HUNDREDS DEAD AT MUGGLE AMUSEMENT PARK; DARK MARK SEEN IN SKY; PROMINENT AUROR INJURED
Nothing happens. Harry frowns and tries the doorknob. He finds that it is already unlocked. They creep inside. The house is a mirror of Harry’s, and they shuffle from room to room, finding nothing. Harry is starting to think they’re not going to find anything when they hear a creak in floorboards above them. As one, they rush to the stairs and up them, taking care to avoid any creaking floorboards themselves.
“No, Harry,” Draco says firmly. Harry is clearly in one of his 'I love everyone' moods. It happens sometimes when he drinks gin. Or drinks anything, really.
“Enough.” Snape crossed his arms and glared at them. “You,” he pointed at Draco. “Tell me exactly what happened.” Draco looked over at Harry, who gave a small shake of his head.
“Very well,” he said. He gestured for them to sit down, so they did. Snape waved his wand and a desk attachment appeared on both of their chairs. They took the hint and pulled out quills and parchment. Snape waited until they were ready, quills poised, before he started to speak again.
“Figured this was better,” he says. Draco has to agree. Harry is wearing a forest green teeshirt that matches his eyes and jeans that
He walks over to the closet where he hangs it up, followed shortly after by his waistcoat. He looks around for a place to put his car keys and coin purse, and decides to place them on top of a chest of drawers. He tugs his trousers off and adds them to the same hanger as the suit jacket, and then pulls on the tracksuit bottoms. And Draco will be damned, but they are
“I remain unconvinced.” She sighed and sat up, taking her feet off the table and stuffing them back into her shoes.
“I wonder if Father will let us borrow one now. I think it might have been long enough since the last time we asked.”
“I believe you already did.” As much as common sense would tell Harry to stop flirting at this point as nothing good can come of it, he finds he can’t help himself. Last night was better than he would have thought possible. And the fact that Malfoy hasn’t now cursed him from here to next Sunday seems like a good indication that he had enjoyed it too. If only Malfoy hadn’t read that damn book, Harry could convince himself that perhaps they could have made this work. But there is no sense dwelling on that now.
By the end, he is not sure quite how they have done it, but they have made him look better without making him look all that much different at all. And when he turns to look at Harry, he has to suppress a small intake of breath. Harry’s eyes seem to sparkle more emerald than usual and he looks well rested and flawless. No wonder all the witches who read Witch Weekly fawn over him. And he is all Draco’s. At least for pretend.
The next few days were the strangest Harry had ever experienced at Hogwarts, and that included the time the Weasley twins had set off a portable swamp and left school to a display of fireworks.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Draco says promptly. He can feel the veritaserum in his system, compelling him to answer truthfully. It feels almost like a strong Legillimens and Draco wonders if he can employ the skills he learned from his aunt to fight any questions he doesn’t want to answer. He starts methodically putting up the various barriers in his mind, and though he hasn’t done this in years, it comes easily to him.
in a secret relationship, I just snog people in the middle of a party.” Ron felt his face burn at the mention of kissing. He took another quick swig of the whisky.
“Yeah?” Massi asks, the corner of his mouth lifting in a smirk. Draco wants to gag, but he forces himself to keep speaking.
“Fireworks probably?” he hazards. “It’s almost Guy Fawkes day. They are probably some idiots setting things off a few days early.”
“However, the way I see it,” Tusneem continues. “Your work will need to stay a secret. You are far too valuable of an asset for the general public, and more specifically, the general criminal public, to know who you are.” Malfoy nods slowly. He had to have been expecting that. Harry wonders how he would feel if he knew he couldn’t go back to his old life, to his friends, to his job.
“And he questioned Draco using veritaserum.” Harry tries not to sound angry at this, but he’s not sure he quite manages it.
Draco carried the Cup over to the desk and put it down. Then he took a deep breath and pointed his wand at it.
“Great,” Harry replied. “Can we get some food now?” As if to back him up, his stomach growled loudly. Draco snorted in amusement.
“And everyone is waiting on us to bring in the Reliquary.” Harry’s shoulders slump. What he would do for another couple of hours of sleep. Then he straightens and nods.
“I don’t have much of an opportunity to go shopping,” Harry mumbled. “I get shipped off to my aunt and uncle’s every summer and you must be mental if you think they would let me buy myself new things.”
“And Malfoy being as attractive as he is,” Seamus added. A flare of jealousy went through Harry, taking him by surprise.
“What if I don’t want to be in the friend zone?” he asks with a smirk and Pansy can’t believe he just fucking said that. She glares at him as she picks up her drink and downs the rest of it.
“Sorry,” Greg says. He stares at his feet. “But you asked.” And it seems that Greg has just been waiting for someone to talk to about it. Draco sighs.
Before leaving, Harry also picked up a relatively nice sweater and a pair of jeans, as he remembered that Draco had already seen him in all of his non school attire. It was possibly Harry and Ron’s most productive trip to Saving Sickles to date.
“I don’t know. You and Harry and both Gryffindors. You explain to me how you two think.” Draco’s patience is all but gone now. McLaggen narrows his eyes at Draco.
“Right.” They hurried over to the fireplace. Harry took some of the bags while Draco grabbed a handful of Floo powder. Then with a firm,
“Don’t you think that is potentially a conflict of interest?” Harry asked. He moved his head to try to fall into Draco’s line of sight, but Draco flicked his eyes down to the table instead.
“Which brings us to,” Dumbledore continued once everyone had quieted down. “The plan that these students have devised to lure Voldemort to the school in order to take him out and end the war. Mr. Weasley, if you would?” Dumbledore gestured to Ron. Harry watched as Mrs. Weasley turned to gape at Ron.
“Let’s go back to my room first,” he said. “This room unnerves me.” Harry stuck the Cup in Pansy’s handbag and they left the room.
“Two can play at that game,” Draco said and Harry felt Draco’s hands slide down his torso and then clamp firmly on his butt cheeks.
are now dating, which I am sure the Daily Prophet will have a field day with, and that Pansy is your coworker and friend. Are there any questions?” Draco, for what seems like the first time, shakes his head.
“What’s that? Oh, yes. I suppose I do.” He glances at Potter as he says this. He’s not sure if Potter can hear what Healer Burlington is saying on the other end of the phone, but Potter had just said he should stay, so Draco’s going to assume that the offer still stands.
“Finite incantatum,” he cries and flops back onto the sofa. He scrambles upright and glares at Draco. “I can walk, you know.” Draco shrugs.
“Clearly.” He reached up and took the jar from Draco. “Do you mind?” He gestured towards the door. Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Could you, ah, step outside for a moment?” Harry clarified.
“It wasn’t terrible,” Massi says. He puts his palms flat on top of the display case and pushes himself upright. “In fact, it was pretty good.”
“Only if you’re quick about it,” Snape snapped. Draco didn’t need telling twice. He tore out of the common room and back into the sixth year boy’s dormitory. He pulled on his uniform from the day before, ignoring the fact that it was rumpled, and ran back to the common room. Snape nodded once as he reached them, then turned with a swish of his cloak and led the three of them out into the corridor.
“That doesn’t help me if you die and I lose it,” Draco muttered. “Oh, Circe, you don’t think we’re going to have to drink it in front of everyone, do you?” The thought hadn’t occurred to Harry. He was now even more nervous than he had been a moment ago.
“Yes,” he says. “We’ve been invited to Christmas dinner at the Burrow.” To Draco’s credit, he does not protest or make a horrified face, merely nods.
“I think that’s mine,” Harry said. “But you can use it.” Draco nodded, his mouth suddenly dry. Using Harry’s wand felt almost more intimate than what they were about to do. But he banished the thought from his mind and performed the various spells he had learned from the restricted section books. He put his hand back onto Harry’s cock, covering it with lubrication, before guiding him to the right place.
“Claudia,” Neville repeated and then realized that Harry probably had no idea who Claudia was. “Uh, this Hufflepuff girl I like.”
“What?” Ron asked. He sounded peevish and Harry assumed this was because he still felt like he was dying.
“Come again?” he says. He’s amazed that he manages to get these three syllables out without his voice shaking. Sure, he knew that they were onto Harry, but he thought at the very least he was just an innocent civilian. Not an enemy of the family.
“Yes, well, I’m not sure how the law works for wizards, but I do know that if you're in a private muggle dwelling, you only have to be five.” For the second time that day, Ron, Seamus and Harry all gaped at someone in unison. Ron was the first to recover.
“Potter, you are impossible,” Draco said. He turned and stalked out of the room. Harry gaped at the door like a fish, unsure what they were fighting about or even if they were fighting at all.
“Shut up,” McLaggen mutters, his face flushing. Pansy hides her amusement by eating a piece of California roll.
After a moment, the pain lessened to a dull ache. He could deal with that. He wondered what had happened to make it hurt so much in the first place and almost stopped walking when he thought it might be that Voldemort had discovered that the horcrux had been replaced. He reached out and clutched at Draco’s hand. Draco glanced at him briefly, but didn’t drop his hand.
“And now we stir fifty times counterclockwise,” Draco said. He picked up a wooden spoon and began to stir. “Merlin, this seems like an awful lot.”
“Yeah, well, believe it,” Draco said. He pressed up next to Harry, being careful to ensure the cloak was fully covering them and that their feet weren’t showing. “And now believe that I am going to do this.” He pressed his lips to Harry’s and Harry melted back into the wall, his lips parting to allow Draco’s tongue to slip inside his mouth. He reached up and tangled his hands into Draco’s hair. He felt like his heart might burst from happiness. Sure, they were hidden away under the invisibility cloak, but they were making out at a party like any other couple would. In fact, like many other couples were.
“Right, all that inbreeding must have gone and bred out the need for a liver.” Harry shot back halfheartedly.
Harry eyed the small dementor still hovering menacingly, now that he was sure what it was. Mr. Malfoy followed behind her, her long stride keeping her ahead. Harry continued to follow at a slower pace, wary of the wraith. He looked over at KingslEy who had a troubled look on his face, his eyes darting up and away from the dementor periodically.
“Give these to him when he wakes up. Or whenever he needs them most.” she told him, her gaze steady on Harry’s face until he nodded in the affirmative. She smiled at him.
Harry only blinked at him. He had no idea what to even begin to think about that. Truthfully it sounded more like a fairy tale than anything else, but he had the Elder wand in his hand and the Invisibility cloak in his pocket so who was he to say it wasn't true.
“Do you want me to cast a patronus to get rid of it?” Harry blurted out suddenly, startling the man slightly. He sighed.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled out a paper from his back pocket. A sonogram was printed on one side.
“I didn't know. I didn't know you all spent time with him. I was just so mad and he was being so obstinate about coming here and he said that I didn't see past myself and I just got so mad.” Harry said miserably. No wonder Draco had looked so hurt by that.
When Draco woke up hours later, his lovey had been replaced under his cheek by a broad chest, and his bear was no longer in his arms.
Harry bristled “you can't make me quit, Malfoy. What are you going to do? Threaten to tell Ginny? I thought you were all about preserving the family unit?”
i had planned on making this porny, then it got away from me so i figured i'd save that for next time!
“We must hurry.” said Mr. Malfoy. He looked scared and gaunt once again, his worry beginning to break through the arrogant facade he showed earlier.
It was far too soon to try and manhandle Malfoy across the street to the room he had decided to book for the night when he was feeling optimistic as to how the whole deal would play out. Staring at Malfoys thin waist and the tight curve of his arse, usually lost in big billowing robes he couldn't help but feel he made the right choice.
pre-relationship, but you can bet Draco wakes up in bed next to Harry and Harry is a great shoulder to cry on.
“We must hurry.” said Mr. Malfoy. He looked scared and gaunt once again, his worry beginning to break through the arrogant facade he showed earlier.
“It’s not right how they treat you, like you had a choice in the matter. They have no idea what you did for them. They still only see the bad things you were forced into.”
Harry only stood, stunned at what he had learned. He knew Snape had favored his Slytherin’s. He had been especially lenient towards Malfoy, but he had no idea their relationship had run so deep. He wondered how he could have missed it for 6 years. He remembered the viciousness in Snape’s glare the night Dumbledore died when Harry chased them. And the desperate worry in his eye in Myrtle’s bathroom before he fell to his knees to heal Draco from Harry’s attack.
The Malfoy’s and their auror guard both turned to look at the crowd they had gathered. Mrs. Malfoy looked shocked for a moment but covered it quickly. Mr Malfoy though, looked at Dean and Luna with regret and grudging admiration, nodding once in acceptance.
He saw Mrs. Malfoy suck in a breath and tears welled in her eyes, her shoulders slumped and it seemed Harry wasn't the only one freed by the statement. He could still feel her breath in his ear asking after her only child. Next to her Lucius was nodding imperiously, as if he wasn't shackled and bleeding.
“False alarm,” he says. He taps his temple again with his wand and the recording spell ends. Draco waves his wand twice and then points it at the ceiling. From there, he knows, that the recording will go to the Cooler, where it will be stored in a Ministry penseive until someone cares to look at it. It feels like a waste, but it is protocol to send it either way.
“Hermione was right. It starts at nine.” Ron looked at his watch and scowled. They still had fifteen minutes to kill. He looked around at the piles of desserts and wondered whether he should eat some more of them, or if the additional sugar would make him even more on edge.
It feels unfair that he should find out this way. Harry had at least been able to deal with his shock in private. He had been able to spend most of that first night crying into Oliver’s pillow, inhaling his scent and attempting to commit it to memory before it faded for good. He wonders if he should somehow have brought this up the night before. But then he thinks, should he have brought it up before or after they’d taken all their clothes off? He blushes as his traitorous mind goes straight to the memory of how Malfoy’s mouth felt around his dick. But now is quite definitely not the time for these thoughts, so he pushes the memory quickly away.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Hermione watching him with interest, but he ignored her. He only had eyes for Pansy and her hips. They met together in the middle of the circle.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, his head drooping. “I’m just nervous. And when I’m nervous I talk a lot.” Draco sat down on the bed and pulled Harry down next to him.
He reaches the junction and throws himself around the corner before skidding to a stop. A line of hit wizards blocks the corridor. He is surrounded. One of them steps forward. Oliver narrows his eyes and glares at her.
had an obsession with the blond?) He glanced over to where Draco had sat down and was rewarded with a sneer, which hurt more than he thought it ought to.
They eat at a steakhouse down the road from the cinema. Draco barely tastes his food. He drinks a pair of martinis and this helps him squash down some of his emotions. Harry keeps up a running conversation and Draco does his best to respond. He tries to appear normal. He doesn’t want Harry to know how upset his comments had made him, because what good would that do anyway?
“The Leaky Cauldron,” and pulled Harry into the green flames with him. It was only as they were spinning that it occurred to Harry that the middle of wizarding London might not be the best place for the pair of them to be seen together. He just had to hope that very few people were out and about on the day after Boxing Day.
As they were the only Slytherin and Gryffindor sixth years who had stayed for the Christmas holidays, they took over a corner of the Gryffindor Common room after dinner. (“No offense, Pansy, but the underwater view of the lake always creeps me out,” Ron had said.)
“Oh, Merlin,” he said as he drew close enough to Harry that he could see his face clearly. “See, this is why I never wear glasses.”
you want?” Draco frowns at his watch for another moment before he finally drops his arm. She stares at him, letting the silence drag on.
“You do have me,” is all that Harry says and then he reaches up and gently wipes the tears off of Draco’s face.
“As you pointed out earlier, it’s been ten years.” He winks and then instantly regrets it. Who even winks anymore? “So,” he says quickly by way of distraction. “What would you like to drink?”
“Right,” Harry says and then watches as Narcissa opens the Hermès scarf that Draco had bought her in Paris.
Finally Draco decides that he is being ridiculous. It’s just Potter after all. And he so he turns onto his side, pulling the blankets closer around himself.
“What do wizards do to decide these kinds of things?” Harry asked Blaise after Draco had disappeared from sight. Blaise shrugged.
“You’re the worst,” Draco says. He starts to push the covers back before he realizes he is wearing only boxers.
Despite not knowing what he was putting into his mouth, he found everything to be pleasant. He wondered if there was an actual chef down in the kitchen, or whether the Malfoys had trained their house elves in gourmet cooking. He made a mental note to ask Draco about it later. This course was paired with a white wine but Harry was still on his champagne, so he quickly downed the last couple of sips.
“Plus, you couldn’t be anonymous on our team. Hit Wizards are much higher profile than Unspeakables, for obvious reasons.”
“Hey there, lover boy,” someone says as Draco enters the back room. It is Luca. Draco scowls at him. Luca, undeterred, waggles his eyebrows at him and wiggles his hips.
“So that I do not forget to give this to you during the flurry of activity in the coming weeks. There is much to plan for.”
He wanders the party in search of the brunet, but instead runs into Greg. He is no longer attached at the mouth to Pansy, something that Draco is grateful for. In fact, she is nowhere to be seen.
“I thought it was just speculation when you told me at the Halloween feast,” McGonagall said. She stared at her skirt and picked a piece of lint off of it.
The room was, again, sparsely furnished, with just a bed and a pair of side tables, but as that was all they needed, it was fine. Being there, in the room, alone, with Draco was a strange combination of thrilling and terrifying. Harry was frozen to the spot, hardly even moving as Draco closed the door behind him.
He took an experimental drag on it. And immediately doubled over coughing. The back of his throat felt like it was burning, so he took deep lungfuls of cold fresh air. He stared down at the cigarette, scandalized, and then dropped it and crushed it under his foot.
Harry starts slowly. At first he just flicks his tongue gently at the head and Draco is about to tell him he's a big fucking tease when he abruptly takes it into his mouth. And then Harry’s tongue is swirling around him as he gradually takes him in and Draco suppresses a moan, painfully aware that they are in a public restroom and someone could walk in on them at any time. Honestly, that just makes it more exciting.
“I’m so sorry, Richard,” she says. She calls him Richard not out of respect, but because she knows that he hates the nickname that the rest of the employees have bestowed on him and she wants to butter him up. “I’m just not feeling well today.”
“‘Mione, I need to go. Malfoy’s trying to leave… At least two weeks you said? Fuck. Ok.” Potter stabs the end call button and shoves the phone back into his pocket. He stares at Draco as if trying to find the right words to say. Draco closes his briefcase and snaps the clasps shut. The click that they make echoes around the dining room.
“I like that idea,” Ron said. “Perhaps that will confuse it, so it can’t say mean things about us. Like a boggart when it’s confronted by too many people.”
Then, as Ron watched, Lord Voldemort himself walked out of the Room, his black robes rippling behind him. Ron’s breath caught in his throat. He’d known fear — he’d watched his best friend risk his life multiple times — but somehow this was even more terrifying than any of those times had been.
“But I had just found out the man who had killed my parents, and who was - is - trying to kill me, had been a Slytherin, so I asked the hat to put me somewhere else.”
“Thank fuck for that. All our unresolved tensions have left me with needs that need to be taken care of.”
“You are most welcome,” Lucius says. “Now then.” He claps his hands together. “Why don’t you two go put those on so that Narcissa and I can spectate some Seekers’ Games, eh?” Draco turns to his father and raises an eyebrow.
“Ok, it’s not nothing then, but could you narrow it down from everything?” Draco was still holding onto his arm, but now his hand slipped down until he was just holding Harry’s hand.
“Fine.” She takes a quick glance at Draco, but he seems unconcerned about the whole Muggle public transit thing. That is unexpected. Perhaps he had changed more than she had thought.
“Right,” Harry said once they reached the trapdoor that led to Honeydukes. “I’m going to have to ferry us out one or two at a time.” He saw Pansy frown at him in confusion, so he reached into his bag and pulled out his invisibility cloak. Her mouth fell open in shock.
They dress quickly, putting on items of each other’s costume in their rush. The house next door has been silent now for about a minute, but they are both still on edge.
It has been several days since their ill-fated “date”, where Harry had let slip that he would rather be on a date with someone else, and in that time, Harry has been just as “hands on” as he has needed to be to keep up the charade of their relationship, but nothing more. Just as many “impromptu” make out sessions against the bookshelves of Flourish and Blotts, but no more than that. It’s almost as if Draco’s mentioning dating someone else has reminded Potter that yes, in fact, he would rather be with someone - anyone - else. Which is to say that it has been rather miserable.
“Wow,” she says. She puts a hand up to her forehead, pushing back the wisps of hair that have fallen in front of her eyes.
“Holy shit,” Harry said before he could stop himself. Draco’s voice was clear in his mind, while also being in his ear as they were in the same room.
“We went to that dinner at the Brazilian ambassador’s house just the other day.” And they had defused a bomb. It had been a very successful evening.
Then came that careful dance of partnership. Blaise held the ends of the sweet grass reeds and lemongrass while Hermione plaited them together. Then he folded the finished weave into the right shape while she held the loose ends, and then froze it in shape once it was complete. Blaise then held
“And once you started, you couldn’t stop?” Draco nods and Dempsey sighs again. “That was quite the design flaw.”
“Today we will be training with veritaserum,” Hermione says, watching Draco carefully for a reaction. But he remains professional, his face neutral. It seems that it is only Harry who is nervous about this. He is, of course, worried that someone will ask about their relationship. He knows that it is possible to resist veritaserum - that is the whole point of the training - but if anyone asks about them before any training has happened... Well, it doesn’t bear thinking about.
Their hips are now moving together as Draco presses himself against Harry. He is sweating in the club’s humid atmosphere, and when he brings his hands up and tangles them in Harry’s hair he finds it damp with sweat as well. How his hands had made there way up to Harry’s hair, he’s not sure. But now their foreheads are pressed together and when Draco briefly opens his eyes, he sees that Harry’s are closed as well. The guitar swells as Draco’s heart does the same.
“Stop dicking around, Cormac,” Pansy snaps. “You said you thought I was ‘one of the good ones’,” and here she uses air quotes. “Tell me about this other task force you’re on, or I swear to Morgana I will take this to Dempsey. I take it she doesn’t know?”
“What do you think you might see?” Seamus asked. He was sitting across from Harry, playing with his food more than eating it. Ron shrugged.
“Family comes first. Your happiness comes before anything.” He couldn’t help it. The tears spilled out of his eyes and made tracks down his face before he could stop them. “Oh, darling.” And then she swept him into her arms the way she used to when he was small. As he cried, she rubbed circles into his back and pressed kisses to the top of his head.
“No need to make the decision now,” Ron says hurriedly. “Just, you know, some time before next Thursday.” Draco nods again and swallows the bite of chicken that he had just taken.
“Oh, shut up, Potter,” Malfoy says. “You’re not nearly as attractive as you think you are.” Harry grins.
“Don’t blow me off like that,” McLaggen says. He walks into her field of vision on the other side of the bag.
“I thought you might have more of a reaction,” Draco says. He's not sure if he actually would have preferred more of a reaction. Every time he had gone over this conversation in his head, his parents had been upset. There had been tears and yelling. This calm nonchalance is unnerving.
“I still can’t believe you’re here,” Massi continues on as though Draco hadn’t spoken. “I mean, what are the odds? I’m in Zermatt. You’re in Zermatt. Now I’m here and you’re here.”
“Oh, fuck,” Harry moans. “Yes, Draco. That’s it. Fuck me.” Draco doesn’t need telling twice. Any witty response he might have had about the fact that he is, in fact, already fucking him is cut off as Harry abruptly sprays Draco’s chest with semen and all of his words devolve into sounds of pleasure.
“Do it,” Harry said, not looking up. He kept staring at Draco instead, as if staring into his lifeless eyes would change what had happened. “I don’t care. I’ll go willingly.” He was numb. What difference would it make if he died now? Draco had gone and with him had gone all Harry’s future joy. He clutched Draco to him and didn’t even flinch when he heard the words,
The blond has pulled his legs up on the couch in a criss cross in front of him in the time Harry has been gone, but other than that, he is right where Harry left him. He looks up as they enter and nods at Parkinson. After acknowledging him, she sits down on one of the two armchairs. Harry retakes his seat next to Malfoy.
“He what?” Blaise shrugged and motioned for Draco to follow him. Draco pulled his bathrobe off of the hook on the wall and swung it around his shoulders before following Blaise out to the common room.
“Now that we’ve seen the full potential of The Reliquary project,” Granger continues. “It is high time we started training you for more field operations.” She holds up a hand as Draco starts to protest that he has already been on field operations. “Yes, Draco, I know you’ve been a valuable asset in the field.” She gives him a small smile and for the first time (in perhaps his whole acquaintance with Hermione Granger) he appreciates her smile. And, perhaps for the first time, he notices that her teeth aren’t nearly as large as he thought they were. But that has no bearing on their conversation, so he banishes that thought for another time.
He sighed and looked over at the clock. Hermione had been right, it was time for lessons, but Draco was in no rush to get to them. He had the valid excuse of having been in the hospital wing and it would be silly not to milk that excuse for as long as possible.
“Draco,” Harry says as a thought suddenly strikes him. He turns to the blond. “Have you ever been to the cinema before?”
An almost overwhelming desire comes over Draco to tell her about his true feelings for Harry, about their one amazing night, about the blowjob, about… but he squashes these down. He concentrates hard on what he needs to say, though he feels like he’s about to spit out the truth at any moment. The actual physical feeling of being about to vomit is overwhelming - there is a moment where he is about to physically retch - but Draco ignores it and focuses on the official line of his cover story.
“Is this about Greg?” he leans in and whispers in her ear. From the way that she stiffens beside him, he guesses he’s gotten it in one. “Did you want to talk about it?” he asks at normal volume.
“You’re not coming to the pub?” Greg asks. Draco shakes his head and explains that Big Dick needs him to come in tomorrow. “Tough luck, mate. I’ll let Harry know you’ll be late.”
Harry and Draco spend Friday on a train from Milan to Paris. Though Harry had suggested that they apparate to France, Draco decided that he quite liked the quiet solitude one could find on a train and had insisted they finish their journey like Muggles. And so they sit and watch the countryside pass by while eating cheese and charcuterie and sharing a bottle of wine.
“What do you want me to say? I was sexually frustrated and Blaise was, well, there, and we’ve taken out our sexual frustrations on each other before, just as friends, of course. I would never date him. And anyway, nothing ended up happening.” She was propped up on her elbow now, looking down at him.
Downstairs is a large open plan office. There is a large blank wall on one side, in front of which sits a table with four chairs. Along another is a large window, which looks into a room filled with
“Do you think,” she said as they laid the lavender sprigs out in the right formation. “That Professor Snape meant for us all to get along so well?”
but that no-one had shown up. So how did the assailant get away? They weren’t in the house and they didn’t flee by foot through the garden.”
“This,” Massi says proudly as they reach the end of one of the rows. “Is a Hand of Glory made from the hand of Lord Voldemort himself.” Draco flinches. He can’t help it. He half expects the taboo name to bring Death Eaters to their current location, and worse than that, the Dark Lord himself. Even though Draco knows he has been dead for years, he still has that visceral fear. Massi notices his discomfort.
with Potter seemed to call for the dramatics (even if he’d brought it on himself by asking to stay).
“I’m serious though. Let’s get a place. That way we don’t have to stay with my parents. We can look for a place while you’re at the Weaselys'.”
“Hermione asked to see us.” Harry stares at the pillow and is about to take it away when Draco pushes it off of his face and sits up. He never made it back into his pajamas last night and the spiderweb of scars on his chest is silvery in the morning sunlight.
Mrs Weasley had, of course, sent her customary jumpers, but she had outdone herself this year, knitting jumpers not only for Harry and Ron, but for Pansy and Hermione as well. When Pansy pulled hers out and eyed it suspiciously, Ron said that Ginny must have told her they were dating.
“I hadn’t much thought,” Blaise said. “If I’m being entirely honest. I was just trying to get through school.” Unspoken in the Slytherin common room was the fact that many of their house were unsure what would even become of them after school. The threat of war hung over everything, and many of them knew on which side their parents lay and weren’t sure whether they did too. But Blaise was not about to bring that up now, instead saying, “I imagine you are looking to be an auror?”
“Do you need the coordinates again?” Draco asks, toothbrush halfway to his mouth. Harry shakes his head. He points to his watch.
“Parkinson,” he says again. He lays his hands flat on the table. “I know about the Ministry hideout under Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor.” Pansy can’t help it. Her mouth drops open.
Colin was having the time of his life. Pansy’s drink had been delicious and he was experiencing mild intoxication for the first time. And by golly it was great.
“I still can’t believe you three did that,” Draco said with a shake of his head. “Incredible. I had no idea.”
“Much more attractive than your boyfriend?” Pansy asks, lacing her words with syrup. Pansy knows that Greg’s been in recent editions of Witch Weekly, thanks to his association with Harry, and he was listed in the Top Fifty Hottest Wizards of 2008. She also knows that Daisy will have seen this.
“How are we getting there?” Draco asks. “Our Floo is set to Family Only.” Potter has the nerve to look mockingly hurt.
“Both of us worried about a would-be dictator trying to kill us.” Potter stares at him. “Though, you probably more than me. He was only going to kill me if I fucked up, which was… let’s say, quite the motivator…” Draco trails off. He doesn’t want to talk about the orders he’d been given before the start of sixth year. Potter knows what Draco did. Everyone knows what Draco did. Potter looks intently at him and Draco finds he can’t hold his stare.
“I don’t know how much Umbridge told you about us, but we had a kind of study group here, where we practiced defensive spells and stuff.”
“Hermione was kidnapped,” Harry says to Susan. Her eyebrows rise in surprise and she claps a hand to her mouth. “By a group of people who were impersonating her. We just got her back.”
“That was what distracted you?” Pansy asked, dropping her books down on the table with a thump. “I was more concerned about the fact that it could potentially change the potion in some small insidious way that we wouldn’t understand until we tried it and got stuck in a vision until the antidote could be brewed.”
“He asked me what I knew about the Reliquary. Of course, I’d had your training the other day, so I told him I knew nothing about it, but it was unnerving to say the least.” Hermione nods. She is frowning again. “Then he asked me why I was spending so much time with Parkinson.” Hermione nods again, but doesn’t say anything. She appears lost in thought. She brings a hand up to her mouth and absentmindedly chews on a hangnail.
“It’s fine. I got over it. Just - I don’t know - maybe we should talk about whatever this is or isn’t before anything else happens.” Pansy shook her head.
“If it’s Draco, it's going to be at least an hour.” She turns away. “In the meantime, I’m going to raid your kitchen for coffee,” she says as she starts down the stairs.
“Fine,” she said. She pulled the shirt over her head and looked at herself in the mirror. It would do, she decided. She quickly pulled her hair back into a high ponytail and added a pair of drop pearl earrings, before grabbing a cardigan and her coat and running out the door.
“On what pretext?” Draco asks. McLaggen opens his mouth, pauses, and then closes it again, his shoulders slumping.
“Any day now,” Granger said. “I received word from the Polizia Magica that they had arrested the entirety of the Battaglia family on Wednesday night, along with several prominent members of the Luczowski family in one of the largest arrests in their history. Tusneem is working with President Cattaneo to keep Draco and Harry’s names out of the press, while still giving credit to the British Ministry for their arrests.”
The song changes and Draco pulls his head back again. His heart is hammering in his chest and it is not helped by Harry opening his eyes and smirking at him.
“Take it back,” Draco said. He stopped walking and stood in front of Harry. “Our common room is decently nicer than yours.” Harry shrugged.
Draco and his family have predictably faced backlash for being Death Eaters, although the fact that his mother had played a part in Harry Potter’s survival, and the fact that they had defected before the battle even started, means that they have escaped doing any time in Azkaban. Draco is loathe to admit it, but Saint Potter had provided much of the testimony that allowed them to walk free.
“When I had said I was excited to see my future,” Ron said at lunch. “I hadn’t really thought that it might be more serious than just whether or not I made it as an Auror.” Pansy’s vision of Ron’s life had been less dark than Draco’s vision, but not by much. Again, Harry had died, and again Voldemort had worked to consolidate power, but he had done it in a much more insidious way.
He took a deep breath and looked into her eyes. They were wide and her face was open as she searched his for the truth. Nervously, Draco pulled his bottom lip between his teeth. Narcissa squeezed his hands.
“That took balls,” Draco says. He gives Harry a small smile as he thinks back to how shocked everyone had been that the Golden Boy had all but cheated on that assignment.
Draco’s mind races with relevant facts about the man. He’s 1.83m tall with a mostly nondescript face. Mousy brown hair, brown eyes. He allegedly favors books written in the twelfth century, particularly first editions. He usually targets elderly witches, flattering them until they let him into their home. At which point, he is suspected of altering the security wards on the house and sneaking back at the dead of night for his thievery. He has never been caught, but the Ministry believes his face to look like the man who entered the store. Or, at the very least, the Reliquary thinks this is the man, from a composite of witness pictures.
“Well,” Susan says. “She’s in a magically induced coma, but none of my tests have shown that there’s anything wrong with her.”
“She’s been a little short with Rose, but Rose is two and so she doesn’t really notice.” Ron takes another sip of his tea. “But she’s been a bit more enthusiastic in the bedroom,” he mumbles, his ears turning red. Well that was something Harry hadn’t wanted to hear. He takes a deep breath.
“You’re probably right,” he says. “Say, why don’t you and Malfoy come to dinner tonight and you can help me figure out if she’s my wife or an imposter.”
“Take Me to Grimmauld Place.” The GPS pulls up the directions after a moment’s pause. Draco knows he can program it without his wand, but he’d forgotten to do it when leaving the house and this requires much less of his concentration. Which is good as there’s a large lorry trying to overtake him on the inside and Draco’s more than a little concerned it’s going to swerve into his lane.
He turns back to the nearest body and freezes when he sees that it is Massi. He is sprawled on his back on the floor and his legs are bent at an awkward angle as though he had been running when he had been stunned. Presumably stunned. Draco almost doesn’t want to check if he’s alive, just in case he isn’t. But he forces himself to kneel down next to Massi. He puts two fingers on Massi’s neck and feels for a pulse.
“I was sulking,” Harry said. He walked over to where Draco was sitting and flopped down into one of the chairs. “And brooding. And generally trying to give off an air of misery.”
“I suppose we could bring the idea to my father,” Massi says slowly. He bends down and retrieves his shirt from the floor and shrugs into it.
has to kill him?” Blaise asked in a whisper. It was lunch time, and they were hurrying up from the dungeons after their Potions lesson, the six of them clustered together.
“I’ll do my best.” Draco frowns but nods. Then he snuggles down in the bed next to Harry and they talk tactics until they both fall asleep.
Slowly the room quietens. The flashes of light decrease in number until it is only red flashes that Draco can see. He is stiff from sitting in such a tight ball, but he dares not move until Harry tells him it’s safe. The room begins to lighten as the Instant Darkness powder wears off. Draco looks up and sees a grim expression on Harry’s face. He is still firing stunning spells around the room even though Draco can’t hear any other movement.
And so Harry picked listlessly at his steak and mushroom pie. Or, at least, he did until he felt a note scuttle up his leg.
There was a faint popping noise and both Draco and Dumbledore turned around, confused. Harry was lying at the end of the portkey hall, also naked. Not far from him there was what appeared to be a very ugly baby-looking thing that started wailing as soon as it appeared.
“Yeah, I could have done without that awkward encounter,” he agreed. ‘Circe. They're going to be a fucking nightmare for the next two days.” Draco ran the hand that was not still in Harry’s through his hair. It left him looking rather tousled. Harry bit his lip.
“Permanent Sticking Charm,” Potter says with a rueful smile. “Trust me, I’ve tried.” Draco stares at Potter for a long moment. Potter is looking into his coffee like it holds the answers to all the questions of the universe.
“Hello yourself.” Draco shifts slightly behind Harry, letting his arms encircle the brunet more naturally.
“I must say,” Slughorn said, looking down at the contents of Harry and Draco’s cauldron. “This is one of the best Ehwaz potions I have ever seen. You two must have a wonderful relationship.”
“Is there any chance of more doughnuts?” Neville hazarded. Dobby snapped his fingers again and five more doughnuts added themselves to the tray.
And again, Draco loses himself in the beat of the music. He closes his eyes and pretends Harry is someone else, someone who actually wants to date him, even though that imaginary person looks an awful lot like Harry. He awkwardly sips at his drink over Harry’s shoulder and soon his glass is empty. He looks around for a place to put it and steers them, still dancing towards a small table, where he puts it down. Harry, seeing what he is doing, knocks back the rest of his drink too and then Draco steers them back out into the throng of people dancing.
helpful. Men had it so much easier. Trousers and a button down could work for all manner of occasions.
“Ooh, do you need extra protection because you’re a celebrity?” Greg asks. He is sitting on the bottom stair now, looking up at them.
Fortunately the practical half of the class was spent harvesting the fruits from the fluttering amaranth bushes they had pruned on Tuesday. It was a tricky process that involved one person holding down the fast moving branches and the other quickly grabbing the fruits when they popped out from behind their flowers. It was, Harry decided as he plucked a purple berry from the bush, quite fun, which meant that the last hour of class passed relatively quickly.
“Now can we get drinks?” Harry asked. Draco nodded, reluctantly dropping his hands from Harry’s waist. “Quick.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled him towards the bar. “Let’s beat the rush.”
*I’m sorry for the anachronism, but it’s only 2 years ahead of this timeline and I just really wanted to use this line.
“And you’re just now telling us?” McGonagall looked outraged. She stood, staring at Dumbledore with her hands on her hips.
Draco stared up at the canopy of his bed. He still couldn’t quite believe that his patronus was a ferret. He had tried it several more times after the initial ferret had burst forth from his wand, but it stubbornly stayed as a ferret. But at least only his friends knew about it. It wouldn’t do for the other Slytherins to find out. Particularly not as Blaise’s had turned out to be a very cool looking flying serpent and Pansy’s had been a longhaired cat, which was perfectly respectable. But a ferret? He sighed and rolled over onto his side.
The minutes tick by and Pansy eventually lowers her watch, unable to distract herself further. Banks is now reading a memo and she watches as his dark eyes scan the page, flashing from one side to the other. She looks away before he can catch her watching him. She doesn’t want him to think she might have any attraction to him.
“What? And risk not getting caught by the gossip witches?” Draco asks. Greg frowns at Draco, clearly confused.
Although, at the same time, she had wanted him to. Though she was pretty sure that was just the alcohol talking. What she really needed was spend time doing some introspection once she was sober this weekend.
“The audacity of these people!” Pansy exclaims later that afternoon as they’re counting the names that they gathered at the Ministry. “How arrogant do you have to be to wear the symbol of your secret society on your sleeve like that? They clearly don’t think anyone is going to investigate them.”
“Probably. It’s not like she can put it anywhere else. The Manor is the safest place for the moment as I doubt she can just walk into Gringotts. You know, as she’s an escaped Death Eater and all that.” He shrugged. He wanted them to change the subject. More than anything, he wanted Harry to stop staring at him with so much intensity.
“Do you have more that you need to tell me?” Draco shook his head. “Really?” He nodded. “Really really?” She lifted her eyebrows and her stare bored into his eyes. He could feel himself cracking. Circe, the Dark Lord had nothing on his mother.
“Hello, Ron,” George said. He reached over and tussled his brother’s hair. Ron scowled and flattened it back down.
He looked down at Dumbledore’s wand. He wasn’t sure why the headmaster had given it to him, or why he’d been so insistent that Harry take it. But Dumbledore had looked so desperate that Harry felt obligated to use it. That had been Dumbledore’s dying wish, after all. But before he left the room, he tucked his own wand into his pocket as well. It had saved him before. There was always chance it could again. And at the end of the day, it was
“Might as well Floo home,” he says. Harry would almost prefer to apparate, but he nods and follows Draco to the grate. “This fireplace has a special link to mine, so it doesn’t matter that I haven’t added you to the family floo wards yet, and then we can go ahead and do that once we’re there.”
“That was one of the worst days of my life,” Harry whispers. “I felt absolutely awful for what I had done to you.” In his mind’s eye, he can still see Draco lying on the bathroom floor, covered in blood, with Moaning Myrtle’s shrieks in the background.
“Yes, team. It means today will be the busiest day of the year. The day when ordinary house witches turn in to vicious book hunting animals, blinded by the need to get their precious children the correct textbooks, and eager to get the school shopping done early. If this were a zoo I'd say run for your lives, but this is Flourish and Blotts and we run from no challenge!” He punches a fist in the air. He feels his shirt ride up his stomach again but he ignores it. He stares around at his team, wild eyed and excited. They blink back at him. Nathalie blows a bubble with her gum and it pops with a loud snap.
“I talked to her,” Harry continued. “And she told me.” He related the story of his following Nagini into Lucius Malfoy’s study.
suggested was walking home. You’re the one who called it a romantic walk.” Draco cannot admit that Harry is right as that will mean that Harry has won, so instead he says nothing until they have crossed the street and are walking along the river path.
“Yes, well, they’re probably all true,” Hermione said. She moved her queen to a square where it was threatening Blaises’s king. “Check.” Blaise threw his arms up in defeat. “No, I haven't won yet!”
“Hey, don’t blame me. You started it,” Harry pointed out. “I wasn’t the one who ‘lost their gloves’.” He raised his hands and made air quotes.
“Come on,” Harry says. “Let’s get you into this costume.” He picks up the trousers and walks over to Draco. He holds them out and stands steady as Draco braces himself on his shoulder and clambers inelegantly into them. Then he buttons Draco into his jacket and slips boots onto Draco’s feet. When he’s done, he stands back to look at him.
He crouches down next to the cot and reaches out for her hand. He squeezes it gently as he sinks from his crouch until he is sitting on the floor. He doesn’t realize that he’s crying until two tears land on his knee.
“Yeah, me neither,” Draco says. “Absolutely miserable.” Harry reaches down and ruffles Draco’s hair. Draco sits up abruptly and smooths it back down.
He could still practically feel Pansy’s slap from last week on his cheek. It rested there, like a ghost, reminding him that she was out of his league. And that even if he had thought there might be something there, she was certain that there wasn’t.
Harry leaned against the wall at the back of the room and brooded into his beer. Part of him thought he should be standing moodily on a balcony, huddled against the wind, perhaps smoking a cigarette, while everyone else was happy inside. He felt that might fit his aesthetic more. He thought he had seen something like that in a movie. Or maybe a television show of Dudley's.  And as soon as the idea entered his mind, a door materialized next to him on the wall.
“Fine,” he said. “Every day I’m terrified of losing you.” Whatever Harry had been expecting Draco to say, it was not this. This was akin to saying that four letter word without actually saying it. Sort of. But when Harry thought about it, he was terrified of losing Draco too. Just under six weeks ago he would have thought this feeling impossible and yet here they were. And it was all Seamus’s fault. Or rather, it was all thanks to Seamus.
After that, it was like a spell had been broken. Hungry mouths pressed back together and they fell onto the bed, hands roaming, bodies flush against each other. At some point, Draco pulled his wand out of the pocket of his costume and muttered one of the spells he had memorized. Harry wasn’t sure what it did until he felt Draco’s hand on him again, only it was now slick with some sort of magical lubrication. Without thinking about it, he found himself thrusting gently into Draco’s hand.
“We both left the Great Hall around the same time and came here. Pansy and Blaise, for sure, think we’re having sex right now,” Draco said. Harry laughed nervously.
In unspoken agreement, they began to walk through the stacks, looking around in wonder as they did. Harry spotted a pair of broomsticks down one haphazard aisle. They looked large and unwieldy and Harry wondered what it would be like to fly one.
“It happened while stealing The Reliquary,” he says after a long moment. “He broke into a secure Ministry facility and died shortly after sending it to you. I don't actually know all the details. I didn't necessarily
Blaise sighed. At least he was making progress. Perhaps he could ask the Bloody Baron for more information. Not that the Baron could speak. But perhaps he could do some sort of charades type thing. Blaise shook his head. Charades with the Bloody Baron? What was next?
The office looked small on the outside, but in true wizard fashion is much larger on the inside. What had appeared to be one room of a dingy office building in Pimlico, is instead a cavernous room with three meter ceilings and lots of natural light that filters down from a large curved dome. There are many doors off of the main room, and Gillian ushers them through one of them.
“I’m gay,” he says again. “I like men. Er- in that way.” He should have started with some sort of preamble. But he’s said it now and he can’t go back and start this conversation over, as much as he would like to. Narcissa stands, walks back to the fireplace and rings the bell again.
“No time,” Draco says and it’s true. They had gone from bed to the shop in a matter of a few minutes.
“We both know that you didn’t do well with this last year,” Snape started to say, and it was all Harry could do not to snort derisively. Their last lesson had ended disastrously with Harry breaking into Snape’s mind, rather than keeping the professor out of his own. “But perhaps with Mr. Malfoy’s influence you will do better.” He turned to Draco. “Draco, I understand you’ve had training from, ah, family members?” Draco nodded.
“But first,” Harry said. “I want to dry off and get some hot chocolate.” He peeled off his damp gloves and put them on the table, as close to the fire as he could get them. Then he removed his cloak, swung it over the back of his chair before walking up to Madame Rosmerta behind the bar. Draco shrugged.
“Well, the cover is still there. But the pages are missing.” Parkinson’s eyes narrow as she stares at Malfoy.
“Can you make lattes?” he asks because if he’s going to have coffee, he might as well see if it can be coffee that he does like. Potter looks over at him in surprise.
As the minutes tick by, Draco becomes more and more nervous. Who is this Amelia person that they’re waiting on? He gnaws distractedly on a hangnail on his thumb before he realizes what he is doing and drops his hand back into his lap.
“If you don’t mind,” Draco says. “I’ll knock a few hundred galleons off my fee in return.” He can’t bring himself to look Potter in the eye as he does, so instead stares somewhere in the vicinity of his shoulder.
“I'll try to keep the sexual tension to a minimum,” Draco said with a smirk as he joined Harry at the table.
“-Let’s never speak of that day again,” Harry hissed, cutting him off. “But yes, I do remember that now.” He watched as Cormac inserted himself into a group fo Hufflepuffs who had already started dancing. “How does he get away with it?” he wondered aloud.
“Define tried.” This earns Draco another smirk. Potter spoons the meat, now browned, back out of the pot, and transfers it to a plate. Then he adds the mirepoix to the pot where the meat was. The vegetables sizzle as they meet the hot oil.
“No,” McLaggen says slowly. “I believe that they found the bodies the way that they were. But I do think that a wizard did kill them and tried to make it look like another Muggle had done it.”
Draco catches Greg’s eye above Luca’s head and notes the irritation there. He grins at his friend from across the store and receives a scowl in return. He crosses the floor and walks up to them.
“Very good.” Granger begins to shuffle papers together and Draco figures that is their cue to go. He stands up. Pansy and Potter follow his lead.
“My ears are burning,” the aforementioned redhead says. She has been in conversation with Hermione, standing behind Seamus, but Draco hadn’t noticed her. “Someone must be taking about me.” Seamus flushes. He mumbles something to do with Harry, that Draco can’t quite catch, but Ginny clearly does because she laughs and pats Seamus on the arm.
“Are you Ant and Dec?” Dean asked. He and Neville were wearing matching black suits and sunglasses. Neville had added talcum powder to his hair to make it appear gray.
“You’re not a burden,” Harry says quickly, reaching out and placing his hands on Malfoy’s arm in what he hopes is a comforting manner. “We don’t mean it that way. It’s just that being a handler takes up all of an agent’s time and it’s often hard to wrap one’s head around the fact that you will be spending that much time with one person. It’s like being assigned a new partner, and a new case at the same time.”
Harry stared over at the Slytherin table wistfully. He wanted to go over there as well, but he had the feeling a few more people might wonder why he would be sitting with Slytherins. Seamus at least had a reputation of being friendly, and sometimes rather more than friendly, with everyone.
As he brought the box up to his eye, there came a knock on the door. He dropped the box in alarm and looked over at Draco, his eyes wide. His breath was in his throat, but he had the presence of mind to pick up the Cup and stuff it back into Pansy’s bag.
And so Dobby began his tale. It started with Patterson finding him in the kitchens, where Dobby had volunteered for the mission because Patterson had said it would help Harry Potter. Dobby would not look at Harry when he said this, and Harry was almost glad for that because although he didn’t know what was coming in the story, he knew it ended with a man dead. He could only imagine how terrible Dobby felt. In fact, he could see it in the sag of Dobby’s tiny shoulders.
your costume” Blaise asked. Harry turned his attention to him and properly took in what he was wearing for the first time. He was wearing combat boots, brownish green trousers, a moss green tank top and what appeared to be backpack straps. He was also wearing dog tags, sunglasses and a large utility belt. Harry was surprised to see how in shape Blaise was, as the tank top he was wearing left little to the imagination. If Harry hadn’t already been dating Draco and decently sure that Blaise was straight, he might have considered making a pass at him. And, even just looking at him, he was sure that Seamus already had.
“Right now,” she says. “I don’t give a shit. I probably should, but at the moment, I have bigger concerns.” She closes her eyes again and takes a deep breath. “Now, we’re going to go out there and tell them that we didn’t find anything. Then we’re going to go our separate ways and meet up at the Leaky Cauldron-“
“Let me guess,” Draco said. “You were planning on him being in possession of the three Hallow things, weren’t you?”
“Draco, darling,” Narcissa says. “You should have heard yourself. Every summer you would come home and talk about all the things Potter had done. You were a tad obsessed.”
“Have dinner? Yes,” Harry says. “Ron invited us.” Draco knows damn well why they are here. Harry filled him in on the plan earlier that afternoon.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Yes, friends.” He smiled at them. This was helped by the fact that Hermione appeared a moment later behind Harry, quickly took in the situation, and followed Harry, Draco and Blaise down to the dungeons.
“By any chance, would you like to get some lunch?” she asked. She glanced down at her watch. “I know it’s a little past lunch time, but it looks like the house elves have a table spread for stragglers.”
“Yeah,” Ron agreed. “I know subtlety isn't your strongest suit, Harry, but you really need to work on it.”
“In which case, Potter, I think you can handle our precious Draco until Tuesday while I get caught up on paperwork and sleep.”
“Well,” Draco said once she had gone. “If the sexual tension had been high before, I think it’s going to, if anything, be even higher.”
“No, you couldn’t,” Ron said, grinning as he watched the pair of them. “This is much more fun when it’s not me that it’s happening to.”
“Hi,” she says. “How’d you sleep?” Is it his imagination, or is there a small smirk on her face? He decides to act as if there isn't.
embarrassing things. Like that time that Justin Finch Fletchley and I were caught snogging in a broom closet.” Harry, as usual, flinched at the word snogging.
He glanced over at Potter as the Gryffindors split off for their next lessons and he felt a pang of desire run through him. Even with his tie askew and his shirt untucked, Draco wanted him. Merlin, they’d only fucked once and Draco was undone by the thought of him.
wardrobe, along with most of the things strewn around his bedroom and ensuite. Draco hadn’t thought this was possible, but as his clothes all but fly out of the suitcase, spilling all over the floor, it’s obvious that’s exactly what’s been done. Well shit. And with no magic, he’s going to have to put all of this away by hand.
A house elf appears in front of Cormac to take his drink order. Pansy convinces the elf to bring her a fresh glass of pinot noir as well, even though she’s only halfway through her current glass. Cormac raises his eyebrows at her but says nothing, which makes her like him just a little bit more. Which only means that maybe he’s not the
“Yes, well, touché.” Harry leaned forward and reached into Draco’s lap. He wrapped a hand around Draco’s erection and squeezed it gently.
“Get your kit off,” Harry says. He shrugs out of his jacket and tosses it over the back of the sofa that sits in front of the fireplace. Draco follows suit, though he places his jacket more carefully than Harry does, worried about the glass memory phials in the pockets. The undetectable extension charms should keep them safe, but one can never be too careful.
“Oops,” said a disembodied voice. “I should have mentioned that.” There was a rustle of fabric and Harry appeared behind Pansy.
“Prat,” Harry says affectionately. He bends down and kisses Draco briefly on the nose before disappearing into the bathroom. Draco hears the shower turn on. He groans, then forces himself to sit up. Uncapping the potion, he throws it back in one go, shuddering at the bitter aftertaste. A moment later, the warmth from the potion starts to spread through his body and he feels well enough to get out of bed.
“What? Now?” Harry shrugs. He removes his hands from Draco’s waist and instead reaches up and takes one of the hands that Draco has draped around his neck.
“Shit, you’re right.” And then he started to giggle. Harry looked quizzically at him. “Just think how funny it would have been to be arrested for underage magic right now.”
“Ta,” Harry says, raising his mug at Ron who mirrors the gesture. He blows on the hot liquid and takes a small sip. He burns the tip of his tongue and so puts the mug down on the floor next to his feet for the time being. “No,” he continues. “Nothing secret about the Battaglia dinner. They were using the dinner we were at as a cover to take out a rival family.” Harry shrugs. “All I did was knock everyone out and call local authorities.”
“Thanks,” Draco says. He points his wand down at his ankle. “Episkey.” Instantly the pain that had been growing steadily while he had been sitting there dissipates. Greg straightens up and pulls Draco to his feet.
“I was just surprised to hear his name, is all,” he says. His heart is hammering in his chest. Of all the things he would have thought Massi would show him - that he thought even existed in the world - this was not one of them. He forces himself to look at the Hand. It is shriveled and dried, just like the Hand of Glory that he bought at Borgin and Burke’s before his sixth year. It could be any Hand of Glory. Oddly, this makes it seem less sinister to Draco.
“I’ve missed this,” Draco says softly. “I know it’s only been a few days, but I’ve missed being near to you. Alone that is. Are we sure he’s not going to wake up?”
“Do it,” Massi says. “Unzip my trousers. Pull my cock out. Get on your dirty knees and put it in your filthy mouth.” Draco frowns at him. His body is telling him that yes, he wants to do that. Dear Merlin, he wants to put Massi’s dick in his mouth. But his mind is telling him that actually, he really doesn’t want to do that and that this is wrong.
“I mean,” he said. “I could talk about my ideas for the future, but I would much rather talk about things like how beautiful you look right now.”
“Of course.” This morning felt like forever ago now. He had entirely forgotten they’d brought brooms and was glad that Blaise had remembered to carry them out when they left: or else their broomsticks would have been another three things they’d be having to find now. He tossed Blaise the other old broomstick and he caught it.
He pours himself some more coffee, refilling the mug to the top, and then gets himself a bowl of cereal before sitting down across the table from Greg. Greg turns the page and one of the pictures on the page he has just finished reading catches Draco’s eye. The picture is of an older gentleman with a large, bushy, gray mustache. The man is waving at the camera as he enters a revolving door. Even without thinking about it, Draco knows that this man is Heilgar Mott
“Harry gave you his invisibility cloak and that ring, did he not?” Draco looked down and found the amulet still hanging around his neck.
“She’s seemed rather stressed at work,” Harry says, backpedaling. Really, right before Christmas is not the time to ask if your best friend’s wife has perhaps been kidnapped and replaced by an imposter. Unless, in fact, she has been, in which case they should try to get her back
“You there! Fight me. I dare you, you lily livered toad scum!” Harry ignored the tiny knight and made his way up to the Room of Requirement.
“I was just as shocked as you when the Ministry said they wanted me to work for them,” Draco says. Susan seems to come to a decision as she nods once.
“Dancing,” Seamus said firmly. After all, Justin was still around somewhere. “At least for now.” A wicked smile crossed Cormac’s face as he followed Seamus to the dance floor. It was a smile that both excited and scared Seamus. It always had.
He fumbles in Massi’s jacket pocket, looking for his wand. Instead he finds a small bottle. He pulls it out and looks at it. The writing on it is in Italian, but as he stares at it, the Reliquary translates.
He was grinning from ear to ear as he looked around at all the happy faces. The mood was one of celebration, so much so it took Harry a while to even wonder whether or not they’d suffered any casualties. He looked around the hall, taking in the sea of happy faces, trying to see who might not be there. But all of his friends seemed to be accounted for.
“Harry,” Draco cried. He ran to him and knelt down beside him, covering Harry’s nakedness with his own robes until a set appeared for him. Slowly, Harry’s eyes blinked open. “Harry.” Draco put a hand to his cheek and stroked it while Harry came more to his senses.
A brief stop at his house - very brief - just enough time to pick up his invisibility cloak which is his most valuable piece of (possibly not sanctioned) spy equipment, not enough time to get emotional - and then Harry apparates to a quiet street, a few streets over from his mark. He slips under the invisibility cloak and begins to walk.
Did they receive some odd looks from the rest of the student body for sitting together? Yes. Did they care? Not in the slightest.
But now she is here for Draco’s veritaserum training and this could give her the evidence that she needs to jeopardize Harry’s career. A small voice in Harry’s head says that it was Harry himself who jeopardized his own career, which he acknowledges and then ignores. There’s no helping it now.
“Don’t look so grumpy,” he says. Draco continues to scowl at him, but allows Potter to uncross his arms and take his hand. Narcissa puts a hand across her chest.
He wonders if they will ever reach a point where neither of them can deny their feelings anymore, for Harry is now quite sure that Draco feels the same way that he does.
“And the wizarding world’s gone into a mandatory lockdown, as of,” Potter checks his wristwatch. “Twenty minutes ago.”
Ron, thankfully, turned out to be just as bad at Occlumency as Harry was when he first started, which made Harry feel much better about himself. Though he was quickly shown up as Ron began to master it much faster than he had.
“We were married,” Harry continued. “And you were an Auror and I was seemingly a chef. Or I owned a restaurant? I couldn’t quite tell. But Hermione and Blaise were married too - I saw their wedding photo on the mantlepiece. And we were happy. God, Draco, we were so happy.”
have a choice then.” Tusneem shrugs expansively. “Yes, fine. I will work for the Ministry, even though, had circumstances been different, I’m sure there would have been no way in hell that you would have hired me.” Tusneem shrugs again.
“Enough for the entire top three years, sir,” Dobby squeaked. “The kitchens like to be prepared.” Dumbledore gave a satisfied nod and dismissed the house elf.
“Because,” Massi starts to say. He is clearly flustered. Draco moves his head again and nuzzles Massi’s neck. “Affanculo - because the other person you’re dating works for the British Ministry of Magic, which means he’s also an enemy of the family. And probably an enemy of yours too.”
“This is amazing,” Harry says as soon as he finishes his latest mouthful of food. Draco beams at him.
When the six of them retired to the Slytherin Common room (which was the only way to convince Colin to just go to bed and not follow them), they found a small pile of presents placed under a miniature tree. Draco nudged Harry and smirked as they made their way over to the table, because it was next to the couch on which they had, ahem, fooled around. It was all Harry could do not to giggle as Blaise and Hermione sat down on it. Presumably, though, it had been cleaned since then.
“I love how you’re talking so casually about my death,” Harry says, smirking as Draco looks horrified.
“Cool,” Draco says. He makes a mental note of where in the entrance hall this spot is. Right under the large dome in the ceiling.
“Did you cry a lot then?” Potter asks, as though he’s asking what Draco’s favorite breakfast was at Hogwarts.
“We have things we need to talk about,” he says. Draco nods. He chews on his lip. “Tomorrow is the dinner with the Luczkowski family. Do you have any more details on the Battaglia’s plan for them?”
“Yeah,” Draco agreed. “If anything, we’re antagonizing each other.” Draco elbowed Harry back at this point, so Harry turned and shoved him. Draco batted his hands away. “See?”
“A wizard,” Harry says. “I’m sure lots of wizards haven’t been to the cinema. Not everyone is comfortable with muggle things.”
“Thank you, Susan,” Harry says. She chews on her bottom lip for a moment before turning and walking down the corridor. Once she’s gone, Harry turns back to the others.
“Move,” Harry hisses at him. Malfoy blinks as though coming out of a dream and then begins to run in the direction that Harry indicates.
“It’s been a while,” Seamus says to Draco later in the evening. The game had ended a short while earlier and most people have dispersed into other rooms. Draco has lost track of Harry but is sure he will find him before the evening is out. Harry won’t let him walk the few meters across the street to his own house alone after all.
“Possibly. I’ve got to get over there to help,” Draco says. “Merlin, this is like being a prefect again.” He strides out of the room and over to his closet. He pulls out the first outfit he finds.
“We should talk,” the taller man says. He pushes his way into the backroom with more authority than Harry thinks he should have and puts his hand against the hidden magical panel in the side of shelving unit. Harry’s mouth falls open when the panel gives a happy ding and the shelves move to the side. He shuts it quickly and follows McLaggen into the Cooler. He does his best not to feel like McLaggen has violated the space that Harry created, because at the end of the day, he
“Outside?” Ron started to explain, but then shook his head and took her arm, leading her out of the crowded dance floor and over to the side of the room. He pointed at a door set into the wall next to a large, arched window that Pansy was decently sure had not been there earlier in the evening. She could see an outdoor furniture set, bathed in warm, orange light from what she assumed was a fireplace. She reached for the door handle, but Ron put a hand on her arm, stopping her.
Dinner seemed to drag by, particularly as Harry had already finished eating by the time Draco had walked in, but eventually he saw the blonde stand up. He watched as Draco left the Great Hall and then slowly followed him.
He remembers finishing the book, sure. He remembers reading the book, and that insatiable need to inhale the words off of the page. But for the life of him, he does not remember any of the content. He glares at the empty cover of the book, which lays open on the bed. He feels like the book is mocking him and he does not like it. He picks up the cover and hurls it across the room. It hits the wall with a dull thud and then falls to the floor. Draco hurries over to it and examines it fearfully, in case he has damaged it. The book cover is fine. It is still inexplicably empty, but it is not damaged.
“Very well, I will just change the ownership signatures then,” he says. He waves his wand over the watch face in a complicated pattern and then taps it once. “There. That should do it.” He releases Draco’s wrist and grins up at him. “You’re all set. Welcome to the Ministry of Magic.”
“Fine,” Pansy says. “You can have ice cream.” He punches the air in triumph, still holding his chopsticks, and sends a piece of salmon hurtling past her face.
He looked around and double checked that the cloak covered them both - and their clothes. It would not do to be found out because part of their trousers were visible.
, Blaise,” Draco said, joining the conversation. “You have no tact. You just assume your pretty face will get you everywhere.” Terry looked nervously from Blaise to Draco and back again.
Draco doesn’t notice for the first couple of runs down the beginner slope. The first time he passes Harry, he assumes that Harry will manage to extricate himself from the snowbank. On the second time, he reckons that Harry is just about to free himself. He doesn’t notice that Harry hasn’t moved from the place where he first plowed into the snowbank.
He watches with fascination as the machine in front of him spins the clothes around in circles. He had followed the instructions on the wall, putting the clothes in, then the powder, and then starting the machine with the Muggle money from the emergency stash he had found in the Cooler. Now, however, there’s nothing to do but wait for the machine to finish and by the looks of it, he has at least forty minutes before then.
“Really, Harry,” Draco scolded as soon as they were alone. “Scourgify? It’s like you’ve never had to clean yourself up under pressure before.”
Then they watch on a map as he makes his way back to Milan. At least they know that he wasn’t lying about that. Harry books them on the next train down from the mountain and soon they are checking into another luxurious hotel, this time in the heart of a city. Draco delights in the chocolates on his pillow at the turndown service and they both enjoy their gigantic bathtub (“Still not as big as the one in the prefect’s bathroom,” Draco says. “No bath is
“Oh, err, I didn't know they could have uh, babies” he said rather awkwardly. He could see Kingsley smile slightly at his obvious discomfort. More a twitch of the corner of his lip really but Harry figured that was all that was allowed at the moment.
Harry had only laughed at him and let him know where they could meet. He had chosen a bigger town a ways away from Hogsmead. A small muggle pub he had never brought any of the Weasleys to. Malfoy had mentioned it once when he told Harry about hiding from angry classmates during eighth year.
“Please, just let us find him and we will all go with you.” Narcissa Malfoy pleaded with Kingsley who looked put out, but not unsympathetic.
“A dementor is born from the pained scream of a soul. That’s what we heard back there.” Kingsley said motioning behind them. Harry looked back for the first time since leaving through the double doors, he was surprised to see a crowd of people hovering about and watching them. They were too far for Harry, even with his glasses, to see who they were.
“Dementors are not born exactly. They're more. . . . ..brought into being.” he said.  His eyes were still trained on the boat house, switching between the door and the dementor hovering above it.
“Ah, I see you’ve gotten the message? Go on then, I'll take care of the class and cover for your next one.”
He saw Granger’s eyes widen, with guilt or surprise, but Potter remained impassive staring at the floor and Weasley only continued to sneer.
“I was told to leave.” Ron said standing to his full height. He refused to take the blame for the way things had ended up.
The scream went on and on, drowning Harry and pulling him down deeper into his despair over the senseless loss of life. It was  like a banshee’s scream or a sirens song, never ending and painful, a death knell and acknowledgment of suffering.
Kingsley looked at him slightly through the corner of his eye, not breaking pace behind the Malfoys.
“If your saying that Draco just encountered the dead body of Severus Snape, then yes Potter, that is more than likely a new dementor.” Mr. Malfoy said coldly. Harry scowled at him. It was almost good to know that the man was still an arse.
He was not only touchy, but clingy. Both arms wrapped around one of Goyle’s as they walked. His head tucked into Zabin’s back as they stood together. His arms would wrap around Pansy’s waist when they were next to each other. Sometimes he would even tuck himself under Ron’s arm while they sat, Hermione cuddled under the opposite arm, and as they talked he would play with the fingers of Hermione’s hand.
Draco took the small bottle of dittany out from the low table next to them and dabbed some on a cloth instead of responding. It was true, much of the truly terrible things he had done since he was 15 and his father had gone to prison had been forced on him. But he knew better than to try and change the minds of the golden trio. Harry Potter had made up his mind about Draco Malfoy when he was eleven years old and nothing was going to change that. The Savior of the Wizarding World was a stubborn git with a hero complex and an air of superiority to rival any pureblood or dark lord out there.
“Right then, good luck with him Harry.” Kingsley told him with a wink, before disapparating on the spot leaving Harry alone.
Lost in thoughts of red headed, grey eyed babies Ron was surprised by the patronus that burst to life in front of him.
“We don't need your boy, just the two of you. We saw where his allegiance lay and who’s wand defeated your lord. I don't think for a minute anything he did wrong here was his idea.” he said with a glare towards Malfoy Sr.
“A new set of Weasley twins.” Ginny said softly, any anger she had in her eyes was gone as she gazed at the boy.
“Malfoy? Malfoy can you hear me?” Dean was asking him in a low voice, when Pansy Parkinson rushed through the open door.
“Umm yeah? Like,you and me? It was a good date? I thought? I felt like we were on the same page anyways.” Harry felt more than a little foolish. He was wrong for having presumed of course but he pushed on. Had no desire to have his first date end on a bad note.
Suddenly a small black shape began to materialize above the small shack. Harry squinted, trying to make out the shape but it seemed to be shifting as if not sure what it wanted to be. It looked more like a black patronus than anything solid.  Next to him one of the auror’s spoke up.
Harry only blinked at him. He had no idea what to even begin to think about that. Truthfully it sounded more like a fairy tale than anything else, but he had the Elder wand in his hand and the Invisibility cloak in his pocket so who was he to say it wasn't true.
The Malfoy’s and their auror guard both turned to look at the crowd they had gathered. Mrs. Malfoy looked shocked for a moment but covered it quickly. Mr Malfoy though, looked at Dean and Luna with regret and grudging admiration, nodding once in acceptance.
Draco could feel his eyes begin to water again. He had held in his sobs as they had walked back to the eighth year dormitory, back ramrod straight as he struggled to keep up with Neville and keep his defenses up against the trio behind him. He had felt stupid to believe that his apology would be accepted and mortified beyond belief that the rejection had stung just as badly as it had in first year. There had been physical blows this time instead of just a verbal lashing, but both had reduced him to tears and made him feel pathetically small.
“I forget you're so young sometimes. And so unaware of so many things. I’m sure Miss Granger would know already.” he said it was a teasing lilt to his voice but Harry rather thought it was a tad insulting. He could feel his ears heating up in embarrassment.
Myrtle was the only “person” who knew about him and Draco. They had been together since the very beginning of sixth year when Neville had come across the crying Slytherin in the very same bathroom Neville sometimes took his lunch in. Neville had been wary at first, but Draco didn't make any moves or cruel remarks, only watched him with red rimmed eyes under disheveled hair. Neville had plucked up every piece of Gryffindor courage he could find and sat across from Draco, pulling out his lunch and rolling an apple over to him.
“Puberty does such nice things to wizards.” he had murmured, causing the blush Neville had been fighting to win and spread rapidly across his cheeks.
When he was free Dean moved them onto the floor and Parkinson yanked the pillows and blankets to the floor making them a nest. Dean sat outside the blankets until Malfoy settled into her arms and then he moved away, heading to where Harry and the rest of them stood still watching the scene.
Harry could barely breath between laughing and coughing but he still managed to wheeze out a response.
The sudden silence was almost as painful as the screaming had been. It felt like it had gone on for hours, but Harry knew it had only been seconds.
“Well, yes?” Harry ventured “I like you Malfoy, and I'm pretty sure you like me. I thought you knew i was asking you on a date tonight when i asked you out.”
They sat there until Draco pulled himself back together and stood up. Even after the whole display, Neville had been pleasantly surprised when he reached a hand down to help him up as well. He had smiled nervously down at Draco who looked surprised to be looking up at him instead of down.
scar worship! with Neville and Draco!  because harry/draco was just too easy with this one. they can make an appearance next time.
Harry eyed the small dementor still hovering menacingly, now that he was sure what it was. Mr. Malfoy followed behind her, her long stride keeping her ahead. Harry continued to follow at a slower pace, wary of the wraith. He looked over at KingslEy who had a troubled look on his face, his eyes darting up and away from the dementor periodically.
Harry was stunned. Everyone knew Lucius Malfoy had escaped Azkaban in the first war by claiming to be under the Imperius. That he would allow his son to claim the same under his own hand to guarantee his safety was completely unexpected from the man Harry thought he was. The older Malfoy he had seen through Voldemort's visions had been a broken shell of a man. Even the man Harry had seen only minutes before, still cowering behind his lord, seemed ages away from the desperate father in front of him. That Mrs. Malfoy loved her son was obvious from the first, but he had never realized that Mr. Malfoy might love him as well.
“Let go of me! I won’t be going anywhere without my son!” Lucius Malfoy yelled at the Auror who grabbed his arm.
“It's far enough away that even the muggleborns didn't want to  go but still close enough to be able to apparate to. I never saw anyone I knew there.” he had explained airily one night while they drank butterbeer on top of the astronomy tower
Kingsley stared at them both almost dispassionately before sighing and nodding to the aurors holding the couple. As they walked out Harry found himself walking automatically with them. The air outside was still hazy with smoke. Harry tried not to look around at the destroyed castle, he kept his head down and his eyes trained on the red of Kingsley’s robes.
“But we don't have to do anything obviously! If you uh, if you wanna take things slow thats ok with me.” he smiled softly at Malfoy “i got us a room but its more than ok if you just want to sleep. We can just chat for a bit and then head to bed. Separately! I can take the couch even if you want.”
“He’s lucky they take after their bearer.” she said under her breath nudging Ron on the back as he headed to meet Blaise and lighten his load.
Malfoy went pale, his hands clenched into fists at his side and his breathing became rapid. “It is not a pureblood school. The school is for Muggle born children to be able to learn and integrate into the magical world. To be able to better understand themselves so they won't feel so alone and freakish growing up. So they know that there are other people out there experiencing the same thing.”
“I’m ready when you are auror Redding.” she told him. Redding jumped, jostling Draco only to freeze at the look on Mrs. Malfoy’s face.
“Yeah, mate. I am. Come with me if you want. Luna and I spent the summer alternating with him at our place. Pansy came with him most times. She can’t sleep in a bed, so the floor it is.”
Most of the deatheaters had been stunned watching their lord crumble to ash before them. A few had gotten away, but those not quick enough had been handled easily by the aurors who had shown only seconds too late.
“I came as soon as you called, just like I always do.” Ron replied, one hand sliding through Draco’s hair. The other ran soothing circles around the protective cocoon holding children.
Harry heard Hermione’s relieved breath next to him and was shocked at the relief he felt at those words. He knew Malfoy was a git of the highest order but every time he saw him ever since sixth year there had been nothing but fear and desperation in his eyes. Harry had been more than ready to speak up for him no matter what it took, but hearing Kingsley say that Draco wasn't going to be arrested was a weight of his shoulders he wasn't even aware he had.
Harry had watched Malfoy cry for longer than he was proud to admit before deciding to do anything. Before he was able to move though, the door had crashed open and Dean had come rushing in. He stopped to take in the scene only for a split second before rushing to Malfoy’s side on the furthest bed in the room. He grabbed Malfoy’s pale face and forced  his head up, pressing his forehead harshly against his. Malfoy continued to whimper and pull at the blankets but the screaming and pleading had stopped.
Harry wanted to ask him to stand up again so that he could see the look overall. He wanted to ask him to raise his arms up so he could watch the shirt ride up over his stomach so that Harry could see the thin trail of white blonde hair that let downwards. He didn't though. He took a second to let the little fantasy play out in his head before fixing his attention on the man before him.
Ron got out of the car and stood looking at the home he had grown up in looming over him. He spent 18 years living in that house. It had been a safe place for him and anyone else his mother had decided to feed. They had planned a way and fought battles in and around the Burrow for 7 years. Looking at it surrounded by the inky blackness of night Ron could feel his heart break just a little when he thought about the last time he had been there. He spared a quick glance at his children, who were both trying to shove their way into the front seat, and his husband. He took strength from the proud smile on Draco’s face and moved towards the Burrow.
Harry looked at his shoes to get away from the sad and confused stares everyone was giving him. He heard Mrs.Weasley sigh and heard Mr Weasley murmur that she should go ahead and open her last present. He listened to the rustle of the paper coming off and finally looked back up at the inhale of breath he heard. Looking up he saw Mrs. Weasley with a hand covering her mouth, tears in her eyes. Next to her Mr Weasley wasn't much better. All the weasley siblings got up to look at what she had been given.
Draco stared Neville straight in the eyes, taking stock of every fleck of gold, brown, and green that made up the hazel orbs. No one Draco had ever met had the same eyes Neville had. They were a perfect mixture of warm, soothing colors that hid nothing of his true feelings. Draco knew that his were the opposite. A gray so dark they were almost silver. Storm clouds that hid  the true nature of what was inside whether he liked it or not.
“You’ll take care of him won’t you Mr. Potter?” she asked, her soft, posh voice so much closer to Draco’s cadence than his fathers.
He saw a shadow move in the corner of his eye and turned to see the dementor move away from them, now fully formed if a bit small. Behind him he heard the rushing sound of a portkey activating, sending Mr. Malfoy with Snape’s body directly to the ministry. The remaining auror finally moved into the boat house now that the path was clear. He came back seconds later with Draco in his arms, much like Mr. Malfoy held Snape.
Harry sighed and began his walk back up to the castle. He was tired and Draco needed a bed. As he walked he felt the vial in his pocket and wondered what kind of memories a loving godfather left their beloved godson.
Harry was looking at Hermione in shock but he could see that she was just as shocked and confused as he was.
“You’ll take care of him won’t you Mr. Potter?” she asked, her soft, posh voice so much closer to Draco’s cadence than his fathers.
Ron took her hands in his own and lowered them between them. He looked at her and his dad behind her. They were both frowning,but he could see shame and understanding in both their eyes. He looked around at his sibling and their significant others. He made eye contact with Hermione who had a small encouraging smile on her face.
“You want me Malfoy, don't even try to deny it. I've seen the way you look at me, trust me i'm looking back the same way believe me. I want to touch every inch of you. Please baby, let me.” he begged.
“Let go of me! I won’t be going anywhere without my son!” Lucius Malfoy yelled at the Auror who grabbed his arm.
Malfoy closed his eyes and let out a long breath before fixing his eyes on Harry, running them over his face as if looking for something. His shoulders slumped and he leaned back against the wall.
Kingsley stared at them both almost dispassionately before sighing and nodding to the aurors holding the couple. As they walked out Harry found himself walking automatically with them. The air outside was still hazy with smoke. Harry tried not to look around at the destroyed castle, he kept his head down and his eyes trained on the red of Kingsley’s robes.
Mrs. Malfoy had made it into the boat house, not even glancing at the spectre above her head. Her handler let her go in alone, clearly unwilling to pass beneath it. Following her lead Mr. Malfoy was also unhanded and marched inside, though Harry could see the tension in his shoulders as he made to pass.
Harry opened his eyes and saw the others still in front of him, clutching themselves with their hands over their ears. Mrs. Malfoy was openly crying and leaned heavily into her husband's arms. Kingsley had his hands to his head but his eyes were open, looking soberly at the boat house through squinted eyes.
Harry spun around surprised at his interruption. He snarled and drew wand at the man’s words, before realizing he was carrying Snape in his manacled arms. The sight saved him from a nasty hex but Harry wasn't going to let him get away with bringing up Sirius.
It felt like Draco was screaming directly next to him. Right into his ear and across every nerve ending Harry had.
“You know Potter, had you left the Weaselette and confessed some sort of reciprocated feelings for me afterwards, I would have been ecstatic. But that you thought I would be the kind of person to be actively complicit in this kind of thing makes me wonder who exactly  you think you have feelings for. Because it can't be me. If you knew me even a little bit you would know what family means to me and what lengths I would go to to keep them together.”
“Oh I don't have to tell Ginevra a thing. All i have to do is tell the hogwarts board of governors about the sexual harassment i experienced tonight. Those hearings are done behind closed doors and their rulings are not made public unless it directly relates to a student.” Malfoy explained breezily. He sneered at Harry one last time before he turned and apparated away leaving Harry alone in the alley.
“Yes, absolutely. My son did nothing he wasn't forced into. I’ll testify I imperiused him myself” he stated.
Draco smiled and tried to infuse some warmth into his eyes, trying to be reassuring. He wasn't sure if it worked but he felt the muscles under his fingertips relax and saw Neville give him a watery smile in return.
“The Burrow is a safe place for any Weasley son. Or any Malfoy.” his dad said. The look in his eye said he knew exactly why Ron wanted certainty in that.
He shook the thought off and continued the trek up the hill, looking again for a bushy head of hair, swallowing painfully when he didn't see one. Ron's steps stuttered when he still failed to see Hermione. She said she would be here, and if she wasn't he wasn't sure he could go through with it. She had been the only one to keep contact with them when he and Draco had left England. Unlike Harry she had fully supported his relationship with Draco, coming to their wedding and being there as soon as she could after the birth of the twins. She was the only aunt they had ever known. When Hermione had married Blaise, Draco had been heartbroken to be unable to attend the wedding, but even then Hermione had proved to be the best friend they could have ever asked for by coming to visit them in Seattle and doing a small muggle ceremony with just the six of them.
“What is it? Are you still hurt? I went to Pomfrey first but she hadn't seen you. Do you need to see her?”
Malfoy made a face that seemed halfway between confused and wary. Harry tried to settle the huge awkwardness between them by closing the distance between them to reach for the pint he had left on the bar when he had risen to greet Malfoy. He reached across the blonde and offered him a small smile.
“Can’t rightly be the regular git right about now Longbottom, come see me in an hour perhaps i can be a bitch to you about you eating in the lady’s lav.” he said.
Ron was frozen in place looking at her. He had no idea what to do. Part of him wanted to run back down the hill and throw himself into the back seat of the rented car and hold his boys to his chest while resting his head on the swell of Draco’s belly. Another part though, wanted nothing but to run to his mum and fall to his knees, lamenting so many lost years. His heart lurched suddenly and Ron realized with a jolt that his boys would only ever know this person in front of him as their grandmother. No amount of stories he had told them over the last 10 years would be able to capture Molly Weasley in all her glory and now it was too late for more than a few days at most.
Harry wasn't too sure what to think about the few number of them to actually be present for the battle. Tonks and Moody had been outliers on the force, morally good and not just able to follow orders. He knew if he was going to go ahead with his plans he would have to do something about that. But for now he was ok to sit between Tonks and Remus and grieve for what was lost.
He had stayed up later than usual to speak with Pansy through the floo after everyone had gone up to bed. She had taken her NEWTS remotely over the summer while Draco was standing trial for war crimes with his family.
“I forget you're so young sometimes. And so unaware of so many things. I’m sure Miss Granger would know already.” he said it was a teasing lilt to his voice but Harry rather thought it was a tad insulting. He could feel his ears heating up in embarrassment.
Fred spoke next, arm wrapped around who Ron recognized as Angelina something. Probably Weasley if the possessive way they held each other was any indication.
None  of the Slytherin’s seemed to think any of it was odd or even out of character. It made Harry wonder if this was how Malfoy always was out of view of everyone else, deep in the halls of the Slytherin dungeons. Hermione had said he finally felt free enough to show affection openly now that he was without any of the pressures Malfoy Sr had imposed on him growing up.
“Is going to be at your place tomorrow Harry?  I'd love to know how tonight went for him. He must have been so excited for tonight. To be able to see how all his hard work paid off. I'm only sad i had no idea about it until it was done but Draco mentioned letting me take a tour with Rosie for the next school year.”
Snape's other eyebrow rose to join the first and he opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by a voice coming from his office behind him.
“There you have it. Draco did nothing wrong under his own choice. But” he paused gritting his teeth “Please-” he ground out “allow me to find my son before we are separated forever.”
“Yes, absolutely. My son did nothing he wasn't forced into. I’ll testify I imperiused him myself” he stated.
Ron started to agree before remembering the entire reason they were so late to begin with. He could still feel the wary glances of their audience and he wasn't ready to let them know more than necessary. Luckily Bill broke in before he could say anything.
Dinner flew by easily with hardly any more awkwardness. Harry made sure to pay attention and tried not to let his attention wander. Malfoy laughed loudly and spoke with his hands,constantly waving them around. If he hadn't been so beautiful Harry would have been sad that he wasn't able to hold his hand.
Draco loved Sundays. Sunday was the one day a week he could not only sleep all day, but had the room to himself for most of the day. He could stay in bed until the sun rose in the sky and cut a sharp light across his bed and forced him to rise and into the next part of his day.
this is also kind of a sickfic though theres nothing too graphic, just an unsympathetic Draco making fun of a sick Harry.
Then Narcissa Malfoy showed up to the train station over Easter hols, calling Malfoy Baby, and Sweetness, and Precious, and My Littlest Love while running her hands over his face and his hair, clutching him to her chest and wrapping her arms around him, pressing kisses to his cheeks and forehead and everything made sense.
“Could we have our Christmas presents delivered on Christmas Eve?” Pansy asked when no one else began to speak.
“There had better be at least one bloody reporter here,” Harry muttered to Draco as they neared the doors to the Great Hall. “I want them to see that it’s done, tell the world about it and then
“-Seamus, again, this doesn’t sound all that embarrassing. This just sounds like you relating another one of your escapades.”
He tries to think about what he might offer to do if he heard Harry being tortured. But things are different now. Right? He’s not a sixteen year old boy anymore. He knows how to fight. He’s fully capable of holding his own against another wizard, or even, he hopes, a group of wizards. And more importantly, he knows he’s not alone. He has Pansy and - gag - McLaggen, not to mention Mortimer Banks and that other bloke who’s apparently on the anti-Simi-whatsit team. And Greg, in a pinch.
“That’s true. Though at school I thought you were straight.” McLaggen leans back in his chair and surveys Draco with his hands clasped behind his head.
“Just—“ Harry doesn’t bother to finish his sentence, merely grabs Ron’s hand and pulls him out of the back room. After a moment, Ron begins to move of his own volition. They wave at George as they pass him and while he raises his eyebrows at their abrupt departure, he doesn’t say anything.
“I’ll find you something less formal to wear in a bit.” Then he walks away, leaving Draco standing in the hallway.
“He’s the highest ranking in the Ministry. Stands to reason he might be the highest ranking in the Sim Soc.”
“It doesn’t seem to be,” she said without looking up. “Or I think you would have felt it when you pulled it out of the Sorting Hat.”
They sat in silence for a while, eating their respective dinners. Seamus was glad for the distraction from catching Justin’s eye across the room. Which is not to say that he entirely refrained from doing that, just that he did it slightly less often. Eventually, Neville noticed.
“Thank you,” Amelia says. She walks over to the chair and perches on the end of it, her back ramrod straight. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Pansy shift in her seat until she is mirroring the other woman.
“Are you ready for today?” Harry asks. Draco blinks blearily at him for a moment before his eyes snap open, bright with sudden attention.
“Fine, fine,” Draco said. He threw his arms up in surrender. “I’ll meet you outside, and then I promise you we can get some lunch.” Harry nodded and watched as he left the room again. He unbuckled his trousers for the second time that day, feeling distinctly like this would have been better done in a bathroom. He felt so exposed in the empty room. The cauldron bubbled across the table from him and Harry wondered if Snape had any sort of surveillance charms in the room. He hoped not.
“Point taken. Something else then?” But Massi is smiling. It is not a nice smile. It is the kind of smile that makes Draco very nervous. And with Truth or Dare, he has every right to feel nervous.
“What was that?” Harry asks. Draco rubs his eyes with one hand. He looks at his watch and then back at the window.
“While they’re gone,” Pansy said once the wall had slid shut. “Should we see what the anti-boy charms are for the Slytherin dorms?” Harry immediately put a finger to his nose.
“I think if it’s in the Reliquary it’s safe to assume that it’s accurate,” Hermione says. “But I will check with him after this meeting. Thank you, Malfoy. That is very informative. Unless you had more?” Draco shakes his head. “Right then, Parkinson and McLaggen. I want you to travel to the Isle of Skye and see what you can find out. Harry and I will visit Winola’s parents to see if they have heard anything.” Pansy nods and stands. She kicks the legs of McLaggen’s chair.
“Are you trying to say you like me being under you?” Harry asked in a voice so quiet that Draco almost could not hear him. Draco choked on the sip of his Negroni that he had just taken.
“Draco, Harry is dating you for reasons that none of us quite understand, but I don't think it's just for your looks.”
“Oh can they?” Harry caressed his way up to Draco’s waistband and then he slipped a finger under it.
“Oh, he is.” She continues to stand there, staring at Draco in interest, for a long moment. Then she says, “By the way, Draco, you don’t have to hide when I come into Flourish and Blott’s.”
They keep an eye out for other wizards but for the first three weeks, there are no signs of magical activity. They do manage to sneak into the vault that Hermione had mentioned on their third night in the Alps. Since they do not know which object precisely is going to be stolen, Harry throws caution to the winds and puts a covert tracking spell on all of the items that are housed there.
“So what are your plans for after Hogwarts?” Hermione asked. She and Blaise were ensconced in one of the booths at the side of the room. They were opposite each other across the table, but they were leaning close to hear above the music.
“Certainly,” Kreacher says again. He disappears with another loud crack and Draco looks sheepishly over at Harry.
“Thanks,” Massi mumbles. He waves it over himself, drying his swimming trunks and the wet spot that had spread from beneath him. “Draco, how are you feeling?”
“Where were we then?” He pulled Draco tight against him and was pleased to see a small smile lift the corners of Draco’s mouth.
Massi is tentative with it, like he’s still not sure how he got himself into this situation, but slowly his shoulders relax. Draco pushes his tongue into Massi’s mouth and tastes the whisky Massi had just been drinking. He feels Harry’s mouth on his neck and Harry’s hands on his shirt buttons. He keeps his mouth pressed to Massi’s, but returns to his one handed disrobing attempts and soon both his and Massi’s shirts are hanging open.
delicious, merely good in comparison. I see.” Draco frowns at him, but the only look on Potter’s face is one of amusement.
“Sure,” Ron said. He looked around the room. Unfortunately most of the available seating appeared to be taken. He was about to suggest going outside, when Pansy took his hand and led him over to the small graveyard that was in the corner of the room, where she promptly sat down on the thick grass that covered the floor there. She was immediately enveloped by the thick fog that hung in the air around the gravestones.
“I do. Or, rather, I did. Now, I’m not so sure.” Draco began to trace circles on the back of Harry’s hand with his thumb and Harry found some of his irritation melting away.
But is Harry altogether surprised? Not really. He’s been obsessed with Draco Malfoy in some form or another since he was fourteen.
“Dobby will get right on that,” he said. “Wait here and I will bring the four for your tower.” He scampered away, leaving Neville holding his tray of food. Neville picked up the doughnut and nibbled it while he waited.
“Oh, don’t tell me you’re going to tease him about this,” Draco said, smirking at Ron. “Say it isn’t so, Weaselby.”
All Harry wants is to keep Draco safe. He’s not sure what he will do if anything happens to Draco. And so the knot of terror that has been a constant in Harry’s stomach for the past few days reties itself and the bliss of having just woken up with Draco in his arms fades.
“December twenty second,” Draco says and Hermione gasps and sags in his arms. A sob escapes her lips.
“I don’t know which portrait your common room is behind,” Blaise protested. “There are thousands of portraits in this castle.”
They start on the top floor and work their way down, which means they start at Tusneem’s office. Nothing about Tusneem sparks, nor do any of his various secretaries - or at the very least, nothing sparks aside from their names. But Tusneem does appreciate the rendition of Jingle Bells that they sing to him and is even more thrilled when Pansy hands him a Peppermint Toad.
“Hi.” He sat down next to her and Draco took the seat next to Blaise, who was still frowning at the two of them.
“You just wish you were so lucky,” he says, opening his eyes again. “I already told you, not on the first date.”
He shifts until he is hovering over Harry, his shoulders taught, holding himself up. He bites his lip as Harry grasps his cock with a slippery hand. He looks down and sees that Harry’s other hand is working, gently opening up his hole, finger by finger. He closes his eyes and thinks about anything other than being inside Harry. He can’t get too excited now or he’ll never last. And he wants to savor this.
“Before you say anything,” he said. He had been thinking about what to say to Ron since he had lain down on his bed. “I just want to say, that Draco isn’t really the jerk we all think he is. I mean, he can be, but he can also be nice. Just like we can be jerks or we can be nice. I know you think he’s a slime ball and a good-for-nothing-”
“Yes, fine,” he said. “Come on.” Harry scooped up his bag and followed the blond out the door. They were unsurprised to find the corridor deserted and Draco took the opportunity to not so subtly run his fingers over the back of Harry’s hand. Harry glanced over at him and smiled.
“What?” When he had thought to contact Harry, he had not envisioned the conversation going like this.
“But you've only won five galleons?” Harry asked. His tone was dripping with sarcasm but he was worried that Malfoy would not pick up on it. The blond did, and stuck his tongue out at Harry.
“You never mentioned that there was a disturbance at that event you went to,” Greg says. Draco nearly chokes on his coffee.
“Harry,” Ron says, leaning forward to emphasize his point. “You’re family. Mum’s gonna love anyone you bring home.”
He realized, too late, that his wand was in Pansy’s bag which was back in the dining room. He would have to get by on his wits, and perhaps the element of surprise.
They stopped walking when they spotted the open door to the Great Hall and had a more subdued conversation that neither Hermione nor Blaise could hear. As they watched, the pair seemed to come to a decision. Blaise raised a hand in greeting as Harry and Draco began to walk towards them. Harry was walking faster than Draco and looked delighted about the fact that there was still food to be had.
“Amelia, he’s here. You should come and join us.” He holds it up to his ear and Draco thinks he can hear a small voice emanating from the watch. Whatever the voice says, it irritates Croaker because his face darkens. He lifts the watch to his mouth again.
“You’re probably wondering why I called the six of you here,” Dumbledore said once they were settled in chairs around his desk. The six students were fanned in a circle in front of the desk and Professor Snape stood behind Dumbledore’s right shoulder. Both professors looked grim.
Luckily Draco is almost at the end of his beer, so he picks it up and tips the rest back. Then he stands up, bids Hannah and Greg goodnight and follows Harry out into Diagon Alley.
“It’s too embarrassing, Seamus,” Harry protested. He covered his face with his hands and flopped backwards on the bed. He just wanted this day to end. It had been a complete rollercoaster of emotions from lust to anger to pain to shame. At least it seemed that Malfoy actually liked him. After all, the blond had stayed with him in the hospital wing and had actually seemed concerned about his wellbeing. Harry was not sure what to do with this information. In all honesty, he was not quite sure how it made him feel. His stomach knotted at the thought that Malfoy at least somewhat cared for him, but he was not sure if the knot was from stress or excitement.
“True. And you don’t want to miss the Flourish and Blotts Christmas Eve party,” Draco says. He nudges her in the ribs. She makes a horrified face.
Indeed, even just thinking back on it now, he found himself growing excited. He closed his eyes and imagined her lips on his again. Imagined her hands running through his hair. Imagined her hands running over his chest. Imagined her hands moving south and… It was too much. He reached into his pajama trousers and imagined that his hands were her hands.
“Won’t Madame Rosmerta recognize us?” Hermione asked. She nervously twisted a strand of hair between her fingers.
“‘Course.” Harry feels slightly dazed. He has never had to split the holidays between families before. He’s never even had to think about it. When he was with Ginny, there was no question as to where they would go for Christmas, but now… It quite suddenly hits Harry how real and serious his relationship with Draco is. It’s possibly the first serious one he’s ever had. Maybe he
“Blaise and I will go again,” Pansy said, pushing herself up from the table. “Although I’m starting to think you all invited us here just for this purpose.”
be irrational if something happened to someone you love.” Draco glares at her. “You know I’m right. Isn’t that why you did what you did sixth year?” Draco opens his mouth to protest and then shuts it, knowing she is, in fact, correct.
Pansy gets lucky with an ID on the book thief that Draco had caught. When she takes his fingerprints, it turns out that he has a very old arrest for improper use of magic by a minor. His name is Nicholas Wise.
“Well, then let’s apparate,” Draco says. It seems like the obvious answer. Potter nods his agreement. Draco glances at the clock on the mantlepiece. While it feels like he and Potter have been bantering for an age, it turns out it is still only seven minutes past six. There is plenty of time to finish the wine. “And let’s have the wine. Thank you for bringing it, by the way.” He walks over to the kitchen and rummages through his drawers for a bottle opener. As he starts to work it into the cork, he finally takes a good look at the label.
“It’s seventeen for wizards,” Ron said quickly. He was only a few months off of this and March could not come soon enough.
The dumpling appeared on Harry’s plate just as Bellatrix laughed particularly loudly and Harry was grateful for the distraction that it provided. It was larger than he had anticipated and he had to bite it in half to eat it. Harry thought that it was very good, but after the beef, all other food seemed to pale in comparison.
“What? How?” Draco turned, the arithmancy instantly forgotten. Hermione gestured to the paper. Draco glared at her for a moment before turning to it. Hermione rolled her eyes.
She stares at it for a long moment and then pushes Harry into the frame. She has him lean slightly against one of the conjured tree trunks and then puts Draco behind him.
“I do not look like that,” Draco protests. He wriggles uncomfortably, wedged in between the two of them.
“Don’t give me that bullshit, Draco. I know I haven’t seen you in a while, but if you’ll recall, there was a time when I was the one person who knew you better than either Greg or Vince.” She can tell by the way his scowl intensifies that she is right.
“Fine,” he said. “I had a question.” He had drawn level with Seamus now, off on the side of the Entrance Hall.
“Why the fuck did McLaggen tell me he arrested you last night?” Pansy hisses in Draco’s ear the next following day at work.
“That’s not at all distracting,” he said. She smiled into his back and hugged him closer. With a sigh, he put down his knife and then turned in her arms to face her. “I thought you were very serious about school work.”
When he returned, he distributed the fangs between the four of them. Harry moved to take one, but they waved him away.
“…great news,” said a voice, drifting in from the Entrance Hall. They both turned to look and were greeted by the sight of Harry and Draco having a rather animated and, Hermione thought, friendly conversation. If she had not known already that they were friends, she would have begun to guess it now. She glanced at Blaise, unsure if she knew about the pair of them or not. From the small furrow in his brow, she guessed that he did not.
“Party house?” Seamus suggested, coming out of nowhere to ambush the conversation. Harry looked questioningly at Draco and the corner of Draco’s mouth lifted in a smirk.
But then, the nature of Harry’s position is different to those of a normal Unspeakable. His cover involves hiding in plain sight, being the Boy-Who-Lived, celebrity eternal. He is invited to any event that he wants to go to, and no one expects him to do anything untoward, so he is never suspected.
“Ah,” came a voice from behind them. “Finnegan. Potter.” Harry sighed, recognizing Cormac’s tone. He fixed a smile to his face and turned around.
“Holy shit. I can’t believe you just said that.” Harry put his hands on his head and began walking in an agitated circle. “I can’t believe we’re having this conversation.”
Once the dishes are done, and drip drying in the dish rack, Draco follows Potter upstairs. He doesn’t see Potter at all on the walk back to his room and from the closed door at the end of the corridor on the second floor, Draco assumes he’s gone to bed. Or, at least, has locked himself in his room for the night.
Neville was the first to stir, groaning at the ache in his head. After swearing to never drink again - a promise he knew he would not keep even as he made it - he stumbled into the washroom. He emerged ten minutes later feeling slightly better, but still worse for wear and so decided to make a trip to the kitchen to see if the house elves had any coffee. He pulled on a pair of tracksuit bottoms and the first shirt to hand and traipsed down the tower stairs.
“Yes,” Harry said. “It was miserable, though I am getting better at it. What did you do?” At this, Ron blushed scarlet, his face clashing nicely with his hair.
“I wouldn’t say that our idea of flying your dad’s car to school was necessarily the smartest,” Harry pointed out.
True to his word, McLaggen is waiting for Pansy at the Leaky Cauldron at five thirty. Pansy scowls slightly when she sees him. She was halfway hoping he would give up on whatever it is he wants to tell her. She jerks her head in the direction of the bar and he meets here there. She studiously ignores him while she orders a whisky and soda water, but she waits while Hannah pours his gin and tonic.
His heart was hammering in his chest, and despite her invitational smirk, he couldn’t bring himself to kiss her. Instead, he leaned even closer in, pressing their foreheads together. Now he could feel her breath on his lips. It was almost better than kissing. This almost, will they, won’t they moment. He closed his eyes. Their noses were pressed together now. All he had to do was tip his head slightly to the side. But he still couldn’t do it.
“Before you start on this nonsense about defeating the Dark Lord,” Snape said the moment that Harry and Draco entered his office. “You have a lot to learn.”
Not for the first time that night, Harry admired the layout of the Room of Requirement. It felt both open, but also intimate. He and Draco were sitting in one of the booths at the side of the room. No one paid them any attention in their dark corner, a fact for which Harry was grateful. Most of them were dancing now, wrapped up in the music and each other. He leaned across the table towards Draco.
“Potter’s head is big enough without Horace flattering him all the time,” Snape sneered. Harry scowled, but he was not going to start anything with the professor in front of Dumbledore, so he let it slide.
“Nothing.” Potter turns back to his food. He’s all but finished now, twisting the last few strands of spaghetti around his fork. When he’s done, he pulls his napkin out from the neck of his shirt, balls it up and puts it on his plate. Without saying anything, Draco walks over and gathers up his things. Potter jumps as Draco reaches from behind him, but doesn’t say anything as Draco starts to run the plates under the water.
Harry didn't miss the fact that every once in a while Mafoys eyes would be fixed on his lips or how he didn't move his leg away from where it was pressed against Harrys from Knee to ankle under the table. The more Malfoy drank the looser his posture was. He leaned forward when he spoke and Harry found himself doing the same, drawn forward like a magnet. Drunk Malfoy had a lazy smile and a permanent blush and Harry wanted to see how far down it went.
Harry wanted to sink into the floor because he knew that Draco had done something thoughtful for them and he wasn't sure he wanted to know what it was. But his curiosity got the better of him and he got up to join the rest of the family. They all had mixed expressions of joy and sadness. Rounding the small loveseat he came face to face with the portrait. Or rather the many small portraits that made up the whole. They cycled endlessly one after that other. Pictures of a life that was never going to be lived.
“I know but I’m still sorry. And so are Harry and Ron.” she said earnestly, shooting a glare at the boys behind her.
Groggily, Draco hauled himself from his bed dragging his bear and lovey with him. His bear, complete with Slytherin robes and scarf, had been a gift from his Uncle Sev and Draco may have grown out of it years ago and the peaceful sleep charms far outdated, but he found he had not been able to sleep through the night without it since he learned of his beloved godfather's death. His lovey was nothing more than a scrap of satin at this point but had been the blanket his mother had presented him to his father in after his birth.
“Hmm? Oh yes,he comes for tea every other Wednesday with me. Has been for at least 3 months now. Did you not know that Harry dear? He said he had told you.” she looked at him questioningly.
Draco didn't particularly care. He was over playing a sport he barely liked just to fail at one upping Potter, and it was the greatest amount of precious alone time he had ever gotten in the dorms.
“From the scream of a soul. One in unimaginable grief, or pain. It’s said the first dementors were born of the squib bastard of the family Azkaban, who was tortured in their private mansion where the prison now sits. Their torture reached his soul and unleashed the dementor on them and drove them madder than they already were. The boy was an obscurial, used every piece of magic he didn't know he had in him to separate his pain from his soul.”
“Mate you’ve been with him for months now and you really didn't know any of that? Even I knew that and I barely talked to the git. But with Rosie starting school I wanted to know more about it. Mum’s not young enough to have so many kids running around anymore. No offense Mum.” Ron said, shooting his mother a wink.
“Ah must have slipped my mind” he mumbled. Malfoy probably had told him actually. He vaguely remembered him saying something about enjoying the afternoon tea one day. Harry had thought it just like the spoiled rich boy to stop working midday for a cuppa.
“Er, I uh, I mean, I'll try” Harry told her uncertainty. He could feel his face begin to heat up and rubbed at his neck with his extra hand. Mrs. Malfoy was still looking at him with Draco’s gray blue eyes. Harry wondered how he ever thought Draco looked like his father when all they had in common was their hair. Everything else was from his mother.
It had been a relief for a split instant before he heard that Harry had no idea how the blonde actually was. Neville had been a nervous wreck after showing up for his rendezvous with Draco only to find their spot in ruins. There had been porcelain and glass all over and the floor had been covered in pink blood. Neville had been frantic calling out for Draco but he was nowhere to be found and even poor Myrtle had been too distraught to tell him anything.
“What! Do. You. Want. Boy?” Snape snapped out, making Neville flinch and shake even more than he already was. He had run straight to the infirmary when he heard Harry telling Ron what had happened in Myrtle's bathroom inly to find the boy not there.
The cry was loud, and high pitched, and full of so much anguish. Harry felt the grief and hopelessness of it as if it was own. He felt his chest crack open right between his ribs, the pain so real he reached up with hand to rub at the spot.
Harry answered without thinking.  “Snape’s body” he said absently, still staring at what was looking more and more like a-
Snape raised one eyebrow at him in a way that made him nervous but he was more anxious to get to Draco.
“Uncle please stop tormenting the poor man and let him in, I'd actually like to see my boyfriend and assure the bloody Gryffindork Potty did not manage to shuffle me off this mortal coil, no matter how much he tried.”
Ron knew everyone was looking at them up ahead but he ignored them in favor of watching his son sleep peacefully. He hoped they would be ok after this. Death had not touched them and as much as he wanted to shield them, they deserved at least a memory or two of a grandmother.
"You leave Ronald out of this. At least he can hold his liquor. Must be better genes in us purebloods" he said snootily.
“You asked if  i wanted to take you to visit  that bar I mentioned once!” Malfoy exploded “and excuse me if i don't see an invitation out for a pint from a married man as a date request!”
Before he could run through the double doors leading into the ward though, one of the medi-wix managed to grab a hold of him and thankfully cast a healer grade disinfecting charm at him. It settled over him with the astringent scent of too clean that always hung around a hospital. Ron scrunched his nose at it and imagined he could hear the squeaky clean.
“Draco! Draco, baby shhh its ok I know, I know. If I could take you away from all of this i would. You know I would. But you wont leave your family anymore than i will. It's why I love you.” Neville told him  while running his hands through white blonde hair.
He saw a shadow move in the corner of his eye and turned to see the dementor move away from them, now fully formed if a bit small. Behind him he heard the rushing sound of a portkey activating, sending Mr. Malfoy with Snape’s body directly to the ministry. The remaining auror finally moved into the boat house now that the path was clear. He came back seconds later with Draco in his arms, much like Mr. Malfoy held Snape.
After that even Ron, who had been the most wary, had come around and accepted any and all cuddling and name calling as normal behavior.
