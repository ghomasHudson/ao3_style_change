Harry nodded, watching as Draco headed back down the aisle before turning his attention to his surroundings once more. For all the wooden shelves were dark wood, the aisle itself wasn’t dark thanks to the multiple lamps that lined it and he was sure it wouldn’t be hard to read a book at all.
“Where’s your tree?” Harry asked, walking through to the lounge and looking around. “I thought you were getting one?”
He sighed happily as he sank lower in the tub, until only his head was above the water. Closing his eyes, he rested his head against the bathtub and tried to clear his mind of all thoughts for a few moments – something he still didn’t find particularly easy, even after Auror training. He concentrated on breathing for the few moments that he had his eyes closed, feeling himself relax. Slowly he began to get washed, lathering shampoo into his hair even though he knew it wouldn’t make it any more manageable. It was the one thing he still hadn’t managed to overcome in all these years. Still, he thought, it wasn’t as if he really needed that ability now.
“That chocolate cake looks divine, don’t you think?” Draco replied, pointing at the large gooey chocolate cake that sat in the refrigerated glass cabinet.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Just because
“Fair enough,” Harry replied, picking up his napkin and tucking it into the collar of his shirt as Draco did the same. Then, grinning, he began to eat. “Mm, this is good!”
“Revenge is sweet, my dear Harry,” Draco replied, his eyes sparkling. “It wouldn’t have been so fun if there was no charm on them at all.”
we could maybe do something a bit active,” Harry continued. “Like we could walk down to Barnard Park and have a stroll and lunch at the pub there.”
Draco snorted again. “Well, actually, you’re in luck. I did make one. I’d had enough of Christmas pudding at the Manor.”
He had kicked himself more than once for not breaking the news to Draco in a gentler way, but it had seemed the right thing to do at the time. He wasn’t sure how he’d expected Draco to react, but perhaps it shouldn’t have been a surprise when he’d ended their evening early. It had taken him long enough to trust Harry as it was, and now he found himself worrying that his confession would have put them right back at square one.
“Well,” Harry said as Draco unclipped the padlock. “I’ll see you on Monday. Enjoy your lunch tomorrow.”
“So, who won your game, Harry?” Hermione asked from across the table.
He wasted no time and Apparated, but not to his flat. Narcissa greeted him as he walked into the kitchen at Malfoy Manor.
Draco smirked to himself as he took out a duster and gave the till a wipe. The cleanliness of the shop was one of the things they prided themselves on, and they were constantly on the lookout for dropped leaves or soil. They had won business awards in the past, afterall. Once he’d finished with the till, Draco moved onto polishing the plaques that adorned the wall behind the counter.
Harry snorted. “Still, no point in dwelling over that day is there?”
Harry gave a small groan but nodded. “Yeah, let’s get it over with.”
“Hey,” Ron said, plonking Hugo onto Harry’s lap. “I’m glad you’re here. I’ve been outnumbered because George isn’t here yet.”
Harry shook his head. “Merlin knows why. An ironing board is an ironing board, whether it’s magical or not.”
Once they’d finished, they set up a table in front of one of the bare walls of the shop, setting their vases next to each other on top.
?” Lucius asked with a sigh. “Is your lasagne not to your liking?”
Hermione laughed again. “Alright, I won’t mention it next time I see him. Did business pick up any?”
“I thought you knew me well enough by now, Harry,” Draco replied, giving him a look. “I don’t
Harry nodded. “I do. He’ll keep quiet until we’re ready to tell everyone. Which, to be fair, I thought we were almost ready to do?”
“Flowers? You shouldn’t have!” George said loudly, holding out his hands towards Harry.
“Lead the way,” Draco said, stepping away from Harry slightly and taking his hand.
“Oh, yeah… I didn’t think of that. Alright, not David then. Maybe… Adam?” Harry said, wrinkling his nose slightly.
They both put their wands down and positioned the bouquets carefully inside the vases, turning them to see the display from all angles. Then they looked at each, each wearing a satisfied grin.
“Do you fancy going for a coffee?” Harry asked as they turned the sign in the window and locked the door at the end of the day. “I’m sure we could both do with something stronger, but I don’t feel like facing the crowds.”
“Oh, well that’s a step in the right direction then,” Harry said, shrugging his cloak off. “Have you adapted a potion or come up with something completely new?”
“Oh, really?” Harry asked as he was twirled past the band.
“I know we are, but nothing can happen between us. I don’t want to ruin all of the good work we’ve done,” Draco said with a sigh.
“He looks happy,” Harry said, glancing at Charlie again. “So it can’t be a bad thing.”
“Probably not long after I started working with you,” Harry replied thoughtfully. “But we haven’t for years.”
“I didn’t even think to ask them if they would warm it up,” Draco admitted. “Was it alright cold?”
“He hasn’t changed much, then,” Draco said with a snort. “How he manages to eat so much and stay looking like he does, I’ll never know.”
just because you are in a bad mood,” Draco muttered, not looking at Harry. “This has been arranged for weeks.”
“N-nothing,” Harry stuttered. The foot that had been very firmly planted against his inner thigh had been removed. “I just saw they’ve taken the chicken pie off the menu,” he finished lamely. He could have sworn that he saw a smirk on Draco’s face.
Draco smiled. “Me too. You look nice, by the way. Even your hair doesn’t seem as messy, did you do something with it?”
“Ah. Maybe,” Harry said, nodding thoughtfully. “I suppose that way you can be prepared to deal with it properly.”
“Pansy!” Draco exclaimed, his eyes widening again. “I did
“Well, he’d still have done it wouldn’t he? Just on a smaller scale,” Ron said.
“You don’t hide yourself away,” Harry frowned, looking at him. “You’re always up and down Diagon Alley on your lunch break.”
Harry laughed again. “Well, I wish I’d seen it. Where have you put the orchid?”
Draco snorted. “We ended up in the library. We were being led to the dungeons at first until one of the prefects questioned it and made the decision to go away from them instead. I don’t think it even occurred to Dumbledore that our common room was in the dungeons, and Snape disappeared.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”
Harry picked up the box labelled ‘dress robes’ and passed it across to Draco. “Righto, you go through that and pick which ones you want to keep, then.”
Draco smiled and headed out of the kitchen and up to his old room. He’d sent his clothes over that morning with a note saying to expect him after work. Although Narcissa often popped into Paperwhite’s to check on how things are going, and to take the day’s takings to Gringotts, they never really got the chance to have a chat.
“Alright. Well, that’s five minutes occupied,” Draco sighed, sitting back again. “What now? There’s only so much cleaning we can do.”
“Thank you,” Harry said. “I agree, this has been fun and I will be forever grateful to you for doing it.”
?” Draco hissed into Pansy’s ear as he spotted his dance partner making his way over to their corner.
Twenty minutes later, Harry walked into the pub inside King’s Cross. Hermione had decided that it was easiest to meet there as it was well known. Looking around, he caught sight of Ron and Hermione and made his way towards them. As he got closer, he could see that they weren’t alone and instantly he felt himself tense up a little bit. He wondered why he agreed to this when it made him feel like his stomach was trying to crawl it’s way up to his throat. Before he could turn and walk away, Ron spotted him and waved.
“This won’t take long,” George said, placing both hands on the counter in front of Harry. “What are you doing on Saturday?”
“Ah, it worked,” Draco said, appearing behind Harry again with a box in his hands. “It didn’t stay standing like that for that long before.”
“Indeed they do,” Draco said softly, smiling at Harry before pausing. “What were we talking about, again?”
“Good. Now, come on, let’s get caught up on these orders,” Draco said, nudging Harry’s arm. “If we both work on them, we’ll get them done in plenty of time.”
“Yeah? You’re happy?” Ron asked, a slight frown creasing his brow.
“Oh, yeah, it was good,” Harry said, pausing in the jiggling of Hugo. “We just went for coffee again.”
Draco shook his cup. “Already finished. So drink up.”
Stretching his arms above his head, Harry gave a wide yawn. He hadn’t opened his eyes yet, but he could tell it was already light outside. He stretched his legs out too, feeling every muscle protesting as they responded. The bed dipped and he felt the weight of someone leaning over him. He smiled as he inhaled, breathing in the familiar scent of apples and caramel that always accompanied his boyfriend. “Morning,” he murmured. His smile grew wider as he felt Draco’s soft lips press against his forehead.
Draco nodded and walked into the shop, bending down to check under the counter. “Plenty here, the branded and the plain, so we should be all set.”
The week passed quickly and before they knew it, it was Saturday night and they were locking up after another busy day.
“Yeah, I’m sure. We haven’t been that busy today so it’s not that messy,” Draco replied with a shrug. “We’d have to mop up in the morning if this rain carries on anyway.”
“I feel the same,” Draco said. “Even just those few weeks where we weren’t speaking properly made me feel like something was missing.”
Draco smiled. “You’ll find out later. Right, let’s move on,” he said, gesturing for Harry to follow him again as he turned to leave the room.
“No concern for Verity’s wellbeing, of course,” she said pointedly.
Charlie laughed softly. “None of my family, I’m sure. But I’m certain you can get this back on track. Just be honest with him from now on.”
As he walked, Harry realised that their situation was probably a bit different to most people as he was sure that other people wouldn’t be spending so much time at their partner’s house after only two months together. But he and Draco had known each other for so long now that it felt natural. He smiled to himself as he reached The Leaky Cauldron. They’d never done anything the ‘traditional’ way.
Draco grinned in reply. “Deal. Go and get the books then.”
Harry took the book from him and looked at the cover for a second before turning it over to read the blurb. “Oh… yeah, I see what you mean about the blurb. I think you’re right.”
Now, they were walking through the door of their house in silence. Harry had refused to speak to Draco once they left the restaurant, and he was thankful that Draco took the decision to Apparate them home, even though he still hated travelling that way.
“Really?” Harry asked, pushing himself into a sitting position.
“Ah yes, I forgot about your dodgy bits,” Draco said with a laugh. “Assuming that you mean the bad dates, of course?”
After he’d paid, he made his way to their usual table. However, it wasn’t empty as it usually was. Instead, as he approached, he recognised the back of Hermione’s head. Her hair was less bushy these days, but it was still instantly recognisable to Harry. “Hermione?”
Harry laughed. “See you then.”
Draco chuckled. “Alright, so a lie-in is on the cards. Then what?”
“Good to know,” Draco said in a quiet voice.
“I still don’t really know that myself,” Ginny admitted with a laugh. “He was doing posed individual shots after practice one day and wanted to get some from the game the day after. He stayed in the same hotel as me and we ended up having a few drinks together. Not that I was drinking alcohol before a game, of course.”
“Yeah… are you free on Saturday night? Hermione told me to ask you…” Ron said quickly.
“Really. I would never have expected to feel this way but I can’t actually remember what my adult life was like without you in it,” Harry continued. “You challenge me in ways no-one else ever has, and I love that. I love that we can talk about anything and everything without worrying that we’ll offend each other now. And, most importantly, I know you’ll always have my back when it matters.”
“Well, no-one, I suppose,” Harry said, taking a bite of sponge. “That doesn’t mean you can’t get it wrong.”
“No, not pansies. Pansy!” Draco said, pointing across the road to where he could see Pansy hurrying along on her way back to her office.
Draco shook his head. “No. It’s one step at a time and this is only the first step. I’m perfectly happy with this situation, so please don’t worry. I was just curious.”
“I don’t know, it's a secret, remember!” Harry said with a laugh. “She wouldn’t tell me even if I asked. But she did say both arrangements are gorgeous.”
Harry and Draco glanced at each other.
“I think they just want to be sure you’re alright,” Ron said, half shrugging. “You’re nearing thirty and most people are settling down by thirty…”
“I don’t know,” Harry replied in a hushed voice. “Maybe it’s trying to tell us something.”
front room! You should ask before calling!”
“I don’t know, but if you ever work it out, let me know,” Draco sighed, pushing himself away from the door. “I suppose we’d better get everything cleared up. I’m not used to working on a Sunday.”
“So do I,” Draco said, frowning as he caught the ribbon. “The last thing we need is to run out of ribbon now.”
“Read, probably. Enjoy a nice mug of hot chocolate or a glass of wine and a good book,” Draco replied. “Have an early night so that I’m prepared when Pansy comes to regale me with tales of
“Heathen,” Draco said, taking another sip from his mug. “Anyway, what do you think of the book so far? I know you’re enjoying it, but what specifically?”
“Your spaghetti
They lapsed into silence as the show began in earnest, happy to be in each other’s company as they listened to the host’s chatter.
“I… I see,” Molly said slowly. “So… you’re happy?”
“Oh, Merlin… I’m sorry.”
Harry grinned, but before he could say anything more, a shout of “Present time for the grown ups!” rang out across the room and he and Ginny joined the rest of the group around the tree as George took charge and began handing out presents.
“Might be an idea, yes,” Draco said, nodding. “Just don’t say anything that will tie you in knots or get you into trouble.”
“There’s no such thing as
“That sounds perfect,” Harry replied, returning the grin. “We can eat, exchange presents and then we can snuggle under a blanket and listen to the wireless?”
Draco smiled. “No, you and me both. But I see where you’re coming from. This will always remind me of you. Not to mention anything else I might forget.”
Draco shrugged. “Times change, I suppose. And after everything
“Honestly Mum, I don’t think you should interfere too much,” Charlie continued. “He’s twenty-nine. He knows his own mind.”
Harry nodded. “I am.
“Ah. Alright, well that’s fine, I’ll just tell Hermione that,” Ron said, shrugging. “It was just a thought she had, I think.”
“He’s running late. Something to do with his mother,” Ginny replied. “He’ll be here soon. So, Malfoy, how did you manage to capture Harry’s heart in the end?”
Harry nodded. “So, are you ready to sleep now?”
“Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine. Are you going to go for your lunch now?” Draco said, leaning against the wall.
“No, how could we? We just got here,” Charlie replied, shaking his head. “Like I said, Mum filled us in. She also said lunch is nearly ready, so if Zabini isn’t here soon, he’ll be going hungry.”
place he would be chained is the kitchen,” Pansy sniffed. “Why do you think we have a wrought iron bed frame?”
“Which one did she vote for?”
Draco smiled back somewhat shyly.
Harry laughed. “Alright then, that will be four Galleons for the bouquet and three Galleons for the jasmine, so seven Galleons all together, please,” he said as he carefully placed the potted jasmine into a strong paper bag.
“Malfoy,” Ron replied warily.
“I’m a horrible person,” Harry moaned, digging both hands into his hair and tugging lightly.
think of that.”
“Five shouldn’t take us too long then,” Draco said. “I’ll do this next one for Mrs… Thomas?”
“If only more of them thought like you,” Harry sighed. “I want this night to go well, not with us having to watch our backs in case someone attempts to ambush us.”
“I’m sure,” Charlie laughed. “Although a couple of biscuits wouldn’t go amiss? I can’t have a cup of tea without having a nice biscuit to dunk.”
Draco shook his head. “Not really. I wasn’t told about the members of my mother’s family who’d been disowned for similar reasons either. It’s only been over the last ten years that I found all of this out.”
He abandoned the bathroom and ran back along the landing and down the stairs to the kitchen. He grabbed the tin of Floo powder from the mantelpiece and threw a pinch into the flames, calling out “Ron Weasley!”
Ten minutes later, he stood on the doorstep of Pansy’s neat little house, lifting the knocker and rapping three times on the door.
, so we played ‘I Spy’. The rain ruined our afternoon. We’re normally a lot busier than that on a Monday.”
“I can’t lie,” Harry shrugged. “I consider you a friend now. I wouldn’t if you hadn’t changed.”
“It sounds it,” Charlie said, looking impressed. “Well, good for her. Glad she’s managed to turn her reputation around.”
They worked through each box quickly, making note of any imperfections. Then they moved onto the hanging display. Harry went out into the shop, using magic to unhook the hanging display unit and levitate it down to where they could work on it comfortably.
“It does,” Harry agreed, his eyes studying Draco’s face for a moment. Then, impulsively, he leaned forward and pressed their lips together. It wasn’t anything special, barely more than a peck, but the jolt he felt in his stomach told him that maybe, just maybe this was worth pursuing. “So… coffee?”
Draco nodded. “Several of my father’s friends seemed rather indifferent to their wives and I always thought it odd, when compared to my parents.”
Harry headed off down the aisle to where he knew the books were. When he got there, he was surprised to only find one copy of the book. Frowning, he picked it up and headed back to Draco. “There’s only one there.”
“Yeah, I know. I had plenty of arguments with Draco when I first started working at Paperwhite’s. He really didn’t want me there,” Harry said, a sympathetic smile on his face. “But we’ve worked through it. We’re really good friends now, and sometimes I find it hard to believe we were ever enemies.”
“Yes, we can snuggle,” Draco laughed, pulling Harry close and pressing a kiss to his temple.
“No, but we do have a vote,” Harry said, shaking his head slightly. “Ginny called in. She voted.”
Harry laughed, taking his seat. He smiled as Draco sat down beside him.
“Don’t worry. Most people do,” Tim replied with a smile. “It’s a common misconception that alcohol is necessary for a good night out.”
“What? No,” Draco replied, coughing slightly. “No-one would dare arrange a blind date for me. I’m far too fussy.”
Ginny laughed. “You’ll be fine, don’t worry.”
“Okay. Make sure you tell her it’s urgent,” Draco said. “I have no idea how long he’s been like this.”
“Alright,” Harry said, stepping over another box and stopping by the one Draco was pointing to. “I’ll ask you about anything I’m not sure of.”
Harry smiled. “I’d like that too.”
“We suggest not closer than two feet away,” the Healer by Draco’s bedside replied. “We have not yet managed to stabilise the curse.”
“Alright, don’t rub it in!” Harry exclaimed, looking at him in disbelief. “I thought it would be easier keeping the appearance the same in case I slipped up or something. I’m hardly an expert in it!”
“I can’t believe that last woman bought ten bouquets just because she could,” Harry said, shaking his head as they began walking. “Is that the biggest individual purchase we’ve seen?”
“For Molly, Hermione and Ginny, you mean?” Harry asked, frowning slightly.
“To take your mind off the conversation we were just having,” Draco exclaimed. “Merlin, Potter, you can be so dense sometimes!”
Draco looked impressed. “Nice. Very convincing. Age?”
“Yes. Well, I was. I don’t know anymore,” Draco replied.
“I don’t mind. The sandwiches were lovely, so I’m happy to just eat there if you are,” Draco replied, shrugging.
“Now you mention it, it does ring a bell,” Draco replied. “Forget I said anything. Someone came in to order a wreath just before you got back. I was going to do it, but I think you need it more than me. Here. I wrote it down.”
, but I’m hoping we’ll do
? I like a tonic water, but I couldn’t drink it all night.”
“Do you think I’m going to get it all over myself?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow.
“How much longer until dinner is ready?” Draco asked, ignoring her. “I’m getting hungry.”
Draco looked up and felt his cheeks grow hot as he realised what Harry was holding. “Er…”
Harry smiled. “Well, we’re together now. Hopefully we’ll get many more times like this.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “And what if you overreact to a simple question?”
“No. Of course not,” Harry said, shaking his head and shifting away from Draco. “I completely understand. I’m sorry. Again. I’ll, um, I’ll go and pay for our food and drinks. It’s the least I can do.”
Draco nodded. “Unfortunately, yes. Don’t get me wrong, I did get toys and things as gifts, but we did not play games. Sometimes Mother and I would, but Father didn’t often join in. I’m sure that comes as a surprise to you.”
“Lovely,” Harry replied with a smile as he leaned forward to take one of the mugs. He lifted it to his mouth and took a sip. “Oh, that’s nice coffee.”
“Of course you are, dear,” Molly said, smiling at him kindly. “But wouldn’t it be a help if Hermione could introduce you to new people?”
“Because you didn’t tell her you were going out with me?” Draco asked lightly.
“Ah, hear that, Ron? Harry got you flowers!” George exclaimed, turning to Ron with a grin.
Harry returned the kiss, still smiling against Draco’s lips.
Draco snorted. “I absolutely don’t mind people knowing. But I do understand why you don’t want them finding out so suddenly. Perhaps we should keep this between us for now? Maybe until after Christmas?”
“Nothing yet,” Hermione said, glancing around. “We were waiting for you to get here. Should we get a bottle of wine?”
Harry nodded, taking another bite of his spaghetti. He chewed and swallowed before answering. “Yeah. It was used as the headquarters of the Order during the war. We had to abandon it for a while, though.”
“Just some water, please,” Harry nodded, as he rubbed his stomach absentmindedly. “I don’t think I can move.”
“Alright, alright,” Molly said, standing up and pulling out her wand to clear the table. “It’s Eve’s pudding and custard, I hope that’s alright with everyone?”
“No, exactly. But we work well together. Oh, speaking of, you need to vote in our competition,” Harry said, suddenly remembering. “Which arrangement do you think is best? Put it on one of the cards with your name and if you win, you can have a bouquet of your choice. For free.”
Harry laughed. “Come off it, you know you’re an attractive bloke. You don’t need me to tell you that.”
“She wasn’t there when I started,” Harry said with a laugh. “Do you give up yet?”
“That good?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “Should I go and get coffee?”
“The only way this could be better is if you made it yourself,” Harry continued, savouring another bite. “Because then I could ask you to make it for me all the time.”
“No, I can imagine,” Draco said quietly. “It was a horrific time.”
“Harry, do you know what day it is?”
“You’ll see in a few minutes,” Draco smiled. “Can I assume you like custard?”
Harry snorted. “Always the dramatic one,” he murmured before leaning over to press a kiss to Draco’s cheek. “Come on. Let’s get it over with before the food is served.”
“Hi, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry replied, quirking his lips in a quick smile before nodding at Lucius. “Mr Malfoy.”
Harry chuckled. “Well, this all looks amazing. Plates?”
“Draco, if you don’t get up those stairs right now, you’ll never know,” Harry growled, teeth nipping at Draco’s skin gently. “I have just sat through most of a meal with a hard-on, it would be nice for it to be worth it.”
“I know,” Ron said with a chuckle. “To be honest, I think she was just worried about not getting grandchildren.”
Harry laughed. “His name is what you have a problem with?”
“No I don’t suppose you do,” Harry said softly. “You know I’m not sorry he got punished, but I am sorry you don’t have the same relationship anymore.”
“Why wouldn’t it? You were good,” Harry replied, frowning slightly.
Draco shook his head. “No, I only got here a few minutes ago. I would have been here sooner, but there were people following me,” he replied with a slight frown.
Draco shrugged as he plonked the bucket in the sink and squirted some disinfectant into it before turning the tap on. “There’s no-one on the scene at the minute. I’m okay with it. After being in here all day, I never want to see another Valentine’s bouquet for at least–”
Normally if Harry was late, it wouldn’t bother him too much but he had never known Harry to be over an hour late. The letter that had been returned to him unanswered had been concerning too. His owl had never once failed to deliver a letter to Harry in the past.
Pansy snorted but before she could reply, the bell rang to signal that dinner was ready. She narrowed her eyes at Draco. “Saved by the bell, Malfoy.”
“Draco, seriously, you don’t know what these people will do,” Harry sighed, lying down again, his back pressed against Draco’s chest. “They could literally bankrupt you.”
“Oh, good choice,” Draco nodded. “I haven’t thought about it, to be honest, so let’s see…” He paused and looked at the menu board that was behind the counter. “I think I might just have the chicken salad again. I don’t really fancy ham today and everything else is a bit messy to eat while reading.”
What happened next was something of a surprise to both Harry and Draco. There was no cry of outrage or surprise and no-one leapt to their feet. All that happened was Ginny held out her hand to George, who handed over five Galleons grudgingly and Hermione turned back to Rose, who had a book open on her lap.
Harry concentrated on his food for a few moments until he heard his own name mentioned somewhere along the table. He looked up and saw Mrs Weasley talking with Hermione, Charlie and Arlo.
“You could change that though,” Harry said, looking back at Draco. “You could have a queue around the block, if you really wanted.”
had a bad night. Alright, I’ll put them into a bucket and we can sell them as a clearance item. Someone might get a few days' use out of them.”
“I…” Draco trailed off. Pansy’s words echoed in his mind. “He’s…”
When he got back to Paperwhite’s a few minutes later, he found Draco in the middle of the shop with the sweeping brush in his hands. “Oh. I didn’t think things were that bad. We cleaned last night.”
Harry rolled his eyes with a grin of his own. “I knew there’d be a catch.”
“You have no idea,” Harry replied with a grin. “The hardest bit is negotiating Draco’s sarcasm.”
“Plus, we’d lose out on those badly organised people who come in at the last minute,” Draco said wisely. “That’s the real reason we’re here today.”
“So, for the next three nights, you two will be working together – along with Mr Filch – to ensure that all of the fireplaces in the school are cleaned and free of soot. Is that clear?” Professor McGonagall asked, looking at each of them in turn.
For the next few minutes, neither of them spoke as the air grew warm around them and was filled with gasps and groans as they lost themselves to each other.
“She’s changed since school, just like we have,” Draco shrugged. “She’s been very supportive, I’ll have you know.”
“Now we’d better get the rest of the day’s stock out into the buckets,” Draco said, heading into the back room again. “It’s nearly half past seven.”
“Yeah, they only had bacon ready and I didn’t want to be late,” Harry replied, his voice muffled by the cupboard door. He emerged again with his apron in his hands. “Is that okay?”
Harry settled himself back onto the sofa with a soft groan. “You certainly know how to spoil a man.”
“Ah, you’re right,” Harry sighed, standing up too. “Those chairs are just so comfortable!”
Harry shrugged too. “I’ll take the blame. I’m glad it took off as well as it did.”
“I didn’t get an E in my Charms NEWT by being incompetent, you know,” Draco said, shaking his head. “And just because I didn’t take them at the same time as everyone else – apart from you – it doesn’t mean it’s any less valuable.”
Harry looked down at his feet once more.
“No, I know. And you’re right,” Draco nodded. “We had a lot of work to do.”
“Sshh. Read,” Harry said, shaking his head at Draco’s quip with a grin on his face. “You’re not tempting me into an argument now.”
“I know,” Narcissa said softly. “I’m sorry. I just… I worry about you sometimes, that’s all.”
Draco laughed. “Remember when I ‘bought’ you treacle tart at the bookshop?”
He stood up again and lit the lamps that lined Harry’s wall before casting another glance down at the floor. His eyes landed upon a small glass vial and he stooped to pick it up. Turning it in his hand, he was glad to see a readable label. “Draught of… Living Death. Merlin’s pants, Potter!”
“No,” Harry sighed. “That’s true. But honestly, besides Quidditch and knowing Angelina, we had nothing in common. Conversation just didn’t happen and I ended up talking to George more than Jordan. So we know younger men are a no.”
“I agree,” Harry said. “Hopefully we won’t get to a really interesting point before we have to stop.”
Harry began piling food onto his fork with relish. He turned to Ron. “It’s a shame Ginny couldn’t be here, isn’t it? She’d love having Charlie’s boyfriend here.”
“What’s that?” Harry asked as he turned the grill on.
“Then let’s go back to our quarters,” Draco said, wiggling his eyebrows. “I’ll take your mind off the fact that we’re thirty years old and facing a three-night detention.”
“I know,” Draco called back. “You owe me big time.”
“I know, but I’m supposed to be going out with Draco this weekend,” Harry sighed. “I want to be able to stay awake to actually
made a treacle tart, of course.”
“Ah. I’m going to Adam’s this afternoon, too,” Harry said quietly, remembering to use the alias for Draco.
Harry laughed. “Alright, go on then.”
Harry narrowed his eyes at Draco slightly. “I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not.”
“It’s a good job I’m good with a water-repelling charm,” Draco muttered, taking a drink from his own cup.
Within minutes, he was stepping out of the fireplace in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. He took off his cloak and headed into the hall to put it away in the cupboard before coming back into the kitchen to make himself something to eat. He pulled some bacon and sausages out of the fridge, intending on making himself a healthy fry-up. He turned to get some eggs when the Floo chimed, making him jump and drop the box on the floor.
Harry closed his eyes briefly but opened them again when Draco spoke.
“Draco, are we…” Harry began, looking around.
Draco nodded, one of the sandwiches already in his hand. “Absolutely. Now, these display units. I want to move everything that’s in the window over to this side,” he said, pointing to his left. “And everything that’s on that side to the middle. Everything in the middle is to go to the other side.”
“If you say so. I don’t think they’ll question you on age anyway,” Draco replied
“It’s fine by me,” Draco nodded. “What about you? And if one of us reads a bit quicker, that’s okay. We won’t turn the page until we’re both done reading it.”
Draco nodded and, together, they headed along the aisles towards their favoured alcove.
,” Harry exclaimed. “She must have a pretty big house if she’s wanting them in every room.”
“Oh, absolutely,” Harry nodded, moving around the counter and towards Draco to help with the hanging display.
Harry laughed. “I don’t think either of us were trying. It just sort of happened, didn’t it?”
“Yes, it probably is,” Draco replied. “I know mine is, given what went before it.”
“I know. And we’ve never once tried to kill each other,” Harry said with a laugh. “Seriously though, if he makes you happy then I’m glad you found each other.”
“Yeah, I don’t think we’d want to write off the cost of the vase if you miss,” Harry said, sticking his tongue out cheekily.
Hermione turned to face him and the look on her face almost made him drop the tray. Stepping quickly up to the table, he set it down and then sat himself down opposite Hermione. “What’s wrong?”
“They really do. These are going to make us a fortune in the run up to Christmas,” Draco said, his eyes shining as he grinned at Harry. “Maybe Pansy is a genius after all.”
“No, definitely not,” Harry said, shaking his head. “It’s nice not to have to worry about who they’re setting me up with.”
“I know the feeling. I keep getting owls from Mother inviting me to join them for dinner and I just can’t face it,” Draco sighed. “They’ll only ask me questions.”
“Listen, Harry, if you really like him then I think you’d be mad not to go for it. But, having said that, I can understand why you’re hesitant. I don’t really know what you want me to say…” Charlie said softly.
Molly nodded, closing her eyes briefly. “Alright. Well, let’s have no more talk of this tonight. Who’s ready for pudding?”
and she was giving me that look, you know, the one that basically means I don’t have a choice?”
Harry laughed in disbelief. “Thanks, Gin. Where’s Zabini?”
“Stop! Don’t you dare sing another word of that,” Harry laughed, swatting lightly at Draco’s arm. “I’d almost forgotten it.”
Folding the parchment again, he sealed it with a quick charm and stepped up to the counter where he was greeted by a tired-looking witch.
“Well, what are you waiting for?” Pansy asked, frowning at him from her place on the sofa. Her arms were crossed across her chest now, and Draco could tell that she was certainly annoyed at him.
Ron shook his head. “No, definitely not. Imagine if one of the kids got hold of it… Hermione is at work. Let me get hold of her and get back to you. She should be able to get hold of some from there.”
“Me too,” Draco smiled, pressing his lips to the top of Harry’s head.
“Anyway, when do you want to start going through the receipts?” Harry asked. “I’m going to have dinner at The Burrow tonight, but we could make a start if it’s quiet this afternoon?”
Harry laughed and patted Draco’s stomach gently. “Come on then. We’ll take the Floo to your place and then Apparate to The Burrow from there.”
“I knew you’d think so. It’ll be another five minutes or so for the food,” Draco replied. “So if you’ll excuse me.”
“Just checking,” Draco said with a grin as the barista came over to serve them. “Yes, I’d like a chicken salad sandwich on brown please, and a slice of that chocolate cake. Oh and a large latte.”
Harry shook his head. “No. Well sort of, but not really. I… promise you won’t say anything?”
see inside if they were close enough.
“No. Well, yes, but it’s
“Probably. I never went hungry, anyway,” Ron shrugged, picking up his knife and fork. “And I don’t intend to start now.”
Harry nodded, ducking his head slightly. “Yes. As friends, you understand? He wanted to help me out, although I think he did have some selfish reasons too.”
Harry laughed in spite of his mood. “Yeah, I suppose so. Too late now. I’ll be seeing her at lunchtime, so I’ll tell her then that I wasn’t impressed.”
“Sounds good,” Draco nodded, pushing a piece of the foam towards Harry.
A few moments later, Draco joined him at the other end of the counter and they worked quietly for the rest of the afternoon, each concentrating on the bouquets they were making up.
Hermione looked at him over her shoulder. “You do know I’m a Weasley too?”
“Alright, that works for me too,” Draco replied. “I’ll probably just have a sandwich while I’m getting ready too.”
“That’s understandable. How many rooms do you have here, then?”
Charlie’s frown deepened. “But how do you know that? How do you know that he doesn’t feel the same?”
“They’re spread out all over the place,” Draco said. “In places like this, or the Manor, I suppose. Probably in fancier places than this, too. I didn’t want anything too big when I moved out of the Manor. I wanted something that was easily managed without a house-elf.”
“Do you think it could have just appeared by magic?” Harry asked, scrunching his nose up. “I’m sure it wasn’t there when we hung the display. We would have noticed it.”
you end up with soil in your hair anyway?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “I didn’t want to ask earlier.”
“I had to get out of there. I’ve worked with him for years and I thought we had a good friendship,” Draco said, shaking his head. “I thought we could talk to each other.”
Harry shook his head. “Not according to the board. ‘A selection of appropriate flowers and foliage, with decoration in complementary colours’, it says. So I’m guessing they don’t want anything too outlandish.”
“Right, I’ll see you at lunchtime. I should be done with this investigation by then,” Draco said, wrapping his cloak around his shoulders.
“I think we should just have coffee, unless there’s something you want to read?” Harry asked.
“And I won’t?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
“No, one each,” Harry laughed, giving Draco a light shove. “I didn’t think I needed to be that specific.”
“Which is absolutely fine,” Draco said, taking a sip from his glass. “You just need to know that enjoying it shouldn’t mean telling me about it.”
I want you to be sorry?” Draco exclaimed.
“Well, we haven’t been for a while,” Draco replied. “We’ve either been at your place or mine, doing things we definitely wouldn’t be allowed to do here.”
Draco shifted so that Harry’s back was to the wall, pinning him there lightly and kissing him deeply. “You taste of chocolate,” he murmured.
“Yeah, but you had a reason to behave in that way, given how he sometimes spoke to you. What was my excuse?” Draco replied with a half-grin. “Other than being a brat.”
Harry nodded, not daring to say anything.
“It does,” Draco said with a smile. “I was hoping you’d be doing roast beef. At least now I won’t have to hex Harry tomorrow.”
Draco laughed. “Can I get you a drink, then? Your glass is empty.”
Draco nodded. “Did you have something in mind?”
“Yeah, but at least you
“Yes, now that you mention it, I’m feeling a bit tired too,” Draco nodded, a slight frown creasing his brow. “I felt fine before.”
“Oh… agreed mate,” Ron said, catching Harry’s eye again.
“I don’t mind sitting a bit closer,” Harry said, shrugging and making the cups rattle on the tray. “Do you?”
Harry laughed. “Oh, of course. The till?”
“Already on it,” Draco replied, moving past Harry and into the back room where he lifted the bucket into the sink and began to fill it up with hot water.
“Breakfast in bed, obviously,” Harry replied. “Bacon sandwiches, hash browns and coffee.”
Harry looked around again for a few seconds before he lowered himself onto the sofa, gasping softly as he realised Draco was right. This was the most comfortable sofa he’d ever sat on.
“That would be a bit of a contradiction, wouldn’t it?” Draco asked, quirking an eyebrow. “Busy
“It does,” Charlie nodded. “Alright, so have you told him?”
“I would agree with that,” Draco nodded, raising his glass to his lips.
“Harry! You’re here. Have you brought Adam?”
Harry looked at him in surprise. “For a buffet?”
“Oh, quite,” Pansy nodded, grinning. “I mean, he
“Well, we’ll see, I suppose,” Draco said with a little sniff. “Anyway, let’s get this cleaning finished or we’ll never get home.”
“No,” Harry agreed with a chuckle. “A Butterbeer would be great, please.”
Draco laughed as he walked away.
“My ‘date’ on Saturday night?” Harry said with a sigh as he turned back to face Draco. “Turned out that Conor liked the idea of being seen with me more than he liked the idea of actually getting to know me. He spent the whole night talking to other people while I just stood there like a spare part.”
Draco shook his head. “Not right now, no. I’m not even thirty years old yet, Mother. Why would I want to settle down?”
Harry shook his head. “No, six is fine by me. I’ll just grab something quick at home while I’m getting ready.”
“What do you think you’ll be having for dinner tonight, then?” Draco asked as he moved around the shop, wiping the counters.
Harry made his way to Paperwhite’s, checking his watch as he walked. He was right on time to meet Draco. As he reached the section of the street where Paperwhite’s stood, he spotted Draco waiting for him.
“I know, all I ask is that you don’t antagonise him when you come in,” Harry said.
“Are you sure about this?” Harry asked, looking across at Draco.
Ron and George looked at each other before answering in unison: “No!”
“I can’t believe this!” Draco hissed. “You couldn’t just stay quiet!”
“Oh, you shouldn’t have!” Molly exclaimed, taking the bottle from Draco. “But thank you. We’ll open it with lunch. Now, come in, both of you. I take it no-one else knows?”
Draco looked down at the box in his lap with a start. “Oh. Hang on,” he muttered, opening the box to reveal a glass sphere. He lifted it out of the box carefully and looked across at Harry. “A Remembrall?”
“You didn’t,” Draco said. “You took a vial of Draught of Living Death by mistake. I had to get Granger to bring the antidote, because for some unfathomable reason, you didn’t have any of that in the house.”
“Oh don’t say that,” Harry groaned, walking around the counter and into the shop to start collecting the flowers he needed for his bouquet. He picked up one of the wooden trugs they kept beside the counter for this purpose.
“Does it sound strange if I say that I think I’ve fallen in love with you?” Draco asked quietly.
“It was his fault!”
Charlie opened a cupboard and took out two mugs, before pulling the tea chest out and opening it. He picked out a chamomile tea bag for Harry before rifling through the selection and picking out a Yorkshire Tea bag for himself. He deposited the bags into the mugs and waited for the water to boil. “So, you mentioned that you didn’t want me to say anything to the family…”
Harry laughed and shoved lightly at Draco’s shoulder. “You win that round and can have another go, if you want?”
“Ah, good point,” Draco nodded. “Saying he’s our age will at least stop them wondering. Alright, so you met him through work, he’s our age, athletic with blond hair and called Adam. Anything else you think might be relevant?”
“You… are amazing,” Harry said softly, taking Draco’s hand and pulling him close. “I can’t believe you planned all of this for today.”
“Please, Pansy, we’ll be eating soon,” Draco said, wrinkling his nose. “I do not need to be picturing you two kinky bastards while I’m tucking into my food.”
“Draco, really? You would let this go just so you didn’t
“Oh,” Harry said, immediately feeling a blush appear on his face. “Sorry, I… just remembered I… have no milk in at home.”
Draco smiled. “I absolutely will. You know, we’ve always been opposites and apparently that saying is true. Opposites do attract. We know how to bring out the best
“Mum will pretend she doesn’t care for compliments, but she loves them really,” Charlie said with a grin. “We’ve told her many times how good her food is, but it’s always better coming from someone outside of the family.”
Pansy watched him carefully, her gaze calculating. “You’re liking this. I know you too well, you would never do this for me.”
Harry laughed. “Don’t worry, I’m not complaining. Just surprised that this completely random day in June could be so busy.”
Checking his watch, he stood up. “I’d better be going now, too,” he said, stretching. “Thank you for a wonderful lunch, as always, Molly. And thank you all for the lovely presents.”
“Go and sit down then,” Draco replied, nudging him slightly with the tray.
Harry nodded. “I’ll charm it when you’re done.”
“A Muggle game played by children,” Harry said. “It’s very easy. I’ll go first. I’m going to give you a letter of the alphabet and you have to guess what I’m thinking of, okay?”
“Mm, I know,” Draco murmured, his eyes travelling over Harry’s body from his chest, down to the erection that was standing flushed and proud. “I wanted to take your mind off our fight.”
Draco groaned. “I thought we’d left this subject behind. No, I haven’t made it for Harry.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Mother, honestly. We’re twenty-nine years old. We’re past everything from years ago now. We’re not about to fall out over something silly.”
Harry nodded, reaching a hand into the pocket of his cloak which he’d left over the back of the sofa when he arrived.
“Oh, of course, that’s fine,” Hermione said, her voice betraying her surprise. “Sorry, I just assumed.”
“I wanted to do something nice for you,” Draco replied. “And you can count this as an early birthday present too, if you like. I will still have a present for you on your actual birthday, of course.”
“What’s it done to him?” Harry asked, his eyes raking over every inch of Draco’s prone form.
Draco nodded. “Alright, you’ve sold it to me. Let’s get this cleaning done then.”
need you to sell to people,” Draco said, one eyebrow raised. “Not because you are who you are, but because I need the help in the shop and it takes far too long to break in a new colleague.”
“Oh yes. Don’t think I’ve forgotten about that,” Draco said, stretching. “I’ve been looking for something good this whole time. Right. I spy with my little eye something beginning with…”
“If only everyone thought like you,” Harry said with a chuckle. “It would make my life much easier.”
“You’d be surprised at the things I can remember,” Draco said, taking another bite of his cake.
“You are, and I’m very grateful,” Harry said with a grin. “Shall we start?”
“He always was full of it,” Ron snorted.
Draco left the dining room and headed for the kitchen, where he wasted no time in Apparating.
“He lied to me. His friends haven’t been setting him up at all,” Draco said. “They haven’t set him up for months.”
was never in doubt.”
They fell silent as they worked, each of them adding and moving the flowers around until they were happy that their efforts were beginning to look like their designs.
Harry gave Ron a look as the chatter started up again. “Did you know?”
“No,” Draco panted, dragging the sandwich board into the front of the shop. “Here it is. Heavier than I remember.”
Harry groaned and canted his hips upwards slightly to force more contact between them.
Harry unwrapped a small box containing a badge that looked familiar. As he held it up, he realised why and began to laugh. “Is this a ‘Potter Stinks’ badge?”
Draco laughed. “Their family meals sound a lot more eventful than Malfoy ones. They’ve always been quite staid affairs.”
“Yeah, I’m ready to go if you are,” Draco said with a nod. “This has been fun.”
During the silence that followed, Harry took the opportunity to look at Arlo properly. He was a touch taller than Charlie with straight, dark hair that brushed the tops of his shoulders, dark brown eyes and a rather attractive smile.
“There’s wine, but I thought we’d save that for when we’re eating,” Draco replied. “I have some bottled Butterbeer, as well as Gillywater and pumpkin juice. There’s probably tea and coffee in there too, but I assume you won’t want that right before eating?”
“He’s in St. Mungo’s. We’re not sure what happened exactly, it was all so quick. As soon as he picked it up, he collapsed. We weren’t able to bring him ‘round,” Hermione continued, her voice shaking slightly. “The Healers started diagnostics straight away, of course, but they said it might be a good idea to get you in as he might respond to your voice quicker.”
“Good. Tomorrow morning we need to water the succulents, don’t let me forget,” Draco said as he passed their unit. “Some of them are looking a little bit worse for wear.”
“Good point,” Draco said, nodding. “I’ll speak to Blaise first, before I bring Pansy into it. I don’t think he’d appreciate it if I told her something that’s supposed to be a secret. She still can’t help herself when she hears good gossip.”
Draco smiled. “Me too. Okay, let’s go. I said I’d call Mother tonight.”
Harry nodded. “Okay.”
Hermione chuckled. “They’re still lovely.”
Draco nodded. “I won’t be having dinner with Mother before coming back to meet you this time though.”
Draco closed his eyes with a soft chuckle. “Let’s go upstairs… please.”
“You mean you haven’t already?” Draco asked, following him through the doorway. “I would have been straight onto her yesterday morning.”
Charlie nodded, taking a drink from his mug. “Yes, how’s that going?”
Draco turned and headed back along the stacks towards the café, leaving Harry alone to contemplate what his life had become. He picked the book up again, turning it over to read the blurb once more.
“Thanks,” Harry said, smiling as he turned to Draco. “Do you think our alcove will be free?”
“Who have they sent in your place, then?” Draco asked, deciding that it might be better to try and steer conversation away from their school days.
Draco laughed tiredly as he moved to lie beside Harry. “We can still get dinner now, though, can’t we?”
“How come you were doing the deliveries anyway? Where was Verity?” Harry asked.
Harry laughed this time, sliding one arm across Draco’s shoulders. “Alright. We’ll wait a bit.”
“Really? They didn’t want to know anything about who you were seeing or what you did?” Draco asked, surprised.
Harry chuckled. “You’ll be alright. I only mention it because Zabini was a bit hesitant when he had lunch here for the first time.”
Pansy laughed. “He is in the kitchen. I have no idea what he’s doing, but the smells coming out of there are incredible.”
“Oh, you know, just a date with the hottest man I know,” Harry replied casually. “He’s taking me somewhere nice.”
Draco chuckled. “Same here. You know, I think they do sandwiches at Bookworms.”
Hermione smiled but didn’t laugh. “We didn’t want to assume in case we were wrong. We knew you’d tell us when you were ready. Of course, we were prepared to meet ‘Adam’, too.”
“I suppose I probably should,” Harry nodded. “They’re bound to ask that.”
Pansy laughed. “I’ll be honest, I think you’ve repaired a lot of damage that was done while we were at school. Not all by you, either.”
Harry snorted. “No, you can say that again. But I’m not complaining we’ve got it this year.”
“Well, no, I hadn’t pictured it like that either,” Harry admitted. “Maybe we were naïve to think we wouldn’t be noticed at the party, though.”
“Molly will be the same. I’m only going for lunch, I think,” Harry replied. “I know they usually have games on the afternoon, but I wasn’t planning on staying because it would make the teams uneven.”
“Well, yeah, I just mean I don’t want ten customers coming in at the same time,” Harry said, grinning. “In ones or twos will be fine!”
“Oh yeah, how?” Harry asked, still looking up at Draco.
“I didn’t mean to use it this morning,” Harry insisted. “It was where my mug normally is and I was in a rush!”
Harry laughed again. “Alright then. We’ll come back to that. Let’s get this finished so we can go back to the book.”
“Spring pastels,” Harry said. “Easter’s coming up, people will want centrepieces and stuff.”
“Hi Harry,” Hermione said, giving him a slightly wary look.
“Well, thank you, they are gorgeous,” Molly laughed, sniffing the flowers once more. “I’ll go and put them in a vase in a minute. Go on through to the lounge, as you can hear, everyone’s in there.”
Harry blinked as he looked at Molly. The silence that had fallen over the table registered in his mind. He licked his lips slowly, trying to put his thoughts into words before he spoke. “Molly, I appreciate your concern, I really do, but I am perfectly happy with the way my life is going at the minute.”
“Of course,” Draco nodded, taking a seat in an armchair and crossing his legs. “Harry has an extraordinarily good eye for these dried bouquets, so I’m sure he’ll be able to help too.”
Draco shook his head. “No, definitely not. You probably won’t understand, given your home situation while we were at school, but after spending nineteen years there you can’t imagine how much of a relief it was to finally have some proper independence.”
“Yeah, it is, but I like that we did,” Harry said. “I think these presents are more meaningful than anything we could buy from a shop. I mean, I did buy this one from a shop but you know what I mean.”
“That’s not much of an auction,” Harry said with a snort. “We’d be better off doing a bake sale.”
“They’re people like Dad,” Ron said, shrugging. “Fascinated by Muggles and their ways, and they think that bewitching something like an ironing board will make it better.”
Harry laughed.
Hermione looked up and shook her head. “It’s not that we’re not bothered, Harry. More like we’re not surprised. You two have become so close while working together, it’s been quite obvious that you care for each other.”
“It’s stupid. I should have been honest when I first realised,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I didn’t mean to lie to you about it.”
“I can’t believe he’s done this!”
Draco smiled again, smugly this time. “I know you do. And I love you, too. Do you think I’d go to all this effort if I didn’t?”
“I’ll probably just tell them he can’t make it,” Harry said, shrugging. “That is unless you want to come for dinner at The Burrow with me one day?”
“You mean about where we go from here?” Harry asked.
“Oh, shush. I can’t help it,” Harry said, laughing. “It’s a good surprise, anyway.”
“I bet it does,” Harry chuckled. “At least he’s happy.”
“Just shut up and get in,” Draco replied, lifting the duvet slightly.
“Yeah, of course! I apologised straight away. And then again before we left,” Harry replied.
“Good genes, according to him,” Ginny replied with a grin. “Was he like this at school?”
“Sorry, I didn’t want to assume,” Harry said with a grin. “I brought some wine to have with lunch.”
“Yes, it does,” Draco nodded. “I’ve been thinking about it since we closed the shop up.”
“Alright,” Harry said as he finished his croissant, picking up his cup of coffee. “Where to next? I know you won’t have just planned to come here.”
“What? What do you mean? It’s my day off,” Harry protested, turning his head to look at Draco. He frowned and threw one arm out, fumbling on the bedside table for his glasses and shoving them onto his nose when he found them.
“Yes, go through. You can tell me how your date went the other night,” Pansy said, giving him a sly look as she gestured for him to walk.
Ginny turned back to study the arrangements again before marking a cross on the voting card and signing her name. Then she put the quill down and deposited the card into the box. “When are you drawing the winner?”
Harry blew a raspberry at Hugo as he handed him over to Ron and grinned as the little boy giggled in delight.
Harry placed his book on his lap, his hands folded on top of it. “Well, that was enlightening. I had no idea that it was commonplace for gay wizards to marry women but have a male lover on the side.”
Arriving home for the night, Harry deposited the bag from the local Chinese takeaway on the kitchen table. He’d made a spur of the moment decision after leaving Draco that he couldn’t really be bothered to cook that evening, so instead of taking the Floo straight home, he’d walked into London and detoured past the Chinese takeaway to pick up some chicken chow mein.
“Well, good. I’d be more than happy to do this again if you need me to,” Draco said. “If only to get me out of the house for a few hours.”
“Hmm, maybe I will,” Pansy said, picking up her knife. “Now. Let’s eat.”
“You mean you didn’t use an umbrella charm?” Harry asked, turning back to Ron with an incredulous look.
Harry grunted in reply, turning a circle on the spot as he looked for something.
“We came through it, and that’s all I’m going to say about it. I don’t want to bring the mood crashing down,” Harry replied. “I’ve had a lovely time with you tonight.”
Pansy laughed. “Alright, I’m only teasing. I know it’s not for everybody, but Theo and I enjoy it.”
“I do. It’s okay. I accepted it long ago,” Draco said softly.
Draco leaned back and studied the bouquet again before nodding. “Yeah, that’s better. It looks amazing.”
Settling himself on the sofa, he dug his fork into the noodles, twirling it around until he had enough on there to be counted as a mouthful. As he lifted the fork to his mouth, he groped for the remote control that he knew was somewhere nearby. Although he didn’t use it often, he’d managed – with Hermione’s help – to get a TV to work within the magic-infused walls of Grimmauld Place. Sometimes, on nights like this, he could think of nothing better than losing himself in some mindless TV shows. Switching the TV on, he scrolled through the channels until he landed on an episode of a garden remodelling show which was just starting. Smiling to himself, he put the remote down and began to eat in earnest, keeping one eye on the TV.
“Trust me,” Ron said, digging the serving spoon into the dish and cutting himself a sizable portion. “Who knows you better than me?”
“I suppose,” Ron agreed with a nod. “Anyway, let’s eat.”
Finally, they were ready to leave. Harry had grabbed their cloaks from the cupboard and they pulled them on as they made their way to the door. Draco locked the door behind them as they stepped out onto the street and between them they pulled the security gate across to be secured with the padlock.
“Yeah, we only really get to talk during our breaks,” Charlie replied with a shrug as he replaced the kettle. “But that’s okay, it makes our evenings better. We get to talk about our days, and share any horror stories, you know, that kind of thing. Although to be fair, if there are horror stories to share, we probably already know about them.”
“Of course we did,” Draco snorted, straightening some of the plant pots on the display units. “
“So am I,” Harry replied honestly. “And I think Ginny is just as capable of it as I am. She knows what she’s doing.”
“Oh, brilliant, thanks,” Harry said, half standing to take the plate and mug from Draco. “Wow, I didn’t expect the sandwich to be so big.”
“One; Charlie Weasley,” Harry admitted. “I had to talk to someone, but I couldn’t talk to Ron or Hermione. I don’t know why, but I’ve always gone to Charlie with things like this.”
Soon enough, their plates were empty, and their mugs were drained. “I didn’t realise how hungry I was,” Harry admitted, stretching his arms above his head for a moment. “I had a big lunch, too.”
and he was
Harry nodded too. “Mmhmm. Then we might need a shower, or a bath.”
Harry snorted. “You know, I think you’re right. That rings a bell. We probably should have expected it then, shouldn’t we?”
“Alright, alright… I give up,” Harry said, folding his arms across chest. “I can’t think what else it could be.”
“His friends keep setting him up on blind dates,” Draco said patiently. “But so far, they’ve all turned out terribly. He doesn’t really want to settle down with anyone right now, but they won’t stop arranging dates for him. So I said
“Alright, sounds good,” Harry replied, nodding. “How come your mum never gets involved with this bit, anyway? I’ve always wondered.”
Harry laughed. “I wouldn’t dream of telling you it’s less valuable. It’s a very valuable skill.”
Harry glanced across at him and grinned. “It smells fantastic.”
“That is an impressive result,” Harry said. “You’re not even a little bit wet.”
Harry nodded. “I am. It might have taken me a while to figure things out, but yeah. I’m happy. But can you do me a favour?”
“Is that where your ridiculous appetite came from?” Harry asked, remembering Ron’s almost constant need to eat while they were at school.
Harry pushed himself up off his chair, picking up his glass at the same time. “Should we do the dishes first?”
Draco nodded, moving to the end of the counter where the till was. He pulled his wallet out and quickly added up the price of his own sandwich, cake and coffee. “One Galleon, ten Sickles and 6 Knuts. Not bad for a decent meal, is it?”
Draco followed a second later, picking up most of the same flowers as Harry. Then they stood side by side behind the counter and began to make up their arrangements.
Draco stepped into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, thankful that Harry hadn’t closed the fireplace as he sometimes did. Looking around, he frowned. Everything seemed too still, and there was no evidence of someone being at home except for a single knife in the sink. He looked closer and realised that the knife had the remnants of dried butter on the blade.
“Oh, this is one of my favourites,” Harry said with a soft sigh of happiness. He sank lower under the blanket and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco continued along the street before turning down a side street. There was one window that still had a light in it and it was here that Draco stopped. “Alright, here we are. Bookworms and Brews.”
“Thank you,” Draco said again, moving across to the counter and picking up the cup with his name on. “Are the sandwiches both the same?”
Harry laughed. “Hey, you and I both know that we wouldn’t work long term. What we had was fun, but you and Arlo are definitely meant to be.”
Harry gave a huff of laughter. “Miles better. You know, I’ve never really been one for celebrating Valentine’s Day. Lord knows they never went particularly well for me at school.”
Harry laughed. “Well luckily I didn’t have to do anything that extreme. I, er, arranged my own dates,” he said before pausing. “I say dates, what I mean is ‘dates’.” He made air quotes with his fingers as he spoke.
They were quiet for a few moments as they ate their sandwiches, occasionally meeting each other’s gaze when they paused to take a drink.
the worst in each other and when we’re on the same side, we’re an unstoppable force. Why wouldn’t I like that?”
Draco grinned, picking up the tray and following Harry along the aisles.
Harry sighed. “Apparently when I’d go in in a bad mood, it took me ages to bring myself out of it and I would grunt at the customers, meaning he had to deal with them.”
“Oh, forgive me,” Arlo said apologetically. “I didn’t realise.”
The door swung open to reveal Draco who was running his hand through his hair. “What did he say?”
quiet?”
“No, just a partial one,” Draco replied cheekily.
“Oh, one of the junior writers, I think,” Pansy said, waving a hand. “I can’t remember his name. Very keen though.”
Arlo, who had turned red, gave the room a small wave. “Hello.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, let’s go. You look amazing too, by the way.”
“Yes, we probably should. I feel like I’ve been awake for days, if I’m honest,” Harry replied. “I think the busy days are catching up with me.”
“How many have threatened to sort him out?”
“True,” Harry said with a chuckle.
“Oh. Makes sense, I suppose,” George replied, nodding as he took another bite of pie.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, turning to look at Harry curiously.
quiet,” Draco replied, looking mildly horrified at the notion of speaking loudly now they were in amongst the books. “Just in case.”
good, I have to admit.”
“Here he is,” Alice said as she deposited the cat into Draco’s lap. “I wouldn’t usually do that with a cat, but he’s quite happy to meet prospective owners like this.”
Harry laughed and allowed Draco to lead him along the hall until they came to a doorway.
A few moments later, Draco returned carrying two bowls. He set one down in front of Harry. “There you go. Enjoy.”
“What? Oh,
“Is it that time already?” Harry asked, blinking in surprise as he looked up. “Bloody hell.”
“Yes, Ron,” Harry said with a laugh. “Despite his pettiness, I do love him, you know.”
“Eat your lunch first,” Hermione insisted. “He’s fine where he is at the minute. They were no further forward when I came away.”
Draco raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything. He opened the box and peered inside. “Lemon drizzle?”
“I’m sure it will be,” Harry said. “The ones they don’t find, we adults get to eat.”
“Fair enough,” Draco chuckled. “That would be my preference too.”
to get used to it.
Harry cast the spell and immediately ducked to avoid being hit by the spell rebounding.
Harry grinned. “Alright, alright. I’m drinking my coffee.”
Harry laughed. “Well, when you put it like that, people should be afraid of us. But, seeing as we’re florists, I’ll settle for them being jealous.”
“Goodbye, Harry,” Charlie said with a grin.
Harry laughed. “Me too. Should we go for dinner beforehand or should we just eat there again?”
Ron shook his head. “No, not a clue. He never said anything when I spoke to him last.”
Ginny snorted. “He’ll never go hungry. He’s got some kind of sixth sense for when food is about to be served. He’ll be here.”
Harry groaned slightly. “I’d forgotten about that.”
Charlie nodded. “Yes, although I don’t think Harry is usually subjected to an interrogation.”
Draco smiled. “It looks good. Let’s get it back in place.”
Within a few minutes, the stir fry he’d put together was ready and he settled himself at the table in the kitchen to eat. He found himself wondering briefly how Harry’s date was going before crossly banishing the thought. He was sure to hear all about it on Monday, he didn’t need to imagine scenarios right now. Instead, he thought of the book he was going to sit down with once he’d finished his food. He’d been dying to read it all week, but hadn’t been able to find the time so he was going to make the most of it tonight.
Harry looked suspicious, but nodded. “Alright. See you in an hour.”
Harry chuckled. “Sounds like most people. It’s good.”
“That’s a given,” Draco nodded. “I was horrible. I really should have shown them more respect.”
“Is that your way of saying you think I’m attractive?” Draco asked, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth as he looked up at Harry from where he was mopping the floor.
“So, I had to turn down a job offer this week,” Pansy said, taking a sip from her glass.
“Mm, I suppose so,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Oh well, that’s even better. We won’t have to be as quiet.”
Harry snorted. “I wouldn’t care if they did. Although it would probably raise some awkward questions from Molly next time I see her.”
“Probably,” Draco replied thoughtfully. “It’s not something we’ve discussed, but I suppose there will likely be a market for them, won’t there?”
“Oh, look, we’re in luck,” Harry said as they reached their usual alcove. “It’s free.”
me!” Harry said incredulously. “Why do you want to bid on me?”
“Thank you. Yes, please. A large glass of wine would do nicely,” Draco said pointedly.
The street itself was empty, which was unusual in Harry’s experience. Every time he’d visited Draco in the last couple of weeks, there’d been people out walking. Harry supposed that they were all home with their families. Turning around, he knocked on the door.
Draco shrugged. “It doesn’t matter who my first official date is, really. They’d all wonder who was lowering themselves to go out with me. The fact that it’s you is like their wet dream, except there’s a bonus of them all being far too afraid of upsetting you to approach me. Or worse, hex me.”
“Like what?” Draco whispered.
Harry nodded, sighing at the same time. “Exactly. I thought we were past that whole thing. Like we were just saying yesterday that they’d stopped. Maybe I haven’t been talking about ‘Adam’ enough or something. Anyway, are you alright with a fake date on Saturday night?”
“Cheeky,” Molly said with a smile. “Of course there’s enough food. Now, sit. It's almost ready.”
“I know, but I think I enjoy the whole experience of coming here rather than just enjoying reading the book,” Harry replied, grinning. “I like the discussion.”
Harry opened his eyes immediately, all pretence of sleep gone as he racked his brains to try and recall if he’d missed someone’s birthday. “...Tuesday?”
“Nope. Try again,” Draco said, his smile broadening. “Unless you want to give up?”
Harry shook his head with a smile, then he picked up the quill and charmed it to be self-inking before he forgot.
Harry nodded again. “Yeah, no problem. I’ll run down to the post office and send an urgent owl. Do we just want the same as what we’ve got?”
Harry laughed too. “It will, don’t worry,” he said as he walked around the table to sit beside Ron who, again, had Hugo on his lap and was blowing raspberries. “Ahh, we’re still on this, are we?”
“Oh, don’t be like that,” Harry said with another laugh. “I wouldn’t actually ask you to make it
“Oh, you’re here,” Draco said, a smile creeping onto his face. “I was beginning to worry.”
“So, you’re helping Harry avoid bad blind dates,” Narcissa began, cutting into her ham. “Do you have any blind dates of your own to avoid?”
“He’s perfectly healthy, and he’s been microchipped and vaccinated,” Alice continued. “He’ll be better off as an indoor cat after not being outside for so long.”
“In all honesty, no. But I can hope,” Harry replied. “I’m going over to The Burrow again on Sunday for lunch so I’ll probably get quizzed then. Last Sunday was for the kids, so I escaped being the centre of attention.”
“Of course,” Draco nodded. “I’ll go and give it to him now. Then I’ll kill him.”
Hermione gave him a sheepish grin. “Of course.”
“I can imagine. Pansy has good taste, anyway,” Harry said, chuckling.
“You have no idea,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Anyway. Can I get you anything else or is this it?”
By the time Saturday arrived, the weather had taken a turn for the worst and it had rained on and off for a few days which meant that the footfall past the shop had decreased as people had opted to stay inside during the frequent showers. Which had given Harry and Draco plenty of time to work on the pre-booked wedding centrepieces and they had all but completed the order.
Draco put his wand away and gestured for Harry to sit down while he went back into the kitchen to pick up his own plate again. “Do you want cutlery?”
“No, they look decent but they definitely need vases,” Draco said, frowning. “Let me see what we’ve got out the back for now,” he added, heading into the back room.
Charlie laughed loudly. “That sounds about right. Alright, so is this all that’s bothering you? That you’re avoiding blind dates by going out with a friend to read books?”
“Well, in the last few weeks, I’ve been on three separate blind dates and they were all horrific,” Harry said. “And you know what the common factor in those dates was?
“Very well. Would you mind explaining why you are in my office?” Professor McGonagall continued.
“A very sensible plan,” Molly said, nodding as she put a forkful of food into her mouth. “Not everyone has the benefit of being at school with their partner.”
“No, she’ll be happy, I think,” Draco replied. “She, ah, she knew how I felt about you before you did.”
“Er, maybe a fork,” Harry replied, looking at the food on his plate. He supposed that the coleslaw might be a bit messy to eat with his fingers.
“First,” Draco said. “Another coffee, I think. What do you say?”
“Oh, it absolutely was,” Harry replied, nodding. “I think it would be amazing warm with custard, but I am completely okay with it cold too.”
Ron snorted. “I’ll say. Most twenty-nine year olds can’t say they fought in a war before leaving school.”
Harry chuckled. “Smooth. I’m happy for you, Charlie.”
“You mean you two made these today?” Ginny asked, gesturing to the flower arrangements.
Pansy shook her head. “You’re both as bad as each other. What else do you want me to say?”
“I know, I know, it just… never mind,” Harry said, shaking his head slightly. “Come on, let’s go and get sat down.”
Harry sighed internally with relief, hoping that his face wasn’t giving anything away. “Yeah, he had quite a different experience to us. Although that would be true of anyone, I suppose.”
“Because he’s a black cat. A lot of people think black cats are bad luck omens,” Alice replied. “Something to do with witchcraft. It’s rubbish, of course.”
“I’ll mention it to Harry tomorrow. See what he thinks,” Draco said, rubbing at his chin with one hand.
“Hmm. So they are. Alright, well maybe it’s the air of authority you give off,” Draco replied, giving Harry an appraising look.
Draco laughed. “I’m sorry. Anyway, how have you been? I feel like we haven’t had a proper catch up for ages.”
“Right, let’s get our food on the way in this time,” Harry said, steering Draco towards the counter. “Then we won’t waste any time.”
“Well, them or anyone else you might want to give them to,” Draco replied with a shrug. “I just thought it might be better than leaving them here under the charm. There won’t be much call for them once Christmas is over.”
make fantastic roast potatoes. I don’t know how he does it.”
Harry laughed, but before they could continue the conversation, Molly brought the roast beef to the table. “Oh, wow, it looks great, Molly.”
Just as he was heading to the back room to get the watering can, the door opened and Draco arrived back with their coffee. “Are you working?”
“Maybe nine,” Harry said with a little shrug of his shoulders. “But I’m not really strict about it. Later would be fine too.”
Harry drained his coffee cup and dropped it into the bin before heading out into the shop to gather his supplies.
Harry felt the blush return to his cheeks as he turned to look at Draco. “Thanks,” he said faintly.
“Alright… I think I can cope with that,” Harry said, nodding. “As long as you promise to protect me from her.”
“Is this the last one?” Harry asked, nodding to the half-finished dried flower display in his hands.
“I know, but we can still do it,” Harry said, grinning. “We’re just that good.”
“They wanted me to go up to Hogwarts to cover some kind of tournament that’s going on,” Pansy replied, waving a hand. “I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t put myself in that castle for a week or more.”
“Pansy, I’m not against being happy! I’m against ruining one of the best things in my life on a whim!”
“Draught of Living Death,” Draco said with a sigh. “The idiot.”
“Well, seeing as all of our ‘dates’ so far have taken place here, why not continue what we started? Finish the book?” Harry suggested.
“We can fix that with magic,” Harry said. “I’m sure of it.”
“Have you finished already?” Draco asked in surprise, turning to look.
Harry laughed and closed the notepad, putting it back into the drawer. “I’ll do the floor tonight. You do the counters.”
“This would be the perfect time to do the hanging display if we had the flowers,” Draco said.
“It’s a shame we have to get rid of these. There’s still some life in them,” Draco mused as they removed all of the Valentine’s related flowers.
self-belief, will you?”
Harry knew that Narcissa was preparing to retire, despite only being in her early fifties, because she’d achieved her dream of owning and running the flower shop. Now that Lucius was home, he was sure that she must want to spend time with him that wasn’t dictated by a lunatic and that it made sense for the running of the shop to be left to Draco as a more welcome legacy than the one he’d almost been left by Lucius.
“I agree. It was probably the first brand new thing I brought into the house,” Harry smiled. “A good bed is very important.”
Harry nodded. “Of course we do. Are you ready to go now?”
“No, fair point,” Harry replied with a nod. “Alright. We’ll just sit here then.”
“Oh. Good point,” Harry said, nodding. He turned to look at the flowers again. “I suppose I could take them over to The Burrow with me in the morning. Are you going to take some for your mum?”
Harry gasped again, pulling Draco even closer as he rocked his own hips up.
Harry sat down and opened the bedroom box. Peering inside, he lifted some things out to start looking through them. After finding numerous decorative items that he supposed must be heirlooms, he put his hand back into the box and felt something soft under his fingers. Closing his hand around it, he pulled the item out of the box and stared at it. “What the hell is this?”
“Really?”
Harry rolled his eyes with a smile and made his way around the sofa. He placed the tray down on the low table and seated himself at one end of the sofa.
However, now that it was five o’clock, things were slowing down and Draco took advantage of a few minutes without customers to flip the sign on the door to ‘closed’. Turning to Harry, he breathed a sigh of relief. “I think that’s us done. Let’s get everything cleaned down, and we need to get that hanging display cleared out, too.”
“Quiet,” Harry said, making his way through the shop and joining Draco in the backroom. “I didn’t go to The Burrow this week. How was yours?”
“Well, you know, there has to be a reason for him to have kept the pretence up…” Pansy said, giving him a knowing look.
“Not too long, really,” Harry admitted. “Only a couple of months. We’re taking it a bit slowly.”
“Alright, thirteen Sickles, please,” the witch said, while gesturing to a falcon that was sitting on a nearby shelf along with a couple of others. They were obviously used for the priority deliveries.
Draco smiled. “I think it was a good choice to eat here tonight.”
“I absolutely agree,” Draco said, nodding. “This is one of my favourite places to come and relax. They’re open twenty-four hours a day, so there are always people here but unless you want to engage in conversation, everyone keeps to themselves.”
“Hello, Mrs Weasley,” Draco said nervously, holding out the bottle of wine. “Thank you for inviting me. I brought you this.”
Harry snorted. “Let’s keep that as a last resort. I’d rather be on the front page of The Prophet for being seen here with you than to be on it for bribing the restaurant owners to kick out other customers.”
became a chamomile tea drinker.”
have been doing a little dance,” Draco muttered, shaking his head.
He and Draco spent their days making up orders for what seemed like hundreds of weddings and birthdays, and found that they didn’t have much time to talk in between the orders and customers. The weather was constantly improving and with it, the sun brought people into Diagon Alley which meant an increase in people popping into the shop on a whim.
“I was alright, just starting to feel a little bit peckish as we got here,” Draco replied. “That has hit the spot though.”
Harry snorted softly. “I bet he did. Did you not think to question it when you were younger?”
Harry turned and caught the notepad that Draco threw at him, blinking in surprise. “What do you mean I need it more than you?”
Draco nodded. “I think she’ll surprise you. Do any of your friends know how you feel about me?”
Ron slid off the bench and propped Hugo on his hip as he left the room, collecting the changing bag as he passed Hermione.
“Draco! You’re early!” Pansy exclaimed as she opened the door. She leant forward to give him a kiss on each cheek. “Come in, come in. The weather is simply awful.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, slightly taken aback by the cup being shoved his way. “How did you know?”
Draco looked up as Harry called out from the hall and he smiled through a sad sigh. “In here.”
Draco shook his head. “Well, at least now you’ll remember to tell them you already have plans when they ask what you’re doing.”
Pansy rolled her eyes and stood up. “I’ll go and find out. Would you like something to drink in the meantime?”
Harry smiled to himself as he continued to sketch. The feeling of Draco’s shoulder against his own was comforting, in an odd sort of way. “There, what do you think?”
“Good. Well, should we head off now then? It’s getting quite late,” Draco said, returning the smile.
“Did she need to be worried?”
“Thanks,” Harry said gruffly. He wasn’t sure whether he was angry or amused anymore.
“Absolutely,” Harry replied. “We can get dressed and go along to the Chinese takeaway.”
“Stop it,” Draco replied, wrinkling his nose. “I don’t know how this happened. I swore to myself I wouldn’t let this happen.”
Draco frowned but turned around again, making his way into the parlour where he made himself comfortable in his favourite armchair.
Hermione studied his face for a moment before standing up too. “Alright, let’s go.”
“I could hear what you were saying,” Harry repeated, giving her a look. “Charlie is right. I am capable of sorting my own love life out.”
“Hmm?” Draco glanced down and shook his head. “No, they’re fine. Let me take your jacket though.”
“Well, we got here in the end,” Harry said with a small smile. “Let’s forget it now and move on, shall we?”
“I’m not exactly the tallest, am I, so maybe average height, with… do I need to be specific with features?” Harry said, looking up at Draco.
“You’re a lifesaver,” Harry called after him.
“I, on the other hand, love a good drink,” Ron said unapologetically. “Not that I do it every day, of course.”
Harry frowned slightly. “You’re not going to tell me?”
“Then let’s make up some details about your ‘date’,” Draco said, leaning forward. “That way, at least I’ll know who I’m supposed to be, too.”
“Really?”
Draco studied Harry’s drawing before reaching over and taking the quill from his hand, their fingers brushing against one another. “What about this?” he asked softly, making a couple of adjustments to the page.
Ginny bit her lip. “Blaise Zabini. He was doing some publicity shots for the team and I recognised him.”
Harry nodded, moving to grab the bucket and fill it up with clean water and floor cleaner.
Harry pressed his forehead against Draco’s as they parted. “I love you.”
“Oh, you think I do this for your benefit? No, no, I do this for me,” Draco replied with a shake of his head. “If you come in in a foul mood, I’d have to do all the talking to the customers because all you can do is grunt until you’ve worked your way out of your funk.”
“Oh, believe me, I can,” Harry said with a laugh. “I imagine you felt much the same as I did when I thought about leaving my aunt and uncle’s house. Granted, I didn’t actually leave under the circumstances I’d always imagined, but it
“Well, I’m sorry if I wasn’t psychic enough to know what you were planning!”
“Very true,” Harry said, starting to put his bouquet together.
As he reached the top of the stairs, he quickened his pace and found himself at Harry’s bedroom door within seconds. Hesitating briefly, he pushed it open and immediately let out a cry of surprise. Harry was laid, unmoving on the bed. “Harry?”
He hadn’t been back behind the counter for five minutes when the bell above the door chimed. Looking up, he found himself looking at Ginny Weasley. “Ginny. Hi.”
“Yes. Because we could end up with a variety of flowers in these colours,” Draco said as he joined Harry at the counter again. “So we could even use the same design for different flowers.”
“For some reason, I didn’t think you’d have so much stuff,” Harry said, looking around at the piles of boxes that were now sitting in the front hallway.
“They seem quite smitten with one another,” Draco said with a shrug as he moved behind the counter with his mop. “They’ve been seeing each other for a while, but they still go out on dates.”
“Oh? Are you going to the Manor?” Harry asked, pausing in his sweeping to look at Draco.
“Of course you’re not. Neither am I. We are perfectly normal adult males,” Draco said. “Who just happened to have spent the evening drinking coffee and reading a book together.”
“I think the rain is supposed to clear tonight,” Hermione said, a sympathetic look on her face. “I’m sure you’ll be busier tomorrow.”
“Excellent! Should we get the books first?” Harry asked, half out of his seat already. “We can read a chapter and then reward ourselves with cake.”
“Oh, now you mention it, I suppose that does count,” Harry said with a laugh. “This is no different.”
“Thanks. I got enough flowers for us both,” Harry said, smiling. “At least I think I did. If we need anymore, we’ll have to go and get them as we work.”
“I know, I know,” Harry said with a sigh. “She’ll get the message. I don’t mind her setting me up, I just want her to vet the bloke properly.”
“I suppose. I don’t know,” Harry replied, shaking his head slightly. “I was happy being single, to be honest.”
“How was your weekend?” Draco asked Harry as he walked into the shop on the Monday after his date with Tim.
Harry smiled and opened his book.
“They will, trust me, I’d much rather bid on a man than a cake,” Draco replied.
“Ah, the jasmines,” Harry smiled. “Yeah, they’re one of my favourites. Well, here you go, your bouquet is finished.”
“No we haven’t. We’re doing well, aren’t we?” Draco said, smiling as he picked his book up again.
Harry shook his head. “I didn’t eat there. My food was fine.”
“Oh, well that’s alright then,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes with a smile. “I am, however, willing to get you a slice of this every so often. If they have it in.”
“I don’t see why they couldn’t just put their names on the list,” Draco grumbled, turning away from Harry. “How is it fair to just expect us to sign up to dance with a number?”
“No, I suppose not, but it’s still a bit weird isn’t it? Twenty years old is just… I don’t know, maybe my view of being twenty is a bit skewed,” Harry said, frowning slightly.
“Are you sure?”
Draco shook his head again. “No. Mother didn’t want him anywhere near it when she was first setting up, for fear people would immediately associate it with him. So he’s never even visited. He’s supportive though.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, I suppose I wouldn’t mind a slice of cake.”
Once they were outside of the office and the door was closed behind them, Harry turned to Draco. “I haven’t had detention since I was fifteen! I certainly didn’t expect to be given one for being
He and Harry worked quickly and quietly, sweeping the floor and wiping all the counter tops down and before they knew it, they were locking up.
Harry sighed. “Alright. There is no Adam. It’s complicated, and it’s new, but… it’s good.”
“You know I am,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “Let me go and get us coffee and we can talk, okay?”
“You and I have a date on Saturday,” Harry said, taking a sip from one of the cups of coffee he was holding.
“See you,” Ron said, waving a hand as he turned back to his report, picking the quill up again.
Draco grinned. “I’m glad you’re enjoying it. Should I go and get the cake now?”
“I am, I just wasn’t ready for it to happen at a crowded New Year’s party,” Draco replied, making a face. “That is absolutely not the way I pictured breaking the news to my nearest and dearest.”
“Yes,” Harry replied defensively. “We were
Hermione turned and shook her head at him. “No, we got here a bit early,” she said with a smile. “Come and sit down. This is Tim.”
“We have indeed. It’s a miracle we all managed to turn our lives around,” Draco replied. “Anyway. Let’s not talk about all that. It’ll only depress us.”
Harry laughed, shaking his head. “I love you, you know. Even if you
Draco snorted. “Your poor date. Alright, I’ll go and get our food, shall I?”
“Oh, no doubt,” Draco replied, taking a drink from his cup. “I just don’t know the rules for arranging dried flowers.”
Harry was halfway through his lasagne when he almost choked on the mouthful he was eating. Draco’s foot was back, making it way up Harry’s thigh.
Draco turned pink. “I’m sure your food is just as nice.”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll still get your leg over when I go,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “Pansy, I need to talk to you.”
“You want me to keep this to myself, don’t you?” Ron asked with a sigh.
Draco nodded. “That works for the purpose of this, anyway,” he said. “So. Athletic. Tall? Short? In-between?”
Harry drained his coffee cup and threw it into the bin before joining Draco at the door to bring the delivery in.
“Oh, honestly!” Pansy tutted, sitting back in a sulk. “Draco, you’re being ridiculous. You’ve changed, Harry knows that and he likes you. He’s not going to suddenly hate you if you take a chance and it doesn’t work out. Wait until Theo comes in here. He’ll tell you the same thing.”
“Then why do you keep going on the dates they arrange?”
Harry waved and then pulled his head back out of the flames. His stomach had uncurled itself some time during the conversation with Charlie and he took the opportunity to go straight to bed. He knew if he sat up any longer, he’d run through everything over and over and probably not sleep all night.
Harry nodded, putting the lid back on the box.
Draco snorted. “You shouldn’t have said that, you might have jinxed us.”
Harry eyed him suspiciously. “What do you mean? How do you know it’ll be better?”
“I should hope not,” Tim replied. “It can have a very detrimental effect on your health, you know. The same goes for fast food takeaways. We’re very lucky to have these bodies in full working order. We should respect them.”
“We went to Bookworms and Brews,” Draco said. “We drank coffee and read a book.”
“It’s fine by me, as long as you keep me busy for a few hours,” Harry said, taking the bag back and lifting out the remaining box.
“Maybe we can do a giveaway?” Harry suggested, turning to Draco as they stood admiring the arrangements.
Draco set the tray down on the table before doing the same as Harry and taking his cloak off. “Why do you like this alcove so much?”
They spent another ten minutes finishing their coffee, chatting and admiring the view until Draco put his cup down. “Ready?”
“How is it that everyone seemingly knew before we did?” Draco asked, directing his question to no-one in particular.
“Much the same,” Draco admitted. “I stayed at home in the flat and caught up on a book I’ve been reading, and did some experimenting with a potion I’ve been working on. Pansy and Theo were going to her parents for lunch.”
“I know what you mean, don’t worry,” Harry replied. “I’m the same, really. A New Year’s party is usually an exception for me.”
“Well, of
“Draco, hello darling,” Narcissa said with a smile as Draco stooped to kiss her on the cheek. “Hello, Harry.”
“I know. I heard all about them the next day, remember?” Draco replied, one eyebrow raised.
“I know, I know, mine too,” Draco said with a sigh. “But it needs to be done. And at least we get paid to do it.”
“Maybe I do,” Draco breathed. “But it seems to me that it’s
Harry laughed again. “Of course, but you’ll have to do the talking. I don’t speak a word of French.”
“I thought you were going to tell them you already had a date?” Draco asked, frowning as he shrugged off his cloak. “Come on, shift out of the way.”
“Do you want me to bring anything?” Harry asked.
insane.”
Harry shook his head. “No, not really. They asked how it went, but that was about it.”
Harry grinned and turned, heading into the back room to get the mop and bucket. He picked up the sweeping brush and passed it to Draco as he went. His stomach was full of butterflies as he put the bucket under the tap and turned it on. He knew it was silly, really, considering they hadn’t talked about anything yet, but he couldn’t help but hope that this was the step forward they needed to get their friendship back to how it was before The Confession.
Molly smiled and nodded. “Apparently we did, yes. I’m sorry,” she said before turning to Draco. “So, Draco. Welcome. It’s nice to finally meet the man who’s made Harry so happy over these last few months.”
Draco shrugged. “I was just in a good mood. I didn’t even do anything that elaborate. It was just a little twirl.”
“Guess what happened last night,” Harry said, still frowning as he pulled his apron on.
“Yes, well, I am prepared to forgive and forget about that,” Draco said, looking at Harry. “As long as you talk to me about things in future, no matter how awkward.”
“She used to,” Draco replied as he went into the back room, shrugging off his cloak and hanging it up. “But, I think she’s of the opinion that since we’re the ones running the shop on a daily basis, we should be the ones making the decisions about what we stock.”
“Okay. I won’t be long. There’s still a couple of small orders that need doing,” Harry continued as he disappeared into the back room. He put the arrangement down on the counter, checking that the little card with the customer’s name was firmly attached. Then, without bothering to put his cloak on, he headed through the shop and out onto the alley where he jogged down to the post office.
“He means because I guessed his ‘something’ and then he didn’t guess mine,” Draco said with a smirk.
“Me too. Trust me, it’s a good thing. I’m pretty sure that takings are up compared to normal,” Draco said, smiling. “Mother is over the moon.”
“You can,” Draco said, shuffling around in his seat until he could lean over Harry’s shoulder. “So, we want a green base, I think.”
“No, no. I had dinner with Mother last Saturday,” Draco replied quickly. “No, I’m going over to eat with Pansy and Theo.”
“Can’t wait,” Harry said with a grin, taking his cloak from Draco. “Thank you for coming here tonight.”
Draco shook his head. “Well, stop for a minute, here’s your coffee.”
Harry grinned and leant over, kissing Draco quickly. “Wanted to do that before we go.”
I’ve got myself into a bit of a situation and I need to talk to someone. I can’t talk to Ron or Hermione, I don’t think they’d understand. Have you got any appointments in the UK soon? I could really do with a chat.
“Honestly, I’m sure I’ll love it whatever it is,” Harry replied with a smile. “What I’ve got you isn’t fancy either. Just a token gift, really.”
“You don’t talk about your father much nowadays,” Harry said after a moment. “How is he?”
“I can’t. They’re already worried about me,” Harry replied. “If I tell them I don’t want them to arrange more dates, they’ll worry even more. Well, maybe Ron and Hermione won’t, but I know Molly will. They were talking about me at dinner the other night, because Charlie has a boyfriend now.”
Sitting forward again, he took another drink, continuing to mull over the evening’s events. It had all started so well, and it had got even better when they were eating their desserts. He knew that if Harry hadn’t admitted to lying about being set up on dates, he would have confessed that he hadn’t bought the treacle tart from the café but had made it himself. It was lucky that he got on well enough with the café staff that they didn’t mind him putting the treacle tart on one of their plates to give to Harry.
Then, they hung it back in place and carried out their normal cleaning routine, making sure everything was clean and tidy for the duration of their break. Once they had finished, Draco pulled out his wand and cast a charm over the remaining stock of flowers that he knew would preserve them while they had a break. He was thankful that there wasn’t much left in terms of the fresh flower bouquets as they never quite handled the charm as well as the potted plants. A thought struck him and he turned to Harry. “We’ve only got a few bunches of flowers left. Do you want to take some for your friends?”
“No problem,” Harry replied over his shoulder as he headed into the back room again. “Once the bouquet is gone, we’ll both be able to pitch in properly.”
“I suppose we didn’t really
“Okay, here you go,” Harry said, walking around from behind the counter to hand her a quill. “Don’t tell Draco.”
“What would you say to a night of drinks and frivolity with me, Angelina and Angelina’s cousin?” George asked, a wide grin on his face. “Mum will have the kids so we can party all night long!”
“Well. I don’t think we can expect any more customers this afternoon,” Draco sighed as he slumped over the counter beside Harry. “That rain is really coming down.”
Harry sighed. “Because I’m an idiot? No, well I suppose that
Harry snorted. “Thanks, mate,” he said sarcastically. “See you tomorrow, then.”
“Thanks,” Charlie replied with a grin. “What about you? Anyone on the scene?”
“You spoil me,” Harry said, unwrapping the sandwich and taking a bite.
Harry laughed and looked over at Draco. “Noted. Come on then, let’s get locked up.”
“Is that all I’m getting? No explanation of the kinds of things you remember?” Harry asked with a laugh, taking another bite of the tart.
“Good call,” Draco nodded. “I like yellow poppies. There are some really nice ones.”
“At least your mother was surprised,” Draco muttered, shaking his head and causing Ginny to snort with laughter.
Harry grinned and opened the book, flipping through it until he located the last page they’d read.
“It was going well. We’d had food and read a chapter of the book we’ve been reading for the last few months, and we were talking about the whole situation,” Harry explained. “He said he’d started looking forward to our ‘dates’ so I felt I had to tell him the truth.”
Harry chuckled as they reached the table and chairs at the end of the aisle. “Of course. I wasn’t going to go shouting or anything.”
Draco stood up to clear the plates away. “Have you got room for dessert?”
want to be there, honestly,” Draco agreed. “But he was a good teacher, if you ever paid attention.”
“But have you made it for Potter yet?” Pansy asked, raising a mischievous eyebrow.
“Did she, now,” Draco said. “And what else did she say?”
“Alright, well, if you need me, I’ll be at home all night. I can be there in minutes,” Ron said.
“Oh, now, I like the sound of a takeaway,” Draco said, pausing again. “What kind?”
“What arguing would there be?” Ginny asked, craning her neck to look at him from her place on the floor. “Everything’s fine.”
“Just make sure you remember to come back,” Draco said. “I know how easy it is to lose track of time in here.”
“How come?”
Draco shook his head. “I wouldn’t offer if I minded. No-one has to know you’re just spending the time with a friend. All they need to know is that you’re busy.”
“Ah. He must have been a wizard though?” Draco replied cautiously. “To be attracted to the idea of going out with you?”
Draco smiled, pulling Harry even closer for the final few minutes of the gondola ride.
Draco laughed. “You could ask anyone to come for lunch with you, you know.”
Harry smiled. “I’m looking forward to it already.”
“Absolutely. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such similarities between a story and my life before,” Draco said with a sigh. “Not that I should be surprised by that, I suppose.”
he didn’t date much. He hoped that Harry was feeling the same.
Harry grinned. “I know some would call it boring, or not fancy enough, but honestly I can’t think of a better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day than going back to the place it all started.”
Draco was silent as he gazed at Harry for a few moments.
“I know what you mean. It’ll be nice,” Draco said as he unhooked the other side of the display unit. “Have you told them about us yet?”
“I will, don’t worry,” Harry replied. “It’s about time I took charge of my own life. I’m thirty years old, after all.”
“Why would I look at you like that? I doubt McGonagall would have let you come back if she thought you’d do something like that,” Harry said with a frown.
A few moments later, Harry was holding a tray containing their food and drinks and they were heading along the aisle to their usual alcove. Unfortunately for them, when they got there the alcove was occupied.
“Thanks. Enjoy your evening,” Harry called back with a grin as he turned and headed for the pub.
“Me!” Ron said, looking up at his mother. “I mean…”
“Will do,” Ginny said, giving him a wave as she left the shop.
good.”
“I’m not hungry,” Harry replied quickly. “And I’m not just saying that. I won’t be able to eat anything until I know he’s okay.”
“Okay, so I’ll go with… David,” Harry said.
“Thank Merlin,” Harry muttered with a grin.
Harry grinned. “Alright, I suppose I can make that sacrifice.”
“I’d say we’re getting along quite well, given that I’m in your bed,” Harry said, raising an eyebrow. “But don’t worry, I take your point.”
“I just thought, after this it would be… awkward working together,” Harry faltered. “I don’t want to leave. I love my job. But I’d understand if
Draco’s eyes widened briefly and he nodded. “Alright. I think I can manage to put enough on my plate.”
“You mean you haven’t read any books featuring posh boys that live in a Manor House?” Harry asked with a grin.
“Really? Why?”
“Of course. Um, I mean, if you want to come for dinner one night?” Harry asked.
“I don’t know either,” Harry sighed. “I just had to talk to someone about this whole thing and you were the only person I wanted to talk to. I couldn’t have talked to Ron about it.”
“We need to decide what kind of Christmas vases or baskets we want to get to put these flowers in,” Draco replied as he walked back into the shop. “We’ll just use this for now, to get an idea of what the display will look like but we probably won’t get the full picture until we put them in proper vases.”
“I need to hold it too,” Draco tutted, holding onto his end of the key firmly.
Draco nodded, taking a bite of his own treacle tart.
Draco leaned over to have a look and nodded. “Sounds good. Let’s see if we can get them done in this last hour before we close up.”
“Okay, sure,” Harry nodded, putting the cup holder and paper bag down on the counter so that he could take off his cloak. “Coffee’s got your name on it,” he added as he went to the cupboard.
Sighing, he waved his wand and the lamps flickered into life, casting shadows on the walls and bathing the room in a warm glow that only came from oil lamps. He smiled as he thought of the meal he’d just had. It was only now that he was home that he realised that they hadn’t had pie, even though it was a Monday.
“I’d rather
“You’ll get no arguments from me on that one,” Harry laughed. “Mind you, I wasn’t known for being the most respectful to Snape either.”
“I know,” Harry said after another moment of silence. “I promise you, Molly, I’m alright. I’m in no rush to settle down. It’ll happen when it happens. It’s not that I don’t want to settle down, you understand? I just haven’t found the right person, and I sort of believe that when I do, I’ll know.”
“Understandable,” Charlie nodded. “But if he said he’d been looking forward to going out with you, then that’s a good thing. There’s hope there, Harry. It might not be easy but I think you’ve still got a chance at fixing this.”
“Okay. See you back here at six-thirty?” Harry asked, pulling his cloak a bit tighter to shut out the cold air.
“I think so,” Ron said, nodding. “If not, Hermione will be able to fix me up.”
“I have no idea,” Draco sighed. “I just wanted to talk to someone.”
Harry grinned at him and then turned to look around once more. “Mm, trellis?”
“It is,” Draco agreed. “I didn’t think it would get
“You could always volunteer to be auctioned,” Draco said.
“Absolutely,” Draco replied. “Our midnight kiss was interrupted so I’d quite like to try again now.”
Draco shrugged again. “No idea. It just makes sense to me. Alright, get a new page in your notepad and we’ll brainstorm. What do you picture the bloke looking like?”
Harry laughed and stood up. “I hope the chapters are quite short. Not because I want to spend less time with you, but because I want to know what happens in the end!”
“It is Saturday, Harry,” Draco replied, biting his lip gently. “You’ve been asleep.”
Harry shook his head, but smiled and climbed in beside Draco, sliding his legs down so that his toes brushed against the other boy’s.
to him.”
“Any minute now, I would think,” Draco replied, checking the clock. “Hopefully there’ll be some fresh roses in it too. I know I’ll need some white ones, but what do you think about putting some pale pink ones in too?”
Harry followed, still holding onto Draco’s hand. He smiled at the assistant as they approached the counter. He squeezed Draco’s hand slightly. “What do you fancy?”
Draco smiled and leant over, kissing Harry once more, one hand resting on his cheek as he did so. “Sounds good.”
“Dancing!” Harry replied with a grin. “Come on, join me!”
A couple of hours passed and they made their way out of Bookworms and Brews and to the Apparition point.
“Oh no, no, it certainly won’t be formal,” Draco said, shaking his head. “No. Don’t you dare arrive in dress robes. I’ll be making spaghetti, so it’s probably best to wear something you won’t mind being covered in sauce.”
“Yes, I think we should,” Draco nodded. “Changing alcoves didn’t seem to go very well, did it?”
“I was home by nine,” Harry replied with a grin. “I gave him another chance after the meal, but he didn’t take it so I left.”
“No, I think you’re probably right there,” Harry replied. “And I don’t think that Jeremy has had to die to save everyone else, but it’s still nice to see similarities isn’t it?”
“No,” Harry said in a slightly grudging tone. “Of course we wouldn’t.”
“Okay, that one was for Madam Jenkins,” Harry said, coming back into the shop and crossing the name off his list. “There’s five more to do.”
“I don’t know,” Harry admitted with a shrug. “It hasn’t come up during Sunday lunch for a while. I just keep hoping she’s forgotten about me.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry saw her smile anyway. She was more than used to Ron by now. They all were.
Harry paused with his spoon halfway to his mouth. “You made that?”
By the time Saturday rolled around, both Harry and Draco were exhausted. On top of all of the orders they had to make up on a daily basis, they had been inundated with walk-in customers requesting all manner of bouquets and arrangements. For the last two days, neither of them had managed to leave the shop to get lunch and they had been grateful when Narcissa had brought them some sandwiches.
Draco nodded again. “I think so too. Where did you go on your first date?”
Five minutes later, they were back in their places in the parlour, glasses of wine in hand.
“Harry?”
“I hope so. I think we’ve made a move in the right direction,” Draco said, standing up. “And speaking of making a move, we’d better actually move.”
“Will she be put out?” Harry asked, tilting his head slightly as they carried the hanging display unit out to the back room where they could pull all of the flowers out of it.
“I don’t know anymore,” Harry said once he’d swallowed the mouthful. “Yesterday I was sure this was all going to be fine, but now, I don’t know how much more I can take of these dates.”
Harry shook his head. “I’ll be honest, they were left over at the shop and Draco said I could take them,” he said. “They’re in addition to your proper present.”
Draco laughed. “Alright, I won’t be a moment,” he said as he moved across the kitchen with their plates.
Harry felt himself flush at Draco’s words. “I don’t know, I really don’t. I honestly thought they knew me better than that, but their choice of men has been dodgy, to say the least.”
Draco smiled. “I think so too. It’s a bit close to the day to change our plans now, really. I know for a fact if I told Mother that I wasn’t going, she’d be incredibly upset. Knowing her, she’ll have planned a full three course meal.”
“Do you think one date will be enough for them to stop?” Draco said, tilting his head slightly as he looked at Harry.
“Not a problem,” Draco grinned, taking Harry’s hand. “I know just the place.”
Turning the corner, Harry was pleased to see that it was empty. In fact, the whole café was very quiet compared to normal. He could definitely hear the crackling of the fires more than he usually could. “Do you think we’re the only ones in here?”
Draco snorted as he got comfortable. “Malfoys don’t snore. I bet Potters do, though.”
Draco gave Harry an appraising look. He had to admit that the man looked good in his formal Auror robes. Until he’d started attending the Ministry functions, he hadn’t been aware that there was such a thing as formal Auror robes, but he could certainly see why. The robes were a much darker red than the everyday Auror uniform and the material clung nicely to Harry’s well-toned body, leaving little to the imagination.
Draco grinned. “Either is fine by me. But alright, we’ll keep it as a last resort. Should we get the waiter over then?”
Harry nodded, turning the book over to read the back cover. “It looks it. Are we going to discuss it afterwards? Or whilst reading?”
“I know,” Harry nodded. “We
Draco nodded again. “Yes, so please be kind.”
“I do, I do,” Draco nodded. “I just like reminding you. Anyway, we should make a start on these arrangements. I’m not as familiar with dried flowers, so it might take some getting right.”
“I had lunch with Hermione,” Harry said. “She’s arranged another blind date for me for tonight.”
“Oh, I love roast chicken,” Draco said, pausing for a moment with a faraway look on his face. “I can’t remember the last time I had it.”
“This is quite nice, actually, isn’t it?” Harry said, looking around.
Draco snorted. “Well, when you put it like that…”
“I… yes, I would think so,” Harry stuttered, blinking. “I don’t know when, though.”
“We can do it on Monday morning,” Draco replied as he swirled the mop around the small area behind the counter and put it back into the bucket. “It’ll take ages and you have a date. We can come in an hour early on Monday instead.”
Harry laughed. “Fair point. I’m sure they will. I mean, how could they not? Those bouquets were exquisite.”
They parted ways, Harry heading for The Leaky Cauldron and Draco heading for the Apparition point.
“And yours to me,” Charlie said, returning the smile. “It’s good to have someone other than a member of my family to talk to.”
“Oh, really?” Ginny asked, raising an eyebrow and turning to examine the two arrangements. After a few moments she picked up one of the cards and looked around. “Have you got a quill or something?”
“Go on then,” Harry said, smiling. “If there’s enough time before the food is ready?”
Harry turned to Charlie with a smile. “Hi Charlie. I’m alright, thanks. Plodding along, you know.”
Alice smiled. “Alright, do you want to follow me through to the meeting room and I’ll have Mr McGregor brought out to meet you?”
Draco inhaled sharply. “Why didn’t you leave early?”
“Did you go anywhere nice?” Molly asked, cutting up her slice of pie.
“A thought about a blind date, I assume?” Harry asked with a smile.
“I can imagine,” Harry said, nodding. “Sirius and Hagrid both told me how awful the place was. Although I thought it would have improved a bit when the Dementors were removed.”
Shaking her wet hair out of her eyes, Hermione stopped in her tracks. “What?”
“Alright, who was it this time?” Draco asked, sipping his coffee.
“I knew it would come in handy, keeping old vases,” Draco said, handing one of the vases to Harry. “Even if they never get properly used.”
That evening, Harry and Draco returned to Grimmauld Place full of roast beef.
“Oh, yes. Where do you think I do my experimenting with the plants?” Draco asked, moving past Harry. “Would you like a tour?”
“Tea, please,” Harry replied. “I try not to drink coffee once I’m home from work. I have a few different kinds of tea though, so just pick what you fancy. I’ll have chamomile.”
Harry opened the door and stepped outside, Draco following a few seconds later. They went through the ritual of locking the door and pulling the security gate shut before locking it with the padlock.
“I do, don’t worry,” Harry laughed. “And you’re right, you have been the best friend. Just don’t tell Ron, okay?”
“All the tension is gone,” Harry said. “I feel it too. I’ve missed talking to you like this, so I think I’ve been subconsciously holding tension somewhere.”
“I know, but I can’t help apologising,” Harry shrugged. “I feel like you had to put up with a lot from me at the beginning of the year.”
Harry frowned too. “Seriously?”
have worked between him and Harry, as surely if Harry was willing to lie to continue going on fake dates with him, it was for a reason? Shaking his head, his thoughts turned to work on Monday. He was sure that he wasn’t going to say anything to Narcissa unless he absolutely had to. Harry didn’t want to leave, and Draco didn’t want him to leave, so the only option was to move past the issue and continue working together as they’d done for the last few years. He just wasn’t sure
Harry sipped his coffee again, hiding a smile of his own.
“What are you doing here? We weren’t meeting until Saturday.”
Draco chuckled, shaking his head. “You’ll be fine. If this one doesn’t work out, then there’ll be another one. Who wouldn’t want to be your date?”
“No,” Draco agreed. “I would say not. I think they’ll appreciate the extra touch if you get some sparkly ribbon.”
“I didn’t think that
reporters are just as vile as they were when we were at school,” Draco said, making a face. “I don’t think they’ll ever improve.”
“What plans? Why didn’t you tell me this last night?” Harry asked with a groan. He pushed one hand through his hair, wincing as his fingers caught on a knot that had appeared overnight. He pulled his hand free, leaving his hair sticking up at all angles.
way to dance at a ball,” he said, taking Harry’s hand and pulling him close. “The only place for some of
The bell above the door chimed again and Draco walked in.
“Oh, you’re still seeing him?” Ron asked, blinking. “You haven’t mentioned him, that’s all. We thought maybe it had fizzled out.”
“As a matter of fact, he did,” Draco replied, lifting his chin. “It was certainly less stressful than a blind date. We went as friends, we ended the night as friends so in my eyes, that’s a win.”
to be in the dungeons… actually, your common room was in the dungeons! Where were you going when we all got sent back to the houses?” Harry asked as the thought occurred to him for the first time.
Draco shook his head. “No, normal time will be alright in the morning. I’m certainly not coming in any earlier.”
Harry frowned again and turned back to his menu. “I will,” he muttered. He didn’t know what Draco was playing at, but he couldn’t help but hope he carried it on when they got home.
Draco moaned into the kiss, the hand that was on Harry’s chest gripping the fabric of his shirt.
“Well I suppose that would make sense,” Harry nodded. “I half-expected her to tell me to bring him for dinner.”
“Not on your life,” Harry scoffed.
“And then a mixture of red, yellow and blue flowers,” Draco continued, his shoulder pressing against Harry’s. “Mostly yellow with pockets of red and blue.”
Draco blinked at him again, reaching into the carrier bag to pull out one of the boxes it contained. “Oh, I am. I am. Right, okay, well I’ll let you know what we’re doing before Saturday, if that’s alright?”
“Definitely,” Harry agreed, swallowing. “I’ll have this again.”
“If the reason was as pure as yours was, then eventually, yes I think I would,” Charlie replied, nodding. “But it will all depend on how you handle it from now on.”
“I’ll tell them we ate and drank, and that we might see each other again,” Harry said, shrugging. “I may or may not make up a name.”
“Yeah… I couldn’t help myself,” Harry said, feeling his cheeks heat up. “It… seemed right.”
“It’s just up here. You’ll find out when we get there.”
“We did good,” Harry said. “They look great.”
Draco shook his head once more and turned back to his brochure.
,” Draco said, handing a copy of the book to Harry. “I thought it was quite an appropriate topic.”
“Oh, really? I would never have known,” Harry said with a wry look.
“Well. Yes, I suppose that probably did affect how you behaved around him,” Draco said. “I can’t pretend I know how you felt because I never felt like any of the teachers hated me… although they probably did, thinking about it.”
“Ah, good choice,” Draco nodded, leaning over to pick the menu card up. “I’ve had that before. It’s good. I think I’ll just have the same, I don’t fancy any of the others today. Not to mention the tuna crunch is a no-no on a date.”
“Righto,” Harry nodded, fastening his cloak. “How many do we need to do?”
Harry coughed as he took another drink of water and Ron thumped him on the back. “Thanks,” he choked. “No, I suppose they don’t,” he added, glancing at Molly.
Harry twisted his mouth as he thought. “Can we just say blond? That way it’ll be easier for me to remember.”
“Then I look forward to seeing what the two of you can come up with,” Pansy said with a grin. “Will you be doing Christmas displays?”
“Because he is a people-pleaser. He wouldn’t be able to do that without feeling bad about it. If I arrange something, he’s not technically lying to them,” Draco explained. “Do you see?”
“What?” Harry asked, surprise evident in his voice.
“P… plants?” Draco asked, looking around briefly before looking back at Harry, who shook his head. “Alright then… paper?”
“I always forget how much I like that about you,” Draco said, grinning against Harry’s collarbone where he was planting soft kisses. “The impatience is always something to behold.”
Later that afternoon, Harry came back from his lunch with a frown on his face.
Charlie grinned. “Will do. Good luck with Malfoy, I hope everything goes well on Monday.”
He got himself a glass and went to the tap, filling it with some cold water before he headed upstairs. He wanted an early night after such a big meal, especially since he knew that tomorrow was going to be filled with more receipt checking. As he was climbing into bed, he made a mental note to call and get coffee for himself and Draco on the way into work the next morning. He was sure they’d need it.
“Oh, really?” Harry said, raising an eyebrow. “Well that’s a surprise. I didn’t think she’d be so okay with it.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Not even their name? Man? Woman?”
“Or we could use magic,” Draco said, the idea just occurring to him. “That way we’d get what we want.”
Draco laughed, leading the way back along the aisle towards the entrance. “Fair deal. Alright, then I’ll see you on Tuesday. Thank you for a pleasant evening.”
“Muggle-born. He’d heard my story as he was growing up,” Harry said bitterly. “Another one in a long line of hangers-on. I don’t know what Hermione was thinking.”
“So, let me get this straight, we stress about telling you lot about us and none of you are even bothered?” Harry asked, looking around the room.
Harry shrugged. “It was ten years ago. We’ve both grown up and realised there are more important things than a childhood rivalry.”
“Yes, there’s plenty of time,” Draco replied. “I’ve just got the sauce on cooking at the moment with a charm on it to prevent it boiling over or burning.”
“Yeah?” Harry called back, leaning backwards so he could see Draco through the doorway.
“You and everyone else in that corridor, I’m sure,” Harry laughed. “Merlin only knows what Ginny was thinking. George still reminds her of it every now and again.”
“Oh, yes, so we have!” Harry exclaimed, sitting up slightly before groaning again. “Slowly, though.”
Harry chuckled and they fell silent as they concentrated on the cleaning up, making sure that everything was ready for opening time the next morning.
“If you insist,” Draco said, heading into the backroom to get the cloth they used for wiping the counters over.
“This one:
“Really? What’s changed recently?” Harry asked, frowning slightly.
“It’s… about time I told you the truth, Molly,” Harry said apologetically. “There is no ‘Adam’. There, er, there never was.”
Groaning, he stood up and moved to the rug that was in front of the fire. He knew it was risky, but he needed to talk to someone and there was only one person who had any idea of the lengths he was going to. He took a pinch of Floo powder from the tin and dropped it into the flames, stating clearly “Charlie Weasley, Romania”.
Harry shook his head. “It’s alright, I know that you all meant well, you just all forgot to listen to me, that’s all.”
Draco shook his head. “No, I don’t either. I now see why you like to go there to eat. Mrs Weasley is a very good cook.”
“Maybe next time she should set you up with a woman,” Draco suggested as the delivery van pulled into the bay. “It might be easier.”
“Oh, er, Romania,” Harry replied, glancing around.
“Draco, please, this is fine,” Pansy said, sitting forwards in her chair now. “You always did have a bit of a thing for him at school.”
“Alright, alright,” Draco said, chuckling. “I think I can make it up to you.”
“Oh. Blaise is here?” Harry asked, his eyes widening slightly. “How do you feel about that?”
“Thank you. So, tonight, shall we meet at six again?” Draco asked. “I won’t be going to have dinner with Mother today, so I don’t mind if you want to meet at a different time.”
“I…” Harry began, before stopping. He’d been about to say that he already had a date, but then he remembered George’s first question. “I can come for a drink but I can’t be out all night,” he finished lamely.
“Neither have I, but I saw some in one of those magazines we were looking at when we were rejigging the stock,” Harry replied. “I thought they looked good and wondered
Draco snorted. “Why do these things always happen when I’m on my lunch?” he asked, an amused grin on his face. “And why, for the love of Merlin, didn’t you move that pot with magic?”
“Yes, eventually,” Draco said. “Thankfully. Once she understood that it wasn’t that I fancied other girls, but boys, she stopped being so overbearing and I was glad of her friendship.”
Theo laughed and continued to place his napkin on his lap too. “Oh, fair enough. He’s safe, then.”
“What happened?”
“Too right you will. I did it yesterday,” Draco replied with a snort. “It’s your turn.”
Harry’s eyes widened, “No. Absolutely not. You are not using me for the cause,” he said, shaking his head.
Harry picked up his menu in relief, glad that it gave him an excuse not to make eye contact with anyone. He always found these dinners uncomfortable because Lucius did his best to make them so.
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me!”
Harry smiled and shook his head. “It’s fine, honestly. I’ve got some for Hermione, Ginny and the others, too.”
Draco chuckled. “And snuggle under a blanket in front of the fire?”
, no!” Harry exclaimed, dropping his fork. “No. Nothing like that, thankfully.”
The last weeks of February passed fairly uneventfully. After the rush of Valentine’s Day, business was always a little bit slower, which Draco was grateful for. It gave them a chance to think about whether they wanted to redesign the layout of the shop, whether they wanted to bring any new stock in and which of their range they wanted to phase out. It was something they did every year, but it never got any easier.
“Alright,” Harry said, laughing. “Sorry, I forgot it wasn’t here permanently.”
“But why?” Harry asked with a frown. “Who would want to do something like that to anyone?”
“Probably somewhere like the Manor,” Draco replied as they turned the corner towards the coffee shop. “She seemed the type.”
“No, no, we’ve only been out a couple of times,” Harry lied. “We’ve both been busy with work.”
“It’s no trouble to me. Like I said, I don’t do socialising at the best of times, so the chances of me being busy are small,” Draco replied. “So. Same place as last time okay with you?”
Harry snorted. “Rather you than me. Who’s she going out with?”
Draco shook his head. “You’ll always be Granger, no matter how many Weasleys you marry.”
Draco snorted. “What did you expect?”
Draco shook his head, taking a sip of his coffee.
“Good point. Right, I think I’ve got everything I need,” Harry said, looking at the pile of flowers in the trug. “I’m going to make a start.”
“Very funny,” Harry said, making a face. “You know it’s because we have so many customers.”
of all people?”
“No problem,” Harry said, turning and heading back out into the shop. “Any special requests?”
“No I don’t think we will either. It hasn’t been a bad day, though,” Harry said. “We’ve done a good trade today.”
When Draco walked in a few moments later, Harry was still standing in the entrance to the backroom, bucket in his hands and a confused expression on his face.
“I can’t believe you’re making us do this,” Harry hissed in Draco’s ear as they entered the restaurant. “Don’t you think we have bigger problems to worry about than dinner with your parents?”
“Forgive me, I was focused on something more important than your shrinking table,” Harry said wryly.
“You are the worst,” Harry murmured, pressing another kiss to Draco’s neck, sucking lightly. “All I can say is that you’d better be planning on following up on that little display. Right. Now.”
dancing!” Draco exclaimed, backing away again. Looking around, he tried to catch the conductor’s eye. After a few agonisingly long moments, where he could hear people sniggering, he succeeded and signalled that the music should be slowed down again.
“It’s all written down. Go on, get out there and get started,” Draco said, gesturing to the notepad. “I don’t want to see you until it’s done.”
“Yes, I think we should,” Draco replied. “We’ll need to get them right before we put them on display.”
to settle down?”
“Well,
“I couldn’t do anything to help, Rose only wanted Hermione,” Ron replied with a wave of his hand. “Are you going to tell me
to have a conversation about it, because, after all, it was in the past. Frowning, he made his way to the Leaky Cauldron to use the Floo.
Harry moaned softly, one hand caressing the back of Draco’s neck as he slid it up to thread his fingers through Draco’s hair.
“Yeah, I like the sound of that,” Harry nodded, taking another bite. “And it’ll save you from coming up with different books each time we come here.”
“Well, no, but I haven’t
That afternoon, as he bid Draco goodbye, Harry couldn’t help the feeling that settled in the pit of his stomach. He wanted nothing more than to invite Draco over, but he couldn’t bring himself to actually do it. For all they were friends now and had conversations about all manner of topics, they’d never truly discussed
“Alright,” Draco nodded. “I’ve done a bit out here too but there’s still plenty to do.”
“I know, I know. I just keep hoping you’ll change your mind,” Ron said sadly.
Harry grinned and nodded. “See you Tuesday.”
“It can be,” Harry agreed, gasping softly at the tickling sensation. “But not today.” He slid his hands down Draco’s back until they were on his backside and then he squeezed gently.
“Do you want a card?” Harry asked, looking over at Ron.
“This is the last place before home,” Draco said.
“Judging by your mood, something bad,” Draco said, a frown of confusion creasing his brow. “The last time you were this upset was… oh. Someone tried to set you up on a blind date?”
“He seems a very pleasant young man,” Molly replied carefully, and it was evident to Harry that she wasn’t fully sure about Ginny’s choice in partners.
Draco grinned and shrugged, opening his book. “Let’s just read, shall we. Another three chapters, do you think?”
“Me too,” Ron replied, nodding. “Me too. It’s got to just be a matter of time now. We’re getting closer.”
“This isn’t funny, Draco. Hermione didn’t tell me who this man is,” Harry said, frowning. “I can’t believe this. I’m going to have to call her when I get home and find out. This is just what I need.”
“I knew it was going to rain today, I just didn’t think it would be this bad,” Harry replied, his chin propped up on one hand as he gazed out of the window.
“Why not? It’s been ten years since you were last there,” Draco said with a small frown. “And you wouldn’t have to stay in the castle, surely?”
“Oh. Delivery’s here. Chop chop!” Draco exclaimed, moving to open the door.
“Something wrong, Mr Potter?” Lucius asked, his eyebrow raised.
Harry shook his head after a moment. “No. I’ve been wondering how to tell you the same thing. I think if you were anyone else I wouldn’t be feeling like this. But as it is, I’ve never felt like this about anyone else.”
“A Portkey?” Harry asked, his eyes widening as he looked up at Draco. “Where are we going?”
“Did George not tell you anything about this man?” Draco asked, turning to Harry with another frown. “You really need to stop accepting dates with people you know nothing about.”
As they entered the kitchen, Harry blinked in surprise. “I don’t know why, but I didn’t expect this much food.”
“Here you go,” Draco said when he returned, handing a plate to Harry.
“Mm, go on then,” Draco said with a nod as he stretched his arms briefly. “Maybe a cake too?”
There was a rumble of noise as everyone began to serve themselves. Tureens of vegetables and potatoes were passed around the table, followed by a platter of freshly sliced roast beef. Harry watched surreptitiously as Blaise served himself conservative portions of each food that came his way and couldn’t help the smile that formed on his face. No-one else’s portions were anywhere near as small as Blaise’s.
from Auror training and thinking up aliases.”
“So? One more week wouldn’t do any harm,” Harry said. “It would be better than sitting through this after that argument.”
Pansy looked at him thoughtfully. “Yes, I suppose that does make sense. So what did you do?”
Harry nodded, downing the last of his coffee and placing the cup down. “We’re not doing it here?”
Draco grinned. “I’m sorry. I couldn’t help myself,” he said, leaning over to kiss Harry softly.
“Lucky you,” Draco snorted. “You’d never have got it back if she’d got into it.”
Draco narrowed his eyes as he looked around the shop again. “Poppies?”
Harry stood up and headed for the door without any further prompting.
Harry nudged Draco and they moved further into the room, sitting down on one of the free sofas.
Harry snorted. “It is, as it happens, but that’s not the point. I just don’t want to be responsible for attracting a crowd of onlookers while we eat.”
Once they were happy with their selection, Draco put his plate down and went to the cupboard, taking out the table and chairs. He put them on the floor in the lounge and pulled out his wand before pointing it at the table and reciting the incantation.
“One more day won’t make much difference, I suppose,” Harry said thoughtfully. “If there’s nothing suitable, we could put in a last minute order to be delivered tomorrow.”
“Oh. I suppose that makes sense in a way,” Harry said, nodding slightly. “But none of you have really had big families.”
Draco sighed. “Go on. I know you want to say it.”
Before he could wonder anymore, Draco popped his head into the room again. “Food is ready if you’d like to come through.”
Draco grinned to himself and walked around the shop, adjusting the position of a bucket here and a vase there. Everything looked perfect and he smiled with satisfaction. If anyone had told him while he was at school that one day he’d be working in a florist owned by his mother alongside Harry - bloody - Potter, he would have laughed in their face. But now, he thought, now he wouldn’t change things for the world.
A few moments later, he was looking into the kitchen of Ron and Hermione’s cottage. “Weasley!”
Groaning softly as he removed his travelling cloak, Harry looked across at Draco. “I don’t know about you, but I haven’t got the energy to do much now.”
Draco shook his head. “Next time, either wait for me or use magic,” he said. “I don’t want to come back to the shop after lunch one day to find you knocked out on the floor and the till empty.”
“Will we have any with the delivery?” Harry asked, pausing with his cup halfway to his mouth.
Draco nodded, heading along to the lounge. “I did. I was worried beforehand. I know it was probably silly to be, but… old habits die hard, don’t they?”
“I can’t say it while you’re in this state,” Pansy said, making a face. “I want to, trust me. Do you think that is the reason?”
“Er, yeah. I brought coffee and bacon sandwiches,” Harry said, holding up his hands. “I thought we might need… sustenance.”
Draco shrugged. “Probably five or so years ago. It fizzled out quite naturally, though. There was no big falling out or anything.”
“Yeah, there was no queue, miraculously,” Draco replied, handing one cup to Harry as they met at the counter. “Or maybe it’s not so surprising, given that it’s pissing down.”
“It’s still going well?” Ginny asked, pushing her hair back over her shoulder with one hand.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. Don’t worry,” Harry laughed as he picked up the bouquet and carried it into the back room.
“Well that doesn’t surprise me. I mean, it’s
Harry laughed. “No, that doesn’t surprise me. I don’t know if anyone else would really care that they’re seeing each other though.”
“Well, be prepared for more questions from Mum and Hermione later. They’re dying to know who he is,” Ron said as a large pie dish floated it’s way to the table.
“Alright, so the book. Should we set a goal to read tonight?” Draco suggested, looking at Harry. “Maybe three chapters? They’re quite long. Then we can read the rest next time.”
Draco nodded. “Thanks, Weasley.”
“What are we putting in the hanging display now?” Harry asked ten minutes later, glancing across at Draco as they were about to make a start on sorting through the delivery.
“No, I didn’t want to interrupt her Sunday,” Harry replied regretfully as he unlocked the delivery door. “It’s the only day she gets a proper lie-in. Ron gets the kids up and dressed and takes them out for a walk.”
Draco blinked. “Really? He rings a bell?”
Harry laughed. “Alright. That does sound good.”
“I think so. I like the variety that we’ve got in there already, but maybe add a note to request things that will stay fresher for longer if they’ve got anything,” Draco said, wrestling with the cellophane as he wrapped it around the vase.
“Maybe. Sort of wish I’d gone down that route now,” Harry said with a shrug. “Although I do love this job. It’s satisfying in a completely different way to the Aurors. And it’s great not having to look over my shoulder the whole time I’m at work.”
As they stepped out onto the floor, the music changed and the slow waltz that the band had been playing changed into a jaunty, fast-paced number.
“No, not at all. I’m glad we’ve grown as people,” Draco said, absently stroking Harry’s stomach. “It’s much nicer than it used to be.”
“Good. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m just going to do a quick check of what we’ve got out there on the floor while you finish your sandwich,” Draco said, moving past Harry and into the main shop area.
“I’m glad you found it fun, even though you weren’t here,” Harry replied. “Am I forgiven?”
Harry laughed too and shoved at Draco lightly. “Come on then, lead the way to the delicious buffet.”
“Harry, have you got any of the red ribbon left over there?” Draco asked one Wednesday afternoon. They hadn’t stopped all day, with only one short break each to get some lunch. “I need some for the base of this arrangement for Mrs Wildling.”
“I don’t have a
pleased when I threw up over the washing line,” Ron said, making a face at the memory.
“But does the new Draco want to be happy?” Pansy asked wisely. “Because he’s in danger of letting something good go, if he’s not careful.”
“Trust me, you do the baby ones better than I do,” Harry said, giving Draco a look.
“Well, no, it’s not really a dessert for Christmas,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Not that I’ll complain if you
“Well, then, I can’t wait to find out what it is,” Harry said, smiling back.
“Bye, Hermione,” Harry said, giving her a wave as she headed back out of the shop, tugging the hood of her robes up as she went.
“Alright, well let’s decide on Saturday, then,” Harry said, taking a sip from his cup. “We’d better finish this before the delivery comes.”
Draco snorted as he accepted the glass from Pansy. “I understand. Potatoes are important.”
“Glad to hear it.” Draco grinned. “Now, since we have tomorrow off, what do you want to do?”
Harry shook his head with a grin of his own. “I’ll go and sort the returns out in the back while you do that,” he said, gesturing to the mopping. “Then we'll be able to leave on time.”
Draco was always very aware of his surroundings when he was in Pansy’s home, simply due to all of the Muggle contraptions it contained. He was very grateful that the armchairs and sofa had been taken from Pansy’s family home. “Alright,” he said, fixing Pansy with a look. “Spill the tea.”
“Don’t worry, I will. Right, I’ll see you when I get back,” Draco replied with a grin and a wink as he headed out of the shop.
Draco nodded. “Yes. We probably should have, and I expect if either of us had been in a better frame of mind, we would have thought about it.”
Harry jumped slightly and let out a groan. “You shush! I’m
“I love you too,” Draco replied.
Draco nodded, looking pleased with himself. “Yes. We’ve got time to eat and then we can take a sunset gondola ride along the grand canal and take in the view of the Rialto Bridge.”
“So tomorrow we need to start getting the centrepieces done for the wedding booking next week,” Draco said as they walked through the shop. “They’re dried flowers so we can do them early.”
“Probably,” Draco said with a nod. “It’s Valentine’s Day, most people will be out at some fancy restaurant, won’t they.”
the ones who run it. As long as it gets done eventually, she won’t care
Harry grinned and stepped forward and slid his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him close. “Me too,” he murmured as their lips met. He ran one hand up Draco’s back as they kissed, caressing his neck gently.
“So you’re already thinking of next time?” Draco asked, raising one eyebrow.
Frowning, he plated his food up and carried it across to the table, still deep in thought. He began to eat absentmindedly, wondering when he’d started to feel this way about Draco. He knew it hadn’t been this way when they’d first started working together, not given the amount of arguments they’d had over those first few months. Narcissa had made sure she was always present while they were working back then. It hadn’t been until they’d proven they weren’t about to hex each other silly that she’d felt comfortable enough to leave them alone in the shop, and now they ran the shop together with only occasional visits from the Malfoy matriarch.
“Sorry,” Draco said with a grin. “It’ll be no trouble though, I’m sure.”
Harry chuckled and nodded, heading into the lounge as Molly disappeared back into the kitchen. “Merry Christmas everyone!”
“Have you got any idea where the things you don’t really need anymore are?” Harry asked, looking at a box labelled ‘dress robes’.
Harry glanced at Ron. “What do you make of that turn up for the books, then?” he asked, nodding at Blaise and Ginny.
They stopped talking as they reached Bookworms and Brews, quickly climbing the steps that led to the entrance. Once inside, they made their way past the café counter and into the high stacks. The lighting and smell were exactly the same as Harry remembered and he breathed in deeply, smiling to himself. They continued walking until they came to the first free alcove, which happened to be the one they’d sat in on their first ‘date’.
“Really? I didn’t know there were such areas of London,” Harry replied, making another impressed face. “How did that happen?”
“It’s amazing. It reminds me a little bit of the library at Hogwarts; nice and cosy. It’s what a bookshop should be like, no?” Harry replied.
Draco sat down beside him, leaning across to put his own glass on the table. “Now, this present isn’t anything fancy,” he said warningly. “But I wanted to give you something.”
Harry nodded, ringing the purchases through the till. “Thanks… yeah, I’ll see you later.”
Draco looked up and wrinkled his nose. “You’re right. I hadn’t noticed. Great, just what we need. Are you nearly done with that order?”
“We’ve been playing a game,” Draco said. “We had to keep ourselves amused somehow.”
“Yeah, sorry about that,” Harry said, flushing.
“Thankfully, no,” Harry said with a grin. “We don’t sell anything carnivorous or poisonous, for exactly that reason.”
Draco nodded. “Yes. I know that also seems like a big leap, but I wasn’t sure how you’d feel about a restaurant meal.”
“I had to come up with something new. There wasn’t anything that I found suitable while I was researching,” Draco said. “And now I’m trying to fine tune it. I’ll get there in the end.”
Draco waved goodbye to Harry and hurried along the street to the Apparition point. He had been invited to join Pansy and Theo for dinner and he didn’t want to be late.
“Lucius, behave,” Narcissa chastised. “This is your only son and his partner.”
Harry laughed. “Yeah, but just think of how amazing it’ll look when we’re done.”
Draco lowered his gaze again, meeting Harry’s eyes. “If you didn’t put it there, then who did?”
Draco shrugged. “This is nothing special, but I wanted to make an effort given that it’s our first Valentine’s Day together.”
Draco watched him for a moment before turning his attention to his own book.
“Right… but you think these are good?” Draco said, giving him an odd look as he gestured to the drawings.
Charlie groaned. “Don’t make me feel worse than I already do! I have eaten but I wouldn’t say no to a cuppa.”
“You’re not Charlie.”
“What do you mean you’re helping out a friend?” Narcissa asked, raising an eyebrow slightly.
“Well it would be something to do,” Harry replied, shrugging one shoulder. “Either that or we sit here like this for the next three hours.”
“Not a bad way to spend a summer,” Draco said, nodding slightly. “So where did you go from there? Many wild nights with many men?”
Harry laughed again. “Well, that’s something I would never have guessed.”
This seemed to signal the end of conversation for now and everyone focused on emptying their plates. Harry mulled over what had been said as he ate, wondering if they all really believed what he’d said. Fortunately he was saved from his thoughts by a shriek.
“Glad to hear it,” Draco murmured, taking another sip of his coffee. “Now, forgive me, but I need to eat this chocolate cake because it smells too good to ignore any longer.”
“That depends. Will you use my mug again?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Here, let me see,” Draco said, moving to look at the bouquet from all angles. “It looks a bit one-sided. Try spreading the flowers out a bit more and it’ll look better.”
Harry opened the door a crack and peeped out, before slipping through it and running down to the Floo.
nervous! What if they kick me out? Or worse! What if they don’t even let me
“Oh. Well, still. I appreciate the sandwich,” Harry said, shrugging. “And the coffee.”
Draco grinned too. “I’d say this is possibly even fairer than a Quidditch match. Okay, let’s get started.”
Ron turned his head to look at Harry. “Nah. No point when I’m going to hand it to her. I’m going to take one of these too,” he said, picking up one of the potted jasmine plants. “It smells really nice.”
Harry snorted. “Best not.”
“Draco! You could have brought me this any time in the last ten years,” Harry exclaimed, his eyes wide. “Why didn’t you tell me about this talent of yours?”
“A date. You and me. Me and you,” Harry repeated, holding out the little paper carrier bag he had in his free hand. “I bumped into Molly. She wanted me to go out to dinner with the son of one of her friends. I told her I already had plans. You should be proud of me.”
“I thought we’d do a sort of book club evening,” Draco replied, gesturing for Harry to sit down in one of the squishy leather armchairs they’d reached. “If that’s alright with you?”
“Harry! You made it!”
Draco nodded. “I like that too, funnily enough. It’s nice to see myself represented, although I don’t think George has done as many awful things as I did.”
“Back in a second then,” Harry replied as he reached the door, slipping through it and heading down the street. It was a good thing that the coffee shop was open from six am, he thought.
“I’d try Madam Malkin’s first. Or Twilfitt and Tattings,” Draco replied. “It won’t be the same kind of ribbon, but it’ll be nice. Have the family not asked for something specific this time?”
Before he knew it, his plate was empty and the TV show was finished. Instead of changing channels, he turned the TV off and stood up. He headed into the kitchen and washed his plate up before putting it back in the cupboard. As he did so, his thoughts strayed to the conversation he’d had with Ron that afternoon and how easily he’d been able to say that he already had a date. He wasn’t sure why, but after those first few dates, the thought of any more sent a chill up his spine. Since he’d split with Ginny, he could count on one hand the number of dates he’d been on before all of these blind dates and, if he was honest, the thought of being out there on the dating scene scared him. He still had to deal with people who were only interested in him because of his name – as had been evident by his date with Conor – even though it was nearly thirty years since the date he first defeated Voldemort as a baby and ten years on from the battle of Hogwarts. It certainly made it harder to trust people upon meeting them.
“If he needs me to, yes,” Draco said with a nod. “It was nice having company there for once.”
As the afternoon wore on, and the customers got fewer and fewer, Harry and Draco took the opportunity to take the weight off their feet for a while. Harry picked up a quill and began to doodle on his notepad, while Draco watched.
“Alright. I spy with my little eye something beginning with… “ Harry began, pausing as he gazed around. “P.”
Draco groaned and tilted his head back to rest on Harry’s shoulder. “I can’t believe that I am so nervous about going to lunch with the bloody Weasleys. What has happened to me?”
“Merlin, I thought you said this was easy,” Draco muttered, looking around again.
Draco watched him for a moment before moving into the back room to pick up some florist’s foam. “Hey, Harry?”
Draco snorted softly as he took a bite of his steak, and Harry wondered how he could be so composed while carrying out his teasing.
Instead, he made his way through the tables and joined Draco, who looked up in surprise.
Harry’s frown deepened as he considered the question. His past relationships were certainly varied, and nothing alike except for Ginny and Charlie. “I don’t think I have a type…”
Ginny shook her head. “No, I’m going to go over to his place this afternoon.”
Harry snorted again. “No. Far from it. After Charlie, I went out with a few people here and there, but it never turned into anything more. Same old problem that I’ve been having lately, really. I’m an absolute disaster when it comes to relationships.”
“Harry! Merry Christmas, Harry!” A chorus of voices came.
. He couldn’t do anything while Harry was at work, and it grated on him. Harry insisted that he didn’t mind coming home and having to clean up or make the dinner, but Draco felt useless. He didn’t like feeling useless. He wanted something to occupy him while he was alone in the house and he’d made up his mind to discuss it with Harry when he got home. Glancing at the clock, he sighed again. Only four hours to go.
“Hey, don’t complain,” Draco said, pointing a finger at him. “The more business we bring in, the better wages we end up with.”
“Oh, yes, I would think so. You could make a fortune,” Pansy said, nodding. “It’s certainly something you should think about.”
“Don’t be daft. Anyway, even if he did, I’m sure he wouldn’t if he found out what I’ve been doing the last few months,” Harry replied sheepishly.
“Harry! When did you get here?” Ron called as he looked up from where he was playing with Hugo. The little boy was giggling madly as Ron pulled faces at him.
“Oh… it was nothing,” Molly replied, her already flushed cheeks turning even pinker. “Come on now, everybody tuck in.”
Harry laughed. “Yeah, that wouldn’t be great before a big game. It’s awful, feeling too full when you’re flying.”
since he’d been invited for dinner.
“Well, you’d think so but apparently we’re wrong about that,” Draco replied. “It’s a good job we can hide away and do them so no-one gets to witness the abominations we sometimes come up with.”
“Fiction. That last book was very interesting, but I wanted something a bit more lighthearted this time,” Draco said as they turned down the smaller alley that led to the bookshop.
“Pansy, must you do that where people can see?”
,” Harry said with a sigh. “I was just… alright, I realise that this is probably just going to make me sound insane, but I realised that if I wasn’t being set up on blind dates, there’d be no chance of coming here with you.”
“It’s one possibility. We are looking into it.”
moves is the bedroom,” he murmured into Harry’s ear as they set off around the dancefloor, twirling and gliding in time.
“No, absolutely not. I promised that I would wine and dine you, and that’s what I’m going to do,” Draco retorted. “Besides, this place is much nicer than the Manor and I’m sure it’s nicer than your place.”
“Pansy. You know I love you, yes?” Draco asked, watching as Pansy nodded. “Then trust me, you would not enjoy it. It’s too quiet there for you.”
“Alright everyone, tuck in!” Molly said, smiling around at them.
Harry looked around, taking in the room’s appearance. The decor took him by surprise as he’d imagined that it would be similar to Bookworms and Brews, with dark wood and leather everywhere. But the room he was looking at had no dark wood or leather at all, instead, the walls were painted a pale grey colour, and the furniture was natural wood with an incredibly comfy-looking sofa and armchairs arranged around the edge of the room. The window let in plenty of light and there were plants everywhere. “It’s all so light,” he said, unable to help himself.
“I’m sorry, what?” Charlie asked, blinking as he stared at Harry. “A mini
going to bring him to Sunday lunch at some point, aren’t you?”
“Alright, alright, I
On the last Saturday, Harry and Draco found themselves with a quiet period.
“I know. How did we forget about that wedding?” Harry asked, grabbing the sweeping brush.
“Aha, these will do,” Draco’s muffled voice came from the cupboard. He emerged into the shop once more, a non-identical pair of white vases in his hands. “We can temporarily change their colour so we can get an idea of what will look best.”
