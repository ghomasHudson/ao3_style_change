“Is it a question?”
Harry swallowed. “Have you seen her?”
“She might come back to you yet,” Harry said, “but she’ll have to do it on her own.”
to find Tiering,” Harry protested.
Harry shifted beside him. Their upper arms pressed together casually and then Harry moved even closer, linking the fingers. The touch filled Draco with a reassuring sense of relief. He tried not to cling. For goodness sake, he didn’t know what was wrong with him tonight. He felt frayed and wound tight, wanting something he couldn’t name well enough to ask for.
! I can’t believe he progressed to fourth year. This school’s gone soft.”
“You have,” Dean agreed congenially, “You’ve been a right wanker about my Crups, and I’ll likely never let you forget we beat you out in the end. Unfortunately, Malfoy’s team will take the rec cup, and everybody knows it. It’s not a team he has, but a militia.”
“Well. Jamie has a later bedtime than Al, and Al has a later bedtime than me, because they are older. I think that I should get a later bedtime than Remy, but he stays up the latest, and I don’t think that’s fair. I've thought a lot about this, and I'm confident that once you see things from my point of view, you'll agree.”
Harry’s eyes traveled along the line of Malfoy’s wand and up his arm to his shoulder, his neck. The bruises were all but gone now, and Harry felt an unexpected twinge of loss. The marks had been evidence of the unnamed something suspended between them.
Reluctantly, Harry withdrew from his exploration of Malfoy’s left clavicle.
“Come sit with me,” he urged.
“That’s what I like out there, this is what I like in here. I cannot possibly be more clear. Please tell me you understand.”
any protective spells,” Ron remarked derisively.
“What the fuck weren’t you wearing your Aversion Amulet?” Draco asked him, but his body had relaxed again, apparently satisfied with Harry’s response. Harry’s hand drifted back around his waist.
"Then perhaps you could reduce your fee?" Draco suggested.
“Hard to say,” the healer said, “Usually a matter of minutes, we’ll have to wait and see.”
“What’s bothering you, pumpkin?” Harry asked.
“He doesn’t,” Jamie said sourly. “He only likes them now that Scor likes them and he wants to look cool.”
“I do my own things,” James assured him quickly, looking a little embarrassed.
“What? Oh! Merlin,” Potter commented, “where did you find that? Actually, I don’t care. Cheers.” He accepted the glass and took a sip, sighing.
Bingham beamed.

“Er, Harry,” it was Edward Lupin speaking this time, he sat back a bit from the table which gave him room to easily feed the baby. “I’d thought I might go visit Victoire and her family today. Should I reschedule?”
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Hermione said, “do you want to talk about it?”
“Later, Potter,” Draco said impatiently, unwilling to postpone their time alone for another solitary moment. He impatiently jerked Harry closer towards the mantle. “Come along.”
securely.
“I would say perhaps you honed some of his skills,” Draco corrected.
Harry knew Malfoy was a father, he’d seen the man act with parental affection towards Scorpius countless times in the short weeks since they’d renewed their acquaintance, but somehow he hadn’t ever thought of Scorpius as a baby, tiny and defenseless. Harry had certainly never thought of Malfoy looking like this: so at ease with the chubby baby in his arms, holding the bottle just so, unperturbed by the goings-on around him. He wasn’t harried or hassled like Harry always was while dealing with Remy and trying to keep track of the rest of his brood. No, Malfoy stood with endless patience and attentiveness, and the sweetness of it all twisted inside Harry, contorting into something like yearning.
Potter came home when Granger, Rose, Lily, and Draco were all packed into Lily’s room for a bedtime story. While initially a bit shy about it, Rose had given into Lily’s pestering, and agreed to re-enact a lively rendition of
Draco examined the other man. Potter was still a mess, his hair flattened to his skull on one side, and its typical gravity-defying shaggy mess on the other. He was wearing only boxer shorts and a faded Chudley Cannons T-shirt, and sleep was still crusting in the corner of one of his eyes. He looked a bit like an overgrown boy, not much changed by the years, except for taking up so much more space. Draco never felt like his own body had filled out quite as he expected it to, but Potter was bigger and broader in every sense. He wasn’t a bear of a man, not like Greg Goyle, but nevertheless his thick, exposed limbs looked intriguingly capable.  Draco had to look away, although he supposed it was pointless denying his attraction at this point, at least to himself.
“Oh!” Harry remarked, unsure exactly how to proceed, “Hey, what’s up, hm?” He coaxed, gently prying Malfoy back, trying to get a look at his face. Draco wouldn’t budge.
“Did you see that?” Ron asked, “Crookshanks thinks we should examine the workers!”
“I’m sure she will,” Hermione agreed.
“Breathe, please,” Harry instructed and he felt Draco take a long, rattling inhale.
Harry snorted. “Of course they are. Sorry, I should have known. I’ll take them back next weekend and get you something more reasonable. He means well, he just...”
“Do you have enough standard robes?” Draco asked James.
Harry was surprised that Draco stepped in, but he was not nearly as astonished as Ron appeared to be. Ron’s face was frozen in shock, mouth open around a bit of half-chewed beef. Harry couldn’t quite discern if the reaction was because Draco stood up for Rose, or because he’d scolded Al and Harry had let him. But as far as Harry could tell, Al deserved it, and, amazingly, even looked remorseful about disappointing a teacher Harry knew he respected. It was a much more earnest reaction than anything Harry could hope to elicit had he taken a similar tone.
“For you, maybe,” Malfoy countered, his voice a vicious hiss, “You’re always happy to sprint towards martyrdom, oblivious to those of us who have to witness it over and over again. Do you have any idea how helpless it makes me feel to watch you throw yourself on endless pyres? It’s such a fucking pattern for you. You’re not just risking yourself when you rush blindly in anymore, you must see that.”
“Why not?”
“How long does it last?” Draco said.
Draco gave a nod. “Get your trainers on, Tiering, time to get back.”
“Leave him alone, Lils,” Albus ordered her. The boy’s watchfulness made Draco smile inwardly. He transferred the toast onto the plate and passed it to Albus in exchange for a fresh slice of bread which Draco put over the flames.
“Are you alright?” Clark asked, expression anxious. “I knew you wouldn’t like it but I didn’t mean to, you know, make you upset like
“Yes, but
Harry considered the question. He was a little ashamed about his reaction to the Appleby dismissal, but Zerk seemed to think it was valid. “I...we talked about the fire, obviously. But, I’m still upset about quidditch. So we talked about that, too.”
Then he looked to Harry, who felt frozen to the spot.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said again, but Draco just shook his head.
“They are,” Draco agreed, “I'm certain we’re missing something.”
She nodded curtly, "Good," she said, standing, "I'll see you at dinner." Hermione walked away, Harry watching her, until he felt Draco reach for his hand.
“I wouldn’t presume to know anything concrete. All I’m familiar with is the mythology. How much of that actually comes from you is another matter entirely. ” Draco wasn’t sure he expected an answer. It was strange how much of the story he felt he knew, and how little of it seemed to have truly come from Potter. But by Draco’s mother’s accounts in her pathetic desperate letters all those years ago, according to the flurry of post-war articles, and more academic theoretical post-mortems, Potter was a Horcrux, and as such, something in him had to have died.
“Indeed,” McGonagall agreed, “but there are plenty who would not have been so selfless.”
had run an article Harry hadn’t seen farther back in the paper? What if they’d learned something terrible about Cwalu, that they couldn’t be defeated and Hogwarts was doomed? What if Draco had been beaten again, or or hexed in the hallways? Harry tentatively reached his magic out, like Madam Pomfrey had shown him in the infirmary that night. He scanned Draco’s bones, extended beyond that to his tendons and muscles, whatever he could picture from long ago biology textbooks. If he could just find an injury, find the hurt, perhaps he could fix it, fill it, make it whole.
“I swear I'll keep him safe,” Harry said, trying to keep his anger from rising like bile, to keep from grabbing Clark’s hand and making a run for it.
“Yes, but he’s
“Attended a lot of cocktail parties, have we, Potter?”
Draco whimpered.
He turned to storm off but Harry called out after him, “Malfoy, wait. Stop, Draco, please.”
Harry was still a bit high on leftover victory the following morning. They’d beaten the damn Pygmy Puffs, they’d won their final game, the last one he’d ever coach, and Clark had scored his first ever goal. The team had gathered in the great hall in celebration afterwards, drinking butterbeer and eating biscuits and recounting the drama of the game. David Clayburne and Claire Gibbens re-enacted the beaters’ row about six times, heightening the drama and ansurdity with every re-telling until the lot of them were cackling with laughter.
“You should play quidditch,” Draco said, simply, “I’ve never seen you like this, so chuffed, effusive. Looks good on you. They’ll choose you, and if they don’t, someone else will, I've no doubt.”
There are likely only about two chapters left in this fic before I move onto the sequel, which will pick up exactly where this story leaves off and focus on Harry's first year teaching at Hogwarts. I think it will probably be told through four perspectives: Harry, Draco, James and Scorpius, and is definitely a lot more plot-heavy than this one (and will move at a less glacial pace!). Anyway, I'm excited to write it and am so hoping you will like it, too!
“Hm,” Draco acknowledged warily.
Draco started rattling off names of magic schools Harry had never even heard of, but Tanya just started looking overwhelmed, so Harry put a hand on his forearm to get him to leave off.
“I believe so, yes,” Draco confirmed.
“There’s no good answer, here, Harry," Hermione said, attempting to placate him. "I’m sorry for assuming you’d go off and tackle this on your own. You’re right, we should know you better than that, and believe that you’ll ask for help when you can and when you need to. I can just also empathise with Draco, and I know Ron can, too. We thought we’d lost you once. We don’t want to go through that again. Surely you can understand that.”
be easier. We could just hide away in Grimmauld Place, go to work at dull jobs, and fly over London only once it's dark, until everyone forgets we ever existed.”
“Do you think it worked? You don’t think at the next full moon she’ll just rise up again?”
“Oh please don’t, Malfoy, he barely comes near me any more,” she pleaded.
“Well, your dad’s just making you some toast with almond butter and then you can go back to sleep, how’s that?”
“Blink if the quidditch trial involved riding a broomstick,” George whispered conspiratorially.
“Seems to be doing the job. Haven’t heard anything since that day at the quidditch pitch.”
“I’ll be the only one locking you in basements, thanks very much,” he promised.
“Arms full of what?” Albus queried.
“Why don’t you tell me what it is, so I can reassure you properly?”
is a hotbed for half-truths, gossip, and fabrications.”
Clark jumped at the voice, looking towards the doorway where Jared stood in relief against the candlelight flickering behind him. His little hands were on his hips and he looked quite cross.
Harry leant back against the bed. He didn’t have to say a word, Draco simply came to him, making short work of his flies and swallowing Harry’s cock without preamble. It was like nothing Harry had ever experienced: the eager heat and the nimble tongue that seemed to crave him.
“Will you answer me honestly?”
“Then what?” Draco prompted softly.
“Aren’t you?” Granger scoffed. “Seems like our so-called
A lot of things happened at once. Draco issued a
Harry plopped himself down on a loveseat with Draco pressing in close beside him a moment later. Malfoy had barely left his side since the evening prior. Despite the looks of angry disgust fired at him by Ron, Harry found he didn’t mind. He liked knowing his presence gave Draco some measure of comfort. Hermione, a strained expression on her face, led Ron to an ancient chesterfield some ways away. He was gripping her hand tightly.
Then, resounding in his own head, Harry heard the words, the sweet, affected voice of Lavender Brown: “Hello, Harry, so very pleasant to chat with you again.”
“I’ll be better. I mean it,” Al declared, matching Scorpius’ volume. “I know you don’t like fighting.”
“I believe so, yes,” Draco divulged. “He seemed surprised by it, at any rate.”
“I think—I think you’d make a top rate healer. I mean, at least the medicine bits. You could probably stand to be a bit nicer.”
“What is it?” He said, wiping his chin absently.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. “Won’t last. But got the bills paid and sorted through at least half my correspondence.”
“It’s not,” Father retorted sharply, then sighed. “I’m sorry, dearest. It really isn’t your fault; I should have been more cognisant of the hour.”
“Oh my God,” Clark moaned in horror, pressing his fingers into closed eyes as though he could unsee the entire event. “You think I had a fucking wet dream? Worse you think I had to be told about wet dreams? I live most of the year in a boys’ fucking dormitory, I know about bloody wet dreams, thanks!”
Harry rubbed a hand across his forehead, digging into the tense muscles above his eyebrows. “Yeah,” he relented, unconvinced. “I guess you could be right, I don’t know.”
Draco rose, hand not leaving Harry’s back. When he spoke, his voice was ice cold and fierce. “Unfortunately, there is a well-established pattern of people putting their grand causes before Harry’s wellbeing. Even people who purport to care for him. Tanya's just added her name to a thoughtless, cruel list.”
and the howler burst into flames. Harry was blushing fuchsia and the whole lot of them were a frazzled mess.
The child collapsed onto the rug, motionless.
He heard Draco call out the counterspell almost immediately, and suddenly Harry was inside.
“Uh, hi?” He said. The kid was gangly, with a safety pin shoved through his ear and shimmering eyeliner lining his lower lid. He looked like a child in the costume of a teenager and it was an uncanny disparity. He also had that defiant chin tilt that reminded Harry so much of Malfoy.
“No,” Draco responded simply, facing Harry with a bold kind of clarity. “I’m keenly aware that the decisions I made then directly informed all that followed.”
“His aunt Daphne should be returning home from her holidays any day now. I could probably arrange for her to look after him for an evening.”
Draco nodded, eyes cast down at their joined hands. "I know. Stuff his approval. It's worthless. He's worthless. I was a fool for wanting it."
Clark looked torn. “And if I want to fight to make things better?”
Draco didn’t know why the words caught him off guard. “Oh. For your mum?”
“So he said something daft and you took it to heart and then ratcheted it up a few degrees, sounds like,” Ron said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco snorted, but gave Harry another kiss. “I saw you dash into the damn flames through a pinhole, Potter. Do
“Alright,” Harry gave in, “I'll meet you here before Defense and we can all go together.”
Draco huffed to show he was not interested in hearing more of Potter’s opinion on his particular flaws, but Harry ignored him, instead lazily thrusting his thumb in and out of Draco’s compliant mouth.
Draco only scoffed. “I've got you in my bed every night. You’d do anything I ask, and we’ve all but adopted an eleven-year-old. I’m hardly insecure in our relationship.”
“The war,” Draco said simply. His eyes were emotionless, fixed on Harry.
Harry was afraid to look. He turned his head. Ron. Arms crossed, storm clouds quickly gathering on his face, an indignant jut to his chin.
“Have you ever been to a carnival, Scor?” he asked.
While perhaps a few years older than Draco, Rudá’s lifestyle made him a pleasure to watch and to touch. The man never seemed to wear a shirt, opting for well-worn linen shorts, or, on particularly hot days, a flowing turquoise garment which covered very little. He was not tall, but he was well built, muscles shaped by long years of navigating the landscape. Much of his skin was decorated with starkly lined tattoos, and more often than not, he had a lip full of tobacco.  No matter the weather, he wore the same grubby trainers, hopping over stones and making a show of always having to wait for Draco to catch up. Draco found he didn’t mind the teasing, and they spent evenings under the stars, Rudá telling him the legends of his people, a small enclave of witches and wizards who’d magicked their homeland invisible with the coming of the Portuguese.
“Very refreshing,” Draco replied.
“Well,” she repeated, “well, wow. Like...just wow.”
“I can’t tell you that.”
“Draco has that effect on people,” Harry agreed with a gentle chuckle, “but so long as you’re trying, he’s truly not thinking ill of you. Besides, he can’t see or judge what’s inside your head. So you can put that fear away, yeah?”
Jared thought about it some more. Not-Gran’s biscuits
“Lily, are you pestering Professor Malfoy when you’re supposed to be helping?”
“His dad puts strong wards up at night. I’m beginning to think they are specifically in place to keep me out, because I’ve tried plenty." An idea caught Al then, because he scrambled eagerly into a seated position. "Hey, will you teach me to Apparate?”
“I would think that would make him sad, not angry,” Scorpius pondered.
“Just...not turning your back on this. Not yet.”
“Very well,” Draco sighed. “I am, then, I’m sorry. Sometimes I just need to mull things over, and I don’t want to drag you into it when I’ve not yet reached a resolution. No one’s ill, no one’s injured. Nothing between us is changing, I assure you. I’m sorry, I didn’t think you’d catch on and I don’t want to be secretive, I just...need a day or two. If that’s alright.” Draco felt a weird note of panic. Were they going to have a row? Because what would he do if Harry pushed him on this? Draco really didn’t want him to, ever since he’d left the Death Eaters, any sort of pressure to obey outside of sex put his back right up, and he was certain he’d become resentful if Harry wouldn’t respect his wishes.
“Sorry, mate” Ron shrugged.
“Has this...happened before?” Draco ventures, setting the teacup on a saucer and sliding it towards Clark, a biscuit balanced on the lip of the little plate.
“You gave me a lecture on stinging nettles,” Scorpius sighed. “Even though school is not supposed to begin for three more days.”
“Like war stuff," Jamie's voice lowered conspiratorially, "I saw his Dark Mark and I asked if he could tell me about it. He said he doesn’t believe in coddling children when it comes to history, lest they be doomed to repeat it, so he’d answer any questions I had!”
“What’re you talking about?” Scorpius entreated. Harry and Draco ignored him.
“Why, because they’re true?” Fife countered.
“That sounds lovely. I’m glad that the weather is holding up,” Mum agreed pleasantly.
Harry blinked blearily, feeling nauseous, jittery.
“Maybe don’t talk about what you don’t understand,” Draco replied, icily. “That way you might actually shut up for once.” His hand swept over Harry’s arm to land on the small of his back, coaxing him away. “Come,” he said. “We’ll just have to keep looking.”
For a moment Harry thought to turn down the boy’s generosity. After all, it was Teddy’s holiday, and he only had a month off before he’d head back to Germany to continue his magical language studies. But Harry was dead on his feet, with another month of four kids at home facing him, so he accepted the reprieve gratefully.
“Yeah, yeah,” Jamie muttered. “Hand-me-downs, like always.”
With a filthy noise, Draco released Harry, then pressed his forehead into his thigh. Harry continued to pet him adoringly.
“Then there is no but here, you ridiculous Gryffindor. Why on earth would I want you to feign interest in things you don’t care a jot about? So long as you don’t disparage me for my interests, which you never have, then it hardly bothers me.”
“But you won’t be here next year,” Clark muttered, yanking tight the drawstrings on the bag of stones and slinging it over his shoulder.
“It’s easy for us to say he shouldn’t have done what he did, should have left his family to rot or worse,” Harry went on, “but if you’d had to choose between saving Hermione and, say, some professor you never really liked, that night at the manor? No one would’ve blamed you for picking Hermione. Hell, I would’ve picked Hermione, if push came to shove. There’s no winners in fucked up dilemmas like that. But even with those stakes, Draco was defiant in what furtive ways he could. He lied for us at the manor. He tried to stop Crabbe from killing me. It's not much, but it's not nothing. He's not a murderer, he never took a life. Which is technically more than I can, really.”
“Certainly not,” Draco promised. “I’ve no interest in outliving my child.”
“And pudding?” Lily prompted.
“He’s your friend,” Harry reminded him.
“Right,” Potter said dazedly. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to nod off there.”
Thank you all so so much for reading and especially to folks who took the time to comment. You are the actual best!!!
Draco knew there was very little he could say that wouldn’t cause a row, and he knew that his mum’s intentions were nothing but pure.
Harry rolled his eyes, "Thanks for that, Malf—"
Harry brought Draco’s hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles in a silent apology. “Thank you for coming tonight,” he said earnestly. “It is nice to, you know, be here with you.”
“Apologies,” Draco murmured, striving for the appearance of normalcy. “I didn’t mean to wake you.”
Harry nodded. “With the Dursleys I had next to none. Then there was the prophecy and Voldemort to contend with. It was like I was an instrument and never just a person. A means to an end.”
Harry broke away from Draco and turned to find Ron, flame-red and shifting uncomfortably in the doorway.

Harry pursed his lips, but Malfoy had been surprisingly open, so Harry reckoned the least he could do was return the favour.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry said. “I should have told you, it’s just, well, nevermind. Gin’s left. Said she’d had enough and took off.”
“Right,” Harry swallowed. “Well. Thank you.”
“Dad?” Al queried, sounding bewildered. “Professor? What are you doing?”
Ron was having a difficult time dealing with Harry’s decision to turn down the Appleby Arrows.
“But that’s the thing, now, isn’t it?” Harry urged. “You seemed fine, so I assumed you were. And yet Gin seemed happy enough too, and it’s only now I’m realising that I missed probably 99% of her hints. And so I find myself completely doubting whether or not I can correctly, you know, read the room, or what have you. Like, what if you’re pissed and I simply have no idea?”
Clark shook his head. “She might, and I know I probably should, but I think I would rather not? I know it’s not her fault, that she needs routine to take care of Jared, but I’m still kind of, like, hurt. And mad, maybe. I don’t want to see her and dump that on her, it will only make her feel worse.”
Harry wasn’t an idiot. He knew he ought to have warned Ron and Hermione that Draco was planning on attending their annual end-of-summer meal. The issue was this: Harry wasn’t convinced that Draco truly would come, not really. And the only thing worse than breaking the news that he and their old enemy were now quite friendly, was being stood up by him. So Harry hadn’t spoken it aloud, just in case he jinxed it.
“Hey, Dean?” He said suddenly, “Maybe we should make a couple of quidditch teams anyway? Not for the cup or anything, but would be good to play, you know?”
Without warning, Draco was dumped unceremoniously off Harry’s lap. He scrambled to his knees, looking up at Harry with indignation.
Father's smile deepened a little and he nodded and slipped out of the room.
“No, Fife, you absolute muttonhead. Because they’re ignorant and they make no one want to be your friend!” Scorpius informed him sharply.
“Uergh,” Clark cringed, turning and striding towards the castle.
“Too much, love?” Harry asked.
“I know,” Neville sighed, “And likely wait a fucking decade while she determines she not missing anything at home. Maybe we are wrong for each other. She’s so adventurous and I’d like nothing more than a quiet house with a nice garden to putter about in.”
” he repeated, “The essence for enemies or coworkers? Not a chance I’m willing to take. Here, hold still.”
it open.
“You did what?” Demanded Malfoy.
“What were you going to do with him?” Lily demanded, her eyes bright and her little chin jutting out protectively.
“Eyes up, please,” Harry corrected him, “and answer my question.”
Harry wriggled uncomfortably. “Leave it, would you? It was a lifetime ago.”
He froze. He needed the charm to end the fiendfyre. It was a charm he knew, one he'd made damn well sure he knew now, but he all he could see was Draco’s terrified face strangely superimposed on Clark’s, swimming in his mind. Harry was paralyzed, and his inaction would leave them both to this hideous fate and he would be alone to sweep up nothing but ashes. He blinked in the blackened air and suddenly he was flying again, but Draco’s fingers were slipping from his hand and he was falling into the fire, falling infinitely. Smoke was billowing around him and Harry's eyes were watering as crackles and snapping beams sounded loud and vicious in his ears.
“Just like this,” Harry instructed. “Good.”
“Oh sweetheart,” Harry protested, stepping forward. “Merlin, don’t you see? I did all that so one day you could have exactly this. Quidditch and your studies are the only concerns I could possibly ever want for you.” He paused to find the words to explain. “I had a wretched childhood, Jamie, love. Truly. I’m not saying that to make you feel sorry for me, just as I didn’t tell you about the war to somehow leave you feeling unaccomplished. What matters to me is you being happy, you never questioning that there are veritable scores of people to watch out for you and guide you and protect you—I didn’t know you and your siblings were who I was fighting for at the time, but I know it now, and it was worth every sacrifice. I want you to have a proper childhood. I know it’s different with your mother gone, and I’m not asking you to not be sad about that, but I want you to grow up loved and safe and fulfilled. Please let me give you that. Or let me try. ”

“It’s like...you know. A thing. In a place,” Fort attempted. “Oh, toss it. Fine. So I’m pants at the details, happy?”
“It’s not a comic book, it’s a graphic novel, and Uncle George only just sent it. You probably took it out of spite, because you are treacherous little snake, and you always have been, Slytherin piece of—”
“I’ve got it handled, love, truly,” Harry said gratefully as Teddy helped prepare dinner. Remy was kicking happily on his playmat near the table. “You looked like you’ve had a bit of a week.”
His thumbs skimmed Harry's skin and he left feather-light kisses along the planes of Harry's face.
, you’ve got to be joking. That’s five whole syllables, Jamie. If he wanted me to call him by a new name, he ought to have chosen one I would bother with. He knows how lazy I am.”
with a careful twitch of his wand to make the charm stick.
“Certainly not,” Draco promised. “I’ve been a professor at Hogwarts for a great many years now, Miss Granger-Weasley, and I’ve not raised a wand to a student in anger even once in that time, and I don’t intend to.”
“Do you want me to come with you?” Harry blurted out the question before he could stop and consider it. His need to soothe his child overshadowed all rational considerations.
Draco hesitantly complied.
Draco pictured Potter leaning over a cluttered desk with family photos and stacks of parchment, the tip of his quill brushing his lip as he dotted his i’s. It was a pleasant image.
“Now,” Harry commanded.
Harry couldn’t muster the energy.
“Hm,” Draco considered. “Very well, I’ll humour you both.”
“I don’t know what you want,” he choked out, closing his eyes. He felt Draco’s hands leave his collar to gently curl around the sides of his neck. Harry was such a mess of want and fury, he couldn’t make sense of it.
So, with one last glance at the stars, he made his way to the dungeons.
Ginny rolled her eyes, “Merlin, Harry, you really are dense. You think we did this for you?” She was more amused than irritated. “You’re not our commander, you know. We are all students here. We all care what happens. You were busy. If we needed help, we would have asked for it. We’re all perfectly aware you had your own business—” at this, she cocked her head towards Malfoy, still propped nonchalantly against the wall at the back of the room, “to attend to. We needed you to be a figurehead just now, and you were. Duties managed.”
“That’s rotten,” Franklin decided, giving Scorpius a companionably, yet slightly too-hearty thwack on the back. “I hope there are no animals at this one. Seems cruel.”
“I, er,” he swallowed, helpless. “I need to fix Remy a bottle.”
Clark was completely unable to establish a defense this time. Clark’s mother was on her knees, her arms wrapped tightly around Clark's middle, sobbing into his chest, pouring out apologies. Clark was trying to shove her away—
“I have no idea what those are,” Draco informed him.
He took a breath and focused on Ilka’s instructions: be clear, don’t beat around anything, don’t leave room for doubt.
“It’s just what you have to say,” Harry explained sheepishly, “look.”
Draco ushered the children into the Leaky Cauldron. “Find us a table, will you, James? Scorpius, Albus, come help me with the drinks.”
Jamie shrugged and grinned. “Yeah, but I need to be involved in stuff like this if I want a shot at being a prefect, and you’re not interested in that, anyway, since it involves, you know, people.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, that...thing won’t hold back,” Clark argued. “It’s not much good for me to be able to defend a half-strength attack. Just try me, Harry. I’m ready, I can feel it.”
“I’m not trying to be withholding,” Draco attempted.
“I should like to know you would defend me from a Basilisk,” Lily insisted. “At least until I’m bigger and know magic and can take care of it myself.”
Draco wondered if he’d be around to see that, and found that he rather hoped he would be.
“If you pursue potions,” Draco began.
“In the mudroom, on the big brass hook!” shouted Teddy from the drawing room. “And Harry, I’m off, if you don’t need anything else.”
A silence followed, then an over-loud “No!”
“Yeah, got it,” Harry grinned, “Oh, I talked to Clark, think he’s alright, after all that happened on Tuesday. Think some students were giving him a hard time in the autumn, but it seems to have slowed down, now. He’s settling in.”
The woman was wearing nothing but a scarlet chemise that clung to her abundant curves.
“Hello, my darling,” she murmured. “No Harry?”
“I never liked him,” Draco corrected. “He was not a man a person could like. He was simply someone they could fear.”
“It’s a pain response, nothing more,” Draco insisted. “Don’t you fucking stop.”
“Didn’t you know?”
“And you know we have plenty,” Draco responded, “Stop fussing. I won’t hear any more about it.”
“No,” Al said. “I...you know
“Harry?” He opened his eyes and turned his head at Hermione’s voice. She was standing between Ron and Draco at the entrance that led towards the great hall. “What are you doing here?”
“Was your uncle getting on your nerves?”
“Only joking,” Ron backtracked, “Just feels like that sometimes.”
“So,” Harry echoed, tossing his hair off his forehead and petting Fawkes some more.
“Of course I do,” Pansy assured him. “Now, usually I have to do a great deal of wheedling and imploring to earn the pleasure of your company, so something must be going on. Something delicious, I hope. Tell Auntie Pansy all about it.”
Zerk was clearly amused. “I don’t celebrate Easter, for one.” He said, “For another, I’m not married, I don’t have children, and my parents are on holiday. You’re not interrupting anything important, and as I’ve said before, if you were, I would simply say that. So, why don’t we sit down and chat and you can tell me all about whatever suddenly-pertinent-trivial thing is on your mind.”
“That’s brilliant!” Ron agreed, “Now, we need your input on this—yours too, Malfoy. Alright, so the last couple quidditch games have been fun.”
Draco rose, not to follow the other man, but to do
“So, the worst that will happen is she’ll pop in for a visit and he’ll kick her out and come find us.”
“Harry Potter!” She exclaimed, her wan face brightening. “Goodness, look at you, all grown up.” She gave him something that might have been described as a leer that Harry couldn't say he liked at all.
“That’s very kind,” Scorpius told him. Then, just because he was feeling spiteful, and wanted to make the smarmy arsehole uncomfortable, he added: “But it is highly unlikely.”
“Morning, sweetheart,” Harry corrected, agreeably. “Did you, though? I know Dudley did, but I can’t remember how long they went. I’m trying to sort out when I should go collect Clark."
“I’ve done something,” he admitted. “You’ll not be happy.”
Hermione smiled, shaking her head, “Perhaps one day, you two will be able to have a sincere conversation without aid from Ogden’s finest, but I suppose I shouldn’t count on it.”
“Do you think you can do that for me?”
were you there, even? Were you tracking me again, like you used to?”
to be around the Quidditch pitch when Hufflepuff was having their practice.”
A note from the editor followed the text, remarking on Harry's courage and philanthropy. It barely made mention of the Malfoys at all, as if the charity had been entirely Harry's idea. To be fair, he supposed, it was actually Hermione's, and she wasn't exactly getting any credit, either.
Draco took a step closer, and the floor creaked underfoot. Harry stirred.
“That’s about the long and the short of it,” Ron agreed, “Thought I suspect the first led to the second.”
“Are you hurt?” Harry asked, kneeling in front of the dark-haired boy, who now had a pretty impressive grass stain across one cheek and a stunned expression.
“That should work, yeah. And I understand you like off-campus faculty to be geographically close, should the Floo system become compromised, but I might be back and forth the first few weekends until Lily, the baby and I are settled.”
“I…” Harry tried to swallow, but it didn’t work. His throat was thick and tears were imminent, the first he’d allowed himself since Ginny had left. “I don’t want you all to see me like this.”
Crookshanks hopped off the map and lumbered towards the fire. Harry folded up and pocketed the parchment and Draco reclaimed his seat.
“At dinner, the person who came up to you. Were they in on it, too?”
“Does it?” Pansy fired back.
CWs: references to canon-typical violence, Hegwig's death, animals in cages, canon-typical ableist-language.
“Dad?” Albus stood at the door. He scratched the ankle of one foot with the toes of his other, eying Draco nervously. “Did you tell him?”
Harry sighed, "I'd lose him, because it would mean everything between us is a lie. I'd be fucking devastated and he'd be laughing."
The words seemed to have struck the right chord, thankfully, because Malfoy whined lowly and thrust forward into Harry’s fist. Harry squeezed the cock again, adjusting to the phenomenon of holding someone else’s prick.
“Like I said,” Neville explained, “not super useful. He’s been here so often and so long, so his imprints are all over the place." Harry could see what he meant. In many places, the paths were so well tread that they were more smears of gold than individual prints. "But we could send groups to follow where they lead? Mark off the ones we have checked? The more recent ones are a slightly brighter hue, so that might help, too."
Draco gave his usual hum of agreement and strode out of the drawing room.
“What’s sinister?” Jared interrupted.
A few minutes later, Harry sat down with his tea at the table near the window and opened his potions textbook to review for Monday’s lesson—something he had been doing more often lately, at Draco’s decree. He couldn’t concentrate. He just kept looking from the entrance to the window, watching the workers hoist blocks, transfigure rubble, discuss plans. They’d recently finished the central tower and were moving on to the astronomy tower. Soon, all that would be left to fix was the seventh floor corridor, but Harry knew that would never be the same. The room of requirement was gone forever.
Harry leaned forward, bracing himself and slipping the head of his cock between Malfoy’s lips, holding there for a moment before sliding deeper. He teased the back of Malfoy’s throat, a slight gag and then Draco swallowed, opening, Harry’s cock sliding deeper. Harry groaned, maybe more at the act than at the actual sensation. The way Draco endured, how much he wanted to make it good for Harry, sucking and tonguing at his cock. The way he strained upwards, taking more, letting Harry fuck his throat. He clung to Harry’s thighs as he worked and Harry thrusted, taking what he wanted, hearing Draco's sloppy desperate noises as he did what he was asked, so beautifully compliant.  All at once, as if from just the thought of it, Harry came.
Harry made a face. “Listen to yourself, you absolute creep.”
“Oh?” Draco prompted, then Harry blushed scarlet at the implication. It was
“So let’s not get ahead of ourselves, how about? Besides, you think if something terrible happens, Potter and I wouldn’t come for you immediately?”
“Did you kill them?” Jamie inquired, trying not to think about the ugly, spiny little beasts he’d seen pictures of in Lily’s storybooks.
Harry grinned ruefully, “Motivational naming. I think she’ll come round. How about you, Clark, have you settled on a name?”
“Think about it,” Ron continued. “Who did we know who has, er, big feelings, was staunchly on our side during the war, and was murdered by a bloody werewolf?”
“Yes, that sounds about right,” Draco agreed.
“I know,” Draco crooned, voice pitched low. “I know, dearest, I’m sorry to have scared you like that. He wouldn’t have, though,” he assured him, not fully knowing the truth of his words. Had Draco raised his wand against Albus, what Potter might have done was anyone’s guess. “He acted just as I would have, had he attempted such a thing with you.”
“Not an easy task you’ve set yourself, Mr. Potter.”
“I...you know I am sorry, Malfoy,” Harry murmured, “I was stupid, rash. I shouldn't have— ”
Harry blinked. “You just told her to leave? Myrtle, do you know Occlumency?”
Draco looked at him like he was Christmas come early, “Harry, I think that’s the most perfect thing you’ve ever said to me.”
“Never,” Pansy exclaimed. “I don’t let men dictate my vocabulary.”
“Yeah, but I could stand to be more interested in those things. If you wanted.”
Hermione looked ready to chastise him but Harry gave a watery grin and chuckled.
“I have no idea what a Mont Blanc is, either,” Harry admitted. “You must have done a lot of traveling.”
“Yeah, well, we knew we had you and Jared to look out for, didn’t we?” Harry asked.
Clark shrugged noncommittally, “Who are you even, some school counselor? "
“Oh!” Scorpius was surprised and a little ashamed. He’d not even thought of that, but of course that was it. Scorpius’
Ginny only tossed her head. “Homicide isn’t Hermione’s style,” she exclaimed, misunderstanding Ron’s meaning, “Her revenge would be much more mentally painful and emotionally exacting.”
“Ah, and you like being of use, is that it?” Harry questioned.
“No,” Draco replied breathily, “I’m sorry.”
Ron was thrilled, well and truly thrilled and Harry felt like an arse for expecting anything less. Ron hooted and clapped him on the back and told the whole bloody common room.
“Potter, why is your elf in the bedroom?” He demanded, unhappily.
Under the table Malfoy squeezed Harry’s leg. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever be tired of that warm, easy affection. He pressed into Draco’s side and Draco pressed back. That didn’t get old, either. Not for the first time, Harry wished he could sling an arm around Draco’s shoulders or snog him right there at the breakfast table. Sometimes he wanted it so badly, he thought he might cave. Only Draco’s warning eyes stopped him; you can’t rush this, Potter, they seemed to say,  wreck your future for my sake and I’ll be quite cross.
“Potter, a word,” Malfoy’s voice was firm, summoning him from the end of the aisle.
“Did you have slumber parties as a kid?” Harry asked Sunday morning, while Draco thumbed through
Harry reached out, pressed his palm to Malfoy’s shoulder blade. He felt an instinctive, momentary flinch.
Harry felt his confidence grow. This, at least, he had spent evenings practicing with Rivers and Brocklehurst.  Harry floated his
“There’s one in the dungeons that Draco’s taken his group to, another in the study below the Ravenclaw dorms, and then history of magic classroom—" Hermione cut herself of, looking very much like she'd been struck by a bolt of lightning: her mouth agape and her eyes wide, a hand flying up to cup her forehead "Oh, Merlin, it's so obvious! The ghosts, Harry!”
“You would do well not to let your love life interfere with your studies, Mr. Potter!” Ron exclaimed in an exaggerated Scottish brogue, “Which do you think will keep you warm in your old age? A mortal partner, or your ability to conjure flames where there is naught but ice!”
“You ought to keep better track of your pets, Harry,” she sneered, shepherding an anxious-looking Slytherin girl into a booth.
“Potter, you think if I could have found a spell to heal my son, I wouldn’t have tried it?” Draco felt irritation at the mere implication of neglect.
“Must I remind you that I was, in fact, right to stalk you? You were actively trying to kill our headmaster, after all.”
“Even when I fucking lie and hide and then have to do detention in the greenhouse for a million hours?” Clark grumbled quietly, dipping his head to study his trainers.
She looked to the window, her translucent form reflecting sunlight like the surface of a lake. “Leave me now, Harry Potter. I must think on such things.”
"Professor—" Hermione raised a hand and the instructor waved for her to continue, "I thought apparition of any sort wasn't possible within Hogwarts."
Thanks for the kudos and comments!!!!
“I had a lie down,” Teddy assured him. “I’m fine. And it was a nice week, Harry, stop worrying. Molly was over the moon to see the kids. Percy’s high strung as ever, but Ralph adores him, and he's so soothing and attentive. Their two are old enough now to find Lily precious instead of annoying, and Mols was even giving Jamie Quidditch tips...at least while he was still speaking to all of us.”
Through the wall, Draco heard the clamorous questioning begin as soon as Harry came within view of the children:
“Draco does, apparently,” Harry muttered.
“Do you like being bound?” asked Harry, drinking him in.
Thanks to everyone who stopped by, especially folks who left a comment. You are so wonderful and kind!!! Sorry this is so late, I lost power for like 6 hours yesterday, it was very inconvenient!
“Understood. I can wait until tomorrow. I’ll stay with Clark.”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco interrupted her, voice chilled. Pansy was circling too close to something aching and undefined within him, and Draco desperately wanted to leave it untouched and unexamined. “I’m not a frightened child anymore. I don’t depend on the praise and validation of others, at least I certainly hope I don’t."
“And what have I to do with the matter?” Draco asked.
"I feel...manipulative," Harry sighed, "I don't fancy us having to concoct story after story like this."
. Have you checked out her stories yet? You should!
“Oh you’re not leaving, are you? Please stay, Harry, it’s been ever so long. You used to keep me company, once.”
“Oh, ah, It’s no problem,” Harry gulped.
“Plus I had this ridiculous romantic notion that if I could just make you mad enough, you’d hold me down and snog me senseless,” Malfoy shrugged.
Tonight, though, Al was with Scorpius’ dad and Harry, trying to work out counterspells for
“Clark Tiering,” Harry said, “he’s in your year, yeah?”
“That’s it?”
avoiding in future.”
“What? Draco, come on, this is—”
“Alright?” Harry asked, rolling onto his side so they were face to face. It seemed he’d not been sleeping, after all.
Major thank you to everyone who read and commented on the last chapter (and previous chapters). EVERY ONE IS A JOY TO ME. (Y'all seen the confused anime butterfly dude meme? "Comments on my fanfic/Is this serotonin?" 100% me, I screamed when I saw it). Okay, you're all great byyyyye 🖤.
“I’m sure you won’t,” McGonagall agreed, “Well, I think that was most of my communique. No word from Tiering about repeat incidents? How’s Mr. Malfoy keeping?”
“I know that,” Draco said, “But it wasn't enough for him. He wanted freedom for himself, a return to his comfortable life, social and political power. I knew exactly what he wanted and how he intended for me to go about getting it for him, via your standing. I had very little confidence I could ever convince you to speak for him, or that I would even ask you to, but his plan felt like a promising strategy for what I wanted. So I adapted it. He didn’t need to know my motivations, I let him think what served him, or at least I didn't correct his assumptions.”
“No, not really. I’m used to being without her.” The kid brought his bare feet up to rest the soles against the side of the bed. Colour rose in his cheeks. “For this place, I guess. You and Harry were around last year. I knew if something terrible happened it would be okay; you’d sort it.”
“Am I?” Malfoy asked, unperturbed.
“Ah,” Draco responded, “Alright, glad I don’t need to explain that, at least.”
To Harry’s surprise, Zerk laughed. It was a rich laugh, deep, appreciative and a little contagious. Harry felt himself returning it with a little grin.
“Better,” Harry said. “Now ask for what you want, baby, and I’ll decide if you can have it.”
CW: some discussion of sex, kink, and sexuality.
“Yeah. Whoa,” agreed the witch.
“Well spotted, Granger.”
Harry wondered if he should be more defensive on Jamie’s behalf, but at this point he was just so pleased that
“No,” Harry agreed fondly, “there really isn’t.”
"Oh, shut up," he glowered.
“Yes,” Scorpius replied, refusing to provide any more information.
“Besides,” Draco continued, his voice tinged with a teasing exasperation, “knowing you, even as a professional athlete, you’ll start another community outreach for penniless orphans, take in fourscore strays, and give myriad public speeches which bolster the spirits of the mourning. Everyone who glimpses you will want to be just a fraction as noble, and good, and true as you are.”
“Please settle,” she said, stepping forward, rasping voice barely audible among the chatter. The class stilled almost immediately.
“Mum,” Draco sighed. “He’s seven.”
“It means bad,” Clark told him, keeping his sharp eyes fixed on Draco. It looked as though another difficult conversation was on the horizon. Draco never knew all that he ought to tell the kids about the war. He tried to be as truthful as possible, but he hadn’t wanted to give Jared nightmares about the place, so details when it came to the Manor had been a bit sparse.
Draco watched him with a soft smile.
, Harry prompted gently, from inside Clark’s pink head.
“I think if that is all the evil you’re using his privilege for, your scruples remain fully intact. We’ll be there,” Draco decided, “but Harry, I’m dressing you.” He glanced beside him to Ron, “And you, Weasley.”
Draco forced himself to a standing position, relying overmuch on the side table to support him. His stomach lurched threateningly.
“It was a dream,” he muttered.
“No,” Harry heard himself interrupt her, “he’ll be staying with me.”
“What do you mean?” Harry pressed.
“Look,” Harry said, gently, “Leave her a note, say you were here and you’re going to spend the night at a friend’s. You can call her in the morning. I’m sure there’s a telephone box near my place. You can come stay with us. I’ve got plenty of space.”
“Yeah, but I could have tried harder!” Harry insisted.
“Very well,” Draco said. “What is it?”
Clark rolled his eyes. “Yeah, but think of it, Gran will want to see you, and she’ll probably have biscuits.”
Oh gosh, thanks to everyone for the utterly life-affirming comments on the last chapter, you are too wonderful by half!
Harry winced, thinking about the scar that sliced across Malfoy's chest. He'd seen it more than once, now that they shared dormitory showers.
“Dad!” Al cried, when Harry stepped out of the fireplace. “Jamie says he’s still reading the latest issue of
“Ah, right, guess you were around for a lot of Christmas holidays. Oh, these are my friends, Draco and Clark.”
Scorpius stood there stupidly for a moment. He supposed the proper thing to do would be to put the Invisibility Cloak back into the closet and go find his dad, but a treacherous plan niggled at him. If he knew what Father was thinking, then maybe he could strategise a bit: come up with some counterarguments to plead his case. Not that Father would likely budge—once he’d arrived at a conclusion, there was rarely anything Scorpius could do to sway him—but Scorpius ought to at least try, or Al would be
Harry swallowed and Malfoy’s hand extended suddenly, hovering hesitantly in the air besides Harry’s cheek. Harry thought it was the first time since they were boys that he’d seen Malfoy demonstrate even a moment’s uncertainty. The period of indecision belied the man’s typical sharp competence. Harry found it oddly reassuring to discover a crack in the veneer.
Draco rolled his eyes, “It’s a bit much,” he stated, then stepped in neatly, and in front of anyone who cared to see, planted a brief, firm kiss on Harry’s mouth. “Hello, darling.”
Molly looked up to say something in return, but then caught sight of Draco and Scorpius. Her brow wrinkled in concern. “Oh! Professor Malfoy! My goodness, what’s happened?”
Major thanks to everyone who took the time to read/kudos/comment. I'm so sorry I'm not updating as much as I would like. Studying is frustrating and the world is weary. Hope this can be a bit of escapism for anyone who needs it.
“I don’t know,” he admitted. “I’m not sure things can ever be just as they were before. Whatever your mother’s reasons, she’s hurt me, and worse, she’s hurt all of you. I might have a hard time trusting her the way I used to. But I will never keep her from you, unless you want me to. I will never get in the way of any of you having a relationship with her. Whatever she feels towards me, I know she loves you, fiercely.”
“Dearest Harry,” Pansy was reading aloud in her most earnest tone. The ‘friendly gathering’ was now in full force, letters heaped into piles across the eighth year common room floor. Pansy was wearing her dragon-hide potions gloves while she held a letter saturated in love potion, “I had the dream again. I know I’ve spoken of it before, but this time it was even more powerful, more raw and visceral than ever before. Your eyes seared into my very soul, proclaiming your love, and I could truly feel you
“And everything to do with his mother and brother and the uncertainty, et cetera. Yes, Potter, I’m aware.”
Dad caught Al’s eye then, and smiled before cocking his head towards the stage, indicating Al ought to be polite and listen. Sighing, Al did so.
Harry at that DA meeting so long ago—surrounded by flaming mongrels. The pups morphed into dogs, then wolves, growing larger and spreading flames to the nearby draperies and furniture as they tore through the open space.
“What is it?” he demanded. “What’s happened?”
“Why don’t you stay? You can, if you like.” Draco offered. “Might help, hm?”
“You weren’t entirely wrong,” Harry admitted, “I know I can be a bit...like that, sometimes.”
“You really don’t,” Malfoy replied, trying to hobble away, “despite your best efforts, I survived with my memories intact.”
Draco nodded, “Feel like shit. Drank too much.”
-Death Eater, and my friend. Charges against him have been dismissed by the Wizengamot. If that’s good enough for me, it should be good enough for others. Malfoy is not clinging to childhood prejudices and I recommend you similarly follow suit.This hanging on of grudges will hurt much more than it helps.”
want Tiering to give Quidditch a shot, if only to get the kid some friends. He also had a secondary motivation: proving Malfoy wrong. The student body was not just going to fall to pieces because Harry existed.
“She has my brother,” Clark piped in for the first time, “Or at least I hope she does. He’s only five, I’m not sure if he’s a wizard or not. You’ll still look for him? Even if he’s not?”
Draco straightened his shoulders and gathered his cloak around him with deliberate efficiency. “You’ve enough going on,” he decided, voice taking on a professional bent that Harry didn’t at all care for. “I ought not to be dragging my self-flagellation into your home. I can return to the school and come back for Scorpius in the morning. I’ve administered his potion.”
Jared looked wholly unrepentant, carefully smoothing the feathers atop Constance’s massive head while she plucked the treat from his fingers.
Harry exhaled, thrilled the situation wasn’t more dire.
“Dad!” Albus whinged, “Not fair, Mum said he could visit! I’ve been waiting for Scor basically all summer!”
“Who was that?” Draco said again, into Harry’s chest.
for his wand. The bit of holly wood zipped into the kitchen from Merlin-knows-where and settled into Harry’s palm. Harry couldn’t quite remember when he’d last had use for it, as the majority of his magic was wandless these days. Nevertheless, he still preferred to learn new spells wand in hand.
“Well, you lot weren’t making any effort to keep quiet. I was doing you a favour, really, making sure no one sneaked up on you.”
Granger’s youngest passed out on the couch in the drawing room, likely from all the bellowing and hooting he’d been doing that evening. While Granger was busy tucking the child in, Draco recruited Scorpius and Al to help tidy the kitchen while Lily prepared for bed. He’d likewise tasked Rose and James with putting away the skittles game still sprawled across the garden lawn.
Harry barked out a surprised laugh. “Merlin, you’re unbelievable.”
Draco barely had time to register the bright zing of energy just above his hairline, deep inside his skull and just as suddenly gone. It was uncomfortable, making him blink, but it was also so fleeting, he couldn’t be sure he’d felt it at all.
“Simply a well-wisher,” Draco said in that same tone. Harry recognised the lie, along with the subtext:
Harry grinned, “Excellent. We’ll have our first practice tomorrow. I’ll let you know the details once they’re sorted.”
“Can you make it glow?” the girl asked, a hint of challenge in her voice.
“Oh, er, Gibbens, hi,” he replied, looking over her head for a possible excuse to use as an escape route. There was nothing but bug-eyed first years who went from stillness to scurrying when his gaze fell upon them. “Alright?”
Draco felt the wicked grin against his chest as the first tendrils of Harry’s magic started creeping round him.
“Thought you lot had probably had enough of that,” he said instead, trying to keep his tone pleasant without forcing joviality.
Harry froze. He hated this. He shouldn’t get these special privileges. Then again, Zerk always went on about how if Harry needed help, he ought to ask. This just wasn’t the sort of help Harry was used to needing.
He didn’t wait for an answer.
“I set a ward,” Draco murmured, not cutting anything out, “it will chime when he gets close.”
“Not enough to change…,” Clark flapped one hand in a frustrated gesture, “everything.”
“Well, I think it is.”
“We’re having dinner,” was Malfoy’s infuriating reply.
“I’m not convinced,” Hermione said gently, when Harry looked up from the page. She set a cup of tea in front of him. “In case you’re wondering. I don’t believe what Draco feels for you is an act. And we’ve all seen the salacious lies
Harry’s heart sunk, alarm skating along his nerves. No, it wasn’t—fuck. His letters from Draco. His map. Gone. Merlin, he should have checked his letters when he’d learned Draco’s had gone missing, he’d not even thought of it. He hunted hopefully through the various compartments and side pockets of his trunk, but to no avail. Disappointment roiled in his stomach, alongside the mounting concern over Clark’s whereabouts. He felt frustratingly impotent without the map, but knew he couldn’t focus on that now. First, he needed to find Clark.
“I’ll reel you back in,” Draco promised. "I've not patience for fools."
“Sorry?” Harry said, feeling he surely must have missed something. The pain behind his eye pulsed threateningly. He noticed then that her usual gaggle was standing quite a ways back, peeking around an arched opening.
“You’re sitting in Mummy’s spot,” Lily unhelpfully informed Malfoy as Harry put Remy in his cradling swing and magicked it into motion. He then joined his children and Malfoy at the cramped kitchen table where the family ate most of their meals. The dining room table, Harry realised guiltily, was still cluttered with breakfast things.
“You think things will ever go back to how they were?”
“So…” Harry said slowly, “it was good then? My magic doing that to you?”
Januarius was standing near Fort’s shoulder surveying them, impassive as always. His strawberry blond hair was styled into a sleek pompadour. It was quite a departure from the long sheets of hair that he’d hidden behind for the last few years. With those clipped short, his thin, pale neck and petite features were exposed. His little bow mouth and button nose were simply
then hoisted Malfoy up. He tucked Malfoy’s softening cock away, and closed his trousers and then saw to his own.
The day had turned rainy and miserable and Albus and Jamie were sniping at each other in the drawing room. Harry found he missed Scorpius already—the quiet, well-mannered boy kept Al occupied, and even Jamie seemed to like him well enough. He’d brokered a brief sort of peace between the brothers which was now entirely dissolved.
Harry tightened his grip, just this side of too hard and Malfoy flung his head back against the stone wall, grunting.
“Right, well, I'll get to the point,” Ms. Provencal said, “I have fairly good news. Our muggle liaisons have located Clark’s mother. She admitted herself to a muggle hospital not too long ago, and surrendered her younger son to temporary foster care. She was having a paranoid episode, and should be released some time tomorrow. We will do a brief assessment to ensure she is stable, but we expect Clark should be able to return home for the holidays.”
Impatiently, Harry marched down the long hall filled with bedrooms, trying not to think about his utter inexperience or the mysteries that were Malfoy’s expectations, and to focus instead on how glorious it felt to get his mouth on the other man’s skin. Harry wished he’d had more than half a glass of wine with dinner. His nerves jangled about insidiously as he rifled through the linen closet trying to find sheets that weren’t decorated with little Golden Snitches and hovering broomsticks. He didn’t need Malfoy to tease him for his lack of magic this time. He sent the sheets careening into one of the guest bedrooms with an impatient gesture. He grabbed a couple of pillow cases as well and entered the room, using another spell to light the candles in their sconces. Malfoy slipped in quietly behind him.
“Not really in a position to be making threats, are you?”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. The direct nature of his tone was tempered with tenderness now and Harry desperately wanted to touch him. All he could manage was to bump their knees together beneath the little table, but Draco responded in kind, and it would have to be enough.
Draco had a sudden yearning for Harry’s warm hand in his beneath the table, promising steadiness and strength.
“I was just down in the kitchens,” Harry explained, taking a step back so their posture might be less compromising if someone were to walk by, but he was loathe to take his hands off Malfoy entirely, “I asked the house elves if they could keep their eyes out for any students short a sheet.”
Draco couldn’t for the life of him understand why’d he’d alluded to such a thing, save for his knowing that it would induce the mottled rosy blush currently creeping along Potter’s neck and staining his cheeks. There were few things in this world as delightful as unsteadying Harry Potter, Draco determined. The other man stammered awkwardly, looking agog at Draco, as if praying he’d take the words back and restore some sort of equilibrium.
“We have to convince people that Draco’s reformed,” Harry said, “And unfortunately until people are willing to believe that, they won’t accept us.”
“Of course you did,” he smiled. “Nothing gets past you two. Well, as you can imagine, being ethically opposed, we didn’t get on so well.”
“What about the war?” Scorpius urged.
Suddenly, as if remembering where he was, Clark sprang back from the embrace.
“I am as I always am,” came the melancholy reply. “What brings you here?”
Thanks to everyone for reading along and for all your incredibly thoughtful comments. I absolutely love hearing from you, every single time!!!
Harry sighed again. Everything felt laborious and looming. He knew he owed Draco an explanation for his idiocy, and they had a million other things to discuss on top of that, but even identifying where to start was a Herculean effort.
“Sorry, Dad,” James corrected himself, less earnest this time, but Draco deemed it adequate. He could tell the boy was blinded with his own misery, but wounding Potter surely wouldn’t help the issue. Draco had no intention of permitting such behaviour in his presence.
“You tell us, Gin,” Charlie said, “You go to school with him.”
“You want more?” Harry murmured, rearranging Draco’s body with ease, until his back was flush with Harry’s chest, his knees spread wide by Harry’s. Draco’s traitor cock was hard in Harry’s hand, and being stroked in earnest now. “You know what I think might do nicely in humbling you? A bit of begging.”
“What's a catamite?” Clark asked, then blushed, "Oh, wait, nevermind. Got it."
Harry’s expression grew solemn and he tore his eyes away from the class for a moment to glance down at Scorpius. “Yes,” he agreed, “I’m sure you do. But you’ve other people protecting you, too.”
“You know that card Hermione handed me tonight?” Harry asked. Malfoy looked at him, confused, but nodded. “It was from my cousin, Dudley. He and I grew up together, his parents raised me. They, ah, they didn’t like me much.”
“What were you hoping it would be?”
“Were you seeking her insight?” Harry inquired, shoving a forkful of sweet potato in his mouth.
“Fine,” Draco said, “Tonight, six o’clock, lower dungeons, don’t be late.” Draco’s consonants clipped, his RP even more pronounced than usual. Stuffy, intolerant prat, Harry grinned to himself.
“No,” Draco informed him. “You won’t.”
Potter only shrugged. “Not up to me, is it?”
“Figured out that part, thanks, you prat. I meant the rest of it.”
“What is it? What’s wrong?” That was Draco, voice raspy with sleep. He handed Harry his glasses as he came to stand beside him. He sounded much more alert than Harry though, and concerned, and fuck, what had Clark done? He was so fucking selfish sometimes.
you, as well. And before you accuse me of holding things back from you, I’ve only just learned this and was very truly going to tell you.”
Draco dragged his gaze to Harry’s face and it seemed as though the gesture took some effort. Draco blinked and forced himself to focus, licking his lips. He was uncharacteristically nervous. “Like I’ve been called into Father’s study for a dressing down,” he admitted.
“Becoming a cwalus, you mean?”
“I—” Harry swallowed, “Memories. I think.”
“Fine,” Draco muttered, hoping to hurry Harry along.
Harry shrugged, dropping his hand to Draco’s, needing something to hold on to. “Well, you were an obvious target.”
But Jared did worry, a little.
“Are you staying the night, too, then?” Lily demanded. It took Draco a moment to realise she was speaking to him.
Malfoy rose, Scorpius in front of him. He stood behind the boy, an arm looped over his shoulder and across his chest, pulling him close. A mottled red ring circled his neck. Harry had a sick feeling it would be black by tomorrow.
Jamie felt suitably cowed. He was the older brother after all. He felt ashamed at his immaturity, now that Scorpius had pointed it out so clearly.
“Potter,” Potter mimicked. His voice dropped to a gruff murmur. “You still going to be calling me that when I’ve got you twisted up in my magic?”
“Oh, this is just what’s out there on you from the last two months. Your prestige and perception
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hullo, Gibbens,” he said, deciding to let her off easy. “Good to see you.”
“You had a choice. You could have resigned yourself to it, you could have run.”
Draco scoffed. “Darling, you proclaimed me redeemed and worthy of your love in front of the entire student body and all of the faculty. I’m yours, and you’re mine, and they all fucking know it, incontrovertibly. Of course I adored every sodding, saccharine moment of it.”
Clark was crouched outside the entrance to the hall and he gasped when he saw Harry with Draco’s body.
“What’s next then?” Clark asked and Draco leaned in, his finger tapping against his bottom lip thoughtfully.
“Well," Harry mused, "I used to fancy myself rather self-sufficient, but I’m not that way anymore, am I? Merlin, I get so bloody attached now. Do you think that’s because of them, too? Like I’m afraid of going back to that lonely, miserable cupboard?”
“He is a particularly perceptive cat,” Hermione objected, when she saw the disdain in Malfoy’s eyes.
A sudden recognition bubbled up within Harry. “You see what you’re doing, don’t you?” he asked.
“No, no, of course not,” Potter shook his head. “You shouldn’t be spending your whole holiday running after my hoodlums and changing nappies. Jamie and Al are perfectly capable of helping out with Remy. We’ll be quite alright, love, but thank you.”
’. Harry had no reason not to take the other man at his word.
“You don’t think that now?” Draco asked.
Also Spellotaped to the offensively bright walls were various paintings of magical beasts. Enchanted figurines of unicorns stamped and paraded along the window sill, swishing their tails magnanimously. The room was clearly the girl’s kingdom.
“No,” he admitted.
Draco gritted his teeth, his head drooping further. He made an unhappy little sound as the movement obviously added pressure to his shoulders and he reversed it.
“Useless,” he’d announced, stomping off to his bedroom to complain to a sympathetic Bird Hiram.
"Very well," Draco agreed.
“Must be nice,” Clark grumbled. They came to the hallway leading towards the temporary Slytherin common room. “Well, this is me then. See you, Harry. Let me know if you find him? Send that deer-Patrony-thing, I want another look at it and I want to show Hiram, too.”
“I told you how Scorpius Malfoy was ill last night. I thought I’d just check up on him, see how he’s doing.”
“Not right away, LiLu, but over the next week or two, yes, I’m afraid so. It’s part of my responsibility as a professor to live at or near the school. But we can pop back here any time, if you feel you’ve forgotten something. Besides, won’t it be fun to have a second bedroom to decorate?”
“Professor Stump, your predecessor, will have no doubt left you hers. She’s a practical woman, and clever. You’re familiar enough with the curriculum and I’ve no doubt you can improvise the rest.”
“Can I bring my train?” Jared pressed.
Malfoy snorted. “It is no wonder you are cooking averse. How hideously laborious.”
Draco gave a tense, humourless laugh. “That’s hardly the issue.”
“Honestly, it’s a bit tired, isn’t it?” Draco prompted. “This schoolyard intimidation nonsense? I’m here at Potter’s invitation and I’m not going anywhere.”
“I’m…” Harry cleared his throat because his voice felt cramped and ugly trying to escape him, “I’m not sure I got to have a childhood.”
“Hermione’s just accepted an internship in the Department of International Cooperation,” Ron bragged. “I’ll be at the shop with George, of course. Draco’s snagged an apprenticeship at St. Mungo’s, and Harry will be taking the year to train, yeah?”
“Merlin’s teeth! What. Are.
is already aware.” The name dripped with loathing.
“I don’t know,” Clark sighed. He sounded miserable and Draco’s natural instinct was to fix things. Unfortunately, he was a little unclear on what needed to be fixed. “You’ll just want to throw money at it.”
“Well then make her be ready!” Jamie cried out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I thought so,” Harry shrugged. “But over the past year...something changed. She didn’t ice me out or anything, and she harped on me less about my bad habits than she ever had before. Instead, it was almost as though she decided she wasn’t going to be fussed about things like that any more. Even when I’d do something really thoughtless—like…”
“I’m not the one who spent the summer experimenting on him!” Jamie snarled back. “I don’t know what happened, but I didn’t do anything, and I don’t appreciate the implication that I did, you wanker!”
“He was just freaking out!” Jamie insisted. “You would, too, if your tongue were suddenly too big for your mouth.”
“You know, Harry, you’ve not been to visit me in simply ages, and ever since you had that nasty row with Draco, he’s not come to see me, either. It really was rotten of you to spoil the only friendship I’ve had in decades. And then to not even come to visit and see if I was alright? After witnessing all that bloodshed? Not very gentlemanly of you at all. I was beginning to think you didn’t like me any longer.” She pouted and picked at her chin. “Is it because of my spots?”
“Too much?” he whispered.
“Stop looming,” Draco instructed. Potter narrowed his eyes, but when Draco refused to respond, the other man huffed and plopped himself down on the lumpy sofa. Draco briefly considered toying with Potter’s patience for a moment longer, but decided not to risk it. “Firstly,” Draco began, “you’re not hearing this from me.” He paused.
, it said,
“You’re right,” Al admitted. “Sorry. It’s fine.” He took a deep breath and turned towards Jamie. “How was your day?” he asked. The civil question seemed to take a large quantity of restraint. Clearly, it was too much for Al, because he immediately blurted out: “Did you read your dumb books or play your dumb sports or hang out with your dumb friends?”
“Teddy, love, have you seen the—”
“That’s the spirit,” Harry said, kissing his hair.
“Nothing I could make sense of,” Harry said. “Do you remember anything?”
“It’s fine.”
“Why do you lot get to be normal?” Draco retorted.
“I don’t have a lunar calendar on me,” Hermione said, “but that sounds about right. What does it, mean, though?”
“Exactly,” Draco re-positioned himself, lowering to his knees, and taking the hand from Harry’s back to place it against Harry’s cheek, “That's right, I’m fine. You seemed concerned that I wasn’t.”
“Right,” Harry agreed. “Sorry.”
Draco reached out, unaffected, and smoothed Harry’s wayward hair. He tucked a section behind one ear, where it refused to stay, and gave Harry an infuriatingly placid look. “Surely that isn’t news, darling. Now, accept Tiering’s apology, so he can be on his way.”
CW: canon-typical violence, cliffhanger
“Didn’t get that from me,” Harry mused.
“Yeah, alright,” Potter agreed finally. “I’ll get Remy down and we’ll have some tea, then.”
His own room has black walls with vintage band posters and another one with a red, raised fist. He’d read somewhere that white walls made a space seem bigger, and Clark had wanted the opposite, because he’d never had a room so large as this, all for himself, and it made him feel a bit scattered in too many directions. His bed was massive, as well, with a canopy, and polished wooden posts and a forest green duvet with champagne coloured sheets.
“Your wardrobe is tolerable, at best,” Draco insisted.
“You saw me during the lunch hour,” Draco reminded him, not admitting that he knew just what Potter meant.
“A solid point. Would you say that touch is important to you?”
“I can’t believe you know the address already,” Harry uttered under his breath, once they were safely out of the shop.
“They’ve taken him for observation, just to make sure his lung function returns to normal.”
It did feel like victory.
Of all the horrors Draco had lived through, nothing came close to the idea of losing his only child. He didn’t even know what he would do.
“Hm,” Draco agreed. “How about instead of talking about my affliction of a father, you kiss me some more?”
“You’re too kind, Breety, truly,” Harry said, after swallowing down a mouthful of his raisin scone, “Did you happen to notice? Were any students missing their topsheet?”
“Well, then because you’re saving me some effort. And your granny always says, sometimes you have to use a bit of elbow grease. Magic doesn’t always cut it.”
“Bacon, for an owl,” was the muttered, disapproving response.
“My life,” Harry corrected him. “I had this dream for what I wanted it to be, but I think I knew she was unhappy. Deep down, surely I must have. I’m not sure she even really wanted children, not truly. She never said that, but I’m don't think family life was what she was expecting. And then Remy came along and—I didn’t force her to keep the baby. I wouldn’t do that, of course I wouldn’t. She just asked me if I wanted it and I answered honestly that yes, I did, but I told her I wouldn’t be angry or anything, and that I would respect her decision entirely. But I should have seen how much she’d wanted to leave this stage behind: the sleeplessness nights and the mess and the endless nappies. Merlin, what have I done?”
“A spell to stun and inspire, obviously. I need an
“You know,” Clark said, “Like I’ve done to you a couple of times, with Occlumency. I left my amulet in my room, and honestly it was ages before she showed, but eventually she took the bait. Hopped in my head to convince me of this or that, and I just held her there ‘til dawn so she couldn’t get at anyone else. And it worked right? She can’t be in two places at once. I mean, there was that one day at the quidditch pitch when she got at everyone, but she had her mum's help with that. And besides, she says she has to be right mad for big pushes and sometimes she can’t muster it. Says people have always accused her of being moody, and apparently that didn’t change with death. I said I thought that was a good bit of self-reflection and she said she doesn’t have much else to do, except get angry and think about her feelings. I think she might be lonely, really.”
“I don’t expect it is so much The Burrow that brought him here as it is Harry. Sorry, mate, I think the jig is up,” Ron said.
“I’m sorry today didn’t go as you’d hoped,” Harry murmured, tentatively. He sat down on the side of the bed, one leg on the floor, the other curled up in front of him.
“Dad said he got used to them as a kid and that laundry cauldrons were too cumbersome. So he got them installed when I was little. Mum was pretty pleased with them, too, once she figured them out. But magic’s a bit weird in this corner of the basement because of how they are, whatsit, hooked up? Grandad must have explained it to me a hundred times, but I never did quite understand what he was getting at." The boy paused and his tone was more morose when he next spoke. "And now I guess I’ll never know.”
,” Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco preen a little at the words, “and I mostly can’t be arsed, but I don’t think I’m an
Draco swallowed, closed his eyes for a moment, when he opened them again he looked hesitant and ashamed, “I mean...I went for you. I stunned Awling—honestly, I’m surprised I didn’t try to kill her—and then I went for you. Even though the
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Alright. That helps, Zerk, thanks.”
Ahead of them in the shadows, he saw Seamus sling an arm around Dean with that same easy affection. Another kiss and then the two slowly faded from view.
“He still bothering you?” Harry was surprised. Draco hadn’t mentioned him since that day back in Hogsmeade.
“I’ve not got a death wish!” Albus assured him.
“Hiram!” Harry called out and the small boy turned, eyes round as buttons when he saw who was calling out. He actually looked around him, as if to make sure there wasn’t somehow
“Not exactly going for threatening, are they?” Hiram whispered.
CW: mental illness, OC-centric
“She has had no equal,” agreed the Grey Lady. “That I am forever parted from her is my greatest regret.”
“Interesting hypothesis,” Zerk mused. “Control is not something you’ve had a lot of in your life.”
“It, ah, it was my honour to have fought beside her,” Harry replied, and it sounded so hollow, so forced. He was afraid they would notice that all he could see when he thought of Lavender was Fenrir Greyback’s ruthless face dripping with her blood, the coppery smell of her mangled body where she lay dying.
“Frankie, you doorknob!” Bernard laughed. “That’s a shit thing to say!”
every other day, kind of hard to forget. Welcome to Fletcher’s Field, I’m Shanna, the director of operations, and I’ll get you signed in.”
Harry took off his glasses to rub his eyes. “Right,” he said. “So. What has Al done?”
“Well?” Draco prompted. “What’s happened? You had me quite convinced accepting the offer was out of the question.”
General assent was given and Malfoy gave word to disperse. Harry quickly corralled his nervy bunch of younger years, and led the way through the great entrance and towards the stairs that led to the Hufflepuff common room. They’d not gotten far at all when they spotted the first signs of smoke.
“Hear what?” Harry demanded, kneeling beside him, taking his face in his hands, “Draco, what’s happened?”
“Very pragmatic of you,” Draco decided.
“He’ll come round,” Harry said quickly as a spike of guilt flashed through him. “I really think he will. It’s my fault for not telling him. Hermione will set him straight, she always does. He means well, he’s just...protective.”
He checked his watch again. 6:28. Was he supposed to be waiting in the drawing room for Malfoy’s arrival? Or was it better to appear busy, and then stroll in as though surprised to find Malfoy standing there? Harry didn’t think he’d felt this bloody nervous since he’d asked Cho Chang to the Yule Ball in fourth year. Harry winced—look how well that had turned out.
“I’m grateful that he did,” Draco went on, surprising Harry. “Being out of his favour and witnessing his cruelty shook me to the core, and made me question the beliefs my parents took to be self-evident. It was then that I realised he had never been working towards anything just or righteous: He wanted only a world of drones to do his bidding. His end ambition was nothing short of unadulterated power, the pure-blood nonsense was only a mask he hid behind to garner support. Had my family remained in his good graces, I fear it would have taken me much longer to reach such a conclusion.”
“Let’s discuss it in the common room,” Hermione decided. “No one else will be there.”
“Merlin’s teeth, Malfoy,” Potter’s tone was hushed. “Where is she now?”
“I’m sure he thought there was a lesson in there somewhere.”
“I don’t know anything about wine,” he grumbled, “I’m not even sure I like it all that much.”
To Harry’s exquisite horror, the rest of the hall joined in, hollering and hooting and chanting his name. Harry wanted to dive into the pile of letters and never emerge.
, you great pillock. Come here.” Draco gripped Harry by his faded t-shirt and tugged him to his feet. He pressed his lips to Harry’s neck and was pleased when he felt the other man shiver. “I want to do all sorts of things for you, just as I want to do this,” Draco illustrated, kissing a line up to Harry’s jaw. “And this.” His mouth pressed against the corner of Harry’s. “And especially this.” Their lips met.
“Vate what-nows?” Potter queried.
"If...if you want," Clark said, his voice gravelly with suppressed emotion, "You don't have to."
“Merlin, Lily,” Potter scolded anxiously, once he seemed to remember where he was. “You’ve got to be careful when you wake me, you know that. You could get hurt.”
“You do know I was planning on spoiling you with the most sophisticated bird money could buy. It was supposed to be your Christmas gift,” Draco complained.
“What makes you think that?” Draco asked.
It was late and Harry was quite drunk. Hermione had just hauled Ron off to bed, kissing Harry’s cheek and wishing him a good night as they went. Most others seemed to have kipped it as well, Harry hadn’t noticed exactly when. He was that sort of drunk where time skipped ahead without his noticing. He was staring out the window. Outside, some builders were still working into the night, bright lights illuminating the damaged ramparts of the central tower. It felt good to watch something be made whole.
“Will it bother you?” Draco asked with a sharp note of concern.
The old goblin cleared his throat, and Harry turned. A large, forest green ledger was opened on the counter in front of him. He scanned it quickly. It wasn’t his imagination, then. His vault had been more scant than usually. There was a modest withdrawal coinciding with Ginny’s departure, and her income was no longer being deposited. Well, that settled it.
“Okay, so, Teddy’s textbook talked about the marriage of word or thought and intention,” Albus was saying. He had his notebooks spread out on the great stone dining table at Malfoy Manor. Potter had dropped him off earlier that afternoon with a sweet, hesitant little smile which Draco had returned, despite himself. They’d discussed the visit that day in the library, Harry only allowing it after making Draco promise up and down he’d not scold the child or make him feel badly for what he’d done. Given the memory spell was created in an effort to help Scorpius, and sounded like quite an impressive bit of charmwork, Draco had easily agreed.
Draco looked both amused and astonished. “Do I wish you were more like Tennyson Ariti?”
Harry fucked into him with his fingers again, Malfoy gasped and ground back against him.
Harry glanced across the pub at their server. He tried to think about him kneeling at his feet, like Draco had done that morning. It did nothing for him. His prick didn’t even stir, and that was odd, wasn’t it? He couldn’t think of another man he wanted to be with the way he was with Draco.
“I honestly don’t know what I was thinking,” Draco announced, stepping swiftly out of the fireplace. He unclasped his apprentice healer’s robes and hung them on the coat stand. Harry looked up from where he was sprawled on the sofa doing not much of anything after a grueling practice.
Malfoy paused, his back still to Harry. He stood still for a long moment before turning back to face him.
It wasn’t until the afternoon, all three bathrooms as near as sparkling as he could make them, that Harry went into the drawing room. He sat Remy at a play bench Ron and Hermione had sent as a gift. It was wooden with lots of brightly painted dials and buttons and switches. Sitting was rather a new skill for the baby, and Remy wobbled precariously while he reached forward. Something crackled and Harry turned to see Teddy appear in the fireplace, the ridiculous moustache gone, and his long hair pulled back.
They would seem an odd match, though, Scorpius thought. Harry was warm and enthusiastic and universally adored, whereas most people mistakenly thought of Father as cold and austere, and a little frightening. He’d been a Death Eater, after all, and didn’t shy away from speaking openly about his experiences.
“I don’t even know what I’m agreeing to.”
“Will you come?” Harry blurted out, after.
“Um, excuse me, Miss?” Harry called out to the shopkeeper who’d just turned tail, Draco’s spell having its effects. She swiveled about at once, the magic falling away now that she had been acknowledged.
“And he blames you for that?”
Malfoy’s pale lashes fluttered closed and he bit his lip for a moment, a soft, keening noise sounding low in his throat.  With a shaky breath he began, “Sometimes, during the war, when I was trapped in that house and nothing was certain and everything felt like danger...sometimes I pretended you’d marked me like this on purpose. Claimed me as...as yours. I told myself it meant you would come for me, take me far away and,” he voice broke, “keep me safe. Because I belonged to you. I know, it’s completely absurd, fucking pathetic, I know. I just. Needed something to hold on to.”
Draco returned to his son’s question. Was it in any way Draco’s fault that Fred Weasley was dead? Draco had worked hard not to bury himself in guilt. Guilt was not productive, or helpful, he knew that, but he could never fully shake it, either. “No, I am thankfully blameless in that. I suspect it is more what or who I represented that angers him still.” Was what he settled on. “I walked free despite my transgressions, and I suspect it is hard for Mr. Weasley to watch me have opportunities his brother never will.”
“I know,” Harry acknowledged. “I’ll try not to let him get away with it, either, but I think you hit a nerve there, with what you said about Scorpius. He’s awfully concerned.”
Harry felt a bit better with a task at hand. He dug out his favourite knife from a cluttered drawer and started chopping the vegetables. He let Malfoy sort out the venison—
Draco looked up from his magazine, taking Harry in. Harry really wasn’t sure how Draco could look so put together in the mornings—although he suspected it had something to do with trying. For his part, Harry was half-undressed, wearing only his striped pajama bottoms, and his hair flattened on one side and an absolute disaster on the other.
“I’ve been going to wizarding school, not muggle school, you’ll remember,” he said defensively.
Zerk shrugged, “Then you’ll respect no, and let him know you’re open to it if he needs.”
“Fuck!” Clark exploded, throwing his wand across the room, “I can’t fucking do it!”
“No, no,” Malfoy shook his head, looking a bit stunned, “they just appeared, hadn’t gotten a blow in. Your Patronus couldn’t be a bit less ostentatious, could it, Potter? Merlin, great bloody stag prancing about.”
“And what sorts of topics do you discuss at…” Draco started.
“There are instructions on the back, or I can just show you, see if I still have the muscle memory after all these years.”
“Sort of muggle counterculture pamphlets,” Harry filled him in.
Harry turned, confused. “What? I thought I’d run you a shower.”
“Not that it is any of your business, but yes.”
“I avoid popularity, it has many snares and no real benefit,” said the spindly, pink-haired boy, but he didn’t sound quite as stalwart as Harry suspected he was hoping to.
Scorpius shrugged and looked down, embarrassed. “Oh, you know Father. He can be a bit of a snob. He prefers quality and all that. You can ride it if you like, I don’t mind.”
. Malfoy’s voice sounded somewhere,
“Alright, sweetheart. When you’re ready, then. I’ll be here.”
“Your scars? Harry Potter did that?”
“I love you,” Harry reminded him, “nothing you do awake or asleep will change that.”
“What do you want to do?” Draco asked him.
“I’d talk to her,” he insisted, “if she’d just tell me where she is or agree to meet me, I want to fix this, she must know that.”
“Okay, your mission is to sneak into the drawing room and listen
“I injured my knee early in the term,” Draco supplied, “and Harry was helping me with that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“An ocean may roar, or a jaguar strike, but naught alone may save a pinioned Pythia!” said a low, hoarse voice. Harry was shocked to realise the words were erupting from Scorpius’ throat. Before he could react, Malfoy had drawn his wand, aimed it at his son, and shouted: “
“I really won’t,” Scorpius promised.
Harry and Mathieu Rundle, from Bristol, Harry remembered, warmed keeper Marcia Awling up with some practice shots. As neither Rundle nor Harry were chasers, the shots seemed a bit easy for Awling, but the stony-faced Slytherin girl didn’t seem to mind, and she expertly intercepted each one.
“Leave it, Dad.”
“Level 5: Department of International Cooperation,” yawned the man, “Oi, you’re—”
Draco snorted, but held out a hand. “Yes, yes, we’d hate for you to feel left out. Better climb up here then.”
Harry gave a rough approximation of a grin. “Er, hi,” he muttered.
of such a thing speared through him, anchoring him in place. He’d not walk away, he realised, not of his own volition.
“Fucking hell, Potter, your fingers are freezing!”
“He didn’t find it,” Potter hurried to clarify. “He created it.”
The anger drained out of Harry at the sight of him. He sat on the bed, and this time Clark didn’t wince when he reached for him. Harry’s hand was gentle as it curled around the boy’s shoulder. “Not like that,” he said. “Never like that. I meant just for tonight, or today, really, since it is morning. I need sleep, love, especially since I’ve already gone and said something I regret, and I suspect you and Atwal do, too. I’ll let everyone know you’re safe and sound and we’ll review all this later, when I’m more able to take it in. How’s that?”
Once the class was settled and had their quills out to take notes on the reproductive cycle of the Carnivorous Crocus, a final projectile caught Scorpius on the ear.
“Out of all the fit blokes and girls at Hogwarts…” he shook his head.
Harry, despite his reservations, had agreed to let Draco to take the lead on things—”but only if you at least try to be nice,” he’d argued, to which Malfoy had archly replied that he would “be fair.”
“He shouldn’t have to. Fred was killed. I know as well as anyone what side of the whole thing Draco was on, whether he wanted to be there or not. I’ve not forgotten. I realise it stinks of disloyalty and I can’t make that right, but...I don’t think I can’t give Draco up, either, even if I should. It’s a bloody mess.”
Ron nodded understanding and jogged off, but Neville stayed behind. "I'll help with bubble head charms," he said.
Draco gathered his legs up onto the sofa then turned over, burying his face in Harry’s belly.
A couple of tears rolled down her elegant cheek. She quickly dashed them away with a handkerchief very similar to the one of Draco’s that Harry had washed, dried, folded and carefully tucked away in a corner of his trunk, “Funny how things work out,” she said, as if lost in another memory.
“I can’t cast it fast enough, and besides, I don’t have wandless let alone wordless magic. It was never going to work; it was just another one of Al’s pipe dreams.”
Harry toyed with the spot, watching mesmerised as Draco keened in pleasure.
Harry removed himself quickly. He clapped Clark on the shoulder, congratulating him, while Malfoy handed over a box of toffees—he’d insisted Harry get a separate supply for younger student.
Harry somehow doubted that was true, “Oh yeah, what did you do this morning?”
“When I was small,” Scorpius replied.
Draco was very still, except for the elegant, capable fingers of his wand hand, which toyed with a teaspoon, a nervous tell. “I think,” he confessed, “I had some fanciful idea of convincing you to run away from it all with me. I loathed you, but I loathed the thought of you dead much more. I wanted something so utterly different to the world I had known those last couple of years. Something
“Very well,” Draco conceded haughtily. “Go on.”
Malfoy seemed to take a moment to scrutinise his face, then smiled and obediently began to peel the fruit, “See, Potter, I knew you had a sense of humour hidden in there, somewhere.”
“Hey,” Harry said, and he reached out and his hand was warm on Clark’s arm and his voice was kind, because he was always kind, which was why Clark liked it here so damn much, because he always knew what he was going to get. Harry would be kind, and Draco would be snarky, but like...also kind. “What is it?”
“What are you so ashamed of?” Harry asked quietly.
“Oh,” another voice sounded from the doorway. Draco leaped back, Harry scrambled for his glasses, smashing them onto his face.
“We needed that to find Clark,” Harry said, too worked up to care that his agitation was clearly evident in the urgent crack of his voice. Draco gripped his arm, not pulling him away but keeping him from encroaching and threatening the girl farther. He whispered a warning: Harry’s name drawn out and stern. Harry forced himself to step back, the anger still a heated rush, but tinged with gratitude that Draco had not let him do anything reckless.
Only Scorpius would freely admit to feeling something so deeply, Al thought, and only Scorpius wouldn’t be mocked for it.
“Draco, tell me what you need,” Harry repeated emphatically, with a trace of sternness.
“And what if their ideas hurt people?”
McGonagall wrapped him into an unexpected hug.
Reluctantly, Harry waved goodbye to the Weasleys
After a thorough coaxing, complete with a dedicated tuft rub, Meat Pie stuck out one scaly foot, sharp talons glinting in the candlelight, and allowed Harry to affix the little scroll in place.
“Eat your gruel, Potter,” Draco demanded. “Tiering is fine. Even if Brown did pay him a visit, you said last week that Clark had his Occlumency down, finally. You said you went full strength and he kept you out.”
A door opened in Harry's head, and white hot rage poured inside. Lavender’s rage, he realised, yanking his hand out of Draco’s to clutch his temples. The anger roared about inside him, seizing his muscles and making him shake. It was shapeless, excruciating, directionless: singing in his teeth and the chambers of his heart.
“No,” Hermione admitted, “but it’s not nothing.”
Harry swallowed his last bit of pumpkin juice and pocketed the note. This whole situation was bollocks, really. Why the fuck hadn’t Malfoy just told him, why had he left him to hear it from the paper? Why had he run? Why didn’t he trust Harry to stand beside him and see this through like they’d done everything else? Harry knew the article was ninety percent rubbish but it was the leftover unknown that made him feel queasy.
The flare of anger faded from Ginny’s face as she curled up next to Ron and Hermione, Neville perching on the arm of the couch beside her.
“How old’s your brother, then?” Harry asked, deliberately changing the subject.
“Potions, defense, charms, history, transfiguration, herbology, arithmancy and ancient runes," Malfoy rattled off.
“No,” Hermione assured him, “It’s perfect. But you’re telling Ron and you’re telling Draco because I’ll be damned if we have to live through the secrets and lies ordeal twice in one term.”
“But you always know anything worth knowing before anyone else. Merlin, I didn’t even know if it was official or not, I’d never thought to ask.”
“Thanks, I think so, too,” Harry accepted, but he wondered how much of the change in him was due to his return to Hogwarts and how much was Draco being in his life.
Harry cast a wandless
“Fuck,” he muttered. “I forgot he was there for a minute. I think I feel weird about shagging in the same room as my kid.”
“Because it was clear someone needed to,” he said, “and I never trust others to properly handle the most crucial of tasks.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake!” Harry cried out.
“Surely your father can extend the hem on what you have. It’s hardly a difficult spell.”
Over the noises of Greyback, Harry could still hear the wet crunch of Draco’s bones and the unnatural shifting of marrow as Wilma Brown popped his vertebra like ripe cherries.
Harry passed the letter to Draco. “What do you think?” he asked.
"Yeah," Harry breathed. "It was an...interesting night, but turns out that doesn't matter because I just always like being with you." He lifted his head to give Draco a lazy kiss. "Happy Valentine's, sweetheart. Let's not do it again."
“A bit,” Draco agreed, maintaining a board straight line from his knees to the crown of his head. Harry saw how much the other boy needed this: clear rules, objectives he could achieve.
Their start times were staggered by a half hour each, which left Harry just seated on the pitch for ninety minutes, waiting his turn. The constant thrum of his nerves was more irritating than anything. He was desperate to distract himself with small talk, but the other seekers didn't seem interested.
“Tea’s downstairs,” Harry said, cheerfully, “do you take anything in yours?”
As if reading his thoughts, Draco slipped a hand under the table and gave Harry’s leg a consolatory squeeze. It only lasted a moment, but the contact was precisely what Harry needed, somehow: a glimmer of reassurance that Draco wasn’t running, not yet.
“I thought it was my only chance,” Draco murmured, his voice close enough for the words to caress the skin of Harry’s neck as he spoke them. “I knew once we left Hogwarts that would be it. We wouldn’t be in each other’s lives. I didn't have much time, only this year. I didn't have time to court you properly, so I had to expedite things. This seemed, at the time, like an acceptable option."
Hermione didn’t look thrilled with participating in this particular classist phenomenon but she strode forward. “Come on, we don’t want to lose our reservations.”
“No!” Jared giggled. “Not a squash either.”
“Potter, are you ogling our poor server’s arse?” Draco wondered, but he sounded more amused than anything.
“You don’t need to sort it just now, and you absolutely don’t need to apologise,” Draco declared, sliding his fingers through Harry’s hair. Harry leaned forward, then, and pressed his mouth to Draco’s, relieved to find the lips familiar, warm, and tasting of tea.
Myrtle crossed her arms and stamped her foot in mid-air. “Oh it’s just Lavender, Lavender, Lavender with everyone today!”
Harry sighed. He didn’t like giving out punishments. Jamie had been terrible to him all summer, and although they had had words, Harry for the most part, had excused it. But it was one thing for Jamie to be awful to him. It was another thing for Al to be secretly terrible to Jamie, and Harry couldn’t stand for it.
“Oh,” Scorpius said, his face was pinched with nerves. “Did I say anything?”
“Oh my God, you’re worse than the social support woman,” Clark grumbled, blushing uncomfortably beneath his freckles.
Potter checked his wristwatch. “Oh, Merlin, I don’t know, Jamie. Beans on toast, probably.”
Scorpius looked torn. There was clearly another question buzzing in his brain, but not one to which he felt confident giving voice.
“You don’t like being hurt,” he insisted, teeth gritted as the mounting needs warred inside him.
“And I’ve been stuck on you since puberty, much to my dismay,” Draco replied, “not to mention I’ve likely been exposed to anything you might have. Which is nothing since we were both painfully virginal setting out. So, I think we’re safe to do without? Do you think? Unless circumstances change?”
a diplomat. Harry had always sort of suspected this, but at moments like these it became painfully evident that the witch was keeping some secrets of her own.
: alcohol use, past child neglect referenced, mental illness referenced, maybe some mild disassociation?
“Are you? Because you seem to be under the impression that I would hurt my son.”
“I love you!” Harry added, partly to be irritating but mostly because he meant it.
Draco shrugged and leaned in, kissing Harry’s neck, “It’s almost a relief knowing you regret something,” he said quietly, “because I regret nearly everything and it...it feels like a lot sometimes.”
“Because you burn?” Harry teased, gently.
“Merlin, not at all. If anything, they are my most staunch supporters; they’d more likely demand I get special treatment than resent me for it.”
“Whoa, what sort of objects?” Al asked, perking up.
“And do what exactly?” Jamie pressed. “Just burn the whole place to ash? How are we supposed to tell which stone or which desk is secretly containing a curse? It’s not like it’s going to tell us.”
Harry lumbered into the kitchen feeling ten years older and similarly exhausted.
The sprites were humanoid, but absolutely tiny, each with a glowing light behind their sternum.  Two sets of rounded honey bee wings sprouted from each miniscule back, and when in motion, they beat as fast as hummingbirds’. The sprites were pantomiming little dances and aerial acrobatics, but wouldn’t stay still long enough for Al to get a good look at their features.
Harry froze. Draco could be as honest as he wished with his own child, but he didn’t owe Harry’s kids anything, which was precisely why Harry had left any mention of Draco out of the narrative.
Harry jumped guiltily. “No! I mean, sort of, I don’t know. It’s just, how did you know you were—that you, er, liked blokes?”
He looked back to the bed, conflicted. Harry had fallen back asleep. Surely he didn’t need Draco now. So the question was, could Draco permit the risk just to satisfy this newfound craving?
He shook his head. He needed to tell Draco, but he didn’t want to. He was afraid the other boy would take it too much to heart, that the rejection would wedge its way between them. It was as if all a sudden, the future he’d let himself imagine had been nabbed from him, and he was staring down the barrel of...what? A year training, he supposed, but was there any point? Would any team take him, especially once he and Draco were living at the same address? Or did he have to start looking around for some other profession he might enjoy? There were worse things than not having it all sorted at eighteen, he supposed, but it still felt like a void where there’d previously been light.
“Hm,” Malfoy acknowledged, “glad you appreciate the privilege.”
“Not much, I don’t think,” Jamie hurried to reply. “I didn’t even hear more than a few words, and I got to him pretty quickly. He even bit me when he was trying to talk. Not hard, though.”
Harry winced.
Harry arrived at the Leaky Cauldron at quarter past  eleven, which he didn’t think was so bad, all things considered. He had Remy’s pram in front of him, and a surly Jamie, a buzzing Albus and a dreamy Lily behind him. Malfoy was at a table with Scorpius, checking his pocket watch. Harry remembered that watch from school; the pretension of it used to make him furious. It irked him, still. Never mind. Al, at least, was looking forward to a day with his best mate, and Harry was determined not to spoil it for him.
“I wanted to talk to you three tonight,” Harry said, “Somewhere a bit more private. Can we meet in the library after supper?”
Draco forced himself to meet her eyes. “Yes,” he agreed.
“Manners,” Harry reminded him.
“I know I am,” Scorpius muttered. He strode ahead for a few paces and for a moment, Jamie thought maybe he ought to head in a different direction, but he really did feel terrible for upsetting the kid, and wanted to make amends.
“That’s better now, isn’t it?” Said Ron with a forced joviality, “Kiss and make up and we’ll look more into it. Teamwork and all that.”
“You’re marvelous,” Ron admired.
“She wants to see you,” came the reply.
“I don’t know what happened,” Al whispered urgently. “We’d just fallen asleep and suddenly he sprung up, shouting. You’ve got to help him, Daddy.”
“I…” Draco swallowed. Harry was on alert now, no protests on Draco’s part would put him off. Draco didn’t respond right away, scanning his brain for something that would require very little effort on Harry’s part, but would still make him feel like he was helping, but his distracted mind couldn’t provide him with anything convincing. “I think it would help,” he began carefully, “if I could drown them out a little—my thoughts I mean.”
He didn’t want to think about it.
Atwal did not look appeased, but nor did he look up to taking McGonagall to task. “Yes, Headmistress,” he grumbled instead.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek contemplatively. “I don’t know,” he said, despising the idea with everything in him. “I guess I could give an interview. I will if it makes things safer for you.”
“No. Need you,” was the tenuous response.
Draco’s heart lurched at the words. He could have said the very same about his own early years. How had he not realised how very similar he and Harry had been? They’d both been trapped in homes where cruelty was commonplace, leaving them to contend with the chronic, consuming anxiety that came with not knowing when the next blow would land, physical or otherwise.
It had only taken a bashful expression and Harry muttering he’d realised he “hadn’t anything to wear tomorrow,” for McGonagall to sign off on Harry’s weekend pass—not that there was much left of the weekend.
“To the quidditch pitch on December evenings,” Harry informed him. “
“What?”
“You know,” Harry tried, “let’s leave it, yeah? I fucked up with not telling you, Draco fucked up with goading you, you fucked up with reacting. Hermione’s the only prudent one between us, and really, you’d think I’d be used to that by now.”
“How do you figure?” Malfoy sniffed.
“What do you mean?”
“Alright,” Harry said, kissing him one last time. “Have a good week, yeah, babe?”
“Do you want me to make a statement?” Harry repeated, “Confirm we’re together? You’d think taking you out for a Valentine's Day meal would be sufficient, but I guess not.”
Harry waved his hand vaguely in the direction of Draco’s face. “You look very intent on something.”
. Like it's one thing to be friendly with Draco, it's a whole other thing to...” Harry didn't know how to finish the sentence, "tell him we're shagging."
Malfoy shrugged, “I’ve got to keep my options open.”
“Full moon tonight,” Harry said slowly, “and seems like there has been one major attack per month. We weren’t back at school yet for the January full moon. Mrs. Brown’s attack was early December. The walls crumbling in on Draco was a month before. The quidditch pick a month before that. The DA meeting fiasco was September. There were other incidents, yes, but mostly just voices in heads. Could just be coincidence but it has never added up that there are so many lulls.”
Harry squeezed their clasped hands in place, reaffirming his control, leaning into this new, exquisite feeling. He kissed Draco’s pulse point, his jaw, back down along his neck to the hollow above his clavicle just visible above the neckline of his shirt. The way Malfoy strained and whimpered beneath him was intoxicating, as was the roll of his hips, pressing up into Harry’s to demonstrate just what effect his efforts were having. Only when Malfoy looked about half ready to murder him in denied agitation, did Harry finally kiss his perfect, pink mouth.
Draco nodded, “They would be. Wizards and witches have no business poking about in one another’s minds. And yet, someone is, and whoever it is did it to you. So here we are. Occlumency is a protective magic with many stages. The most basic stage—which is all we will be making any attempt at in these lessons—is the assembling of a wall between your thoughts and those who wish to invade them. More skilled Occlumens, Unspeakables, for instance, or those involved in espionage, are able to construct entire false realities and can conceal from their enemies that they are performing the spell at all.”
Mum smiled as she shook the lady’s hand. “Oh well, that’s a bit of a relief, isn’t it?” she said.
“Is this about the fire?" Harry demanded, anger resurfacing, "What was I supposed to do, just leave Clark to die?” He felt Draco tense up next to him, and Harry felt vindicated. Exactly. They could whinge about his actions all they wanted but the alternative would have been worse. “The healer said if he’d gone another minute or two without oxygen that could have been it for him, he would have been brain damaged or worse.”
Draco wanted to make a comment about how he didn’t generally drop in on Potter for social calls, but he supposed the Lupin boy would know that, having been half-raised by the man.
The voice asked,
curse at Malfoy, only Harry took the curse instead.”
“Don’t speak about things you don’t understand, Weasley,” he countered, voice icy. “It’s not a good look.”
He sighed and passed the letter to Draco. “What do you make of this?” he asked.
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face, “That sounds an awful lot like dark magic, you didn’t think to tell anyone?” First years, honestly.
Hermione reached into her satchel and produced the morning’s edition of
“So possessive, sweetheart,” Harry chided, dipping to press a kiss in the hollow above Draco’s collarbone. He could feel the other boy wickedly hard against him already. He ran a teasing knuckle along the obvious length.
Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek for a minute. “It was...nice to tell someone who I wasn’t worried was going to disown me. Ron and Hermione, they’re my best mates—you probably know that, Merlin, it is strange having the whole bloody world know these things—well, they’ve been wonderful. Ron’s family, too, save for his brother, who has good reason to be cross. It's not as though I don't know why everyone’s upset. I know Draco did really terrible things, I can’t pretend that he didn’t. He just did some brave things, too. And his circumstances were...less than ideal. Merlin, I don’t want to have to justify him for the rest of my fucking life like this.”
The crumpled rejection in his pocket sent ice water spurting through his arteries; bracing and vexatious. The let down was humiliating but also unanticipated. Harry truly, if only privately, thought he’d had a real shot. Maybe he’d let the well-wishers talk him up, or else Ron and Seamus’ exuberance had made him overconfident. Maybe his skills were rustier than he’d realised—he’d lost a year, after all, and had not played a proper game in longer than that. He tried to tell himself another player was just quicker or more talented. He couldn’t always be remarkable, and he hadn’t attended any fancy camps like Olivier Rivers. But the timing was lousy. It was hard not to wonder if the news played a role. Had they simply decided against having such a high profile player? It probably wasn't worth the risk, especially if the
Harry was too exhilarated to even make it to the bedroom. In a fit of foolishness, he cornered Draco against a wall in the corridor, kissing him deeply.
“What else, then?”
The tropical flock sensation didn’t settle until long after they had left Tennyson’s studio. It was early yet to have lunch, so Harry had suggested he and Draco take a walk in muggle London. He wanted to be anonymous, if just for a while.
“It’s a comic!”
Malfoy very kindly fired off an
Metatron arrived Sunday morning with a note from Narcissa Malfoy in response to Draco's request the evening prior regarding the acquisition of a publicist.
Draco’s arm tightened around Harry’s middle in response. “Sometimes, a hurt child needs a bit of smothering, I suspect. Preferable to the alternative."
For the life of him, Harry couldn’t understand what the boys had been up to the last few days. Scorpius stopped suddenly, a hand raised to his chest, his pale cheeks aflame from the exertion. For a moment, Harry was terrified. He couldn’t just let Malfoy’s kid die in the garden. Then Scorpius started to speak. Harry didn’t know what the boy was saying—the glass was double-paned, and the two were standing a ways off—but Al seemed to be transcribing the words hurriedly.
“Seen Tiering this morning?” Harry tried, and, he suspected, failed, at sounding casual.
“Are more eighth years interested in playing?” Harry asked, a bit skeptical. So far as he knew, a few less than keen students had been roped in already, he wasn’t sure both teams would remain at seven players a side for much longer. Even Neville had agreed to give it a go for the sake of a full team last time...and by the queasy expression on his face by the end of the match, Harry suspected there wouldn’t be a repeat performance, despite Ginny’s many encouraging whoops and wolf whistles from the stands.
“Potter, you oblivious, irresponsible cock-up,” he seethed dangerously, surging forward until he was nearly chest-to-chest with Harry. His hand was gripping his wand, but it wasn’t raised. Harry stood his ground. “And you,” Malfoy spat, whirling on Albus, “you reckless fucking—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“These are my other grandparents,” Lily confirmed Draco’s assumption. “They’re dead.”
“You could start with not being...you know, an
“Right,” he said, finally. “I think we’ll have to do something about that.”
“S’alright,” Harry called out, encouragingly “next time!”
Draco stepped back and gave Harry a shrug as if to say, go for it.
Harry grinned and swiped his tongue experimentally across Draco’s cockhead. The vaguely unpleasant taste of precum was instantly made worth it by the strangled yelp of surprise that sounded overhead.
“I don’t want anything from you, sweetheart,” Harry promised. “And I won’t let anyone take you. You’re perfectly safe.”
Clark nodded and stood, shooting a warning glare at Harry, “Today, Potter, you better not fuck me.”
“And would you and Harry get more pieces for my train set? You know, for Constance.”
And so, they entered Lily’s bedroom, which was painted in vivid purples and greens. There were five posters: two Quidditch (the Cannons and the Harpies) and three Godiva Greatstrides, a brown haired, olive-skinned cartoon girl with a bun fixed high atop each side of her head. A messy bookcase was in one corner of the room, and a white dresser with golden handles in the other. The bed was large and canopied with white and canary yellow tulle. Potter sat himself down on it, swinging his legs up and awkwardly shuffling himself up against the headboard, holding the baby securely to his chest.
Draco was thankfully spared from answering that particular line of questioning by the reemergence of Potter, hair damp and with a vague scent of cedar about him.
Harry thought that was a bit of a stretch. “Er, I would. It’s just the castle’s on fire, and—”
Scorpius gave her a timid smile. “Hello,” he said.
Draco pictured his meal that morning: the poached egg wobbling atop the buttered rye and sprinkled with black pepper, the tea in the white china cup with a chip in the rim, Scorpius' expression of affectionate exasperation. It was only that that gave Draco pause. He was loath to forget a single moment with Scorpius. He shook his head; he was being too sentimental by half. How many such breakfasts had he forgotten? Few meals were novel enough to twig long term memory storage, and this one would soon join the years’ worth of unremembered mornings, with or without the spell.
Draco granted him a small smile, clamping down on the outlandish one that threatened to bloom on his face because they
“I mean, compared to you, my childhood was butterflies and posies.”
“Yeah?” Harry sounded surprised but appreciative. He gave Draco that warm smile again, and yes, Draco definitely needed to get the man alone, if just for a little while. “Alright, that sounds good, then. Ron, do you think you and Hermione could watch the kids for a bit? I can make them some lunch before I go…”
not!” Despaired Harry, collapsing his head in his hands.
” Albus fired back. “Professor, help! Make it stop!”
“Starkers,” Draco muttered, “absolutely starkers.”
“I wouldn’t dare,” Draco promised, his tone light. He breathed against Harry’s skin, and then added much more quietly, “You’re mine as much as I am yours, you know.”
“Come on, Constance,” Harry pleaded, “We have to go.”
Harry and Father remained just like that as the teasing air fell away, and both their expressions became once again solemn—a temporary distraction replaced by the remembrance of reality.
Harry ignored the message, and instead returned to his dormitory. He rifled through his trunk looking for his map. To his consternation, he couldn’t seem to find it. He was sure he’d tucked it right here, alongside—
“Luck,” Harry murmured, giving her arm a gentle nudge.
“Why can’t you?” Harry asked as Draco knelt, directing Harry’s foot to the leg hole of his pants like he was a child. “You’re doing it now.”
“Do I have...a buddy?” Harry ventured, still feeling like he should do more.
Draco smirked back at him, “I’m sure whatever you need to say can be said in front of our friends, here.” Draco gestured to Hermione, Pansy and Neville. The girls gave each other exasperated, knowing looks, but Neville looked concerned.
Harry answered Ron's question this time.  “That’s not what she said. But, like, think about it, mate. Dumbledore would never have fallen for something so obvious or so, I don’t know, juvenile. Those first efforts, I'd be willing to bet they were nothing but stalling tactics. It doesn’t erase what happened to Katie and what happened to you, and I’m not saying it was right, but it doesn’t make him a killer.” Harry contested, giving voice to debates he'd had with himself over these last few weeks, when so much of his ruminations had involved analysing Draco's past and present. “Besides when it came down to it, he couldn’t do it. I was there that night, when Snape—anyway. I was there and Draco didn't do it. He couldn't, that’s not who he is, I believe that.”
Harry kissed him first, a bit gentler this time, then he reached out, wrapping his hand around Draco’s warm, eager cock. Malfoy was biting his own lip this time, jaw clenched, fingers furling and unfurling against the stone wall as Harry adjusted to the sensation of him.
Harry rose and stepped round the small coffee table until he stood in front of his son. He crouched and reached out, touching Jamie’s cheek with a tentative palm. For once, the boy didn’t cringe away at the affectionate gesture.
“How’d you guess?” he grinned. The bed wasn’t really built for two, and they crammed together, face-to-face.
“What’s this place?” Clark asked, looking up at the crisp white exterior of Gringotts.
“Apologies,” Harry told the animal. “I didn’t mean to be tiresome.”
“Right.” Harry studied the healer—Zerk—again. He was also in jeans with some dark trainers that were sleek, and soft and fitted. He was compact, probably Draco’s height, but more muscular, and he had one ankle propped up on his knee. “Are you a mind healer?” Harry asked.
From beside him, Scorpius heard Fife made a smug noise.
“You know, Clark,” Harry said, trying to sound cheerful, “I bet Draco here has never seen anything on telly. Why don’t we watch something.”
Draco gave him a shaky half smile, “I suppose it’s something.”
“Please, Harry,” he begged, “I’ll make it good for you, I promise.”
Harry only shrugged, “Caring for someone helps. Coaching quidditch helps, and same with trying to sort out that mess at school. I just can’t…think too much about things. For you, I suppose, It helps to focus on yourself, not in a bad way, I don’t mean. You just know your own mind. For me, it’s different. I have goals, sure, but it's sometimes better if I avoid introspection.  I'm not saying I'm some selfless saint, I just need to keep my mind busy that way, you know, externally. And, well, Draco loves to be focused on, so, it works.”
“I didn’t say it wasn’t,” Ron grumbled. “But I’ve not heard from you all summer. That’s not friendship either.”
“You paddling upstream, mate,” Ron informed Draco from his other side, “Harry never quite gets it.”
Draco took a seat on the sofa opposite of him. The Firewhisky burned its course down his throat. It was, he admitted, a bit startling. It had been years since he’d had the stuff.
“I guess,” the girl allowed. “Jamie said I have to set the table. We never eat at this table as a family except for at Christmas, if we don’t go to Granny’s. But we almost always go to Granny’s. But Jamie sits here sometimes, when he says he'll lose it if he has to stare at Al's smug little face for even a moment longer.”
“Teddy’s a metamorphmagus,” Harry explained, “but he won’t get control of it until he’s a bit older. So some days the changes are pretty rapid fire, and usually hilarious.”
“Can’t work up the nerve to cross the centre line,” he admitted with a guilty look, and Harry gave him a friendly smile.
That wasn’t all that he needed to ponder on, however. There was also the news that his grandmother, an accused Death Eater who had been complicit in two wars, was being released from Azkaban. He knew very little of his grandmother. Father had said she was a cold woman, who had spoilt him nonetheless, but who had been too weak to stand up against the Dark Lord and his cruelty. Father had said her actions at the end of the war, in helping Harry, were just a selfish bargain to save her own hide and Father’s. Scorpius wondered if he’d ever meet her. He wondered if she really would end up tucked away in the Manor while he and Father spent more and more time with the Potters. He wondered if prison had changed her, and what she was like, and if she knew about him or wanted to meet him. Most of all, he wondered if
“Tell me,” he ordered, as Hermione heated the kettle and they sat down at the table.
Within an instant, sparkling, golden paths of crowded footsteps appeared throughout the great hall, marking Clark’s comings and goings over the past several months.
“I could tell!” Frederick smiled, coming around the counter to clap James and Albus on their respective shoulders, and shaking Scorpius’ hand. He turned his head towards some royal purple curtains that led to what Draco assumed was a workshop. “Oi! Dad, some right pesky customers here need a talking to, you’ll want to come out here!” Frederick gave the boys a wink to let them in on the joke.
It wasn’t any of his business, and he half expected to be told off by the tiny, sharp-tongued Ravenclaw.
Draco tensed. His voice was guarded when he replied, “It’s who I am, Potter. I have things I want to achieve and I think about how I’m going to go about them. Is that a problem?”
Ron looked for a moment like he was going to argue, but then simply cleared his throat.
“What if I’m not?” Potter blurted out. He seemed both shocked and horrified at the very words flying out of his mouth, but also powerless to stop them.
“Good on ya,” Dean smiled.
“Merlin, Ron,” Harry huffed with exasperation. He could understand Ron being hurt, but this behaviour was verging on childish. “When were we last Aurors together, truly? Not since Jamie was born and I switched departments. And now I’m down Ginny’s income,” then, under his breath he added, “as well as the Galleons she helped herself to from our joint account.”
“Doesn’t he know that you wouldn’t do that? You’re Al’s professor, for goodness’ sake!”
“Generally speaking, I’m not sure. All I know is second hand from Granger—she’s in another meeting with McGonagall, but she’s been in to see you—It was as though...those messages whoever-it-is has been sending, they were amplified. Instead of just going to one Slytherin, they went to all of us. I felt it, heard her come in, but I shut her out so fast I didn’t hear what she said. Those of us who’ve heard her before didn’t respond, because we recognised it, but students who hadn’t heard it—they took it to heart. Apparently she said, I don’t know the wording, but basically that other students were threats, that Slytherins needed to protect themselves, that it was urgent.
“Ah yes, of course,” Draco obliged. “Then if you could just point me in the direction of the clothes cauldron, I’ll leave you be.”
Draco shook his head slowly, smirking. “Honestly, Potter, I think that old sorting hat is utterly daft. You’d have made an absolutely
“Did you pick up Clark some pajamas like I asked?” Harry asked, shaking his head at their silly banter and trying to ignore the happiness that crept into him upon hearing it.
“That may well be the most depressing sentence I’ve ever heard uttered aloud.” Harry jumped at the sound of Draco’s voice approaching from behind the sofa where he and Ron were slumped together. “Honestly, Ron, Kreacher’s so old he's very nearly an animated corpse. No one should be reliant upon him.”
Harry searched Draco’s expression for a protracted moment. The other boy appeared stoic, determined, but there was a flash of fear there that Harry didn’t like.
Harry stood up and walked over to the wizard who was organizing things. The man tapped him with his wand on the middle of his forehead, “
Draco snorted, "History suggests otherwise."
“Hello Mother,” Draco said in lieu of an apology. If his mum didn’t want chaos, she wouldn’t invite the lot of them to visit. He stepped neatly around his trunk to kiss her cheek. She squeezed his hands briefly.
"I'll run it by Hermione, see if we can't turn the DA into some sort of inter-house mentorship type thing. I dunno, if both him and Hiram are struggling, I'm sure they're not the only ones. We'll come up with something."
There was a small red scab forming over where Scorpius’ incisor had broken skin on Jamie’s knuckle.
“Kiss me, would you?”
“What was your dream about?” Harry asked, “It must have been pretty terrible for you to cast so powerful of a spell while not even conscious.”
“You sure?”
“It’s an imperfect solution,” Father sighed.
Al scoffed. “Scared of Januarius Boone? Scorpius, you could be the right hand of
“Yeah, of course,” Harry shrugged nonplussed. He slid the blueberry crumble into the oven.
“Of course you would know where the kitchens are,” Malfoy said disdainfully, “go down there for a proper meal when what’s served to the masses isn’t up to snuff?”
“Ugh,” Albus shuddered. “Is my Dad going to say horrid things like that once he’s my professor, too?”
“The one and the same,” Fort replied excitedly. “And it worked!”
“Enough,” Harry barked, stepping back, Merlin, he was going to make the other boy pay, “Clothes off. Now.”
CWs: (contains spoilers so scroll past if you wish to avoid!)
“I’m sure the healers can get him sorted,” Harry assured the boy, with a measure of false confidence.
“How’s the foundation?” he asked instead.
Draco closed his eyes for a suspended moment, trying to think of what he wanted. What he didn’t want was the responsibility of having to choose what came next; that was all he ever did. Finally, he forced himself to look at Harry, who was still towering over him, broad and perfectly, suffocatingly close. “I don’t want to decide,” Draco confessed honestly. He tried to pretend his voice wasn’t trembling. “I want you to do all that. Is that alright? I just want to be overwhelmed. Used hard. Please, Harry.”
“Oh, fucking hell, I didn’t mean…”
“Of course.”
Draco gave a single, brief nod.
None of the children even blinked at the idea of their former professor in a same-sex relationship. Harry could scarcely believe how much things had changed since he was a child, in so many ways.
“No!” Draco insisted, “Stay, please, stay. It’s good, it’s really good. Just. Big. Intense.”
Potter, with a mouthful of eggs, turned his attention to his second son.
“Harry,” Draco interrupted and for one terrifying moment, Harry was sure all his dreams were going to be flung back in his face. Or worse, Malfoy would laugh, because Harry was eighteen and hopelessly sentimental. But Merlin, he just wanted someone of his own, had wanted that his whole life probably, and now when it finally felt like he had it, it was going to be ripped away with a curled lip and snide remark.
The mortification of it all brought him out of his reverie. It was an unforgivable misstep. The thrum of adrenaline had made him bold and arrogant. What had he expected would happen? That Potter, clearly exhausted and freshly heart-broken—and so far as Draco knew, not at all interested in men—would reciprocate the attraction? That he would pin him against the study door and finish what he had started moments earlier? It was pure delusion, and now Draco was to face James, who looked more and more like his father with every passing breath, in the autumn? Merlin, would Draco be suffering daily for his brash mistake until all the Potter spawn had graduated?
Later that night, Harry had crept into Malfoy’s bed. Somehow over the last few weeks it had become routine—always Draco’s bed, never Harry’s. Harry suspected Draco liked making Harry come to him.
Dinner was chaos. Jamie looked generally irritated—Teddy had left to do a bit of travelling before his term resumed and Jamie was clearly feeling the loss—and the rest of the kids were hyped-up with each other’s company. Hugo, a fidgety child a year or so younger than Lily was desperately trying to get a word in edgewise, but was being chronically sidelined by his sister and Harry’s lot who were laughing about something Harry couldn’t follow at all. Ron was sullen and withdrawn, but thankfully Hermione and Draco were managing to make pleasant conversation.
“Yeah, of course,” Jamie agreed as if he knew all that already. He tried to memorise the facts to share with Ri later. But Merlin, there was so much to know, and Malfoy seemed to know all of it. He was endlessly tossing out little titbits like this while they worked.
That evening, with everyone else having gone home and Remy dozing in his swing, Harry knocked on Jamie’s bedroom door. The boy had been hiding out there since dinner, which had been an unpleasant affair with too much sniping. The door opened slowly and James stood there looking uncertain.
“Yeah,” Clark answered, wrapping his hands around the mug. He took a sip. “Thanks for this.”
“Why’s she so discounted?”
Harry sighed and leaned up against the solid instructor’s desk at the front of the room, “Kid’s just had it tough and I don’t think he’s had a lot of people to talk to about it. I think he needed some comfort and didn’t know he was allowed to ask for it. It was strange, though, he locked me in there for a moment.”
“There will be no Paulo, nor any taking of lovers.”
Ginny gave a confirmatory nod from the Gryffindor table, and starting to rifle through her satchel, presumably to find the aforementioned list.
The audience responded accordingly, hushed only when the wizard flourished a hand to indicate silence.
“Harry,” Draco’s voice was a subtle warning. “Sit down.”
“Tiering was in his dorm. You were in the library,” Harry nodded to Malfoy.
Slytherin. No blind ambition to speak of.”
“No,” Hermione replied, “but there have been lulls in incidents before. I mean, there is a chance that whoever is doing this doesn’t know about the amulets yet and is still trying to sort out why her little trick isn’t working any more. Once she does figure it out, though,  it’s only a matter of time before she gets someone in the shower, or who forgot to transfer their button over from their pajamas to their day clothes.”
will print just to garner an audience.”
Draco acquiesced, clasping his hands on the table in front of him. His wrist landed in something gummy and cold, and he lifted his arm to examine some days old strawberry jam smeared there. Potter raised his wand and Draco flinched reactively.
Harry flung his head back on the sofa, “I sound like a child, whinging about not getting my own way.”
once he’d tugged the drapes closed behind him.
Harry found that he liked watching Draco teach. He liked his attentiveness, his energy and competence. For all his whinging, Draco rose to the task admirably, and while his demeanor wasn’t what anyone could describe as warm, he wasn’t being a total arsehole either, much to Harry’s relief.

Harry eased his head down, kissing the back of Draco’s shoulder in a way that sent a spray of gooseflesh down his arm.
“Not a big fan of the silent treatment, personally,” Harry remarked, “or of not being around you, if I’m being honest.”
“And I’m inviting you tonight, Malfoy, because our agreement was that you would make steps to demonstrate interhouse unity," Harry concluded, ignoring the obvious displeasure of the other two, "DA is great opportunity for us to do so.”
“That’s alright,” Scorpius assured him. “I’d take a butterbeer over pudding anyway.”
“Yes, alright, but it will mean no pudding this evening. You’ve had plenty of sweets already today.”
“Do you smell that?”
“Well, at the very least we could ask McGonagall if they were properly vetted,” Harry suggested, “Mischief managed.”
“Mother wouldn’t have asked the performers if she didn’t trust them, and your friends care too much about your safety to reveal the trickery.”
“No,” he said. “You don’t. What you needed was to atone. You needed to give something up, you needed to give this to me.”
“Just a moment, mate,” Harry called back, then to Malfoy, “Tea?”
Draco gave them both a look saying he would certainly be doing no such thing.
“I thought you and Malfoy were getting along alright,” Hermione pointed out, “He’s agreed to take a Quidditch team, even.”
“Sorry,” Potter replied earnestly, his tone on an even keel and his hands still moving gently over Draco’s head and neck and back. “It’s just—You seem upset.”
“Why have we got to leave if Professor Malfoy says we needn’t?” Albus demanded.
without that oddly comforting burden. “Yeah,” he said, finally, “Yeah, that might be alright.”
Harry returned the teacups to the kitchen. Afterwards, he found Draco in the hallway bathroom, a towel tucked neatly around his hips, working a shave cream into a lather. Harry watched him for a moment and then stepped forward.
Draco’s voice was in his ear now. “It’s working. Harry, whatever you’re doing, it’s working.”
“For a couple of years, perhaps,” Mr. Weasley remarked, “We were closer to your Aunt Bellatrix’s age."
“It’s fine. Get on with it.”
“Alright, Tiering?” Harry asked.
. He looked up at Fort’s intrusion. She appeared slightly breathless, as if she’d run all the way here, and Januarius was scowling at her shoulder. Ri did
“If you need to be fucked so badly, show me where.”
Thank you to everyone who read/kudosed/commented on the last chapter. You're very lovely and good and kind!!!!
“Let’s just get out of the bathroom and track down some tea and the Headmistress,” Harry determined. “Then I’ll fill you all in.”
“I guess you’re right,” Clark murmured. He shuffled closer. Draco finally relaxed. This he knew how to do. He wrapped an arm around those bony shoulders and gave a comforting squeeze.
Harry exited the memory then, having gotten what he needed.
“How’s this, then,” Zerk offered, kindly, “you don’t have to justify him to me. People end up in relationships for all sorts of reasons, but usually, it’s because they care about the other person. Doesn’t sound any different for you.”
"Whatever for?" Harry asked, surprised.
“I hope you don’t think I’ll be getting in another one of those death machines,” Draco sniffed, “I don’t see why muggles haven’t come up with teleportation.”
“Trying or not, that is exactly what you’re being,” Harry pointed out.
“Like you said. Felt trapped. Powerless. But I liked how much you were liking it, too, like you couldn’t resist, you wanted me so badly.”
“Leave it, Potter, I kicked her out didn’t I? Fucking hell.” He glanced around the toilet as if trying to locate her, but she was nowhere to be found.
“Do Master and his boyfriend want breakfast in bed?”
“Have a toffee, first,” Harry insisted.
“Yeah,” Ron hurried to agree. “Of course. Of course I am.”
Harry frowned. This again. Draco’s harping on about it made Harry uncomfortable. He felt Draco’s arm press more firmly against his own, as though he had sensed Harry’s irritation, and Harry exhaled. The words were just to fortify Lily, he told himself. It wasn’t atonement. Draco had promised that, and at some point, Harry was just going to have to believe him. He allowed himself to lean into the touch.
Harry knelt awkwardly on top of the comforter and muttered a
I really need to learn to be less attached to my characters so I can actually sustain a fight for more than a chapter. My conflict aversion is showing!
“I’m beginning to understand why you opted to hide out after your wife left,” Draco mused, holding the door of the shop open for Harry to enter. “This much attention is unpleasant on the best of days.”
“What do you mean?”
They arranged themselves in the broad canoe-shaped boat. Once they were seated, the little vessel set off, following the dark course of the stream. The water, Harry realised after some time, was flowing upward. The sensation reminded Harry of an amusement park ride he had been on once with Dudley—before the Dursleys realised they could just leave him behind with Mrs. Figg and save themselves the entrance fee—but with none of the mechanical whirring.
Harry thought it might be the first thing Malfoy had said to him that wasn’t dripping in sarcasm since this whole thing began.
’. Forbidding Potter from all this nonsense outside of the bedroom would create a clear delineation, Draco reckoned. But it would also be a lie, and Draco was finding Potter a difficult man to lie to. Draco watched him pour the tea, remaining casual and patient, as though Draco’s response wouldn’t deter him either way. It seemed needlessly cruel to deny him, especially when Draco didn’t really mind. In fact he found all that contact maddeningly reassuring. Draco didn’t wish to need reassurance. He was quite put out to discover this impulse inside him.
“A lie of omission,” Draco dismissed, reeling Harry in and pressing his face into his neck. “You’re so hung up on principles.”
“Did you hear something?” the man at the top of the stairs demanded,
“Didn’t—” Draco exhaled roughly, “Didn’t hold it for long.”
“A simple set of six drills: comet chasers, pass-and-block, deke-splits—”
Jared didn’t know why his mum couldn’t drink if she was thirsty, but Clark made it sound important.
Harry blinked and took a breath, forcing himself to just put one foot ahead of the other, to feel the warm solidity of Draco beside him. He tried to wash out the vicious words and angry blotchy faces illuminated by the bright lights of the pier.
“You alright, sweetheart?” He asked and Draco nodded emphatically.
“He really didn’t,” Draco agreed, “Which is not to say that
There was a long silence and Harry began to suspect Malfoy wasn’t about to answer. To his surprise, the other boy cleared his throat and said softly, “Because it takes me ages to get anywhere and I’d rather not give anyone the satisfaction of noticing. Sign of weakness and all that.”
“All this?” Teddy parrotted. “You mean her life?”
“Not bad, right?” Albus urged.
Lily looked up at him from the pavement, her blue eyes wide with surprise and her nose streaming blood. There was a suspended moment of silence and then she began to wail.
She placed his wand and watch in a slender wooden case.
He tossed it face up on the table. It read:
“It never hurts to look one’s best,” Draco told him. What he didn’t say was that decent clothes could serve as armour from scorn and derision, and were a tool Draco clung to in times when he had very little freedom from either. He resolved not to give the Granger-Weasleys an opening, if he could help it, even if Scorpius looked rather prim compared to Al, who was standing there in a T-shirt and jeans, with his hair sticking up in short, casual spikes which observed no adherence to symmetry or order.
“Merlin, Dean!” Harry gulped, giving the boy a friendly shove with his shoulder. He was flushed red, still not used to talking about his sex life openly, but he felt a hopeful sense of solidarity, also.
Draco hummed happily into Harry’s skin, soaking the afterglow, knowing the mess in his pants would prevent him from enjoying it for long.
“Oh shove off,” Harry said, tiredly, but he found himself repressing a smile. It was admittedly, a bit ludicrous.
“Sorry, Professor,” he grumbled.
Clark whispered something that Harry couldn’t make out.
They were falling ever deeper, Draco knew, braiding together the strands of their histories into a comforting tether. These pieces, once given, could not be revoked, and yet...he couldn’t bring himself to regret the indelibility of it all. Indeed, it was likely he’d been spooled in by exactly that. Draco had known so little of permanence when it came to people, that even the barest
Scorpius was trying to break up an argument between Jamie and Al in the drawing room. In contrast, faint, joyful screams were heard from the garden where Ron was busy chasing Lily and Rosie about. Hermione was in the kitchen, presumably preparing a bottle, and shouting at the boys to stop their bickering.
“That’s incredible,” Harry reaffirmed, “Remarkable, honestly.”
Harry groaned, “One step forward two steps back with this damn paper. I thought with Rita Skeeter focusing on her ridiculous ‘independent investigations’ we wouldn’t have to contend with this nonsense.”
Granger poured herself a cup of tea. Draco forced his eyes open, looking at her empty plate and his own full one, the ice cream melting into a puddle converting the crumble into a little island with steep, treacherous fjords. Harry would want him to take a few bites at least. He toyed with his fork.
“You’ll notice that all parties are speaking their spells aloud,” Neville explained, “this is just for demonstration purposes. In your own combat, we encourage you to try for wordless magic, so your opponent doesn’t know what’s coming.”
Harry eased from a bite to a kiss. He abandoned Malfoy’s erection to wrap both hands around the man’s ribs, holding him in place as he raised his head to meet Malfoy’s firm, pink lips.
“And this?” The healer repeated the gesture in front of the other ear and again, Clark assented.
Meat Pie eyed Harry coolly, then turned his head to expose exactly where he’d like to receive more scratches prior to agreeing to Harry’s tedious request. Harry chuckled and gave the bird what he wanted.
“I know, but if I don’t do them I will just be thinking about them the whole time. When I kiss you, I want to think about kissing you.”
Harry considered the words. He thought how lucky he was to have been co-opted into this loving, bustling family, as well.
“Hm,” Draco supposed, pulling forth a phial, “See anything sad enough in his head to make you cry?”
Draco came with a strangled cry collapsing inwards, pressing his forward to Harry’s clavicle. Harry stroked his hair, kissed his head.
Clark’s freckled cheeks were stained pink and his brows were furrowed in his earnest irritation.
To Draco’s surprise, Potter’s chest rumbled as he let out another low chuckle. “And you didn’t think of letting me in on your perceptions of this as a sort of one-and-done exchange? Surely you know that’s not really my approach.”
“Erm, what?” he asked eloquently.
Draco bit his lip. “Not really. I let Father think I was taking his lead, although I never wrote to him to confirm it. I thought after word started getting out about our sexual relationship, he would be furious. He'd always despised my penchant for blokes, and I was prepared for him to disown me for going public. Instead, he assumed I was whoring myself out to improve my status and his, and it’s okay to be bent for that, apparently.”
Thank you all so much for your really thoughtful and encouraging comments on the last chapter. I can't tell you what it meant to me <3 <3 <3
