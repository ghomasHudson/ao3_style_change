"Albus enough of this!" she screamed at him once she entered the room and took at look at him and sighed she knew he wasn't going to clam down anytime soon and then looked at Severus by the door.
"Hadrian me and Tom have something to say to you and I hope that you are ok with this" said Severus catching his son attention even though he was blushing up a storm.
Grandparents:
They laughed again at the image it brought them, soon they were in Hogsmeade.
"Stop it~" whined Harry as he tried to bat his father's hands away from his head while the man laughed at him.
He slowly opened the door, only to be hit with the smell of blood, he looked around the room but it was too dark to see. "Lumos" he whispered, he gasped in shock at the sight in front of him. Harry lay bloody and bruised in a small corner of the room. Severus could hear a faint whimper coming from the boy. He walked closer only for Harry to flinch away and whisper "I'm sorry sir, I'll be more quiet. Please sir I won't disobey you again. Just don't hit me" Severus could only stare at the boy in shock.
I would like to have you back as a friend, I miss my best mate, you were the first person that saw me as Harry nothing more. My name might of changed but I am still the same person! Can you deny me something that I never had but have only just got which you have always known?" he asked but Ron said nothing and walked off.
Dinner was a very fun event in its self really, everyone still had animal ears and tails and coloured hair and every so often fireworks would be going off as well as the fire crackers, one went off right under the staff table making Dumbledore squeak due to having mouse ears.
"I wish you wouldn't open someone else's presents or go through our personal belongings Hadrian, you are now almost 14 years old you don't have to do what a child would" said Narcissa as she drank another non potion laid cup of coffee.
"Yes Otiz how can I help you?"
"...I would like you all to welcome Professor Remus Lupin who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Now enough of that..."
"Damn, stupid animal" was all Ron had to say to her but she said nothing more and carried on with her lecture on the hardening spell.
Shock wasn't the word that took hold of the Great Hall it was digust!
"Wow! Otiz like!" was all he said making Harry almost fall over as Otiz jumped in his arms.
Dumbledore had giant mouse ears that matched his hair
"Sorry Mister Snape I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable it's just fascinating he is able to transform into three different types; animal, child and of I had my guess teenager" and he started circling Otiz again.
Fred and George came into the hall sporting bright green Slytherin hair and Fred had green rabbit ears while George had green cat ears.
"Come along Hadrian"
Date of Birth: 31st July 1980
"Who does that bird belong to?" only to have the door open again to reveal Severus with Tyki on his shoulder nuzzling his beak into his hair.
"Come on son, I know you love this place but remember we can always come back. Now stop your silly complaining" and he ruffled his son's hair and smiled.
The rest of the idiots could wait she was more important than anyone else!
She screamed making Flitwick stopped his lesson on the Full Body Bind Curse.
"I know it why didn't you say of sooner! I loved that place!" said Draco to everyone.
"That's Hadrian?" asked an astonished  Draco
Then they picked Harry up again and brought him back into the Great Hall where they were just in time to hear the start of the prank.
"Welcome back third years, this year we will revise Mandragora or better know as Mandrakes, and the severing charm as well as Puffapods and Stinksap as well as de-fanging vampiric vegetation" said Pamona to the class as she went on about what they would learn in finer detail, the strange began to wander the classroom.
"Well we are expected on the following day after Yule so..." said Severus to his son who was now half asleep which made him smile towards him, it was late after all, ten hours on the train for Harry and an awful end of term teachers meeting was not what Severus called fun and so they headed up to bed.
Everyone sat back down.
As they sipped their fire whiskey and ran over everything Narcissa walked into the room and sighed, she hated when these two got together, yes it was to do with her godson, her nephew in her eyes but.. drinking at eleven am was stupid didn't they have something better to do than that!
Crash! Bang! Kaboom!!
Elijah Noah Clarks, 64 years older, dirty blond hair and blue eyes. Hallie's father and a retired Police Officer. AKA Eli
Poppy came out of her room after counting her stores and making a list of the ones she needed to hand to the potions professor.
"I'm not Harry Potter" said Harry loud enough to be heard but Jacob didn't believe that, and smirked "you are Harry Potter you are a spitting of James Potter one of the best seekers of all of Hogwarts history and so are you Harry!! Why in Godric Gryffindor did you leave?" shouted Jacob to the now whimpering and shaking Harry.
"They got thrown up there and Hadrian and Otiz were helping me get them down when you pushed him over".
"...something..."
She's an eleven year old saying that she wanted to kill someone just to get their hands on a fortune that she would never get as he is no longer a Potter... I can't believe....." he never got to finish as his magic snapped around them.
"If you at all says it hurts we will stop I promise" said Poppy.
"Court case of one Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape and Severus Tobias Snape vs. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore HSSSAD- 264726 has come to court, date is November 16th, time is 10am".
"Harry before we leave I would like to ask you to hold your tongue with Draco, I will admit he can be very bull headed with what he can say and do but just remember if you aren't sure of anything I will help you. Lucius is most likely telling Draco the same thing but more sternly" with that he grabbed hold of Harry, bringing him to his chest and called out Malfoy Manor.
Harry sat in the middle of the table in a dark green shirt and black trousers and shoes, Severus you guessed it black... the bat was in full mode!
"I wish we could see that type of smile more Sev" whispered Tom to him only to get a nod from him.
Severus took it upon himself to calm his son down, he was picked up and brought into a cuddle, his head on Severus' shoulder hugging him close.
"That boy the insufferable dungeon dweller, I need to get that brat back on the right side and not have that snarky dungeon dweller have him otherwise my whole plan will be ruined and I can't have that".
"Minerva please!" Severus almost, and I mean almost jumped to his feet in complete shock.
"C..Ca...can we...go...h...home...now?" muttered Harry to his father making his sigh again.
"So Poppy hasn't told you yet? well I was informed just recently that Mr. Potter's household currently at the residents of 4 Privet Driver is unsafe for the child. Albus he's a young boy, a second year at that, he has been abused since he was three years of age......" Severus replied sadly. Dumbledore could only stare back incomplete shock "Severus my boy, I'm afraid that I'm aware of this already. It is only safe that he is with fami-" Albus was soon interrupted by Severus' uncontrolled temper. "Albus how dare you! He has had way to many near death experiences just in the past two years from his uncle's beatings! If you won't take him out of that damn household I will remove him myself. I am not bluffing. Good evening, Headmaster" and with that Severus stormed out of Dumbledore's office, only to leave behind a very shocked blue eyed man.
This was when Harry and Draco notice that Otiz wasn't next to them and Harry started to panic.. Otiz was always there with him but now he wasn't.
"Get behind me now!" said Sirius pulling her behind him, his wand in hand pointing it at where the sound had come from.
"I found Hadrian beaten and bloody, he had many broken bones and lacerations, scars and bruises all in different stages of healing many were infected, it took us most of the summer to get him to what Poppy would say was a reasonable state of health even though he still has to take a nutrition potion three times a day.
"Ok then Hadrian all you have to do is take this dagger and cut your finger and place five drops of blood on this parchment, this will give us your birth certificate, as you already have your adoption certificate, this one will have what you are Lord and Heir too as well.
"Severus what on earth has happened here?" she asked but Severus just shook his head "Minerva I will come and tell you at a later date, now if anyone needs me I'll be in my chambers with my son for the rest of the night" and he walked off into the dungeons.
If you hadn't of guessed she isn't smart at all. Since her wand got taken away from her the magic that it was stealing from Harry has stopped so she has only the intelligence of what a seven year old would have.
Draco, Blaise can you take Otiz for me please, he knows you two more than anyone else in this form. The reason why he's holding onto me is because he doesn't feel safe".
What he got in return was teeth bared at him and a somewhat hiss and growl missed together.
When he said that Hogwarts noticing the magic and the words ripped her house badge of her cloak she was wearing and she disappeared into an unknown room, which only had her book, clothes bed and table in, in a very much smaller room was a shower and a toilet. It looked like she was going to be there for quite a while.
"Why Harry is here to celebrate the holiday with us Ron, why else would be be here for?" said Arthur to his son afterwards looking at Harry.
He had a wardrobe and when he looked in he saw no robes! No Hogwarts school robes! What in Merlin's name was going on?! He picked out what looked like a... plain shirt with a blue and black tie and a pair of black trousers.
They walked up to a counter and to Harry's surprise it was Griphook at the desk, "ah Mister Potter what can I do for you?" he asked the boy who just hid behind Severus making Griphook look at him instead. "Mister Snape what can we at Gringott's do for you and Mister Potter?"
He dragged Harry to the Whomping Willow making Otiz and his friends follow not liking where this was going.
"...little..."
"Excellent Mister Snape one of the very best I have seen throughout my time here, I award you ten points, now off you go and start on your homework and I expect you to be at dinner".
"Severus you mean Harry here is adopted by you?" interjected Remus shocked, he knew Severus would explain everything to him at a later time as they couldn't when they met up but it was now all coming out.
"Severus my boy the child must go back to his relatives, he is safe in the blood wards and his family" Albus snapped back.
The portraits saw what had happened and so went to get Poppy right away and in a flash of green she was standing there in shock.
The boys entered Dervish and Banges and picked up everything that Severus needed and it was a long list, thank Merlin he had Floo'ed ahead and Dervish was happy to give them what was ordered.
He let got of her which she started coughing due to the lack of air that she had.
I have had many complaints about how you have been acting in the tower and I had asked everything to be persented to me via writing and if they consented to it I would gather the memoires of each incident.
Narcissa smiled towards the boy and said "Sev you don't have to explain everything again, after your owl came with the letter explaining everything that had happened to the poor boy we knew we had to step in right away"
Severus had made sure that all three of them were dressed nicely and up to Malfoy standard.
As his new mother talked to Greta about his day his father informed them that he would be taking the girls home while, he Ron/ Max... whatever his name was went with his new mum to his weekly appointment.
"Thank you Runestone that will be all" said Griphook and the Goblin left again.
It was Draco that finally calmed him after he let him rage for another ten minutes.
We also can see some blushing relationships starting we all know about Wolfstar 🐺🎆 and everything but I wonder what is going to happen to Remus John Lupin and Sirius Orion Black?, how is their relationship going to go?
Wand: Basilisk venom and Unicorn hair, 14 1/⁴ inches, durable
He once again stepped a little closer to the boy "Harry it's quite alright. Do you know who I am?" Severus asked his voice gentle. Harry then looked up from the floor to stare at his Professor, he was so confused "P-professor?" Harry's voice wavered, Severus only nodded. "Are you ok? Who did this to you?" Severus asked, Harry then became very interested in the floor, he then started to cry and Severus wasn't sure what to do so he reached out and placed his hand under Harry's chin to lift it up. As soon as Harry looked up, he did something that surprised Severus and himself, he launched himself into Severus' arms.
It had been a harsh last of term, Harry hated every minute of it as the Weasels and Granger has he had now taking to call them as they wouldn't shut up about being adopted by Severus and no matter how they tried they couldn't get him back to Gryffindor Tower and away from the snakes of the dungeons.
"Otiz shuush" said Harry and he kind of stopped only to hide under the table but kept close enough to Harry and Severus ready to protect them at any cost.
"Hadwin me go back to Wolfie man now...bye bye" said Otiz getting off his lap and up to Remus again, who this time didn't protest about the small boy sitting on his lap.
Age 8:
"So true and he prides himself on it" said Remus helping him.
Otiz growled at her and then punched the three boys away from her, no way where they getting involved with her!
"Yes dad?" asked Harry when he came over to his father, smiling at Otiz hugging him within sleep.
"I completely understand Tomas well let's finish this.." the door opened and two Aurors walked in and stood right behind Albus...
"Madam we are after some children's robes for young Otiz here but he is also a familiar to my son Hadrian here, who I think you know as Harry Potter".
"Can I meet him, Harry I mean? When he was younger he was James is he still like that or has he changed?" asked Sirius.
Here is Harry's birth certificate and adoption certificate
Suddenly he was wrapped in total darkness only to hear a strong baritone voice that he knew that belonged to one Severus Snape, his father.
"Now where has that freak gone off too!?" said a gruff voice that both Harry and Severus knew all to well.... Vernon Bloody Dursley.
In the Great Hall, Tom was looking out for the Muggle born that tried for remove him from office for no reason besides she thought he was in the wrong.
"Otiz soon but first we have to put our things away neatly first then we will have lunch, then we will go out and explore the park we have two weeks here" said Severus finally able to catch both his son and familiar at once which had taken him about 20 minutes so far.
"Young Mr. Weasely I would appreciate that you stop now otherwise I have no idea what Hadrian's familiar will do to protect him. Also as he is my son I would like to kindly ask you to stop" and he straightened up and looked Ron right in the eyes.
You all accepted this but each one of you loved how my body became one with each and everyone of you!" and she laughed again making everyone that had let her take advantage of them almost throw up everything that they had eaten.
"Draco Malfoy a pleasure to meet you" and finally they both shook hands.
Laziness
"I'm going to kill the old man" he mutter to himself only to make Fawkes to trill at him happily.
The six friends where shocked at what they had seen, Ronald Weasely was on the floor unconscious of all things thanks to this new.... somewhat familiar person.
Minerva looked at her and said "Miss Granger I would like to remind you Mister Potter is now Mister Snape and I have been told that Otiz here is his familiar and familiar's are allowed no matter what they are. I think he's a hybrid animal anyway".
"Well I was on my way to class when I remembered that I had to speak with Professor Dumbledore and I've tried all the sweets that know but I couldn't get in to speak to him" she looked around the office spotting nothing that she remembered that belonged to Dumbledore.
Severus had decided to take Harry back home for the fortnight of the holiday even though Harry had begged to let him bring Draco along, Severus just said to him "some father and son bonding is needed".
Severus took his son by his hand and led him out of the reptile house and out into the sun once again.
Otiz had by then had her up against the wall so fast no one saw it.
....is next" said the twins as they whispered to each other at the Gryffindor table one morning.
"Come on son time for breakfast, go an have a shower and meet me in the living room ok" and he pushed his son towards the shower.
Severus was out for a few weeks collecting his potion ingredients while Harry enjoyed his summer holidays with his friends.
"Kay Tev, Hadwin hold now?"
"What did you do this time Otiz?" asked Lucius who was now holding the boy who snuggled into to him.
The day of the meeting was here and it looked like that both Minerva and Severus had decided to take the task of Headmaster for the day, half the day each and the rest of it working on completing their lesson plans and marking homework, Harry wasn't happy that he wouldn't be spending the day with his father but when everything was explained to him, he left it and told him that he would be in Hogsmeade with his friends and Otiz.
"Otiz" said Harry and when the cat heard the name he woke up and quickly bit Harry's finger drawing blood which was licked up right away, then nuzzled into his neck mewing.
Has to prove himself
It was two months since school started back up and Harry and Severus were getting ready to Floo to Malfoy Manor to sign the papers making Lucius and Narcissa his official godparents. Harry dressed in a white shirt with dark blue almost black trousers, his robe was of a dark green but it had gold and silver stitching, while Severus wore his usual black robes.
He went over to the Floo and called in the one person he knew would help him.
"Hadrian please"
By the end of the day Severus was exhausted, he never knew that the boy could have so much energy, he had never seen him so excited, running from one place to the next over and over again.
Screw the paperwork! It meant nothing to him, it must of been forged by the bat that was they only reasonable explanation he didn't care that it had the Ministry logo and stamp on it as well as Gringotts all that mattered was that he got his hands back in the brat!
"I'm professor should we go? It seems you have something to talk about, come on guys" said Harry to his friends it was then Sirius noticed Harry's uniform.
In McGonagall's office a faint knok could be heard from outside and so she let them enter only for over half of her lion's to enter, she was shocked.
"He's incredible, just look at him" said Filius circling him this in turn made Otiz growl.
"Nothing besides I woke everyone up as I woke up at 3am and I got bored and then I woke Dray up at 5.30 I think, then slimed him as a quick birthday present, woke everyone up, you all made strange noises while you ate your breakfast is everything alright?" he tilled his head to the side to ask if they knew it was him.
Tom at that point decided to come in holding Harry's trunk that was finally packed after the "help" of Otiz and smiled when he saw that the child was taking a nap.
LaFey- Mother (Lord)
"Albus what has gotten into you, I have never seen you like this, calm down" said Severus to him but it was no use Albus has lost his temper and so his magic was unleashed and flew him across the room and he landed with a thud.
"Very well, Hadrian here has been abused all his life, he no's nothing but pain and guilt. Whatever he did was always wrong and was punished for it even if it wasn't his fault. They wouldn't allow him to eat anything besides scrapes if he was lucky enough to get anything at all, he just had water once maybe twice a day, again if he was lucky.
"Really dad? We have been out most of the day and we come back only to find out that you three have been drinking!"
Age 2:
He could only nod to her, he never wanted to be found out like this........
Without warning Harry had his hand in Otiz' hair making them both calm, right away his ears appeared and he was purring, this made everyone in the common room smile, the hybrid had finally relaxed.
They arrived in the children's section within moments and went to the little boys clothes.
At the end of class Ron stepped right in front of Harry who in turn cowered to him but Otiz being back into his animal form, he was now bright red with anger, static flying everywhere.
Also as you all heard at breakfast I am his father now and I would like each and everyone to look out for him as you can all tell he is very skittish and will hide when he is scared which normally is within my robes of all things.
She walked up the the reception desk and looked at Madam Pince but she ignored the girl and helped another student find their book.
Severus gave the child to his son as he opened up the shop door and let the two boys inside.
Inside the hospital wing Poppy was fussing about like normal and when the door opened she stopped and saw Harry holding his left arm to himself along with Draco and Blaise coming in.
"Everyone sit down and be quite for once in your miserable lives " and he glared at the older years and at a few of the younger as they were still talking quietly.
"Enter" Remus came in and smiled slightly he knew he was right he had smelled Sirius within Hogwarts and it was so strong here in Toms office! Now where was Padfoot?!
"Minerva I can get her a trial and most likely she would be sentenced but becasue she is only an eleven year old, nothing would happen besides having her wand snapped...." said Arthur "...if you want to really go down that route" he turned to Severus for the last part.
Once they landed Molly went on a war path! Not only did she get a letter from the twins, thinking it was a complete joke but to get one of Percy! She knew then something was up but this! Never in her wildest dreams would she have thought that her eleven year old would do that!
The other Aurors picked Ron up by his elbow and dragged him out along with Ginny while the Weasley parents went and talked to Lucius and Severus who now had Harry in his arms still crying his heart out, Otiz growling when they came near him.
"I know but I'm just curious what everyone has since I've only just been able to get everything since..." he didn't say anymore as they knew what he was going to say anyway, in the end he was hit with a cushion from Draco which resulted in a massive pillow fight Malfoy against Snape.
Merlin 4
"Uncle Sev please, we were out in Hogsmeade when Otiz threw Hadrian into a wall, he dragged us back once we managed to get him of Hadrian.
Everyone cried his name as he fell.
"Are you alright young man?" trying to get Harry to talk to him but he just hid more, making Severus sigh.
"Headmaster I will say this one last time Hardian is my son the Ministry has this on file as will as the Goblin's at Gringotts, my son will return home with me".
The Gryffindor table just watched the two retreating out of the Hall.
Fred and George asked one of their female friends to go into the second year dorm room and look around to see if there was anything else they could use against Hermione, their friend was happy too as she was disgusted with what Hermione and Ron had done to poor Harry and she was happy that he finally had someone looking out fo him.
"Yes dad!! I can't wait can we see Mrs. and Mr. Weasley as well as the twins?" he asked almost jumping up and down like an excited child.
Harry washed and changed into his only pair of robes after his 'loving' uncle burned the rest of them, thank god Hedwig managed to fly away before anything could happen to her, as he left the bathroom a cup of hot chocolate was waiting for him and right next to it hooting away as she was being petted by Severus was Hedwig.
Otiz only nodded and then suddenly his hair was yet black with a ever so slight wave to it, he looked like he was a complete mixture of Harry and Severus it was cute.
His uncle also said that he refused to help around the house, that he made his cousin Dudley do everything while he was out playing with his friends at the park".
"Sir don't think that way, by the look of it all it was those people and not you. I would like you to come again free of charge that is, either that let your son pick something out of the souvenir shop, I'll pay for it so don't worry".
"I have the evidence that you have been adopted and that you are now going under your new name but I would need more expensive information and evidence about everything that had been written down in your file.
As they were out for the evening students went about studying after their time in Hogsmeade if they were allowed to go that is and one third year was completely banned until further notice, the teachers weren't going to make an opportunity for her to attack a fellow student if she was in Hogsmeade.
A rescue
That is freak has made the worse mistake out there! He lied to the court, he lied to the Ministry! He's lied about everything!"
"Miss Granger what on earth is this that you've given me?" asked Filius when he came to hand out all of the homework and singled her out!
Hermione knew that she was being shunned just like Ron was but due to her keeping herself to herself mostly it wasn't as quick as it had been with Ron... she just wanted her friend back was that too much to ask?
Harry nodded and practically flew over to his bathroom to have a shower and then spend the day with his father and best friend.
He wiped some tears away from and kissed Severus' forehead, "can you forgive me for being a prat? If so I have a surprise for you in your chambers" he slowly pulled a weepy Severus into his arms.
Eyes narrowed towards the boy, but said boy was about to dart out of the room when another knock on the door was heard and so he went to answer it.
Age 9:
Severus couldn't wait to go to the National Park to look for potion ingredients, from the rare native birds, the bamboo forest and hiking into the volcanic landscape.
They then both looked at Otiz who was still growling at Lupin but then looked at Harry and saw the question in his eyes and so transformed back into his human form.
"It's a pleasure to meet you again Mr. Dumbledore, I think you remember who I am from the last time we met, I am Tomas Marvolo Sötétség".
Poppy had Ravenclaw blue hair and fluffy rabbit ears
Luna- Nuna
The adults sighed and soon they all turned to Severus to deliver the final bit of information.
Draco got up to leave the room, thinking of how he would go about apologising to the boy, who looked so much smaller that he knew from school.
I... I mean we would like something to be done about him, he shouldn't be allowed to treat anyone like this much less so than a young boy" explained Severus to Fudge.
The boys weren't looking forward to going back to the school, Harry was grumbling while he was packing which was slow going as child Otiz was taking the stuff out gain which wasn't helping he was also hiding all of it.
Severus could see what had happened and smiled and chuckled slightly.
"Severus what are you doing here, I asked for Mister Malfoy to bring Mister Potter here" said Albus in his high pitched voice, the twins so trying not to laugh at it.
Draco just mumbled something under his breath but Severus caught it, due to his years of being a spy "Draco please enlighten us of what you have just said" this made the boy jump out of his skin.
"Minster my name now is Hardian Jameson Severus Snape, I'm no longer Harry Potter, as my dad said I was adopted legally and then by blood".
"Daddy, daddy I have the freak! Can we go home now? seeing him has made me want to play a game, plus he has all his missing chores to catch up on. Right mummy?"
Otiz was trying to push Blaise out of the way to get to Harry as this had also become the norm but stopped when Hedwig came flying in landing on the table in front of the three.
Tom along with Poppy and Severus waved their wands over Ron casting a spell that stopped him from talking about the Magical World for as long as he should live.
"Well Miss Granger everything seems to be fine now off you go" and Poppy just walked off saying nothing more.
"Why did that idiot have to take her out of isolation? She's hurt my baby way to much, so did the other two how he trusted them and all of it lost to him..." he was full out crying now and didn't hear the door opening.
"So Gred what shall we do?" asked George to his brother while eating a chocolate frog.
Flitwick looked at the animal and his eyes went wide seeing that it was an Occamy of all this but a very rare one due to her colouring.
In the shop Molly was able to pick out some nice meat for dinner and a few bland vegetables for Ginny's, she paid for them and next they headed for the Ministry.
"Pott- I mean Snape.... Merlin that's freaking, I'm sorry for being an arse to you over the past year or so can we let everything go and finally be friends?" said Draco to Harry who was now looking fully at him while drinking his tea.
Potter- Father (Lord)
"Hey 'mione what's wrong?" asked Ron as he sat down next to her but she didn't hear him as she was still screaming into the cushion, Ginny saw this and slowly pulled the cushion away from her and when they both saw her crying they admitly wanted to ask her what was wrong.
It had now been a week since Ron and Ginny had gotten the Howler and then Molly bursting into the Great Hall, everyone, teachers and students alike minus Dumbledore of all things kept them at a wide birth as they just couldn't believe what they had done to their friend, true enough Ginny didn't know any better as it was her brother that was instigating everything and she was following hook line and sinker.
Severus just nodded, taking a sip of his steaming hot coffee, he sighed and then turned to his son "I knew your mother when we were children, I was the one to tell her that she was a witch, your aunt wasn't happy that your mother could do something she couldn't" and he took another sip of coffee.
The door opened to reveal both Minerva and Tom standing there, they at first watched the girl to see what she did next, which she flipped the table over in anger.
The following morning as the students walked into the Great Hall for breakfast they noticed a man sitting up at the Head Table, a select few knew who he was but they said nothing.
The twinkle in his eyes had gone and he yet again threw everything off his desk including his most precious lemon drops.
"I'm not going to open it!" said Ginny to her brother, Ron tried to give it to either Fred, George or even Percy but each and everyone one of them shoved it away saying that it was addressed to him and Ginny as well as Hermione of all things and that they should open it.
Father figure: Severus Tobias Snape
After lunch was finished they all headed back to the lounge where Draco started to hand out gifts
He was meant to be under Dumbledore's control! He was meant to be!!".
"Lucius this is meant to be a surprise for the end of June beginning of July for their birthdays we need to make it special!" said Narcissa
Severus could tell Tom was trying to butter him up badly he had asked the elves to make his favourite food, everything there he loved, he knew Tom didn't like them much but the way he was doing this it was starting to get hard not to forgive him.
"Yes I thought we could all go for a few weeks between said two boys birthdays, yes we know said two boys will be fourteen but still I think they would love to go" said Severus not completely confusing poor Harry while Draco was more intrigued at the possibility of what this surprise was all about.
In the forest one bushy haired girl was trying her luck to save the day like she thought she could do with no help but she stopped when she noticed Sirius on the floor groaning at being thrown.
"From what?" he glared at his father which was a cuter version of his own glare.
He wanted to know that one word but he had promised so he was going it alone to the best of his ability.
Harry sighed too a deep breath and soon Bogert Vernon was blowing up like a balloon and burst making a horrible but at the same time funny noise this made everyone laugh.
The others just smiled at him knowing that they wouldn't get much more from him until he had finished reading.
Everyone flinched they all knew that voice, he was so passed that they where all late for class and that his son was on the floor next to his godson, nose bleeding and glasses broken.
"Ah Severus just the person I needed to see. I have a list of potions that I'm running out of, could you possibly make some more for me please. Mr. Malfoy why are you here??" she asked them both only to stop at hearing three voice shouting at the only patient in the ward.
I am a familiar and I will protect those I care about, I can smell that you were once both best friends but it changed when Sev adopted Hads here" with a flick of his wand Ron was now lying on the floor unconscious.
"I'm suck I haven't gotten a clue what to do, I miss my Sev" said Tom to no one in particular, he was walking the halls of Hogwarts lost as what to do.
"Very well come along, yes you as well Lupin" said Severus paying for their drinks and leaving the café, once outside Harry handed Otiz his sippy cup with the blood in it.
I could only hug Harry back and whisper soft words of reassurance, once Harry had calmed down he stepped back and looked at his me. "I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to" Harry whispered. "Harry it's fine. The reason I'm here is to take you out of this household, but before I do I have one question" I stated, Harry only nodded.
"I am not!"
The three nodded at the request and Theo took hold of Harry who buried himself into his shoulder when he brought them to the sofa, they noticed that the other side had dipped and when they looked who it was, Harry threw himself into Draco and started crying.
"Well well well..."
"Go sit down next to Mr. Snape and if you're a good boy you might get a sticker" said Minerva and with a flick of her wand another chair was placed next to Harry as well as some colouring books and crayons.
"He looks fine from what I can tell but Hagrid would be better at this than me, mind you Tom is better at the basilisk front" and she smiled "we will have to wait until he's changed back before I can run any tests" and she pottered off back into her office to wait.
"Headmaster you know very well that Hadrian is a scared and shy child after what had happened to him, thank Merlin he lived through it.
Harry's eyes then opened and he nearly jumped out of the bed when hand touch his shoulder. Harry started crying "I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to wake you up" Harry mumbled. "It's ok. Just go back to sleep. I'll see you in the morning".
Tomas Mavolo Sötétség....
Lost in his thought he didn't notice one of the cauldrons bubble and then explode! But due to all his always ready precautions a shield formed right away protecting everyone in the classroom.
"Tev were we go?" asked Otiz as Harry took hold of his hand tightly while they walked through the Leaky Cauldron and into Muggle London.
"Poppy its Hadrian, Fawkes is a fire phoenix and this one is a rainbow phoenix and its Hadrian it looks likes he has tapped into his Anim..." he was cut off when the doors banged open to reveal an out of breath Severus Snape and one Tom Sötétség aka Tom Riddle.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was finally set free from the dreaded hospital wing which he was happy for, the smell was getting to him making him feel sick to his stomach and the watery porridge he was forced to eat that very morning didn't help things, he was only allowed to do his morning classes as he was still slightly weak from yesterday's transformations.
"...along with..."
🌸Puking pastilles
Otiz is a light blue fox with the same coloured eyes as our Harry, he is very protective of Harry, if you want a picture ask me
I was about to leave but felt a tiny hand grasped my wrist, I looked back confused when Harry then asked "Sir, um... can I er sleep with you?" Harry stuttered. I only nodded and picked the boy up, I'm shocked at how light the twelve year old was, he's twelve but he weighs that of a seven year old if that, I walk to my room and slowly laid Harry down on the bed, covered him up, carefully trying not to wake him, I don't know why I did this but I placed a light kiss on the top of Harry's head and then slowly eased myself onto the bed and turned on my side, I dimmed the lights and looked at Harry once more before sleep overtook me.
But before he could go any further he was punched none to lightly in his face breaking his glasses and his nose, blood spilling everywhere.
"I thought I told you lot to be careful! You Mister Fuller will have detention for the rest of the week, where you will clean every cauldron from the lessons as well as help me with preparing the ingredients. CLASS DISMISSED!" he bellowed at the end making everyone leave as fast as they could.
Harry and co are at Walt's Wizarding World for their holiday
"Professor sir, Hadrian is having a panic attack after what Weasley has said to him is it alright to take him to the medical wing?"
Severus hummed at what was happening but Hadrian kept his face in his fathers chest not wanting to be there.
"Luke and Crissy?" mumbled Harry making Severus smile at him.
"Hadrian is reading his potion book that we got him at Diagon Alley when we went, he's been reading ahead which I think is really going to help him now, he's really listened to what we have told him and he's growing into a fine young man" and Tom kissed Severus's head making said man blush.
"It's ok Otiz we were worried about you but we can see that your fine now" said Harry making his finger make a pop as he took it out of the mouth and tapped him on the nose making him giggle.
Once everyone had arrived a the chatter had died down all wanting to know who the person was sitting in Dumbledore's seat, this made Lucius sigh he hated doing things like this but he knew he had to and so walked to the front of the hall and introduced the new Headmaster.
"Come on you two let's go and get something for the hyper one" and he led them to the under tens section of the store.
"I bet he just fell messing around with his cousin, he seems nice enough telling me that he and his friends always let Harry join in any of their games, he says that he treats Harry as a brother, he also told me that he was very much a part of the family. All of them laughing and joking, watching television... what ever that my be... sharing treats and a bedroom, helping with chores... you know the normal things family gets up to...."
He knew what each one was saying which at first shocked him but once he got over it he loved his gift that Lady Magic gave him.
Parents: Lily J. Potter nee Evans and James Fleamont Potter
Otiz noting his familiar's thought process and he growled louder than before and then in the room now stood a rhino size animal Otiz, his fur was now no longer the pale blue it was firey red, static flying everywhere and vaper coming from his mouth.... he was pissed.
How could this possibility happen to him. How!!
After lunch Tom really thought that letting Harry pick anything sugary was a bad idea as both him and Otiz were now completely hyperactive and would not stop running off to look around but he was glad that Severus had seen what was going to happen and so placed a location spell on both of them so they could find them if somehow they got lost, but knowing Otiz he wouldn't let that happen even if he was now a six year old.
Arthur- Art-Art
Breakfast was half way through when McGonagall got up and said "it has come to my attention that someone in the school needs to be resorted...." everyone was shocked but not Severus or Harry.
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU HAVE HURT YOUR FRIEND RONALD WEASLEY! YOU WERE HIS FIRST FRIEND AND NOW THIS IS HOW YOU ACT! GINERVA DONT FOLLOW IN YOU BROTHER'S FOOTSTEPS I THINK YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THE WRONG OLDER BROTHER HERE!
If anything happens to him I would like one or a small group of you to bring him to me and no before any of you say I don't mind if I'm teaching when you bring him to me" said Severus to the students and then slowly coaxed Harry out of his robes so then he could introduce himself.
She came to the Gargoyle and started listing off sweets like she knew the password completely forgetting that Dumbledore wasn't there anymore.
Severus smiled towards his son and took both into his hands and then handed the staff member the wolf while he took the snake and then both headed to the tills to pay for them both.
Severus had decided on Maui in Hawaii as it had the Haleakala National Park, the valcano Haleakala, pools and waterfalls of Ohe'o Gulch and the scenic winding Hana Highway.
"Should we get him a dummy and a stuffie and put him down for a nap?" said Armando Dippet.
Severus sat down with Harry on his lap who was still buried in his fathers neck, he just wanted to go home and not have to deal with anything.
I showed him the documents that I carry around mind you these are just copies to our esteemed Headmaster who didn't even look at them again, afterward we both left".
"...we..."
"Otiz calm yourself child. Come here and I'll explain to everyone" said Severus sitting his his chair, he placed Harry on his lap, who in turn curled into a ball, Otiz crawled up his lap as well as held onto his robes.
"How dare you put a silencing charm on me Percy Weasely! You had no right to do that to me! You are meant to be a Perfect! You have abused your power by casting that spell on me!" she shouted at the oldest ginger but he ignored her altogether.
When he is 14 he has something of a stoic attitude but he is trying to keep his animal under wraps even though everyone knows about, he doesn't want to transform for no good reason like he does when he's 6.
"Lets get these paper's signed shall we before someone decides to rise from dream land" smiled Narcissa towards the boy who still had a handful of Severus' robes.
Seventh memory from the age of nine, Vernon driving into his anus ripping it apart yet again, blood spilling every where.
Hermione wasn't happy about it and stood up and started complaining about how they should follow school rules.
Molly wanted to get up and say something to her youngest two but was stopped by everyone in the room minus Harry of course he was out for the count.
It looked like his father regretted his choice of words to his mother to this day, it was the day that his mother stopped talking to him and started dating his father back in 6th year (A/N not sure) and then four years later he was born and then everything fifteen months later that Tom also regretted leaving poor Harry alone.
From what I could work out and from what Madam Pomfrey and dad told me... I was....." He couldn't say anymore he was now in complete tears, Severus just sighed and got up and picked him up.
"Not a word Hadrian Snape not one word!"
It had been three weeks since Otiz had transformed into a teenager and he made doubly sure that he always stayed like that to make sure that the Stooges couldn't get to Harry at all.
There was a bucket in the corner of his room that he was using!! I had to get him out of that environment to save his life!!" said Severus shouting at the end to make his point clear.**
"Spoil sport" mumbled Otiz.
Once the hallway was completely clear besides the five students and one teacher, Ron finally let go of Harry's elbow, he ran right into his father's arms and cried.
"Me always can, just no wanna. Wanna stay with you, no weaving behind gain, I lonely" was all he said before he started to drift off to sleep.
"Ok then everyone I think it would be best if you all went to bed, I know tomorrow is Sunday but I would like to have everyone here to have a conversation about what we are going to do to help Hadrian deal with the Headmaster from now on.
"Thomas Riddle get off me right now or I will hex you! I don't care if you were once Lord Freakin Voldemort I will hex you into outta space if you don't let me go!" Tom did showly.
The three left just as they were pulling into Kings Cross station, Marcus had ended up within the compartment of Harry and his friends.
"Why brother you know me too well!" and they both walked off out of the hall making more plans and how they would get the potions into the three Stooges food and drink but also some other students and teachers so then it wasn't just them.
It was slow going but he managed somehow, it could all be down to him being a spy and was able to get himself out of tricky situations he found himself in but he managed all the same. After getting dressed for the day in his normal black attire he went into the living room and sitting there ready for him was a piping hot cup of coffee and that mornings news paper.
"Wes" and he hung his head
"But why is that Severus? I got a message from them stating when they got to Kings Cross he wasn't there, they were worried that he had been taking or something, they called the Muggle police too look for him".
The twins ended up going into their room and sat down on the floor in between their beds plotting on how to help Harry.

Once the poor boy had let his father finally up, they changed clothes, yes Severus went for Muggles clothes as well.
"...like..."
Severus glared at him before continuing "are you aware what is happening at Potter's home?"
"Get off me goof!" said Harry as he finally got up from his bed after Otiz had fallen on him three time since he had woken up ten minutes ago.
"I want to go home...." mumbled Harry to his dad's side.
In the Great Hall everyone was wondering what was happening Dumbledore's chair was empty and it looked like the rest of the staff members didn't care about it, one or two yes but everyone else nope!
"Hadrian, so who is this?" asked Severus towards his son and Otiz.
"Hurry up and eat we have to be at the Ministry in ten minutes, someone thought it was a good idea to sleep in" and he chuckled again while he banished his plates into the sink to be washed later and place the newspaper onto the table to finish later.
Severus was given potion ingredients form most of the Weasely's and a hand made jumper that was a snot green with a black 'S' on it and Harry was given some books, another chess set as well as some jokes and chocolate and the dreaded jumper this one was a bright yellow with a bright red 'H' on it.
"You also know that I took Hadrian form his abusive relatives, sadly we saw them there. His cousin Dudley I think his name was, the whale, was tapping on the glass of an enclosure, but then sadly they noticed him.
"Don't get into trouble, otherwise I'll have you tell Professor McGonagall and she will give you detention with Flitch... again" said Percy as he got up when he noticed two first years coming into the room after cerfew.
"Not sure, should we head back and ask dad?" asked Harry as they had finished eating and paying.
*Canary sweets and puking pastilles in the food and drink
"I beat up the weaker older years and Ravenclaws so then they do my homework"
Everyone else headed to their next lesson which happened to be potions with one dungeon bat, the Griffindor and Slytherin going as one, it looked like the two houses might just be starting to get along for once.
~Nit picker..... how did you know I asked him~
The train ride home was quiet but still loud but not as loud as it would of been in the Gryffindor compartments. Harry was reading a book on Astronomy for some unknown reason he found it interesting, Hedwig was sleeping on the over head compartment while Tyki was sitting on the bench next to Harry.
Otiz hissed at her but did nothing else, Harry was very calm and so he was calm but not a 100% he didn't know her, so he was unsure.
......
It was another day of another new term, Harry and his friends including the Otiz affectionately known as Goof by Harry himself were all walking to their first lesson of the day: Transfiguration with one Minerva McGonagall when they were stopped by Ron and Hermione of all things.
Sirius just nodded at this no way was he going to make 'that' thing mad, he had hidden when Otiz saw him for some reason he was scared of Otiz but he didn't know why he was.
Straight from Severus but slightly messy from James, the colour thankful stayed the same, he was perfect if Severus had words for it, he was a perfect combination of all three of them.
Harry looked at the letter not really knowing what to do and so pocketed the letter until after dinner, he wanted to tell Severus about this right away and he knew he had to wait until just before dinner to tell him.
Vaults:
Hermione was outside in the yard heading down towards Hagrid's she was fuming with what had happened to Ron.... letting everything that had happened since last year spill from his very own mouth.... it was still going almost twenty four hours and it was getting ridiculous... they were specifically told not to tell anyone when they entered the school back in first year and here he was spilling the freakin' beans!!
They landed in Severus' private room within the castle walls which was a surprise as they didn't know where she was going to send them.
"Miss Weasely it is a child, a scared child for that matter, it looks like young Mr. Snape's familiar can take a human form" said Minerva to everyone, Albus wasn't happy.
"I wanted to just ask why young Mr. Potter wasn't at his relatives and not at the Burrow even?"
"No Mister Dursley he has not I have adopted the young boy and have changed his name, you are no longer his guardian".
I would have to be up at the crack of dawn to start on my chores even before I went to school, I would have to cook their meals and while they ate I was thrust back into the cupboard until they are done.
"I asked if you were ok son" replied Severus as he sat back down.
"Otiz get off the table and sit down" said Severus to the little boy who was now on the table impatient due to being hungry.
Remus looked up and saw them "should we stop them?" he pointed to the group and everyone looked up and laughed.
.........
"Thank you" Harry croaked out and gave Severus a smile and a nod, he then stood up to his full height which really wasnt much different when he was doubled over in pain, Severus smiled at him and they made their way into the bank.
"Ru'et pwease" mumbled Otiz into Severus' chest making the Malfoy's all look at him wondering who he was talking about, while Harry brought over his toy snake.
He was now in school, everything was strange it wasn't a castle, no stone walls not lamps for that matter, where were the tapestries, suits of armour, the ghosts?? Where in Merlin was he!
Harry was still in his room within Severus' quarters having been there now for a week completely refusing to attend his classes, Draco had brought all of his homework to him and had a study session with him and Blaise, Otiz on the other hand thought it would be a good idea to annoy Severus in his lab.
Once the flames had died down there now stood a very colourful phoenix who trilled up at them, making Otiz sigh as he picked him up in both hands.
Now it was lunch and as he was heading there he was stopped by some Gryffindor's, his own house was going to be picking on him.
I use Snape at Hogwarts as it's easier plus if Albus found out he would try to use the Prince name for unjust means" and he sighed again, this made Harry shift slightly.
"You're a fake Headmaster, professor Dumbledore is a much better Headmaster than you'll ever be it would be better if you just leave" shouted Hermione at Tom but he ignored her.
Remus sat there and his nose caught on to the lie right away and sent a slight growl at the man, he hated being lied to more than anything.
"Thank you Mr. Weasley for that lovely bit of information about how you see me, plus also harassing a fellow student is worth detention with me. Miss Weasley, Miss Granger I would also like you to come to detention as well due to harassing a fellow student" all three gulped at the stoic voice behind him.
He threw a fit causing all of the paper on his desk to fly everywhere but to everyone here it seemed the norm for him and so no one said anything, his teacher came over.
"Do we want to know?" asked Blaise around a chip.
before you say it I know about my spelling
"Draco sit down we have a lot to talk about before our guests arrive in so little time" said Lucius as his wife sat down next to her husband making their son sit down in front of them on the other sofa.
As they entered the Great Hall for lunch everyone was looking at Otiz carrying Harry in his arms.
Everyone looked at him and laughed hard thinking that they had heard wrong but before they could ask anymore questions Severus stepped thorough the portrait leading to his office and then onto his private quarters.
"Kay, me answer"
Arthur- Artie
"What do we do when we make a mess then?"
There first stop was Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, the bell chimed that made Otiz giggle at the sound.
After dinner the adrenaline of Lucius and Harry has faded and they were soon asleep on the sofa together, they had been running around the park like small children and going on any of the rides they deemed worthy of them and their thrill seeker ways, Harry they could understand but Lucius it was different they had never seen this side of him before it was quite refreshing to be honest.
"I should put him on reins" said Remus making everyone else laugh all knowing how back Sirius could get at types of fun and pranking was right up there.
"Ok what did it say all I heard was hissing" said Severus to them he was starting to hate Parseltongue.
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
"Draco what is the meaning of this?" asked Severus to the blonde boy after being attacked by his son and brought into a hug.
"D... Dad can I go..... please" mumbled Harry to his father, Remus noted right away how scared his cub has become of Albus Dumbledore. His scent was a dead giveaway, it was sour.
Blaise
Ah picked on the dreamy looney girl in the library and so Lady Hogwarts attacked her, the wench is now out from Poppy and Lady Hogwarts can hear and feel her plotting against you!
Lucius- Lu-Lu
Once the three older siblings started to ignore him magic started to flow within the school and around all of the four Weasley siblings, the older three could feel their tied to him breaking..
Weeks passed and the black dog started to follow him around.
"Well duh" was Otiz' reply to the whole thing stopping the spell.
"So a new familiar has entered the family it seems" laughed Severus as he went and made everyone a drink and they sat down to enjoy the rest of the weekend getting to know the new familiar Coco.
Without the help from staff members I think his magic would of lashed out like it has now in his room, he had put up very powerful silencing and locking charms on his room and we won't be able to get in there for the time being.
"Weally?" asked Otiz looking into matching green eyes and then into Onyx eyes of what he would call his grandad.
I wonder............
Right away Fudge appeared and saw how upset Harry was and he could almost see the steam coming off Severus due to his anger.
"And he drives a flying motor bike of all things" laughed Molly which made Narcissa laughs as well.
Grumbling up the stairs she noticed right away that the door was missing meaning she couldn't even sneak out!
"Tommy wif Haddy, ups pwease Tev" holds his arms up to be picked up, he was getting sleepy.
General magic (95% of core magic)
"Oh Hadrian what did those... oh my poor boy" said Severus hugging Harry tightly as he cried into his shoulder.
He ignored her and once her rant was done he carried on "Albus Dumbledore is now in Azkaban due to what he has done, I am not liable to say but he shouldn't of done any of it, Miss Granger I will not be changing the office as it fits my needs".
"SIRIUS!" shouted Charlie making everyone look at the young couple and the sighed, it looks like it was a bad idea to bring four pranksters with them on this trip and made a note to themselves not to do it again.
"Tev, Hadwin sads" said Otiz clinging to Severus' robes not wanting to be near anyone besides who he would consider his father figure.
As the two was talking they were joined by Pansy, Blaise and Theodore and the five of them stared into the fire for a few more minutes until it was time to finally leave for the summer holidays, thank Merlin he had packed the night before last, he didn't want to forget anything, like Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were right now.
Yes he was coming fourteen but that didn't matter to him he was yet again fascinated at the wonders of magic only knowing of it for what... four years and better yet coming to terms with what his family had done to him for all those years after he lost his parents.
Everything she had was now something for a child, thank Merlin her school books hadn't changed much but there were charms so them she couldn't tamper with it.
"Oh it's Yahtzee, I think dad gifted her to you when you fell sleep last night after we had dinner, she's now your house elf now along with Boris and Mink, she isn't part of the Malfoy family" smiled the blond to his friend.
Leviathan or Levi meaning Coiled, Twisted in Folds or Wreathed- basalisk
"Oh Hadi, Hadi..."
Not that this has taking up most of your first period and breakfast of course I would like everyone to finish and head off to their second lessons of the day, I will be coming around to inspect the classes during the next week or so, so please expect me in your lessons from time to time.
Everyone knew it was out of the question as they were all there when the Howler came in, she was just making things worse for herself.
He was in History of Magic and was getting bored like the rest of them were, Binns talking about different parts of the Goblin War was enough to drive anyone to sleep, when it happened.
"Hadrian what are they saying do you know?" asked his father but Harry just smiled up at his father saying nothing he was in his element really.
But he was with Severus! The slimy disgusting Slytherin dungeon bat of Hogwarts, someone who had defiled him over and over again all throughout his adult life.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So not fun Sev.. I was only messing and plus I'm bored! Hads has locked the damn door and won't let me in" and he pointed at the dour man sitting in the chair.
Black (through godparent, Heir)
"You will not get off like your brother and Miss Granger have, you will be exspelled from Hogwarts as you have not just harmed poor Hadiran but you have tormented many others for the sake of your own ridiculous reckless reasons.
Theo had been slimed more than enough times as he ignored Harry's questions about the park while Draco was out right ignored by Harry which didn't please the blond at all, Otiz had found it fun to stay in his child form and run amok braking anything and everything due to being frustrated with everyone holding back everything from the pair.
As they floo'd into the living room both of them were hugged to an inch of their lives by one Molly Weasley but were happy enough to be hugged minus Severus.
Minerva was fuming and they could tell right away and just turned to one of her lions and said "please bring Miss Granger to me at once and if you can get all the evidence I would be thankful for" the student nodded and left the room to get Hermione, only for Fred and George's friend hand over everything that she had gathered up.
"Mister Dursley I would appreciate that your son stop banging on the glass. That animal looks quite scared because of your son" said Severus who had moved to stand in front of him.
"Hadrian come now child everything will be alright..." said Severus trying to get his attention, all he got was a slight nod of a head.
Otiz came into the clearing in his teenage form followed close behind by Harry and Draco, Otiz looked pissed to say the least at having to follow Harry of all people into something so dangerous that it was going to cost him his life if he wasn't careful, knowing Severus the boy would be grounded.
"Miss Granger you can't catch up unless you go back over the basics and get your grades up again. I know you can do it, your tutor will be with you six days a week where you will go over two subjects daily and then hopefully your grades will go up once again" said Tom.
"Just a few more seconds young Heir Prince and it will be over" said Griphook from his spot on the circle, they had been working on breaking and cleansing everyone out of his body which had been forty five minutes and a normal cleaning would only take about twenty no wonder the poor boy was crying.
Hermione Jean Granger is now a werewolf which no one wanted and I thought it would be a twist and how I'm going to plan it is going to be fun so watch out. She has been a bully to Hadrian since he was adopted and it was all because of what Albus had wanted Hadrian to be, a sacrificial lamb.
She flew off making a few of the student wonder where she had come from and landed on Hermione as she was reading her book and not focusing on the lesson or what Coco was up too.
Otiz got some meat and a brand new collar which had beautiful little gems which spelt out his name, these were given by both Harry and Severus.
Otiz was again out for her blood but knew it wasn't the best time or place to do that so he would wait for his time and being the type of animal he was he could wait as long as possible.
Next it was time to really Christmas shop, he knew he WASNT getting Ron, Hermione and Ginny something, they didn't deserve anything after what they had put him though the past two months.
"Pup who is this?" asked Remus to them and Harry looked towards them and then at Otiz who was scowling into his drink making it bubble and hiss.
Fifth memory from the age of seven, thrown back outside in the dead of winter and had gotten frost bite
"That was what we call an Animagus which means animal transformation, it takes many years to train for this but it can be done mine is a cat but there are many different types".
It had been a week since Otiz had become human and it looked like he would stay that way for a while, he was a happy little six year old by normal means but with the consent hair colour changes and his fox ears and tail appearing out of nowhere it was becoming a chore to make him sit still.
"Otiz?!" asked Harry shocked that the stranger was in fact his familiar!
"He's so cute how old is he anyway?" asked Narcissa to them as they left the table Otiz in Severus' arms who was slowly falling asleep.
Harry was getting ready for down to Hogsmeade he needed time away from his father and his friends.. they were like children when they got together.
"Love Hadwin!"
"Miss Weasley..." was all he said making her stiffen in shock and without warning jumped up saying:
Draco's birthday 5th July rolled around and he jumped on my one messy haired green eyed boy and he wasn't happy about it and so threw him off making Harry land with a thud, he had no idea why the boy would get up .... no wait due to his up brining Harry would normally wake early and Severus had tried to drill it into him that he didn't need to but he still did any way.
"Hadrian... could you come with me for a moment son" said Severus just loud enough not to wake the sleeping child on his shoulder but loud enough for his son to hear him.
"Next is Smiler and then before dinner its Saw and I'll leave you alone then" said Harry as both him and Otiz dragged him off to the Smiler which was just around the corner both smiling like crazy and Lucius following behind them, they were met up by everyone else.
The rest of the group also looked round but didn't find it appealing and so they waited for Otiz to finish what he was doing only to find that he had picked up some Frog Spawn Soap, a nose biting tea cup and many, many dung bombs..
"Don't even think about it or you go into the corner and Severus will take away your treat that he has made for you two" his made him pout and leave the stuff alone.... for now that is.
Albus flew at the second year only to have Percy, Fred and George get to him in time and pulled the poor boy out of the way.
Draco did manage to unwrap some of the gifts he had left after Harry went to "look" read open out of boredom for something to do, they didn't mind really as it proved that he had completely settled down into family life that he never had before.
Ginny was the first to accuse and she turned to her brother's who were still sitting at the Slytherin table, she stood up and started telling.
'Very well then Mister Snape I see that you father adopted you back in August when he came and recused you.... from them. Yes I can see that everything is now falling into place, you have done what you can in Gryffindor but I still stand by what I said last year Slytherin would be the better house for you'
You are no longer part of the Wizarding World, you are not a Weasley, Lady Magic has made you a Muggle in all sense of the word.
*Fireworks wouldn't be Fred and George
"Ok then what I want to know is why are you human now? You never have been before so why now?"
Filius- Filly
Welcome to A Father A New Life Start Book 2, as we know Harry or should I say Hadrian was adopted by one Severus Tobias Snape due to almost being killed by one Vernon Dursley.
"...are you..."
"Severus thank you for knocking some sense into that boy, he only thinks of himself and we are to blame for the whole thing, we never thought something like this would happen but sadly it did" said Lucius after a House Elf brought in more tea and a thin blanket for Harry as he was now spread out on the sofa with his head in Severus' lap.
Today was the day, the day where Severus would either keep or lose his son, his perfect boy, his baby. He didn't want to bring the boy here but he had to, this involved him as much as Severus in that matter.
"I've slept with every boy in my year in my house and I'm seeing at least half of the other houses!"
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU!! THIS WAS NOT HOW YOUR FATHER AND I RAISED YOU!!
"That bushy haired witch is out ok, she's out and I don't trust her! She could be doing anything to try and hurt you Hadrian and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to you.
Inside the stood one very scared first year Gryffindor, two Head of House's one snake standing behind the scared Gryffindor right next to the only escape route known to her, the door to the office and one lion sitting in her chair all regal and looking majestic but ready to pounce at any minute, those two not at all happy with the young lion.
Dream: to be a grown up!
He snarled again and this time he had had enough and went to attack Hermione due to the racket that was coming out of her month it was upsetting his cub more and more and it was they only way to protect him.
They had headed to Diagon Alley to finish everything but first lunch and so they headed to the Three Broomsticks, afterwards they managed to get everything else, including two miniture dragon statues one for Harry and one for Charlie which came alive when you said an incanation.
As everyone looked over the file, some having to re-read everything their anger grew towards the Headmaster! How could he let this happen to the boy!
Metamorphmagus (100% blocked)
Severus- Tev
Harry came back wearing a black Reebok top with blue jeans and black converse trainers, and when he saw Otiz in the same outfit only reverse he had to slap himself, of course Otiz would dress like this when they went out it was to say 'my familiar I will protect'.
"I know but we can always come back again, you still have your homework to do first when we get back and I know for a fact your potion homework is easy enough" and he laughed.
