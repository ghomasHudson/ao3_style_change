“I wouldn’t take the dark mark. The return of Voldemort drove him crazy. He used that hideous thing to control his own son” he finished. Harry wrapped his arms around the blonde tightly and soothed his hand up and down on his back.
The air felt chilly on his face as he walked towards the bookstore. He came in front of the bookstore and took a deep breath before entering.
Draco climbed out first and then Harry. when Harry came up, It was like all his fears had come true. Along with Jace’s men his own team was on the ground and Billie was bleeding that she was lying on her own blood. Jace had Draco kneeled at his feet, hair held tight by a grip too painful and wand at ready under his chin.
That was the reason why he left the wizarding world. Hew knew as long as he’s there, no one would ever let him live in peace. He lost contact with Pansy and Blaise and his mother died 2 years after the war.
so i started this story with something else and now it's going somewhere else, i really hope you all like it.
He looks at them and long for the day when he’ll get to have that Draco.
She squinted her face a bit, “why, we don’t handle cases related to muggles”.
"yeah we do, just owl me where and when and i'll clear my schedule"
He looked behind Draco and then immediately started working on Draco’s hands. Draco looked behind him and saw that Harry was standing over him with arms crossed and a stoic face, the outline of his muscles clearly visible. Draco flashed him a smile and Harry returned it with as much sweetness.
Harry took a deep breath and explaines, “today at the office, Kingsley brought us a new case. It’s about a dark artifact, a medallion to be precise. Last it was seen on Lucius Malfoy”.
It was Saturday, he didn’t have much to do, and the constant jitters of possibly getting to see Malfoy today, made him useless to do anything else. He spent hours cleaning his room manually which would take only minutes by magic, but right now he needed to kill time. He looked at the clock and frowned when he saw it was only 10 AM.
“Any plans for tonight’s ball?” she nudged his elbow as he stood beside him. “no, and don’t you have a certain redhead to bother?” he asked he checked the list of guests arriving.
“Draco you are no assassin” harry heard. He tried to follow that voice suddenly he was in the astronomy tower, the night Dumbledore was killed. He saw Dracco from beneath the floor boards holding his wands towards the professor.
He already decided the best attire with the help of Pansy to wear on the ball night and the stuff he needed to break his fast was already arranged.
“oh, it’s nothing interest just asking for a case”, he waved it off with his hand and he could tell by her expression she didn’t believe him one bit. Damn this brightest witch of all time and for knowing Harry like the back of her hand.
The waiter came over, it was an old lady, maybe in her 50s, “what can I get you lovebirds?”. “oh we’re not…”,” he’s not my..”. They both said at the same time, but the waitress got the hint,” oh my apologies for assuming”, she said.
He took out his invisibility cloak charmed to fit his back pocket. He always took the cloak everywhere he went. He enlarged it and got under it. He then again made his way to apparition point without hitting anyone.
“are you sure, Harry. It’s the minister we’re talking about” asked Moriarty. “yes, he’s…. he’s been acting strange” he know he doesn’t have much evidence to prove it but he also can’t tell them the real reason why he’s so sure.
Draco almost lost his brain processing at how easily Harry had used his first name, “you wish Potter” he managed retorted. He looked towards Ginny “alright then, spin the bottle we- Ginevra”.
He then realized that the picture showed his whole neck and the collarbone from where the shirt had come down and his shirt was so big it looked like he wasn’t wearing anything underneath and showed his crossed legs, he was smiling in the pic.
He backed away but harry pulled him by the waist and crashed their lips. The kiss was neither slow nor fast, just perfect for the moment. His one hand held Draco close while the other held Draco’s cheek. Draco snaked his hand around his neck and into his hair. Harry licked his lower lip, desperate for permission to deepen the kiss. Draco let out a little moan when he felt Harry’s tongue caressing his and tightened his hold in his hair.
He remembered all the heated looks Harry gave throughout the day and imagined Harry looking at him like that while he’s on top of him. He inserted a second finger and curled them hitting the spot, all while stroking his cock. His back arched at the pleasure.
Harry saw how his neck moved when Draco gulped down. He helped Draco steady himself a bit on his feet. Draco let go of his hand and said, “goodbye Harry” he said while turning away. “uhh Draco” harry called out softly, “the helmet” he pointed towards Draco’s hand. “oh, yeah, here”, he took the helmet with a cocky smile.

Jamie signed, “Man I love being an Auror but I hate the paperwork”.
Now that’s two of the golden trio, where is the- oh there he is, that motherfucker. Harry James Potter, and his stupid scar, and his stupid face, and stupid messy hair, and his beautiful eyes and are those muscles under that tight shirt?
“you tell me where you are you never see your sister again” he growled into the speaker. Everyone was quite around the room. “you think you can threaten me Golden boy!” came Jace’s voice.
He abruptly looked up from where his eyes were on Draco’s legs, “yes, hey Draco, you uhh you look really beautiful”
“Man, why does every bad guy have to be insensitive, I gave her best partner in the world cup!!” said Jamie with a whine. “Mo and I are going to her place”.
Once he reached there, he started walking down the street to the apparition point and called Alice. “hey, I need you to do something, you’re the only one l can trust right now”, he said as soon as she picked up.
The warm air inside felt extremely pleasant mixed with the smell of books. He rubbed his hands and started walking towards one of the aisles to look for Malfoy. The interior was impressive, with rows and rows of books,
It’s not something to hide but what was he gonna say
(See the end of the chapter for
"tulips, he always sat by the lilies at Hogwarts during lunch"
“so you, are you one of those unlucky souls that got put on a lead that probably doesn’t exist or the devoted “I’ll do anything for the wizarding world type” he asked in a friendly manner, trying to know the intentions of the man.
“Go out with me, like a date?” Harry asked out of nowhere.
“alright we have three hours, we have to get Draco out before it. Mo and Cassie will stay out on the lookout. Me and Billie will go inside the chapel.” Said Harry looking around the room for any questions.
Right when he was about to say something, they heard a thump noise from below them. Mo and Harry turned towards each other. Wands at ready he gestured for Mo to follow him. He reached the door to the basement.
As he was walking down the road, he saw a man’s reflection following him. He took many turns to make sure the man was onto him. He took a turn and went inside a shop and made his way to the back room cautiously.
"Get Alice to find out who might have done it. Can you track back some of the magic of the medallion to the person who's controlling  him?" He asked looking  at Mo. " yeah i can try, just need to get close enough  to the minister" said Mo.
They both groaned at the feeling of each other’s evident arousal. Harry pulled back a little to breathe, but not too far. Their lips were still touching. “I need to hear you say you want this Draco” his heavy voice made Draco’s knees weak like never before.
It was because of this that his team of five auror members, Jamie, Moriarty, Alice, Billie and Cassie voted for him to lead the team after Beatrice retired, and she was happy to give him her place. “The world will always see you as Harry Potter, don’t ever let their opinions be an influence on your decisions kid, or you’ll always be disappointed. You gave this world enough now live your life" she had told him in the pub where they were celebrating her retirement.
Again, what the fuck is going on, “I’m sure to a hound like you everyone weighs nothing” he sneered back. Harry chuckled and handed Draco his drink.
With a choked sob he dared his hand steady. Draco was nodding at him with a little smile, “it’s okay Harry, you can do it. I love you” he said.
“illegal, but I’ll take anything at this point” he said. harry turned around and saw a broken window, “There, we can get in from there”.
“You came back,” she said a little breathless, “I told Blaise you’ll be back”. So, Blaise was also attending.
(See the end of the chapter for
Honestly what was Harry to say, he can’t say anything that he actually wants to say, like
He thought if being in control came naturally to the man with the way he kissed. Hungry and possessive but still soft and passionate. He reached inside for his cock and spread the already leaking pre-cum all over his shaft for friction.
Harry could only think of one person who could possibly know about all this. Hermione.
Files upon files of proof how Alice and Jace or Alicia and Joel were the one who killed them and make it look like a natural cause. He couldn’t believe Alice was the one who killed Narcissa and many other. By the looks of Mo’s face, he wasn’t the only one.
They both were standing in a dark alley besides some bar. Harry led to the street and Draco realised it was a local market, “where are we” asked Draco. “we’re in a small town of Ireland.”
(See the end of the chapter for
_____________________________
Untill Harry bloody Potter showed up, with his beautiful eyes and his stupidly beautiful lush lips, and sex hair, and muscled that could crush Draco’s head like a watermelon and holy fuck that beard.
He walked towards Draco and offered him his hand. He noticed the Arabic mehndi on Draco’s hand was so dark it was almost black. The fancy red bangles he wore made his hands looked so beautiful he never wanted to let them go. He kissed the knuckles and then tangled their hands together.
Harry looked down and Draco turned his head to see his expression, he was breathing hard and deep. Harry looked back up and Draco saw the green in his eyes being covered by the black.
Those word felt like someone took a huge load off of his shoulders of being The Chosen One, Voldemort was dead and Harry was no longer The Golden Boy. He’s Harry Potter, head of the auror team of five drunken bastards. She meant more to him than dumbledore.
Draco knew Harry was close with his family in India after the war so he knew how the custom goes. Draco read about it and he wanted to do it as it is.
_____________________________________________
Draco tightened his hand Around Harry, “you, were?” he asked. “yeah, I know Snape was the one who did. Dumbledore knew he had to die too”.
He was such a gentleman to Draco that he had to calm down the urge to just snog the irresistible bastard right there in front of everyone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“tell me what were dumbldore’s last words he to you and remus” he asked. Kingsley tried hard thinking, “ i..i don’t… I don’t remember”.
Harry looked at Billie who was deep in thoughts. “if it’s the minister than we’re all in deep shit, because the artifact not only controls the person but it resurrects the person of the controllers desire into that body” she finally said putting down the papers she was holding on the desk
“quit smiling you goof,” he said because seriously his own cheeks were hurting pretty bad.
“took you long enough,” said Hermione as she linked her arms with him. They hang out occasionally, and every time they do Hermione gives him a long lecture about how she could practically taste the sexual tension between him and Harry afterward.
Harry woke up with tears strained on his cheeks and hand on his chest where he shot the sceptemsempra on Malfoy. He gulped down huge gasps of breaths and dug his fingers in his palm so hard to focus on something, anything other than the image of Draco's lifeless body.
He handed him the chocolate and the water bottle, “I’ll be right back. Stay right here love.”. he walked towards the man still on the ground. He checked his pockets but found nothing. He took out his phone and clicked the picture of the man and then obliviated his memory.
Harry vowed to himself to spent all his life plus those extra years Draco wished upon him to make him happy.
They all nodded. Harry walked back to the living room to Hermione and Ron. “mione, I need a huge favour” he said looking at her. “of course Harry, what is it?”
It was 7 AM when he got off the bed, he put on his joggers and sweatshirt and went out for a jog. He passed by a few restaurants and local shops stopped for a regular cup of coffee.
Harry Apparated to the nearest location from the bookstore, he arrived there 2 hours early before he had to meet with his friends so that he can have some alone time with the blonde.
“not here”, he gestured them to his office. He came in like any other usual way so not to create a suspicion. Everyone gathered around in his office except Alice, “where’s Alice?” he asked.
“that’s cause we’re not under the chapel, the trapdoor was just a portal to somewhere” he said looking both ways to look where to go.
“how do you know that?” asked Mo. “I know where Malfoy is. I’m sorry for keeping it from you guys. You guys have to trust me that he’s got nothing to do with it. He’s a squib.”  said Harry. “ohh cmon Harry we need everything here!” said Jamie dramatically sitting at another chair.
"what your wife  taking you to another  muggle  restaurant?" harry  said with a light chuckle.
He has to talk to Draco alone. The medallion absorbs dark magic and Malfoy has no magic at all. He knows that because for the time he was with him he felt no magic radiate off him
Then his eyes landed on the subject of his desires, the one person whose dreams either made him shout in his sleep out of fear or have a hard boner. He almost couldn’t recognize the man that was Draco Malfoy who was arranging the books a few aisles ahead of Harry.
Draco groaned loudly that Harry had to put his fingers in his mouth to shut him up, “you’re loud, I’d love to hear you, but we got to keep it down a little for the time being yeah baby”
“What plan could possibly require you to starve to death?” she asked as a matter of fact.
Eventually, they break away for air. For a moment there’s no sound except their harsh breathing and the clunk of Draco’s bangles as he caressed his hair slowly.
“shut up, I hadn’t eaten since last night!” he whined.
Alice was levitating Mo, her focus completely on him, “Damn Mo, you just have to be this Heavy that even a leviosa can hardly lift you!” she cursed. She didn’t even realize when Harry broke free from his bonds. He knocked the wand out of her hand and got her into a head lock. One of the advantages of being an all-powerful wizard, you don’t need a wand to do spells.
As soon as they walked in the spell came back on without sounding any alarm. They both walked with their backs against the wall. Billie gestured for him indicating that she found a way downstairs.
“Nothing, so do they keep record of wizards who’re working in the muggle world?” He asked nonchalantly.
He texted Mo and Cassie outside. Then they both walked back to the last turn and Harry took out his invisibility cloak and they both got under it. He just had to wait for the signal.
, he didn’t wanna seem desperate no matter how much he actually is.
Again his visions changed and he was back on the grounds of Hogwarts on the day of war
Harry took a sip of his cup, “dare”
Harry came out to the living room in a deep green v neck t-shirt and black fitted jeans. “I did a good job.” said Alice seated on the sofa beside Ron and Hermione.
“Yeah, that happened to me and Blaise as well, Gryffindors darling”. Before she could open the door. he pulled away.
“He’s got some very peculiar taste for a five-year-old", said Draco. Confused Harry asked, “what?”. Malfoy pointed towards the book and Harry saw what he was referring to and now it was his turn to turn the deepest shade of red.
Harry gestured from Mo and Cassie to take positions on the back and front door for any sign of someone other than Jace.
Wands at ready they scrummaged through the place. Harry was going through her bedroom when he heard Mo calling out his name. “what is it?” He said walking into the study where Mo was. As he walked in, he looked around the room in shock.
Harry apparated near the back door of the bookstore. He took out his bike from his pocket which he charmed to fit in his pocket. He straddled the now enlarged bike and put on his helmet and made his way to café where they almost had coffee which was interrupted by Jake.
Harry silently opened it and began walking downstairs slowly. It was dark so he casted a Lumos and searched the area. He turned, and suddenly came face to face with none other than Draco. He almost fell to the ground from the shock. “drop, your wand or he gets it!” came the hissing voice of Alice from behind him.
He visited Hermione during  his lunch break, he saw her sitting  in her office writing merlin knows what. He dropped a cup op pumpkin juice at her table which made her look up, “ohh it's you”, he knew Hermione sometimes gets so lost in her work that she forgets the basic necessities.
Harry was lost in the beauty before him, Draco’s eyes were dark, lips all swollen and pink, and his cheeks were red.
Draco already has a life; he’s not going to mess it up by bringing in his feelings. Nope, he is going to be a perfect gentleman tomorrow, he’ll swoon Draco with his manners and hoping that the porcelain beauty will fall in love with him.
Draco: "How did it go?"
“Harry!” Draco call to him, just as he’d entered Draco’s bedroom.
Draco watched his students hurrying to board the train, and he even used a feather-light charm to help a few of the student with their trunks. When he was sure all the Slytherins were onboard, he turned to see how Harry was getting on with the Gryffindors… he was not expecting Harry to be pointing his wand at him with a blank expression on his face.
-Hermione shook her head at Harry, holding his arm so he couldn't go to Draco.
-Tuesday 10 November, Harry stares at Draco across the Great Hall during dinner, he headbutts the table when Draco notices him.
“I think you’re about to tell me, but I know that it would have been hard.” Harry sipped at his whiskey, eyes still on Draco over the glass.
Blaise: "Weasley, Granger, and Potter are going at in in the common rooms as we speak."
Well, at least he knew what the Warmendall potion was, not that he’d had a reason to see it before – nor had he ever brewed it. He trusted Poppy however, so he did as he was instructed.
“I just don’t have a big appetite, its not like I’m underweight or anything.” Harry chuckled rolling his eyes.
-Draco takes Harry in the correct hold, him leading - being the better dancer. "Just look at me Harry, no one else matters." Harry blushes at how softly Draco reassured him, and how softly he is being held.
-Images of Draco crying in the bathroom after the song 'not one of us.'
Draco: "Of course I am, and Hagrid isn't part giant."
“It’s not typical for adult wizards to have bursts of accidental magic. Must have been some anger!” Said Draco.
– Poppy thought, ignoring Draco’s protests as she walked back to her office.
It was true, Hogwarts had reached the lowest population of children until now. Too many families had lost loved ones, children, and friends. People didn't want to get pregnant while Voldemort was still a threat, and a lot of people had even fled the country.
And with that, Harry fled the room, leaving a stunned Draco behind.
Harry nodded, but started walking away. Draco called after him confused.
With that Harry walked over to Filius, who was giving orders to a few of the other teachers.
Harry: "Alright!"
-Draco start running towards the Hogwarts gates, to leave Hogwarts grounds.
hoped that Draco wouldn’t stay this way, wouldn’t close off from him, but for now, all he could do was sort out their plans for Mr Avery. Yes, he’d come to talk about the boy, but he’d also hoped to talk to Draco in general… it seemed like Draco wasn’t in the mood for that though.
Hiis face completely blank of any expressions. Harry hated being on the receiving end of that look.
“We were so worried about you man,” he said with sincerity. Draco almost believed that his friends had forgotten about him. He couldn’t write them letters nor was he allowed to receive any. In case any of the death eaters tried to contact them.
"No thanks mate, I already  ate, I actually came over for a favour" he said with a sheepish  look on his face
“you didn’t eat anything at the breakfast, and not even when we were out?” he asked.
“I do, but a certain brunette almost ate my brain asking me why the hell has Draco not eaten anything since the morning?” she asked as she leaned in on her elbows and took the
“I didn’t “ Draco started slowly, “ but I did just now” he said lowering his wand.
His babbling was stopped with Draco’s lips. His heart stopped for a moment, Draco’s lips were softer than he always imagined, it was a light kiss and before he could respond it was over. “I would like to count this as a date and also I would love to go on another date with you”.
Harry realized he was in Draco’s head. Jace must be keeping him locked inside his own head by manipulating his memories. He needed to make Draco realise he didn’t kill professor dumbledore in order to wake him up
Mo and James were staying at his place, too exhausted to apparate home. Cassie was with Billie and Harry was finally at peace.
“I’ll call you back Alice, I gotta go”. He said. He put the phone in his pocket and turned towards Draco who was looking paler than usual. “well, care to explain, what is going on?”
Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow and said, “sure, and I never went to Hogwarts”. Harry’s cheeks were a little red but that was from all the running, yup definitely because of the running,
Suddenly embarrassed out of his wits, “I… know that but it’s not mandatory We don’t have to-“
Harry noted down the address and turned the book back into a coin size and told Alice to keep it back. He went home and took out his laptop. He owned few muggle devices, like an iPhone to facetime Dudley and his niece, a camera filled with pictures of holidays at Weasleys, TV with Netflix subscription.
Found a restaurant you would love to eat in, Bafta 195 Piccadilly.
“Change in habits includes body language and the words a person frequently uses. Look at the speech he gave at the charity event two days ago and compare it with last year. Maybe we’ll get our proof there” said Harry.
“I found a lot of other people she and her brother killed. She was bringing back their father. Their plan was to take over the ministry by resurrect him in Kingsley body” he explained. “and Malfoy’ asked Beatrice. “He took him before we made the jump on Alice” said Mo knowing the situation was particularly hard on Harry.
“yeah they do”.
“how are we gonna find Malfoy in two hours, merlin knows how long it is!” she hissed in anger. Harry casted lumos and walked a couple steps ahead looking for any sign. He came across a droplet of blood. He crouched down and saw the blood was fresh.
“crucio” said Alice and Mo fell to the ground in agonizing pain. “fine, don’t hurt him” said harry dropping his wand. “kick it towards Jace” she demanded. Gritting his teeth, he did.
That was not what he was expecting, but then again, It’s Potter, you never know what’s coming. And truth be told he knew he won’t ever be able to deny anything to this man
________________
“Alright, truth or dare Malfoy,” asked Cedric with that same stupid grin on his face as he could see right through Draco. How his jaw clenched as he noticed him caressing the side of Harry’s arm and how uncomfortable he was at how close they were sitting.
“Cassie and Billy, you two figure out if you can find the spell that activates it, James I need you to look for any counter curses that can work against that” ordered Harry. His suspicions about a certain Malfoy was growing minute by minute and he didn’t like not knowing.
Harry was so close to the orgasm he speeded a little. He bit down on Draco’s lip and he pulled hard on Harry’s hair, “I’m so close Harry, fuck don’t stop”
“he you” said Harry, voice softer than cotton. “heya back” said Draco with a little smile, still coming back to his consciousness. “we’re almost of out of here okay” he said caressing the side of Draco’s face. “I knew you’d always come, my saviour” he said getting up and holding Harry close.
__________________________________
Harry went down suddenly and Draco took a sudden breath in and clenched his hand in his shirt. And then Harry rose back up along with Draco. Draco was trying his hardest to keep his breath under control. The 10 rounds were over before he could even count.
texts are underlined.
Draco arrived at the ball at 7 pm, and as always he looked For Potter. When his eyes met him, Harry was already looking at him with wide eyes, Draco wore a red net Sari wrapped around his lithe figure so perfectly it looked breath-taking, and Harry did stop breathing until Ron kicked him in the foot lightly. The cut-sleeve deep neck blouse displayed his collarbones.
It's been three nights in a row he's been having the same dream which had never happened. Every time It's a different dream, every time. And every time someone else dies, Sirius, Remus, Fred, Collin. People he couldn't save, people who died because of him. Sometimes it's even about the people who made it through the war, Ron, Hermione, Neville. So he wrote them a letter asking how they were, general stuff, not revealing the real reason behind the letters.
Cedric wrapped his hand around Harry’s shoulder and pulled him a little closer. Suddenly jealous, Draco reverted his eyes and emptied his cup in one go. Just then the bottle pointed at him and Cedric.
He walked towards Malfoy and stood behind him, Malfoy was still busy arranging the books on the aisle, humming some music Harry never heard before. he cleared his throat to say something. it startled Malfoy and a book fell out of his hand.
“Malfoy” he regarded back. Draco leaned towards the door. they also had an unusual friendship, not much close but he admired Ron. Especially his ability to play wizard chess.
“they think you have something to do with the medallion, I would have taken you to the ministry but right now there are few traitors who can hurt you there. Until I think it’s completely safe for you out there, you have to stay here, love”.
"I was hoping you we can discuss the American-British donation treaties after the party.," he asked taking a sip of his champagne.
“Oh”, that was all Harry could come up with. Jake turned a confused eye towards Malfoy but before he could say anything Malfoy stood up from the table, “and we should be going if we to catch a table for the brunch”, he turned towards Harry with a tight smile on his face. “see you around Potter". “yeah nice meeting you Harry” said Jake still looking like he had no idea what’s going on.
When he reached the ministry he made his way where his team was. He knew this was risky and if he was wrong he could lose his entire career along with his team. “we found something” said Billie.
“Sorry to keep you waiting your highness,” he said as they all walked towards the main town. It was hot and if it wasn’t for Hermione holding his hand he’d have already fainted.
______________________________________
He whispered few wandless spells and with his hands blocking the air passage, she passed out easily. Harry casted an episkey to heal minor injuries of Mo. Mo came back to consciousness. Harry helped him sit up and handed him his wand back. “We need to move, Jace took Draco” he explained. Mo got up with a groan, “what are we going to do with her?” he asked.
“yeah It’s the fastest way to a safe house”. He turning his bike small again. “don’t worry I won’t let go of you” he said taking Draco’s hand.
“no, no doubt someone is covering his tracks. And we didn’t find anyting about the medallion either. Not even at the manor. Malfoy is our only option. I checked every record. There is no sigh of him” said Alice. Harry furrowed his brows, “every record?”.
he thought to himself
"Right flowers. what kind?" asked Hermione.
“why do I have to be included in this, it’s his dare!”
“we need strong evidence to even confront the minister” said Jamie. “he’s got the whole ministry in hand, even if he is under the curse, whoever is controlling him would put us out even before we get the chance to confront him” said Jamie
Ron eyed Kreacker with a doubtful look but sat at the dining table
"Are there any Malfoys even left?” asked Jamie. “only one and no one has seen him after the war” said Moriarty. Harry purposely kept it a secret that he knew where he is.
“Morning Harry" she waved; she was around his age but she was from Drumstrang.
He frowned when he saw Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. He turned his head towards the door in disappointment and saw Malfoy was sitting alone outside the café in front of the book store.
Harry cautiously took a step towards him, hands in a surrendering position, “you did not kill dumbledore” he said. Draco’s expression changed, “potter, what?” he said in disbelieve.
“ever since I started having nightmares about you, I knew I had to find you” said Harry wiping away Draco’s tears with his thumb. “that at the bookstore, I didn’t just run into you, I came there purposely to see you” he said with a sheepish look. “stalker, I knew you were following me” said Draco with a smug smile.
i know i know, why there has to be a Jake, but hang on a little guys.
Harry was about to say something when they both heard, “Draco". Harry turned to see the man. The man approached them. He stood beside Draco and looked at Harry wryly.
“yeah, every damn one, nothing”. Alice was one the best in her field, if she says she checked every record there is no way she would have missed Malfoy name in the muggle registrar. “can you find the connection the Black family has to the medallion, go to my house library, maybe something is there in the old books”
“hey,” his mother called softly. She was standing tall, dressed in the finest of the silks. The only difference was that her face wore a soft smile instead of that hard make-up used to hide all that is beautiful about her.
Draco looked at the warily, “I’ve never been on a bike and what about my dress?”, he made a gesture to himself . Harry looked at him with a smirk, “scared Malfoy?”. “you wish potter”, but his words had no venom like they had in school. He took the helmet from Harry’s hand with look that said
, though he, and laughed his way to his bed and fell into a peaceful slumber the moment his head hit the pillow.
The train was already on the move. Draco didn’t participate in the game so he sat there drinking his beer slowly. He watched as his friends and his ex-enemies enjoyed a simple game of truth and dare.
"Who's the guy?" asked Alice.
Draco noticed that everyone was looking at him and he got a little self-conscious. Harry leaned in his ear and said, “you look so beautiful Draco”. Draco flushed so hard at the compliment and the way his name on Harry's tongue that it made him forget his worries about any prying eyes.
“Tea, to sooth master. Does master want Kreacher to call someone?” asked Kreacher. Harry wiped down his face with his hands and said in a voice laced with grief but still he managed to put up a light smile for Kreacher,” thank you Kreacher, and no please don’t call anyone”.
Once he apparated to London he took off his cloak and called Malfoy. “where are you right now?” he had no time to explain, first he needed to make sure Draco was safe. It won’t be long before Jace finds out that Harry lead him to a dead end.
“What?” asked Draco, how could they have possibly known. Ron pointed towards Draco’s neck. Draco’s eyes went wide as he felt all the hickeys Harry’s left on his neck. “you brute!” he turned towards Harry who had a proud smile on his face and Draco just wanted to die of embarrassment as everyone started laughing.
“can’t Kingsley help you? After the war he helped me disappear, got me a job and everything”. Harry sat up on his elbows, “wait, Kingsley knew where you were?” he said, confirming his thoughts.
“neither, I just have a personally vendetta against the Malfoys, but I assure you my personal reasons will not come in the way on this case, it’ll only serve as motivation to find him”. Harry swore he’ll never let this man go even an inch closer to Draco let alone find him.
He walks over to Beatrice who was going through his liquor collection, “all the money and you still can’t buy a proper bottle of gin” she said. he gives her a shy smile, “Beatrice, I know I shouldn’t ask you but could you to stay here and keep an eye on Kingsley and Alice?” he asked.
, he also wanted to seem interested.
“then we just need to find a way to make you do it on will” said Billie
Harry appreciated his presence and the silence. He looked out the window and saw the moon emerging from behind the clouds. He thought back to the dream trying to make out something to figure out who the man. It was just pain and agony.
He got up from his bed, it was almost past 4 pm. He washed his face and buried all his thought about Potter and changed for his shift at the restaurants. Sure, living in a muggle world was peaceful but it wasn’t cheap even with two jobs Draco struggled a bit. He locked his apartment and went about his day.
He cursed the time for going too slow and hopped into a proper bubble bath with candles, yeah, he’s a grown man who likes taking bubble baths, sue him! He felt like going on a blind date, the only difference was the other person is completely oblivious of this little information. Harry spent half an hour thoroughly cleaning himself.
“he’s right” said Harry looking at his team. They all seemed to already know what he was thinking. “there’s a lot of risk” said Mo. “yeah, but I can’t let him descend into some mad person either” said Harry.
Eyes were still locked onto each other, neither wanted to move away. This time when Harry kissed him, it was gentle but firm. Draco sighed in the kiss and brought their foreheads together. Harry caressed Draco’s cheek lightly.
Draco took the chocolate and took a large bite of it. He didn’t even realize how thirsty he was until Harry handed him the water bottle. Finally, he had the strength to look around.
. He didn’t see any physical injuries on him. “Killing them one by one by was a lot of work. Months ago, we came to find about this medallion. I know Billie had it figured out by about how it works. We are going to bring back our father. See he was the mastermind of this whole operation. Unfortunately, he died due to cancer, not even wizards can figure out how to cure that. What’s better than to bring him back as the minister of magic.” She said with an evil smirk. Harry couldn’t even recognize who she was anymore. “you’ll never get away with this” he growled.
Billie poured down the potion making a line just below the window. The potion created red smoke that spread like wated and created a gap enough for them to cross over
“you bastard, get away from him!” said Harry pointing his wand towards Jace. “now, Harry drop your wand, don’t make me hurt Mo” she said again pressing her wand more forcefully. “don’t do it Harry” said Mo.
“are you okay?” he asked nervously.
Seeing Draco like this ignited something animalistic inside him.
“hhhhmmmmm, do 10 push-ups with Draco on your back”. Draco flushed red at his statement.
“I’ll do everything I can to find him sir”, usually he would tell him things that at time he could not trust his team with but something was not right. “I want you to take one of my auror with you” he said gesturing towards the man standing in front of his office.
“No need to be so dramatic Harry. he needs to go through full transformation. His magic is trying to undo the curse but it’s impossible. The only way he survives is if you let me go and complete the spell” she said like it was that easy.
Before Harry could say anything else or before he changed his own mind, Draco sat crossed-legged on his bed and clicked a picture and sent it.
“oh yes, i haven’t decided where I wanna go, do you have any suggestions?”
Harry was out of breath when he reached Malfoy and his hair was even messier than before, Draco just wanted to run his fingers through them. He put his hands in his pockets before he actually did just that.
Handling the phone back he said, “You better make it worth my time Potter” he said with a flirtatious tone and walked away. He turned back over his shoulder and saw Potter was watching him walk away or specifically his ass.
When they reached the restaurant, Draco got off the bike and handed the helmet back to Harry, “That wasn’t as bad as I was expecting it to be”, he said flicking a hair strand back behind his ear. Harry laughed in return.
“Where are we headed?” he said looking around, his strength was still low. “someone I know lives just outside the town, I can’t apparate us there directly. First I have to make sure we weren’t followed” replied Harry taking out his phone. He called Alice.
He remembered the first few days he joined auror team, Beatrice Malice was the head of the team he was assigned to. He remembered how much paper work she made him do. It was after 6 months he was allowed to go on his first field mission, she didn’t treated him like The Golden Boy, but rather someone who had a lot to prove just like everyone else, not for the world but for his own sake.
“hello to you too Harry” said Draco sarcastically. “Dray, tell me, where are you?” said Harry with more emphasis. “I’m at the restaurant, the book store is closed today, is everything alright?” asked Draco worriedly.
_____________________________________
“No, but Ron and I will follow you wherever you want to go." he smiled cheekily.
It took Hermione three hours to find everything about the blood bond she can. “how did you even create a blood bond with Malfoy?” she asked setting down few books and vials.
And moving to muggle London and getting a muggle job only seemed fitting without any magic. Here he could be himself, dress however he wants, be who he wants to be, but Merlin did he missed magic sometimes so dearly. All in all, it was a peaceful simple life.
“I know nothing makes sense love. But you are in your head. Someone is out there trying to keep you from waking up. I really need you to remember what exactly happened that night in the astronomy tower” said Harry, taking little steps towards Draco.
“maybe it’s a blood bond” she suggested. “look I don’t know much but they’re suppose to warn you about the person you’re bonded to when they’re in danger” she said handing him his cup.
“no no no, please No. I’m begging you Jace. Let him go. I’ll do everything you say. PLEASE!!” screamed Draco. “I can’t let him go Draco. If I let any of them live. Can’t let them ruining all the fun we’re gonna have”. He focused on Harry once again. “AVADA KEDAVRA.”
“it’s off record i need it for something I can’t tell and also I need you to keep it confidential." he looked at her pleadingly and she stared back weighing the options
Just as he sat on his dining table, Ron came through the fireplace..
He turned towards Draco to see he was sitting on the ground hands clutching his ears because of the loud sounds. He walked towards and saw Draco was murmuring something to himself looking at wall. Harry realized immediately he was having an episode.
“thank you”, Draco sat up against the headboard and took the plate. “where’s Mrs. Malice?” asked Draco. “she left on behalf of some work. She’ll be back later” answered Harry preparing himself to tell Draco everything.
Harry rubbed his face with his hands and sat down into of the chairs, “earlier today he told me to look for Malfoy, but he already knew where Malfoy is. He’s the one who helped him get a new life. He totally forgot about that. And also someone  erased Malfoy's details from the records of wizards working in the muggle world.” he said. His head held down on the table, already feeling guilty about keeping things from his team.
“I need you find how to break the curse on Kingsley, Beatrice will fill you in on the medallion. It’s hard but nothing the brightest witch of all time can’t fix” he said with a genuine smile. “ of course, I will try my best, after all I’ve got my best assistant with me” she said looking towards Ron and making him blush.
Draco never laughed that much as he did when Harry told him stories about pranking his co-workers at work whenever they don’t have any cases. Harry was surprised that he actually made the blonde snort a few times, which he found was extremely cute.
He kissed Draco softly one last time for the night and closed his eyes.
Mo and Moriarty are the same person. I just gave him a nick name.
He lay there in post orgasmic bliss, eyes closed as he came down from his high. He got up to the bathroom to clean himself.
He's been thinking about texting Harry all through the evening.
He can’t stop looking at Draco though as he might disappear if he moved his eyes even for a second. When they returned to Grimmauld Palace Draco was already asleep in his arms.
Harry didn’t realize that he had used his first name because it felt natural. If they’re going to start new, they might as well at least start calling each other by their first names.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry cleared his throat and Draco realized he’s been staring at Harry openly right in front of everyone. Remember how his mother said they’ve already been through worse, well guess who’s wrong!
i really love comments. they're highly appreciated. let me know what you think of my fic people.
He casted a silencing charm. “I need the records of people working in the muggle London”.
He closed the door behind her, “what’s up boss?”.
“Weasley” he regarded Ron.
They decided to walk a bit so Harry charmed his bike to pocket size. “do you miss it, magic?” asked Harry while they walked slowly alongside each other on the streets. “I used to, in the beginning, it was hard doing everything manually, but I got used to, the more I work the less I think about the… the past” said Draco with a sad look.
She looked at him and rolled her eyes and waved her wand and suddenly the book was not so small anymore.
“You won’t be around to find out.
"You're  the best, Hermione is gonna be so happy, alright  i got to get going, promised George I'll open the shop" Ron said while getting up from his chair, he patted Harry on the back and stole a whole pancake  from his plate.
“Of course, you stupid Gryffindors,” he said in-between his laugh. Harry’s kissed him again. He couldn’t stop now that he’s gotten a taste of it.
“what do you want?” he asked
When they parted Draco looked a little dazed, his cheeks pink and, dark in his eyes covered the grey like an eclipse, lips a bit swollen and red. Harry knew he will never have enough of kissing Draco now that he got a taste.
Draco was filled with giddiness with his simple compliment.
"Yes everything is splendid, i just have to go. i'm awfully late."  All three of them stared at her sudden odd behavior.
“okay, I find a potion to put you in a sleep like haze. You will need anchors on both sides. While Draco is your anchor on another side, Ron will be your anchor on this side” she
“good baby me too, cum for me” he whispered in his ear. And Draco came so hard his whole body spasmed. Harry followed right after.
“Avada kedavra” harry snapped his neck above him and saw it was Draco who did it. No, that’s not how it was. Draco didn’t kill dumbledore. He didn’t.
"Yeah Hermione wants to go, she doesn’t know which one yet and you know I'll never say no, and it'll be fun if you came, i think we need a day just for the three of us."
He composed himself, “No thanks, I think I’ll just take some other compartment,” He said in a plain tone.
Harry stood their trying to get his breathing even before he started rinsing any sign of his thoughts about Malfoy. He took a quick shower and got out, he didn’t shave his beard, it made him look a bit intimidating, brought out the sharp edges of his face, he did a charm to give it its usual trim and walked out with a towel around his waist. He dressed in a deep grey shirt and black pants, he only wore his robes when he had a meeting with Kingsley, other than that he prefered to stay in his muggle outfits. He wore his shoes and collected his dragonleather jacket and headed downstairs for breakfast.
Harry knew he was right, the thought of loosing Draco filled him with dread. He knew if he lost Draco today, he will cast an Avada kadavra on himself without a second thought. “that’s right I don’t think so. Meet me at deathly Hollow at 12pm with my sister if you want your boy alive. Come alone, if I suspect anyone else I will kill him.”
With one flick of his other hand the wand went flying across the room. with one motion of hi hand Mo and Cassie was set free. They moved towards Billie.
“I’d hate to break up this reunion but I really want to play this muggle game.” Said Ginny clapping her hands together. She handed Draco a plastic glass of some cheap beer. “muggle game, muggle drinks”
“tell me every time you go the cafeteria what is the first thing that you ordered?” he asked again. Harry so wanted to be not true right. But seeing how Kingsley struggled to answer simple details about himself only confirmed his suspicions.
The caller was Alice, “He’s a bounty hunter. He joined the force this week only. The day he transferred here he received an amount of 5000 galleons anonymously in his newly opened Gringotts account. Someone on the inside must be covering his tracks. Other than few recent activities, he has no past records, but I’m already tracking his wand.” She finished.
“Harry, I know you have a history with Draco Malfoy but we need to find him and bring him in” said Kingsley with a gentle look. Harry nodded and turned towards Moriarty, “Mo, I want you to check out the Malfoy Manor. Take Alice with you, if you suspect anything, do not engage. Send me or anyone a Patronus”, Moriarty nodded his head and left the room.
He didn’t have to wait long when he got a text back.
The ministry took away the wand of every wizard who was on the side of the dark lord and those with the mark were sent to The Azkaban. Thanks to Harry Potter he didn’t meet the same fate as the other.
Harry left with Kingsley to his office. “I believe that Mr. Malfoy has something to do with this definitely. We need that cursed object in our possession as soon as possible, that ex-death eater scum needs to be put to stop.”. There was something different about Kingsley, he never heard the man being this cold towards anyone, not even Voldemort.
two guards didn’t even see Harry hitting them with curses. He was like a ghost fuelled with revenge for talking shit about hurting Draco. They didn’t even have a chance to even lift their wands. He knew his team will take care of the others well.
“Master Harry is too kind, thank you" Kreacher bowed his head in the highest form of respect, Harry smiled and scratched behind his ears and they both headed to the kitchen.
“I would like to take on the Malfoy lead alone, if you don’t mind sir” Harry said pleadingly. Kingsley waved his hand to dismiss his idea and said, “he is definitely a dangerous man. You might be Harry Potter but you’re not immortal. I’m only looking out for him, take Jace with you, he would not disappoint you” with that he walked away.
"Everything okay?" asked Harry a little concerned.
Draco got back to his apartment studio and fell down face flat on his bed. Running into Harry Potter was not on his to-do list or rather having him pressed behind his back like he imagined so many times.
“c’mon I want to get mehndi, look how pretty their hands look” she dragged Draco over to a small stall where a couple of Indian girls were applying Mendi on other women.
“Hey can i talk to you for a minute in my office” he gestured her to follow.
_________________________________________
“What are you going to do to him” he asked looking towards Malfoy. He looked like he was barely breathing. Seeing him like that broke Harry’s heart.
He googled the address. His first thought was that Hermione would love this bookstore. He looked for near by restaurants and found one- Bafta 195 Piccadilly. He owled Hermione with a note that read
Kingsley showed them a picture of medallion, hanging from the neck of Lucius Malfoy. Harry already didn’t like where this was going. “this is a dark artifact; it holds some curse that could be used to make someone bend to your will and it is a lot stronger than imperious curse. While the imperious curse can be broken, this cannot” said Kingsley.
“hey” said Draco and snuggled closer to his hand. “how are you feeling now?” he asked in soft low voice. “better”, just then his stomach roared, “and hungry” he said, face red with embarrassment. Harry laughed a bit, “here I got you some food” he said picking up the plate of sandwiches from the tray.
Harry knew Draco understood him because he lived under the same room as Voldemort. As they walked their knuckles brushed against each other. Harry took the first step and took Draco’s hand in his own. Harry’s heart was beating out of his chest but he relaxed as Draco interlinked their fingers. Draco gave his hand a reassuring squeeze and looked up at him with a soft smile. They walked in comfortable silence as Harry lightly caressed Draco’s hand.
He saw a notification from Draco and opened it. As soon as he opened it, his smile grew too big for his face. Can’t wait to see you too Dray. He typed that thought attached to a picture of himself, hand underneath his head, with a huge ass smile on his face and sent it.
Beatrice didn’t hire them out of pity but she saw that each of them shown remarkable talents that were going being, no one would hire them because of stupid prejudices. And in return they proved themselves worthy. Harry was sceptical of his team at first but soon got over it when he saw how remarkably talented they all are in their fields.
Billie walked ahead of him, “harry there’s another” she waved her wand towards another drop of blood on the ground. “Draco” he whispered in dread and they both sprinted towards that direction.
"Ohh he's very much alive alright...and changed" Ron said the last part with a squint.
“you”, said Malfoy not more than a whisper, “uhh… hey Malfoy”, said Harry with a sheepish look. “you”, said Malfoy again with a little confidence. “yeah me, sorry to startle you like that”.
He was all prepared for the refusal that Malfoy will say that he already has a boyfriend and all but to his surprise he agreed to go on a date. Correction, not a date, just two ex-enemies going on a dinner together, no matter what Harry’s brain says.
“I’m sending you a picture of another man. Found out who’s he working for, that’ll definitely lead somewhere” with that he cut the phone. Draco walked beside him. He saw how Harry was holding the side of his stomach, “you’re hurt”, he said reaching for the wound. “it’s nothing just a little cut”.
He took the directions Draco told and soon they reached the building where Draco lived. They both got off the bike and took their helmets off. “I had fun tonight, thank you”, said Draco shifting his weight on his feet. “yeah me too”.
"brat" said Harry with a fond smile on his face.
“you guys can use the house however long you want. I know a few people who might have any idea about your medallion “, with that she left towards her floo.
Draco was not sure what to do since he had no idea what Potter might ask but decided to leap
“you expect too much from him Draco” he turned his wand towards Harry, “I’ll show you how it’s done Potter” he raised his wand towards Harry. Draco was writhing violently in his grip and clawing at Jace’s hand. Mo and Cassie were trying their hardest to break through the bonds as well.
He thoughts played the kiss in his mind like a tape on loop, how Harry’s lips were a little rough against his, they fit like a piece of puzzle that was long lost, returned to its rightful place.
“why can’t my life be just boring!” groaned Draco. “that option went out the window when you said yes for a date with me” said Harry with a cocky smile. Draco gave a tired smile in return. He would follow this man anywhere in the world but the situation still made him feel anxious.
The game went on, more stupid dares and truths, but Draco was having a really hard time focusing. It was a long ride and he was doing his best not to move at all and keep his breathing in control and the sudden tightening in his pants.
Draco noticed how much Harry had changed, physically and otherwise as well. He was taller, stronger and he carried himself with more confidence now. Harry got on the ground and waited for Draco to mount his back.
_____________________________________
“Wh–what?” replied Draco not sure if he heard correctly.
The ministry seized anything his family-owned and he donated all his inheritance anonymously to help rebuild Hogwarts and to the orphanage of the children whose parents died in the war. He knew no amount of good he ever did will ever measure up to the bad he committed during the war.
He couldn’t. he throws his wand on the ground and got on his knees, “I’m sorry Dray I can’t” he said through loud sobs, “I’m sorry I failed all of you” he looks towards Billie’s now lifeless body
“you’re smart Granger, you’ll figure it out” he smiled too sweetly, collected his papers, and left
Draco saw Blaise walking towards, he was there to represent the American community in the wizarding world. Everybody knew that Draco was promised to Zabini by his father, but that world changed when Draco broke off the engagement when his father went to prison and proceeded to price everyone wrong who thought Draco will never be able to handle a position of power, including his father.
. At least it was not going how it went with Cho Chang, he still has some space left to fall deeper in the pit of embarrassment.
Draco: "You didn't mean it? I was rather wondering why we hadn't."
“Get lost Potter!” Draco shoved Harry away from the door, slamming it closed behind him and locking it. He could hear Harry chuckling on the other side – the damn prat was enjoying this.
“Intends to harm you, you mean.” Draco corrected, giving Harry a pointed look as he followed suit – sitting in the chair to Harry’s right, before returning his gaze to Minerva. “I believe he may have an altered version of the draught of the living death, and that he intends to slip it Mr Potter’s way.”
Ron: "Are you mad Mione? Malfoy? You're telling me you'd be okay with our best friend buggering that freak?"
“What's going on here?” Harry’s voice was loud and firm, staring down at the three squabbling students.
Give it to ya 'til your screaming my name
I hope you enjoy my story. x
-Uses the Flipendo jinx to send Draco flying backwards onto his arse, hard.
Harry: "Fuck!"
“I think we’re going to need another bottle of whiskey please.” Harry asked, smiling at Draco when Kreacher bowed again and left. “You still up for going shopping with me tomorrow?” Harry asked.
-Draco gets in Harry's face, breathing his words on to it.
“I wish it wasn’t over.” Lilium said, a sadness to her voice. She was sitting next to her best friend Josephine, who nodded in agreement.
-Harry stared at the closed door from which Draco left, perching his bottom on a rickety old desk and sighing, thinking.
Could Draco have been deprived of the joys of snow when he was a child? Perhaps it was too frivolous and ‘silly’ an activity for a Malfoy child to play in the snow. Too loud, boisterous, and childish? Even Harry had been able to play in the snow on rare occasions – always on his own though… unless Dudley and his friends were using him as the target of course. Harry frowned as he thought deeper, remembering more of his therapist’s words…
Swotty bowed before leaving to follow her orders. A level two FGI (for general illness), was simply a small breakfast for someone that hadn’t eaten much due to being unwell, or for someone that couldn’t stomach much due to an illness. It was to be something light, small, and easy for someone recovering. If a particular diet was otherwise required, Madam Pomfrey would be more specific – the reminder that Draco was allergic to Lupine, was just a small example of this.
“It wasn’t reciprocated." Harry explained. "Severus, met my mother before their first year at Hogwarts - they lived closed to each other in Cokeworth. They became very good friends, but Severus made mistakes and their friendship suffered for it. He never stopped caring for my though." Harry paused and sipped at his whisky. "He hated my father, and by extension, he didn’t like me - I think I reminded him to much of James. My father saved his life once, but it was my godfather’s fault that he needed saving at all. He repaid that life debt in first year, using a counter curse on my broom when it started bucking. Do you remember that?”
"How many Weasley's are there?" Draco asked, blinking in disbelief when Harry panicked that he'd forgotten the baby. "What baby?"
Harry: "Even though he's your father?"
-She points to the armchair, and Draco sits.
“Harry, you don’t understand. My mother
“And what pray tell, has brought you to that conclusion?” Draco sniffed the air like a pompous prat, but his lips twitched at the memory of words... hundreds of words from one non-judgemental, kind, and challenging man.
Draco: "What did she do to set you off?"
Draco: "Yep. Well, most of it anyway."
"Does he no longer feel the Nimbus 2000 to be satisfactory?" Draco was curious about his cousin – well, first cousin once removed – and he had yet to really speak to Andromeda beyond letters.
“Hey! This is from Molly. She always makes one for me, and I happen to think this has much more value then something meaningless and expensive.”
Awake?
“Why should that concern me?” Draco asked. Harry shrugged.
It’s almost tragic when one hesitates to trust and accept, simply because you
Harry: "Shut it Draco!"
“Why?” Harry asked, holding Draco tightly against his chest as the man cried out his protests.
“Shut it, Potter.” Draco grumbled, but he still jumped at the chance to protect and recover his perfect appearance.
Draco didn’t return for a good ten minutes, and Harry was just pouring another glass of liquid courage when the man walked into the room. Draco put his empty glass down on the coffee table expectantly, which Harry happily re-filled.
“Oh really? Show us then!” Harry challenged him.
“Really?” Minerva sounded shocked. “That must be difficult, what with her standing marriage to Lucius.”
Ron spat, scowling at the entrance to the Great Hall. Harry turned to see Draco, right before a certain radio appeared on the table. Golden light erupted once again, and the music started.
Harry: (mumbled) "I don't have a hero complex."
Blaise: "With Potter?"
Harry tried to nod, but the spinning room threatened to make him vomit again. He tried to grab the potion vile, but he was too off balance and his hand grasped at air. Still gasping for breath, he felt a hand gently tip his head back so he could take the potion that Draco was now pouring into his mouth.
The sudden, drawn out moan, had Harry turning to face Draco once more. Draco had taken a bite of a chocolate muffin, his tongue darted out to the side of lips - not wanting to waste any of his chocolaty treat. He failed to noticed the way Harry was now staring at him, nor the way Harry’s tongue slithered out to wet his own lips as Draco took another bite at his muffin.
Harry: "That's why you don't have any tea isn't it?"
cold!
When everyone had departed the classroom, Draco folded his arms and sneered at Silas. It took a lot for Harry to stop comparing Draco to Severus, to stop thinking about Severus, but he was determined to listen to the blond and not let him mind wander.
Harry: "I need to think about it. I need time."
Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Harry sighed. Oscar would insist he had nothing to do with it until he was blue in the face and then some. Harry couldn’t prove it was him, and it to be honest, it wasn’t something he would expect of Mr Oscar Haines.
Harry remembered reading … Merlin, they were being literal, he realised.
Draco: "Harry ... I know I have the manor back now, but I don't wish to step foot in that place let alone live there.  I was wondering if you wouldn't be opposed to me living with you?"
“Then good for her!” Minerva said, stopping him from dwelling any longer on his pathetic excuse of a father.
By the end of the letter, Harry's cheeks were aching from smiling so much. Draco's was a first class, pompous idiot, but he loved Draco's way with words. Despite some of the more embarrassing content, he re-read the letter multiple times. He could hear Draco's voice as he read the words, imagined him rolling the quill in his fingers as he thought of what to write, and visualized the way his head would tilt as his quill formed words over the parchment.
Harry was back to staring at the magical parchment, but this time he was in his private chambers, sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by essays and homework he had yet to grade.
have appreciated someone to talk to that would understand!”
never intended to make. I lived with a piece of him in my head for sixteen years, and he even possessed me at the end of fifth year. That was
“What are you doing?” Draco asked.
Draco watched Harry disappear around the corner before closing his door. He sighed; trust Harry fucking Potter to leave an imprint on his heart, to worm his way into his life and make him feel things that should never be or never will be. He had Padfoot to think about, and he really hoped that the mystery man could make him forget all about his new feelings for Potter. Something however, was telling him … that wouldn’t be the case at all, and he’d have to make a choice sooner or later.
“Not tonight, Curtis was just going to study anyway… like always.” Colten rolled his eyes; his twin brother was sorted into Ravenclaw.
Then Kreacher disappeared, taking Draco with him. Harry shut and locked his door, and headed straight to bed. He would clean up tomorrow. He flopped down on the bed in his clothes, and was out like a light.
Draco almost sighed in relief; his feelings for Harry were like weeds, ruthless and persistent, unwanted and difficult to eradicate, they would only strangle Harry: Harry deserved better, and he would remain loyal to Padfoot… Padfoot! Perhaps it would be wise to ask Padfoot to meet him… if his feelings for the mystery man could indeed be true for the real man behind the parchment, then … perhaps his relentless growing feelings for Harry would abate, cease. It would also stop whatever ridiculous feelings Harry had started to develop for him, because Merlin… Harry's reaction to revoking their friendship had been almost passionately decisive, fearful even.
Draco falls against the wall, and runs is hand through his hair.
“Mmm. I’d advise more greens, but I fear my concern for your diet would be ill received.” Draco drawled.
Neville looked as if he believed the girl – at least to some degree – but Harry wasn’t fooled at all. Miss Payne was obviously lying… the girl was hiding something.
Harry slumped back into his chair and relaxed slightly. Could that be all it was for Draco, a simple curiosity? Or maybe he was trying to get information out of him regarding his condition, gain information that he could later use against him.
“If we contact the Aurors he will be locked up for life.” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear. “You know Graves will take any chance he gets to throw away the key.” Harry paused. “Let me find out if its really him that cast that spell?”
Professor McGonagall: "A magical muggle radio? You expect me to believe that your lives are being manipulated by a cursed muggle radio? That you two - of all people, are being coerced together by music, and are losing periods of time from your lives?"
Harry knew Tau faced constant alienation and enmity for his past, whatever that past may entail, and he couldn’t help but feel like Tau was comparing himself to Elliot. If he was right, he wondered how much Tau related to the character. It had occurred to Harry a few times, that it was too much of a coincidence that Tau should recommend ‘Faults of Alliance’ for him to read. It was the first book Tau had recommended, and he did say himself that he was more than curious of his opinion.
“Minerva asked me to stay and I agreed.” Draco said.
Harry: "You should have just told me, now I feel bad for bringing you here."
Climbing into bed a few minutes later, he almost knocked his magical parchment and quill onto the floor when he lifted the covers. He went to put it away safely, but he noticed the words were no longer his own - Tau had replied.
Heat it up
“I saw the journal in a muggle store. I knew you were named after the Draconis constellation, and the Dragon just… yeah.” Harry rubbed at the back of his neck.
“That was the past Draco! I don’t give a fuck about that.” Harry told him, meaning every word. Draco rubbed his face and Harry thought he looked confused.
Harry stood, mildly shocked for a few seconds, then he shook his head and chuckled before rushing of to see if Draco was alright.
That morning haze – and blindness – of waking up, made Harry groan as he patted his hand over to the bedside table in search of his glasses. Thump! He lifting his face from the pillow to see what he’d knocked onto the floor in his blind search, but the light from the arched window was forcing his eyes to scrunch tightly closed, and as things were blurry anyway without his glasses, he continued to find his spectacles first.
-Lucius appeared in the images, removing his Death Eater mask in the department of mysteries, and pointing his wand at a fifteen year old Harry.
future would bring, but he knew it had to include Draco.
Draco: "Why? Its not as if i'm not there, and it's my choice to watch."
As soon as the door closed, a golden light erupted outwards. The light grew - passing a gulping Draco who recognized the magic, and it continued to spread like a wave until the entire school had been turned gold. Then the music started, taking over Harry and Draco like before.
Harry and Ron: "What?"
“Yes, Sonixies! They are Imperceptible to the naked eye, and are a species of pixie that bite when irritated or angered. If you wish to know more, I suggest you find a book. Right now, I need to visit St Mungo’s and request three vials of the Warmendall potion. It will not cure him, but it will alleviate his symptoms. He shouldn’t be left unsupervised – the drastic drop in body temperature, and the virus itself, causes childlike behaviour and hallucinations, and he must stay as warm as possible. I will have him moved to the infirmary once I’ve administered the Warmendall potion, but can you stay with him until I return?”
Harry remembered how Mr Graves was particularly interested in Mr Avery. If he didn’t know any better, he would have sworn that the man was shocked at the fact that ex-death eater - Mr Avery senior, had even sired a son. They hadn’t yet spoken with Silas - as far as he was aware, but they’d promised to return once they’d reviewed everything back at the ministry. Harry didn’t know what they could do however, there was still no evidence to implicate Silas.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, appearing at his side.
coffee. Could you also bring me some toast? I don’t think I will be attending breakfast this morning.” He requested, wondering if he could even stomach toast right now.
-Thursday 11th March: the outskirts of the forbidden forest. Draco slams Harry against a tree, whispering into Harry's ear before licking it, teasing it with his teeth. He slowly starts to sucks on Harry's neck, working his hands down until he finds his prize.
Pop! “Master Potter be calling?” Kreacher bowed.
Draco swished his hand in circular motion, and Harry’s robes billowed until they fell straight and crease free.
Draco and Harry were walking through Hogsmeade the following week. They were currently in the middle of a conversation.
-Tuesday 27th October, Harry, Ron, and Hermione - see Draco outside knocking over a second year Hufflepuff as he walked passed him, laughing
“Potter?” Draco’s voice suddenly caught his attention and he froze. He hadn’t even realised that Draco had opened the door.
“Leave him! He’s just a boy.” Harry insisted.
been released since the Nimbus 2000 was made in 1991.
“Well, you can’t have ice-cream because it will make your cold hands and feet worse. You need to eat something warm, like that porridge.” Harry explained, pointing to the tray that sat on the table at the bottom of the bed.
Goblin: "Vault 1328. Stand aside!"
It was confusing how protective he felt towards the man right now. Whenever Draco regressed in age, Harry had the sudden urge to… what? Parent the man? Any other time he’d been in the man’s company – when Draco
'Harry Potter,
“Then what are you trying to say Miss Payne? The state you were in, that doesn’t happen just because one is afraid of disappointing a professor, or making a mistake with a potion. Your reaction was one of pure fear and panic.” Harry let that sink in before continued, noticing that Neville was now frowning. “I’d like you to tell us what really happen, Miss Payne, the truth. I can assure you that you will not be in any trouble.”
Harry laughed as he reread a certain question on his parchment that night – a question that Tau-Draco had asked him.
“Why do I feel like there is history between the two of you?” Draco suddenly asked. Harry was impressed with his observational skills.
“It isn’t pity!” Harry interrupted him, his voice turning grim. “I know how it feels. I never had my own family to spend Christmas with. I had one year with Sirius, but he wasn’t related either – not really.”
Draco filed it away in the 'strange things about Harry' section of his mind for later. He knew a lot about Harry – his favourite foods and drinks, his hobbies, his sleeping habits, his tendency to skip meals, the way he rubbed at the back of his neck when embarrassed, and the way he bit the left side of his lip when thinking… but he hadn't known that Harry was claustrophobic. Well, that begged the question… why hadn't they just taken the stairs?
The train whistled loudly as a wand came speeding out of the storage carriage window, Draco couldn’t believe that it actually worked – wandlessly too, and more importantly, he couldn’t believe that Harry had actually done that. The train then started to leave the station, picking up speed until it was speeding its way towards London.
Harry pushes Draco again.
Harry nodded. “Thank you!”
Harry hand to drag himself away from his thoughts and focus on something else; he still found it hard to think of those lost in the wars that Voldemort had caused. He looked at the magical parchment instead, and was fairly surprised at his building anxious feelings - impatient for a reply from Tau. He wasn't a teenager with a stupid crush, so he shook his head and decided to continue grading the essays of his students - reminding himself that he was in fact, a thirty-year-old adult with a job.
Harry: "Why?"
“Do you get off on playing the bloody hero and-”
Welcome to my Chérie, parchments and quills story. I hope you enjoy reading my Drarry fanfiction and are kind enough to leave lots of comments if you do XD.
“Indeed. They were making the draught of living death a couple of week ago. I believe that some of Mr Avery’s potion had been missing at the time – the quantity was off even after he’d handed in his sample, but I can’t prove it. I tested the sample myself; it appears stronger somehow –- more potent. That is rather worrying.”
“See ya Harry.” Draco called, Harry just about hearing him.
, that made him less than enthusiastic to write sweet nothings in return. There was also his desire to start distancing himself; if he expected Draco to reject him once he knew the truth, then he would not be so hurt when it actually happened… well, that was the theory at least. If truth be told, he was also feeling bad, and the idea of losing Draco was already casting grey rain clouds over him.
-Draco drops a dung-bomb in the library nearby Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Draco: "I'd have probably done worse. Remind me not to infuriate you too much."
Harry stood up to go and order. Draco sat up straight to protest.
Draco gulped down a mouthful of whisky, obviously weighing up his options, but in the end he nodded. “Show us then Potter.”
-Images of Voldemort with a wand to his, his fathers, and his mothers throats.
the meeting.” Alluded Minerva McGonagall, eyebrow raised at her ex-students. She’d obviously not been expecting anyone to stick around after the short staff-meeting they’d all just had - regarding Halloween, and especially not Malfoy and Potter - together.
It was perfect, so perfect even the radio popped in silently before working its magic.
“Open them then Potter,” Draco picked one up and handed it to him, “It would be rude not to thank them for the gifts when we get to breakfast!”
He knew Tau was Draco – he fucking knew it!!! It was just that, having the evidence slapping him in the face was a whole new can of worms. Yes, he still had that tiny, minuscule feeling of in denial - what if it was all just a big coincidence, and what if Draco had a totally different chérie that wasn’t him at all? He scoffed at himself –
