[The scene cuts to Harry walking into a chic-looking salon in central London and greets Jonathan, who’s waving wildly at him.]
Albus walked over to Ginny and raised his arms, waiting for her to pick him up. She snuggled him close and Al leaned in, first giving her cheek a wet kiss and then moving to whisper in her ear. Ginny nodded at whatever Al had said, and gave him one more squeeze before setting him back down. “Listen to your father, my little monsters.”
But no, here was Potter, closing the space between them with his arms outstretched. They were almost the same height now, and he wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and squeezed weakly. Potter smelled like cooking oil. It was quite pleasant. Draco belatedly realised that he should return the gesture, but Potter was already pulling away when he’d begun to raise his own arms.
Draco smoothed a nonexistent wrinkle from his pale pink cashmere sweater, took a fortifying breath, and rang the doorbell to the Potter’s home in Shoreditch. Scorpius was practically vibrating with excitement. Draco was vibrating with nerves. Where his son had talked non-stop about his upcoming playdate for the past week, Draco had thought non-stop about seeing Potter again.
Harry shrugs. “I guess I was just nervous that it was something you’d never do, or that you might be offended that I asked you to put on such feminine things.”
Draco climbed onto the bed and over Harry’s legs so that he straddled him. Draco leaned over Harry and licked a strip from his nipple up to his neck, and began kissing him again. Harry was more than happy to let Draco take the lead, as it was clear that he had specific plans in mind. Harry brought his hands up to caress Draco’s arse, kneading the soft flesh as they continued to rock against each other.
“Get over here, Teds,” Harry extends an arm out to where Teddy is scowling at his parents. He rolls his eyes but allows himself to be pulled into the embrace.
“Blimey Hermione, you’re right!” Ron said loudly, startling Harry out of his reverie. Harry looked across the table to where his two best friends sat and noticed that Ron was staring at him and looked slightly ill.
“What’s the name of that muggle god, Harry? The one that they always call out when they’re upset or having sex?”
“What the actual fuck, Potter.” Malfoy turned to look at Harry, confusion plain on his face. “I bet we could’ve gotten her to switch partners in another day! I know Blaise would appreciate my suggestions to improve his excavation techniques.”
Malfoy put his hand up for Harry to stop talking and shut his eyes. “I’m perfectly fine, thank you. Just going to get into bed. Goodnight, Potter.” He flicked off the lights, leaving only the light of the moon in the cabin.
“What can I do?” Draco stood next to Harry at the counter, watching him arrange the cake on a plate.
I rise up slowly until he almost slips out of me before slamming myself back down again. I repeat that move a few more times, relishing in the groans I’m eliciting from Harry. I’m done teasing, though; my own cock is throbbing and I shift my angle around, trying to find the spot that will make me see stars.
“No, no, boychick!” He waved his hand dismissively. “Who among us wasn’t something of a schmuck when we were boys?”
Harry chuckled and bumped his shoulder against Draco’s. “Don’t do that. You don’t have to be an arse to cover up your discomfort,” Harry said, turning to look Draco fully in his eyes. “I mean all of it. I think you’re completely wonderful, yeah?”
Harry stood up to look Draco in the eye. They hadn’t spent a night apart in the week and a half since they’d began shagging, and he wasn’t planning on changing that when they returned to their dorms. In fact, he didn’t plan on changing that when they were done at Hogwarts. If he had his way, he’d never spend another night without Draco, full stop.
He reaches his hand into the pile, grabbing at random. “Aha! Look at these…” Harry breaks off with a choking sound. He’s brandishing a pair of lacy red knickers.
“It did take Saul about two hours to teach you how to use the word processing program…” Harry began, smiling at Draco who scowled in return.
“And once he got the basics down, he was a pro!” Saul said jovially, patting Draco on the arm. “We’re going to set him up with an email account next week.”
“This is quite a moment in Queer Eye history,” Karamo passes around a box of tissues. “Love confessions and an adoption!”
“Just a tick! I know I haven’t been in ages but I didn’t think it would be so hard to find this...Ha! Got it.”
“But of course you didn’t stay gone. You and Hermione started faffing about, solving ages-old problems and making huge strides in potions and healing. You opened yourself up to learning all about Muggle science and I was blown away. Not to mention the way that Hermione would chatter on about you, particularly after Gin and I split, extolling your analytical mind and never forgetting to share just how witty and hilarious you are. If I didn’t know better, I’d say that she was on to my obsession with you a bit before I was aware of it.”
James had entered the fray taking place in the kitchen, yawning and shuffling over to get his favorite cereal. “Morning Aunt Hermione, morning Pan - err, Aunt Pansy.”
“I promise you, it’s not,” Pansy said, eyes flashing as she prepared to spin. “Some of us are just naturally talented.”
His eyes widen and his jaw actually drops as if we’re in some sort of cartoon, and he just stands there, staring.
“Want me to put these on for you?” I asked, holding them up in front of my pelvis, trying to gauge if they’d fit. They were a black, delicate lace, and were clearly made for men as they had more fabric at the front to accommodate a cock.
“I’m almost four, Albus! And you don’t hafta be careful with me I’m big for my age! Right, Dad?” Lily looked beseechingly at her father.
Harry turned bright red and opened his mouth to protest that this was ridiculous, but to his great surprise Padma, Blaise, Lavender, and
Draco then addressed the three boys sitting across from him, asking if they had been bullied at school because of their fathers’ relationship.
[The camera pans around a pristine bedroom, decorated with dark, ebony furnishings. The emerald green velvet curtains match the bedspread; muted silver accents adorn a large pile of throw pillows that look meticulously arranged on the bed. Three photographs decorate the mantle of a large fireplace, and the camera zooms in on each in turn: the first shows a young Draco with his parents, all three looking rather stiff and serious, the second shows an infant Teddy asleep on Draco’s chest, and the third shows Harry and a toddler-sized Teddy smiling and waving at the beach.]
“I...erm...I...fuck…” Harry tried to close his eyes and back out of the room, but banged his hip on the open door. “OW fuck! I’m sorry I was just looking for a deck of cards and I’ll just go should I sleep somewhere else tonight? Don’t answer that I’ll just sleep somewhere else tonight Merlin’s saggy ballsack where the fuck is the door?” Harry was yelling incoherently, still trying to find the doorknob without opening his eyes.
“Hey, no! I didn’t mean to dampen the mood, Draco,” Harry insisted. “I guess I just thought that, well, we could sort of, err… move past it?”
“You are so fucking perfect for me, love. Every time I think you can’t possibly know me any better than you do, you come up with some new way of surprising me. You know me better than I know myself.”
Harry’s hand wraps around me and pumps and I’m coming within seconds, streaking Harry’s chest with white.
things) she had decided she wanted to help mould young minds. And so, in the hottest April England had seen in generations, she led all twelve of her Eighth Years into the field to work on a dig aimed at identifying a wizarding burial ground from the tenth century CE. They were to use muggle archaeological methods, resorting to magic only when necessary to break through charms or curses placed on any graves.
“Ye … yes,” he tried to reply coherently as he slid to the floor, vaguely aware that Granger’s strong hands were guiding him. She conjured a glass of water and directed him to put his head between his knees. She counted breaths with him until he was able to sit up a bit and take sips of the cold water.
“Obviously. I can’t be expected to spend two weeks roughing it out here in the wilderness without at least having goosedown to comfort me at night.”
“You haven’t even kissed me yet, and you expect me to call you by your first name?” Draco squawked with indignation as Harry once again flipped him around, but was silenced with the soft, searching kiss that Harry pressed to his mouth. They kissed for several minutes, hugging their naked bodies together while their lips nipped and sucked at each other.
, Harry thought, “and I was hoping that you could help me solve that mystery.” He shrugged his shoulders, waiting anxiously for Malfoy to respond.
Draco glanced at his watch. It was Sunday afternoon, exactly fifteen hours and twenty six minutes since Harry Potter had kissed him.
Harry grins and leans in to whisper something in Draco’s ear, who turns bright red and swats at Harry’s arm. “Potter! Honestly!”
Harry walked. He waded through groups of school children in front of the British Museum and dodged men in suits rushing along the streets outside of Parliament. He walked along the brightly coloured houses of Knotting Hill and carefully sidestepped a puddle of sick outside of a pub in Chelsea.
“Yes, but then you wouldn’t have been able to impress the entire school with your corporeal patronus as a preteen, then would you?” Draco’s cheeks were red - he could feel them flushing. He remembered being scared half to death by that stag charging at him.
“I wasn’t going to do this until the weekend, but I think I should now. I mean, I want to. Not should. I’m so sure of this, and I need you to understand where I am with you.” Harry ran across the room, threw open the door to the closet, and disappeared from Draco’s view.
It had been two and a half years, and he felt that he’d been entirely patient enough. He was hoping that Saturday night would not only be a celebration of Hannukah, but also of their engagement.
“I don’t understand. I thought you were already my dads?” Teddy says, not looking up from where the papers are clutched in his hands.
“Harold, my love, come to the bathroom!” Jonathan calls from outside the bedroom. “We need to talk about your beauty regimen.”
“Bobby, how did you do this?” Draco asks, now inspecting the antique carpet that covered much of the floor. “This rug used to be in the library at Malfoy Manor.”
[Karamo confessional/interview: it’s clear that Harry and Draco are incredibly doting and loving fathers. Teddy is a bright and fun child, and it’s heartwarming to hear him talk about his life with his dads. What we need to get to the bottom of is why Teddy feels the responsibility to make them happy.]
“Oh yes, mama! Someone call Brittney because oops I did it again!” Jonathan twirls the chair around so Harry can see the results of his cut.
“And you, Mr Auror, will be introducing well-fitting clothing to your wardrobe,” Tan says to Harry, holding up an Oxford shirt in pale green against Harry’s chest. “I can tell you’re the sort to avoid fitting rooms at all costs. But I’m sorry my dear, you’re going to grin and bear it for the sake of your son and for the sake of your bum. It’s my mission to find you something that actually accentuates what the founders gave you, not hide it.”
Draco nodded. “Teddy has always been a kind child, though. Aunt Andromeda has done a wonderful job bringing him up. And you as well, of course.” Draco’s mother had reached out to her estranged sister immediately following the war. Although it had taken a few years, the sisters were now thick as thieves. Scorpius loved spending time with his cousin, and Draco was quite taken with the young man as well.
“Je voulais seulement dire bonjour, papa!” Scorpius always reverted to speaking in French when he was frustrated. “Je n'ai presque pas d'amies en Londres!”
So absurd, in fact, that I’m sitting here in his office at the Ministry at half seven on a weeknight, waiting for Harry to return from a crime scene, wrapped in his invisibility cloak lest Weasley stumble in and see something he can’t unsee.
“Cheers, Hermione! You’re a lifesaver. We just didn’t have the room to store everything here, and it’s Saturday so we can’t depend on the deli to have any free space.” Harry placed a stasis spell over the dough.
Harry smiles widely. “I’ve honestly never seen my hair look this good before. Are you sure you’re a squib?”
“OK everyone, let’s take a look at how our beloved family is faring as they get ready to host Teddy’s birthday party!” Bobby says, settling into the sofa with a large bowl of popcorn. “Antoni, what’s the hold up with our cocktails?”
Harry felt all the blood in his body rush straight to his cock. The idea of Malfoy in women’s lingerie…
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Sure, Potter. And I was almost a Hufflepuff.” He got to his feet, wiping the earth from his trousers. “I’m for bed. You’d better not be too hungover tomorrow and vomit in our trench. You’d probably have to excavate it as a ‘modern intrusion’.’” He gave Harry a nod and turned to walk back to the cabins that served as their housing for the duration of the dig.
Harry could see Malfoy's arm pumping himself furiously, and he had to let go of Harry’s head to support himself against the door. “Gods, yes! Oh, fuck! Potter, don’t stop, don’t stop!” If anyone was stood outside his door right now, there would be no doubt as to their ability to hear Malfoy’s shouts. Harry’s jaw was aching but he wouldn’t have stopped for the Minister of Magic himself walking in on them.
Lily ran to her father and gave him several wet kisses on both of his cheeks. Al rolled his eyes and acquiesced to a quick hug; Jamie put one arm around his dad’s shoulders and shouted, “Bye!” before running towards the Floo.
“Yes, well, you’ve made that clear. Thank you for your hospitality. Please pass my thanks on to Saul.” Draco wrenched open the door and strode out into the night, not looking back to see Harry stood stock still in the doorway, feeling bereft and heartbroken.
[Teddy confessional/interview: I love to cook with my dads! I’m not allowed to use the big knives yet but usually Draco helps me chop while Harry tells us what to do. Mostly I just like being all together, even when Kreacher grumbles about being allowed to do his duty to the Noble House of Black.]
!” Harry craned his neck to glare at the man standing over him. He was crouched in their trench, trying to even out the balk with his trowel, and for the past ten minutes Malfoy had stood at the edge of the scarp and criticised every single stroke Harry had made.
Harry sighed. “He’s probably in the backyard. Make sure you give him a treat before he goes!” He flicked his wand in the direction of the back of the house as Jamie ran to the back door and wrenched it open. Draco cocked his head, silently asking what he was casting.
“Don’t mind him, Tan, he’s just cranky because he owns no Muggle clothing beyond the pajamas Teddy got him for Christmas last year and he’s been forced to wear my things,” Harry explains.
“Have you two ever had an actual conversation about your feelings?” Jonathan asks, ignoring Harry’s misgivings and moving to stand in front of him.
The boy glanced up at Scorpius with a slightly alarmed look on his face, but he answered nonetheless. “Hi, I’m Al,” he said quietly, twisting the marker in his hands. “I’m five, too. I’m drawing the giraffes I seen at the zoo yesterday.”
Lily beamed. Harry reached out to rub Draco’s shoulder, but he shrugged away from him. “We’ll speak later,” he hissed.
“Cheers, Harry,” Draco murmured into Harry’s ear from the seat next to him. “And thank you for including me and Scorpius. This has been an extraordinary evening.”
Harry was stood staring at all of Draco’s exposed skin and stroking himself slowly, head tilted as if considering his options. Draco wiggled his arse and tried to school his expression into what he hoped was an alluring invitation to ravish him.
[Bobby opens the door, revealing an almost unrecognizable sitting room. Instead of heavy drapes, mismatched furniture, and a mess of toys on the floor, the room has been redecorated with a warm, yet clearly child-friendly feel. The large bay windows have been expanded to allow more natural light, and are now hung with gauzy white curtains; the walls are painted a subtle gray, and the house’s original decorative moulding and light fixtures have been cleaned and restored. The fireplace is decorated with framed photographs of Harry, Draco, and Teddy, as well as their extended family and friends. All of Teddy’s toys are now in stylish, labeled bins along one wall. A huge sectional sofa in dark blue dominates one side of the room.]
“That’s very good, Lily,” Draco said politely. He was incredibly grateful that he hadn’t had to go through toilet training with more than one child.
Malfoy bristled. “You laugh, Potter, but you wouldn’t if you’d seen what I saw. I had no idea Granger was so...flexible.”
“We’ve wanted you to be our son forever since the moment we all came home together for the first time, when you could barely walk and talk. This is just a piece of paper that’s filed away at the ministry. In our hearts, you’ve been our son for almost seven years.” Harry meets Draco’s gaze over Teddy’s head, raising his eyebrows and looking nervous.
The timer Harry had set on the oven started to beep. “Go tell your siblings that dinner’s ready, please.” Al ran up the stairs shouting for Jamie and Lily, and Harry carefully slid the pan of lasagna out of the oven. He caught his reflection in the kitchen window and grimaced. He had bags under his eyes and a thick layer of stubble. He was certain he’d seen a gray hair on his head that morning. He was the complete opposite of Malfoy, with his perfectly pressed muggle trousers and stylish haircut. Harry would wager a thousand galleons that Malfoy’s hair would probably never turn gray; it would just gracefully shift from his trademark blond to a very elegant white. He’d look classic instead of haggard, as he was sure his own hair would look in another thirty years.
“Oh. Well, I suppose you know best, then.” Draco turned his body fully away from Harry and crossed his arms. “Lily,” he continued, “we will of course accompany you to your classroom on Friday evening. It would be my absolute pleasure.”
“Wonderful! Devastating! Sickening!” Jonathan says, and presents the salon chair to Draco, indicating with his arm that he should sit.
“It means he’s their grandfather. Err, well...adopted grandfather. Do you know what that means?” Potter responded.
“No, what I said was that she’s only three. And Scorpius is already five and so am I and he’s my new friend. But I didn’t actually tell her that she’s not allowed, Dad.”
“My point, bubbelahs,” interrupted Saul, “is that you can use your words to stand up for yourself and for those you love. Silence has taken the lives of too many.”
“They’re in your breast pocket. Anything noteworthy at school pickup, Saul?” Asked Harry, who had set about preparing tea.
Draco moaned above him. “Yes! Yes! You feel so good, Harry. So good!” Harry continued to hold on to Draco's hips, thrusting up with his softening cock on every down movement. All of a sudden Draco stopped moving, his mouth hanging open and his eyes squeezed shut as his own orgasm overcame him. Hot ropes of come sprayed over Harry’s chest, and Draco collapsed over him, seemingly unaware of the mess between them.
“Well, this is just…” Draco huffed out. Casting one last glance at his son that he hoped conveyed the depth of his unhappiness, he stepped into Potter’s waiting embrace and wrapped his arms around the other man’s hips. He allowed himself to pull him in tighter; this time his face was close to Potter’s neck and as he inhaled he smelled a dark, spicy scent underneath the cooking oil. Draco closed his eyes and allowed himself to really accept that he was currently being hugged by Harry bloody Potter.
“Oh, you have no idea, Harry,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes. “I have fifteen years worth of fantasies.” A trickle of sweat ran down Harry’s neck. Draco leaned over and licked it, eliciting another groan from him. “Would you like to see what else my mouth can do?”
“It seems like this room is the focal point of your home,” Bobby says loudly, apparently trying to change the subject. “I think we could do so much with this space. It’s huge, for one thing, and these windows are amazing. And look at that antique chandelier! I can’t wait to get started!”
Teddy shrugs. “My dads make me really happy. I love being a family with them, but sometimes I get afraid that they won’t always be happy with me here with them. What if I make them sad or I do something real bad and they don’t want me anymore?”
“I know, and with our skin tone? It’s positively dreadful. But mother has always been aces at compartmentalising. Whenever we don our community service attire she acts as though she’s preparing for a Ministry Ball.” Draco laughed. “When our supervisor tried to scold her for altering her ‘uniform,’ she quite literally threw the rule book at him and told him that she’d read every single page and there wasn’t anything against alterations, as long as they were wearing the original jumpsuit. And she’d used all the original fabric.”
As Harry gently fucked in and out of his mouth, Draco reached down and freed his own aching cock from the confines of his pants.
“This is absolutely fantastic,” Harry says, smiling at a large picture of Teddy and Draco in front of a Christmas tree that now adorns a decorative side-table.
Sophia rolled her eyes. “Saul doesn’t read The Prophet - and for good reason, look at the lies they print! - but I don’t live in the Wizarding World anymore so I had to get information from somewhere, fershtay? But we know. I told him all about you, about what a mensch you’ve been!”
Harry sighs dramatically. “I might as well, seeing as how I’ve already admitted it to you while cameras are rolling! Maybe this is the push I needed?”
“It was, as you can imagine, an absolute shitshow. Blaise lit the Parkinson tapestry on fire, Millicent fire-called her ex, and Luna was dancing starkers under the light of the moon, all before ten. The night only went downhill from there.”
“As I was saying,” Saul went on, “the past is the past, eh? And from what Hermione’s said, you’re quite the Potions savant! It’s wonderful to finally meet you after all the these years.” Saul sat back down but he held Draco’s gaze, his eyes twinkling. “And the menu is mostly Harry! All compliments should go to him. Since Sophia’s been gone - my wife, fershtay - Harry’s taken over. And his innovations in the kitchen are a delight!”
Tan gets up. “Oh, Rowena wept! You are stunning!” He pulls Draco over to the mirror, standing behind him.
“Harry! You can’t ask a woman if she’s pregnant. Honestly. How you ever managed to be in polite society is beyond me” Draco huffed, shaking his head.
The Eighth Years and their two graduate student supervisors, Matt and Sarah, were currently lounging around a campfire. Matt was regaling the group with the story of his first excavation - “and then I completely forgot to map in the findspot of the arrowhead before removing it from the soil, and believe you me Dr Song did not let me forget about that one…” - and Harry was feeling warm and content, sitting between Hermione and Malfoy.
When he finally came to the front of the queue, he decided to take his chances with the Roonil and added a side of “Harry’s curry potato salad.” His order was taken by a rather burly man with a thick brown beard and a warm smile, wearing a button down shirt with the name “Dudley” embroidered over the left breast. The chef kept to the kitchen, apparently, as after a five minute wait Draco saw a disembodied, tanned hand push a brown sack through a small window behind the register. “I’ve got one Roonil Wazlib with a side of Harry’s potatoes?” The man at the register called through the crowd. Draco came forward to claim his order, and hastily made his retreat back to his lab to enjoy his lunch.
I turn slowly and fold myself over the desk so that my arse is in the air. I glance behind my shoulder and see that Harry is looking at me with something akin to reverence. I wiggle my bum in invitation.
Potter finally turned to Draco, hand outstretched and eyebrows raised, a smile on his handsome face. Draco had watched in silence as his son interacted so easily with the man he’d been infatuated with since adolescence. But then, Scorpius hadn’t inherited any of his father’s neuroses; he could carry on a conversation with a brick wall.
“Saul, don’t!” said Potter, just as Saul opened his mouth to respond. “It’s not a very nice word, Scorpius. I’m sure Saul won’t repeat it, will he?” Potter gave the old man a meaningful look.
“Pip pip cheerio! We’re here in the land of the Beatles, Austin Powers, tea and crumpets, and the QUEEN, queens! Hell yes we’re in Jolly Old England!” Jonathan says, clapping his hands and bouncing in his seat. “I cannot wait to find us a Mr Darcy standing on a windy moor with his hair whipping around like a Willow Smith daydream. And a special ‘hey girl!’ to our magical viewers, who are getting these episodes absolutely free with the new International Wizard Broadcasting Company. Welcome to the world of no-maj technology! Who’s our first ever magical assignment Karami-bear?”
“You’ve never insulted me in my dreams. I suppose I’ll take the chance.” Draco allowed his eyes to flutter open, and Harry’s face came into focus.
Ginny nodded and gave Harry’s hand a squeeze. “I’ll be by Thursday to pick up the monsters. Don’t forget to ask Saul about the recipe book for Mum, ok?”
[Scene cuts to the newly renovated living room, which has been decorated with an under-the sea theme, complete with undulating papier mâché giant squid, balloons, and fairy lights. A small crowd has been assembled: Hermione, Ron, other assorted Weasleys and their children are scattered about. Narcissa Malfoy stands speaking quietly in one corner with Luna Lovegood.]
“Yes, but it’s important to make sure that you’re ready to have such an intimate connection with the other person. Or people.” Draco responded.
“Ummm, ok so Harold? Eyes back here. Just because you’re stumbling through your morning routine doesn’t mean that your skin and hair have to suffer. We’re going to get you fixed up to glow like the bronzed god that you already are, under all that scruff. Maybe Mal-Mal will make you some more personalized products, hmm?”
“No, Al. I’m not mad. I just wish that you would be more considerate of your sister. You know she looks up to you.”
“Please, sir, I promise that the prat who went to school with Potter is not the person who stands before you today,” Draco tried to explain, horrified that this man had heard all the terrible things that he’d done to Potter at Hogwarts.
Draco set the spoon he’d been holding down on a napkin and set both hands on the flat surface of the table. He looked back up at Harry. “Are you saying that you weren’t upset that you kissed me last night? That you interpreted my facial expressions in such a way that made you think that I didn’t return your desire for said kiss?”
...well, maybe not so much ‘mortified’ as ‘intrigued and turned on’ to know that Malfoy had had sexual thoughts about him...
“Mm, don’t care. They could use some childhood trauma. Fodder for a Mind Healer in their twenties.” Draco replied, nosing his way down Harry’s stubble-covered neck. He rolled his hips gently against Harry’s, sighing when he felt the other man’s erection pressing against his own. “I want your cock in my mouth, Potter,” Draco muttered the words against Harry’s ear and then nipped at his earlobe gently.
“Ugh, you’re no fun. I’m going to sleep. We’re in cabin 4. Be quiet when you come in, I’m a light sleeper.” Malfoy yawned and made to get up.
“Ugh, we have got to get out of here before I literally move all of my belongings into this beautiful home and demand that you raise me as your other child!” Jonathan exclaims, wiping at his eyes. “This family is simultaneously giving me life and taking it away with their adorable-ness!”
Draco nods and his hands go to his hair before he stops and grimaces. “I keep forgetting that I’ve chopped off all my hair,” he laments. His hair falls midway between his chin and his shoulders, and half of it is currently clipped back into a loose ponytail.
Quick as a flash, Hermione’s entire demeanor changed. She launched herself at Harry and Draco, drawing them both into a tight hug. “Oh this just makes me so happy! I can’t believe it. I mean, I can believe it, of course, you two have been dancing around this since we were sixteen.”
[Harry interview/confessional: I mean, who would want a group of strangers and a camera crew going through their underwear drawer? But, hey, I’m game.
” I request quietly. Of the two of us, he is by far the more vocal in bed (or in office). I’ve often wondered what the hordes of witches who
The two boys looked at each other then, and broke down in laughter. Tears were streaming from Malfoy’s eyes and Harry was bent double, clutching his stomach. He hadn’t laughed that hard in ages. When they’d recovered sufficiently, they grinned at each other and continued to wash the pile of ceramics in front of them.
Tan laughs. “We’ll fix that right away. Draco, you’re a tall drink of expensive bottled water and I think with your complexion, we should stay with jewel tones. How do you feel about cashmere?”
[Scene cuts to Draco, hair wet and wearing a salon cape, again seated in the chair with Jonathan standing behind him.]
“What’s a... a gentile?” Harry asked, remembering that Saul had called him that when he first sat down.
Following his instincts, Harry began to lean into Draco’s space. He came close enough so that his arms were bracketing Draco’s, his hands clutching the edge of the sink. He stopped and looked between the other man’s eyes, giving him time to signal that his advance was unwelcome. Draco’s eyebrows shot up, but he didn’t move out of the way - instead he took half a step forward. Harry closed the distance between them and pressed his mouth to Draco’s, his stomach fluttering as he felt soft lips press back against his own. He inhaled and the smell of dish soap and something faintly floral filled Harry’s nose. He drew back just enough to tilt his head and deepen the kiss, which stopped abruptly when Harry felt Draco’s hand press against his chest.
“Oh please, you luddite. Your mobile, bought circa 2001, is held together with duct tape and literal magic. I won’t be lectured by someone who can’t even figure out how to use text messaging.” Draco’s usually teasing tone was cut with acid.
Moments later the three missing boys thundered down the stairs and stumbled one after another into the kitchen.
“Oh, sorry Mr. Harry! Thank you for having me. Can we go now?” Scorpius looked between the adults, who both nodded. Draco sighed.
“Good morning, gentlemen!” Tan greets them warmly, sweeping his hands around the shop. “Welcome to the first international location of my favorite store, Bonobos! They have everything you need to get fitted out to be the professional instructor and the cosy dads that you are. Ready?”
“Did you have fun today?” Draco said, ignoring his son’s comment. He didn’t feel like he had the emotional capacity to at the moment to allow himself to think that Harry Potter enjoyed spending time with him.
Harry must have liked what he saw, because he suddenly walked forward and onto the bed, settling himself behind Draco and grabbing one fleshy arse cheek in each hand. Harry spread Draco open and bent his head to lick at his furled pink hole. Draco moaned and bucked backwards, shoving his arse further onto Harry’s face.
Draco made a strangled noise in his throat and gripped the arms of the chair. Surely Harry didn’t mean …
Draco hooked his thumbs in Harry’s pants and pulled them down, freeing Harry’s dick from the confines of his briefs. Draco groaned as he looked down at Harry’s cock, which was laying hard against his hip. “Are you fucking kidding me? Of
They sat in the empty classroom for hours, discussing the past two years of their lives and sometimes even delving into their Hogwarts years. When they finally stood up, backs cracking and arses numb from the wooden floor, they made plans to meet again in Hermione’s lab. She had won a fellowship from St Mungo’s to continue her own research into memory studies, and was quite interested in Draco’s ideas.
The night that his father had been sentenced to life in Azkaban, Draco had made his way through half a bottle of Ogden’s finest and then taken one of his aunt’s knives, still lodged in the wall of the manor after a round of torturing muggle born wizards, to his Dark Mark. The result was a grim mixture of pink puckered skin and the faint outlines of a skull.
“Teddy’s room is the first door on the left, and mine is right across from his. He and I share the bathroom that’s second on the right. Draco’s is the third on the left; he has an ensuite bathroom. We’ve closed up most of the rest of the house, as it’s much too large for us and Kreacher can’t take care of it all in his advanced age.”
Potter walked down the short hallway and turned left at the foot of the stairs, taking them into a bright, airy kitchen. To their right was a large sitting room with several cosy-looking couches. Every available space was covered with photos: some were magical, but most were clearly muggle. Draco stepped forward and saw scenes of smiling Potter children at various ages; a man Draco recognised as Saul and a woman he imaged was his late wife Sophia were featured in many of them, looking lovingly at each other while visiting famous landmarks around the world.
“Nevermind, love. Nevermind,” Dean shook his head, exasperated but smiling. “Carry on, you two! Ignore the Irishman.”
Draco’s confused musings were interrupted when Harry continued: “Draco. I’m arse over tits for you. I have been for at least half a decade, even if we didn’t start shagging until you started coming into the deli. I want you to be mine forever, and I want to announce it in front of all four of our children and the rest of our family and friends.”
“You know,” she said when they’d reached the door, “I think you might consider sending Ron that letter. He wouldn’t see it as an inappropriate medium, and to be honest he might actually hex you on sight. I’ll put in a good word, but I think it would help. And as for Harry, well...” she sighed and waved a dismissive hand in front of her. “He’s always been a bit ... odd ... when it comes to you. I know his testimony on behalf of you and your mother was important, though. You might want to send him an owl, too. He’s not much for confrontation these days.” She smiled at Draco. “You’ve changed, Draco Malfoy. I never thought I’d ever want to see you again, but honestly I’m so glad I have. As loathe as I would’ve been to admit this yesterday, you were my only real competition in our year.”
“No,” Harry admits. “Absolutely not. We’ve had moments where I thought, ‘sod it all, I’m going to tell him how I feel,’ but I have Teddy to think about, yeah? What if Draco’s disgusted and wants nothing to do with me romantically, and then it’s horribly awkward at home, and he decides to move out or something? I couldn’t do that to our family.”
“Don’t you dare come.” Draco raised an eyebrow, waiting for Harry to acknowledge his command. Harry nodded, letting the bottle of lube roll away as he fisted his hands in the duvet, more than half sure that Draco Malfoy would kill him via sex.
“Harry.” Draco let go of his dick. Harry lifted his head, making eye contact with Draco. Draco continued, “I want you to watch this. I want you to watch while I suck your cock. Sit up a bit.” Harry groaned and scooted up the duvet so that his back was against the headboard. Draco crawled up and settled between Harry’s open legs.
Draco purses his lips in an attempt not to smile. Instead, he raises an eyebrow and waves his wand at the dresser, which deposits a pile of pants onto the bed.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes and regarded Harry warily for a few moments before nodding curtly and returning to his cushioned chair. Underneath a large umbrella. With a charmed-cold lemonade in a crystal goblet resting in a drinks holder. And a feather transfigured into fan set to oscillate.
Then Hermione Granger came to give a seminar on her research in adapting muggle treatments to aid Healers - she was making great strides in the field of remedying memory loss and dementia in older witches and wizards. She strode into the makeshift classroom that they’d been afforded in the bowels of the Ministry, her head held high with the sleeves of her research robes pushed up past her elbows. Her hair was as bushy as ever, but she had cultivated it to ring her head in an afro (Draco recognised the style from their unit on the cultural movements of the 1960’s and 70’s) that suited her well. She presented her research in a straightforward fashion; the passion she had for her research was evident. Draco’s attention never wavered, although his gaze often flicked to the thin white scars he could make out on her dark forearm. His stomach rolled as he clenched his first over his own left forearm, thumb stroking the scar tissue that lingered there.
Harry thought about the engagement ring he had hidden in his gym bag, bought when he and Draco had been together for three days. It was simple and gold with a tiny emerald and ruby on either side of the word
“And then there’s the biggest reason, but it’s the Secret Reason that Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron told me to keep my lips sealed about so we can’t talk about it here.” Teddy mimes zipping his lips.
“Oh, wow.” Harry said. He’d learnt about World War II at his muggle school, but hadn’t given any thought to the role of the magical community in that conflict. “You were in the resistance too, Saul?” Images of the Order of the Phoenix came into Harry’s mind - Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Snape … his parents... - but he fought to keep the memories pushed firmly away and focused on the sound of Saul’s voice.
“But, I went after him. Because it’s completely uncouth to profess love and then retreat like that” Draco continues. “And we talked. And I told Harry that I love him, too. We love each other in a
Harry pulls Teddy into his lap and gives him a squeeze. “Seconded! I want you to live with me and Draco forever. Until we’re terribly old and you have to take care of us. I love you, Edward Remus Lupin. I’m sorry I haven’t said it enough. And prepare yourself for lots of hugs.”
Draco walks back into the room and closes the door. Harry continues to look at himself in the mirror. “Are you sure I don’t look like I’m trying too hard?” he asks.
Still slightly sleep mussed and scratching at the scruff on his neck, Harry shook his head. “This one is all you, darling.” He moved to the coffee pot and poured himself a mug, waiting to hear how Draco would manage this.
“Good things come to those who wait!” Antoni calls from the kitchen, where he’s assembling drinks on a large tray.
“His full name isn’t Harold, you know,” Draco says, narrowing his eyes at Jonathan, who is attempting to pull on the snitch boxers over his skin-tight jeans.
Draco inspects his reflection. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen my hair look this good. I am truly impressed with your handiwork.”
[Draco interview/confessional: Well, I suppose the Niffler’s out of the pouch. I have very specific tastes when it comes to my pants. And it’s no one’s business but my own. If Harry can’t deal with it, then that’s his problem. Why?
At that moment the front door of their townhouse was banged open and the voices of their children drifted from the foyer. Draco jumped back from Harry at the sound of the commotion, and he quickly lowered himself onto the stool next to the butcher-block island, crossing his legs and taking a deep breath in an effort to will his erection away. Harry grabbed a tea towel and held it awkwardly in front his crotch while he looked around a bit wildly for the electric kettle.
Scorpius’ expression brightened and he began, “I would like to give my time today to Albus Severus Potter, who will present the latest findings from our experiments regarding the growth of mold in a contained environment: in old jam jars underneath our beds.”
[Jonathan confessional/interview: oh mama, that queen is spicy! Did you see the look Draco gave me when I called him Harold? Those two are as blind as their adorable little puppers Troggy if they honestly don’t think they’re both crazy in love with each other.]
Draco is quiet for a moment. “I honestly don’t remember my father ever telling me he loved me, in those words. He told me he was proud of me, or would praise me when I’d done something he deemed ‘worthy.’ He would sometimes pat me on the head, especially when I was a child. My mother tells me she loves me in every letter she writes, but she’s always been a woman of few words. And I remember her being somewhat physically demonstrative when I was a child, hugging me and the like.”
[Back at the loft: the Fab Five are cheering and clapping, watching Harry and Draco’s embrace. “Do you think they forgot the cameras are rolling?” Karamo asks the room at large, taking a sip of his cocktail with raised eyebrows.]
“I’m sure something will work out, Malfoy. Have you tried looking in Canada or the States? The War barely registered over there. And they have some great wizarding universities - Hermione looked into them,” Harry offered.
Draco groaned around Harry’s dick and stroked himself roughly. Harry increased the speed of his thrusts and for a few minutes the only sounds in the lab were the wet slapping of skin and occasional moans of pleasure.
“Oh, Draco.” Said Harry sadly, catching on to his train of thought and shaking his head. “She is, though. She
“Oh ye of little faith! Tan taught me well. Actually, is it too cold out for this shirt?” Harry asks, holding his arms and turning slowly on the spot, letting Draco inspect his outfit. “Where’s that cardigan?”
“Nah, we have a few employees these days. When Gin and I first split, though, it was just me and Saul. Sophia had only passed away the month before, and to be honest it was a mess. Saul is there, though - he never misses a day.” Harry poured water from the kettle an antique-looking teapot and settled a lacy tea cosy over it. “Earl Gray or something without caffeine?”
“Welcome to Weinberg’s deli,” the woman continued, “what a mitzvah, to be able to serve you.” Something in her tone and mannerisms reminded Harry of Mrs. Weasley, although this woman had at least 30 years on her and a strong Northern accent. She turned back to the man, moving her hands to her hips. “Of course he needs matzo ball soup! Mein gott! Saul, get him sat down. And get him a rugelach. Or three. He’s thin as a rail!” She hurried back through the silver door, muttering to herself in the language Harry couldn’t place.
Teddy looks over at Draco and Harry. He shakes his head. “But I know that we love each other because I feel it in my heart.”
“Oh, for the love of -” Granger grabbed Draco’s right wrist and looked down at her watch. “Have you ever had a panic attack, Malfoy?” Granger asked, her voice seeming to come from very far away. “Your pulse is skyrocketing.”
“I’m a squib!” Jonathan says and cocks his hip, looking straight at the camera. “But I don’t need a wand to perform magic! Hashtag squib-love!”
“A six year old called your father The Chosen Fairy? What a little shit! Why weren’t we informed of this?!” Draco shouted, turning to Harry.
“If you’re being attacked, helping someone who’s defenceless, or if Dad breaks the toaster again,” recited all four children in unison.
“Tell me about the potions that you make for your hair and skin,” Jonathan demands as he works his fingers through Draco’s wet hair. “They smell divine! Do you sell them?”
Harry sighed. “Honestly, I don’t know what’s next. Ever since I was eleven, I’d had a purpose, yeah? Defeating Voldemort and fighting evil. Now I feel like I’m just sort of drifting, to be honest.” He wasn’t sure why he was being so open with Malfoy, but it felt good to be able to tell this to someone who wouldn’t try to psychoanalyze him or take it upon themselves to “fix” him. He loved Ron and Hermione with all his heart, but they were never able to just listen to him. “I don’t think I want to be an Auror. I’d be perfectly happy to never cast another curse at someone for the rest of my life. But if not an Auror, then what? I’ve only ever been good at throwing myself headlong into danger. That, and not dying. Well, sort of not dying.”
“It’s not so different than what would have happened to all the Muggle Born witches and wizards, Harry, if you hadn’t defeated You-Know-Who,” said Sophia. “From what the Prophet was reporting, there were already registries and laws against us Muggle Borns. Same thing with the Jews, the gypsies, the homosexuals, the dissenters! It happened in Germany, it happened here! Oy vey izmir, what a mess we humans make of the world.”
casual,” Draco supplies from where he’s perched on the edge of Harry’s bed. “Whenever we visit you, your fellow instructors are generally wearing pressed trousers and button-downs or blouses. And the trainees have special uniforms. But you’re you, so you can wear whatever you like,” Draco says, inspecting his nails.
“Draco, can you rinse these lentils?” Antoni asks, pushing the bowl of unwashed lentils towards the blond.
“I...I just….on the show, people who are really nice and do lots of good stuff get nominated by people who love them and then they get new clothes and new hair and Bobby makes them a whole new house and at the end of the show the people are always so happy! And you two are really nice and do lots of good stuff and I want you to be happy like that.” Teddy looks nervous, and his hair shimmers between dark brown and turquoise.
Harry groaned and threw his arm over his eyes. He had sounded like an absolute tosser this afternoon, and he couldn’t stop replaying the scene over and over in his head. Of course the first time he’d seen Malfoy in over a decade and he’d forgotten to actually make his order, his three year old daughter had sworn several times, and Dudley’s ribbing had gotten increasingly more suggestive as the afternoon wore on.
Jonathan rolls his eyes. “OK mama, I see how it is! Let me be blunt: have you told Harry that you’re in love with him?”
“I swear to Godric if you bring up your colonialist grandfather’s half-arsed attempts at archaeology
“I’ll just come with you now, if that’s OK.” Harry stood up with him, draining the last of his wine. Malfoy nodded and began walking away from the fire.
He looks slightly sheepish, so I cup his jaw in my hands. “Harry Potter. There is very little you could say right now that I wouldn’t do for you.”
Draco looked up at Harry, his grey eyes shining in the moonlight. “I’m sure. Just go slowly.” Harry nodded and shuffled his knees up so that his cock was aligned with Draco’s hole, now shiny with lube. He pushed the tip in, just past the tight ring of muscle and into the warm depth of Draco. They both groaned, and Harry had to drop Draco’s legs so that he could lean forward and kiss him. Draco grabbed both of his legs behind the knees, opening himself further for Harry.
“Bobby and I met at Ilvermorny,” Karamo explains. “Thunderbird pride!” He and Bobby high five. “My sons are both there now. Do you two have kids?”
“Is there anything else you need right now? I’ve got about half an hour before I need to drop the kids at The Borough.” Hermione’s hair was currently under a plastic bonnet, and she was wearing the niffler slippers Harry had given for Christmas about ten years earlier.
Draco scoffed, suddenly remembering just how infuriating Potter could be. “Please. You literally saved not only the Wizarding World, but probably the muggle one as well. You made all the right decisions.”
Harry nods. “Ever. And I got scared, because I was afraid that Draco didn’t love me back. So I panicked, and I ran away.”
“Kreacher is very unhappy with the goings on in the ancestral home of Master Malfoy. Kreacher is expecting this sort of uncouth behaviour from Master Harry, but Kreacher knows Master Malfoy is being raised better than letting all sorts defile the noble -”
Harry chuckled. “Quite a pair we’ve got, huh? Al is always finding a way around what I’ve said.” He turned to the two boys. “How about you two and Jamie finish setting the table, and Draco and I will talk about a sleepover?”
“Why else would you have sex if you can’t make a baby?” Lily had stopped her doodles to pose this question, giving the room her full attention.
Saul entered the kitchen first and raised his eyebrows as he looked between the two men. “Ah, young love,” he said, chuckling. “I remember it well.” Harry tried to pat down his hair, wondering how Saul had known immediately what they’d been up to.
Harry almost stopped to further question Pansy, but he resolutely refused to make a bigger fool of himself than he had already done. Plus, he was still uncomfortably hard from Draco’s description of himself in lingerie…
Harry moaned and felt his own orgasm build in him until it hit him full force, causing him to fall forward onto his left hand and watch as his spunk striped over Draco’s chin, lips, and cheeks.
And so, six months after Sophia died, Harry, James, Albus, and Lily Potter walked into the townhouse next to Weinberg’s deli and began a new chapter of their life.
Saul walked into the kitchen and set about supervising the boys. Jamie reluctantly pulled himself from the sofa and helped once Harry threatened to send him to his room for the duration of the evening, thereby losing the chance to see Teddy.
“Hey! Don’t go. We can talk about something else. How ‘bout United’s chances for the league title this year?”
“Godric help me,” Potter barely spoke above a whisper as he slowly lifted his hands to cup Malfoy’s arse. He kneaded his fingers into the supple flesh, admiring the way his olive-toned skin complimented the pale expanse of Malfoy. Harry leaned in and pressed a kiss to one of his cheeks, then grew bolder when nothing except a muffled groan came in response. He licked and bit at a fleshy spot and Malfoy pushed his arse back, meeting Harry’s mouth and silently demanding more. Harry had never done this before, but he’d read about it in
“What? No!” Harry said quickly. I watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed and he worried at the skin around his left thumb nail, one of his more obvious tells that he’s lying.
“Hullo there. I’m Harry. Yes, I knew your papa when we were younger. We went to school together. I’ve been to Paris, but it was just once and it was a long time ago. I remember quite enjoying the chocolate crepes.”
Harry looks around, scratching at the back of his neck. “Err, yes? I don’t think I’ve actually been shopping for myself since I last grew, so maybe seven or eight years ago?”
Draco lifted his head off of Harry, and bit his lip, giving himself a few tugs before collapsing next to Harry. “I want you to prepare me, Harry. You need to take your time, giving me at least three fingers and making sure I’m nice and open before you fuck me. OK?”
Ten years later, the Granger/Malfoy research team had made huge strides not only the field of memory studies, but also in the adaptation of muggle treatment methods to various wizarding maladies. They had even organised an international conference between muggle and magical medical researchers, getting the British and French Ministries’ approval for the collaborations. While he wasn’t on speaking terms with Ronald Weasley or Harry Potter, he had indeed sent them letters and received - terse though they may have been - responses. Hermione attended Draco’s wedding solo, and while he had been invited to the great Granger-Weasley union of 2003, he’d declined to attend. Though he counted Hermione as one of his closest friends, he didn’t wish to see her day marred in controversy when a Death Eater showed up to the celebration.
Draco and Harry exchange a look and Draco nods his assent. “Of course, Teddy. But Harry and I want to give you our gift first, if that’s OK?”
“I really don’t know. My family was in talks with the Greengrasses before the war, but now… it remains to be seen. I have half a mind to fuck off to the Continent and take a lover in every major capital just to prove to my father that I won’t be conforming to his every whim anymore. But, I’m the last Malfoy and it would break my mother’s heart if I failed to provide her with a grandchild.”
love each other. You need to help them be in love in public! My dads should be happy because they are such good dads and they make me happy, but they look sad a lot I think. Please help them and maybe help our house not have so many spiderwebs. I promise to be a really helpful helper when you come to London so please please please please come and help my dads!
“Because your father has the social skills of a feral cat and I needed to stop him before he embarrassed himself,” Hermione explained to her son.
“Holy fucking Founders.” Malfoy was leaning against the door, his arse red where Harry’s hands had gripped his cheeks. He turned his head and look at where Potter was still kneeling, staring at Malfoy’s arse reverently.
“Oooh, Potter. What exciting new information! How big is it? Can I see?” Pansy looked like Christmas had come early.
“Oi! Malfoy! Enough already!” Harry crossed his arms over his chest, attempting to exude a “don’t-fuck-with-me” air.
“I love you, Teddy,” Draco interjects. “I love you more than the moon and the stars. And I will never not want you as my son, safe with me in our home.”
“Oh stop it, Draco.” Harry moves to put his arms around Draco, pulling him into a hug that Draco does not return. “I was just surprised! Of course I want to cohabitate with you, you berk. And I’m going to keep hugging you until you reciprocate, so by all means, take your time. I’m sure the Fab Five have nothing better to do than watch you pout.”
Tan makes a noise somewhere between a groan and a yelp. “Draco sodding Malfoy is the epitome of a bad boy. Incredibly posh with the cheekbones of a god, but his family was into some terribly dark business during the war eight years ago so he was persona non grata until Harry vouched for him over and over again in the press. I guess those two have gone from arch nemeses to forbidden lovers!” Tan puts the back of his hand to his forehead dramatically. “Honestly, this is like my teenage fantasy come to life! I get to make sure Harry Potter’s bum looks fantastic in a pair of trousers!”
leap of faith, actually, considering we started this room before you two boys got your act together and got with the smooching.” Bobby throws open the door and gestures for Draco and Harry to enter.
“First, I’d like to thank you all for coming,” Jamie said, holding his flute of champagne delicately. “Teddy and I are so honoured that all of you came to celebrate with us today. We love each and every one of you, and you’ve all been so important in our lives.” Jamie looked over at Teddy and winked. “But I’m going to take a leaf out of my Zayde Saul’s book and take this opportunity to kvell a bit about my parents. All four of them!” Jamie smiled at the table where the most important people in his life - besides his new husband, of course - sat. “When I was six, my mum and dad split up,” he continued, “and honestly, it was the best thing that’s ever happened to me.” Teddy let out a surprised bark of laughter, and there was scattered chuckling from the guests. “Because I gained two more parents. I don’t have many memories of my parents being together, but I have more happy memories than I can count of my childhood. Mum, Nev,” Jamie turned to face his mother and step-father. “You two are the most supportive, hilarious, wonderful parents a kid could ask for. Nev, you taught me how to care for a garden and how to apologise to Teddy when I was being an arse. Mum, you taught me how to ride a broom and how to stand up for what I want and what I need in life. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met, and I love you both to the moon.” Ginny wiped away a tear and Neville beamed at his eldest step-son. “And Dad,” Jamie turned slightly to look at his father, who was clutching Draco’s hand and weeping. “Oh, Merlin, Dad! Keep it together!” Harry laughed and mopped at his eyes with a kerchief. Lily got up from her seat and stood behind her dad, leaning down to wrap her freckled arms around his shoulders. “Thanks, Lil! Anyway, Dad, you taught me how to be a good partner and a good friend. You showed me what it means to be strong for your family, and how to make the best pancakes in the world. I love you.” Jamie took a deep breath. “And you, DD.” Jamie smiled at his other step-father. “My Draco-Dad. We got off to a rocky start,” Al and Scorpius burst out laughing. “If by ‘rocky’ you mean ‘terrible,’ then spot on, James!” Scorpius shouted.
Harry took a big gulp of his drink and heard Draco splutter, seeming to have choked on his wine. Harry glared at Ron and gave him the finger while weathering the catcalls and whistles of his cohort. He supposed he deserved that after his previous turn had called out Ron and Hermione for having sex in the bathroom of the Burrow last Christmas.
“Granger. Ah, that is… Ms Granger,” he took a steadying breath, “that was a remarkable presentation. Thank you for taking the time to come talk to us about your research. I’d wondered if you’d looked into the use of antidepressant potions in patients with severe memory charm damage? I’ve been doing my own research into their properties and from what you’ve just said, Healers aren’t concerned enough with maintaining the mental health of the permanent residents of the Janus Thickey Ward. Perhaps you might be interested in discussing this further?” Draco finished in a rush, hoping that he’d managed to get his point out. He was also hoping that he’d not be punched in the face. Again.
Saul leaned forward and smiled. “Oh what terrible manners we have! We speak Yiddish to each other. Nevermind us old folks, Harry. We’re wool gatherers, the lot of us.” The twinkle in his eye again reminded Harry so strongly of Dumbledore that it took his breath away momentarily.
“You’ve been torturing me for weeks, you prat. My turn.” Harry walked backwards a few steps and pulled his old Chudley Cannons shirt over his head and removed his glasses, tossing both carelessly on his bed. Malfoy stood still against the door, his erection tenting his cotton joggers obscenely as he took in the tanned skin and light dusting of black hair on Harry’s chest. “Turn around, Malfoy.” Harry undid the button and zip of his denims, lowering them along with his boxers and stepping out of both so he was left naked. Malfoy gasped a bit as he took in the long line of Harry’s cock, standing to full attention and leaking slightly at the tip. Harry took himself in his fist and gave himself a few rough strokes, his eyes glinting dangerously. “I said turn.”
“Harry, let’s start with you. Why don’t you show us your wardrobe?” Tan says, moving towards the door. “I want you to take us through your current clothing and tell me all about how you choose what you’re going to wear on any given day.”
“Cooking isn’t menial labour. It’s a basic life skill, like brushing your teeth and knowing how to do laundry.”
“I think my favorite is number 3,” he said, mouth full. “But number 7 is also good. Four is rubbish. Too much cinnamon, not enough brown sugar.” Ron judged his own apple sauces and Draco grimaced, trying to avoid being sprayed with half-masticated potato.
Given the amount of people who had gained the knowledge first hand, Harry had little doubt that the news had spread to the rest of their family and friends. It was all for the best, he thought, that he wouldn’t have to see the look of horror on Ron’s face when he first heard that he’d be in-laws with the Malfoys.
“Good,” Harry said. “Also, will you tell Astoria that I fixed this thing between us? She can be right terrifying.”
[Scene shows Draco carrying a giant cake in the shape of several frolicking dolphins, aglow with candles, towards Teddy, who is seated at a large table with Troggy on his lap, party hat still in place.The crowd sings “Happy Birthday” enthusiastically.
“You are such a bloody drama queen.” Hermione raised her hand, palm up. “I solemnly swear that I will not tell a soul that you two are engaged.”
“And now we need to speak to Teddy. He looked quite alarmed by your exit, you great pillock. Come along, Potter!” Draco is already halfway down the hallway.
“OK?” Harry pulled back and asked, feeling spit dripping down his chin. His arse was beautiful and tasted perfect: slightly musky and clean and it drove Harry mad.
“Oh no, honey,” Jonathan says, pausing in his cutting. He moves to stand in front of Draco and looks him in the eye. “Look here, madame. I know exactly who and what I am, and my show is a wonderful, beautiful light in the darkness of this crazy, often cruel world. So don’t come at me with that shade!”
“Potter, are you serious right now? We’re supposed to be closing the trench, not opening a new deposit!” Malfoy was stood at the edge of the scarp, shouting down at Harry. It was the last day of excavation, and Harry couldn’t be happier that they were returning to Hogwarts that evening. He was completely done with Draco’s back-seat excavating.
Lily giggled, her expression turning from cloudy to amused in the blink of an eye. Draco took her hand and they walked out of the kitchen, Lily exclaiming loudly about the virtues of Superman. He caught Harry’s eye and smiled as he left the room. Harry thought that if he lived a thousand years, he’d never tire of that smile or those shining gray eyes.
Al ran into the kitchen then, apparently motivated to appear quickly by the sound of his friend. “Hi, Scorpius! Come on, let’s go play in my room!”
“Yes, I do. Where’s Skops?” Jamie asked, narrowing his eyes and looking very much like Ginevra Weasley.
Draco and Harry smiled dopily at each other. “I’m sorry we didn’t tell you, Hermione,” Draco explained, “but we didn’t even tell the kids until last night. We just needed a few days to let it all settle.”
Hermione rolls her eyes and continues. “As I was saying, Harry knows, and Draco will do anything for Harry and Teddy, so once he calms down it’ll be fine. Just, be prepared for some histrionics. I have duties assigned to each of you.” She pulls out a file folder from the small beaded bag at her side and flips through several pages. “Antoni, I know you like dogs so you’ll be on Troggy duty. That dog needs to be the center of attention and if he senses that people are visiting and not giving him enough cuddles, he becomes irate and for such a small thing he can be quite persistent. Karamo, you’re in charge of managing Teddy. I know you’ve children of your own and you’re the calmest presence, other than Bobby. Teddy is going to be beside himself with happiness when he sees all of you, but if he gets overwhelmed he’ll clam up and then Draco will become a mother hen and probably banish you all to Helsinki. Tan, you’ll need to use your proper British upbringing to distract Draco himself. Compliment him, but don’t be overly complimentary or he’ll get suspicious. He’ll not have the slightest idea who any of you are as he’s afraid of Muggle technology and will only watch the telly if Harry sets it up for him. And none of you are to mention said fear of technology!”
“How did you become so well-adjusted?” Draco asked, looking at Harry suspiciously. “Honestly. What you went through … I’ve read the book. Well, I’ve read all the books about the war.”
They broke apart and stood staring, holding each other at arm’s length. Draco heard the sound of a throat clearing and he sprang away from Potter, brushing invisible dirt from his coat in an effort to look calm and collected, despite feeling anything but.
“It’s one thing to get drunk and fuck while you still happen to be wearing a dress, and quite another to ask you to wear very specific things so that I can get off.”
So of course I, ever the prat, had told him that if he was trying to convince me that his prowess in magic was simply the result of positive thinking, I’d deck him.)
Just then the doorbell rang. Harry took a deep, steadying breath. It was probably just Dudley, he told himself. He heard Saul make his way down the hallway to answer the door, so he returned to attempting to maintain the shape of the flourless chocolate cake he’d been trying to coax out of the pan.
The heavy wooden door swung open, and there stood a slightly harassed looking Potter holding Lily on one hip. She sniffled but smiled at Draco.
Harry shrugged. “Let’s just get this done. You keep your mouth shut about the way I hold a trowel, and I’ll try to be more reasonable about the amount of time you need to finish a topographical drawing. Deal?”
If asked, Draco Malfoy would say that the most irritating aspect of moving one’s life from Paris to London in the dead of winter was the difficulty in finding the particular charm that would repel the salty slush that covered the Knightsbridge streets from the bottom of one’s trousers.
“Yes. Mainly because in my dreams we’ve never stopped at a kiss,” Draco ran his hands up Harry’s arms delighted at the soft feel of his tan skin.
“Oi! Hush, all of you. I had a completely normal interaction with Malfoy today.” Harry set the lasagna in front of his family and sat down. “No more comments from the peanut gallery!”
“To honor Harry’s heritage, we’re going to make a sambar today! It’s a staple in South Indian households and pretty easy to make so all three of you will be able to help,” Antoni says.
Teddy giggles and jumps up, clapping. “Presents!” he shouts again, the sugar from the cake clearly fueling his sudden surge in energy.
[There are several moments before some shuffling and feedback from the microphones stops and Draco’s voice becomes clearer.]
,” I mimic, tsking. I flail around behind me, patting the desk until my hand makes contact with the bottle, which I shove into his hands. “What do you take me for? A virgin?”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry. “Oh please. I bet you’re a right kinky sod in the sack. The Saviour of the Wizarding World: sexual deviant.
Draco was completely caught off guard, so he didn’t react when Harry pushed past him and walked into the lab.
kink, but I have to say that, despite the relative discomfort, I do feel extraordinarily sexy and somehow powerful.
“It’s not my fault that I come from such refined stock! You should be so lucky to have access to the sort of knowledge that’s been passed down to me from generations of Malfoys.”
“Allow me!” Draco says delightedly. He runs over to a wooden door and opens it dramatically. “Welcome to the cave of broken dreams. The worst-kept secret of the Wizarding World is Harry James Potter’s truly outrageous collection of old jumpers.”
“Weinberg’s, innit? Lunch rush and all. Worth the wait though,” he responded, wrapping his arms around himself and stomping the ground. “Colder than a witch’s tit today, eh mate?”
Harry mused. “Listen. Just follow a few directions and we’ll get this done quickly. I’m actually a pretty good cook, and I think this’ll turn out a lot better than Ron and Tony’s ‘meatloaf surprise’ from last night.” Harry shuddered at the memory.
Harry tried to catch his oldest son’s eye, but Jamie kept his gaze resolutely on the table. Harry took a deep breath and began, “in any case, there isn’t anything wrong with being gay! Draco is gay. I’m bisexual. Auntie Luna is pansexual! We’ve talked about this before. Love is love, regardless of gender - or lack thereof - of those involved.”
Jonathan stops cutting and puts his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “Sugar pie. Honey bunch. I’m just saying what I’m seeing, and what she is seeing is not only a whole mess of sexual tension, but also a whole mess of love! The way he looks at you… and the way you look at him!” Jonathan fans himself with his hand. “Are you really telling me there’s nothing between you two?”
[Montage of Tan walking Harry and Draco through the store and loading their arms with various pieces of clothing. Harry looks overwhelmed and Draco looks progressively more annoyed.]
Potter chuckled and let go of Draco’s hand. “Indeed, it has. I...well… The Sophia comes with a hug. The… what you ordered. Your meal. It was her speciality. Sophia’s, I mean.” Potter ran a hand through his hair and looked at the ground. He sounded a bit flustered. “She gave great hugs. So, here, let me hug you, Malfoy.”
“Blimey, it’s hot in here!” He said, setting the bag down on one of the tables and taking off his coat.
Saul stood up and clapped a warm hand on Harry’s bony shoulder. “Now stop right there, boychick. We wouldn’t accept money from you! Come back and see us again, that’s all we ask. You’ve got the look of a warrior to you, Harry; you’re stronger than you know. And now that Sophia’s seen you, she won’t rest until you’ve gained at least a stone! And found a wife. And had a few children.”
forget anything. I remember every insult he threw at me from our Hogwarts days, and can recite with “horrifying accuracy” every single time that he’s forgotten to banish the trash or water the flowers or has made up some inane excuse to get out of tea with my mother.
Harry threw his hands up in exasperation. “I don’t care where you do your ‘prescribed therapy,’ Malfoy, just do it somewhere that I don’t have to see your scrawny arse on display!”
“Scorpius, you’re supposed to stay at your mother and Millicent’s tonight. I’m sure they’d be very sad if you changed your plans at the last minute,” Draco said to his son.
Hermione reached for her drink and gasped. “Draco. Lucius. Black. Malfoy.” She enunciated each syllable of his name with narrowed eyes. “I better not be seeing what I think I see on your hand. Because that would mean that you, one of my closest and dearest friends, was engaged to the other of my closest and dearest friends, who had not deigned to tell me, the godmother of two of their children, that they’re getting married. Because that would be outrageous and would cause me great angst.”
“Shall we go see the rest?” Karamo asks, trying to herd Antoni, who is carrying Troglobite, towards the stairs. “We’ve got a lot more to show you!”
“I think this might be the most times I’ve cried while filming a single episode, y’all!” Jonathan says, wiping tears from his cheeks. “I cannot
“I want you to come on me, Potter. I want you to wank that big cock while you’re staring at my arse, knowing that it was your tongue and your fingers that made me come all over myself.”
“How about we sit down and talk about what happened?” Harry suggests, looking to Karamo who smiles and nods encouragingly.
“I apologise for his manners. We’re ... working on polite interaction with adults. What time shall I return to pick up Scorpius?”
“Ok, ok. We’re engaged!” Draco replied, holding his hands up in surrender. “We had a bit of a domestic on Tuesday and then we had a long talk where Potter reiterated his undying love and affection for me and just went on and on about how I make his life better, and I felt bad for the man so I accepted his bumbling proposal.”
“Bobby, this is fantastic,” Harry says, clapping him on the shoulder. “I don’t know how to thank you.”
hot. I think we’ll have to repeat this, although I’ll have to go shopping. I think these ones might be beyond saving.” I gesture to the come- and sweat-covered garter belt and stockings. “Do you want to talk about why you were afraid to bring up the lingerie thing in the past?”
Harry groaned and pressed Draco back against the edge of the table. Draco felt Harry try to take control of the kiss but he scratched his nails up Harry’s clothed back and he melted against him, ceding control. Draco put his hands in Harry’s messy locks and felt his stomach flip. His head felt simultaneously full and empty: he couldn’t fully comprehend the fact that he was actually messily snogging Harry Potter in his lab. He pulled at his hair lightly, trying to ground himself and make sure that he was present for this experience and not lost in his own head. He pulled back from the kiss and took a deep breath, letting his forehead press against Harry’s. He didn’t open his eyes.
Harry looked around the small kitchen. Next to the hob were an assortment of vegetables; he found dry pasta in a cupboard and milk, ground beef, eggs, and butter in the refrigerator. “OK, Malfoy, what do you think? Spaghetti and meatballs?”
Last winter Sophia had fallen ill and died quite suddenly. Harry and Ginny had spent the weekend following sitting shiva and helping Saul sort through her belongings. They passed long hours going through albums full of photos documenting vacations and adventures, making piles of clothes to give away and filling boxes with tchotchkes to give to the Potter children. After the final load had been donated and Saul had shut himself in his room, Harry had found Ginny crying on the sofa in the sitting room, holding a paper yellowed with age in her freckled hands.
Saul shook his head. “Not me. Muggle through and through. Sophia’s got all the magic in the family.” He smiled at Harry again, peering at him from above his spectacles.
“Harry, how you present yourself directly influences how people treat you. I know you’re the Chosen One, but if you want to be respected by your colleagues and students, then you need to show them the best, most confident version of yourself,” Tan says, holding up a faded button-down shirt the colour of mud. “This shirt says to me, ‘I don’t take myself seriously and neither should you.’ Don’t you want to show the world that you’re a grown-ass Saviour and not a scruffy teenager?”
I frown, because I can’t actually get them off without taking the garter off, and if I take the garter off the stockings will fall. It’s a lingerie house of cards.
Harry looked down at his empty soup bowl before speaking. He wasn’t sure what to do with this information, but he found that he felt a sense of comfort in in the small deli, talking to these kind people without anything being asked of him in return. “I’m sorry if this is rude, but are you sometimes speaking a different language?” Harry finally asked. “Only, I’ve not been sleeping much and my brain feels a bit fuzzy…”
“Clean me up, you manner-less cretin.” Harry ignored him and instead rubbed his thumbs in circles over Draco’s skin, relishing the sight of him covered in cum, looking utterly debauched. Draco sighed contentedly and leaned his head back so that it rested on Harry’s shoulder. “Your worship of my arse will take you far in this life, Potter.”
Harry was silent for a few minutes, thinking about this. “Did you ever see Voldemort exiting his rooms with loo paper stuck to his shoe? Come to think of it, did he wear shoes? Or pajamas? I imagine him wearing some sort of old-timey nightgown and sleeping cap. You know, like in that portrait of Archduke Flanbert the Fatigued near the Arithmancy classroom.”
“You’re in Shoreditch, love,” replied Sophia, standing up with Harry. “I’ll pack you some more soup to take home with you and Saul is going to call you a taxi. You look dead on your feet!”
Little by little, Harry began to tell his own stories. He told Saul about his parents, and about Dumbledore while he helped Sophia to peel potatoes for latkes. He talked about living in the forest, about hunting horcruxes, and he talked about watching Sirius die. The grief, dejection, and anger that felt all-consuming gently abated over time.
“You heard me, Mr ‘I pretend that I don’t understand Ms Jonathan’s questions but I know perfectly well what she’s implying’!”
Hermione looked up from her Transfiguration essay, sighing. After four days straight of this, she knew what that sound meant.
“Al, you know that just because you didn’t say the words doesn’t mean that you didn’t imply that Lily wasn’t allowed. Do you remember what the word ‘imply’ means?”
Hugo and Lily scream-sang the song as they sat in a circle on the sitting room floor, midway into a game with Dudley, Pansy, Saul, and James.
“You died so Draco could suck your cock, apparently. Now go rub up against each other and leave us all the fuck alone!” Blaise Zabini, newly minted Undesirable Number One to Harry, bellowed.
Draco lowered his flannel pants and his hard cock sprang up, jutting straight out from his body. Harry thought that he had never seen anything quite so beautiful in his life. The moonlight reflected off of Draco’s pale skin, making him look like some sort of ethereal being. He had only a light dusting of hair on his arms and legs, and his chest was almost completely bare save for a trail of fine hair that led to a thatch of strawberry blond curls above his dick. Draco’s cock wasn’t as long or thick as Harry’s, but it made Harry’s mouth water, particularly when he took himself in his fist and gave himself a few slow pumps. “Oh, Harry,” Draco breathed, closing his eyes briefly when he flicked his thumb over the slit of his cock, “I’m going to
He threw open the door, not bothering to put his shirt back on. “Listen Hermione -,” he stopped midway through his sentence, completely gobsmacked to see Potter himself standing at the threshold.
“In all seriousness, I need to kvell a bit about my Harry,” Saul beamed and raised his glass of wine. “I count all of you as mishpocha, but Harry is the boy that Sophia and I never had. He came to us out of nowhere, and in the blink of an eye he’s taken over the deli and he and Ginny have given me three beautiful grandchildren. What more could a man want, I ask you?” He wiped away a tear. “And so tonight, I give thanks to everyone here and especially to my boychick. Hashem brought him to me and Sophia when we needed him. When we all needed each other. Cheers to you, Harry. Cheers to us all!”
[The camera shakes as it attempts to follow Draco out of the kitchen. It stops abruptly behind him as he pounds on the door to the bathroom on the ground floor of the house.]
Jonathan claps his hands and does a little jump. “Watch out or I’ll get the impression you actually like me, sweetness!”
“I know who you are!” Ron says, recognition crossing his freckled face.”Fred and George tried to convince you to sell them your tailoring spells so they could get their line of joke-clothing off the ground in their last year at school. They desperately wanted to be able to make Umbridge’s cardigans explode or maybe eat her? I don’t really remember. But they ranted about you for ages.”
Five minutes and many promises of thorough cleanings of said beds later, Jamie waved his hand dismissively and muttered, “nothing new to report. Dad it’s your turn.”
He waved a dismissive hand at Harry before turning to Lily. “Your vocabulary is progressing well for a pirate,
Draco approached the table and opened the tub, realising how hungry he was the moment the salty scent of the soup hit his nose. “Fine. I’ll eat, you can tell me whatever it is you want to say. Was Scorpius a problem last night? I assume you’d have called or Floo’d if there had been an emergency.”
“Got it. See you Thursday. Have a great match.” Harry tried to cup his hands over Lily’s ears and yelled, “Jamie! Al! Come on, we’re off!” His sons were standing close to the tracks and gazing longingly after the scarlet train.
“I just… I forget, sometimes. I get so caught up in our every day that I somehow manage to forget how stunning you are. And then I’m hit over the head by you. I’m so lucky.” Harry pressed a chaste kiss to Draco’s still flushed cheek. “I’m so lucky,” he repeated.
“Mazel tov!” he said, kissing the top of Lily’s head and ruffling Hugo’s curls. “Time for your chocolatey prize!”
“Well, yeah, I think so!” Harry answers. “To Teddy, I mean. I told him I loved him this morning when he suggested we have some wake-up cuddles.”
[Draco interview/confessional: Am I happy about this? Absolutely not. Would I do anything to make my son happy? Obviously. If it takes five gay men picking apart my wardrobe, well, I suppose that parenting takes sacrifices. And it’s completely worth it to watch Harry squirm.]
Harry immediately kissed Malfoy back, bringing his hands up to cradle Malfoy’s head in his hands. He opened his mouth and sighed into the embrace, feeling Draco’s soft arms wrap around his waist.
“Al and Scorp said they needed to check on a ‘speriment when we got home, and Jamie is probably writing to Teddy,” Lily replied.
“That’s great! Really great. I’ll send you some information to read. It’s a celebration of Passover, to commemorate the Jewish slaves leaving Egypt. I’m sure we have some kids books around somewhere that explains it all. It’s really important to Saul that we celebrate it, so it’s become a Potter tradition even though none of us are actually Jewish.” Harry smiled again at Draco. “I’ll owl you the details. See you next week!” He waved and jogged back up the cement steps to his front door.
Harry was grateful that the darkness of the night concealed his blush. “Fuck off, Malfoy,” he mumbled, covering his discomfort by taking another large gulp of wine. Even if he did have kinks, he’d never really had the chance to explore them with anyone. The whole, ‘being hunted down by a psychopath wizard bent on world domination’ thing had taken up most of his time and energy for the past seven years. This past summer he had taken advantage of being young and free and not dogged by any foreboding prophecies, and had gone clubbing in London a handful of times with Ron and Hermione. He’d enjoyed a few one-night stands with both men and women, but hadn’t met anyone that he wanted to see for more than a quick orgasm or two. It wasn’t exactly a conducive environment to explore one’s sexual proclivities.
“Turns out, we’d both separately talked to Andy about taking custody of Teds, and she asked if we’d consider raising him together,” Harry interrupts. “She wanted him to be brought up with as much family around as possible. And so, six weeks later a toddler and two clueless idiots moved in here and somehow it worked out.”
Potter was smiling at him. It was disconcerting to say the least. He suddenly straightened said, “Oh! I’m sorry. This is Saul Weinberg, the owner,” he gestured to the man wearing the half-moon spectacles who was still seated at the table, “and my dear friend. Saul, this is Draco Malfoy.”
Harry turns, bemused. “Err, no? I think it’s a habit...I call him Draco usually, but sometimes I forget and revert back to what we called each other when we were young.”
“I don’t know about you, Potter, but I certainly expected more out of this experience than taking notes on soil composition. Orion Malfoy’s journals are full of daring adventures. Did you know that the wizards in Pompeii actually caused Mount Vesuvius to erupt? They were attempting to enact an experimental ritual involving blood and fire that would allow them to increase their sexual prowess, and, according to the memoirs of Pliny the Middle Child, it had simply ‘got completely out of hand.’”
Harry’s wearing a dark blue suit with a white, lightly checked Oxford shirt and a tie with a subtle floral pattern. He tugs on the neck of the shirt. “I had to use a spell to tie the tie,” he admits.
“This is barbaric, Potter. I’m touching raw meat. I could get some sort of disease doing this.” Malfoy had his lip curled as he rolled a pinch of meat between his palms. “I mean, seriously. How can muggles do this three times a day, every single day? It boggles the mind, considering the things they have to do to stay alive without magic.”
“After all, someone will have to make sure that your dads’ wedding isn’t some sort of Pure Blood fever dream,” Bobby laughs.
“Oh please honey child, you don’t hate me! Just you wait until you see your man over here glistening in the morning light, his hair tousled instead of ... Whatever it is he has going on now.”
Harry rolls his eyes, but then looks at Draco fondly. “I’ll call Kingsley tomorrow and see what I can do.”
“Right. Of course. I apologise for the presumption.” Draco put a shaking hand on the back of a chair to steady himself, but he felt his knees buckle.
“I certainly know what profession I won’t be going into.” Malfoy looked thoughtful. “What are your plans for the future? Auror Academy, marriage to the Weaslette, three red-headed children named after dead people?”
He had long resigned himself to pining from afar. It was, he thought, quite Byronian; he’d always had a penchant for the dramatic and his lovelife ought to follow suit. News of the Golden Couple’s divorce and Potter’s subsequent disappearance from the Wizarding World hadn’t caused Draco’s feelings to abate; if anything, the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of The Chosen One only heightened his longing.
Harry had a fleeting thought that he might die like this, buried inside Draco and overcome with pleasure and love. “Although,” he reasoned in his head, “this is a much better way to go than last time.”
“She is an icon! How can you call yourself a gay man and not worship at the altar of our queen Celestina?”
Ginny waved and followed her children out of the room, winking at Harry before shouting, “see you soon, Malfoy!”
He found Draco sitting on his leather armchair that faced the lit fireplace. The bedroom had been expanded using wizarding space so that in addition to the large, four poster mahogany bed frame and matching armoire, there was a small fireplace with a sitting area that would otherwise have been impossible to fit in the two storey townhome.
The tall blond laughed. “I’ll have to get that in writing. Last night Scorpius woke me up at two in the morning because he said he couldn’t sleep for wondering how gravity worked.”
Malfoy looked at Harry in bewilderment before answering, “I am completely sincere when I say this, Potter. I do not give a single fuck what you make for dinner. I’ve never cooked in my life, and I’m certainly not starting in this hovel.” He sighed dramatically and threw himself into a small chair near the doorway.
Draco’s eyes shone with unshed tears and he nodded, slipping the band onto his left ring finger. “I love you, Harry Potter, you insufferable git. It’s been over two years now, so the oxytocin that filled your brain with lust has dissipated for the most part. I suppose if you’re still enamored of me, it must be true. Yes. Of course I’ll marry you.”
The sounds of kissing once again take over the audio, before Harry’s voice is heard and abruptly all sound is cut off and replaced with an odd, faint humming sound.
“If someone doesn’t tell me what the fu… what you meant by ‘you’re engaged’ I will start hexing at will!”
“So you were in a camp, err, during the Holocaust? In Germany? Or...” Harry asked, trying to remember what his muggle teachers had said. For all that he felt completely ignorant on the subject, having a conversation - connecting with people - made Harry feel fully awake for the first time in weeks.
“Potter, if you come out of that bathroom wearing the Rolling Stones shirt with the rip in it that you were cooking in, I swear to Merlin I will set it on fire.” Draco stands in front of a large mirror, considering his reflection. He’s in fitted tan trousers and a soft black turtleneck with the sleeves pushed up to his forearms.
Harry shrugs, then leans down to press a quick kiss to Draco’s lips, which draws out a deep blush across his cheeks. “But who knows how long it would’ve taken you to admit you’re madly in love with me?”
Draco’s long legs were crossed at the knee, and he had his right arm propped up under his chin. He was gazing into the fire, his eyes unfocussed, his expression grim and unchanging despite Harry’s entrance into the room.
“Hello, again! And you’ve brought your clone, I see. He’s the spitting image of you!” He smiled broadly at Scorpius, who gave him a small smile in return. “What’ll it be for you today?” He asked Draco.
“You know,” Draco spoke onto Harry’s chest where he lay his head, nuzzling into him slightly as the other boy carded his fingers through his white-blond locks, “yoga has many benefits.” Harry snorted.
“Dad, can we watch a show when we get to Zayde Saul’s house?” Jamie asked, craning his neck to look up at his dad. His red hair and lightly tanned skin seemed to glow as they walked through a patch of sunlight streaming into the train station. “And I want corned beef for lunch, but no mustard it’s too spicy and I hate it!”
I shuddered, remembering the smell of Harry when he’d come crashing in at four thirty in the morning. “You really, really do.”
“Draco, please...I’m not going to last,” Harry ground out, trying to stave off his impending orgasm.
He cleared his throat again and looked at the wooden floor, searching for a new topic of conversation. “So, have Jamie and Teddy always been close?” Draco asked.
“Your father is a crass beast!” Draco declares, throwing his arms up in exasperation. “This is going to be broadcast
“Do you not have to work at the deli today?” Draco asked, looking around curiously at the various muggle kitchen devices.
“Oh, hello Potter!” Pansy had whipped her head around when Harry stepped fully into the room. Hermione yelped as Ron tried to detach himself from the two women but got his hand stuck in Hermione’s hair. Pansy smiled calmly at Harry, leaving her hand where it was.
“No, Hugo. I’ll apologize to daddy, you’re right that it was very bad manners and against the rules.” Ron gave Hermione a champion smirk. “Why don’t you go look for the afikomen with the rest of the kids?” She asked.
Jonathan laughs. “It’s hard to remember that you don’t have much contact with the no-maj world! Is that by choice or by necessity?”
Dr Song claimed that the trench pairings were done randomly, but Hermione had pointed out that everyone was grouped with someone they’d had a “tetchy past” with. She was paired with Pansy Parkinson, Ron was paired with Tony Goldstein, Neville with Millicent Bulstrode, Lavender with Blaise Zabini, Padma with Terry Boot, and of course, Harry with Malfoy. Surprisingly, at least to Harry, all of the other teams seemed to compliment each other’s working style well. No other pair had screamed at each other or requested a different partner.
[Draco interview/confession: It’s not that I have anything against muggle clothing, in theory. I’m just far more comfortable in wizarding robes. I tend to stick to clean lines and expensive fabrics in muted colors. I suppose, however, that if Teddy feels as though I should don trousers every once in a while, I can make the sacrifice.]
“Yes, well done you,” I reply as he gently maneuvers me so I’m yet again leaning onto his desk on my forearms, arse in the air.
Ten minutes later Draco was close enough to the door that he was able to read a sign proclaiming, “Weinberg’s Deli, est. 1947” in neon red. The inside was full to the brim: people standing and eating huge sandwiches and sipping sodas at a wooden counter; others sat at tables scattered in the rather small space afforded to in-house dining. Draco found that he quite liked the old feel of the place - the black and white tiled floor and wooden countertops reminded him of muggle films he’d seen that were set in New York City and run by no-nonsense women.
“Are...are you both ok? Is our family OK?” Teddy asks, leaping up from the table and running over to his fathers.
“It uses fresh tamarind, which is a great weapon in any chef’s arsenal, and it’s especially popular in South Indian dishes. The tamarind is both a fruit and a legume, and it’s incredibly potent. A little goes a long way!” Antoni explains, picking up the pods and showing them to the assembled group.
“I simply inquired after some specific articles of Draco’s wardrobe that I wanted to ensure are safe and sound.”
“OK, so, I spent all night thinking about this. And I know that you think that you’ll only ever fall in love once, but that’s bollocks! You have no idea what you want when you’re fifteen bloody years old.” He looked into Draco’s eyes, suddenly looking determined and passionate. His green eyes sparkled in the low light of the lab. “So I’m throwing my hat in the ring. I like you. I like you… a lot. Perhaps more than I should, considering that I’ve only spent a few hours with you in the past decade. And I think that we could have something truly special, if you’d just consider a future with me.” He took a deep breath, seemingly to steady himself. “Would you consider going on a date with me?”
“Potter! You absolute brute! Put me down this instant!” Draco screeched, banging his fists against Harry’s back.
Ginny walked into the kitchen, eyebrows raised. “Malfoy! What’re you doing here?” Her tone wasn’t unkind, but it wasn’t quite warm, either.
Draco nodded against Harry’s chest, his hair tickling his neck under his chin. “Jesus bloody Christ, Potter. That was fucking amazing.”
“Well. Ok, then,” Granger shifted and leaned forward, extending her hand. “I’m Hermione Granger. Mudblood. Witch. Trainee Healer. War veteran. Daughter of parents whose minds I obliviated so thoroughly they have no idea who I am.”
“Either you do or you don’t,” Karamo interjects. “Be confident in your power and don’t waver in your statements! Make it clear that you know who you are and walk tall!”
Just then, Lily came running into the room, still wearing only her underpants. “Hi! I’m Superman and I’m here to save the day!” She crashed into Draco’s legs and stumbled backwards, laughing.
[The cameras follow as Harry leads the way up a grand, but old, staircase. At the first landing, he gestures down a well-lit hallway lined with several closed doors.]
[Antoni confessional/interview: I created a new cocktail in celebration of our inaugural episode in England! It’s called “The Drarry” and uses bitters, grapefruit, and vodka for that perfect combination of sour and sweet. Look for the recipe on our Instagram!]
Tan smiles and winks. “My work will never be used for evil! Although if I’d known it was to sabotage that vindictive harpy I’d have willingly helped. I’m a muggle-born, you know, so…” Tan shrugs. “On to happier things! We are so, so excited to work with you!”
“No! No, I’m just s - s - so ha-appy!” Teddy wails, clutching at Harry’s shirt and burying his head into his neck. “Of course, I want you to adopt me!”
The bespoke lingerie that I invested in looks amazing (and took an absolute age to get on correctly—how Muggles manage this many buckles and straps without magic is beyond my comprehension), and I try to hold my pose and school my features into my best “come hither” expression. I hold my breath as the doorknob turns and Harry enters.
“I’m Tan France, it’s such an honour to meet you two!” Tan moves to hug Hermione and Ron next. “I’m sure you don’t remember me, but I was in the same class as your brother Percy at Hogwarts. I’m a Ravenclaw, but we did suffer through double potions together for two years straight.”
“Draco!” Harry scolded from where he was cutting a cucumber into bite-sized discs. “Language! And don’t talk about Ms Goldblum wanting my ar - err, - my backside.”
“Of course! This bedroom is ready to be lived in - you don’t have to lift your wand to get anything in order.”
[Draco interview/confessional: I had no idea that my mother was involved in this. Draco sniffles slightly, clears his throat, and sits up straighter. I must admit that I’d rather she hadn’t provided quite so many photos of me during my clothing-optional years, but I’m certainly grateful that she wanted to add some familiar touches to Bobby’s design. I have wonderful memories of countless hours spent sprawled out on that rug, my nose buried in various books.]
Potter looked between Draco and Scorpius, and then stooped forward to take Scorpius’ hand in his much larger one. He smiled.
Draco and Harry look at each other for a moment, mouths open as if to respond although neither says anything.
“Hello, Harry,” Draco began, holding the wine out to him. “I thought we might turn up early and help you set up? I know the last time that mother hosted a dinner without the help of any House Elves she nearly had a nervous breakdown.” He smiled, and Harry melted.
“You fiend.” Draco grabbed a clean mug and filled it, adding just a splash of milk. He handed it over with a wink.
Draco felt sweat beading at his neck. The tingling sensation had now moved from his fingertips to the bridge of his nose; he knew, rationally, that an anxiety attack was building and that he wasn’t getting enough oxygen. The rational part of his brain and the reactive part of his brain were not working in tandem, however, and he found himself unable to take a deep breath.
Draco fought a smile and Harry tried to cover his bark of laughter by faking a cough. “Go ahead, Scorpius,” Draco replied seriously.
“I’d do anything for you, Harry.” I used to hate how easily he drew these sorts of blunt, honest confessions from me, but I’ve made my peace with it. Besides, he’ll usually follow up my romantic and/or sickeningly loving comments with something equally sappy.
Harry blushes a bit and removes his fingers from where they are toying with the ends of Draco’s hair. “I admit nothing, Malfoy.”
Al came thundering down the stairs. He stopped short of Scorpius and said a quiet hello to Draco. “Want to see my room?” he asked. Scorpius nodded, toeing off his shoes and throwing his coat at his father.
“You’re assuming that Harry shares my affections and wouldn’t abscond into the night to be away from me and my inconvenient feelings.”
“That’s right, Kreacher. Why don’t you take a seat and join us for some tea?” Harry says pleasantly.
“Oi! Hush, you!” Sophia said indignantly, before turning to Harry. She took one of his hands into both of hers - she had cool, wrinkled hands - and looked into his eyes. “Harry,” she began, “come back, have soup. Sit for a while. Don’t forget to be kind to yourself.” Harry nodded and thanked them again for their hospitality. Sophia pressed another container of soup and a ten pound note into his hand - “for the taxi!” - and she and Saul walked Harry towards the exit. To the right of the door, just above Harry’s eye level, a crinkled, yellowing piece of paper was framed. “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. - Viktor Frankl.”
Harry steps forward and puts his hand on Draco’s shoulder in an effort to reassure him. “Hermione told me a few weeks ago that Teddy had written a letter for us. He thinks that my clothes are in need of an overhaul, and apparently you’re too stuffy in your formal robes all the time. He thinks that maybe it can make us a bit
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” Harry yelped as he was pushed up against the door to his and Ron’s room. Despite having filled out a bit over the summer, Malfoy was still slightly taller than Harry, and he used his advantage to bracket the other boy’s head with his palms pressed up against the door.
Lily’s face turned almost as red as her hair and she yelled, “I’m a superhero! They don’t wear dresses!”
Not long after finishing the meatballs, Harry lifted a wooden spoon full of hot marinara sauce to Malfoy’s lips in invitation for him to try it. Malfoy lifted an eyebrow but opened his mouth and took some of the sauce. He closed his eyes and made a sound of pleasure, causing Harry’s cheeks to pink at the erotic noise that filled the small kitchen.
Now, face to face with the object of his affection, Draco was unable to move. The telltale tingling in his fingertips began, and he had to remind himself to take deep breaths.
“Did you tell your sister that she’s not allowed to play with you and Scorpius when he comes to play next week?” Harry asked.
When the last wave of his orgasm had rolled over him, Draco sighed and went slightly limp. Harry hefted him onto his back and he straddled him, furiously pulling himself off.
Harry clutches at my hips and runs his fingers along the garter belt and straps, holding my arse open for him. He throws his head back and swears when I’m flush against him. “Fuck. Don’t move for a second, OK?”
After her lecture, Draco waited until the room cleared and then walked over to where Granger was gathering her presentation materials. His palms were sweating and he felt light-headed, a tingling sensation in the tips of fingers. She looked up and raised one eyebrow while she tilted her head, regarding him with curiosity and mild distaste. He opened his mouth to speak but was only able to make a sort of breathy squeaking noise. Granger folded her arms across her chest. “I never thought I’d see the day that Draco Malfoy was at a loss for words.” She continued to stare at him, her gaze unwavering. Draco tried again.
Throughout the day people had popped in and out of their house to drop off this or that, and inevitably heard the news. Dudley arrived to a loud argument between Hermione and Pansy regarding colour schemes for the wedding; Molly and Arthur - with Hugo and Rose in tow -  floo’d in just in time to see Dudley sobbing uncontrollably at the news and were worried that someone had died; Ginny had come running in clutching a letter, demanding to know why Albus had asked her if marriage meant that his two dads would be keeping their jobs or if they would instead be having sex full-time; and Narcissa arrived in silence, cooly requesting that Draco explain why Pansy Parkinson had owled her earlier in the day to inquire about the Black family’s ancestral china pattern.
“Oh, Teds! We don’t have to do this now. I’m so sorry. We can talk about this later! Let’s open more presents, yeah?” Harry says quickly, putting his arms around Teddy in an effort to comfort him.
“I do,” Harry replied, crossing his arms over his broad chest. He was wearing a faded green shirt with the Harpies logo splayed across the front, the thin material hugging his biceps in a way that made Draco’s throat go a bit dry.
“Yes, well. OK.” Draco couldn’t help the words that spilled from his mouth. “Thank you?” It came out as a question.
The Chosen One has a massive cock. Merlin and Morgana both, Potter. You’re lucky I like you, or I would punish you for denying me access to this monster for maybe ‘the past two years.’” He used scare quotes to parrot Harry’s words back at him, and Harry giggled. “I swear Draco, I didn’t deliberately keep my dick from you. We were on opposite sides of a war, and then I didn’t think you were interested! There were extenuating circumstances! But now, you have full access to my dick. Full. Access.”
“You’re welcome, Scorpius, You’re welcome any time. And thanks for spending the day, Draco. It was really nice to have you here.” Harry smiled broadly held out his hand. Draco shook it, looking into his bright green eyes one last time before descending the cement steps that led to the street.
“But what do you wear under them? I haven’t lived in Britain in years but from what I remember Aurors would wear those great big wool things that were basically just overcoats.” Tan replies, opening another drawer. “Where do you keep the rest? Where are all your jumpers? Every British man worth his salt has to own at least one knit jumper.”
“I don’t want to do something special with you you’re just my dad and not a friend!” Lily pushed herself off the couch and ran from the room. Harry tried to tell himself that the words of a three year old didn’t sting.
Teddy regards his fathers calmly. “Well, Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron are always poking at each other and laughing and looking at each other weird. And Aunt Ginny and Aunt Luna do it too, but they also kiss when they think no one’s looking. Granny Molly said that they’re just ‘flirting’ when I asked what they were doing.” He spreads his hands as if it’s obvious. “And you two do that, but not with kissing or anything. You just say sort of mean things but you’re smiling a lot and laughing, and then sometimes you touch each other. So, it’s flirting, right?”
“Daaaaad.” Harry instantly recognised the beginning of a tantrum coming from his youngest. He opened his eyes and saw her running down the hallway, her pigtails coming undone and her chubby cheeks bright red.
“Oh, err… I usually just grab whatever’s at the top of my drawer. So, you know, jeans and a jumper mostly. A tee-shirt in the summer, if it’s warm enough.” Harry responds, looking warily at the scene playing out in front of him.
“Hello! Hi! Come in!” Harry gestured with his free hand to the foyer. Draco and Scorpius stepped inside. The front hall was littered with shoes and coats in various colours and sizes. Draco thought it looked exactly like a well-lived home should.
Malfoy looked up from where he was viciously scrubbing some particularly resistant mud from a large ceramic fragment. “I… well, I suppose I could look into it…” Malfoy trailed off, looking both pensive and yet somewhat annoyed. “Of course you’d have some sort of idea. Bloody Saviour.” The left side of his mouth quirked up in a small smile, and he pointed his toothbrush at Harry. “You never answered my question about you and Girl Weasley. I thought you’d have struck up again with her by now.”
“Oh wipe that look off your face, Harry! You look like I dumped your ice cream into the bin. I just want to ride your cock. Pull out for a second so I can get on top.”
At that moment the silver door swung open, and Draco felt like he’d been punched in the chest. Harry Potter strode towards the counter, wiping his hands on a blue apron and smiling. “Who ordered The Sophia, Dud?” He asked. “I owe them a hug!”
“Do it. Come for me,” Harry breathed into his ear, flexing his thighs and clenching his arse to thrust more deeply into Draco.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand and grimaced. “Erm, well, Ginny’s actually dating Luna Lovegood now - we decided we’re much better off as friends. Without the threat of imminent death hanging over our heads, we realised that we’re not all that well suited to be in a romantic relationship. Plus, did you notice she looks quite a bit like my mum? When Hermione pointed it out I couldn’t get it out of my head. I’m surprised you didn’t know about Gin and Luna, though, given your love of salacious gossip.”
I roll my eyes. “You’ve dressed up in your Gryffindor quidditch gear for me on several occasions. How is that different?”
Teddy huffs out an annoyed sigh but looks down at the papers again, beginning to read slowly and haltingly where Draco’s finger is pointing.  “...hereby declare that Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy have petitioned to become the parents of Edward Remus Lupin.”
Harry grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning spell, causing Malfoy to jump a bit, but he remained pressed against the door, waiting for Harry’s next move. Plying his cheeks apart, Harry licked into Malfoy’s arse. “Fucking hell, Potter!” Harry stopped and sat back onto his heels immediately, looking up to gauge if he had crossed a line. Malfoy pushed his arse farther towards Harry’s head, grunting unhappily. “Why’d you stop? Keep going, you tit!” Harry smiled and dove back in, swirling his tongue around the other boy’s furled entrance. He kept going, licking and sucking, adding a finger into Malfoy’s loosened hole.
“Mum!” Lily cried, launching herself into her mother’s arms. “Guess what? Scorpius taught me how to roll my whole body over my head! Wanna see?” She wiggled down to the ground, and crouched down. Very slowly she set her head down between her legs and threw her legs over. “TA-DA!” She yelled.
Before he and Ginny had split up, Harry had only let himself think about Malfoy in very vague terms. He knew that he was bisexual - and so did his family and friends; his and Ginny’s sex life had taken a turn for the best when he’d admitted that he’d love a nice cock in his arse - but he thought he was content with his love life. It was only very late at night, after he’d read some tragic love story or watched some idiotic romantic comedy that he’d let himself wonder what his life would be like if Snape had never heard the first half of that prophecy. The hatred he’d felt as a child for Draco Malfoy had morphed into obsession and something less easily defined around sixth year. Harry had been so sure of his own role in the war, and so sure of the black and white nature of good and evil. He never let himself question why he would have to school his thoughts away from images of white blond hair and long, pale fingers when he’d have a wank. Fifteen years later he had a pretty good idea why.
[Teddy sits between Harry and Draco on the sofa in the sitting room, eating popcorn and laughing at what they’re watching on the television.

Both men have their arms slung around Teddy, their longer limbs overlapping behind their son.]
Lily slapped her folder on the table across from Saul. “I know what an arse is, Dad! Jamie told me all the different words for our bums. Butt, arse, behind, bottom…” She trailed off as she opened her folder and began organizing her papers, her tongue poking out as she concentrated on her task.
Malfoy started to laugh again, and pushed at Harry’s arm playfully. “Ugh, you’re almost too easy to fuck with! Takes all the fun out of it.” He cocked his head and studied Harry. “You know, you have the most expressive face. You don’t even try to hide your emotions, do you? You’d never have lasted a day in Slytherin.”
“Are you sure you want to go to sleep already?” Harry asked. “Because I’m not all that tired, and I have this problem that I thought you could help me sort out.” He knew that his bravery had nothing to do with being a Gryffindor and everything to do with the wine he had been drinking for the past three hours, but seeing Malfoy in his pajamas, accidentally calling him ‘adorable’ and admitting to having had at least one impure thought about Harry made him unsure he could go another minute without kissing the berk.
“After I kissed you, you looked...well, you looked like you were in pain. You’d put your hand on my chest and drawn back, and I assumed you’d wanted me to stop. Honestly, Draco, you looked like you’d rather have been kissing a toad. And then I remembered what you’d told me last week, that you’d been in love with someone since you were fifteen. That you knew that you’d only ever fall in love once in your life, and you’d already done it. And then I’d gone and told you to just go for it before acting like a complete arse and kissing you.” Harry uncrossed his arms and looked at the floor. “In that moment, I thought that I’d crossed a line, that you’d made up your mind to pursue a relationship with this bloke and I’d kissed you without your permission.”
“Task completed. Am I done now?” Malfoy whinged at Harry, stepping back and crossing his arms over his chest.
Harry points his wand at Draco’s armoire. “Your turn, you posh git.” The door swings open and a drawer empties its contents onto the bed. “Let’s see what embarrassing pants you have!”
Hermione stood stiffly with her arms crossed over her chest, regarding the two men in front of her. “I suppose that I forgive you. But only if I’m allowed to give a speech at your wedding.”
Harry tracked the soapy rivulets of water that ran down Draco’s forearms, and the feeling of want overwhelmed him. Harry remembered the first time that he’d kissed Ginny, and the feeling that he associated most vividly with that kiss was triumph. Gryffindor had just won the Quidditch Cup, and he’d been welcomed into the common room like a conquering hero. He’d felt invincible in that moment - like he could do anything, be anyone - and so he’d grabbed his chance to be normal. He’d won the big game and he’d get the girl, just like in the all muggle movies he’d seen. It felt inevitable, really. Yes, he’d wanted Ginny, but he came to realise that what he wanted most was what Ginny represented: safety, family, and security. He spent the long nights on watch in the Forest of Dean while they were hunting for horcruxes imagining he and Ron would teaching their sons how to play quidditch in the field behind the Burrow while Ginny and Hermione fixed dinner, barefoot and pregnant. He’d been through enough therapy at this point to recognise that at the time, he’d needed to hold on to that narrative to cope with the trauma and uncertainty he had been dealing with (he winced internally at what either woman would say to him now should he disclose his daydreams to them).
“Well, me and Harry wear jammies. Draco always wears those robes that swish around so much. Uncle Ron says he just likes being dramatic and is trying to be like his godfather Severus but I dunno. I just want him to be cosy with us.”
“No one is pointing a wand to your head, Harry. I certainly don’t want to cohabitate with someone who is unwilling.”
“I love you Harry, but I promise you I’ve never had any thoughts about you or your ‘giant dick.’” Ron called over, laughing and using scare quotes.
“Yes, yes, love, just like that! Oh Merlin you feel amazing. And look at you, fucking yourself on me while you’re wearing that.
Draco shook her hand. “Yes, well, Harry invited me in for tea and I suppose we lost track of time…” Draco trailed off, feeling incredibly awkward.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “We’re meant to be teaching Teddy proper manners, you ridiculous oaf.” He sits down gingerly.
Draco once again gawped at Harry. “You want me to come to a family gathering? Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
Al looked crestfallen, but Scorpius turned to him and said, “Papa said that if I am polite and helpful then we can have a sleepover! So let’s be helpful and we can have a sleepover.”
“Molly Weasley was the first person who told me they loved me,” Harry responds. “Right after Sirius’ funeral. I was fifteen.”
“I promise that I will endeavour to remind you much more often how much I adore you,” Draco says, pressing a kiss to Teddy’s head.
“I want to say a few words. And then I’ll let Saul have the floor to light the menorah. But first,” Harry pulled Draco to his side and wrapped his arm possessively around his hips. “Despite the fact that we wanted to make a grand announcement, I know you’re all aware that Draco and I are getting married.”
Harry, Scorpius, and Al entered the kitchen in time to hear this last question. Draco looked imploringly at Harry, willing him to answer their daughter and spare him the inevitable barrage of follow-up questions.
[Scene cuts to Teddy’s newly redecorated room, which now sports a reading nook, a bunk bed, and a ceiling charmed to show a partly cloudy yet pleasantly sunny sky.]
“If you’re good helpers, then yes. We can have popcorn,” Harry replied as they made their way through to the Underground station. He hated taking all the kids on the Underground during rush hour, but it was the quickest way to get back to Shoreditch before the movers arrived. He had wanted to see Teddy off this morning before he left for his first year at Hogwarts, and Jamie had thrown an epic tantrum when Harry hinted that he might want to stay home instead of coming with. And where Jamie went, so went Al. And Lily. It had made sense at the time that he and Ginny made the plan, but now that the was shuttling his three children through the throngs of commuters, he wondered at his own stupidity. He had wanted a clean break, a way to say goodbye to living in the Wizarding World and to his marriage, and he felt like doing it at Platform 9 ¾ was a meaningful and fitting place to bid farewell. Ginny had rolled her eyes and called him a drama queen, but she’d had tears in her eyes and had pulled him into a crushing hug.
I suppose that every now and then love can be fulfilling, compassionate, and remarkable (and kinky). And it can still be completely
“Dr Song, I cannot be expected to report accurate results under these circumstances. Potter refuses to follow my simple directions, and has decided to continue taking down level 3 despite the fact that we have obviously struck upon a new soil layer.”
Harry nodded and allowed Draco to slick up his cock. “Face the other way,” Harry said, positioning Draco so that they were looking out towards the fireplace. He sat up behind him and waved his hand, opening the door to their armoire and revealing a large mirror.
“You are sworn to absolute secrecy, Granger. I’m serious.” Draco pointed a long finger at her. “I know you were the one who told Scorpius about the chocolate stash in the lab, and you told Harry about the those red knickers you found in my coat last year, thus ruining his Valentine’s Day surprise.”
as the idiot who let Death Eaters into the school. I’ll probably pickle my liver with firewhiskey before the age of fifty out of sheer boredom.”
“Can you imagine what you’d have said to me 15 years ago if I’d told you that one day you’d be raising your sons to be best friends?” Ron said, observing the scene with a raised eyebrow.
[Scene cuts to Jonathan standing back, appraising the cut he’s given Draco. Draco’s hair is significantly shorter, and has more volume and texture than before.]
Saturday dawned bright and so cold that the windows of the kitchen were frosted around the edges. Lily was sat at the window ledge, using her nail to trace designs in the ice. “DD?” She asked, not looking up from her work, “if you and Daddy are getting married, does that mean that you’re going to have sex? And have more babies?”
I emerged from the bathroom to find my husband holding the pair of lacy knickers Pansy had gifted to me in his hands, with a flush on his cheeks and neck, and an erection tenting his threadbare joggers.
[Dash-cam shows Tan driving on the right with Jonathan riding shotgun, and Karamo, Bobby, and Antoni squeezed into the back seat.]
Harry glanced at Draco, who was sat with his arms crossed tightly and his back rigid. “Ok then,” he thought, “still pissed.” He sighed and turned to face the rest of his family.
When Harry opened the door to his and Draco’s bedroom a few hours later, he had mentally prepared his apology for not including Draco in the Charlie Vance situation and was ready to grovel.
Suddenly Draco dropped his legs and growled at Harry to stop. Harry immediately froze, scared that he had hurt him.
“He doesn’t like pet names,” Harry says, smiling. “Believe me. I’ve tried many. I think Mal-Mal was my favourite, although the strength of the stinging hex he sent me after I used that one definitely wasn’t warranted.”
“I... I suppose I should be going, then.” Harry pushed his chair back, wincing at the squealing of the metal chair legs against the tiles. “I don’t actually have a clue where I am, though. I went on a walk without really planning on it...”
Malfoy bent his knees and hopped forward, rising to his full height slowly. He turned to face Harry with a scowl on his face; he was sweating lightly and a few strands of his straight hair had fallen out of place. “What the bloody hell, Potter?! I’ve told you before, this is a prescribed therapy from a licensed Healer!”
“Papa? Can we sit near Al? I promise to eat my whole lunch and not complain and mind my manners.” Scorpius tugged at his father’s jacket to get his attention.
Finally, Harry cast a mild cleaning charm over both of them and herded Draco over to his bed, leaving their discarded clothes in a mess on the floor.
“Harry,” Draco barely enunciated the word, letting it fall from his lips in an exhalation. Draco took Harry’s glasses off of him and tossed them onto an ottoman. “I need you to touch me, right now.”
Thus, this little project that I undertook following the discovery of Harry’s kink should come as no surprise to him. I suppose it might be a bit shocking to come in from conducting his Serious Auror Business (which undoubtedly involved plentiful angry-Harry eyebrows frowning at the rookies) on a random Tuesday night to find one’s husband mostly naked and draped across one’s desk. But one does what one must to keep a marriage’s fire alive.
“Thank you for having me, Mr. Harry. I had a really fun time!” Scorpius said while he tried to zip his coat himself.
“Speak for yourself henny! I know who Harry Potter is,” Jonathan flicks his hair behind his shoulder. “Those green eyes and that iconic scar? Come through round spectacles! My cousin had like a thousand posters of him in his room.”
“That’s so fucking hot,” I say honestly, watching him stroke his hard, wet cock with the black lace.
I nod and Harry’s smile turns into something almost feral. I can see the outline of his thickening cock through the material of his trousers and I smirk.
“I don’t know why I expected anything different.” Harry didn’t turn around to address his comments to Malfoy, choosing instead to pick up a tomato and examine it. “But I’m not making food for fifteen people on my own. The least you can do is cast a chopping charm if you’re not going to help in any other way.”
“Yes, Al. Draco and I will figure out a time that you two can have a sleepover.” Harry knelt to the floor. “Now give me hugs and kisses. All three of you!”
“We usually go to the park on the way home to say hello to the ducks, even though Draco says he doesn’t trust ducks because they’re basically just dinosaurs and they’ve seen too much. But I like the ducks and if we didn’t go see them they might worry about what happened to me so we stop and wave and give them some bread.”
“I think it’s time to explore your queendom now, your majesty!” Jonathan says quickly, pulling Draco out of the bathroom with him.
“That’s completely untrue!” Harry protested, climbing out the trench to face his teacher. “I’m cleaning the balk so that we can photograph it and draw the stratigraphy! Malfoy’s head is so far up his own arse that he can’t see what I’m doing.”
Harry looked appropriately disgruntled, but he was too overcome with happiness at the way the evening had turned out to be truly upset. Everyone had shown up with smiles on their faces, and no one had batted an eye at Draco and Scorpius’ presence. Draco had managed to coax Lily into a pair of spangly blue tights and a bright red dress - “Superman’s dress robes, Dad!” Lily had exclaimed when she came to show him her outfit - the boys had all behaved themselves, and no heirlooms had (yet) been broken. It was a Passover miracle.
(I may not remember much of the evening, but I was assured by her house elf that I conducted myself in a manner befitting a Malfoy. Which, looking back, is perhaps not what one wants to hear after an evening of debauchery.)
Harry, who had spent the better part of the school year moping about, feeling listless and thinking that he had nothing to look forward to after Hogwarts, felt somewhat ashamed that he’d never considered the fact that other people might be in the same boat. Ron had been talking about the Auror Academy nonstop since Head Auror Robards cornered him and Harry after their Order of Merlin ceremony last June, and Hermione had been accepted to three different Healer Training Programs. Their futures were clearly mapped out, while Harry had been feeling progressively more isolated with every passing day.
write me hate mail would say if they knew the sorts of things their Saviour says in the throes of passion.
“Wow,” Bobby says as he enters the bedroom. “It doesn’t look like anyone even lives in here. Draco, you keep a tight ship!”
Draco chuckled and leaned back against the sink, his arms braced behind him. “In all seriousness, Harry, this has been an absolutely wonderful evening.”
Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco, who still had his eyes closed. His cheeks were slightly pink and his brow was furrowed as if he were in pain. The realisation hit Harry like a freight train: Draco was in love with someone else. He had only just told him last week that his heart had belonged to the same person since he was fifteen, and here was Harry, getting in the middle of a relationship that he himself had encouraged Draco to pursue.
“Harry! Teddy! What in Salazar’s name is going on in there?!” Draco Malfoy strides into the room wearing long, dark blue fitted robes. His trademark blond hair falls straight down past his shoulders, and he stops short when he sees the assembled crowd. “What…?” he trails off, looking to Harry.
Draco placed both hands flat on the table. “Do not excuse my behaviour during the war, Potter. I did things that were unforgivable. Don’t act like I was some innocent child.”
“Well, we were thinking that it would be really informal and -“ Harry cut off abruptly when Draco elbowed him and hissed at him to acquiesce. “I mean of course! Hermione, come on, anything for you.” Harry amended.
“Right, he came back! Five minutes later he came into the kitchen and set a big bowl of matzo ball soup in front of me. He told me I was having a ‘matzo ball soup emergency’ and to eat and to listen to him. He told me that he had fallen in love with my Dad when he was fifteen. That he had been completely and totally certain that he was truly, madly in love with Harry Potter. But that he hadn’t dared to say anything to him for another fifteen years, and even then it was only because Dad had made the first move. DD told me in no uncertain terms not to give up hope. He explained that I needed to give Teddy space, to recognise that at the moment the age difference really was a ‘bit inappropriate,’ and to go have my own experiences. To go out and do all the things he hadn’t done as a teenager - go on dates, go to parties, make new friends, figure out what I was passionate about in life. And it’s the best advice that I’ve ever gotten.” Jamie smiled at Draco and felt a tear run down his cheek. “I don’t think that Teddy and I would have ever ended up here without you, DD. You reminded me that I had to actually be me, to figure out who that was, before I could focus on finding someone who would complement that. I remember feeling so incredulous, so skeptical! But then I started to watch you and Dad. You complement each other in a way that I’ve never seen in any other couple, and I realised that I wanted that. I wanted a relationship like yours. To have the person that made me whole. And you, Edward Remus Lupin, you make me whole.” Teddy stood up and put his arm around Jamie’s waist. “So thank you, DD. For showing me what I could aspire to have. And for recognising a matzo ball soup emergency when you saw one. I love you.” Jamie raised his champagne. “To my parents, who show me every day what it means to love and be loved. Cheers!”
“Well I’d hope so, Mr. Potter-Lupin, you giant arse,” Jamie rolled his eyes and continued. “Well, DD found me crying in the kitchen. He asked what happened, and I was completely honest with him. He patted my hand, gave me a tissue, and left.”
“Oh, hello Granger. I didn’t see you there.” She gave Hermione a quick once over. “I love your slippers, by the way. They exude that ‘devil may care’ disheveled look that’s Potter’s forte.” Pansy reached over to accept the cup of coffee Harry offered her.
The chair creaks ominously, so I change tactics. While Harry is still gaping at me, I walk slowly (and carefully) to the front of the desk and lean back, letting Harry take all of me in.
“You’re drunk, Granger. But yes, I’m aware of my physical attributes.” Pansy brushed her perfectly trimmed black fringe from her forehead and gave Hermione a knowing smile. Harry looked over to gauge Ron’s reaction to this interaction between his girlfriend and the Slytherin, and saw Ron looking at the two of them with a dopey smile on his face.
Bobby and Jonathan run inside, emerging moments later both wearing old, faded knit sweaters in different colors emblazoned with large “H”s across the chest.
“Nah, they’re denim! They’re made to be worn in casual situations.” Harry says around a mouthful of food.
“Oh, you’d like that, wouldn’t you Potter? You know I can’t be in the direct sunlight for that long! My skin can’t handle it, as you are well aware.”
“Well do it somewhere else! I don’t need to be seeing your arse every time I look up from the table while I’m…studying! Yes, STUDYING!” Harry moved his hands to his hips, and glared at the other boy.
Tuesday afternoons were reserved for what had been termed ‘The Wottfoy Parliamentary Sessions.’ The various responsibilities of sports practices, play dates, musical instrument lessons, work at the deli/potions lab, and step-families meant that during the week the seven of them were rarely able to spend time together. Even before they had combined their households, Draco and Harry had instituted a mandatory weekly teatime to begin to integrate their families and to catch up with each others’ goings on. Scorpius had come up the portmanteau of their names (Weinberg, Potter, and Malfoy), and after a memorable Tuesday where the adults were forced to call order several times due to a shouting match that kept erupting between Jamie and Al, formal Parliamentary procedure had been enacted.
Harry put his head in his hands, completely mortified. Sharing a tent with Hermione last year had resulted in a few awkward naked moments - inevitable, really, given the size of the tent and the amount of time they’d spent in it.
. Harry has never touched himself like this in front of me. I mean to say that yes, he’ll stroke himself off while I’m fucking him, but he’s never just whipped it out and starting wanking. I go from half-hard to fully erect so quickly that I’m surprised I don’t faint from the blood rushing south.
“I mean, Harold, you’ve certainly grown up since your high school days… that’s a normal thing to say, right?” Jonathan amends, looking at Bobby for confirmation.
“What do you think of Harry’s new ‘do, Draco?” Antoni asks, looking at him from out of the corner of his eyes.
“Oh, they’re playing Aurors in Jamie’s room. They said I could play but I didn’t wanna be sat with my hands tied while they rescued me. It was boring.”
“It’s not my fault you have the fine motor skills of a giant, Potter. I’m not going to sit back whilst you ruin the stratigraphy with your ineptitude!”
“Well, anyone with eyes that work can see that you two are in love, like the sort of love that Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione have. I bet even Troggy knows and he can’t see anything! But you wouldn’t tell each other that, and Aunt Hermione said that the situation was becoming dire. So we decided to write a letter to the only people who I knew would be able to help.” Teddy gestures at Antoni and Karamo. “And also you both dress really bad so it was easy to get you to believe that was the only reason they were here.”
“Scorpius, come back here and lets order our lunch, please.” Scorpius walked back over to his father, frowning.
Harry chuckled and pinched one cheek before diving back in, lapping at Draco and reaching forward to cup his balls.
They went back to preparing the meal in a comfortable silence, occasionally bumping shoulders and hands as they worked.
“Jamie, you’re going to see Teddy in less than a week for Easter hols. Do you really need to send him another letter?” Harry responded, raising his eyebrows.
Saul nodded and came around the side of the counter with the plate clasped in his hands. “Nice to meet you, Harry. You’re the famous wizard, then?” He reached the table and set the plate down, sitting in the empty seat to the left of Harry. “And I’m assuming you’re a gentile,” he continued before Harry could respond. “These are rugelach - they’re biscuits.” He pushed the plate towards Harry. “Very, very delicious biscuits.”
As is her wont, Pansy sent us all home with ridiculously expensive gift bags full of sex toys, Belgian chocolates, and lingerie (or, what Pansy calls “the ingredients for a casual night in”). The next morning, I left said gift bag in my and Harry’s bedroom before absconding into the en suite to scrub off my sins in a bathtub full of lavender and mint.
“What?” Teddy says, looking up from where he’s feeding the dog bits of meat off of his sandwich. “I don’t think I’m in charge of anything at home except keeping my room clean and minding Trogs and helping with chores.”
! Salazar, Potter.” Malfoy groaned and got to his feet, shuffling over to the sink where Harry stood filling a large pot with water. Harry suppressed a grin at his victory.
“See?” Pansy said, preening. “I’ve a gift Blaise. And you’ll be reaping the benefits, I’m sure. Last year I found tiny pieces of gold foil from the gelt around the house until at least March.”
“It’s always been him, for me. We have an acrimonious history, to say the least, but we’ve gotten past all that and we have a family together. I won’t give that up for my own selfishness.”
“You’re ENGAGED?!” The floo roared to life and Pansy stepped out, wiping ash from her black pencil skirt and levitating a case of wine in front of her.
“I’ve never done that before, but I’d love to learn,” Draco says, rising to his knees and reaching for the dog’s lead. “Come along, Sir Bites a Lot. Let’s go fly a kite! And I do believe there are some sticks you might be interested in gnawing on.”
“Hi! Hello! I’m Hermione Granger! It’s so nice to see all of you! I’m such a big fan!” Hermione gestures to the man next to her. “This is my partner, Ron Weasley. We’re Harry’s best friends.”
“I said that I wasn’t upset that you kissed me. I’m not currently upset that you kissed me. I was and am angry that you kissed me and then immediately apologised for it, looking for all the world like you deeply regretted your actions.”
“No, I don’t think many people want to spend much time thinking about the Weasel and Granger’s sexual activities. The time I walked into our rooms and saw them together was more information than I ever wanted.”
“Draco! Wait! I... I won’t try to kiss you again!” Harry came to a halt and watched as Draco knotted his scarf tightly around his neck.
“Err, I see me? But, I look like a me who’s maybe going to a wedding. Or some other fancy affair, probably one that Draco’s dragged me to.”
Harry climbed out of the trench and stalked over to Draco, who was grinning smugly. He didn’t stop once he reached him; instead he bent and put his arms around Draco’s hips, heaving him up and over his shoulder in a fireman’s carry.
Draco looks down for a few moments, then up again to meet Jonathan’s gaze. “I apologize for my reaction. I don’t … respond well to being challenged.” He looks at the camera again, nervous. “I suppose that I’m hesitant to further embarrass myself. Karamo has already coerced more emotional statements from me in the past 24 hours than I’ve admitted to in the past 24 years.”
“Call us when you’re ready,” Karamo interrupts, smiling widely. “At ‘some point in the future.’ Until then, we’re going to enjoy some much deserved rest at the Fab Five’s London Loft, where we can watch you three prepare to host your family for Teddy’s birthday celebration.”
Dudley nodded his head. “You’ve been in coming in for months. It’s nice to put a name to the face. I usually just call you, ‘blond bloke who smells like flowers.’”
“Organic, good-for-you and good-for-the-earth type brands are super pops right now! I bet you could market them to Gen Z-ers and make an absolute killing. Send them gratis to some ‘gram influencers and you’ll be featured on a Buzzfeed listicle in no time.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s hips and tried to still him - or at least slow him down - but Draco just grinned at him in the mirror and kept his pace.
“You’re just saying that because I let you fuck my mouth,” Draco said, smiling and looking around for his wand.
“Hello, you gorgeous angel!” Jonathan leaps at Hermione and wraps her up in a hug. “You are radiant! A goddess!” Jonathan twirls her around. “And hello to you too, handsome!” Jonathan moves to hug Ron, who looks a bit shocked but pats his back awkwardly.
“To be honest, Harry, I have no idea what a seder is. But yes, we’d love to come.” Draco let himself answer without considering too much. He desperately wanted to see Harry again, and if he had to brave an army of Weasleys to do it, so be it.
Draco pulls Teddy to him in a hug. “Yes, Teddy. We are fine. Our family is intact, as it will always be.”
“Just making sure the Notice-Me-Not charm is still up back there. It would cause a lot of questions if the neighbours noticed that we had a pet owl.”
Draco didn’t have a response, so he looked down at his teacup. He wasn’t sure how to talk about the war with Harry; wasn’t sure that he had the right to be lighthearted in the same way that he was with Hermione.
Harry snorted, nodding his agreement. “I know, right? I imagined that we’d be untangling ancient spells placed on the graves of wizards and witches like Merlin and Morgana, and finding all sorts of cursed Druidic artifacts. Not washing bloody pottery all day.”
“Yes, Draco, let’s see what else you wear on a daily basis! Show me your famous collection of robes,” Tan says, moving towards the armoire.
Harry smiled and let out a relieved sigh before he dropped to his knees in front of the other chair. He rested his hands on Draco’s thighs. “I’m so sorry about not including you. I’ll tell you the minute we get any more owls from the kid's school.”
At least, that’s what Hermione had said. For the past ten years, Harry had heard stories about ‘Draco’ and how wonderfully he’d matured; how smart and funny he was; how handsome he looked in his laboratory robes (that last one was purely conjecture, but Harry was confident he’d cut quite a figure in those ivory research robes). Harry had read every single paper that he’d published, never mind that he’d only understood about half of what he was talking about. He’d fallen in love with his witty prose style and thirsted for the anecdotes that Hermione would share about this conference or that presentation.
, Harry thought. Draco reached down and brought Harry’s hands to his head; Harry quickly wound his fingers through the silky locks.
“And I did figure it out!” Harry said, chuckling. “Well … sort of. I knew you were up to something, at least.”
“Thanks so much, Draco,” Harry said, taking a wet plate from him and toweling it dry. “Cleaning up is much more enjoyable with you here.”
“Albus! Get down here!” Harry pushed the loose strands of Lily’s hair out of her eyes and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. “Of course you can play with your brother and Scorpius when he comes over. There’s no excluding anyone in this house, isn’t that right?”
“It’s moments like these that I really regret opening up our floo” Harry sighed, patting Draco on the bum and reaching to fetch another mug from the cabinet.
Potter had the audacity to laugh with the children. He opened his arms again. “What do you say, Malfoy? Give it another try?”
This whole thing began, as most ill-conceived and/or ridiculous events in my life do, with Pansy Parkinson. A few weeks ago, I attended her “divorce ‘do”—picture a hen party with just as much alcohol but with the added ritual burning of a wedding dress and some minor curses directed towards her now ex husband and his 20-year-old slag of a secretary—and had (apparently) a wonderful time.
“Dad, do you think Teddy will write letters to me especially? Not to you and mum, but just to me?” Jamie asked, running up to Harry’s side and tugging on his sleeve to get his attention.
“Well, that was the most painfully awkward thing I’ve witnessed in ages! Thanks for the entertainment, Harry.” Draco looked around and saw the man at the register smiling broadly. “I’m Dudley, Harry’s cousin.” He held a meaty hand out to Draco, who took a few steps forward to meet him.
“What do you want, Draco?” The name fell from his lips before he could think about it. Harry gasped as he felt goosebumps erupt on his neck and arms from Malfoy’s ministrations.
Harry is close enough to me that he could reach out and touch me, but he doesn’t. Instead, he undoes his belt and shoves his pants and trousers down just enough to get his cock out, and starts to stroke himself using the knickers.
“Bobby, did you move all of our clothes and everything in here already?” Harry asks, looking towards the armoires.
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Harry. Oh yes, they make wonderful chocolate everything in Paris but I’m not allowed to eat it much because it’s not good for my teeth or for my tummy. Papa eats it all the time and he thinks I don’t see him sneaking it but I do.” Scorpius grinned up at Potter. “Are you his papa? The boy’s over there?” He gestured behind himself vaguely in the direction of the occupied table. “Only, he looks just like you but small. He said his name is Al and that he’s five just like me.”
Much to his relief, the game seemed to dissolve as people began having conversations amongst themselves. Harry sneaked a glance to his left where Draco was sitting, and saw that he was gazing into the fire, his blonde hair hanging over his cheek and shining in the light.
Pansy had found Draco a new space for his potions laboratory, using her influence as one of the top grossing magi-realtors in London to net him “a truly magnificent loft in the trendiest part of London, darling. No one else has even heard the space is available for let, otherwise you’d not have a chance at it.” It was, much to Draco’s chagrin, absolutely perfect (and Pansy would never let him hear the end of it.) Hardwood floors with large windows well suited to ventilation, a direct Floo connection with his home office, and climate controlled storage. He’d had top of the line fixtures installed, and made sure to include a nook for his favourite muggle device: an espresso machine.
“Sure! Let’s go, little man,” Karamo says, leading Teddy to the table. “I prefer to chop veggies the no-maj way. I think they always have a funny taste if you use spells.”
“Put this on the hob, and then add a few pinches of salt.” He handed the now heavy pot to Malfoy, allowing his fingers to linger against the other boy’s a few seconds longer than strictly necessary to transfer the cookware.
“Remus and Tonks were your dad and mum, and will be forever,” Draco continues. “But Harry and I want you to know that we never, ever, for a single moment, would consider a life without you here. You are our son, even if you don’t want us to file these papers.”
Draco rolled his eyes and waved his hand dismissively. “As if I’d be the one to hurt him. He’s too good for me, and I’ll hold on as tightly as I can to that delightful arse of his for as long as he’ll have me.”
“Are you serious? No! Take these tomatoes and chop them. Use ‘secatus,’ it’s the most basic cutting charm. We’re making a marinara sauce, so they don’t need to be perfect.”
He would be lying, of course. The most irritating aspect of moving one’s life from Paris to London in the dead of winter was the fact that he was doing it at all. But Astoria had fallen in love and wanted to relocate to London. In order to maintain a stable environment for their five year old son Scorpius to grow up in, Draco and Astoria agreed to share custody and both live in London. They purchased adjoining townhomes in Knightsbridge and found a suitable wizarding primary school for Scorpius to attend. He felt that it was the least he could do for his now ex-wife, as she had agreed to marry him in the first place nearly ten years ago, perfectly aware of the fact that Draco was marrying her for her uterus and was otherwise utterly uninterested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her. Not that Astoria was upset about this, as both she and Draco were bent as corkscrews. But for a decade familial obligations had won out. Then Astoria had been reintroduced to Millicent Bulstrode at her yoga retreat in Tahiti and the rest was, as they say, history.
“Papa,” Scorpius began, looking gravely at Draco. “Albus and I prepared a list of reasons why we should be allowed to have a sleepover, but we can’t really write yet so we just have to tell the reasons to you.”
. How do you fit your…” He looks up suddenly. “I mean! It’s your life! You can put your - err, wear whatever you want!”
, but perhaps we can work on adding words that are suitable for a general audience, hmm?” Draco said as he opened a cabinet to gather mugs for tea. He had to shuffle through at least a dozen other cups to find the one that he knew Scorpius would ask for: Harry had bought it for him at the London Zoo for his last birthday, and it had a large giraffe sticking out its tongue on the front.
“To my recollection, your animosity at Hogwarts was legendary. I only overlapped a few years, but I remember a few rather intense quidditch matches and the rumour of an illegal duel?” Tan remarks. “What changed? Was it Teddy?”
“Ok, ok. I see Harry Potter, but a Harry Potter who looks quite, err, professional.” He pulls at his cuff.  “Perhaps a Harry Potter who could be up for Lead Instructor.”
[The bedroom now has white walls, and the floor is back to the original hardwood. Just as in the sitting room, the moulding at the ceilings has been restored, and the space is dominated by a huge wooden-framed bed piled with fluffy blankets and pillows in shades of ivory and white. There is a green velvet chaise lounge near the window with a deep maroon coloured throw on one end. On either side of the bed is a small nightstand, one piled with the books from Harry’s room and the other with Draco’s reading glasses sitting on top. There are two matching armoires along one wall, and the framed pieces of Teddy’s art that once decorated Harry’s bedroom are now hanging above them.]
“Hey! You twat! That’s not what happened!” Harry said laughing despite himself. “It’s true that we had a small row but we cleared it up and I realised that I couldn’t bear him thinking that I would some day up and leave. So I proposed. And he called me insane but he accepted.”
Harry had laughed, shifting around on the bed a bit. I imagined that his erection was causing him some discomfort, so I made my way towards him and picked up the discarded panties from where Harry’d dropped them.
“I think you should put us all out of our misery and just fuck Malfoy already. K?” She slurred her speech a bit, but was smiling serenely at Harry. “Maybe your big dick would finally make him shut up and give us all some peace.” She laughed at her own joke and Harry heard Ron groan.
