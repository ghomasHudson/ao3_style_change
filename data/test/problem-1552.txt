(In a dingy alleyway, his heart full of young, reckless love, Draco once made a promise to Harry. The words burn in his throat, a brand pressed into his soul with a red-hot poker.
As it turns out, it is easy to learn to be good and kind and compassionate when you are shown those traits on a daily basis - especially when they are directed at you.
‘I think you could probably be a little kinder to yourself,’ Neville says. ‘You saved the world, Harry. Not just twice, by the way, because there’s first year, and then second year, and then fourth year, and then fifth year you taught us all how to protect ourselves against Death Eaters. Can you imagine any of our fifth-year students doing that? Training an army?’
Brief mentions of gore ahead. There's also a paragraph about being crushed under small spaces, so if you have claustrophobia this is going to be an unpleasant one.
Blaise only bares his teeth in a deadly smile. ‘There’s nowhere to run, Lucius,’ he drawls, lifting his wand. ‘No one can Apparate in or out of here - we’ve set up wards. You’re welcome to splinch yourself trying, of course,’ he adds.
Blaise is a little cautious at first, responding politely to any questions aimed at him, but Pansy takes to it like a duck to water. She plonks herself down between Ron and George, and quickly discovers that George shares her terrible taste in liquor and is
And then there’s Sundays at Andromeda’s. The first time it’s an accident - Harry’s just leaving as Malfoy walks in the door - but after that it becomes a regular thing.
Harry frowns down at George’s notes. His handwriting is nearly as bad as Ron’s - honestly, how do they even
‘Never did like heights,’ Neville says, in that steady, pleasant way he says everything. ‘I was always dead impressed by you in first year, shooting up into the sky like that, even though it was your first time on a broomstick. Makes sense you’d be fine with this place.’
He manages to say a polite goodbye to Narcissa and thank her for hosting them, keeping his face a mask of calm until she finally shuts the door - and then Harry flees down the staircase and bursts out of the apartment building and into the heavy heat of the outdoors. He makes it three paces before he’s violently sick in the bushes.
Harry helps prop Draco up on the pillows, bracing his neck. Draco smiles at him, brushing his fingertips on the inside of Harry’s wrist just as Harry begins to pull away. An ember warmth spreads through Harry from the space where Draco touches him, and his heart hammers away in his chest as he sits back down. There was something, something new in the way Draco moves around him now, like the world had already shifted in their sleep.
It’s Christmas at the Burrow, and Bill pulls Harry aside, places a letter in his hand, and asks if he’s put Malfoy up to this. It’s another lovely letter, one that makes Harry take a long walk outside to clear his head. There’s a recipe for wolfsbane potion there too, one that leaves far fewer side effects and tastes a lot less like shit, according to Bill’s attempts at brewing it. When Harry comes back inside to help with Dinner, Molly pulls him aside and asks him if Malfoy’s doing alright, because she saw him in Diagon Alley while she was Christmas shopping and he was looking dreadfully skinny, and he gave her a letter which made her very sad and very worried about him when she read it.
He fights against the weight of drowsiness. ‘You have to know-’ he manages to say. ‘I have to tell you-’ he breaks off coughing.
Ron leans over his wife, picks up her tea with all its floating biscuit carcasses, and lifts it as though in a toast. ‘Yup,’ he says, grinning humourlessly. ‘Fuck Dumbledore.’
An epilogue consisting of: a conversation between two Hogwarts professors, a compromise, a wedding, and a honeymoon.
Harry flips through his book as the cities and towns and fields fly past. Draco gave it to Harry on his twenty-fifth birthday as something of a joke -
He sits and watches Potter devour his cursed creation, listens as Potter reels off his latest strategy for weaving Grimmauld Place’s network of protective spells back together. He is viciously smart, and he has a talent for spells and charms that puts even Granger to shame. Draco suspects that many people underestimate Potter’s intelligence simply because he has the attention span of a rabid squirrel and a level of obliviousness that is physically painful to witness.
Ginny’s face is buried in Harry’s shoulder and she’s making awful, snorting giggles. It’s not at all subtle.
‘You don’t think I feel the same?’ Draco asks. He laughs, the sound strangling in his throat like a sob. ‘Harry. I have been in love with you from the moment you stole my wand in the Manor.’
Draco closes his eyes and tries to find a way to breathe. His exhausted mind stutters through memories like a television with bad signal flickering between channels.
He says nothing out loud, and Harry goes back out, returning with the wireless already switched on and tuned to BBC One. He props it up against Draco’s pillows, leaning close as he does, close enough for Draco to smell the faint amber hints of his cologne. Draco bought this cologne from Debenhams - saved up three months’ wages for it, too, like the lovesick fool that he is, and it was certainly worth it to see Harry’s face light up when he unwrapped the expensive packaging.
Blaise makes a gesture with his hand that falls in tandem with the tilt of his head, as though to say,
‘Work faster,’ she orders. She slips her feet off his lap and heads over to the stove, pouring a frightening amount of coffee liquor into the pot. ‘This shit is too weird to mull over sober.’
to me. Do you understand that? You make me believe that this horrible, miserable world can get better.’
Later on, after Teddy and Andromeda have called it a night, Harry and Draco have mulled wine out in the garden and watch the snow drift down, feather-like. Draco steps close and leans his head on Harry’s shoulder.
When it finally passes, there is magic crackling beneath Harry’s veins so potent he could tear the whole fortress down around him with a flick of his fingers. He could wipe this Dementor-stained island clean off the face of the earth, turn its stones into sand and its walls into salt.
Draco kisses his forehead, his palms, the soft inside of Harry’s wrist, over the silver-and-white scars running over his skin, and the black circles of Harry’s Anchors. ‘My delightful idiot,’ Draco smiles. ‘My sweet, lion-hearted buffoon. We have time to figure out a forever. All the time in the world.’
Potter has nearly no table manners. He leans his elbows on the table, tears apart chapati with his fingertips and licks curry off the back of his hand. It is infuriating how much Draco wants him.
Harry wanders around, waving his wand and placing charms to prevent the tent from burning to the ground or the champagne tower from collapsing and taking an eye out. Once he’s sure nothing’s about to explode or burst into flames, he quietly slips away from the party and heads out to the back of the yard. He finds a nice spot to sit in the grass, away from the tent, and looks up at the stars.
shade of fuchsia, and Hermione gets absolutely plastered from the punch, and at the end of the night Ron has to carry her into the Floo.
Draco sits up in one quick motion, shifting so that he’s sitting cross-legged, facing Harry. ‘I’m saying you can drink your champagne, or you can kiss me, or you can do none of it at all and walk away from me forever, if you like, and I’ll still… I’ll still…’ he trails off, looking down at his bare feet. ‘I can’t force you to come to Belgium, not when you’re so happy here. But I can’t be a good person, not tonight.’
‘So like, I don’t count as a kid?’ Teddy interrupts, gesturing at himself. ‘Victoire just emerged from the womb as a full-grown teenager? And I suppose Rose is just a really, really small adult. Or maybe she’s a grindylow in a very good disguise. Oh, and what about Hugo?’
After the vows are said and the binding is done, they go down to the small orchard Harry planted for Draco, where a long row of tables and benches have been shoved together between the line of cherry trees and lemon trees. The wedding cake towers at the centre of the impressive spread of food and sparkling wine -
when they danced. And then, suddenly, he thinks of the look of steely resolution on Harry’s face as he strode across the ballroom to his would-be-captors - not a man ambushed at all, but a man facing down a long-awaited duel.
‘Hm,’ says Daphne. She puts her wand away. ‘But you’re still not sleeping enough. And you haven’t been eating properly.’
‘Of course it’s my fault.’ Harry tips the rest of the glass down his throat and sets it down in front of the fireplace. He’s probably had enough. The world is blurry enough so that he can’t feel Ginny’s magic anymore. ‘I’m fucked up, Draco. Nobody in their right mind would want to put up with all of this,’ he says, gesturing vaguely over himself and the area around him. ‘Who’s going to want to love this?’
Harry wanders back into the living room, casting his gaze around the apartment once more. Everything is orderly, but not in the way that a home looks when the owner is on vacation. It’s like Draco just vanished into thin air.
‘I’m perfectly fine,’ Draco tells Teddy, his fingers still encircling Harry’s wrist. ‘A little weak, maybe. Nothing to worry about - nothing that can’t be healed.’
Draco laughs, tipping his head back. ‘Circe, Harry,’ he says breathlessly, when he’s done. ‘You have
‘Do you think you can recall anything else he might have mentioned during the time of your kidnapping?’ Blaise is asking Draco. ‘Any other magic items his affiliates have in their possession or are trying to create?’
Smythe laughs incredulously. ‘Who do you think you are,’ he scoffs, ‘talking to an Auror like that?’
,’ he says, indicating the scroll in Hermione’s hand. ‘See, your precious Mr. Potter has been practicing magic that isn’t within the confines of registered spells. And to make matters worse, he’s been injuring people. Destroying property -
‘Oh,’ says Harry. ‘Well. He’s in Belgium now. And it’s good for him. And I need to learn how to be okay before I… before I tell him.’
‘You don’t do sleepovers,’ Harry says brightly, earning himself a poisonous look. ‘You gave me a very tight timeline, Blaise, so sit your pretty arse down and cooperate.’
‘I cannot personally disclose the details of the Malfoy account to anyone other than Draco Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy,’ Acquafredda says in clipped, perfect English. ‘You must understand, Professor, that Master Draco has been particularly careful with his personal affairs since the release of Lucius Malfoy. However,’ says the lawyer, holding up a finger, ‘he
Harry hums and bounces his fist on the counter. ‘I tell you what,’ he says, pointing at Malfoy, ‘I’m done with my shift at six. Will you be free by then?’
Luna sips at her coconut-milk mocha and frowns slightly. ‘You’re special to him, Harry,’ she says. ‘It can be a little hard to write to someone important. Your feelings get all tangled up like string, and you have to spend time by yourself picking apart the knots and winding it all up neatly again.’
Draco takes a step back towards the open floor of the ballroom, Harry’s hand still within his grasp. ‘Dance with me,’ he says.
Blaise casts a series of wordless diagnostic spells. Lights and runes flash over Harry at a dizzying rate, too fast for him to make much sense of them. As the diagnostic spells run their course, Blaise’s expression transitions from disgust to horror. His lips thin into a pale line and his eyes grow hard and flinty. He ends the final spell with a vicious swipe of his wand.
Draco’s hand closes over his, and his weight presses into Harry’s side. ‘It’s over,’ he whispers. ‘It’s finally over.’
‘I knew you’d come,’ Draco whispers. He reaches up a hand. The fingers that brush against Harry’s tearstained cheek are turning blue - a sign that shock is setting in. ‘My darling idiot.’
‘Hm.’ Daphne pulls away, bracing her hands against the backs of Draco’s arms. She dips her chin slightly so she can properly study his face. ‘I’ll tell you what Luna said to me this morning. She said,
Harry lets out a surprised guffaw. ‘You could never be a twat, Neville,’ he grins. ‘You’re too fucking noble.’
In the night, they open the windows as the air cools. The wind is scented with lavender and the sky is bedazzled with meteor showers. The curtains billow in dramatic arcs, ghosting over the edge of their bed.
A group of fourth-year girls walking ahead of them turn around. One of them turns bright pink as the other two burst into fits of giggles.
Narcissa laughs at this - a light, pleasant noise. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever heard her laugh like that. He wasn’t even sure she was capable of it. Blaise guides her down the corridor towards the living room, gently nudging her forwards with the sheer width of his shoulders and his ridiculous height.
They sit together for a while in a companionable silence that is as much a conversation as any. The stars are hidden behind a faint dusting of clouds, but the moon is a fat dollop of cream against the sky and the air smells like roses and lemon rinds. A lively song picks up on the wireless, overlain with laughter and conversation.
Ginny snorts. She swings her broomstick up and over, resting the metal hilt of it against her shoulder. ‘Right,’ she says, shaking her head in mock despair. ‘If you lads are quite done with your little lover’s spat, would you like to head in and get the food started while I go have my shower?’
Harry feels like he’s in the middle of a very frightening, very confusing training programme and his fight-or-flight response is about to kick in. ‘Um. Apology accepted?’
Hermione lurches forward, her face a mask of steely fury and her fist clenched in a tight ball, but before she can take a swing, Ron grabs her by the arm quickly and hauls her back out of range.
Draco pointedly places the piece of chocolate in his mouth and elbows Harry gently in the ribs. ‘We’ve talked about the saviour complex, dear,’ he says. He is silent for a moment, his gaze dropping to the polished floor beneath his shoes, and then he looks up into Harry’s eyes. ‘Thank you,’ he says.
The sky rumbles threateningly as the golden afternoon begins to fall into grey, dark clouds crowning over the sun. A balmy breeze sweeps in through the half-open windows of the greenhouse, bringing with it the scent of far-off rain. On the table, balanced precariously on a stack of upturned terracotta pots, the radio scratches out a belated warning of the oncoming storm. The first droplets of rain fall heavy upon the glass ceiling.
He might not have recognized Blaise when he first appeared in the Great Hall, but Harry would recognize that particular inflection in his voice anywhere.
Hermione glares at him hard enough to burn a hole in his skull, but after their decades of friendship, he’s gotten pretty used to it. He flicks his wand at the small wardrobe beside his bookcase, spelling his formal suit into his suitcase. He won’t need his robes in Brussels, which will be a relief considering the current heatwave.
Draco melts back into Harry intuitively, sliding their hands together. He lets out a short exhale, and some of the tension eases out of his shoulders - but not enough. He’s been up since dawn, staring unseeingly out the window, his fingers rubbing over the Mark absently. Harry knows the ugly thing still hurts him - that it
‘I needed to- I want to apologise for that,’ he says. ‘For not being there. For not being able to take care of you when you needed it.’
looking for him. His absence should be a blessing on the universe, a dark smudge wiped from a flawless canvas. ‘He hates me.’
‘I’m trying to reverse-engineer a magical panic room that Draco had installed in Narcissa’s apartment,’ Harry says, the words spilling out him in a rush, ‘because I’m almost certain that Lucius is holding Draco hostage in that panic room and is probably torturing him in an attempt to force him to fix a Time Turner capable of going back years, decades in time to make sure that Riddle won the war. So yeah. Busy.’
Harry rolls his eyes and suppresses the urge to shove his boyfriend into the muddy water. ‘May I continue?’ he huffs. ‘Please?’
Harry’s not quite sure exactly when Draco started standing taller than Harry, or when he started filling out his pointy bones, or exactly when he suddenly started looking like
‘I don’t know,’ Harry sighs. ‘It’s just so weird.’ He shivers a little bit and wonders why he didn’t think to bring a coat or something.
Harry slips off Prentis’s desk and heads back to his desk to clear up. He’s done his debrief with Robards, it’s the bloody weekend, and he’s told everyone to leave him the fuck alone unless it was an emergency and there were no other Aurors in the building. He’s going to have a nice weekend with Draco, DMLE be damned.
But Malfoy’s right here - lovely Malfoy who writes lovely letters - and Harry feels like he’s been chasing the shape of Malfoy for years, tracing the imprint that he leaves in Harry’s life, as though that will somehow explain how he feels every time he reads that letter. He doesn’t want to just pay and leave and then never see Malfoy again.
Harry Apparates directly to the hotel, deciding to put off dinner until he’s had a good look at the rest of the ledger. The payments for the redecorations start a few years ago and are all paid for in installments, but last year there was a large amount of money being reshuffled in the Malfoy accounts that far exceeds even the most generous of budgets. Draco was preparing to commission something extremely expensive - something that was intended to keep his mother safe even in his absence. Something that would have been unknown to the rest of the world, just like the existence of this leather-bound volume.
Harry clasps his hands together in his lap, brushing his thumb over the fading white letters on the back of his hand. I must not tell lies. He thinks about the tight enclosure of the cupboard under the stairs and the persistent pangs of hunger. He thinks about the cold hatred he always felt exuding from Professor Snape, unearned and undeserved.
Draco withdraws slightly, and Harry mourns the loss of contact. ‘I remember what you said that last night in Ghent,’ he murmurs.
‘I have to make a call,’ Draco says suddenly, standing from his seat. ‘I have a hunch - but I want my lawyer to confirm it.’
Harry Potter is the Boy Who Lives, but only by an inch. He doesn’t know how many times he comes so fucking close to dying, on his seventh year as a wizard. He doesn’t bother keeping count. In the Forest of Dean, they run low on food and Harry wonders if maybe this is how he goes - starving slowly, going mad with the dullness of waiting for the axe to fall. When the Snatchers catch them and drag them to Malfoy Manor, Harry is pretty certain they’re going to die, that despite his shitty disguise, someone is going to recognize him, and it’ll all be over.
She grabs him by the cheeks and plants a smacking, wet kiss on his forehead. ‘About bloody time, you miserable cunt!’ she yells gleefully. ‘I thought you were going to die of stupid gay pining, you stupid, stupid
The clouds race across the sky, momentarily obscuring the moon and casting them into a pale gloom. The air is just a little too cool to be sitting out here, but he needs the icy wind beating against his face. He needs to feel something,
‘This will be difficult to confirm,’ Acquafredda says. ‘Not without requesting the Selwyn accounts and alerting them.’
Ron nudges Harry’s foot with his toe, prompting him to look up. Ron hands Harry his cup of tea (Harry has no recollection of him making it) and sits down next to him.
‘Fine,’ Harry relents. He unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls them up to his elbows, revealing the interlocking spheres tattooed on his forearms in black ink.
‘How is this for everything-forever-happy-ending?’ Draco asks Harry, in a quiet murmur, his thumbs tracing gentle patterns over the backs of Harry’s hands.
‘Hm,’ Draco intones flatly. He flicks his wand and the pages of the ledger flip forwards, before snapping into place.
Draco pulls Harry’s hand into his own, turning it over in his lap until Harry’s palm faces the ceiling. The ring catches the full warmth of the fire, turning brilliant amber. Draco’s fingertips trace the cool metal, then they dance up over the raised callouses within the cup of Harry’s palm, up further, until the pads of his fingers rest delicately over the overlapping spheres of Harry’s tattoos. Draco tilts his face up to meet Harry’s.
Harry has to resist an overwhelming urge to go over there and adjust the strength of her lenses. Draco seems to read his mind, because he flashes Harry a tiny, knowing smirk.
It isn’t the perfect job, working at Hogwarts. His students are incredibly difficult (he loves them, God help him, he loves them) and he tries his best, and for the most part he’s found his footing. The workload is intense and he’s constantly exhausted, and when he trudges up the stairs to his private quarters, he passes plaque after plaque commemorating the people who died in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry’s never really had to face any of this, all these years since the War, too busy running towards -
His voice has an unpleasant, reedy tone to it that sets Harry’s teeth on edge. ‘Did you not treat Mr. Malfoy’s victims?’
‘Perhaps we should drop by another time?’ Harry offers, setting down his tea. ‘I know I sort of barged in without warning.’
Daphne rises from her seat on Harry’s bed and strides over to the table. She drags the other chair over, turning it to face Harry before dropping gracefully into it. She taps her wand against the spheres on Harry’s left arm, and then watches closely as each sphere glows brilliant crimson, before fading back to black.
Marsters takes a sip of his coffee and sets it back down. ‘However,’ he says, glancing up at Harry through his wire-rimmed spectacles, ‘there’s nothing preventing me from talking about myself.’ And then he smiles, slow and deliberate, and pulls a cigarette case from the breast pocket of his jacket.
These days Harry makes sure he has a pocket full of Pepper-Up potions and smelling salts in case that ever happens again, and he makes sure to cast the diagnostic spell on Malfoy each time they see each other. He wishes he could ease the tight coil in his chest, but Malfoy looked so fragile, lying there on the grass with his lips so pale they were bone-white.
‘Hermione,’ Harry says, reaching out to take her hand in his. He smiles warmly at her. He hates these interventions, but he adores her, and he loves Rosie with every last bit of his tired old heart. ‘It’s going to be fine.’
‘Sorry about that,’ says Smith with a sweetness so artificial it burns. ‘We have to follow all leads we get. Auror protocol and all that. You understand, don’t you, Malfoy?’
Draco spends the next few days learning about multiple sclerosis. In the wizarding world, non-magical diseases are not given the chance to harm their hosts the way they do in the Muggle world - and Draco wonders why the Statute of Secrecy exists when they could be curing Muggles of their afflictions, easing pain and suffering.
Harry isn’t sure what to expect. As he follows Narcissa down the short, carpeted hallway towards the living room, his mind races through the options. He hopes it’s Draco. It can’t be Lucius - this building has a million wards on it ensuring that no one with a criminal magical signature can get through. Harry briefly entertains the wild idea that it might be Teddy, but he knows Teddy is halfway across the world doing his apprenticeship.
Draco’s voice still haunts Harry. It keeps him awake, staring into the dark with hatred burning on his tongue and his sheets curling, blackening with the spread of his fiery rage.
Blaise’s expression grows grim and he scribbles something down in the margins of his notebook. He scans it for a moment, a muscle ticking away in his jaw as he does. Harry feels a strange sense of deja vu. He’s been on that side of the interrogation so many times, and asked a similar set of questions with the same polite detachment.
He’s probably breaking an inordinate number of rules, but he’s at his wits’ end, and honestly, it’s been a while since he could rely on the well-oiled machine of the Potter-Weasley partnership. Harry gets too close, a victim of tunnel vision and hyperfocus, while Ron’s always been good with looking at the bigger picture. He’s also learned a bunch of new tricks with his work at the shop.
Halfway through dinner, Hagrid gets up to give a speech. He has to stoop a little in order to avoid tangling his hat with the fairy lights strung between the trees. There are plenty of encouraging whoops and applause as Hagrid straightens his horrendous tie and gives everyone a nervous little smile. He’s gotten a few grey hairs over the years, but nothing else about him has changed - not even his terrible taste in clothing.
Harry drops his head, leaning it on the curve of Draco’s shoulder. He closes his eyes. Draco’s scent envelops him.
Draco rolls his eyes. ‘I’m an adult,’ he scoffs. ‘I can talk about our previous partners without having a mental breakdown.’
Toward the tail end of fifth year, Severus started teaching Draco potions to be used on a battlefield. Draco knows now that it was a dismal attempt to build Draco a shelter for the oncoming storm, even though they both knew nothing could lessen its devastating blow.
‘You’re drunk, Potter,’ Draco grins, catching the olive between his teeth and pulling it off the toothpick in one smooth motion.
Maybe you have to round up Death Eater after Death Eater until they’re all locked up in Azkaban. Maybe you have to reinvent magical tracking, or maybe pioneer a new system for infiltrating Death Eater safehouses. Maybe you learn Cursebreaking overnight when the Ministry budget won’t stretch to give you that extra bit of help that, quite frankly, should be in the fucking budget, but we’re not counting straws here, it’s fine. Maybe you have a few harrowing near-misses with death and collect so many scars that you forget how many you have.
Blaise seems to have asked all his questions. He twists the cap back onto his pen and tucks it into the breast pocket of his waistcoat. The crease between his eyebrows disappears, and his face empties of any expression, like a sheet pulled tight over a mattress.
‘You were always my anchor, Draco,’ he says. ‘You, your magic… it was a safe place to go. A haven away from everything.’ He bounces his leg, wound up with nervous energy. His words feel clumsy. Inadequate.
Blaise’s voice sounds in Harry’s ears - a warning perhaps, if he knows what Harry is about to do, knows what this will mean for the laws of magic and the rules of their universe, but Harry never hears the rest of it.
He pours water into the teapot, locates enough matching mugs for the three of them, and heads back into the living room.  Pansy’s face is scrunched up with frustration, streaked with dark tracks from where her weeping has melted her mascara, her eyes reddened and slightly swollen. Draco looks tired, dark shadows prominent beneath his eyes, his mouth twisted into a slight frown.
Harry thinks about Marie’s face, blotchy with a month’s worth of tears, and Prentis’s desk, empty but for a vase of wilting flowers, and the memorial they’re building out in the ruins of Diagon Alley. He thinks of Draco’s hand wrapped tightly around his, the overly clean smell of the intensive care ward. He thinks of the other people lying in the beds of St. Mungo’s, the families crowded in the hallways, too exhausted for tears. He thinks about the ones who didn’t wake up. The ones who didn’t make it to the hospital at all.
you’re the Chosen One. It makes me glad that You-Know-Who didn’t pick me that night.’ He shrugs. ‘Maybe that makes me a bit of a twat too.’
I do love my angst. I hope you do too, because ch 11 is going to be pretty angsty too. Don’t worry though, I’m also a stickler for happy endings.
Potter’s shirt is new, better fitted than his usual garb. It stretches over his broad shoulders, pulls against his torso. He has filled out over the years they spent apart - no longer skinny, knees no longer knobbly. His hair is wild as it falls over the silver-white cracks of the scar on his forehead. Outside, lightning forks across the purple-dark sky, mirroring the pattern perfectly. His eyes glow in the dim light of the energy-saving bulbs, and he grins wickedly at Draco as lightning flares again in the distance and thunder shakes foundations of the building.
He’s a bit tipsy from the fancy champagne and the not-so-fancy firewhiskey Ron brought, so maybe he says a few things he shouldn’t. Things like,
Harry huffs a quiet laugh. Draco’s hair has come loose from its neat parting, and his fringe falls over his forehead and into his eyes. Harry pushes a lock of pale hair out of Draco’s face.
Harry’s so happy for him. He’s sad, sure, but he’s also so happy it makes his heart ache in a nice, glowy kind of way. Ron deserves a life with his family. He deserves to go home at a reasonable time, to play with his kids and know that he’ll be around to watch them grow up. Harry won’t have to carry Dittany around so much anymore, now that he knows Ron’s safe.
‘He writes me lovely letters though,’ Andromeda adds thoughtfully. ‘You know, he reminds of Regulus, sometimes. Poor, sweet boys.’ She coaxes Teddy off of Harry and holds him hostage in the crook of her arm, gently batting away his tiny, grabbing hands. ‘Would you like to see one?’
Draco’s eyes glimmer ever so slightly and he quickly diverts his gaze as though he were afraid of how Harry would react to a sign of vulnerability. Harry is scared to move in case he accidentally pushes the blonde man further away. After a moment, however, Draco smiles slightly and looks directly into Harry’s wide eyes, and places his hand on Harry’s.
“Well,” Bellatrix smiles sweetly and lowers the knife, “That’s not the attitude a future follower of the Dark Lord should have. Why, he sent me personally to advise you to take on your Father’s role.”
A/N: It’s pretty obvious that I know nothing about guns so just go with it pls… tysm H for being my betaaaa
The emotions going through Draco’s mind had increased beyond anything he had ever felt and he began to hyperventilate. His mind couldn't comprehend what was happening; he had only just gotten Midnight-- why was his father trying to take him away from him? What did Midnight do wrong? Why does he have to shoot his friend? Is this all a trick? Is he dreaming? What would his father do if he said no? As Draco became more and more confused and panicked Lucius huffed in frustration. He dragged the oblivious puppy by its collar and had planted it firmly in front of Draco, telling it to stay. Despite just being a puppy Midnight stayed in the same spot, eagerly looking at Draco as though they were about to play a game.
“I honestly don’t know who or what the third party is,” Harry sighs in defeat, “And I can’t organise a meeting with Cresswell without McGonagall hauling me in for questioning. I know she’ll kick me off the case because I don’t have a link to show her yet, and I can’t afford to lose this, not when I’m so close.” Ron’s eyes are filled with sympathy when Harry looks up at them, and the knowledge that his friend pities him makes Harry’s stomach twist uncomfortably. He doesn’t need pity, he needs someone to think like he does so he isn’t trying to conduct a secret side investigation all on his own.
“I’m fine up here thanks,” Draco’s tone was short and direct, his confusion at the situation causing his patience to wear thin, “Are you the one who’s been calling?” The man sighed and gestured to the chair again with a bored expression. Draco clenched his jaw in annoyance but walked to the chair, never taking his eyes or gun off the man. When he was sat down he rested his elbow on the table, angling the gun directly between the man’s eyes. “Answer me, now.”
After that point Draco spent more time in the little room in the far corner of the west wing. He’d spend hours on end trying to play songs he heard on the radio, avoiding all contact with anyone in the outside world. He’d never say that he was good (he’d never had a lesson in his life) but there was something about the way his fingers seamlessly flowed over the keys creating melodies he’d never even heard before that calmed his mind and kept him sane in the dark, dreary place he called home. Ever since his parent’s accident Draco had been spending a lot more time in this room to try and escape the dead, stagnant air in the rest of the house. Although his family had never been particularly loud there had always been noises somewhere in the house, whether it was servants making food in the kitchens, his father talking to clients or his mother arguing with her bat-shit sister. But now the servants are long gone, Lucius’ clients are now Draco’s and Bellatrix is completely off the radar. This evidently leaves Draco all alone in the echoing manor with peeling wallpaper and an ever increasing amount of grime on the windows, neither of which he can be bothered fixing.
“It’s Draco Malfoy, Lucius’ son. Put me through.” He tried to sound demanding but the slight tremble in his voice gave him away.
“I don’t know,” Harry shrugs and smiles briefly at the waitress placing their drinks on the table, “I guess you and I have a lot in common.”
“In the kitchen, down the hall.” Draco’s voice was surprisingly calm for someone so anxious. Voldemort didn’t speak as he walked into the house, merely signalling to the Death Eaters with him to stay outside. Draco couldn’t quite make out their faces in their darkness and didn’t particularly feel comfortable walking up to them and making conversation so he turned  back inside and followed Voldemort down the hall to the kitchen.
“Parseltongue.” Draco hoped to God that was correct otherwise he’d be in a lot of shit. Thankfully he was, and before he knew it the low voice of Voldemort was sending shivers up his spine.
“No one is entirely innocent Harry, but I do believe in justice.” Draco looks directly into Harry’s eyes and Harry sees a flash of danger in the serene grey. It’s exhilarating.
“I tell ya what happened if ya listen an’ ‘humour me’ as ya phrased it. Guessin’ ya know who Voldemort is, or did yer daddy not wanna scare ya with the big bad boss?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco’s voice is quiet but steady, “But my point still stands, I’m not leaving here until you’re dead.”
“The Dark Lord has eyes everywhere,” Bellatrix looks directly into Draco’s eyes, “This is who you are meant to be Draco, it’s what you were raised for.”
“Great,” Voldemort clapped, “Now that’s over with, I’ve been meaning to ask you about joining my organisation. We could use someone like you, Draco.”
In that moment, staring at a picture of a man who’s life Draco just snatched away, Draco feels closer to his father than ever before. Lucius’ emotional distance wasn’t confined to his relationship with Draco, Lucius Malfoy had been completely disconnected from everything in his life. Memories of Christmases past where a young Draco would excitedly open presents with his Mother in front of the grand fireplace are plagued by an absence of his Father. At the grand dinner parties his parents would host his Mother and Father were only identifiable as a couple by their matching silver wedding bands, take those away and they could have easily been complete strangers. If Lucius could barely even tolerate a connection with his own wife and son, then how could he have possibly held any emotional regard for those he killed?
Draco kept the gun pointed in front of him as he walked down the hall lit only by lamps, sticking to the shadows until he came to the door to what he assumed to be the kitchen. The wooden door was slightly off of its hinges and only partially open, so Draco couldn’t see what the man was doing. There was a lamp near the door frame which would no doubt cast a shadow and give away his presence if he attempted to listen at the door, so he decided to use the element of surprise to his advantage at this time. He pushed open the door suddenly and walked into the brightly lit kitchen, pointing his gun directly at the man sat at the table eating a bowl of soup. To Draco’s surprise the man didn’t look panicked at the intrusion; instead turning a blind eye as he merely went back to eating. Draco took this moment to scan the room for any phones or weapons, but all he could see was the pots and pans, not even any kitchen knives. He flicked his eyes back to the man who was still silently enjoying his soup, trying to figure out what was running through his mind at this moment. His questions were answered when the man sighed, wiped his mouth with a piece of tissue and set his spoon down.
“So” Ron pushed away from his desk so that his spinning chair travelled up next to Harry, “Whatcha doing?” Harry glances sideways at Ron briefly before smirking.
“No,” Draco shakes his head, “No, I kill people that deserve it. You… all of you, you do this for fun. You enjoy seeing the light of someone’s eyes go out when you take their life away, you look forward to what disgusting thing you’ll do to their bodies after they’ve died. I’m not like you, I’m nothing like my Father. So tell your Lord to fuck off, and leave me and my friends alone.”
“Hello?” Harry’s voice is low and husky, like he’s just been awoken from a deep sleep. Draco feels a sense of guilt wash over him knowing that he’s woken Harry up for such a stupid reason, but he can’t bring himself to hang up the phone.
“Hello? What do you want?” Draco’s voice is much more rushed this time, with a hint of concern. The cry was high pitched, almost like a child, and as bad a person as he was, the sound of this pained child panicked him. The phone falls silent again for a moment before the breathing starts again. This time it's heavier and gets increasingly louder. The knots in Draco’s stomach which had been present when he was walking down the corridor come back with vengeance and his heart-rate speeds up. He angrily slams the phone down and takes three steps back, looking at it like it just transformed into a cat. Draco shakes his head aggressively, blonde strands falling over his eyes, and tells himself to get a grip over what was probably just a stupid prank call. He glances at the large grandfather clock in the far right of the room and sees it's almost ten o’clock at night. As soon as he notices this his body begins to ache with fatigue and he decides that it's probably time to retire for the night. In his youth he’d stay awake well into the early hours of the morning but as he’s grown older his body can’t function on less than five hours of sleep. Wearily, Draco goes towards to stairs leading to the second floor, but stops in his tracks when he hears the phone ring again. Part of him wishes to just ignore the caller and and go pass out on his bed but he knows it’s likely that the caller will just keep on calling. But they’ll probably stop if he shouts at them; after all they’re probably just some bored children. He picks up the phone once more and listens out for the heavy breathing, but he can’t hear anything at all.
“You have until midnight tomorrow, choose wisely.” With that, she swoops out of the room, and Draco doesn’t dare move until he hears the door quietly shut. Letting out a shaky breath, Draco turns around to stand over the weakly breathing body of Mulciber. The dying man’s eyes open and stare at Draco, as if he were trying to communicate one last ‘fuck you’ before he goes. Without a word, Draco puts a bullet in the man’s forehead, a feeling of unease in his stomach as he watches Mulciber’s eyes go glassy. Quickly, Draco grabs his duffel bag and quickly scans around the apartment. It is messier than those of his usual kills, but the only prints left will be Mulciber’s and Bellatrix’s, so there’s no need to attempt to clean anything.
His parent’s nurse Jean comes over at around noon to check up on their vitals, and Draco stands awkwardly in the doorframe watching the frail old woman fiddling with the tubes and wires around his parents’ beds. They look so small and fragile in their white hospital gowns that Draco struggles to see them as the people he was once so afraid of. Even though Mother had never been as intimidating as Father, Draco still feared disappointing her as when he did, she would look at him with a look which told him that she didn’t think he was worthy of the Malfoy name. A look that hadn’t been in her eyes for a long time now. Jean finishes sorting out the senior Malfoys and turns to Draco, smiling wearily at him. As she begins to carry her medical bag out of the room, Draco stops her suddenly, the impulsive need to do something selfless taking over his usual thought process.
By the time Draco returns to the manor the sun is much lower in the sky and the hedge is casting distorted shadows across the great walls. He smiles as the dog barked excitedly when they entered the house, and a soft chuckle escapes his lips when he imagines how his father would react to seeing this, especially a stray. After Draco has washed the dog’s matted fur and fed it some scraps of meat he decides on spending the remainder of his evening in the main office sorting through the decades of paperwork his father had neglected. Part of Draco’s job as the only member of his father’s business is to sort out the masses of paperwork he had let fall into disorder, and Draco has always found organisation to be a relaxing task.
“Yes, someone who can detach himself completely. You’d be a valuable asset. Think about it Draco, you know where I am.” Voldemort gently ran his hand along Draco’s shoulder as he left the room, and when Draco heard the door shut his knees buckled and he almost fell to the ground. He stumbled over to the fridge and pulled the scrap paper with the instructions, breathing deeply and heavily. He slipped on some plastic gloves to avoid fingerprints before arranged the gun in the man's hand to make it look like a suicide. He’d thankfully shot the man at an angle where the blood splatter was behind his head, but he still took the routine precautions of staging a suicide. Draco arranged the corpse so it was sat at the table and positioned so that the blood splatter seemed to make sense. Motive is always vital when staging a suicide, but this man has no need for a note. No one was close enough to him to come by his house soon so he wouldn’t have anyone to write to. Draco glanced around the room carefully and spotted a photo frame with a photograph of the man and his family. ‘Perfect’, Draco thinks as he places the photo directly in front of the dead man. He does consider some blood drops on the frame but decides against that extra level of embellishment. Less is more after all.
“And why the fuck would I do that?” Draco snorted, “I can just shoot you right now and be done with it. I have no intention of getting involved in Voldemort’s little games. Do it yourself.”
“I’ll tell you if you tell me why you’re phoning at one in the morning on a Thursday.” Draco could practically hear Harry smirking on the other side of the phone. He wonders how far away Harry actually is, the bar they had met at was a 15 minute drive away from Malfoy Manor, but since Draco wanted to spend as much time away from that place as possible he would often walk for hours on end down the old lanes leading into the main city. Ever since meeting Harry he had been wondering what it would be like to walk with the messy haired man along that road, talking about anything and everything. Yet Draco couldn’t imagine that Harry would appreciate the nature of Draco’s job, or the intricacies of his home life. It’s for this reason that Draco decides that it's best not to tell Harry about the phone call, Draco wants to track the source and take care of this himself.
“Harry”, his shoulders relax and he continues piling the papers up, “My name’s Harry. And yes I’ve just had a look through them and Ron gave me a brief rundown of what the two of you discussed. But I’d be more than happy to talk through it with you now-- honestly I feel like I'm running in circles in this whole case.” Hermione nods in agreement and perches on the edge of Ron’s desk.
“Password.” The bored voice of a woman sounded over the phone, Draco vaguely recognised it but he couldn’t place her.
“You’re lucky I don’t just shoot you now.” Bellatrix’s grin widens at the anger in Draco’s voice, “You’ve not even come to see Mother since the accident, just left me alone to deal with it. So answer my question before things get messy; what are you doing here?”
The sound of a woodpigeon screeching at the top of its little lungs arguably isn’t the best sound to wake up to, but nevertheless it's the noise that drags Draco out of his slumber at around nine in the morning. The sun is shining on the grounds making them look like something straight out of Jane Eyre, and for a brief moment Draco completely forgets about the events of the previous night. However, the peace doesn’t last long and before Draco knows it the computerised voice is sounding in his head once more, repeating the same combination of numbers from the previous night over and over as if on a loop. The frustration of being utterly unaware of where he has heard the numbers before eats away at his gut whilst he sits alone at the head of the dining table and looks at the empty chairs surrounding him. As the day progresses, Draco finds himself growing increasingly agitated as the numbers relentlessly throb in his mind, like a headache he can’t get rid of. Even texting Harry doesn’t cease the dull ache, but he realises that it would be out of the question to ask Harry for his advice in case the numbers link to something which could damage their relationship, or whatever their current status is. Hopefully that issue would be addressed when they get coffee tomorrow, resolving at least one of the disconcerting troubles within his mind.
“Nothing much as I’ve not got anything conclusive to go on. But some evidence points towards this whole thing being conducted under a ringleader, these are his minions but he’s up there calling the shots.”
“I’m going to stop you right there,” Ron interrupted him abruptly, “You work harder than anyone I’ve ever met, certainly harder than anyone in this department. So don’t you dare start bombing off having a life so you can lose yourself in some killer’s mind, it's not healthy.” Ron gestures wildly at Harry, the compassion clear in his blue eyes. â€œI know you’re not keen on coming out with everyone else here, and I don’t mind that because I know you. Even if you don’t think I do, I do. As long as I’ve known you you’ve avoided getting close to people and I’ve done my best to avoid forcing you into a situation you won’t be comfortable in, but goddamnit Harry I swear to god if you don’t at least try with this guy I will tell Mum you’ve not been looking after yourself.” Most people would assume that Ron was joking but the gaze he held told Harry that Ron was deadly serious. “Now which is worse; having a coffee with this guy who you’re clearly into, or having my Mum not let you leave her sight until you’ve gained at least five pounds and sleep for over eight hours a night? Now I don’t know about you but I’d rather have a date and keep my job. So wha’s it gonna be?” Ron is somewhat surprised at his outburst, but he takes pride in the fact that Harry hadn’t zoned out at any point and seemed to be digesting his words carefully.
‘I’ll pay for the bloody heating,’ he huffs. ‘Tell me how much it is, and I’ll transfer it. Alright?’
Blaise, to his great dismay, catches the bouquet - but only because Draco lobs it at his head with the speed and accuracy befitting an ex-Seeker.
Harry leaves for Antwerp first thing in the morning. The wizarding quarter is hidden down an alley in the diamond district, a pocket universe tucked away in between the cobbled streets and dazzling buildings. He pulls his hair down over his scar and exchanges his gold-rimmed glasses for a pair of sunglasses, blending in easily with the crowd. He doesn’t have time for adoring fans today.
‘Am I to assume you slept through your mandatory potions training, Auror Potter?’ Draco asks, folding his arms over his chest. ‘Or must I provide you with a personal training session so that you don’t inadvertently kill yourself
‘Okay,’ Harry says. He folds his hands in his lap, if only to stop from reaching out towards the other man. ‘But Draco? You won’t lose me. Ever.’
This is the second intervention Hermione’s held. She’s brought Rosie over to Grimmauld Place as ammunition in her assault on Harry’s overwhelming guilt. It’s difficult to dodge her questions when he’s got an armful of adorable, gap-toothed toddler.
He still has nightmares of being trapped beneath the rubble, of staring up into the impenetrable darkness, trying to find space to breathe with slabs of mortar and brick pressing down on him. He still sends flowers to Marie every year, still visits the memorial to seek out his ex-partner’s name among the listed victims of the explosion and feels that horrible surge of guilt that he lived, and so many did not.
Draco’s smile is the bite of a midwinter wind. ‘Another coincidence?’ he says, his voice soft and sweetly mocking. ‘Ah, of course. I’m sure you’re right, Auror Proudfoot.’
McGonagall summons the scroll with a flick of her wand. She unrolls the paper slowly, peering through her spectacles at the document. ‘Technically, gentlemen,’ she says, her voice crisp with displeasure, ‘this document is incorrect. You have a warrant here for a Mr. Harry James Potter, but the correct prefix is
Neville tilts his head. ‘You mean,’ he says slowly, levelling an indecipherable look at Harry, ‘commute to Hogwarts.’
Draco shakes his head. ‘No, I was asleep but-’ he breaks off with a sharp inhale, and he looks down at his bare feet.
Harry bites down on his lower lip. There is a precipice that he’s toeing here, and once he takes a step over the edge he might likely never climb back out again.
‘I want to make you as happy as you deserve to be,’ Draco whispers. He flicks the ring box open, revealing the band of white-gold within. ‘To give you everything you desire, to realise all your greatest aspirations. To defend you when you are attacked. To be your sanctuary, to hold you when you are weak. To go to bed with you, to wake up with you, to be with you for the rest of my life.’
‘We can’t actually provide you the skeleton-key charm either,’ Angel says. ‘Assuming that’s why you’ve come to speak to us.’
She pulls out her wand and flicks it at the mess around Harry’s room. The papers stack themselves neatly and fly over to the counter, settling in neat piles beside the complimentary tea-and-coffee set. The filing cabinet makes a soft popping sound as it grows tiny little clawed feet, and it scurries over after the files before hunkering down.
Harry sighs again, and Draco lifts and falls with the expanding of Harry’s chest. His arm is a comforting weight around Draco, his leg pulled up to brace the side of Draco’s torso. He is steady, steady, the rocky outcrop from which the lighthouse stands, and Draco clings to him and breathes.
kind of cheerfulness, ‘now’s the best time to consider that offer from the Tornados. They’re dying to have you.’
Malfoy looks completely different from when Harry last saw him. His hair curls slightly over his temples and behind his ears, and his cheeks are flushed a blotchy pink from the heat of the shop. The ever-present bruises under his eyes from sixth year are gone. He’s dressed in startlingly Muggle clothes - sweater and sensible jeans - and though he’s still on the thin side, he no longer looks like a stiff breeze would knock him over.
‘To be honest, I’m happy for you,’ Teddy continues, a gentler tone settling into his voice. ‘I think you deserve to be loved as deeply as you both clearly love each other. As deeply as you both have loved me.’
Harry tugs off his cardigan and drapes it over a clotheshorse - purchased by Draco and forced upon Harry after one too many shirt-on-chair incidents. He needs a hot shower to ease the knots in his back, and he hasn’t washed his hair in days.
party, while Andromeda sits back in her chair and fans herself tiredly, muttering about being too old for this sort of thing. Draco’s been kidnapped by the army of Weasleys. When Harry peers over, he spots Draco looking horrified as George orders drinks from the bar, his arm wrapped around Draco in what Harry knows from personal experience is an iron grip.
Harry nods, all out of words, swaying into Draco just enough that he has to catch him by the waist. They wander off the dance floor, through a pair of open doors onto a curved balcony. The party is just starting, so all the other balconies are quiet and empty - and it is just them and the night.
‘I’m afraid, Mr. Potter, that I cannot answer any of your questions directly concerning Lucius Malfoy.’ Marsters tears apart the third packet of sugar and pours it into his coffee. ‘There are certain magical contracts in place that prevent me from talking about the facts of the case, and anything else written down on the protected documents. I can’t tell you what Lucius was doing, the people he was involved with, or any of the schemes he had planned.’
Even after they release him from Azkaban and send him back to Malfoy Manor, Draco cannot bring himself to stomach food.
Harry manages a chuckle. After three hours of working with the elder Weasley, Harry wonders how Ron’s managed to put up with it for this long. George’s spikes of creative energy are exhausting - it’s like being strapped to a rollercoaster manned by a chaos demon with a penchant for explosives.
‘Professor Harry James Potter,’ Proudfoot reads aloud, his face pinching as though he’s tasted something vile, ‘is hereby appointed official consultant to the Department of Mysteries.’ He thrusts the letter in Harry’s direction. ‘
Teddy sets his mug down and rests his elbows on the table. ‘Look,’ he says, dropping his chin slightly as he levels them both a look. ‘You two are incredibly important to me. You made sure that I never once felt unloved or unwanted. I’ve had a happier family life than most of my friends because of it. I’m always going to be grateful for that.’
‘People speak like that if they’re drugged,’ Harry says thoughtfully. He glances up at Pansy. ‘Could it be that?’
say it was weird,’ Harry snorts. ‘But, to get back to the point - as far as Draco’s told me, his mother is actually quite good at throwing off any kind of mind-altering curses.’
that brings her here now, to sit in this empty slaughterhouse with him and offer him undeserved help.
Draco’s grip tightens on Harry’s arm slightly, but the warning is hardly necessary. Pansy’s voice is beginning to climb steadily in pitch, wobbling dangerously. She clenches her fists, shakes them out, and clenches them again. Her knuckles turn bone white.
‘I can’t change our past,’ Draco tells Harry, ‘no matter how much I want to. But,’ he adds, his voice taking on a hard, determined tone, ‘you’re not going to be a tragedy. I’m not going to be a tragedy. We’re going to have everything, Harry. Just you wait and see.’
Vague mentions of violence, mentions of injuries and blood. You can skip the trial entirely and get to Weasley chaos at “According to Molly’s infinite wisdom…”
‘You are welcome any time, Mr. Potter,’ Narcissa says. Her gaze slides back over to that same spot on the wall behind Harry. ‘Please return at your earliest convenience. Yes. Draco would love it.’
But then Harry Potter yells at the Wizengamot in his defence and blows up a courtroom in a fit of accidental magic.
He expects to see anger in Neville’s face - or perhaps confusion, disgust - but instead the Herbology Professor just looks sad.
Harry frowns at the Auror’s neat, slanting script. He checks the address again, noticing that it’s been owled from a private address. It’s unusual for an Auror of this seniority not to go through the correct channels. Maybe it’s nothing, but something tugs at the base of Harry’s spine.
Blaise is nearly soundless as he makes his way across the study to Draco’s side. ‘Out of interest, Draco,’ he asks, his tone intentionally mild, ‘what are you going to do with this information?’
Draco smiles at him with heartbreaking tenderness, beautiful even in the cold, unforgiving light. ‘Oh, my darling imbecile,’ Draco says. ‘I’m not going anywhere.’
Hermione shakes her head. ‘It feels off,’ she says. ‘I’m worried about him. I’m worried about you, too. You shouldn’t have to do this.’
Draco takes his uninvited desire and places it deep within him, in a place he will not have to look. He keeps his head down and tries to be worthy of Potter’s outburst.
‘I’m sorry,’ he tells her. ‘I’m sorry. I have to go.’ He steps away, already pulling his wand from its holster. ‘I have to go back and start working on getting him out of there.’
Harry sorts through reports and papers and notes and records and long-form analyses, searching instead for the thin trail that will show him not
‘Harry,’ Neville says heavily. ‘You’ve got to stop beating yourself up about this. You went through a lot.’
‘Well, what the fuck were you expecting, Daphne?’ Harry snaps. He slams the ledger down on the table and crosses his arms tightly over his chest. ‘Of course I can’t fucking eat or sleep or think straight. The man I love has been missing for nearly two weeks and is probably being tortured by his abusive, ex-convict father as we speak. So please, forgive me if I’m not sticking to your
‘She said it wasn’t my fault we broke up,’ Harry mumbles, staring down his fifth glass of extremely nice goblin wine. ‘But it was.’
This fic is a cathartic piece of writing where I look at cannon, and go, ‘nah, screw that’. This is especially true for Draco’s actions during the war.
It makes sense, in the grand scheme of things, that the day that it all goes to shit is the happiest day of his life.
However, Harry is also a direct descendant of James Potter, twat extraordinaire, and incredibly incapable of levity in any situation, so he says: ‘It’s not a competition, Draco. It’s a
Blaise shifts his weight slightly and glances around the room, his eyes lingering on Ginny. His gaze lands on Draco, and whatever he sees there makes all his hesitation evaporate. ‘Oh,’ he sighs, ‘to hell with it. The DMLE reached out to the Department of Mysteries, since Potter’s technically under our office. They’re offering a deal.’
In a different world, travelling down a different path of time where the same deck of cards is stacked in a different array, he thinks he might have sought retribution instead of redemption.
He knows each secret corner of the city, each hidden alcove of the cathedral. He leads Harry down twisting alleyways into quiet little squares. He knows the local butcher by name and he has a favourite bakery -
The song draws to a close, and Astoria flings herself into her husband’s arms, too excited for formalities and curtsies. She drags him by the hand towards Daphne and Luna as the quartet picks up a cheerful tune.
Draco’s hand pulls free of Harry’s, and he cups Harry’s face with a tenderness that threatens to destroy Harry.
It’s a relief when Teddy comes to stay when school lets out. There’s a sobering effect to having a teenager’s eyes latched on you at all hours of the day - and a complete lack of privacy.
Harry stares at the cigarette, the amber end glowing brilliantly in the curve of his hand. The first pull of Draco’s cigarette makes him cough a little, but the second eases off the pounding at his temples a little. He frowns at the cigarette.
Neville grabs Harry firmly by the wrist and drags him back into his seat. ‘Easy, Harry,’ Neville whispers.
Dessert plates get taken away and piled in the sink, and Arthur brings out his good whiskey. Draco excuses himself to go outside for a cigarette, and after a moment, Harry extracts himself from the dining room to follow him out. He loves the Weasleys to death, but they drink nearly as much as Pansy does, and Harry’s been very good at limiting his alcohol consumption these past few years. He has no intention of changing that tonight.
Harry shakes his head again, laughter bubbling at his lips. He can feel himself slipping into Draco’s gravitational pull - the weight shifting in his feet as he prepares to fall into orbit. Draco’s smile takes on a playful edge, and before Harry knows to react, he yanks Harry with enough force to send him careening forwards into Draco - but Draco catches him with a firm hand to his waist.
Things used to be awkward with Neville, when Harry first started working at Hogwarts. Neville was everything Harry had hoped he’d become: he was calm, reliable, stupidly handsome, and everyone liked him. Neville didn’t look like he woke up in the middle of the night sweating, trembling from vivid nightmares. Neville didn’t snap at people at the slightest provocation. And Neville was the one engaged to Ginny - and poor, lonely Harry Potter couldn’t even make it to the third date with someone before they went straight to the Prophet and spilled everything for a measly handful of Galleons.
Draco writes to each of them in reply (Draco was always good at writing letters, after all). He sits up into the late hours of the night, at the desk in Harry’s study, his brow wrinkled in concentration as he peers down through his glasses, his quill scratching away at parchment until Harry coaxes him to bed.
Harry wakes alone in bed with the sun streaming in past the curtains and for a moment he thinks that maybe he dreamt it all. But there is a warmth lingering in the sheets, and a familiar scent clinging to Harry’s clothes. Harry leans over and puts his glasses on, the world swimming back into focus, and he recalls the way he fell asleep with his legs tangled up with Draco’s, his face pushed into Draco’s warm chest, Draco’s hands tracing idle patterns on his back.
The witches protest, but their voices are muffled by the magical barrier now planted between them and the object of their obsession. Eventually, they give up and leave, magazines clutched in their hands like well-earned prizes.
He smiles up at his old friend and pats him twice on the arm. ‘Good luck, Kingsley,’ Harry says. ‘You’ll need it.’
He clears away the little table on the balcony and takes his things back inside just as the first droplets start hitting the floor. There is still half a cabinet’s worth of files to root through. Harry knows they will be just as unhelpful as the first half, but he has to try.
‘Anyways - to answer your question,’ Harry says. ‘A Time-Turner that’s modified to turn back weeks is made with the capacity to hold all the probabilities of the time that has to pass through it. But it would be extremely difficult to modify that Time-Turner further to allow it to process all the probabilities of a decade. You would need to replace almost all of the components of the device - and alter almost all of the spells.’
Harry stills. They haven’t done anything beyond a bit of heavy petting and a lot of kissing, mostly due to how fragile Draco’s body has been following the kidnapping - and with the added chaos of Harry’s arrest and subsequent release, Harry is afraid that Draco’s managed to exacerbate his condition with lack of sleep and compounded stress.
Hermione taught Harry the diagnostic spells a while ago. The twitching is only one of the side effects of curse damage. If Malfoy is having a bad day, he can end up passing out - as Harry had to witness one particular evening playing with Teddy in the garden. Malfoy was fine one minute, then flat on his back the next.
‘This is Astoria’s sister, Daphne Greengrass,’ Luna introduces, waving a hand between the two of them. ‘You remember Astoria, don’t you Harry? She was my roommate.’
Harry clicks his tongue in sympathy. Ginny’s a good sport, but she’s taken her losses rather heavily since she was promoted to team captain.
Proudfoot seems as perturbed by the whole situation as Harry is. ‘Now just wait here, Zabini,’ the Auror says, pointing at the Unspeakable. ‘The Department of Mysteries don’t have the authority to let a Hogwarts teacher hijack an Auror investigation.’
The Greengrass estate hovers in an ocean of botanical wonder, the white pillars of its facade shining out over the hedges like the brilliant lights of a schooner waiting beyond the tide. Golden lights hover above the extensive gardens like flickering fireflies. Harry and Draco make their way down a long gravel path lined with tall hedges, following a long trail of wedding guests. The air has lost the balmy weight of midsummer, and the sky is clear of clouds.
is printed in white across the glass panel on the front door, and directly underneath, in smaller letters:
However, as they fasten his fingers into place with metal braces, all he feels is a depthless, vacant kind of calm.
They pick a spot on the grass in view of the Towers. Between the trees, the grey buildings gleam in the afternoon sun. They share bottles of sugary lemonade and Harry rejoices in the ability to lounge alongside his boyfriend without having people come up and disturb their peace (with the exception of a young woman and her girlfriend, who briefly enrol their help in taking an adorable picture of them both with the rides looming in the background). He’s so happy he feels like he’s spinning upwards into the blue sky, up, and up amongst the scattered clouds. He lies back into the grass and feels Draco’s weight next to him, his magic sprawling outwards, feels the sun on his face and feels himself, at long last, spinning in time with the world’s axis.
He smiles at Harry like they’re sharing the most delicious inside joke, and Harry tries not to roll his eyes. Last week Draco went with Harry all the way to Germany to watch Ginny’s match, even though it rained
Draco sighs softly, his breath tickling Harry’s skin. ‘Because,’ he says, ‘if I call you by your name, I’ll be forced to have feelings, and I’m rather enjoying this vapid, unemotional level of drunkenness.’
‘You helped me already, Pansy,’ he tells her, as sincere as he knows how to be. ‘More than you know. More than you’ll ever know.’
‘Yeah, but only after I made team captain,’ Teddy scoffs. ‘Honestly. We’re having a family emergency,
Dinner is lasagne, warm and luxurious, and pull-apart cheesy bread. Draco’s eyes are warm as he watches Harry lick the garlic oil off his fingers. They don’t talk about this gentle
Draco laughs so hard throughout Harry’s awkward fumbling that he nearly spills his drink down his shirt.
There is so much blood. The floor is wet with it, the rug stained so dark it looks almost black, and Harry’s knees slip in it as he scrambles to his knees. He gathers Draco in his arms.
‘Yeah, side effect of having a Horcrux attached to me for sixteen years,’ Harry replies. ‘Lost the Parseltongue, gained lots of other weird stuff. I found out last year that I can Apparate wandlessly as long as I travel along ley lines.’
They should probably be thankful for the turning tide. Draco is welcome in establishments that once turned him away coldly. He receives invitations to dinners and galas, requests for exclusive interviews, offers of sponsorship for a new broom oil or hair product - and even professions of love.
, and Harry melts like sugar in water. Harry’s hands clutch at Draco’s shirt, fine cotton wrinkling in his fists. Draco’s fingers are cool as they trace down the sides of Harry’s neck, down, down, down, one hand to cup the nape of his neck, the other to splay across the triangle of bare skin beneath his clavicle.
gave me chocolate when I was feeling down,’ he reminds Harry. ‘And we weren’t even friends back then. Hell, I’d say we were on the verge of killing each other. But you were still kind to me. You
He made a promise to Harry, years ago in a dingy alleyway stinking of piss and cheap booze - and he does not break his promises.
Pansy stares at Harry and shakes her head. ‘You complete imbecile,’ she says. ‘You could’ve gotten three more drinks out of that twink. Merlin, save us from Gryffindors.’
Draco rolls over onto his back. His fringe falls away from his forehead, revealing the nearly-elfin planes of his face and the silver of his eyes. He frowns deeply as he looks up at Harry.
There are wildflowers swaying in the night breeze. The soil is damp and a little cold, but it smells like spring - like sap and petals and blossoms and rainwater.
As Harry approaches, he realizes that the only similarity between the tall witch and Luna are their wardrobe choices. Her dark eyes are hawkish as she looks Harry over. He’s reminded, oddly enough, of McGonagall.
‘Muggles call them safe rooms,’ Angel adds. ‘Our father had one built into the cellar of our house in Florida, y’know, for the hurricanes.’ He quirks an eyebrow and lifts his hands, palms spread. ‘So, we figured, hey, why not offer a panic room for magical attacks?’
Harry wakes up to the door opening. The world is a blurry smudge of colours - his glasses must have fallen off in his sleep - and he fumbles in the blanket blindly.
‘Well, they were being rather close-minded,’ Hermione says thoughtfully. ‘And you were right, Harry. There were plenty of mitigating factors that forced Malfoy into what he did in sixth year. Though perhaps you could have articulated it a little better.’
‘Yeah,’ Harry replies, picking up his mug. ‘It makes me feel like he didn’t win, you know? You and me sitting here, talking like normal people - it feels like spitting in his face somehow.’
‘I visited your mother three times a week, every week,’ she continues, ‘and I didn’t have a clue that you were in there. I knew she was behaving weirdly - I knew she was trying to tell me something - I should have
‘That’s a no,’ Pansy says, tapping the list with her wand. ‘Have you eaten more than one meal in the past three days?’
but respond with something scathing. The tragedy of it is that he is forced to look upon the object of his desires, and once he looks, he cannot bring himself to stop.
Draco’s relief washes over his face, and he smiles so fondly at Harry that it makes the jagged wound in his heart almost bearable.
They don’t let him enter the operating room, so Harry ends up sitting outside with his awful, spiralling thoughts. He stares down at his boots and tries not to think about the dark stain growing on Narcissa’s rug. The fingers of crimson spreading outwards. The flash of pink and white and red of Draco’s insides. The blood drying on his trousers, the sticky residue on his shirt.
(In an attempt to repay Daphne for her unflinching kindness, Draco once visited Astoria’s sickbed with a box of chocolate eclairs wrapped in white ribbon. She was so small, a sliver of the moon about to disappear in the night sky, her soul fastened to life by a fragile thread, but she was so gentle when she took her big sister’s hand and whispered,
Draco is still watching Luna herd Hermione into the dining room, so he does not notice Daphne approaching him until she’s enveloped him in a tight hug. She is as warm as sunshine -
Malfoy looks away. ‘Don’t worry, Potter,’ he says, so quiet Harry almost misses it. ‘I don’t have anywhere to go anyways.’
, Daphne would say, rolling her eyes, but Harry knows better. He can recognise the way Stephen looks at Astoria. It is the same species of creature that inhabits Harry’s heart.
Harry pulls a folded-up piece of paper from his pocket and slides it over to them. ‘And what sort of product do you two offer that falls within this price range?’
‘Can I-’ starts Harry, but then his throat closes in on itself, because Draco’s thumb brushes the corner of his lips and,
Harry levels a look at her, but he can already feel his anger fizzle out. He’s pretty sure Robards paired him with Prentis to slow him down, but they actually work quite well together. Prentis might be a good foot smaller than everyone else, and she’s slow on the draw, but she’s got a mind sharper than half the department put together, and she knows how to keep Harry cool.
He knows Hermione has been folding sheets of bubble-wrap precautions around Harry nearly all their lives, but there is no keeping Harry from danger. There is only the waiting for him to return, the bandaging of his wounds and the counting of his bruises when he drags his beaten body back home. Draco has made a lifetime profession of it. He has moulded himself into the best shapes to catch Harry when he falls.
‘Let’s get some lovely tea on first,’ she says, rubbing Hermione’s arms comfortingly. ‘Yeah? Let’s do that.’
Harry complains about Teddy’s growing attitude and Prentis’s general smarminess while Draco keeps his fingertips splayed over the Anchor on Harry’s left forearm. He’s always been fascinated with them.
The last person he expects to see sitting on Narcissa’s settee, with her ankles neatly crossed neatly like she’s visiting royalty, is Pansy fucking Parkinson.
Harry watches him go, an awful feeling slithering about in his gut. He hears Draco’s voice echo in his ears, sad and resigned.
There is a light squeak as Draco turns off the tap. He turns his head slightly, his lip brushing against Harry’s forehead. ‘Tell me about your day, Harry,’ he says, light and teasing like it’s an old inside joke.
‘Thank you,’ he says, looking up at the lawyer. The taut wire of tension in his shoulders eases off somewhat. ‘This is incredibly helpful.’
Hermione glances at Ron, who shrugs. Since the battle of Hogwarts, they’ve more or less stopped considering Malfoy a threat. All three of them had witnessed the way Malfoy flung himself at Crabbe in an attempt to stop the fiendfyre. And they’d all seen the way he broke down at the sight of Harry’s limp body in Hagrid’s arms, the way he refused to stand with the other Death Eaters. And none of them would ever forget what he did for them in Malfoy Manor.
Harry puts the hamper down as Hermione paces up and down in front of the fireplace, chewing her lip anxiously. She stops, whirling around on her heel, and drags one hand through her hair.
Blaise holds Draco’s gaze for a beat, then nods once. He marks something down in his notebook. ‘Right,’ he says, a crease appearing between his eyebrows. ‘Do you know whether Lucius was the one who facilitated the theft of the Time-Turner from the Department of Mysteries?’
The anti-Apparition wards press in on Harry’s awareness as his magic soars outward, looking for any exit, any crack in the barriers. There are none.
According to Molly’s infinite wisdom, the best way to ease the aftermath of the trial is by force-feeding everyone until they’re too full to think about bad things. She invites every last member of her family - spouses and children - and, in a fit of pure genius or blind insanity, Blaise and Pansy. (Narcissa and Andromeda have tickets to see a musical, otherwise Molly would have invited them too.)
He comes to stand in front of Draco, bracing his hands against the counter so that he can lean forwards and kiss Draco on the cheek. Draco smiles, bringing his hand up to toy with the tassels of Harry’s hoodie, his gaze fastened on that small patch of skin beneath Harry’s neck, just above the curve of his collar.
Draco shuffles a little closer and takes Harry’s hands. His fingers don’t twitch anymore, not like they used to. His grasp is steady, and through it Harry feels his magic pool around them like an oasis. Harry wants to lean back into it and let it soothe all his jagged edges.
Narcissa shows off all the magical plants hanging around her bathroom, and all the potions Draco’s brewed for her hair and her arthritis. She presses Harry to try out all the taps, smiling serenely as he gawks at the jets of pink-and-lilac water.
‘But my hands are not clean,’ Pansy says, flipping her palms over. There are tiny, red half-moons peppered over the soft skin there, from where she dug her nails in too hard. ‘I have done so many terrible things to so many people. I was on the wrong side of the war. Everyone knows it.’
Harry makes an exasperated noise at the back of his throat. ‘The chocolate doesn’t mean - it’s not a romantic thing!’ he protests.
‘The answer is yes, Draco,’ he says hurriedly - almost frantically. ‘The answer will always be yes. It’s always been yes.’
There’s a soft, distant pop, and then footsteps treading over the carpeted floor of his living room, and then a quiet, sympathetic, ‘
His mother cannot find him a Healer that will take him. She is furious for him, but Draco cannot help but feel relief at the anger. He does not want to be forgiven. He does not want to forget - does not want anyone else to forget. But he
In truth, Harry has always been a bit terrified of what a pureblood witch like Narcissa might do with a wizarding apartment, whether it would end up looking as cold and grim as Malfoy Manor or Grimmauld Place. In a way, he’s always seen her the way he first saw her, when she appeared at Lucius’ side - tall, foreboding, silent, beautiful in a way that belongs in a museum, locked away behind the glass. Now, she looks softer somehow, framed by the bright summer sun filtering in through the living room.
‘Dump some whiskey or Bailey’s in it,’ Ginny replies. ‘I don’t care, just make it strong.’ She leans back in the chair and digs her fingers into her hair, dragging her fingernails against her scalp. ‘I can’t fucking believe this is happening.’
She gives Harry another reassuring pat on the back, stands up with a swish of her formal robes, and follows Malfoy down the corridor. Harry can hear her fussing even after they’ve rounded the corner out of sight. ‘Really, Malfoy, you should have someone take a look at that. I’ve been doing some light reading, and apparently curse damage can turn into a lifelong disability if you don’t treat it immediately-’
‘Male Weasley,’ she clarifies, jabbing a very pointy, very glossy fingernail in Ron’s direction. ‘Sorry I was a dick. The Weasley is Our King thing was very tacky. Also sorry for the general twattish behaviour and casual racism.’
‘Draco spares no expense for my comfort,’ Narcissa tells Harry. ‘He spends so much money. Money he should spend on himself. He’s such a good boy, Mr. Potter. My Draco always says the Malfoy money isn’t his, so he may as well spend it on me here. He spends it so that I never feel afraid or alone. I love him more than anything.’ Then, she looks Harry straight in the eye, and enunciates each syllable with precise care. ‘Do you understand, Mr. Potter?’
‘We’ve had this discussion - spells don’t work on my hair,’ Harry sighs, gesturing at the untameable mane growing on his head. ‘It’s either potions or doing it the Muggle way.’
Harry feels a rush of sympathy for that small girl with the haunting eyes, of having a death sentence handed to you before you had even tasted life. He’s never lost anyone to the slow decay of disease. They were taken swiftly, brutally - he can't imagine mourning someone he loves while they’re still breathing.
‘Draco Malfoy has not shown up to his place of work in a week,’ Proudfoot says, 'and there are signs that he left in a hurry. We also have a lead that the dangerous Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy, is in Brussels. They may be working together.’
that Harry wonders if he’s fallen into an alternate universe where there was never an army of bigots in fancy dress killing people.
Neville’s grip is an iron vice, but Harry barely feels it. His mouth is sandpaper dry. He hears the whip-crack of curses ricocheting off stone, the rumble of walls collapsing like distant thunder, the screams of people trapped under rubble, the stink of blood and burnt flesh.
Malfoy rolls his eyes, but lets Harry order him an overly festive hot chocolate anyways. He pays for the both of them, expertly leafing through the coloured banknotes as though he never pranced around school hissing slurs at Muggle-born students. In his cable knit sweater and worn-out jeans, he looks like one of them. He talks like them too, ordering smoothly and flashing the staff a courteous smile before picking up the little sign with their table number. He even gets up to grab their drinks, but Harry waves him off, nodding pointedly at Malfoy’s hands.
Draco rewards his cheek with a smack against his upper arm. Even with Draco lying flat on his back and with no leverage, his hand lands on Harry’s arm with a solid
The double doors to the ballroom burst open with a loud bang. Several witches and wizards come storming through, dressed in leathers in boots, wands at the ready as though preparing for battle against an army. A few guests scream as they hurry out of the way. The music screeches to a halt, members of the quartet rising out of their seat, instruments held awkwardly in their hands as they watch the Aurors advance.
Angel frowns at the scribbled figures on the paper while his brother peers over his shoulder at Harry’s near illegible writing. ‘There’s only one thing that matches this figure in our catalogue,’ he says, glancing up at Harry. ‘That would be the Lopez Panic Room.’
The apartment opens with a tap of Harry’s wand, and he waves the door shut behind him with his hand. The wards kick in and the apartment comes alive, spells activating as soon as Harry’s feet step over the threshold. The fireplace roars to life, and all the lights wink on. Harry sets his suitcase down by the door, hangs up his coat, and toes off his shoes, as he’s done in each of Draco’s homes countless times.
But if you never knew the life behind those marks, you would also see the way he lives in his skin - the way he inclines his head, the way he smiles, bright and fresh like a January sunrise, the way his jokes are always biting but never hurtful, the way his gaze grows focused whenever he listens to someone, the way he always opens the door for little old ladies, the way he gets all soft and teary-eyed when he sees a kitten.
‘Oh, absolutely not,’ Ron says, pushing Harry back into the chair with a considerable amount of strength. ‘I’m going to Transfigure you a cot, and you are going to get at least two hours of sleep.’ He narrows his eyes. ‘Or.
It always rains in this city, so they get caught in a downpour, but as they huddle beneath the shade of a tree, a busker on the steps of a nearby church starts playing the soft refrains of Bach on her cello. Harry glances at Draco, noting the way the droplets of water slide down from his cheekbones to his jaw, and suppresses the urge to kiss him.
Or maybe Robards was just like the rest of the people who saw something in Harry that needed to be stamped out, eviscerated, destroyed, beaten down and buried under rubble. After all, Robards was putting Harry on suicide missions long before Lucius ever got out on parole.
Draco halts in his steps, and Harry stops alongside him. Harry scrubs his hand through his hair, taking a deep breath as he draws together the right words.
‘She cares,’ Draco murmurs. ‘She cares so much.’ He glances up and gives his head a little shake, and the corner of his mouth twists downward. ‘I mean,’ he says, ‘of course she cares. I know she cares. She’s my friend. But-’
‘You aren’t something to be put up with, Harry,’ Draco says. ‘And even if you are a little fucked up, you still deserve to be loved.’
Daphne squeezes her eyes shut and leans back against the plush backing of her seat. She presses her fingertips into her temples. ‘I feel violated.’
Blaise closes his notebook and taps it against the flat of his palm. ‘Potter’s explanation checks out,’ he says. I’m going to have to confirm with other sources, but it appears that the Time-Turner you were working on was never going to be successful.’
Ginny opens her mouth to argue, but Draco is now within earshot. He drops inelegantly onto the grass between them, and by some miracle, does not spill a drop from the open bottle of champagne.
Astoria sinks into the closest chair and sighs. ‘Will someone explain to me what is going on?’ she demands.
Harry makes a loud noise of protest because while he might not be very tall, he’s also certainly not a
‘Speaking of,’ Neville says, turning to address Harry. ‘McGonagall’s giving you the rest of the year off on leave. She reckons you’ll be tied up with the Malfoy case for a while. I’ve already told her I’m taking over your classes and oversee your exams.’
Acquafredda frowns as inspects the record. He lifts his hand to his neck, where his familiar is curled beneath the fold of his shirt collar. ‘
deep into the roots of his soul. Draco’s mouth is like sweetwater and Harry drinks him in. Draco’s fingers are like gentle rain as they track down Harry’s spine, his grasp like the tug of the tide pulling out to sea, and Harry follows him into a sprawl across the rug. He hasn’t known how much a person could yearn for someone until he presses his lips into Draco’s neck and hears the soft, broken exclamation torn from Draco’s throat. But kissing Draco’s neck means not kissing his mouth, so Harry groans in mourning as he kisses Draco again and again and again until they are both trembling.
This place is bursting from the seams with the amount of love that Narcissa has for Draco. There are photographs of him everywhere, and a painting hangs above Narcissa’s bed of a tiny blonde baby with familiar silver eyes, holding a felt rabbit in his pudgy hands. There is a magical photograph of Draco sitting on the bedside table. He’s standing next to an enormous statue of a mussel, and every so often he tips his head back and laughs uproariously. Harry recognizes it as a photograph he took on their trip to Zeeland, back in their early twenties. He recalls telling Draco
Harry manages a smile, and he takes another gulp of his tea. Pansy takes a macaron and shoves it in her mouth.
I see your Anchors,’ Daphne informs him, which is as close to a compromise as she’s going to get. She raises her eyebrows and nods pointedly at his forearms.
‘George made my drinks,’ Draco replies, and sways into Harry slightly. ‘You smell divine,’ he mumbles.
‘You know,’ Draco muses, drawing Harry’s attention back towards him once more, ‘it might be that you got a little too close to the truth. The Selwyns have donated very generously to the Ministry restructure since the trials.’ He glances up at Harry, his eyes nearly glowing in the bar’s low light. ‘My father certainly employed similar tactics to keep the Ministry off his back after the first war. I’m sure he’s moving around his assets right now in an attempt to gain favour with just the right people to grant him parole.’
What the hell is that supposed to mean anyways? What could Ginny possibly be unhappy about? He’s worked hard for this position. He stuck through three years of training, of being yelled at and sneered at and learning how to wandlessly conjure fire in a fucking swamp being devoured by gnats, but hey, it’s all fine to just up and quit something he’s finally good at, right? Is he supposed to be playing Quidditch because it’s what
Neville leans easily across the space between them and bumps his knuckles into Harry’s shoulder playfully. ‘Aw, piss off, you old sap,’ he says fondly. ‘Oh, speaking of significant others,’ he says, and jerks his chin towards the forest.
Lucius flies back against the wall. The mortar cracks from the impact, his body making a satisfying crunch before he slides to the floor, unconscious.
(it’s a sparrow and it sits at the very base of his spine, flying up from the waistband of his pants, and Draco
Hermione’s keen eye sees the notebook, the nondescript clothing, and then the stack of papers on Harry’s kitchen table - Harry can see the cogs in Hermione’s brain turning as the pieces slot into place.
The only time Draco gets serious about it is when they’re in Andromeda’s garden, watching Teddy fly on his first practice broom on a hot summer’s afternoon. Harry runs feverishly warm these days, his magic thundering in his veins. At some point the heat gets too much for him and he peels his shirt off his sweat-soaked back. It’s only when he notices Draco staring at him that he remembers - he’s got so many scars these days that his dark skin is latticed with silver and pink lines.
Harry hesitates - he looks down at his boots, sparkling clean, and remembers when they weren’t. He remembers scrubbing his hands in the hospital showers, remembers the sleepless nights staring at the monitoring spells hovering over Draco’s quiet body. He thinks about the agony of unsaid words, and how small the sting of rejection feels in comparison to that.
’ she says incredulously. ‘You’re Harry fucking Potter. You can Apparate along ley lines. You had such a high case rate when you were an Auror that you broke the record. And even if you weren’t Boy Wonder, Potter,’ she adds, shaking her head, ‘you two are locked in an orbit that not even the Dark Lord could break. You were made to find each other. To be together.’
Kingsley looks deeply annoyed at being ordered around by a Malfoy, of all people, but he sets his now-empty glass down on the desk and pulls his wand from his pocket. ‘Alright,’ he says. ‘Please come here, Harry.’
Harry doesn’t tell her that he’s drinking heavily every other night just to knock himself into a state of blurry bliss that nearly resembles sleep. He doesn’t tell her that, in those long sleepless nights, his mind churns away with awful images of the victims he’s seen, the ones he can’t rescue, doesn’t tell her that even days after a duel, he can still hear the crack of hexes echoing in his mind like bolts of lightning striking the earth.
He wants to sit here, in this coffee shop with its sticky tables and terrible lighting, and he wants to look at Malfoy. Malfoy, who cracks jokes about death and torture, who likes to drink chai lattes and works in a Muggle bookshop, who dresses in loose sweaters and rolls his jeans up at the cuffs, who is soft and strange and new and hopeful.
There’s eggs and bacon waiting for them on the table by the time they reach the kitchen. Teddy watches them steadily as they sit down opposite him. He takes a long sip from the fantastically ugly mug Victoire gifted him on his fifteenth birthday -
Harry gets a letter from one Senior Auror Marsters in response to his request, that very same evening.
Harry will never tell him whose magical signature he chose. That would be too much like a confession, and Harry’s not quite sure he’s ready for that.
He takes a breath and releases it slowly through his nose. ‘How do you and Ginny figure out the long-distance thing?’ he asks.
‘You might have a warrant for an arrest, Elmer Smythe,’ Astoria says, each word a barbed sting into the Auror’s side, ‘but I see no evidence of a warrant to search for the symbol of ownership of the Elder Wand. Because that is what you’re really looking for, isn’t it? Ownership of Harry’s wand means ownership of the Deathly Hallow’
Sometimes he wishes that this was real. Sometimes he even believes that it is real, especially when they sit around a table at a restaurant and the waitress tells Teddy that he’s lucky to have such handsome fathers, and when he looks up at Draco, he’s smiling back at Harry with such
The first few weeks off the potions were the worst. Draco kept having awful night-terrors and high fevers as his body - his magic - tried to fight against his terror. Harry couldn’t bear to let Draco suffer on his own. He stayed over every night, pressing cold towels against Draco’s brow, and watching helplessly as his friend curled into a tiny, protective ball, whimpering and weeping, locked in the nightmare with no escape.
Harry closes his eyes as his fingers clutch at the front of Draco’s robes. He is suddenly aware of the stiffness in his muscles, the cramping of his toes in his ill-fitting shoes. There are words he wants to say, promises he wishes to renew - but the exhaustion folds over him like a dark hood, and he sways, his voice dying in his throat.
On sleepless nights, Harry finds himself returning to the letter. He unfolds it carefully and reads it at the kitchen table by the light of his wand, so as not to wake Ginny. It is the thing that comforts him when he wakes, trembling and sweating, from his worst nightmares - when all he can hear is that cold laughter and his mother’s scream.
A horrible, impossible groan sounds through the very centre of the world. Harry comes alive, fear flooding his veins with sharp, prickly adrenaline.
He stands by the little iron gate and watches the loveliness of the light coming from the windows spilling out over the bushes of lavender that grow in the small garden. The stone path curves slightly as it leads from the gate to the front door, and Harry’s boots click over the wet tiles as he walks through the garden. Tomorrow morning, the bushes of honeysuckle and wood anemone will come alive with bees and butterflies. For now, the garden is silent. The perfume of wildflowers drifts gently over Harry as he climbs the three steps up to Draco’s front door. The doorknob is shaped like a starburst, the metal cold to the touch.
Harry’s stomach does a swan dive into his feet. ‘Alright,’ he says, trying not to sound too defeated. ‘Maybe some other time.’
Realisation slams into Harry like a punch to the gut. Narcissa’s been trying to tell him where Draco was this whole time - and Harry’s been completely oblivious to it. Harry hates himself so much he wants to rip his stomach from behind his teeth and set it on fire. He wants to tear off his skin and throw himself off Narcissa’s lovely balcony.
‘What did they say to you?’ Harry asks, surprised at how calm he sounds. Rage simmers in his gut, as familiar as an old friend. ‘The Aurors who interrogated you.’
They take a walk together afterwards by the duck pond to walk off the effects of Molly’s overfeeding. Malfoy points out the constellations for Narcissa, Andromeda, Remus and Sirius. Harry points out the shimmering stars that form Malfoy’s namesake, which makes Malfoy stare at him long and hard like he’s trying to figure out a puzzle.
Draco’s face is cast half in shadow, half in the light that reaches out towards them from the tent and its lively occupants. The music is distant and distorted by the space and the gentle night breeze, but Harry recognizes the strains of a familiar jig.
Draco laughs softly, and sighs. ‘It’s fine, Harry,’ he says. His fingers draw mindless patterns over Harry’s skin. ‘My Healer said I was fully recovered. You won’t hurt me.
‘You should really think about acquiring a survival instinct,’ he drawls, when Harry gets hit across the chest with a severing curse. ‘I hear they’re on offer down at Flourish & Blotts.’
- and wears beautiful suits and always has flowers pinned to his lapel. He laughs a lot and he smiles freely, and sometimes he likes to hum along to the wireless as he cooks.
. One month ago, all he had were memories and an aching, a longing. But here, in the dark, he can see their past and their future stretching out to either side, endless and wonderful - and it is almost
The dishes wash themselves in the sink, piled high from the elaborate dinner Teddy insisted on cooking for them. Apparently, he felt guilty for not being around for ‘Aunt Pansy’s epic meltdown’ and wanted to make it up to Harry and Draco. Harry’s not sure who Teddy inherited his impulsive desire to cook from, but it probably has something to do with him being sorted into Hufflepuff and living so close to the kitchens.
‘Of course.’ Harry’s never forgotten that night in the tall grass, the wildflowers swaying in the wind, the thrum of the ley lines deep beneath him, and the sweetwater whisper of Draco’s magic.
Draco is torn between sunrise-bright love and ugly guilt. He teeters towards the latter. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says. ‘I’m sorry. I know we had plans-’
The oldest member of the Wizengamot leans down beyond his bench, lifting his spectacles from his face so that he can peer down at Andromeda. ‘Good afternoon, Mrs. Tonks,’ he greets politely. ‘Are you going to talk to us about your nephew’s character?’
The Unspeakable pulls his wand from the hidden sheath in the sleeve of his shirt. He gives Harry a small nod.
‘But- but I want that to be different from now on,’ Harry insists. ‘I’d look after you forever if you’d let me. Make you as happy as you deserve to be. Is that- would that be alright?’ he asks. He leans his weight onto the backs of his heels and clasps his hands behind his head, nervous enough to run a few laps around the property. ‘I know I’m a bit rubbish at it.’
Draco’s smile falls from his face as he pales visibly. The glossy magazine drops out of his hands and into his lap with a soft
Draco smooths the wrinkles on his hospital gown with the air of a man adjusting his finely tailored robes. It is devastatingly endearing. ‘Yes. Brussels.’
They’re having tea in the conservatory one sunny Autumn day, when Malfoy’s potion wears off and his hands start shaking so violently, he has to give up on his tea. Harry hates the way Malfoy’s expression changes, the way his eyes shutter and his body curls in on itself, as though remembering the agony of the curses that left such lasting damage.
Harry, as always, is underdressed. He’s wearing an old Weird Sisters t-shirt, a pair of jeans that he might have worn while fixing up Grimmauld Place, and his dragonhide boots (Ginny and Hermione conspired to throw away his favourite trainers and now he has nothing except wizarding shoes).
Draco spins Hermione around with a clever flick of the wrist, and she ducks under his arm, breathless from joyous laughter.
It’s too late by any measure of polite society to call on Narcissa, so Harry wanders aimlessly through the streets of Paris, lost to reminiscing.
Harry remembers the rain coming down in icy sheets, of rain-darkened hair flattened against Draco’s pale skin, the small indentation next to his mouth that appears only when he smirks, the translucent-starshine colour of his eye, the gasp of warmth of Draco’s fingers wrapped around Harry’s wrist as they run for cover. And then he remembers sitting beside the fireplace in the Cornwall house, Draco’s weight as much an anchor as the ink and magic branded into Harry’s skin, the murmured words, the taste of merlot, the smell of lavender, and the slow ember of Harry’s desire glowing within his rib-cage, just adjacent to his heart.
