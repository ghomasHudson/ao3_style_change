“Fuck you. It’s not like you are giving me a choice.” But Draco had to agree, because he couldn’t do anything else. “How are we even finding Potter when you have no idea of where he is?”
The man, thought, mistook his words and prodded “Longbottom’s friends were responsible for his death, after all, so this is the perfect occasion for payback, in Stephen’s memory”.
He could hear people in the corridor, voices lost in the tumult of the battle. The sound of an explosion echoed trough the walls, shaking the stone structure like it was a castle made of cards. Like it could break and collapse at any point.
“Where is Theo?”
He was early, so he nearly collided with the Headmistress, who was leaving her office.
“How curious,” Lupin mused. “Memory incantations are always complex. The memories are still there, just under many shields.”
He grabbed the younger wizard’s arm and apparated them away.
“Maybe you need to go back, if you can’t even transfigure a bowl”. And maybe being young wasn’t so bad, he thought, trowing some pebbles in the water.
“Luna”, she corrected.
“Remember, it might take big actions to win a war, but it’s the small ones that keep the spirits high”. She declared sagely, passing him a sugar quill. She was happily flipping trough the book on Magical Beasts he had bought her, her nose almost touching the pages. It was a rare edition on the lost and mythical species of the Northern Sea and Draco believed some were almost as absurd as Freshwater Plimplies. Needless to say, she looked completely engrossed over a picture of a something that looked like a cross between a toad and a musky rock. The table they shared with Longbottom, Thomas and the female counterpart of Weasley was scattered with the gainings of their earlier plunder at Honeydukes. Draco sucked on his quill and look at a spot a few tables away, sighing.
Everybody laughed, but Draco only stared. He had just strangely noticed how full Potter’s lips looked, even when he smiled.
“Is it true, Draco?” Pansy voice murmured from behind. “Are they here?”.
Despite Sirius’ glare had almost been enough to set the entire pile on fire, the matter of Voldemort return had taken priority over everything, so that anyone from the Department of Magical Artefacts and Regulations had yet to come and collect it. To this day, the objects still lay scattered across the cold tiles.
“No, that’s the entire point. Nobody knows. . . Well, except for Theo”. He realised he was tired of the whole situation, of being afraid when there wasn’t anything but himself to face.
I am alive! So sorry, but this year has been crazy and I couldn’t find the time and the words. The story is all written in my mind, but unfortunately from there to actually being written is quite the difference. But, anyhow, your lovely comments prompted me to get my act together and hopefully this is okay.
“Ha- Evan. I might not know you well -“, not as well as I’d like “but I am sure that whatever you put your mind to, you’ll do just fine. Better than that, you’ll do great”.
“No! Seriously, Malfoy, what’s wrong with you?”
“Let’s just get it done” Draco growled.
“Oh, please Po-Harry, let me take a picture of that martyr look. The Prophet is going to have a field day with an image of their agonizing hero”. He pleaded.
Oh the shore, just a few metres away, a familiar pair of ginger and black heads was walking in their direction.
“Ah, young love” Blaise voice observed, like he was 100 years old. They turned to greet their friend, who was fumbling with the knot of his tie.
Everybody was still looking at him “So, the conclusion of this lengthy monologue is don’t be an idiot and respect and listen to the ones around you” he hurried, waving a hand in dismissal. There was a pregnant pause before someone started clapping. Soon the sound became louder and Draco breathed in relief. The Headmistress smiled at him.
It was well into the night when people started coming back to the Manor. Draco had barely moved from his position in front of the window, his right hand resting on the diamond-paned glass, relishing the cold feeling against his palm. The numbing ache in his fingertips kept him grounded, a gentle throb that anchored him to reality, and for a long time he had tried to concentrate on that sensation alone. It wouldn’t do to think of what was happening, not while there was still hope. In his left hand, resting along his body, was his wand. There was nothing he could do but its presence was comforting. His index finger was involuntary tapping against the smooth wood, the only movement in his otherwise still body. His eyes were trained on the property gate, and he must had forgotten how to blink because they felt dry and painful. Tired, but he wanted to know. Needed to know. From inside he couldn’t hear the telltale “pop” of apparition, so when a body suddenly materialised in the driveway he shot an involuntary stream of wild magic that left a nasty burn stain on the lush carpet. Even without the silver mask he wouldn’t have been able to make out the features of the person in the distance. The figure stood still, waiting, and soon others appeared in the proximities. They were moving now, agitated and when one of the hoods fell backwards Draco recognised the wild hair. Bellatrix. His aunt was pacing around, hands gesticulating frantically, in what looked like rage. His body trembled in trepidation. A dark cloud of smoke surged trough the sky and Lord Voldemort’s scream of fury held all the answers Draco had been waiting for. Potter was alive. That night not even the wails of pain coming from the dungeons could dim the little ray of hope that was warming his heart.
He wasn’t deluded to believe that Muggles didn’t look human, exactly like wizards and witches did, at least aesthetically. He could even admit that some of them were beautiful, from what he had glimpsed before in the rare occasions he had wondered into their territory. But what was beauty without power, his father would say. What was life without magic? He had realised that he didn’t know much about Muggles, but he was aware that they somehow had their ways to be happy, to find their reasons to live. To find their “magic”. And in those exquisite afternoons, in the little spot just meters into the forest where the sun rays could still find him between the thickening trees, Draco believed in that magic of life that he and the Muggles shared. In a magic that wasn’t about power, glory or dominance, but was wild and untameable and wonderful. He was raised to seek control. Now, he was growing to appreciate the feeling of relinquishing and letting it be. Yes, in those autumnal days Draco could almost convince himself to be just that, a carefree young man, happy to be alive in such a beautiful world.
Later on, much later, he would tell himself it was fate that had led him to the rashest decision of his life. Anything to quell the doubts and guilt weighing heavily in his chest.
He had left Potter with a broken nose, hidden under what appeared to have been a surprisingly powerful invisibility cloak.
With that assurance in mind, he soared towards the unknown, hoping that for once things were going to work out. When his lips met Harry’s midair, the future tasted of pumpkin juice and promises, and Draco was flying.
His gaze, once again, roamed subtly over the boy on the floor. He doubted that the recent healthy glow and tanned freckles that had taken the place of the underfed and skittish orphan would go completely amiss between the hormone-fuelled walls of Hogwarts, fame or not. He had never before stopped to consider if Potter was attractive, his irritating personality enough to overshadow everything else. Evan James, though, had a lean waist, long legs and the loveliest eyes Draco had ever seen. It felt only marginally better to think of Potter as someone else.
“Uh. . . Wha — really?”
Draco’s mouth curved in a slight, victorious smirk.
“No - No, it just reminded me of this absolute ginger tosser at school named Ron, that’s all. It’s a strange name for a cat.”
Draco would later affirm he could pinpoint with precise finality the moment understanding started creeping onto Snape’s features, the same horror reflected into his own eyes.
It had felt like the foulest sin to pick it up and pocket it swiftly whilst the house was preoccupied with Harry’s disappearance. Sirius’ words resounded sharp in his mind, accusations of betrayal. Vile! Nasty! Wrong!
A woman around his mother’s age had emerged from behind a set of double doors, probably leading into the kitchen, and had now stopped midway, regarding him with curiosity.
“I, however, am not”. Blaise sounded indifferent but Draco knew that, to speak now, he must have been impressed.
“I am just checking, Theo” He tried to reassure him. On his way out he whispered to Blaise “Stay. Stay with him. Please”.
Draco had heard that Potter was in a safe place, probably with his muggle family, but the protection would vanish the day he was to become of age, on July 31st. In a week. Draco thought of his own birthday, the excitement of finally becoming an adult tampered by the events and the fear of what was to happen. He wondered if Potter was aware of the impending threat on what should have been a happy day in the life of a young wizard. He knew that the other boy was most likely prepared but couldn’t help wishing that Potter could still live the days up to his birthday with some sort of normal anticipation and joy. He used to be jealous of Potter but living in close quarters with the Dark Lord made him realise what a fool he had been. No fame was worth being the target of such darkness.
“About that…” The other wizard was writing, but Draco interrupted, quickly scribbling “Did you know he was gay?”
Than Macmillan said “Well, I think you were the last” and they resumed their discussion, giving a brief explanation of what they went into so far.
Still, he stalled.
Before he could think about it, another of the things that had been exchanged over the breakfast table, came out of Draco’s mouth with a glee he didn’t expect “Nothing to stop you, now that you are a free man”.
“I guess it’s just us, that are unable to get over ourselves” Daphne murmured. “It was her idea, Tori’s, to come back. She said she didn’t believe in blood purity anyway, and that this was our opportunity to show we are more than just Slytherins. . . What was it for you? Why did you come back, Draco?”
“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter” he heard his voice saying, stupidly.
They carried the body in silence to the Great Hall, were Finnegan saw them and came to help. He gave Draco a brief glance but nobody said anything. Draco let him take over and hovered by the door. It took him a while to notice Luna, who had stayed behind as well and was now staring at the line of bodies covering the middle of the Hall. He noticed a group of red heads and realised that one or more of the Weasley’s didn’t make it. Granger stood nearby with the youngest of the siblings, arms around each other, and Draco knew it wasn’t her Weasley.
On a last note, I confess I have been writing all of this fiction only to finally get to the point of writing this: A couple of hours later Draco was slouched on the sofa, Ron happily sleeping on his stomach.
The Professor gave her a curt nod and continued her lesson.
Merlin, he really needed to get laid.
Harry battered his worries away “It’s water under the bridge, Malfoy” He replied, keeping the formality “I know you were just jealous I was much cooler than you”
Draco had known it. Deep in his heart, he had known Luna was right. After all those years, he knew Potter, at least a little. And so did the Dark Lord. Voldemort had used the right words, and Potter, Harry, had gone to the forest. He had known it and still it was a shock.
Draco thought about the first time his mother had told him about death. He was four and playing by the pond in the garden, building a miniature castle with pebbles and dirt, while Narcissa read in the shade of the trees. The castle, like all castles that were worthy to be called so, needed pointy towers and flags, so Draco went to look for sticks in the nearby bushes. There, hidden by the foliage, was a swan. Draco knew that swans weren’t meant to be touched, his mother had said so many times. They might bite you, darling, she had chided gently. But it was so beautiful. And Draco touched it, and the swan didn’t bite. Its head fell to the side, in a weird angle, and Draco touched it again. And again. He poked it and the swan did not move. Then his mother came, and she hugged him and told him of things that sounded strange about falling asleep and moving on.
“It seems Potter’s ability to resist the Imperius was just a legend, or the boy truly was a rotten teacher if his little pets perform so poorly”.
“I agree with Dean” an amused voice said from behind and Granger came into view, followed by Potter and the two Weasleys. “Honestly, you guys, this is what’s wrong with the Wizarding World”.
“Yes.”
I was hoping to write Harry in this one but it was going to be too long, so I’m getting this out of the way first.
He thought he had lost them, for a moment, when he had turned a corner and they had suddenly vanished. The light bouncing oddly off the steps and the shift in the air had given away their poorly performed Disillusionment charms, although the one he casted on himself with his mother’s wand wasn’t much better. He was aware that only the chaos happening around them had made it possible to go trough the castle unnoticed.
“Suits me just fine, I arrived in the country yesterday and haven’t decided what to do yet”. We don’t need more than a month, anyway, he thought to himself.
Yes, they were alive, but barely. Draco clenched his teeth. What was Potter playing at! The Dark Lord had been furious when the boy had eluded him once more and Draco could only be thankful he was unimportant enough to be spared the worst of the rage.
Granger was alive. There had been so much blood. Red. But she was alive. There were alive. Luna. Potter. All of them.
“Lucky me!” Draco mumbled “I suppose this is the moment to make you aware of my lack of underwear and general clothing. No offence, but I am not planning to keep wearing Potter’s.”
Draco, who had been listening incredulously, put down the piece of toast he had been holding in the air for far too long. “As if that would be wise”, he commented, still dazed. It was not a possibility he had considered.
The Gryffindor seemed slightly intrigued, but Draco thought he could see a small amount of uncertainty.
He wanted to beg to call Granger, that he didn’t want any job or any burden or any Potter in his life. Wanted to ask who the fuck was Remus, and please what and why.
“To what do I owe the displeasure?”
Draco startled, eyes jumping back to attention from where they had once again strayed towards the food. He flushed and she smiled knowingly.
“And what is that, exactly?” Draco believed his given supply of energy designated to deal with this shit was getting perilously low.
Dumbledore sounded mildly impressed and Draco felt his confidence raising. “Right under your nose and you never realised!” He taunted.
Draco left.
He was older now, his mother long gone.
Was it possible for an inanimate object to look mocking? After hours spent staring blankly at the musty wall, Draco thought the answer was rather yes.
Then someone agreed, saying it would make things easier, and more and more voices gave their consent, drifting the conversation into other directions. Soon the table was buzzing again with chatter and laughter.
He easily grabbed the broom that the other boy tossed at him. Harry was smirking, and Draco wanted to kiss it away.
As winter approached, the temperature in the Slytherin Common room dropped considerably, but Draco didn’t mind. This year was different. It wasn’t uncomfortable, didn’t seep in his bones and his heart like the frosty embrace of loneliness, when your life is on the line and you are suspended between your past and a future that might never come, with nobody there to share the heat.
“No. No, I’ll be fine. . . Thank you. Thank you so much”.
“Well, that’s not entirely true. I think he travelled a bit, at the beginning. But Evan James wanted to go to California, and I have my reasons to believe he came back where he started. He settled by the coast, at least. And. . .I have something that can help us.”Lupin confessed, like he was already regretting it.
And, as Draco could testify from his favourable position dead centre in this ever so amusing game of piggy in the middle, neither did the Dark Lord.
He summoned a pair of black jeans and a white shirt from his bag, buttoning it high against his neck. It was a bit of an overkill but no Malfoy had ever faced the enemy in a t-shirt. He tittered at the thought of an amnesiac, semi-muggle Potter as the enemy. There was something exciting about the idea of approaching the other boy as a stranger, and Draco felt a little thrill at the possibilities. Part of him believed he and Potter were never meant to get along, their incompatibilities too deep to overcome, but he rather missed the time when the biggest of his worries was how to provoke the bespectacled idiot into losing his temper. Everything was easier, then, and Draco wanted that feeling back, even if it meant them being at each other’s throats at any given opportunity. The dimwitted Saviour did look entertaining in anger red and, regardless of the outcome, it wasn’t any day that one could have a second chance at meeting their childhood nemesis afresh. Maybe, this time around, he could even persuade Potter to shake his hand.
“Harry” Draco repeated.
“Yeah, as Terry said. I think we Hufflepuff are all here but I heard Nott and Zabini are arriving on the weekend”.
“When were you any younger than 80 years old, anyway?” Draco said, tilting his head to observe the other boy with mock interest. Theo sneered, and maybe his lips were a bit too thin to be beautiful.
Ketchup, aside from sticking to his fingers and at the corner of his mouth, turned out to be most definitely the food of the Gods. Draco ordered a large serving of fries drenched in it, before thinking that maybe Muggles life wouldn’t be so bad after all.
He paused, feeling immensely stupid. He wasn’t used to have to explain himself, but they were all waiting “I envision it as a place where people would want to sit around and talk and spend time. Something to nibble on would —“ He tried.
Longbottom dragged the girl a few meters away and they discussed animately for a few minutes. When they approached him again Weasley looked resigned and wary, and Longbottom was clutching a little black pouch. He opened it in front of Draco’s face and he saw something shiny and round.
Obviously they had their ups and down, like everybody else. Little obstacles in the everyday life they were building as a couple. Sometimes big obstacles.
“That.” It came after a beat, but something told him that this wasn’t exactly something Lupin had been unaware of. How disappointing.
“It was truly a lovely place” he replied, willing his smile not to slip at yet another jab at his conscience, “but, H-Evan, all your parents ever wanted, in spite of fancy boarding schools and expensive things, was for you to be happy.”
A hand tapped gently on his knee. Draco knew he must have looked a fright when he turned to face the elderly lady sitting next to him, his eyes wild and his split lip sucked in between his teeth.
She must have been pushing fifty, he guessed, but her skin was smooth and tanned, taking years away from her appearance. Her outfit echoed the colours of the shop entrance, deep green summer dress, ending in a turquoise bow around her collarbone, and a lightweight mustard cardigan. Two top-hat shaped pendants sparkled at her ears. Again, Draco was brought back to Hogwarts and left wondering if this was what Potter’s loony friend Lovegood would look like in 30 or so years. Maybe it was this aching familiarity with the world he left behind, so different from the concrete and plain angles of the Muggle one, that had pushed him to enter the little shop in the first place, and nothing to do with Potter at all.
There was no way, however, that Harry’s wouldn’t freak out at his incontrollable bursts of magic. What could have passed for tricks of an active imagination as a child, would definitely raise some questions in his 16 years old mind.
Despite the pillow lines etched onto his face and the drowsiness from the early start, Harry had woken buzzing with energy. Breakfast had been filled with nonsensical blabbering and growing bucket lists of things that simply needed to be done.
He almost laughed at the image his mind evoked of a Potter reluctantly sitting at a dinner table under the uncharitable scrutiny of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, jolting cat Ron in the process.
“Tracey too. . .” Said Daphne, quietly.
Thank you for reading all the same, let me know what you think if you feel like it.
Draco had made it out just in time to see Longbottom being set aflame, his head trapped inside the burning Sorting Hat. Longbottom, that had challenged Voldemort openly, to give the survivors that Hope Draco had come to understand the importance of. The sight of the fire had taken him back to the Room of Hidden Things. He had launched himself forward, without thinking. With him, many others.
His eyes widen with the implications. Hands against the glass like a child, Draco began to fall in love with things he had never allowed himself to notice before.
He gestured for Draco to follow and they moved past the cozy looking lounge, stopping in front of an open door. With a familiarity that must have come from a more than comfortable friendship, Draco watched as the Muggle poked his head through, hanging lazily with an arm around the frame.
For some reasons he had expected to be looking at the scene from Dumbledore’s eyes, although part of him already knew pensieves worked in a three dimensional plane. The older wizard was, in fact, sitting at his desk, and from his sunken cheeks, pale skin hanging off bones like ill fitting clothes, Draco realised the memory was quite recent. Probably a couple of months at most.
Before leaving, Lupin had told him he had to arrange for the Gryffindor’s snowy owl to be taken in by some Muggle Animal Trust or something along those lines, where she could live without attracting attention. It had entailed a lengthy sob story on how the owl accepted her fate graciously, after finding out it was to protect her human companion. Honestly, Draco thought it was utter bullshit, because not even Potter could be so universally lovable to deserve the compassion of a fucking owl. Draco’s personal owl, Agatha, had almost pecked his fingers off on more than one occasion.
He wanted to scoff, argue that Magic was indeed everything, if only to be contrary. Lupin cut him off, though, and stood up, heading for the kitchen.
Suddenly Weasley’s voice came from somewhere to their right, calling out to his friend.
Buttercups: childish memories (they are also yellow, so when George explains the charm we have yellow flowers meaning something light and free like childhood turning purple. Yellow and purple are the two colours of their shop. Ah, how my complicated mind works)
The smell of wet dog was the last thing he felt before he was pulled into the opposite direction, towards the dark hideout of one of the castle’s many alcoves.
The two wizards and one witch were becoming legends and Draco could understand why Longbottom said it gave people hope. The Carrows had been steadily losing the already unstable bit of power they held over the student body, and they were getting sloppy and nervous. The siblings punishments, already on the other side of legal, were becoming more violent and public. Draco had been afraid it wouldn’t be long before they let go of all pretences and go for the kill.
“I know I had reasons for not liking you” he drawled.
Longbottom, that without Luna and the Weasley girl, who didn’t returned from the holidays, was the last standing leader of their little guerrilla group must had feared the same as, not long into the term, he disappeared.
“Run, Draco” Snape’s voice said, again. He ran, further, while Snape fought Potter, but then he couldn’t go, he couldn’t leave and he turned to look. Potter had grown a fair lot in their sixth year, so he didn’t look small, compared to their professor. He stood, battered and proud, addressing Snape like an equal, despite the differences in experience and power. He saw the other man killing the Headmaster in cold blood and still there he was, knowing it wasn’t a balanced fight but trying anyway. For a moment, Draco thought Snape would kill him and he felt the grip on his wand become painful, not really knowing what he would do, feeling his body guided by instinct. The curse, however, never came. He saw Potter’s body twisting on the floor, green eyes wide in pain, and Snape shouting “No!”. He saw the professor’s fury, Potter still trying and being knocked over. Then a firm grip wrapped around his arm, and he was running again. Next thing he saw was the hall of the Manor, and his startled eyes fixing him from one of the mirrors, frozen in terror, and for a moment, they looked green.
“You are impossible! It’s not my fault your family has a thing for stupid names!” Lupin’s eyes were slits and Draco smirked.
“No? Because I am pretty sure that even at Eton they teach you how to ride a bike.” He quipped, referring to Draco’s morning embarrassment.
He sounded so affectionate that Draco spared a moment to wonder if the two were involved as more than friends, but then Potter directed his thumb towards the third boy with a cheeky grin.
Potter, who had clearly grabbed blindly for the first available one, flushed, his freckles darkening dangerously close to Weasel’s levels.
Instead Draco hunched his too thin shoulders and nodded in the direction of Vincent and Greg, a signal that they had things to do. Their responding grins made him sick, and he couldn’t decide if he was weak or just human.
“Theo. . .” Draco started, gritting his teeth. He was going to kill him.
Those were the first words they had exchanged after the meeting in the bathroom and it was surreal.
On the third day, the signs of distress now evident even in between the highest ranks, had made it clear that there was nothing standard going on.
He sounded excited and Draco knew the implications of being the ones to hand over Potter to the Dark Lord.
They parted ways at Draco’s stop, the Motel half visible at the end of the road. It looked even more pathetic in the daylight, and Potter gave him a sympathetic grimace before quipping “Are you completely certain you want to move out?”
“We are going to be living together.” He added, after a quick explanation. “Good thing the cat Weasel likes me better than the human one. He actually doesn’t seem too fond of Potty, funny enough. His words, not mine, before you express your doubts.”
“What?” Draco asked, flailing his arms around wildly “Because if it isn’t the biggest fucking dose of luck, I really can’t see how-“
Click.
“Yeah, you. In not such kind words. . . Over and over. . . for about six years, give or take.” The other wizard replied with a smirk.
Erm, what can I say. Enjoy it, and don’t have many expectations despite the title
“I never wanted Stephen to die” he said sadly, to his son or to nobody in particular.
“Oh yeah” Draco replied with mock casualty “Just fresh from my 17th party actually. I have to say, between my father's birthday wishes from prison and the impending matter of murdering the Headmaster, I made the most of it. Why, are you thinking of getting me a belated present?”
It took long after Theo left for his own bed for Draco to finally fall into a fitful sleep.
“And you think that aggressive attitude is the best way?” Draco asked in disbelief.
“He said you were alive. . . He said it, but I needed to see for myself. I was so scared”
One last day, to make all different choices from the ones of a child that didn’t know any better.
The train was emptier than ever before, and Draco wasn’t in denial. He knew that lots of student were sensible enough not to return. Hogwarts was’t welcoming for Mudbloods any longer, and most likely some of the other parents didn’t want to take a chance with their children’s safety. The somewhat tamed group of people on the platform, still significant but far from the chaos of the previous years, was telling enough. He had heard a few of the other students struggling with their parents, insisting to go, that they didn’t care, that it was their school. He had seen the supplication in the resigned faces of the older people, watching their children grow out of their protective arms, the pride for seeing them stand up for themselves mixed with terror and worry. Parents worried, like his mother, wanting to shelter their loved ones in the safety of home. His mother, though, was relieved to see him go, as their house was no shelter anymore, nor safe. But People didn’t know that, they believed all was good for him, and Draco could still feel the prickling of distrusting, maybe even hateful, eyes on his back while he walked down the carriage to find a free compartment.
“Draco” Urgent. An order, and Draco snapped out of it because at least he was good at following orders. He nodded, wary.
I’m on a roll, so I’m trying to squeeze as much writing as possible before I burn out again.
“What is this?” His father asked, while they both rose to face the group.
Dumbledore stood in front of him, dignified and poised even while looking like a drained old man. A year-long effort, coming to an end, whatever that was going to be. Did he have it in him? Draco knew the answer was no, and it felt strangely good, despite the implications. No, although, was not the right answer and Draco thought of his beautiful mother and tried to deny it. Tried to own to the task he so willingly and proudly and stupidity accepted what felt like a lifetime ago. He had to do it, this man in front of him, this wizard even the Dark Lord feared, looked like he was dying, anyway. He is a nutter, powerful but mad, and worthless and old, and honestly not looking too healthy, he chanted in his head. His mother wasn’t old, and she was worth it, Potter said it had to be worth it. And it was, but was it enough to murder? To take a life? He thought randomly of Potter’s mother. He had seen a picture of her, by chance, in his third year and to his surprise she was beautiful, too, like his mother, and so, so young. Her large, green and expressive eyes were so caring and loving, and mesmerised he had found himself thinking about what it would have been to lose someone like that. Unsettled, he had proceeded to taunt Potter about it. The thought was sickening, the love for his own mother twisting his insides with guilt. Lily Evans had died because it was worth it, would he be able to kill for the same reason?
“Mhmm.” She hummed, her focus shifting back to Scott “This is Dean, by the way. Scott, Dean. Dean, Scott.”
“Mhm, I understand.” He scratched his chin thoughtfully, cringing at the feeling of the days old stubble peppering his skin in patches. Ironically, he could never grow a proper beard. “And I think I can help”.
By the time he had collected the rest of his belongings from the moving line that appeared to be spitting luggage after luggage from a hole in the wall, his stomach was rumbling painfully for attention. Surprised that his bag had made it safely through two stops and what was no doubt the longest journey of his life, he followed the signs towards the exit.
His friend’s atonement of his sins irritated him.
When the last of the young students was sent to join the Ravenclaws, the Hat offered a few parting words “Think differently, accept different” and then fell silent again, collapsing on itself like a worn out rag.
“It’s not going to be exactly difficult to find employment with my name, is it?” The other wizard replied, somewhat bitterly. “To be fair, I am not sure what I want to do. We kind of discussed teaching. . .” He scratched the back of his neck shyly, and Draco found himself nodding encouragingly. “But yeah, I think I want to travel a bit. Take care of Teddy. . . See stuff, you know —“ He trailed off.
The Hufflepuff remained silent.
Sprawled on the floor, Draco noticed a black shape shifting into view until he was unexpectedly staring at the upside down face of Severus Snape. From that angle, his Professor’s nose appeared grotesquely enlarged, nostrils flaring with tension.
“Take two for good luck” She told him with a cheeky grin and Draco felt himself flush, obeying nonetheless.
The Headmaster didn’t sound surprised in the slightest and he looked right at him with a small smile
“Any news from your front?”
“It was lovely, receiving your wishes” she told her friends, with such sincerity it almost made sense that knowing they cared was all she had needed to make her captivity bearable.
Ignoring the insane urge to reach into the sleeping draught in front of him and lick it off his fingers, well aware it was on the poisonous shade of wrong, Draco had hopelessly tried to mend his mistakes, willing the potion to turn lilac or, at least, not red.
Draco patted his pocket at the confirmation, feeling the hard contours of the bottle against his fingers. “Why?”
Draco, that was thinking of choices and what would have been if he had chosen differently, if he had been like Snape, interrupted the babbling.
Draco scoffed “It’s not like he’d approved.” In fact, his father downright detested when he talked like a garden gnome. After starting Hogwarts he had taken moderate pleasure at cursing under his breath whenever Lucius had chastised him about his grades, feeling a rush of euphoria at the small act of rebellion.
“Oh, sod off Draco. You know what!”
“Yes,” Draco enunciated slowly “you know, the lavatory. Unless you rather me going right here, I am not in the mood of improving the furnitures”. He shrugged, wrinkling his nose at the stripy pattern of the old sofa.
“Yeah, they are stopping at the Burrow tomorrow to get Ron and Ginny and they should be here by Wednesday. . . It’s all very exciting”
“Something like that. We could say that I, too, had an unconventional childhood.”
“The Ministry has fallen.”
After a perfectly pleasant potato and courgette frittata, sadly with no ketchup, the unexpected chef asked if he would like to have a walk around the city.
“Pretty unbelievable, if you asked me. Arthur was what, 9? 10? Who in their right mind would give a child that young all those chores!” He scoffed, but something in Potter’s demeanour stopped him.
I am sure I wanted to add something so if you find something you want explained feel free to ask
The money was even enough to open a small bank account in Evan’s name, something to keep him going for a while. He had no doubts Harry would find a way to sustain himself; a lot of muggle kids travelled around the world for work experience, these days. In Evan’s mind, the account was a little inheritance left by his parents, to access when he came of age.
“Mother, I wasn’t a child” he rebounded bitterly.
“Stephen knew what he was doing” Theo’s tone was glacial and Draco saw the confused expression of the Death Eater. Before Amycus could understand that Theo didn’t wanted to do it, before the consequences of said revelation, Draco heard his own voice saying “I’ll do it”. Thirty heads turned in his direction. He felt his heart race, the cold trail of sweat on his neck. Better me than Theo.
His shoulder relaxed and he felt himself easing into a semblance of what could almost be called a good mood.
Draco stopped his perusal of the shelves for anything edible and yelped “What? Absolutely not! I think you need to think again when you are clearly not high on wolfsbane”.
Harry paid it no mind though, his eyes peering at his surroundings with indolent curiosity. Most of his focus was on the generous breakfast laid in front of him, cheeks plumping whilst his jaw worked through three days worth of starvation.
They stood there, facing the spiralling staircase for a long time, each lost in their own mind. Alone.
He looked at his parents, standing stiffly a little apart from the rest of the group, but there anyway.
“Do you still think you don’t deserve him? Because I can’t see any other reason not to tell him. . . That little speech you pulled got everybody sold on the Draco Malfoy’s deserve his redemption arc idea; Yet you act like you don’t believe in it yourself.” He prodded, lightly squeezing Draco’s forearm. It was a new peculiar habit of Theo, to seek contact when he was speaking. Draco knew it meant things were comfortable between them, and silently enjoyed how far their friendship had gotten. He sighed, roaming the selection of french delicacies in front of him for something that caught his fancy. He loved his breakfast sweet and had strategically sat by the tray of buttery pastries. It was only seven in the morning and the Great Hall was still mostly empty. Theo not only was a nagging shit but also an early riser, and not a very considerate one. Blaise had mumbled something from under the duvet that didn’t sound much like a declaration of affection. Draco, on the contrary, knew that once he was awake there weren’t many chances he would be able to get back into slumber. After considering the benefits of a early breakfast, he had opted to follow Theo into the Great Hall. It was pleasantly calm, just a few other students sparsely occupying the tables, and Draco could enjoy his breakfast in peace. Or so he had thought.
So, the quote Narcissa makes is from “Sill Life With Woodpecker”. Great book, so read it. Anyway, I remembered it and I think it fits my purposes so I used and twisted the origins a bit.
“Theo, what the fuck, it’s 4:30 in the morning”
“Whatever you need to sleep at night” Potter scoffed, and Draco’s wondered why he hadn’t hexed him yet, but still he found himself stalling. “Listen, whichever way we were thrown into this, some of us more willingly than others” The other wizard continued, looking pointedly at him and making his arm tremble “this thing is bigger than us. I am sixteen, I should be worrying about Quidditch and whatever else stupid teenagers do, but I am scared. And when I saw Ced. . .” his voice wobbled “People dying, I found out it was ok to be”
The knowledge that Potter was behind that flimsy wooden barrier, probably looking like the entitled speccy git he had always been, made Draco vibrate in anticipation. His hand raised on its own accord, as if to knock, but Scott quickly pulled another set of keys from his pocket and unceremoniously unlocked the door, already yelling “Honey, I am home!”, the “os” stretching ridiculously.
with my parents being divorced and my mum moving back to France -“ He stopped, blushing sheepishly at Draco’s annoyed expression.
Draco, that so far had spent most time quietly observing from the side, looked nervously at Daphne, who had moved closer. He searched for the other Slytherins but found the two Seventh years sitting with the artistic Hufflepuff boy he had discovered was called Tam, going trough his sketchbook.
This new version appeared not to have a care, and Draco’s traitorous mind thought that it suited him.
Lupin sat on the armchair opposite him, grey streaked hair and grey cardigan against grey fabric. He created an almost toneless image, like an old, time faded photograph, if not for the violently pink journal resting on his lap. Draco thought it better not to ask about that. Lupin’s wand was still trained on the journal’s pages but his long suffering expression told Draco that the other wizard must have been observing him quietly for a while.
He had always thought the Imperius to be the most lenient of the Unforgivables, almost not justifiable to be in the league with the Cruciatus and the Killing Curse. But Professor Achebe gave him a new perspective.
Some of the throng sniggered.
Draco stared helplessly into the pale, blank eyes, before closing them and tucking the boy’s wand safely in the internal pocket of the robes, just above his heart.
They were eight when the Weird Sisters had made it into the bronze collection of the chocolate frogs cards. When Theo had found the one with the picture of the Lead Guitarist of the band, just 17 and fresh out of Hogwarts, he had inspected it with a great deal of interest, before declaring, in front of Narcissa, that he was going to marry him. Draco, who had been looking at Kirley Duke’s smooth, shiny hair with a twinge of irritation, had replied that that wasn’t possible, as the guitarist was a man. They had argued until his mother’s intervention.
The year started with a very muted version of the Sorting Ceremony, far from the exciting occasion it used to be under the guide of Dumbledore. Even in the last years, when the Hat had sung about the uncertainty of the future and the dark times ahead, the student body was buzzing with excitement, stomachs growling at the anticipation of the sumptuous feast to come and little 11 years old hearts thumping with the hope to be sorted into that particular House. But this time the atmosphere felt suffocating and heavy.
Anyway, I am writing something else as well (a bit of self promotion 😏) with a much better title than this one. So, if you want, check it out!
“If anything like my mother, she would probably tell you you are going to catch a cold if you stay out in the rain”.
Also, I find that its hard to change your ways, to do something that has not been in your character so far, even once your mind is changing, so I hope this explains some of Draco’s actions. He is changing but it will take time to reflect in his behaviour.
“What are you doing here, Harry?” Draco asked again, seriously.
In the privacy of his uncharted house, for the first time in years Remus wept into his palms.
“Draco” Theo urged, hysterical. He was bouncing from foot to foot, eyes wild and hair sticking up on the side he had been sleeping on. He still had a crease mark on his cheek and Draco didn’t want to say anything. He wanted to tell him to go back to sleep, that all was fine.
Draco remembered thinking, that night on the tower, that the man in front of him was already dead. He remembered vaguely registering the signs of a dying body, his conscience gripping onto each and every one as an excuse to ease his guilt. The slight but incessant tremor in the limbs, the sickly gray tinge of the skin. And that hand, withered fingers just hanging loosely against Dumbledore’s thigh. But only now, up close, he could really see the damage and what he saw made his stomach churn. Dying, and it looked like there wasn’t much of that year left.
The portraits turned their head in sync to look at the newcomers. Draco noticed that the two belonging to the most recent Headmasters were hung directly behind McGonagall’s chair, Snape’s on the left. His frame was slightly smaller and less adorned, but the resemblance and accuracy of details of the picture were astounding. Dumbledore greeted them with a small smile, but the Potion Master ignored Potter in favour of giving Draco a scrutinising stare.
It was a container of some sort, probably hard plastic; it was honestly baffling the obsession Muggles seemed to have with the cheap material. On the front, it depicted a drawing of a blond boy with a ridiculous hairstyle and a pointy chin that definitely didn’t remind him of himself, holding onto the hilt of a sword. Draco observed the cover for a little longer, before turning it to read the synopsis, as he would have done with a book.
Pansy dug her nails further into the fabric of the sofa and turned away from him. “I’ve seen it happening to you too, Draco. People saying you shouldn’t be here, that you don’t deserve to. Those Ravenclaws last week. . . Fifth years! And you didn’t say anything. Why are you letting people treat you like this?”.
He couldn’t help the small flare of pride in his chest at the thought of the spells he had mastered during that wrecked year and hated himself for it.
Please, do let me know what you think about this 🙃
“No, I know he is. I told you about the amulet. I don’t often look but. . .  I’ve seen glimpses. I've seen the sea, an awful lot of it, and. . . Uhm” Lupin flushed slightly and wringed his fingers together “other things. He is alive.”
As if on cue, Theo sneezed.
Lupin righted his clothes and fished Draco’s belongings out of his pocket, unshrinking them in the process. The black luggage dropped to the ground with a thunk and Draco barely snatched his backpack from the air before it met the same fate. “As I said, piss!” He glared harder between the other wizard and the stained asphalt.
Having slept 10 hours on the plane he wasn’t tired in the slightest. He blinked up at the ceiling, grimacing at the spots of mold tattering the white paint.
A few notes on the chapter:
“He was a Muggleborn. He came back just for this, he really believed in Harry. Nobody noticed, you see. He was underage”.
I hope you like it, it’s not my best work but life has been hectic with lockdown number 3.
“We’re gonna be rewarded. We ’ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.” Vincent was saying to the Gryffindor, who looked tired and annoyed. He was trying to buy time, Draco could see that.
“Uh, me. . . Me too. Well, not idiocy, of course. . .” He waved a hand embarrassingly at himself to deliver his point, cringing at the awkwardness of the whole situation. Fuck Potter and his ability to take even being queer away from him.
“Hardly matters? And. . . What. The. Fuck?”
“We are still boys. And I, for once, want to live like one”
“I am sorry”. Lupin said again, and Draco felt there was an understanding there, a sort of kinship. Shitty birthdays were apparently a bonding experience, because his shoulders relaxed fractionally, some of the anger deflating. He considered the man in front of him, and he was suddenly hit with the realisation that Lupin wasn’t much older than him, if at all, when he had to live through the First War. He wasn’t really sure of the story there, but he had heard rumors of the friendship between his former Professor and the Potters. How many people had the other man lost? Lupin didn’t speak to him with pity, he spoke as a man that knew what it meant and didn’t wish it on anybody else.
Draco peeled it the rest of the way off the wall. Even with half of his face hidden, he could recognise the other boy clearly. Potter’s mouth was pulled into an embarrassed grin, his cheeks flushed pink and, although the picture was cut at bust level, from the hunch of his shoulder he was obviously standing with his hands in his pockets.
Anyway I might do a portrait view of all the characters in the same way, so if you have any you want to see let me know
So, when the time to go home came, Draco was always overwhelmed by contrasting feelings.
“Professor Achebe?”
“The world is huge.” He thought in wonder.
“Err. . . Right”.
They weren’t particularly tanned but they had a healthy glow to their cheeks. Draco wondered if Potter’s freckles were more noticeable. He was too far away to see. They looked healthier in general, if only a bit tired.
The hotdog looked both disgusting and the best thing he had ever held, and when the vendor had impatiently asked if he wanted ketchup Draco had agreed without thinking.
“That so?” The other man countered, showing a hint of teeth, but he didn’t press it further. “Well then, if you have everything packed -“.
He checked his options and, feeling out of depth, he decided to approach the closest establishment advertising food. He fumbled awkwardly with the Muggle currency that Lupin had exchanged for him. He had decided that the imminent bus ride, combined with three flights, was enough of daily first experiences for him to dare trying the plastic card his Professor said was somehow connected to his bank.
I’m sorry this is taking forever but I had zero to no time and this chapter just didn’t want to write itself. How rude.
All the attention was now focuses on him, people hanging onto his words. It felt powerful, but a different kind of power.
“I’ll teach you the spell. But, Draco, they are somewhat connected to triggers of magic, a failsafe of sort, if you wish. It doesn’t mean he will regain everything if he sees you using your wand in front of him, but it might bring some memories back. So, you need to be careful, at least until the end of July. I am not sure how long it will take you to find him, though, so you should prepare to leave soon”. And with that he was up and pacing the kitchen as if soon meant right there and then.
Guys, I am actually trying! 🥲
Please, forgive me.
His father pleading was interrupted by Greyback and he registered the two arguing in the background. He wanted to lie down and blend into the plush carpet.
He and Harry had been staying at his grandparents’ old place in Cardiff, a quaint two bedroom that was the only remaining link to his Muggle heritage. For once, Wizards’ complete disinterest for all things Muggle had played in his favour and he was certain that no one, or at least no one alive, knew about his property.
“Okay” the question, finally, came. Except it wasn’t a question at all.
The bed was a small double, covered in a thin blue sheet, roughly made but for a pillow hanging skewedly at one end. Muggle photographs of Potter and his friends were scattered across the walls.
I am starting to realise how long it actually takes to write down something that seems so simple in your mind.
He saw Longbottom approaching them from the front door, wearing an alarmed expression.
“Doesn’t sound too daft to me.”
She smiled, amused. “Good, good. Dean, here, has just arrived in the country. From England, of all places. Fresh start and all that, sound familiar? I think he could be the perfect candidate.” She addressed Scott expectantly.
“It would be only for a few months!”
“The vial!”
Let me know what you think, it really is a boost to receive your comments 🙃
“What took you so long?” She demanded.
The evening of the third found Draco sitting cross legged on the worn carpet of Lupin’s living room, back against the sofa and surrounded by papers and books. He rubbed the heels of his palms against his eyelids and tried to tune back in what must have been the hundredth delineation of Muggle’s customs for that evening alone, but his mind kept wandering adrift.
“British, uh?” She observed breezily. “What brings you - oh, do go on!”.
“The vial.”
With his mind still spinning, he wasn’t sure either of them even acknowledged the collision.
“Excuse me?”
Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the chapter. I don’t know why but I never considered Remus one to cry easily. I guess his life experience hardened him somehow in that instance.
Draco gestured at the open cut on the sleeve of Longbottom’s robe, where the curse had reached the skin. The fabric was soaked in blood.
Draco didn’t want to die, but most of all he didn’t want to live in regret.
Well, I tried to add an image but it didn’t work, so here is the link to DeviantArt
Draco squeezed her knee gently “You will find out that, to move forward, you first have to let go. And sometimes people will surprise you”.
“I just wonder how things would have been hadn’t she died. I know she wasn’t like my father, grandma would say it all the time. And I do remember her”.
“No. . . Yes, I mean. . . I think the Gardens are not only a place for the fallen but also for the ones that wish to remember them. I guess I just thought. . .”
He regarded the furry beast bearing his best friend's name with narrowed eyes, although there was no true heat behind them.
They could have.
“Goodbye”. Harry, “Good luck”.
He was still staring when someone was abruptly there, cradling Potter’s corpse in their lap. Draco felt the compulsion to shout “Get off him, get off”.
He finally spotted the queue for the check-in, Lupin’s voice in his head repeating for the umpteenth time what he was supposed to do.
As it was, after his feet collided with what appeared to be solid air, it had taken only a glance at the empty space in front of him to know. He had found him.
“Shall we choose four group leaders to pick the others?” An Hufflepuff girl suggested.
Potter startled, letting out an unintentional chuckle that sounded more like an hiccup. When he spoke, there was an almost teasing smile dancing on his lips.
“And you, Draco? Do you recognise her?”.
The other boy snorted skeptically “Sure.” His eyes flickered up towards the screen above them. “Oh, that’s my gate. I’d say it was a pleasure but not sure you would agree.” He added, standing up and adjusting his own bag over his shoulder.
“It’s rubbish. From what I gathered we would need to separate anyway to work with Professor Sprout, Flitwick and Slughorn on the different aspect of magic we need. It would make more sense to have groups based on skills, rather than on seats placement. Which, as you can clearly see, leaves us Slytherin left out”
The other boy looked at him in the eyes, serious and hard.
“Yeah, but you are a better friend now than you were a lover then. And it’s like when we were kids again, I missed it”.
And Draco didn’t know if they were still talking about the animals anymore. Or about her. Or, maybe, himself.
“No - definitely, no. I just worry, what if I am not able to fit in? To do it on my own?”
Snape averted his eyes, a flash of a long stewed guilt fleeting across his impassive scowl.
The Hat waited silently for the first trembling child to take a seat on the stool before appointing each one of the new students into their future House. It spoke the four names of the Founders loud and clear, with a tone of defiance odd for an inanimate object. A word for each child, said in a confident way as if challenging someone to object, and the meaning behind it was transparent to Draco’s ears. You are who you are, be proud, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. But also, be open.
Then someone repeated “Raspberries?”
Deep in his heart sat the knowledge that he wasn’t likely to survive the war. It was more resigned acceptance than a feeling. He was the last man standing of a group that did everything together, and his death seemed the only natural conclusion. The last step bringing a friendship stronger than life, stronger than the limits of human form, to full cycle.
Thank you, enjoy
So, a chapter at last! Yey for me!
Lupin didn’t reply, just turned and began lowering himself towards the shimmering mist.
But Longbottom eyed him curiously and put a firm hand on his companion’s arm. “Luna said you have changed”.
His mother placed a delicate hand at the base of his back, a barely there touch that spoke of love, of yearning for more.
“You are fixating on details! Who cares what-“
When the bucket was finally empty, she turned around to face him, and said “So you must not be dangerous” as a statement. As if it was a fact.
Because this Harry, this new Harry, wasn’t even Harry at all.
‘The night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself on to the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to, and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die. He is the only one that can do it, Severus”.
The rest of the day passed in a haze of snapshots, where all the in-betweens were lost to muscle memory and actions he couldn’t remember doing.
“For what?”
“Uhm, okay, great. Well, we. . . Never mind” The Gryffindor fumbled for words, apparently back to the old eloquence Draco was familiar with. “That is good, great. Not everybody is, you know. . .”
“No one was saying —“ tried the Gryffindor girl, looking scandalised, but Theo was on a mission.
There was no going back.
The inner part, enclosed in the symbolic embrace of mothers’ Love, would remain bare until the garden were finished. Weasley had said that the relatives of the victims needed a way to be involved as well, receiving a look from Granger similar to the one she gave him outside the Room of Hidden Things and bringing Draco to believe they were going to make out.
The manor, ever so imperious, became dark and oppressing, a looming structure over dying gardens. There was no time for pomp, during war. The Malfoy family had disappointed the Dark Lord in more than one way, and this was the punishment for their ineptitude. Even the air had changed. What Draco had always appreciated as a sweet chill in the summer heat, thanks to the thick stone walls, was now a a perpetual frostiness that seeped trough skin and settled deep in the bones, leaving him shivering most of the time.
The room was small and stuffy. The summer heat lingered stagnant in between the four walls, giving the air a murky smell. Draco casted all the cleaning spells he knew and opened the window, unconcerned of any of the dangers the receptionist might have been hinting at. Although he was aware of the complication of using magic against Muggles, he knew that entering the country via plane granted that his wand wasn’t traced. If the worst came to the worst, a few stinging hexes and memory charms could only aid to work out his pent up frustration.
Saxifrages: affection
“It won’t last” Blaise said, repeating Theo’s words “Boot was in our Potion group. He is way too boring for Potter”.
His second thought was that the speccy git wasn’t speccy any more. His awful round glasses were nowhere in sight, leaving his very green eyes unframed but for black, long lashes. A dusting of faint freckles covered the top of his cheeks and the bridge of his nose, with a couple of stray ones darker against his lips. Suddenly Draco had to look away, aware of just how long he had been staring in silence. It wasn’t like he could explain his lingering gaze with the truth. He was just taking in the changes a year had made to someone that used to be so familiar, but to the boys in the room he was just a stranger raking his eyes over one of them with perplexing interest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lupin winced at the last request, but Draco knew he couldn’t relent. He just had to make sure she was safe.
Draco shut the diary, finding that he wasn’t ready to answer that just yet. He had mixed emotions about the other man’s unexpected bouts of compassion, but it wouldn’t do him any good to dwell on why a rather simple question about his well being had reignited the now familiar ache of loneliness.
“Oh, sod off, you wanker. Anyway,” he said, turning his abnormally green eyes back to Draco “she is great!”
During the purging of Grimmauld Place, he and Sirius had come across the trinket, looking innocent among the cruelty collected by generations of Blacks. But Sirius had been disgusted.
He was about to make his tactical retreat to bed when he felt a looming presence behind him. Huffing, he tossed his toothbrush back in his toiletry bag and pulled on a soft grey t-shirt, leaving the bathroom knowing he was being followed. Only after they were shielded by the curtains of his four-posters the other boy spoke.
“Good,” said the Dark Lord. He drew  out his own wand and compared the lengths. To Draco’s horror Lucius made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive the other wizard’s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed and the Dark Lord’s eyes widened maliciously.
Dumbledore ignored the jab but his next words held so much pain that Draco froze “You have heard the prophecy, Severus. You must know, Harry is our only hope to end this war.”
And because today his voice seemed to have a mind of its own Draco said “Raspberries”.
“Do you think you can get this to Luna? Will she be able to hide it?”
Draco felt a surge of shame and wanted desperately to change the subject. “I didn’t picture you for a romantic, Potter. . . Love is the reason” he recited, with a grave voice “And do you think you have found a love like that? With Weasley?” As soon as he had said it he found he was oddly interested in the answer. He had seen the two of them joking with each other often during the two weeks in the castle.
“But seriously, Draco. Its okay to go for what you want” Theo was resolute again, but his voice was gentle. “And its ok to be scared. If you weren’t even a little bit scared it would mean it’s not important”.
“Uhm. I’m sure you don’t want to sleep in your school clothes, even with a cleaning charm and what not. . . But, well, I wasn’t really prepared and these- these were Harry’s” the other man sounded so uncomfortable that Draco almost laughed, as if anything about this fucked up situation was actually funny.
An image of Lily arguing with Snape flashed in front of Draco’s eyes. The sun rays danced gold on Potter’s face, giving his dark hair auburn reflections “You look a lot like —“
He stayed there, looking at Harry’s retreating back and long after he was gone. People passed around him in a busy blur and, in the chaos, he was invisible. So, he took his time, a steady breath after the other.
The school was getting ready.
Draco shook his head again, dazed.
Oh man writing is much harder than i was expecting. I have what i want to happen figured out but then putting it into words is a complete different matter. So kudos to all writers, you are amazing.
Neither.
“Oh my, what would Saint Potter think? Mind you, he gets off breaking the rules so this could make his wank library. I dare say, though, I’m impressed”.
His mother had talked about the events in the forest, briefly, like if it was something someone else had told her. Like if she was unsure of what had really happened, her mind too occupied on worrying about him. She had said Potter told her her son was alive, and she had believed him.
“What can I say, I am a keeper.” He didn’t really mean to say that, so he added quickly “Come on, those horses are not feeding themselves”
“But you like that, aye?” Theo rebounded with a knowing smirk
“He must be delusional” He muttered, unconvincingly.
Empty pockets, take off rings, check for metal.
Draco took a liking to the gardens, and in particular a secluded spot surrounded by raspberries bushes, far away from the gates and the stream of people coming and going. It was a wild little corner, where nature had been mostly left in charge of its own creation. The grass was slightly overgrown and the ground was dotter with spontaneous flowers, a sight so different from the rest of the gardens, almost maniacally kept in neatness and perfection. Here Draco could pretend to be somewhere else. The midsummer days were warm and bright and he enjoyed the feeling of the sun gently lifting the iciness from his bones. He had never before picked fruits directly from the source and he pondered on how bizarre it was that he became of age without once engaging in something so mundane and normal. He thought of the orchard, that stretched across the land behind the Manor, and the apples trees he so often walked between. Never, not once, had he reached his arm out to grab one of the shiny fruits, so inviting. Was he really so used to be served that the notion never occurred to him? Apples had always been brought to him at his  whim, cut in regular slices and presented on fine china plates by obliging elves. Draco found out he truly enjoyed the small pleasure of selecting a berry and gently plucking it from the bush. After a soft blow, he would push the fruit in his mouth, sucking lightly on his juice stained fingers, and let the bitter sweetness of the raspberry melt on his tongue. A ritual, slow and treasured. And for a moment he would forget everything that was wrong with the world. Sometimes exhaustion would take hold of his body and he would fall asleep in the cool shade of the bushes. It was there that Narcissa frequently found him, curled up like a child, and in those moments there was only a mother hope for her son to be safe. And maybe, one day, to be happy.
The bartender gave him a long, hard stare “Young man, it’s a start. But if you want to stay in my establishment, you’ll have to order a drink”.
“It’s in the curriculum, trust me!” Potter nodded along, with a solemn expression. It was only when Draco started to look unsure that he bursted out laughing again, supporting himself on the door frame.
Draco was starting to notice how he seemed to prefer smaller, almost uncomfortable, spaces, caging his body in between the furniture like he was used to blend into the background.
He looked apologetic, but Draco nodded. He needed some time on his own.
“What is it?”
He woke up murmuring “Sorry it had to be you, but I don’t wanna die.”
“We are playing hide and seek. It’s a muggle game. . .”
After 4 days he was totally engrossed in the project.
“Yeah, I killed him on that train and no one ever suspected me. A child, you say. And I- I left Potter choking on his own blood on that filthy carpet. I guess that cloak of his was more powerful than expected, because no one found the b- b- body”. Draco’s voice broke, begging for absolution.
Harry nodded around a mouth full of grapes, “Thanks, I mean it. I honestly have no idea where to start. I feel a little foolish, really, but. . . I don’t know. It has been my dream for a while.”
“I am not changing my fucking name.” Draco countered, matching the tone.
Potter was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the floor, pieces of what looked like a puzzle scattered all around him, but hastily scrambled to his feet as soon as he noticed the new visitor, grabbing a t-shirt from the nearby chair and pulling it over his head. Draco spotted a glint of the owl amulet before it disappeared under blue cotton.
Potter scratched his forehead absentmindedly “We all have marks that people define us by. Do you really want to do that to yourself, too? Live your life in regret, like them?”
“Some will”
His room had become his sanctuary and Draco would spend most of his free time between the familiar four walls, but dinner was an unavoidable experience. He dragged himself bitterly down the stairs and into the dining room. The long table, that felt ridiculously imposing when eating with his parents alone, was prepared for a feast, all but two seats taken. The rich dishes that covered the surface made him think of the banquet in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, but the occasion was far from the cheerful atmosphere of school. He sat to the right of his father, and they both avoided the other’s eyes. One used to stand tall and proud, his father had never lost the grey tinge and jitteriness of prison, and was now a nervous shell of the man Draco grew to worship.
You are taking away another person’s liberty, their control, she had said. Pain goes away, as much as it hurts in the moment, it will pass. Death is a different matter, because when you are taking a life there is no coming back, but it’s the people who loved the deceased the ones that will have to live with the consequences.
He came clean with Blaise about his preferences a few days before. The boy had raised his eyebrows, looking up from his book. “Do not mock my intellect, Draco” he had commented, before resuming his reading.
The green eyes widen slightly and in that quick second Draco thought the other wizard gave him an impercettibile nod. He barely had the time to register the absence of his wand that his mother was pulling him away, out of harm way, and Potter was gone.
The Gryffindor was already searching trough a glass doors cabinet full of vials, muttering under his breath. Draco moved his gaze away and back to his former Professor. He addressed him tentatively “I was hoping to view the memories. . . Sir”
Sure of what? The Ravenclaw was looking at Harry fondly, his cheeks pink. Draco was confused.
“I’m sorry” Lupin repeated, genuine. “But I had no other choice. You have something that I need.”
He heard a few snippets of conversation from a group of mostly Weasleys nearby.
Longbottom studied him intently for a moment, and then replied “I saw when Harry did it. The way it gave people hope, the way he fought for them, for the truth. It was powerful, important”.
“I always need you Severus.” It was spoken with pure faith and Draco’s eyes widened when it hit him that it was that same trust what made Snape’s defection seem so natural to him. Part of him, involuntarily, must have believed in Dumbledore’s judgement, must have recognised and respected his authority.
“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.”
Draco, unapologetically clad in a single towel, stared at him and waited.
Draco peered out of the window, finding that it overlooked a neat looking garden and some nice townhouses, and nodded to himself. It would do.
He waved his wand lazily over a hardback copy of “Muggles for Dummies: 1000 easy tips to blend seamlessly into their world”, watching as page after page ripped off its bind and started folding neatly into origami cranes. Only when a modest fleet of paper birds was circling around him, he realised the other man had stopped talking.
They had been blond toddlers, but Wendy’s shade had gotten progressively darker and, as an 11 years old, she sported long brown curls. Messy and wild, a little bit like her. Jack, for some reasons that were probably his mother, was still blond, albeit not as fair as Draco. His locks had a gentle wave to them. Lucius, to his son’s puzzlement, had said that Jack looked just like Draco. To Draco the boy was so much the spitting image of Luna that he didn’t want to think of the implications of his father’s statement. The truth was that Lucius had never been the same after the war and Draco was ok to let him have his harmless beliefs. His mother and Molly doted the children with the pure love of grandmothers. He hadn’t been that surprised of his parents acceptance, at the end the Malfoys had valued family above all.
“As for your mother I cannot promise anything, but you did what you were asked.” It was said such matter-of-factly that Draco stopped shaking. He had expected rage but his former Professor’s gaze was gentle, pinning him to the spot. “It doesn’t really matter who casted the final spell, I suppose, not when Dumbledore’s. . . Dumbledore’s death is an ultimate victory in the eye of You Know Who. A reason for celebration. No pure blood would be spilled over the disappearance of an insignificant pawn, no offence.”
“Draco, you are not a killer”. Dumbledore’s voice sounded faint but steady. He stood slumped and twisted, pale skin hanging off his bones like he had died a year before, on that first of September that would go down in Wizard’s History twenty years from then, narrated in Binn’s monotone drawl.
“I know what these are!”, Draco snapped, irritated “I mean why should I give it to you? If I recall correctly, and pardon me but the events were so delightful that my brain might still be muddled, this little thing was given to me. Therefore, and again do say if I am mistaken, it is mine.” The last word was gritted out in challenge.
They felt comfortable enough and ,somehow, Draco fell asleep, hugged in worn cotton and guilt.
“So? ‘S still scum” Vincent grunted. Which was a bit hypocrite, Draco thought, coming from someone who could barely put two grammatically correct sentences together.
“Honest to Merlin, that actually sounds very interesting. You surprise me everyday, Potter” Draco commented affectionately.
The crowd automatically turned to Harry and Draco noticed how his lips tightened and his posture stiffened in discomfort. Granger gave him a small understanding smile and shrugged apologetically. The boy replied with a if-I-must look and went to awkwardly stand near the Jasmine arch that marked the entrance of the Gardens.
A family, Harry had been deprived of one for so long and, as an adult, wanted the biggest one he could fit in his heart. Draco had felt guilty because Harry could have been with a woman, and wouldn’t that have been simpler? He knew Harry hadn’t cared about the way his children would come into his life, but Draco had wished him to have the easy way, for once. Then Luna had come along and said she would carry their child. Draco was relieved, but most of all grateful. Because, if he had learnt one thing during the war, it was that some people were kind, some people were selfless, and those were the people he wanted in his life. Harry had been ecstatic and wouldn’t stop grinning for a month. He had said it didn’t matter if the baby was biologically his, Draco could be the donor since having a proper heir was more important to him. Draco had said no, because it wasn’t, not anymore. He had stopped believing in the importance of blood a long time before. Or maybe he believed Harry’s was purer than his, just differently. He had know the child would have been his, even with Harry’s blood, or even more so. Then,  a sunny evening, Luna had arrived at their house in Hogsmeade bearing a tiny pair of ridiculous knitted socks with what looked like miniature radishes dangling from the strings: the baby was on the way.  The babies, as it had turned out. Luna had said twins run in her family. Draco knew it was most likely the fact that medically aided pregnancies had higher rates of multiples, but she had later birthed twins boys of her own, so maybe it was true. Their children had been born at the beginning of a really rainy march, and it had been splendid. They had been mostly bold but for a little tuft of light blond hair, to Harry bewilderment and Draco’s badly concealed triumph. He had asked Harry if he wanted to name them after his parents. Harry had said the past was in the past and as much as he could love people he never truly met, he wanted their children to have a fresh start and identity. He had somehow really gotten into muggle fairytales during Luna’s pregnancy, the two of them often found sitting shoulder to shoulder with mugs of hot chocolate and a book. Draco had blamed it on Hermione.
On the day, he would have given his wand hand for the chance of claiming that particular prize. For the chance of letting pure luck lifting the heavy consequences of failure from his withering shoulders, if just for a while. Not the way Draco would have had preferred wasting the opportunity, but he had long lost the privilege of being picky.
Draco stepped closer, and the snatchers scooted the prisoners roughly so that he could see the boy better. He was afraid of what he would see. He kept his eyes levelled with the other wizard’s shoulders, that reached just about an inch below his own. He hadn’t seen Potter in a long time, but he was aware they were almost the same height by sixth year.  The bones protruding too oddly to be healthy were an indication that the person in front of him was half starved and the wayward locks that almost reached his shoulders, curling just below the ears, were telling of a long period deprived of proper self care.
Vincent and Greg made a move for their wands and for a moment Draco thought they were going to fight. At the end they must have realised their spell-casting wasn’t at the Professor’s level and, with two disgrunted sound of agreement, they followed the man inside.
“To stop you from thinking. Is it working?”
The problem with Felix Felicis, Draco considered as they stepped outside, was that it lulled you into a false sense of security. He wanted to panic, he really did, but the insistent humming in his blood overrode his senses with the certainty that he was on the right path. It was like being drunk, and he could only hope that it didn’t lead to the same sort of regrets.
Lupin fixed him with a pointed look and clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth in disapproval.
Draco smirked “Well, yes, all that too. But… he brought it on himself.” For a long time, he had blamed the other wizard for his father’s imprisonment, but as soon as the words were out of his mouth he realised how much he actually meant them.
“Because you know me so well” Harry sighed, shaking his head “It really helps. . . to relax and focus, I mean. And it’s a challenge, I’ve always liked a challenge”. He raised his chin and locked Draco in a gaze that just proved so, but the Slytherin was still thinking about his first statement. Because you know me so well, and Merlin’s beard if that wasn’t true.
“Subtle.” Draco muttered, rolling his eyes to the vacant surroundings. The pink cover glimmered back in response.
They looked at each other while the wind blew their hair and tickled their skin. Then Harry asked “And you? What do you want, Draco?”
“No point in hiding the truth, Severus. After all you were the one that gave me a year at best. And I am a fool in many ways, but not when it comes to my own mortality”.
He met Daphne, her sister and two Seventh year Slytherins on their way to the Great Hall. They greeted each others and made small talks.
The other wizard glanced at the empty frames “Maybe, but aren’t all the reasons we act for personal?”
“It’s okay. But yeah, I am of age.”
After he was sure that nobody would take the seat next to his, he picked up his backpack, hugging it against his chest protectively like he would have done so many years before with his stuffed toy dragon, Prince. His knees came to rest just below his chin, sneaker clad feet perching at the edge of his seat.
“You cannot mean. . .” Snape stammered at the same time as Draco voiced his denial.
“I will, but that won’t make it less of a bad idea”. I won’t be welcome, Mum, and I don’t think I can take it. I can take being alone another year, not with people around me. He made to leave but she stopped him “There is more”. She was still holding the letter, and started to read the few lines at the bottom “The postscript. It says that all students of age, or with permission from a guardian, who wish to aid in the creation of a Memorial Garden for the fallen, are welcome to anticipate their return by two weeks. You will join Neville Longbottom, with the supervision of Professors Sprout and Flitwick, in helping with the completion of the project. We required any interest to partecipate to be included in the reply to this letter”. And with that, she folded the paper back in two.
“No. Yeah. . . Okay - that’s fine”. Draco thought about all the nameless faces he had seen vanishing at the Dark Lord’s hand throughout the previous summer, in that same house his mother called her own. But Narcissa wasn’t a nobody. She just. . . Wasn’t. She mattered. She had to be alive.
“Potter is here?” Fucking Potter was alive. Draco scanned the room, adrenaline pumping in his veins. Potter had been in Wales the entire fucking time and Draco could punch him again. Would punch him again.
The concise answers grated on his nerves and Draco thought he might have found someone to punch, after all.
Well, almost everything, he thought noticing Pansy, as the girl entered his line of sight. She looked lost. The room was sparsely occupied, as most of the younger pupils were enjoying the first snow of the season and the older ones were catching up on studies before the holidays. She spotted him, and he moved further up the sofa to free some space for her to join him. She sat down on the edge, hands gripping the worn leather on both sides. The reflection of the fire danced in her dark eyes, and for a while they were silent.
“It wouldn’t be the first time.” He said instead, going for cocky and falling a mile short. Bitterness tasted like burnt coffee.
Sorry guys this took so long but it has been a wild start of the year. I hope it’s okay, I haven’t had much time to re-read it so finger crossed it’s not just a bunch of nonsense 😣
Draco rolled his eyes.
He stared at his legs, pale, long, raising above the water like floating branches of a dead tree. He could see the exact moment the first tear hit the surface, rippling it in symmetric circles. After that, it was all a blur.
“Yeah. It was the first name that popped into my head and it stuck.” Potter admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “Wait, am I missing something?”
“You are not alone” Blaise said, gently.
Draco sat down at the edge of the sofa, determined to fight his curiosity and the urge to snoop around the room. It was surprisingly comfortable, a charcoal grey three seater, well-loved and, against all odds, to Draco’s taste.
So he nodded and handed the vial over.
Ha! Was he ever fucking okay, lately.
Lupin instantly sobered. “You are right, I am sorry. She really is the cleverest witch of her age, though. We needed to, uh, have a chat with Slughorn about something and Hermione thought why not take advantage of a little bit of luck. It’s really hard to come across felix felicis, almost impossible, but she said we were in a war. . . That she was scared for her friends, that she was hoping to find Harry one day. . . So she managed to get three more vials after that. I- I have one, should be enough for a 24 hours dose or two 12 hours ones, if you half it.”
“Who is he apologising to?” Draco couldn’t fathom who the person that literally died for everybody else would need to say sorry to.
Theo wanted to plant some seeds in memory of Stephen.
“Well, he is quite all right when he doesn’t have things to save. And, Pansy, you are not alone”.
“Such lies, Lucius . . .” And then the Dark Lord started hissing. And something was hissing back.
“Cut the crap, ferret!” There was a hint of craze in Weasley’s blue eyes and Draco took an involuntary step back. “Where. Is. Harry?”
Night, not dusk, and Draco almost sagged in relief at what must have been just a horrible dream. He closed his eyes and let his head fall backwards, groaning when the impact sent an uncomfortable jolt down his spine. As his breaths grew deeper the voice around him became louder. Draco was about to tell Blaise to knock it off and let him sleep when he realised that the voice sounded frantic and very much not Blaise’s.
“Of course you do. Well, imagine how happy Potter will be when he finds out you sent the only animal that ever loved him to a Muggle Rescue Centre or whatever.” He drew a little smile next to his words,to convey just how Happy Potter would be.
They descended without speaking, again.
“I said okay. They are not my memories to keep. . . And I guess they do in some way concern you, as well. It’s just that nobody has asked me that before. You took me by surprise.”
Draco wanted to throw up, his stomach thigh and uncomfortable. All eyes were now and her and Snape confirmed his recognition. Draco found himself unable to watch, now that she had woken, but he had figured she looked about the same age as his professor and he wondered if perhaps they had been in school together. She was an inconsequential woman, not memorable, but something in his brain was telling him he knew who she was.
The youngest of the children, a toddler with hair almost as blond as his, dangled sleepily from her father’s shoulder, head bobbing up and down every time the man shifted to adjust the strap of his heavy looking duffle. A particularly brusque movement jolted her awake and Draco watched as she took in her surroundings, confusion replaced by curiosity when she met his eyes.
Her eyes darted briefly to his hands that, he noticed with a great deal of embarrassment, were gripping the handles of his seat so tight they looked entirely void of colour. His fingers spasmed, releasing their clutch slowly as blood started to flow again into circulation.
Fucking Muggles.
Finally, Luna said “I think that’s a lovely idea, don’t you?”
Cat Ron glared, digging his sharp nails in the soft skin of Draco’s stomach. They both hissed and Potter looked at him with a tiny, knowing smile.
It was a testament of what a strange day he had experienced, that Draco let the jibe pass without a snarking remark.
“Okay.”
“Well, sorry I ever doubted you”.
Draco barely had the time to register the words that the crowd started to push their way inside, dragging him along. He craned his neck to look at the spot where Potter’s body was a few moments before, and it was empty.
The steady pace of the bus was almost as calming as flying above the clouds, and Draco rested his forehead on the cooling glass, following the dance of city lights against the darkening sky.
The woman gave him a motherly smile and reached into her purse, materialising an unopened bottle and a little round box. “I always buy too many.” She said, pushing the bottle into his hands and opening the metal container. It was filled with hard yellow sweets, coated in sugar powder, not unlike the one his mother seemed to favour.
Also, at some point i kinda described what i felt in the past during panic attacts and how i had to focus on an image and my breathing and heart rate to come back to reality, i hope it makes sense.
“Well, wasn’t that sweet” a mocking voice rose from the Professors table, and Draco watched as one of the new members of staff stood up. Amycus Carrow was a pallid, ill looking man, with tiny pig eyes and a squat body that didn’t help disguise his lack of intellect. Draco couldn’t fantom the Dark Lord’s choice in such a man as his leverage over the school, and shivered in disgust when the older wizard cleared his throat obnoxiously and continued “I’ve been chosen by the Ministry as your Dark Arts Professor and I’d say it was about time you had someone up to the task. From today on I’ll be Professor Carrow to you and I’ll make sure that any disrespectful behaviour is punished the right way. You will notice things are quite different from the way that old fool Dumbledore used to run the school”.
Christmas wasn’t merry, and didn’t feel like Christmas at all. But his mother was there, looking thin and strong, and they hugged by the tree. When his house elf, Splinter, packed his trunk to go back to Hogwarts he said thank you without thinking.
“I don’t care how you do it, but these are my terms. Take or leave it”. He said, bolder than he was feeling.
It took another three days before everything was ready.
It was on the spur of the moment that, after finding the shards of Sirius’ two way mirror in Harry’s trunk, he had decided to encase two small, round pieces in the void of the owl’s eyes.
Where he had stood, Draco noticed a lone white Lily, swaying in the breeze.
“Are you okay?”
Vincent and Greg lifted their charms and moved in the direction of the voices, barely containing their excitement. Potter and his friends, clearly not expecting company, were discussing animatedly about a diadem that was hidden somewhere in the room. They sounded urgent and Draco imagined it had something to do with the Trio breaking into his aunt’s vault the day before. They were looking for objects of a certain importance, and his curiosity was spiked despite the circumstances. Not for the first time Draco wondered what information the other students had on the Dark Lord that wasn’t known even by his closest followers. The destiny of the world in the hands of a bunch of kids. Draco spied the grim covered faces of the three Gryffindors from a slit in between a stack of chairs and they looked so young. They were dirty, and underfed, and angular and oh so young. But then Draco replayed seeing Gryffindor winning the House Cup in first year, and them three, sheepish and embarrassed and a bit smug while the rumours travelled around the room of little children that did things most adults couldn’t. He thought of second year and two boys in the Chamber of Secrets. Of third year, fourth, fifth. Dementors, dragons, Cedric’s body while Potter screamed, broken but alive. Death Eaters. His father. Draco knew his father was a powerful wizard, but still they made it out. Draco had hated them for it, for all the times their names were on everybody’s mouth. Blamed it on sheer luck, the luck of a young boy that lost everything and still had to face so much. Draco had called it luck because he knew he was better, his parents told him he was, and some people like Vince and Greg even believed it. So it had to be luck, or stupidity, because Draco had been in the Forbidden Forest with Potter, he had seen what people like his father were capable of, and all he could do was being terrified. But Potter was scared too, he had said so, and the wall Draco had been building methodically to keep the truth away had collapsed. Crumbled. Maybe it wasn’t luck, maybe he was just a boy, with friends that loved him so much they were family, a boy who didn’t have a choice. Because his life was written since he was a baby and so he was scared and brave and faced it, in the best way he could and with those people that loved him not because he was a hero but because he was him. They were a team, with different skills and with some of the madness of youth that keeps you going even in the face of danger. And, perhaps, with a bit of luck too.
(See the end of the chapter for
Theo was important for Draco, in a way not many people knew. In a way he hadn’t wanted people to know. Theo, on the other side, was unapologetic of whom he was and had watched Draco choosing his path with sad eyes. Theo wasn’t his father, or his brother, or even him.
“Okay, then. This is your room.” He gestured at the door in front of them, open enough that Draco could spot a gray wallpaper with a bird motif cutting it across the middle, like little white soldiers, silhouetted orderly on the battle line. Ready to fly any minute, now.
“But we do belong here, Draco. This is rightfully ours, we were born into it!” Pansy sounded stubborn, as if trying to hold onto a slippery surface, afraid to discover what would greet her if she was to let go.
“Do you think you can miss someone that you don’t remember?”.
“You LOST HIM?”
Theo’s mother had died when he was only three, and his father had always been a strict, cold man. But there was Stephen, Theo’s older brother and for a long time they had been enough for each other. That was, until Stephen had joined the Death Eater along with Draco, the summer before. And got himself killed, the night of the raid to get Potter, Draco’s brain reminded him, and a wave of shame shook him. He didn’t even send an owl.
“Because I don’t like you all that much, exactly.” Definitely-not-Umbridge replied, grinning in amusement for the first time since they had met again, almost a week before. His eyes danced with mirth, transforming his face completely into something younger and carefree. It was honestly disturbing, realising Lupin was a man in his mid-thirties when, most days,  he carried himself like he was at least a hundred. Draco feared what war did to youth.
It took a moment for Draco to understand what the other boy meant. Today the families of the victims were invited to the opening of the Gardens. It would be a private little affair, out of respect. The Gardens would be available to the public in the summer, once the students had returned at home, for a open donation to a fund that would take care of the costs of repairs and support for the one affected by the war. During the ceremony the relatives, and friends that wanted to, would be given some seed to plant in the four empty lots around the pond, in the name of the people they wanted to remember. The students had chosen an array of wildflowers, to give a natural and unconfined feeling to the place. The fertiliser, a combination of ageing and strengthening potions with an everlasting elixir, would assure the immediate blooming of the seeds and the lasting of the flowers so that the Gardens would always appear in season.
Draco had briefly noticed his aunt being there, she looked so much like Bellatrix he had known straight away. But she was a stranger, and that wasn’t the place. Maybe one day.
“Ready” Draco nodded.
And then it was chaos. Draco saw Vincent aiming a Cruciatus at Potter and cried hysterically “STOP. The Dark Lord wants him alive —“ because that was reasonable. That might stop him.
Yey! I did it! I finished it!!! i am so happy! Thanks to everybody that has been following this mad journey and I hope you like the romance😂 as in finally, sooo sorry for that ❤️
“There were other years before that. . . and I don’t know, Theo. Can we really just go back to normal after the war?” He sighed, feeling like he was making excuses.
Slipping into his new trainers, Draco appreciated how the canvas was steadily breaking in to become the most comfortable pair he owned. He went through his bathroom routine quickly, poking at the dark skin under his eyes with a sort of detached acceptance. His hair was getting long. A poor attempt at fixing it a month prior had left the sides shorter and kind of choppy and the fringe brushing just below his eyebrow. It had now reached the eyelids, tickling annoyingly every time he shifted. Draco thought it fitted his new brooding aesthetic to a tee, leaving the pristine and polished image of the rich brat behind. He wasn’t that person any longer, and the realisation wasn’t as bitter as he had expected.
Anyway, it’s a long chapter, some parts are descriptive so hopefully not boring.
“That was an apology?” Weasley spluttered, but Harry just grinned.
Draco heartbeat slowed as he took a deep breath and then another. It had taken him a whole two weeks to compose the letter to his parents and three days awaiting for the response. He wasn’t sure what he had expected. Part of him had known they had chosen family over everything, and it was likely that they would eventually do it again.
Quite a few people agreed and from then the discussion became more animated. They were just a bunch of kids but they had grown a lot during the last year. Draco felt like the first step had been taken. Maybe he could do this.
When morning came he looked at the two empty beds next to his with narrowed eyes. Theo had reached Blaise a week before and they wouldn’t be back until the Saturday. Draco felt slightly betrayed. In their letter the Italian had declared he would have been invited if they hadn’t know about “his need to reevaluate his life and wallow in self pity”. He considered skipping breakfast.

Potter, he wouldn’t have been in this predicament, that stupid boy would rather sacrifice his life than kill an old man that was possibly dying anyway. Draco wasn’t Potter, though. Still, he couldn’t voice the curse, so wasn’t that what he was doing too? Surely not killing Dumbledore would mean death, wasn’t not acting a sort of sacrifice itself? He was young, he didn’t want to die.
“Your flatmate named her ginger cat Ron?” Draco asked again, stressing the word ginger with disbelief.
Draco realised now that war for the children of Hogwarts, these scared kids before him, had been like that swan for his four years old self. A concept so big, so abstract when reality was there in front of them but still looking so perfect, so unbroken, that it didn’t fully hit. The swan was still beautiful, so Draco had listen to words of pain and finality but his heart stayed light because if death looked so perfect maybe it wasn’t so bad at all.
“The snake? He told you about the sn . . . Fuck, Neville! Where did he go?”
“Oh.”
Please ensure to send your decision back by owl in no longer than a month time. Upon affirmative response you will be provided with a list of books and materials. Best regards, Minerva McGonagall”.
“I thought so”.
He saw Longbottom’s eyes widen slightly. No. No no no. Draco refused to be the one to put the other boy under the curse that robbed him of his parents. He tried to maintain a calm appearence and give a bored inflection to his voice “I find that humiliation is worse than pain”.
Weasley’s eyes widened in horror and Granger squeezed his hand, tears trailing down her cheeks “Oh, Harry . . .”
“And you are the villain’s sidekick’s child. Hardly a title to lose your sleep upon”.
Harry hadn’t chosen to lose his loving parent before having the opportunity to get to know them properly. He hadn’t chosen to be raised by people that despised the inner essence of his own being. He hadn’t chosen to be the child hero of a world quick to turn its back on him at the first, uncomfortable truth.
“What say you, Draco?” The Dark Lord had asked “Will you babysit the cubs?”
Draco was somewhat familiar with the notion of what Potter had casually referred to as “the telly”.
The driver made half-arsed attempts at conversation, but they all fell short.
Was it worth it, Potter had asked. Maybe. The other wizard wouldn’t have agreed, but that was beyond the point, there was just too much at stake. There was no backing out and Draco needed all his concentration and abilities to complete the task. If Potter knew he had been the motivation that pushed Draco to finally fix that blasted cabinet he would have been horrified, and the thought was strangely not as satisfying as it should have. Draco reasoned that the sudden lingering of guilt in his stomach was due to the fact that wherever his loyalties laid he didn’t really want to kill anyone. Not for the first time he thought about what Potter said about being sixteen and thinking about silly, inconsequential things, and his left arm itched in response. As much as it was for Potter, that was not an option, and Draco had never craved simply being young more.
I know this chapter is shorter, but I kinda felt like it ended where it did. It’s also really sad and I am sorry, I think next chapter will be lighter and there will be more banter and planning between our two new besties. Also, Harry will appear soon, I just felt like I had to explain why Draco was given the memories first. Let’s say this poor boy will need therapy.
Ah, the Muggle Studies Professor. Voldemort’s glacial voice echoed in the room but was lost to Draco’s ears. He was again transfixed by the sight in front of him, Charity Burbage’s pleading eyes, so terrified in her last moments. Her soft voice begging Snape, a colleague, maybe even a friend, someone she trusted, to help her. She must have known it was in vain, but still she tried “Severus... please... please”. The same parting words professed by Dumbledore not long before, but while the Headmaster had sounded ready to Draco’s ears, Professor Burbage was desperate. She is scared to die, Draco realised, a bit pointlessly, and while watching Charity Burbage lifeless body fall ungraciously on the table he understood what Harry meant when he said that it was ok to be scared. Because this was real. This was war and people died and would die. And with this new knowledge, a boy that once dreamt of magnificence, power and glory, elevating himself above the others in what at 16 was just a game of role-play, felt his whole belief system die a little bit too. His head spinning, Draco felt his body give up and his chair hitting the floor with a crash. The last thing he heard was the snake hissing and then all was black.
“Please!” Draco exclaimed, in a high pitch voice, then daintily “He had terrible hair, anyway”.
He was looking for them but what he found was Theo.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, right, I thought I was forgetting something.” Potter said, releasing the arm that had snatched around Draco’s waist for support. “That’s Ron.”
Draco stared at his reflection. His worn-out reflection; grey skin and sunken eyes, just a ghost of his former self. A 16 years old walking bomb, all nervous ticks and paranoia, ready to implode on himself. He felt claustrophobic in his own skin, his once fitted clothes feeling constricting despite the bagginess. He pulled at his tie, a snake around his pale neck, too tight, suffocating, no room to breath. He needed air. His eyes in the mirror were pleading. His father’s eyes people said all the time, but his father’s were always so composed, superior, disdainful. “Not afraid, Draco, never afraid”. He felt the wet trail of tears on his cheeks more than saw them, the world had suddenly gone blurry, out of focus. He needed to act, do something out of character, freeing. He had always been a showman, gloating in the spotlight, in the attention and admiration, but this year he had to be discreet, and he hated it. He wanted to run naked, screaming, to see people looking at him as if he was as mad as he felt, fear in their eyes. He wanted to run, full stop. He was running out of time and he was scared.
He looked at the young Gryffindor that would never go back to either of his worlds and wondered if his parents even knew of the war that was going on. Of the magnitude of it. And of their son, that died to protect a reality that would never welcome them fully.
“Can’t relate. Listen, Draco, I think we could help each other here. That vial for whatever I can offer, name your price. Besides, I don’t see you wanting to get involved more than you already are, I’m trying to get this responsibility off your shoulders!”
The people around him were getting agitated.
His voice was so fond and eager that Draco almost snickered, knowing all too well how famously him and Potter had gotten along in the past. “I hope so.” He offered, trying to keep the dubious inflation out of his voice.
With a half smile gracing his lips, Draco prepared to leave. It was only when he reached into his backpack for the felix felicis, that he felt his nerves unexpectedly tense.
And didn’t it paint a nice little picture of his character, that Dumbledore had him pegged down as someone capable to uproot a kid from his new, shiny, fucking clueless life and send him to his death.
Hello, I’ve realised that Ive been using the chapter summaries for notes so I am trying to correct that from now on. Well, the battle of Hogwarts has begun. I reckon a couple more chapters before we go into completely unexplored territory but I think this chapter has only new stuff. The next two should have the room of requirements scene and Voldemort’s death. I really really want to write a scene that I have in mind that I think has never been done and I’m quite excited about but I think it would still be quite a few chapters. Harry into the next though.
“Draco, you don’t understand” Theo said sharply, eyes searching his almost in a silent beg “I am forgotten. And I intend it to stay that way”.
The other boy sighed “Snape, and even Dumbledore, had taught me the world is not black and white. There are different types of courage. He went against his beliefs, against a mindset he had build for himself out of abuse and neglect . . . He wanted to belong and because the Muggle world hadn’t been kind to him he sought it in the magical one, to an extreme. . . I’d disliked him, even hated him, but now I think I understand a bit. At the end, he sacrificed all his life out of what he felt for my mother, and regardless of the reason, what he did was fundamental for ending the war. As for me dying, with a piece of Voldemort’s soul in me that was the only way, just a fact. . . And I think Dumbledore knew me well. . . He was right, I didn’t want to die, but I wanted other people to live more. Neither him or Snape forgave themselves in life, so yeah, I think I do”.
Draco was still thinking about what Granger had said when luck wanted that he spotted just the person he was looking for. He was half way to the castle when he noticed a patch of yellow just at the edge of the forest. There was only one person that would agree to wear one of Granger’s obnoxious knitted hats, and a bright yellow one at that.
More than the faces of his friends, more than the real and good memories of Hogwarts, more than magic itself, it was stripping Harry of his own name, his identity, that had made his guts twist with guilt.
Even breakfast stretched over decades, the clock mocking him with the gift of time when all he wanted was the day to be over and done with.
“I need to go.”
That’s how, on the 16th of August, Draco had found himself apparating to Hogsmeade. It had been a lovely, warm Sunday and he had spent most of it nervously walking back and forth on the patio, backtracking on his decision. His mother had sat patiently on a wicker chair, letting him release his steam and occasionally reading a passage from her book aloud. It was a story about love, youth and second chances. When she read “It’s never too late to have a happy childhood”, he had rolled his eyes and replied “I had a happy childhood!”, but decided that was his clue to go.
“I did”
Harry Potter didn’t have a future. He was never meant to.
Potter’s “telly” was about ten time the size of the ones on the airplane, bulky and rather ugly. The boy himself was crouched down in front of it, pulling several rectangular boxes that, at first glance, Draco had thought to be books, out from the wooden cabinet that doubled as a stand. His blue t-shirt rode up, revealing two dimples at the base of his back and a small birthmark the colour of a coffee stain.
“The boy, we gonna bring ‘im to the Dark Lord” Vince laughed like it was a good idea.
“Typical of you to twist your evil deeds around like if you did something remarkable. . . Nothing of significance . . .” Theo joked, but became suddenly serious “Like anyone would actually care about that, Draco”
Draco wasn’t sure what to make of this new, carefree version of the moody boy he remembered from Hogwarts. After all that had happened in the last year, he was tempted to let himself be pulled into the flow and enjoy being simply seventeen for once. Lupin might have robbed Potter of many things, but it was clear that he had given him back his youth.
“I do.” he murmured, pushing himself off the chair and approaching the pensieve in marvel.
Thoughts of his mother only made him sadder, and he glanced up at the other boy. Yes, it had been a shock to learn about Potter’s past but in that very moment Draco knew it made a strange sort of sense. Now that he had seen the other boy truly relaxed and carefree, he wondered how he could have missed the signs of melancholy that always featured behind his ex schoolmate’s reserved smiles. Not that they had known each other all that well, after all. Neither had bothered, caught up in their mutual dislike.
Wanting. 16 years old Draco had wanted many things. 17 years old Draco closed his eyes and thought of flying. Hands tight around the handle of his broom and off against the wind, chasing a flicker of gold dancing just inches out of reach. If he could ask one last thing, Draco wanted the simple feeling of happiness.
The boy caught up, but stopped as soon as he reached him “Wait, I haven’t been in the forest since — well. . .”
“Yeah. . . It’s going to be good” said Longbottom, with a big smile.
The other wizard stopped and stared at Draco like he had somehow accidentally conjured him out of thin air and was surprised that he was a real boy.
The receptionist licked his fingers, before snatching the paper and running his eyes over it.
“What?” He blurted.
He looked up, noticing the other boy had stopped on the edge of the kerb, observing him with a slight frown. He must have been talking for a while, Draco realised with a foreign sense of guilt. He wasn’t there to idly chit chat to the Muggles, but he couldn’t help offering an encouraging smile.
“If that’s what you want, I’ll leave”.
“Needed a fresh start?” The woman filled in the blanks for him, and he nodded.
“Expelliarmus” he heard his voice shouting and to his surprise the disarming spell worked.
He quietly finished his breakfast and dabbed the lingering syrup from his lips with a tissue. He decided he would make a quick trip to the toilet to cast a “tempus” and freshen up before paying and get moving. The effect of the felix felicis would last him around 8 hours, but he was starting to doubt the potion believed he truly wanted to find Potter and was instead catering to his subconscious
“I’ve found the Prat”.
But then another familiar voice rang in the chaos that was about to happen. “I am pants at potions”.
