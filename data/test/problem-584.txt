Gemma looked at Draco and he straightened up in his seat, putting the quill down as he frowned.
Draco spent much of his time watching people.
, Draco thinks to himself.
“I loved Ginny,” Potter continued and Draco rolled his eyes, still shivering from the strong liquor, “I still love her. But… I’m not attracted to her anymore. I don’t know what to call what I am. Queer, sure. Gay, no. Gender… It doesn’t bother me.” Potter eyed his half empty pint, but pushes it away. “I didn’t realise… Before. What we did, I mean - it wasn’t like that. I don’t regret it. I was just confused, you know?”
He’d come by on a whim, being lucky enough to be let in by a nice old neighbour of Draco’s, an old lady living just next door. All it took was a charming smile and telling her that he’d gone to the same boarding school as Draco. The woman mentioned some placed called ‘Eton’ and Harry had just nodded and said that was it. The old lady was more than happy to let Harry in.
Draco drew a hand through his hair, trying to get it out of his face, but just like Harry’s bloody hair, it just fell back and refused to be confined to its desired place. He seemed to give up when he pulled his jumper off, ruffling his hair even further, Harry could only stare as his hands wandered over Draco’s exposed chest, over his slim hips and flat stomach.
To Draco’s absolute annoyance, his father went and sat in Draco’s chair behind his desk. He might as well have just flipped him off and shagged his wife while he was at it. Or taken a shit on his chest.
He’d give his parents that, at least. They’d been lucky enough to marry out of love, even though what little love they still held for each other was well hidden and private, if it even still existed. Draco had no such luck. Astoria had been a desperate choice before his parents married him off to some horrid Rosier or - bloody hell - Goyle’s older sister.
“I…” Harry sighed, shaking his head and looking away from Draco for a moment. “I meant it. Every word. I don’t know what you want Draco, but whatever you decide, I’ll respect that. I can’t take away what’s happened between us, ten years ago or a couple of weeks ago.”
“I see,” Draco said. Before he had to think of something else, the record had finished and Liffy arrived with a pop, bringing their food.
Draco accioed his etui of cigarettes and brought one to his lips, staring at the white walls surrounding him in the silence of his dark living room. Smoke billowed around his head as he watched the fag’s end glow in a soft orange.
Gemma smiled and reached forward to clasp his hand, whilst Draco held back slightly, his sharp face blank as he silently watched Harry. When Gemma released his hand, Harry turned to Draco, not sure on how to proceed, considering. His hand was shaking and sweaty. Gemma hadn’t mentioned it. Maybe she thought him nervous about tomorrow.
With a pop, the old house elf materialised beside Harry, his crouched back and long nose making him look as horrible as his moods.
Draco felt disgusted as he sat at the too large dining table with his family. His father sat at the head of the table, dabbing the corner of his mouth with a napkin, his hair perfectly pulled back and bound at his neck and his eyes as empty grey as Draco’s own. The constant sneer was still etched to his face as he looked down the table at his family with disappointment in his eyes. What he ignored was that the failure he felt for his wife and son was of his own making.
“I want to be happy, and I would like to try it with you.”
inheritance, and don’t forget that Mrs. Potter is the one who’s asked for a divorce.”
Draco frowned as he threw the man a look again, noticing he was now staring, as if working hon saying something. The look in his eye made Draco uncomfortable.
“What?” Potter seemed to relax, holding up a finger for one more from the dyke at the bar, who nodded with a smile to Potter. “This is my neighbourhood gay pub.” Potter said as he sat down next to Draco, throwing the older man a cursory glare.
After a few polite words about nothing in general and a cup of tea, they went down to business. Draco had sent over scrolls of plans, filled with calculations Harry had a hard time to decipher, but Gemma did her best to explain what they meant and Harry trusted her. He had to, considering the amount of money he was paying her for her work.
Potter?
“What are you doing here, really?”
“I’m so sorry, but… I can’t.” She said in a smaller voice than usual, “It’s an auror. A.. Auror Potter, in fact.”
Draco decided he was going to slowly strangle his assistant when Potter walked into his office less than a minute later, finding Draco standing by his desk threading his fingers through his slicked back hair.
And Harry had understood, he really did. Still, the shock of it all took some time to get over. He’d only every been with one other person aside from Ginny, and… he didn’t want to think about that. Not right then and there.
.” And Potter looked ashamed as he said it. Draco supposed he could empathise. After all, he never found Astoria especially stirring, even though she’s one of the most striking women he’s seen. “The divorce… Ginny brought it on, but - it’s mutual. I’ve wanted to date other people for years… And Shacklebolt came into the picture, and honestly, I’m not even angry. I want her to have a good life. Just like I want a good life.”
Draco was what he was. It was an incurable infliction and besides, he had done his duty to his family. He’d married a pure-blooded witch and gotten the heir. A spare had been ideal, he supposes, but perhaps it wasn’t to be. Draco didn’t want to think about the fact that he was expected back at the manor tomorrow for his weekly visit and shag. A weekly shag which in and of itself really was more close to rape. Him raping Astoria - and himself, by extension.
Blaise laughed and Marcus and Anthony followed. Their eyes met and they searched for Draco’s. He didn't hear the joke, but it din’t matter, did it? He felt nothing, but laughed anyway. It only gave him a disgusting feeling, like he needed a shower, if only to shed the emptiness inside him. The lack of actual
Draco rolled his eyes, reaching into his pocket for the brushed brass etui in which he kept cigarettes for especially draining situations. His father gave him a disgusted look as Draco lit a fag, still refusing to sit down in front of his father and instead leaning against the shelves Potter had stared into during a majority of their awkward meeting yesterday.
“What’s that supposed to mean, Malfoy?”
So how come this felt like he was suddenly trying to climb a steep mountainside without any safety?
“Well, what?” Draco finally said, his pride a bit too hurt for him to play along with Potter’s nonchalance.
“Liffy!” and the elf popped in, watery and large eyes noticing Potter immediately before turning to Draco.
After a few seconds, Astoria put the book and her glasses away and pulled her nightgown up to her waist before she got on her knees and turned around. It was easier with just her arse in the air. The round shapes of her hips were difficult to ignore, but as long as Draco relied on conjured images in his mind and the pink potion, he could pretend the wet heat from her cunt was something else, someone else. Giving his cock a few pulls, he took his position behind her, took a deep breath and then pressed inside. He was dry, and so was Astoria. She whimpered from pain and Draco pressed down on the small of her back and clenched his jaw, shutting his eyes. It would be over soon.
Draco looked at him with a scoff, before he put his glass down and crossed his arms over his chest.
Draco looked at him for a moment, before he pushed Harry off, his shove so violent Harry stumbled back slightly. Harry frowned and stared at Draco before they both took a step forward and their lips met in a whirlwind of supressed anger, pain and just pure, unadulterated lust.
“The house in Godric’s Hollow goes to Ginny,” Draco said, taking notes from Gemma’s walkthrough of the proposal for the hearing. “And it was valued at around half a million galleons in muggle currency, estimated at around £2,5 000 000, which should be counted into the symbolic sum she receives, turning it into half a million galleons, along with the house.”
Electric Light Orchestra - Mr. Blue Sky
Draco entered the lift inside Gringotts, refusing to take his headphones off as he played oblivious to those around him. He knew it annoyed several of his co-workers, but he just didn’t bloody care. He didn’t even take them off for his assistant already sitting at her desk outside his office. When she began speaking, he simply held a finger to his lips and walked past her.
Inside his office, Draco was met by the last person he wished to see this morning and as he pulled his headphones off a little more aggressively than necessary, he noticed his assistant standing in the door, whimpering.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, pushing a hand through his hair. “Just nervous, considering what Ginny’s solicitor said.”
Right, it kills you.
Anger stirred in Draco. How dare he? How dare he just jump back into Draco’s life like this, as if all is well and the past is forgotten and forgiven. It’s not. It’s not bloody forgiven.
Harry hadn’t realised he’d said it out loud. “Hm? Noth-nothing.”
Maybe Draco could read his thoughts, maybe he could see the anguish, the longing, the fright - Harry didn’t know, but he felt as if he was about to collapse. Draco’s grip on his arm hardened, as if keeping Harry upright.
“I’m… I’m not trying to be an arsehole,” Potter said, raking a hand through his hair and looking a bit uncomfortable. “I’ve been enough of one, right? Right. But..” and here Potter laughed slightly, drinking from his pint. “Being queer is so bloody easy in the muggle world… It’s not in ours. You know the deal, right? Marry, have kids - do what you have to.” Potter became silent for a moment, before shrugging. “Thing is, marriage ain’t that great, is it? Not if it’s sprung on you too early, too quick. I can’t blame Ginny for seeking affection elsewhere. I haven’t really been… present, for a long time, to be honest.”
Harry himself hadn’t even bothered with his clothes. He’d arrived home, pulled off his black auror robes and then jumped into a comfy pair of absolutely ripped jeans and pulled a college shirt over his head, mussing his hair whilst at it. Draco didn’t look as if he minded.
She laughed, shaking her head. “Bloody Irish Catholic, we Farleys. You don’t adhere to any faith, Draco?”
Draco chewed on his already pink and slightly swollen lower lip, as if weighing pro’s and con’s in his head.
I've been through countless records and glasses of wine whilst writing and Draco as fought me the entire way, but alas, just like Potter, I only wished for Draco to be happy.
” Pansy would say. “
“Pot calling the kettle back.” Potter said with a raised eyebrow as he leaned back, looking all too amused for Draco to find it even remotely funny. "
Of course he fucking wanted to. But it’s not like he was going to admit it. Ever. It’d be a cold bloody day in hell when Draco didn’t do everything in his power to make Potter’s life more difficult.
Draco spent the hours before his meeting with Gemma recovering from his father’s surprise visit and when she finally showed up, Draco felt himself again and could fully concentrate on what turned out to be a somewhat bizarre divorce.
With a somewhat regretful and longing sigh, Draco stubs out his last fag and vanishes it from the ashtray before he rises from the chair and heads back inside.
Draco knew he had a special look to him - either you loved it, or you found him strange looking. Most people either loved the strange, or they simply found him attractive. Androgynous, he’d been described as several times before.
“With the funds, they will be.” Draco said, meeting Potter’s eyes before looking away again. “At least as good as they can be during the circumstances.”
“Glad to hear it,” Harry nodded, focusing on Gemma. In the corner of his eye, he could see Malfoy making notes, shuffling his scrolls around, as if restless. Harry tried to just look away. “I’m sure we’ll be able to reach sufficient results.”
A hand touched his shoulder and Draco almost lashed out, his elbow thrown up in defence before he saw his assistant standing at his side, looking somewhat frightened and worried. He could see her lips moving as she watched him hesitantly. It took him a moment to realise he was still wearing his headphones and Lou Reed’s voice mixed with Mick Ronson’s piano was drowning out what she was trying to tell him.
“I, uh, understand. I do…” Harry said. “But… Draco?”
Harry laughed, leaning against the counter as Draco opened a bottle of bubbly. Harry knew about as much of wine as he knew about music, but he did like sparkling wine. It tickled the roof of his mouth in a funny but pleasant way. Ginny didn’t drink much wine and when she did, she preferred wine that was too sugary sweet for Harry. So, yet another thing for him to appreciate about Draco’s somewhat more
“Off you go, then.” Harry said and Kreacher peered up at him, giving him a nasty glance before he disappeared with a pop.
. He looked like a slimmer version of his father, having inherited his mother’s thin body but with a constant sharpness to him. He knew he was considered handsome, but he was just that smidge too beautiful. And men weren’t supposed to be
been young and confused. You don’t make the best decisions when you’ve just realised you fancy your long-time bully, who’s also not only a bloody Death Eater and a radical blood-purist since birth, but a
“I see,” Draco cleared his throat, reaching up to adjust his tie. “And Shacklebolt?”
Potter pulled away from him, looking wrecked as he stared into Draco’s eyes. Draco stared back at him, his face blank and his chest moving up and down, constricted, painful. Potter said nothing more before he stumbled away, out from Draco’s kitchen and out of his flat - and, maybe his life?
“Right,” Potter frowned and sat down again, clasping his hands over his thighs. Draco desperately tried not to allow his eyes to follow.
Draco sauntered into the former dining room and looked around. Harry hadn’t done much in there, except turn it into a sitting room filled with a cosy large sofa and armchairs around the fireplace. On the walls hung portraits of late Black’s that weren’t as loud as Walburga, along with a few muggle paintings of landscapes. It was a fine enough room, filled with plants and small decorations Harry had found hidden away in the attic. Draco suited the room, looked like he had always been here, by simply existing. As if the house itself just recognised him and made him a part of it.
Shut it, brain. Perhaps he could kidnap one of the secretaries. Lock her into the manor’s dungeon and keep her there as a pet to take his anger out on whenever he felt like exploding. If his father believed he kept a woman to rape and torture, at least he wouldn’t be a fucking queer, right?
Yeah, he got that Draco was angry and he had every right to be. But Harry
“Stop,” Potter bit back, getting in close as he spoke, making Draco shiver as his breath touched Draco’s ear and neck. It only helped in making him even more furious. “I just want to talk to you, Draco. I know things haven’t been-“
Harry supposed he’d never know. He’d backed off for Draco’s and his own sake and he would keep doing so, unless Draco changed his mind. He’d always welcome Draco’s advances, but he had withdrawn his own, as it was obvious Draco had enough issues as it was.
Harry nodded. He supposed he understood. The shame and the collective guilt those who’d been on the opposite side of the war carried was difficult for Harry to understand, but he knew it was there. It was an entire culture of its own that had to be changed, reformed and at the same time remembered, so that it wouldn’t happen again. And before him sat one of the men who had been closest to the Dark Lord. He’d been a boy then, a boy who had tortured and maimed on command. Now, he was a man who, Harry was still fully aware of, could murder without issue.
, they were supposed to be handsome, manly and broad. Like bloody Potter.
He had few memories that he would deem as good. People tend to speak of
Harry has issues with Draco not interacting very well with his children and the fact that Draco doesn’t like his own son very much provokes Harry beyond what Draco deems is normal. It’s a stick in Harry’s eye - something unfathomable that he simply can’t put his head around - and possibly never will be able to. Draco has let it go, given up on trying to even discuss it. It only leads to misery, and he’s had enough of that for a lifetime, ta ever so much.
None of them ever did.
“I don’t mean to be… Forward.” Harry cleared his throat, worrying his lower lip. “But, you’ll never divorce her, will you?”
Albus, the little shit, has drawn what looks like an extremely naïve interpretation of the London skyline with crayons all over the kitchen drawers whilst Harry’s sitting with James at the kitchen table, trying and obviously failing to help him with his preschool home assignment.
When it was done, Draco stood speaking to one of the barristers while glancing at Potter, who was speaking to Gemma. Draco caught Potter’s eyes and inclined his head with a quick nod, hoping Potter would understand to follow him.
Right now, Draco believed any number of years until the rest of his life would actually be worth it. He could imagine his hands around Potter’s neck, squeezing as he pressed him down on the floor. Potter’s face turning pink, red, then purple until it turned white in that typically unnatural way only dead people could, his eyes bleeding red.
yourself in public. Many a powerful man have had mistresses, it’s part of the lives we lead and I can certainly understand the need for release away from home. But we keep it quiet, away from the public eye, do you understand?”
Of course, Draco hadn’t thought of it, but it made sense Potter would have moved into 12 Grimmauld Place when he separated from Ginny. It just hadn’t crossed Draco’s mind. And it wasn’t as if they were neighbours. That would certainly have made things a bit too complicated - or, less, maybe. He couldn’t decide.
He looked up from his musings, meeting Blaise’s dark eyes. He said something and Marcus beside him laughed. Their teeth white and bleached, all so very tidy and neat, even to the point their manicured fingernails.
“My thoughts exactly,” Draco sighed with exasperation, then looked down his nose at Harry. “Don’t ask me why, but… Yes. I suppose we might be as weak as each other, after all.” Harry didn’t contradict him and Draco took out his pocket watch to check the time. “Well, some of us have real jobs. I need to head back to the bank.”
Painfully slow to begin with. Even though Draco hadn’t done this with someone else in a while, he knew just how painful it could be if not done right, and he wanted this to be right. Wanted Harry to enjoy it as much a he did.
“You don’t agree?” Draco asked, an amused expression on his face. “I can’t imagine he’d behave better when I’m here. That little thing would never fault you for being a half-blood, would he?”
Draco looked at him for a moment before he nodded, licking his lips. “It’ll be fine, Potter.”
Harry shrugged, leaning closer to Draco, their lips brushing together. Draco drew a sharp breath before he pressed his lips against Harry’s. Harry felt as if his knees were about to collapse, his head spinning as Draco’s lips moved against his. The flick of Draco’s tongue tickling his lower lip and Harry couldn’t help the moan that escaped him. It felt like electricity went through him, the same pain and slight adrenaline shocked pleasure as when he’d tried sticking a paperclip into an electric socket in preschool.
Or two, pull himself together and realise he needed to back off for a while. He knew, had seen in Draco’s eyes that he was unsure, divided about Harry. That he felt something too, he was so very damaged and it pained Harry to witness him like that. To see him shift between masks of anger, fury and arrogant pettiness. In between, you could see the slivers of vulnerability Harry had seen in the darkened hidden classrooms ten years ago, though he had become even better at hiding, Harry had to admit.
“Do you?”
Potter smiled and gave a somewhat breathless laugh, nodding. “Seven, yeah. Sounds good, Draco.”
“I-I’m-“ His assistant stuttered and Draco whipped out his wand, slamming the door shut in her face.
The only difference between their ‘refined’ Afternoon Tea in their too large and ostentatious gardens and Draco and his so-called friends’ gathering in this distasteful establishment of a finer pub in Diagon Alley, is that Draco and his ilk have cocks and their wives do not.
responded to the kiss in the pub, hadn’t he?
“Still want me to…?” Draco asked, hesitating slightly. Last time this was brought up in conversation between them, Harry had told Draco he’d never done this before. And Draco might not be the most empathic character Harry could have found to have his ‘first time’ with, being fucked up the arse, but he didn’t want to hurt him.
Lily’s conception had been, in many ways, nothing short of a miracle. Him and Ginny had the house for themselves over a weekend when Molly and Arthur had taken the boys and a couple of bottles of wine had done the rest. It was the first time in over a year that they had proper sex.
“Kreacher would never, master Malfoy!” Kreacher bowed and Harry looked at him with surprised eyes, his mouth having fallen open in slighted shock from the elf’s reaction. “Kreacher will make lunch. Of course, of course.”
His father… Well, he might need more time. Or a friendly visit from a Demetor. Draco hasn’t decided yet.
! Harry hissed to himself as he pushed away from the door and half ran down the stairs to the entrance, taking two steps at a time in the serpentine stairs.
“Jimi Hendrix?” Draco raised an eyebrow before he smiled and walked into the kitchen. Harry followed him.
When his cock stirred and Draco had spit out the last of the toothpaste, he had resigned himself to his duty and pulled on a dressing gown before stepping out from the bathroom. Astoria was already in bed, a book leaned against her knees and reading glasses on the tip of her nose. Her dark hair fell over her shoulders in lose rivulets that should have been appealing, objectively, but Draco felt nothing.
Harry takes a hold of his hand quickly and pulls Draco back before he’s even had a chance to move out of the way, looking up at him with a wry smile.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Didn’t know you to be religious, Gem?”
Nothing else would be done for the coming two weeks. Gemma and Draco both needed to prepare for the hearing and Gemma told him she’d let him know if anything came up, but they scheduled a meeting for the day before the hearing - so that they could make sure everything was as it should.
Malfoy?
“Harry,” Ginny had taken his hand then, squeezing softly like only she could. “I know, okay?”
And it hit Harry, that he would essentially have to get to know Draco again. Of course, he was still Draco. Snobbish and condescending, but frail and soft when you got past those very sharp edges of his.
“Oh,” Draco cleared his throat, frowning. “Of course. I have my great-grandfather’s pocket watch.”
“Still here.” It wasn’t a question, but Potter didn’t seem to care. Wanker.
Then, Astoria came out carrying Scorpius. She was smiling as if she held a secret behind those lips - and when he looked at Scorpius, all he could see was his father.
“Father.” He said, not even pretending to smile.
Draco smiled, putting out his cigarette on Harry’s abandoned plate. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Potter.”
, thank god. Draco nodded, straightening.
The sauce was good, of course, but normal people ate their pasta first and then, perhaps, soaked up the last of the sauce with a piece of bread. At least when you were out of the public eye, in a relaxed and more causal situation as this. Otherwise, absolutely not. His mother would have a fit.
“I’ll see you tomorrow then, at the Ministry.” Harry said, pushing his hands into his pockets a little awkwardly.
“Yes, please, Liffy.” Draco eyed his wine. “Pasta will do. No mushrooms.”
“It’s okay,” she said, “I known for a while now. We both need this, to live our own lives just as we want to, as we have to, to remain sane. Please don’t close yourself in further. You’re doing yourself a disservice.”
But Harry tried his best. His youthful hot temper had mellowed slightly with time, and he found he had more patience than he used to. Perhaps that came with having kids. You had to learn to just wait some shit out, otherwise, you were the one in the literal shit.
Draco trailed kisses down Potter’s neck, allowing himself to take in his scent, the way the curls of his hair and his beard felt against Draco's lips and skin - how it made Draco’s body react in the most delicious of ways. It was freeing and strangely wonderful.
Potter nodded in understanding. “You don’t live in the manor at all?”
Instead, his mother sat in a chair to his side inside a brightly white room and Draco realised he was in St Mungo’s.
Draco retched and a sour taste came to the back of his mouth. He tried to swallow it down, but it spread until he stumbled out of the armchair and ran heedlessly towards the closest toilet. Clutching the porcelain, Draco emptied the meagre contents of his stomach, breathing hard as tears streamed down his chin.
“Aren’t you supposed to get to know each other when you’re on a date?” Potter looked innocent as he twirled his fork. Draco scowled.
“Yeah,” Harry pulled him down and pressed their lips together, letting out a moan as Draco pulled back. “I want you to.”
“I don’t know.” Draco answered, his voice choked. Potter nods, lifting his pint to his lips. “She’s a good woman, nevertheless.” Draco said, his voice low and hoarse. He has to force the words out. “She knows I’m not faithful …And she accepts it. If she knows…”
Harry had been stunned by him. He hadn’t seen him properly in years, and suddenly there he stood behind his desk in a room with walls of mahogany, one entire wall filled with boring looking old books, his hands in his platinum hair, pulling the wispy strands away from his face.
“Draco…” Harry sighed, rubbing his temples. “Please, just answer the question. We… We have to start somewhere, right?”
“Occasionally. But I prefer to live here.” Draco said, “And these days, I believe Astoria prefers it this way too. Gives her more freedom.”
He’d done quite a bit with this room. Replacing the dark and worn wallpaper with a crème-coloured wallpaper, as well as redressing the old furniture in brighter colours, making the room in its whole more welcoming but keeping the cosy feeling. He’d also removed quite few carved snakes. Not that he disliked snakes, but you didn’t need them in every room, did you?
“It’s true. Apparently, Potter’s absolutely shattered and I can very well believe it. Shacklebolt was one of his closest mentors during the war and after when he went on to become an auror. I mean, I haven’t spoken to Ginny, she has another solicitor - but it seems as if it’s a rather amicable split, nonetheless. No explicit infidelity or anything, but it doesn’t have to be when it’s messy from the beginning. Especially considering Potter is beyond wealthy and Ginny has next to nothing. I mean, just look at it. She marries him quickly after the war, pops out a couple of kids and a few years later, goes off with half of his fortune - shacking up with the bloody Minister for Magic.”
“Obviously, I know it’s not a healthy thing to either contemplate or to do. But, I doubt anything in my life has ever been what most
Draco growled to himself, sitting down angrily in his chair, pulling out his iPod again and going through the songs as the anger inside him bubbled like water boiling in a kettle. Lou Reed gave way to the Stooges, if only to give in to the anger, at least mentally.
“Why are we even talking about this?” Draco bit out, at a loss of both patience and this infuriating game Potter appeared to be playing with him.
Yes, Draco had been involved. He’d been an arse, a fucking idiot and bloody horrible to Potter and so many others. But Potter didn’t seem to hold it against him, never really had, after. And Draco still wouldn’t blame him if he decided he did. If he knew of it all, Draco was sure he would. If Potter could read his thoughts, what he spent his days fantasising about, he wouldn’t just judge him. He’d fucking kill him. And what a mercy that would be.
“Yes.”
Potter’s eyebrows rose again. “Draco, it wasn’t just one blowjob, was it? Stop being so bloody stubborn.”
A hand grabbed Harry’s arm as he stepped out from Gemma’s office and Harry turned around to meet Draco’s light grey eyes. He looked concerned, disturbed and most of all, worried. Harry could see the crease of skin between his lowered eyebrows - and all Harry could think of was that he didn’t like how Draco looked when he was worried. He liked when he smiled, when he showed just a little too much teeth and his eyes seemed to sparkle in silver ripples.
Draco frowned, staring at the bags of crisps hanging from the wall on the other side of the bar. “What way?” he asked.
He'd worked the whole weekend, doing his best to cover up the left-overs of his mental and physical breakdown. He hated being confronted with feelings that weren’t supposed to be there, feelings he was still convinced he didn’t feel properly, and yet - he did. He tried to ignore the intruding thoughts of Potter and the bloody Friday evening that had completely gone to shit. It was hopeless. And when Potter’s owl had turned up at the bank as Draco was still sat at his desk, working late and doing everything in his power to regain some control of his life and himself, his world almost toppled over again.
Harry grabbed a hold of him, forcing him to remain still, forcing him to keep himself turned towards Harry.
It was unfair. How did Potter always seem to get away with things? And why did his stomach still flutter, just from holding that awful little piece of parchment with those simple yet so powerful words written on them?
It took his breath away for a moment, before he allowed himself to fall. Harry caught him, his soft lips tracing every sharp contour of Draco’s body until they both had been divested of all their clothes. Harry laid there, his eyes lidded and glimmering as his chest rose and fell, his lips slightly parted and his black hair even more mussed than it usually was.
He’d been in the Knockturn Alleyway with the whore two days ago, but they had been completely alone, Draco had made sure of it. If it came out he’d been blown by a male prostitute, his father wouldn’t think it a mistress and the conversation they’d just had would have been very different and ended in a much less amicable way. It would be such a scandal his father wouldn’t have been able to stop it from being front page news, no matter what strings he pulled or how many people he bribed.
“Guess I have to, right?” Harry said. Draco looked up into the ceiling for a moment, sighing, before coming back and rolling his head on his shoulders, a grin still on his lips.
Draco waited patiently, nodding along and sipping on his tea as he stretched out in his chair, his tie loosened and his sleeves rolled up. Gemma was a close friend, after all, considering she was married to Blaise. They would have dinner together, the Malfoys, Zabinis, Notts, Goyles, Flints and Parkinsons. Sometimes Goldstein and his girlfriend would join them, along with Daphne whenever she was home from her travels in the Middle East and Northern Africa.
(See the end of the chapter for
When had he been seen? And by who?
Starman began playing and Draco smiled softly into his pint. He was ticked off, but music had a way of calming him, and considering the abhorrent music which was usually played in London’s gay bars or bars in general these day - for Bowie to come on, seemed almost like a sign of sorts.
This story was only supposed to be a short one-shot to distract me during my vacation. In a matter of days, it grew into a smaller monster that kept haunting me.
When he came home that night, he didn’t care for Fleetwood, nor prosecco. At first he sat in total silence, agonising over nothing and everything all at once. What his life had become. What he had done to deserve to be so fucking miserable and cynical he couldn’t even find some bloody joy in just sitting in his own flat.
The healers had managed to heal him completely, leaving no trace of his ‘incident’. He’d almost hoped for a black eye, swollen cheek or bloodied forehead - but no. Nothing. Just his usual slightly gaunt self with dark bags under his eyes and to sharp features, too many teeth behind his thin lips and collarbones that stood out as if his skeleton wished to escape his flesh.
“Need anything from the shop?” Draco asks. “I’ll let Kreacher have the night off. He must be exhausted by the little monsters.”
had changed. He was still a persona non grata in society at large, but everyone pretended he wasn't. They pretended it's all forgiven, that the Malfoys were reformed and again a part of Wizard Society, even though no one wanted anything to do with them unless they had to. Unless they needed financial advice.
His hair was beginning to grow too long. He should have it cut, the thought, but he wasn’t sure he really wanted to. He liked when it fell over his forehead when he bent over.
“Well, what are you waiting for?” Draco said, grinning sadistically as he gestured for her to pour. She said something, but Draco didn’t hear it - he was too occupied by the tickling sensation underneath his skin and the music still in his ears, shutting out all outside noise. With a pursed, sour expression, she poured his tea.
He looked gaunt, tired. His pointed features were made even more pronounced than usual in the sharp light and the dark bags underneath his eyes had started to show his age. He wasn't twenty anymore and it din’t bother him. Draco enjoyed growing older, growing more dignified and less bothered by things in general - or at least he imagined himself to be less bothered. He was a narcissistic bastard, still, even though the melodrama of his youth had escaped him with age. Though he despised his light complexion. It makes him ghost-like - Astoria claimed it was striking. Draco knew her lies.
“How do you even-“
“Master called,” Kreacher croaked, reminding Harry of the hunchback in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
“Very good, master. Liffy will prepare dinner for Mr. Potter as well.” Draco nodded and Liffy popped away.
The meeting was slow and honestly, unnecessary. The goblins droned on and on about margins and interests, calculations for the future and Gringotts’ assets in comparison to the general economy of the wizarding market. Nothing new was said, nothing ground-breaking or even just slightly different from how things had been for the last decade since Draco had started working in finance. By the end of the meeting, Draco had had too much tea and needed to take a piss and Blaise just looked like he wanted to be anywhere else. It was almost five thirty in the afternoon and Draco wouldn’t get anything else done today. Anything left would have to wait until Monday.
. And that wasn’t supposed to be possible. Draco wasn’t supposed to feel
Draco bit into Harry’s neck and kept thrusting into him, reaching down and wringing the last of Harry’s come from his cock. Soon, his own movements were beginning to become erratic and Draco couldn’t hold himself back anymore. Grabbing hold of Harry’s hair and leaning down into his neck, Draco decided he would just let go. Let everything fall, so he could fall with it.
people would deem ‘healthy’,” Draco paused to take a sip of his wine. “And… I am reluctant, Potter. About this. This… Whatever it is that we’re doing. How could I not be?”
The door to Draco’s flat slammed shut behind him and Harry leaned back against it, breathing heavily as he dragged his hands over his face, back again and through his hair.
Harry sat down in the sofa across from Draco. He hoped they’d be able to get through this lunch without a row. Without it ending in tears and blood. He didn’t even dare to bring the apology up, unless Draco did it first. Harry really tried not being an arse.
piss poor blowjob.
Draco shrugged, flicking his fag against the ashtray.
Potter shrugged. “I’m not saying we have to do it again, not that I’d mind, you know. But… Don’t you just want to get out? Be free?”
Harry winced. It seemed so bloody cold and he couldn’t help but to miss the Draco in joggers and a Deep Purple t-shirt from Friday. When he was dressed in his strict suits, he still wore his persona in such an obvious way.
Deciding it was time to push Potter into admitting what the fuck he was up to, Draco looked up from his beer and glanced at Potter.
Astoria knew it was useless. Once every week they do this, only to keep some semblance of intimacy. Perhaps she could become pregnant again. Draco hoped not and he was fairly sure Astoria took potions preventing her from becoming pregnant, seeing as she kept lovers of her own. Sporadic and in secret, though she wasn't nearly as discreet as she believed. Draco didn’t care and he knew his disinterest in her hurt her. His semi-open infidelities hurt her. Should she know it was men he preferred to stick his cock into, she’d probably demand a divorce.
Potter leaned his forehead against Draco’s, a sob raking through his throat. Draco turned his face away from Potter, looking out over his kitchen for a moment. The lights around them were dimmed, the whiteness of his kitchen laid in dark shadows that seemed to creep closer and closer, making Draco’s chest tighten and it felt harder and harder to breath. He just couldn’t take it. He couldn’t take it anymore.
Potter didn’t seem to care and just shrugged as he sat down beside Draco, his pint being placed in front of him. The bartender smiled and went to pour Draco’s second pint.
The very thought disgusted Draco. It felt unnatural and, in all honesty, undignified. Children, in general, were rather undignified due to the nature of them alone.
Gemma looked slightly put off for a moment, before she leaned back.
Well, even if it was, his official dealings with Draco would soon be over, as he’d not heard anything else from Gemma. Hopefully, the settlements could be reached quickly and Ginny wouldn’t object to the financial plans Draco and Gemma had drawn up. It was difficult to tell, really. Harry knew nothing of finances and cared even less. There was a reason financial advisors were in great need, after all.
Potter sat looking at one of his larger art pieces that he’d bought in Berlin five years ago. He’d housed it in the manor to begin with, in the west wing where he lived with Astoria. She’d hated the piece however and seemed happier than anything when Draco had bought his flat and brought the painting with him. It had been inspired by Andy Warhol’s short film “Blow job” and showed the darkened profile of a man - possibly - receiving fellatio with a fag resting between his lips. But, Draco supposed it was a point of interpretation. Draco’s father hadn’t liked it much.
Harry sighed, pushing his finished plate away and before he could stop himself, the words were out of his mouth. “Do you have to make it so very difficult? You’re absolutely impossible, you know.”
“It bothers you, does it?” Draco asked and Harry wanted to deny it, but it just felt silly. Of course it bothered him. Sure, he could still see the slightly paler mark still left on his own left hand from a ring that’d been there for ten years.
“Oh, god.” Harry sighed, “Not this again? Fuck off with your bloody suffering, 'bad boy deserves to never again be happy', Draco.” Harry rose and walked around the counter, stopping next to Draco and forcing him to face Harry. “The past is in the past, things are as they are and they happened because they did. You deserve happiness, Draco, just like everyone else. And I…”
It was easy to see the differences in this persona and the relaxed, at-home-Draco. Here was the professional, blank and cold Draco. The person people saw but never got to know. Harry knew it was far from the real Draco and he loathed the coldness he spread around him. It was a simulated personality Draco had created to protect himself, and Harry knew well he carried some part in this persona’s creation.
Had Draco been ten years younger, he might have left right then and there and just thrown himself into Potter’s arms, forgiving him. But the past ten years had soured Draco’s perception of love as not only a notion, but he only saw the damnation it left in its wake.
“You don’t miss your son?” Potter raised an eyebrow.
? I’m very sorry Mr. Potter-“
“Doesn’t stop you from fucking around, does it?”
Draco left a few pound notes with Pansy before shrugging on his coat and wrapping the scarf around his neck.
He really did have a meeting that afternoon with his co-workers and the goblins. Goblins where in reality horrid little creatures, nasty to work with and generally insufferable in their inability to even try to understand human customs. But they paid well and Gringotts where the only wizarding bank in Britain. There existed wizarding banks that was owned by humans, the largest one could be found in Russia, but Draco did not feel like learning Russian and he definitely didn’t feel like moving to Russia either. Though, he had visited as a part of his job and found the thought of it, in a theoretical sense to be interesting.
“Are you serious, Potter?” Draco rounded on him, pulling his arm away from Potter’s grip. Fuck making a scene, fuck headlines. “No, wait. Of course, you are. So vainglorious, so caught up in yourself, aren’t you, Potter? Just leave it, will you?”
“Right,” Draco said as he entered the former drawing room. “I like it. Turning it into a combined living room and dining room. Suits it, actually.”
“I’m sorry,” Potter said, reaching for Draco. But Draco stepped away, leaving Potter to grab the air. “Listen to me, Draco.” Potter continued, backing Draco against the wall. “I’m an arse, yeah. A fucking coward. Still am, in many ways. It’s fucking shitty of me and I’m not fucking proud of hiding it away like that. I’m not… But,” Potter reached out, his fingers brushing into Draco’s hair as Potter pressed himself against Draco, holding him in place with his body. Draco didn’t know why he didn’t just shove his knee into Potter’s crotch right then and there, but he didn’t. “I’ve thought of you for ten years.
He got three days off work, which annoyed him to no end.
Draco felt a cold shiver down his spine as he watched his father with a neutral expression. The jab about his mother’s nerves was uncalled for, certainly, but Draco remained silent, which was always a better card to play when it came to his father’s rage, at least until you knew what he was on about.
Harry reached out, letting his hand trail over Draco’s chest and down, down, down. Draco drew in a sharp breath, shivering as Harry’s hand reached the bulge in his briefs.
“I see.” Draco leaned his elbow on the bar, his head in his hand as he looked anywhere but at Potter.
Draco steps outside into the misty London air, locks the door and puts his headphones on. He shuffles through his iPod, letting it chose the track for him this time.
Harry loved watching him. It was difficult to keep his eyes away, even as they ate in silence. Draco was just eye-catching and it pained Harry that he never could be fully his. He’d been too late, too scared. The wedding band adorning Draco’s left hand shone with its golden glimmer and even though Harry knew it was a sham of a marriage, it still stung him to see the ring on Draco’s finger.
“Kreacher still around?” Draco asked, still standing with his beautiful back towards Harry. His shoulders broad but skinny and his hips slim.
“Please…” at this point, he was just begging. Draco could throw him to the wind and he wouldn’t care. He’d take what Draco would give him. What did he have to lose, anyway?
Draco raised his eyebrows, clearing his throat. “Well, as I am just that, I suppose you’ve come to the right place. However,” Draco leaned back in his chair and crossed his leg over his knee and made sure his face was cold, haughty. “Normally you’d book an appointment.”
He was still drunk from too many glasses of whisky, and he staggered as he scrubbed his skin clean from imagined dirt. His sluggishness didn’t stop him from leaning against the tiled wall, his breathing heavy and strained as he let his hand wander down between his legs, stroking back and forth as the heat from the water sprayed against his skin. If he imagined eyes too green with hair too black and tanned skin beneath him, he did so without acknowledging it. He just had his wank, easily reaching his release before grabbing the shower handle from above him, stumbling slightly from drunkenness and post-orgasm breathlessness and rinsing off his spunk before crashing into bed, his hair still wet and his breath stinking like a bloody brewery.
Harry’s blood was boiling. It had been ever since Gemma told him about Ginny’s statement, or rather, her claim. Harry hadn’t been with
“…And so I told him,” Pansy said, poking about in her Ceasar Salad, pushing the bacon to the side of the dish. “That it couldn’t have been from Hugo the Terrible, because he lived during the great unicorn famine in the 8th century and back then they didn’t even use glass-shards to contain-“ Pansy snapped her fingers in Draco’s face and he jumped slightly in his seat, his grey eyes landing on her dark ones. “You’re not even listening to me, you prat.”
He’d gone clubbing with Blaise and Pansy in muggle London before he got married. He seldom went out now, as Astoria would whinge and nag him silly about ‘responsibilities’ if she found out. He did find himself in pubs and bars, sitting at the bar in silence drinking muggle whisky, searching for some handsome muggle to fuck in the toilets if possible. But he was on his own then, as he was far from open about his sexuality to anyone.
“So, Mr Potter,” Gemma said with a wry smile as they sat down and the secretary had poured them all tea. “Your hearing is tomorrow. I’ve been informed about Mrs Potter’s solicitor and I’ve been in contact with her. She’s not a bad one, I’d say, but I can assure you,” Gemma smiled, “I’m better.”
Draco excused himself and left the chamber, walking down the darkly tiled hall before taking a sharp left and walking into the loos. Making sure he was alone, he leaned back against the wall, waiting. Less than a minute later, Potter stepped inside and Draco spelled the door locked behind Potter, before crashing his lips against Potter’s.
“You deserve it.” Draco’s voice was a whisper as he spoke. He didn’t know how he managed to form the words. They pained him and at the same time, he was so angry he could have screamed if his body allowed it. It didn’t. He hardly heard his own voice.  “You fucking deserve it.”
me, your financial advisor and former bully.”
Harry wasn’t an idiot. He knew his money could sustain them for generations on, which they had already done for the Potters, and Sirius’ money had kept the Black’s secure for god knows how long. But it wasn’t right that Ginny would get half. That should go straight to his kids.
. To be as normal as possible in the eyes of society but still retaining that touch of inaccessibility that belongs to the upper class. This means getting married, doing your duty, produce at least one (male) heir and make sure you find yourself in an influential position with a job that makes people look up to you. And; to do it well - or else. Draco would like to see his father come at him with his cane now.
Draco lights what he’s promised Harry to be his last fag. He’s sitting in the back garden of 12 Grimmauld Place. He told Astoria yesterday he’s selling the flat over by Hyde Park. He also told her about Potter.
Draco rolled his eyes and sat back down, sipping on his own wine, before remembering to call for Liffy.
“I can remove it, if it bothers you.” Draco frowned, putting his cutlery down. “I think you know there’s no love lost between me and my wife.”
“Spoil sport.” Draco scowls. “See you in a bit.”
Draco hardly daydreams about murdering his co-workers anymore and he finds that he can actually listen to what others have to say. He’s even sat through weekly lunches with Pansy for the last two months without completely zooning out, which in itself is an absolute miracle, if he’s being honest. He allowed himself several pats on the back for that alone. Their lunches are fulfilling and every time he laughs, he can see a sparkle in Pansy’s eyes that hasn’t been there since they were kids. He likes it.
“I recognise this song, actually,” Harry said with a frown as he leaned back against a side table close to the brown sofa he’d sat in before. “I inherited a few records from Sirius you know. But, it was another version. Jimi-something?”
Changing into a loose pair of joggers he wouldn’t be seen dead in outside his flat and a Deep Purple band shirt, Draco opened his fridge and looked inside.
“Potter. What a surprise.” Draco said through clenched teeth. “What can I help you with?”
“Malfoy,” Gemma bit out through clenched jaws, obviously holding herself back while looking concerned as she glanced at Potter, who now looked less gone in his own thoughts and instead more present, out-right furious and ready to leave. “Why would you say something like
Harry was a bit speechless, honestly. “She wouldn’t.” Harry said and as he looked up from the scroll Draco had given him. Ass he looked at Gemma and Draco both, he realised she might. They looked slightly worried and he didn’t care for that at all.
Potter looked around, humming as he shoved off his boots and hung his jacket and scarf on the hatstand beside the door.
“The Malfoys became Anglican during Henry VIII like a majority of the English nobility at the time. Never thought much about it to be fair. We seldom follow religious customs and adhere more to Wizarding traditions like most pure-bloods.”
“I, uh,” Potter began, pulling his hand through his messy hair. It looked good and Draco was absolutely certain Potter was well aware of it too. “I just wanted to thank you, for this… I know it’s awkward, considering - well, you know.”
The realisation in itself was painful and disgusted Draco. It disgusted him what he’d done to himself, what he’d put others through. But it still scared him to embrace the change, letting the realisation work its way through him and forcibly bend Draco into some sort of self-acceptance.
Harry moaned and when Draco held himself up against the headboard of the bed, quickening his pace, changing the position slightly, Draco must have hit the right spot for Harry, as he and a given a few more pushes and without warning, Harry came all over his stomach.
A sudden gasp came from his left and Draco wished he hadn’t woken up.
Things… Hadn’t gone to plan. Not that Harry ever really had a plan to begin with, with most things that he did. He usually just went for it and hoped for the best. But Draco was different than all other things he’d done in his life so far.
He ignored the people when he entered Gringotts. He ignored the people in the lift. And he definitely ignored his assistant as she spoke to him. He didn’t listen, didn’t even take his headphones off as he shut the door in her face, again, dropping his satchel on a chair and shrugging out of his coat and replacing it with hiss robes. He sat down in his chair and leaned back, listening to his music.
He couldn’t even begin to consider what Potter might want from him aside from his financial advice. The whole situation was awkward enough as it was. For Potter to approach him outside of their meetings only made Draco feel uncomfortable.
, don’t do the same thing to me.”
. “Are you telling me you honestly believe I need to fucking try it before I’ll even know? What the fuck’s wrong with you, Draco?”
After his father left, Draco sank down in his chair, still warm from his father. He lit another cigarette and leaned back, drawing the smoke deep into his lungs as he stared up into the ceiling.
Rolling his eyes, Draco cocked his head, pulling out his pocket watch and snapping it open. “Anyway Pans, I have a meeting at half past. We’ll have to continue discussing your shards another day.”
Pulling on his gloves as he reaches the pavement, Draco looks up into the sky, and beyond the wet mist, he can see the sun trying to find its way through the clouds as Bowie’s voice sounds in his ears.
Standing in front of the same mirror he’d crashed his head into - now completely repaired by Liffy, Draco stared at himself. A cigarette hung from between his lips as he traced his forehead with careful fingers.
“What are you doing in a gay bar, anyway?” he asked, his voice remaining low, acidic in its sharpness. “As I remember it, you’re ‘straight’.”
. He’d gone from obsessing over Potter, to obsess over being what wizard society deemed ‘normal’. Draco had silently accepted the fact that he’d have to life a tortured life, that he didn’t
With a deep sigh, Draco sank down in his Jetson armchair, balancing his whisky on his thigh, closing his eyes and just letting Steve Harley’s dramatic voice take him over.
with their lives. Draco’s not sure he wants to do anything at all.
“Until tomorrow,” Potter repeated and Draco unlocked the door, stepping out.
“No,” Harry said. “I won’t.”
and want pulled at him. When he’d regained some semblance of control over himself, he was pushing Potter up against the wall inside the hallway, his hand around Potter’s neck and hips lips hovering just over Potter’s. And Draco found that he had lost. He didn’t
12 Grimmauld Place did still have a lot of work to be done, even though he’d spent countless weekends renovating it. Now, most floors had been done by, painted in light colours and the lingering dark magic had been removed. Walburga’s portrait hadn’t been easy to remove and Harry had to get help from Bill to at least manage to move the still screeching woman to the attic.
“My watch,” Potter said, holding his wrist up, lifting one eyebrow. “Got it on my seventeenth birthday. Didn’t you get a watch?”
“Easy there, tiger.” The dyke said with a sly smile, giving Potter a wink and Draco loves her and hates her and everyone inside this normally nice establishment that’s now polluted by Potter at the same time.
, Draco. I’ve regretted what I did every day, but I’ve been too cowardly. So please…
Bowie’s Station to Station sounded in Draco’s headphones as he stepped out of the floo at the Ministry. He never liked being here as it reminded him of his own trials. It seemed he reminded others of his trials as well, considering the way people stared at him as he walked towards the lift, easily falling into the long cue of people needing to get to one of the too many underground levels.
Draco snorted.
Draco doesn’t comprehend what’s happening at first. But Potter’s hand is on his shoulder, then his neck - and then his lips are on Draco’s. It’s panic and lust and fright and every strange kind of unwelcome non-feeling come at once. Potter’s lips are too full against his thin ones. His lips are too warm against Draco’s cold lips. And at the same time, they feel absolutely wonderful and Draco can’t help but to kiss back. Potter’s tongue flicks against his lower lip and Draco opens up, accepts him inside. It’s been so long, so bloody long.
”Mrs Potter might wish to include the worth of your London house into the settlement. Seeing as 12 Grimmauld Place is worth almost twice the estimated sum of Godric’s Hollow, I’ve prepared documents which notes the inheritance of 12 Grimmauld Place comes from your late Godfather. The issues here though,” Draco now frowned and pushed a parchment toward Harry, his fingers long and spider-like, “Should she wish to, Ginevra might claim closer relations to the Black family, through her paternal grandmother, which would make it easier for her to claim your London property, as you did not have a pre-marital settlement.”
“Deep Purple’s debut album from ’68.” Draco said as he took the bottle of wine from Harry and lead him into the living room. It looked just the same as it had done that Friday. The
“Where’s Potter?” Draco looked around the hall, but couldn’t see his tousled head of hair anywhere. People prattled about, hurrying from one end to the other, some standing like he and Gemma, talking silently to each other. Then, another set of red hair showed up and stopped beside Arthur. Ginevra.
He pulled his eyes away from Potter’s tanned skin and the way his Adam’s apple bobbed in his throat as he swallowed. Shame filled him as he noticed how Potter’s messy hair curls around his ears and neck.
He was so sick of it, the shallowness. It wasn’t just boring, dull. It was frustrating and horrible in so many ways he hardly knew himself where to start.
Draco gestured to the kitchen and rose. Potter followed. With another snap of her fingers, Liffy had prepared the table, plating the pasta for them both. She had brough newly baked bread, as well as Italian olive oil and grated parmesan cheese. The pasta was a simple affair, but smelled heavenly. Liffy knew exactly what Draco preferred, and he preferred simple, always simple. It was a light tomato sauce with diced guanciale, just a touch of white onion and basil. Draco accioed the bottle of wine from the living room and refilled his own glass and Potters, before thanking Liffy.
“Yeah,” he said then, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. As if it wasn’t completely absurd to begin with, not to imagine what others would say. Then again, why should other people know? Not everything needed to be public knowledge. But it was a futile notion, so why even contemplate it?
Potter looks… Like Potter. His unruly black hair is messy and he looks as if he hasn’t shaved in at least a week. It pained Draco to admit that it suited him. He was dignified in his all-black auror robes and clothes, and it gave his tall, athletic body a casual but still uniform seriousness most people would find difficult to pull off. His green eyes were starkly bright beneath his round glasses, against his tanned skin and Draco hated it.
Draco felt dumbfounded for a moment as he contemplated Potter’s words.
Draco turned slightly and Potter stood beside him, glaring at the man sitting to Draco’s left, who now looked stricken, but backed off.
And third, why even worry about the children not getting what they were due? It was easily regulated in both muggle and wizarding law, especially if there was no bastard children involved.
Steve Harley and the Cockney Rebel - Sebastian
“You’ll pay for that later.” Potter says as he licks his lips. Draco can’t help the slight grin that plays over his own lips for a short second.
“I know,” Draco said as smoke rippled out in waves from his nostrils and mouth. “I’m still deciding.”
Ignoring his rumbling stomach, Draco went to his liquor cabinet and poured himself a firewhisky before he went to put a record on the turntable. Bowie’s Diamond Dogs called to him with its bizarre, surrealistic cover and after skipping the first two songs, he sat down in his Jetson with his whisky and closed his eyes, just enjoying the dystopian hopelessness the music conveyed as he tried to just breath. Tried to come to terms with his reality.
He failed to see the importance of them. Failed to remember, even though his mother insisted there were times when they were happy, when things were easier. But when was that? He's tried to recall more than two hundred times since the war (yes, he'd keep count). Aside from a pre-Dark Lord childhood, he fail to find the good memories his mother insisted on.
He was well aware of how unprofessional it was to act as he had towards Draco. Not only because Draco was his financial advisor at the moment, and
Arthur had been by to collect the kids just fifteen minutes earlier. And Harry stopped breathing for a moment, as Ginny continued. “I can’t do this anymore, Harry. And I know you can’t either. You and I, we love each other. But we haven’t been in love with each other for a long time.”
It was what people brought to dates, right? Harry wasn’t sure. He wasn’t even sure it was a bloody date to begin with, but - he decided not to even mention it. It wasn’t as if Draco didn’t have any humour. He did. It was just… Very dry and not even close to as infantile as Harry’s humour could be. Harry and Ron liked to joke about bollocks, after all.
Astoria had once told him he looked like Bowie after she’d gone through some of his albums with a slightly dumbfounded expression on her face. He supposed he couldn’t disagree all together, though his features were more pointed. But it was a nice compliment from her, nonetheless.
He’s still cold on the outside, but Harry accepts that. Just like Draco accepts the fact that Harry’s a blunt buffoon severely lacking in table manners most of the time. It gives a certain spice to everyday life, he supposes. But, Harry makes him happy. As happy as someone like Draco can be. If it’s happiness as defined by others, he doesn’t know. And, in all honesty, he doesn’t care about other people’s definition of happiness anymore. It drains him too much and gives very little in return.
Friday, Harry had decided to call it. He didn’t know how else to think on it and he’d rather not remember it at all, if he was perfectly honest.
Harry’s mouth went dry. “
Potter gave a nod and sat down, leaning back in his chair and spreading his legs wide. It only ticked Draco off even more than Potter’s mere presence in his office and Draco straightened in his chair, clearing his throat.
“Oh?” Harry frowned. What issues? And why didn’t he hear of it until now, a day before the hearing?
. What was Harry have supposed to do?
Draco snorted. “Wizard music is terrible. I’ll never admit to having said it, but with music, muggles do it better. By far.”
“How old is he?”
Draco tried not to roll his eyes and instead plastered on that bloody smile he’d worked at for years now and still failed at, every time.
Opening the door, it became obvious that it wasn’t his neighbour from the door next to his. It was Potter, standing there with his hands in his pockets, looking delicious enough to devour and Draco found he still hated him as much as he had just the other day.
Now, he’d settled in fine at the old headquarters. Harry had spent much time doing repairs there during the years, in many ways to get a pause from family life, and now it seemed almost ironic that all through his marriage, he had used the renovation of his future home as an escape. A home where he would start anew, without his family. Without Ginny.
He wants to tell his assistant to tell Potter to fuck off.
He sighed, releasing the ropes and letting his robe fall open. He saw Astoria’s eyes fall on his exposed body and he felt disgusted. “Do as I say, please.
James and Albus had taken it better than Harry had thought. Lily didn’t understand what was happening and was so used to spending a majority of her time with Ginny anyway. But James and Albus, they sort of understood. Perhaps not fully, but when Harry and Ginny had sat down with them, they’d listened,
“Since you own both properties together,” Draco continued, clasping his hands on the desk. Harry could smell the faint scent of cigarettes coming from Draco as he spoke. Harry had never liked the smell, but there was just something about that lingering scent that did something to him.
“Right.” Draco said, utterly unconvinced.
. It was a historical fiction he’d gotten from Pansy last Christmas, written by a colleague of hers that had spent several years in Egypt digging up old vampire’s scrolls. So far, Draco didn’t hate the book, so he decided a couple of pages along with his wine before dinner couldn’t hurt.
“Right.”
Ian Brown - Corpses in Their Mouths
“Mm,” Harry hums, giving him a wink before he turns back to James and his assignment. Draco looks back over his shoulder and is pleased to see that Albus has indeed started on Harry’s settlement papers, but with every other stroke of his crayon, he misses the paper and just draws on the table instead.
, Draco sighs, casting a glance at his partner, before he lifts Albus off the floor, flicking a remaining crayon from his sticky and chubby hand, depositing the little beast on the kitchen table next to Harry’s divorce settlement papers.
“Rumours which naturally are untrue. Part of yet another campaign by the Prophet and their gossip mongering tail to smear our family.” His father’s grey eyes stared into Draco’s and Draco had to hold his breath to keep from shivering. “I honestly do not care what you do in your spare time, Draco. But need I remind you that you
“Bollocks,” Draco said, draining the last of his pint, ordering another. “Put these on him.” He told the bartender, pointing at Potter, who simply shrugged in agreement. “See,” Draco said, “This is
“Certainly master Draco! When should Liffy bring master his food?”
When he arrived back at his flat to enjoy his Friday night with a neat record and a good book accompanied by a glass of Merlot, an owl was waiting by his window, clutching a scroll.
“W-what?” Harry felt his cheeks heat even more as he met Ginny’s eyes for a moment before looking away.
“I hate you, you know.” Draco said, his voice soft, breathy.
Potter gave a satisfied sigh as he dug in, giving Draco a small wink that almost made Draco blush where he sat, twirling the long spaghetti on his fork.
It seems Harry needn’t have worried as much as he had. Draco, dressed in the same expensive suit with a robe over his shirt and the golden pocket watch in place, extended his hand without a sliver of doubt. His face was still blank and utterly professional as Harry looked into his grey eyes and his cold hand was steady, no-nonsense.
Draco seemed to notice where Harry’s eyes rested and he looked down on his left hand, frowning. He looked back up at Harry with a raised eyebrow.
“So,” Harry felt his throat going dry, looking around for a moment, not sure if he should be so bloody blunt as he’d been in the past. It was always like threading a fine line with Draco.
Potter had the decency not to follow him and Draco arrived back at his flat feeling exhausted. He leaned back against the door, his head swimming slightly - not from only from the alcohol - but from the absolutely bizarre and too candid conversation he’d just had.
“Wha-“ Harry stuttered and had to shake himself out of his idiotic stupor.
“I wasn’t taught anything about sexuality when I was a kid, aside from the ‘normal’ kind, you know,” Potter said, thumbing the coaster, “And when I came to Hogwarts, it was all heterosexuality or nothing. Mainly nothing. Keep your hands inside your trousers until you’re seventeen and you can marry your sweetheart.” He sighs. “And I dated Cho, then Ginny. Then the war came - and after, there was you. I was confused. I don’t know what to say, if I’m completely honest.”
“You live close by. I got lucky.” He said, finally.
Draco spluttered, honest to god - spluttered, where he sat, dressed in sodding joggers and a Deep Purple t-shirt. After Potter had asked him if he wanted to fuck Potter.
“What?” Draco’s eyebrows were low as he looked at Harry.
When Draco pulled away from him, straddling Harry’s hips without any distracting grinding movement and just watching Harry, Harry realised Draco’s eyes were glimmering. He had a faint feeling of déjà vu, which wouldn’t in itself have been that strange considering that they’d fumbled about together in the darkness before, but then it hit Harry that it had been ages ago - and this was the first time he was on a bed with Draco.
Potter gave a wry smile as he looked away from the painting and remained quiet as they sat listening to Jim Morrison’s voice and the surface noise crackle on the old record.
Visiting gay bars and kissing Draco in a gay bar.
“Really…?” Harry said somewhat ironically as he cut into his cod, the flesh flaking beneath his knife. “You don’t say.”
He hadn’t cooked food himself in about three months, resulting in the sight of two rotten potatoes and a half eaten jar of jam. Maybe he should clean up his act a bit in that department. But then again, why? He was still a wizard with a smaller army of house elves at the snap of his fingers.
“Go fuck yourself, Potter.” Draco swiped his napkin over his lips before he grabbed his glass of wine and took an aggressive sip.
Bowie’s voice went on about the Starman in the background - an alien who looked down on earth wanting to come in contact with the people he saw by sending them messages of cosmic jazz, and Ronson’s guitar echoed alongside Bowie’s voice in the best kind of way. Potter’s eyes looked almost alien as he turned to Draco, his full lips worked by his teeth as he seemed to hesitate for a moment.
In the back garden, Draco feels at peace. He does feel at peace quite often these days and it’s not all due to the fact that he spends an ungodly amount of time out here, mainly smoking, pretending Harry doesn’t notice.
“Get on your hands and knees,” Draco said as he began to untie the ropes of his robe.
“I didn’t want to bring it up, but…” Harry winced at his own idiocy - but he supposed he’d already begun so he might as well just throw himself overboard and get at it. “Did you get my letter?”
He didn’t have a meeting with Malfoy in the next two weeks, and unless Malfoy spoke to Gemma Zabini about what he did during his private time, Monday morning at her office would be fine. Or, it would be bloody awkward.
Draco’s mother insist his father loves him. Draco does not believe her. Lucius Malfoy love only himself, if he’s even capable of that. It’s doubtful and in the end, it doesn’t matter to Draco anymore whether his father loves or not. If anything, it seemed to be another thing he inherited. The narcissism, the coldness and complete incapability to truly care for others.
“According to the statements from Mrs Potter’s solicitor that I received this morning, it seems Mrs Potter is claiming infidelity as cause for the divorce. Infidelity, on your part, Mr Potter.”
Or both.
When their lips met and moved, hands searching and finding warmth underneath clothing, Harry could feel his magic reaching out, meeting Draco’s. By the sharp intake of breath he could hear from Draco, Harry was certain he’d felt it too. Harry could feel his fingers crackle when he reached under Draco’s shirt and traced his sides while their tongues touched as their kisses deepened.
Harry was sure Draco had put his napkin on his lap, whilst Harry just kept it beside is plate. But he tried not to speak with his mouth full, at least. No matter what Draco called him, aunt Petunia had drilled some manners into him, Harry just didn’t care. However, it was obvious that Draco did, so the least Harry could do was to keep his mouth closed as he chewed. His elbows, however, were still on the table, because - well, just because he could.
“Yes, Lily.” Potter nodded slowly, watching Draco with those damned eyes of his. “She was… Somewhat of a surprise. But, I’ve always wanted a daughter.”
Draco looked down on Harry and felt his chest tighten. He’d never really cared for other people, or their feelings. He’d never looked at another human being before and realised he loved their smile. Loved their scent and the way their skin felt under his fingers. The way their lips felt against his own, or how a simple blow job could make him feel something more but a desire to have the favour returned.
He had just wanted to see him. To poke that long winding ache just a little, see if he’d still felt that stirring inside him at the sight of him.
Draco slicked back his hair, eying himself in the mirror with a pleased expression before he considered himself acceptable. Tailored wool trousers, a buttoned-up shirt and a scarf, all in black along with boots and an expensive muggle wrist watch, he could easily blend in amongst the muggles that frequented bars close to his neighbourhood.
After another moment of silence, just nervously getting used to touch Draco like this and having Draco’s more sure hands on his body, Harry decided that,
It was obvious even for someone like Harry that Draco was dressed in an extremely expensive black three-piece suit that hugged his body in just the right places, with a hand-tailored robe resting over his shoulders. He wore golden cuffs by his wrists and a matching pocket watch with a chain that gleamed beneath his robes. He was still so pale he looked sickly in too yellow light and his eyes would appear bizarre if you were unused to them, but to Harry, he looked more like some bloody angel that you weren’t completely sure if he was truly a man, and it just didn’t matter. He had such fine features, slim hands with long fingers, thin lips with just a tad too much teeth behind them, which only ever gave his looks more character. And Harry had wanted him just as much in that moment that he had ten years ago, but been too cowardly to admit he did - and he still wanted him just as much as he walked away from Draco’s building.
“If it’s not too much trouble.” Potter said and sipped his wine, crossing his leg over his knee, still glancing around himself at the art.
And then Potter had fucking crushed him all over again. And Draco had to stand there, in front of the entire Wizengamot and Ministry, gratefully just taking it like a whore as Potter basically saved his whole family because he was afraid of what? That Draco might open his mouth about what they had done?
Draco rose from his chair and walked around the table, his hand reaching forward and stroking Harry’s hair. Before Harry could even say something more, Draco’s lips brushed against his and Harry was again completely wrapped around Draco’s fingers.
“Fuck off, Potter.” Draco said, but Harry could both hear and see the slight smile on his lips.
He was trying to calm himself. Trying to shut out the world around him so he could escape into his daydreams. Daydreams that are just that, unreal and wishes never to be fulfilled. Dreams of some kind of unattainable freedom far away from the life he’d been given to live. Dreams of an escape, of just telling the people around him to fuck off, of leaving everything.
things. Feelings were beneath him, especially feelings about a good buggering from a man who was supposed to be his bloody arch nemesis.
“Yes?” Draco looked at him, the glass of wine in one hand as he leaned back against the chair, a strand of hair falling over his forehead.
“Come on, Potter. I’ll get you home.” Draco said and Harry wasn’t sure if he was supposed to laugh or cry. Instead, for some bizarre reason, the only thing he could think of as Draco hoisted his business satchel over his shoulder and gripped Harry’s arm with both hands, was David Bowie’s ‘Changes’. He didn’t even know where the thought came from, or where he’d heard the song. Maybe one of Sirius’ old records, who knows?
He picked up the quill and scribbled down his apology. Harry wasn’t great with words and his handwriting was atrocious. It took him five tries before he just said ‘fuck it’ and blew on the ink to dry it before he rolled it up and sealed it with wax.
Paul Simon’s voice did make him walk a little faster and it seemed as if the cloudy London morning shone brighter as Draco nodded along to “Call me Al”. It was followed by Fine Young Cannibals and Draco marvelled as he so often did now, how wonderful muggle music could be. It was an interest he’d found after the war and it had helped him in finding himself again.
“What are you listening to?” Potter asked as Draco walked from the hallway and back into the living room.
His father plastered on the very same false smile as Draco usually gave his co-workers.
Harry shoved the thought aside and cracked open a beer as he went through his CD collection, deciding on Hellacopter’s High Visibility as a good soundtrack for some DIY projects he needed to get to this weekend. It was better than wallowing in misery. If he started letting thoughts like that take over, he wouldn’t be able to leave his bed.
In his dreams, his brain had betrayed him, showing him tousled black hair and startling green eyes. He could still feel the touch of Potter’s beard against his skin from his dream and Draco wanted to throw something against the wall. For
Potter?’
Potter seemed unperturbed, smiling. “Hi.”
He enjoyed travelling around Europe looking for art and he especially enjoyed spending time in Scandinavia. The minimalism from the 1960’s was a favourite of his and he’d spent a couple of weeks with a gorgeous Italian muggle who lived in Copenhagen last year, hunting for what was now his dinner table - a Danish teak classic in pristine condition from 1964. His mother thought him absurd and his father wished he’d just spend all his time in the manor, like a proper and respectable husband and father.
“You’re somewhat of a masochist, aren’t you?”
Potter only nodded sharply, again staring into Draco’s books.
One, get piss drunk and firecalling Ginny, crying his heart out before he passed out in his bed, soaking himself in tears and his crushed pride, along with an honest to god bloody broken heart.
This, with Harry, it changed
All this anger, all these fantasies to hind behind. He couldn’t take it anymore.
Draco woke up some time after midnight with a disgusting taste in his mouth and his skin itching. His neck hurt and he felt nauseous.
“Everything under control on your end?” She asked and Draco nodded.
“Bloody hell,” Draco rolls his eyes and leaves the kitchen, walking upstairs into the ground floor hallway.
“Yes?” Draco finally managed to grit out, holding his chin high as he looked down his nose at Potter.
David Bowie - Modern Love
“Oh, I’m sure.” Draco answers. “When’s Ginny getting here?”
“I did, yes.”
“You don’t mean that, surely, do you Draco?” His mother said, looking over him with a falsely sweet smile on her lips. “Astoria, be a darling and tell the nurse we’d like some tea. You know how Draco gets in the mornings. Don’t you worry yourself, dear.” His mother’s eyes lowered from his wife to his own with clear warning in them. Draco shivered and looked up at the roof as his mother grasped his hand. When Astoria had left, his mother squeezed his hand. “She has to put up with enough of your indiscretions, don’t push her away further, Draco.”
Draco was different from most others in that he’d been so very close to the dark magic during such a long period of his adolescence. He’d been exposed to horrific things, seen things most people wouldn’t recover from. Just like Harry. And still - they were so very alike in parts, but also so very different.
Draco sighed, feeling his heart break for the thousand time. Finally he deflated, all of him. From his stiff neck and shoulders down to his toes. If he only could, he’d love to snog Potter - or any man - outside of this bar. Hold his bloody hand in Diagon Alley, to go out to dinner with him without people staring. He’d love to share his life with a man, to be able to bring him home to his parents, like he’d brought Astoria home. But it isn’t possible, is it?
It was one of Ginny’s favourite films and Harry had watched it with her several times. It had some great music in it, and for a moment, Harry couldn’t help but to wonder if Draco had seen it. He seemed to like muggle music, after all.
smearing it with sauce from his plate.
. Harry let him hesitate, let him hold him there, strangling him slowly with his thin but surprisingly strong finers. If Draco wished to cut off his air, he could easily do so. Harry relaxed in his grip and just looked into Draco’s grey eyes.
Draco’s hands reached out to Harry’s trousers, working at the fly and soon, he had a hand cupped against Harry’s straining cock and Harry had to pull his lips away from Draco’s, just to make sure this was what he wanted. To make sure it was okay. He wouldn’t hurt Draco again - didn’t want to be the arse anymore.
Draco thanked his elf and swallowed the potion. Within minutes, he was dead to the world.
He wasn’t even going to ask what it was he was doing here. To be honest, he wasn’t even sure he wanted to know. It wasn’t decent. Their kiss had been improper considering Draco acted as Potter’s financial advisor during his divorce - and showing up like this, here - on a Friday evening as if they were the best of mates, or even, as if they were dating, was highly improper and Draco was fairly certain Potter wasn’t thick enough not to understand it. But as usual, the Golden Boy played by his own rules - fuck everyone else.
He crossed his arms over his chest. He saw a flash of his dark mark in the corner of his eye and hadn’t even reflected on the fact that he’d had it in full view of Potter all the time since he arrived.
aside from Ginny during all of their marriage. Sure, he had dabbled with
Draco frowned, holding his glass of wine between his fingers. Harry could tell he was conflicted. Draco wasn’t one to open up about things. He kept most things to himself and it wasn’t difficult for Harry to understand that over the years, that part of Draco had only grown stronger. If it was due to being scared of letting people become too close, a sort of defense mechanism due to the obvious trauma Draco - along with so many others - had been through during the war, Harry didn’t rightly know. He’d never asked. All of it, what he knew of Draco, was in a sense, simply estimated guesses from a different time, when they had both been different persons.
Draco looked at Harry, biting into his lower lip, almost looking like a sleek, fantastical predator, hunched over Harry.
Ignoring the fact that he himself had only been able to get Draco’s mother pregnant once, Draco almost threw his cup of tea at his silent but very much judgemental father at the breakfast table. It didn’t matter that it was all in his head, he could see in his father’s eyes, he meant it. He’d always blamed Draco’s mother for being unable to carry more children.
The small smile gracing Draco’s lips was beyond beautiful and Harry was certain he swooned, which was embarrassing. “Yes. I’ll try not to ignore your owls, hm?”
Looking back at Potter, Draco twirled his glass of wine in is hand, trying to handle it like the frail thing it was, without just losing his shit and throwing it into the wall in pure frustration.
His mother gasped, smacking him over the face. “Don’t say such things, Draco!”
“What’s this about, Potter?” Draco said, falling into step with Potter as they exited Gemma’s small office building in the south part of Diagon Alley.
cigarettes, yeah?”
Potter chuckles, shaking his head. “Get whatever you like. Your choice. But
“I can’t change time.”
“Sod off, Potter.” Draco sneered, flicking his cigarette into the sink, beginning to pull away.
It shouldn’t have surprised him that Arthur stepped out on the same floor as Draco and continued in the very same direction. It wasn’t until Draco arrived at the large wooden doors leading into the chamber assigned for the hearing, that he saw Gemma and took his headphones off. Gemma cast a glance Arthur’s way and gave a nod, before she shook Draco’s hand.
Potter smiled and drank from his wine as the thunder combined with the electric organ of Riders on the Storm played. Draco looked out his large windows, framed in high, white linen curtains. The light from the street below shone up into his flat, but the darkness from Hyde Park and the starry sky gave it a calm vibe together with the music. Draco found that he might, kind of, enjoyed being silent with Potter. Just sitting, enjoying the music and the wine. It’s not something he would have chosen himself, though he was completely unable to convince himself to throw him out. Maybe, Draco mused, trying his best to find a good enough reason for allow the pillock to remain, the book hadn’t been all that good, after all.
Paul Simon - Call Me Al
And considering the fact that he’d never run into Potter before, in any gay bar, added to the fact that Potter had sent him a note after his little hospital visit, Draco couldn’t help but to feel suspicious. Was Potter following him? And why, if so, did he?
Draco looked away, feeling too much. And he fucking hated it. The pandora’s box was beginning to slowly unravel and suddenly he was not just angry, incensed and frustrated - but afraid. What else had he tucked away, with the intent of never again touching it? But he was right - Potter was right - and Draco was lying to himself.
“Mr Potter,” Gemma said, clasping her hands on the table. “We all wish to believe the best of our former partners, but we must also prepare for the worst. It does little to show up unprepared and it is mine and Mr Malfoy’s job to make sure you are as protected as humanly possible. This is what you pay us for. It’s unfortunate this only came to our knowledge this late, however, both Mr Malfoy and I are very much prepared for any kind of possible situation.”
Sex with Ginny had been terrifying too in the beginning, but it wasn’t that complicated, was it?
Draco ripped off his headphones and stared at his assistant. “
“First floor.” Harry said, gesturing for Draco to follow. “Kreacher’ll have it done in twenty minutes or so. Getting old, and that.”
Pulling his hands through his hair, Potter took a deep breath again, not meeting Draco’s eyes as he spoke.
He smiled as he watched Draco move about in the kitchen, actually preparing something instead of having his house elf do it for him. Harry still suspected Liffy to be called upon to make the main, as Draco was stacking crackers and some kind of bread sticks on a large wooden cutting board and pulling what looked like finely wrapped cheeses from the fridge. Harry would have been happy with a normal cheddar and some bread - but, as he’d just established - Draco was a bloody snob.
Yes, it must have been after the Dark Lord died the first time. When his father again nestled himself into the Ministry and manipulated anyone who could be even slightly useful to him. Perhaps the constant manipulation of his own child could have been included into those happy memories? How his father created a miniature of himself to use when he needed to.
. “I’d be happy to recommend a colleague.”
“Sure,” Harry shrugged. “I just don’t see Ginny doing this. She wouldn’t. It’s as easy as that.” They both looked troubled and Harry felt his cheeks flair. “What aren’t you telling me?”
When Gemma Zabini had recommended he’d go see Draco Malfoy for financial advise concerning his divorce and his assets, Harry had been hesitant. But from then on, the thought of just going to him, seeing him had whirled in his head and one day when he was sat at his desk at the Auror’s Office at the Ministry, he’d just decided to go over to Gringotts in Diagon Alley and have it done with. Malfoy could refuse him and he’d get someone else. Maybe his cowardice hope he would be rejected, if only so he could stop thinking about him.
Here is a link to the video that inspired me to write this in the first place: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOnE79LTQE
“I live fifteen minutes from here, so… No. You bloody sod off.” Potter said.
And, most important of all, Draco supposes, is that it’s just freeing not having to hide from everyone he spends his time with.
The two weeks didn’t go by very fast. Harry almost owled Draco two times during that time, drunk and miserable - but he managed to control himself, which he was glad for when he woke up in the morning.
Draco dearly wished he could be like the infamous Gallagher brothers. Punching paparazzi and giving them the fingers. Using people like punching bags whenever he felt like it, whenever he became too angry, too frustrated about his inconsequential life.
you narcissistic prat.”
His father was silent, as if expecting Draco to say something - or simply taking some sadistic pleasure in making Draco squirm. As if he knew exactly what the old dolt was getting at. Maybe he had an inkling, but no matter what it was, he wasn’t about to admit to
“Thank you,” Draco said and turned around, watching as Harry reached for a bottle of white and cooling it with some wandless magic. Nothing too boastful, or at least he hoped so. Draco didn’t seem to care.
As soon as they were inside, Draco pressed Harry up against the wall of his hallway, Draco’s hand around Harry’s throat and his lips lingering just over Harry’s, as if he was unsure. As if he was trying to control himself, make a decision, do
“Now I’m confused,” Potter put his fork down and sat both elbows on the table, ignoring Draco’s glare, leaning against his hands as he looked at Draco intently. “We’re alone, eating a gourmet dinner and drinking wine. This is a date.”
He found enjoyment in this sort of sadism, letting her suffer. He supposed it was a remnant from his school years, the bullying - making himself feel better by acting like a condescending misogynistic arse towards others. It wasn’t that he hated women. He didn’t actively hate his mother and he certainly didn’t hate Astoria, he simply loathed the insipidness of some women. The lack of ambition and the fact that they would be happy to do a meagre job like his assistant under a man like him. He could basically ask her to do anything, and who would she go to? The goblins didn’t care and Draco knew for a fact his colleagues were worse than him. At least Draco didn’t force her to suck him off. Not that he would even want to, even if he would have been straight. Her blotchy cheeks and too round face had no character to it. She was what he’d consider ugly, for someone so young. Perhaps if she learned to take better care of herself, use a little make up and actually do something about that horrid hair of hers, she might not irritate him as much. She was completely insipid and it disgusted him.
good at pretending. Or, he was usually very good at pretending. He’d like to think himself as the best and he’s been successful in cultivating that very image, literarily having walked over corpses to build himself up in the public’s eyes, from misguided Death Eater to successful financial advisor. It has taken ten years and now he was reaping the benefits, some would say. Draco just saw it as well-paid suffering.
Draco sat the book down with a frown, annoyed at once for the disruption. He decided to ignore the doorbell and picked up his book again, but then it rang again. With a sigh, Draco got up. If it was his incessant and too wealthy neighbour, he would actually break into her flat in the middle of the night and knife her as she slept, the old hag.
Draco hummed, flicking the filter of his cigarette. “I think I have some issues with alcohol, amongst other things. Can’t really control my intake when in a …less pleasant mood.”
other person before they got married, but was in theory, maybe a couple - and it had been before they actually properly reconciled after the war, but Ginny knew nothing about that.
“Want something to drink?” Harry asked, moving towards the liquor cabinet. He had a few bottles of wine stored in there, as whisky might be a tad too strong for lunch.
“Who?” Was all Harry could say. He felt empty and his throat felt thick and dry at the same time. It was as if his life had turned into a house of cards that was suddenly brought down by a puff of wind.
