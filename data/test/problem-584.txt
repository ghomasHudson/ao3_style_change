Thoughts of Malfoy, of course, caused Harry’s cock to harden in his trousers. The pale skin of his incredibly fuckable arse would look so good as he worked it over, painting every inch a lovely red before mounting him and riding him like the bitch in heat he knew he was. The image of a completely debauched Draco, face flushed, beautiful grey eyes clouded over with lust, his platinum blond hair plastered to his head with sweat, the little whimpers he would make as harry completely abused his prostate slamming into the bundle of nerves repeatedly and viciously. His cock purple with need but unable to cum without Harry’s permission and he would have to work for it, tears pooling in those beautiful eyes as he begged Harry to have mercy. But Harry wouldn’t. He would continue to torment the boy until he couldn’t take it anymore, calling him a slut as he begged Harry to let him cum.
Harry gave Severus a look to ask just how stupid he thought he was. “Oh, I don’t think they are going anywhere any time soon. At least not without either overpowering my sticking charm or leaving behind a few vital pieces of anatomy. I do hope they try” Harry smirked viciously as he was finally able to untangle himself from Malfoy’s grip. He was secretly impressed with the strength it took to remove the Omega from his person. It seems Malfoy was an unusual omega, with that kind of strength. Omega were supposed to be the weaker sex, incapable of resisting an Alpha but the way Malfoy had always fought against him and the blood under his claws told a different story.
was cute. Casting an overpowered sticking charm to ensure even if someone did stumble across them, they were not going anywhere; Harry gently scooped Malfoy into his arms where the Omega confirmed his suspicion that he had lost himself to his instincts when he turned his face into Harry’s chest and nuzzled against him letting out little enticing whines and whimpers that went straight to his already very interested cock.
Seeing as he could pass this class with his eyes closed, he allowed his mind to drift back to last night and the Omega he had encountered. There was something about the Omega that was bothering him; he felt as if he should know the scent, granted the spells in that corridor were designed to obscure the omegas within to “protect” their identity there was just something about the Omega that wouldn’t let him rest. He wasn’t quite ready to admit it to anyone, but he was eagerly anticipating nightfall. He was unable to prevent himself from peering at the Omega in class, wondering if they were the Omega who had captured his attention so completely. The females were quickly discarded. A sigh escaped his lips as he wished desperately for the class to be over so that he could try to distract himself from the thoughts that kept spinning around his head all seeming to be centered on the mysterious Omega.
Now that was something else that had changed, with the end of the war. Severus had survived the attack by Nagini. Barely, but it counted. After the final battle when Harry had snuck away from the celebrations, he had returned to the Shrieking Shack wishing to retrieve Severus’s body to at least lay him to rest as the man deserved that at the very least. Finding the Slytherin still breathing but faintly he had rushed Severus to Pomphrey who had gone to work immediately. They had almost lost him so many times before dawn broke that when he was finally stabilized, they had all breathed a collective sigh of relief. The relationship between the two had improved greatly, well to those who knew the two well could tell that it had to but to those outside of their trusted circle; it still appeared as if the two could barely stand to be in the presence of the other.
Harry stopped to ponder the rumour that had been making the rounds the last few months. It was a poorly kept secret, that is to say, that everyone knew about it. Long ago there had been an attraction one could say near the Slytherin Dorms. Because of the placement and the omega that often frequented the site had gained the name The Slytherin Wall of Sluts. Omega suppressants, where still a new invention really only having become popular in the last three generations. Before that Omega’s would often enter their rut with no relief as they had yet to be mated off and many of these omegas were unable to handle the pain of a rut without a partner. These Omega desperate for relief would convince Alpha’s to fuck them, sometimes multiple Alpha’s as unlike when mated the Alpha didn’t stay until the Omega was satisfied. Because of this, many Alpha’s started to make bets about being able to convince certain highly sought-after Omega to go on the wall and be used repeatedly by the participating Alpha’s until the Omega became pregnant. The father of the child was considered the winner of the game as they not only would have assured the continuation of their line, but they almost always would gain the omega as their prize.
Noting the state of Malfoy’s robes, and the fact they left very little to the imagination he shrugged out of his own robes and wrapped them around Malfoy a soft smile making an appearance as the distressed Omega snuggled into the cloth. Had Malfoy always been that cute? Cute? Malfoy? Shaking his head as he must be more tired than he thought if he was thinking that
“And that’s the problem! Thinking like that is only going to make it easier for the next Dark Lord! And they would be wrong.”
It seemed that his cloth was getting some unconventional use recently he thought, as he knelt beside Malfoy and started to clean him off in a crude parody of the previous night, speaking softly so as not to startle the already frightened Omega. “Shh Malfoy, it’s ok. Come on let’s get you cleaned up and to Madam Pomphrey. How does that sound?” He asked, keeping his voice soft as he wiped the blood and semen away, fighting to keep the frown off his face.
“Why” the soft, timid voice caused Harry to pause as he sighed. Seriously what was with him today. He should not be wanting to turn around and comfort the brat. This was the same boy who had made his school years hell! He should be indifferent at the very least if not vindictive and reminding him of everything he deserved. But while he enjoyed degrading the omega, he had fantasized was Malfoy the previous night, the omega just looked so broken he couldn’t bring himself to insult him.
“But I’m not like those other alphas, I can control myself no matter how pretty you are. Don’t compare me to such pathetic specimens.” He spat cruelly before straightening his clothes and turning away from the panting omega who seemed dazed. “I apologize, Professor, please pass on my offer to Lord Malfoy as well as my apologies for overstepping. This should cover it” He said tossing a bag of coins at Severus before he turned and strode out of the room. Leaving behind a confused Alpha and a disappointed Omega.
Over time the wall became popular even amongst omega as it allowed for an Omega to experience the joys of sex without being forced to mate the first Alpha that comes along. It quickly became popular amongst the lower-ranked omega as a way to raise their selves and their family in society. Becoming pregnant with a strong Alpha’s child would allow them to advance in society. The wall was designed in such a way as to protect the identity of the Omega and prevent an overeager Alpha from claiming them but still providing their hands, and lower regions for the Alpha’s pleasure. Alpha’s would use it as a way to prove who was the strongest Alpha as Omega would only conceive from the strongest Alpha that bred them. With the fact that neither the alpha nor the omega completely knew who was on the other side, it created a bit of mystery until a pregnancy would occur. Harry had been fascinated by the idea wondering about the omega that would do such a thing, but he hadn’t had a reason to investigate the current omega who frequented the wall.
As he wandered the halls taking in the destruction that even now months after the battle ended and school had resumed wasn’t completely fixed. Most of the classes had been relocated to the dungeons as it was the most structurally sound part of the castle. Haunted by the memories of the final battle, still fresh in his head from the nightmare caused Harry to veer off towards the Slytherin common rooms. His memories couldn’t haunt him there. As the worst memory, he really had was returning Draco’s wand to him at the entrance to the Slytherin Common Room after the battle was over. Draco had looked like he thought Harry was going to turn his wand against him. Maybe he did, after all, many of the students had been incredibly cruel to the Slytherin students after the battle. Something he couldn’t understand. Wasn’t it enough! Hadn’t they lost enough already! Bullying the Slytherins made them no better than the Death Eaters themselves. Something harry had angrily bit out shoving the wand back at Malfoy.
“You are filthy” he muttered as he struggled to remove all of the semen that was covering the beautiful little omega. The sheer amount of mess on the male would have been impossible to get through if it wasn’t for the spells placed on the cloth that kept it from getting soiled. The omega tensed upon hearing his voice something he wasn’t surprised by as everyone knew who he was. As he parted the Omega’s cheeks, he roughly scraped the semen off the omega’s entrance, slightly shoving the cloth inside his entrance scraping at his insides. As he cleared the semen away, it revealed a painful-looking red and swollen hole that seemed to quiver at every touch. Harry took sadistic pleasure at the quivering muscle as he blew on it after cleaning the mess away before he struck, the tips of his fingers striking against the Omega’s hole once, twice, three times before he allowed the Omega’s cheeks to close again. Wishing that he could have heard the whimpers that he knew would have escaped the omega at having his hole spanked.
“No,” she said, dark eyes narrowed dangerously. “No, I can’t believe I let you talk me into this, I never should have agreed. You’re putting my career on the line, all this Hank person has to do is–”
And then Harry frowned. Even after a good thirty seconds, there was no sign of Malfoy. Only his moans and pained gasps echoed from the walls of the bathroom.
knows what the hell ombre is. With a flick of Parkinson’s wand, instructions appear on the blackboard before them.
“If I was done with fighting, then… Then what would be left of Harry Potter? I shut myself up after that, bought my flat and stayed in. Only let Ron and Hermione know where I was. Didn’t even force myself to go out and eat. It was like all the fight had left me and I didn’t even know what to do without it. I was a soldier without a war and a boy without a family and a man without a purpose and I thought I’d just waste away there.” Harry said, a hint of shame in his voice as he trailed off.
“Maybe we should get one of those welcome mats before the studies next week? And maybe some candles, those would add a feminine touch…” Harry rattled off a few more ideas, hanging up their cloaks and setting the keys on the hook.
“Make sure you pick up a gift for George’s birthday next week, Good Night.” And then, because his life couldn’t be possibly weirder, she nods once to
His father had never changed. In a large part, reading and his small interactions changed how he thought of them and maybe that had led them here, to this exact spot.
Ronald Weasley with dust on his robes and a sheepish smile and a slightly bleeding cut over his brow and not Harry.
“The current working theory,” which was such Auror speak that Draco inwardly rolled his eyes, as often as Harry used that phrase. Though, Harry smirked at him, catching the joke, before focusing again on Weasley, making Draco flush with unspoken praise, “Is that he’s having a leg over with one of the secretary’s who handles the disciplinary records, otherwise how
“If you’ll excuse me,” Draco Malfoy said politely, standing up with an incline of his head while the three compared notes. He exited quietly from the room, went down the hall where Harry was busy talking to some old colleague, passing by without a trace to the washroom. A pale ghost, he was certain someone had told him long ago that Death was a pale ghost, riding on pale green horseback. He could be cutting a similar path.
He’d barely gotten the words out when she’d flung herself at him, clinging as she trigged another curse which he barely deflected into the dining room, a wave of destruction ripping through the table and china cabinet.
Also also: any time I had a meeting with the folks in our UK office, the first thing we’d spend about 5 minutes talking about on our weekly calls was the weather. Turns out living in a place where you can have 3.5in of snow on Halloween (our coldest since 1871) and then wear shorts over the weekend because you're back in the 60s/70s is fascinating conversation.
It was also bigger than the previous place, with a kitchen attached to the dining room, then a small drawing room and a nice snug or den they were going to convert into an office for the pair of them. It had nicely built in bookshelves that would be perfect for their books and their files.
This seemed to be the pattern here and with the Americans, both of which had barely come up for air in building their case, even shooing off Harry, who was eager to know what was going on, and Hermione, who lived and breathed research. He felt like an interloper.
“Please,” the woman’s voice was shallow and weak and he hand to strain to hear her, leaning in over the doorstep but not actually stepping in, “Please save Lacey.” So long as she didn’t move much, the mirrors would move very very slowly and he would have some shot at disarming it.
better) who was currently removing another one of those bomb like curses that had, apparently, been the starter of whatever had blown up the string of cars.
They were lunching in Belfast, Draco watching Harry demolish some sort of apple crumble with relish, when an explosion of sorts went off near them, starting off as a rumble as a string of cars went up in flames and fanfare. It was so startling for a brief moment that Draco didn’t even realize what was happening, only noticing that the glasses at their table had shattered instantly and that the side of his face was stinging and everything had been sent flying. He turned and saw muggles and wizards running, with silent screams from the smoking, sparking crater that used to be one of those muggle ‘lorries,’ a small number of bodies lying around it, parts of bodies as well, charred, and there was silence for a moment. Only an odd ringing like the church bell’s they had listened to before lunch but too fast, too high pitched for it to be that. In one of the blown out store fronts sat a dress stained in red, half-heartedly fluttering.
Draco flushed the toilet again, sitting on the somewhat clean bathroom floor and looked at the damaged stall wall, waiting for his stomach to settle.
“Stairs could use a looking over,” Cathleen broke him out of his thoughts, watching the stout woman test the second to last step.
It didn’t feel out of his control and it didn’t feel outside of what he new. It felt like coming home. And it was so bloody worth it, to have him close, to listen to him complain about Zabini and his coworkers, to watch him make a comment in his dry drawl and immediately check if it were alright, to look at the way his wrists tapered into strong, rangy forearms when he would roll up his sleeves, uncaring and daring Harry to say anything about the faded tattoo on his forearm.
“Mum’s do that a lot, don’t they?” Harry smiled gently at her, “Draco’s Mum does that all the time.”
Unlike the flat in Pimlico, lived in with their styles so thoroughly merged, the place in Camden was stark, almost like the first time Draco had been to Harry’s and looked at the plain off white of recently sold. It didn’t seem to bother Harry, the comparison as much as it did Draco. They were restarting again and there would be a whole new issue of what to place where and how to turn the emptiness full. And navigating the styles of a child which had very different needs from a pair of adults.
“Not a lot of good came from that,” he replied, as they sat on the edge of the big memorial, the one for the Princess, their
“This. Us.” He’d remembered, years ago, when he’d withdrawn from Harry, to stop this before it’d even begun, that he’d started tracking their lasts, marking each one as if counting graves. Once they had truly started up, he’d stopped doing so. Now it would seem he would need to return to it.
“I was scared because… I do love her, I want to protect her and watch her grow but... but I know that that’s lessened if she’s with me. That she’ll be bullied because of me, that my name will follow her around like a dark cloud and I... I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I didn’t want to hear it in a courtroom for hours. I didn’t want her to hear it, the
And it wasn’t untrue—he was not the same person that people knew in school and shortly thereafter, it had taken time and a period of isolation and now, seeing it all laid before him, both options, he was never going back.
was terrifying) that was coming through. But looking at this young girl, with her impossibly large eyes and dirty blonde-red hair and skinned knee that still had a ‘Mickey Mouse’ plaster on it, he felt a torrent of emotions rise up and replace the doubts. He wanted to protect this girl from the world if he could. It broke his heart just as badly that he couldn’t.
“I need to show you something, to show you why...” They didn’t break eye contact. “Come to my place, please?” He sounded desperate, as if Draco wasn’t already far too involved in this, as if it were even an option.
“Must be all that Gryffindor stupidity.” This he could handle, not the caring but the back and forth, it was easy to parry and—
But he was surprised again because Harry snorted, shaking his head while Weasley lets out another bark of laughter.
“Too many,” Tommy laughed. “And I’m trying to get my master’s from U of I in linguistics— there’s a lot of great stuff people have been doing with idiolects that I want to use with some of the hate groups I mentioned—even the Unenchanted use it! They caught the Unabomber in ‘96 using all the letters he wrote and compared them to his manifesto. It’s real fascinating stuff. And as part of my courses, I’m doing a work study with Cynthia here, which is why we’re both here.” Draco only understood half of it, unaware of what most of it meant. Just more nonsense words to add to the pile. He could feel a headache coming on.
muggles and muggleborn families. Shacklebolt stood the government back up, putting into place a temporary, emergency wizegamont led by himself, the interim minister, built in part by the members that were proven not to be part of the insurrection and some select international members of the various other governments, to serve as further impartial judges. And when it was all in place, the trials had begun. Hours and hours of testimony, all splashed over the front pages of the Prophet day after day, spanning the course of six months. And no person or business once indicted was spared from the scrupulous gaze of what they now call and will call once it passed into the history books the 1998 Ministry Involvement Trials. Even the Prophet wrote of its own propaganda schemes and its own culpability in spreading misinformation and lies to create fear and panic, though with a slightly more subdued tone. They were extremely effective, both in public support and in rooting out many long-standing powerful families.
Draco hated coming here. The selection was poor, they were always playing odd music over the wireless (
“Well,” he huffed, a little proud that he could still strike fear on a day where he’d been stood up, cried and had far too many emotional conversations, “He could have owled.” Weasley had the decency not to comment on the flimsy excuse he was using to cover his tender heart and led him into the underground. They moved in silence for a bit.
“Aye, yes, in the back break room, the whole lot’s all full up but we’ve got space yet,” she held out her hand, “Come on now, we’ll get you sorted out.” Rebecca looked at her distrustfully and Draco eyed her approvingly. She was quite smart to be suspicious, however nice this woman was.
But when he’d reached the bench, his nice shoes sinking slightly into the mud, cloak clinging to him as it drips into the grass, he couldn’t be angry, not when Lacey was right there, all alone now in the world.
the divine right of God? Unheard of for the time. The sheer amount of space and population? Like Jesus I get that Jo said there was 1 wizard for every 10 muggles and then retroactively said there were 3K
Harry forced out a laugh as they continue their climb, “You’ll have to get in line behind Hermione and me.”
Even at the reunion party tonight, Harry hadn’t felt uncomfortable at all. He’d told everyone, or rather, he’d told Seamus, who had told everyone and really, at the end of the day, he didn’t care what anyone outside of the Weasley’s and Hermione had thought, but everyone seemed to gloss over that he was now dating a man and skip right on to former Death Eater as their sticking point. Harry understood, he did. He’d put enough of them away to know, they were bad people, doing dark deeds for no reason other than self superiority. But in Draco Malfoy, he recognized something of himself, as strange as it was, in the desire to fit in, to be loved. If he could, he would have killed Lucius himself just for the self doubt that he had forced upon his son and made Draco think that he was less than worthy, that he'd have to fight a war to be that way, that blood was equivalent to superiority. Maybe it was an overreaction at the ghosts that surrounded them but
“Well, I have certainly seen worse rooms,” John states, making his notes. Draco watches him measure out the space just to check that it’s an appropriate size. Liza peeks in the empty closet and seeing nothing, jots the bare minimum on her paperwork.
“Well, it looks like your....” she hesitated and the room got a bit quiet again, “Your daughter is fine, a bit scuffed up but it seems she avoided the worst of it—“
So dropping the money on the table, as he had seen Harry do so many times, he got up, nodded to Ronald and followed him out to the nearest entrance for the Ministry.
Draco had tuned out while Harry walked through the case, but now he shook himself out of his thoughts, to see what they needed to do next.
Draco shrugs. He enjoys the parts of his job where he spends hours manipulating and maneuvering the magic to do what he needs. It’s hard work but very rewarding when everything goes right. He doesn’t like working with aurors or his coworkers, who still look at him with fear and distrust. A lot of the people at the firm were on the outside of the Death Eaters, or just come from longstanding pure blood families with experience in this sort of hereditary magic, but until Draco joined, Blaise was the one who was deepest into the group, which was to say not very deep. Even though the skin is numb, dead from the magic leaving it, his dark mark stings like a phantom limb and he itches it subconsciously.
Draco went over to the tree and collected the gifts he had bought. “Weasley,” he said as he handed them out. “Hermione.”
“Yes ma’am,” Draco said drily, and left without arguing, which told him enough about how much he needed a break.
He was unprepared for Potter to take two long steps, grab his wrist with one hand, immobilizing it, while the fingers of his other hand sank into Draco's hair. He pulled with such brutality that a cry of surprise and delight escaped Draco as his head was forced back and his throat was bared.
“Change of plans,” he said, and flashed them all a smile. “Penelope was forced to go and process a prophecy that just came in, so I’m here in her stead. Lovely tree, Granger.”
“I don’t think there is a spell that can tell,” Draco spoke up. “Not accurately enough to answer that question. The one St Mungo’s uses has a two-year margin of error for adults, although for children it’s only about four months.”
“Of course. I’ll leave it on the table under a stasis charm, shall I? It’d be a shame if it were to go soggy.”
“Wizards don’t really have an equivalent, or even much of a concept that it’s possible,” Draco said ruefully. “We don’t even
Draco decided to make the decision easy for her. “If I eat anything more right now, I may actually explode.”
“I didn’t exactly deserve a warm welcome, after everything.” Draco swallowed hard. It still hurt to think about that, about the fact that he had done terrible things to a place he loved.
continues to be invaluable and amazing and always available to help me with editing or talking plot or just giving opinions on small details.
“Well, not exactly. I don’t even have galleons, actually. I’ll pay you back once I can access the Potter vault again, how’s that?”
“Er, I don’t even know what this is, frankly,” Potter told her. “Or where it’s supposed to be from.”
Draco looked at the painting, at the long elegant lines, the dark spots that might be kitten ears but that, to him, looked like dark, messy hair. He couldn’t put his finger on why, but the only thing he could think of when he saw the painting was
going to weather more neighbourly complaints than strictly necessary, thank you very much. Ron brought home a few different kinds of crackers from the shop – which had
You all have been very kind to me, and I appreciate the graciousness, understanding, and words of encouragement of everyone who has commented.  I really like this community, and I'm hoping to stay. Writing often helps me in the never-ending fight against my own mind, and it's nice to have someone to write FOR. Lots of love to you all!
nonsense, and maybe he’d expect me to…oh, Merlin, do you think I’ll have to ask his parents for permission?”
“Oh, good point.” Harry looks at Theo and doesn’t give him a smile either. Potter-smiles currently seem reserved for Draco, which feels very satisfying. “We overheard you and Ron saying something about Hermione and Pansy – I mean Parkinson – being absolutely impossible if you told them about…well, whatever you were going to tell them.”
Harry chose an armchair that was blue and squashy. He sank into it so far that he thought he might never be able to find his way back out of it. The rain drummed against the roof and sides of the bus quite loudly, and suddenly, he felt quite cozy.
“Speaking of plants, I keep forgetting about this.” He dug in his pocket and produced the small silver cube with the button. “Oi, Hermione, do you know what this is? Or Ron, for that matter?”
“I don’t think so. There was this turquoise-haired Squib woman, and two old ladies who were knitting, and a Kneazle, and a goblin mom and her –” He broke off when Draco pulled away from him.
But Potter was wrong, had to be, since Draco carried that knowledge with him wherever he went. Every look thrown his way told him so, every whispered word. He scratched at his wrist, digging his nails in, but a hand grabbed his to stop him, so Draco snarled and banged his head against the wall again. And again, and again, and again, until it felt as though his skull might split, and even then he kept going, until-
Throughout the feast he chatted with Blaise and Pansy. They both described their trips in varying detail. Apparently Blaise had messed around with more than one girl but none of them had lasted more than a week. Where as Pansy had spent most of her time alone site seeing and surprisingly writing a book, of which she refused to show either of them. Finally it was time to head to the dorms and despite the staring and whispers he got from students around him, Draco was feeling rather hopeful that this year could be quiet. He went to sleep that night, and for the first time in a while, slept without dreaming.
"Well at least this is better than Belgium," Pansy groaned, "It was absolutely and completely dull the entire time. It was like walking around a giant version of Hogwarts except without the magic and more chocolate. I've eaten so much it of I must have gained three or four stone."
“I only know that he brought a critically injured student to me, and he’s completely overwhelmed. You will let him calm down before you talk to him, understood?” The matron was deadly serious.
Malfoy was flung backwards in a high arc and hit the wet floor. His wand landed somewhere in a corner, behind a loo. A surprised “Wow” escaped Harry as he quickly returned to his cover. Until now, the spells from the book had been mostly harmless; this one was far more powerful. Still, he kept his wand at the ready. You never knew.
Draco led the way toward where the stall with the scented candles was, but halfway there, Harry said, “Oh, look,” and dragged him over to one of the stalls, this one selling delicate ornaments. “This can go on the tree we are
"Isn't it a bit late to send Christmas cards? It's only got two days to arrive, and with Muggle mail not always being the fastest -
Draco waited until they were all gone before deliberately dragging his nails further down his wrist and welcoming the stinging pain that seemed to do so much to help him breathe.
“I still don’t understand,” he said tonelessly. “Death isn’t supposed to be something you can just bloody
"Breathing isn't what I need right now," Draco told her, fully aware he sounded ridiculous. "I...where are we going, anyway?"
Draco nodded and led her to the kitchen. “I know her,” he confirmed. “She’s decent. How the fuck are you so awake? When in Merlin’s name did you sleep if you’ve been doing all these other things?”
can’t help but feel the need to remind you that while the contestants have no wands, I do,” Parkinson says, syrupy-sweet. “And I’m not afraid to use it.”
“Right, okay, I assume you have a point beyond ‘Have a look at Penelope and this bloke who definitely couldn’t have helped her’?”
“Would also have stopped Orval from running to get help,” Draco thought out loud. “Or even…would it have prevented a Patronus leaving, do you think?”
As I mentioned in a recent comment reply for the previous chapter, I have mixed feelings about participating in the fandom these days. My enjoyment has been severely dampened by certain insensitive and damaging comments that I cannot overlook, no matter how much I'd love to separate the art from the artist. I needed a sense of comfort throughout the past year that Harry Potter can unfortunately no longer give me. But it would be blatantly unfair to abandon a work such as Timecode, so I'm working on getting the remaining chapters finished and posted. I'm sorry for the long wait, I really am. I hope you understand.
Harry stared at her, feeling hurt. “Why aren’t you taking this seriously?” he asked. “I know Ron likes to wind me up about it, but you…”
“Okay,” said Charlotte, with so little power behind the word that it was barely audible. She was led to a chair by the headmistress who then stood by her side in silent support.
“Afternoon,” he said briskly, in his most professional healer voice. Potter looked up from where he was sitting comfortably, propped up by blankets against the little safe in the corner, in which, Draco guessed, Granger kept all of the books she thought too valuable to put on the bookshelves that ran along the far wall.
“Well, you should call me Harry. I live with you, it’s a bit weird we’re still using last names, isn’t it?”
“Yes, I am putting it that way.” Ron flapped his hand at Harry. “Now leave the thinking to the smart people and go paint.”
Pansy was silent for a moment, studying his face. Then, she said, “Potter saw it, didn’t he? Last time you were this emotional was when you overheard him agreeing to go out with that utter twat from the Spirit Division.”
Draco did not dignify that with a response. I stead, he stared at the ground and tried not to be upset about the fact that they weren’t getting anywhere, that it meant they’d end up having to repeat the loop and his time with Harry was limited.
have covered his tracks if he had decided to go around poisoning people. One of the drawers had a lock that wouldn’t yield until he’d cast three different unlocking spells on it, which seemed promising, but the contents of the drawer weren’t what Draco would have called suspicious – several carefully folded performance evaluations, a coin purse, a muggle novel with a swooning heroine on the cover whose dress was rather revealing. Draco thumbed through it just for the sake of being thorough, but the only thing he found was an old photograph that Clearwater had apparently been using as a bookmark. It showed her – a younger her, she couldn’t have been long out of Hogwarts – next to an older man who might have been a relative. Both of them were smiling unenthusiastically.
She sighed and threw a quick glance Marielle’s way. The other woman smiled and put her headphones back on without a comment.
time flow,” she told them. “It’s all passive, observational, nothing you could use to actually travel in time, or really influence time in any way at all.”
“Right, but still. As long as the poison goes.” Granger bit her lip and reached out to take Potter’s hand. “Ready, Blaise.”
“Right, so.” Potter held his arm out. “Do you need to write it down on some parchment? Or can you decode it straight from here?”
If it had been anyone else, Draco would have been annoyed at having to play teacher, but he thought Granger might actually be able to keep up with his explanation, and that could only be beneficial. He wasn’t arrogant enough to believe he was infallible.
“I can’t even remember the last time I was in here,” Draco said and tried his best not to fidget as they walked past stacks of plain Hogwarts uniforms in all sizes and racks filled with various styles of dress robes, most of them horribly out of fashion. He wished he could have claimed this trip down memory lane was a pleasant one. They rarely were though, for him.
Harry looked sceptical. Draco didn’t blame him – the Love Room was such an abstract-sounding thing, it was difficult to imagine what entering it would actually be like.
“How dare you tell me what I will or won’t feel for you?” Harry growled. “I’m sick of decisions being made on my behalf, you know that? Did you ever think about asking me how I felt? No, of course not. That would have made sense, and we can’t have that now, can we?”
It was rather enjoyable to watch irritable Mr. Colesworth, who had made a particularly thunderous face when he’d caught sight of Draco, hurry to accommodate them once Blaise started on his ‘I an very busy and important and could easily leave you to die in a Ministry holding cell’ routine. The man did, in fact, have three crystal stirring rods for sale, and he fetched them from the back room and grudgingly allowed Draco to take his time selecting the one with the least amount of impurities. Since they were already here, Draco decided to purchase a few difficult to find ingredients as well, anything he was moderately likely to need. Mr. Colesworth followed him around until a sharp “I will not have you harassing my consultant!” from Blaise sent him scurrying back behind the counter.
There were things they would have to talk about eventually if they kept being in each other’s proximity. It would have to wait, though, until they weren’t dealing with anything quite so urgent.
He missed those simple days in Belfast, at times. Learning about Bex’s life—her love of cats, her desire to be a quidditch player and a teacher
Harry just shakes his head, leaning back slightly out of habit before remembering he was on a stool, as he always did, “I can’t believe he still works there.”
“Must mean the scene has been cleared.” He brushed a few locks of hair from the girl’s face. “She woken up yet?”
“Seems a funny reason to kill people,” Ron replied, tactlessly. His own stomach turned, the wine souring within.
, feeling relived and shaken at once. And then Harry was slowly becoming a common fixture around closing time at the firm, ready to whisk Draco off to dinner or out to a muggle movie or a book would arrive by post over lunch with a note (“Saw this and thought of you. Can’t wait to get home. - H”) that he most certainly did
Harry added: “A very small order, I should think, solving the problems of the world in one girl.” Draco couldn’t help but laugh, the Chosen One voice always got to him.
He wasn’t sure why they were still in Northern Ireland. He knew that the investigation and statement giving would take some extra time to clear—Blaise had all but given his blessing when he had owled back, scattering his letter with insinuations that by having him gone
“Sort of,” Harry stepped in, “The American government didn’t start until right before the American revolution.”
So what could he say to her? She was trying to speak paragraphs in a sentence and he was trying to respond through occlumency and they were both avoiding the hidden curses laying between them.
Both of them felt ravenous then—as if they had each woken from a long sleep and needed something to fill them, something other than the aching feelings that had plagued them. Like waking up from flu—the fever abated and the appetite returned and the body seemed to right itself, just like magic.
Maybe this was what Pansy had told him, that certain people were destined to always orbit around one another. Sometimes colliding, sometimes hovering near and sometimes entering perfect, entrancing, celestial circles around one another. “
“Thin pizza just can’t hold up to it,” he interjected, giving the Brits a grin. Harry returned it. Draco has always envied his fast friendships. “But Italian is good, reminds me of the Little Italy back home.”
Luckily, Harry was the sensible one, he crouched down by Rebecca and asked her, “Would you like Draco and I to go with you?”
His life was far too strange. Strange enough that he didn’t even protest, knowing that the night alone would be trying enough, due to the sheer amount of oddities happening.
“Massive is one thing, this is beyond that. I’m not even sure you could apparate across the whole thing in one go even if you were Albus bloody Dumbledore.” They all sat in silence considering these facts.
He had cursed Katie, had joined the Death Eaters, and now he was hatching yet another perfidious plan. Harry knew all that with certainty, even if he couldn’t prove it. He was planning to stop him before he managed to hurt – or even kill – anyone else. His heart was beating wildly. He
Of course he wasn't right. He hadn't been since the war, and never would be again. Trust Potter to state the bloody obvious.
They were sitting out by the Quidditch pitch, where it was chilly and windy and where they couldn't be overheard. Regular warming charms kept their fingers from freezing to the point of pain. Draco had just been putting his wand away when Harry commented on his eating habits.
“It’s very good,” Pansy tries to assure her. “Fresh jam, flaky pastry, still warm; I picked it up from the kitchens myself. I know you’re a bit partial to them, so I thought you might enjoy a slice while you study.”
It still hurt a little when Harry pressed into him. Draco greeted the pain like an old friend, savored it, let it heat his skin and make him float. He blinked, and green eyes met his own in the mirror. Harry’s face was intense but his expression caring even as he bit his lip and dug his fingers hard into the skin of Draco’s hips.
“Indeed.” Draco reached over and took the cube Blaise had set down on the coffee table. “How does it work?”
“Where would you go, though?” she asked eventually. “You shouldn’t be on your own, not before you’ve had a little more time to recover, and I don’t think we should tell people that you’re back yet. I’d love for you to come stay with Ron and me, but we get too many visitors for that to be a good idea.”
Severus thought about what he had just heard. He hadn’t truly thought that James Potter’s son was cold enough to knowingly use a curse as dark as this one on another person, and he could confirm it by simply thinking back to the utterly distraught boy rocking on the floor earlier. But, more importantly, the boy had actually managed to somehow get his hands on Severus’ old potions book. It had been in a cupboard in the potions classroom, although Severus had forgotten all about it until just now. Under these circumstances it would certainly be best to take possession of it again.
"You think it's best if we stick as close to the previous iteration as possible but make one change that will get us just slightly closer to our goal."
Harry shrugged. “Haven’t got a clue, honestly. Maybe the poisoner didn’t want to stick around to see Orval die – or they couldn’t, for whatever reason – and that was where they set the cube when they made the barrier so it wouldn’t be discovered before they could come back and get rid of it.”
“Yes, they hope so. Ron’s been working incredibly hard to get it polished in time. He’s got two more to put finishing touches on; one’s a window that gives you a realistic view of a snowy landscape – Ron wants it to feel like actual cold glass when it’s touched, so children can press their noses against it as they look outside – and the other a decorated tree with fairy lights, which should make the room smell like pine.”
“Bless you,” everyone in the bus, save Harry, chorused. The goblin child was especially enthusiastic about it. Evadne, meanwhile, pawed at the back of Harry’s armchair.
“Pansy,” he said, smiling through gritted teeth. He had very much hoped not to run into anyone while he did this, because he hadn’t been able to think of a very good excuse for why on earth he would be de-gnoming Draco’s garden – or really, any excuse at all. He’d welcome even a bad one with open arms, but his mind remained infuriatingly blank. “How nice to see you,” he said instead.
Snape seemed to be able to read his thoughts. In a threatening tone, he said, “No arguments, Potter! You will bring it here within the next five minutes, otherwise you will not enjoy the consequences.”
“That’s too…hm.” Weasley frowned. “It’s just sort of…a bit too fancy, you know? Wouldn’t you feel strange changing the nappies of a baby named Oriana?”
“Sorry, sorry.” He took the parchment and tried to smooth it out, noticing that there were moving dots on it with…names on them?
“Promising,” Draco said drily and went to sit on the couch. Harry did the same, and Weasley and Hermione entered the room a moment later and got comfortable as well.
“I’m only trying to weigh indulging your paranoia against screwing this up and risking more suicides happening. We’ve got…crap, we’ve got five, six minutes, max, before they’ll be gone from wherever the hand-off is happening.”
“I swear I won't. I'll stick to my story about us talking about war things, which, by the way, if you want to actually do that, I wouldn't be opposed.” Harry ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair. “I wouldn't mind people thinking we're friends.”
“You,” Potter said, and took a deep breath, looking as though he was preparing to be hexed the next moment. “Because, as it turns out, I’m rather mad about you.”
“Do you really think we’d attack you?” he asked, surprised and almost a little bit hurt. He supposed he couldn’t blame her for not fully trusting him, but he had expected her to trust the friends she met for dinner at least twice a month.
“A terrifying one,” said Weasley around the candy cane he was sucking on, which seemed to have formed an ‘s’ shape.
Selwyn frowned and actually seemed to think about the question for a while. He stared into the distance and eventually moistened his lips.
“No, actually. I believe he died a couple of years ago, and while he was quite knowledgable, his speciality was developing antidotes for existing poisons, not creating new ones. He also wasn’t prolific enough to come up with something this complex.”
“Well, yes,” she said. “But it’s as safe as I could make it. There is no way for it to get out. The bubble it’s in is unbreakable, and it will last for over a hundred years. Not even
“Yes, of course I did, but it wasn’t exactly productive. Smith and Clearwater used three or four since the last batch was enchanted, and Marielle requested four as well.”
Severus, who looked outwardly angry, actually felt disturbed more than anything. That didn’t mean he wasn’t still fuming, and he would have loved to interrogate the brat here and now, but he had to be smart about it. If he lost his temper, Poppy would throw him out, so he waited until Potter had calmed a little and let the boy start the conversation.
The first time that Draco and Potter spy on Pansy with the invisibility cloak, things get a bit strange. For one, Pansy spends way too much time in the girls’ bathroom, touching up her make-up, and the two of them nearly fall asleep from boredom. And then there’s the issue that…well, there’s not exactly a whole lot of space under that cloak of Potter’s.
Harry stared at him for a very long time, Draco knew that even without looking his way. He waited for the inevitable protest and tried to prepare himself for it. He didn’t actually expect Harry to get as angry as he did.
“No.” Draco reached for his water, hand brushing the book Granger had been reading. He glanced at it and frowned at the title. “Cryptography?”
“Sorry,” Harry hears just after he takes his apple cake out of the oven and throws the gingerbread in instead. He looks up. Draco is standing at the very end of his bench, as close to Harry as he can be without actually leaving his station, and he is biting his lip.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, and he stared at her, feeling lost, until she shook her head at him, gently patted his arm, and walked away.
“You’re not a very good owl,” Draco said ungraciously to the excitable bird, which hooted and hopped. It was too small to be a school owl, he thought, and he had an unfortunate suspicion as to who might have sent the feathered menace. Hadn’t he seen it over at the Gryffindor table before?
I've fallen behind a bit more - sorry! I was fighting anxiety attacks for a large part of this chapter, and the rest of my life wasn't exactly being cooperative either.
A small smile appeared on Hermione’s face. “Mum and dad always told me that the rowan trees knew if a bad winter was coming and did their part to make sure no one had to starve.”
Harry shook his head. “Feels like with everything we figure out, things only get more complex, not less. I haven’t a clue.”
Draco had rarely been so relieved for a shift to be over. The golden fairy lights twinkled warmly overhead as he changed out of his lime green robe, but they couldn’t chase away the icy feeling in him that was burrowing bone deep. He didn’t bother to hold in a sigh.
The Fiendfyre still haunts him in his dreams, Vince’s screams, the heat, the overwhelming power. He dreams of the absolute terror he felt when the certainty of his death had hit him, and he wakes up with that same terror still in his heart, tangled in sweated-through sheets and feeling moisture on his cheeks.
“Don’t be silly, Harry,” she said, then gasped. “Oh, what an astonishing amount of gnomeholes Draco has in his garden! I wish he’d told me, I could have brought a bronze necklace with me to imbue with gnome magic.”
Draco Malfoy stood on the edge of platform 9 ¾ where the Hogwarts Express was meant to arrive shortly. Truthfully though, he would have much rather been standing in a corner, away from the suspicious looks of parents waiting with their children. However, the intimidating Auror behind him seemed to have no intention of letting him find comfort in the shadows. He was a scruffy man in what Draco would guess was about his sixties. His long leather trench coat looked worse for wear and the hat and boots on his feet didn't look much better. The Wizengamot had assured Draco he was the best of the best however and he didn't doubt it. The man may have looked old but his height was probably over 180cm, and his build, although hidden mostly under his coat, was certainly very fit.
While these thoughts swam through his head, and the rain battered on, something small sounded outside of the compartment. A creak of the old train floors. Draco would have simply ignored it if not for the fact that the Auror tensed suddenly. He hadn't moved much in the time they were in there so seeing him almost reanimate startled Draco. The large Auror stood slowly, his head almost brushing the ceiling of the compartment. Surprisingly quietly with his wand drawn, he crept over to the door where the shade was still pulled. Another little creak sounded outside and the shade was quickly pulled up.
"It's good to see you Draco,"  Pansy said, making him feel somewhat relieved. She sounded genuine at least, maybe someone didn't hate him completely.
None of them had been able to keep up any kind of correspondence after the war. Draco's family had been automatically thrust into court sessions and such, Blaise and his mother had set off to France for the time, while Pansy had taken her own mini holliday to somewhere in Belgium while her parents had stayed. Draco had written letters of apology to everyone he could think of, but he hadn't received a single letter back. Not that he had blamed any of them. They had been required and he wasn't used to apologizing, so the letters probably sounded bad.
Before he could get too drawn into his thoughts, Draco became distracted by the noise of other students streaming through the tight aisle of the carriage. When more than one group passed by Draco's compartment with whispers, wide eyes, and more than a few scowls, the Auror stood and pulled the blinds for the door. He felt he ought thank him but was far too awkward to say anything. Draco had always been bad at that sort of thing anyway. Thanking people and whatnot. It certainly wasn't something he was in habit of doing considering his upbringing. Probably another thing to work on while he un-evilafied himself or whatever the Wizengamot expected him to do.
Draco yawned. Why he had had to arrive so early in the first place was beyond him, but here he was reguardless. Normally when arriving on the platform, he would be with his mother and father, only arriving maybe about 15 minutes before the train had to leave. This time though, the Auror watching him had arrived an hour before they had to actually go, not saying a thing but simply indicating it was time to leave. And so Draco, despite his better judgement, had had no choice but to follow the silent, intimidating Auror. Fortunately for him, he had packed the night before.
Eventually the hall was called to attention when the first years came through. The sorting hat sang a song it had composed about house unity and pushing forward. They were sorted and after Professor Mcgonagall gave her own speech about roughly the same thing, the feast began. There were all sorts of dishes from pies to puddings, but Draco wasn't feeling particularly hungry. He had certainly missed the food there, sure, however he ended up with nothing more than a simple few brussel sprouts and a small piece of chicken. The pumpkin juice didn't do much for him either so he left with having had only a few sips.
He opened the door and looked up and down the hall for good measure. Evidently however, he saw nothing of significance so he came back inside, making sure to pull the blind down once again. Draco was confused and slightly concerned. There was every possibility that some student had been dared into peeking in on the ex-deatheater as some joke. It made him feel all the more ashamed at the possibility that all he was now was something to gawk at. The evil boy who other students dared each other to mess with. Eventually he was able to block out those feelings and settled back to his thinking, staring out the window once more. Not that there was much to see anymore as it was so dark except for the reflected lights of the compartment on the raindrops that slid down the glass.
When they finally arrived at the Hogwarts train station, the rain had stopped and the moon was in the sky, shining a brilliant yellow through the clouds that still lingered. Draco took his luggage down and after waiting for as many students as possible to pass by first, he left his compartment with the Auror following close behind. The train was mostly empty by now and most students had already left for the buggies so leaving without being looked at too much was much easier than it would have been otherwise. As soon as Draco reached his own buggy, the Auror that had been watching over him silent the whole way placed a large hand on his shoulder making Draco face him confused.
"I would except for the fact that you look exactly the same Pansy." Which wasn't entirely true. She looked tired. Not as tired as Draco probably did, but still tired. As did Blaise despite the fact that normally he looked perfect, with every hair in its place.
At first it seemed like a fairly bright day. The sun was out with fluffy clouds dotted here and there in the blue, blue sky. But as time went on, the sky darkened into a far more dense grey cover. On the window glass came the tap tap tapping of occasional water droplets that soon got harder and more often. On occasion there was lightning, cutting through the dense rain and showing off the wet Irish countryside, but from inside the train he could not hear the boom of thunder. The ambiance allowed Draco's mind to wander from one subject to another, not all of them pleasant, few of them nice. He recalled the letter that had been brought into his room by the family house elf Pipsy.
"Oh yes," mocked Draco, "Sounds completely horrid, nothing to like there at all." Pansy bat at him from across the table and Blaise snorted at them.
"Of course they have, stubborn bastards. You could tell them they're not allowed back and they'd find a way in anyway." Blaise supplied, earning nods of agreement from the other two.
"Speaking of collections," Pansy piped in, "Our favorite Gryffindors seem to have come back this year as well." Draco had been trying to avoid looking over to where he knew the golden trio sat. He had sent letters to all three of them and he wasn't too excited to be seeing them again. Somehow they bothered him more now, than they ever had any other year.
"Take care," the Auror said, in a quiet but deep voice. Draco just nodded in return after a moment, and then hoisted himself up, his trunk already having been placed on a trolly to be taken up to the castle.
"I'd say it's good to see you too except for the fact that you look bloody awful. What are those under your eyes, a new fashion statement?" Blaise joked but when Draco looked up at him, he looked happy to see him.
Finally the Hogwarts Express arrived and Draco was ushered inside to one of the many empty carriage compartments. The Auror, once seeing that Draco had arranged his trunk satisfactorily overhead, took a seat across from him. Draco felt like he would go mental. The Wizengamot seemed to trust him as much as they would trust a niffler with their family vaults. They seemed to think if they left him alone for a moment his evil urges would take over and Draco would automatically begin cursing students left and right. It could have been worse though, he supposed. If not for the help of a certain scar headed savior, Draco would probably have never even been allowed out of the Manor to begin with. Out of anything, he certainly didn't want to be couped up there with his mother and their memories. His father, whom of which was now locked up in Azkaban for 50 years, was in a far worse state than either of them.
"I personally find it quite fantastical how many people came back, you'd think parents would protest after everything but apparently not." Draco had noticed how full the hall was earlier when he was tring to find a seat. They all stayed silent for a moment thinking.
The next morning started out quiet. Draco's dorm room slowly coming awake peacefully. That peace however was quickly disturbed by the sound of Draco himself falling out of bed, rushing to the wash room, and promptly throwing up all of what little he had eaten last night. It would seem his year would not be a quiet one after all.
Harry cursed, heartfelt, and then exhaled a shaky breath. “That’s why I haven’t got memories of the time loop then, yeah?”
“No, we don’t. I’m sure Granger and Weasley will have one, and I’m also sure they’ll be happy to let you stare at it for a while.”
“Fuck off,” Draco grumbled, one eye on Potter, who let out a shout of rage and charged at the bearded man who’d been standing out of Draco’s line of sight. A spell, cast by Bones, flew wide. “I was waiting for you.”
Draco suddenly felt the chill on his skin despite the charm. “Do you think that’s what’ll happen?” he asked. “Once he wakes up?”
it stated bluntly, followed by what looked like tally marks. Draco ran a finger across them. Seventeen.
Harry's hand wandered up his neck, palm stroking his skin, and then his fingers twisted in Draco's hair. He tugged lightly, and Draco closed his eyes in response. His heart was pounding in his chest like it had after the nightmare, but that was the last thing he was thinking of just now. It was all Harry's closeness – and when had Potter become
“And here I am knitting you a jumper,” said Philomena and looked down at the woolly mint-green project she held in her hands.
“Granger, I haven’t the slightest bloody clue.” Draco waved his wand again and ended the spell, feeling oddly shaken by this comparatively minor development.
“I…think so, yes, at least before…oh! Yes, I remember now. And – Salazar, that makes so much sense!”
“I have work to get done anyway, I’ve spent long enough indulging your hopeless denial.” She gave him a wave, then opened the door and froze. “Oh,” Draco heard her saying. “Hello, Potter, I was just on my way out.”
But the idea of those two knowing any kind of weakness about him didn't sit well with him, and when the time came to submit to his pain, he was preoccupied. The thoughts kept intruding, despite the wonderful sensations his scalp was giving him.
The knot tugged and twisted unpleasantly, bringing a bitter taste to his mouth, but then it loosened.
“Sit down, Harry. You’re already here, so we might as well get this over with.” She pushed a chair his way while she leaned back against her desk.
“I’ll take care of it,” She turned to the others. “I’m going to take Draco outside – might run an errand while I’m at it, too. You keep going with the decorations.”
“I as well.” With a decisive swipe of her wand, she severed his hood entirely, and Draco wanted to cry. “But as for what we talked about, she told me all about her vacation, and then she mentioned visiting her aunt later in the day – she’s in the Janus Thickey Ward, you see. Ah, I recall now, that’s when she started shivering. Must have reminded her she’s got Mumblemumps, talking about St Mungos. We didn’t stay on the topic long, it’s really rather depressing, and Miss Brown said she was not feeling well and left soon after. That was probably for the best.”
"Grinch, fine, Draco, you were being a grinch about not wanting decorations in the flat. I know you, and I knew it would be futile to try and talk you into it, so we decided to skip that step and were instead going to ambush you with our devious plan."
“We use them at the Department of Mysteries. Blaise and Anton came up with them. They create a see-through barrier that is close to impenetrable for a little while. Very useful as a safety precaution when anyone’s doing an experiment.”
“You what?” Draco snarled, actually dropping his knife. It fell to the floor with a bright sound. Luckily the room was so full of noises and voices that the slip went unnoticed.
Thanks for checking out this slightly goofy thing, and I hope you enjoyed! I appreciate all the comments I've received so far a LOT - it's lovely to hear that someone aside from myself thinks I'm funny. It's also a great boost, mood-wise, which I can always use. :)
“Yes, Potter, only. It’s utterly awful, of course it is, but she can still have a proper life, even if she has to re-learn everything and it’s bound to be difficult. If the poison had also stopped her forming new memories – imagine it, not having any memories at all, not able to form new ones…”
“I won’t bother trying to deny that one,” she said. “But in the time since he joined the Department of Mysteries, Zach has never shared any noticeable progress. Have you seen any proof of it? Sometimes I think he just leaves runic books lying around on his desk for show and then sits there reading the new Witch Weekly.”
“Figures,” Draco muttered. He didn’t often use them, as it was easily possible to build up a tolerance. He had a feeling he might need a fair few of them during the next few days, though.
“What do we do?” Potter asks, and Draco suddenly finds himself in the strange position of having to come up with a cunning plan involving him teaming up with his former arch-nemesis.
When Draco was in the process of picking out flavours of gummy bears, Harry said, “Ron had quite a clever thought on Orval Amado and the barrier cube, by the way – and don’t go expressing shock that he’s capable of rational thought, please, Draco.”
said Potter. “Sorry, Blaise, that may have been my fault. I really did tell him something he needed time to process.”
“I do owe them,” Draco muttered into his neck. “They made you see sense. Hmm, you’re nice and warm.”
“I will, yes,” she said and stopped abruptly. Draco turned toward her and watched as she dug in her purse and eventually pulled out a glossy red envelope.
they had wasn’t clearly defined, it turned out that being in trouble for forgetting your sort-of anniversary was still very much possible. At least, he was pretty sure that was why Draco had been ignoring him for the entire last week, because they never bloody
“I can kind of see it, now that you’re pointing it out.” Pansy’s eyes were still fixated on the canvas. “But for the most part, it still just looks like a painting of two naked guys making out to me, and I don’t think I’ll be the only one thinking that.”
Victoria took out her wand and cast a Tempus. “It’s past five already, and your brain is definitely toast for the day. Go home, see what happens when you’re around him, report back to me tomorrow.”
,” Granger admitted, her face crumpling. “What if this doesn’t work? What if we kill him with it? What if taking him out of stasis turns out to be a mistake?”
“Oh, yeah.” Potter had moved closer again without Draco noticing. “That’s the headmistress’ office. She’s probably sitting at her desk.”
“I think he’s afraid you’ll steal his falafel,” Potter said with a grin. Somebody, thought Draco, should tell him that gloating was not an attractive quality. Although, if he was honest, it didn’t do much to diminish Potter’s appeal, and –
The corner of Parvati’s mouth quirked upwards ever so slightly. “That may just be the single most unlikely thing I’ve heard this year.”
Draco frowns. “It wouldn’t be unlike them to be the ringleaders, I suppose,” he concedes. “The whole thing started with those bloody Bakewell tarts; it was probably when Pansy infected her.” It’s a rather frightening thought, Pansy and Granger joining forces for anything.
He cleared his throat. “I do actually have a legitimate reason to question witnesses,” he said. “I need to know timeframes, how
“Are you talking about former Death Eater Draco Malfoy?” Ron asks, probably thinking he’s being sly. Harry does not approve and tries to catch Ron’s eye, an act that is probably at least partially to blame for caramel sauce suddenly dripping all over his workspace.
“I wish I could argue, but I see your point.” Draco sank onto the sofa with a tired sigh and stared at the festive red candles in large rectangular glass containers spelling out the word ‘NOËL’. The candles were surrounded by red and gold potpourri. It was the absolute antithesis of how he was feeling. “Is the sickening Gryffindorishness on purpose?”
Draco stood in the doorway to his office and wondered if he was actually going to faint. He’d been standing there for at least three minutes, his mind racing faster and faster as he tried to figure out what was going on.
“Oh. Not a bad idea.” She pulled her wand out and took the bookmark from between the pages, making Draco realize it was where she had noted down the code. “Secretum Lingua Videre Hallow,” she said, and touched her wand to the parchment.
“It’s mostly guesswork,” Draco admitted, reaching for his final syringe. Granger made a displeased sound, because clearly it wasn’t what she wanted to hear, but he wasn’t about to lie to her either. “I’m trying to protect the most essential systems the best I can. If he loses the use of his hands, that’s too bad, but we can try to fix it later. If he loses the use of his lungs, well, we might not get around to worrying about his hands.”
Potter probably didn't, in fact, at least not all of it, but Draco just wanted the conversation over with so he could focus on the potion. To his irritation, Potter kept right on talking.
“Hm?” Draco asked, rather distractedly, because volatile potions ingredients and wandering attention were not a good combination.
Draco wanted to interrupt, but he wasn’t at all certain that that wouldn’t make it worse. Harry knew Clearwater far better than he did.
Draco lowers his wand and stares at his utterly dense temporary ally. “Are you paying attention at all? Observing Daphne for signs of insanity!”
It was a while longer before Parvati had shaken off her paralysis. She looked at them all, then slowly down at her hands, then into Harry’s face.
“Why’s it all so cryptic though?” Weasley asked. “Why can’t you just be straightforward with yourself?”
“Brilliant.” Weasley beamed, then went back to looking puzzled. “Not sure what Christmas carols there are with an ‘L’, though – I always try to get out of singing them. The only one I’m fond of is the one with the hippogriffs.”
The defeated tone made Draco sigh deeply. Harry glanced at him, then away. Abruptly, he stopped. “Bollocks.”
Ron and Parkinson count down from ten with the crowd, and they’ve reached three when Harry realizes he’s forgotten the final flourish on his decoration, and he flings himself across the counter with a sieve and a spoonful of icing sugar, barely managing to get it on before the countdown ends and a stasis charm wraps around his creation.
Draco thought that perhaps he understood. It had to be difficult for her, waiting for the antidote. There was little she could do for Harry right now, and after two years spent mourning him, that
