He was nine when they met. It was during one of Wool's day trips to the beach which was the orphanage's way of placating the kids and to ensure they could avoid another gruel riot by buying them ice cream and letting them run in the sand for a full day.
He barely had time to apologize to the person when he lifted his head and discovered he had run into, who else, but Draco Malfoy.
His choice of words pained her greatly. It's why she stopped tracing his ear and said in a desperate plea, "You don't have to do this."
She turned her head to meet his gaze and as if reading his thoughts told him, "This must be a dream come true for you." When he was too dumbstruck to reply with anything other than a smile, she giggled and turned her eyes back to the ceiling. "You have bragging rights for life, professor. A lot of men would kill to be able to say they fucked a mermaid."
The two sisters exchanged another set of bewildered glances. How could this be? They asked another silently. Is it really too good to be true?
"Just kidding. I actually don't give a shit." Voldemort laughed as he began to twirl his gnarly wand in-between his fingers. "I heard about the cursed necklace though. What a spectacular failure that turned out to be, right?" He laughed again while Draco and Narcissa withered in silence. "Oh, it's a hard lesson to learn, Draco, I'm sure. I know it's hard for a lot of people their first time. I mean, not for me, of course. By the time I was your age I already successfully gotten away with five murders but I understand everyone's different." With that, he stood up and walked from around the kitchen table. Draco and Narcissa's spines straightened instinctively as he ventured towards them with a terrible smile curled along his lipless mouth. "Which is why I thought of the perfect punishment. It's harsh but fair and I think it'll drive home a very important lesson that I think all Death Eaters should learn." He reached forward and grabbed Draco by the jawbone. He was so close Draco could smell the fresh blood on Nagini's breath. "You can't be afraid to get your hands dirty."
With that, the Dark Lord left but Lucius and Narcissa waited, holding absolutely still, until the familiar sounds of apparition winds told them they were alone and, temporarily, safe from his wrath.
Nagini, sick of being touched, nipped at the back of Ariel's hand as a way of saying, 'stop fucking touching me', then continued crawling along the sofa doing as she damn well pleased. Ariel drew her hand in time, missing both fangs, but felt the longer tear the back of her hand and leave behind a dripping puncture wound.
Ariel waited for him to hear his mistake. When he didn't, she said, "You know what? I think I will take up Severus's offer then."
"I wanted the freedom, mate. I wanted to get off of class at noon tomorrow and know that I'll have sixty hours of not having to do anything to look forward to."
"Hello," she said her voice so smooth and sweet one would have believed she was made entirely of whipped cream.
"Aw, a sister day. Sounds delightful," he said with a grin, his head turned slightly towards the bookshelf. He had finally spotted the book he needed out of the corner of his eye. A slender black spellbook for which held the curse he needed. He grabbed the book with one hand and turned to leave, telling Ariel, "Well I won't keep you. I hope you enjoy your day. We should do lunch soon."
He was in the wine cellar, cradling his wretched hand against his side, while his wand-bearing hand waved over every inch of the walls, searching, hoping, for a sign of disturbance when the sound of footsteps landing from above snapped him out of his thoughts.
"Oh I don't mean to stay long I have so many errands to run—" With Lucius back in prison and her sister dead she was constantly filling her days with errands. "But there was another thing I wanted to drop off to you."
The atmosphere of the room changed profoundly. Silent fear died out to give way for murmurs of intrigue and eventual applause. Draco forced himself to clap despite the disgust that stabbed his stomach. If the Dark Lord liked someone, that meant they had to be fucked up beyond reproach and here he was practically gushing over this creature whom Draco couldn't help notice hadn't lifted her gaze away from the table as if embarrassed by the attention.
"Would you just stop asking me all these damned questions!" Harry spun around, abrupt, throwing him off. Draco stumbled to a stop in front of him, brow raised. "It's getting on my nerves."
"I thought... Blaise and I thought you were..." She's pressing the back of her wrist to her mouth, as if she's going to be sick. "Oh God—"
Draco keeps his face careful. "I know they felt like all you had. And you weren't wrong, when you said that I was more in love with a dream than you."
"I'm sorry I didn't..." Harry says. He frowns, looking down at his hands. "I wasn't there enough either, was I?"
Draco raised his fingers, a thumb against the pad of a finger, as if counting them off. "Pansy's married some filthy rich pureblood in Greece. Salazar, he's old. Blaise is somewhere in Italy, doing who knows what. Greg is… going through a hard time. I don't know. He's the one I still owl out of them anymore, but he rarely replies. Luna…"
"Don't talk, Potter," was what Malfoy responded with. He looked flustered, sort of annoyed, not looking at him. "Don't think about it either."
Draco clears his throat roughly, and there's a rustling sound on the other end, like he's shuffling around on the bed. Harry's learned from this that he's quite the restless person. "She wanted me somewhere
Elias nodded, and then huffed a smile. "Alright," he said, just as quietly, sounding relieved. He reached across, put his drink down on the table. Then he lifted up, leaned forward on his knee and whispered, "God, I was so hoping you'd say that."
Hermione shook her head slowly. "Nothing, Harry. Just… It doesn't sound like Malfoy, does it? To do anything just because
"No. Let me finish, Harry. So... then I had thought I could make myself not feel anything for you at all, and hate you, and take my life back. Only, that isn't quite how that works and…" Draco's voice trailed off. He was now moving on to soaping Harry's body, his shoulders and chest and back. His voice went quieter as he said, "And you were just so lovely. And good. And I realised, that day I saw how you were with my mother... I realised then that there was no way that I couldn't love you."
Harry was looking at him, wondering if what he said might have sounded very odd and abnormal, which he supposed it did, going by the faint line between Draco's brows, the way he was looking back at him. He'd been doing everything for himself since he was four, and it felt so normal to him that he sometimes forgot it wasn't quite normal for everybody else. "I'm… I mean, I'm quite alright with it. I'd say it was better than my aunt giving my cousin a bath until he was like, eight."
"Oh, alright." She shook her bushy hair out of her face, pausing at the mess on the table, and then dragged one of the chairs over to the counter, Harry doing the same. She put the book down on the countertop. "Well, so. I brought this
"Stop before all this comes off again?" Harry asked, stopping, laughing, and Draco huffed too, noses and foreheads pressed together. He was watching his own fingers play with the button of his collar, in the little space between them. Harry tilted his chin up quickly, gave his lips a hard kiss again. "Stop looking like that then."
Neville drinks a sip of his butterbeer. "How am I doing sharing a room with my former bully, you mean?"
He was interrupted by a loud sound, a roar of fire from the other room. Molly came rushing inside as Ron and Hermione stood up, and was onto them by the next second, touching Hermione's shoulder, Harry's face with both hands, her eyes looking Ron up and down, frantically asking, "What's happening? Merlin,
Later, it was confirmed by the cursebreaker that there was no possibility for the curse to be deliberately passed on. It was transmitted via physical contact, but not necessarily to just anyone. The reasons were unclear, still, as to how it operated when choosing a secondary party, but it was made clear that the curse was what made its choice, not Malfoy, and that was that.
Towards the end of their stay at the restaurant, before the bill came and all he way until they were leaving, Malfoy had been regaling him with a hysterical tale involving his friends, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott and love potion pranks gone wrong, and Harry found himself laughing all throughout, his stomach pained with how hard he laughed and his cheeks aching and his eyes tearing by the end of it.
whileatwiltshire: my alphareader and beloved friend, who has read through this story at its WORST over a course of months, and was still so patient and supportive and kind. You have helped me so much through this by letting me discuss this fic with you, always giving me such in-depth and thoughtful answers to all my concerns and questions, breaking me out of my writer's block with all your suggested scenes and ideas. Probably would have been lost in that mess if it weren't for you
Then it's another silence, and just when Harry opens his mouth to break it, to take his request back—
Potter doesn't leave. He slides off the mattress, and instead settles down beside his bed on the floor. He adjusts on his legs, his chin cushioned on his arm, and then begins to talk. His voice is quiet and rough with lingering slumber, the sound of soft kisses, of wild dancing and unbridled laughter filling his head.
Some days are like these, where his restlessness and hunger feels like it will never be satisfied — where all he wants is to go back.
Harry closed his eyes, throat dry, his chest moving shallow and unsteady. His hands craved. His body craved. He could smell the intoxicating scent of his body, the fancy cologne, the shampoo in his damp hair.
"Do you know why I was so angry at you?" Draco asked. He glanced at Harry's, quick, perhaps seeing Harry's uncertainty.  "You thought it was because you pushed the alteration on me. But I was, more than anything, angry at the cost of being in love with you."
Some of the tension, that's been following Harry all through the day, drains from his body. Still, his heart feels tight in his chest, his head aching as if it's split in two directions.
Draco hummed, on the cusp of sleep. By the time his breathing fell deep into it—a cadenced lilt of faint squeaks when he inhaled, the soft sound of his exhales—Harry still couldn't think of anything else to tell him, watching the gentle close of his eyes, the steady rise and fall of his body. Between them was his hand, the back of it to the mattress, and the loose curl of his fingers. Harry curled his own around them, tucked a thumb into the inside of his palm. Stroked it softly.
He still has his drawings and notes and letters, tucked away in a locked drawer, that he doesn't think he can ever open again, but the space weighs with it all whenever he looks at it. There's a part of him that thinks,
"Neither did I," Harry said, only because he didn't quite know what to say either. They hadn't spoken much for about two years now, not through Eighth Year, meeting eyes in passing. Not through this year.
It was an extremely boring and mundane fact. But Harry got the feeling that that didn't really matter all that much right now.
"I got lost in a Muggle district once," he says, after he'd told Harry of the major religions in the muggle world, which Harry already knew of, but it's not so much the words as it is his voice that he wants to fall asleep to.
Harry swallows, frowning. The love he felt mingled with shame, a complicated ball of emotions. He feels it for Ginny, who respected him and protected him even after what he did. He feels it for the boy he loves, that he hurt so terribly that he left everything behind.
3) The candidate(s) would oblige all instructions, if any, of the curse-alterers and medimagical staff following the Alteration. If failed to do so, the resulting outcome would not be due to fault of the staff, and legal action may be taken if necessary against the responsible party.
AFTER SCHOOL AND HE HASN'T BEEN FOUND SINCE! HE DIDN'T RETURN LAST NIGHT, HE HASN'T SHOWN UP FOR HIS CLASSES TODAY AND WE HAVE LOOKED
But while Harry really did find it a lot better to not constantly be on the guard whenever he saw his old childhood rival, it was also just… unsettling, to see him the way he was now.
think, if I wasn't going to be an Auror, I'd want to help George with the shop, so maybe… maybe I could go and do that instead."
Malfoy's face was just a little over his, tilted very close to it. Harry felt the nearness of him with a painful vividity, as if his senses had heightened. "You want me." It was a breath near Harry's ear, a low timbre of his voice.  "I've seen the way you look at me."
Harry looked up after a long moment, slow and furtive from under his own brows, upon the blurry movement of Malfoy's head, a slight turn of it. A quirk was at one corner of Malfoy's lips—all crooked canine, the hint of the fold of a dimple. He was studying his parchment, quill still against his mouth. Then he straightened, shoulders rising, and began to write again.
Softened silver met green, then, Malfoy's face strangely mellow, and the upturn of one corner of his lips even more so.
"Did you know that… that no matter how perfect, nothing can ever stay perfect?" Malfoy said softly, after a long silence, fixated on the sky. Harry looked over, fixated on him. "You know, because—one way or another, something always ruins it, such as— as you yourself or your mind or forces beyond you."
And so it goes, the two of them like strangers with histories, relearning the new people they were shaped into by the years.
The world screeches to a halt, his mind slamming against the understanding. Harry can't move, or breathe, or think. He feels a bit lightheaded from the way the air is no longer reaching his lungs fully. He swallows, blinks quickly, feeling like there's too much his mind is trying to take in, and yet taking in nothing at all.
"No." Malfoy had left around the time Harry got home, but he hadn't said where. Harry didn't ask either.
It was a long while later that he finally straightened, with a sharp inhale, running both hands down his face. He stood up quickly, moving to his side of the bed on his feet so as to not jostle the mattress and wake Malfoy. He climbed up and shifted under his own covers.
Harry opens the box of letters almost two months after, and spends an entire night reading every single letter with careful attention, his heart a painful throb up to his throat.
Draco shoves the hands off, shoves at a body in the dark, frantic and desperate and blind. He gasps for air, his throat hoarse and raw. His brain is foggy, his body languid and heavy, exhaustion making him all numb and drowsy. Then there's light, a face coming into his vision through the pinch in his gaze, through the blur and grit, his chest heaving. Slowing.
As they're waiting for dinner, Harry sits there and observes them. Somehow they come upon the topic of Obliviation procedures, and Hermione is clearly fascinated by the mechanisms of what Draco tells her. It's different from a normal Obliviation, much more pointed and specific, almost like a magical surgery. Neville and Ron are interested in the tattoos on Draco's forearms, and Draco is interested in the tattoos all along Charlie's arms and down his neck, and Ron is explaining his own ideas for what he's always considered getting.
"Do you know where that is?" Malfoy asked, perhaps taking his silence as uncertainty. "It's at the portrait of the fruit bowl on the—"
"Can I ask you something?" Potter says. They're lying together on Draco's bed, an arm around his waist. Longbottom is off to wherever he went, probably with Luna, just as Weasley is off with Granger, and Potter snuck in after a coin call.
"Go with the blue and black one," Harry suggests, and then grins, shaping his voice into an absurdly dramatic, faint and drawn out sort of tone, like a lovesick girl, saying, "It brings out your eyes."
"Settle down with your mother bear tendencies, you all. I only want to speak to him for a moment," Malfoy drawled with a roll of his eyes, when he noticed their suspicious stares. "I promise I will give him back in one piece."
"Yeah," Harry says, grinning back at him. "Yeah, it is." And then tells them about their lunch together.
"My feelings for you have always been this muddled, confusing thing tangled up in a hundred other feelings, and…" There was the sound of a small scrape off-camera. "And hatred was the clearest one that I could make sense of, the way I thought about you all the time. It was quite unhealthy, I believe. The way I centred around you. Always chasing after you."
They found that the bond was hardly much of a presence anymore, after getting what it wanted, because they could stay away from each other for hours without it acting up now, but he'd made such a habit of being close to Draco that he felt strange without him anyway. Finding Draco at home once they'd returned from visits to their families, kissing each other and putting their hands under each other's shirt to get at skin, told Harry he wasn't the only one, the two of them laughing in a bashful amusement into each other's lips.
"Get out," is what Draco snarls to that, with a flare of his nostrils. "If that is all you have to say after ignoring me for weeks, then spare me the rest of this conversation. I have better things to do than to listen to you."
Malfoy's eyes had sunken into his sockets as well. He was particularly irritable and moody, all satirical quips and expressions, and they'd snap at each other left and right, or complain and fight over everything they were initially trying to force a lot more composure and patience for, like Harry tussling around too much at night, like how long Malfoy took in the bathroom, didn't clean his hair out of the drain, left all his things over the kitchen table, over something seemingly trivial.
"Your stuff is our stuff," Hermione said, trying to meet his eyes from below, smiling in a wavering sort of way.
"I should go," Harry said, as he slowly hoisted himself up into a sitting position. Even as he said it, though, he found his body feeling rooted to the grassy ground, leaning back on his palms.
A smile twitched at Harry's cheek. He quickly looked down at Teddy, brushing his fingers through his bright blue hair to occupy himself. He was the most unmoving Harry had ever seen him be, enthralled as he watched his own little toes being coloured in.
He tugs a parchment close to himself, the ink bottle with the quill dipped in it. He picks it up, wiping excess ink on the edges. His fingers hover over the top of the parchment.
But Blaise is perfectly amicable to him, asks him if he'd like a drink. Pansy is civil only as much as she needs to be, for Draco's sake, but it's clear that she doesn't like him.
Draco snorts, a quirk at a corner of his mouth, eyes bright. He tips his head in a nod, all slow and subtle grace. "Goodnight, then, Potter."
Some days, Draco spends most of his time with Luna, and Longbottom as well whenever he joins her. It's stiff and odd at first, being in Longbottom's company, but eventually the tension does ease up into a casual sort of acquaintance, the two of them linked together by a mutual friend. They drink together at pubs occasionally, walk through the village and converse, or mostly listen on Draco's part to Luna and Longbottom's discussions regarding some rather peculiar topics. Coming back to the dorm is still in silence after this, but not always.
It didn't help, Narcissa suspected, that this creature—this pseudo-siren—was beautiful. Extremely beautiful in fact. Though she doubted this meant anything to the Dark Lord, Narcissa knew this only served to enrage Bellatrix more.
Voldemort shushed him then used his wand to send Nagini through the air like a venomous blimp. Draco's heart raced when he saw the mischievous glint in the Dark Lord's eyes. He should have known. He wasn't there to clean up a dusty house. He was there to help because the Dark Lord wanted little Draco would dispose of Ariel's corpse and to know: no one was spared from his wrath. Not even his own mother.
Ariel laughed, tears in her eyes. Happy tears. Endeared tears. Relieved tears. "I love you so much, T—" She amended herself. He wasn't Tom. He hadn't been for years. "Lord Voldemort."
"Wait wait wait I got one. The Twat Lord," interjected Tom. "No, wait that sucked. Attina's was better."
"Perfect. After that, I don't know. I guess look up some old friends." She gave him a sly look when she added, "Possibly go on a date with this young, golden throated professor I just met. If he ever gets around to telling me his schedule."
But he was so hungry and weary at that moment it didn't even matter to him that this was possibly his last meal. At least, he thought as he ventured towards the kitchen, I'll get a last meal. Most people don't get that privilege when it came to the Dark Lord.
Ariel watched in amazement as gravity-defying Nagini followed the vertical path of the wall and continue upside down across the ceiling. "What is she doing?"
His outburst caused the three seated adults to turn their attention to him and Narcissa who was quietly conjoining seats for them.
"Exactly," said Voldemort in a voice so flat and devoid of emotion it turned the hairs on the back of Snape's neck into porcupine quills. It didn't help in Ariel's sweet voice with her angelic face it only doubled his dread. Then in a brighter voice, he said, "I'm Aria and you're my sister Adella and we've been held hostage by Lord Voldemort for the last 4 months."
Voldemort started to laugh. "'Shrine boy'. Merlin's Beard," He leaned in and told her conspiratorially, "You know, until you came, I thought about hiding the shrine while he was away at school. That way I could watch his face as he tried to find it without asking anybody if they have seen it because how was he going to go around asking people if they'd seen his Harry Potter shrine?" His sentence ended in a fit of snickers.
With one person bearing much of the weight of the bond's magic, negative emotions were predisposed to hold an effect on Malfoy in a way it hadn't for either of them before. It might be gradual, accumulative, eventually showing with time. It might affect him as it came and went. This was to be determined.
Potter settles down beside him after a moment, pushing his nose over to Draco's hairline, murmuring, "And you're mine."
Hermione smiles when Harry tells her about it, sort of delighted behind the rim of her drink. She's always liked creating influence, even in odd little ways. "Tell him Hermione Granger approves of his work," she says, turning it over in her hand. Harry grins, and tells him so later.
"Five years," Harry mumbled at their nightcap. His head was over the back of the couch, his drink between his lap. "How am I supposed to…"
Draco's throat convulses. He feels over the edge of a damp leaf scraping against his finger, grounding his senses into the planting of his shoes against the earth, the swell and sink of clean air moving through himself. It's a sweet and sickening pluck at the strings of his heart, hearing the sound of his own name in that lovely, quiet voice.
There, he said nothing for a few seconds. Whatever he'd moved aside before, he seemed to be fiddling with it a bit.
On Saturday, Hermione had come by before breakfast to check on him. She was sitting with a chair pulled up to the counter, reading the papers as she listened to Harry telling her about Elias whilst bustling about the kitchen. She looked up when he got to the way the curse had reacted at the end of the story, frowning.
The rise of the footsteps on the stairs were light and quick, and then Draco was appearing in the doorway, halting suddenly at the sight of Harry. He seemed a little ruffled and breathless, as if he'd come in a hurry, and for a moment, they just looked at each other in the distance between them, locked right where they were, Harry sat on the bed, turned wholly towards him.
Draco was shivering, breathing unsteadily, tensed and taut all against him. Harry held him closer, tighter, kept on whispering nonsense and trying to soothe him with his hands, not knowing much else, not knowing what else to do. Even when he fell unconscious, Harry didn't move. He sat there very still in the roiling of his fear, afraid of letting him go, afraid he'd wake up again, that he wouldn't wake up at all. He sat there until his back began to ache, and he didn't know how long it must have been before he finally gained the courage to touch his hand to his chest again, feeling his heartbeat.
His mother's face pinches with sorrow, unfathomably. She takes his hand and kisses it. "But more than anything, he wanted to save you. It was all he talked about in the days before he died. Nothing else seemed to matter to him anymore but finding a way to get you out." She circles her thumb over the back of his hand. "I can admit, I had often loathed him for his flaws and skewed priorities, but I can also promise you he died loving you more than anything in the end."
Draco was quiet, just leaning against him. Harry wanted to see his face. He wanted to see if he was falling asleep, if he was crying, wanted to pull him wholly into his arms and hold him close to his shoulder and calm him with a kiss. But he just stroked his thumb over the side of Draco's hand, with a minute shift of his own cheek sliding against silky hair, adjusting for a firmer, more comfortable rest.
Harry looked away, ahead, wide and fixated at nothing.  He wiped his hand down his face, hard. "Ten hours," he repeated in a mutter. "Merlin."
Malfoy was trying to fumble the sheets off of him, out of the way, pushing his shirt up in frantic, quick movements to get his hands under it, and Harry swallowed, and only followed where the muddle of discontentment and need for relief took him.
Draco kissed him, and then kissed him and kissed him until they were rolling a little, Draco on top of him and Harry fully on his back, taking every one of them against his mouth with as much speed and ferocity, and then he was laughing a bit between each one, pulling Draco in even closer onto his body with an arm.
"Sorry I — I know this was a bit sudden, but I..." She laughs, seeming a bit high on her joy, their victory. "I missed you, and I can't stop thinking about you. I still... we have a long way to go, but I think we can make this work, Harry."
For a moment, there's nothing. Ron just stares at him, unreadable. He doesn't seem surprised, or confused about who he is talking about, just a bit like he's got confirmation of something he wondered, didn't quite believe yet.
"What do you think? Parents like ours don't truly care for wants and desires. They care only for duty."
He could only gather that somebody had disparaged and humiliated Narcissa whilst she was out somewhere, had spat on her and called her something awful.
Draco fell asleep as soon as he climbed into bed, Harry's glasses and both their suits, belts and shoes off, as he curled up in the tangle of Harry's arms against his chest.
It was sure to be good news with her, unless Merlin forbid she had gotten an E on one of her subjects, then it depended on what her idea of
Around mid-August came the day of the gala, the venue of which was to be Malfoy Manor. Harry was made the guest of honour, and an auction would be held to buy two hours of Harry's time.
" He wedged himself into the space between Malfoy and the back of the couch, blinking hard and fast, a sound bubbling at the base of his throat, a sob choked down.
Sometimes he would sit there, on his stool in front of his easel and canvas, and all he would be able to think about was a yellow streetlight at a pier, a hand around a wine bottle. Firelights and the body of a violin under a chin, a hand around the fingerboard, the other around a bow, a lovely and serene face. A satin lavender robe, the bright daylight of a kitchen. The wind playing up the waves of white-blond hair, eyes bright with the exhilaration of flying. A white shirt, a sweet apostrophe smile. Sometimes he would end up painting those images, always keep them away in a box at the corner of a drawer.
"That is all." It sounded parroted, followed with a wry snort. "The common pureblood ideology, you see, is that marriage is duty. A contract, if you will, between two families. It requires only two things, respect and loyalty, in order to survive." Draco smirked, tossing him a glance. "One out of two, I suppose. And even that being forced. How wonderful."
When Malfoy's face crossed the inches of distance between them, his heart jolted into rapid beats again, the feeling of it pounding against his sternum. Malfoy's mouth pressed against his own, one soft, chaste kiss that was enough to steal all of his breaths away, pleasurable tingles radiating from his lips and down his spine.
Ginevra is holding Potter's hand. She is looking at Granger and Ronald across from her as she speaks, gesturing with her free hand as she supposedly tells them a humorous story, Potter staring on at her with the lingering grin of prior laughter.
"This isn't pity." He sighs. "Look, full disclosure, I spent too much of my life doing things I didn't want to do to invest myself into things I don't care for. So can we not do this again? This whole… you pushing me away thing. It was tiring then, and it's tiring now."
He ate it that afternoon whilst sitting on the counter, though half-heartedly so, and thought of it again, the strange kindness and care of the gesture. Then his thoughts warped, inexplicably, into his uncle yelling at him in his tiny cupboard, his aunt shrieking he didn't deserve to eat dinner, that he was living under their roof and they did him a favour by keeping him and giving him anything at all.
Harry grinned. He lowered his head in the little space between them to take his hand, Draco's head also lowered, watching him slide the ring into his finger. It was fitted, right above the silver band that symbolised their lack of choices, and now the moonstone gem and silver patterns that said,
Hermione straightened at the sound of his voice, but she didn't seem to know what to say for a moment.
But Malfoy didn't say anything about his tardiness, when Harry did arrive in his drawing room. He sat with a wine glass in hand, facing the fire until he noticed Harry come in.
Then there was cake, Andromeda's hand firm over Teddy's around the hilt of a blunted cake knife, gently guiding him to cut through it. A small part of it went wasted in a cake fight, all the Weasley siblings smearing it over each other's faces,
The silence came over them again. Draco was looking up at him, still the lingering wisp of a smile at a corner of his lips. He hadn't showered in days, so exhausted he was now. Harry knew then that he must love him something terrible, because he didn't mind that, that he smelled faintly of sweat and illness and what was uniquely himself. That he still wanted to press a kiss to his neck.
"Is that all he does, do you think?" Harry asked, out of nowhere, scoffing. "Just studies? He was studying all through the hols too."
"It was worth a try," was what Harry said, looking back down at his plate, putting up an insouciant facade as he collected a bite on his spoon.
In the haze of dawn, Harry woke up to movement stirring up against his chest. He sobered up instant and wide-awake, his mind still full of everything that wasn't getting through to him. He pushed himself up quickly onto a shoulder as a hand moved back from Draco's belly, up onto his waist, trying to see him. He still had his eyes closed, brows furrowed. A moment later, he opened them, lit under the fade of sunrise, scarlet-circled. He turned a little in the circle of his arms, finding Harry's own eyes.
They had drinks together, leaning sideways on the couch, arms sprawled across the back of it. Elias' temple was supported on the curl of his fingers, and their legs touched as they talked in front of the burning fireplace, chasing away the January cold, talking about a lot of things. Elias pointed out the ring on his middle finger, asking, "what's it for?"
"Nah, mate," Ron said, throwing him a glance, slightly concerned. "Sit down. We're almost done here anyway, and I'm guessing after whatever happened with Malfoy, you need a breather."
Harry came to stand next to him and grabbed two mugs from the cabinet above. He heated the kettle on the stove, poured the boiling water in two mugs after it was done. He put five sugars, two spoons of milk in one, and slid it over.
"I'm sorry for the way I had left," Draco says, after a while, his voice low. "Without a word to you."
"Some—" There is a hesitant pause, and then a sigh. "Some part of me still doesn't like saying these things."
His heart is an odd flutter in his throat, his hands quivering from a jittery emotion, nerves or excitement, he can't quite tell. He's had too many drinks, maybe. He pushes his fists further in his pockets, bemused with himself. "Well, then. Good night."
"Oh," Draco said, strained, swallowed hard again, once, twice. His eyes were going everywhere, blinking fast. There was a tremor of something running through his face. "Oh."
They were home again, back in Grimmauld Place. While Draco was off for a shower, Harry sat in their bed, roving through it all in his camera. He had to have another memory card, because the last one had gotten full. It had many blurred pictures of Draco, but he didn't delete any of them. He wanted them all.
Malfoy's face had regained colour again, a splotch of pink high in his cheeks. He'd fallen asleep against Harry, was breathing steady and soft near the tensed muscle of Harry's neck, craning to see him. Harry touched his chest, feeling the rise and fall of it against his trembling fingers, the beating of his heart. He let his head fall back with a slow, shuddering exhale, deflating his shoulders, his eyes closing. He swallowed. The waves of relief chased away the leftover fear, leaving him exhausted, his confusion a distant thing in the face of it all.
In the mirror over Draco's shoulder, upon the turn of another half-circle, Harry could see the two of them, pressed close and achingly intimate to each other. Could see his own hands, broad over the waist of Draco's white shirt. Could see Draco with his arms all around Harry's neck, mouth pressed into his shoulder, nose tucked into it. The two of them, by a lamplight, making them all golden and warm.
He puts it on, adjusting the formal robes. He'd borrowed it from Harry, so they're somewhat short on him, but he casts a few spells that resize it to his fitting. "Right. So. Go out with Ginny, yeah? Don't be alone."
Far off over her shoulder, there's Ron in all his Quidditch gear, flushed red and grinning. He's glancing at Angelina next to him as he says something to her, throwing the two of them a glance again.
He doesn't realize his breathing sounds so loud in the room until Longbottom's voice lightens slightly, "I'm not saying you did. But honestly? I do worry that maybe she sees you and remembers your family, being captive in your home."
. "It's the only reason they didn't throw you in Azkaban, isn't it? Potter's testimony? What'd you lie to him with to keep you out?"
Sometimes Draco would take a step towards him, and Harry would turn and leave, not entirely certain why. Only that something keeps him rooted back, an intangible sort of tension, like trying to break through a thick, rubbery film of resistance and confusion in his mind, like if he went to him, he wouldn't know how to act around him. And yet, a need, a desire to be with him again brimming just behind it.
Draco still hadn't woken, his face so close on the pillow to his own that Harry could see his flaxen eyelashes settled against the skin beneath his eyes. Timelessly, he watched him, observing everything of his beauty as the two of them laid buried under blankets up to their shoulders. He visually outlined his cheekbones, much more visible now than they used to be, and the fairness of his skin, and the full, pink lips parted to breathe in his sleep. He reached and traced it all with his fingers, stroking cheek to mouth, thinking of how close he came to never seeing any of it again. His fingers trembled.
Harry made his way over, climbed onto the bed on one knee and leaned over Draco, arms outstretched on either side of his head. He took in the smile on the other boy's face with a soft one of his own, wanting nothing more than to keep it there, to make him keep smiling and laughing whenever he could, especially after how long it had been until yesterday since he had. He craned his head down to kiss Draco's lips, gentle and pliant and parted slightly under his own as he kissed him back.
didn't quite—leave much room—but I preferred being close to them anyway because—" His voice faded off, throwing a quick glance at Harry's face again, back down at the top of his drink. He made a sort of scoff in his chest, one corner of his mouth curling mirthlessly. "You think I'm pathetic."
Harry watched him for a moment, sitting alone on his own, an empty chair next to him. He was tugging out his Eighth-Year Potions book from his satchel, thin fingers wrapping around the spine of it.
he had been very strangely taken in by it, seeming to contemplate the concept of movies and shows for a while after. Harry hadn't known that was what was happening, when he went quiet. Five minutes later, he was piping up with a question,
He lifts his hand again, tries to focus on bringing his magic back to the forefront and into his fingers. It takes too long for the little glowing lines to form, but eventually they come, swirling around his hands. He draws them into a constellation, a dragon's head, a secret all for himself. Luna smiles and draws a half-crescent moon among them, white among gold.
Madam Aileen shrugs. "Everybody loves and craves. Fame and fortune. Status and talent. All things you can love and crave, can't you? But as far as I know, it isn't for those who don't love and crave a
"Where are all your friends from school?" Harry asked, after the second time he got the bottle back. "I mean. You never have anybody over except your mum now."
Harry did. It was possible to ignore grief when it wasn't staring him right in the face. When he didn't see his loss in Ginny's eyes. Didn't see what it did to her. His eyes sting, his heart full with love and grief. "I did," he says, very quietly, finally feels something of his own. "I do."
They both turned around, and found a man walking down at the adjacent end of the street with a woman who seemed to be trying to talk him out of it. He was sneering at them. They must have been at the restaurant.
She'll force them into doing their homework and studying for upcoming tests, or at least she will to Harry on the latter, trying to persuade him to begin preparing for his NEWTs
It was another moment after that the tension finally lessened, in a small dip of his shoulders, minutely at first, and then — altogether.
Sometimes he's still not sure if he didn't only dream or imagine it. It's been weeks and he hasn't been able to fully acknowledge what had happened, what he'd learned, beyond a vague, distant thought that doesn't sink into his brain, a memory, quickly blinked away. Yet it came back over and over like the sea, his heart left pounding wild and erratic in his throat, his lips thrumming with a phantom kiss. It keeps him awake half of the nights and he can't quite explain why.
"He won't tell me. There is a lot he won't talk about anymore with me, ever since the war." Narcissa smiled, ruefully. "But I've seen this before, Harry."
I know some people don't like one of the characters being with a character outside of the ship, so just a quick heads up that there's a very brief thing (just one section) with Harry and an OC!
, the warmth of his hand just like this. He thought of passing out drunk in couches, waking up in beds. Thought of meals on the counter, under stasis. The Calming Draughts in his medicine cabinet.
by his collarbone, to remind himself that magic was still beautiful. That he can feel it now, again.
"Well. It didn't entirely go according to plan," he said, tossing it lightly on the table in front of them. "But they did describe us as a 'power couple' and wrote it as 'the happy evening for the lovebirds came to an end'—"
Then abruptly, with a hand on Harry's shoulder, Draco pushed himself back with a straighten of his arm and let go, and then he was gone, Harry left standing there with his heart pounding and tight and tender, craving after him.
They'd been doing good, and then Harry had turned around and ruined it all, talked to him so awfully.
Harry walked inside only then. "Hello," he said in general, moving over to kiss Draco chastely on the lips. Draco seemed a bit dazed by it, flicking a glance over at Ron and Hermione.
"And what else were we supposed to do then?" Harry asked, trying to sound controlled, to keep his voice low and calm. "I wasn't going to just sit there knowing I'd be stuck to you for decades and do nothing about it! Would you rather we'd have taken no chances at all to better our circumstances, then? Just twiddle our thumbs waiting for something that would never come up? This was
Harry had decided to take up volunteering work instead of going back to his shop. He had no real plans, and that was alright with him. He would go wherever he was taken, and figure out where he fit most. Where he wanted to be. Because his life did not have to be condensed into a single, grand plan or meaning and passion. It could just be full of small plans and meanings and passions until he wanted to move on to something else. Draco said he was lucky to be able to afford this luxury and freedom, and he could use it if he liked, and he could do good in the world with what he had alongside it. Harry had already given away a good amount of his wealth to organisations that would better the world, but he did still have enough to last him a long while.
To imagine Draco Malfoy having any such feelings for him for any length of time—when he's never given the slightest indication in the past nor so in the present—it's difficult to imagine at all. There are times, at night in particular as the memory plays in his mind over and over, when the questions come, all the whys and the hows, but it leaves him reeling and exhausted and eventually he gives up trying to work out anything.
He was told to stay with Draco in the room, to maintain contact, so he did. So he slid in behind him, settled him back carefully against his chest. So he pushed his fingers between the spaces of Draco's, held the pointed, delicate knuckles of his other hand, firm over Draco's abdomen. He was explaining to this Healer as much of the situation as possible, as much as he could, through the fog overtaking his brain, whilst Draco was being examined.
“You really didn’t?” Harry asks without his eyes moving from the screen. He keeps his voice light and non-accusing, though maybe sometimes it still does sting to think about. What it led to. The years after. “You couldn’t imagine at all how he’d feel?”
Harry woke up fully lucid about four days later. Ron and Hermione were there beside him. They were there waiting outside the office, too, when Harry was called in to talk with the cursebreaker.
Draco made that same little scoffing noise. He turned away fully, then, back to clinking things, pouring things from one place to another. He added some shapeless lump, that Harry couldn't tell whether it was stone or wood, to the beaker, upturned it into his cauldron once it dissolved. Harry's mind fixed on the line of that lovely jaw. "We won't even call each other by name."
It was taking too long to come into effect. Draco was leaning into his shoulder. Harry brushed a quivering hand down the nape of his neck, trying his hardest to keep himself calm. He had a tentative hold around Draco's waist.
For a moment, in the midst of the malaise sinking down on the hollows of his chest, sticking heavily onto his insides, he'd  wondered how he had come to this, and why Potter couldn't have just gotten fired up and wild this time as well.
Harry knows he should say something. He knows he should tell her... he should tell her he's with somebody else. He should tell her he no longer feels—
Draco's hands moves down to his cheeks, his jaw, smirking down at him. "You caught your foot in somebody's dress and fell on your face is what happened."
He wakes up to his mother beside him, the chair left empty in favour of kneeling on the floor to be nearer to him. Her hand is clutching the back of his to her own cheek, cushioned over her other arm.
He thinks of an arm around his abdomen. Lips at his cheek, his jaw, his shoulder. The high night sky above a Quidditch field, a half-moon amongst the stars. A kiss to his lips, slow and soft.
Draco reaches out to touch her arm, tugging at her. Narcissa is beginning to fall apart once more, falling forward into his shoulder, clutching at him, and his heart twists at his thin and frail mother, at the frantic sounds of her weeping, the sounds of the grief she still carried around with her of the last year.
somewhere all 18th century themed with elegant decor and style. It was a beautiful room, much too fancy for Harry's comfort, pistachio green walls with intricately patterned, golden borders and curtains. To the right of the massive bed, all neat white sheets and thick covers, a sliding door opened into the balcony, which looked out over the Place Vendome, and further in the distance, the Eiffel Tower.
The silence persists so long that Harry begins to think of how to break it. But he is also not entirely sure if Draco would want him to step in and defend him from a roomful of children...
But Harry had begun to notice the strange looks Draco gave him often, now. He had begun to notice the ways he went quiet at times. Harry never asked him what was wrong, afraid of what he would ask. What Harry would give away trying to answer, not being able to.
"Everybody knows about your Draco camera, Harry." Ginny grinned cheekily, her hands folded behind her. She was in her blue Weasley sweater. Everybody in the room was, outside of the Malfoys. "Draco showed Luna all the pictures of those places you two went through, and Luna told me the camera was mostly just full of pictures of him, and some recent ones of you taken by him, I suppose."
Later, by the floor of the bed, they sit together, Draco's stack of letters piled up in his old box. He's reading them, an odd, unfathomable frown on his face all throughout. Harry's touching his shoulder against his bicep reassuringly.
"I'm rather tired of people getting overly involved in my life," Draco said, whirling abruptly to face him at the foot of the stairs, forcing Harry to stumble to a stop. His gaze was flat on his own. "You have no right to say anything."
"We have to take you to St. Mungos," Hermione said, tugging at his hand. Molly came around his other side, taking his other arm, saying,
At dawn, they are nearly found by Filch before Harry throws the Invisibility cloak over the two of them. After having narrowly escaped trouble, watching Filch eye around suspiciously before deflating and leaving, Harry pulls the cloak off of them.
"Have you ever made stuff burst? Like in the cartoons when your hair goes all crazy and your face goes burnt?"
Nowadays, Draco would either be drifting in or out or awake and silent. Much of the time now, he was irritated and withdrawn, but there were times—when he was feeling somewhat better—that he would talk to Harry, trying to come out of his body and his mind, trying to grab onto something outside of it.
"Whatever, Potter. If you want to sit here and stare at nothing for several hours on end next to my bed-bound body again, suit yourself."
, folds it into a crane as he listens to the lecture—the theoretical aspects of the Gouging spell—and then sends it flying three seats up and on his left to Potter.
Draco's response came on their shared Charms class in the form of an animated doodle of an otter, all whiskers and snout and tail, with round glasses and a lightning scar at its head. He writes under it,
"Not terrible," Draco said. He was examining it closely, this way and that, an almost-impressed flick of his brows and downturn of his mouth.
his body, his hot and tender skin, and the warmth of his hands, encouraging, tightening where they dug up into his hair as Harry mouthed at the skin of his bare shoulder. The sound of his voice, sin and euphoria in his ear, breathlessly whispering,
And then Malfoy slid off his chair, dropped to one trouser-clad knee in front of Harry, and held up the silver ring between his fingers. Harry felt the eyes of the fifteen other patrons on them, and he huddled into himself under their scrutiny, his face and his body burning and sweaty. Malfoy was looking up at him from beneath his eyelashes, his face shaped into one of hope, silver eyes painfully tender, his grin small and painfully tender, his face flushed with it. Harry had to give it to the bastard, he was good at making it look real.
It was a redundant question, because there was only one answer to it, but Draco only said, "You ask a lot of questions."
He liked the way the blurry rays of the sun blinked above the wildened waves of white-blond hair on the screen, and then shadowed him where it got covered behind him, his voice only just loud over the hushed roar of weather and sound.
"I'm not very susceptible to them," Draco says, taking his wrist to stop him. Harry's skin raises in goosebumps, perhaps due to the change in temperature. Except it seems laced with something else, something that flutters in his chest. "And I'm rather tolerant of the winter as well, you see. Also,
Harry sighs, caving, and he does, telling him about everything and nothing. But his worry nags at him all throughout, the urge to go to him constantly breathing down his neck.
There was no answer. They knew something had gone wrong with the alteration, and with Malfoy, but they didn't know what exactly. Narcissa, like Malfoy, wouldn't be told anything either, as she was too close to Malfoy. This would be putting him at risk.
Harry realised only then that there was warmth in Malfoy's body, having seeped back somewhere in the middle of all that. When he could finally bring himself to look at him, heart pulsing wildly between his collarbones
At the end of the day, it all creeps back in. All his love turned to grief, running through him with nowhere to go.
Harry couldn't help the way his own smile came at that. Draco's eyes drifted away, then, turning his head. He raised the bottle to his mouth again, but the hint of a smile lasted, still, around it.
Draco stares at her, and it takes a few seconds to latch on to what she's said. His head feels full, even though his thoughts are foggy and slow. He's been thinking a lot these days. He's been thinking a lot about a cellar, and his dreams, and about Harry, about Potter. More than anything these days, Potter. He's been going away a lot.
"Um, yeah. The thing about being a primary school teacher that really likes listening to children talk? You pretty much know everybody's business. Do you really have the 'prettiest black alpaca' that you named Harold—? Okay, never mind," he backtracks sheepishly upon seeing Draco's mortified horror.
He was terrified that once Draco learned of what had happened, he would learn the rest too, everything Harry knew before he did. He was terrified of what it would do to him.
"Hello," Harry said, smiling down at him, and then that breath pushed out into a slightly thick, half-laugh.
He told him everything there, in his dreams. There was nothing he felt he couldn't say to him there, but maybe that was also because it was never things like these. It was all the little things like an exhausting day, an annoying encounter, a funny and ridiculous interaction. It was never things like these.
Ron shrugs. "He was, yeah. But… Speaking for Malfoy at his trial was one thing, and maybe even spending months in a hospital with him when he didn't have any of his family with him, but…"
But all he wants right now is to be close to Draco, to hold him, and to sleep right here. Just sleep right here, next to him.
Maybe Draco noticed, maybe he didn't. The music faded off into a quiet finish, and at the end of it, he spread his arms, one hand around a bow and the other around the neck of the violin, and bowed in a sarcastic sort of curtsy. "I only accept praise," he said, smirking, and Harry laughed, somewhat fumbling in his drunken quickness, clapping his hands together. He was trying to affect a serious face and only barely passing.
"Kindly fuck off." Harry rolls his eyes. Draco grins at him, a canine crooked at one corner of his mouth. "Obviously you better be a lot more tactful with my mother. Perhaps begin with a
Even Draco was visibly impressed upon seeing it, seeming to struggle for words, and then saying, finally, "You really should have your own gallery some day."
On the weekends, Harry's at the Manor, having spent dinner with Narcissa and Draco when he comes into the room. In the green fire is Pansy's irritated face, and she's saying, with measured patience behind it, "Draco, what happens if… if the memories start coming back? Because you're around him all the time and things start coming up?"
Harry was caught in the question of what had him so suddenly withdrawn, if it was discomfort, but then he'd caught Draco smirking slightly at something he said, and for a reason Harry couldn't entirely fathom, it lingered in the back of his mind all throughout dinner. Harry looked over at him more often after this, after everything he said, even catching sight of a slight smile.
"Potter..." Malfoy sounded distant. More than anything, he sounded weary. "When I'm gone—if you ever think of me... try to remember me as who I was on this day, okay?"
He heard the answer in his head before Malfoy even said it. "The alteration, of course." Malfoy looked up at him, all hollow silver, mouth thinned. He'd put his spoon and fork down, another clink. "Was it worth it?"
And he is so infuriatingly beautiful that it makes Draco want to scream. And he understands it now, all these years later, why this man has always been a wonder to those around him.
There are a lot of things that Harry can't make sense of at that moment. He feels slow and stupid, blank-minded, and all he ends up saying into the long, uncomfortable silence that follows is, "I need to go."
"Salazar, please say something," Blaise is saying, his voice cracking. In his mind, Draco is going away somewhere else.
In this dim and grey world now, he is the only thing that is still as bright and beautiful as his dreams. Still the most beautiful boy he's ever seen. From a boy in a robe shop to the boy sitting here in front of him. From a boy in a robe shop to a man he'd spent a faux life with sitting beside him, holding his hand.
They were sitting on the rug, Harry's arms around Teddy, holding him on his lap as Draco took Teddy's foot in his hand
your life, and she may consider herself too dignified for it but today I say it is finally time to invoke—" But then he clamped his upper lip over his lower lip, tight, as if in restraint, looking away. He breathed, slowly, and spoke again only when he was calmer, "She had no part in any of… Surely you agree that—that she deserves better than this.
"I didn't know I needed an invitation to visit my family," Petunia said. She smiled, thin, and her eyes slid over to Harry. Her face fell, right there.
Nearing the end of November, Draco was healthier and better, eating well and warm and energised. He was picking up his violins, and re-enrolled into his potions classes, and rejoining his charity organisation. He was going around outside, visiting the people he loved, receiving them into their drawing room.
"Forbidden Forest." Potter's hand is soothing and firm at his side. He licks his lips, turns his face away. Then, quietly, "I died there."
They notice that too. It's in their faces, the way they falter at times, seem confused, a wavering smile. He keeps going away, coming back, came back so strange all these years later. He doesn't like being touched where he always used to initiate it, moves away from Pansy's hands now. He doesn't eat enough. He doesn't sleep right, trembles in his dreams. He does not talk about Harry Potter when that is all he once seemed to do, whenever they bring him up, ask him questions about him.
"I know." Draco looked at Harry, held him there for a moment. His arms were folded, lounging against the doorframe as he did. His hair was now a muss of a loosened plaited bun and braided crowns, a frizz of stray hairs lit in the daylight, free of the decorative pieces of last night. Even then, he looked unfairly, effortlessly lovely.
Harry watched him for a minute, the silhouette of him as he shifted around on the bed, mentally willing for him to get up and leave at the last second, and then realized that Malfoy fully intended to stay. "You're not staying here."
In certain moments of clarity, Draco thinks, often, that he should leave. That he should withdraw. That he should remember that nothing good will come out of this pitiful venture when it ends. But he always ends up letting Potter come back another day, always ends up staying just a little while longer to watch a bright and beautiful dream play out in Potter's eyes and smile, because it's the most awake that he's felt since he's woken up.
For a moment, something in Harry's chest shrivelled. Perhaps Malfoy did not enjoy his company as much as Harry had thought he did, if at all. Perhaps this was the end of it, this blooming—friendship, maybe, because Malfoy had his fun and now he was done with him. With that thought came a sudden influx of scorching anger borne of hurt, and the immense regret of baring his soul to a boy who clearly could never feel anything more than enmity or indifference for Harry.
One weekend, there is a knock on Harry's door. When he opens it, Draco is there. Harry stands frozen for a few seconds, broken only by a sudden, breathy laugh, folding over from his bald shock turned to joy. The next minute, he's flinging himself towards Draco, stood on his bare toes with his arms wrapped around his neck and head.
Somewhere within, Harry has already wondered of everything Pansy's said, this repressed doubt and fear, but hasn't quite let it resurface this way, so clear to himself. Not until now. He whirls on his feet, not quite able to meet Draco's eyes, just needing air out of this house.
"Right. Well," Harry said, weakened by the sudden and sharp awareness of his own secrets, quiet. He stood up to his feet. "I'm going to bed."
Harry cursed, a strangled gasp of his own, at the violent flare of thrill between their bodies, the electrifying pull between them, and he could feel him now. All of him. All of his weight, his heat, legs locked tight around his thighs. Malfoy pushed his fingers into his hair, tried to tilt his face up for a kiss.
Draco broke away with a gasp, pushing him back by the sides of his waist—Harry gripped his hands and kept them right there, overtaken by an overwhelming need for proximity and closeness. He stood up on his knees and threw his legs on either side of Draco's lap in a straddle, as if he could hold him right here and stop him from leaving, from leaving with a terrible finality that could never be reversed, from—
When Harry shuffled into the kitchen after his shower that morning, a towel around the nape of his neck, Draco was in the kitchen, looking fresh and clean after his own shower, white shirt tightened at the waistband of his pressed trousers. His hair was still damp, thick and tousled together from it, the side to Harry all tucked behind his ear, some of the fringe hanging free on the opposite side of his face. His head was tilted slightly over the stove, hand around the handle moving it around, buttoned sleeves pushed up a bit on a thin arm.
, and he always has plans. They meet at Quidditch practice, mostly, and sometimes at night, but then they're both so knackered that they don't really do more than kiss.
That night, Draco touches the curl of Harry's fingers, sleeping soundly, gently, beside him. He whispers, "My home is here, with you."
Harry remembered not seeing him there, an empty chair at the Slytherin table, thinking that their final day of NEWTs would have been the last he'd ever see of him.
"Alright," Draco says, and tries to push away all thoughts of just what he's agreeing to, tries to push away all thoughts of him. He looks at his mother, his thin and frail and broken mother, and knows only that he can no longer burden her. His throat convulses, and he clears it, his eyes trained on her. "If you need me to go there so much, then I will, for you."
Draco pushes the knot at Harry's collar with a thumb and finger, tightening and shaking it a little to make it tighter still. Harry grimaces as it presses into his throat, touching the knot of the tie and muttering, "that's...
" Harry straightens at the sound of his first name in Draco's voice. He's not sure he's ever heard Draco call him that. "
Draco tensed slightly against him, though his face stayed very much maintained on the smile. He glanced at Harry, quick, quicker to look away. "It wasn't quite ideal for either of us at first, as I'm sure you might have heard, but…" He trailed off, and the pause went a little too long, and he seemed a bit nervous. Harry thought, again, of the last time they'd been somewhere like this together, his own shameful lack of control as he'd snapped. The quiver of hurt in Draco's eyes, throwing the papers under Harry's face the next day.
Draco slips off of him quickly, seems sort of panicked. He looks ruffled up, with more of his hair out of his woollen hat, loose frizz of stray white-blond locks at either side of his temples, his eyes transfixed intensely at the snow-coated ground in front of him.
that things happen to, isn't it?" Malfoy said, with a hollow sort of smile. "You don't think that I had dreams and ambitions as well? Ones that are hindered now because I am stuck to you?"
Draco looks down. He traces a foggy fingerprint on the top of the desk, watching idly. "He cares for everyone. Even those he has no reason to care for." He supposes pity is the better word when it comes to what Potter feels for him, but saying this might tell her more than he'd like for her to know.
"Sorry," Draco whispered, brushing his fingers over the bridge of his nose. He was frowning, perhaps with remorse, his face softened and worn as that of one on the verge of slumber.  "Sorry for everything I... sorry."
Somehow Draco ends up staying there until midnight, the two of them lying together comfortably on the rug of the living room. Every now and then, Harry's socked feet bumps against his, the back of his hand pressing featherlight to Draco's own.
true, then, what they're saying," Potter's voice is pleasantly surprised and bordering on bemused awe, his face splitting into a slow, blinding grin. "You came back."
He took it out every day, whenever Draco wasn't around and he could, to practice all the wand movements that made his arms creak and his head hurt by the end of it, trying to memorise and painstakingly pronounce right all the words with the help of a spell that made the words go green whenever they were uttered correctly, red when they weren't.
Potter dips his head down at his sandwich, mumbling, "you didn't tell me what you wanted." Then he breathes a soft sigh. They don't talk for the rest of the quarter of an hour.
Draco was clearly tense, but he relaxed minutely upon Harry looking up at Teddy, feigning a merry smile, "Oh, look who's here!" And Teddy's exclamation of
"I know it's been years," she says, still, when Blaise is off getting him tea, and Draco has gone to the loo. "But I think it should be apologised for. What I tried to do in the war."
In the blur of a world tuning out of his senses, the hushed chorus of sound around them, he found himself saying, softly, "You look beautiful."
— nothing at all but to kiss that mouth of his, soften away the hard muscles around the tightness of his jaw. "Hello," Harry says instead, dumbly.
accompanied by a messy, inharmonious clap of his tiny hands, a small bounce of his body. He placed Teddy down at his feet, giving him a light push, saying, "go say hello," and watched him waddle-run over to Draco.
Then he heard it, through the fuzz of slumber still coating his mind, leadening his limbs. There was the sound of a shallow, erratic breathing throughout the room, a small shuddering. It was hushed, but even then, it was audible in the overall silence. Alarmed, he quickly leaned up onto a shoulder.
Draco stares up at the ceiling, heaving a slow breath. He hasn't looked at Potter, still, and he isn't planning to.
"I…" Draco pauses. A knot of muscle tightens at his jaw, jumping with the convulsion of his throat, peeking from the wrap of his black rollneck. "It can't be good for her. To be alone in a place like that all the time. But—" He stops there, blinking. His breathing quivers through his nose, close-mouthed. "Well. It's not quite a place anyone should want to return to anymore."
The first few days, Draco closed himself away as much as he could in his potions lab, adamant about keeping Harry at a distance, even when the curse would act up for the two of them. Even when he'd be bleeding out of his nose and into his collar, or be trembling with pain against a wall, sweaty and jaw clenched, he would shove him away when Harry reached for him, grinding out,
He ended up looking over anyway, a daily losing battle these days. Draco was still asleep, a hand under his cheek. His mouth was softened, muscles loose at the hollow of his cheeks, around his eyes. His prim and neat eyebrows were gently furrowed in slumber.
Harry frowned, looking at him again, and then frowned deeper. Malfoy was leaning against the doorway. His face seemed pale under the low light, but Harry couldn't entirely tell if it wasn't just the light. Malfoy had that kind of face, all sharp facial lines and delicate features.
"It's something to consider," he said. "I owled him a thread of the bond. He managed to work out the lifespan of the curse, Harry. Twenty years."
For the first few days, there was no fighting, even if only because, in their lingering exhaustion and recuperating, they weren't talking beyond necessary. Still, Harry was waiting for the outburst.
"I don't want you to go," she says, a frown on her face. "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. We can just sit here and not speak if you'd like."
"I don't want to go." Ron looks like a kicked crup, walking up the stairs to the third floor alongside Harry to begrudgingly meet up with Hermione at the library. "Merlin, save me."
Malfoy couldn't seem to rip his sunken gaze away from the waters, his hollow face ashen in the moonlight.
And then there were hands grabbing his bowed face carefully, turning it to the side towards another pale face leaning closely to his own, lowered to try and meet his eyes. Harry blinked as he lifted his gaze, locking with Malfoy's moonstone ones, and he was looking at him in the painfully tender way that he was looking at him in the restaurant during that fake proposal.
and they were rolling sideways and Draco was under him, laughing, a helpless sort of sound. Harry was laughing too, putting his forehead to his, watching him as Draco curled an arm around his neck, then another. Then Harry was kissing him all over his face, every part of him, his cheek and his jaw and his neck and his shoulder, touching him everywhere he could.
There's a long silence, but somehow it doesn't feel so much like a closing of the conversation, but an opening of one, leaving him space to fill it. She looks at him again, but doesn't say anything further.
"Come, darling." Narcissa smiles, a flicker of one, her eyelashes damp and clumped together, but her bittersweet joy crinkles into her eyes. Her hand falls as she turns away, coming up to wipe her thumb under her eyes and dabbing the tears on them away with fingers. "Let's talk over some lunch."
The videos were just as mundane too, just Draco, humming along quietly to a song playing in a car driving them towards their hotel, not noticing the camera on Harry's lap, turned on him, half-hidden behind a hand. Just Draco, pulling at Harry or shaking his arm off-frame. Draco, talking, explaining history and facts, regaling Harry with his own stories and prior travel experiences. Draco, walking along the sidewalk, head dipping down slightly as he smirked at Harry's retelling of a very uncomfortable encounter with a starstruck receptionist. Draco, turning his face into the camera, his grin crinkling into his eyes as his mouth moved, the rays of the sun behind his head, shadowed by him.
There are days, weeks, where Draco is guarded and low all over again, that might have to do with where he'd been in the war. Sometimes, he asks,
"It's alright," Draco says, raising his gaze to his. He looks back down again, when he takes Harry's hand instead. Harry's throat bobs, stuck onto his face, and
"No," Draco said, frowning for a second, before he seemed to understand what he'd let slip. "My parents and—I… I slept on the floor of their bedroom that year, because—well,
. Harry's laughter had gotten into it too, the way he'd grabbed at his wrist in a mindless, quick attempt to stop him. Harry's voice behind the camera, saying,
"I love him too." Pansy looks at him. "He's my friend, and I love him too. And I had to... I was there to see what happened to him, when you weren't. And maybe you won't mean to hurt him, like you didn't the last time—" She gives him a thin, cold smile here. "but sometimes you can hurt people anyway, and if any of those memories come back, and they
"I have two conclusions, but I know it can't be one of them because you wouldn't be hiding a secret girl while you're with my sister." Ron eyes him closely. "So it's Malfoy, isn't it? That's who you've been hanging around during meals?"
Draco watches him, gathering himself up, moving his hand away from his face. He's watched him all his life from the sidelines, all his unbelievable goodness, how much he felt for those he cared about.
It all reached him at a very vague level, but mostly it was slipping off him like water, and he kept trying to repeat it back to her,
The game starts again. Potter flies off to take his position a moment before, talks to Ginevra and kisses her cheek hard. Draco averts his gaze quickly.
"My daddy was talking 'bout it to Auntie Pans." His daddy seems to talk about him a lot, Harry muses. "She said he thinks you look very nice too."
" Potter's voice is thick and breathy in the high wind of the tower, like he has a cold. He laughs, shaky, and more than anything, he just sounds terrified, and this is everything Draco has been terrified of himself, unfolding right before his eyes. "There's this way that you look at me, like you... and I didn't understand it before, but I understand it now...
I really don't know how much longer I can take trying to tell her that you're fine just as you were yesterday, and the day before that,
The third chapter of the story is set during  the chapter Malfoy Manor, where Harry, Ron and Hermione are captured by Snatchers and brought in front of the Malfoys. Narcissa and Lucius use this as an opportunity to manipulate the Snatchers into bringing Draco to them so that he can identify Harry. Draco is awakened by Lucius' tears and is asked to identify Harry. He refuses to give an apparent answer, ensuring more time for all of them. Eventually Harry and his friends escape, having no choice but to leave Draco behind. Narcissa and Lucius are forced to hand Draco back over to His tormentors. Severus visits him once more and, on his plea, gives him the potion again.
Draco had bought the robes for Harry, a deep blue, silken robe with intricate golden patterns woven at the borders, the sleeves. He taught Harry a charm that could style his hair best, bring it under a bit of control, so that it looked deliberate and artful.
Harry tried to thrash him off, gritting out, "If there is one thing I can't fucking stand, it's bigotry—"
"A bit overdressed, aren't you?" Harry gestured vaguely at him. Then again, he supposed Malfoy was always overdressed. He'd hardly ever seen him in anything other than his fancy suits. Even if he wasn't wealthy anymore, he probably still liked feeling that he was.
Ron was the one that came in, brought them lunch. He stood on the side looking uncomfortable for a moment, before placing the plate down on the nightstand. It was light — just sandwiches, his own special recipe. He looked like he wanted to say something, but didn't know what. Harry was thinking if he should sit up, let go of Draco, except that didn't feel right either, and it felt like his only comfort, the only grounding he had.
Harry hunched forward, elbow on his knee, running a hand down his face. He told Draco everything about what had happened, but he didn't really understand, in the end, why he had ended up reacting the way he did, when nothing had happened at all.
It was hard, the first few lessons. Draco's only just begun to learn how to transfigure very small objects, and he's still an amateur at it, but he's managed to gain a mild semblance of control over the subject now. They become rose petals first, then they become chunks of strawberries, and they only become butterflies by nearly the end of the hour, Luna's eyes bright and her smile wide to a crinkle in her eyes, holding one of them on a finger.  Draco waves them all away with a hand, watching them fly off towards the open blue skies. Watching one stray from its path, blur through the air, and make its soft landing on Potter's nose. Potter's startled, slightly cross-eyed blink at it makes Draco snort, smirking at him. Averting his gaze a second later when Potter's responding small smile threads its way into his heart, tightens into a knot.
Harry spent much of that day closed up in his room, faintly listening for the violins playing down in the drawing room. He was searching through a book on Bonds for anything related to his predicament. He found a section of spells, growing so bored he was only paying half of his attention to it. There was one that managed to freeze the flow of magic for a short time, another that reversed it, and another that exchanged the state of magical cores. It was all useless to him. He came out only to make himself a sandwich when he grew hungry.
Harry laughed, which was painful at this point for his muscles. He put up one hand pacifyingly. "Okay, okay. Your secret is safe with me."
Dinner was ready by the next hour and had everybody gathered at the table, Harry having ended up next to Draco, and Andromeda on the other side of him, and Luna on the other side of her.
Narcissa shakes her head, turning her head away to hide her face. "It's nothing." She lets go of one of his hands and wipes her fingers over her cheeks. "Don't worry, darling."
Draco's voice washed over him. He was a silent presence at his feet all throughout, only there with his hands on him, moving down his arm, his wrist. He casted for Harry the spell of the sound of waterfall in his mind, his fear and choking panic falling away bit by bit with the strong rushing of water, the warmth of a hand, the artificial calm of magic between them.
"Draco! What—" Harry draws back, taking a good look at his face, drinking his boyfriend in in his faded muggle jeans and forest-green sweater, the folded collar of his white shirt peeking out. "You're here. What are you doing here?"
Elias came into his shop sometime the first week of January, seeking mastery-level books on Herbology. He had a thing for leather jackets,  and leaning his elbows on the counter. He was waiting for Harry to bring him his requested books, and when Harry, in trying to take out one book out of a shelf, accidentally knocked over several other books all over his toes, Elias ran over quickly to help him with an exclaimed,
. Some sort of change. Like maybe it becomes more unpredictable. More intense. But like I said, it's just something to consider if
Draco blinked, brows twitching further in confusion, chest heaving slightly. It appeared to take him some time to register what was being said.  "I...My chest?"
“But I guess in a way,” Harry says, swallowing. He shrugs. “In a way, Draco needed to be away from me. That’s what he said too. And I’d rather have him with me as he is now than...than how he was before. Because that's when I was only hurting him without knowing. And then I... did hurt him, knowingly. And I don’t know either if I’ll ever be sorry enough.”
There is a lurch in Draco's chest, and he's tearing himself away from Potter, staring at him and feeling strangely betrayed and hurt by the words. "Don't say that to me."
his tactless and untoward behaviours in the past here as well, but that felt like dredging up more than he should at the moment.
They went to one more place the day before they would go back home, and that was in Leith Hill, Surrey. They'd gone to a few places like these, but Draco never seemed to get bored of sitting high upon hills, looking out over the small part of a world flowing through civilisation.
"What are you reading?" Draco asked, having settled next to him on another weekend night, leaning back with his open bottle.
Draco laughs, catches his mouth in a kiss, quieting, stilling in the dance. There's only the low rise of a song into the vast space of the night, then, and the quiet sounds of the movement of their lips, and when it breaks, with their foreheads pressed together.
"Can I still say my speech?" Ron said, when they drew back, not entirely letting go. "I'm still going to say it. I've been practicing for
Harry partially wishes he did, then. "No. Hermione did. She made three of them, just as a sort of experiment. That one's Ron's, actually…" He clears his throat awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck. He feels a bit guilty for stealing it, especially knowing that Ron often uses it to talk to Hermione at night, but he's sure she'll just think Ron lost it and make him another one. "I'd thought… instead of… what we do, we could just… talk from our own rooms? If we have trouble sleeping, I mean. Only if you want to, of course—"
Draco meets his gaze, holding it for a moment. There's a twitch of something in his face and in his fingers, restless and agitated. "It's much too strange."
There was a long pause, in which Harry awkwardly tapped his fingers on the table, and then concluded that this must be the end of their half-coherent conversation. He was about to pick up his spoon, set beside his plate. Draco's notes were stacked together, away near the edge, the table clean.
Harry stared at him. His mouth worked, the truth of the alteration heavy on his tongue. He saw the pallor of Draco's skin, the constant exhaustion in his face, and couldn't bring himself to speak at all.
The conversation dwindles into silence, eventually, but still there's a loose and free feeling to the joints of his body, the flow of his thoughts, like there are still a hundred other things he wants to be saying to him. Like he can walk down these streets and talk to him and be with him forever. Harry doesn't realise he's staring at him, taking him in, until Draco meets his eyes, tossing him a raised eyebrow, a hint of something that is as exasperated as much as amused.
Harry blinks, but settles down. He huffs, shaking his head. "Right." He feels too awkward, trying to argue over something so trivial. He laughs, trying to soothe the uneasiness in his chest and the dull racing of his heart. "Since when did you become so…?"
He and Longbottom don't talk, ever. Both of them stay out of the dorm most of the days and come back only at night, one before the other and always in quiet.
, was the desperate whisper of a thought that came to him, only he didn't know who or what it was addressed to.
"Are you sure?" Harry asked, slowly, throat convulsing. His fingers were still there, resting against the flat, soft belly.
Malfoy dug into his pockets and pulled out five Galleons, putting it down in front of her and taking the red and green Colovaria cap. "Let's go, Potter."
"I thought they cut off most of your wealth," Harry said, staring puzzledly at the building of the fancy restaurant looming over them, the kind where they sold water at the price of gold.
"We ought to teach him these things from the beginning, lest he grows up to be a graceless barbarian, wouldn't you say?" Draco smirked, not looking up. "Not unlike a certain someone amidst us at the moment."
, the way he'd looked almost apprehensively back at him as he got in the car, like somebody just dangling on becoming this person, and coming back years later as him.
Harry pushed down on her shoulder, snorting, "Make it a bit more obvious you're talking about him, why don't you?"
"No buts. It's not your fault and you don't get a say in what people want to do out of love for you. Your life
Malfoy was telling the lady about the reservations he had made. She pointed them over to a table somewhere far in the corner. He thanked her politely, looked at Harry and gestured in the general direction of where their assigned seat was.
"What happened?" Narcissa said. There was something very controlled about the way she sat, moved. She was pouring him tea in another cup. "Last night."
The rest of the day, he drifted through reasons for why it could be, then discussed them with Ron and Hermione at dinner that night—that fancy silk-green envelope still held between two fingers—until he realised that they'd only been humming for the last couple of minutes, throwing in little interjections for responses, no longer saying much back.
The next thing he knew, he was waking up, unable to decipher the amount of time passed. He must have been given something that brought a good part of his awareness back. There was Hermione beside him, Ron at her shoulder, and a Healer, who was introducing herself, relaying to him what had happened.
"What are you—why—" Ron frowned even harder, gesturing confusedly at him. "Shirtless? Why in Malfoy's—"
He doesn't believe this needs to come between their somewhat friendship either, but it seems Draco doesn't agree with him on that. Harry can't deny that he is inexplicably, intensely drawn to the other boy, seemingly without a name nor reason for why he is, but he is. Perhaps he's grown some sort of attachment to him during their time at St. Mungos, or perhaps he's still in some mindset like Ron had said, desperately needing to ensure Draco is doing alright after all that had happened, or perhaps it's because Draco's always been something of an integral part of his life, even if as an enemy, and he'd just like him to be an integral part of his life as a friend now. Draco, however, seems adamant on avoiding him like the plague.
Malfoy's eyes flicked up at him from under the lower of his lashes. They curled, slightly, having left a feather dust of shadows high on his cheeks. Harry glanced away quickly, down at his drink. He wasn't sure if he was imagining the lingering of Malfoy's gaze on him, but he was much too aware of the haze of him in his peripheral vision.
With magic and curses, there was always the possibility of other unforeseen complications, ones that weren't entirely possible to deduce, and might have never shown up in past cases of similar nature, so this was one more thing that they must be fully prepared for.
Draco's eyes were on his face. "I wanted you to be more motivated to…" He paused. His throat shifted, subtle. "to help me."
There was nothing said. Harry never was one with all the right words, never was good with them, and he did not know if this was at all what Draco needed to hear.
"Anyway, we must be leaving," Draco says, checking his silver watch at the same time he squeezes Scorpius' face into his side by the back of his hair. "I have deliveries to make, errands to run, so I can't be standing around here all day having a chat."
the curse, and the violent lurch in his chest that had led his body to react of its own accord, a sense of
"And the one here?" Draco says, circling a finger around a great lightning scar over the shirt of Potter's chest. He saw that in the boys showers, the first day. Everyone did. Potter came back with glamours all over the next day. He's smirking at him with a cocked eyebrow, apparently guessing just that. Draco rolls his eyes, pushing a hand flat all over his face. "Oh, so what!" Potter's laughing, shifting his head back onto the pillow. "It's not like I was the only one. Where did it come from? It looks just like this one." He brushes a thumb over Potter's temple, follows the jagged line where it cuts half-way into his brow.
"Good," Harry says, nodding, throat convulsing. He presses the back of his sleeve to his eyes. "I'm glad that you don't ever have to...sorry. I'm not the one who should..."
The bathroom felt empty as he eyed the shelves, standing under the shower and letting the water run down his hair and shoulders and back. There was just his shaving cream and kit, the same shampoo he'd been buying for years. There was just his toothpaste, his mouthwash and soap. Nothing fancy and expensive.
It seemed that these days, all Harry did was look at him, at breakfast from over the rim of his cup while taking a sip, from under the bow of his head over the plate at dinner, quiet in the doorway sometimes as Draco stared into middle distance, drinking just enough to seem a little more distantly calmer, from the rug of Andromeda's drawing room as Draco watched Teddy, gave him half-smiles that wore at the edges and spoke to him in too low of a voice, brushed a hand over Teddy's curls and seemed lost in thought around him.
"C'mon guys," Hermione said with a hardness in her voice that signaled she was struggling to calm herself down. "That menstrual cramp of a boy isn't worth it."
"I'll be two hundred years old on the spring equinox." Ariel gave him a sparkling grin. "Why? You're only into young girls, professor?"
"Albus, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it for myself," Snape swore stealing surreptitious glances at Ariel's depressed body as she laid stomach first on the floor in front of the fireplace. "But he really seems to adore her."
"I didn't say that." But he has already turned away from her as if trying to avoid an assault. "Tom. Please. Look at me." He wouldn't turn his head. "Look at me!"
"Thank you," Narcissa replied. "We inherited it from my husband's parents. It had been in his family for over fifteen generations."
Stepping back into Diagon Alley, her hair caught the attention of a random asshole who felt entitled to her time.
"It's true. I wasn't going to kill him." He said with a voice strained with shame. He knew what he was admitting.
She punctuated her observation by pressing her foot directly into Ariel's diaphragm, crushing the very limited amount of air Ariel could take in. She giggled deliriously when she noticed Ariel's struggle. The woman might have stomped on her lungs, for fun, had she not noticed the contents of her bag as they were strewn across the ground.
He punctuated his statement by letting go of Draco's chin, leaving behind two red indents from where his thumb and index finger dug into him. He then raised his wand-carrying hand to above his shoulder and flicked it forward.
"Do you Severus—" Attina asked the man in a black suit with the pink rose in his lapel, as the ten of them stood waist-deep in lilac waters.
He looked her over, unconvinced she got away without at least a bruise or a mark. But when Ariel caught his wandering eye, she gave him an unharmed wink.
By the time Draco had finished cleaning the second floor of Spinner's End, his body felt like it was run over by a stampede of unicorns. But even as he hobbled down the flight of steps with his collection of cleaning supplies, Draco kept his aches and pains to himself. Not out of fear of being heard by the Dark Lord, but because he didn't want to miss a word of his conversations with Ariel.
Snape took the crown and studied it. It felt real enough and everything about the crown, from its intricate design to the loud rippling waves captured in the center-most sapphire of the crown, told him it had to belong to mermaid royalty.
"He'll see right through that. Besides, I loathe how much we use her already. Heavens forbid if that deranged man—" His sentence ended in a fury of sputters and dreaded silence. His hopeless silence thickened the air which Dumbledore broke with his light airy voice, "She's doing enough for us. Besides I'm sure Mr Malfoy will make himself known in one way or another. Maybe if I'll luck out and he'll kill me with kindness."
Harry was on the ground, against the wall, feeding carrot sticks to a stinky old goat who wandered the bar freely. Unlike Ron and Hermione, who flirted at each other from a nearby booth, he wasn't drunk. His second drink of the night sat barely touched on the floor next time him. He wouldn't have gotten it had a tipsy Hermione not insisted on buying him one, having observed that he had been "nursing that beer all night".
Snape arched his back and dug his erection into her. She kept hold, her fingers looped around his waistband as her head tilted back as another gasp rushed out of her. The idea of there being a white stain on the front of his pants from her pleasure burned him wildly and he rolled himself on top of her, showered her neck with kisses, her moans filling his ears with ecstasy. He might have burst then and there but he set his mind against it and paused from his kissing to whisper in her ear, "If you can wait my dear until we get to my office, so that I may fuck you properly on a bed, I promise you, Miss. Ariel I will do my absolute best to ravage you thoroughly."
"I am," Narcissa said with small but genuine joy. She went quiet for a second then explained, "Draco wanted me to drop an invitation to you two." She handed the envelope bearing her and Severus' names.
Voldemort took his seat on the cushion beside her. "Fair enough." He flipped to the end of the book, waited for Ariel to give him the cue to start, then, in his best grade school reading-aloud-to-the-class voice, read her his personal favorite childhood story, "the Tale of the Three Brothers".
"No offense taken, mate." Harry agreed, turning his attention back to scratching the area behind Ruth's pointy ears.
His lipless mouth curled wider, revealing two sets of small, sharp teeth. "How's your hand doing, Albus?" He asked with a throaty chuckle. With mock sympathy, he added, "From what I've heard…it's looking awful." He pouted then let out a snake-like laugh as he taunted, "Ah…but I guess that's what you get for taking things that don't belong to you."
Bellatrix hummed patiently while she watched the sand pass through her hourglass. The siren still had ten minutes to lose the bet.
At some point, a tipsy Draco looked up into Snape’s face to discover the man was sobbing quietly with a face that looked like it had lived a thousand years of misery. Heartbroken, Draco got up from his end of the table, walked over and curled his arms around the man’s neck like he used to do when he was a small child. He didn’t say a word as Snape sobbed all his grief into that hug. Even as he realized, with crystal shattering clarity, that he was done with this life. He was done giving loyalty to a heartless wizard. And he resolved, then and there, to never follow another one of Voldemort’s orders for as long as he should live.
"It goes without saying," the Dark Lord began his voice low and threatening as he migrated to the center of the room, "That what I am about to tell you may never, ever, ever leave this room."
Voldemort grinned. "You better hurry up and strike while you can, old man. We both know you're on borrowed time anyway."
"If you two keep making us cry, this lagoon is going to turn into an ocean," said Aquatta wryly as she used a knuckle to dry a tear.
"Yeah," she said with another sad laugh as her eyes teemed with tears. She looked to the side in embarrassment but then saw the flowers and she gave them a closed-lipped smile. "Thanks for the flowers."
"This tiara belongs to Princess Ariel, the seventh daughter of King Triton and Queen Athena. So, don't even think about it stealing this, bumboclaats!"
Voldemort's face twitched into a shadow of a smile. To her immense relief, he got from the floor, stood up, and turned partway towards the door. "Thank you, Narcissa." He turned to leave when he stopped halfway and told her, "Once again, if you tell anybody—"
"It wasn't my soul. It was my voice. And I got it back," she replied sweetly. "But you asked me why I wanted to leave the ocean so bad and I told you a bunch of reasons but the biggest reason was—fish sex is awful. There's no pleasure for the female. It's literally a male fish sperms on some eggs and that's it. No touching, no kissing, no getting your genitals licked until you can't see. And," she thrust her pelvis into his and they both were gasping, hard, their desires aflame. "God, I missed that. I missed getting fucked."
Tom beamed at her but the smile was short-lived as he heard one of the workers from the orphanage scream his name. Tom looked over his shoulder to say goodbye but only caught the sight of Ariel's tail slapping against the water as she vanished with a swan dive.
"And Severus," Voldemort remarked with a coy smile as Snape straightened his back. "Ariel, you are already acquainted with Severus."
"You're welcome," Ariel replied sweetly before she turned her attention to Draco and Narcissa who stepped ahead and gave their bows. "My Lord. Lady Ariel."
"Well, I was telling Narcissa and Bellatrix about my potion recipe that got published and then that lead to me telling them the story about how I broke my friend Jack out of Azkaban last year and these naysayers—" Ariel turned her head at Bellatrix and Narcissa who was secretly holding each other's hand under the table. "Tried saying I was bullshitting about being able to break someone out of Azkaban without setting off the alarms." She turned her head back to Voldemort and said with a scoff, "Like it's that hard to get past a bunch of floating smoke clouds in dishrags, anyway. Pfft."
Ariel followed the creature for what felt like an eternity through the cold, unwelcoming corridors. She had to keep her eyes focused on the back of the dementor's raggedy robes as she felt the dead-eyes of every prisoner they passed follow them and burn against her soaked body. She wasn't afraid of their leers more than she was terrified by their haunted wraith-like faces. None of them even bothered to catcall her. They said nothing, knew nothing, dreamt of nothing but suffering.
This has to be a dream, he told himself later, after they switched to three other positions before ultimately, he came so hard he saw stars and collapsed, a sweaty panting heap of flesh and spent pleasure, beside this beautiful creature. How can this be real? He asked himself as he turned his head and watched Ariel's profile deliver a big dumb smile to the ceiling.
A fresh ray of light crossed over her toes and she lifted her head to find Voldemort had opened a side door. He held it open for her. "C'mon, drunky." He said with good-natured humor. "I want to show you something." He stood beside a grime-covered window. She peered out of it to discover he had opened a door to a backyard where a bunch of white stones stood a waist-height like they were teeth plucked out of the mouths of giants and stabbed into the ground.
"I'll be right back," she vowed as she bent over him to plant a kiss on his forehead. He tried to ask more questions but she cut him off with a soft whisper, "Go back to bed angelfish." The wizard fell back asleep instantly. Ariel smiled at her snoring lover, went to her messenger bag pulled out an empty vial, filled it with sink water then rushed downstairs towards the fireplace.
