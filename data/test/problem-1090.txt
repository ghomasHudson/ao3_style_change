“At school today, Bobby was telling Joey, Darren and I, that all of us our different because we can’t do magic like our parents, even though Mrs. Harris told us that we can’t talk about magic in school where the other kids can hear us. We told him not to but he didn’t listen.”
“You can be a complete prat at times, Potter but I must say, today you’ve shown me that behind all the fumbling, fashion-challenged mess is someone with a brain.”
He doesn’t really know why he’s hiding the fact that Malfoy is neighbour, it’s not like Ron would do anything. But there’s a part of him that wants to keep Malfoy’s existence to himself for now, the same part that wanted to hug Malfoy that night, the same part that wants to learn more about Malfoy - not because of any suspicions about Malfoy’s reappearance but because he’s genuinely interested.
Draco bit down on his bottom lip and glared at Potter, who just sheepishly smiled at him. He sighed and moved back, preferring to have this conversation inside rather than out in the open.
I've never actually had roasted chestnuts but google informed me they taste good. Thank you for reading! ♥
Things got a little heavy but Draco's and Scorpius's story needed to come out bit by bit! Also, please ignore the weather I know it's all over the place. *hides*
Seeing her reminds Harry that he still hasn’t mentioned Malfoy to Ron or Hermione. Something he needs to fix, he knows, but what can he say when he still knows next to nothing.
Harry reaches across the pillows to brush back Draco’s hair, leaning over a slumbering Teddy to give Draco a kiss goodnight.
I spend the night sitting on my hands because the temptation to reach out, to touch and confirm is overwhelming. If he notices, he says nothing.
“It’s Christmas, Draco.” Teddy pouts, no trace of the stubborn seven-year-old who had been ecstatic on picking out his new bed. “Please?”
Potter leans close to him, close enough that Draco can see the scratches on the lenses of his glasses.
, it was a long time ago and he’s not looking for payback, Malfoy continues, “And it wouldn’t hurt for me to know more people outside my family now that we’ve moved back.”
I looked up indoor plants in the UK and the palm showed up so I went with it. Though I do wonder that maybe in the magical world any plant can survive because
). He holds back a satisfied moan as he bites into the cookie, the spice of the ginger mellowed against the sweet coconut flakes. If it wasn’t for the ongoing
The house-elves followed him when he was outside, rushing over each other to help lift the sacks of fertiliser and top grade soil he ordered. They grew quiet anytime he glanced at them, freezing where they stood till he looked away. It was only after the second ripped bag—thanks to their little tug of war over who would carry it—that Draco gave in, he tersely asked Milly to move the fertiliser while Zeb fetched the water.
It felt new, sparkly, the feeling of getting to know someone for the first time because their last time felt like it was a lifetime away. What remained was the comfort of little things, like Harry’s habit of forgetting his tea till it got too cold and then complaining about it, and new surprises, like the fact that Harry preferred the left side of the bed now.
He’s almost asleep when he feels the covers shift and Malfoy’s leg brush against his. He hides his smile in the pillow and drifts off to the sound of Malfoy’s steady breathing.
Harry takes in a deep breath. Nods. The child playing near the trees squeals as light makes snow from the branches fall around him.
“Of course not,” Potter explained with an affronted expression. “I told you I wouldn’t tell anyone about it!”
“-trust me, if it was up to me, I wouldn’t be here  either,” Malfoy goes on, ignoring Harry, “but Luna is the only one in the office  who’s decent to me and she’s actually okay to work with. So when she asked, more like insisted, that I accompany her, I couldn’t really say no.”
“No,” he answers after a while, “I don’t really work, I want to be there for Scorpius as he grows up.”
“Don’t think so much about it, it’s just two friends getting together. Dinner at my place or we can  go some place else, I don’t care. Just say yes.”
With a shy smile, filled with the unrestrained happiness of getting the happy ending he only ever dreamed off, Harry takes Draco’s hand.
He looks up to see Mrs. Malfoy and Draco watching them with similar expressions of fondness, though he has a feeling that Draco’s look is aimed at both Harry and Scorpius.
Draco shakes his head, trying to act nonchalant but his fidgeting fingers show just how nervous he is.
When Harry doesn’t speak up, Draco carries on. “The potion, you know. The contraceptive potion I take daily. You’ve only seen me take it a few hundred times now.”
“Really?” Harry didn’t mean to sound so surprised but the thought of a fourteen year old Malfoy learning how to cook during the summers doesn’t really fit in with the image I had.
He laughs, walking back towards Draco with Scorpius in his arms. “I caught him as he was making a run for it. What did he do this time? Steal the fancy silverware again?”
Draco barely managed to restrain what would have been a very undignified snort but thankfully Potter seemed to have caught the hint. Draco looked on in amusement as the boy in front of him blushed, one hand fiddling with the ruffled ends of the garishly yellow scarf.
Harry closes the scant distance between them, hand reaching up to tangle in Draco’s hair as he brushes their lips together. They kiss slowly, basking in the warm sunlight till Harry gradually pulls away.
“Don’t you have a lovely new bed, young man?” Draco asks, slipping under the covers. He shivers at the warmth, sliding his cold feet across the bed till he hears Harry squawk from the unexpected chill.
She’d sent him off after with a request to read up on the Institute and its programs when he had the chance. While he had nodded in agreement then, Draco soon forgot about it as the N.E.W.T.s crept closer.
They aren’t in a relationship or anything rubbish of that sort. It’s never about love. It’s about need. Need for an outlet, need for relief, need for attention or need for approval; it doesn’t matter.
Draco had found the classroom on accident during one of his nightly walks around the castle, sleep evading him so regularly he’d all but given up on the facade of getting ready for bed.
Draco can feel the wood biting into the skin of his palm, he curls his fingers harder. The pain is all that is centering him right now, without it he feels like he would be swept away by the tide of
Everly laughs. “Well, the point we’re at right now, your research and expertise is exactly what we need.” He gestures for Draco to get onto the lift ahead of him, following behind and dragging the metal gates closed.
"I can't," Draco groans, his words in contrast to how he slots one leg between Harry's. "Pansy wants to look at Mother's china collection for that charity gala she's hosting next month."
Harry frowns, his other hand coming up to cup Draco’s cheek. Draco can see his mouth open, see the concern on his face.
Draco nods, and with Ron’s help, Harry gets him standing. Draco’s leaning mostly on him and Harry wraps an arm around his waist to steady him. Seamus and Hermione walk ahead, clearing a path through the typical Friday night pub crowd. Ron and Luna bring up the rear, carrying everyone’s bags and coats.
Malfoy laughs. “It’s okay to be shocked, Potter,” he teases, his eyes twinkling as Harry blushes, “I know I was. To go from spending my life with no cares or concerns in the world, to suddenly becoming responsible for a little life.”
He think of all people Draco slept with, all those who saw him as nothing more than a convenient lay, too drunk to even appreciate the person underneath. He doesn’t want to be like them, he wants to make Draco feel appreciated, show him he’s worth so much more.
It's only once he's settled on the bed in front of Harry, cross-legged in his smart grey trousers and that green shirt that he swears he hates but wears at least once a week, that Harry tries again.
He’s lost in thoughts of tucking his head into the crook of Malfoy’s neck, if the skin would be warm and smell of vanilla that he generally catches a whiff  of would be stronger there, when he hears a whimper. Malfoy is frowning in his sleep, his fingers twitching and without thinking Harry moves closer. He places one hand on Malfoy’s cheek, rubbing his thumb over the bruised skin under his eyes while he holds onto Malfoy’s hand with the other.
Maybe, Draco hoped, stepping closer and wrapping an arm around Potter’s neck. Maybe this Christmas could be a little like those.
The kiss starts off chastely, Draco’s lips are a warm relief from the bitter wind and Harry presses in closer, chasing the hint of sweetness from the candy cane Draco had indulged in. He wants
“You’re delusional,” Draco mutters, giving the witch a pointed look as she leans slightly towards them to hear better.
“It’s always something at work, Harry. Either you have to study or you need to have drinks with the Senior Aurors. There’s just always something else going on, but
Harry shakes his head. “It’s the middle of the night, Malfoy. Relax. Sleep for a few more hours and leave in the morning. Or leave if you want to but I’m going to back to bed.”
“Potter,” Draco sighed. He pinched the bridge of his nose, giving himself time to calm down before making a proposal he felt he might regret but seemed worth it.
“I haven’t seen you out in the mornings recently,” Draco casually stated, settling down next to the welcome heat of the flame. He tried not to visibly react to Potter sitting down as well. At least he was across from him.
As they inched closer to November, Draco found himself sneakily applying Warming Charms along the path Potter usually ran. He was sure Potter was more than capable of doing such basic wandwork, but reminding him would involve talking to him, and Draco was trying to avoid that as much as possible.
Besides his packages the only post he got was from his mother, whose letters arrived, without fail, every Tuesday and Saturday. Their own little tradition since his first year at Hogwarts. This was why he was pleasantly surprised the morning he awoke to find an unfamiliar owl waiting for him next to his bedroom window. Rubbing sleep from his eyes, he stumbled over, taking the letter and dropping a few treats for the owl.
“Scorpius is in a mood today,” Harry remarks softly as he helps Draco wash the dishes. The boy had been sullen all evening and refused to say a single word throughout the meal, ignoring all questions till Draco had finally snapped and sent him to his room till he learnt how to talk respectfully.
“He finds it funny when the blocks fall on me,” Draco complains with a smile, laughing when Harry presses kisses against his neck.
Draco smiles. “I know, but we were too young and too lost to be for each other what we needed to be. You deserved more than being my excuse for not trying hard enough for myself, for the things I wanted to do.”
“. . . and then she started complaining about how we don’t have enough time for each other these days.”
“The thing is.” Draco taps his fingers on the carpet, a silly melody he’d heard on the wireless the day before. “I quite liked the thrill of it, if I’m being honest.”
(and at least he hadn’t blasted a biscuit tin in annoyance. He was surprised Malfoy hadn’t been put into detention.)
He looks up to see Harry standing at the top of the stairs. He’s sure he doesn’t look half as bad as Harry looks. His glasses are lopsided, he has flour on his face, and his hair looks even more unmanageable than usual. But it’s the defeated slump of his shoulders that makes Draco’s chest ache.
“I haven’t laughed this much in ages,” Malfoy whispers next to him. Harry leans up on an elbow and takes in Malfoy’s flushed cheeks and wide smile.
He’d spend his days drifting from room to room, finding himself growing uneasy staying within a space for too long. He knew it was probably in his head, but the very air in the Manor seemed to vibrate with hidden malevolence. Like the acts it had witnessed over the past few years had seeped into the very core of its magic.
He looks so unhappy, the thought of making little Teddy wait for him making him look more anxious than Draco has ever seen him.
Draco is halfway through the prep for a fairly simple stew, frowning at the directions on the cookbook propped open against the sugar jar. There are knives chopping the vegetables, while a rag darts around sweeping up every few minutes.
“Fuck buddy then,” Blaise corrects himself, waving his hand in a manner indicating it doesn’t really matter much. The elderly witch next to them in the lift shoots them a pointed glare. “Either way, as you keep deluding yourself into believing that by the way, he would still make sure the higher ups knew how displeased he was.”
“Harry!” Hermione greets him, wrapping in a hug as soon as he opens the door. “What took you so long, we’ve been -
Harry looks older, smarter. His hair seems to have finally grown into some semblance of style, making him look more put together than the Harry he remembers. He looks sturdier too, his shoulders filling in the robes in a way they didn’t before.
“It’s a contraceptive potion?” Harry questions, expression stunned as he drags a hand through his hair and slumps over his chair.
Harry turns a little, aware of everyone around the table trying not to listen in. Draco looks tired, dark circles stark against his pale complexion, his cheekbones more pronounced as a result of all the missed meals. Harry knows he can’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do but he decides then and there to be more forceful when Draco wants to skip a meal.
Draco tries to get a word in to defend himself but Blaise doesn’t let him, clearly enjoying the chance to show Draco how wrong he is. The witch isn’t even hiding her curiosity now, she’s openly listening in, nodding along to what Blaise is saying.
“Absolutely not,” Draco cuts her off with a chuckle, leading her towards the sofa. “He’s not a bother at all, and I know Harry’s been missing him something fierce.”
It takes them 2 days of research to realise that the cursed fire that is devouring everything is created by the Fiendfyre that was started five years ago.
He has a child in his arms, a toddler with hair just like Malfoy’s, who is leaning sleeping against the man carrying him, a thumb in his mouth. They head out of the room as Harry watches.
So the week was his job, his sole focus and attention on ensuring that he did his work to the best of his capabilities. The Malfoy name had been greatly tarnished after the end of the war, and if he had to keep aside his personal life for most of the week to build a solid reputation as a hardworking man, then so be it.
Standing by the bed he pokes that smaller lump once, biting back his laughter at the way it giggles, before he peels the covers back. Teddy lets out an excited shriek, curling back into Harry as Draco jumps onto the bed.
It’s as he’s just at the cusp, rocking between a state of sleep and consciousness, he feels Harry fidget softly behind him.
“Congratulations,” he said, leaning towards Harry to press a soft kiss against his cheek and carefully laying the wrinkled letter down on his lap.
as uncomfortable as he feels. Maybe even more. He’s glad that Ron decided to skip tonight in  favour of catching up on sleep.
“Your house is lovely,” Draco compliments, handing over his coat with a thanks. He’s not just saying it to be polite; her house truly is beautiful. With dark woods and deep jewel tones, it’s a cosy yet chic space, the candles and muted lamps giving everything a soft glow.
As the Patronus fades away, Harry rushes to the door, only to double back when he realises he’s shirtless.
This time Harry is the one who is late, Hermione waiting for him patiently at the street corner. It’s a lovely winter day, snow covering the streets and trees. Big Ben frames the sky across from the them as they start walking towards the little building tucked between two pubs, no sign on the red door they walk through.
Draco was confused, and it was apparently visible on his face since Potter felt the need to continue.
He sways them to an imaginary beat, a soft shuffle that takes them around the room. It’s a declaration and a promise all in one.
Prompt for the week: "It is our choices that show us who we truly are, far more than our abilities."
Draco isn’t sure if he responds, isn’t sure of when he moves but within seconds he’s all the way across the kitchen. Harry holds a cup of tea out to him, the slight hint of honey wafting from the steam tells Draco it’s just the way he likes it. This small act of familiarity pushes his already sensitive emotions into overdrive, making him blink furiously as he feels his eyes water.
We've reached the halfway point! Yay! Thank you to everyone who has been keeping up with the story - all your comments and kudos make me smile! Thank you. ♥
In hindsight, he should have known. There was only one person at Hogwarts who was always surprising him. Yet he couldn’t help but be startled when he finally made it close enough to see who was braving the chilly morning air to get in some exercise.
That has been their go-to since the day over a year-and-a-half ago when Teddy had turned to them and asked, with all the seriousness of a five-year-old, if they were
Of course, that was before he learnt that firstly, they couldn’t choose their own partner so there went down the drain all the plans of camping with Ron, and secondly, because he just can’t catch a break, the higher powers decided that he and Malfoy would make a really good team.
“He has you wrapped around his finger,” Draco comments with a smirk, watching his son run off towards the living room, Loki at his heels.
“I’m fine,” Harry reassures him, pressing a kiss  on his brow. Draco says nothing but standing as close as they are, Harry can feel his body relax, curl a little more into his.
My last thought before losing consciousness is looking up at Harry Potter’s worried face and wondering how I can thank him for freeing me.
As they’re waiting for their drinks, Malfoy speaks up. He’s looking straight at Harry when he says, “I didn’t need your help.”
“No,” Harry answers, frowning as he tries to remember Malfoy’s trial. He had attended the first day to give his testimony but that’s it, there had been a lot going on  then for him to pay attention to the outcome.
Draco spends the next hour mingling. He meets Emma’s wife, Tara, a sociable witch who works in the Minister’s office. Bronan is there as well with his wife, a calm primary school teacher who complements his exuberance wonderfully.
Draco strides across the kitchen to gently take the package from the owl’s leg. Scorpius is jumping up and down next to him, obviously excited to see the owl.
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispers, his voice gravelly and deep like it always got first thing in the morning. “He’s been asking to see you since last night.”
Love tastes like the smell of roses in full bloom in the Manor gardens, like the sound of Mother’s laughter, like the first snowflake.
Harry waits as Draco peeks into the box, going through some of the photos with gentle care with which he handles his camera
“Those are just leftover lavender I’m harvesting for mother,” Draco explains, pausing to offer Teddy a “Good job. Try the next one”.
Now technically, Draco has always known that, but it’s one thing to know about it and another to experience it. They are at the Burrow, and Draco doesn’t even make a single joke about the name, the lopsided, homely house decorated by all manners of fairy lights, making it a big, flashing structure.
Harry nods, aware that Malfoy must be feeling vulnerable with all the rehashing of his past he just did. Harry feels grateful, humbled that Draco trusts him enough to let him in.
Draco relaxes into the solid weight behind his back, Harry’s arms coming up to wrap around his waist, anchoring him amidst all the chaos.
“Potter,” the Director chides, turning to Draco with an apologetic expression. “This is Mr Potter, our Deputy Director and Expert on Spell Tracking.”
“Worse!” Harry gasps, peering down his nose at Scorpius, who is busy trying to hide himself under Harry’s coat.
One of the many things that had caught his attention when Draco had first been introduced to their little pub nights about three years ago, was the little camera he carried with him everywhere. Harry had been fascinated, the sight of Draco Malfoy with his little magical camera that shot out tiny pictures almost like Polaroids. Though, of course, that example had been lost on the other boy, Harry had always been curious where all the photos had gone. Even now, Draco would have his trusty camera with him for their weekly dinners and almost all important events. It is part of their routine now, little traditions formed amongst their group of friends. Ron brought the FireWhiskey (often the most adventurous blend he could find), Neville would bring along Mrs. Longbottoms's famous cheesecake and Draco
Harry takes in the man in front of him. His cool gaze, the messy fringe so in contrast to his proper clothes and the graceful manner in which he handles his glass. The slight hint of nervousness as he distractedly nods along to whatever Neville is saying, never looking away from Harry.
Draco sighs. "Maybe a little," he answers, something in Harry's expression makes him hastily add on, "just a little though. I meant to put it back in it's hiding place but I was in such a rush that it must have slipped my mind."
As a result, when Harry asked if Draco would like to accompany him and his friends to Hogsmeade for lunch, he refused. “It would be the perfect chance to finally tell them about us,” Harry would reason with a stubborn Draco, who remained unconvinced.
“You did it!” Harry cheers, rushing over to where Draco stands. “Oh my God, Draco, you’re brilliant!”
It was the third time Harry had promised he would be there only to get delayed or held up somewhere. Draco had been okay with it so far, had tried to be patient and understanding. But not anymore because this time Harry had promised. He had sworn up and down he would be there.
At Harry’s nod he smiles, bouncing excitedly. “We live there,” he points towards his house, “that means we are, umm, wait a second.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Knowing her, it’s probably something gauche and immature. She thinks it’s funny.”
Even as he listens to Bronan share stories of old cases, Draco’s gaze keeps drifting to the door. Each time he catches himself doing it, he frowns, making himself pay attention to the conversation and yet, a few minutes later, he’s doing it again.
Ron waits patiently as Hermione explains her order to the barista, his wife’s precise instructions on the amount of cream and sugar to be added making him smile fondly. He had initially been extremely reluctant to visit a Muggle establishment that “makes the best coffee ever, Ron!”
“Hmm, if you don’t take a bath, you’ll end up stinky,” Harry explains, frowning as he thinks about it.
Trying to lighten the mood, he jokes, “You’ll be so confused with all the free time you’ll have when Scorpius heads off to Hogwarts. Molly once told me that she when Ginny had also left she would find herself creating mess just to have something to clean up.”
It’s in the arboretum that he gets to see more of Teddy’s inquisitive side. They usually just spend time in the same parlour, Draco and Harry either working or chatting softly on the couch as they keep an eye on Teddy. One Sunday, however, Draco is busy monitoring the valerian root when they drop by. Harry seems apologetic, offering to come back another time, when Draco spots the curiosity in Teddy’s eyes.
Harry shakes his head. “That was our sixth date, on our fourth I took you to the dinner party at the Minister’s house.”
He throws his head back and moves to the music, waiting for Harry to get to him. The beat is louder and faster now; sweeping him away as he lets his body move to it. It’s hot, hot enough that Draco’s gasping for breath within minutes and without thinking he raises the vodka bottle and overturns it on his head. The chilled alcohol slides down his neck, making him shiver in relief. He knows the people around him are probably getting a good show, with his shirt now soaked and sticking to his chest.
“Scorpius Malfoy-Potter, you are the most special little boy in the entire world. Magic doesn’t make you special, your heart does and you have one of the kindest hearts ever. Your dad and I love you because you are perfect, just the way you are.”
“Yes.” Draco is perplexed by Harry’s reaction. He realises they’re still standing by the counter, the cup of tea in Harry’s hand no longer steaming. He carefully places the cup on the counter before dragging Harry to the table. He’s not sure how to feel at the moment, he expected Harry to be either joyful like him or maybe, there was always a chance he would have a
Apparently Scorpius is a fan of Muggle comics. He can’t really read them yet but he’s fascinated by the art.
Harry shrugs, fidgeting with the wrapping on his Chocolate Frog card. Dumbledore waves cheerily at him and Harry swallows the sudden lump in his throat. “Pity those who live without love,” that’s what the Prof. had said once and Harry doesn’t think he’s ever truly understood the meaning of those words till now.
"When did you get back?" Draco asks distractedly, too busy making sure the suit is hanging up properly. "I'm sorry, I knew I said I would be home but I just -"
“It was hidden right at the back, thought we could use some before we head out in search of everyone else.”
“I can see that.” Malfoy’s lips twitch, his eyes wide as he takes in the mess in the kitchen. The puppy is almost purring in his lap as Malfoy scritches under his neck, making his tiny body wiggle.
He’s only human and the lure of spending more time against Malfoy underneath a pile of blankets is just too hard to resist.
Before he knew it the room became a secondary dorm room of sorts. He was finding himself spending more time here, getting comfortable on the window ledge, than in the actual room assigned to him. The only eighth-year Slytherin to come back, he had all the space to himself but being alone amongst the empty beds was slightly disconcerting. It was also the reason why he could never get comfortable enough to fall asleep.
“Mr Malfoy,” the dark-haired man greets, shaking Draco’s hand enthusiastically. “I’m Christopher Everly, with the Office of Forensics. We’re so glad you could make it at such short notice.”
“Blaise!” he bites out, batting away Blaise’s offered hand as he tries to climb to his feet, “How many fucking times have we been over this?”
He feels lost, his voice too quiet to be heard over the din around him, people shouting cheerfully, children shrieking as they play some game or another. All his fears about Scorpius feeling overwhelmed were unfounded, his son is having the time of his life, never having been so many kids before.
He steps onto the spell warmed floor and curls his toes with a hum of satisfaction, stretching his arms to shake off the last dregs of sleep. It’s still fairly early in the morning, the sun rays just starting to inch along the floorboards, glinting off the wall of frames across the windows, but 7am rounds are an integral part of his job description as a Healer.
They share a long heated look, forgoing the need for words and Draco feels light headed; he takes another long drink, without breaking eye contact. He’s breathing hard, the club feeling hot suddenly. As green eyes stay trained on him, Draco reaches up to undo his tie, his long fingers tugging at the material till the tie hangs loose around his neck. Across the room he starts walking towards Draco, already pulling off his coat and revealing that slim waist and broad shoulders that Draco knows he’s left marks on.
Scorpius makes no move to indicate he’s heard Harry, but that doesn’t stop Harry from getting comfortable on the bed.
He gestures for her to lead the way and follows behind, taking in the warm decorations of the room. The tree stands in the corner, covered in Christmas baubles of different colours - red, green, gold and silver, fairy lights, tinsel and glitter. It’s wonderful, a far cry from the perfectly decorated trees at Hogwarts. The handiwork is sloppy in certain places, like the majority of glitter being sprinkled on the floor around the tree, most of the Christmas baubles are placed on the lower branches, the perfect height for a little child to reach up on his toes.
Draco takes in a deep breath once Harry leaves and decides to clear out the rest of his things later.
the same,” Draco nodded, “Sprout thinks we can supplement the daily sun time with moonlight along with a Growing Charm to boost their growth rate from three months down to six weeks.”
“I am. Kingsley had to make a request to the Wizengamot to make them allow me to enter the Auror Training. They were quite against it, to be honest and I don’t blame them, but Kingsley was adamant and he made them give me a chance.”
“Malfoy,” Harry calls out in exasperation at the sight of the man in question huddled into his robes, his feeble warming charm providing no relief. Malfoy’s lips have a distinct blue tinge to them and that’s what makes Harry decide that enough is enough. Paying no heed to the weak curses being hurled his way he grabs hold of Malfoy’s arm and pulls him in, shutting and warding the door behind them.
Harry nods. “That sounds fun. I’ll do it too.” Before Malfoy can interrupt he flags down the bartender and asks for his suggestions.
By the time the sun starts to set, he already has a stretch of land near the eastern wall cleared out for his use, the conditions perfect for him to run his experiments.
“Professor Sprout wrote to me a few days ago,” Draco said, looking straight at Harry. “She recommended me for a Fellowship at the Institute of Herbology in France.”
Harry doesn’t know who leans first and as he bites down on Malfoy’s lower lip, he realises  that he doesn’t care.
“Okay, so he’ll stay at home and basically have no life, if it’s up to you, neither of which has anything to do with why you’re sulking.”
It’s hard to be grateful when the terms of my probation are read out to me; sweeping floors was never on my list of aspirations.
, he knows that it’s important they work together because he can’t take care of the curse at Hogwarts alone but there’s just something so satisfying about needling Malfoy.
Draco shakes his head and takes a long swig from the vodka bottle, enjoying the burn of the alcohol down his throat. He licks his lip, catching a stray drop of vodka. He looks up to see at least three people staring at his lips. He smirks and bites his lips, relishing the undisguised looks of want aimed at him. He has no intention of pulling anyone tonight, contrary to what Blaise and Pansy think, Draco is an idiot but he knows when he’s being a fool and the only person he wants to spend the night with is the one he woke up with this morning.
Within a month, they had a routine down. Potter would show up some time after dinner, homework in hand. They would work in comfortable silence for a few hours, a soulful ballad streaming from the wireless and the crackling of the flames, a nifty addition by Granger, the only backdrop.
I don’t let my eyes stray from its form as the searing heat burns through my skin till the mark is imprinted on my bone.
no idea how Harry will react, it’s overshadowed by sheer joy. He feels almost giddy with exaltation.
“You know,” Hermione says, finally done with giving her order, “we are actually quite near Harry’s house.”
It's a shifting thing, this comfortable warmth that he can't imagine not being there, growing from an inferno sometimes to a crackling ember other times. It's always there. He can feel it rumbling now, growing in intensity as he takes in this Draco backlit by the sun, the tips of hair stained gold. The bright light only serves to highlight the curves Draco hides behind layered clothes, the warmth in Harry's chest blazing at the thought of being the only one to see Draco like this. Without any layers at all.
It was as Draco was about to turn in for the night, the lights in the Manor dimmed, that he heard the downstairs Floo chime. He was sorely tempted to just turn the lights off and go to bed. The anger that simmered under his skin was dangerously close to boiling over, and he wasn’t sure how or when it would explode.
Even though it's only been a few minutes since he met Malfoy, talked to him face to face, Harry feels wrung out, his head spinning. It reminds him of the trip to the Ministry through the pipes, the spinning ride that left you dizzy.
I feel like I don't say it enough but genuinely, thank you so much to everyone who has been reading and commenting!
Maybe if they had been paying more attention to their path and less on bickering they wouldn’t have lost the map. Maybe if they had spent more time trying to find the map than blaming each other they would have been able to reach the campsite before the storm hit.
“Yes,” Malfoy says, his voice faint as he steps into the kitchen with the empty plates, Harry follows behind him with the remaining dishes. He leans against the counter as Malfoy continues, “I’ve enjoyed cooking since I was a child, I would beg my mother to let the house elves teach me how to cook.”
The other rolled his eyes, drawing his wand in a swift move and using it to light a little fire in it.
“Did you hear back from them, yet?” Harry asks, topping Draco’s glass of wine before pouring more for himself.
By the time he reaches the pub, pushing through the crowd around the door, he’s almost got his emotions under control. He knows Draco will already be panicking enough for both of them, he needs to be the calm one today.
Harry waits patiently as Draco sees them out, he’s sure his face is still red thanks to Mrs. Malfoy’s passing remark, “I can keep him tomorrow night too, Mr. Potter.” He politely declines Draco’s offer of tea, too nervous to actually drink anything. He’s not sure how Draco is going to react to the fact that Harry’s been out and about, looking for ways to help Scorpius.
“I’ll think about it. I don’t need to decide right now, I guess,” Harry mused, moving back to sorting through the rest of the pile.
By the time they reached the classroom, Draco had broken into a sweat, growing nervous with Potter’s continued silence. He’d resorted to keeping up a running commentary as they walked, talking about anything he could think of. The house-elves in the kitchens and how they’d finally stopped trying to stuff extra pastries in his robes, the potions essay he’d been struggling with, and even the story of how he got his first broom. Though, with the last one, he gave up halfway through because thinking of his family wasn’t something he actively did these days.
As luck would have it, not only did Prof. McGonagall view his temporary descent to teenage sullenness  but she also didn’t get a chance to glimpse the mature and calm adult he has definitely transitioned into. Which had been the image he had been going for.
“This is David Bronan, he’s the Field Agent assigned to the case as well as our liaison with the Auror Office.”
Occasionally he would find himself wandering down to the Lake in the early morning, the sight of Potter exercising in the frigid air invoking an odd sense of sympathy in Draco. He was there every morning, wrapped up in layers and running, no matter how low the temperatures dropped, and that made Draco want to do
“To Draco,” Harry raises his glass, his eyes twinkling as he watches Draco flush in surprise, “for being the

Sprout had been ecstatic at his acceptance, she had raved about the program and their areas of research for hours over their Floo call.
“Oh,” he exclaimed, recognising Professor Sprout’s handwriting on the front of the letter. He eagerly tore it open, getting comfortable on his bed to carefully read through the surprisingly long letter.
Milly and Zeb are busy collecting all the draped sheets. Draco helps by using his wand to arrange and move around the furniture till he’s satisfied. He’s not sure how long he’s here for, but he refuses to live just as he did the last time he was home.
As they Disapparate out of the club, leaving a crowd of turned on people behind them, Blaise smirks.
Harry has been finding himself spending time with this little family almost everyday, mostly due to Scorpius’s insistence on meeting Loki everyday so that he doesn’t forget him.
I don’t want to move, I want to fall down over him and cover his body, make sure we’re connected from head to toe.
“Ah.” Draco grimaced. He could empathise with Potter, as weird as that felt. As he grappled with the decision to offer his space to Potter for one night, the decision was all but made for him when Potter stumbled again. Draco was almost carrying his entire weight now, and seeing Potter in this state, the same Potter who’d stood strong and confident at his family’s hearing to speak for him and his mother, was jarring.
“Those six months in Azkaban were a nightmare, even though the Dementors were long gone, in a place so steeped in darkness the imprint remains. It was only thoughts of getting out in six months, unlike some people who had sentenced for life, that helped me through that period.”
how serious the little boy was about this. “Draco, you also scold Harry like Bill’s dad Jin scolds his other dad.” Teddy had frowned, arms crossed across his little chest.
“Hi,” he says softly, looking over Draco. He’s slumped in the chair, his hair messy and cheeks flushed. He has one hand on his stomach, stroking over his shirt; Harry smiles when Draco looks at him, his eyes bright as he breathes a sigh of relief.
“Sorry,” Harry apologises, trying to keep the boy from falling. “He has a fascination with hair these days. You should see him around Hermione.”
He looks up to see Draco beckon him closer and he smiles, carrying in the tray of hot chocolate to cheers and laughter.
Then, a year after they first spent the night together, Draco storms into the pub. Harry’s been waiting for him, drink at the ready, knowing just how difficult the busy week has been for his boyfriend.
Potter waited, looking at him expectantly. Draco felt like he knew, without a doubt, that if he said no, Potter would leave and he’d still be safe in this space. And that was answer enough for him.
, I should say, decorating the tree was something father, mother and I did together and now, without him, it feels incomplete. For now, just for this, mother and I more comfortable being apart.”
Harry nods. “All done, it took surprisingly less time than I thought it would. Though that might be because I bought the house mostly furnished.”
“Mr Potter was the one to suggest we send you an owl,” Emma offers. “I was doubtful if you would reply but he said there’s no harm in trying.”
Malfoy shakes his head, messy blond hair getting ruffled. Harry wants to brush it back, he wonders if it feels as soft as it looks. Taking a sip of his refilled drink, courtesy of Ron who is dragging Hermione onto the makeshift dance floor, Harry ignores the urge to lean closer to Malfoy.
The prompt was "Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it." — Albus Dumbledore
He’s debating tearing the maze down while he’s here—he always hated the blasted thing since he got lost in it when he was six—when he comes across a small plot of land that has no label but for his great-great-grandmother’s name, Celestina Malfoy.
“I’d like to make a toast,” Harry proposes as he rises to face the table. All five occupants turn towards him, regarding him with varying expressions.
“You forgot to take the potion one day?” Harry asks, his eyes bright, the deep green almost pulling Draco under. He doesn’t look as shell shocked now, making Draco breathe easier.
“That was horrible,” Draco cackles, finally giving in and rounding the table so that he straddle Harry’s lap.
He waits as Mrs. Malfoy goes through the paper, her brow creased as she reads through the list of schools. He’s nervous as he fixes her piercing gaze on him, her eyes filled with emotion.
What he needs is to find a way to settle in, something to help him feel like this home, like he’s not so alone.
of any reaction. Throughout Hermione’s interrogation, he had remained silent, not demanding answers or insulting Draco.
Draco had absolutely no intention of mentioning his room or the fact that he had been unintentionally spying on Potter. He opted for the safer, “I was out for a walk.”
"No, I mean," Harry stammers, "I have a ring!" He pulls the box out from his pocket, the other arm holding tighter onto Draco lest he tries to get away.
There's only a handful of photos with Draco in them, the man in question hardly ever trusting anyone else with his prized possession. Harry picks one with just Draco in it, his profile backlit by the sun, giving him an ethereal edge as he quirks his lips in a bashful smile. Harry stares at the photo, enamored.
He misses the look shared between Ron and Hermione as he makes for the door. Malfoy is waiting for him outside, leaning against the wall opposite the pub entrance. He looks nervous, scuffing his boot against the ground as he refuses to make eye contact. Harry’s chest clenches, an ache building as he worries about what Malfoy might say.
“I’ll be back soon, okay?” Harry says, almost as if he’s reassuring both Draco and Teddy, and then he’s gone.
“Shh,” Harry assures him, moving closer till he can pull Malfoy against his chest. “I’m here, go to sleep.”
“And I know you’ll still be here even after four hours. I have to be up early, the Minister leaves for Ukraine tomorrow and I need to brief him before he leaves.”
Draco knows I like to stare at him at nights when I can’t sleep, I like to re-assure myself of his presence. But there’s something different tonight.
It’s as he’s watching Draco cutting up the sandwiches for Scorpius that Harry finds himself asking, something he’s been wondering about for a while, “Do you work at the Ministry?”
“I think,” Harry says, tucking a little foot inside the light up shoes and lacing them up, “that it might take some time, today is the first day after all and everyone there will be missing their parents, but after that, I’m sure you’ll be able to make friends.”
“Why are you here?” he asks, a trying edge to his tone, as he uprights his chair with a flick of his wand.
The inside is alive and bursting with energy. Endless varieties of trees surround him, the leaves healthy and bright despite not having been tended to in decades. He can spot Bowtruckles sprinting along the nearest tree, hear the faint trill of birds in the distance.
Or maybe  he will only wait for the storm to die as Malfoy will surely freeze out in the cold. He would be okay with waiting it out till Malfoy decides to come inside but he knows they lose points if only one team member gets back. So he wraps himself up in the afghan from the sofa and steps outside, grunting as the cold wind whips around him, making him shiver.
Everly leads the way, dodging overflowing carts filled with scrolls of varying sizes being slowly pulled by Ministry elves. There are memos zooming above them, a constant traffic of paper that swoops along the roof, veering and dodging collisions with ease.
“To a night of mind blowing sex,” Pansy toasts before downing her shot. “All right, gents, I’m off.”
The highlight of Draco’s afternoon had been Teddy’s fascination with the house-elves. He had followed them around, asking all sorts of questions. The panicked expression on their faces as they tried to keep him entertained while also being over cautious whenever he wobbled or walked too close to a sharp corner was well worth the visit.
But in this case he would have preferred to be informed that his partner on the case was going to be the acclaimed curse breaker, and git extraordinaire, Draco Malfoy. At least then he wouldn’t have cursed and thrown a tantrum in the Head Mistress’s office.
He had always been pretty ambivalent towards Herbology. The thought of mucking about in dirt wasn’t really appealing, but he could appreciate the effects growing patterns had on herb potency in potion making. Being short of a N.E.W.T. subject, Draco figured Herbology would be an easier pick than History of Magic at least.
Blaise laughs, bright and loud. “Oh, Draco. You’re almost living with him; I doubt you even remember the last time you went home. Not to mention, you’re having weekly Sunday brunches with his family and I have it on good account that Narcissa approves of him.”
Before they can start bickering, Draco speaks up, “Let’s go with the dragon story for today? Daddy’s tired and the merpeople story is very long.”
The witch hadn’t reacted at all to hearing his name. In stark contrast to his last visit to the Ministry, though that had happened over four years ago. His hearing and all the required visits to the Ministry feel like they happened in another lifetime.
“My father's funeral was the day after the trials. Taking yours and all other testimonies and evidence in consideration, I was lucky enough to get a relatively short sentence. Only six months in Azkaban and then I was a free man.”
Harry chuckles and jumps to the side, narrowly missing Draco’s elbow. “I’ll hex your socks, don’t think I won’t,” Draco grumbles, walking to the stairway.
yet fitting oak table. The champagne flutes reflect the light from the chandelier, the strings of fairy lights peeking out from between the bowls and silverware lending the table a muted glow. Seated at the centre table, Draco watches as Pansy flirts with an unassuming Neville, his hard-earned confidence a lure she couldn’t resist. Weasley and Hermione are seated at the end, Harry across from them, his right arm comfortably placed around the back of Draco’s chair. Draco’s attention is pulled by the sound of a chair scraping as it slides back, turning in confusion to face Harry.
So he started visiting him, often doing nothing more than strolling along the shoreline, shivering as the cooler air from over the water blew over. Most days, Potter ignored him, getting there long before Draco did and continuing to jog long after Draco left. Some days he felt like he should speak up, say something to get Potter to stop for a bit, catch his breath maybe. But every time he tried the words would get lost under years of
I turn to my side to face him and focus all my attention on his breaths, the steady in and out of air that makes his rib cage expand and contract. He’s on his stomach, facing away from me, and I can almost count the knobs of his spine as he breathes. But as the lingering hold of terror fades away, I can feel another emotion creeping up my spine.
“Malfoy,” Potter calls and that’s all the warning Draco gets before he’s pushed up against the wall of the alley with a very sober Potter looking at him with that familiar steely determination in his eyes. “Let’s go on an adventure.”
as awkward boys trying to act like men, they forgo the punches and head straight for each other’s clothes.
Draco feels his breath catch, the voice so inherently familiar yet feeling different, the tone deeper than he remembered.
With a satisfying swoop he signs his name at the bottom and drops the quill.  Massaging the ache in his wrist he leans  back in a stretch that makes his chair squeak. Managing to get the scroll rolled and sent off with the nearest Ministry owl in a matter of minutes he quickly grabs his things, cursing when he tips over the now-dry plant he'd bought on a whim to brighten up the space. With only five minutes to spare he rushes to the lifts, sending a silent prayer to whoever is listening when he’s able to get onto the first one that stops on his level.
“I mean no, I don’t want to travel all the way to Paris for some fancy dress robes that we’ll end up wearing only once.”
“Besides,” Blaise says, nudging Draco with his shoulder as they wait in the lift and Draco takes the time to check his reflection in the mirror, “if the Ministry would do anything to you they would have to answer to your boyfriend.”
“His mother was one,” Harry says softly, lightly brushing back the child’s hair. He no longer seems upset, once again looking around them, eyes filled with curiosity. “Andromeda mentioned Tonks’s abilities also manifested this early.”
Harry turns to find a wizard walking towards them. With neatly trimmed brown hair and a bright smile, he’s certainly attractive. He also looks
She leaves soon after, not wanting to be late for her dinner plans. After checking in on Teddy, who is busy playing with his collapsible replica of Hogwarts (
“Well, if you must know,” Malfoy starts and clears his throat. Harry thinks he actually looks adorable with the flush staining his cheeks. A second later he thinks that maybe the wine had gone bad because there’s no other reason
“But I don’t think teaching was ever the path for me,” he continues on. “I’m not sure I have the patience to deal with all the questions and paperwork.”
“It’s from Pansy,” Draco explains, opening the package to reveal a box of Chocolate Frogs, that Draco hands to Scorpius with a stern reminder that he can only have one now, and a card.
All of a sudden the fight seems to leave Scorpius and he sags against Harry, curling up under his arm like he did when he was three.
“Malfoy,” Potter gasped, struggling to catch his breath, blinking rapidly as the wind picked up speed. “What are you doing here?”
“I didn’t then,” Harry continues hurriedly. “I thought if I’d already put in so much time, I might as well see it all the way through. Then a few months later they started talking about placements and teams we’d like to be a part of, and honestly, none of them appealed to me. That was it then.”
It was also clear that the daily exercise had lent definition to his form, making him appear broader and sturdier. Very different from the small, thin boy Draco had first met.
Harry huffs and waits till Hermione’s caught up with him before walking towards the road that leads to The Leaky.
Draco tenses, wand at the ready. Those blasted birds have been the bane of his existence lately since they realised Draco sometimes has seeds on him on his way to the arboretum.
“Question time is over, it’s time for bed now,” Draco says, getting ready to stand. Within seconds the room is filled with twin protests, both boys loudly proclaiming their displeasure.
Draco performs the standard stasis charms on the parchments he was working on. “Go away, I’m still working.”
Teddy looks up at his name, distracted. The watering can swerve and almost sprays water everywhere, but Zeb takes hold of it in time.
I do have some ideas for little one shots in this verse that I hope to write once I'm done with all my college apps. And once I fix up this fic, I know it's filled with errors.
Draco strides across the kitchen to gently take the package from the owl’s leg. Scorpius is jumping up and down next to him, obviously excited to see the owl.
As Draco settled into his usual spot on the window ledge, Transfiguration scroll in hand, he found his thoughts wandering back to Potter. He tried hard to ignore the other’s presence in the room by studiously focusing on the text in front of him, but Hubert’s Law of Matter Transference was even less engaging than usual.
He takes his time changing, smiling every time he hears a giggle from the bed and Harry’s immediate futile attempts at shushing.
As days passed and no one came knocking, Draco felt like he could finally relax. He’d sneakily ordered a wireless, using one of the school owls to place the mail order. He had been fiddling with the controls, trying to remember the spell for his preferred station that played the classics, when his attention was stolen by a knock on the door.
It’s amazing how that little family has burrowed their place into his heart, he can’t begin to imagine life without them.
Harry’s feelings about his acquaintances were made abundantly clear any time either of them were brought up. Draco knew Harry didn’t mean it as a remark on him personally, but it still felt that way.
He knocks once on the door before walking in, the occupants of the room pausing their conversation to face the new entrants. The woman nearest to the door seems to be around his age, with light brown hair tied neatly at the nape of her neck. The man next to her looks older, smart glasses perched at the bridge of his nose, clearly visible laugh lines signalling his age. Sitting across from them is a much older woman, greying hair pulled back into a stern bun, though the expression is softened by the smile on her face as she rises to greet Draco.
Thank you to everyone reading along! Your comments really keep me going otherwise writing a chapter a day would be quite an impossible feat for me. ♥
Harry sputters, caught unawares by the sudden question. “I dunno, he was fine the last time I saw him.”
Harry sits there, stunned. He can see it now, all the little signs he had disregarded but that had still caught his eye.
Harry hums thoughtfully. “It’s a newer office, you know. They had only started putting together the team when Madeline reached out to me. She was an instructor for the Trainee Program and thought I’d be a good fit. It seemed different enough that it excited me and I could also use everything I’d learned so it didn’t go to waste.”
It had been after Harry had tucked Teddy into bed, in his room at the Manor, that he finally brought up the one thing he had been agonising over for the past few months. Draco managed to beat him to the punch though, almost shouting,
Harry gulps, straightens his tie and stands. He lightly clinks his knife against his wine glass, drawing everyone’s attention to himself.
Malfoy is on the sofa, holding onto a cup with both hands. He looks nervous, the earlier playfulness missing at the sun rise.
Harry had tried hard to reason with him, refusing to accept what was right in front of him. Draco could somewhat empathise. Harry hadn’t been the one to spend day after day waiting for a single moment of recognition from the other. To him, this was a total surprise.
They share a look and it’s enough to confirm that they’re both thinking the same thing. This holiday is nothing like what they had imagined it would be.
“Don’t be fooled Potter,” Malfoy teases, the playful smirk replacing the worried frown. “Underneath this goody-two-shoes act, I’m still as evil as ever.”
Potter jolted. “No ‘m okay,” he tried to explain, struggling weakly against Draco’s hold before giving up, “No hospital wing. Please.”
With all the patience I can muster, I slowly move my hips forward and ease into him, biting my lips to hold back a moan that’s threatening to break free. No matter how many times we’ve done this before, the feeling of Draco’s body clenching around me, holding me in, will never fail to amaze me.
Harry is out of his seat before he knows it, striding towards the bar with sure steps. He slips between Malfoy and the other man, leaning against the bar as he turns towards Malfoy.
Suddenly Harry remembers he had actually been running late. “Sorry for making you wait, Malfoy,” he rushes to apologise, fixing himself and adding, “err Draco.”
Malfoy has Harry set the table while he finishes up the cooking and Harry follows along; mostly because thinking too much about the surreality of the situation had started giving him a headache.
Draco moves wearily through the living room, brushing the soot off his outer robes and dropping his satchel on the couch. He can’t even muster the energy to be tidy right now, there’s a nervous energy thrumming right under his skin and it’s all he can think of right now.
Harry grins, aware of just how helpless Draco is when faced with his smiles. Pleading looks don’t work with Draco anymore, his husband has developed an immunity to them which proves very useful each time the twins ask for something unreasonable. But when faced with his family’s smiles, their happy faces directed right at him, Draco melts faster than butter.
Draco breathes out a sigh against Harry’s neck, unable to resist giving the smooth skin a bite before soothing it with his tongue. Harry curls his fingers in Draco’s shirt and pulls on it, moving it out the way so that he can slide his other hand up Draco’s stomach. Draco shudders and grinds back against him, fisting one hand in Harry’s hair to ground himself. Harry bends down till he can lick a long stripe up Draco’s neck, chasing the taste of the vodka.
They settle down on the sofa after, the wireless playing an older ballad in the background, as Draco reads to Teddy. Within minutes Teddy is asleep, leaning fully onto Draco. With one hand he drapes a throw blanket over the child, wandlessly bringing over one of his own books to read.
“Malfoy?” Harry gasps. While it might have been years since he last came across the man, probably at the end of the year dinner in their eighth year, it’s a face he knows he can’t ever forget.
“That’s amazing, Draco,” Harry says. He sounds genuinely happy when complimenting him. “It’s about time they understand your worth.”
“Harry,” Draco whispers, their breaths misting as he closes the distance between them. “I need to apologise, too. I was wrong to place all the fault solely on your shoulders and just
Draco laughs in surprise as Harry pulls him onto his lap, hugging him close with his face buried in the crook of Draco’s neck.
As I reach his thighs I can’t help myself and place small bites while moving up, not hard enough to wake him up but enough to bruise; to mark him. Draco hates that he bruises so easily, gets annoyed when he puts a glamour in place to hide the bites on his arms or the shape of my fingers around his neck.
“I still remember the ceremony, you know,” he breathes, his voice soft as he remembers the day he buried his father. “ My mother made sure to have everything done perfectly, right down to the wreathe of his favourite flowers . . . ”
“Hannah really has changed the place,” Harry comments, twisting in his seat to take in all the decorations. The real eye catcher though is the tree in the middle of the room, a tree made of empty wine bottles, the fairy lights making the bottles glow and casting soft shadows around the room.
“I located the wizarding hospital in France, ready for worst. Instead I learnt that, somehow, in a feat of magic not seen in the past few decades, I was pregnant.”
Harry would have given him anything but apparently Malfoy is made of sterner stuff as he shakes his head.
Blaise raises his hand in surrender, “Not a word, I swear.” Pansy rolls her eyes at Draco and heads towards the bar, snagging a seat as soon as she gets there.
"However,," Draco pouts, gazing at a photo of Harry hard at work in their garden, the sunlight giving the picture a hazy look,  "I am annoyed at myself for not hiding it better, you weren't supposed to see it before tomorrow."
“You,” Draco pointedly looks over at the wide expanse of bed space behind Harry, “know we have a fairly large bed right?”
Harry laughs as Teddy tries to tackle him to the ground, his small fists barely making Harry feel a thing but he falls to the ground, groaning and pleading for mercy.
Potter refuses to cooperate, whining and throwing up in the alley behind the bar. Draco watches, amused, as Potter shakes his head and performs a breath clearing and sobering charm on himself.
He still had his moments of doubt. The thought of uprooting himself and moving all the way across the world was terrifying.
Speaking of Draco, Harry frowns as he picks up a blue sock that most definitely doesn’t belong to him. He shrugs and adds it to his laundry pile; Draco probably left it over by mistake.
Rolling his eyes Teddy leaves the war zone and concentrates on helping Scorpius finish the snowman they started earlier, realising he won’t get now any answer from Harry.
It's a Sunday. Harry still has nowhere to go but now he has to make sure he spends the rest of the day in bed with this man who is close to becoming a permanent part of his life.
Draco hasn’t seem him for more than a minute at a stretch in over a week. He’s always off with Draco’s mother, tasting cakes or finalising appetizers.
.” By the end of it Draco was almost shouting, his voice echoed across the empty hallway behind him.
“That’s my point! It seems like he was three just yesterday, tomorrow he’ll be thirty and moving out . . “
Harry smiles shakily at his friends and follows the Healer, he feels like his entire body is thrumming with anticipation. The room is filled with soft light, enough for Harry to make out Draco sleeping on the bed, the tension in his gut unwinds at seeing him okay, right there in front of him. The cots are next to the bed and Harry gasps in awe as he looks down at his sons, both of them swaddled in soft blankets. They are sleeping, making tiny little snuffling sounds, and Harry can do nothing but stare, too afraid to reach in and hold them.
Draco had watched, amazed, as Potter had transformed a spare roll of parchment into a little Snitch, complete with the etched markings around it. He’d handed it to Draco with a smile, the soft look in his eyes making Draco feel oddly light-headed. As their fingers had brushed, Draco found he couldn’t look away, had to make himself turn towards the tree and gently place it right at the top.
“Then you’re a more forgiving man than most others out there,” Malfoy laughs bitterly. “Anyway, it’s a good thing you stopped by because I would have probably spent the night finishing a bottle of wine and falling asleep on the sofa.”
The food is delicious and Harry makes sure to compliment Draco after every bite, smiling cheekily as he does so, before Draco shushes him by throwing a napkin at his head. It’s relaxed, no hint of tension in the air as they talk about their day and work.
There's a budding warmth in Harry's chest as he looks at Draco, the tousled hair and slim legs peeking out from under his shirt. It feels like with each moment that he spends with Draco that feeling solidifies a little further, making itself comfortable somewhere in the hollow of his chest. It's been there since the first time he and Draco met up for drinks alone, the refined music of the restaurant in stark contrast to the loud thudding of Harry's heart that he was sure Draco could hear across the table.
Harry settles on the bed next to Albus and carefully tucks the covers around him, “It’s okay. We can do a short one today.”
Malfoy looks apprehensive, a hint of uncertainty in his eyes as he waits for Harry to walk down to them. His son, meanwhile, smiles unreservedly at Harry, his little hand holding onto his father.
Harry hums, he had tuned out of this conversation within two minutes of Ron’s ranting. It’s a bi-weekly occurrence by now, Ron and Hermione argue over something trivial, Ron complains to Harry for the first five minutes and then they spend the next hour finding a gift that would convince Hermione to forgive Ron.
If they really are going to grab a meal together might as well start calling each other by their first names. The alternative feels too much like regressing back to his teenage years. He’s been trying to do less of that these days.
“Okay then. Come on Grandma,” he calls, jumping off Harry’s lap, but not before giving him a quick hug.
He’s out walking the puppy when he spots Scorpius waving from the window. Harry waves back, smiling as he sees Draco trying to make Scorpius put a coat on.
“Don’t go, Draco.” Teddy pouts, his expression a cross between sullen and sad. “My toys are here and Milly and Zeb and the peacock and Draco.”
“He spends all the time with you now. And Teddy. But Teddy is okay because I like playing with him.” Scorpius adds with a pout.
“When you started acting like an idiot,” Blaise states simply. Assured of his win, he fixes his tie and walks forward, placing an arm around Draco’s shoulders and steering him towards the door, “We’re young and beautiful only once, why not make the most of it?”
“I can’t believe it,” he beams, blinking away tears as he tries to speak through his joy. “I was hoping we would talk about maybe adopting one day and - “
Draco stopped reading, ignoring the formalities listed to stare back at Harry. He could feel a slow, rolling wave of panic simmering just under the surface, making it difficult for him to think.
Draco deigns not to reply, which in hindsight is a bad idea as it gives Blaise the motivation to keep going.
. Drinking together does not equal sleeping with someone and yet, on a rainy Saturday morning, Harry wakes up to a naked Malfoy staring at him.
“. . . but then Aunt Hermione walked into the room. She was so angry. Rose is grounded for a week.” Albus chortles, nudging Scorpius with his elbow. He looks far too gleeful to be completely innocent. Harry watches in amusement as Scorpius shoots his brother a glare, almost an identical copy of the unimpressed look Draco wears when he’s just about done with Harry’s antics.
Harry nervously fixes his scarf, the pamphlets in his hand slipping out of his grasp in the process. With a curse he bends down to pick them up -
As Harry watches Draco fondly argue with the boys, a nightly ritual, he thinks back to the day they first met after the end of the war.
As the snow crunches beneath their feet, Harry wonders how Draco had thought that Harry could ever say no, his nervousness last night had been adorable and it had left Harry wanting to hug him, whisper praises in his ear and make him feel like he’s worth something.
Harry peers into a shop as they pass by, the cashmere mufflers displayed at the window catching his eye. He makes a mental note to come back later, that shade of blue would really bring out the colour in Draco’s eyes.
He managed to shoot Harry a smile when he looked up. To Draco’s surprise Harry looked reassured at that. Like he had been waiting for Draco’s approval.
We're almost at the end! Just 2 more chapters, wow! If there's anything you'd like to see, feel free to drop it in the comments and I can try to somehow fit those in!
Still, Draco found himself unable to imagine a scenario where he would willingly join the trio for a lunch date. What would they even talk about? The fact that Draco’s friends had abandoned him to be stuck here alone and he probably deserved it?
“Finally! Draco, he’s not your fuck buddy, stop calling him that,” Pansy laughs gleefully. Draco resists the urge to turn back and hex both of them.
This was his house, and he’s sure he can make it have some semblance of a home once again. Leaving the rest of the cleaning up to the elves, Draco decides to tackle the more pressing issue first. In order to get down to testing different hybrid variants of the core plant ingredients, he needs an enclosed space, preferably outside, where he can alter conditions as needed.
Harry shrugs, a leg thrown over Draco’s legs as he pulls Draco closer with an arm around his waist. “Hmmm, I like it here better.”
Draco’s heart aches for his little boy but he’s been a mess all morning, awake since 4 am, making sure everything is ready for Scorpius. Harry had taken one look at Draco’s red eyes and tear streaked face before he had decided it’s best if he gets Scorpius dressed for his first day of school. Draco waits outside Scorpius’s bedroom, one hand resting on the doorframe as he watches Harry tie the little boy’s shoes.
“Thank you for getting it started,” he smiled, already folding his sleeves up. Draco leans back against the counter across from Harry, his arms folded and gaze narrowed as he waits for Harry to say something, any comment at all on the state of the kitchen.
, to touch, to kiss his way down Draco’s neck take in his fill of that intoxicating scent that leaves him light headed with wanting.
Draco sputters, face heating up as he locks eyes with Harry, who looks very smug for someone holding chunks of raw beef. Draco rolls his eyes at Harry’s smirk, sniffing politely before going back to openly admiring his husband. “Just enjoying what’s in front of me.”
“I don’t understand,” Harry says, blinking confusedly. He looks tired, dark circles under his eyes, exhaustion etched in every feature of his face.
They have their sandwiches in the sunroom, Teddy regaling Draco with tales from day-care. He’s never heard Teddy talk this much, at least to him, and he’s awed at being allowed this glimpse into Teddy’s personality.
The night Draco got the scar was simultaneously the scariest and the happiest night of Harry’s life.
“Better than them, I’d say.” He nods towards the two cats sitting in front of the Christmas tree, both of them decked up in Christmas costumes.
no way he forgot to take the potion yesterday. It hasn’t happened once in over 4 years since he started taking the daily dose to combat one of the many side effects of having a Veela heritage.
They jerk apart at Teddy’s shriek. Harry takes in his half-finished snowman, who definitely had the upper part of his body the last time Harry had checked, with a sigh.
Harry sighs at Draco’s dramatic groan. “Draco,” Harry says, waiting till Draco looks up, “just because he chose to go over to his friend’s house no way means that he doesn’t want to spend time with you.”
His first attempt, cooking Scorpius breakfast, is met with a shattered plate and porridge on the floor.
Someone who can be infuriating, who can make Harry want to hit something in frustration and at the same time shout off the rooftops his love for the bane of his existence.
As the last of their guests leave, Draco closes the Floo, feeling the wards settle around the house. The sitting room is dark save for the light from the Christmas tree, the twinkling lights casting shadows across the walls. Teddy had been in charge of the decoration, guiding Harry and Draco on where to place each bauble and each string of tinsel.
When Draco gently pushes him to take more toys, he stubbornly refuses. He wants to leave them there so he can play with Milly and Zeb next time.
“Yes, me and my son. He’s staying over with my mother tonight, they had plans to decorate the tree in the Manor.”
He looks pensive, the cold highlighting the flush in his cheeks. Draco is reminded of another boy he once talked to in the snow.
Most days all he wanted to do was to leave, go back to his room at Hogwarts, find Harry lounging on that ratty sofa and curl into him to feel warm again.
Draco hums, making his way towards the door. He gestures for Harry to follow him, the boy still quiet in his arms. He wonders how long Harry has been around the boy to be so at ease carrying him around.
Malfoy fidgets with the sleeves on his sweater, with his hair falling on his face and they way he’s biting his lip, he looks like the teenager who had stood across from him in courtroom nine as Harry testified in his support.
“Draco’s pregnant,” Harry mumbles, still in a daze. He feels like his entire life just got tilted on  its axis and it won’t ever reset the same. As they get hugged by everyone around them, congratulations and exclamations all around, Harry and Draco don’t  let go of each other’s hand.
under his feet, Draco almost turned back at the bite in the wind. The real winter chill was here, the cold inching underneath all his layers to settle on his skin, goosebumps erupting up and down his arms. The decision was made for him, though, when he spotted the hazy figure of Potter by the lake shore.
“I’ve wanted to do that for so long,” Malfoy whispers against his lips, bringing Harry’s attention to the fact that they’re pressed together, he can feel Malfoy’s chest rise and fall against his. He’s never before noticed just how red Malfoy’s lips are, or how he can stare into Malfoy’s eyes for hours.
Harry is smiling now, he pulls Draco’s chair closer till their legs are tangled and Harry can lean forward enough to place his forehead against Draco’s.
There’s a rapidly growing pile of boxes collecting in the foyer—a mix of his things from France, new furniture pieces for his bedroom and a supply of the materials needed for his research. His original plan for the weekend was to get started on clearing out that pile and finally setting up his bedroom. However, after a quick breakfast, where he spends more time poring over his notes rather than eating, he sets off for the arboretum.
Professor Sprout had been nice enough, meeting him for a one-on-one conversation to understand his areas of study and how Herbology could fit in with them. While a career in Potions had always seemed like the obvious choice for him, he’d lately found himself unable to see a future in a career so largely influenced by his godfather.
would be more likely to turn into a planning demon, staying up all night fretting over the seating plan, or the flower arrangements.
He tries not to dwell on it, but it’s not the first time he realises the extent to which Scorpius’s life is filled with Muggle things - all his toys, the Muggle appliances in their house; they even live in a predominantly Muggle neighbourhood.
That night they troop back home, Scorpius asleep in Harry’s arms as Draco carries Loki, the little puppy tired out from all the running and playing.
They’ve met them individually. In a way Draco had an advantage because he’s met Teddy before, during his mother’s mandatory Thursday lunches with her sister. His meeting with Teddy went without a hitch.
Harry leans back, smirking as Draco's eyes track the hard-earned muscles tensing in his arm. He pulls up one side of the covers, biting back the fond laugh as Draco first carefully moves the camera to the side, barely glancing at the photo that emerges.
He spent the night dozing in his abandoned classroom, now slightly more comfortable due to the sudden appearance of more blankets and a tattered old sofa. He was not sure where they came from or who dropped them off, but he felt like he’d seen
Dinner is a pleasant affair. Tara is loud and jovial; she has an air around her that instantly puts people at ease, making two hours pass like nothing. It’s around dessert that things take a more serious turn.
They’re back outside again, enjoying the last few days of unpolluted snow when Harry notices that Scorpius isn’t out with them. With a quick kiss on Draco’s cheek, Harry heads inside, wondering what new form of torture Scorpius would subject him to. He’s definitely a Malfoy, Harry thinks, chuckling to himself, his tantrums have been downright devious and he stops dead in his tracks.
He’s been able to write off the lavender, leaving behind only hellebore and valerian root. That itself is enough for the Aurors at Forensics to start tracking down suppliers for those ingredients. It’s not much, but it’s a better understanding than where the team was before Draco joined.
With a little help from Hermione and the clever use of Muggle repelling and weather charms, Harry has managed to convert his backyard into somewhat of a spring-time haven for Loki.
“My boyfriend, the eternal optimist.” Draco rolls his eyes, his lips quirked in a smile as he waits for Harry’s reaction.
“Hey! You had fun that night, don’t lie,” Harry teases him, “If I recall we got up to quite a bit of fun in the cloak room.”
spying. It isn’t really his fault that he look right into Malfoy’s backyard from his bedroom window.
So he’d refuse every time Harry would ask and would spend the afternoon alone instead, busying himself in the schoolwork or, surprisingly, find himself near the greenhouses.
He’s perched over an ancient scroll, over two hundred years old; he’s not sure but he thinks it’s the report that led to the creation of the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Fixing the dial on his monocle, to increase the power of the lens, he leans in, his chair tipped forward precariously as he tries to read the script. After a few minutes of trying he shakes his head with a sigh, placing the monocle to the side; it’s still too illegible. Tipping his chair a little more forward, he waves his wand over the parchment, taking care to regulate his wand movement to control the strength of the spell. With documents as old as these they need to be treated with restoration spells in a staggered manner, gradually building the strength in the parchment.
Teddy nods, clumsily trying to roll up his sleeves just like Draco had. He stays still as Draco helps him, waiting patiently for him to gather everything on the counter in front of them.
He whines as Draco’s movement moves his hair out of reach, drawing Harry’s attention to his action. Harry chuckles, gripping the tiny hand in his to bring it down.
All it takes is a simple test. Even as he waits for the potion to work, he already knows the truth deep down. He can’t believe he didn’t realise it sooner, his body was
“The whole team should be in today,” Everly chats as they walk, the Office of Forensics seemingly located right at the end of the floor. “They’ve all been quite eager to meet you.”
The date will happen tomorrow. I promise. I'm making sure to mention it here so you can hold me accountable!
Scorpius carefully sprinkles icing sugar over the latest batch of Christmas cookies he helped Harry bake. Loki is sitting next to him, patiently waiting for his best friend to slip him another cookie while Harry is distracted.
He’s still staring when Harry turns, his smile bright enough to match the sun rays behind him as he greets Draco, “Good morning!”
He straightens with a jerk, eyes widening in surprise as he takes in the sight of Narcissa Malfoy standing in front of him. She’s looking at Harry with a faintly amused expression, an elegant eyebrow arched as she waits.
Instead he tightens his hold on Harry’s hair and tilts his head, moving forward till their lips brush. Harry still has one hand on Draco’s waist, his fingers digging in just enough to tease. Draco wants more; he’s tired of these games. He feels like he’s been waiting since the morning, since he rolled out of Harry’s bed.
“I had fun today,” Draco says, smiling that one smile which made Harry’s heart skip a beat every time.
“Malfoy.” Ron nods, taking Hermione’s coat from her and hanging it next to his. “How’s it going, mate?” He asks Harry, side stepping Draco to enter the kitchen.
the letter from his desk and levitates it over to Harry. It’s fun watching his expression go from tense to curious to hopeful.
Harry laughs. “We never would have guessed. Don’t forget to take that heart you made, you can hang in on the tree.”
Harry flinches. “Quiet down, Malfoy, jeez.” He hides under the pillow and sighs in relief at the reprieve from the bright  light. His joy though is short lived when Malfoy snatches the pillow away.
There’s sweat pooled above the swell of his arse, I watch with bated breath as another drop rolls down his perfectly arched back.
“Then, why. . “ Harry trails off, trying to think of a reason why Scorpius won’t get a chance to attend Hogwarts.
Harry tries not to think about how Malfoy’s arm is almost touching his, the crowd gathered around them pushing them closer by the minute.
The song changes, making the crowd roar; there are people jumping around them, the lights flashing brighter and faster and yet Draco Malfoy has eyes only for Harry Potter. He wants to find Blaise and tell him that he’s right, there’s no way Draco could even think about going home with anyone else tonight when he has the option of getting fucked so hard by Harry Potter that he forgets his name. But it’s not only about that, it’s also about the warm body that holds him tight at night, the lazy morning kisses that make him wonder how he ever woke up before and the breakfast in bed.
He’s having fun watching Ron and Seamus argue about the Canon’s chances in the upcoming match when something catches his eye. Malfoy is at the bar, standing a little apart from the rest of the crowd and he looks very uncomfortable. Harry frowns and looks for Luna, when he spots a man approach Malfoy, making the other take a few steps back, his posture rigid.
The one solace the Manor offered was the sprawling gardens, acres upon acres of open land that was once the best in the country but was now the perfect representation of what the Malfoy name stood for. Drained and dry, no remainder of the splendour they once held. It gave Draco something to do, the familiarity of digging through soil to carefully nurture something became the bright spot of his days.
Harry looks up from the paper, Scorpius is sitting with the puppy, both of them tumbling around on the plush carpet. He lowers his paper, realising that he really does still have to name the puppy.
Draco places his napkin to the side. “I’m not entirely sure, to be honest.” He pauses, running a finger around the rim of his glass. “The Institute position is still open for me. So I guess it’s up to me.”
Most of all though, thank you. Anyone who ever commented, bookmarked this fic, subscribed to it or left a kudos - I'm sending
“I don’t know what’s wrong, he just won’t tell me anything,” Draco sighs, anguish peeking through his confusion. Scorpius has never shut him out like this before.
“I haven’t found the right name yet,” Harry says, peering at puppy in front of him, who is lying on his back in hopes of getting a belly rub.
While Draco tries to get his work done quickly and be out of the Ministry as soon as possible, he can’t help but notice the fact that Harry never stays past five. Like clockwork, he’s out of the office at the same time every evening. It makes Draco curious; the Harry he remembers often stayed back at work till the late evening on the regular.
Harry almost wishes there was nothing on the bed between them so he could drag Draco closer. He wants to press a kiss against the color blooming in Draco's cheeks, feel how warm they are against his lips. As it is though, he settles for reaching for Draco's hand.
Within weeks Draco realised that Sprout had started assigning more of the finicky plants to his care. As a result, he started spending even longer hours reading and researching, often also bothering her at odd times of the day if he had a question.
Halfway through his skincare routine his medicine cabinet chimes because of a helpful reminder charm that makes sure he takes his daily supplements on time. As he reaches for his daily potion he stops short, brow furrowed he takes in the two vials where they should be only one. Ignoring the rising panic, Draco thinks back to the morning before. He’s sure there’s probably a mistake in his spellwork, there’s
“I can see that,” Malfoy says, tapping the biscuit tin on the counter. “Come on, let’s move to the living room.”
“Why? It’s a Saturday. Lemme sleep,” he murmurs, trying to slide under the covers. If he can’t see Malfoy then he probably isn’t here.
Draco's voice makes Harry jolt, dropping the photo in his hand. He looks up just as Draco bursts through the door, carrying his suit in one hand, just as Harry had suspected.
She’d suggested that he explore the different specialisations Hogwarts offered, and, having no valid counterargument besides he’d rather not, Draco found himself frequenting the greenhouses. Despite his misgivings, and his continued distaste for dirt, there was something oddly calming about the glass structures.
“Will you come with me?” Draco asks, gesturing towards the pamphlet about the Society and it’s work.
“It’s always something, isn’t it?” Draco cut him off, he leaned tiredly against the door. He hadn’t felt like going any closer.
He can’t find it in himself to care because now he knows the breathy sighs that leaves Malfoy’s lips as Harry leans over him on the bed, he can recall the sight of Malfoy biting on his lower lip as Harry enters him, he can feel the drag of nails down his back.
“Hey,” Harry admonishes, letting go enough that he can look at Draco directly, “don’t. Stop. You can’t change the past any more than I can, but what we, I mean you,’ Harry corrects himself hastily,  “can do is to ensure that Scorpius get’s all the possible chances in life. This
“Teddy,” Draco calls, lifting the boy from his perch to help him climb onto a stool placed right in front of the window. The kitchen feels so open now, compared to how it was before, the new windows letting in more light and giving the otherwise dark room some life. “Do you think you can help me?”
It’s not a conscious decision but after hours of going over the theory there’s only so much they can do. They’re aware of their roles, Malfoy will perform the counter curse to end the Fiendfyre while Harry will provide the magical support to boost his.
“I’ve been keeping him hidden, too afraid to even step out because I don’t want him exposed to the kind of hatred and prejudice I’ve seen others have to suffer through, that I’ve inflicted shamelessly myself on others.”
Draco surveys the debris spread around him. The congealed mess in the pan, the half chopped veggies on the cutting boards, the almost empty tin of cookies across from him. He finds himself getting annoyed, he had
his friend Bill’s dads were. While they had spluttered, embarrassed and too awkward to look at each other, and explained that no, they were
Spending time with the man, and perhaps equally importantly, meeting Scorpius had made him forget all about his initial suspicions about the man. His curiosity was still alive, he wanted to know more about
He nods, bending down so that Scorpius can get a better look at the little thing. He coos at the puppy, running a finger down his back and smiling at this father when the puppy wiggles.
Draco gasps in awe, making Harry look over. Teddy had been busy trying to water the mini flower pots Draco had put aside for him, but every time he tried to lift the child sized watering can one of the elves would rush over to help him.
Harry stumbles back against the wall outside his room as Malfoy fall onto him, focused on getting his hands on Harry’s hair.
The atmosphere lightens, making Draco’s racing heart slow down a little. “Anyway,” he continues softly, raising a hand to brush through Harry’s dishevelled hair. “I do remember bringing up this little difference in our anatomies. We can thank Great Aunt Alice for this, she’s the one who always fancied a shag with a Veela.”
Potter hummed sleepily. Within seconds he was snoring softly, making Draco frown and debate whether or not a Silencing Spell would be going overboard.
” Harry mock exclaims, “it’s all you. It’s uncanny.” He giggles at Draco’s affronted expression, pressing kisses along his neck till Draco relaxes back into his pillow. He noses along Draco's jaw, dropping a featherlight kiss along his corner of his lips before brushing along his cupid's bow. Draco opens up easily under him, bringing a hand up to cup his cheek. They kiss slowly, enjoying the moment and each other’s presence. When Harry barely suppresses a yawn, Draco presses one list kiss against his lips.
Too lost in the indignation of being disappointed over Potter leaving while he slept, it took him a minute to spot the scrap of parchment placed over the blanket. A wandless
Despite his mounting curiosity, Draco made himself look away. He had an assignment to finish. If he was fast enough he could make it to the kitchens before breakfast and grab himself a snack without having to visit the Great Hall.
He smiles as Draco walks up to him; with the boys distracted, Harry can see how Draco finally let’s his relaxed face fall as he gets checked over for injuries.
Harry smiles and ruffles Scorpius’s hair as he enters, asking as he takes off his coat, “Where is your daddy?”
“Yeah, there’s something about working against the clock,” Draco muses, thinking back to the exhilaration he felt on finding the answer. “It’s quite unlike my regular research work.”
It’s towards that room that Everly starts walking, casually explaining how the Office is structured across different sub-departments, with the Field Agents using this corridor while the Lab has the entire other space.
“Hey, no.” Harry makes Draco face him, waiting till Draco is looking right at him to say, “It’s not your fault. It’s
Harry looks up from the lone game of Solitaire he’s playing with a pack of cards he found in the bedroom. Malfoy looks nervous, the sweatshirt and pyjama bottoms that Harry unearthed hanging loose on his lean frame.
“Let’s go!” Draco shouts to Blaise over the music, he leans over the bar and grabs a bottle of vodka, making sure the bartender adds it to his tab before linking his arm with Blaise and dragging him to the dance floor.
They break apart in surprise to find most of their friends standing at the door to the pub. Hermione is rolling her eyes as Ron hands Seamus some money and Luna is smiling proudly at them.
Taking a shaky breath, Draco brings a hand down to his stomach. He can’t bring himself to touch just yet, palm hovering over his abdomen. He’s a shaky, nervous mess when he finally brings his hand down. It shouldn’t feel any different at all, he knows this logically and as a qualified Healer.
Draco startles, almost falling over. He sits back on the ground, shielding his eyes from the direct glare of the sun as he looks up to find Harry.
With a slight smile, Harry nods. One day, he whispers more than says out loud. Judging by the light flush of color on his cheeks, he knows Malfoy heard him.
And it has absolutely nothing to do with the flush that rises on Malfoy’s cheeks when he’s angry or the adorable twitch of his nose when he’s trying to rein in his temper.
They didn’t necessarily need him here; Emma seemed more than capable of figuring this out eventually. However, time was of the essence—as they reminded him multiple times—and they were counting on his expertise in the area of hybrid plants and their impact on potion potency to help them expedite the process.
Much like the rest of the house, the dining room is stunning. Bathed in warm lamp light, it’s cosy and inviting. Little tea lights in shallow glass bowls are placed all the way down the centre of the table, the candle light reflecting off of the crystal goblets placed next to them. Interspersed throughout are little sprigs of baby’s breath, the flowers standing out amongst all the glass.
It’s been two days and he still can’t get over the fact that Malfoy is his neighbour. Out of all the possibilities in the world, he never expected this to be how he would run into Malfoy again.
doze off. He was so used to the sight at this point—the towering trees, the still water of the lake and the slowly drifting fog moving towards the castle—that the slight movement was enough to catch his eye.
. The body beneath all those Christmas lights is definitely fit but Harry can’t over how spectacularly crass the whole thing is, it’s
idea,” Malfoy says, laughing at the memory. “I had no idea what to do but even through all the confusion I knew one thing for sure, Scorpius was my chance at redemption. He was, and will always be, my second chance.”
As the snow continues to fall, they stand under the streetlight, old wounds finally starting to settle, to heal.
Harry smiles as walks down the lane, the bright Christmas lights and doors adorned with wreaths a pleasant change from his old neighbourhood. Any lingering doubts he might have had about his decision to move out of Grimmauld Place have been cleared, it’s only been a week and he already feels like he’s right where he belongs.
Malfoy flushes and Harry curls his fingers around the cup he’s been handed, the temptation to reach out and touch is too strong.
Weekly dates to sleepovers to daily meetings. Draco kept waiting for that sense of familiarity to strike, for that moment of clarity where he would feel, “This is just like last time.” It never came.
The periods of nausea have gotten longer than the periods without and the common potions he would take for a stomach bug haven’t worked. He’s trying to brief himself on a patient history while walking down the corridor. He’s half focussed on the scroll in his hands though, distracted by the ache in his lower back.
As Scorpius has fun icing the new cookies, Harry looks out the window at the falling snow and waits for Draco to come pick Scorpius up.
Harry’s not sure if it’s because Luna insists and he decides he doesn’t care. It’s a little surprising how soon he gets used to Malfoy sitting there, always on the seat next to his, staring into his glass or talking to Luna. He doesn’t try to talk to Harry again; Harry tries not to analyse the part of him that secretly, just maybe, wants him to.
“Looks like the news will have to wait,” Draco muses, wondering if he should drop some food off at the office. He’s deliberately ignoring the feeling of relief at not having to have
“Scorpius Malfoy, I consider myself to be the luckiest man on earth because I got the opportunity to watch you grow into a kind and loving boy, who stands up for what is right. Will you do me the honour of giving me permission to marry your father? To become a permanent part of your lives?”
Now that he mentions it Harry can vaguely recall interacting with some of Hermione’s co-workers. He takes another look at Dave, remembering the interested glances he’d pretended to ignore, too exhausted from a full and busy work week. Dave is smiling good naturedly, waiting for Harry to say something.
personality. Normally, Draco would be proud that his son has had the chance to grow into his own person. But when midway during lunch, Scorpius throws a tantrum of epic proportions and overturns his glass onto Harry’s lap, Draco has to call onto every shred of patience he has not to react like his father.
With this chapter, we have reached the end of this stage of the fic. I'm happy ending this here, now. ♥
Before Malfoy can shoot back a retort, Luna appears, beaming at the two of them as she places their drinks on the table.
Before he knew it, it was time to go. With one last look at the sprawling gardens outside, the months of effort he put into them, Draco set the final ward on the Manor and Disapparated.
The thought of settling into a warm bath, surrounded by the heady scent of chamomile and peppermint, makes Harry already feel better. By the time he enters the bathroom, a trail of clothes behind him, it already smells divine.
The house is filled with the wonderful smell of freshly baked cookies, a heady scent that make anyone who comes across it smile. The kitchen is a mess, flour and sugar covering almost every available space, a bag of sprinkles upturned on the counter, and cookie cutters scattered across the worktop. But neither the man who is carefully pulling out a tray from the oven, or the little boy and the puppy beside him pay any heed to the mess.
Neither knew how to give. What to give. So they observe, wait and watch and think and act. They have years of experience on how to read the other,
Draco clears his throat. “No, it’s not because of that. Mcgonagall has her faults, but I’ve never known her to be unfair.”
He wakes up one morning to Loki whining outside the bedroom door. The light from the windows is enough to tell him that it’s past daybreak.
“So,” he starts, capturing Draco’s gaze, his eyes focussed only on Draco. “You have to take a potion because you can get pregnant and there are Veelas involved?”
Draco frowns in sympathy, watching as Harry presses the lift button again. As they wait, Draco brings up something he’d been wondering since the day Harry had come over to the Manor but hadn’t had the chance to ask.
Pansy drapes her coat over her arm and accepts hugs from the two of them before she leaves, manoeuvring through the crowd.
“Always the hero,” Draco whispers, his lips curling in a small smile, eyes filled with admiration, and Harry dares not to hope, and something close to fondness.
Draco rolls his eyes at Harry, but he makes sure to sway his hips as he walks to the bathtub, waiting till Harry has scooted back to climb in. He settles in front of Harry, back to his chest, and sighs in contentment as Harry wraps an arm around his waist and pulls him closer.
“Err,” Malfoy stammers, a blush staining his cheeks, “I . . . Potter, I was thinking of trying something new today.”
“Well, there are my best friends Ron and Hermione, and their daughter Rose, you met her at Teddy’s birthday party this year during his Easter holiday from Hogwarts, remember?”
“Not to mention,” Blaise continues, counting down the points on his fingers, “all our conversations these days include some mention of what a good fuck he is, perhaps even the best you’ve had. So stop being an idiot.”
“What do you mean?” Draco sits up at that, frowning as he looks over at Harry who is staring right at him. “We talked about this!”
Harry smiles and ruffles Scorpius’s hair as he enters, asking as he takes off his coat, “Where is your daddy?”
Draco bites his lip and resists the urge to fidget. “I’m pregnant. We’re having a baby, in about seven months or so, hopefully. I just, umm, I only found out recently,” he rambles, getting more and more nervous as Harry says nothing, “and that too purely by chance you would think being a Healer I would know what’s going on with my body but it took me ages to figure out what the exhaustion and nausea was caused by and wow -”
Andromeda laughs fondly, bending low to brush a kiss against her grandson’s cheek before gently nudging him towards the stairs. “Go on, Grandma will see you on Monday okay? Be a good boy for your Uncles and don’t forget to brush before bed.”
“As the rain,” Harry quips, fighting back the urge to cheer. He’s glad he didn’t think this through, he feels
Hours later Harry finds himself seated across from Dave in a cosy family run restaurant. It’s a quaint little place with only six tables, the wooden tables worn and softened by years of use. Bright holiday decorations cover the walls, the servers dressed in festive hats. Even the brick fireplace they managed to snag a table by has a tasteful garland draped across it.
Lol. I ended up writing a much longer chapter. Though, yes, chapters might get shorter now because I do need to start writing my college essays. They're due first week of Jan and I've put it off long enough.
Draco rolls his eyes, offering Harry a glass of wine. “I’m not sure Emma would have ever forgiven me if I hadn’t.”
Based on the picture prompt within the story. Still not beta-read. Still written for the "25 days of Harry and Draco challenge" at Slythindor100.
It’s a good thing that Harry has always been a little stubborn because winning over a five year old is one of the toughest things Harry’s experienced.
They’re not friends. They’re barely acquaintances. Granted, they’re acquaintances that drink together every week and also always sit next to each other at the bar and Harry still doesn’t know how Malfoy has better alcohol tolerance than him but
He can only stare from his spot in front of his door as Malfoy walks around his living room, the wide windows giving Harry a glimpse into the room. Malfoy is smiling, his sleeves rolled up his arms as he carries a mug to a spot across the room, too far away for Harry to see. He’s ready to give up and chalk it off to a tiring day at the Ministy and his mind playing tricks when Malfoy walks back in front of the windows, heading towards what’s presumably the kitchen if their houses are planned the same way.
Out of the corner of his eyes, Harry can see Molly sniff out, Hermione too is reaching for her handkerchief. His sole attention, though, is fixed on a pair of steely, grey eyes, the love and adoration in them keeping him grounded.
All apprehensions vanish as he steps into the living room. Draco has spread blankets on the floor, so that they can spread out comfortably directly in front of the fire. There are pillows piled against the sofa so that they recline while facing the fire, a red chenille throw folded at the foot of the blanket nest.
“Oh,” Draco said, momentarily speechless before years of having manners drilled into him paid off. “You’re welcome.”
Later, when Harry wakes, Draco passes him a cup of tea and asks, “Don’t you think it’s time to put your house on rent?”
At Draco’s door they swap their weight, Scorpius blinking blearily up at Harry before falling asleep again, while Loki merely snuffles and settles his nose into the crook of Harry’s elbow.
His bubble of happiness bursts when he hears Blaise say, “Ten Galleons he doesn’t even dance with anybody else.”
Draco watches as the guests raise their glass to him and drink, Hermione shooting him a pleased smile. The easy manner in which she dispenses affection towards him is still something Draco is getting used to, the awkward conversations with Weasley more comforting in their familiarity.
The glint of the sunlight across the corner of his eyes makes Harry look away from Draco for a second and he catches sight of the ever-present camera placed on Draco's side of the bed.
“That’s a matter of perspective, Malfoy.” Harry is struck by the amount of self loathing in Malfoy’s eyes, the wry humor that he twists to mock himself. “And of course the Wizengamot saw something in you too, it doesn’t matter how persuasive Kingsley was, they can be quite forceful when they want to be.”
struggling to find another word here, but the fact is that Malfoy looks adorable. His eyes are scrunched against the weak light, one fist coming up to rub out the sleep, the usually well slicked hair is messy and falling all over his face.
Draco shuffled the larger pile of parchment towards Harry, ignoring the affronted expression thrown his way. He leaned back against the sofa, lazily waving his wand to start piling the cushions against the wall. It was as he was staring at the growing pile with concern,
He doesn’t think he’ll ever get tired of the look on Draco’s face each time Harry says those words. Though he could do without the hint of awe lurking behind all the affection, like Draco still can’t believe that Harry would say those words to him.
With great difficulty Harry shakes his head, holding onto Draco slim waist with both hands. He would love nothing more than to go in, show Draco the depth of what he already feels for him but beneath the haze of lust clouding Draco’s eyes, Harry can catch a hint a nervousness, a bite of apprehension that tells him that maybe Draco isn’t ready.
Draco and Blaise take up spots next to her. Draco knows Blaise is already scoping out the crowd, looking for his target for the night. Pansy nudges them as the drinks arrive.
He walks closer, taking in the faint shimmer of magic in the air around it. A Stasis Charm, Draco realises, feeling it brush over him as he reaches for the door.
Harry sniff, prompting Draco to envelope him in a hug again, holding on tight till he can hear Harry breathing normally again.
With a laugh, Draco spins around in Harry’s hold and hooks his arms around Harry’s neck. Even with the confetti in his dishevelled hair and flushed cheeks Harry looks breath-taking and Draco wants to climb into the DJ box and shout out to the world that Harry is his.
Harry shoots him a grateful smile, he really is exhausted, and starts retelling the story of the time when Ron, Hermione and  he stole a dragon from Gringotts.
Draco feels a pang of hurt, whether at himself for not being here to see Harry grow into this version of himself or at Harry for not staying the way Draco left him, he’s not sure.
He takes a deep breath, as if steeling himself, before looking at Harry and saying, in a voice filled with hurt, “Scorpius won’t be going to Hogwarts.”
He can think back to the exact moment when he decided to ignore his responsibilities and throw his parents to the mercy of that mad man.
“Yeah,” Harry says, laughing, “Neville should really know better than to accept any sort of food item from George. And Ron probably wasn’t even paying attention to what he was eating.”
A minute before the fire can consume them, Draco Malfoy is ready to give up, he can’t move, can’t see, feel, breathe anything other than the fire.
He smiles then, soft and filled with warmth, a stark contrast to the look of despair a few moments ago.
“Grimmauld Place,” he called, impatiently tapping his fingers on the grate. The Floo chimed, once, twice before dying out.
Working with Emma is challenging, her sharp wit and extensive knowledge in the subject making her an excellent sounding board for Draco’s ideas. She knows exactly when to push and the right questions to ask when they brainstorm.
Draco rushed in right after, carefully placing all the pots in his arms on one of the window ledges. He shook his arms out, a wave of sharp pain ran up and down due to the combined weight of all the heavy pots.
It was also more hours alone than Draco was prepared for. A month ago, when Harry and he had been making plans to spend their days relaxing by the small pond on the Manor grounds, Draco had been
With a packet of crisps in hand, Harry walks around his house; it feels weird saying that, his house because it still doesn’t feel a lot like it’s his. He steps out the back, taking in the little shed near the back wall, a surprising find that he’s still not sure what he can use for, and the sad state of his back garden, now half covered in snow.
“I never used to believe in luck, words like destiny and fate held no meaning for me, and yet, when I look back to where I was three years ago, to the day, and were I am today, I can’t help but start to believe in some higher power. I can’t find any other possible explanation for the turn my life took, for the family I have today.”
Draco trips over a pair of Harry’s shoes, he can spot Harry’s clothes hanging in the closet and the pyjamas he’s wearing aren’t his. He expected this to feel more momentous, some sort of sign accompanying his life going from just revolving around Scorpius to also including Harry and Loki but at this moment, standing in Harry’s too-big pyjamas at the door to his bedroom, all Draco can feel is contentment.
I wait until he settles down before letting out the breath I was holding. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say he was awake and was doing this to rile me up. But Draco sleeps like the dead and nothing short of a full marching band can wake him when he’s like this.
Malfoy blinks, his expression stunned as he stares at Harry. Harry, for his part, tries not to smile in glee at how he managed to surprise Malfoy.
He sighed, getting started on clearing out the easier things. He was only halfway through sorting out the parchments strewn about the window ledge he’d commandeered for his N.E.W.T. studies when Harry finally walked in.
“Hi.” Harry smiles up at Draco, their faces close enough that he can feel Draco’s warm breath on his lips.
He couldn’t pinpoint when or how, but the early mornings became his favourite part of the day. He couldn't remember the last time he found comfort in any time of day other than the deepest part of the night. Yet, without fail, he looked forward to dawn when he could start making his way down the stairs.
“Thanks! I’m glad you suggested the park, had we decided on a place further away I would have been in real trouble,” Harry chuckles.
The unrestrained joy on Teddy’s face and the sturdy warmth across his back from Harry’s chest is worth facing the early morning. They are, after all, his favourite parts of the day.
“So, expect to see me tomorrow!” Potter smiled, obviously attempting to go for cheerful optimism, but he only came across as slightly unhinged. “Some days tiring myself out does help, so it’s my best bet for now.”
He has given up on asking Draco to dinner, aware that the atmosphere is too tense, Draco’s too fragile right now. But as he’s putting on his coat, Draco stops him.
He beckons him closer, waiting till Teddy is squatting next to him to carefully place a little soil in his tiny palm.
I run the fingers of one hand along his cleft and rake my nails down his thigh with the other. His hole twitches every time I pass my fingers over it and I’m at the end of my restraint. My prick throbs as I move against the bed, hoping to relieve the tension enough that I focus all my attention on Draco.
Draco smirks, blinking up at Harry from where he's leaning on Harry's chest. "I hope you're not getting any ideas, I have to head back to the Manor in a bit,"
“No Madam Pomfrey,” Potter repeated, almost leaning against Draco now, “‘m fine, I just need to sleep.”
He watched suspiciously as Potter smiled, nodding to himself once before carefully placing the cauldron on the floor between them.
His otherwise suave exit is somewhat disrupted by him almost tripping over a display case. He manages to right himself at the last minute, the sound of Draco's laugh lingering in the air.
Draco smiles. "I wish I had had time to wrap it up all pretty in a bow." He gives the top of the box a pitiful nudge. Harry pulls the box away from him, holding it protectively on his lap and giving Draco a mock glare.
By the time Draco’s on his fifth shot, he’s leaning against the counter, a glass of some cocktail in his hand. The music is hypnotic, he can feel his body swaying along to the beat and Draco lets go. He’s had a long, tiring week and he deserves to let loose now.
Harry’s coat is off now, his shoulders lined with confetti that casts bright shadows on his face when the light hits just right. Draco takes another drink and manoeuvres the bottle so that he can tug off his coat. Throwing his tie off at the same time, Draco stops where he is. Harry’s got his tie off as well, making Draco lick his lips as the flashing lights highlight his collarbones, making Draco want to bite and leave his mark.
“It’s just,” Draco tries to explain, voice muffled as he presses his face into Harry’s chest, in dire need of hugs, “he’s growing up so fast.”
His analysis of the potions sample Emma sent him is enough to help him narrow down the possible culprits to four standard ingredients—hellebore, valerian root, lavender and porcupine quills.
The two house-elves hanging around his periphery added to his discomfort. He knew them, had grown up seeing them around the Manor, but the thought of them relying on him for directions and order as the Malfoy Heir was more than he could handle right then.
“Is that so,” Harry says, bending to pick up snow. He can see Malfoy doing the same across from him and there’s a strange joy in being so carefree, in seeing Malfoy laugh uninhibitedly.
Draco bites back a gasp of recognition, realising just who the child is. Teddy Lupin, his aunt’s grandchild. Looking at Teddy now he feels deep sorrow settle in him at what the child has lost already. His mother had acted like she was fine when she had been informed of her sister’s passing but Draco knew better.
Draco laughs then, making Harry turn to look at him. The fetching blush on his cheeks is very distracting but Harry is focussed on his eyes, his gaze burning as he stares at Harry.
with his tongue and Harry can actually feel his knees go a little weak, he decides to leave it to Draco to stop and let’s himself get lost in the moment.
Discussing homework questions once in a while soon turned into having full-blown conversations about everything and nothing. From song choices to who would sleep on the sofa—Potter, the gentlemen, forcing Draco to take it most days while he crashed on the carpet—they could talk about anything. While Draco was a little apprehensive about arguing with Potter and scaring him off, having gotten used to his presence, he was assured when, the night after a heated conversation about the right way to trim one's broomstick, Potter was back. Though he did bring with him a considerable pile of broom care books to prove his point, at least he was back.
He sat there, stunned, once he was done. The letter lay open in front of him as he went over the words again. His first instinct was to share the news with Harry.
Draco sounds like he’s reading out from a script, voice carefully devoid of emotion. It makes Harry shift uneasily in his seat, aware that he’s touched upon something a lot deeper.
Rather than trudging around the Manor grounds, he pulls out the old house blueprints. Grabbing his second cup of tea for the day, he leans over the massive scroll, squinting at some of the smaller writing along the grounds. The original layout of the Manor and its property is pretty much the same as the day it was constructed; the only things that have been added are the ridiculously ornate statues and fountains by his great-grandmother.
“Potter,” Malfoy says, nudging Scorpius forward when he looks back for permission. “I assume that’s why you were in a hurry earlier?”
“Hey,” Harry says firmly, waiting till Scorpius is looking at him. “If you’re angry about something, use your words, we don’t go around throwing things in this house. Is that clear?”
“No, I don’t and I’ll prove it to you. I’m going home with someone else tonight because that’s what you do with fuck buddies.”
Draco wearily climbs up the stairs. It has taken him an hour to clear up the mess in the living room. It feels like the exhaustion has seeped into his bones, making each step a fight. He doesn’t remember feeling this tired ever before and just the thought of having to go through this for another week makes him want to curl up somewhere and just
Harry sighs as he steps out of the Floo, ash falling around him as he shrugs off his outer robes. He’s too tired to be bothered with cleaning up right now, the ache of spending over eight hours on a stakeout beginning to take its toll. All he wants is a bath, hopefully he can convince his husband to give him one of those magical massages that make all stress and aches disappear. He’s just dropped his satchel by the coat stand when he hears a soft giggle, followed by his husband’s deep voice.
Harry snorts, biting back the appreciative moan at the delicious smells wafting from the kitchen. It smells heavenly, and he tells Draco so, his chin on Draco’s shoulder, watching him stir the sauce bubbling on the stove.
As Hermione and Harry wait for Ron to pay bill, Hermione turns to Harry and with a smirk, asks, “How’s Draco?”
Everly holds the door open for Draco, inviting him in with a smile. The office itself, in typical Ministry fashion, is a lot larger on the inside than it appears on the outside. There are two corridors that branch off from the main entrance, three doors running down each. At the end of the first corridor is what appears to be a glass conference room, Draco can spot three people seated inside.
I start from the top of his bollocks and lick all the way up his crack. He tastes like sweat and my come.
Two years in at the place where it started, Harry enters the club with his head held high and eyes already seeking the form he knows as well as his own body. Hot, sweaty, loud,
“Potter?” Malfoy whispers, voice weakened by sleep and he looks so young and vulnerable, like the boy that had to grow up too fast.
Hermione stares at Harry mournfully, depending on Harry to steer them through the crowded street. He gives up with chuckle, Hermione pulls him into a hug and smiles, relieved.
Harry, on the other hand, blinks, stunned. They haven’t really defined their relationship, honestly, Harry hasn’t felt the need to.
When all he gets is an arched brow in return, Harry wonders if he's managed to royally fuck up just a day before one of the most important days of his life.
Harry sits by his side and leans down to kiss his forehead, lingering for a few seconds just to breathe.
Feeling inordinately pleased with himself, Harry leans to his left, letting Neville take his weight as he watches Malfoy fiddle with his camera. His fingers are careful and confident in the way he handles the device, swiftly plucking the film from the end and storing it in his pocket. Harry frowns.
Harry catches up to him, taking a minute to catch his breath. He looks flushed, no longer in the robes he was wearing. He’s wearing a blue tie with the knot off centre over a slightly wrinkled blue shirt tucked into smart, grey trousers.
Harry had reassured him that his friends were unaware of the existence of the room and trusted Harry when he said he was okay. He said they only cared that he was doing fine and looking healthier than he had in months.
“Undress and step in, I’ll try to whip up something warm for you,” Harry orders, stepping out to give Malfoy a modicum of privacy.
Harry wakes with a crick in his neck and the feeling of pins and needles in his left arm. He blinks blearily, the fire is no longer roaring but the residual heat is keeping the room warm, the muted light from the embers making it easier for him to adjust.
“Do you think it’s too soon?” Draco cuts him off, “I know it’s sudden and we didn’t plan for it but - “
The house feels oddly empty with the Scorpius’s laughter and the never ending conversations he carries out with Loki. Harry smiles as he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, Scorpius had looked so proud when he had presented Draco with the cookies he had helped decorate. The icing was sloppy in places, the sprinkles too abundant and yet Draco declared them to be the best looking cookies in the entire world.
“I’m sure we can progress from last names now,” Harry suggests, crossing his fingers under the table. “Besides, isn’t it confusing for Scorpius?”
They will talk tomorrow morning, decide to discuss things before they are left to fester for too long and give birth to resentment but for now, they know, without shadow of a doubt, that they will always come back home, to each other.
“Yeah, there was a department meeting that ran late.” Harry sighs. “Madeline usually attends those but she’s taking time off this week, so I had the pleasure of listening to the head of the Auror Trainee Program complain about budget cuts.”
Even as he read up on the properties of the Invisibility Potion he found his mind drifting to the lone figure running around the lake, the fog following in his path.
Had it been even a minute later Draco would have been fast asleep. As it is, he’s just barely awake enough to hear what Harry whispers against the back of his neck.
Harry nods distractedly, eyes fixed on Draco who is looking at him calmly but Harry can spot the tension in his posture. Harry reaches across the table to hold Draco’s hand and squeezes it, giving him a soft smile as he watches Draco look him over.
Harry is glad he didn’t have the cup of tea in his hand then, he is sure he would have dropped it had that been the case. He knows wizards can get pregnant, the baby shower he had attended for Seamus and Dean’s son was enough proof of that, but the fact that Malfoy carried Scorpius had never even occurred to him.
Harry stumbles and almost falls. They’ve been walking for an hour, relying on their wands to direct them towards the camp. He smirks  at the sound of Malfoy chuckling. It takes just a flick, before perfectly formed snow balls are targeting the Slytherin, making him whine and curse Harry.
“We as in you and your son?” Harry asks, curious about Scorpius, he’s been here for over an hour and yet has seen no sign of the little boy.
“Oh,” Draco breathes out, his eyes dazed as he tries to find the source of the interruption. Before Harry can point Draco in the right direction, or kiss him again because he looks sinful with his kiss swollen lips and flushed cheeks, Scorpus runs in with Loki right behind him.
Even Longbottom had managed to offer up a nod, more than he’d allowed Draco since the first time they’d come across each other in the greenhouses.
But just because he can’t taste doesn’t mean he can’t tempt; at least till his man arrives. So Draco ups the ante, taking another deep swig, making sure to tilt his head back so that his neck is visible; his Adams apple bobbing as he swallows the drink. The music is picking up, the beat getting faster as the night wears on, couples getting more risqué as the level of inebriation in the club rises. Draco keeps dancing while avoiding lingering hands. It’s about an hour after Draco had arrived that he comes in.
After moaning, cursing and crying about it Harry finds himself trekking through an unknown forest with a stoic Malfoy by his side, who only opens his mouth to lament about the state of his shoes and his disregard for this entire exercise.
Frowning at the lack of response, he peeks into the kitchen at the family clock that was a wedding gift from the Weasleys. The glossy black clock hand with Harry’s name on it is pointing firmly at
“I still have four days,” he complained, rolling over and propping his head up on one arm. “Say, Draco, what are you doing after graduation?”
Harry’s lost in thought, imagining a little Malfoy in the kitchen with house elves, it’s a surprisingly adorable image. He’s brought back to reality when Malfoy waves a hand in front of his face.
Teddy beams, eagerly digging in as Draco measures the maple syrup and mascarpone. A chubby hand holding onto a piece of strawberry pops into his line of vision; he turns to see Teddy holding it out for him.
“Well,” Emma breaks the silence, smiling at Draco affectionately. “You aren’t getting rid of me that fast.”
As his gaze once again drifted over to Potter, he allowed himself to stare. The “Potter” in his head, the impression he’d built over the years from that very first moment on the Hogwarts Express to the image of him speaking on Draco’s behalf in front of the entire Wizengamot, seemed to pale in comparison to the real person sleeping across the room.
“Where is she these days?” Harry asks, helping himself to a chocolate frog when Scorpius offers. He almost gives in when Scorpius asks if Loki can also have one, but one look at Draco’s expression and Harry shakes his head.
