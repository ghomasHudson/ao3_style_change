He grinned at his reflection and rounded on Ron. "I would hope so," he smirked and pushed his friend to the door. It was time to go to breakfast and let his plan unfold.
"Shush, Blaise. Let him tell us the story," Pansy chastised. "You taunted him all these years because of your secret feelings for him, right?"
But then Ron sighed in surrender, "Well, I guess I'll have to get used to it then." He looked pungently at Harry. "As long as you don't fancy Malfoy or anything like that," he scowled.
He would think about it, would talk about it, and would completely vanish it from his brain. He sincerely hoped that the writer would have mercy on him and not send him something again.
"Only a friend, Nev?" Zabini asked curiously, pulling Neville closer by slinging his arm around the Gryffindors shoulder.
When they were alone Hermione rounded on him and asked him straight out. "You like Malfoy and don't deny it, Harry. I can read you like an open book and you know that. I can't even fathom why you tried lying to me," she admonished exasperated and propped her fists into her hips.
, fell on deaf ears as he spun on his heel, robe billowing behind him in a manner that would have made his godfather proud, and stormed away.
"No, I didn't mean it like that. I just thought, if I had to choose someone, it would have been him," Harry explained, feeling really bad. He had never liked Cedric that way and now using him like this, it felt wrong. In general, this whole conversation felt utterly wrong to him, and instead of it getting any better he had only managed to get himself buried, deeper, and deeper into this shit.
"Erm, … up to new adventures?” he supplied forced cheerfully and took another spoonful, chewing pensively. His face involuntarily cringed again.
Then she said, "Maybe I shouldn’t remove it.” Grinning at him, she wiggled her eyebrows and Draco finally closed his open-hanging mouth.
Harry nodded solemnly and watched Blaise go before turning to Draco. "You know that I didn’t mean any of what I said to Ron. You don’t know how much I regretted it the moment it fell out of my mouth. It’s been driving me insane, Draco. I’m so sorry for hurting you in that way and I swear I will never deny you again. We belong together and if you take me back, I’ll make sure everyone knows it."
Headmistress McGonagall had warned the students after that, that she wouldn’t tolerate any of this nonsense and would take tough actions should something like that happen again. But Malfoy’s exit told him that her warning had gone unheard to some people. Harry contemplated if he should have a talk with her and alerted her to the incident but wasn’t too sure that it had been one. For the most part, the Slytherin hadn’t seemed harmed, only startled and kind of embarrassed. Okay, a freaking lot of embarrassment given the almost glowing red color that had graced his skin up to his ears.
Draco huffed in annoyance, "I’m not a girl, so remove it.” He gritted his teeth, "Please.”
Ginny didn't notice the approaching Slytherin and continued to talk to Harry, whom she had dragged down here against his will. "Harry, I know that you haven't been feeling well for the past few weeks. Anyone can tell just by looking at you. I can't go on seeing you like this Harry and stand by doing nothing. Besides, it surprises me since you seemed quite balanced after we returned to Hogwarts this year. What happened that has made you are so beside yourself? You can talk to me," she spoke calmly.
Harry flinched at Ron's bellowing and something hard twisted in his guts. Harry knew Ron still hated Draco. He couldn't do this right now. But what he was about to do, also wasn't something he ever wanted to do. But stupidly he did it anyway, just to avoid Ron's outrage turning on him and going overboard.
Harry watched with broken eyes as Zabini kept touching Draco subtly, tucking a curl of his soft blond hair behind his ear and winking at him teasingly.
Grinning, Pansy smoothed out the paper and began reading, holding it so that Hermione could also take a look as she scooted closer.
"Bloody hell,” Ron breathed with air rushing out of his lungs as he fell back against the backrest of his chair, breaking the spell that seemed to have hit them. His face was ashen and his eyes were so wide that the blue of them seemed to swallow his face.
"Harry! Look! Pansy did another beautiful artwork,” she exclaimed and looked smiling at the raven-haired boy who had appeared behind Draco.
"Yes, that boy always needs a good push in the right direction." He smiled back at her and closed his eyes to take a well-deserved nap.
For the last week, he had been puzzling over a plan for how to combine the two. He had written letters to dispel his fears and had already received positive answers. Most of all, he was happy that Molly and Arthur had no problem with the fact that he was gay. After all, their second-oldest Charlie was gay too, which Harry hadn't even been aware of until then, and so this fear had fizzled out.
Potter looked worried back, stretching a hand out to his and the sodding parchment. All of a sudden Draco squeaked and shot out of his seat, breakfast forgotten and rushed out of the hall on a limp. Embarrassment burned his whole body up and let him glow like a fucking inferno. He needed to get as far away from Potter as possible. His heart hammered in his chest as if it tried to find a way out of it and his stomach felt as ill as if an angry hornets’ nest was dropped in there.
Greenhouse four, they were currently in, was a tropical hell. The humidity was so thick that even the glass which separated the colorful plants from the outside world seemed to sweat. Most students had upon arriving thrown off their robes and jumpers and groaned as Professor Sprout presented them with Solem Inflamaris that they had to replant. The sodding plant with its dark green leaves sprouted small yellow glowing balls of sun fire as fruits, they were inedible, but when put in certain potions could warm up the body for hours on end. The heat they released in small puffs once in a while wasn’t harmful, only when one of the baubles would burst open it could leave huge damage because the little flames would grow like wildfire.
Neville seemed to be the only one who was completely enthusiastic about the rare plants. At the moment he was talking to Zabini like a machine gun while he made a large hollow in the soil of their pot.
With a swift move, he removed the cock ring from his boyfriends dripping parts and snapped his hips one last time forward in an almost brutal jerk.
"Can you believe them? That wasn't deliberately from Draco, he just did it naturally. I have never seen him quite like this and I dated him shortly in fourth year, mind you," Pansy exclaimed, smitten with her boy.
"Okay, thanks and I think you two shouldn't try again to talk to him. I have the feeling it went more downhill after your last attempt," Harry said, nodded at them, and left the Great Hall without them.
He wanted more; He wanted to touch and kiss him whenever he pleased. He truly was in love with Harry. If someone had told him two years ago that he and the Golden Boy would be dating, he would have laughed in their face. He never thought that they could possibly be a couple, let alone stay together this long without killing each other.
Ron deflated and puffed out a sigh of relief that he wasn't losing his friend to the git. Hermione rolled her eyes at the ginger-haired boy. "So, you've been meeting up with your crush then? I've noticed that you have been sneaking around and thought that maybe you were stalking Draco Malfoy again as you did in the sixth year," she said. "Hermione, why'd you have to bring that up?" Ron sighed at his girlfriend.
Draco screamed Harry’s name as he was pushed over the edge and spilled his seed in long ribbons over the bed sheets. Harry's hot cum flooded his twitching channel as his boyfriend came with a growling howl.
He was pleasantly surprised that he found in Hermione of all people someone who could proceed and share his fascination with ancient runes. They got on like a house on fire, given that she was as well educated in other subjects like him.
Placing the shiny glass bottle beside his right knee, he pushed his arse over Draco's half-hard cock, making both of them moan, and fumbled with the Slytherin's belt buckle.
Ginny stared at the boy she had loved since childhood as if struck by lightning. "You're gay?" she croaked out, her voice taking on a higher pitch than normal.
"I think that's Harry's business," replied Ron, gesturing to her to help him plant the two-meter monstrosity of a plant.
Pansy smirked, while she held the plant at its bottom and Weasley carefully gripped it at its stem. "Do you think Potter has the hots for Draco?" she asked straight out, making Ron almost fall backward when he stumbled over his own feet.
Sitting down in a chair near the window, Harry looked around in the Three Broomsticks. He noticed that Madam Rosmertay glared at Malfoy‘s back before she gave Harry a half-smile. He made out Dean and Seamus who sat behind the stairs who led upstairs, talking eagerly to each other while their heads were bowed over a magazine. A few third years awed over the taste of butterbeer and all in all it was a cozy atmosphere in the taproom.
When Draco didn't respond anymore, too flabbergasted by the revelation of his one knowing and one not-caring friend, Pansy took the conversation in her own desired direction.
Hermine looked at Draco’s nails and gasped. "Oh, she did a wonderful job. I like her artistic style,” she beamed and intensely watched as the pattern changed.
"Come, Harry, we've got better things to do." With that, she grabbed Harry‘s arm and guided him out of the Great Hall.
The silence around the table was almost tangible but then both boys broke into a laugh when they witnessed the bewildered looks on their friends' faces. It got so far that even Ron grinned and let out a loud
He wearily took the scroll, unrolled it, and scanned the bottom of the parchment. It had no sender name but the script was neat and completely unfamiliar to him. Slowly he began to read.
Draco yelped in surprise, his back coming off the mattress. Harry chuckled again as he soothingly circled the abused nubs with his thumbs.
He had explained everything. How it came about that he had talked so badly about Draco. Why he did it and what he felt about it. That he had felt torn, that he immediately regretted it when it had slipped past his lips. The moment he realized that Draco had heard everything; he wanted to take back every single word, even more so. His heart ached over what Draco must have felt at hearing those words. That Draco was everything for him. That he loved Draco from the bottom of his heart and would apologize for the rest of his life if it meant Draco would forgive him and take him back.
Blaise smirked and raised both of his eyebrows, "Draco Malfoy offering an apology? And tomorrow it will rain Blast-Ended Skrewts."
Up in the Gryffindor tower another boy, this one raven-haired, woke up with a heart-wrenching cry. The last of his dream haunting him.
He muttered out a listening charm, so he could overhear what they were talking about. Draco’s hushed voice sounded upset as he talked urgently to his dark-skinned friend, "
"What is Potter doing?"
"Draco," he screamed as he saw the blond Slytherin’s back from afar. "Draco, please wait!" Harry pleaded, running even faster to get to his beloved.
Harry checked himself in the mirror again. His wild hair was tamed into a deliberately tousled look; his glasses were sparkling clean and actually sat straight on his nose. He had freshly shaved and applied aftershave. His clothing consisted of a black silk shirt, the green vest that favorably accentuated his broad shoulders and slim waist. A black leather belt with a snake as a buckle was pulled through the belt loops of his black trousers and the whole thing was rounded off with new black sneakers.
"She did mine, too.” Potter grinned and waggled his dark-blue painted fingers.
"Hey! I’m right here Potter.” Pansy scowled but her eyes had an amused twinkle as she took in Harry’s ruffled look. His cheeks were burning bright pink and his green eyes shot daggers at Hermione but not only in a warning. He seemed amused himself to a certain degree, which only made Pansy more curious about what was written in the mail.
He was just about to take a sip from his tea when a brown barn owl swept down and threw a scroll into his lap. Draco flinched and looked anxiously down. He had got enough hate mail in the last weeks since he was back at school, some coming with curses when being touched.
"But he looked so miserable," he whispered while looking longingly at the door.
"Hm, if you say so. But I think you could try it," Blaise said from the door, waiting for the blond.
"HA! Knew it!" exclaimed Pansy gleefully, slapping her thighs. "Pay up," she said as she turned to Blaise.
"Erm, ... since first year, I guess. I don't know, Hermione. He always got to me, no matter what he did, but somehow I found myself always thinking of him and watching him. I like it when he smiles and he can be pretty funny if he wants to be. Sure he was a cocky rude prat, but he's so attractive, I just… I couldn't help falling for him...," Harry shrugged helplessly.
"Harry ... please!" Draco whined breathlessly. His body was strung so tight he felt like bursting on the spot.
"Don’t you want to open it, Harry," Pansy asked, slipping naturally into using his first name and pointed to the sodding paper with a greasy chip.
"Oh Ron," Hermione exclaimed and threw herself over the table, hugging her boyfriend tightly. "I’m so glad you came around. So much happened and I was sad that I couldn't talk to you about it."
He still felt uncomfortable knowing that someone wrote those things about him and Potter but it was like Potter had said, if someone else was in the limelight it was almost funny seeing their reactions.
Draco's hand instantly flew to his neck.
"That was …Oh by Salazar‘s pink knickers! So HOT!" Pansy wheezed between loud barks of laughter, while Hermione had her red face buried in her hands and was giggling like mad.
Draco ran down the dark hallways of the dungeons. His thoughts were with Harry and the pain that he felt deep in his chest when he thought back to how the Weaslette had hugged his Gryffindor. It was almost the same as the pain he had felt when Hagrid came in carrying Harry's body, believed dead, into the schoolyard during the battle.
So, Harry had formed a plan, with Hermione, and to his surprise with Ron who casually threw partly helpful comments in between.
Okay, fine. He was confused as hell even if he had denied it before. His encounter with Malfoy had been sort of an eye-opener and at the same time, it let him recoil. Not in disgust, which was another thing he needed to think of, it was more like he didn’t know what to do, what to feel, and certainly didn’t know what to think about it. He couldn’t even fathom where all this suddenly came from. And he noticed by Ron’s horror-stricken face that he had confided in the wrong person. Maybe Hermione would’ve been a better choice.
A goofy grin spread suddenly over Harry's lips, "Yes, your highness," he said, bowing to the Slytherin with a mockingly raised eyebrow.
"Fuck old friendships. I don’t need you!” Draco screamed and tried to buck up to get Blaise off him. "Don’t be so mean darling. It’s all done anyway,” Pansy cooed and placed a wet kiss on his cheek. "To a rekindled friendship,” Pansy grinned and Blaise finally stood up, pulling Draco with him. "Oh, that looks awesome, Pans. Do mine next. In dark green, I think.” He smirked and winked at the fuming blond as Pansy squealed in delight and hugged him.
He thought he had seen red hair wafting up in the wind and once he was up closer he found it confirmed when he saw the back of the Weaslette as she leaned against the bottom part of Hagrid's home.
"With this ring, let it be known I choose you. I promise to love you and care for you for all eternity. Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you marry me?"
"Draco, I know in the past I've hurt you, I am truly sorry for that. But as I stand here before you, heart pounding, I'm lost for the right words to say. When I look into your beautiful mercury eyes, I see all of the reasons I fell in love with you. It makes me remember every laugh we've ever shared, all the hard times we made it through together, and every beautiful moment there was and will be. How you complete me, without you I am not whole. Draco, I give you my heart, my soul, my everything. I promise to love you, protect you. I will be by your side forever, if you will have me, I will cherish every moment we have together for the rest of our lives," Harry said with absolute honesty in his voice. Everyone who was present in the great hall had to recognize that potter was completely serious.
Draco punched his regained friend in the shoulder. "Don't get used to it," he laughed and suddenly felt better than he had for a long time.
But Harry didn't feel like eating. He just waited until everyone had food on their plates. His gaze slid over the Slytherin table. It will be soon. In a moment he would go over to Draco and personally give him his present.
Harry was flustered, Ron’s reaction had gotten badly to him and he had already openly dissed his boyfriend. Without thinking he called out the first name that came to mind, just so he could get it over with. "Cedric," Harry said, looking down, thinking 'No, no, no!' the whole time, it just felt wrong, so very wrong.
"Tell me, is Zabini into boys or girls?" Ron asked Pansy casually, mixing dragon manure under the earth. "Hm?" made Pansy absently, having just checked her book for Advanced Herbology. But now she looked up and her gaze slid from Zabini to Neville and a shrewd expression came into her eyes. "Oh, are you jealous, Weasley?" she giggled and thrust her elbow into Ron's ribs.
Hermione's eyes grew wide, then she snorted, "So, that's where you have been sneaking off to lately. I should have known." She sighed, "I only hope that he won’t hear about those things you said about him. There would be hell to pay if he ever finds out you dissed him, especially in front of us, just because Ron's behaviour got to you. I know you don't want to lose Ron because of this. But Harry, if Ron ditches you because you simply fell in love with Draco Malfoy, he isn't a good friend and you know this already, he wouldn't do that. Surely, he will be pissed off, but eventually, he will come around. You're like a brother to him." She looked at him worriedly. "I hope this all works out for you Harry. You deserve to be happy," she said while smiling at him softly.
I don't want to push them, or lose them." He looked at Draco nervously, "Uhm, would it be okay for you if we take it slow? I would feel my way around and tell them first that I'm gay and then see how they react before I tell them about you. Would that be possible for you?" Harry looked at him pleadingly with his big green eyes and Draco gave in. He couldn't refuse Harry anything when he looked at him like that.
"Harry... fine. Yes, you were an idiot, an extraordinary idiot, but I won't tell Ron a thing. It is your decision to tell him, but I do want to know, since when did you realize you had feelings for Draco other than hate," Hermine asked curiously once again.
Blaise blinked at him in surprise and Pansy's grin widened, revealing all her teeth.
Draco's cheeks had pinked and he looked rather elsewhere than at Harry. He seemed shaken up by his own doing and swiftly pulled on his other glove. Harry bit his lip. He felt partly embarrassed but another part of him had deeply enjoyed Draco's attention. He smeared the tincture on his blisters and put his dragonhide gloves on.
Blaise got up too. "Make that a date. I also want to know how the Golden Boy snatched up my best friend," he winked at Draco, making him blush yet again before the three eventually decided to go to their lessons.
It had made Draco nervous and since Harry hadn't taken his eyes off him anymore, his nerves had been tense. He still had needed to fix the Vanishing Cabinet without anyone noticing, Severus had been breathing down his neck and Harry's penetrating gaze had been too much for him. Draco hadn't known what to do then, so he had snapped, without wanting to.
But it never came to that, as Professor McGonagall suddenly stood in front of him as if she had grown out of the ground and grabbed his still invisible shoulder. "I think you are on the wrong floor, Mr. Potter. If you would come with me, I have something to tell you," she whispered to him so as not to attract the attention of the two Slytherins.
Draco had been sitting in the mostly abandoned alcove, looking over the Black Lake while trying to make plans for their anniversary tonight. He had wanted to surprise Harry. He had hidden further into the alcove when he heard footsteps approach, wishing not to be seen since some of the students weren't kind to him. Given that he had the Dark Mark and everyone thought he got it willingly, it was to no surprise to him that they were angry, that he had been allowed back to school. But they were wrong. He only got the Dark Mark because he wanted to protect his parents, there wasn't another reason. In some of the group sessions, the students had with a mind healer, he had said so and some of his fellow students, mostly the younger ones, understood the need to protect what was dearest to you. But still, he didn't want to be disturbed at the moment and sat quietly, waiting for the footsteps to pass.
"Well, not who he is, no. But I liked him since the first year ... well, I grew into liking him and well ...," Harry said bashfully, going red-faced. He wasn't used to speaking about his feelings and shipping around the Erumpent of his infatuation wasn't bettering the situation.
Harry watched Malfoy limp out of the Great Hall in a rush and carded his fingers through his unruly hair. What had happened that Malfoy had his knickers in a twist? He knew that the Slytherin was victim to hexes and curses, some going so far to infuse parchment with potions that caused nasty burns over the skin when touched. He had witnessed this on the third day back and was livid with the senders who couldn’t wrap their heads around the fact that the war was over and done with. He even had had a fit right here last week, when Malfoy collapsed during dinner, hexed by a sixth-year student while eating.
Draco visibly deflated but nodded at what the dark-skinned Slytherin said to him and all three of them glared at Harry over the house tables.
A voice supplied with a smirking touch in his brain, letting Harry violently shake his head.
"That my dear Darling is the hottest shit I ever read, even better as the one of those two,” Pansy answered delighted while pointing her thumb between Harry and Draco.
His friends were too good at heart and he knew that he also needed to come around if he wanted to stay their friend.
Harry didn't eat anymore; he paid less and less attention in class and had argued with Hermione about it. Ron sat helplessly in the face of the whole spectacle; Harry didn't want to take any advice from him on the subject of Draco. Sleep had become a foreign word to Harry and so he had started to watch Draco on the Marauder's Map. Again and again, he picked it up and followed every step his Slytherin made. In the meantime, it had even gotten so bad that he never let the map out of his sight and even had it with him during the day and consulted it when the Slytherin’s had lessons in another part of the castle.
"What? Why?” Potter asked, taking his hand again. His thumb caressed over Draco’s fingers while he studied the varnish again. "It would be such a waste. I think it complements your eyes,” he murmured, locking eyes with Draco. Then he jerked, red-faced, and let go. The next moment he sprung up from his seat.
"What are you two whispering about?" Pansy asked curiously, pulling everyone‘s attention to them.
"No, it’s… well, I accept your apology but…” Harry paused and now his whole face was glowing red. "In the end, it might come to that,” he whispered and wouldn’t meet Ron’s eyes.
"He's bi-sexual, Weasley. Don't you know anything?" Pansy sighed and handed him his gloves as he reached out for them. "And you are clearly straight and so is Hermione. What is Potter?" she asked innocently and pushed a damp strand of hair behind her ear. She had noticed the looks Potter threw at Draco and they weren't the ones he usually got from the Golden Boy. Something had changed since they first became friends with the Gryffindors and Pansy wondered if there could come more for them.
Had he heard right? Getting verbally bashed by the Weasel was nothing new to him, but that Harry hadn't defended him, hell, even participated in it. Harry had said things about Draco that ripped his heart to shreds and anger flooded the hole it had left in his chest. It was simply too much for him to bear. He was numb inside and out. But against his conviction that it couldn't get worse, Harry continued to tear his heart apart when he admitted to having had a crush on Cedric Diggory.
"Calm your knickers, Weasley,” Pansy groused, smirking beatifically. "You can go and hop off a cliff when the second part is out.” She cackled and pointed with one of her long, red nails to the words
And Potter… well, the Golden Boy joked and smiled like he normally did but something seemed off about him. Draco felt him staring much more nowadays, almost like in their sixth year and it made Draco squirmy and sought out his gaze with questioning eyes. But he got no answers, instead, Potter graced him with his slightly crooked smile, which Draco found more and more endearing, making something in Draco’s chest flutter and his cheeks blush.
"Remember to put on your dragonhide gloves when you touch the plants. We don't want to risk burns," said Professor Sprout warningly as she waddled down the aisle. Her little pointed patchwork-hat wiggled merrily back and forth on her gray ringlets.
But now two years later, the war is over, those looming death threats behind them. Draco's father is locked away in Azkaban. Most of the Death Eaters had been rounded up and caught, so that wasn’t a concern anymore to either Draco or Harry. Harry's side had won the war, and little to anyone’s knowledge Draco had actually helped him, by passing on critical information, in any way he could at the time though mostly with their secretly linked coins. They were finally free to be with each other now, they both knew that the public would still react badly to such news of "light and dark" together. But they were in love, so Draco was willing to take the risk.
"I know that you helped a bunch of third years last week with their potions homework. They wouldn’t let you at first but you tried anyway even if it was a bit-" she chuckled, "like the old you, with your snarky comments on their intelligence when they wrote down the wrong ingredients for a calming draught. You told them in a roundabout way what they did wrong and even if they wouldn’t immediately write it down, I saw them second-guessing themselves and looking up what you told them, and then correcting their answers. Professor Slughorn was well pleased or so I heard after their lesson the next day. What you did reminded me of Professor Snape and I was impressed to see you in that manner and them glancing at you with admiration.” She sighed heavily, "I’m still working on it, so don’t expect wonders from me. But I like the conversations we have and I guess it’s fine to let go of the past animosity we shared.”
Had his boyfriend lied to him? Played him all this bloody time? For two fucking years? Why had Harry confessed to him, if he had liked Diggory? Was he just a cheap replacement for the dead boy from Hufflepuff? His father had been right. Draco felt like an utter useless fool. He had thought Harry loved him and cherished him, but now knowing that it wasn't true and that it was the complete opposite, he just couldn't wrap his mind around it all.
Hands clutching tightly together, Harry and Draco walked the corridors of Hogwarts under his invisibility cloak. They hide in alcoves and the shadows of the Armor’s on display, giggling and kissing while dodging the patrolling teachers. When they finally reached the seventh floor, Harry walked forth and back three times with eyes closed in front of the blank wall. He concentrated on the things he wanted in the room and completely ignored the slight snoring of Barnabas the Barmy who slept comfortably in his portrayal.
Draco looked uncertainly at her when she finished, contemplating how to react to such an open offer of peace. He felt out of his waters and decided to go with his usual snark when he replied, "Have you practiced this speech or does something like that come to you freely?"
"Uhm, Harry?” Ron croaked out to get the attention of the agitated boy.
Blaise gave him a curious gaze but Draco shook his head. "It’s nothing. Well, I need to deal with it. So … are you hungry?" he changed the topic and prayed that his ears didn’t glow. Salazar, it was embarrassing that he couldn’t get the story out of his mind. He smiled slightly at his friend when he nodded and started to change his clothes.
There, he had said it. His breath was ragged as he waited for the reaction to the bomb he had just dropped on his friends.
Soon, Draco felt Harry's hands on him again. He felt something being gently brushed over his shaft and around his testicles. "What are you..." he began but was hushed again by his boyfriend. “Just let me do this. You don’t need to worry," Harry mumbled and circled Draco's entrance with his thumb again before he spread his ass cheeks wide apart and dove in.
Baffled, Draco looked up from his packing and didn’t know how to react. He couldn’t fathom why she was so trusting towards him after he had called her
Harry caressed his hands down Draco's neck, over his shoulders, and found their way to the tiny buttons of his shirt. Slowly he pulled them open and kissed every inch of Draco's pale skin that he exposed on his way down. When he finally reached the waistband of Draco's trousers, he pulled the shirt completely open and drew back, to take his fill with the writhing Slytherin beneath him. "Harry," Draco breathed as he looked at his boyfriend watching him. Heat shot through his body and pooled in his loins. He loved the way Harry's eyes roamed over every inch of his skin. It was a wondrous thing every time, that someone, no; the Chosen One would look at him with so much longing and love.
Harry smiled at her. He was glad that he had forgiven her for trying to rat him out to Voldemort. The circumstances at the time were not the best and he had found it in him that he could understand her need to protect herself. He wanted to leave the past where it belonged and live in the present. And making friends with former enemies was certainly interesting.
Blaise held her gently back at her shoulder when she was ready to storm out the door, "Wait Pans, I think I have a better idea to get back at Potter." A sly smirk played on his lips. "Why don't Draco and I pretend to be dating and let him feel what it is like to get your heart broken?" he said,  gazing to Draco for affirmation.
"Time to get this done," he said and bestowed a smile at Draco.
"Urg, I said to leave it alone," he groaned and threw his napkin beside his plate.
Harry snapped out of his reminiscing of the past when Ron snorted a grunt in his sleep. He rolled out of his bed and traipsed over to the window sill. Sitting down, he laid his head back against the cold stone and watched the silver crescent moon travel over a brilliantly clear starry sky. His eyes searched for the constellation of the Dragon while silent tears fell down his cheeks and wet his sweat-soaked sleeping shirt even more. He couldn’t find him.
Harry was not deterred by the fake scowl. He took a deep breath that caught Draco's attention and took hold of both Draco’s hands, holding them tightly. The Gryffindor seemed to ignore the silence that had befallen the Great Hall.  Just like that everyone's eyes were on them.
Unconsciously, he licked his lips and blushed all kinds of red when he caught himself in the action. Draco shook his head again, turned, and walked away, resisting the urge to glance one last time over his shoulder.
"Oh-kay… so what got your knickers in a twist?” Ron wasn’t certain that he should even ask but did it anyway because he got the feeling that this wasn’t about their friendship.
"What Ron?” came muffled from between the sheets and the pillow.
"Potter-... Potter-... Harry!"
It was the same owl as last time and Draco’s stomach plummeted. He snatched the parchment from the ground and approached the next alcove that came in sight.
Ron nodded and drew her in for a tight hug, before kissing her head, before they parted ways for the night and headed up to their own dorms.
," Shadow corrected coldly.
Draco felt sick looking at it. He reached for Marissa and tucked her head into his side. "Don't look."
Shadow got comfortable in the tree branches. It felt right, being up here. He felt as sturdy as he did on the ground and he allowed his mind to drift. He had felt awkward about his eyes from the beginning. Now it was a hundred times worse. He closed them tight, knowing that even in his lynx state his DNA had affected them. Instead of two golden eyes, one was a deep amber.
Draco spun around, his grey eyes on fire. "You don't know the first thing about who I am, Black. I suggest you keep your mouth shut unless you
Shuddering, horrified, he shakily grabbed his wand and cast the strongest cleaning spell he knew. It hurt, burning his skin slightly and making it red with irritation, but he didn't care. It also made his clothes stiffen and become itchy. It wasn't enough. He banished his bedding to the laundry room, leaving a bare mattress.
Shadow smiled shakily back. "Yeah. Okay. Sorry. I just hate talking about it."
"Shadow…" he said again, more gently. "Hey. It's okay. I'm sorry."
"I will not lie to you," Severus promised. "I may, at times, withhold information, but I will never lie."
The man looked around. He cast a quick revealing spell, but it came back negative for humans. He scowled at the birds. "Shut up, you bloody annoying birds!" The flock scattered as the man picked up at rock and tossed it at them. "Don't know why Malfoy keeps these things around…"
"No. We're not fighting," he reassured. "I'm going back to my room."
Draco smiled and brushed a loose lock of hair off her face. "Go to sleep. You're going to need to be rested if you're going to see Seraphim tonight.” It was only early afternoon, but Draco had a feeling they had a long night ahead of them.
Shadow shivered against his father's hands, braced against his shoulders. Slowly his tears and the nausea lessened enough for Severus to stand and fetch some potion. Shadow downed the Calming Draught without hesitating. It blessedly cooled his racing thoughts and dampened his emotions.
"I know that.” Neville glared. "It's not like I -"
… Draco thought in a daze.
Harry really did smirk then. Only Severus would come as close as he ever would to saying 'I love you' while glaring at the other person as if they were guilty of something. In any case, he did understand. And he didn't need empathy to know Severus truly cared for him, so he softened his smirk into a smile. "I will be honored to have you as a father, Severus."
"If a person with such qualities, the qualities that you just described, came into your life and offered you a chance at the type of happiness you
"Thank you." Shadow smiled and stood. "My portkey or yours?"
December arrived and with it came snow. Soon the ground was covered in white and the cold was more pervasive. After speaking with both Draco and Neville - who had been surprisingly pessimistic about the whole thing - Shadow decided that the best time to talk to Hermione and Ron was the weekend before winter break. That would allow him to still be available for absolutely necessary questions, but also give them all space, allowing them to ignore each other if their reaction was bad.
The Bat form also indicates a person prone to envy, because envy works in the shadows and does not expose itself to the light of day. Conversely, because the Bat is comfortable in the dark, this type of person has the ability to guide people through the darkness of confusion and help them face their fears. It is sometimes said a person with a Bat Animagus will have the gift of clear hearing and of listening between the lines.
"Why am I so sore?" Shadow demanded, wide-eyed. "And where'd all this blood come from? Where are my clothes?" He began to hyperventilate. He
Godric said nothing for a minute, instead studying the young man before him. "I know what you wish me to divulge, but I cannot."
He released Minerva with an apology and promised to recognize the valiant Order of the Phoenix who had taken on the brunt of the Dark Forces. Minerva was reinstated at the Headmistress of Hogwarts much to most everyone's relief.
"And the influence goes both ways. Seraphim's phobia of touch explains why Shadow avoids physical contact and will only seek out touch from those he trusts completely, but he gains something from Seraphim as well. He can now unconsciously access the dark and light planes of magic. Once his magical channels heal, he'll be just as powerful as Seraphim, though I must admit it will only function in times of desperate need. I don't think he'll ever have conscious control over it. His psychology just doesn't lend itself to the frequency of the two planes as Seraphim's does."
"If Shadow agrees," Severus said roughly, but he was more uncertain than ever that Boy would ever be able to be integrated back into Shadow without making his son unable to function like a normal human being.
"Why were you still awake at that hour?" Auror Whitman continued.
ever did!"
"How strange," Umbridge told McGonagall sweetly as the older woman continually failed to discharge the fish made of water. "You'd think that the Headmistress, at least, would be able to discharge a student's magic."
They were almost to the nearby snogging room when the twins happened upon them on their way back to the dorms from their late night wanderings. They were up to something, but no one knew what. Neville made a mental note to ask Shadow if he knew before the next DA meeting.
to me - to tell me that he was hurting. That's more than
"It's just melanin, Ronald!" Hermione cried, obviously frustrated.
"You do?" Shadow asked, hope lighting his eyes. "Ginny, anything you can tell me would really, really help. Sirius has been looking, but there are so many things they could be and we're running out of time."
Sirius grinned his famous grin, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Then we'll just have to be subtle about it."
"What!" Draco jumped to his feet, face pale and furious. "Are you okay?"
Shadow shook his head, pulling out of his dark thoughts. "I like Rogan. He's a natural leader and he's smart, you know? Miles is very shy. Like you were, I guess, but Rogan looks out for him. Lillian is all spitfire. She loves to argue and she's incredibly quick to anger and equally quick to laugh. You never know which you're going to get with her."
The two men turned, both shooting repeated glances backward, probably hoping he would call them back, but Shadow had no intention of doing so. He was pissed, and more than that, he was hurt. To prove he wouldn't call them back, he turned into a lynx. The men didn't look back after that.
And there was no doubt who was behind it. It had spread like wildfire that the twins had it out for Umbridge. No one came forward and told the woman that, however. Everyone knew that to do so would only make them a target as well, and no one was quite that stupid. It was also noted in whispers and glances that Professor McGonagall hadn't really protested. The Headmistress was known to be anti-pranks, so it was curious that she didn't seem to mind.
Seraphim was still crying against the wall, and Omi was beginning to make a quiet whining noise.
"We made three pendants that hiss in Parseltongue. I gave one to Rogan for emergencies if they ever really need to escape Carrow, I gave another to Neville for similar reasons, and the last to Sirius so we could shut the side door. Now I'm not the only one who can open the Chamber."
"But you were being watched closely. Perhaps you did what you could." Lucius slid his gaze to the unconscious teen at Severus's back. "You did have a child to protect. A son. I know what that's like. Perhaps when Severus was certain he could get away with it and not blow his cover, he would move in the Dark's favor. Striking like a snake when the Light least expected it. Is that what happened, old friend?"
Exhilarated and pleased beyond measure that his soon-mate was clearly his now,
The lynx licked his whiskers in agreement, making Neville - who sat across from him - laugh.
"Okay. I'll play with you, Sirius." She smiled.
"Some talk about things that are centuries in the future," Draco said indifferently. "It's not like they'll all come true tomorrow."
"Oh." Neville blushed nervously and began to sweat. "I like her a lot, Ron."
"Probably due to the oncoming seizure. Nothing to do with me!" Salazar argued.
"That'd be fine," Shadow allowed and shut his door.
Ron stood and shut the book a tad roughly. "I'm going to go back to the Tower. See you."
Neville Longbottom wouldn't have been able to believe that he
She just stared at him, hardly feeling it.
"I'm not hungry," Shadow protested and moved to stand. "Let's go now."
“Hey." Fred grinned. "We thought you…"
"That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I was worried. You've had a lot of detentions with her, right? Is it always like that?" The knowledge that Umbridge had been hurting Hermione all this time made Shadow more determined than ever to make sure the bitch was taken care of as soon as possible.
Shadow didn't say anything, but he was greatly disappointed. He was just getting stronger after the graveyard and had been looking forward to spending a few weeks having Neville and Draco to himself. He sighed. The world waited for no one. If he was going to do this - if he was going to truly become Shadow Snape - he had to set the foundation. It was critical to
"And he wrote that letter as Harry, so the Order knows he's alive and well," George nodded wisely. "They'll be ready to help him when the time comes. Professor Snape won't let him do anything stupid and neither will we. You know the truth now. He can come to any one of us if he has a problem. He can trust us. Not to mention, if it comes down to it, he has a little army here at Hogwarts."
Severus smiled gently. "He does not deserve your hate. He needs to be handled carefully, yes. Hurting others is not acceptable, but he's not evil or a lost cause."
"Fine," Shadow gave in reluctantly, glowering at the compact. "But I want you to contact us as often as you can."
"Even if it means working with Malfoy?" Hermione asked curiously.
Pritchard yelled as McKinnon cast,
"I've finished my evaluation, if you'd like to hear the details," Salazar said with a grimace. He hated having to be so polite, especially when he had important information to discuss. Patience was never a virtue he'd mastered.
"Neville. Maybe you're right. We'll never know," Charlie interrupted, talking loudly over the teen's heavy breathing and loud sobs. Remus was practically curled around him, rocking him back and forth. "Did he ever ask you about Harry? Did you talk to him?"
But as he tracked the scent, he came not upon a fog-predator but a nest. He slowed, avoiding the patches of light that spilled from the windows, and stalked closer. His talons dug into the earth for traction and overturned the scent of old blood. He growled deep in his throat as another low keen of pain and terror sounded from the nest. Simultaneously, an alpha's scent flared with anger, dominance, and a lazy hunt-scent.
"Mad-Eye," he snapped, eyes flashing over to the ex-Auror. "You'll lead a team of seven to infiltrate the west entrance. Lupin, take five to hold the exit. Minerva," he gestured to his left, "will take another seven in through the South entrance while Kingsley," he tipped his head to his right, "and Emmeline take their teams to guard her back. This will be where the Aurors will focus their energy, so be extra careful."
Despite the fights they never slept in separate rooms and they always made up by morning.
Severus answered his door and nodded when he saw his son on the other side. He had time to consider the implications of the connection Shadow had with the Dark Lord. Had time to cool his outrage that Shadow had kept it from him for so long. He felt he could address the situation reasonably, but still a kernel of frustration and fear could be heard in his voice.
"Yes, of course. I can only do what I have permission for," Salazar huffed and rolled his eyes.
sound like Harry. Maybe she was worrying over nothing. It was true she paid more attention to detail than her friend. He could have made an honest mistake in the letter to them. Certainly the Death Eaters wouldn't want this article printed because it would give people hope and open their eyes to the truth.
All of it evidence that he was still healing. The graveyard had marked his body and mind. It would be a long, long time before he was fully recovered. He knew this. Remus had told him over and over, 'Just give it time. Just rest. You will be strong soon,’ but they hadn't told him everything about his recovery, did they? They didn't tell him about the potential to black out and have one of his remaining alters come to the surface.
Everyone settled down a bit after that. Soft murmurings of conversation hummed as plates began to be filled and emptied. Emmeline was the next to address Shadow, and it was after the twins had already finished one plate and were in the process of getting seconds.
"He was in my head for months," she said, tears rolling down her face as she looked up into his loving brown eyes. "When Harry rescued me, it was like blank spots in my memory, but… Oh, Merlin… It's not true… It's not! I… I could see sometimes and I could… I could hear his thoughts and… They were
"What else could Muggles possibly do?" Severus asked with a sneer.
Amycus fell back limply. His eyes dazed and empty. Draco spat on his cheek as he stood. The wall was still rippling and he stepped through back into the Chamber.
"This is the second time I've had to intervene on your behalf, Neville," she said sternly, putting her hands on her hips. "You tell me to send Mr. Lupin to the Ministry after you if you weren't back in two hours, and now I find you being interrogated by the Order. Just what are you up to, young man? I tried to give you some freedom now that you are finally showing promise, but I'm not going to let you drag our name through the mud!"
"Some believed it was only a matter of time." Sirius shrugged uncomfortably. "They
Ron shifted uncomfortably. In the dim light of the hall and the library, he couldn't tell what color the other boy's eyes were. All he could see was a kid who had been captured and probably tortured or something with the way Poppy and Remus had closeted away together after the teen's examination. Shadow's father was missing, possibly dead, and he had no family left, all of them murdered. He was stuck in a house with strangers, and from the guilty, miserable expression now on his face, Ron could tell Shadow
Corey shook his head, smiling wryly. He walked over to the fallen blond and pat his head once with a laugh.
"That is partly your age talking.” Severus laughed softly.
doing out past curfew?"
"We need your strategic thinking, as well as insight into the Death Eater mindset. Not to mention Minister Fudge has been demanding we turn you over for further questioning."
"While hiding outside in your Animagus form, you mean?" Draco asked sweetly.
Seraphim fell to his knees and blinked his eyes clear. He found himself in a dark corner between two buildings on an unfamiliar street. It was night. He was outside. He was alone. The jacket held his arms crossed over his chest snuggly. He tugged experimentally, but the bindings held. He smiled, reassured that at least that hadn’t changed.
Draco frowned. "What's that supposed to mean?" He crossed his arms over his chest. His annoyance skyrocketed at the silent treatment he was getting. Shadow wasn't explaining himself at all. Not where he went yesterday, not why he'd been in such a funky mood. Nothing. It was really starting to piss him off.
Crying out, he thrashed against his unyielding bindings, utterly panicked. His head pounded and his body violently protested, but he was mindless with the fear. His stomach heaved and vomit splattered the floor and his shirt before he passed out once again.
"What are you doing?"
Draco destroyed the locket.
"There's only one thing left," she protested. "He killed his grandmother. Put the piece of his soul that broke off into his familiar. A big snake, a constrictor, I think. Because S-Slytherin was the best of the four Founders, and snakes should be h-honored above all other animals. He got the idea to make Slytherin House royalty almost. He'd find relics of the three other Founders and make them Horcruxes, too, to show his mastery over them. But not Gryffindor. That House, the House of Dumbledore, would be e-erased. After finding out his future self was destroyed, he hated Gryffindor even more because Harry Potter was in it… That's all I remember."
A growl sounded to the right and Charlie spun to see five half-transformed werewolves spring out of the darkness. He cried a warning, but it was too late. He went down under a heavy body. A vicious bite tore into his shoulder and, with a roar of pain, he got busy fighting for his life.
"What is it? What's wrong?" he asked worriedly as he hurried forward.
Seraphim smiled and wiped at his wet cheeks. He nodded and reached a trembling hand forward to rest on Draco's wrist briefly before pulling it back into his personal space.
"I found them trying to sneak back up to Gryffindor Tower, Miss," Filch said proudly, walking up to Umbridge instead of the Headmistress.
When Monday morning rolled around and Neville still hadn't returned to the tower, Ginny really began to worry. She hurried to her brother's dorm room. Dean and Seamus cried out in shock, diving for their beds as she walked in on them getting dressed.
Shadow skid into a new room and froze with horror, all his fur bristling up and his ears pinned flat. Lucius Malfoy Disapparated, leaving his delighted laughter echoing behind him. Shadow was alone with Draco. The room was fairly open. Desks were shoved up against the walls; papers and notes were strewn everywhere. In the center was a huge tank with things floating inside. Shadow hardly saw any of this. He ran across the room, toward the center where Draco lay still. He didn't notice when he transformed, but he fell to his knees beside the blond as a human again.
Harry smiled softly. He was on a roll tonight. Making Severus lose his almost unwavering emotional footing twice in so many minutes had to be a record.
Draco didn't notice his friend's distress. He was distracted picturing his revenge on the sick teacher who dared to hurt Shadow. He couldn't stop the sadistic smile that came at the thought. "That'll be fun."
Female's screaming pierced his sensitive ears. He snarled and the Black lashed forward, impaling the sick-female through the throat. The sound cut off only to be replaced by the alpha's roar. He spun to face the alpha and stood on his back legs at his full height, making himself bigger. He staggered as the alpha's blow struck his cheek, but his wings snapped out wide for balance and he didn't fall.
, and I
"Gemino and Flagrante Curses," Severus hissed. "Don't touch anything or we'll be swimming in this stuff."
not have to be alone. He had encouraged him to fight for some of his self-worth back from the man who had sexually abused them. Harry had cared enough to make sure his Earth Elemental magic didn't kill him or destroy his mind. He had caught him at his most despairing moment, when he had finally taken a knife to his wrists with the intention of ending his life. Harry had convinced him to live. And Harry was there to push him into actually moving past his fear and telling Ginny how he felt.
"Don't you know how to knock?" Dean demanded hotly.
as they tried to fight their way free. The second time, Draco had taken a face full of puke-yellow spell-light and fell.
Hermione leaned into his open arms and cried against his chest. "Oh, Viktor! I still love you."
"We need to talk to Neville alone," Hermione said firmly. She was too tired and grim to play games. "Go away."
"No one move!" Lucius bellowed, glaring hatefully at his son. "Especially you, Mrs. Selwyn!" he spat at the smirking woman.
So lost in thought, Draco hardly paid attention to what Shadow and Hermione were talking about as they leaned over a table and went through the notes complied on all the things the DA was working on and had covered previously. His attention was instead focused on the messy curls, the still faintly red cheeks, the gorgeous swollen lips. It was enough to drive him
“Thanks." Shadow smiled as he sipped the lukewarm tea.
Shadow sighed, looked up at Severus as if for guidance, then shut his eyes. For good measure, he tipped his head forward and his soft, ebony curls hid his face further. Standing like that, he looked thin and small, an innocent fourteen-year-old boy. There was nothing remarkable about him. Severus was pleased his son, at least, had the ability to act and deceive. Unlike Miss Pucey, Shadow was a true Slytherin.
is really back, Harry Potter is needed to reassure everyone. Not that they should use a teenager to make themselves feel better - they should fight to protect their own selves - but I'm going to need help and having people panic or flee in terror won't help very much."
"Then I suppose you can take that by progress I mean evolving." Salazar smiled smugly, pleased with himself and his cleverness.
"What were you thinking leaving him alone outside? What was he doing out there in the first place?" Severus bellowed, eyes dark and deadly.
Remus's eyes darkened with pity. "He's dead, Neville. He attacked us and made you think we were your enemies. He was using you."
"Is it over?" Augusta asked stiffly. She came into the room and looked down at the small teen.
Neville yanked his arm away as soon as he felt her fingers relax a bit. He backed a few steps, his heart twisting at the hurt look on Ginny's face. This wasn't her fault. She didn't understand and he didn't want her to. The wind picked up and she raised her hand to hold her long red hair out of her face. Neville hated himself when he saw the tears in her eyes. She was too beautiful to cry.
Shadow bit down and got a good grip on Neville's sweater. He spread his paws and pulled backward, halting his brother's forward motion.
Seraphim cocked his head, still glaring mistrustfully, but he was considering the offer. That was good enough for Severus. He turned to Neville and ruthlessly invaded his mind. He wanted to know what happened and wasn't about to ask questions where Augusta Longbottom would overhear. Neville's mind was unguarded. Severus wasn't looking for much, so it took less than three seconds. When he pulled out, Neville's legs buckled and he fell heavily to his knees. Augusta jumped to her feet, her wand aimed at Severus's torso.
"Can we do that?" Neville asked, brown eyes lighting up at the prospect.
Shadow morphed into his human form, still very wet. He scowled at the blond as he began to cast drying charms. "Was that necessary?"
The bat screeched at them, mouth open revealing four delicate, pointy fangs. He fluttered up to a bookcase and settled there watchfully. Eventually, the boys pulled themselves together, but they had to avoid looking at the soft, furry creature in order to do so.
"Sit on my lap," Lockhart said with an eager smile, his large hand reaching for him.
Neville jumped, surprised at the tone. Shadow scowled and Draco nodded, his wand held steady despite the trembling in his arms and legs. They made their way closer to the sound of battle. Only to find Mad-Eye battling Edmund Lestrange. A nephew of Bellatrix.
have a gift with plants, and that it
Neville nodded and flooed away without another word. Shadow shook his head. Neville could still surprise him; he had never felt so grateful to have the shy, brave Gryffindor as his brother.
"Wait," he called. He ran five feet to a paper stand that had magically filled a second ago. He reached inside and yanked a paper out before returning to Severus. They Apparated into the small clearing where their tent stood. Shadow stepped away from his father and stared down at the front page.
The Longbottom matriarch frowned deeply. "Go upstairs and put some decent clothes on, young man. I will not have you walking around in rags. The Longbottoms are not vagabonds. Your mother would be appalled."
"Care to share?" Sirius drawled as he followed the blond back into the main chamber.
Severus and Draco turned around, wands held discreetly at their side.
Laughing, Harry realized he was outmaneuvered and finished his lunch. He really didn't want to upset Omi and Severus needed rest. His mentor was still a bit worn from everything that had happened. As a reward for being a good patient, Harry was given his magical parchment that connected to Neville's. He had written his brother briefly last night after he had sent off Draco's letter. Neville was at the Herbology Institute at the moment, but he was desperately glad to hear from Harry.
he demanded silently.
"Course I'll be there," the redhead told her with surprise.
"We are not at liberty to say, Madam," the second Auror answered.
The teen sat up with a gasp, eyes wild.
Seraphim frowned but looked more interested.
"What?" Hermione frowned.
Severus nodded and pulled himself to his feet. "May I see my son?"
"A curse scar is a scar created by a magical curse unable to complete its purpose," Remus explained. "The failed or incomplete curse leaves a residue that wishes to finish its job, but doesn't have the power to do so. The curses that injured Shadow in the graveyard were all allowed to do what they were made to do, so there is no magical residue left to resist healing. If Shadow continues with his weekly skin treatments, they should all disappear in about three months."
Sirius grabbed the back of his hair to tip his head back and hold it steady. Draco groaned, his hands spasmed as he began to regain consciousness. Sirius shook him roughly, rousing him further. Shadow whimpered, protesting the harsh treatment as they clearly saw a chuck of blond hair come away in Sirius's hand. Sirius just grabbed another fistful to steady his grip.
Draco turned around, a smirk on his lips, even though the tension hadn't left his shoulders yet. "It won't be that easy to get rid of me."
Draco picked up a book by his feet and said softly, "I've never seen him act like that. Why is he so upset?"
"Wait! Don't!" he yelled desperately, knowing they wouldn't listen but unable to do anything else. He thought of the terrorized child who played with him, who cried brokenly next to him for hours, and who practically begged for kindness. He couldn't stand by and watch that child be hurt.
"I'm fine, but listen to this." Shadow explained everything he learned about the prophecy and Voldemort being alive, but he also told Draco something he hadn't mentioned to his father yet. "I was thinking. You know those awful dreams I had, of wanting to let Demon Out? That corridor and the door…"
Severus's voice dropped and softened dangerously. "Seraphim had disappeared; he could have been hurt or captured; he did hurt others. Again. Maybe you weren't aware of the impact such an act would have on Shadow's mind? Mayhap I was mistaken regarding your comprehension of the situation?”
"You found the locket?" Neville about jumped out of his seat. "Where is it?"
"No, of course not," Remus said softly.
The little girl frowned at that, but Draco made a face at her telling her how much he needed her to be nice, so she straightened and pretended she wasn't angry with Shadow.
The woman nodded to herself, her eyes lingering on Shadow, and said, "They're holding your hearing in Courtroom Ten."
"What's your point, because I think mine is clear," the teen sneered.
The thirteen-year-old nodded, tears falling down her pale face. She rose without saying a word and practically fled.
Severus's voice went soft and smoky. If Shadow didn't know better, he would say the man was completely under the thrall of the potion. But the story came out the same, more detailed as it should under the serum, but the same as the one they had crafted. Finally, the last question was asked and answered. Shadow expected them to release Severus then, but instead new questions were asked and they had nothing to do with suddenly having a son.
"Is Shadow in his room?" George asked, changing the subject.
"This. All of it," Draco answered. His breathing constricted. "It's a ridiculously huge problem and inhumanly cruel for us to be the ones to fix it. We're fifteen years old for Merlin's sake! You're posing as being fourteen! We're just teenagers and a soulless
There was a collective sigh of relief from the group, but Bill was not satisfied. He caught his brother's eye and made it clear he wanted to talk.
"Shhh," Severus soothed. He gently rubbed circles between his son's shoulder blades. "You are safe. Nothing's going to hurt you here."
xXxXx
Neville loosed a battle cry and a thick tooth of earth, about seven feet high, speared up through the stone ground. They were in the lowest level of the Ministry, surrounded by the earth. Neville was in his element.
"Thank you," Shadow said again.
"So you feel no one would care enough about you to deal with the difficulties you embody?" Severus clarified. Despite suppressing his emotions, he felt a pang of recognition at hearing that. He lowered his head, his hair curtaining his face. "I once felt the same," he admitted softly. His eyes came up and met his son's. "I want to tell you two things. I want you to really listen to me. Even if you can't understand or believe me right now, I want you to remember and think on what I'm about to tell you."
"You are Slytherin. You understand the value you possess in being the only one Seraphim trusts. That position would have been compromised had you called for help. Or maybe it's a sexual jealousy. You obviously enjoyed Seraphim's company. Maybe you wanted to keep secret the effect he had on you, afraid that your lust would be revealed."
Draco's eyes went wide and his back went rigid. Slowly, he turned around. A Death Eater stood behind him. Just like in a hundred nightmares since that past summer, a thin pale hand reached up for the featureless white mask and pulled it away to reveal Lucius Malfoy. Lucius returned his son's stare and smiled with feverish eyes sparkling in his now gaunt face.
Shadow snorted and looked away, his eyes dark and angry.
Neville shivered. He looked to the twins for help, but the redheads were staring at Draco, strange looks on their faces. Neville sighed and reached out for his brother's arm. He shook it lightly. "Shadow," he called reprovingly.
"Seven," Arthur said coming in from the garden. He'd been blown completely out of the manor. "Six is dead," he added, reporting for Elphias Doge. They didn't want to use names incase there were recording spells in place that the Death Eaters would collect later. The less the Dark Lord knew about the Order, the better.
There were vivid pictures attached to each case study. The book had twenty-seven case histories total, all of the supposed criminals suffering extreme and severe punishments for their crimes. Of course, not all of them were innocents. Some were mass murderers, rapists, or child predators. But some were only hungry thieves or people who had harbored suspected rebels.
Burning heat throbbed through Shadow’s body; he laid back, sweating and languid. Warm hands slid up his thighs, warm and leaving goosebumps. They caressed his twitching stomach, slid over his chest, and kneaded his shoulders. Shadow arched into the touch, warmth pooling in his groin, pleasure radiating from his core. A moan, slow and sensual, resonated from deep in his chest, the sound low and rough, a counterpart to his breathy pants. Long fingers tweaked his nipples and he cried out, grasping at the desk underneath him. The heat was spiraling higher, burning him.
"I'm a Prefect as well as you," Hermione huffed, rolling her eyes. "And we don't have duties tonight. It's the Slytherin's turn to patrol for students breaking curfew."
"I'll unpack, and then I need to visit the lab," Severus spoke up. "If you need me, I'll most likely be there."
Shadow nodded and left the room. The conversation hadn't gone as he'd thought it would. He felt no more in control than when he entered, but maybe Severus was right. Maybe things would become clearer in his own head if he took some time to write things down. Decided, he made his way to his room.
Draco wasn't surprised when he found Neville only two hallways away from Myrtle's bathroom. The Gryffindor stood with his head hanging, his fist tellingly against the wall. Walking calmly, hands in his pockets, Draco approached the distressed teen. Neville was too caught up in his own head to notice. Sneering in disgust, Draco cleared his throat.
Suddenly the door was thrown open and Augusta Longbottom stepped into the room. Charlie had to put a restraining hand on Kingsley's shoulder to keep him from attacking the woman. They had been so close to getting Neville to talk!
Ducking his head, Seraphim closed his eyes as they filled with tears. "Together," he whispered, feeling that strange warm feeling in his chest he only ever felt around Draco. He hugged himself within his jacket and straightened, pushing Draco away with magic. "Let's eat now. I'm still hungry."
"Don't know, don't know, don't know…" Seraphim muttered. He slid down the wall and let his magic whip around him, but there was nothing to fight. He didn't understand. He didn't
Severus sneered, but didn't answer. He turned and stalked from the house, slamming the door hard in his wake. Draco took his place in the doorway. He was rolling down his sleeves. "Would anyone care to explain what's going on?"
Shadow wore slacks and a plain white, long-sleeved shirt without wizarding robes. He wore a necklace around his neck, a silver bracelet on his left wrist, and a ring on the first finger of his right hand. The next thing she noticed was his pale skin, very much like Severus', and then she took in his black curls. They were messily attractive. Minerva estimated he stood about five foot six, and inch or so shorter than Ron. His face was neutral, his stance guarded. Then she looked into his eyes.
"I gathered you did from what you wrote last night.” Shadow frowned. "I have a lot to tell you, too. Is anything wrong?"
"They're very pretty," Shadow admitted and took a bite himself when the potatoes were a peach color. His eyes widened. They tasted like a peach, too!
"I agree." Remus nodded and moved toward the door.
All eyes turned toward him and Shadow clenched his fists, ducking his head so his curls hid his expression of cold anger. "Let's just say… Umbitch took it too far."
Minerva winced. Severus was right. Albus would not have hesitated when he saw one more hold he could have over his ex-spy to insure complete obedience. That decided her. Not only was Shadow Severus's son, but the boy was also a victim of the headmaster's plots himself.
Shadow nodded once, stiffly. He was about ready to go through her just to get out of that room.
"I came to help," Draco said lowly, eyeing his friend. "Do you want it or not?"
After washing and getting dressed, he made his way to the dinning room. Everyone was present except Severus. The man hardly made any meals, instead eating alone or skipping for all Shadow knew. The Potions Master was so wrapped up in whatever he was doing that it wouldn't surprise Shadow in the least. He felt a twinge of disappointment and abandonment, but he quickly let it pass. He knew whatever Severus was working on had to be important.
Draco licked the abused spot and pressed a gentle kiss there, knowing it would leave a bruise later. That thought was strangely exhilarating and he bit his lover again, lower. Shadow cried out, excitement and need in the sound. Draco grinned and continued downward, biting and soothing repeatedly. Shadow was squirming under him. The sounds being wrenched from him were utterly delicious. Almost in a trance, Draco unbuttoned his lover's pants as need and pent up desire overwhelmed him.
Draco looked up from the book he was reading at the desk and narrowed his eyes. "Show off."
"Do you need another?" she asked, stepping back.
Rough, muffled sobbing could be heard behind him. Severus was hissing with every inhale in. Remus was growling, the cooling charms slowing as he lost concentration.
"Those of you with family or friends wearing the Dark Mark and still faithfully serving will know of what I speak. They have changed with the Dark Lord's return. Have abandoned slow and reasoned action for a fevered and desperate rebellion. As Slytherins, it is not in our nature to deny reality or the evidence before us. The Dark Lord is not what he once was, still fearsome and powerful, but vastly unstable and a threat to his followers and his enemies alike. I swear to you that not even perfect obedience and perfect loyalty will protect you from his tortures."
The goblin was affected as well. He flushed and scrambled around the counter, hand gesturing for Draco to follow. "Right this way, Lord Black. My name is Bogrod. I'm sure we'll get this done with quickly."
Draco struggled to catch his breath, hair and uniform disheveled, his mind racing so fast he could hardly think. Their future happiness was riding on him handling this correctly. It seemed he was constantly in this position with Shadow; there was never room for error! "I just want to talk. Nothing more, all right?"
Despite the constant reassurance and hints of progress, the reporters were giving voice to increasingly demanding and impatient articles. They were growing tired of waiting. They wanted to see justice done quickly, so that they could feel safe in their beds. There were no reports or hints of Death Eater activity or mention of the Order of the Phoenix.
Nothing.
Draco saw some of this in Shadow's striking eyes. He felt like he was on fire and they weren't even touching. Just knowing that Shadow was looking at him like that and not running away made his blood boil. Holding that intense gaze, Draco smoothly reached over and gently curled his fingers around Shadow's hand, caressing the brunet's palm once.
Draco laughed.
The little elf appeared with wide blue eyes, reacting to the energy coming off the two teens.
A grating noise sounded as the dresser was pushed away. Both teens stared as the door opened and Severus limped into the room.
"I murdered the Dursleys-"
"Are you ready to be introduced to the Order? I'll issue a call for a full meeting for tomorrow afternoon."
Hermione kept looking back, but she didn't know what else to say. It was all too much! Not only had Harry been here all this time, but it was like her worst fear had come to life - that Harry was lost to her forever. She never expected Harry himself to be the one to deliver the terrible news.
"Or our name isn't the Impossible Duo!"
"Hear, hear!" the twins bellowed, knocking their mugs together.
Harry sat silently, cursing his body and doubly cursing the Death Eaters. It felt like an eternity before Severus finally came in. "Shut the door please," he said softly.
Sirius's voice was small and tinny as it echoed out of the rippling mirror.
"I believe you said that last year, as well.” Severus smirked and sat in the chair by the fireplace. "We should work on your judgment skills."
"Fancy move." Shadow laughed, his eyes bright. He recalled what he'd read about peacocks, how they danced to attract their mate.
"Well, I didn't know that," Shadow answered just as softly. "And then the tournament happened. Ron believed I put my name in the goblet even though I told him I hadn't. We didn't speak for weeks. It wasn't the same between the three of us after that, even after he apologized. We weren't exactly close any more. I was closer to Neville. We had been best friends since two years ago. He's like a brother to me.
"I know," Draco rasped, hoarse. Tears filled his own eyes as he listened to the anguished story.
"I was thinking," Hermione said to Shadow. "We should have a name. It'll promote a team spirit."
He flicked his eyes to the entrance as Draco walked into the room, hair mussed from sleep. Severus spoke calmly. "Wash your hands and finish chopping the carrots."
, Monday’s headline had read), Draco and Sirius had been released from interrogation and were now working with the Order, and Severus and he were still stalking the shadier areas of the Wizarding World keeping their eyes and ears open for anything useful.
Neville responded and held her to his chest almost desperately. Ginny wished she could take away all he had seen - it had obviously disturbed him - but she couldn't. So she'd settle for showing him that he was loved. Neville sank into her warmth, into the comfort she gave him, allowing her to push out the images in his mind. For the first time since the awful battle, he felt his muscles relax.
in gold over the top of the Secrecy Scroll and used a sticking charm to post it on the wall. Shadow looked over at Draco and the blond smirked at him. Things were going perfectly. They didn't even need to plant anti-Ministry seeds; Umbridge was doing it for them.
"Thank you." Harry smiled at her, thinking of her son Anthony. He was in the DA and was a good fighter, although he was very suspicious of everyone.
Draco hesitated but relented. Sighing, the blond crawled back into the bed he and Shadow had been sharing. There wasn't enough rooms to give Draco one of his own. He was just lucky Shadow didn't mind. The twins had also offered, but three to a bed was a bit much. Plus Draco had a suspicion that he wouldn't come out of their room whole by morning. The Weasley twins were utterly insane.
Shadow tossed his brother a wave and walked with Draco the rest of the way to the Slytherin common room. He was thankful Draco didn't start questioning him about what had happened. He didn't really want to talk about it. He just wanted to go to sleep. He didn't even bother changing, just collapsed on his bed and was unconscious almost instantly.
Shadow realized that even Sirius seemed solemn and in agreement. Sighing, he backed down. "Fine, but I'm not saying that ridiculous You-Know-Who crap. I'll call him Tom from now on."
"I have a variant of a werewolf in my head. It comes out at the full moon and other times of stress. Suffice it to say Draco, Severus, and I have done everything we can to keep the creature tame and relatively harmless. We're working on a cure."
"That's something," Draco agreed, sitting on the table in front of the brunet.
"Are there places like that?"
Seeing Ron and Hermione had reminded him again of the past and Lockhart. He was still raw from the memories and squirmed uneasily at the thought of sexual pleasure. The only times he'd been able to get past his aversion was when it was spontaneous and so passionate that he'd no room to think of anything except the moment.
"Of course we are," Severus drawled with a dark glare. "Some of us know the meaning of punctuality."
"Excellent!" Fudge cried. The Auror saluted again and left, shutting the sound-proof door behind him. "Dolores, I trust you can handle his interrogation. Get me something I can use! I'm going to inform the public that we've finally apprehended a dangerous Death Eater. It will reassure them and perhaps buy us time."
Draco's head snapped up just as Harry's eyes cracked open. "Hey. How do you feel?" he asked softly, leaning close so Harry wouldn't have to talk loudly. "Do you need anything?"
"Well, Remus can't go absent every full moon," Remus-Sirius argued, arms crossed petulantly. "Umbridge will know what he is in a second. She's the one that passed all those anti-werewolf laws forbidding him to have job two years ago. Anyway, I know Remus better than anyone. I can handle being him for a week out of every month."
"I certainly don't want to go to prison, but … I will." Neville opened his dark brown eyes, resolute. "I believe Shadow is safe where he is and with people who will help him. You cannot make me betray him."
There was excited chatter as the students filed out of the Room of Requirement. Ginny lingered and when almost everyone was gone she was finally able to catch Shadow's attention. She gestured that she wanted to talk to Shadow alone. Reluctant, he finished giving advice to a group of Sixth-year Hufflepuffs and made his way over to the corner she had secured by glaring at anyone who came too close.
One second he was on the ground, the next he was flinging himself mindlessly against the barrier holding him in. Magic cackled around him. It poured through his veins until he thought he would burst into flames… No! He was fire, and he was burning… burning…
Severus leapt over his prone form, yelling curses. The pain cut off as if it had never been and Shadow hissed, forcing his muscles to unclench. Shoving himself to his hands and knees, he lifted his sweat-soaked face. Severus was standing over an old witch. She lay sprawled, unconscious, blood trickling from her mouth and nose.
"Well, I'm not going anywhere." Draco sneered, crossing his arms. It's not like he even cared about the Weasel or anyone else. He was here for Shadow and that was it.
care for him! How
Draco shivered as Lockhart began to scream again. He was beginning to come out of shock. He had to get these people out of here, but what could he do? If he showed himself to be an enemy, Demon would attack him as well, and Draco didn't want to die so horribly. Not at Shadow's hands, even if Demon was behind his eyes. Alarms began to blare. Draco's heart began to race even faster. The Aurors would be coming in minutes.
A wave of magic poured out of his wand even without him enchanting a spell. The struggling teenagers and Sirius all froze. Some were caught in awkward positions and tipped over. Draco stood and dusted off his pants, trying to conceal the fact that he was breathing hard.
Neville laughed. "Don't look at me, brother. You're going to have to take care of that yourself."
Magic was the only thing that gave him power when all the world would have him powerless and broken. It was his one security; his sanity depended on it. Flinging his hands at the walls hysterically, no magic came to his call, neither the healing magic nor the Black magic.
"Luna," Neville spoke tightly in a whisper. "How do you activate the jacket?"
"You do not have to.” Firenze smiled. "I saw darkness and suffering written above your head in the forest years ago, Chosen. It is a powerful force, yet you tame it. Only one with a bright star would be able to do this; only light can tame darkness. Your star is so much brighter than a normal man or wizard. It rises like the sun and will shine in the sky for eternity with the Great Beings, no matter your path or your end. That is how special your star is. I come to help that star keep a long path through the night sky; that is why I come."
It was almost painful, pushing the need to avenge his mother down and soften his voice. Draco grabbed her hand and turned them back toward the tent. "We shouldn't stay near here. It might be dangerous. Let's go back and show Seraphim the treasures you found."
"No," Salazar agreed with a content grin. "They aren't different people. Shadow wouldn't have a fully functioning personality without Seraphim because then he would no longer have a subconscious and vice versa. They have a symbiotic relationship; meaning they have individual existences but are dependent on each other for survival. This is what allows Shadow to have access to the dark and light planes of magic. Without Seraphim, he'd not have that great power.
someone to talk to.
"That is some reassurance at least, that you are not courting this bond," Severus allowed and backed off, physically and mentally. He went to the fireplace and poured a small snifter of brandy. He turned to face his son. Shadow had returned to his seat at least. "I want Salazar to examine this connection. I won't know what steps to take until I fully understand the nature of what we are dealing with."
? How could he attack the skittish alter? Now he had
Tuesday during his free period before dinner, Shadow asked the twins to meet him in a classroom on the first floor. They did so, bringing cauldrons and ingredients to work on their next prank on Umbridge. Shadow had picked the classroom on purpose, knowing that Rogan and his group often came there to talk and hang out before dinner.
Sirius glared, standing as well. "Now wait a minute.”
Draco and Shadow followed silently after the other Slytherins. Severus strode along behind them, watching his little group of snakes. It didn't bode well that Draco and Shadow were already being shunned. Not good at all.
Shadow smiled. "He can be a bit obsessive, can't he?"
Draco stared at his friend. He was worried by the calm manner Shadow had adopted lately. No matter what came up, he took everything in almost apathetically. Was Shadow despairing? Was he giving up? His eyes cut to Severus, the one person who might be able to know what his son was thinking and help him through it.
Shadow lifted his head to sneer at him. "Maybe for you."
Severus felt his expression harden. He remembered the Carrows very well; they were both sadistic and malicious. Apprehension and cold anger for his Slytherins rose into his eyes and Minerva smiled at seeing it.
be from there. The Dark Lord most likely was never aware of Shadow getting visions in the first place. He'll think the dreams are his own. The shared dreams won't hurt Shadow."
Piano music reached his ears and he slumped gratefully. He didn't want to be alone, but he didn't want to disturb anyone either. He hurried down the hallway and entered the music room. Music swelled around him. Shadow sat at the bench, head bowed, pounding on the keys. The relentless beat snapped and eddied around more melodious notes. There was nothing gentle in it, angry and loud and barely in control. The deep bass notes vibrated in his chest. Draco wrapped his arms around his chest and leaned against the door, giggling, hysteria creeping in at the edges.
Seeing his rising distress, Severus leaned forward and captured Shadow's eyes with his own. "Talk to me."
Seeing the defensive move both Corey and Draco spun, wands raised.
Shadow shook his head, mouth a stubborn line. "It is not acceptable."
"Here we are," Remus interrupted his thoughts.
Without warning, he flung himself to the side, tucked into a tight roll, and came to his feet facing the door and the shadowy form standing where his back would have been a moment before. "
Shadow sighed and ran his hands through his hair. "I should, I know, but…”
Shadow felt sick. His father and Sirius had almost died for nothing.
A shot glass appeared before him filled with amber liquid and the barkeep returned to Severus. Shadow took his drink and turned to face the rest of the pub, leaning back against the bar. His hand twitched, wanting to rub at his throbbing scar, but he kept it still. His fingers tightened against his glass and he wondered if the alcohol would help or hinder. Either way, he didn't think a crowded pub was the place to find out.
Draco staggered, gasping in surprise. He stared at Seraphim with wide eyes, instantly afraid he the alter was angry with him, but Seraphim was smiling at him, his green eyes sparkling with innocent happiness as he huffed a breathy laugh, the only laugh he was capable of - the action so foreign to his abused psyche.
Charlie nodded, a small smile turning up his lips. "Then lets get to work, ladies and gentlemen. We have a lot of work ahead of us."
"Hey, Bill. You lead a team?" Harry smiled at the older man.
Marissa giggled at his disgusted expression.
"Being gay is frowned upon because it goes against the duty to procreate and enlarge the magical community, but it isn't uncommon for people to have secret lovers. In fact, I would say the Pureblood's are encouraged to have a gay lover on the side to relieve the stress of an arranged marriage. That way it limit's the chances of producing bastards to the family line. Are you going to be this disgusted when you come across a situation like that?"
In a room of Weasleys he was not to be disappointed.
Ah yes, the Merfolk of the Black Lagoon just wanted to remind travelers to the area to please refrain from attempting to feed Nessie. Grain and grain by-products are not part of the natural dietary habits of the large reptile and in fact has been causing the poor girl to undergo some upsetting bouts of gastrointestinal distress. She is currently in the Black Lagoon to visit the Mer-city and will be staying for the duration of the month; the denizens of the Black Lagoon are anxious to make a good impression.
"Lovely voice?" The normally silky voice cracked and squeaked as he repeated the compliment that Harry had snuck in without much thought (it was true. Otherwise, Draco probably would have quickly been replaced with a more radio-friendly voice, regardless of his father's position — or more likely because of his fathers position since even he had to listen to these broadcasts every single day like the rest of the magical British population).
"Things are very different here, but you'll get used to it," James said, unable to stifle his laugh at the look on Harry's face as he witnessed the exchange.
"They all mean well," Remus offered with a kind smile, referring to the men that were apparently assigned to observe the house.
"I'm glad you find such comfort in my broadcasts," Draco said, sipping his own wine and buying time as he thought over the question. "It's interesting that you ask that, considering —"
Good morning listeners! I hope everyone has been having as fantastic a week as I have. Oh, who am I kidding, you possibly couldn't.
"But then the ministry?"
He wasn't quite sure what he expected — a perfectly normal magical family that Harry had never met before perhaps? — but that was not what the universe delivered to him.
I'd like to preface all this by letting you know that what I am about to say is all objective and true and was approved by the Ministry of Magic. The views soon to be expressed here do reflect those held by station management as well as our ministry and was painstakingly written out by the members of our Vague Yet Menacing Government and so it would please us greatly Draco if you do not read this portion of the document aloud... Oh! Oooh. Well. They really should have marked this better to let me know which portions were instructions and which were the parts to be read aloud. Really now. This cannot be blamed on me.
"And the Vague Yet Menacing Government?" Harry could practically feel the capitalization in the words.
"How delightful!" Harry chirped, reaching out a hand to intertwine their fingers atop the table. "So do I. So, can I interest you in making some new memories tonight?" Harry asked, not even trying to be subtle because honestly that just wasn't him and Draco should know that now.
"Such luster! Much soft!" George fawned mockingly, reaching out a trembling hand to cautiously caress the ends of Harry's hair before turning to faint in his twin’s arm.
"I was just sitting here in my room, alone because everyone else in this house is too busy to spend time with me, and then I heard your lovely voice and realized that you might be interested in what I had to say."
"You can move now," Harry prompted. "Fuck me nice and hard." He continued, wanting to be sure that Draco wouldn't hold back on account of this being their first time together. Harry needn't have worried though, as Draco flipped them over to get better leverage before pounding into him with deep thrusts that Harry just knew he would still be feeling the next day. And then Draco, the absolute dick, would break the pace to tease him with agonizingly slow thrusts, dragging his cock out of Harry inch by inch, making sure the brunette could feel every stretch and slide until Harry dug his heels in and clawed his fingers into Draco's shoulder in retaliation because he had been so close goddamn it. Draco took pity on him — or maybe he was just as close — and bent Harry in half, changing the angle just so and now Harry was babbling and incoherent and Draco was tugging his throbbing cock erratically until they both finally crested.
"It's also where they have the re-education camps. Which the Unspeakables are in charge of," Sirius said, looking uncomfortable at the thought.
The wolves bared teeth that were longer, sharper and more visible — the eyes milky white with amber slit pupils. The deer faces looked a bit too tight, and when one opened its mouth — exposing the tears along its jawline and displaying darkened rotting sinew —, Harry spotted two rows of short, razor sharp teeth. There was also an assembly of cat faced figures, furs dark and disheveled, eyes a bit too human, mouths a bit too big, skin a bit too loose (as if it was pulled on like a mask instead of being the one they were born with).
He looked up and took in the fairy lights (which somehow managed to sneak past the acknowledgment ban), the soft music playing in the background, and the way everyone was dressed. It was this last bit that had Harry falter, suddenly feeling self-conscious and severely underdressed. But then Draco was at his side, smiling softly and guiding Harry to their reserved table and before he knew it, they were sat across each other in a private corner, legs close but not quite touching yet. Harry took note of that before focusing on the vision of Draco — hair soft and silky and falling naturally into his eyes softening the sharp angles of his face and just generally giving off a very different vibe than the counterpart that Harry had been more familiar with. But this was good — it was different and that made everything easier, because Harry could treat this Draco as his own person and it wouldn't be quite so hard.
"You look great," Harry complimented, meaning it. He enjoyed the flush that climbed up Draco's cheeks, noticing that it started from below the mandarin collar Draco had chosen for the evening and that only made Harry wonder if he would be able to see more later on.
Welcome, listeners, to the inaugural broadcast of our brand new radio show. Our society has gone through so many changes and upheavals that it may have been hard to keep up with all that has changed. So, I thought that I would take the time to make sure that we're all on the same page.
"You'll eventually get used to it, kiddo," Sirius reassured, ruffling his hair.
"Which reminds me, I need to bring out their lunch soon," Lily said, standing to make her way to wherever she had been keeping said food.
"They said it makes it hard to look in," Harry explained and received a nod of understanding in return.
The wispy cloth — for that was all it was, regardless of the fact that it was fortunate enough to be given the duty to decorate the entrance to a mysterious portal — had seemed to be taunting Harry.
"Sorry, but all I could think about tonight was having you inside me, so let me be a little selfish and then I'll make it up to you?" Harry asked, ready to beg if Draco was undecided. Luckily Draco didn't even seem that bothered by the suggestion, though that might have had more to do with the sight of Harry preparing himself atop of him, but small victories and all that.
Other times, he would thoughtlessly enter Knockturn Alley, and have to fend himself against the allures used by the vampires that wanted to use him for a quick meal.
So let's see here. It looks like someone had been spotted in the dog park yesterday — Really now? Didn't I take the time to go over the rules regarding that on the broadcast? Tsk tsk — and had managed to escape without any injuries, thankfully. The Unspeakables are understandably very upset about this occurrence and have written to their liaison with the government requesting that the figure be returned so that they can study him in greater detail. It appears that he is yet another traveler from another dimension — which is my cue to once again remind everyone that of course there is no such thing as other dimensions. This reality is the only reality you need; it's the one you were born into and it is the one you will die in. The existence of other realities is a myth. Like the existence of mountains. You've never seen a mountain, now have you? Admit it. No, please, lean into the microphone placed in your homes so that your assigned agent can record you denying the existence of mountains. I shall patiently wait in order to give you enough time.
"When he said reptilian overlord—"
He still hadn't explored the screaming forest — for obvious reasons — but that, along with the dog park and the Ministry Building were areas that he was content to leave for the future when he was feeling a modicum more suicidal or reckless than he currently was.
Four Death Eaters broke away from the rest. They were heading toward them and Shadow had a feeling they were going to enjoy breaking through to tear them apart. It was their fault for destroying the prophecy and making them fail their Master, after all. Someone was going to pay for that and it looked like they had their sights set on Shadow and his friends.
Harry nodded and closed his eyes again, willing the imagery of Neville's suffering out of his mind. After seeing that horrific scene, the image before it, of being home and safe with everyone he truly cared about with him out of reach of the world, became all the more poignant.
the man was unhinged? He owed Draco some measure of relief for that alone.
"Don't forget you're a Slytherin," Draco added. He sat on the bed next to his friend and placed his hand on his back. "The world better watch out, remember?"
Severus was still cloistered away working on his mysterious potions project. Sirius and Marissa entertained themselves and worked on the snitch. Shadow and Draco were assigned the task of trying to find out where the other Horcruxes were.
"Lovegood!" Draco snapped, glaring hotly. "What are
The wall came to a sudden stop, the sound of stone settling against stone filling the room with thunder. Shadow quickly trotted around the perimeter, sniffing. He stopped in front of a door and mewled pointedly.
Harry smiled wryly. "Well, no. I need your help to rescue Neville."
"What's he going to do?" the man sneered and drank half his drink. "He's a Muggle."
"It's okay. I wasn't having the best of dreams, either." Draco sighed and rubbed at his eyes. "It's almost dawn. Might as well get ready for the day."
"But then I find out that,
Ron went with her silently.
Standing, he saw he was still in the dress robes and clothes he had put on for the Ministry trial. They were battered, but not too bad. What really bothered him was the musky smell clinging to them. Making a face, he headed to the closet. He grinned. Neville! Stripping, he cast a wandless freshening charm on his skin, then pulled on some pants and a t-shirt of his brother's. They were too big, but baggy felt comforting right now and they smelled like Neville. He was truly safe.
Harry blushed hotly as he jerked out of Draco's arms. Severus stood over by the kitchen table smirking, his arms crossed over his chest, a single slender eyebrow raised.
Harry was missed. Draco worried about him and felt wretched about not being able to help him. He was furious about being ignored, and it had deeply hurt him. Harry winced, his guilt surging twice as strong knowing he'd been the one to hurt Draco. There was no excuse for it. Draco had never hurt him intentionally and he couldn't say the same.
"You could have told me."
"A pleasure to meet you.” Draco bowed slightly. The smile was gone from his pale angular face but not his eyes.
"I'd say you're cruel, but she deserves it," Neville said fiercely. "What's her problem anyway?"
The Knight Bus pulled up and he almost laughed. Maybe his wand wasn't completely worthless after all. He jumped on and shouted his destination before diving toward the back. The bus was almost empty, but the few passengers stared at him as if he were a wild thing. He sneered at them and pushed himself into a dark corner.
he thought desperately.
This is it, guys! This is the last chapter of this installment. There will be a third installment. A kind of long epilogue that follows titled
"The Dark Lord's sanity has disintegrated. This explains a lot, actually. I should have thought of it," Severus murmured, watching his son worriedly. "It also explains why the captured Death Eaters said the Dark Lord was alive but ill. He is still recovering from a second resurrection."
"It was like he was a wild animal. He didn't speak at all. He huddled in the corner, snarling and shaking. He wet himself, he was so afraid," Sirius rasped. He ran his hands through his hair before balling them into fists. "We had to leave the room before he would calm down at all, and then he just collapsed and cried… I've only heard that kind of crying in once place… Azkaban."
"I am not a Master of Potions, but my skills are adequate for the job, Headmistress. I'm afraid I do not need your permission. The edict states that the Ministry may chose whomever it sees fit if the Headmistress does not fill an empty post within twenty-four hours."
"What's the last thing you remember?"
As soon as the bracelet was off, Boy yanked away and huddled, panting and trying to calm down. It hadn't hurt, but being touched invoked phantom pains all over his body. Draco watched this sadly and spoke a litany of calming words. He had just gotten Boy to calm down again when Severus barged into the room.
Bellatrix turned the corner and saw McNair - she knew him due to his remarkably broad shoulders - bent over a hysterical witch. He was thrusting madly, magically lashing her back bloody as he raped her. The rest of those in his group were burning a robe shop down. She was delighted to hear the agonized cries of the people locked inside. She wished she could linger, but she had her own mission to accomplish. Instead she called out encouragement as she passed
"What the…" Harry breathed.
certainly wouldn't have wanted a parental figure of any kind. And, although
"I destroyed it, Ginny," Shadow promised. He took her hands in his while Neville wrapped his arms around her shoulders. "There's nothing left of that Horcrux. He's not in you anymore. You're clean."
"Someone came into the room I was being held in. The lights had gone out long ago, it was pitch black, so I didn't see who it was. Well, I had been waiting for a chance like that and attacked."
The teen spun to face the door. Heart pounding, he cleared his throat and called out, "I'm almost done. Be right there." Hearing his father move off, Shadow turned back and splashed his face once more, grabbed up his baggy jacket, and pulled it on without looking back into the mirror's depths.
"What are your plans after lunch?" the curly-haired teen asked innocently.
Draco considered, but decided the few who knew about the Chamber the better. It was still Shadow's home base, so to speak. A thought slowly dawned on him. "She's going to have to replace those teachers."
"You do realize that when I tell Shadow you wouldn't come see him, he's going to think you hate him and that something is deeply wrong with him."
Shadow tapped the scroll against his thigh thoughtfully. "Voldemort knows we are after the Horcruxes. He has to due to the break-in. If I were him, I'd have checked all my other hiding places. He must know we've destroyed almost all of them by now."
The blond lowered his head in respect. "The match is a good one. I wish you both prosperity and wellbeing in the future."
"Careful where you're sneaking," Sturgis tried to say sternly, but his lips twitched up into a smile.
"Wait. I'm coming with you," Draco called, hurrying after his teacher.
"Move," Seraphim growled.
The world faded away. Eyes wide, absolutely shocked, Harry could only stare at the man before him. This man had fought for him, had helped him learn who he was and helped him heal the damage in his mind. This was the first person to celebrate his birthday with him, the person who had given him a home. He was secretive and almost too clever, but he never put himself before Harry's needs. At least, not since the whole Black disaster in Third-year.
Draco paled a little bit, attesting to his true state of nerves, but his expression never wavered. "Don't worry about a thing, Shadow. We have this in the bag."
The redhead cast Enervate quickly and Neville opened his eyes with a loud gasp and sat bolt-upright, panicked.
Severus stared, face pale, while Draco's mouth literally hung open.
Harry grinned at his friend. The blond was disheveled, his shirt torn open along one shoulder, revealing almost half his chest. Dirt smudged one cheek while dried blood made his hair stick up right above his ear.
Draco looked over his shoulder at him. "The ritual room. They're doing something big in there. I haven't found out what yet. You ready?"
"You mentioned he was progressing," Severus reminded. "His condition is improving?"
"He's innocent," a witch with multi-colored hair whispered to him. "Pettigrew set him up. Remus got Minerva in contact with him when you and your dad went missing. Sirius is one of our best scouts, always has been. He's my cousin, didn't you know? I'm Tonks, by the way."
"That's fine." Hermione turned to go but stopped. She looked back at him and smiled. "Thanks, Shadow."
This letter was not as revealing about the world, but it did have more information about this "old crowd" and McGonagall. Again he passed the note on. Hermione's letter had already been handed off to Sirius and Remus who were reading it at the same time. Draco stood by them impatiently, obviously planning on reading it next. Shadow opened the last envelope.
Reversing the Animagus Transformation, Neville stumbled forward, falling to his hands and knees in the snow. Gasping, he shook, readjusting to the sense of human arms and legs, breathing lungs. It took a good ten minutes before he had the strength and coordination to stand. His feet and hands were frozen through, but he managed to make his way to the dilapidated house on the hill, only falling four times. He was just about to reach for the door when something crashed into his back. Neville fell sideways, crying out and raising his arms to fend off another attack.
The dreams of the past week had given him a new perspective. He could almost understand what Seraphim wanted and it wasn’t so bad. He wanted safety. He'd even be pitiful if it weren't for Seraphim's sheer power; power that could help Shadow if he trusted just a little bit.
By the time he was back in the Chamber, his outrage had turned into something harder, colder. With utter certainty, he knew Umbridge and the Carrows wouldn't survive this war. He'd see to it. He pushed aside his new determination as he reached the side passage. The door swung open and Draco felt a grin stretch his face. When Godric had alerted him to his love's arrival, he hadn't really believed it.
THE FOX : George Weasley
The naked body lay twisted at the waist, arms spasming to the right, his legs broken almost in half in three different places; still… so still… so covered in blood and bone chips…
"But how can we trust them?" Cho asked.
"What?" McGonagall demanded furiously. "I'll look into this immediately. Remus, will you help Shadow with the Pensieve? Bring me the image of the stars as soon as possible. Fred, George, go to Hogwarts and get Madam Pomfrey. I want her to check Shadow over. Ginny, can you return home and bring back your mother? We're going to have a meeting tonight and we'll need a large dinner."
"The world would do best to get out of our way.” Draco smirked, repeating what Shadow told him long ago. "We're in this together."
Draco smiled at Seraphim warmly and the alter smiled tentatively back.
"The name isn't an accurate description of what the potion will do. In actuality, it induces a coma-like state. A variation of the Draught of Living Death," Severus answered calmly. "I will be explaining it in more detail to Shadow later, but I'd rather not tell the other boys just yet."
"Well, that's why we were arguing," the girl said, still crying softly. "She came back from the bathroom at the Three Broomsticks holding it. Said it was a surprise for you and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it though and I cast that curse detection spell… you know…"
Narcissa bowed her head in acquiescence. "May I write him a farewell? He does not deserve it, but it would soothe my grief."
After dinner, Severus had everyone gather in the sitting room. Shadow stubbornly held his Animagus form while his father explained what he had discovered at Headquarters and what he had constructed as their cover story. He also told them about the Ministry’s Inquiry they had to attend in a few days and about having to stay at Headquarters for the rest of summer. Needless to say, there was enough information that everyone found something not to like.
Shadow scowled up at him. "Shut up."
"Look. Mad-Eye had his faults," Charlie told them sternly, meeting their eyes, "but he didn't just die. You should remember that. He was murdered; Shadow killed him. I'm not saying what Moody was doing was right, but we don't know what's going on with Shadow and that's dangerous."
didn't stop him from hurting, maybe he had to find the thing that hurt and put it right.
"What?" Hermione stopped and stared at her best friend. "Well, let's go!"
"The spells. This is not the work of our allies."
"What?" Shadow blinked his strange eyes innocently.
Shadow felt a fierce burst of affection for his friend and a deep gratitude that he was still, even after all this, standing by him. "Morning," he murmured. "I figured out why Severus hasn't come by."
Shadow nodded. He looked to the twins. They had been whispering to each other for the past few minutes. He raised an eyebrow but decided not to ask. He most likely wouldn't want to hear the answer. "You guys okay with setting this up?"
"The Terrible Twins!"
Harry didn't say anything for a minute. "No. Not yet."
What did Severus get in return? He got treated as a criminal by the Ministry and had to taint the memory of his beloved and cherished wife. He was forced to constantly exhaust himself keeping Shadow safe and healing his broken mind.
"You do know there is no such thing as a Snorkack and that the shell won't take pictures," Rogan asked to be sure.
"Have you seen your brothers?" Hermione asked her.
Umbridge waited until Alecto left the room before continuing. "They constantly rebel against authority and their disrespect for authority is astonishing!"
"Let's do this thing!" Sirius cheered, ecstatic to be doing something to help.
"Okay, we need to sign the Secrecy Scroll, but not all of us. I want you all to vote for one person from each House that you feel can be trusted without a doubt to keep this secret on their own. That way they can answer questions for anyone new who wants to join, but I warn you. Choose wisely. Don't pick someone who might tell Umbridge. We don't want to get caught and expelled."
Lillian scowled suspiciously, but Miles smiled in welcome. "Shadow! Merlin, that's crazy! You could be captured and killed."
"I don't know where to start," Salazar admitted, still staring unblinkingly at the teen. "I've never seen anything like this before. Your condition truly is remarkable."
The elf disappeared without a word just before he was speared on Seraphim's magical hair.
"For all intents and purposes, he is," Shadow countered. "Listen to me carefully, Draco. I will
"But it's a good idea," Hermione protested predictably. "We need to learn how to defend ourselves. There's a war going on and…" She took a deep breath. "I want to be able to stand at my friend's side if he has to go against Voldemort. Harry's going to come back. I really need to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts."
Slowly, the tension in the room eased. When Shadow felt he could face the conversation again, he cracked open his eyes to see Severus holding his tea cup while staring off thoughtfully. He smiled and sat up, drawing his father's eyes. "So what have you been working on? You've been like a ghost walking around here."
"I hate it when you're right," he mumbled, and then more loudly he added, "When are you going to talk to me about what happened with Seraphim? I can tell it's still bothering you."
The Triad said nothing as the woman left with her grandson. Neville smiled at her, half-dazed that she had come, but she frowned at him in answer. Without a word, she took him straight to the floo. They stepped out of the fireplace at home and she put him firmly on the couch. Neville stared up at her dazed. It felt like he had never left the interrogation room.
They entered the Great Hall and headed over to their seats. Happy chatter filled the Hall as everyone ate and talked about their weekend and complained about the week ahead full of homework and tests. Shadow and Miles were discussing chess moves when Umbridge stood up, tapping her glass to get everyone's attention. Shadow shot a look at the Headmistress as silence descended. McGonagall didn't look happy.
he thought smugly and he happily speared a piece of watermelon. He loved house elves. He really did. He didn't even care about the headache anymore.
Suddenly, without warning whatsoever, his wrist was snared and he was yanked sideways into a dark unused classroom. Neville let out a startled cry and fumbled for his wand, eyes wide with terror. Light bloomed, blinding him further, and he flung himself backward, crashing into a broken desk, and tumbled to the floor. Soft laughter tinkled in his ears and he blinked furiously, blood rushing to his face as his heartbeat slowed to a more reasonable pace.
needed to apologize to his brother.
"What else?" Severus prodded.
"Go, Alastor. Spread this message to the others you've been whispering with. Yes. I know of it."
Augusta nodded. "Very well." She looked down at Neville. "I'll be back with some food."
"Okay," Draco whispered, honestly afraid that Seraphim would hurt him. "Okay, Seph. I won't leave again."
Draco wrote back.
"What!" Draco felt the adrenaline leave his system and he grinned back. "How?" He followed Shadow eagerly toward the Potions study, listening eagerly to the description of accidentally breathing on it and then remembering what Firenze said. Before Shadow could finish, Draco figured it out himself. "You have to put it in your mouth! It's the first snitch you caught!"
"Okay." Luna smiled and smoothly rolled her sleeve up.
Draco limped into the Chamber of Secrets with Remus staggering after them. He thanked Merlin for the charm Shadow and he had made to let him into the Chamber. If he'd had to hike one more mile through the Forbidden Forest looking for the outside passage of the Chamber, he was going to scream.
rescues me, not just you." Shadow smiled faintly, noticing the pouty expression behind the blond's bad attitude. "I need to be able to defend myself, but I shouldn't take that out on you."
It took actual concentration to get his body working in sync and to get to his feet without falling. Severus felt like he'd been ill for a long time and was only now recovering. Weak didn't even begin to touch on the pervasive feeling saturating his body. Carefully, he stepped from the room, his robes, with the left sleeve still torn off, swirling around him as he moved. The familiar sensation was deeply comforting.
"I'll tell what you were doing in here. I'll tell your brother, your heart-father, and I'll tell the Headmistress."
"You might want to take some time out of your busy schedule to actually check on your son. He's been very withdrawn recently," Draco said with challenge in his eyes.
At this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild, little laugh of utter relief.
"Maybe, but it's not that simple. Seraphim is sometimes difficult to handle, but he doesn't deserve to be locked away and forgotten. He suffered greatly. You suffered greatly. That deserves to be recognized. And if I can help him…
Severus pulled the cloak back on and hurried onward, not daring to question his good fortune. He needed Shadow to keep moving. If that meant encouraging anger, then so be it. He just preyed his calculations weren't completely off. It was so easy to get turned around in these blasted, spell-resistant tunnels. He was certain a way out was close by, if only they could find the godforsaken thing!
"The longer he's gone, the more likely we will never see him again," Remus argued dully. He had no energy left to get worked up.
Draco sat in a green one and smiled in appreciation at Shadow's transfiguration. The curl-haired teen smiled wryly back. It wasn't his best skill. Considering that, he took the grey chair and gestured Neville into the other green one. If the transfiguration didn't hold, he didn't want his brother to be dumped to the ground.
"What did?" Shadow asked, smiling. "You said you wanted to try something and just took off."
Shadow stood tiredly beside the door to the courtyard in which Neville was practicing his Earth magic. He smelled of potions, reminding him of the grueling past hour. He wondered if the woman who had tested him was related to Severus somehow. She was extremely exacting and her preoccupation with whatever crisis that had called for her to test him tonight instead of tomorrow had her in a foul mood.
"Bloody bastard broke into my head! Can't use the compact like a normal person, oh no!"
Draco grimaced and tilted his head as the alter twisted his hair to get a better look at his bruised cheek. Draco had been distracted with worry and hadn't thought to put healing ointment on it. Seraphim touched it gently, aching with the need to heal it and unable to. This was his fault. He had sworn to protect Boy and he had left him in his panic.
But no one was around to hear. Sobbing, terrified, he could only fight helplessly against the fury of the seizure. White, blood-speckled spittle foamed at Shadow's lips, his eyes rolled wildly under his lids. Then, without warning, the seizure started to lessen until Shadow lay unconscious on the ground, faint tremors still running through his muscles every few seconds.
"No!" Draco gasped and spun to look at it, horror in his eyes.
Shadow accepted Draco's hand and forced himself not to make a sound as he got to his feet and tottered out of the room. Draco flicked his wand behind him, raising silencing wards. Shadow smiled grimly, knowing Draco was absolutely correct. They would be completely necessary in a second. He clenched his hand around the Slytherin's arm, stopping them in the unfamiliar hall.
Bill frowned. “He left a hole in Lestrange’s chest."
Neville curled forward over his brother's lifeless body and began to sob.
Shadow allowed it and rested his head on the strong shoulder. Shivering, certain he was going to be sick, he confessed the truth, "I thought… I thought I had accepted that it wasn't my fault, that Kit couldn't help it… but I guess I haven't. Remus helped me see that touch and physical comfort was good, so I took her back, but I never really accepted that some part of me… any part of me…” His hands were shaking violently now and Severus clasped them in his own to still them. "…would like what Lockhart was doing…” Shadow had to swallow hard to keep the bile from rising in his throat. "… no matter how good sex is supposed to feel, how could I not recognize - no matter who I was at the time! - how wrong that was?" It was too much. He couldn't take anymore tonight. Shadow pulled away, trying to escape it all.
"Leave me the fuck alone," he growled lowly at his reflection. "I'm not letting you Out. You hear me, Seraphim?" The dull ache in his curse scar continued to throb and Shadow bared his teeth.
"But… Voldemort…" Harry spluttered, shocked.
"Any leads on who the prankster is, Dolores?" McGonagall asked as she sipped her tea.
"I hate to interrupt, but… I think I have a problem."
Severus tensed, his face blanking completely. Even with his shields up a full strength, Shadow felt a soft jab of shock, fear, and fury from the man, but he didn't question him until they were on the lifts again and riding down to the ninth level, which was ominously the only level under the Entrance Hall. Great, even deeper under ground. Shadow felt his stomach tighten with apprehension.
Shadow sat there, silent, as his heart rate picked up. On one hand, he remembered the carnage from yesterday and it sickened him. He didn't want to willingly be a part of anything like that. On the other hand, his body was a maze of torment that would fade with time, but would never disappear completely. The only way to completely ensure his wellbeing was to stop them permanently. He was saved from answering when the door opened and Draco slipped in, shutting the door behind him.
Marissa nodded and yawned. "We'll make him feel better."
"Draco!" Shadow exclaimed horrified.
"That's not good news." Charlie frowned deeply. "There are still two left: the diadem and Nagini."
"DRINK IT!" Sirius bellowed right in his face as he continued to pour.
Molly nodded distractedly and herded her family into the room. Shadow got a glimpse of the room beyond. Mr. Weasley was sitting up, supported up by a few pillows, in a hospital bed with blindingly bright white bandages wrapped around his torso. His face was pale and tired, and his hair was greasy and limp, but his smile was genuine as he watched his family enter.
"Look what you did," he heard Hermione hiss. "Not everyone knows what we know about Sirius."
Draco sat absolutely still. His father had drilled it into him not to give away anxiety or discomfort. It could be used against you. Pressed to the wall, all his Pureblood lessons were back full force. He tried to make his face blank, expressionless, but tension trembled at the edges of his eyes as he met his love's troubled gaze. He had to give Shadow credit. His seemingly open comments were really heavily weighted to make him feel guilty. How very Slytherin; an attack disguised as an innocent invitation to honest discourse.
"I'm ready. Okay? Let's do this."
They had only two Death Eater prisoners, and both of those were lower members. They were being interrogated by McGonagall, but there was no real hope that they would have very important information. The death toll was high. Four Order members had passed on, along with two Aurors borrowed from Fudge. The final tally for reported deaths of Death Eaters was at eleven. Not nearly as high as they had hoped.
"…and not really a Defense professor…"
Her first act as a member of the Wizengamot had been to lead the discussion of what was to be done to protect the Wizarding World, and to a lesser extent, the Muggles. After nearly eighteen hours, in which there had been few breaks and many Pepper-Up Potions, they had finally worked out security measures for flooing and Apparating, as well as stricter policies regarding dangerous magical items and potions ingredients. Of course, many people were going to be displeased with the activation of martial law, but they'll be more upset about the magical drain required of them.
"I believe that your hate and anger built on the faint personality imprint already placed on the energy of the Killing Curse," Salazar continued, uncaring about the distress his information was creating. "In essence, I now believe that Demon was always a foreign spirit possessing you, but by linking to Boy - his opposite - Demon became attached to you."
Ginny was the first down the ladder after him. She smiled sheepishly and apologized. He waved it off, but stopped in mid-gesture when he realized that he had picked up Severus's mannerisms. Then he continued it, knowing it would look weird if he didn't; though he felt a bit uneasy about how much Severus was influencing him.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked.
"Griphook has something to say," the teen said tiredly, his eyes not meeting anyone's in the room.
"Do you think he can see through girl's clothes?" George grinned lasciviously.
Silence.
Severus sat up, eyes wide and wand aimed, startled by his son's voice. "What do you think you're doing?" he demanded lowly.
"A nightmare," Draco whispered, glaring. He didn't appreciate the man even
Talk began instantly. Umbridge was so infuriated that she could only sputter. Carrow's smile was gone and instead she stared around her with cold anger, making the students near her back away quickly. Before McGonagall could answer the accusations of the Ministry appointed High Inquisitor, Filch walked in with a Weasley twin in each hand.
"…There is nothing here about practicing defensive spells."
"How'd you sleep?" she asked softly, coming up behind him and staring out at the neighborhood and lawns. Most still had Christmas decorations up.
"I was eight or nine," Shadow began, projecting boredom. "I was tired of being in hiding and wanted to play with other children. I escaped the safe house and went into a Muggle village. My tutor had to contact my father and tell him I was missing. Father made an excuse at school and came home immediately to help search for me.
"I know." Harry smiled and stepped up to his lover. Standing on tip-toe, he kissed the blond's cheek and wrapped him in a quick, warm hug. "Same for you. Be careful, Draco."
"Look, we're not going to be practicing alone," Shadow explained as if to very stupid children. "We're all going to be watching and learning from each other. There's no point in purposely trying to hurt each other when so many will be there to retaliate."
Sirius looked up at his old enemy with surprise. He had known the answer would be a rejection before he had even asked, but he had spent a lifetime speaking before thinking. Therefore, it took him almost a whole minute and for Severus to lift an eyebrow with cold derision before he realized he had been given what he had asked for.
There was a long pause, but then quick words appeared.
"Within two months, I proposed to her and she resigned from her job. I had been building this house in secret from the moment I crawled to Dumbledore. I knew I might need a place to hide. I was terrified when I started creating this place. It wasn't until I married Amalia that this house seemed at all pleasant. We finished it together. It took about seven months. When we weren't working here, we were traveling around the world. I was learning to be human again and she was exploring cultures she never had a chance to touch before.
"Hardly," Severus sniffed and lifted his chin. "He is Slytherin, through and through."
A gasp was heard, painfully reminding them that they were not alone in the room. Shadow's head snapped up, jerking away from Draco's descending lips. He just managed to catch sight of the door to the entrance of the Chamber closing on the back of his brother. Shadow felt the blood drain from his face and he yanked away from Draco as if burned.
Harry grinned. "Yeah; a toddler.”
Shacklebolt frowned severely at him, no humor at all in his expression. "Regardless," he said again with a voice as hard and cold as glass, "we expect some consideration on your part."
"We're not trying to harm Harry, Nev," Ginny said, hurt in her voice and written plainly across her face. "We're not the enemy."
"You said the locket was well guarded. You and Sirius were stuck there for almost a day getting past the defenses. Was Regulus such a good wizard? He had to have help, didn't he?
"Just washing it aside… all of the helplessness inside! ... Pretending I don't feel misplaced! … Is so much simpler than change!…" His voice pierced straight through Draco. "It's easier to run! … Replacing this pain with something numb! … It's so much easier to go… Than face all this pain here all alone! … It's easier to run!"
The sting caused Shadow to gasp and reach up to pull Draco's chest flat against him. He arched up against the weight of Draco pinning him down, his whole body trembling with sensation and sudden heat.
"I want you all to concentrate on your breathing. Consciously take control of every breath. Breath evenly, deeply. Cut everything else out of your awareness."
Fred and George exchanged a glance. They couldn't really leave them here now. They could tell somebody. The best plan would be to floo them all over to Neville's and let him decide. They could Stupefy them or something and leave them there where they couldn't cause trouble. Decided, the twins began to grin.
"Well, come in. Don't just stand there."
one who matters to me. I'd never hurt him and I won't let
Severus nodded, pretending to believe the obvious lie, and offered a smile, trying to ease the tension in Shadow's shoulders and face. "When Amalia and I came together… It was awkward at first. We were both so excited and nervous. She elbowed me in the face when we were trying to get her shirt off and I unknowingly made her leg fall asleep by cutting off her circulation during foreplay."
"Cake?" she offered, stepping back and making her eyes wide with hope.
He smiled as he saw that Neville had erected a strong Tectussitum shield and rooted it into the stone under their feet, freeing him to continue casting offensive spells behind the shield's protection. Very clever. Neville may have weaker than average attack power, but his talent for defense was extraordinary. The ability to root shields in the earth gave him a huge advantage.
THE COYOTE : Fred Weasley
The smaller male had proven himself to be a capable hunter as well as a good leader for their fledgling who had obviously flourished under his care. The scent of his distress when they had arrived at their nest had him feeling very protective. He'd known then that he was ready to mate for life with this incredible male.
"No?" Neville scowled, pushing past Ginny to get in his face. "You said you'd be a better friend to him, but look at you! You're all over him for being a Slytherin! And you won't accept that he's made a better life there!”
Harry's eyes flashed up, instantly furious. "Sulk? Is that what you think I'm doing?"
"I am working on a potion that will suppress his new DNA and return him to his birth DNA and back again. That would make him secure against any diagnostic spells since it is not an illusion."
Shadow followed him to the bed of blankets. Marissa was watching them and she giggled. Shadow accepted her into his arms as she crawled onto his chest. He held her there, and Draco threw an arm over her back to help steady her. Despite the anxiety tightening his chest, Shadow held her tightly and closed his eyes.
This was the seventh session Draco had with Boy, and for the past four, he had been trying to get the child to interact with him more. He had a Wizarding children's toy and had been trying to coax the child into playing with him. At first the problem was that Boy didn't understand the concept of play. He just watched blankly as Draco put the colored balls in the corresponding slots, making small colored fireworks shoot out forming pretty animal pictures.
"I'll never be all right," he said exhaustedly. He walked back toward the tub and sat on the side. "I wish this nightmare would just end."
These were his closest allies; the people he counted on most to get him through this. Looking around, Shadow realized that he wasn't worried that they'd fail him. If anyone could help him beat the odds, it was them. They just had to be careful. Their next moves had to be perfect. Voldemort wasn't back, but the Death Eaters were, and he had to make sure Severus stayed just out of the Ministry's reach.
"Sirius revealed himself to the Order and they accepted him back into their ranks. The Headmistress is allowing him to impersonate me again."
Still, he was really nervous about the confrontation, so he put it out of his mind as much as possible. He focused on the DA and his school work. Every weekend Draco had a session with Boy, and they went to the third Quidditch match of the year, the Slytherin-Hufflepuff Quidditch match. Slytherin won by sixty points, Draco catching the Snitch an hour into the game. Of course it reminded Shadow of his longing to fly and he decided that there was no time like the present. They agreed to meet Wednesday at the Pitch half-an-hour past curfew.
Harry took another deep breath. "We had been fighting and I felt so raw. One thing led to another and we were kissing. Nothing was better really, but I love him. Things got heated as it always does with us. We lose control, but he keeps me with him when the… pleasure gets to much." Harry was bright red with embarrassment, but he had to get this out. "I enjoy it. I do. I love the way he looks. I love the way I can make him gasp and squirm. I love making him feel good. I love the fact that he understands and knows what to do to keep me there with him and not slip away into the past or my fear."
Shadow put on a concerned expression. "If you need to take back whatever you got me, all you had to do was ask."
The Slytherins felt the political tension and speculated on it. Was McGonagall just trying to find a new way now that she was Headmistress or was her attitude due to her taking a subtle stance against Umbridge and in extension the Ministry? They also wondered if the twins were the sole masterminds behind the prank. Usually the twins were flashy and loud. The fish were flashy, but there was a Slytherin air about them that had never been a part of the twins pranks before.
Draco had almost
Shadow was pleased. He had already thought that the feud between Gryffindor and Slytherin, though sometimes entertaining, was mostly a hindrance. Out from under the watchful eyes aimed at him and the expectations thrust at him for being Harry Potter, he was free to maneuver in a way he never had been before. It was exhilarating!
"Have you told your Order?"
"Are you all right?"
"I think it's already affecting us. Do it quickly!" Shadow shouted, startling the two.
"I want to let the Wizarding World know I'm back," Harry repeated.
Miles blushed. "What about you, Shadow? Do you play Quidditch?"
Severus smiled as Harry went limp. Feeling the tension leaving his son’s coiled body, he softly cast Lumos. Harry didn't even twitch, so lost in his mind was he. Satisfied, Severus reached for the pack and the healing supplies they had. Carefully he spelled Harry naked and began to apply it to his legs and hips, his forearms and hands. Some burns were worst than others. His knee had no skin at all, bone showing gruesomely. Blood soaked his shins, meaty flesh showing through on his calves. His right palm was the worst, however. Ligaments and tendons glistened wetly in the spell-light.
"There you have it. Please leave." Augusta marched to the door and held it open.
"Still…" Shadow felt tears burn his eyes. "You did all this because you knew I'd need to be Harry Potter again?"
Draco smiled, seeing Shadow's empathetic expression, and reached out and touched his shoulder. "Hey. We'll make it through this crap. We just have to keep it all in perspective. What matters is that we're in this together. All of us."
No one complained about the extra vigorous practice. The attack on Katie brought home the reality of the future they faced. Everyone was more determined than ever to learn how to defend themselves. And because people were beginning to ask around about how Leanne knew such an effective curse detector, more people were joining the DA and binding themselves to secrecy.
"That's ridiculous! I'm fucking CRAZY! I need to be locked up!" Shadow shouted. He could hardly see straight and his fucking chest
"Because it's not in his best interest," Neville countered, eyes narrowed at the redhead in annoyance. "We're all afraid."
Shacklebolt's dark eyes measured the filthy blond for a moment before levitating Remus and Tonks up to the earthen defenses that the teenagers were hiding behind. He had to get his injured Order members and the incapacitated Death Eaters all in one place before he could activate his portkey.
"Tonks?" Neville gaped, delighted. "Really?"
"Neither are they," he retorted, eyes narrowing.
survive her. Her time of power is limited. I promise that you will survive long enough to see her toppled."
The teen allowed himself to be pulled to his feet and followed after the two men. Remus settled him in the sitting room and began tending to his clothes and cuts, casting a flawless stream of magic. Sirius paced agitatedly, muttering every now and then.
Sirius came running up behind him, silently demanding his own answers.
"He used to work in the Department of Mysteries," Severus murmured unhappily.
"Gin, stop. You don't have to go on," Neville soothed her.
It was pitch black; the curtains on the underwater window were firmly closed, but he didn't need light to know where Shadow was. In fact, he didn't even need to see him to know what Shadow was feeling. Absently, Draco wondered if this was what having empathy was like. He had passed a Silencing Barrier and the sound of aimless piano notes surrounded him.
"Snap out of it, Neville!" Remus snapped harshly, stepping forward with golden eyes. "You don't know what you're doing!"
"… my fair and charming cousin, Nymphadora! Who, incidentally, is several years this old rogue's junior."
"This Percy Weasley is certainly toeing the line, isn't he?" Shadow asked conversationally, although he felt icy rage crackling along his nerves that the
Draco nodded and quickly moved past him. He was down the stairs and out the front door in less than two minutes. He walked quickly down the street, wondering what he was supposed to do now when suddenly he was grabbed and Apparated away. Stumbling as his feet hit the ground once more, he spun with his wand ready.
Shadow shook his head, amused.
"Did you hear me? You aren't doing this crazy procedure on Shadow! I won't allow it! And he's not going to the Ministry, either!" Sirius bellowed. He lunged at Severus and lifted the man by his robes, sending the chair Severus was sitting in flying backward with a loud crash. "How could you even consider this? Shadow is supposedly your son, for Merlin's sake! How can you risk him?"
Draco turned and smiled. "You're beautiful, what can I say?"
He just finished when the Reflection Ward evaporated. He noticed the ward before entering Number 4. It was subtle but hard to craft. It basically concealed all magic within, but they were short-lived. It's existence around Number 4 explained why the Ministry wasn't swarming all over the scene yet.
"Still doesn't change the fact that he did," Remus said with a smile. He leaned back in the chair and eyed the Gryffindor. "I've greatly missed talking to you. We've both been busy and I didn't want to make you uncomfortable with the others by singling you out too much for personal chats in my office." Neville flushed and smiled at that. "But if you want to talk about the fight or anything else, I'm here."
She came toward him to give him a hug, but Shadow quickly sidestepped her. His skin crawled and cold sweat broke out over his forehead and on his palms. Her eyes went wide and filled with tears. Ron's face turned redder, his fists clenching furiously.
Later that night, someone else in the castle was being closed in upon, but unlike Minerva who was being hunted by outside forces, Shadow was being hunted by himself…
Luna shrugged and skipped back toward the door. She disappeared into Hogwarts. Ginny frowned. The map had clearly stated Neville was in the courtyard. She glanced around once more but saw no one. Huffing, she followed the crazy Ravenclaw back inside. She would get her answers, no matter what it took.
Boy watched this familiar gesture and sighed softly. He lowered his arms and leaned his head tiredly against the couch, looking up at Draco almost sleepily. "Sometimes I remember and the dark has nothing to keep me from remembering. Then the dark is just another bad place," Boy explained with hitching breaths, silent tears rolling down his grief-stricken face. "Boy is bad and deserves to be punished."
Pale but determined, Draco nodded. He accepted the locket and placed it on the small work table they used last year to dissect the basilisk. His right hand clutched the ready fang tightly as his left prepared to open the locket. Shadow and Severus backed off a few feet, their eyes trained on the blond teen.
"My personal habits aren't in question, I should hope?"
"Thank god we know where the locket is." Shadow's fists clenched and his eyes glowed faintly. "This has got to stop."
"Then why haven't…?" Shadow began furiously, just as predicted.
"Neville, can I talk to you?" Remus asked.
The sound rose over the roar of the unstoppable fire and made the hair on the back of Sirius's neck stand up. A sudden cough ripped up from his lungs. He looked back over his shoulder and saw blue flames licking at the ceiling. Heat poured down his back. Sweat drenched his body as his coughs became consistent. He looked frantically down at Shadow and saw the teen suck in the tainted air at the end of his desperate scream and wheeze.
They flew open again as Seraphim cooed against his throat, inhaling his scent in a deep breath. The alter's hands snuck up his shirt to caress his skin and the sharp talons made goosebumps break out on his arms as they scratched lightly over his nipples and down his chest. Heat began to pool in his stomach and he groaned in annoyance. Now wasn't the time for hormones, not to mention the fact that he didn't want to give Seraphim ideas and get Shadow mad at him.
Umbridge made her way to breakfast Wednesday morning feeling gleeful. She had a perfect way to trap little Snape Jr. into a detention. The little brat was behind her potential Slytherin spies turning silent, she just knew it! Well, she wouldn't let that evil Death Eater child get away with this. She'd punish him and make him realize what going against the Ministry meant!
Panting, Shadow stared at his friend in shock. Draco glared back, his silver eyes molten with anger. A movement at the doorway made them both look over. Blaise, Theo, Vince, and Greg were staring into the room like they had never seen anything so fascinating before. Shadow gasped, horrified.
"Unacceptable," Severus said lowly. "You will handle this, Wolf, or I will. And I promise you I will not be nearly as gentle."
"I… I think he might be right. That Shadow somehow was turned into that creature, but that is no reason to hurt him," Tonks said firmly, her hair turning red with temper as she grabbed her crush's shoulders and turned him around. She matched his golden gaze. "I think I've come to know you well enough by now, Remus. You know more than you're letting on. Even if Shadow were the creature, all I really need to know is that you love him. If Shadow was a true threat, you wouldn't feel that way. He can still be saved."
