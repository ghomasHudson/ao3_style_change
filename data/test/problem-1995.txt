“We collected enough evidence from your underground lab to earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban.” Harry almost laughed when the perp backed himself against the far wall, stuttering out indignant protests as Zach and Harry moved in. “It’s over. You’re finished.”
“Go on then, tell me off. Tell me how wonderful and flawless your life is and how hard it is to be perfect.” She challenged.
“My Lord, if I may,” Snape stepped forward with a cold smirk.  “Perhaps the lesson would stick better if Mr. Malfoy were to...take part in the punishment?”
“Yeah.” George smiled. “We need to at least grab a coffee or something so we don’t fall out of touch.”
As soon as the door fell shut behind him Draco flicked his wand and set the lamps blazing. The dark blues and greens made everything feel like an underwater palace. The peculiar light from the bubble-like lanterns cast flickering shadows across Draco’s skin and Harry stared at him hungrily. When Draco moved farther into the entrance hall Harry’s eyes were drawn like a magnet to his unearthly attractive hips. He made a strained noise as the alcohol entwined with his hormones and he felt his cock twitch like he was a horny fourteen-year-old. Draco turned and looked at him with a strange expression, eyes darkening with lust when he took in Harry's rather hard predicament. Harry felt his blood grow hot at the lecherous want written all over his face. Without a word Draco stepped closer, reaching up to gently caress Harry’s cheek.
“Attempt to interfere again and you will suffer a worse fate.” Snape snarled, flourishing his wand around with a demented relish.
“Good point.” Tracy wrinkled her nose. “I heard Cassius Warrington put his name in. Would have been great if he had been chosen.”
“I missed you too. I’m sorry we haven’t really had time together lately.” Harry picked up a brand new tube of eyeliner and fidgeted with the cap as an excuse not to look at George.
How could the Wizengamot be so incredibly stupid? It was an open and shut case. There was overwhelming evidence. He had even testified under veritaserum. What was there to deliberate over?
Harry rolled his eyes fondly as they approached the table. Dean was racking the balls and Seamus was chalking the tip of his cue with an exasperated expression.
“Yelling and violence aren’t going to get through to them. You just reaffirmed their belief that gay people are deranged freaks! Now, who knows what they’re going to do next?” He motioned uselessly towards the empty street.
Harry asks Bill for a favor and Fleur gets terrifyingly passionate about Harry's mental health. Draco and Hermione share a moment and Draco meets a hot curse breaker.
“Shite, Draco I’m sorry. I didn’t mean-” Pansy winced guiltily when she saw his expression and he sighed.
“Why are you here?” Harry’s tone wasn’t demanding or accusatory, but when Draco caught his gaze his eyes were filled with guarded curiosity.
“Ah, I see. You are afraid to act until they join you?” Dumbledore’s voice gave no sign of weakness, confusing Draco even further.
“I saw what happened. Malfoy and Nott ran into you, not Pansy. So leave her alone, yeah?” Harry sounded like the Hufflepuff was trying his patience and Draco stared openly at him.
Not fifty feet away his Aunt Bella was also dueling three opponents at once. Draco was impressed by the nerve of Granger and Lovegood. They were putting up quite a fight. He was only mildly surprised to see Pansy as their third partner. She gave as good as she got, flinging hexes at an impressive speed. His aunt let out a delighted shriek and he felt an all too familiar spike of panic. That sound was usually the preamble of a gruesome murder. He shot a stunning spell at her as he ran towards them, but missed by mere centimeters. She sent off a flaming dragon to keep the girls occupied and spun on the spot, her eyes growing wide when she spied him. He stopped moving and raised his wand in a defensive stance. She wouldn’t take him down easily. He could at least buy the others some time to recover.
“I wasn’t thinking.” He stated simply. “I feel that was why it worked. I didn’t even consider my motivation, I just took action. I knew that the Dark Lord had to be defeated if I ever wanted to save my son.”
“Wait.” Draco gasped, gently pressing a single finger to Harry’s lips to stop him from forcibly recapturing his.
“She had caught Harry trying to use her floo because it was the only fireplace in the castle not being regulated. She apparently thought he was trying to contact Dumbledore so that they could stage a rebellion and overthrow the Ministry.” Draco made a face at the memory. He had hated every moment that he was forced to obey that toad.
Everything was deserted- the garden, the field, the tent. There wasn’t a soul in sight. The more he wanted to reach the wedding tent the farther away it became until he struggled to cover the miles between him and his destination. Harry was forced to slow down when the tent vanished and the tall grass grew over him, taller than the Triwizard maze. He wandered around aimlessly for a while, getting more and more frantic as time passed because he still hadn’t found Draco.
“You can’t unless he invites you, you know that.” Pansy snapped, pulling Draco into a tight hug. Theo closed him in and suddenly he was enveloped in a group hug.
Harry rolled over, punching his pillow in frustration before resolutely closing his eyes. He willed himself to fall asleep. Eventually, the muted sound of Hermione crying faded into obscurity and Harry was suddenly standing in the Room of Requirement.
Harry gave himself over to instinct. Draco writhed beneath him, matching him thrust for thrust as he felt his pleasure building. Harry grit his teeth, increasing his rhythm as he got closer to the edge. Something hot and wet exploded over his navel and he looked down in surprise. Draco had been playing with himself and now they were both covered in his come. Knowing that Draco had reached completion sent him into his own orgasm. He cried out Draco’s name as he went blind with pleasure.
“That should do it.” Harry fished out the necessary funds and left the baker with a generous tip before rushing off to hunt down the rest of the items needed for Draco’s surprise.
“I don’t know, I’ve never been. I think he might, though.” Harry cast his mind back, trying to remember if Draco had ever said anything about it.
“Insanely.” Draco took a more confident pull on the straw and was gratified that it was just as delicious as the first sip.
“Let's get down to business.” Draco smirked, rubbing his hands together as an unnatural warmth seeped into his veins.
Draco felt blood rush to his face. It was one thing for Theo to know. It was quite another to talk so openly about it.
“Where is Ginny?” Harry didn’t have time to make sure Malfoy and Goyle were alright. He had to finish his mission. “She was supposed to go back into the room of requirement!”
“Here, try this on with…” she handed him a dark blueish-green button-up and moved on to the trouser section, pulling out dark grey cargo shorts with silver embroidery around the pockets. “These shorts.”
“Perfect, grab a goblet and I’ll pour you a splash of wine.” Sirius nodded to the cabinet behind his head. Recognizing a good deal when he saw one, Harry did just that.
Panic prickled at the back of his skull and suddenly Harry didn’t want to let them go anywhere. As soon as they left it would be back to swinging endlessly between pain and apathy.
“Dean never shoots with a partner,” Harry informed him. “And he single-handedly massacres the lot of us every time.”
“Ron. He didn’t take a ‘Support Diggory’ button. I heard him telling off some Ravenclaws for wearing them during break.” She summoned the cushion they were supposed to be practicing with perfectly.
“That sounds lovely. Did you want to do tea this afternoon?” His mother shot his father a quelling look.
“Tomorrow it will be two weeks since our first date.” Draco beamed. “I don’t know if it’s serious- well, I don’t know if he’s serious but I’m hoping he is.”
There was also the fact that he had been blatantly cold to the Weaselette when she asked him for help with her dress, yet had voluntarily helped Draco without even being asked.
“Who the bloody hell are you to talk to me that way?” Vernon turned an impressive shade of chartreuse.
“He comes in here almost every other night. Never leaves with the same man twice. You can do better.” The waitress said as she dropped off his check, following his gaze to where Draco had just walked out.
Draco scowled moodily at the lake. Everything looked calm on the surface, yet within its depths the champions, and more importantly Harry, were facing dangers he could only even guess at.
Draco opened his eyes and grabbed for the essence of dittany. His novice healing spell had stopped the burn from spreading up on the seventh floor, so he ignored that step. He carefully peeled off layers of singed fabric from Greg’s burns and retched at the smell. He cleaned each burn with painstaking precision until no trace of ash remained. Once he was satisfied that the burns would not get infected, he coated them in the dittany.
Malfoy kissed him greedily, running his warm hands over his face, down his neck and over his shoulders while his tongue made itself very familiar with the shape of Harry’s mouth. Harry shivered, gripping Malfoy's hips and trying to pull him impossibly closer. Malfoy grunted his approval before ripping himself away from Harry’s lips to trail hot, breathy kisses  in the blazing trail left by the heat of his touch. He took his time, caressing each inch of skin with his tongue and sucking at it until Harry moaned lecherously beneath him. When Malfoy pulled aside the collar of his shirt to reveal the soft skin of Harry’s shoulder he sank his teeth into it, suckling the flesh as he bit down.
Both boys turned at the noise and Harry groaned when he caught sight of the Ravenclaw girl that had come with Neville.
Malfoy looked up at him with those eyes like fluid moonlight and Harry knew it was all over. He could feel himself starting to reach the peak.
“That’s quite alright.” Hermione said calmly and Pansy wished with all her heart she could become invisible.
“You just want to mop the floor with the lot of us again.” Neville accused, somewhat ruining the effect with his wide, innocent eyes.
“Forcing me to order for you.” His expression softened with a teasing smirk. “Now if you hate it, it’s all my fault.”
“I didn’t. When Voldemort killed me he destroyed the horcrux inside of me. I was given the choice to move on or return. I chose to return.”
Pansy sighed as she slipped yet another useless book back onto the shelf. How was a girl supposed to learn the secrets of nonverbal magic if none of the books in this damned school did more than mention it in passing? She was the only sixth year Slytherin to not have mastered it yet.
A group of rough-looking wizards kept shooting him suspicious glances and he shifted uncomfortably in the booth. He had gone with a simple glamour today, trusting the crowded atmosphere to protect his anonymity. He had changed his skin from bronze to pale, practically translucent- almost like Malfoy’s. He had ditched his glasses and changed his eye color too, so he figured leaving his hair might be alright. It was such a hassle to make it do anything- even with magic. Now he was starting to second guess the wisdom of his decision.
Fred and Percy were backed into a corner, dueling three masked and hooded figures at once.  Without thinking or even waiting for the others, Harry rushed in to help, taking the steps two or three at a time in his haste. He stunned one of the Death Eaters as he ran, spells flying in every direction. When their comrade fell the cloaked figure that had been dueling Percy fell back. They tripped over the fallen Death Eater and their hood slipped, revealing the imperioused Minister of Magic.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry reached out to touch the faint scars spider webbing across Draco's chest that he had given him in sixth year.
“He is my friend, in a manner of speaking. We’ve been through a lot together. He actually hated me when we first met.” Harry waxed nostalgic and Draco was no less confused.
Ron didn't know how the group would react to Draco, and he didn’t want to overstep his boundaries by telling them Harry’s business. He wasn’t sure if Harry wanted them to know. Either way, their curiosity would be satisfied soon enough. Whether it was satisfied with the truth, or a cleverly constructed lie was up to Harry. He could introduce Draco as just about anyone if they both wore a glamor and Ron wasn’t about to blow their cover before they even arrived. He glanced towards the door of the pub and was relieved to see two unfamiliar men heading straight for their table.
Draco didn’t have time to ponder the implications of the Gryffindor seating arrangements, however, as Greg and Vince chose that particular moment to ask him endless inane questions. Gods they were so thick, but they were also loyal. Loyalty was a rare commodity in this day and age. So he bit back his sarcastic replies and lent them his undivided attention.
“Are you trying to tell me you’re royalty?” Harry wasn’t sure if he should be in awe or be amused, so he went for both.
Draco just stared at him. He couldn't think of a damn thing to say. He wouldn't lie to Theo. Not about this. But the truth was too harsh to voice. As the silence grew longer and louder Theo's expression shifted. It went from open and honest to withdrawn and constricted.
“I just needed some air. Too many people in a small space.” He sighed, not even bothering to turn around.
“Mr. Malfoy, how long were you under the imperius curse?” A wizard on the far right called out curiously.
“I’m more of a Mojito man,” Draco shot Harry a quick wink “but I’m not picky. Considering we just had Mojitos, an Old Fashioned is perfect.”
“Because then it would have been over. The Dark Lord would have won.” Draco bit his tongue to keep from divulging anything else.
Draco wakes up slightly hungover from his housewarming party and finds a pile of thoughtful gifts on his table. Narcissa goes into protective momma mode and Lucius comes to terms with how he acted under the Dark Lord's influence. Hermione subtly nettles Draco to do something about his feelings for Harry and Pansy forces him to wear eyeliner.
"Ferret." Ron grinned, somewhat relieved that the tentative friendship they had cultivated at his housewarming party seemed to survive not speaking to each other for almost a month.
It seemed to relieve some of the tension as his father and the girls laughed. Harry was busy trying to rub the dirt off his face, using his spoon as a mirror.
"Oh sweetheart, of course you can count on me." Narcissa stroked his hair affectionately. "What do you need me to do?"
Draco and the Slytherin crew (plus a certain Gryffindor) perform their rendition of the closing scene of the debut ballet Love Drunk, Draco takes Harry on his first trip to a beach, and Harry stargazes for the first time.
“I’m sorry, but are you saying that one of the Malfoys saved your life?” A squat wizard on the far right called.
Harry locked eyes with him and then everything just came pouring out. He couldn't stop talking. He told Sirius everything; about being starved and locked inside his room, about his cupboard under the stairs, about the intrusive thoughts that were getting progressively worse, about the nightmares about Cedric, about his scar hurting and being frustrated about being kept in the dark all summer.
“It’s alright, I don’t mind. I just never pegged you for a cat person.” Harry scratched the precious kitty behind the ears and her purring intensified.
“Well, I’ll be damned.” Dean was staring at the pocket the eight ball had just disappeared into with a look of horror on his face. “We didn’t even get to shoot.”
"Feed that shite to Trelawney, not me." Ron shook his head. "I wouldn't be bloody fine if I just faced off against Malfoy and Snape before the feast is even over."
Death Eaters who would have zero qualms about killing any muggleborn that crossed their path. Unfortunately, Hermione always ended up in just the wrong place at just the wrong time. It was part of her Gryffindor charm; she was a danger magnet.
“I hope not, or you’re going to be rightly pissed when you wake up and find out I’ve been snogging you in your sleep.” Harry snorted, taking a step back to give him some breathing space.
“Very well. The court calls Harry Potter to testify.” Kingsley nodded sharply, motioning for Harry to join him at the high table so he could administer the veritaserum.
“Perfect. That means you’re sobered up just enough to talk about Potter.” A mischievous smirk played at her full lips and Draco let his shoulders sag in defeat.
The wedding. The Death Eaters at the cafe. The dust-figure of Dumbledore. The vision of Draco being forced to torture someone.  One of the Death Eaters they had escaped from.
Molly Weasley had really outdone herself. Everything from the gold and white roses to the elegant wedding bells was exquisite and Draco had to hand it to her. Perhaps the Weasley family wasn’t quite as low class as his parents had led him to think. Even their patchwork quilt of a home was rather quaint. Draco scanned the crowd of wedding guests and his gaze landed on a lanky redhead skulking away from Elphias Doge and a rather stern-looking woman. Without pausing to think things through he took off after him, grabbing him by the wrist before he could escape into the night.
“Salazar, Snape’s going to murder me. I’ll catch you two up later.” Draco didn’t even wait for a response before fleeing to the dungeons.
Draco led him into his living room and Harry almost stopped. His eyes were immediately pulled upwards to the vast expanse of sky that was visible. The vaulted ceiling had been completely replaced with glass panels. Harry could imagine how they would allow natural light to bathe the room in a rich warm glow during the day, but right now they served as a window into the heavens.
"So it's not enough to serve the Dark Lord, now we have to serve the Ministry too?" Theo sank down onto Draco's bed. He seemed to be taking the dark lord's return to power even worse than Draco.
“I’m heading down to the cafeteria. You need anything?” They groaned as they stretched, cracking their knuckles.
The first hints of early evening began touching the sky and they decided that they had had their fill of the seaside. They grabbed an early dinner downtown and explored the shops and tourist attractions. Harry caught Draco slightly off guard with stolen kisses here and there as they strolled through the streets of Sandbanks. He had been somewhat circumspect with public displays of affection up until this point. Harry seemed to prefer holding hands as their main avenue of affection and a quick kiss goodnight in the Vantage at the end of each date. Draco didn’t mind. He was willing to take things as slowly as Harry needed. He didn’t want to jeopardize what they had by trying to rush things or move too fast, so Harry’s sudden desire for intimacy was a pleasant surprise. Every time Harry brushed his lips against the corner of his mouth or stood on tiptoes to kiss his cheek made Draco’s heart soar. It was a perfect day.
“...and it could say ‘Support Diggory, The Real Hogwarts Champion’. Can you imagine Potter’s face when he sees it?” Blaise was gushing, a manic grin making his dark eyes ignite like smoldering embers.
Harry happily let himself fall backward onto Draco’s bed, pulling Draco down with him. He wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist, using their momentum to flip their positions. Once he was on top Harry pinned Draco’s wrists above his head and kissed him dissolutely. When he pulled back Draco strained against his hands.
Draco shares more about his past, two gay guys admit they listen to Ed Sheeran, Pansy and Hermione fangirl over one another, and Draco successfully asks Harry out on a date.
“I know.” He slipped his hand into hers so that they could stroll onto the stage as Tom and Cecelia as soon as they received their cue. “I know I do, but not tonight.”
The classic dinner and a movie. Harry and Draco have an awkward "exes" conversation, Draco tries muggle candy, and Harry explains what telephones and guns are.
“I get it. Trust me, you have nothing to apologize for.” Draco forced him to meet his gaze until he nodded. “Now, how about those showers?”
“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to those foolish enough to continue to oppose me.” with a lazy flick of his wand the Dark Lord set fire to the sorting hat, eliciting a scream from Longbottom.
Harry thundering back down the stairs saved her from having to think of an appropriate response. After one last meaningful glance at one another, they turned to face him.
“That will conclude questioning for Narcissa Malfoy.” Kingsley cut across the mutterings of the crowd. “You may step down from the witness stand, Mrs. Malfoy.”
“Options? I don’t have options!” Draco cried. “I’ve never had any bloody options. From the day I was sodding born I’ve never had a choice. Don’t you understand? He will kill them! He will torture and kill my parents. Probably kill me too if given the chance.”
“I just want it all to stop.” Draco absolutely did not cry. A traitorous tear leaked out and slid down his swollen cheek and he tried to swallow back the onslaught of emotion that was threatening to overwhelm him.
“He isn’t exaggerating.” His father said gravely, handing out glasses of brandy before sitting next to Bill in the armchairs by the fireplace. “Even the house-elves refuse to go in them.”
“Let’s try that again, shall we?” Harry’s voice was filled with harsh amusement. “What is Harry Potter’s greatest weakness?”
“I think it’s good, but I might be biased because he is a friend.” Pansy chewed on her lip nervously.
He had the overwhelming urge to lunge across his desk and ruffle his perfect hair or maybe hex him, but he definitely didn’t feel like opening up.
Harry sighed with relief and threw on the closest set of robes before scrambling after her. He had followed Sirius’s advice and now he was being taken seriously. He almost smiled. That pun basically made itself. Then he remembered tearing into Mr. Weasley and all humor was chased from his thoughts. He would need another chat with Sirius soon. Why- and more worryingly, how- had he been the snake?
Harry had never woken up next to someone before. The twins had never been able to spend a full night with him and he found that he rather liked it.
All feelings of lighthearted banter vanished as they reached the seventh-floor corridor. The Dark Lord's cruel voice seemed to emanate from the walls themselves and the three of them flinched.
“Well, Harry, thank you for another fun day off from studying. I quite enjoyed it.” Draco pulled off the New You amulet and handed it back. Harry was surprisingly happy to see Draco morph back into himself.
“Why?” Draco asked quietly and Harry glanced over at him. He was staring at his hands, his eyes unreadable.
“Believe it or not, Harry, not all Slytherins are out to get you. In fact, no one in our year truly hates you. It’s just this bloody house rivalry and how our parents expect us to behave. It’s all such shite!” She rolled her eyes at him.
“Yes, it’s fine. I know you two have a weird friendship going on and I don’t intend on interfering with it.” Draco sighed in mock exasperation.
“The worst part is that I know better! I know I’m not a waste of space, that my friends don’t hate me, and that you’re not just dating me as some elaborate joke, I know that - but that doesn’t make those feelings go away.”
“If Granger and Potter were dating he would have taken her to the Yule Ball.” Pansy rolled her eyes.
“Don’t tell me you’ve been there this whole time?” Harry sounded affronted and Pansy broke into a smile.
“Steady on, Nev,” Ron said gently, catching him with ease and deftly placing him back into his chair despite already being three-quarters of the way through his beer.
“You left them out.” He sighed, placing the brush he had been using in the jar of now black rinse water.
“Actually you ran into each other. None of you idiots were paying attention.” Pansy snipped impatiently.
“He said he felt like I was hiding something from him and that he couldn’t trust me anymore.” Ari leaned against the counter, staring forlornly into the distance.
With the frequency of Death Eater meetings, she pretty much did. Pansy and Theo had become almost permanent fixtures of his bedroom. Draco was secretly grateful, although he would never admit such a thing out loud.
He gave the Elephant and Dragon one last glance before heading upstairs to get ready. He took a quick shower, letting his hair dry naturally so it hung in his face the way Harry liked, and put on a light layer of eyeliner. Harry had said to dress nice so he put on his tailored black suit with his silk black collared shirt. He decided to forgo the tie unless Harry showed up wearing one. Those things were terribly uncomfortable if worn for too long.
“We’re his army!” Neville cried in outrage “Dumbledore’s Army! We’re all in it together. We’ve been keeping it together while you’ve been off on your own-”
“If any of you have any questions about dancing, I suggest you direct your inquiries to Mr. Malfoy here. He seems to be an expert. You are all dismissed.” He intoned before sweeping from the room, his black robes billowing behind him in a dramatic flare.
As soon as he stumbled out into his kitchen he went straight for the spare parchment in the corner, scribbling a note to Draco.
The bird hooted dolefully and looked pointedly at the window in the kitchen. Draco followed its gaze and shook his head. The crazy owl had managed to get the window unlatched and had left it wide open.
"I know you would like for me to be with Pansy, but that’s never going to happen. We don’t see each other that way; she’s with Theo and I-'' Why was this secret the hardest one to let go of? “I’m gay.” There. He said it. It felt liberating. “I’m gay, and I know what a disappointment I am but I’m done hiding who I am. I’m sorry for lying to you, but I’m through with being scared.”
She did not give up. Her shouts became louder and more insulting, but Draco refused to let Harry go and he refused to turn around and acknowledge her. Instead, he launched into a story about what it was like growing up at the Manor, telling Harry about the time Theo and Pansy couldn’t find him in a game of hide and seek because he had climbed one of the trees in the back acres. By the time they made it to the top of the stairs the lady was calling out for others to be as outraged as her, but Draco refused to give in. Eventually, the ruckus she was causing attracted the attention of staff and they sent a security officer over to investigate.
He pushed himself off of the dusty carpet and left without bothering to look at Dumbledore's portrait. He didn’t want to see those pale blue eyes x-ray him one last time. He let the office door slam shut behind him and raced down the spiral staircase. He couldn’t bear to stand still.
That’s what he would do. He would find Hermione, tell her he got tossed in the pool, and take an early leave. She couldn’t possibly be upset with that. He opened the door with an air of confidence. He didn’t have to stay at this stupid party. He was Harry freakin Potter. As soon as he stepped out of the bathroom, however, his plans were derailed.
“Good.” Draco finally let him go, shifting around on the couch until he was laying across it with his head braced on the armrest. “Now take off your suit jacket and lay here.” He indicated the bit of couch that was visible in between his knees.
“Albus Dumbledore destroyed one, Ron Weasley destroyed one, Hermione Granger destroyed one, Vincent Crabbe unknowingly destroyed one, Voldemort unknowingly destroyed one, and Draco Malfoy destroyed one.” He caught Draco’s eye and flashed him a grateful smile. Draco returned it tentatively and Harry felt something blossom in his chest.
“It’s something Mr. Potter said in my defense, actually. When the Dark Lord fell all those years ago, when he failed to kill Mr. Potter as a baby, he never truly died. I simply thought that after so many years of being forced to espouse… certain views, they had truly become mine.” He was a little surprised when Potter had used that argument. It was entirely plausible. Perhaps he was not quite who he thought he was for half of his sodding life. It was quite a shock.
“Young Master Malfoy!” Kreacher squealed excitedly before throwing himself at Draco’s feet. “It is such an honor, sir. I am grateful for finally meeting you at last Master Malfoy sir.”
Draco has a serious talk with his father about Law School, Luna helps Harry do something sneaky, and Draco gets his hair messed up.
Harry stared blankly at his reflection. With his teeth brushed there wasn’t much else to do. He looked haggard. There were dark circles beneath his eyes from all of the sleepless nights and his skin was starting to look pale from never going outside.
“You know it’s not that simple.” Zack sighed. “Especially that Lucius character. He did a number of shady things before the war even started.”
“Bill and Fleur’s. I’m having a hard time imagining a ginger Veela. Can you imagine literally flaming red hair? It would look bloody ridiculous.” She gave him a tentative half-smile.
Tonks, Lupin, Fred, Sirius, Cedric, Hedwig, Dobby, his parents. He could see them again. No one else would have to die in his name. He wasn’t worth it anyway.
There were so few reasons to smile lately that Draco found himself becoming grateful for each and every one. Pansy’s unfaltering optimism despite all logic would always be one he was grateful for the most.
“We have to go.” Hermione’s voice sounded oddly constricted and Harry looked at her. Tears had cut through the grime on her cheeks and she looked almost as lost as he felt. She wordlessly held out his glasses to him.
Harry rubbed mindless patterns on the back of Draco’s hand with his thumb, banishing his doubts as best he could.
“I’m not going anywhere.” Draco reached up to run his thumb along his jawline and Harry leaned into the touch.
"Oh, no. No, you're definitely lame." Draco assured him. "You just also happen to make a good point. I can wait."
“Dumbledore had me study Voldemort’s past because he thought it would help me defeat him. Unfortunately, that’s where my pureblood knowledge ends though.” Harry took another bite of his scone as an excuse for something to do.
“Be my guest.” He snorted. “When they declare it worthless and a waste of perfectly good canvas we can use it as kindling.”
“I used to always watch the Eye any time the Dursleys drug me along to London, imagining what it would be like to ride it to the top and be on top of the world.” Harry said wistfully.
Draco grudgingly detailed everything he had gone through this past year to get them to this point. The old fool was polite! Showering him with praise he did not deserve. What kind of man commends their murderer? Dumbledore’s attitude towards him was almost as sickening as having to kill him…
He could feel a mass rising in his throat. All of the anger and pain and hatred that he had been holding back was contained in that mass. When it broke free Draco was swept away. He felt everything. All of those negative emotions were overwhelming, pulling him closer to the black.
The platform seemed to be sliding underneath him as the train gathered momentum. Harry swore and followed after Tonks, staggering a little on the landing. He managed to look back just in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear. The cold night air felt like a soothing balm to his injured nose and he closed his eyes at the slight sense of relief. When he opened them again Tonks was looking at him in a calculating manner, tilting her head ever so slightly as she finally took in his macabre appearance.
Draco’s eyes were drawn back to Harry’s arm. He had snatched his hand back and yanked his sleeve back down, but Draco couldn’t get the image of the damaged skin out of his head.
“That’s what you get for not completing it as it comes in. My inbox is empty.” They boasted playfully.
“Yeah, alright.” He nodded. He could come up with a viable version of events that didn’t make him look like such a sodding moron by then. “I thought you had the third year Gryffindors and Slytherins then, though?”
“Harry! The man of the hour.” Charlie guffawed, slinging an arm around his shoulder and pulling him into the large circle. “Come join us, we were just talking about Bill’s promotion!”
The man who was with her was trying to calm her down to no avail. He shot a worried glance in their direction.
"Harry? What are you doing here?" Draco's face lit up when he noticed Harry standing there and Ari's heart swelled with contentment.
“It all worked out in the end, she was just what I needed to get over Anthony and now I can enjoy my life without wasting another second worrying about that wanker.” Neville shrugged, taking a drink of his beer.
A small basin filled with water replicated waves crashing onto a miniature beach that was littered with tiny little seashells The backdrop depicted the horizon at sunset and had a small note taped to it.
“Awe, poor baby. Are you hungover?” Pansy smirked, handing him a cup of tea. He took it gratefully, gulping down the hot liquid despite the pain blistering in his throat. He felt as if he could drink the entire black lake he was so parched.
"You ready to head to the Burrow?" Harry pushed back from the table and carried the empty cups and pot to the sink.
“He just won’t shut up.” Pansy huffed, signaling the bartender for service. “He was never particularly loquacious, but now that he hasn’t had anyone to talk to in over a year it’s like the dam broke and he just can’t help the word vomit that comes pouring out of his mouth.”
The muggle whose form Harry was assuming had bland, hazel eyes and he felt this was a disservice to Harry. Draco much preferred them green.
“I’m set to take the mark this summer.” Draco threw a pillow across the room. Pansy tossed him another and he launched it at the opposite wall. “He says he’s got some job for me next year and that I should feel honored.”
“Terms of endearment, right Weasel?” He sent him a cheeky smile and the Weasel returned it, if a bit apprehensively.
It wasn’t even his arm. His entire soul ached. His very being was rubbed raw. He couldn’t feel anything that wasn’t pain. He was shaking when Theo walked in. He stopped in his tracks, took one look at Draco, and was at his side in an instant.
“What happened the night Mr. Potter was captured and brought to your home? What were you doing when he arrived?” The stern witch cut in over the mutterings of her cohorts.
It was long and sweet, but decidedly chaste. Neither one seemed willing to inflict their morning breath on the other. When they pulled apart Harry had to suppress a laugh.
“It’s Ron’s dad, he’s been attacked by a giant snake. It’s bad, he’s bleeding everywhere. This is serious! I saw it happen.” Harry pleaded with her to understand him when she made eye contact.
“That doesn’t mean anything.” Macmillan sneered “Guess now we know our supposed chosen one thinks with his prick instead of his head. Never pegged you for chasing evil skanks-”
“Alright, keep your secrets.” Draco slipped his hand into the crook of Harry’s elbow and allowed him to lead them past the wards so they could apparate.
“He won’t. You can read people almost as well as I can. Do you ever see Potter even sparing him a second thought? You heard him back there, he only defended me because I’m not a Death Eater. Draco is marked, Theo. They are never getting together.”
Harry's nose suddenly felt very cold, then very hot. When the broken bone started to mend itself he had to use every ounce of willpower he possessed not to itch it. A few moments later she placed her hand under his chin to examine her handiwork. She gently moved his head side to side and then nodded in apparent satisfaction. Before Harry could even thank her (again), she was striding down the dark road again at a brisk pace.
“I was originally going to do a picnic in the park, but then I decided that this was more appropriate.” Harry hummed, stretching out next to him and handing him one of the wine flutes.
“That’s shockingly perceptive of him. It’s not a feeling, I know something bad is going to happen. Come on Hermione, I need to make sure you’re safe.” She grabbed her hand, trying to coax her down the stairs.
“Of course I will.” Harry tucked a stray strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. “Of course I’ll stay with you.”
If it wasn’t Sirius’s mirror he would have chucked it out long ago. It weirded him out at first, but now it was just another part of his daily routine.
He placed his glasses on the counter and set to work cleaning himself up. It was a slow process because his mind was on other things. He cast multiple drying charms on his clothes. It didn’t look perfect, but it would do. He looked critically at his hair. Godric, Draco was right. He did look like a drowned rat. He muttered one last drying spell, trying to get the tangled mess brushed out with his fingers but it was no use. Hermione’s carefully applied makeup had washed off and he looked even more tired than before. Maybe he could use this as an excuse to leave early. He was mildly cheered by the thought.
The only real question left was how to tell him. Somehow casually saying it at the dinner table didn't seem appropriate. Should he ask to have a one-on-one chat? Should he include his mother so she could be there for moral support? Was it too much to just come out and say it? How did one lead up to something like this? He considered over a dozen different scenarios, playing each one out in his mind before discarding them as too sappy or too confrontational. When he pulled into his driveway and stared up at the brightly lit Queen Anne Victorian style home with its wraparound porch and A-framed windows a sense of dysphoria settled over him. His father was as traditional as their home- there was simply no easy way to tell him his only son was gay. He would have better luck telling him he was a dancer.
“No!” Draco gasped a little too loudly. “No, the ballet is perfect. I used to love coming with Mother, but that all stopped when I started school. I haven’t been in years.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry automatically reached up to stroke the back of Draco’s head, marveling at the soft texture of his hair.
“Well, then how do you suppose he got chosen?” Tracy seemed equal parts annoyed and genuinely curious.
“I’ll be damned.” Draco clutched the book like it was a lifeline, devouring the information hidden within its pages.
Draco’s apology was cut short when Andromeda threw her arms around him and pulled him into her chest, ignoring the half-full mug of coffee.
She sat back in surprise when a waitress dropped off her favorite latte with a smooth wink before disappearing back behind the counter.
“Morning, Potter!” His partner popped their head over their cubicle, leaning on the wall that they shared.
“That’s a shame.” He tried to smile past the burning in his nose as he tried to wipe the mead off his face without getting it on his clothes.
“I don’t think I’ll ever see enough of them, to be honest.” Harry smiled, then did an embarrassing double-take as Draco came closer. “You look….” he struggled to find the word. “Nice?”
“Oh, erm… I was sort of… saving it.” Harry suddenly broke eye contact with both of them and Hermione frowned.
Of course, there was one persistent thought that popped into his mind as he closed his eyes and faded into the realm of unconsciousness.
Harry took Malfoy's hand and placed it on the back of his head. He tangled his fingers in Harry’s hair immediately and Harry gave another low hum of appreciation before taking his considerable length down until soft white hairs tickled his nose. He gagged again, but it was worth it.
“Oh, yeah. I think I’d like that.” Harry smiled and for a moment Draco was stunned by how beautiful he was.
“Who was it?” She frowned, pulling out her wand. She waved it quickly and a massive silvery four-legged creature erupted from the tip before cantering off towards Hogwarts.
“You’re going to drink it and you’re going to like it.” Ron pushed the mug back in front of him with an evil smirk. “Those are the rules. When it’s your turn to buy we have to drink whatever you pick. Fair is fair.”
“I am too.” Harry sounded equally unsure. “I suppose I should leave you to sort through your...things…” He trailed off awkwardly, staring forlornly at the box.
“These are just the previews, little clips of movies that are coming out soon. Our movie will start after.” Harry whispered.
“I wouldn’t get too cocky, the Library and drawing room are the worst rooms by far. The rest of the manor was a picnic compared to them- including the Dark Lord’s bedroom.” Draco shuddered.
He set to work casting healing and scouring charms on himself in equal measure. The trickiest part was healing his own ribs. They weren’t broken, thank Salazar, but they were cracked from the multiple kicks and the eye Harry had touched was red and swollen. He thanked his lucky stars he was adept at healing, maintaining a steady stream of magic until all of the throbbing stopped. He studied his reflection critically for a moment before deciding this was as good as it was going to get. He put his wand back in its sheath and fingered the stick of eyeliner Pansy had given him after he told her Harry had complimented it. He already had on a light layer, but it couldn’t hurt to touch it up. He gave in, thickening the black lines beneath his eyes before he left to search for where Harry had gotten to.
“And knowing their true names binds them to the king?” She clarified and Draco was impressed with how much of the story she was able to retain. “How can he control Thorn? Does magic even work on dragons?”
“He isn’t ready for help yet though. Charlie went through something like this before he discovered dragon taming. We can’t fix this for him, no matter how much you might want to. We have to wait for him to want to fix it himself. If he doesn’t do it of his own free will, we will only be making it worse. All we can do is be there for him. Just...trust me on this one.” Ron’s brow was furrowed in concern and Hermione was brought up short.
“Ah, but there is a very fine line between love and hate.” She sang before finishing off her second Jameson and cranberry.
“Don’t mention it.” Harry winked before apparating directly to the Ministry, heading straight towards the Auror department.
“I’m doing fine.” Harry said automatically, avoiding eye contact. George caught his eye and gave him a knowing look.
"You spoil me." Draco huffed, reaching into the bag and rooting around in the bottom. He seemed put out when he couldn't find anything and then gave a soft cry of victory when he found it sitting vertically along the side of the bag. He pulled out the large book and ran his hand across the textured pages.
Theo’s soft, warm lips were suddenly enveloping his own as Theo’s hands tangled in Draco’s hair. He was about to push him away when he realized that everywhere Theo touched didn’t hurt. He surrendered completely, shifting their position so that they could be closer. When Theo bit his bottom lip he gasped at the pain. Theo lost no time in taking advantage of his open lips, plundering his mouth the moment the sigh had escaped. Lust began to boil within his veins and he deepened the kiss. Theo’s grunt of approval spurred him to be bolder. Draco pushed Theo back towards his pillows, coaxing him with kisses along the way. When he had Theo right where he wanted him he climbed on top, straddling his hips. When he trailed his kisses down Theo’s neck something hard strained against his thigh.
I apologize for taking so long to update. I started a new career and it has taken some time to adjust to a completely different schedule and I have been wiped. I'm hoping to get back into writing a lot more often, so please don't give up on me yet! To make up for the hiatus I made this chapter extra long. I hope my penance is enough!
Harry’s heart constricted when Fred’s voice took over. He grabbed the wireless and pulled it into his lap as if holding it could somehow bring Fred into the tent with them.
“You’re going to tell your friends I’m your boyfriend?” He didn’t even try to contain his idiotic grin.
How could anyone be so cruel as to mock someone who was mourning the death of a loved one? She couldn’t remember how they ended up in this position. It seemed like lifetimes ago that Lucius came back from a mandatory meeting with the heads of the most notable pureblooded families with a blank expression and a new found cold indifference.
The fight was slowly moving indoors and Draco let himself get lost in the crowd as he transfigured his Slytherin tie into a scabbard.  He sheathed the glittering sword, ruby red complimenting emerald green. He wanted to keep it as a memento. A talisman to remind him that Gryffindors aren't the only morons allowed to be brave. That Slytherins could be heroic too. He attached the scabbard to his hip, tying it around his waist beneath his robes. He was pleased to find it fit comfortably.
“I know, we’re evacuating.” Harry’s voice was like a cooling potion poured on a raw wound and Draco tried not to react. “Voldemort’s-”
Harry couldn’t help himself, he buried his face in Fred’s shirt, holding onto him as if he were afraid he would lose him. George came up behind him, sandwiching him in the middle as he wrapped his arms around both of them. For the first time in almost a year, Harry felt whole. He had his boys back.
“See, this is where I would normally call you an arrogant prat, but I actually agree with you. You’re a sodding genius.” Harry laughed as he flopped into one of the overstuffed chairs Draco had set up in a cluster in the back corner.
“What, that you’re gay? Or that you’re gay for Harry Potter?” His father asked with a straight face.
“I suppose you thought you would make a dramatic entrance now that you’re the chosen one.” He spat out.
“That’s right, look right at me. You’re alright, it’s all in the past. Nobody blames you for what he made you do.” Harry reached out and grabbed his shoulders as he spoke, grounding him and giving him a physical sensation to focus on.
George pulled him in for a bear hug before planting a kiss on the top of his head and shoving him back in the direction he had been heading. Unfortunately, during the song the dancers had all shifted and he ran straight into the one person he wanted to see the least. Or was it most? He couldn’t really tell anymore.
The penguins, however, were simply magnificent. There was just something incredibly soothing about watching them swim around and play with each other.
With all three immediate threats neutralized, the five of them relaxed. Harry rushed to wrap Fred in a hug, thanking the stars that he was alright.
“I’ll keep that in mind.” He gave him a quizzical look, but he was still smiling so Harry didn’t rightly care. “Now...where was I?”
"Let me say this." He implored. When she rocked back on her heels and clasped her arms behind her back he continued. "My family hasn't treated you very well over the years. Growing up, I didn’t even know you existed until it was time for my Genealogy lessons."
"She's Andi." Harry shrugged. "She's grown a little more eccentric and cares a lot less about what other people think since the war."
The restaurant was undeniably intimate and Draco had to give Harry credit. He had never really thought of Harry as the romantic type, but here they were. The lighting was muted and the table had a candle enclosed in an elegant vase as the centerpiece, casting a warm flickering glow over their meal. All around them couples were either conversing quietly or stealing kisses, and a string quartet was playing softly in the corner.
The sun was just starting to dip below the far horizon, painting the sky in vibrant red and orange. Draco drank in the sight of London bathed in the glowing sunset as their pod began to rise. He couldn’t be entirely certain, but he suspected that there was nothing quite as breathtaking as the London Skyline. Much to Draco’s elation, Harry stood behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder like he had at Canterbury Cathedral. Draco placed a hand over each of Harry’s wrists, anchoring him in place. He didn’t know why, but having Harry hold him like this made him feel safe and protected. Harry pointed out major landmarks and tourist attractions that they hadn’t visited yet, whispering trivia in his ear until they reached the top. The view was absolutely stunning. Windows glittered like diamonds from within the inky silhouettes of buildings set against the backdrop of the setting sun and the Thames looked like it had been set ablaze. They could not have picked a more perfect time to ride the Eye. Draco turned his head to give Harry a chaste kiss before leaning his head against his as they stared out at all of London beneath them. It was so incredibly perfect.
Opening night loomed ever nearer. It was only three days away, but Draco felt ready. Madame Juliette did not come clean about being the author, although Draco had begun to notice her subtle hints and purposefully vague comments. She had let Pansy help her polish all of the choreography, which of course gave Pansy the confidence to bark orders at the other dancers. Those who landed a role in the ballet took it rather well- mostly because they saw the benefit of Pansy’s painstaking attention to detail during their group’s audition. Even Zacharias Smith wasn’t the usual pain in the arse because Harry had very publically chewed him out when he caught him trying to bully one of the other dancers. Smith had given Harry a look of deepest loathing before storming off, but he didn’t try to harass anyone else after that so Draco counted it as a win.  All in all, Draco was confident that this would be their best production yet.
“Right,” Harry took a nibble of his scone, unsure if he should break eye contact now that it had been established. “So, er, where do you want to start?”
If you skipped the smut you missed Draco telling Harry he loves him and Harry saying it back. There were also sweet moments of Draco kissing Harry's scars and telling him he finds him beautiful. So. Now you know!
“And I’m beginning to realize you’re not the arrogant twat I always thought you were.” Harry teased.
"Watch me." Harry moved so that they were side by side. "It's all about the footwork. Watch my feet."
“It seems unnecessarily complicated, why not just use muggle coins?” Draco took the token Harry was offering and inspected it. It was thin and cold to the touch. One side was stamped with the name of the arcade and the other side was stamped with writing declaring it to be ‘one token’.
Sod the Dark Lord, Draco was pretty sure an enraged Pansy would be his boggart if he ever met one again.
The entire group erupted in demands that Ron share what he knew. He gave a lazy shrug, hoping to fend off questions he wasn’t sure he wanted to answer.
Sunlight filtered through intricate stained glass windows as Harry watched his favorite Slytherin flit excitedly from the Tomb of the Black Prince to the effigy of King Henry IV and Joan of Navarre. He was like a kid in a candy shop, drinking in the rich history of the Canterbury Cathedral and hanging on Harry’s every word. They had been exploring the hallowed halls of the Cathedral all morning and Draco’s enthusiasm was still unbridled. Harry was glad that he had thought to do some research before bringing Draco here. He wouldn’t have known half of the answers to Draco’s endless questions otherwise.
“The court calls Lucius Malfoy to the stand.” The ex-auror boomed over the still chattering Wizengamot.
The rest of the room should have paled in comparison to the beauty of the night sky, but it was equally breathtaking. Greens and golds and blues dominated the color scheme, giving the room an ethereal feel. All of the furniture was sleek, modern, and matte black. The dull color seemed to accentuate the vibrancy of the rest of the room. The emerald greens and rich blues seemed impossibly vivid and the gold seemed to highlight everything in a bold yet elegant way. There was a telescope and an easel set up in the bay window overlooking the garden and the room was enclosed on all sides by bookshelves.
Harry glanced over at him, eyebrows raised. When Draco didn’t recant the pet name a delighted smile illuminated his face and made his jade eyes sparkle and Draco felt both elated and relieved. He had wanted to say something more intimate but went with sweet yet safe at the last minute. If things went well, they would have plenty of time to work up to using pet names like 'darling' and 'babe'.
“Thank you.” Draco blinked, taken somewhat aback. “I’m sorry too. I’m overprotective and I went too far.”
“Probably,” Harry said encouragingly. “You’re really clever at spells like that. Remember when you charmed your reading light to work at Hogwarts despite all of the magical interference and a distinct lack of outlets?”
George and Fred were Harry’s first love. Nothing could ever change that. They were there for him when no one else was and they helped him through a lot. They shared so much love and affection and passion- but nothing like this.
“I haven’t seen Potter show any preference either way. He might be gay for all we know. Skeeter is a lying cow.” Theo said in a low voice, bending over his fish and chips so he could talk discreetly.
“Difficult is my middle name.” Draco retorted before leading her on stage for their first scene together.
“I’ll be fine I promise.” He jumped up and rushed after the others before she could call him back, downing the rest of the fire whiskey she had handed him. It numbed the ever-present pain in his heart just enough that he might be able to get through this.
“I will.” he vowed, not breaking eye contact until she nodded and released him. Sod the other Death Eaters. He wrapped her up in a tight hug, kissing the top of her head. He was a few inches taller than her now. He was shocked when his father joined them, pulling them both to his chest.
Harry grew contemplative as old memories surfaced, taking on a whole new meaning with this new information.
He pulled Harry into his arms and kissed his hair. If Harry wasn’t ready he wouldn’t push him. Harry wrapped his arms securely around Draco’s waist and muttered something unintelligible into his shoulder.
“Okay.” He said quietly. His eyes landed on the portrait of his grandfather above his father’s fireplace and it reminded him of his gifts. “Oh! Thank you for the painting. I hung it above my mantle.”
"You’ve also been downright chipper lately. It’s weird.” Zach shot him a sharp look before pulling the case folder closer and starting to fill out the required forms. “There is definitely something going on with you. So spill.”
At long last! The final battle (AND CANON) is over!!! DOBBY IS A FREE ELF! I have such plans for the rest of this fic and I am so excited to share it with you all! If you've stuck with me this long, thank you. If you're just joining in, welcome! As always a massively MASSIVE thank you to the two beta readers who are making this fic possible, AlexClio and SandZhark! Alex pointed out a massive plot hole I had written and then both of these AWESOME nerds helped me figure out a way to fix it. I had to re-work a part or two, but all 3 of us are happy with the outcome and I hope you are to!
“Good answer.” Ari nodded curtly. “Needless to say, you hurt him, I'll hurt you. I don’t give a damn if you’re the Chosen One. Have you got that?”
Not even the wonders of non-crippling water temperature, however, could adequately distract him from the fact that he was about to go on a date with Draco Malfoy.
“For a brand new artist without any kind of renown? I might be able to sell it for three hundred galleons. Possibly more if we find the right buyer.” He held his chin in his hand thoughtfully.
"Did she? That's awfully kind of her." His mother smirked and Draco got the feeling she was deliberately not telling him something.
“I could just wear it open, that would solve the shoulder problem.” He suggested hopefully. He didn’t want to have to try on another shirt.
Draco blinked rapidly and looked around, noticing numbly that the parking lot was mostly empty now. Harry was halfway down the block before something clicked inside his stunned brain.
Harry flashed her a grateful look and she shrugged as if to say ‘don’t mention it’. The Weasleys eventually warmed up to Pansy and she taught them all a new game called Egyptian Rat Smack. Charlie and George got aggressively into it which only caused the cards to explode more often. When Charlie lost an eyebrow during a particularly volatile round they called it quits.
Draco glanced over at Harry, utterly confused. Harry looked bewildered too for a moment, then dawning comprehension flashed in his emerald eyes and he started to turn red.
It had taken him six months to grow comfortable with Healer Grey. Now he had to start again with someone new? He was more than a little miffed about wasting an entire session, but he supposed it couldn’t be helped. McGonagall would skin him alive if he skipped out on his mandatory mind healing. The young healer knocked on a handsome mahogany door to their left.
“It’s a delicate balance.” Harry chuckled, sending another ball into a high-scoring circle with ease.
It looked like a box of crayons threw up all over the walls and the fluorescent lights reflected harshly off the white tiled floor, but Harry was determined to see this through. He exchanged a meaningful look with Draco as they found a seat towards the back of the room.
“We can certainly do that. Just give us a shout when you finish a wing and we will follow you to the next one.” She returned his smile before taking her leave.
“Unfortunately, it is not mine to lend out. Perhaps if he agrees to meet with you he will let you keep it.” She winked.
“Delores Umbridge? The head of the Muggle Born Registration Commission? What did she want from you?” A middle-aged witch looked down her nose at Harry and Draco felt a spike of irritation.
Right there at that moment Draco almost felt like he was any normal 15 year old. Laughing in his bedroom with his friends, talking about boys and sports…. Why did life have to become so complex?
Draco’s full lips pursed in a slight pout and Harry’s eyes were drawn to them. They looked soft and pliable and he wondered idly if they would feel as soft as they looked.
“Oh please, don’t insult my intelligence. At first, I thought Pansy just wanted a laugh, getting you to dance with Potter. Then I saw the way you looked at him when you thought no one else was watching. The way your eyes followed him the rest of the night, even if only for an instant. It wasn’t hard to put two and two together.” Theo conjured a blanket and pulled it around their shoulders. The three of them hadn’t cuddled up beneath a blanket since second year. Draco had to admit he had missed this.
“I try not to work weekends, so that should be alright. Sometimes I get called in, but I can probably tell them to sod off if that happens. The head of the MLE is a Potter-rotter.”
“So, I’m curious.” Draco tried to keep a straight face and he popped a vinegar-soaked bite of fish in his mouth. “How is it that you slept through nearly every lesson in History of Magic, but you know so much about muggle history? I was under the impression that history just wasn’t your forte.”
“Like this,” Harry grabbed the blue balloon and brought it down to eye level, pinching the latex so he could poke a hole without popping it. “Hand me that quill, will you?”
An eerie hush fell over the group, spreading outwards from where the lynx had landed. Draco could feel the blood drain from his face.
Sandbanks beach was busy but blessedly not too crowded when they arrived. Harry seemed amused by the amount of sunblock Draco had to slather on before going shirtless in the sun. He teased him about being a vampire but obliged in helping him with his back regardless. At long last, they had reached the water and Draco was pleased to discover he had been right about Harry's reaction. Harry seemed awestruck by the infinite horizon stretching into the endless sky and the waves forever rolling in from eternity.
The Goblet of Fire makes a mistake that changes the course of history. Harry is forced into a binding magical contract and forced to participate in a deadly tournament.
Granger caught the magazine Pansy had thrown at her face, looking dazed. Harry and the Weasel looked at it curiously as the door to the potions classroom swung open. Snape motioned for them to file inside and they all obeyed silently. Draco, Theo, and Pansy took their usual table in the back while Harry and his groupies claimed the table next to theirs. As soon as Snape’s back was turned they opened the magazine beneath their table and started rifling through it. When they found the article they huddled together to read. Harry’s face went from curious to confused, but there was no embarrassment or outrage at the invasion of his privacy. Even Granger didn’t seem bothered. In fact, she was laughing.
"I'll try and help him come to terms with everything before you get home." She promised before pulling back.
On the afternoon of their seventh session together Draco looked unusually grim when he entered his office.
“Got it. A mouthful should be plenty, yeah? I don’t need the whole twenty-four hours.” Harry was peering at the small vial of golden potion curiously.
“Your drinks.” The bartender interrupted before Draco could reply. Harry grabbed both glasses, thanking him before leading Draco to a high-top table.
Draco stared down at his father's letter in horror. Cozy up to Umbridge? Join this Inquisitorial Squad? Umbridge was foul even for a Death Eater. The fact that she wasn't one was somehow more terrifying. Besides, she was after Harry. Draco wasn't dumb. He could see every game and plot Umbridge pulled. He didn't want to be part of her sodding squad.
“No! I won’t stay quiet! Those poofs have no place here, rubbing their perversion in respectable people’s faces!” She seethed and Draco didn’t know if he wanted to hex her or laugh.
"I forgot this was my weekend with him. I'm sorry." He cast Draco an apologetic smile as he poured himself a cup.
Dumbledore opened his mouth to respond but was cut short by the arrival of the Death Eaters. His cohorts. Another familiar wave of nausea washed over him and he swallowed compulsively. They were all chattering excitedly, but Draco didn’t hear a word. That piercing gaze might have left his, but he was still rooted to the spot.
A door appeared and the trio were talking amongst themselves but Draco couldn’t hear what was being said over the din of battle. Once they disappeared, the door stayed visible and Draco swore. He was supposed to cover his tracks! Now he had to follow him in there and try to stop him. Draco cast one last sweeping glance up and down the corridor before motioning for Greg and Vince to join him.
"Brilliant. I've always wanted to go there." Draco gave his hand an affectionate squeeze as they searched for a quiet place to apparate.
It was bitterly cold in the dead of winter. Theo cast an anxious glance over his shoulder. Surely they would have sent someone after him by now? He had been on the run for almost half a year. Perhaps he was safer in the muggle world than he had ever dared to hope.
He recognized his parents from the mirror of Erised and Hargrid’s photo album. They were both gazing at him with identical smiles on their faces. James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was still wearing the clothes he had worn when he died with lopsided glasses and unruly black hair. Lily was positively beaming, her flaming red hair cascading down her back as her green eyes searched his face hungrily.  Lupin and Sirius were both much younger than he had known them in life. They looked so vibrant and carefree.
“You alright?” Ginny sank next to him on the couch with two glasses of fire whiskey. She handed one to him before sipping delicately on the other.
"It doesn't have a time limit either." Harry said excitedly, automatically going into George's sales pitch. "No more worrying about time running out or having to remember to refresh your potion or charm. The disguise is permanent as long as you're wearing the amulet and is reusable so you can keep track of your favorites to wear again and again."
I'm going to stop promising updates because apparently life hates me and I never come through on my promises. I am so sorry, please don't hate me! I'm sorry this chapter is super late, but I hope I made it worth your while!
He could normally read Draco fairly well, but he wasn't familiar with this new face. He didn't look offended or upset so Harry stuck with honesty.
“A volatile potion must have exploded in the potions lab. Why they brew potions on-site and not in a specially built lab…” Draco trailed off, staring at his barricaded door with a horror-struck expression. “Merlin, we’re trapped in here.”
“Thank you, Pansy.” Draco leaned into her embrace, letting her hug bolster his strength. “I really appreciate you.”
“Does this mean that when Lucius Malfoy was in possession of Draco Malfoy’s wand, he became the master of the Elder wand?” The same young wizard questioned.
Draco couldn’t blame him. Growing up he had always avoided his father’s study because it gave him the creeps. There was something about the disapproving portraits of his ancestors and the macabre sculpture his father used to keep in the corner that was unsettling.
“That’s fine by me, it’s my turn to buy a round anyway.” He grinned before loping off towards the bar.
“Oi, shut it.” Harry growled as Neville, Dean and Seamus all joined them at their table and claimed their beers.
Harry and a tall redhead Draco didn’t recognize had appeared ten feet away. Harry was wearing faded tattered jeans with holes in the knees and a dark red tee with the words ‘Pearl Jam’ plastered across the front in big letters. His hair was even messier than usual, but he looked excited and determined as they started to close the distance between them. The redhead was similarly dressed in faded jeans and a plain black tee that stretched across his considerable muscles. His long red hair was tied back in a loose ponytail and he had a dragon fang earring hanging from one ear. Three long scars cut across the middle of his left eye and reached all the way down to his lips, giving the impression of a permanent scowl. Far from being alarming, the scars made him look rugged and strong. Draco tried not to stare, but the curse breaker was hot.
“You’ll want to save some of that to chase whatever unholy shot Seamus plagues us with in the next round.” Neville warned him with a sage expression.
Music started pumping from the boombox as more and more guests arrived. Pansy had invited a decent mix of people, and Draco was honestly surprised they all showed up. There were a few more Gryffindors that joined the throng, Neville Longbottom arrived with a pretty Ravenclaw on his arm that Draco hardly recognized and Oliver Wood arrived on the arm of Marcus Flint. Draco had raised his eyebrows at that pairing, but who was he to judge?
“Right.” Draco picked up one of the white balls, weighing it in his hands and exploring the odd texture. “So you just roll the ball up the table? That’s it?”
“Thank you." She flushed beneath his praise. "Now that we’ve done a shot together, do I get to know your name?”
"It certainly was." Draco grinned, laying on his side so he could see Harry and propping his head up with his hand.
“As you wish.” Draco’s eyes were dark with desire and he pulled them the last few feet down the hall and into his bedroom.
“I’ve been told that once or twice.” He moved off to the side to let whoever was coming up pass and pushed Draco up against the railing. Draco’s breath caught in his chest at the enforced close contact. Harry allowed himself to get lost in his captivating silver eyes before capturing his lips in a chaste kiss.
“Ron! It’s your dad- He’s been attacked!” Harry was shaking so violently that his teeth started to chatter.
The two spells collided in mid-air, sounding like cannon fire. Draco watched the Elder wand arc high, dark against the brilliant sunrise. It spun across the room, sailing towards the master that it would not kill. With the unerring skill of a seeker, Harry plucked the wand from the air. The Dark Lord fell backward, arms splayed, killed by his own rebounding curse. He hit the floor with anticlimactic finality and total silence fell.
“Besides, the Age Line Dumbledore made was foolproof. Adrian Pucey tried taking an aging potion so he could get past it and it chucked him out. There is no way Potter was smart enough to get past the age line.” Draco drawled.
"Ah, well, I suppose there is Theo. He's about the only real relationship I've ever had, but we never went on any dates. The rest of them were flings and one-night stands so I don't think they count." Draco could feel the blush in his cheeks spreading to his neck and ears.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts, but they are met with a surprising reception. The twins make a surprising announcement, Lucius is an actual father for once, Snape is a massive dickwad, Draco laughs for the first time in ages, two more Horcruxes get destroyed, and someone loses a friend.
Darkness began to slowly eat away at the golden glow and Harry was able to make out Draco’s features. His face looked hollow and there were dark circles under his frightened silver eyes. He met Harry’s gaze and Harry felt Draco’s fear.
“Thanks.” Harry grinned, setting the ball on the table and stepping up to take his shot. He stared at the lay of the balls for a quick second before confidently sinking the remaining three solids and the eight ball in rapid succession.
“You mean you didn’t know? And you just decided I was your boyfriend anyway?” Harry was incredulous.
“You’re right, I’m sorry. That was rather unprofessional of me.” He looked as if the words took a great amount of effort to say.
“Nonsense, this is a win-win situation.” Zach shoved them into Harry’s hand. “You solve your date planning problem, I solve my ‘not wanting to go to this ballet because I’ve seen it seven times already’ problem, and my brother’s feelings aren’t hurt because the tickets are going to good use."
“Ah, we got that covered.” Vince nodded towards three broomsticks that were laying half a foot away in the grass.
“Sirius, are you there? Sirius talk to me!” He called to his own reflection, feeling foolish. It didn’t take long for his reflection to shimmer and transform into Sirius’s face.
Harry bloody Potter was cowering behind the bathroom door, spying on his mental breakdown. The second to last person he ever wanted to see him wallowing in weakness.
"She's not even a Death Eater. Why do we have to bow down to some ministry bitch?" Theo's bottom lip jutted out as he slipped into full sulk mode.
His memories sharpened after taking Hermione’s sobering potion and a strange giddiness made his heart rate increase. He had taken the next step in their relationship and brought Draco back to Grimmauld Place. He had let Draco in on one of his best-kept secrets, and instead of feeling exposed he felt elated.
Draco is forced to admit something he'd rather not think about. Ever. But now that he knows there is no getting around it. Damn his interfering best friends.
“Yeah, alright.” Draco conceded. “I’m beginning to realize you’re not the attention-seeking prick I always made you out to be.”
“You love it.” Draco smirked, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders when he settled his back against Draco’s chest.
Everyone groaned while he dashed off to the bar to order them all a round. This was about to be either a very fun or a very long night.
Pansy sighed and launched into a long-winded explanation. She told Hermione everything she could without directly violating Draco’s trust. Much to her credit Hermione didn’t interrupt with questions once. She simply listened, nodding when she understood something or gasping when something shocked her. Pansy was rather glad she had switched her affections to this particular Gryffindor. She had a feeling Ron Weasley would not have been quite so calm if he were here instead of Hermione.
“Don’t you dare go blaming yourself for my death.” Fred said sternly. “I chose to stay and fight. I chose to be in that corridor. Just about the only thing I didn’t choose was falling in love with you, you git. And that I will gladly do a thousand times over, because you’re worth it, Harry.”
“And I can charm it to make the insult worse the more you try to fix it!” Draco sniggered, his head swimming.
“Well, I've never seen Potter and Granger do anything to suggest a real relationship between them. I bet it’s a load of codswallop. Even Potter has got to have better taste than Granger.” Theo snorted, shooting Draco a conspiratorial wink.
The first task is over and the Yule Ball is approaching quickly. For once in Harry's life, he starts feeling normal. Draco gets crazy ideas planted in his head and Snape worms his way out of dancing by the skin of his teeth.
“Because I know how horrible it can be to deal with stuff like this on your own.’ Draco pressed a soft kiss to the top of Harry’s head.
"Think nothing of it." His father turned, swishing his robes in a very Malfoy-ish fashion. When he caught Draco watching him he gave him a very formal nod in greeting and moved on.
“Take these things for a walk?!” Draco cried in disgust, peering into the crate that was closest to him. That was a mistake. The skrewts were anything but little. They had grown even more since their last lesson and Draco felt panic beginning to bubble in his chest. “And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?”
The insults and jeers died down at once. Pansy was ever so grateful that she had a reputation for being volatile if she didn’t get her way. The younger students even scrambled out of their path as she towed Hermione over to the girls dormitory hallway. She only slowed down once they were safely in the corridor, coming to a stop in front of her dormitory door.
“We should split up. Follow the sound of their footsteps, alright? Remember, we need to bring Potter back alive.” He whispered. Greg and Vince nodded, each taking a different flank. That left Draco to go down the middle. He grimaced as he passed the vanishing cabinet he had used to sneak Death Eaters into the castle last year, the night he almost became a murderer.
“Was there any truth to what they said?” Hermione asked softly, crawling up onto her bed next to her.
In the end, he managed to save five of his sketchbooks and one partially burnt drawing of Harry laughing with his friends at the Gryffindor table. The Weasel and Granger got the brunt of the damage, leaving Harry’s perfect features untouched.
Draco really wished she wouldn’t. He was miserable enough without his spine feeling like someone had cast a freezing charm on it.
“I’m s-s-sorry.” Harry gave another massive yawn and stretched while Draco snatched the parchment off the coffee table and read the note.
“Our food will be out in a few minutes. Do you want to find a place to sit?” Harry checked the long strip of paper in his hand.
“Idiotic Gryffindors, I swear.” She muttered. “Draco has been going on about Harry too. So if Harry is going on about Draco and Draco is going on about Harry...” She arched her eyebrows at him encouragingly.
They tried out what Harry called a racing game next. These controls were much harder to use than the shooting game, but he gave it his best go anyway. Draco had a difficult time staying on course and kept crashing into the sides. At one point he even ran into Harry and knocked him off the track with him, but Harry still beat him on both games. He found that he didn’t mind losing to Harry, he was just happy to be playing and sharing something so trivial and simplistic with him. Harry showed him how to play foosball, at which he managed a narrow victory, and Harry helped him play single-player video games like Pac-man, Galaga, and Frogger. When their interest in the video games waned Harry suggested a couple of rounds of pinball. Draco quickly discovered that he did not enjoy the noisy contraption and decided to just watch Harry play.
Draco watched surreptitiously as his godfather taunted Harry quietly, his black eyes flashing. He wondered what Harry had done to him to earn such unadulterated hatred. Snape was not the most pleasant person to begin with, but he seemed to especially hate Harry and Longbottom. He tormented them the most frequently. Whatever the case, Draco was glad to be on his good side. He was terrifying on a good day. He didn't even want to imagine what being on his bad side was like. He almost felt sorry for the Gryffindors.
“You can come back to mine and we can play some wizard's chess.” Neville offered a little too eagerly and Harry tried valiantly to hide his grin.
“You have to.” Draco whispered, unintentionally taking a step closer. “You have to destroy it. Please.”
Fred and George had refused to let him break up with them. That somehow made it worse. He felt even more abandoned than if they had listened to him after Dumbledore’s funeral. He wished against all logic that they could have come with them. What a laugh. He could never ask them to risk their lives for him. He was of half a mind to leave Ron and Hermione safely behind, but he had nowhere else to go.
They swapped stories all the way back to their spot on the beach, which as Harry predicted, was empty again. It was nice and strangely familiar like they had been friends all along. Eventually, they got cold and headed up to the fire where they were pulled into different directions, but Draco didn’t mind. They had a coffee date tomorrow.
"Thank you. For honoring tradition, I mean. I'm oddly glad we had this chance to chat without firing off hexes at each other." He smiled shyly.
“On second thought, my inbox is jam-packed. I can’t possibly help you when I’m drowning in paperwork myself.” They intoned dramatically.
“I’m a Slytherin, for one thing. I don’t tend to get along with Gryffindors.” Draco’s tea set had never been more interesting. He watched the stars twinkling against the inky black, following the delicate lines that connected the constellations with an inordinate amount of concentration. “I’m a Malfoy, for another. My family doesn't exactly have the best reputation. Not to mention the fact that I’m a Death Eater.”
“Thanks, Luna.” He sighed gratefully as she cast a warming charm over him. “If you could lead me to a bathroom I can get myself sorted out.”
“I’m not alone.” Draco almost choked on his panic. How could the man be so calm? Surely he had realized what he was here to do. “There are Death Eaters in your school tonight.
The officer was looking up at them with an annoyed expression and Draco sighed, bracing for the worst. He tightened his arm around Harry’s shoulder as the officer told her he was going to get to the bottom of this and approached them.
Draco shuddered at the mention of Voldemort’s name but didn’t squawk in fear like most people. Harry was oddly impressed.
“I say we start over here.” Bill motioned them over towards the window and Draco tried not to shudder at the remembered pain of being marked. “The stench or dark magic is the strongest here.”
He shot Ron a pleading look but he shook his head grimly, shrugging as if to say ‘just let her get it out’.
“Oh.” Hermione looked thoughtful. “That actually explains so much. How did I not see it? So that would mean that he and Theo are…?”
Not just Hogwarts either, the students from the visiting schools and the ministry employees as well. He felt nauseous just thinking about it. Ron shot him a sympathetic look before McGonagall called his name.
“Mmm.” Harry hummed as he took another sip. “You take yours with one sugar and just a splash of milk.” He said knowingly.
“You’ve been lying to me for almost eight years?” His father looked hurt and Draco suddenly felt ashamed. “Both of you?” He turned to look at Narcissa who shrank away from him.
Hello lovely readers! So I have big plans for Draco's birthday. (Un)Fortunately (depending on how you look at it) this means I will be breaking his birthday up into multiple chapters, so bear with me! You will die of the cute by the time his birthday is done!
“Mr. Weasley, up here.” She said sternly. A horrified expression crossed Ron’s face as the twins shoved him forward, laughing hysterically. “Take my waist, if you please.”
“I think Ron is right, Harry! Oh, why didn’t I think of it? You should take some of your Felix Felicis. Maybe all you need really is a bit of luck!” She crowed.
Of course she was, there were never enough hours in a day. Pansy peeled off her work robes as she walked, folding them neatly before shrinking them and placing them in her purse. She counted it as a victory that the halls of the center were deserted. Any time she encountered someone today they had another problem for her to solve and she was beginning to think taking over for Harry had been a bad trade.
Conversation became impossible after that and Draco was secretly relieved. When it came time for Draco to dance with Harry he swallowed hard at the lump of anxiety that had been building in the back of his throat. Harry was resolutely staring over Draco's shoulder, not meeting his gaze and Draco's heart broke a little more.
“The Lupin-Black center. Harry started it so that children whose parents died or were rendered incompetent during the war had a place where they would be loved and welcomed. We have on-site housing and daily programs for the kids. When school is in session we provide primary schooling for those who are too young to go to Hogwarts. Harry out-did himself. It’s truly a genius system!” Pansy gushed, clearly passionate about her job.
He woke up drenched in sweat. He shook his head to clear it before rolling over and trying to go back to sleep.
He told Zach to take cover and blast their way through the front entrance so that Harry could break the ward on the staircase door while the target was distracted. Zach replied in the affirmative and Harry put the journal away, waiting for Zach to set the plan in motion.
"Now I am even more determined to do well in this role." He set his tea down in contemplation. "Why wouldn't she tell us?"
He smiled as he caught sight of Draco, his legs automatically moving to take him closer to him. He was wearing his golden Bridesman robes again and Harry quite appreciated the way they fit his slight frame.
"No, it was fine." Harry gave him a small smile as they made their way out of the crowded theater. He didn't want to bring Draco down too. "Where do you want to go for dinner?"
“Where did you learn to play so well?” Neville asked as they sat down at the high top with their drinks to watch their friends play.
The guard gave him a gentle prod and Lucius nodded curtly at him. They were fortunate that Gerald had been the one to escort them today. He was the most sympathetic of all their guards and Lucius greatly appreciated the man. He approached the high table cautiously. He had been on the receiving end of the ex-auror’s wand one too many times.
“Is this your way of asking me to be your boyfriend?” His tone was teasing but his smirk was hopeful.
They rounded up the thirteen underlings, tying them all together before apparating the lot of them back to the Ministry for booking. They cheerfully handed Thranduil and his goons off to the Criminal Containment Aurors and headed upstairs to start the closing paperwork for the case. Harry let out a heavy sigh as he flipped open the dossier.
The deafening scraping of benches against stone rang through the hall as agitated chatter began buzzing once more. The Durmstrang students were the only ones not gossiping. They all looked disappointed but resigned as they followed the Slytherins out into the entrance hall. They probably knew that they stood little chance at being picked over Krum. The goblet might not know he was famous, but Krum was clever and performed well under pressure. You would have to be both cunning and brave to be a seeker good enough to play in the Quidditch World Cup. Draco shook his head, trying to resolutely ignore the glaring similarities between Krum and a certain Gryffindor. It really shouldn’t have been a shock that they were both chosen. He turned his attention back to his friends, only to find that he had missed half of a conversation.
When he looked back up Draco was leading the muggle off the dance floor towards the back. Theo frowned as he watched them disappear into the bathroom together.
“Long enough.” Harry hedged and Draco narrowed his eyes at him. That was the same thing he said about the price of the art kit. After catching Draco's unimpressed look he sighed. “I may have enlisted Hermione’s help.”
Malfoy jumped off the counter and crowded Harry till he had him pushed up against the wall. Harry got lost in fathomless depths of liquid mercury as Malfoy stared him down.
Every time he closed his eyes he could see the faces of every student whose families had been attacked by Death Eaters. His nausea swelled as he thought ‘my fellow Death Eaters’. He spun around and dashed for the nearest stall.
“Don’t be. I’m glad you’re alright.” Bill gave him a warm smile and a pat on the back. “Same thing happened to me in a tomb in Egypt. I had to sit that one out. Panic attacks suck.”
“I know you don’t! Are you stupid? No one wants to think about painful things, but you have to in order to heal and move on. So get ready for some tough love, Potter, because apparently, you need it.”  Pansy crossed her arms and cocked her head in a defiant stance.
All year he had to listen to the whispers of violence. Important witches and wizards were disappearing almost constantly. Family members were being kidnapped and tortured, held for ransom to coerce others into joining the Dark Lord.
A soft woosh announced the owl’s arrival and Harry turned around. The regal-looking bird sat perched on the railing, regarding him curiously.
Since the third floor was deserted he risked a quick Lumos to help him get his bearings as he exited the apartment. They had studied the blueprints of this abandoned apartment complex a hundred times. He closed his eyes and tried to visualize the schematics. He was in the middle of the third floor so the stairs should be down the hall on the left. He made his way over to them swiftly, keeping his eyes and ears on the alert for any sign of movement and pushing his magic out to search for any hidden wards or hex triggers.
“I’m glad we were able to have his friends over. It’s a relief to see him making happy memories here again.” Lucius took a refined sip of wine.
With all that out of the way, I hope you enjoy it! I'm having a lot of fun writing this fic and I hope it makes you happy too!
“Your symptoms, Harry.” Hermione tutted impatiently, running her wand up and down the length of his body while the tip glowed blue.
“I don’t want to go any more than you do, mate. A promise is a promise tho.” Ron grimaced. He hated being drug to Ministry events almost as much as Harry did. Almost.
"Thank you. I’m pleased to see you, too." Draco turned towards Neville and shook his hand with a pleasantly surprised expression. "Having a good summer so far?"
Granger and the Weasel pushed their way through the panicked crowd, moving towards them quickly and Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
“Two of them are marked death eaters, so the use of veritaserum is expected.” Kingsley’s deep, soothing tones failed to disguise the absurdity of the situation.
Ron had been oddly supportive of him getting together with Draco from the very beginning. He had been prodding Harry to get a move on for over a month now, but everything was different now than they were actually dating. He trusted Ron implicitly and his blessing meant a lot. He hadn’t been able to receive it with the twins because the twins had wanted to keep things private, so his approval of Draco seemed to mean twice as much. He gave Ron an appreciative grin before turning to find Draco already out of his seat and ready to go.
“My Aunt slapped me around a bit and ordered me to move all of the prisoners except Granger into the cellar.”
“That isn’t my problem. I didn’t ask for any of this!” He growled, jabbing his wand so violently the cushion tore down the middle.
They were almost there, but Greg was getting rather heavy. He stumbled down a secret passage that was, blessedly, free of stairs. It had a steep incline, though, and Draco struggled not to fall. If he could get him to the infirmary he could patch him up. He was no expert, but he had done extensive amounts of research into healing magic. He could at least make sure Greg wouldn’t die too.
“When Ron and I broke free,” Harry continued “and charged the occupants of the manor I distinctly saw Draco shoot off stunning spells at the Death Eaters who were torturing Hermione. When we were disarmed he gave me his wand so we could escape.”
“I have the perfect room for you.” She beamed, pulling him through a maze of archways and beautifully decorated rooms. “It’s just off the kitchen here and has a lovely view of the pond out back. It isn’t the sea, but it should do.”
This sparked a rather spirited debate and they fell into the familiar patterns of their complex and unique friendship. They discussed all of the intricacies of Draco working in the gallery in between joking and poking fun at one another. It was almost like old times. Draco was so excited to be working that he almost forgot to whine about Harry, which did not escape Pansy’s notice.
“Here, you’ve got some just there…” Harry reached out and wiped at the mead that he could feel dripping down his chin and Draco had to remind himself to breathe.
“Oh Draco, that's a wonderful idea. I know just what books you need. Why don’t you go visit your father in his study and I’ll bring them to you?” She placed both hands on his shoulders until he met her piercing blue eyes.
“That’s fine. Do you have any plans for the rest of the day?” Harry asked with a nervous edge in his voice.
“It’s more of an acquired taste.” Harry snickered, wrapping his arm around Draco’s shoulder and pulling him close.
“Erm, actually yeah. I should try to talk to Slughorn…” Pansy could hear shuffling and the zipping of a book bag.
His voice broke as he pushed Hermione away and rushed to Fred’s side. Ron and Percy made room for him without comment. Fred’s eyes were staring up at the now visible sky, unblinking- unseeing, with his last laugh still etched upon his face.
“Can Take Dating Two Weasleys.” Fred glared at Ron before continuing. “If there is anything we can do to help, you need to trust that The Saviour of My Heart, and the Wizarding World, will let us know. Alright?”
“I will never be sick of you.” He promised, cupping his jaw with one hand before planting a quick kiss on his full lips.
He towed Harry towards the middle of the dancefloor, locking eyes with the Weaselette as he pulled Harry closer. She stopped dead in her tracks, almost causing her dance partner to crash into her. Draco delighted in the pure fury on her face. She looked like she was about to come over to break them up, but thought better of it. She turned on the spot and stalked off the dancefloor, leaving a very confused Lee Jordan in her wake.
Draco blinked rapidly when he pulled back and Harry couldn’t help but grin at his stunned expression.
When she went back to the bar he pulled out his coin purse. He had emptied his vault at Gringotts the day he ran. Getting it changed into muggle money seemed like the smartest move. He had been right. The wad of strange paper money had been greatly depleted by now, but he should have enough to survive on for another year if he was cautious. He carefully peeled a couple of twenty-pound notes from the stack and put the rest away. That was his budget for getting sloshed. If he kept drinking the same thing he would be rightly pissed in no time.
“Here’s to new beginnings!” His mother smiled warmly once everyone had a plastic cup of mead in their hands.
“The treasures they took are people?!” Pansy cried in outrage. Bagman had recited the riddle that the champions had been given in their eggs at the beginning of the task. “That’s barbaric!”
The Dark Lord was dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and an Auror all at once and he was holding his own. Come on, he silently begged someone- anyone. He’s mortal now. Just kill him. Please.
“I was. It was manageable at first. I still had some degree of autonomy for the first year. When I forced Severus to make an unbreakable vow to protect Draco the Dark Lord was...displeased. I lost what little freedoms I had kept hold of. The Dark Lord started forcing me to follow him around like a deranged dog, leaving little time for fighting the curse.” Narcissa struggled to keep her tone even. She hadn’t spoken to anyone about what it had been like. Now she was telling a courtroom full of people.
“Nobody. There are no more horcruxes. There is no one else to die for me. It’s just us two.” Harry didn’t take his eyes off the Dark Lord. “Neither can live while the other survives.”
“No. We have to move Fred’s body. We can’t let anything happen to him.” Harry said as firmly as he could manage. He joined Percy who had taken Harry's place, weeping over his body. “Come on Percy, we need to take him somewhere safe.”
The class went rather smoothly, and Harry was delighted when Draco was forced to admit that he was right. Draco was really good at origami. He had made three paper sculptures before Harry had even finished his first. Draco had created a rose, another swan, and a frog by the end of the class. Harry had created a rather misshapen elephant.
“I took the mark.” Draco huffed, giving in and returning the gaze that he could feel burning a hole in the side of his head.
“He gets really busy sometimes and he forgets that people care about him. It’s a bad habit of his. I’m sure you didn’t do anything wrong.” She said for the third time that evening.
Time to put his ‘Gracious Host’ face on. He slipped into the role easily. Thanks to being brought up around dinner parties, fundraising galas, and holiday parties, Draco was quite adept at hosting. He just hated it.
“You’re right, it is easy for me to say. I wish I could fix it and make them see the truth but I can’t, so ignoring them is our best option.” She huffed, glaring at the offending Hufflepuffs as they passed.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat as his fingers fumbled with the mokeskin pouch around his neck. He pulled the snitch Dumbledore had left him and put it up to his mouth. The familiar writing materialized.
Fifty heads swiveled towards where his parents sat still chained together. At least his father had the decency to look ashamed. When the attention came back to him Draco took a deep breath before continuing.
“I’m glad to hear it.” Draco smiled and Harry was surprised how much it enhanced his normally stoic features. “Was there anything else that happened this week that you wish to discuss?”
“That you boys are crazy about each other. Just about everyone knew except you two.” She teased. “Happy birthday, sweetheart.”
Christmas dinner was looming ever nearer and Draco was terrified. That left only two days before he would be introduced to The Dark Lord. He knew what this was. This was the preliminary meeting where Voldemort would basically interview him and decide to make him a death eater. He knew it would happen some time, but why so soon? He wasn’t even sixteen yet. He was supposed to still have a year! What happened to that rule?
"Just… all of it. The whole bloody thing." Draco pinched the bridge of his nose until it hurt. It distracted him from the pain in his jaw and cheekbones. Harry and the Weasley twin had done quite the number on him before they had been pulled off. His ribs gave a sharp pain so he sat back against the lockers with a grimace.
“I mean that we will not be able to leave this room for anywhere between one to twelve hours, depending on the severity of the breach.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes. Harry had noticed he did that whenever he got upset or worried. “I apologize for your inconvenience. I’m sure you didn’t plan on getting stuck here.”
“Yes, well it was the only solution we could think of at the time.” Harry sniffed a little defensively.
“Well, my hair was boring and bland for one.” Ari made a face at the memory of his mousey brown hair, running his fingers through his now emerald green locks to reassure himself that he was no longer hopelessly dull. “Completely unremarkable and certainly not memorable. We never directly interacted either, so I’m sure that doesn’t help.”
“Of course, Draco. What are friends for?” She hugged him back before gently pushing him towards stage left.
He felt his father’s steady hands pulling him into a more comfortable position against his chest. He hadn’t sat like this in years, curled up in his father’s arms with his head buried in his chest- it was equal parts awkward and reassuring.
“It’s just the two of us now. We have to look out for each other.” Hermione sat in the chair Harry had just vacated and picked up The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore from where he had left it.
“You know we are always ‘ere for you to talk to if need be, yes?” Fleur caught his eye and held his gaze until he nodded.
“Blimey, do you think it will work after that fire?” Ron glanced back at the now blank stretch of wall. “Should we split up and look for her?”
“Yeah, fine.” Harry pulled the locket off and gave an involuntary sigh of relief as soon as Hermione took it from him.
“Harry and Seamus are the best out of the four of us, so I figure you pair with Harry and I’ll pair with Seamus. Hopefully, together we can manage to beat him.” Ron grabbed the longest cue, testing it against his height and making sure it was relatively straight.
He swore softly when he noticed he was crying. Then he laughed at himself for being embarrassed. He was only about to die. Crying wasn’t an overreaction. He took several deep breaths, then pulled out his invisibility cloak. He draped it around his shoulders quickly, pulling the hood snugly over his head.
“You didn’t have to. You’re my boyfriend and I care about you!” Draco’s throat was closing up in fear.
“Harry, if your scar is hurting you need to practice occlumency and block him out.” Hermione frowned.
“Guess I’m special.” Harry chuckled, wincing as she started to knead his bare skin. “I don’t get any softer, pretty kitty. I promise.” He poked at her paws until she stopped.
“But… the more time I have away from my father, the more I question everything. I don’t want to turn into him, Pans. I can’t! I want nothing to do with the Dark Arts or my father’s twisted moral values. I don’t want to hate people before I even know them. I don’t want to carry on the Malfoy name and uphold our wretched family traditions. I don’t want any of it! I just want to be Draco. Just bloody Draco. Not Draco Malfoy, son of a Death Eater. Not Draco the pureblood who can trace his family line back for centuries at a time. I just want to be normal!” He groused, talking every bit as much with his hands as he did with his mouth, sending cold water flying everywhere.
“I suppose that’s fair.” Harry’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Let’s make it a point to not go almost an entire month without hanging out again, yeah? Seeing you in passing just isn’t the same...”
“No offense, Malfoy, but I really don’t feel comfortable opening up to you.” He hedged, gripping the back of the chair instead of sitting down.
All in all, Harry felt the zoo trip was a huge success, even when Teddy fell asleep in his ice cream and got it all over his face and in his hair. When they walked in the door Andi took one look at his sticky state before simply pointing upstairs. Harry gave her an apologetic shrug before heading up to give him a bath.
Harry ended up wedged between Percy and George at the table. He couldn’t have asked for more awkward dining partners than his ex and the person who told Ron he was deranged. The fire whiskey kept flowing, however, so he found he was quite easily able to ignore the hesitant pauses in conversation. Before he knew it dinner was over and Molly was serving dessert. She had made an excellent treacle tart and Harry felt obligated to eat some despite the queasy feeling in his stomach.
Four somber faces nodded back at him. He pulled Pansy and Theo in close and tried to draw strength from them. There was a second, blinding flash of blue light and suddenly Harry was holding Cedric to him at the entrance to the maze. Draco stood up. Something was seriously wrong. Harry was clinging to Cedric like he was…
Draco turned at the sound of his name and was somewhat relieved to see Madame Juliette walking towards him.
“On the day in question, she had ordered us to patrol the corridors surrounding her office and to detain any student who acted suspiciously. So we did. I had caught Ginny Weasley while Greg, Vince, Millicent, and Theo had captured Harry’s other friends. We brought them to her office as instructed and were told to keep them incapacitated.”
“I’m sure they appreciate that.” A rather stout wizard snapped waspishly. “Tell us about the final battle. Walk us through your thought process when you helped Mr. Potter. What were you thinking?”
“Of course you can, darling. Come here,” Draco reached out and pulled Harry practically into his lap. “I’m going to murder the Dursleys. Harry, you aren’t a burden, and you deserve to be hugged and loved, and looked after. Alright?”
"Oh, Harry." She wrapped her arms around his middle and leaned her head against his in solidarity. "I've got you, you're safe."
“It is not.” Harry laughed. When Draco looked at him like he might be crazy Harry realized he meant it. “Come on, you have to know that’s not true. You were the master of the Elder wand at one point.”
"Of course I do." Draco abandoned the rest of his sandwich too and joined Harry in the archway. "Why wouldn't I?"
“Oh. Er, I might have noticed you always added too much sugar to yours during breakfast in the great hall.” He flushed.
Harry cast his mind back, trying to discern the last time he had felt truly happy. His first thought was of the world cup, but even that event had been marred by the dark mark and Death Eaters. When the Weasleys had come to pick him up this past summer was also taken into consideration. Watching Dudley eat the ton tongue toffee had been a virtual riot, but that night had been plagued with copious amounts of anxiety. His thoughts strayed to Sirius and the night he had asked if Harry would want to come to live with him. Despite the danger of Professor Lupin turning into a werewolf and the fact that Pettigrew had escaped, Harry had felt elated at the prospect. That was before they both almost died down by the lake and Sirius was taken into custody to be kissed. Harry wracked his brains, trying to remember a single instance his happiness wasn’t short-lived. He supposed it must have been when he and Ron stole Mr. Weasley’s Ford Angela in second year. They might have hit the whomping willow, but they hadn’t been expelled and Ron even got a brand new wand out of it. His cheerful mood was dampened ever so slightly as he realized it had been over two years since he felt really truly happy.
“I just feel so trapped, you know? They both expect me to be the perfect little pureblood son. To marry a perfect little pureblood witch and have perfect little pureblood children and to live a perfect little pureblood life.” He sneered at the thought, laughing mirthlessly. “Everyone just assumes that I’m going to continue on my father’s legacy of amassing power behind the scenes and having important people in my pocket. I just don’t want it. I haven’t even told my parents I’m gay. I’m too afraid of how my father will react.”
“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself as you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that he is gone. The battle is won. You have sustained heavy losses, and your supposed hero is finished. The Boy Who Lived lives no more. Any who continue to resist me will be slaughtered. Lord Voldemort does not differentiate between man, woman, or child, every member of every family that continues to fight will be wiped out. Come out of the castle now and kneel before your new Master. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will all be forgiven. Join me, and we shall build a brave new world together.”
"You just need to find your center of gravity. " Harry chuckled. "Here, cross your arms and grab both of my hands."
“Besides, you would never deprive me of the chance to see you both in your Quidditch gear.” Pansy winked at them.
“Yes! It will help you save your Wheezy!” Dobby’s ears wiggled in delight as Harry grabbed the gilly weed from him.
It didn’t take long before Dean joined them with a tray of brightly colored drinks and a pocket full of change.
"Oh. Er, well I-I have a bit, yeah. Not necessarily with planning them, but..." Harry trailed off awkwardly.
Draco schooled his features into a mask of indifference as he followed his parents upstairs. Perhaps if he were allowed to go he could find a way to save Harry.
The Weasel started screaming his head off, fighting against his restraints. He was yelling at his Aunt to take him instead of Granger and Draco had to give him credit for his bravery. She cut Granger loose anyway, promising the Weasel that he would be next.
Vernon Dursley gave Draco one last look of contempt before rounding on Harry, pulling out a newspaper and brandishing it in his face.
“I have some muggle money. I could trade you for your galleons and then you might have enough.” Draco offered.
Before Draco could think of an appropriate response a loud voice crackled over the PA system, issuing instructions on how to safely mount and dismount from the moving pods. They turned just in time to see a pod coming into the bay and people hopping on as it glided down the track. Taking a leap of faith was nothing new to the ex-Hogwarts students, they had had plenty of practice running onto platform 9 ¾, and they jumped gracefully from the loading platform into the elongated glass dome. Not everyone was as swift or agile, and Draco was delighted when the doors closed, sending their pod sailing into the open air at only half capacity. It allowed everyone on board to spread out and the extra breathing room was wonderful.
After the waves of what was possibly the most intense orgasm of his life, Harry gently pulled out and collapsed on the bed next to his boyfriend.
Two gifts were left and Draco grabbed the biggest one, carefully unsheathing it from its dark green wrapping. It was a portrait of him and his parents on his fourteenth birthday. It was the last family painting they had done before everything changed. Before the Dark Lord returned. Before the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament. It was the last time they were all happy before the war and he fought back the wave of emotion it brought forth. He brought it into his living room and used a temporary sticking charm to hang it above his mantle. His portrait family smiled approvingly at him and he smiled back before returning to the kitchen for the last present.
“I apologize for what you’re about to hear. I don’t like to let you see this side of me.” She sighed in warning before shoving the door open and stalking in. “Alright you useless twats, clear out. I need the dorm and you’re not invited to stay.”
His comment earned a round of laughter just as the subject of their amusement joined the throng waiting outside the potions classroom.
“You don’t think it’s a bit weird?” Draco’s eyebrows rose of their own volition. “We supposedly hated each other at the time.”
"The stairs were pretty narrow." Harry nodded towards the still open door across the lobby. "If we can force them to chase us up the stairs we will gain the higher ground and be able to take them on two at a time."
“That’s perfect. Set one aside for me and I’ll be back for it in a bit.” Harry ran a running calculation on how much time he had before Draco was expecting him.
He wasn’t sure how Draco would react to learning the extent of his horrible life with the Dursleys, but he certainly hadn’t expected an apology.
“Er, yeah. I inherited him from Sirius. I tried to give him clothes but he refused to take them. He’s pretty stubborn when he wants to be.”
“You can’t be here! You-” Harry cried in alarm, the fact that Draco Malfoy was here at the Burrow finally sinking in.
Sure enough, when he went into Draco’s living room Narcissa’s head was floating in the fireplace against the North wall.
“I know.” Kinsley said harshly. “We don’t have any other options. You’ve avoided all of the other trials, you don’t understand the difficult position the Ministry is in. I personally trained the persecutors in how to question someone under the influence of veritaserum. No new information gleaned from questioning can be added to the charges against them, any and all questions must be strictly relevant to the case, and yes or no questions are greatly discouraged. The defendants are also free to refuse the veritaserum and plead guilty. I’m doing everything I can.”
“Goodnight, Harry.” Draco could feel the idiotic, besotted smile spreading across his lips but he couldn’t be arsed to contain it.
Then night falls. Then everything goes quiet. A hurricane of loud thoughts and bottled up grief and fear and anger rages. He can't sleep, and even when he could he was plagued with nightmares about Cedric and Sirius. Everyone thought he was so strong. That he was Harry freakin Potter! He should be able to handle anything. After all, what was life if you weren't constantly fighting Voldemort? Sirius was gone. There was no one left for him to talk to. He felt like he was suffocating, gasping for breath. It was all getting to be just too much.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Vince and Greg, earning a snort of laughter from each of them. “Got your autographs books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer…half the Triwizard champions have died… how long d’you reckon you’re going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
“Don’t flatter yourself,” she scoffed, but she still kept a concerned eye on him “You haven’t even properly asked me. I might just go with Nott or Zabini.”
It was impossible to think over the throbbing in his head. He gasped and moved towards the edge of the bed as a new wave of nausea washed over him. Ron took a couple of steps back as he dry-heaved.
“You’re the only one who can kill him.” Draco choked. “The others- he has the others out looking for you- you need to hide! They have orders to leave you alive, but I-”
Before Draco was even aware of what was happening two wizards had grabbed him from behind and held him still while the others swarmed around him. A number of people gave him a swift kick anywhere they could reach while others opted to use their fists. There were some, however, that must have been unsatisfied with the spittle falling short because they made sure to hit him this time around.
Harry had seemed alright with the pet name last night and at the pub with his friends. Had that just been because he was distracted? Harry turned back and flashed Draco his favorite twisted half-smile.
Harry placed his hands on the edge of the pool and hauled himself up, dripping copious amounts of water all over the concrete.
In lieu of a ‘thank you’ Harry grabbed George and kissed him hard on the mouth. George’s hands immediately sought out his face, holding him there to make the kiss last longer. Harry didn’t mind. It made him feel desired.
His eyes sought Harry’s and emerald held silver for a moment. When Harry looked away the walls seemed to be shrinking in on them and the sudden desire to get out overwhelmed him. He stalked off stage without being dismissed, moving blindly towards the front despite the shouts from his friends.
Theo couldn’t help but watch the blond as he downed his drink and glided onto the dancefloor. He seemed to scan the other dancers for a moment before dancing his way over to an attractive muggle in the middle of the floor. Theo had never been happier to be interrupted by the wait staff in his life.
“Not at all.” Draco finally tore his eyes off the moving pods and gave Harry a nervous smile. “I’ve just never been this close before.”
The Great Hall was a cacophony of sounds the next morning and Draco was absolutely miserable. It felt as if every last one of his brain cells was swimming through treacle tart and his ears seemed to have become absurdly sensitive overnight. He groaned when the hall filled with hissing and muttering, rubbing his temples with his fingers. He looked up to discover the source of the angry noises and grimaced when he saw Potter walking to the Gryffindor table, eyes set straight ahead and a determined frown playing at those distracting lips.
“Conversion…” Draco paled at the implication. “There is nothing wrong with being gay! It isn’t just some disease you can cure or a conscious decision you can condition away! It’s perfectly natural- not something to be ashamed of. It isn’t an abnormality or an abomination, it’s just a different way to love and that terrifies you.”
“I was a Hufflepuff Prefect during your first year. I remember your sorting. Our whole house was praying to get Potter.” Ari said wistfully.
From there the conversation moved on to Quidditch, then the uncomfortability of dress robes, then the merits of sparkling wine versus champagne. Draco was surprised at how easy it was to talk to Harry, and even more shocked that Harry continued to dance with him without complaint. They must have been on their fourth or fifth song by now. Yet here he was, in Draco’s arms, chatting happily away.
“Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione ordered, holding her hand out for the horcrux. “Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day.”
“That’s all anyone can ever ask of you.” Bill said warmly, blue eyes sparkling in the firelight. “I’m proud of you for not giving up. I know this past year hasn’t exactly been a picnic.”
“Aha!” Harry cried in triumph. He held his glasses up victoriously before putting them on and fixing the couch cushions. “I think it’s sweet that she cares.”
“No one could ever like you.” Vernon snapped. “You’re a freak, a nobody. These people feel sorry for you, but eventually, they’ll see what a worthless waste of space you are and they’ll abandon you too.”
“He wants to learn, and more importantly it guarantees more than one...encounter. You know how convoluted our history is.” He smirked.
“Of course it’s real, Harry.” Draco felt like his heart might break at Harry’s vulnerable expression so he leaned forward and gently claimed his lips.
“Pans, your choreography is perfect, your dancing is perfect, and this ballet is going to be perfect.” Harry chuckled, tugging affectionately on her ponytail when she looked like she was about to argue. “Chill out, you worry too much.”
Draco saw Pansy trying to catch Theo’s eye and he looked at her quizzically. He felt rather than saw when Theo made eye contact. Pansy gave him a meaningful look and arched an eyebrow as Theo nodded curtly.
“Straight to business, then.” Draco almost smiled. “I brought a number of books along detailing the rich history of pureblood culture. I won’t force you to read them all, but you can take them home to browse through if you’d like.”
“I’m sorry I made you two feel that way.” He choked.  He had never meant to make them feel like he was ordering them around. Now that he thought about it, though, they were right.
Draco shot her a grateful glance and she winked. Pansy Parkinson was ruthless, bossy, tenacious, and manipulative, but she was a damn good friend. She was also cunning, brilliant, dedicated, and loyal to a fault. She always knew exactly what Draco needed without him having to ask. Merlin only knows how they ended up as such close friends, but he was eternally grateful that they had.
His chest felt tight- suffocating as if he was being squeezed to death and his head was caught in a loop of terror, shame, and remorse. He couldn’t think. He couldn’t breathe. A small part of him recognized he was being irrational. He knew he was overreacting, it was just a stupid room. Every time he was almost able to talk himself down the screams of the people he tortured would play on repeat in his mind and it set him off all over again. When he was finally able to stop his tears and unintelligible stammering his mother tightened her arms around him, allowing him time to calm his erratic breathing enough to where he could speak again.
“What do you need me to do?” Harry asked the question that had been plaguing him for weeks now. “How can I help?”
Trust Luna to liven up any party. He spotted Ron and Hermione halfway across the room and he made a beeline for them. He had made it to the middle of the room when someone hooked his arm in theirs and pulled him off to the side. Harry’s heart kicked into overdrive before he saw who had grabbed him.
"It's lovely to see you too, Mr. Malfoy." She smiled sweetly at him before turning to Harry. "I'm about to take off, did you still need a ride home?"
“He died in the Dark Lords cave. He asked me to destroy the Dark Lords locket but Kreacher failed. Kreacher failed brave Master Regulus!” The elf started crying in earnest.
“This isn’t for official business. I’m doing this for...a friend.” Harry stumbled a little over the title.
“Well well,” Dumbeldore tutted as though Draco were showing him an ambitious homework project. “Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?”
“I’m sorry, I know I’m no fun to be around right now.” Harry grimaced, standing up and leaving his half of the sandwich half-eaten on the plate. “I’ll just head out…”
“How do you...manage? They don’t go here anymore and I’m finding this long-distance thing a little challenging.” Potter sounded embarrassed now.
Of course, Harry knew the real story. What the locals mistook for the screams and wailings of a violent ghost were actually a young boy transforming into a Werewolf every month.
“So we brought you some Tai takeaway-” Fred started unpacking the food while George continued to pull more items out.
Harry laughed at that, refreshing their ‘Notice Me Not’ charms when he heard someone ascending the stairs.
“Look at our men.” Seamus shook his head in fond amusement. “We’ll never pull them away from the billiards table now.”
“Two very different flavors coming together to make something fantastic.” Harry took a sip of the Bramble. “They complement each other.”
“I can take you to Ignotus’s grave in Godric’s Hollow if you don’t believe me. He was my great great great great grandfather, and he has the mark of the Deathly Hallows on his gravestone.” Harry was secretly pleased to be able to teach Draco something.
"Really." Andromeda released him and gave him a fond pat on the shoulder. "Now come, tell me all about yourself while Harry bathes our little heathen."
“Of course! It’s bound to be embarrassing seeing as how I don’t know how to dance.” He grinned hopefully.
They exchanged idle chit chat while they drank their coffee and Draco marveled, not for the first time, at how absurdly easy it was to talk to Harry. He could have never imagined exchanging such easy banter back at Hogwarts. They had seemed too far apart, impossibly separated by the war.
“Fawkes.” Harry frowned, tapping the wireless with his wand. They had missed the last Potter Watch so the password was anyone’s best guess. Hermione was off on her bunk on the other side of the tent. Ever since Ron came back she had been rather cold to both of them.
This was the kind of challenge he enjoyed. His expression turned dark as his thoughts strayed to his biggest challenge. It was proving impossible to fix that bloody vanishing cabinet. The pressure of keeping his parents alive was overwhelming. He had to get the cabinet fixed and he had to kill Dumbledore. He didn’t want to think of the unspeakable horrors the Dark Lord would unleash if he didn’t succeed.
“I sometimes put them up in the gallery I work at. The owner is very nice. He lets me fill any empty slots until they get new merchandise.”
“We’re both always happy to help.” His father added quietly. “You don’t have to face any of this alone.”
“You make it impossible to leave.” George sighed, tilting Harry’s chin up and rewarding him with a long, sweet kiss. “But we really do need to get back to Diagon Alley.”
“Right, you lot,” Fred addressed the rest of the room, not letting Harry go. He held him by the waist and George slung his arm around his shoulder and Harry was grateful for their support. “We heard the tail end of what seemed to be an argument about what Harry and the others need to do to win this war. From what I gathered, you all were giving the man we love a load of shite about completing his mission. Well, I’ve got something to say to you. Our darling Harry, He-Who’s-Kisses-Are-Divine-”
“Good luck then, both of you.” Harry said bracingly as they all stood together and headed towards the portrait hole.
“I feel terrible.” He admitted, pulling them both into a rare hug. They both returned it a beat too late and when he released them they looked shocked. “I’m glad you two are alright.”
“Get down there and don’t make any noise, alright?” He hissed at the group, severing their ropes with his wand. “I can’t do much, but I will try to help. Just stay quiet.”
“I consent.” Harry chimed in. Every eye in the room turned towards him and he squirmed uncomfortably.
He jumped out of his bunk and rushed out of the tent, bracing himself on the trunk of a nearby tree as he emptied the contents of his stomach onto the forest floor.
“Yeah, sure.” He said a little too loudly as he let go of his knees and shifted over unnecessarily. There was plenty of beach, but it was nice that Harry intentionally made room for him anyway.“It’s a beautiful sunset.”
“I meant for Hagrid to get my message.” Tonks said cooly, narrowing her eyes at Snape as he unlocked the gates with a muttered spell.
He was triple checking his reflection when a familiar knock echoed from downstairs. Draco rushed to answer it feeling excited, anxious, and weirdly giddy. Harry might have been right about missing out on the whole ‘date’ part of dating. He found he quite liked it.
“Terribly sorry, where are my manners?” Ari blushed and cleared his throat before squaring his shoulders and trying again. “Welcome to Arimere’s Art, I’m Arimere. How may I assist you today, sir?”
“Don’t ask me.” Dean shrugged. “Been dating for almost three years and what goes on in that man's head is still a mystery.”
“I can’t seem to stay away.” It was meant as a joke, mostly, but Draco obviously didn’t find it funny.
Pansy started stroking his hair with her free hand and Theo put a reassuring hand on his knee.  Draco took comfort in the support from his friends. He hoped that the other Slytherins didn’t see anything odd about their closeness. It was bloody freezing out and they weren’t the only friend group cuddled together. He found a small amount of solace in that. Finally, the water in the middle of the lake started churning. It had to be Harry. The Weasel popped up first, followed by a small blonde girl and Draco stopped breathing. There was no shock of black hair amongst them. After a few excruciating seconds, Harry emerged at last.
"Don't worry, you will. Everyone falls. You just get back up and keep going." Harry pulled him towards the strange wall made of something Harry called plexiglass and polyethylene boards that insulated the rink.
The entire great hall did notice, however, when Dumbledore called out a name. He managed to sound both angry and incredulous and just a little bit fearful as he uttered those four fated syllables.
Hello lovely readers! This chapter is where this fic kind of picks up the pace. We've got the third task to go and then everything changes. If anyone wants more information about things that happen, feel free to leave them in the comments. I have a separate series of one-shots and outtakes for this verse and I have no issues writing more to satisfy your curiosity!! As always a huge shout-out to my darling beta readers AlexClio and SandZhark! They bully me into writing, even when I don't feel like it.
“Good! Now that that is settled, what did you want to ask me about?” Bill sat back and took a long sip of his mead.
“They’re real, Draco. The Hallows are real. I’ve held all three in my hands.” Harry offered his hands as evidence, even though they were currently empty.
“Yeah, fuck.” Draco agreed blandly. “Thank you for that, by the way. I don’t know what I would have done without you.”
“How are we doing teams this time?” Neville swayed slightly on his feet as they gravitated towards the cue holster.
“I’m not going to make you miss out on a night with your friends.” Draco rolled his eyes. “You’ve just said you never skip out on it.”
Harry was fuming the entire way to the council chambers, building his argument in his head. People called out greetings as he passed but he ignored them. He didn’t want to take out his frustrations on innocent bystanders. When he threw open the chamber doors several members of the Wizengamot jumped in surprise.
“She was Hogwarts High Inquisitor at that time. I was under the impression that Voldemort had my godfather and was torturing him in the Department of Mysteries and I was determined to rush off and save him. I was trying to use her floo to talk to him when she caught us.” Harry replied easily.
“We thought you knew what you were doing!” Ron stood up angrily, enunciating his hurtful words with wild gestures. “We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!”
He didn’t know when he had started to cry but the tears wouldn’t stop now. He lost the ability to form words around the painful lump in his throat and he lowered his wand. He carelessly tossed it aside to pull at his hair, desperately trying to find something else to focus on.
“Hurry! It doesn’t stay frozen for long.” Gregory Goyle called out to him. Draco ran toward the voice. He made it out of the willow's reach just in time. It started swaying and whipping its branches about as if angered by the lost opportunity to pummel him.
“It’s a beach party! No one wears bowties to beach parties.” He hissed, batting at her hands as she tried to tie it.
“Well, now you have two.” Granger said matter of factly. “I mean, I basically picked you up from prison. That definitely falls under the best friend category.”
Hello my lovely readers! I had originally intended on making the Final battle one big chapter, but Draco's side of the story demands to be written- so here we are. This is The Final Battle Part I. As always a HUGE thank you goes out to my lovely beta readers, AlexClio and SandZhark! If it weren't for them this fic would not be nearly as good! If you've stuck with me this long, THANK YOU! If you're just joining, WELCOME! Please please please please PLEASE comment! (and leave kudos if you haven't yet!) Your comments fuel my writing. The more comments I get, the faster you get a new chapter! With that said, this chapter is a feels trip. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
“Why can’t he just kill me? Leave my parents alone.” Draco rinsed the bile from his mouth. “I’d welcome death, at this point.”
“We are not doing this right now.” Draco shot her a venomous glare. The others were still chattering away so the chances of being overheard were slim. All the same, he didn’t want to give them a reason to question him.
When Malfoy took Dumbledore's offer of protection Harry hadn’t considered the fact that *he* would be the one doing the protecting.
Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived after it. With the unerring skill of a seeker, he caught the diadem around his wrist, saving it from the maws of a flaming chimera. Harry swerved again as the chimera lunged for them, soaring upwards and straight towards where the door should be. The Weasel and the others were already gone. A patch of light became visible through the smoke and Harry angled them towards it. Moments later clean air filled his lungs just before they crashed into the opposite wall. Draco let himself fall off the broom, coughing up soot. Ganger and the Weasel sat panting on the floor beside Greg who was still unconscious. Draco crawled over to him, rolling him over to check his wounds. He gagged at the sight.
Every time his Aunt and Uncle locked him in his cupboard, every birthday spent doing chores or being bullied by Dudley, every time they denied him food because of his accidental magic. Every time he was hurting and needed a hug but got a slap and verbally abused instead. He never deserved love.
“You,” Voldemort turned his wand on Narcissa and she flinched, bracing for the pain. It came in the form of a shouted command via the imperius curse and a quick burning hex to the shoulder. She cried out briefly at the double onslaught, then collected herself. “Examine him. Tell me if he’s really dead.”
Draco absentmindedly reached over and grabbed Harry’s hand, laughing at something that happened in the ballet and Harry tried to beat his unruly thoughts back into submission.
“Thank you! I was properly shocked when I opened my present.” Parkinson was positively glowing. Harry had never noticed how pretty she was before. Being in love seemed to suit her.
“Right, thanks.” Harry tried to nod and instantly regretted it. His stiff muscles protested his sudden movement.
Harry stared at him for a few moments before his heart decided to start working again. He let go of a breath he hadn’t been aware he was holding and reached out to touch Draco’s hand.
“Alright, kiddo, how about I let you ride on my shoulders all the way out of the zoo and we stop for ice cream on our way to drop you off at your nan’s. Does that sound fun?” Draco said in a very reasonable tone.
"I'll pick you up at five thirty. Wear something comfortable." Harry stroked his jaw once before heading towards the hall.
“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron. He took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they said about my sister? Death Eaters are running Hogwarts! They tried to steal the sword of Gryffindor FOR YOU!  But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you? It’s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I’ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn’t care what happens to her in there — well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff —”
Harry squinted at it and then looked around. It took a moment for Draco to realize he was looking for his glasses.
“Well, he’s named after the stars, right? It’s a Black family tradition? So I’m getting him a tea set with stars on it.” He shrugged.
“Please state your name and occupation for the court,” The Minister’s deep voice was like a soothing balm.
“Not that I’m aware of.” Pansy studied him out of the corner of her eye. For some reason, he was turning red. “Why?”
“He gave me a full-time position with painting lessons during downtime as an incentive to say yes. It would have been rude to refuse.” He smirked just a little.
“Erm, actually it was to find out if….” Harry glanced over at him guiltily and grabbed the whiskey, taking a swig before putting it back in the sand.
The sound of raging battle filled the corridor and Draco couldn’t make out any more voices. He peeked out around the tapestry and jerked back immediately. The Weaselette was storming out of the come and go room, defiance etched onto her features.
“Harry was upset. He needed help. I provided it the only way I could.” Draco’s eyes widened at the admission and he felt heat rise into his cheeks. Damn that truth serum.
That thought had him grinning like a fool as Draco cast a few quick cleaning charms on both of them.
He didn’t see Harry again until double potions at the end of the day. Pansy shot him a knowing smile when they heard the Gryffindors descending the stairs, pulling out her damned magazine with a flourish.
Snape kept at his diatribe as they began to ascend the stone stairs at last, but Harry didn’t hear a word of it. His head was beginning to swim from lack of oxygen and his legs were starting to tremble. He considered trying to alert Snape that something was very much not right with him but thought better of it.
“Nah, I don’t think so.” Harry said thoughtfully. “I think I’ve liked you for a while, I just realized it at the party.”
She was waiting for him just off stage. Her violet eyes were regarding him with a mixture of exasperation and pity and Draco braced for the concerned friend speech.
“Your hypocrisy is sickening.” Harry stepped back a few paces before spinning on the spot and taking off down the street.
As always, a HUGE thank you to my darling beta AlexClio and my dear beta SandZhark whom I have enjoyed making cry this chapter. SandZhark tells me I'm horrible and that I am literally the worst. 😈 If you want to kill me by the end of this chapter, get in line. Sand has first dibs!
How could he stand here so calmly and discuss the intricate mechanics of his own death? Draco fought the now familiar wave of nausea he associated with being a Death Eater. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter’s heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, “I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one’s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.”
“I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but I wrote Ronald a rather nasty letter when I first got hired on at the Ministry urging him to not be friends with you. I had bought into the Ministry’s cock and bull story about you being a deranged nutter. I was never more wrong in my life and I am sorry.” Percy fidgeted with his fork instead of meeting Harry’s gaze, but the sentiment seemed genuine enough.
“I’m sorry people are assholes, and I'm sorry you have to pay for their stupidity.” Harry’s voice was rich with emotion.
Harry jerked awake drenched in sweat. It wasn't a dream. His scar felt as if a thousand torches were burning beneath it and Harry thrashed in pain. His covers were all twisted around him and he shivered from the cold sweat coating his body.  He could hear voices in the distance.
“Right, thank you. I appreciate it.” Harry said quickly, bowing out of the room as fast as he dared.
Was she listening? He had quite literally just told them. He was under the influence of truth serum. Did she think his answer would change?
“No need to thank us for being decent human beings.” The woman grasped his hand in both of hers and squeezed before joining her husband.
"It fell out of your robes while he… while he crucioed you." His father's voice sounded suddenly strained. "No one else noticed, so I picked it up. Draco won himself a new wand, but I figured you might need it."
Harry gave him Jelly Babies and Liquorice All Sorts, then little chocolate nuggets called Milk Duds. Draco didn’t like the way they seemed to glue his teeth together, but he had to admit they were good. As he was being instructed on how to properly eat something called a ‘Baby Bottle Pop’ the lights dimmed and the buzz of chatter died around them. Before Draco could ask Harry what was happening the big white thing at the front lit up.
He had never truly felt normal, but since Fred’s death and the breakup with George, he didn’t feel alive at all. Hermione was busy making a name for herself and spending time with Pansy. Ron was always with George, helping him run the joke shop. Ginny and Neville kept disappearing together.
“I accept the charges.” Draco spoke first, his voice ringing loud and clear. He looked determined, making eye contact with Kingsley.
Another intrusive thought had him wondering what the quickest way to goad Malfoy into killing him would be. It would be a relief to finally be put out of his misery.
Of course he knew that, but he still wanted to dress to impress. It was possibly the closest thing to a date with Harry that he would get. He stared at his reflection critically for a moment, then walked to his closet and pulled out his lucky purple dress shirt. Any time he has worn it things seemed to go his way, and he certainly could use all of the luck he could get today. He changed shirts quickly and returned to the mirror. Something still looked off. He traded his light grey slacks for charcoal grey ones and examined his reflection. Better, but it still felt like something was missing. He ran his fingers through his still-damp hair, trying to get it to sit just right while he pondered what he needed to make the outfit complete. When the minutes ticked by and he still hadn’t figured it out he gave it up as a bad job and flooed directly to the manor.
“I got… held up at the manor.” He grimaced, sidestepping the sore subject. “Clever of you two to follow orders and keep out of trouble.”
“I don’t recall giving you permission to aid her.” Harry sneered. “Perhaps some more punishment is in order.”
“See that you don’t.” Harry sniffed. After a slight pause, he decided to bring up something that had been bothering him ever since he got his hands on that book. “Did you know we were distantly related?”
“I survived.” Draco rolled his eyes, unsuccessfully hiding his smirk as he unlocked his door. “Coming in?”
Harry slipped into the freshly cleaned drawing-room and shut the door quietly. He needed to get away from the others. There was just too much energy in the house. Hermione and Mrs. Weasley kept trying to talk to him about his hearing and didn't have anything else to say about it. He backed into the room slowly, as if expecting someone to throw the door open and pull him back into the chaos.
He reminded Harry so much of Hermione at that moment that he suddenly understood how they had become friends so fast.
Harry let Ron lead him back towards the enclosure, allowing himself to bask in this strange feeling. Relief, exhaustion and a strange happiness all intermingled and Harry embraced it. He was determined to enjoy it while it lasted.
“Harry.” He corrected automatically. “Here, I got you a chicken pesto panini. It’s the best sandwich they offer.”
Harry entered the house curiously. He had never gotten the chance to go inside during the housewarming party. Draco’s home was surprisingly bright. Harry noted the distinct lack of electricity and the subtle hum of magic in the air. Hermione had said Draco didn’t like electricity.
"Only until the Ministry stops benefitting him with their inane denial of his return." He scoffed, wrapping him in a warm hug as they sat there together.
“I’m afraid I’m not familiar with this... cuisine. Perhaps we could all order something different and share it family style. That way we all get to try new things.” his father suggested as he glanced over the menu.
Draco let out a tiny sigh before snuggling closer, pressing his face to the base of Harry's throat. Draco was practically draped across him, half covered by the sheet. Their legs were impossibly tangled together and Draco’s arm was flung possessively across Harry’s waist. He had somehow ended up with most of his torso on Harry’s chest, pinning him to the mattress but Harry didn't mind. He ducked his head to kiss Draco’s soft hair ever so gently.
“Could you and the other elves clear the dinner dishes and bring out Draco’s cake?” He asked instead of ordering and Narcissa was warmed by how kindly he treated Fili after seeing his gross mistreatment of Dobby in years passed.
Draco watched Harry shuffle forward reluctantly and sighed. The fact that he hadn’t risen to Draco’s taunt, even a little, was worrying. This was going to be a long year.
“You hiding out then as well?” A familiar voice startled Harry. He jumped about half a foot before spinning around and catching sight of Sirius with a glass of wine in his hands, lounging in the chair that the sack of rats had been in earlier.
“How can you possibly be this good without even trying?” Harry groused as they packed away their materials.
“I’d just let her do whatever it is she wants to do to you. I’ve found it’s much easier that way.” Hermione chuckled when he gave her a pleading look.
“I-” Draco started to object, then sighed. “Yes, that’s the gist of it. Any kind of attention from you was better than no attention at all.”
"It will be a nice distraction for both of us." He muttered, rubbing soothing circles on Draco's arms.  Draco sank into the comfort.
The water was starting to bubble towards the middle of the lake. Another champion was coming up and Draco desperately hoped it was Harry. After a few moments of tense silence as the entire crowd collectively held their breath, Cedric Diggory broke free of the lake’s surface and was towing a confused looking Cho Chang to shore.
Pansy caught his eye as she approached the tense knot of people and it reminded him of his father’s innocent match-making venture. Draco shook his head infinitesimally and she shot him a worried expression before joining Theo and Blaise instead. He took a deep breath and turned his attention back to his father.
“Normally I would point out the conflict of interest in supervisor-employee relations, but even if that weren’t an issue I’m afraid I’d have to decline.” Draco teased.
Harry regretted the comment as soon as it left his mouth. Draco was trying to help him. He shouldn’t be insulting the person who was dedicating time and effort into teaching him. To his immense relief, however, Draco laughed. Harry was caught off guard by the way his face lit up in amusement.
“Hagrid was delayed in coming to the feast, much like our precious chosen one.” He sneered malevolently, moving to allow Harry to enter the grounds.
They settled into a comfortable banter while they ate, poking fun at each other and reminiscing about their relationship over the past year. By unspoken agreement, no one brought up Draco Malfoy or Harry's recent excursion into dark magic. George and Fred always seemed to know exactly what he needed. He did tell them that he had made exciting progress in his lesions with Dumbledore, but he couldn’t tell them what. They didn’t mind. They were just glad he was making progress on something that was important to him. Sitting in this abandoned building with his boyfriends, joking, and talking about mundane things- it almost felt normal.
Smut will become an increasingly regular occurrence from this point in the story on. It won't be porn with a plot, as much as I appreciate those fics. This will be more plot with porn. You have been warned.
“I’m due for my monthly Ministry Inspection tomorrow.” Draco frowned, reading over the rather wordy letter from the head of the MLE.
“No, no wait! We should make them say ‘Potter Stinks’ too!” Blaise snorted, almost falling over from laughing so hard.
“My waist, Mr. Weasly.” McGonagall sighed exasperatedly, forcibly placing Ron’s hand on her hip. “Good. Now,” she pointed her wand at the gramophone in the corner of the room and it started playing a light waltz. “The steps are relatively simple. It is the same four steps again and again.”
“For Merlin’s sake,” Draco cut him off before closing the distance between them in three short strides “do you ever shut up?”
“You’re incorrigible.” Draco smiled, green eyes holding silver- only this time he was the one staring into fathomless pools of jade.
“We wouldn’t have had any other friends because we would have spent all our time studying.” He snorted. “I think everything worked out just the way it was supposed to.”
“Yeah, they’ve been trying to branch out and make some side money for the baby.” The Weaselette spoke for the first time since they had come outside.
“We can’t. Or, at least I can’t." Draco paused, uncomfortably aware that everyone was looking at him. "I only helped you because I wanted to try and balance the scales, make up for all the bad I had done. No amount of good deeds will ever counterbalance my part in the war. Or taking the dark mark. When you killed him you freed me from a life of pain and servitude. Then you go and revoke what I felt was deserved penance. I am eternally indebted to you and there is nothing I can do to ever even the score.” Draco played with his straw as an excuse to avoid eye contact.
“We heard quite a number of interesting things from Mr. Potter just a moment ago, and I’m sure we all have burning questions for you- but what I’m most curious about is how you would classify your relationship with Harry Potter?” A raven haired witch asked from the far left.
Any hope of being found slipped away as he remembered Malfoy had draped his invisibility cloak over him before trodding on his fingers on his way out. Harry spiraled into hopelessness.  If anyone had even noticed his absence surely they would have come to look for him by now? He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made. Harry despised himself for even hoping that his newfound status as “the Chosen One” would have caused enough of a fuss for them to send out a search party. He internally cursed Draco Malfoy for putting him in this position, then started cursing the rest of the sixth year Slytherins as well for good measure. Just as he reached the end of the list of Slytherins he knew by name his invisibility cloak was ripped off of him.
“He says he can hear it.” She frowned, studying the waterfall in her hands. “I wonder if I could charm this to run off magic instead?”
“She normally hates strangers.” Draco was staring at his cat apprehensively. “Last time I brought a bloke home she sulked for days. I didn’t see her for so long I nearly thought she had run off.”
“Malfoy’s depressed?” Harry was suddenly pulled up short. Visions of Draco over the past few years flashed through his mind. It was laughable that he hadn’t noticed now that he thought about it.
Harry tilted his head so that the sun was shining directly on his face and he sighed contentedly. The park was relatively busy, but no one came near their little patch of grass and Harry wondered vaguely if Draco had set up repelling charms before he had arrived. He forced himself to focus on what Draco was saying. It was a study day and he needed to pay attention. He looked over at the Slytherin and studied him.
“I can’t believe I missed it.” Pansy worked on her lower back, bringing her left knee to touch her right elbow until they heard a pop. “What happened after that?”
He briefly considered just putting his t-shirt and jeans back on and telling her to stuff it, but thought better of it. She would probably murder him and make it look like an accident. He did as instructed, letting her dictate what shirts to put on with good grace until she was satisfied. They ended up buying the shorts, a sand-colored graphic tank with a depiction of the Kraken taking down a pirate ship on it, and a different colored teal button-down that was more greenish-blue than blueish-green. She had tried to talk him into buying a shark tooth necklace to ‘tie the whole outfit together’, but he had put his foot down on jewelry. There was only so much a man could be expected to take.
Hot blood gushed down the back of Harry’s throat and trickled into his mouth as he lay frozen on the floor.
"Don't make any plans this week. I'm afraid you're all booked up." Harry grinned. "I'm taking you out every night and I'm going to show you how Gryffindors date."
“What for?” Draco was bewildered. He certainly hadn’t expected to be hugged after bringing up one of his darkest moments.
He derived a sick sense of pleasure at the way all four of them flinched at the use of Voldemort’s name.
He frantically looked around at his blurry surroundings, searching for Draco until he realized he was laying on Sirius’s old bed. He had taken over Sirius’s room while they stayed at Grimmauld Place. Even though he had hated this house, the room still had a trace of Sirius’s rebellious spirit and it made Harry feel closer to him.
He was about to order his usual when Pansy’s words from Mestizo’s echoed in his mind, daring him to branch out a little. He quickly ordered the first thing that caught his fancy and left a five pound note in the tip jar. When he had his latte and warm wild berry scone in hand he headed over to join Draco.
“Try not to get any of your lesbian love juices all over my bed, yeah?” Daphne sighed as she grabbed her book bag and sauntered towards the door. “Be careful with that one, she’s a bit obsessed with you.” she added as an aside to Hermione.
“Hello, Tipsy.” His voice sounded oddly strangled so he cleared his throat. “Will you tell my mother I’m heading to the library to pick up a few books and that I would like to see her if she can spare the time?”
“Very distantly, and by marriage- not by blood.” Draco didn’t even look up. “Every pureblood family is related in some form or another. The Potters were a very respectable pureblood family until-”
“I know, mate. I know.” was all he said, but it was enough. Harry let out a grief-stricken sob, falling back into Ron as they both lamented their loss.
He wasn’t quite sure when he started falling for Draco Malfoy, but Harry realized quite suddenly that that is exactly what he had done. His soft lips burned across his skin as he kissed Harry with an intensity that left him craving more. When he bit Draco’s bottom lip playfully he was rewarded with a soft moan that made Harry’s cock twitch.
“Greg and Vince are coming. You have to get out. I can try to distract them-” He hissed out of the side of his mouth but he was cut off by the arrival of all four of their friends.
"Harry," Ron began, his voice grave, "whoever put your name in that goblet - I - I reckon they're trying to do you in!"
“I don’t have to tell you!” Harry snarled, anger bubbling over and consuming every other emotion in his body. How dare she?
"I can understand that." Draco huffed, his thoughts turning towards all of the pressure from his father to attend law school and take over the firm.
“It’s good to see you too.” She patted his cheek affectionately before turning to face the girls and rubbing her hands together excitedly. “Alright! Why don’t we all go out to the beach and get this party started?”
They took them to a muggle establishment that was off the beaten path and Draco stole glances at his father. Out of everyone, he would have the most issue dining with muggles. He looked perfectly at ease, however, and Draco relaxed.
Harry turned and came to join him on the couch, sitting closer than was strictly necessary. It made Draco’s heart stutter when his leg brushed against his thigh oh so casually.
“Well, that’s a start.” Draco pulled a book out of the stack and thumbed through it until he found the page he was looking for. “Here, this is a list of the Sacred Twenty-Eight in order of magical power.”
Harry was mildly surprised to discover he had been absentmindedly running his fingers across Draco’s shoulder blades. He tightened the arm that was holding him and gave his head another kiss.
“Why?” Draco looked over at him and the sunlight illuminated his silver eyes, making them seem iridescent.
"Come on, it will be fine!" Harry rolled his eyes as he tried to coax Draco to step out onto the ice.
“Have you ever seen someone under an incredibly powerful imperious curse?” Harry countered, annoyance coloring his otherwise flat tone.
Ah, yes. The reason he didn’t make a habit of hanging out with his fellow Slytherins. Judgemental pricks, one and all. Not that he blamed them, it wasn’t their fault entirely. It’s how they all had been raised.
They started circling each other at the exact same moment and Draco rushed to pull his mother and himself out of their path.
It turned out that lunch consisted of visiting some muggle attraction called Piccadilly Circus. Harry had told him that it was built in 1819 to connect Regent Street with Piccadilly and has continued to grow ever since. The roundabout that had initially given it its name was removed sometime in the late 1880's and more and more businesses moved in and expanded over the years to create Piccadilly in all of its current glory. Draco had to admit it was quite splendid; the larger than life advertisement boards wrapping around the main building, the unique architecture, and the quaint little aluminum statue of a Greek god that Harry informed him was actually Anteros, twin brother to Eros, all gave the place a certain charm.
“That was uncalled for.” Harry evaded him, laughing as Draco stumbled when his advances were met with thin air.
“You don’t have to thank me.” She smirked, finishing her coffee and standing up. “I’m sorry, but I really must dash. Places to go, people to see...parties to plan. Come over for dinner later?”
“He said it wouldn’t hurt. He said he didn’t feel a thing.” Draco’s voice faltered on the last word.
“That’s great!” Zach beamed, looking for all the world like Christmas had come early. “Who’s the lucky guy?”
“You’re too late, you missed your chance. I overpowered Draco months ago. I took his wand from him before escaping the Manor,” Harry only had eyes for the Dark Lord once again, raising Draco’s wand in evidence.
Draco swallowed the bile that had risen in his throat when he had said his name. When Rowle didn’t immediately writhe in pain his head snapped towards Draco.
“Better. I haven’t won a game against him yet. He loves to swindle his friends out of their money on their pub nights.” Dean smirked.
Harry didn't even mind when Dumbledore blatantly manipulated him into being 'The Chosen One' or whatever the bloody hell you wanted to call it. Of course, he would do everything in his power to protect the people who matter to him. He didn't need to be coerced into that.
A single tear escaped as Remus fought for control, staring up at the gossamer black veil. He looked like he could not quite believe what he was seeing. Or he didn’t want to.
“Of course, sweetheart. I know that one was always your favorite.” His mother looked pleased. “I thought your home could use a bit of the familial touch.”
Panic bubbled up as she felt some of her free will slip away when the potion began to take effect. The wretched memory of being stripped of her freedoms with one simple curse haunted her and she found it difficult to breathe. Her anxiety subsided somewhat when she found that she was still in control aside from a burning desire to tell the truth. She could handle this. She must.
Well. Besides Greg and Vince. Which was at least something, she supposed. There was also a handful of Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs that were still struggling with it, but she was a Slytherin! Clever was practically her middle name. She should have nonverbal magic down by now.
He placed one hand under Harry's chin to hold him still, using the other to clean the grime off of his face. About two seconds in he deeply regretted his rash decision. It was absurdly intimate and he willed himself desperately not to blush. When he was done he put as much space between them as possible in such a crowded booth.
“Fine, just a bit sore.” Harry shrugged, then grimaced before peeling his robes off to reveal casual muggle clothing. He shrank his robes with wandless magic and shoved them into his pocket, glancing around surreptitiously to make sure he hadn’t been seen.
“Fascinating. Absolutely incredible.” The wizard was staring at him as if he had just discovered something delightful.
Harry felt as though his heart had dropped right to the ground. His mind spun and he felt as if he were falling. Falling through the earth and sinking out of existence.
“No! You look so dashing with a bowtie!” She whined, trying to wrap the misshapen silver strip of fabric around his neck for the thirteenth time.
An old house-elf with wisps of white hair coming out of his floppy ears was suddenly standing in the middle of Draco’s living room. He was wearing a freshly pressed pillowcase and had an ugly old locket proudly on display around his neck. It was possibly the oddest house-elf Draco had ever seen. Well, aside from Dobby after he had been freed.
“They haven’t, but I’m sure if they looked they would find them.” Harry greeted her with a warm smile.
"Come on, people skated on the lake all the time at school. You can't tell me you never went." Harry was clearly more familiar with these contraptions he had informed him were called ice skates. Draco watched as he wrapped the long laces around his ankle twice before tying it off.
“You’re joking, Perce!” Fred shouted as he and Harry both took out the remaining Death Eater with twin stunning spells.
“I’m not patronizing you, these are actually quite good.” Harry flipped through the top sketchbook, chuckling when he saw a cartoon of Umbridge hopping around as a toad, but for the most part, all of the drawings were of him. It caused his heart to inflate in a way he couldn’t explain. “I don’t know why you’re embarrassed about them, I think they’re brilliant.”
Hello my lovely readers! Chapter three is a bit of calm before the storm, so take a deep breath and dive in! I want to give a massive shout-out to AlexClio and SandZhark for being fantastic beta readers. They push me to keep writing and to keep getting better. This fic would not be the same without them!
“True, but you ultimately won. This was the most fun I’ve had in ages.” Draco grinned. “Now, we’re out of tokens and I’m starving. Do you want to grab some lunch?”
“I’ll drink to that.” Draco smirked before taking a tentative sip. “It’s rather good. Bill and George made this?”
“Salazar, Draco-” Pansy walked past him to stare at what he had done, her delicate fingers resting against her lips in shock.
"He basically told me to stop being an idiot and do something about my feelings for you," Harry informed him nonchalantly.
Harry wakes up next to a lover for the first time in his life and he finds he quite likes it, Andromeda makes a dramatic entrance, Draco gets along with a toddler, and Teddy gets sticky.
The way he saw it, he would either win or die trying. The thought occurred to him that he was playing right into the hands of whoever had put his name in the Goblet. Whoever had entered him had obviously wanted him dead. But he had survived the dragon. He had the gilly weed. Harry was determined to finish the third task and win the Tournament. But he was getting ahead of himself. He still needed to survive this task before worrying about the third. Everyone threw him an irritated look and multiple people were asking where he had been as he joined the other three champions lined up on the shore of the lake. All sound faded into the background as he tried to hype himself up for this task. Cedric gave him a curious look but Harry just shook his head, focusing on chewing the rubbery plant. It tasted like seaweed and slugs. It was all he could do to keep it in his mouth.
Draco tried to answer but he couldn't find the breath to say anything. He couldn't even nod or shake his head. Flashes of the past two months rendered him motionless. Greg and Vincent's voices sounded like they were getting farther away the more he tried to focus on them. Draco couldn't move a muscle. It was like he had been petrified, but this wasn't due to any type of magic. Pure panic rolled off of him in waves. Greg wasted no time in slapping him across the face.
The other part of him thought that the little voice telling him that this happiness wasn’t going to last might have a point.
“Well, you found me. What’s up?” Hermione touched her elbow, pulling her off to the side where they had a small amount of privacy.
Harry wasn’t really sure when Draco had started calling him ‘darling’, but he found he quite enjoyed it. It managed to feel comforting and exhilarating at the same time. If he thought about it, he wasn’t entirely certain when he had started calling Draco ‘love’ either, but Draco seemed to like it so he decided pet names were alright. He had never used them with Fred and George, but for some reason with Draco it felt good- normal, even.
Ginny had gone down on him three or four times last year in secluded alcoves and behind the massive oak tree by the lake, but it was nothing even close to this. Messing around with Ginny was like flying on a Comet 260. It was fun and  it accomplished  what it needed to. Messing around with Malfoy, however, was like flying on a Firebolt. It was heart-stopping- utterly intoxicating, and so intense you couldn't remember which way was up.
"You're not intruding." Harry waved him off. "In fact, I was going to ask if you wanted to come to the zoo with us."
"I see." He said thoughtfully, twirling them around the dancefloor effortlessly. "It's sort of the same with Pansy. She's my best mate, but if someone else had asked her before I did I have no doubt she would have said yes."
Things start speeding up after the third task. Both Harry and Draco face different challenges in the coming years. Will they accomplish their separate goals?  More importantly, will they survive?
“You did what you could under the circumstances, and I am grateful.” She waved him off as Pansy rejoined her and took her hand. “Pansy and I wanted to take you out for lunch while we discuss immediate plans for getting you reintegrated into society.”
Harry eyed the still rather large pile of paperwork yet to be finished disdainfully. If he had known being an Auror would require so much writing he might have chosen a different career.
“You know what? I’m glad you’re not my healer anymore.” Harry rallied his Gryffindor courage and prayed to Godric himself that he hadn’t misread the signs.
“Oh, I don’t know about that.” Harry laughed. When Draco was done with his turn Harry decided to prove his point. “Hey, love?” He called and Draco’s eyes immediately found his.
“You won’t get anything from me! You bastards are wasting your time!” Thranduil continued, struggling against his restraints.
“Then they’re going on about each other?” Ron blinked at her. She bit back a laugh when the comprehension dawned in his eyes. “Oh. They’ve got...they’re not… attracted to each other?”
“Come here, let me help.” Hermione bossed, pulling out her wand and waving it across his face and shirt. “Tergeo!”
“He’s on his way.” Draco confirmed. The shiver of terror that ran through him was mirrored in both of his friends. “Come on, we better get going. How are we supposed to get inside? I heard Snape telling my parents that McGonagall barricaded the entrances.”
“Lemmings?” Draco arched an eyebrow as they heard multiple voices shouting excitedly and getting closer.
“Does it matter?” He focused his gaze on the lake, purposefully avoiding both Theo and Pansy’s eyes.
“It’s bureaucratic code for ‘we filed your request in the trash’.” Draco exchanged an exasperated look with his father. “No one wants to help us because we’re marked.”
When his friends did eventually corner him about avoiding them it was nice to see that they cared, but he could never open up to them the way he does with Sirius. He didn’t want them to think he was weak. He didn’t see the need to stop hanging out with Sirius in Buckbeak’s room, so he just made more of an effort to spend time with everyone else too. Harry was pleased to see Sirius join him in this venture. He even started singing carols as they helped everyone decorate for Christmas. It seemed their daily talks were doing both of them some good then. Harry was really going to miss them when he went back to Hogwarts.
“Alright then, it’s a date.” Luna sang happily before turning on the spot and drifting back into the celebratory madness.
There was a moment where time seemed to stand still as Harry fell. In that span of a few seconds, he became painfully aware that he was about to be submerged in water so he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He hit the water with a spectacular splash, sinking almost to the bottom before he was free of the momentum of Draco’s push. He could see a blurry blob that might be his glasses so he made a grab for them before pushing desperately to the surface. The water was surprisingly warm, but as soon as he came up he was hit with an icy wind. It looked like he was about a foot from the edge of the pool. His glasses would be useless covered in water so he tucked them against his shirt and swam in the direction of the wall. People were laughing and chattering wildly about being clumsy and making bad pool puns, but the only voice he heard was Draco’s.
