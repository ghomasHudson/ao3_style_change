—stopping directly in front of him. He suddenly felt very vulnerable as Harry gazed down at him, and he reached up to brush two knuckles against Draco’s cheekbone—
He scoffed. “Uh, yeah, it is?” He cleared his throat dramatically.
"Alright, fair enough," Harry grinned at him, giving him a swift kiss on the cheek. "See you soon," he let his shoulder bump into Draco's as he passed, leaving Draco alone in the hallway with a faint blush on his face.

“I said

Even worse, Draco thought, was that he was
“I suppose I could do that,” Draco grinned, and he reached for where he’d tossed his book in his hurry to get to the couch. “I usually read before bed,” he said sheepishly when Harry caught his eye.
Draco’s voice raised into a squeak, and he shook his head quickly. “Whatever, we need to concentrate on our mission. Let’s get going.”
He looked down to finally pick up the box, holding it up to the light to inspect the ring and it’s engravings. “Is this—is this my

“Wow,” he answered sarcastically, barely managing to hold back his laughter. “I didn’t realize I was that horrible of an option.”
“Yeah, that’s fine,” Harry answered, glancing at the menu that hung over the till. “Do you know what you want?”
Their room was a smaller version of the eighth year dormitories, with only two beds instead of the usual five. They had their own bathroom, of course, as well as two desks and a tiny fireplace in the corner.
Ron gagged. “Malfoy, don’t you have
"I want to kiss you," Harry whispered. He was beginning to regret this. "Never mind," he shook his head, "sorry, that was stupid—"
“As in, the kid who’s antagonized you since first year?” Sirius added.
"You—you do?"
“Good answer,” Narcissa nodded. “When the time comes, just ask Draco for the charms. I expect you never learned of them growing up.”
“Oh,” Draco rewarded him with one of his soft smiles. “Alright.”
Somehow, Harry seemed to find it funny. “Because I
this stuff could be caustic!" He wiped his face with his hand and examined his fingers.
Draco decided to let that one slide, because now his face was buried in Harry’s neck—and before he could talk himself out of it, he pressed a quick kiss to his collarbone. He nearly regretted it, too, because then Harry pulled away, blinking at him, but he leaned in again, his lips just brushing against Draco’s—

Draco sat on the floor, his back to the shower and his hands over his eyes while Potter quickly showered. It was fine—that is, until Potter opened the cap of his body wash and squirted what sounded like a generous amount into his palm.

"I dunno," Harry shrugged easily and tightened his arms around Draco. "I just feel really lucky to have you." He leaned back for a moment and watched Draco with amusement. "Are you

“So…” Harry frowned, feeling like he was missing something. “Why are
"Er, I like them both," Harry said truthfully, rubbing his eyes. "I still need to figure out what to wear."
"Er, yes, thank you Hermione—it requires that professors keep all academic materials for a certain number of years after a student's graduation. Therefore, it wasn't too difficult to gather these," he gestured to the album.
Harry huffed. "Featherlight charm, Malfoy. Just trust me."
“You can say no,” Draco clarified.
Draco took three deep breaths to calm himself down before pulling the ribbon off the cover and hiding it in his bookcase. He'd think about it later—not now, when Harry would be over at any second. They hadn't talked about doing, well,
Then, I wrenched my arm out of his grip, but I was off balance. My back hit the wall, and I was trapped.
Draco frowned into his book before finally giving a minute nod. “Alright.”
” Draco drawled as Hermione berated him for coming to class. “If one of us has it, then we all could.”
“That’s true,” Draco admitted, slumping his shoulders. “Alright.”
Malfoy leaned forward, placing his hands on the wall behind me. I probably could've gotten away— it's not like I'd never been shoved up against a wall during primary school. But—
“See?" He tightened his arms around Draco and sighed in contentment. "Of course I care," he leaned back to give him a kiss on the cheek.
Harry sighed into Draco's shirt, reveling in the rare sensation of being held. As comforting as it was, he still felt guilty—Draco was doing

But before he could get a word in, Snape swept by, quickly vanishing the contents of their cauldron.

“You can’t kill them,” Harry said wearily, “besides, I haven’t spoken to them in years. For all I know, they could be dead.”
“A bit,” Draco answered, “I’ll do some stretches before bed, I think.”
“Thank you,” Draco breathed. A weight seemed to have lifted off his shoulders. He opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by a tap at the window. Hedwig, again.

Draco arrived from work—smiling at him from behind the wheel, using his wrist to brush his hair out of his face, and waiting patiently for Draco to give him a kiss on the cheek.
“Why—why would you want to
“We can’t use magic, Potter,” Draco said sharply, watching Harry kneel in front of the hearth. “I won’t have you compromising this mission because you’re a little
Draco allowed Harry to pull him into a standing position and lead him out the Gryffindor common room. “Are your legs sore?” Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist as the blond boy clumsily descended the first of many staircases.
"I mean, I suppose you have plenty of guest rooms I could sleep in…" Harry trailed off and laughed when Draco made a face.
“So why the hell can’t we just
Harry thought—he
“If anything, this situation will serve to finally move things along—” Pansy started to say.
“We could—we could go to my place, if you’d like,” Draco suggested cautiously.
"If all goes well, I suppose not," Draco smiled wryly.
“Sure, you don’t,” Harry smirked. “It was adorable, don’t worry. So, am I really
Draco's breath caught in his throat.
This feeling wasn’t unfamiliar to him, unfortunately. Since the war ended, Harry had found himself getting claustrophobic—in the bathroom, in a walk-in closet, and

Potter frowned, and he appeared to be slowly connecting the dots as he considered what Neville had asked.
"And we would have believed you, if you hadn't thought that every fucking year!"
“I think there’s something wrong with me.”
They jumped apart when the Muggle alarm clock in Harry’s bag went off, ringing throughout the whole cabin until Harry managed to find it and turn it off. It was seven o’clock—the latest they could sleep in without getting behind on their mission.
"Harry!"
“Have you ever fantasized about someone in this room...who
Beside him, Draco seemed to be having a similar reaction.

Draco stared at him, trying to understand what Potter was saying.
He internalized this struggle, though, and by the time his parents informed him that they'd be marrying him to Pansy Parkinson (unless he could find a suitable alternative, of course) he wasn't nearly as bothered by it as he should have been. For one, Pansy was a lesbian, so at least he wouldn't have to hide
Draco said incredulously. “
“Do you
Okay, so maybe the sound wasn’t actually ‘horrific.’ For a split second, Draco braced himself for memories of the Dark Lord to wash over him—after all, he’d heard a lot of Parseltongue during the Dark Lord’s residence at the Manor. But Harry’s Parseltongue was completely different—it was much softer, nothing like the painful screeching that grated on his ears when the Dark Lord spoke it.
he said sarcastically, “a Scouring charm can only go so far, you know.”
For Draco, marriage was always a simple fact of life. Growing up pureblood, he was taught from a young age that it was just another one of his duties. He was to grow up, marry a respectable pureblood woman, and produce an heir. And for a while, Draco was okay with this—that is, until he realized that he in no way, shape, or form, fancied women.
" Draco repeated with a grin. “And for the record, you’re observant when it comes to body language, and

Draco and Potter shouted together, then glanced at each other with wide eyes.

“What do you mean?” Harry muttered, “I didn’t use a spell.”
“I never said that,” Draco said quickly.
, I just have a job that requires a lot of commitment!”
Draco relaxed as the conversation shifted, until he realized that they’d have to continue this discussion later, in their room,
as happy as he was when they returned from their Hogsmeade trip the next day. He hadn't stopped grinning the entire duration of their date, and Draco couldn't help but wonder how much his face was hurting. Draco was just as happy, though he wouldn’t show it—he’d resorted to continually clearing his throat in an effort to not smile (smiling would be against his image, you see.)
“No, it’s alright,” Harry shook his head, “I’ll be okay. I’ve got you, after all.”
“Yeah, but honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if he swung both ways,” Remus shrugged. “Remember fourth year, with your broth—”
Blinking rapidly, Harry looked up and stared at the ring in Draco’s hands. “Wh—

Hagrid shuffled to the edge of the courtyard as Voldemort silenced the crowd, bringing Harry into the castle to keep him out of sight.

more upset about losing the bet than he was about the fact that his two best mates were dating,” Sirius added.
“I was not!” Draco protested.
"Definitely," Harry answered quickly, before removing his glasses in a jerky motion. "You've smudged my glasses," he chuckled, taking his time cleaning them on his pajama shirt to keep his hands occupied. Draco pushed his hands away from his face when he went to put them back on, gently taking the frames from him. “
but just when Harry was starting to think it wasn't just all in his head, Draco would come home with a beautiful bouquet of flowers, kiss Harry on the cheek, and drag him into the bedroom.
“No, you’ve definitely got something on, mate,” Ron shook his head. “I can smell you from across the bloody table.

He was about to scoff and sit back down when Draco realized that Harry wasn’t protesting this idea at all. His eyes were fixed on him, and as Draco watched, Harry glanced down at his lips for a split second. “D’you want to take this outside?” He asked, voice low and husky.

“What? No!” Harry lifted his sleeve to smell them himself, but he couldn’t smell anything.
“Fantastic, why don’t you just add it to the
“The good news is,” Madam Pomfrey added cheerfully, “is that it seems like your original Vervé Elixir wasn’t very potent to begin with. Thus, the connection between your cores should only last three days or so. Of course, the favorable outcome would be if you hadn’t brewed your potion correctly at all, but we can’t change the past.”
When they pulled apart, Harry rested his forehead against Draco's, unable to stop the ear-splitting grin from spreading across his face. "I have feelings for you, too," he whispered.
“You’re so cute when you’re mad at yourself,” Harry laughed, reaching down to put his shoes on. "Almost as much as when you're asleep."
After everyone had finally climbed into bed for the night, and Harry was waiting patiently for the right time to sneak out, he heard a soft tap on the window. He grabbed his glasses and shoved them on his face, squinting at the owl that stared at him through the glass.
“Will you be

"I know all of your timetables by heart!" Harry defended himself.
"It is?" Harry gave him a searching look, his eyes starting to water, and Draco kissed him softly before continuing.

“I mean, yeah,” Potter frowned. “It hurt, but not that bad,” he shook his head. “But I have a pretty high pain tolerance.”
Draco watched a series of emotions flicker across Harry’s face and desperately wanted to know what was going through his mind.
“Maybe if you move your wand like—” Harry tilted his head, thinking to himself out loud. “ “Here,” he stepped closer to Draco, wrapping one arm around his shoulders so he could place his right hand over Draco’s wand. “Cast again, and let me move your hand,” he tried to ignore the strange numb feeling that came over his arms when he stepped closer to Draco.

The peace lasted for all of ten seconds. Harry had tugged on the blanket, ripping Draco’s end out of his hands. Grumbling under his breath, Draco grabbed the edge of the blanket and pulled it back over him, gripping it tightly.

But then the Second Wizarding War ended, and Draco quickly realized that it

It wasn't long before Harry noticed that something was off. It was if Draco had lost his footing, like something was throwing him off. His movements were more rigid and he started and stopped abruptly instead of weaving through the players. It didn't look like his broom was tampered with, thankfully. Harry studied the field. His eyes followed the quaffle as Ravenclaw scored their next goal, bringing the score to a tie. That was it—why was the quaffle staying so close to Draco? Usually the seeker stayed far away from most of the gameplay to allow them to keep an eye out for the snitch, but this time, the Ravenclaw chasers seemed to be following him—trying to surround him so that he wouldn't be able to spot the snitch.
"But—what about—" Harry could feel Draco's breath on his face. "What about Weasley—"

Draco tilted his head. "Would that be alright?” He asked carefully, and Harry realized with a start that he wasn’t going to mention the kiss at all—at least, not until Harry did, all in an effort to not make him uncomfortable.

something in particular, but Harry hadn’t even allowed himself to consider it.

"Just drop it, okay?" I asked desperately, and tried to smile reassuringly. "I'll be fine,

I looked between my two friends and shrugged sheepishly. "Like... like I can't breathe?"
There was one moment of silence; one moment where the world stood still. The remaining Death Eaters were quickly incapacitated as the survivors began to scream and cheer, no longer controlled by Voldemort's silencing charm.
“I don’t know, I’ll figure it out!” Draco snatched the single blanket and pillow from the bed, tucking them under his arm. Before Harry could respond, he stalked away to search the cabin in vain for any other blankets or pillows.
“So…” He paused. “I brewed the Connectivity Draught instead?”

Ron left the door open behind him and scooped up the piece of parchment that had gone unnoticed on the kitchen table. “Didn’t you see the notice?

Looking him up and down, Draco smirked. “Shame,” he said casually, snickering when Harry spluttered. “You know, for someone who was going on about how awkward I was making things, you sure are easy to rile up.”
He hurried to the couch, tossing his book aside as Harry opened his arms to let Draco slip under the afghan.
Malfoy stood from his bed. “Why are you insisting so much?” He demanded.

Harry opened his mouth to reply, and Draco jumped at the hissing sound that came out. He’d been under the impression that Harry had lost his parseltongue after the war ended, but evidently that was not the case.

“What do you mean,
Harry noticed that the hug Remus and Sirius gave him seemed a bit tighter than usual, and hoped they wouldn’t press the matter further.
He regretted his choice immediately when she smirked wickedly, tapping her finger against her chin as she thought of a question. She cast her eyes around the group as if looking for inspiration, and Harry stiffened when she made eye contact with Draco Malfoy and gave him a sly grin.

Potter was about to open his trunk when the door to their room abruptly swung open.
They didn't believe me then, either.
“Why would they blame you for getting splinched?” Draco’s stomach churned as he watched Harry’s skin fuse back together, but Harry didn’t even flinch.
No—his arms weren’t wrapped around

Draco's cloak sleeve was pushed to his elbow, letting the blood drip freely onto the floorboards. The Dark Mark had become a mess of mangled flesh, and his palm was pressed firmly to the wound in an attempt to staunch the bleeding.
“Maybe he wants to
Malfoy still wouldn't let me leave. "Mine was Flint," he said.
"You're not mad?" Harry asked softly as the first film started playing.
"Known what?"
“It never is,” Harry agreed wearily, running his fingers through his hair.

Harry tilted his head. "Yeah, maybe," he said, "I dunno if I want to go into healing. It sounds fun, though."
From that night on, his dorm mates ensured that Harry didn’t use the charms so they could wake him up from them. He was grateful, of course. But thankfully, Draco didn’t know about this, so it was back to silencing charms for him.
The words caught in his throat when Harry grabbed the front of his robes, pulling him forward and planting a firm kiss on his lips.

“That’s not what I meant!”
Meanwhile, Ron was growing increasingly red, as if he was desperately suppressing the urge to scream.
“Oh, good, you’re awake,” Madam Pomfrey greeted cheerfully, hurrying over to his bed. “Here you go, dear,” she carefully put his glasses on his face for him. “How are you feeling?”
Draco managed to break away from the Ravenclaws and started pacing the pitch, flying back and forth between the Ravenclaw goalpost and wherever the Ravenclaw seeker happened to be. It paid off, because within seconds, he'd spotted the snitch. Harry felt a burst of pride as Draco dove for it; his Spiral Dive was absolutely

In fact, he hadn't even considered what it would be like to marry Draco Malfoy, even three years into their relationship. Perhaps he was just oblivious to any hints that Draco dropped, or maybe it was because, for so long, he didn't understand

Malfoy sat stiffly on the edge of his mattress, pointedly ignoring Harry, who leaned against the wall across from him.

When they finally pulled away, Draco’s heart was beating so fast he was dizzy. Harry looked just as dazed, and he lowered his head so that his forehead rested on Draco’s shoulder. “Holy shit,” he breathed.
Potter, if anyone is going to mess up the potion, it'll be you," he retorted loudly, ignoring the way Hermione watched the interaction surreptitiously.
“All good,” Harry whispered back, and immediately pulled Draco into a hug.
"Only because he adds the milk first, like an absolute

And so, Draco was freaking out.

“I’m sorry,” Draco stopped abruptly and looked at Harry guiltily. “I haven’t asked what you got.”
Since it was so close to curfew, they didn't run into a single student on the way to Draco's dorm. By the time they made it there, in fact, they only had minutes to spare.

He pressed his face against Harry’s chest and sighed as he felt his arms around him. Harry smelled of something vaguely sweet and woodsy, though Draco couldn’t pinpoint it exactly.

Draco thought as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s torso,
Harry had been sitting on the arm of the couch, and he quickly stood as Draco neared him. Draco could’ve sworn he looked nervous—he could see Harry’s adam’s apple bob as he went for his throat. Draco’s mind went numb as he got closer.
"Mmm, right," Harry reached forward to tuck a lock of hair behind Draco's ear. "Someone has been keeping me up at night, you see."
Their lips were clumsy and their teeth clashed against one another, but Harry hardly noticed as all coherent thought flew out the window. Draco made a small, satisfied noise in the back of his throat, and Harry's knees turned to jelly.

They didn’t speak again for the rest of the day.
Draco thought as he went out into the hallway.
“For Merlin’s sake, Potter,” Pansy burst out finally. “You’re so obsessed with Draco that you can’t keep your eyes off him—even when you’re brewing an extremely volatile potion.”
“You didn’t think we wouldn’t accept you, did you?” Remus got out of his chair to join them. “Because we do! So much!”
"Oh." I said.
Potter, do you think I’d bother asking if I wanted you to say no? What kind of people-pleaser do you think I am?”
Harry's heart jumped into his throat. “I—oh,” he whispered. “Then yes.

Trying to hold back a smile, Draco bit his lip. “We’re engaged,” he said shyly.

want to marry Harry,  Draco panicked. He had no idea how Harry felt about marriage—the only time it had ever been mentioned was when Ron and Hermione had gotten married. Harry had been genuinely happy for them, and he never expressed any amount of dislike for marriage, even when Hermione called him in the middle of the night, in tears over the stress of her wedding plans. However, Harry had also never given any hints about how
He added when Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “C’mon,
He hesitated and followed Harry’s line of vision. “Whatever you’re getting is fine,” he answered, “thanks.” He headed for the door, squeezing past the crowd of people who were just entering.
“Well,” Madam Pomfrey clasped her hands together. “As I was telling Mr. Malfoy, here, the potion you were brewing in class isn’t just any potion. The Vervé Elixir—the potion that enhances the strength of your magic—has the same base as the Connectivity Draught. The primary difference between the two potions is the amount of snail slime in each potion. Do you see what I mean?”
It seemed to take Harry a moment to process what was in front of him. “You—you want me to marry you?”
“You bastard, you told me you had work until nine!” Draco swatted at Harry’s arm, making a face.
Harry was lying on his back, wrapped in a cloak that seemed much too large to be his own. The fabric covered his eyes, it's musty scent filling his nostrils and smelling suspiciously of Hagrid. He

Everyone watched as Harry peeled back the wrapping paper to reveal a sturdy leather-bound photo album. The interesting thing, though, was that it wasn't filled with photos—it was filled with scraps of parchment instead. He studied the various handwritings that filled the parchment, noticing that one of them looked oddly similar to his own.
For example, that collection of tiny ceramic goblets was from the time that Harry decided to spend the entire weekend at the wheel,

Draco tried not to let his anxiety show—he continued to shower Harry with his affection as usual, whether it was buying every ridiculous trinket that made Draco think of him, or Harry's favorite treats, or offering Harry one of his signature massages after a long day. If Harry noticed any change in his demeanor, he didn't say anything.

couldn't focus on a movie at the moment—the idea made him feel like his mind was being squeezed from all sides. It must have shown on his face, because Draco jumped up and led him to the couch, assuring him that he didn't even have to pay attention to whatever film they chose—he just wanted Harry to sit with him while they ate dinner.

Harry tried again to focus on his homework, forcing himself to pay attention. It wasn’t until he was halfway through the chapter that he realized that Draco had, once again, made his bed while he was in the shower.
Draco tucked a lock of hair behind Harry's ear, resting his hand at the nape of his neck as he leaned in to reconnect their lips.

Thankfully, Draco had had the foresight to leave a broom on the ground below the window for him to use.
"Get to the point, Potter."
Harry was cut off when Draco spun him around, pushing him up against the wall and kissing him hard. Harry's hands instinctually went to Draco's hair as his confusion and indignation vanished from his mind.
“What?” Draco scoffed. “No, definitely not.”
“Never mind,” Draco muttered, before raising his voice. “

Malfoy was without a wand—and from the looks of it, he wouldn't last long without one. With the help of Ron and Hermione, he managed to get out of the crowd and to the Whomping Willow. Harry tumbled through the tunnel, his heart jumping into his throat at the sight of Draco, crouched on the floor at the entrance.

Harry’s heart sank as he realized this wasn’t going to be a quick trip to the hospital wing.
"Yeah, that's right," Draco said matter-of-factly, reaching forward to swipe the vase out of Harry's hand. "We're keeping it."
It's like a bloody train wreck, you just can't look away!"
Draco jumped and nodded a little too quickly. “Would you mind if I waited outside?”
Draco rushed forward, pinning Harry to the wall by his hips, and kissing him roughly.
"Going to class," he answered sarcastically. "Seriously, what is
Harry's heart ached, and he couldn't take it anymore. He sat up, the cloak sliding onto the floor. Draco's shoulders shook as he tried to muffle his tears.

“Two can play at that game,” Harry said after a moment, before opening his mouth to make a horrific, inhumane hissing sound.
Ron said in horror, "that means they still have that drawing I did in charms—" he cut himself off, glancing nervously to his mum before shutting his mouth.

"A bit," he answered. The match was Slytherin versus Ravenclaw, and though Harry thought it’d be an easy win for Slytherin, Draco wasn’t quite so sure.
Harry eased the window open and swung his leg over the ledge, tossing the broom back onto the ground once he was inside. He was regretting lending his invisibility cloak to Remus at that moment—it

Draco heard a voice in the back of his head, sounding an awful lot like Pansy—

"I know," Harry murmured, resting his head on his hand. "I wonder how my parents would react. I wonder if they'd accept me."
Harry was about to answer when he jumped at the sound of knocking at the door.
“The house elves already brought your things,” she told them. Sure enough, Draco’s trunk was already placed at the end of one of the beds.
“Just give him a
Draco was torn between making a smug comment, and clutching his heart at the fact that
Harry curled his hands into fists, letting his anger wash over him, counting to five before he responded. Draco was just trying to get a rise out of him—Harry’s messiness was simply an easy target.
Draco crossed his arms, going back to Not Looking at Potter while the arguing continued. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Longbottom come running over to the eighth year table, his arms flailing.

“Oh, er—” Harry paused. “Well, Ron got me a Chudley Cannons jersey, Hermione got me a study planner for N.E.W.T.S, Mrs. Weasley made me a new Weasley sweater—”
Instead of arguing, Potter merely rolled his eyes and went to his trunk. “That’s great, Malfoy,” he pulled out fresh clothes and a bottle of muggle shower gel. “But I need to shower.” He stood up and went towards the bathroom.
Draco shifted so that his voice was clearer.
"Voldemort's dead," Harry confirmed, and Draco relaxed, slumping against Harry.
Draco headed straight for the first bed and swung the drapes shut without a word, effectively cutting himself off room the rest of the room. Harry sighed and sat in front of the fire instead, rifling through his bag. He didn’t have any spare parchment in his bag to write to his friends, and his trunk hadn’t appeared yet. He dug out a crumpled scroll and smoothed it over his knee. Hermione wouldn’t be too happy if he wrote on an old charms essay…
“Just get dressed, Potter,” Blaise said in exasperation. “So we can have dinner before Goyle starves.”
For a moment, I forgot about leaving and paused. "

The sudden realization flashed across Potter’s face, as if he’d somehow forgotten that he wasn’t clothed.
Harry laughed. “Who won the bet?”
“Pansy,” she blurted out immediately, unable to resist the Veritaserum in her system. She clapped her hand over her mouth and watched the room with wide eyes, but Draco didn’t get to see what came of her confession, for he had
I don’t need your bloody snake-language, anyway. Now, shove over!” He shuffled over on the couch so that he could lay back, propped up against a pillow. Harry took the opportunity to rest his head against Draco’s chest—which was

Now it was Draco's turn to be interrupted as Harry kissed him again, making sure to show him
Draco found it terribly unfair that Harry was able to appear so calm and collected while drunk, especially when Draco was nothing but a flustered, awkward mess. He swallowed and nodded numbly, and he was halfway to the door when Theo called out that Draco needed to spin the bottle first.
After two years of dating, they finally,

“Oh, shut up and kiss me, you prat.”
Blessedly, his silencing charms had yet to fail thus far. Sometimes, during particularly bad nightmares, Harry’s magic would disrupt the charm and cause it to fail. He learned this the hard way, when Ron woke him in the middle of the night after hearing his screams.
Harry repeated the healing spell with the Elder Wand while simultaneously casting a blood replenishing charm.

Hagrid's arms trembled with the force of his sobs, tears splashing onto Harry's face. He stumbled forward, out of the forest as Harry's head lolled to the side.
"I used to do this all the time when I was younger," Draco chuckled, "I'd get the house-elves to arrange little trays of food for me late at night and hold imaginary tea parties—you never did anything like that?

"Sure, then," Draco agreed. "You know me, always eager to read your hand-me-down reading material."
"That I'm in love with you," Harry answered, more confidently this time. His fingers tightened around Draco's wrist, pulling him closer.
Recognition dawned in Malfoy's eyes. "I know what this is," he said suddenly.
“They got you in

The problem with the pottery wheel was the time constraint—because of how quickly the clay dried, a piece had to be started and finished within the same session, or it’d be ruined.

Harry quickly pocketed the wands as his friends surrounded him, Ron and Hermione's arms wrapped tightly around him. Then there was Ginny, and Fred, and George, and his professors, and all of the survivors were hugging each other, crying and cheering.
“So they were okay with—y’know…”

“Well, I didn’t know that at the time,” Harry said dryly, watching in surprise as Draco stood from the couch and started to pace. It was a subtle detail, but Draco wasn’t looking at

your fault for insulting me during class,” Harry rolled his eyes. As much as he hated to admit it, it wasn’t entirely true, because Harry was already thinking about him before Malfoy had even insulted him. There was just something about Malfoy during potions class—the way the steam flushed his skin and left his hair in loose curls…
Draco looked up when Pansy finished off on a long note, laughing with the rest of the room when her voice cracked loudly. But then Pansy reached forward to spin the bottle, and the smile slid off Draco’s face when it landed on him.

“Mum got it for me,” Draco answered, moving to his bedside table to show Harry the bottle. “Do you like it?”
Harry was about to say something else when he tilted his head to the side. “You smell good,” he told Draco, “are you wearing cologne?”
“You’re

“Yes?”
Instead of getting angry, Harry merely looked a bit embarrassed. “I didn’t say I didn’t
"That's because he insulted me! Plus he always sits right next to me, okay? It's not fair!"
Harry blinked at her. “What?”
“Well,” Madam Pomfrey cast a few diagnostic charms on Harry. “You’re all good to go; Professor McGonagall will be here soon to bring you to your temporary living arrangements.
"Did I?" Draco frowned. "Ugh, the incantations are too similar."
“What are those?” Harry pointed to the textbook, where Draco had circled a dozen words with his quill.
"I'm not exactly sure—" Harry struggled to stand, his muscles burning. "Listen, Malfoy, about what you said—"
The turn of events was so sudden, so unexpected, that Harry

Harry snorted. “As I was saying—Fred and George made this ring for me, look,” he stretched out his fingers to show Draco the silver ring on his index finger. “It alerts me if someone’s trying to sneak me a potion or spell, like if someone cursed my mail or spiked my drink with a love potion.”
