“Turning tyrant already?”
Draco's mobile. Ron had brought it up in case Harry called. Draco scrambled off the bed—elegantly, of course—and grabbed for it.
“Harry told me about Shira.”
"Draco?"
“I understand that you’ve successfully avoided a ministry appointment,” Lucius was saying to him. “Could it be you have no ambitions in that quarter?”
“No.”
Harry and Ron were both standing up, exchanging glances. Ron pulled Draco out of his shirt, but kept a firm grip on him.
Hermione wanted to jinx both men. Hagrid for being so stubborn about Draco, and Harry for being so willfully blind to Hagrid’s faults for all these years. He should have known how Hagrid would react. He should have known that Hagrid wouldn’t accept Draco’s age as an excuse—how could he? In many respects, Hagrid was no more mature than an average teenager. He was just like Sirius in that respect.
“The people who matter to you will tell you not to marry me!”
“Of course.”
“That looks better.” Draco picked up Harry’s hand and examined it more closely. “Much better. No more puncture wounds, and there won’t be any scars.” He paused to look up at Harry. “I am sorry, though. It’s just that—”
“Well? I’m waiting for you to get started. You’ve got a lot to prove.”
Draco tumbled off of him, sat up and transformed into his human self. He was still wearing his dressy shirt and trousers from last night, though they were rumpled now.
“I'm not going anywhere you’re not welcome.”
“Enough!” Narcissa almost didn’t recognize her own voice. She never yelled. But that word, full force, had definitely come out of her mouth.
Shit, Draco had actually hung up on him. Harry blinked and stared down at the phone in his hand, wondering if he should ring his boyfriend back. He’d only been teasing. He hadn’t known Draco was so upset.
Draco sighed dramatically. "I suppose that's my cue. Goodnight, Harry. Call me back tomorrow."
Ron huffed out a laugh. “Yeah. I’m going to bring him to the shop when they’ll both be there. But I, um, haven’t spoken with Ginny yet. Or Charlie.”
“So that would be a yes.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Typical.”
"Sorry, Potter. If I'd known pulling my arse out of fires was such a high priority for you, I would have done."
“No, not always. And Draco, don’t take this to heart.” Harry’s expression softened. “I’m not trying to take anything away from all that Severus accomplished—”
->*<-
Harry nodded. “All right.”
“We should,” Draco agreed.
"Let's go sit down somewhere, Harry."
"I'm in," George piped up. "And Angelina will come." He paused to give Draco a searching look and then bit his lip. "How, er, welcome are you at most wizarding establishments?"
“What about you? Are you every kind of racist?” Maybe the question was unfair, but Ron continued anyway. “I know you were friends with Blaise, but still.”
"All right. I suppose I should meet them there and check on my future father-in-law."
Draco refused to rise to the bait. “Potter seems to think so.”
“Oh. Um, all right.” He swallowed as a feeling of dread curled into his stomach. “Is Kreacher aware of this arrangement?”
Harry sighed and pulled Draco into his arms. Draco didn’t resist. He even returned the embrace.
"This might come as a surprise, Potter, but I lacked a certain emotional maturity back then."
Of course, they had been careful in the spells they used. Harry thought there was a real possibility that any attack Draco made would bounce off Harry and strike Draco instead. But the wands seemed to understand that they were playing.
“Draco—”
He closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he knew his mouth was set in a hard line.
McGonagall, to Draco’s surprise, had greeted him evenly enough. There had been no particular warmth in her eyes, but no contempt or scorn either. And she refused to let him make an appointment; he and Weasley, she said, ought to step into her office now.
“No biting.” Draco kissed him and quite shamelessly nipped his lip. “I promise.”
He was rewarded with a bright smile. “Good.” Harry stood up and walked over to him. “Come on, then, let’s get going. I suppose the four of us should apparate to Hogsmeade . . . .”
Hermione looked alarmed. “Harry, you didn't—you wouldn't actually hurt Draco, would you?”
Was he being unfair? Harry honestly didn’t know. So he tried for a compromise. “You can speak your mind about him here, but for the sake of our relationship I don’t think we should let him come up too often.”
“Meanwhile, though, I’m still confused about something.” Harry leaned back a bit with the air of someone about to turn the subject. “You have loads of good memories here, I think, even if some of them involve quarrels—”
Harry, obviously, did not see Hagrid’s shortcomings. And it wasn’t that he was a half-giant. Draco was making an effort to curb his prejudice as far as that went. He was less successful than Harry would like, no doubt, but still.
Now Hagrid’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re visiting Lucius because of that supposed new servant of yours?”
Harry hesitated.
“Do I know that one?” Harry was smiling at Draco as he spoke. Draco’s ferret eyes couldn’t quite see the smile, but he could hear it and smell it.
Hermione stood up. “Harry, I think it's time we found Ron and Draco—”
“All right,” she said slowly. “Did Draco just meekly agree not to call Hagrid names?”
“No, tell me.”
“Only that—well, you know she was a wizarding supremacist. She despised muggles. Not the way Voldemort did, if only because she didn’t think about them as often. And she thought they were good for certain things. Manicures, for example. She and my mother both believed that muggle salons were superior—”
He hadn't intended to spend another night with Weasley and Granger, as he had no desire to be labeled a cock-blocker. Rather difficult for the happy couple to get on with things whilst a sapient ferret shared their bed—but Ron had insisted.
Draco and Kreacher both saw the trio to the door. Granger surprised Draco with a tentative half-hug on her way out. But he was so shocked that he made an awkward job of returning it, causing Weasley to snigger. Draco ignored that and turned to Harry, who gave him a proper kiss.
“That muggle dive you chose was,” Draco drawled.
“The nightmare? Never.”
He blushed. “Sorry, that was stupid of me. Did Ron have questions?”
Since they left the bedroom door open, Ron waited until he heard their footfall start down the stairs before speaking up again. “So, uh, we hadn’t met Toffee yet either.”
“Yes. Are you about to obey?”
Harry sighed. “That’s not going to happen. You’re happy with me; she’s happy with Jamie. Neither of you need an arranged marriage.”
“That’s not the same thing.”
Draco snorted. “I know who Molly Weasley is. And trust me, no smoothing over will come of this conversation. Her husband disliked every word that came out of my mouth.”
Ron scoffed. "You've got an awful lot of conditions, Malfoy. In fact, you make out a lot better than Harry in this deal—"
“Wait, they?”
Harry’s voice was even. Hermione wished she could pretend that was a good thing, but it might have been better if Harry simply exploded. He and Hagrid would soon get over a shouting match, but this calm anger on Harry’s part was something different.
“Sorry,” Draco muttered as his body finally stilled. “Thought you’d have better reflexes, you being an auror and all.”
“I’ve already sworn off the former. As for the latter . . . fuck it, I’ll try.”
Draco snorted. "They only want the Holy Saviour, you mean. They don't know Harry."
“Very well.” Draco sounded resigned as he stared down at the plans.
Even a Gryffindor, Harry decided, could practise patience.
"What about Malfoy Manor?" Ron asked.
Harry digested that. “So they don’t want to be seen with you.”
"It's not the same—"
"You specifically ordered me to bed!" Draco said in mock-outrage.
“With a canopy and all that?”
Somehow that laugh and that bit of muggle slang—even though both were mixed with a classic Malfoy sneer—cut through the tension. “I wish you had. I would have . . . I don’t know what I would have done.”
“Check and mate.” Weasley leaned back, folded his arms over his chest, and smiled with an annoying amount of satisfaction as Draco’s king knelt down and surrendered his sword.
But Harry didn’t let go of his arm. “What’s wrong? Do you just not like to apparate? It’s okay. Lots of people don’t.”
"In a moment, Potter." Draco glanced at each of his parents in turn. His mother was turning white. His father was in danger of breaking the wine glass in his hand by the sheer tightness of his grip.
"Oh, you'd have loved having me under your thumb back then."
“Is that what woke you, Potter?”
“I think you’re wrong.” He spoke with what Harry recognised as a New York accent, although it wasn’t as exaggerated as the ones he’d heard on TV or in films.
Draco had the cheek to grin at that. “Oh, it’ll only be a quarter of them, I reckon. More of them are bearable than I anticipated. But really, Harry, where do you shop for your muggle outfits?”
“Shira does have a point, Draco. Since you’re not Jewish, what inspired you to have the house kashered?”
“You don’t know that!”
Draco didn't mind that scent. In fact, he nuzzled into Potter's neck to get more of it. Why not? It would annoy Potter and make himself look like an innocuous pet at the same time.
“Right,” Ron agreed. “He and Harry struck a deal, Dad. Hermione and I were witnesses. Both of them are happy with the terms.”
“Ah.” Harry nodded. “This seems to be a . . . a frequent memory? You sitting there between Benjamin and Aunt Sarah, I mean. Oh, Jamie too?”
“Miss Skeeter,” Malfoy drawled in that posh, bored tone of his, “Harry has saved my life before, as I’m sure you know. It was during the war, at great risk to himself, when we were on opposite sides.”
“Wait. Are you saying you’ll settle for make-up sex?”
Narcissa was first down the stairs and into the sitting room. Neither she nor Lucius had bothered with proper clothes when the house elf woke them from bed; they were tieing on dressing gowns as they rushed to the boy who seemed determined to remain both a saviour and a bane to their family.
“Poor Potty. Never could handle the delicate art of brewing—”
“Well, Potter?”
The two departed with that, leaving Harry to wonder how such decent people—and he was fairly certain the Baumgartens were decent—could maintain such a friendship. Or, for that matter, how he could keep up his own civil facade with Lucius.
“Right.” Harry smiled despite the fact that he was still half asleep. “It’s an ungodly hour of the morning here, love. Can this wait?”
"Yeah, that's the one." Harry paused to consider. "I want you to tell Shira, and your parents, that it might not happen."
Harry rolled his eyes. “I see your snark isn't injured.”
“No.” Harry grinned. “Draco has more flair.”
His mother finally recovered. "There seems to be a great deal you haven't told us, Draco."
“And the others?”
“It was a rather longer conversation than that. In fact, I remember begging you to testify for my father too. And I remember you refusing.”
“No need for clippers; I can control the length if I focus—”
Draco stopped pacing and considered that. “No, Snape can’t have wanted you to fail. I’m sure he wanted to defeat the Dark Lord more than he hated you.”
“Fuck off, Potter.”
->*<-
George, who had finally eschewed the floor in favour of a proper chair, shot Draco a mischievous glance. "Harry, you ought to tell Shacklebolt that you can't find a reliable pet sitter."
How did he even know this stuff? Did all pure-blood parents teach their children about interior decorating? Did it come right after teaching them the alphabet?
Draco seemed to know, though. “Mother, you—” He broke off and put his head in his hands, not even caring that his elbows were now on the table. “Potter is not my boyfriend! That’s not why I brought him here tonight.”
Then suddenly Draco's voice was back in Harry's ear. "I'm being ordered to bed, as if I were five years old."
"Are you going to call me Draco when I'm not a ferret?"
“Kreacher, our master was joking about the cage!”
"He still slaughtered me in the end."
But Harry surprised him. “All right. I think we should meet.”
“They know he suffered a heart attack,” Draco continued, “but not from natural causes. And he was cursed at some point, but they don’t know when or by whom.”
That was news to Draco. He finally looked up. “You had a house elf tailing me? And you still didn’t figure out what I was up to?”
George came to a skidding, laughing stop near the wall as Harry grabbed Draco by the scruff of his neck and pulled him up off the floor.
“She is, but she goes out of her way to eat traif—er, non-kosher food.” He paused, looking both thoughtful and spiteful. “That’s an added benefit to kashering the kitchen actually: it will annoy Shira to no end. Jamie likes all the traditions, though, so she keeps vaguely kosher.”
“Don't worry, I believe you.”
That’s what it should be like. Why did Draco keep it so silent and sterile in his mind?
He just stared down at Draco, remembering that all faces repeated in nature, that if there were really a Creator, that Being had only made so many, and so somewhere out there was another man who was as pointy and angular as Draco—and just as hot. But that person would never do that thing with his eyebrows or laugh the same way or master the Malfoy sneer. And he would never belong to Harry the way Draco did.
She barely paused to breathe before launching into a tirade against her native Judaism in particular and all religions in general. But Hermione didn't mind, because an interesting discussion grew out of the diatribe.
Harry gave him a level look. “But you're not fine with him being my boyfriend too.”
Harry took a deep breath. “That wasn’t an earthquake, was it?”
“Muggles call that an induced coma.” Harry frowned. “If they haven’t woken him—that means they still don’t know what’s wrong?”
“Yes.” The sneer was gone from Draco’s face now. Mostly. “He was important to you. To me he was . . . well, a great man—yes, it pains me to say so, but it is true. But he was far too ruthless to have been placed in charge of a school.”
Shit. He had to apologise. He had overstepped. Draco had a right to be angry.
“I’m sorry, what?” Harry sounded as clueless as Ron.
"How could it possibly work out?!"
Draco hissed, digging his non-retractable claws into Harry’s skin.
He sat up too, furrowing his brow. "Not quite. I think I'm also Draco when you've just pulled my arse out of a fire.”
“But that’s the part I wouldn’t like—being stuck behind a desk.”
“Whenever you don’t get your way?”
Harry blinked. “Yeah. Of course.”
"And you loved that, didn't you?" Draco gave him an oddly fond look. "You loved having that power over me."
“Not at all. Though I always pictured you rescuing and restoring magical antiques or something.”
Draco reached for a pillow to smack him with, but Potter—no, Harry, damn it—moved fast enough to stop him. "Not now. We're not done talking about this arranged marriage of yours."
Draco opened his mouth and then abruptly shut it again.
“You bastard!” Draco reached for his wand, probably to sling some harmless hex at Harry. Probably.
Harry blinked. "Our lifetimes?"
"Right." Ron groaned. "All right. I'm hanging up. If the wanker's not there, I'll call you back."
Draco stirred just then and moved so that he could nuzzle against Harry's neck. Harry even felt a little ferret tongue lick his skin.
Draco snorted. “Of course I hated it. You Know Who—no, I'm done with that. Voldemort was forcing my hand. He was threatening my parents. And me.”
Harry also remembered the intense satisfaction he had felt when Lucius was sentenced. But the fact that Azkaban was such a hellhole—and it still was, even without the dementors—didn’t sit as well now.
With that in mind, he launched himself off Potter’s lap and smoothly transformed, landing gracefully on his feet. His clothing might be grimy and torn and Merlin only knew what his hair looked like, but he was still a Malfoy. He still knew how to carry himself.
Fuck it. Draco wasn’t backing out now. He climbed back onto the bed, sat cross-legged once again, and looked Harry straight in the eye.
Predictably, Harry laughed and scratched him (through the shirt) behind his ears. “All right, furball. I’ll let it go tonight.”
"Apart from you breaking off your engagement?"
His father actually fidgeted a bit at that. “I agree. But he’s still the son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black. He was still raised a certain way—”
They were only half teasing, a fact that left Harry relieved and Hermione predictably offended on Draco’s behalf. She folded her arms across her chest, looking as though she’d have quite a bit to say to her husband on the subject later.
Draco stretched himself out on the covers, utterly unrepentant.
Harry swore under his breath as he read through the message once more. "Yeah. It's a consult for the Americans. They only need one of us."
Harry sighed. “I don’t suppose we’ll be paying them a fair wage and allowing them holidays?”
->*<-
Fuck, how was he supposed to answer that? Half of him wanted to leap at the chance, but the other half knew better.
Draco looked away. “I almost killed two of our fellow students that year. One of them is your best mate.”
“Do you—are you in touch with any of them?”
Harry laughed. "Good boy."
Draco snorted. "You're so sure you're going to forbid the arranged marriage for me? What if you're over me by then?"
And there was the fact that Shira rarely emerged from her potions lab—a lab which she had quite illegally built into her cramped Hoboken apartment. Mordred only knew how many muggle regulations it violated.
“Brought?” His dad’s face was a mixture of shock at the scene before him—Merlin, he didn’t think he’d stumbled into a ménage à trois, did he?—and bewilderment at the question. “This, er, young elf answered your door. Harry's door, I mean."
“Yes. The chuppah, the breaking of a glass, people lifting us up on chairs at the reception—all of it.”
“Oh, I don’t have much more to say. Except that he really should have been sorted into Slytherin, don’t you think? He was ruthless in his quest to destroy the dark lord. And it was an ambitious quest as well.”
"I disagree," Shira said quietly. There was no sharpness in her voice now, just a pained sympathy for her friend. "That was its own type of religion, centered around the doctrine of pure blood supremacy and an evil bastard who wanted the whole wizarding world to worship him."
Harry had to bite back a grin. Kreacher, as far as he knew, had only been in Ron and Hermione’s flat once. He’d been horrified at the mess—and considering that he liked to sleep in a nest of old rags, that was saying something.
->*<-
"I know!" He did that thing with his eyebrows. "I'm just upset that Harry won't be there."
"I will," Draco promised. "But at home. After I win our bet and claim my prize, of course."
“Draco—”
He swore under his breath. “Those comments—that was me parroting my father. In truth, Weasley, I always envied you all those siblings. That’s partly why . . . well, being an only child has its drawbacks.”
"It's all right, Draco. I just want to see if I scarred you. You know, from that idiot duel and the Sectumsempra curse."
“What?” Harry asked.
“Just between us.” Harry gave him a look. “And I’d want power over you regardless of how much sex we have. And, er, speaking of power imbalances . . . .”
He tried to pull away. “It’s nothing. Let’s go.”
“I don’t want him to be my dirty little secret, Narcissa.”
Narcissa stole a glance at her husband. Draco’s orientation had never troubled him; many witches and wizards of excellent stock were homosexual. But Draco happily submitting himself to Harry Potter, of all people . . . that was more than Lucius could be expected to bear.
Draco scoffed. “Of course you are. Why not wreck my life on a whim?”
He knew what Draco looked like when he was showing off. He knew what Draco looked like when he was sucking up. He knew what Draco looked like when he was mocking someone—usually someone he considered inferior—and enjoying it.
“Yeah. Of course.”
"She won't be wrong. And I hope she calls you a Potter."
The silence was unnerving; there wasn’t even a breeze blowing to rustle the grass. Ron finally opened his mouth. It couldn’t hurt to try for a conversation. “You handled that well. That whole—that situation with Hagrid, I mean.”
Harry had expected that. This office didn’t seem a likely place for storing childhood memories about house elves, so those memories must be deeper down. Behind another password, no doubt. He opened his mouth to ask what sort of memories were here, but abruptly shut it again. He did have some training in legilimency, damn it. He would figure this out.
“I do. But I want . . . I want to know more about you too.”
“Yeah.” Harry swallowed. “I knew a life debt was a real thing—Dumbledore said as much back in third year. But I didn't know it was so formal—”
Harry laughed and then kissed his hair. “I’m cold.”
"Well, that's the only way it's going to happen."
Better yet, it seemed more personal than most of Malfoy Manor. The books on the shelves looked worn and thumbed-through. There was a framed muggle photograph on the wall of Draco arm in arm with a goth girl. That was Shira, most likely. It was obviously taken near Manhattan: they were leaning against the railing of a pier with the twin towers standing proudly behind them, just across the river.
"Ah, no." Ron grabbed the scruff of his neck and resettled him on his own chest.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Too bad you didn't think of it before you agreed to go undercover. You could have saved us an explosion."
"I reckon that's true on both counts," Draco said.
“Yeah, and I think that makes sense. I used it for wards that took weeks or even months to set. And you were always good at long-term projects. Not too many people would have had the patience and persistence to fix that vanishing cabinet.”
Harry gave him a look of polite disbelief.
Draco stared for another moment and then snorted. “I wouldn't blame you if you were. Look, I'm sorry for what Fenrir did to you. I didn't mean to let him into Hogwarts, but you, er . . . you have a right to hold me responsible—”
Right. Draco was ready. He was ready. So Harry raised his wand, took Draco’s hand in his spare one, and spoke the incantation.
“I’m sorry, Draco.” Harry used his free hand to pull at his hair. “Your father might have deserved his sentence, but no prison should . . . shit. Inmates shouldn’t be cursed or abused.”
Her office, it turned out, was not Dumbledore’s old one. Presumably she used that for her personal quarters but she did not wish to be so remote during the day. One had only to step inside from the courtyard to reach her.
Lucius snorted. “You can hardly blame us for leaping to that conclusion, Draco. You’ve apparently regaled Mr. Potter with stories of our muggle interests, you insisted on this dinner, you invited him to be your plus one at an event in New York—”
“What’s that lot need protection for?” Hagrid reached for three fragile-looking porcelain cups. “They came through the war just fine. Far better than they deserved.”
Hermione was predictably fascinated. She asked Harry to tell her, over and over, how Draco was actually able to curate his memories and protect them with a password.
“I know there were extenuating circumstances.” His father leaned forward in the chair. “I was there at the trials, Ron. I remember Harry’s testimony.”
“I suppose not.” Draco hesitated, but then motioned to the desks around them—or perhaps to all the people in them. “Is this your first look at a muggle office? Did your muggle family ever bring you to one?”
Hagrid’s brow furrowed. At length, his shoulders sagged and he let out a long sigh. “Suppose that’s reasonable. So to him, Buckbeak’s just a predator.”
“Right.”  He pulled away so that he was able to retrieve and rearrange the blankets.
His dad blinked. “Are you moving house? I mean, er, are you moving to Grimmauld Place?”
He was ready, he supposed, yet he suspected there were other memories locked away here that were more important. Memories that might even shed light on why Draco could no longer apparate or why he thought he couldn’t cast a patronus.
“So the idea is for me to produce Jewish, pure-blood children who will grow up to be outstanding wizards.” Shira paused to give Draco a judicious look. “And you must admit that Draco will make beautiful babies.”
“He’s gone thanks to you.”
“And Shira’s aunt taught me to become an animagus and some wandless magic to boot. Plus I kept up my occlumency and potions, my skills in working with enchanted objects, even threw myself into muggle finances. I’m not completely useless, you know.”
Draco frowned at that, unsure of the etiquette involved. It was likely fine, though. The Ark was closed tight; you couldn’t see anything of the Torah scrolls inside.
"Slytherin's colour? Really?"
"Almost always," Draco muttered, probably thinking about the face-stomping incident.
Harry was falling again, but there was no swirl of thoughts and memories this time, and he landed gently on his feet—in the middle of a muggle office.
"—and the final time was last night," Draco finished, ignoring him. "He's made quite the habit of rescuing me."
Fuck. Draco didn't know whether to laugh or to pull his hair out. "Ah, this has been a lovely dinner, but perhaps we should put off the rest of our discussion until morning."
Meanwhile, Jamie, like Shira, was seated in an armchair. Both women looked at ease despite the fact that they were wearing elaborate, corseted, black dresses—almost as if they were Victorian widows.
“Is that even real?”
But he didn’t like the chivalrous way Malfoy offered Hermione his arm. Or the way Hermione took it, rolling her eyes but smiling at the same time.
“It’s real for Harry too, you know.” Ron shook his head ruefully. “But if this is how he likes it—well, it’s no wonder things didn’t work out between him and my sister.”
“Good. No reason Shira and I can't fly into Heathrow next week.”
"You have too narrow a view of friendship."
“Are you saying you knew that back at Hogwarts?”
He looked to Harry. “You’re not upset, are you? This isn’t half-bad.”
An awkward silence passed. Neither of them spoke; both just listened to the cordial mayhem of the office workers.
“It’s all right. And I’m sorry for teasing you.”
Harry swallowed and turned back to Draco. "Look, your father has to keep himself absolutely clean from here on out. I can't do anything if he gives Robards an excuse to charge him with some new infraction."
"Yes, mother."
->*<-
“I meant to harm Dumbledore.”
“What?” Draco smirked. “About to issue another order, Potter?”
Hermione had already guessed as much—and so had Draco, probably—but she still felt her face go white. No wonder Ron had left with him. He wasn’t just helping to smooth things over with Hagrid; he was acting as a bodyguard.
But he needn’t have bothered. A house-elf stood trembling next to his bed, and it did not seem to have any nefarious designs on him. Everything was blurry without his glasses, but Harry was fairly certain he hadn’t seen this one before.
Still, Ron would hear it too. If she asked his opinion, he wasn’t going to lie: Harry had every right to control Malfoy’s life, both because of the life debt and because it was what Malfoy wanted. If he didn’t want it, he could walk away.
“Austere instead of extravagant. Think Napoleonic: a few bold, rich colours set off by plenty of white. Military touches here and there. Lots of wood showing, a bit of marble, and perhaps some well-polished brass.”
“Toffee knows!” She disapparated immediately.
"No, let's just—"
Kreacher coughed, interrupting any response on Harry's part.
“Ahem.”
But it wasn’t about that. And it wasn’t just Draco ingratiating himself with the Golden Trio either. No, Draco seemed content to give up control—eager, even—as long as he liked and respected the person he was handing it over to.
"With due respect, Granger, I think it is the point." Draco quirked his eyebrows at her. "Potter and I are just negotiating an agreement between two consenting adults. There's nothing legally or magically binding about it."
“I despise you right now, Potter.”
“You’re thinking of that damned vanishing closet again?”
Draco, meanwhile, was fishing out his wallet.
Harry laughed again. “Come on. You enjoyed the greasy food. And you and Ron were civil—almost friendly, really. And you and Hermione were doing some weird platonic flirting thing.”
“Enough!” Ron looked up toward the ceiling, as if summoning divine aid. “Just come out with it, Ferret. If I can keep it confidential, I will.”
->*<-
->*<-
“Well, maybe it will be romantic.” Harry was grinning outright now; he couldn’t help it. “You promised me that date at the cinema, remember?”
“One of the few,” Draco agreed as he turned back to George. “Look, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for siding with Umbridge and with . . . with the wrong side during the war.”
“Shhhh.” Harry shifted and wrapped his arms around him. “I didn't mean to dredge up the past. Just meant you're good at that sort of thing.”
“Then let’s get on with this. You’re not even past my first layer of security.”
Harry opened his eyes and just stared for a few moments. Then he walked down the aisle, pausing at one pew in particular before continuing on. When he reached the front of the sanctuary, he turned around and sat down on the first step of the bimah.
"Harry, mate, I didn't want to tell you this, but it's already all three. Why do you think I haven't brought you two 'round the Burrow yet?"
“Enough, Potter!” Draco gave him a look. “You got what you wanted. Now lean back and let me show you what a good servant I can be.”
He raised his eyebrows. “Harry dating me?”
“And how are you getting on with Lucius and Narcissa?”
Draco only cared that he was actually living a long-standing, top secret, shameful dream: kissing Harry-fucking-Potter . . . kissing the man he had once regarded as his worst enemy. The man he had hated for years, with all the passion and loathing and pent-up lust a stupid teenager could muster.
Draco stared at the figures retreating downstairs before turning back to Ron. “What?” he demanded in a whisper. “I wasn’t rude to your father.”
Harry paused to consider that. “Actually, it is, isn’t it? Either way, I mean. But nothing went wrong. I didn’t run anyone over or cause an accident. And I’ll be extra careful driving in Manhattan.”
Draco turned back to him with an odd expression and then burst out laughing. “No, Harry. They were adult books with plenty of sex. Quite explicit, some of them.”
But his parents weren’t there to guard him in Hoboken or Manhattan. So Draco, Shira and sometimes Jamie would rattle their way through the tubes under the Hudson River, ending up somewhere beneath the twin towers. Then they’d exit into an underground concourse, occasionally stopping at one of the little food places before heading up and out so that they could walk the rest of the way.
Harry smiled a little. "It didn't break, did it? Did you have to fix it with magic?"
Whatever the fallout, Harry wasn’t at fault. Ron repeated that over and over in his head as the foursome made their way along Diagon Alley. Robards should never have left Malfoy to die. He probably shouldn’t have blackmailed Malfoy into becoming an agent either—although that was murkier territory. The aurors had never been saints; Ron was well aware of that.
“Right.” He blushed. “Er, muggle finances.”
“—and that you weren’t a good master for a house elf.”
“It will be plenty comfortable, I promise. Pity to see my rococo dreams laid to rest, though.”
“What the—Hermione, you know it’s not like that.” Harry forced himself not to raise his voice. “You know I’d keep all the Malfoys safe even if he broke up with me. Even if he wanted to cancel this life debt.”
“I know. I was stupid. Impossibly stupid. But it was partly Snape’s fault too.” He paused. “I’ve learned to love the memory of that man. But back then . . . .”
“Harry, whatever you’re thinking, stop.” Draco tugged him closer, encircling him in his arms. “You’re only duty tonight is to show me just how good you are at make-up sex.”
But they
“Are you reasonably experienced in legilimency?”
Harry counted to five before answering. “I know the worst about him, all right? I’m not an idiot.”
Harry gave him a playful shove in return. “So sorry I don’t have your vast experience.”
Draco ignored that question and continued with his own line of thought. “But then you spoke up for me and my mother at the trials. And then—Circe, Harry, I still don’t even know how you found out I was Robards’ agent. Or how you knew I was in danger. But you saved my life again, risking your own again. Not to mention your career.”
“No.” Draco shook his head. “Weasley respects the life-debt between us. Granger doesn’t, so I can’t go to her with this.”
“What were you about to say?” Ron cocked his head at him.
“I really won't hurt him,” George promised. “No wands, no fists—not even any practical jokes.”
Malfoy opened his mouth to respond, but then shut it again. After a moment, he just nodded.
The four of them? Draco’s brain seemed to stop working.
Besides, Malfoy was treating.
“So you like them well enough?”
“I know that. Now. Maybe I knew it then, I dunno. But it doesn’t matter. I . . . I needed those three years, Harry.”
Draco had been hovering in the background, but he put himself deliberately in view by standing behind Harry and encircling him in his arms. “I dunno. Potter’s grown on me, I suppose.”
"Right."
“First you came back for me in the Room of Hidden Things, or Room of Requirement or whatever we’re calling it. You risked your life to save mine.”
"No, I don't." Harry paused for a breath. "I also promised Hermione I wouldn't."
“Well, yeah. I don’t know that I thought it out that far, but . . . .”
“Of course I do. A moronic saviour, obviously, but still both my personal saviour and the saviour of our British wizarding community.”
“I—I’m sorry, Hagrid,” he stammered, “for everything I did as a Death Eater, and for my, ah, ill-informed prejudices beforehand.”
“Calm down, Harry.” Draco looked amused in a wry and bored way. “Not that I mind being manhandled . . . .”
“Tell me, then.” Harry looked him in the eye. “Now that your wedding to Shira is off, do you still want to convert?”
“Oh yeah.” He kissed her again, holding her tighter this time. “And I promise you, it will work.”
There would also, however, be no Weasley to scoop him up. Draco yipped at that, squirmed, and then put his paws on Weasley’s face, reminding him that he still had nails, trimmed or not.
He perused the article next:
"Oh, I'll do that either way."
“Will the ferret-grooming keep till tomorrow, then?”
Hagrid's face—well, what Harry could see of it through the beard—turned a startling shade of pink. “Oh, well, you know how the students are at the end of term. Reckon she has her hands full enough.”
Harry looked up. “So you believe me?”
“Yes, Potter,” he drawled. “I’m aware.”
Harry wasn’t ready to smile back. Not whilst he was still bleeding.
“Tosser.” Harry gave him an affectionate punch to the shoulder. “So you promise not to repeat any of this? You can discuss it with Ron and Hermione; they already know. But no one else does.”
“Several.”
But Draco wasn’t there.
Benjamin rolled his eyes. “Get a job, like a normal person.”
“Yeah? Well, he wasn’t wrong about that.”
Harry grinned at him—he couldn't help it. "Bet you vote Tory."
“You know what? Fuck off.”
Draco let out a long-suffering sigh. “I’m waiting for you to get to it.”
Draco kissed the back of his neck. "Not to most of Britain's wizarding world, Harry. You know that." He paused to shift again, allowing his hands to work their magic just above Harry's arse. "What's really troubling you? So what if Skeeter publishes the truth? Nothing terrible will happen to Robards, you know. At worst, he'll be forced to resign. But he's too talented to be ruined. He'll weather out the scandal and end up heading some other important part of the ministry. At least that's what my father thinks."
Ron should have known. As soon as he saw that weird flirting between them back at Hermione's office, he should have known.
By the time Draco rang off, Hermione was changing in the bathroom and Ron was changing on the other side of the bedroom.
George picked him up and then set him down on his lap. “You’d make a great therapy pet, Malfoy. Why don’t you leave Harry for me?”
Harry, who was sitting cross-legged in that same spot, opted for the truth. “Draco wants to ask Ron for advice about his life debt.”
Draco was still staring at her, but now his eyes looked both startled and oddly gentle. He nodded slowly, as if it did make sense to him. But then he shook himself and pointed toward the laptop. “You’ll be due at the ministry soon—shall we get back to work?”
“Delighted to hear it,” Lucius said. “Still, no need to flaunt your relationship in public. Especially now, when only the most traditional families still respect the concept of arranged marriages—”
Funny how Malfoy’s words had burned so much at the time. Now the memory only brought a wry smile to Harry’s face.
Draco swallowed, remaining right where he was. “About Fenrir?”
Harry considered him for a long moment, and then nodded. “Are you willing to begin again, then?”
“No,” Draco continued. “It was a Death Eater higher in Voldemort’s favour than my parents were. He agreed to protect them and me in exchange for—”
Shira nodded. “It’s really insulting. So she’s not highly motivated to support a traditional pure-blood marriage.”
“Obviously.”
“Just so. And yes, teaching is sort of the family profession.” Draco’s voice was tinged with affection. “Meanwhile, I presume everything went smoothly at the airport?"
"His belongings are all unpacked in your room, Master."
Draco inclined his head toward Potter. "That's up to my new lord and master."
"Harry . . . ." Draco sighed and leaned down to kiss him—another gentle, chaste kiss. "There. I can behave myself."
“I always thought you were projecting a bit.” Shira raised her eyebrows at Draco. “Maybe you’re the one who wants to be licking—”
“No, not with Dobby. I didn’t know him well.” Draco looked away from Harry then, his features tight. “The house elves assigned to the kitchen would give me a treat and let me sit in a corner and read. We didn’t speak much; I don’t know if they realised I had, er, borrowed the books from my mother’s private library. Or that I should never have been reading them at my tender age.”
“Fine.” He swallowed. This could go very, very wrong. “What do you want?”
"None." Draco winked at him and made a satisfied chirrupping sound that was impressively close to the way he could dook as a ferret.
That was, oddly, the most comforting thing Harry could have said. It even surprised a laugh out of Draco.
"Hetero virtue?" Harry propped himself up a bit too. "How do you know I'm not a little bent?"
“You mean resume, right?” Benjamin crinkled his brow. “Well, for a job like this, you’d have get into a good college or university. And ace the right courses.”
No, not mudblood. Draco had sworn off that slur. So make that muggle-born know-it-all.
That question played straight into Harry’s hand; it gave him an opportunity to explain Draco’s use of occlumency in great detail. With any luck, she would be too distracted to bother lecturing him.
Harry turned to find Shira barreling at him. She wrapped him in a bear hug—he could feel every bit of boning in her corset—and then released him to look up at his companion.
Draco dooked smugly in response.
Draco huffed out a laugh, short and dry. “I thought you wanted to see my memories of Dobby?”
The 'moronic' bit surprised a laugh out of Harry. “Are you serious?”
"Wait." Ron was suddenly wide-eyed. "They'd make a grown man get circumcised?"
Draco shrugged. “Not as though I have much choice.”
"I'm not meeting anyone official until tomorrow afternoon. I'm supposed to be recovering from jet lag till then."
Harry turned to face him. "Er, should I know who that is?"
Harry stared at him. “Do you actually want to work at a place like Cantor Fitzgerald?”
He shook himself, and suddenly he was back in the offices of—what was this company called? Cantor Fitzgerald, right. For a moment, Harry was back in his own head. But he closed his eyes as another memory tugged at him; he could feel . . . Merlin, so many things at once. His head was swimming. But there was a warm hand on his shoulder, helping him find his centre again.
"I told you I'm a romantic. And I do want you all for myself."
"Look, I'm not trying to." He paused, feeling the slightest tendril of fear curl in his stomach. He would never make the mistake of underestimating Potter’s temper; he’d been on the wrong side of it too many times. "You're not going to start another muggle brawl with me, are you? Because I've no desire to try and punch above my weight—"
“I have faith in you. And I won’t block any memories that concern Dobby. I retain the right to block anything else, however.”
“Yes.” Draco’s voice was thin and completely devoid of any snark or sneer. “She’ll be up.”
Draco climbed off of him and held out his hand. "Then take me to this muggle cinema. Even a platonic date ought to lead us somewhere."
“Oh yes. Master Draco explained to Kreacher how Toffee will be assisting with the renovations. And Master Draco is saying to me, in private, to always pretend that Kreacher is in charge.”
So he was sanguine enough as he and the Golden Trio signed their names at the gate of Hogwarts. He even managed to make small talk with Weasley as they walked across the rolling lawns, past the quidditch pitch, toward the small, cramped hut.
“Both.” Draco spoke without hesitation. “Sorry to disappoint you, but I’ll always be both.”
“You really don’t.” Harry gave him a pointed look. “But I do understand. I wasn’t the only sacrifice he was willing to make. He was the greatest wizard of his age; he could have told you at the beginning of sixth year that the Order could hide you and your mum from Voldemort. Instead, he let you play your hand—”
Harry smiled a little. “I know I haven't met them properly, but Shira and Jamie seem like the right sort.”
He could hear a smile in Draco’s voice as he answered. “All right.”
“Just financial evidence?” Weasley looked puzzled.
“Oh, Crabbe, Goyle and I might have inconvenienced some first years. And possibly Longbottom. But, believe me, you were my main target. Followed by the rest of the Golden Trio, of course.”
Hermione coughed before anyone could respond. “Excuse me.” She placed a hand over her chest and paused for a breath—not that she was fooling anyone. “Draco, I'd like to discuss the information on the flash drive with you. Shall we go down to the dining room and look it over?”
“You didn’t mean to harm them.”
"Normally I wouldn't either, but what with you being my lord and master . . . ."
"My dad won't loan it to us."
“Ah.” Draco nodded. “Yes, our master thinks Granger’ll make a fuss over more slave labour here. But she’ll find out about Toffee sooner or later.”
"In the New York area? Probably not. I did, but only because the Baumgartens never met a muggle appliance they didn’t like.”
Draco responded by nuzzling against his neck.
"It's clearly not perfect as you're tensing up again." How did Draco manage to sound haughty, exasperated and kind all at once? "You can do some of your own kvetching, whining and whinging, you know. You're entitled."
“Yeah, it does.” Harry fell quiet for a moment. A long moment. “I don’t think it answered my question, though. Or perhaps I asked the wrong one. I want to know how important this is to you? You were willing to convert in order to marry Shira, yeah?”
But Draco surprised him. "My personal fortune started with gifts from various Malfoys and Blacks," he explained. "But I've enhanced it with my own legitimate investments—not by cheating muggles."
"Doesn't look like an act." Harry initiated another chaste kiss, but stopped himself from pressing for more. "Sure you want people to know about this life debt?"
Draco's voice was almost painfully cautious as he answered. “I don't know. But they like to get ahead of stories about the family. You know, control the narrative and all that.”
“If we hadn’t met again, I mean. If everything had played out how it was supposed to.”
The words were soft and disturbingly earnest. Draco felt his jaw drop.
Harry felt a curious flip in his stomach as some of his anger melted away. Apparently Draco actually worried for him. And apparently he already considered Grimmauld Place, Harry’s home, to be his home as well.
Draco adjusted himself again as they continued to chat about the game, closing his eyes as he sprawled against Ron's chest. This was good, he decided. He only wished Granger were here too, so he could account for each member of the Golden Trio. The ferret side of his brain liked knowing where all his people were.
Harry collapsed on his bed with what was probably a stupid grin on his face. Draco collapsed right next to him, smiling just as broadly, so at least he had no right to judge.
But she thought that Harry should be seen out and about with Malfoy, so the paparazzi—another muggle term—would see that he wasn't abusing the ferret. Their relationship should look 'friendly and respectful.'
Harry turned his attention to Draco. “You beat Ron?” He sounded impressed.
“Brilliant of you to notice, Potter.” Draco’s drawling voice was raw, but clear enough now. He had finally roused himself enough to shift his head. “No wonder you're the new poster boy for the aurors.”
“Are you requesting a tamer second date?”
“Oh, they’re already trying. They want me to join them—along with Shira and Jamie—at a wizarding restaurant for Draco’s birthday. He’s turning twenty-one on the fifth.”
All right. Harry couldn’t stop himself from smiling. “Kvetching? We’re using Yiddish now?”
“And you said you didn't do this.” Harry narrowed his eyes.
"It's fine, Ron." Harry held out his hand to Draco. "I accept. All of it, I mean. The, um, payment of the life debt, the conditions—everything."
“He did. He also still refers to him as an oaf. Or he would do, if I hadn't made him stop.”
“It’s not even his house,” Shira muttered.
Fortunately, Shacklebolt had accepted the new arrangements: Harry would land in Newark, where Benjamin and Noa would collect him. They would bring him to their home in a New Jersey suburb, which was, apparently, a short train ride from Manhattan.
“Her father’s not overjoyed. But, honestly, Noa—that’s Shira’s sister—is exceptionally strong-willed. She’d have married Benjamin even if her family disowned her for it.” Draco paused to give Harry an ironic grin. “But at least he’s Jewish.”
“Doubt that. I always beat you on a broom, remember? Reckon I’m by far the better driver too—”
"But I'll accept that there was some miracle involved when you died in the forest and then returned to us. Through the power of the stone or . . . whatever. I’m grateful for that miracle, but I don’t intend to overthink it.”
Draco gave a sort of non-committal hum. “I knew you'd like him. But he doesn't quite count; he’s not really a Baumgarten.”
“I was, yeah,” Harry admitted.
“Yeah, Ferret, I am.”
He kept scrabbling and twisting, but suddenly stilled as he saw the look Potter was giving him. Well, not saw, exactly. He couldn't grasp human expressions as well in this form. But a hundred little things told him that Potter had just reached a decision . . . and that it had nothing to do with that love bite.
“Mostly I’m a bleeding heart when it comes to whiny brats.”
Potter had testified for Draco and Draco’s mother, keeping them both out of Azkaban. All of Draco’s pleading couldn’t convince him to testify on behalf of his father too . . . but Potter had promised he wouldn’t testify against him either. And he wouldn’t speak out against any deal the man cut with the ministry.
His voice was angry, but there was a note of pleading in there too.
There was a smirk in Draco's voice as he answered. "You could plan to spank me properly when you get home, instead of teasing me with a smack to my arse here and there."
Harry grinned. "I know. But you'll have to take him as your third, you know, if anything happens to me."
Draco swallowed. “I don’t even know how to navigate your world.”
“Draco, you don’t have to live your life to please your parents!” Harry gave him a look that was half exasperated and half affectionate. “I’m sorry if they’re stupid enough to reject their own grandchildren, but . . . you’re supposed to be serving a life debt to me, yeah? And I only care how you would feel about children by adoption or surrogacy.”
It was a bizarre situation, really. Bill's scars always drew looks from strangers, and some knew that a werewolf had caused them, but people weren't generally terrified of him.
“They’re protected by passwords, Harry.” Draco kept walking as he spoke, not even bothering to glance behind.
Draco gave a short, bitter laugh. "Neither. I don't think I could have gotten it up for anyone in sixth year. Not even you."
"Shira!"
That gentle look was back in his eyes, softly gleaming the same way it had just after the trials. “Your wand belongs to me now. But . . . well, so do you.’
“Yes. Mine was perfect. And their home is perfect—I didn’t expect a ramshackle old Victorian. Or, er, whatever the equivalent era is here.”
Draco hesitated. “You didn’t object to the public part of the deal,” he said at last. “I know you wanted to, but you didn’t. But if you had ever told the Wizengamot what you really thought—that my father should rot in prison—he’d have spent the rest of his life in Azkaban.”
"I don't. They're not going to murder me, are they, to put the place back in Malfoy hands sooner?"
“So were you.” Hagrid heaved himself down onto a bench. “And I notice you didn’t go around trying to have an innocent hippogriff murdered.”
So Ron was in a decent mood as they left. He was ready to face the members of the press who were hovering outside, a barely respectable distance from Coralia’s front door. (Some of them must be paparazzi; there were plenty of cameras out there.) He kept his wand at the ready, though, in case anyone in the crowd thought to take a shot at Malfoy.
But, despite Harry's thoughts on the matter, Hermione didn't believe that Draco had ever secretly admired Ron. His contempt for him had always been obvious. So this new-found respect for her husband was all the sweeter.
“I’m still not sharing that one.”
"No. Sorry, but I like seeing a Malfoy bow and scrape."
“I thought perhaps you wanted to stay here now. Now that you’re really back.”
“Wiltshire? We’re in the kitchen of Malfoy Manor, then?”
“Transactional sex,” Draco said at last. “I was paid in favours, not coin. It happened during the war, while Voldemort controlled Malfoy Manor.”
Draco snorted. “Just a little. Mostly I was head over heels for you. You’re—well, let’s just say the role of the Holy Saviour suits you.”
Kreacher's little cough reminded both men of his presence. “Master should remember that he had promised to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley yesterday evening. Master missed the appointment. They have both just apparated near the house and will soon be outside the do—”
“Good.” Draco was still leaning alongside of him, so close that his breath was warm against Harry's neck. “That's sorted.”
“I don’t.” He gave her hand a wary look, but didn’t shrug it off.
Ah. So Draco considered his mother the arbiter of interior design questions.
“I bet only old-school pure-bloods treat it that way.” Ron folded his arms as he took a seat on the arm of the little couch. “And you don't have to let him live here. Lots of ways he can serve you without being in your face all the time.”
“Your family—are you serious?”
“You rescued Mr. Malfoy in the line of duty, did you not?” Her eyes lit up in false admiration. “A brave auror pulling an agent out of a fiery trap?”
That wasn't lost on Weasley, who was grinning. "But you're making the copy anyway."
That wasn’t enough to satisfy Harry. Or Ron. As for Hermione . . . well, she was still next to Bill, holding her breath.
“And he’s not going to react well to this one,” Weasley added.
“What about . . . I mean, are you traumatised?”
"What?" Harry's jaw dropped. "Did your father—what did he do to muggles?"
Harry put the wand down, rubbed his eyes, and glanced at the other side of the bed. Empty. Apparently ‘Master Draco’ was already up and about, so he turned back to the elf. “Uh, have we met?”
“Yes. Speak it and you can go deeper.”
“He doesn’t!”
He frowned at the shop. His brother wanted him to quit the aurors and come work with him instead. Ron thought about Robards, and how he both admired the man and despised him. For the first time, he was tempted by George’s offer.
Harry sighed and reached out to him. Somehow there was too much space between them now. “Come here.”
“I don’t even know if they had me christened.”
In a good way. Yes, it was a fucking miracle that Draco had changed his opinion of muggles so much, and it was definitely a good thing.
"Harry, are you upset?"
Harry shrugged. “Maybe? Let's give it a try.”
“Is this an order?” Draco demanded, snapping out of his shock.
“For what?” Draco sat up too and arched his eyebrows. “Dragging me to that oaf’s hut?”
"Don't expect them to be overjoyed at that prospect."
Harry didn't pull away, but he looked surprised. Surprised and a little wary.
"How?"
Harry closed his eyes. “How much will it bother you? Being the spouse of an auror, I mean.”
Draco gave him a sleepy smile. “No, I don’t feel like training up your virginal tongue tonight.”
"Um, no. It doesn't take to combing—"
It would feel quite different, converting on his own and finding some London synagogue to join. The Baumgartens came with everything required, so to speak: built in places for Seders, Shabbat dinners, and the like. He and Shira would just subject themselves to the normal arguments: would Shabbat be a thing in their house? Should they send the kids to Hebrew school? And how much of Christmas should they celebrate with Draco’s parents?
“No. Dunno how she would have reacted to that, at least while they were dating. I just meant . . . look, Ginny was never the subservient type.”
"Not necessarily." Harry stood up too and, to Draco's astonishment, took his hand. "I think we can handle anyone looking for trouble."
His eyes lost their hard glare. “I could have done, yeah. But you being my lord and master and all—”
“Great idea!” Harry beamed at both of them, making it near impossible for Hagrid to refuse now. “Hagrid, we’ll talk soon. And Shira, I’ll see you back at mine.”
“Thank God! I don't want to be treated like a messiah or something.”
“That’s not how this works!” Harry tightened his grip.
He received only a grunt in reply.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “It’s not like that. Look, I can’t match you in potions or occlumency—you know that. And I’m not an animagus. But when it comes to the stuff I can do . . . well, I’m a decent teacher.”
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “Wouldn’t that rule out Draco? The Jewish part, I mean.”
Draco arched his brows. “Which are you hoping for?”
That wasn’t enough, though. “I’m not sensing anything about you sitting in a corner with those dirty books, Malfoy.”
Did he?
“Percy?” Hermione blinked as she sat up and drew her knees to her chest.
"Don't worry, Weasel." Draco made a show of releasing her. "I'm safely bent."
Harry stopped pacing and stared at him. “Are you seriously defending a pure-blood tradition? That's all this arranged marriage is about: keeping up 'pure’ bloodlines.”
“Oppressive?”
Draco let out a shaky laugh. "You're lying through your teeth right now."
Merlin, that was tempting. Harry didn't jump to agree, though, for a number of reasons. "But you love your parents. You love your family."
She didn't argue that, turning back to the original subject instead. “Why is he asking Ron’s advice about boundaries?”
George laughed. "You're not going to an execution, Malfoy. Don't worry; we’ll see to it that you enjoy yourself."
No bones were broken; Harry was sure of that. Well of course they weren’t. This wasn’t real, at least in the sense that Harry wasn’t physically here. He shook himself, remembering how legilimency worked.
“Malfoy?” Harry choked out the word—he could still taste the smoke in his throat.
“Yeah.”
George seemed disappointed. “Very well, if you must be pedestrian about it.”
“But . . . why give Voldemort ammunition like that?”
"Take off your glasses."
“Right. But not a word about me, mind. Percy completely forgot that Malfoy almost killed me with that poison. Accidentally, but still.”
Strange. He had only meant to be polite to Hagrid; he hadn’t rehearsed an apology. But Hagrid deserved at least this much from him. Not that the man showed any reaction.
Potter—no, Harry—pushed away from him and sat up. There was an incredulous look on his face. "Is that the only time I've called you by your given name?"
"What makes you think it would be a mistake? You haven't even met Shira or her family."
Her face reddened. For a moment, at least, she looked honestly chagrined. “You’re right; you have made that clear. I’m not sure that Draco fully believes it, but—Harry, he is happy with you. That’s obvious. Or at least as happy as he knows how to be.”
Ron grabbed his arm again. “Keep moving, will you?”
Draco bit him again in response, sparking yet another wrestling match between them. Which ended in a win-win: Harry might have out-wrestled his boyfriend, but Draco seemed pretty happy to be pinned beneath him. Happy enough to kiss him soundly.
“Of course. I just wanted your fucking attention, Potter. And I never cared about getting Dobby’s attention, so I never treated him the way I treated you.”
The missive was short and to the point. Evansia Gross of the Daily Prophet had contacted Ron and Hermione for comment on the story that Draco was currently serving a life-debt to Harry. Ron and Hermione intended to show up at Grimmauld Place first thing in the morning to discuss the matter.
But Potter took the nuzzling in his stride. He even gave Draco a gentle scratch behind the ears as he scooped him up and, with Weasley’s assistance, struggled to his feet. Next he retrieved his glasses, sat down on a chair and deposited Draco in his lap.
“Your father’s not hiding dark artefacts in them, is he?”
“I just . . . there’s something I think we should discuss.” He tried to keep his voice gentle. “And not because I want to dredge up the past or anything. But you’re good with Kreacher and Toffee. Very good. So I’d like to know—”
Malfoy actually smiled. It was a genuine smile this time; nothing thin or sour about it. “My family is prejudiced against muggles and muggle-borns, Weasley—viciously so. But we’ve never been racists or antisemites. Don’t pin even more sins on us.”
Ron glanced at Malfoy with frank admiration—that bored drawl of his was an effective way to close an interview. Much better than saying ‘no comment.’
“No, I didn’t.” Malfoy stared at Ron, as if deciding how much information he was worthy of. “Partly because we’re friends and we get on well enough. But partly because she has a large family—almost as large as yours—and I wouldn’t have minded having all those, er, siblings-in-law.”
->*<-
Harry squeezed his hand. "Come on. I want to hear you say it out loud."
Fuck. Draco couldn’t tell. He might be an expert in occlumency, but he had no equivalent skill in legilimency. Would Harry actually haul him back there and force him to do grunt work?
“Don’t worry, Harry. I’ll still show you my memories of Dobby. Once you’ve earned back my trust, that is. So don’t pester me about my dreams.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "That's why you won't call it off yourself? You're afraid I won't want you after a few months?"
They had spent it dealing with Draco's parents, dealing with Robards, and dealing with the tossers who gave Draco hell for not registering as an animagus sooner. Never mind that he'd been undercover, with permission from both Robards and Shacklebolt to avoid the registry.
He looked grateful for the change of subject. Hermione had to suppress a sudden and ludicrous urge to giggle. That would be beneath her, but gratitude seemed so alien to him. He really must have changed.
They broke apart, finally—but, fuck, Potter's eyes were drinking Draco in.
“But I know that memory was about apparating.” Harry placed his hands on Draco’s knees. “And about landing somewhere you didn’t want to be.”
"Ron, relax. Just tell Draco to talk about muggle things. Draco's comfortable in the muggle world now."
Draco curled his lip. “But you managed to break into that memory regardless. Either you’re much better at legilimency than I ever imagined, or I’m losing my touch with occlumency.”
“Go on and let them in, Kreacher.” Harry threw off the blanket.
“No,” Malfoy admitted—and his smile was a bit sour again. “But my parents like to believe it.”
Of course, Hermione had no idea whether her words were true. They might well be, but it was just theory. Had some part of Draco always instinctively, and perhaps subconsciously, identified with ferrets? There simply wasn’t enough research on animagi out there.
Harry nodded. "Yeah. This isn't fair, Hermione, but he's right. Besides, my home at Grimmauld Place was probably acquired the same way. Maybe the Potter fortune too, back in the day."
"Yes." He hesitated. "Except that I want someone I trust from now on. Someone decent."
Draco disentangled his hands from Harry and slumped against the back of his chair. “Also true.”
“Does she? That's a bit Umbridge of her, isn't it?”
Draco turned back to Kreacher as he shut the door. “Where’s Toffee?”
“So, um—” Ron felt his face heat up. “Your father wouldn’t have cared that his grandchildren would be Jewish?”
He was sitting at a corner table with Hermione, Harry, and Malfoy in Coralia's—a posh new restaurant, dead in the centre of Diagon Alley, specialising in seafood. The owners claimed to have forged a trade agreement with the merfolk. No one believed that, but they still charged accordingly. Not that Ron was complaining, mind. His mouth was too busy watering for the sea bass on the menu.
Potter snorted. “It won’t, because they’re won’t be one. And why should it even be necessary? I know you want grandchildren, but there’s lots of ways for gay couples to—”
The two men shared a look that startled Harry. He hadn’t realised, until now, that this jealousy of him was something they had in common. And he had never imagined them bonding over it.
Well, they could think whatever they liked. He would marry Draco—even if it could only be unofficially, and even if everyone in the entire wizarding world objected. And he would be civil to Lucius and Narcissa.
Harry thought for a moment, and then smothered a grin. "Er, Ron?"
But Draco beat him to it; Harry’s mobile rang again.
“What about the rest of your family?”
“Of course not! Please stop accusing me of backsliding."
He owed him even more now. Weasley, he was certain, would keep the secret Draco had confided. More importantly, his reaction to it filled Draco with relief. Weasley hadn’t looked at him with disgust or even shock. And he wasn’t holding Draco at arm’s length. If anything, Weasley was simply more protective of him.
"Yes, they've done an excellent job of keeping all three of us out of the way this past week."
It had been a long day, though. Too long.
Draco made a dismissive noise.
She felt her own face heat up. “Then this is an even more important question. Is Harry pressuring you to sleep with him? Even unintentionally? I mean, you’re not just going along with what you think he wants—”
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Hermione was saying as she entered the room. Ron, meanwhile, was muttering something about the annoying clock.
"Merlin, that's true." Harry pushed himself up again and twisted a bit so he could see Draco. "Why haven't we?"
“How much does he get to know, you mean?”
It was an excellent kiss, in Harry's non-expert opinion, but when it ended Draco looked like he had something on his mind. Something foreboding.
“It did.” Harry looked her straight in the eyes. “I'll never hurt him, Hermione. I can't believe you think—”
Harry rolled his eyes. “After that.”
Hermione was almost to the top of the stairs now. And from the sound of her, she seemed to be chiding her companions.
Draco, meanwhile, was turning pink. "Must we spend so much time discussing my foreskin?"
“Wait!” That was a different voice. Suddenly Jamie, Shira’s significant other, popped into view. She was also a Victorian Goth, albeit a more cheerful-looking and far bustier one than Shira. Shira’s corset was almost just for show; Jamie’s actually had something ample to support.
Harry grinned as he crossed the room toward them. “Suspicious of your part-time therapy ferret?”
“Wasn't telling you anything, Malfoy. Just, you know, pointing out that you're still lying on top of me.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. "You think I'm that sadistic?"
“Don’t worry. I had my own difficulties with the man. Starting in sixth year, of course.” He sighed. “I assume the aurors taught you both occlumency and legilimency. And at some point you must have learned some sort of basic meditation.”
No, that wasn't fair. They wouldn't be upset about him being bisexual. Surprised, maybe, but not upset. But he would have to tell them that he and Malfoy were together. He would keep that secret from the press, but not from his closest friends.
“Potter here.” That was his standard greeting for fellow aurors.
“But he wouldn’t have done what my father did,” Draco cut in. “You’re father’s just a snob, not a supremacist.”
Draco swallowed. “Which are?”
“I don’t need to stay in New York for that.”
That was also true, but Draco really ought to have brought it up. His interest in Judaism—well, it showed a different side of him, didn’t it? One that Arthur wouldn’t have expected.
“You can walk out of here and apparate.  But don't. If you're serious about this”—Harry knew he didn't have to explain what 'this' was—“just stay put.”
But Hagrid had already turned back to Harry with something halfway between a laugh and a snort. “I saw the Prophet this morning. No need to drag your new servant everywhere, is there? Not that I can’t find a few chores for him. But enough talk! Come in, you three.”
“Of course he is,” Draco agreed. “But his hair, Granger! Sticking up at all ends . . . .”
Draco grimaced. “Those wretched elf heads.”
Draco pushed away from him. “None of that matters. You have no idea what a pariah I am.”
"Ah. Everyone was humming that. Even Ron's friends."
Harry blinked, remembering that the Dark Lord had forced Draco to torture people here. "Right. Was Voldemort ever here in this room?” For some reason Harry’s stomach clenched at the thought.
They were seated next to each other at the dining room table, with the scent of baking dough and fresh onions wafting up from the kitchen—some sort of onion bread must be on the menu for breakfast at Grimmauld Place.
Draco stared down at the chessboard. The pieces were all stilled at the moment, no longer attempting to lop off each other’s heads. And their injuries from this last game had magically healed.
“Don’t!” The last thing Draco wanted was Harry touching him when he was like this.
“Sorry.” But Harry wasn’t really repentant. It was too much fun to see the Malfoys so far on the wrong track.
Draco's eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Is this about me being a ferret? That's still not old for you?"
“Yeah.” George was stroking Draco’s head now. “And I’ll say this much for Malfoy: he is ridiculously pretty.”
Weasley was different now; he wouldn’t be as vulnerable to Draco’s lines of attack. And, in fairness, Draco wouldn’t bother attacking. Neither of them were fifteen anymore.
Potter stared at the screen. "But these are all muggle bank accounts and investments, aren't they?"
His tone was casual. Flippant, even. But his eyes were serious.
Moaning Myrtle was screaming about murder in the bathroom. And there was pain. A knife-like, cutting pain, though somehow Harry knew he wasn’t feeling the full force of it, that it was muted in the memory. And there was blood in the water as his body—no, Draco’s body, not now but in the past—shook uncontrollably.
“Right. Well, those memories also let me see the truth: that Dumbledore suspected I was the final horcrux all along. Or for a long while, anyway. He knew I would have to die. He knew that . . . that my lifespan was measured by the remaining horcruxes. That with each one I destroyed, I was shortening my own life.”
Harry was having a hard time parsing through Draco’s emotions now. He could feel them just fine, but he couldn’t name them. Draco seemed to be somewhere between stunned and contemplative as he tried to absorb everything Benjamin was telling him.
And yet, Snape had been able to cast a patronus.
There was a moment of silence, and then the sound of Ron climbing more steps. "He better not have woken Hermione."
Draco ignored that. “This house is in horrific condition. Here’s fair warning for you: I plan to borrow more house elves from the Manor periodically.”
"I want them to do more than tolerate you, Draco."
“Yeah,” George shivered as he stood up. “Scary place. We’ll get out of your way, then. Good luck in New York. And good luck with the Baumgartens.”
“I'll be happy to tour the house later,” he promised. “But for now, I need you to deliver a private message to Robards, the head of the aurors.”
When Harry finally finished, Draco didn’t say a word. Harry summoned the courage to look him in the face, only to find him gazing thoughtfully toward the pews.
“I didn’t stay relieved, you know? Because it didn’t help me personally. I still couldn’t work out how to . . . how to get out of murdering Dumbledore. Or how to work up the nerve if I couldn't get out of it. Or how long my family could possibly stay alive afterward, because the Dark Lord would always have more tasks for us . . .”
Kreacher, meanwhile, was standing in the centre of the room, extolling Draco's virtues. He paused only to answer Harry's question. "You are 'Master.' And as your chosen companion, young Mr. Malfoy is 'Master Draco.'"
“Wait!” Draco sputtered. "What . . . get off of me, you—”
“Um, okay,” he managed when Draco paused for breath.
“That you were, um, a bad boy—”
Draco breathed in deep as his fingers ghosted through Harry’s hair. They were lying on the bed, both naked, satiated and—in Harry’s case—looking thoroughly debauched. That wild hair of his produced the most beautiful bed-head look Draco had ever seen.
Harry laughed and kissed his hair again. “No. Not sure I’m all that kinky, really.”
“Kreacher and I packed a perfectly adequate suitcase for you with no charms—have you hung up your suits yet?”
A moment later Shira was in view, visible from her corset-cinched waist up to the tip of her elaborately coiffed hair. Draco had the pleasure of watching Harry’s mouth drop open as he took in a Victorian Goth in all her splendor. Shira might be too skinny by half and even paler than Draco, but she did have style.
Perhaps that explained why Hermione hadn't been shocked to find Harry and Draco tumbling headlong into a relationship.
“Yeah. It goes through the mother. And, anyway, I’d have had to convert to keep her family happy.”
He blushed even deeper this time. "I, uh, I don't know what to do next."
Draco caught his breath and glanced at his mother, hoping she had some trick to defuse this situation. But she just shook her head.
"Bloody-virtuous-Potter." Draco sighed again, but he couldn't stop himself from giving Harry a look of pure affection. "You're going to be the death of me."
Malfoy quirked an eyebrow at Harry, who nodded back.
Harry had to catch his breath. Fuck, even the thought of just that turned him on. "And if I win?"
“I’m not insulted. I'm just surprised that Draco . . . well, I'm glad he has a higher opinion of Ron now.”
“Oh, please.” Shira shook her head as she turned back to Harry. “It took me forever to get Jamie's permission for Draco and I to even consider an arranged marriage. She hates the whole pure-blood thing—”
“What about Bill and George? Oh, and Ginny?”
“What if I can’t move forward?” Draco’s stomach was still clenched. “I can’t—I don’t know how to make amends in my . . . society. And I’d only make things worse if I tried.”
Draco didn’t resist. And Harry didn’t call after them.
Harry felt a flutter of panic in his chest. “Given? Given to whom?!”
Draco shut him up with a quick, chaste kiss to the lips. "You can't be my friend when I'm relying on you to keep me in line. You don't order Granger or Weasley about, do you?"
Ron chuckled. "He's right, Harry. You should be asleep too, but let me talk with you first."
“It’s still not enough.”
“Of course it is.” Harry was obviously mocking him. In an affectionate way, but still.
Draco turned back to Harry. “I really do need to see McGonagall.”
Harry nodded. “Thanks to the flash drive Draco retrieved, yes. And we can link some members to the explosion. But now that Draco’s service is public knowledge, he’s a target for the remaining members at large, and for every other Death Eater wannabe.”
"So I guarantee a platonic night," Draco continued. "Unless your taste is peculiar and, ah, a bit alarming."
“You feel it?” Draco whispered. “The pain, the shock? I always thought you couldn’t feel pain once the shock took over. But, trust me, I felt every vicious slice . . . .”
Harry put his hands on Draco’s shoulders. He knew he couldn’t ask what sort of advice—that would be overstepping again. “Why Ron? I thought you’d be much more likely to ask Hermione.”
As the owl launched itself out the window, Draco felt his heartbeat return to a more manageable rate. “Let me get my wand; I’ll take care of your chest.”
“Yeah. And despite the fact that Shira is too.”
“I’m fine. And I’m not going to let anything make a meal out of you. I promise.”
"I'm not going to sleep with you over this."
Draco was staring at him now, his grey eyes half-pleading and half-challenging. "You ensure all that, Potter, and I'll do whatever you say."
“We’re here to keep Draco company whilst Harry’s in New York,” Hermione explained. “The aurors just sent him there as some sort of consultant.”
"Either would kill my father."
Draco stared. This was a part of the war that had never been satisfactorily dealt with in the histories published thus far: the exact nature of the connection between the Dark Lord and Harry.
“Are you done?”  Draco asked.
"No, I wouldn't. Fewer taxes on the wealthy, please. We're already disproportionately—"
“No,” Harry interrupted. “They can't take the train. Or apparate. Too much luggage, even with a variation on the extension charm."
“Why not? It’s true, Harry. I’m very much like him.”
“No, Harry. Shhh. Just let the memory come. It’s important. There’s something you need to understand.”
“I remember them from when I was a child.” He shivered. “They terrified me.”
Draco paused briefly at the threshold of the sanctuary and put his hand on some sort of decorative thing on the doorpost, as if he were in the habit of doing so and wasn’t really thinking about it. Then he put his hand to his mouth. Harry wasn’t sure if he should follow suit, so he just passed through.
“We're not together! You won't even shag me.”
The Baumgartens helped organise his departure, of course. Noa and Benjamin drove him to the airport—Newark again—with a standing invitation to return to their home whenever things were sorted.
“About Dobby,” Draco finished for him.
"I hope you're going somewhere good with this."
"I'm not lying, Harry."
Harry did stay put. Sort of. He attended both MACUSA and auror meetings in the Woolworth Building for one more day, but that was his limit. He spoke with the auror commissioner personally and explained his situation.
"Well . . .” Harry paused, furrowing his brow. “Draco is really good at sucking up—"
“Do you think that’s likely?”
“Stupid shit? I was a Death Eater, Potter!”
He knew what Draco looked like when he was genuinely amused—when there was no cruelty mixed in with his laughter. He knew what Draco looked like when he was . . . aroused. And when he was satiated afterward.
"Yeah, but he'll do it all wrong with my dad. If he plays up being a good, obedient servant—which, I admit, works brilliantly on you and me—my dad will think he's got, er, what does Hermione call it?"
“Um, you sure this is a good idea, mate?” Ron tried to keep his voice even. “I mean, what if Malfoy really wants to marry this Shira person?”
“Yes.” Kreacher paused to shudder. “But . . . it’s not fit for wizards. And Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley spend most of their free time here.”
“There are more important things to discuss now, little brother. Harry, let Malfoy go. We’ll behave, I promise.”
“Well, you’re not going to see it. Even if it would do any good, which it won’t—”
He gave Harry a brief, tight smile. “I’d like to go make an appointment with McGonagall, if that’s all right. I’ve a few questions for her regarding—well, you know. Animagus issues.”
“Huh.” Harry bit his lip. “I know I’m going to sound conceited, but I have to ask: Voldemort was obsessed with me. And you knew me better than anyone else on his side. I mean, not that you wanted to be on his side by the time he was living in Malfoy Manor, but—”
“Dunno.” Ron looked thoughtful now. “Something like misguided, but I need a stronger word.”
"No, but I know what it means." His eyes were glued to the mark. "And it's not that I don't care—believe me, I do. I hate that his mark is on you. But it doesn't make me want to break up with you. It . . . fuck, I just want to remind you that you're mine now."
Draco snorted. “I suppose I knew that much.”
Toffee nodded enthusiastically. “Toffee belonged to Master Draco before.”
“So why didn’t you tell me about Robards blackmailing you?” Harry felt his face heat up. “You came to tell me that you were leaving London. Why did you lie about the reason?”
Potter smiled up at him. "Yeah, there's some of that too."
“It was more about meditation. She told me once that if there were such a thing as a truly disciplined mind amongst muggles—a true master of mediation, I mean . . .”
Hermione folded her arms across her chest. "Yet the Malfoys despise muggles."
He could almost hear Draco frowning at that. "Yes and no. Remember, in America it was illegal to marry a muggle until fairly recently. There's a reason there are so many pure bloods over there."
Harry gaped at him.
"Yes. I'll explain later."
He didn’t rise to the bait. “What can I say? Potter’s preferable to the Dark Lord. And to Robards.”
Narcissa bit back a sigh. Of course Lucius’s first instinct was to antagonise the boy. “Why don’t we all sit down so you can tell us what this is about.” She was impressed by the evenness of her tone; really, she was quite good at keeping hostilities to a minimum. “Shall we summon an elf for refreshments?”
Draco snorted. “Harry Potter an innocent? Say it isn’t so.”
“Yes, you do! Besides, I have Ron, Granger, Shira, and Jamie. They’ve scarcely left my side.”
Not a bad picture, he decided. Not bad at all.
There was a shuffling sort of sound as the phone switched hands. Then Ron's voice came across, strong and clear. "All right, your pet has gone upstairs. Sorry, but I don't want to talk to him about this before I talk with you."
Draco didn’t say whether Mr. Baumgarten was prejudiced against wizard-muggle marriages, or Jewish-gentile marriages—so Harry assumed the answer was both. Well, as Draco mentioned earlier, at least Benj was Jewish. Presumably Mr. Baumgarten clung to that.
“We seem to have exhausted the verboten topic of politics,” Narcissa said at last. “Shall we move onto religion? Draco, I understand the Baumgartens’ youngest will be celebrating his bar mitzvah this coming autumn?”
"I was trying to use a torture curse on you, so I'm not counting that."
"Don't get your hopes up, Potter." He tried for a mock warning tone. "Not saying you're my type."
Draco blanched, somehow turning even paler than usual. “I was highly motivated.”
“Come on, stop stalling. You’ve told me this much.”
In truth, he was terrified. He didn’t know which would be worse: Draco telling him that what happened with Dumbledore at King’s Cross had simply been some sort of near-death experience, or Draco suddenly looking at him as if he were, well, some sort of holy walking miracle.
“Er, should I still be telling Master Draco—”
Ron nearly choked. “Your third?”
Draco nodded. “I’m also aware that . . . that, uh, I don’t even deserve your concern—”
"Yeah, sorry." Harry shook himself again. "I just, um, dunno. My brain went off track for a moment." Now was not the time to bring up patronuses. Harry would talk to Hermione later.
Harry leaned forward, letting all four legs of his chair rest properly on the floor. “Draco, you’re starting to scare me. What’s this about?”
“Nothing. Let’s find Granger and Weasley, shall we? Hopefully they’re not inside.” He nodded toward the Three Broomsticks. “Madame Roserta won’t want to see my face.”
"Good question. What do you want? To buy that ferret cage?"
"Yes, Harry." He couldn't keep the annoyance out of his voice. "Look, we just sort of fell into this. And we're only twenty. And you . . . you've got your pick of witches and wizards. Ones without this."
“I didn't. Use veritaserum on me if you think I'm lying.” He shrugged. “You're an auror. You should have access to it.”
“None,” Harry agreed. “But I suppose I could just forbid you to enter an arranged marriage to begin with—”
“Draco,” he said at last, “I’m not giving you a choice. You have a target on your back. I want you to know how to apparate and how to send a patronus for help.”
“No, she’s not fond of services. She’s not keen on anything religious, actually.”
“Yes.” She opened her eyes. “But I never want to see them, Harry.”
At length, Potter lowered his wand as well. And, to his credit, he had the grace to look abashed.
Benj nudged him with his elbow. “Just don’t wallow in it. Use the regret for fuel instead. Use it to move forward.”
That was, oddly, the exact right thing to say. Draco managed a grateful snort and mentally prepared himself to see his father.
But in Hagrid’s case it was egregious. A teacher wasn’t meant to be mates with his students. And he certainly wasn’t (for example) meant to show off a contraband baby dragon to them or allow them to help him cover up his possession of said contraband—which is what the Golden Trio must have done.
Draco didn’t say anything. He didn’t even react to the nestling. Or to the kiss.
They were at the Vue Cinema near King's Cross, figuring out what to see. Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco's choice. "Um,
So this must be New York. Bill Weasley had travelled here once, after the war, on Gringotts’ business. It was like London, he said, but much smaller, especially Manhattan itself. Boroughs like Brooklyn and Queens had a bit more space to them, but in Manhattan everyone was crammed against each other or piled on top of each other. And that somehow gave the city and everyone in it a jolt of energy. You felt it, Bill said, from your first breath.
