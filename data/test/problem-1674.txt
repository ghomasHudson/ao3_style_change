There’s a pause and then-- Potter’s face is very cold. Even his lips are cold where they press closed-mouth against Draco’s, though Draco suspects it’d be warm if he parted them. Draco’s not sure if he wants that. He already feels unsteady and he’s not the one hanging onto the outside of the castle three floors up.
“Cool? High praise from you, Malfoy. I always got the impression you thought I was a bit of an idiot.”
Potter gives her a look. “C’mon, ‘Mione. We need to save our pain relief potions. They’d be giving them to me anyway if I stayed.”
Draco, ironically, is momentarily lost for words when confronted with the full weight of Harry Potter, Girl Who Lived, on top of her, bathed in the soft glow. Potter won’t stop
Draco’s laugh gets stuck in his throat and he shakes his head, chin atop his folded arms. Potter won’t look at him; he can’t help looking at Potter. “You want to have an argument?”
Harry huffs a noise, not quite a laugh, and Draco chases it, kissing the tail-end of it out of his mouth. He’s going very slowly, maybe because stretching Harry out magically isn’t an option, maybe because he assumes it’s been a while (it has; Harry hasn’t let anyone touch him for a long, long time). Maybe he just likes it as much as Harry does.
He’s barely pressing down at all, but just the feel of his thumb against Harry’s pulse point is making it jump unsteadily. Harry breathes carefully, swallowing. Malfoy watches his throat bob under his hand.
Draco’s pretty sure Dolohov already knows, can probably see them from the window. He fights an urge to groan out loud in frustration. It’s not that he blames Potter for his skepticism, he knows the story sounds ridiculous, but he
The thing is, it isn’t really about the lobsters. Harry knows that. It isn’t even about Malfoy’s numerous other annoying food-related habits, like the smoothies he makes full of ingredients Harry’s never heard of, or how he lectures whoever’s around to listen about the benefits of spirulina and then ruins it by eating beans on toast three nights in a row. He does yoga and goes for runs and Harry once saw him eat jam straight from the jar with a spoon.
It’s usually busy in here, the huge, cavernous space filled with people shouting and casting and working on intricate bits of machinery, but for now, they’re alone. Everyone’s outside, ready for the lift-off Draco’s supposed to be out there orchestrating.
Draco’s head is starting to feel warm and muffled, like someone’s wrapped something around it. He uncurls a leg, pokes a foot into Potter’s shoulder, gentle. Potter rocks sideways anyway. “Why do you do that?”
Pansy looks over her shoulder and then back at Draco with an exasperated expression. “For gods’ sake Draco, will you just go talk to her for once?”
“That can be arranged,” Her voice comes out strangled but she thinks that’s fair enough considering the situation. She’s only human after all and this is Harry Potter, star of pretty much every fantasy Draco’s ever entertained and also apparently the kind of girl who, when confronted with Draco essentially offering herself up on a platter, decides that what would make her happiest is to get
They take Dolohov slightly off guard, Draco thinks, when they find him in the bedroom. It’s hard to tell because his face is twisted and ugly and he’s too smart for his own good, so he might have seen them on the street, heard them coming, but there’s a split second of surprise that Draco takes and runs with as far as he can.
She exhales loudly and pushes her hair out of her face where it’s getting in the way. “Give me another one,” she says, not quite a demand, not quite a request, but Potter does, adding another finger and curving her hand so her palm is pressed to Draco’s clit as she moves inside her.
Harry shoots her a look, wonders fleetingly if it was wizards who butchered Muggle idioms, or vice versa. “I’m not finding someone to sleep with just to piss Malfoy off.”
Harry does so, even though his stomach jumps weirdly at exposing the vulnerable back of his bare neck to Malfoy.
Potter shrugs easily. Draco watches him walk off in the direction of the lake until he disappears round the side of the castle.
Potter laughs and pushes a piece of hair out his face. “Sorry,” he grins. “There wasn’t really anyone around for months, and now you’re here. Guess you’re stuck dealing with me.”
“Oi,” Weasley calls from the end of the aisle. “One of you please come tell ‘Mione there’s no point having a Christmas dinner if we’re not getting pigs-in-blankets.”
It’s not logical, really. Potter’s already injured, so ending the time loop now won’t necessarily save him. But there’s still one thing Draco hasn’t tried, something so completely out of the ordinary that it might just work. And maybe it’s the head injury, or maybe he’s just getting really, stupidly desperate, but it might be worth a shot.
Draco had woken to an empty bed and a warm room where Potter had shut the window tight on his way out, but he’d barely had ten minutes to himself before there were rocks at his window.
It’s Christmas day, something Draco had almost forgotten until they’d brought round pathetic looking turkey slices just after noon. He’s quite glad they’re ready to leave, honestly. There’s something horribly depressing about the limp strands of tinsel strung up everywhere. The only thing worse than a hospital room is a hospital room trying not to look like one.
Never mind that they’re all basically adults, Draco thinks, or that they’re on the run, wanted by the government, supposed to be looking for pieces of psychopath soul to destroy so that they can end the bloody war. Never mind that he still has stitches in his scalp, that Potter can’t walk for more than two minutes without needing to stop and rest. Never mind all that when Potter is clearly cheating with some kind of stabilising charm on his reindeer that’s making it win every time.
“You told me to keep it safe.” She looks at him like it’s obvious. “When we were in the house. You’re the only one who’s been living this over and over, so I figured if you knew to warn me, that’s what must have happened the first time around.”
is, it means he’s tired. Tired of pretending that this whole Malfoy situation annoys him due to strictly noble reasons.
“I hadn’t thought about it.” Potter shifts. Draco wonders if he can feel how Draco’s eyes keep focussing on his mouth. “And I didn’t expect anyone until term started.”
“Yeah,” Potter says again, except he doesn’t sound like he’s joking, and his eyes have gone all sad and wide.
“Put it down,” Granger advises, only mostly succeeding in not outright laughing at him, and they all watch the penguin hobble lopsidedly over the tabletop until it comes to a stop.
“Happy New Year, Potter,” Draco says, and another round of fireworks goes off somewhere behind them.
,” Ginny says, diving and snatching the ball off of the ground. She left her good Quaffle at the Burrow and the weight of the football is throwing off her aim. If Harry wasn’t so distracted he might even have got a couple of shots past her. As it is, Malfoy’s shirt is off, so he’s losing by an embarrassing margin.
Draco slaps at his upper arm. “Did to, you arse. I only said what I said because you were too chicken-shit to say it yourself. Not because I stopped—”
“We do have at least one bottle of gin left,” Hermione’s saying, standing on tiptoe to inspect the top shelf. “But I think Luna tried to infuse it with Dirigible plums and I’m not sure it’s still drinkable.”
It’s cold with the window wide open. Draco doesn’t mind, he’s been wearing thick layers inside for months. Something about the freezing air feels sterilising and it was the only way he could think of to get rid of the dead, stagnant feeling at home. Here the air smells even cleaner than in Wiltshire, the bite of it at once familiar and shocking, and he stands there long enough that the temperature of his room, when he finally pulls his head back in, is barely discernible from the outside.
It’s borderline ridiculous how much warmer the flat feels with Draco in it, like it’s been missing something all the time he was away, even though he’s never actually lived there. He talks a mile a minute while Harry’s chopping and sautéing, sitting on the kitchen counter, his foot making contact with Harry’s thigh every now and then as he swings his legs.
His determined justifications do little to actually stop him feeling horribly guilty and he resolves to try and put the whole incident completely out of his mind, which turns out to be easier said than done when he comes downstairs to find almost everyone he knows (and a couple of people he doesn’t) bent over in workout gear in his sitting room, including Malfoy, who’s at the front and is wearing leggings.
“Not really? What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco can’t feel his toes and he’s not sure if it’s the temperature or if his shoes are pinching.
He’s dragged a chair over to the window and is curled up in it, staring over in what he assumes is the direction of the lake, though it’s near impossible to tell with moon hidden by clouds, when there’s a noise from below and Draco realises he's not the only one who's back early.
“Shut up.” She lobs a decorative pillow at him even though he’d said nothing. “You don’t even care when
“What?” he asks, feeling the bite as he presses his fingernails into his upper arms through his jumper. “So what, Potter?”
Draco’s friendly enough with Ron and Hermione to have been invited, but not close enough that he’ll take time off to fly back and attend. It’s an amicable, unspoken agreement between the three of them: Draco understood the sentiment behind the invitation, Ron and Hermione accepted the regrets he sent via return owl without surprise or offence. The whole thing’s very sensible and civilised, which only makes Harry feel worse about it. He wants to be selfish, to beg Draco to change his mind so that when he’s standing up there, watching his two best friends tie their lives to one another, he’ll have someone in the crowd to focus on, just in case the twinge of pain that’s been threatening to spark fierce and blue in his chest ever since he helped Ron choose an engagement ring starts to overwhelm him. Someone to dance with, to tell him that just because he’s best man for the bride
Draco might be starting to lose it a little bit. The other three stare at him as they’ve stared at him many,
Draco laughs again, like he really can’t believe what Harry’s saying. “What?!” he echoes back. “How are you remembering this so wrong?”
“Next exit, Granger.” He doesn’t even have to look to know where they are, just lays himself out over Potter, leaning rather more heavily than he intends to because his balance is all off. The faint feeling that usually takes him over in a couple of minutes is already there, pulling at the edges of his vision, and he knows it’s because he’s hurt. It only makes him panic more, not for himself, but for Potter, knowing that if he passes out first there’ll be no one to keep Potter awake.
The kids Harry teaches think it’s the coolest thing in the world that he’s friends with an astronaut. He can’t tell them much — it’s a Muggle primary and the department that Draco works for is technically a secret, even to the general wizarding population — but they don’t seem to care. They get so excited that he spends way longer than he should on their module about the solar system, letting them build little papier-mâché planets and tin-foil spaceships until the classroom’s covered in crepe paper and glitter.
All that time spent muffling his moans face-down into the pillow and his dick seems to have started associating the limit to his oxygen supply with coming his brains out.
“Mhm.” All these years spent watching Potter and Draco somehow never noticed his slightly crooked front tooth. It’s a minuscule thing, a tiny overlap, but Draco can’t look away.
He finds Ron in the kitchen (reassuringly dressed like a normal person and not like he’s just walked off the set of an eighties workout video) eating a bacon sandwich and frowning down at the sports pages of the
“Well well well,” Dolohov croaks, and Draco’s waiting for him to say something more, something equally as stupid and would-be villainous, like
Malfoy’s pupils dilate at the noise, something Harry has a split second to notice before he lunges. He gets his fingers straight into Harry’s hair, an echo of the way he touched Harry nights before, and his mouth is hot and sweet and

sake!” Draco yells, and shoots a Stunner at his own head, too impatient to wait for unconsciousness to take its sweet time in sending him back to the start again.
“If we end up with matching scars, Potter, I’ll off myself,” he says, even though no-one’s listening. Dolohov’s busy trying to slam Granger through the wall into the next room, which means his focus is off his shield charm enough for Draco to get a wobbly stunning spell around it and he crumples, toppling over the bannister and landing on the stairs with a sickening thud-crunch noise.
“Don’t know about that,” Draco says directly into Potter’s ear, feeling her squirm away as her breath hits Potter’s skin. “I barely had much time to
Pain spikes momentarily in Draco’s chest. He knows it’s probably a lie, that his mother, maybe, still cares about him, but it hurts all the same.
Granger seems to be thinking along the same lines because she turns around, wand raised. “I can’t believe we didn’t—” she starts, in a whisper. “
It came from behind them, Draco thinks. Back out on the landing, or in one of the other rooms. There was only one door still closed, presumably the other bedroom, but the idea of having to go and open it seems terrifying. They haven’t even done any of the cursory checks for traps or enchantments, save for Potter’s initial test of the front door, and it suddenly seems stupidly remiss of them.
“Seven months,” says Draco, like Harry needs reminding. “It’ll almost be Christmas by then, we can go to that winter pop-up in Hoxton that you like.”
“You’re— good at that,” Harry says, stilted, quiet, because the silence is making him want to do something stupid, like beg Malfoy to touch him literally everywhere else.
“You could have written and told me, you dramatic bastard.” Draco drops onto the bench opposite him, trying not to notice that Blaise is sitting in his usual position, leaving Draco to take the side of the table facing the rest of the room.
Potter wobbles, pushes himself up on his hands so that his elbows are locked, forearms straining, fingers gripping tight onto the ledge until his knuckles go pale. “I don’t think this is very stable.”
He allows himself one experiment, where he waits outside whilst the others go in. There’s no convincing
Draco flips her off, then sighs and sags back against the cupboard door. He’ll just have to let Potter be, and hope things will settle on their own. “Did Longbottom eat my last croissant?”
“Should we—” Weasley starts to say, hushed, prodding at some of the debris with one foot, but then there’s a noise from somewhere and Granger shushes him.
“That’s because you don’t know anything about wine.” Draco sips again in what he imagines is a refined manner. The metallic taste is less noticeable the more he drinks, and it’s warm if nothing else. “And they’ve thrown a load of spices in there and let it mull, so. Only a distinguished palette would be able to tell if the wine underneath was of decent quality.”
She waits for Potter to nod and leans down to kiss her again, just once, because she can, before she slides further down the bed. When she pops the button on Potter’s shorts, Potter pushes herself up onto her elbows to watch and helpfully lifts her hips up so Draco can slide them down her legs, throwing them somewhere behind her. Draco finally,
Draco’s chest fills with dread when he looks down to see Potter’s eyes are closed. “I’m trying to save your life here, Potter.”
Draco snorts at him. Why he thinks he needs to apologise for falling thirty feet, Draco has no idea.
Draco will never not be surprised that someone who cares so very little about sports got hired to be the main Quidditch correspondent for the Prophet. Although, Pansy’s complete lack of interest in the game doesn’t seem to have stopped her from getting exclusive interview after exclusive interview with half the players in the country, and several from around the world too. And Draco’s certainly not complaining — Pansy gets her free tickets to most games.
Draco doesn’t even want to know. Harry Potter: befriender of house-elves. Idiot who’ll risk pneumonia just to sit outside with Draco in the snow. Forgiver of boys who really don’t deserve forgiveness.
Potter pauses in the window, fixing Draco with an indecipherable look. Draco almost squirms. It’s the domesticity of it -- Draco’s embarrassed. He’s been at boarding school half his life, he and Potter even slept in the same bed that one, unmentioned time, and yet Potter seeing him curled up like this makes him feel vulnerable and weird. He’s very aware of his socked feet.
Draco starts to shove Pansy for that one but Pansy holds steady on her stool and shifts her weight so she’s propelling Draco in the other direction, saying, “Look, she’s on her own, go now, before the Gryffindors descend,” and Draco has no choice really but to stumble over there.
“So good, Potter,” she breathes. “You’re so good at this, make me feel so good, so full with your fingers inside me.” And Potter moans,
“Do you think we’re the first people to do this in space?” Harry asks a little while later, voice snagging at the end when Draco slips a wet finger into him. They’re using real lube, from a bottle stashed under Draco’s bed, because magic’s so temperamental up here that every spell is monitored and catalogued by the maintenance team. Not that Harry’s bothered about anyone figuring out what they’re up to, it’s just— strictly speaking, they’re only supposed to cast when it’s absolutely necessary and he doesn’t think this qualifies.
Draco laughs, soft, his breath misting the window for a split-second before it fades. “I’ve seen it a hundred times.”
Granger’s mouth thins. “You think You-Know-Who’s taking a night off, Ronald? You think they’re all having a nice, relaxing Christmas holiday? Have you learned nothing from the past twenty-four hours?”
Harry directs his castle forward and tries to ignore the odd number at the top table that keeps drawing his eyes like a magnet.
Draco looks down from where his eyes had unconsciously resumed their search for the lake in the darkness, his eyebrows raising.
Draco doesn’t get it, personally. He likes Quidditch, of course, and he isn’t above a bit of rough play, but it just seems excessive, the way the Muggles on the telly throw themselves on top of each other. The shorts are— an upshot, but still. Potter doesn’t even wear those tiny, tight ones when
They go on for ages, the noises bursting in the quiet night. Draco thinks about going to bed, thinks about opening the window properly and climbing down so he could try and see them, thinks about last year when he’d sat, miserable and terrified, in the Slytherin common room and wondered if he’d make it through another year.
His friends, at least, are a godsend. He’s not left alone with Draco for more than a second the whole afternoon and he thinks, not for the first time, that he’d be dead without Ron and Hermione, even if on this occasion he means less of a literal death and more of an overly-dramatic, symbolic one, in which his heart simply curls up and dies if he has to watch Draco smile at him like that one more time and not be able to do anything about it.
Potter huffs out a laugh, and sounds a little self-conscious when she continues, which should not make Draco’s chest feel all full and fluttery, but it does. “I mean, like, talk to me about it.”
Draco sits up properly where he’d been slumped sideways in the room’s only armchair. “Didn’t we have a conversation about Christmas being weeks ago?”
“I think,” Draco says, muffled because Potter’s leaned back in, impatient. He has to stop talking to give as good as he’s getting, push back into Potter’s space and bite gently at his bottom lip, but when he’s done, when Potter’s looking satisfyingly dazed, he carries on. “I think my actual words were something about making the best of the time we’ve got.”
Ginny, feeling her chest tighten weirdly, doesn’t turn around from her perusal of the Muggle newspapers. “It’s a load of rubbish, Lu. You know the Muggles can’t predict the future to save their own lives.”
As it turns out, being just friends with someone you only get to see a handful of times a year is exactly like being in love with them was, mostly, Harry suspects, because he still is. In love, that is, only now there are no more pixelated hybrid Floo/video-chat calls (he’d barely qualified for them as Draco’s boyfriend; ex-who’s-just-come-back-into-my-life-after-almost-two-years is not exactly an upgrade) and he feels guilty thinking about Draco when he’s getting off, on top of the general anger at the universe for keeping them apart that’s been there for so long it feels like a permanent fixture in Harry’s body. Nothing’s actually
“I know,” Potter mumbles, sleepy and indistinct. “S’nice. But it’d be nicer if you stopped yelling so I could sleep.”
Draco stretches and stands, decision made, places a gentle hand on Pansy’s head as he gets up. She’s fallen asleep but he has enough experience sharing a bed with her to know not to bother waking her up.
Draco stares at him for a long second, eyes searching. Harry’s not sure what he’s looking for — he feels like all the love he still has is written across his face, all that useless, obvious love that has nowhere to go and ok, Draco’ll have to give him some time, cut him some slack for now, he’ll get a hold on it eventually, he
“What about warming charms?” Granger asks, her eyes off the road as she meets his in the mirror, panicked in a way Draco’s already seen once.
His brain, sluggish but still awake, doesn’t feel quite ready to sleep yet but he figures might as well go up to bed. Potter and his ex-teammates aside, most of the people still awake are Hufflepuffs, and that’s too much to ask anyone to deal with in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Harry raises his eyebrows at the shifty look on her face — far from annoyed, it looks more like she doesn’t actually mind that much.
Granger only shrugs. Draco steals one of her pringles whilst he waits for Weasley to get the damned oven door closed.
Potter goes still. Draco’s body tenses too, against his will, as he realises what he’s said. He knows Potter feels it and he waits, unsure what to do.
There’s a dull thud and something that sound likes a quiet curse and then Potter’s there, of course, three floors below. Draco watches him come into view; he must have climbed out of his own window.
I’m going to—,” he pants, slipping a small amount further down Harry’s throat. Harry pulls his fingers out and shoves them back in, timing it with his slow pull back off Malfoy’s cock, and then speeds everything up, works his hands and his mouth together as Malfoy continues to babble above him. “Yes,
, and starts pushing his underwear down his hips. Between them they manage to get them off and over Harry’s shoulder somewhere, and then it’s skin on skin and Harry forgoes his hand and jumps straight in with his mouth.
What he doesn’t like, is the stupid sight correction charm. He can’t wear his glasses for games, for obvious reasons, unless he wants to replace them every week, so he sticks with the spell, even though it feels like someone’s digging their thumbs into his temples when practice goes on too long.
“This is fun,” Malfoy says happily, gulping more of his drink and smacking his lips. He smiles so easily when he’s drinking, it’s hard to look away from. (And also quite hard to look at directly, which means Harry has become closely acquainted with drunk-Malfoy’s right cheekbone, an area he’s deemed reasonably safe to stare at.) “I’m glad you let me move in, Potter.”
“Turn it up, for God’s sake,” she sighs, shooting an annoyed look at the ceiling. Seamus complies, thumbing the button until the sound of the TV is so loud it’s ringing in their ears. “Pair of bloody hypocrites.”
“You’re awake,” the nurse says, smiling at Draco. Draco nods, not trusting himself to actually say anything. He has no idea what Granger told these people about how he and Potter got hurt.
Potter ignores him. “You always were, now I think about it. Was never difficult to get you riled up.”
“No,” Potter says, voice flat. “I don’t,” and then gets up and leaves, using the actual door of Draco’s room for the first time all year.
“Brilliant,” Harry says, like she really thinks it is. “You can make me breakfast in the morning. Do you even know how to cook? I have a house-elf but I tend not to whip him out for morning-afters; he scares them off. And I still feel weird about him doing stuff for me without pay like— it’s just odd, I’m—”
And it’s nice, more than nice, the way Potter’s eyes flash at that, the teasing. It’s funny because Draco really used to think it
you could only go so long listening to me before—” but his sentence is cut off as Harry swallows him down again, and his voice breaks into a cracked moan. “
“Oh,” he says, when Harry screws his eyes shut and his hips buck needily upwards, teetering on the edge. He leans down and touches his mouth to Harry’s, Harry’s lips pressed too tightly together with the effort of not breathing to actually kiss back, and says “Ok,” just like that, simple and decisive, and Harry comes on a long, perfect exhale, back arching as Malfoy strokes him through it, limbs locking and then seeming to deflate, like all the air in his body has been expelled with that one breath.
“Hmm?” Harry hums around his cock, holds his fingers inside and watches Malfoy squirm at the vibration.
Look, he’s decided he can admit it. Malfoy’s fit. He has a very good body and a very nice face and he’s still very much an arse, but in less of an I-want-to-punch-his-nose-in kind of way and more in a please-God-yes-insult-me-again-with-that-mouth sort of way. Or something.
“Where are you going anyway?” Potter asks him. Draco looks at him in the mirror, watches as he sits up a bit, pokes a foot out of the water and stares at his toe.
“Potter,” she says, keeping her voice level with a bit of effort. “Fun night?” It’s a stupid question but she’s not going to do anything so crass as wish Potter a happy birthday and she can’t think of anything else to say. They don’t talk, normally, they just occasionally exchange smouldering eye contact whenever they happen to stumble across one another.
Ginny pinches him painfully in the side and he yelps. She fake-moans again, eyes dancing with mirth.
Draco shakes his head, wincing as it moves against the pillow. He’s never touched sheets with this low a thread count before, they’re like paper, and the head injury isn’t particularly comfortable either. “Don’t think so. I mean, can’t be sure, obviously. But I don’t usually get this far.” He hasn’t woken up somewhere other than that street for more days than he can count. If he ever sees the godforsaken place again it’ll be too soon. When all this is over, if Potter wants to move back to his bloody birth town, Draco’ll just have to put his foot down, he’s not living within ten miles of the place and oh, where did
“Anyway, that’s not the point.” She fixes Draco with her stern look again. “The point is you need to just get it over with. At least if it all goes tits up I’ll be dealing with mopey Draco rather than this mess; she’s much more fun and likely to engage in spontaneously bad ideas. You’re so boring when you’re too busy trying to seduce Potter from across a room to pay attention to me.”
“Look,” Malfoy breathes quietly into the space between them, when Harry makes no response and there’s a prolonged pause. “Word is, you’re a little jealous, Potter.”
Potter says nothing, glaring harder. He’s sunk down so far in the water that only his head is visible. Draco ignores him and starts washing his face.
It doesn’t feel like somewhere to run away to, the unforgiving emptiness he’d thought it was, an echo chamber for the frustrations he’d wanted to hurl fruitlessly at the universe. It feels like a gift, like the kind of escape that’s only good because you know you can go back home again, when you’re ready.
Right, the bag. It hadn’t exploded this time. Silver linings. Draco summons it out and pulls off the stopper, shooting Potter a grimace of apology — he knows the feeling of dittany on an open wound, it stings like an absolute bitch — but Potter’s saved the pain, Draco can’t get the bottle anywhere near him. It’s like there’s some kind of invisible barrier there, stopping anything that will help.
At two minutes to midnight, Draco watches the clock on his desk tick down and hopes his mother’s ok. Someone lets off fireworks somewhere when the two hands meet up, he can hear them echo, but they must be over in the direction of Hogsmeade because he can’t see anything out of his window except for the star-filled sky, even when he turns his bedroom light off and leans there, cheek against the cold glass, watching.
Draco doesn’t even know why Potter and her friends are here, she and Pansy come to this bar specifically because it’s usually packed out with most of the wizarding population of London under the age of 30. It’s the kind of place Potter avoids unless she wants to get mobbed. She must have made an exception for her birthday — and Draco cannot be blamed for knowing that, it’s been all over the press — and she watches as Potter starts making her way towards the bar. Draco shifts so she’s hidden from view by Pansy in a move that is clearly not as subtle as she thinks because Pansy snorts at her.
, he supposes. They don’t look like they’re going anywhere anytime soon, unless that somewhere is a large saucepan. Or whatever you’re supposed to cook lobsters in.
“Seriously, though,” Draco says, the alcohol and the heat of Potter’s gaze loosening her tongue. “It was a pretty cool manoeuvre,” and then immediately flushes pink.
They lie there for a moment, Harry feeling the urgent press of his cock against the fabric of his joggers — he hasn’t even got them off yet, and Malfoy’s shirt is still half on — but content, for now, to ignore it and keep running his fingers through the pale hair on Malfoy’s stomach. Malfoy sinks his hand into Harry’s hair in turn and scratches lightly with his fingernails so that Harry makes a small, involuntary sound, and Malfoy moves them, sits up and pushes Harry back into the bed, tugs his clothes out of the way and gets a hand around him.
The room is barely recognisable as the nursery it must have once been — it’s dark, even with the roof letting moonlight in, and there’s splintered wood on the floor that could be the remnants of a crib but it’s half buried in dead leaves, everything damp and coated in sixteen years of dirt. It hardly seems like the kind of place the Dark Lord would deem worthy of hiding a piece of his soul.
Harry doesn’t see Draco for a year and a half. If he comes back to England at any point, he doesn’t tell Harry about it, and the weeks pile up and up until Harry loses count and only knows that it’s the longest they’ve been apart since before Hogwarts. He can’t really comprehend it. Even when they hated each other, Draco had been
Comfortingly, the inside of Hogwarts looks the same as it always has, though it feels different, tired, like the stone walls can still feel the cracks that have been so expertly repaired. The grounds are different, in a way he can’t quite put his finger on. He hadn’t really spent that much time out in them before, preferring to stick to the common room or the Quidditch pitch except for when he had to leave for outdoor classes, so he’s struggling to remember what’s new and what he’s just never noticed.
VHS). They eat together in the dining hall that feels like being back at school, everyone jumbled together across long tables, and people are friendly, happy to indulge Harry, answer his questions and explain what they’re working on. He feels almost sick with pride anytime anyone tells him how great Draco is, how he’s the real genius around here, like Harry has anything to do with that. He’s pretty sure everyone assumes they’re still together, but neither of them corrects otherwise.
He can lie crossways on his bed at the Manor with his arms over his head and still have all his limbs on the bed. When he does that here his feet hang off the end, weightless. It makes him feel weird, like someone’s going to grab his ankle or like his foot might just drop right off with nothing supporting it.
“I’m Harry Potter,” Harry grumbles, backs off a bit, just enough that his face isn’t pressed to Draco’s collarbone anymore and he can look at him. “A few more minutes won’t kill them.”
It all goes very quiet then. This is new territory, unknown, a feeling Draco hasn’t experienced for— what, a month or something? Technically, when you add it all up? God, he hopes the fucker is dead. He
“Crackers,” she says when they’re all slumped in their chairs, tired in the warm, drowsy kind of way only a full stomach brings on.
Harry picks a fight on his last night because he can’t take it anymore. They never fight — on a day-to-day basis they don’t
Draco smiles at him. He doesn’t agree, but he lets himself hope it might be ok. It’s easier to believe with Potter right there.
He can’t decide if not being able to talk to Draco makes it easier or not. On his end, the horrible, tender feelings stubbornly refuse to die, so maybe it’s for the best. He’s not sure that he’d be able to remember why it was a good idea for them to break it off in the first place if he saw Draco’s face. At least after that disastrous Florida visit, the radio silence had felt necessary. Now he wants to talk to Draco because friends
“Guh,” Harry says, making Malfoy laugh hard enough that Harry’s still embarrassed about it an hour later, when they’ve said goodnight and are both in their respective beds.
Draco’s new bed is big -- not as huge as the one he has at home, but a good-sized double. The beds in the Slytherin dormitory had never felt too small, exactly, and they’d seemed to grow with the boys as they’d gotten older, but they’d definitely been built for one person. Probably some kind of deterrent, Draco assumes, not that it had ever stopped his dormmates.
Quite of its own accord, his hand has found its way into his trousers and he presses the heel of it against his cock to relieve some pressure. Next door, Malfoy’s moans have taken on a breathy quality and he’s going to come before Harry can bloody well decide what to do, the bastard. Something’s going to have to give, and soon. He can’t just keep secretly getting off to his roommate’s sex noises indefinitely.
about it, too happy to see each other again to be bitter. Or at least, that’s how he feels. Maybe that night hasn’t been weighing on Draco’s mind (heart,
He’s laid it on thick, but it’s surprisingly fun to needle Potter again, without the embarrassing desperation that used to underlie all of Draco’s mocking.
“I’m trying,” comes her harried response. “I think we’re near Swindon, I’m sure there’s a hospital..”
“Hi,” Potter says, voice weird. Or maybe Draco’s forgotten what it sounds like. “I saw you in the window.”
“How’s this for an order,” Potter says, nosing the back of Draco’s neck, “You should sit there and let me put my fingers in you like I asked.”
“I know,” he says, simply, and offers a hand to pull Harry up and into the craft, the two of them, for the first time, on the same side of the sleek metal walls that have been separating them over and over for years.
It happens again, over and over, repeat possibly ad infinitum, only Draco really fucking hopes not. The finer details change depending on how he plays it, but Potter on the wrong end of Dolohov’s wand is the one constant. Draco can’t figure out how to stop it.
Potter smiles, head tilted down. It’s an odd angle for Draco, staring up at the underside of Potter’s face from one side. “No, you’re probably right.”
He looks down. There’s movement: Potter, standing in the square of light that Draco’s window casts on the dark grass.
“Ok,” he says. “Friends,” and they shake hands like they’ve gone back in time and eleven-year-old Harry, standing in a train compartment on the first day of school, has been given the chance to make a different decision.
“I thought you said you were good, Draco?” Lovegood says, not unkindly. It’s very hard to be angry at her, even when she’s taking his money.
Besides, he should be grateful they even get this. He’s pretty sure it’s usually reserved for family members, but seeing as Draco’s not married and wouldn’t talk to his parents even if they were living next door, they must have made an exception.
“Let’s just get to a doctor,” Weasley says from the front. “It’s the next best thing, after Mungo’s.”
He hadn’t been able to stomach most of it, just venturing far enough to feel what had been ruined, to establish which of his childhood memories had been blackened beyond repair and what rooms he could go in now without feeling sick.
To his credit, he’s clearly trying to be quiet but it’s dark and he trips over Draco’s shoes on his way to the bed, catches himself heavily with one hand on the lump that is Draco’s hip under the duvet.
“Yeah,” he says, shrugging. “Not bad for someone that you abandoned on a beach and never spoke to again.”
He gets his pajamas on and sits on the end of his bed, not even pretending to himself that he’s not waiting. After five minutes Potter’s there at the window.
Draco makes himself stay calm, because no one’s saying anything, everyone locked in position, Dolohov looking like this is the best Christmas present he could have asked for.
He can’t imagine Potter in a club. He rather assumes he wants to avoid the wizarding ones for the same reasons Draco does, and the Muggle ones are hardly Potter’s scene. Most of them are, in Draco’s opinion, either boring or tacky, and Potter looks like he might be scared off by the kind of places Draco and his friends go to.
A hand waves in front of Draco’s face, long red nails almost taking her eye out. “Earth to Draco?” Pansy says, rolling her eyes as Draco’s gaze snaps to hers for a second before flitting back to Potter, who’s made it to the bar easily, people parting around her. She’s laughing, her hair loose, which is just— a lot to take in, Draco’s not used to seeing it. Potter had let it grow out since the end of school but it’s usually shoved back into a braid when she’s playing, not swinging over her shoulder like this, strands getting caught in her face as she chats to Granger, her elbows on the bar. Draco spares a single, longing thought for when Potter’s head had looked like a birds’ nest and she could at least use it as a distraction from the fact that the idiot has a stupidly fit face.
“You’re very-- flusterable,” Potter grins, pulling back but keeping Draco’s head bracketed in his hands.
“Fine.” Her tone is exactly the same as before: reluctant, annoyed that this is their only option. She jabs her wand. “Get in then.”
, Harry’s really missed hearing his name like that, posh and affectionate and disparaging all at once. “As I recall, you were the one who essentially backed me into a corner with both hands tied behind my back.
He can feel Potter’s eyes on the side of his face as he huffs a laugh. “I’ve had half a year to process.”
Anyway, the point being, Draco’s always been a stubborn bastard. Probably even more so back then, when he still felt like he had something to prove, and he wasn’t about to let a little thing like having to run inside every ten minutes to throw up in Harry’s bathroom stop him from finishing the year.
He’s outside in the snow again after a particularly nasty go-around where Dolohov had cursed a couple of his fingers off. He looks down at his hands now, checks all ten are still there and feels the others’ eyes on him, the golden trio shining real gold in the aureate light of the lamppost above them.
Harry doesn’t even think about it, just sucks in a breath and holds it there, chest full as Malfoy hums, this time in approval, and speeds up his hand.
and it taught Draco how to make those fancy little leaves on top of cups of coffee) and the occupants are all reasonably agreeable. The creepy old House-elf even likes Draco best. Potter’s still a bit weird around him, but it’d been decent enough of him to even let Draco move in, so Draco considers it a win.
neck?” Potter says, indignant, and then almost slips, maybe to make a point, because that seems like the kind of thing he would do, though Draco suspects it’s simply that his foothold’s not very secure.
Potter’s nose is still cold from outside when Draco tries to pull back and bumps his own against it.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry,” Draco cuts in and he suddenly sounds exhausted, all the fight gone out of him. “It’s either working or it’s not. This is hard enough when we’re both fully committed to making an effort, it’ll cease to
When Draco looks up he can just make out the way Potter’s cheeks have darkened. “I mean my room,” he clarifies unnecessarily. “I told them I didn’t need much but it’s nice, actually. I don’t like small spaces.”
Ron snorts. “Unless you want to be written out of her will, yeah, ‘Mione, I’d say we do.” He nudges a bishop forward to smash one of Harry’s pawns.
“I just mean--” Draco huffs, pausing to pull his sleeves down over his hands. “It’s December. I’ll catch some awful cold if I spend another night hanging out of my window and it’ll be entirely your fault.”
Almost definitely. And Malfoy’s too. And the sound of their mouths colliding, if, you know, Harry were to hazard a guess.
He’s quite fit really, Dean, Draco notes distractedly as Lovegood shuffles and re-deals. Not that Draco would ever go there, unless he wants to hear what a castration hex sounds like in a strong Irish accent, but still. He can
“Not because he feels sorry for you,” adds Lovegood, somehow knowing that’s where Draco’s thoughts were headed. “He doesn’t mind you living here.”
When he finally heads inside to sleep, he finds his bedroom ceiling lit up, covered all over in glow-in-the-dark stars. If he cries a little bit, thinking about Draco standing on the bed, casting the same sticking charm over and over, he decides that’s ok. There’s no one there to see him.
“No, I mean-- well, they take them places. Trips away from school. Or at least make them run around outside for a couple of hours a week.”
you we should have waited and brewed more, this is completely ridiculous, not to mention dangerous and—”
Draco doesn’t say anything, just stares at him. He looks better than the last time Draco saw him, not that that’s especially surprising. His hair’s shorter, still a mess, but not the tangled length it had been during the war.
With the filters in his head washed away by inadvisable amounts of gin, he can acknowledge that it pisses him off being able to hear Malfoy, not because it makes him uncomfortable, but because it makes him want to go next door and shut him up. Kick out whoever else is in there, whoever it is that gets to pull sounds like that out of him, or, if he’s alone, tell him he needn’t be when Harry is right there and willing. Smother the noises with his mouth, swallow them down. Hear them breathed into his ear, up close rather than muffled through solid plaster.
meant anything by it. He knows Ginny is touchy about the whole thing considering her relatively recent realisation that she wanted to stop dating men altogether, but he isn’t fine watching her bring home other girls because he thinks they’re somehow less of a
“Better?” he asks. Five minutes might have passed, or five years, Harry’s endorphin-stupid brain doesn’t know or care.
Harry stares out of the window above the bed, head tilted all the way back into the pillow as Draco gets another finger in. The glass is charmed like at the Ministry back home, with a little side panel of options for different views — mountains, forests, fields (“Because they’re genuinely scared we’ll go barmy, cooped up here, if we forget what a tree looks like,” Draco had explained) — but right now the spell’s inactive and all Harry can see are stars.
“It’s nice to have privacy, though, I guess. And McGonagall said we’ll still be allowed in our House common rooms, once everyone’s back. I wonder what they’re doing about classes. Reckon we’ll be in with the year below?”
This time, she manages to throw the ball at just the angle to knock his glasses right off of his face.
Draco doesn’t know what to do when Potter tells him things like that. He didn’t ask, Potter just offers up piece of himself like Draco will know how to hold them in his head without going crazy.
“What d’you think did it?” says Potter, and Draco turns to face him again, look at him properly, catalogue the damage. Whoever invented that spell obviously hadn’t thought to consider Muggle methods of healing — probably Dolohov himself, the racist bastard — but it’s a good thing, because Potter’s wound is all clean and hidden away under sterile white bandages. He doesn’t have a shirt on but he looks warm, tucked under a couple of blankets. Tired, but ok. Draco exhales.
Harry quickly made his way over to Blaise and buried his head in his shoulder once he was there. “I’m so sorry Blaise. It doesn’t matter what condition I’m in, that was uncalled for. I know you only care for my safety and well-being, it’s just so hard sometimes. I’m sorry. You’ve done so much to help me and I just keep throwing it back in your face. I really do appreciate everything Blaise, you know that right? I’ll stay inside, I promise. I won’t go out anymore unless you’re with me. I’m so sorry to keep worrying you.” He stepped back a little to reveal a tear-strained face.
“Now you listen to me, Harry, just listen,” Mrs. Zabini began. “I don’t understand any of your minds. I’m not sure I would have done the same thing for a friend as Blaise has done for you. I don’t think I would have handled the situation the same as Draco Malfoy did. And I don’t know if I could live the way you are Harry, pretending everything’s okay when it’s not. However, I cannot control any of your lives or decisions. I will keep this under my hat if that’s what you wish for me to do. The rest is up to you two. I will continue to be the doting mother-in-law who is ecstatic about having her first grandbaby. Not everything is as it seems; that’s one of the first things you learn in a pureblood household. This is no exception. Now, what have you decided to name the baby?”
Blaise left, giving the Frisbee back to the group. “Sorry guys, I have business to attend to.” He laughed when they began teasing him and went off to get Harry and Theresa. “Harry! Harry come here. I want you to meet someone. You too Theresa. Bring McKay. In fact, give McKay to Theresa.” He helped gather their things together and then took everything from Harry so he wasn’t carrying anything. “Just past where I was playing Frisbee. I want you to meet this guy.” They walked over to the house and up the steps. As they were walking in, Blaise said, “Harry, I’d like you to meet the biggest idiot on the face of the planet.”
“Harry, I am offering this. You’re not asking for me to do it. I want to. You are my friend. And Draco, dumbass that he is being right now, is too. I would do anything for either of you. And I want to do this. Please, let me help. I can at least learn how to act when I do meet that someone, yeah? And it will give you time as well. There’s only one thing I ask from you concerning this child.”
“Harry, Harry calm down!” Mrs. Zabini insisted, rising to her feet to stand before Harry. “It’s not good for the baby to be this stressed out. Calm down now. Take some deep breaths. You’re okay, just come sit down and talk to me. I will say that I am unhappy about being left in the dark about something this important, but I do see why I was. Now then, come and talk to me about what’s going on. There must be more to this story.”
But he also had to make him see sense. This was also Potter’s child, meaning the press was part of the package deal.
Shortly after falling asleep, Snape returned from dinner in the Great Hall. “Two! Two cauldrons in the same class! Not even a first-year class, but a
Harry looked down at his naked husband and saw a small piece of blue ribbon… tied in a pretty bow around the base of an erect cock. He almost stopped breathing.
He watched as the Gryffindor made a few quick motions to Draco. “Crucius Curse? The potion is the Crucius Curse? No, not the curse. The cure? Okay, not quite. Then it… soothes the aftershocks? Oh! It helps people who have been held under Crucio? Oh, Severus! Are you okay?!”
They were all quiet for a moment before Dr. Mitchsens spoke up. “I believe that a doctor who knows about male pregnancies would be best, of course. You and your husband will need the best of care and state-of-the-art of everything. I, personally, would tell the both of you everything straight up: care, warnings, news for the better or worse. I would not keep anything out, despite how small I think it is. If at all possible, I would cater to your every whim when it comes to your husband’s care,” he concluded.
“That’ll have to wait, professor,” Harry snarled, pushing the man out of the way as he advanced on the Dark Lord. “I am really sick and tired of you trying to kill me. It gets old after a while, ya know? You couldn’t beat me as a baby, you couldn’t beat me as a teenager, you won’t be able to kill me as an adult. I wasn’t even fully trained those first times you came against me! I’m still not! And yet, you never win. I have to kill you now because you’re an annoying thorn in my side. And because you threatened Draco. You see, I can’t have that happening. So while I
Harry weakly waved a hand at them then looked at Dr. Rhodes. “Thank you. Thank you for not taking the ham.” He took another three pieces and left the room quietly. After a moment, he called out, “Dr. Whittier, may I speak with you please?” Dr. Whittier looked at Blaise and then went in search of the young, pregnant wizard. When she found him, he sat in front of him as motioned. “Do you know who I am?”
Narcissa Malfoy – the doting mother, the worrier, the planner. It was obvious where Draco got his nesting skills from. Harry and Lucius shared many looks of sympathy during this phase of the pregnancy.
“I love you too, Harry,” Draco whispered before finally falling asleep. The day really had taken most of his energy, just realizing he was completely safe and then telling part of their tale again. It had been so long since he’d had anyone besides Harry to talk to. He loved Harry, but people were a necessity. He was sure that had they stayed out there any longer… He let that thought fall as even his subconscious fell asleep.
“It was all Mal- Draco's idea, mate,” Ron said, hugging his friend in a “manly”, one-armed hug. “He wanted to do something that would make you remember this birthday. You remember your eleventh birthday because you found out you were a wizard and had your first real gifts. You remember your seventeenth birthday because you were legally allowed to use magic outside of school whenever you wanted. You'll remember your twenty-first birthday because no one else remembered it, supposedly.” Ron gave a grin as he explained things.
“As a friend, or a brother maybe. Well, of course as a friend. And I do kind of see him as a brother, which is weird because we’re married. But not as a lover or a boyfriend or anything more. No. Not at all.” Harry’s eyes apologized to Blaise, but Blaise’s just smiled in understanding.
There seems to be even more blood than usual once they’re situated in the back seat. Draco’s starting to get used to the smell of it, thick and metallic, but it’s still not
Harry sees the moon, up close. They’re on a detour, Draco says, because of some unexpected asteroid debris that they need to avoid, and it means they might have to delay a couple more days until they can circle back around to Earth. Harry’s not complaining.
Instead, Harry sucks it up and loses at chess, lets Hermione seat him next to Ginny and Luna for the wedding breakfast.
He doesn’t say anything, just slots their mouths together like it’s the last piece of a puzzle he’s trying to finish, here: shoulders align, here: lips. Draco presses his fingernails into his palms to stop himself making an embarrassing noise and pretends the lingering taste of hospital gravy on Potter’s tongue is unappealing, for the sake of his sanity.
the same and Dolohov won’t be there, to realise he could have stopped this happening if he’d thought about it properly. And then it’s too late and they’re trapped again, Dolohov leering from the doorway.
“It worked,” he breathes to the ceiling, feeling Potter’s eyes on the side of his face. God knows where Weasley and Granger are — finding food hopefully, Draco’s fucking starving — but he’s glad they’re not there to see the look on his face. It’s probably embarrassing.
“Yeah, that is weird,” Weasley agrees. He has the wretched thing in his hand, swinging the pendant in front of his eyes. “How it’s here, whole, but there’s still that piece.”
of anyone suffering from a time-related injury like this before. And the fact that the fragment stayed lodged in you even when you managed to avoid the bag getting hit in all the timelines after..”
should step it up if you want him to hear you through these walls.” His smile widens when Draco, unable to help it, lets out an embarrassingly loud whine and tries not to writhe on the bed.
“Mhm,” he says, noncommittal, belated. It’s a little overwhelming seeing Potter up close, something he hadn’t expected. They haven’t spoken without several metres of distance between them since Draco’s trial back in May, and his eyes catch on small details of Potter’s face: the way his glasses have pressed into the bridge of his nose, how surprisingly long his eyelashes are. Draco makes himself look away.
Draco’s not entirely sure what PE is. His warming charm has flickered out again and the January wind is biting. It’s a lot less green up here than he’d been expecting, the hills stretching brown and grey in every direction.
Potter’s hand twitches against his thigh, like he was going to reach out and thought better of it. “I had help. People to talk to.”
gets her hands on those thighs, fingers squeezing the muscle and running over smooth, brown skin, feeling the hair as she runs her palms up towards where Potter’s legs meet her hips.
“Honestly, I’d quite like to get my fingers in you.” She says it matter-of-factly and Draco almost loses her balance and collapses on top of her.
“But I think I get it a little better now.” Potter rubs at his nose. “They’re just kids, really. Not their fault what they were born into or what-- what’s expected of them.”
Draco, aware that they’re losing precious seconds the longer they stand there deliberating, cuts in. “Granger, enough. We can’t apparate with him, he’s half-dead.”
“Yeah, but they’re girls,” Harry says, propping the stolen cushion behind his head. “And you’re you.”
Draco looks at him, and his eyes are hot, unyielding steel. “What do you want me to say, Harry? I’m not going to quit for you.”
Granger casts several spells that don’t work, then tries something that makes Potter’s skin glow a cool blue colour, shaking her head. “It’s part of the curse. I think it’s blocking any healing spells.”
This time, it’s easier to get his bearings. He’s expecting the feeling of packed snow beneath his feet, the concerned looks from the others once he opens his eyes.
Harry shakes his head quickly, nose almost brushing against Malfoy’s. “M’not jealous,” he says, matching Malfoy’s low volume. “Just think you’re being a bit loud. Bad housemate etiquette, s’what it is.”
Draco was hoping it was his father and Snape and Pomfrey behind the door, but it still didn’t prepare him for what he was seeing: his father lay chained to the bed by magic, his entire upper body bare to the air and medical personnel around him. It was strange to see his father so vulnerable, to see him in so much pain. And that’s when he realized the source of the pain was the Dark Mark on his left forearm. Voldemort was torturing him through it! And by the look on Severus’ face, he was feeling the same thing.
“You know,” Blaise began after one such incident, “I think I’m going to floo-call my parents and tell the we’d like to keep this house as our own. What do you think Theresa?”
Hermione and Ron appeared in the infirmary just then, faces red from having run from the lake outside where they’d been walking during a free period. Long ago, Harry had charmed medallions for his friends and himself to let each know if the other were in danger. Over the last several months, their charms for Harry had flared a few times. It was the only thing that gave them hope that he was still alive. But this was no flare. It was a pulsing heat that nearly burned their necks where the charms lay.
is Voldemort. Or was rather. Potter has just killed him. And several Death Eaters I do believe. Now would be a good time to go warn Pomfrey that Potter will, once more, be a resident of hers. For quite some time I do believe.” Slowly, Snape gathered Harry in his arms and carried him outside the wards before apparating to Hogsmeade where he used
“I will have you know, Granger, that I was completely heterosexual before the whole Forest issue came about.” He looked over at Harry who was making hard and fast gestures of his own. “As was Harry, apparently.”
Deciding to see if Draco had left a note, Harry went to their bedroom. He hung his Auror robes on his side of one of the closets and then took a look around. On the pillows, on the bedside tables, in the bathroom, on the vanity, on the mirror, on the dressing table.
Snape sat through it all, not happily of course. But he wanted Draco close by and Harry came with that. When Harry was satisfied that he knew the rooms from top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, three dimensionally, upside down, and every other way, he nodded once to Snape, then stood behind Draco who was on the couch. Draco laughed and tilted his head up for a kiss. Harry obliged and put his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Thank you, love. Are you satisfied that Severus isn’t going to hurt, maim, or kill me now?” His answer was a small glare, but Draco knew. “I’m sorry Severus, but you must understand. Five months in the Forbidden Forest. Just think about that, and surely you can understand?”
As they Apparated and then walked home, things were quiet and still. Draco opened the front door and let Harry walk in first to get the full detail at first glance.
“But, why couldn’t we see either of you? Why did you suddenly disappear, or become silent or whatever?” she asked.
“Get back here Draco!” Blaise called, following the blonde. “That’s not my baby, it’s yours! That’s your son, Draco!” Draco froze and turned to face Blaise with a pale face. “Yeah. Weren’t expecting that one were you? The day that you were going to propose, Harry told me he was pregnant and I hugged him in
A bright light flashed around them, showing all in attendance that the union was accepted by the Powers That Be. A quick tie with a length of white silk around Harry and Draco’s left wrists, and the wedding was complete. Draco smiled and leaned over to kiss his husband. “We did it Harry,” he whispered. “Now no one can separate us. Ever.” The silk dissolved into their skin as if by… Well, it was by magic. He hugged Harry as tight as he could and felt it returned in kind.
Draco’s next words were cut off as his stomach rolled and he rushed to the loo. He threw up everything he’d eaten that day, then continued dry heaving. Harry was at his side, rubbing his back and holding his hair. He even sent magic through their bond to comfort his husband since he couldn’t talk. Eventually, Draco sat back, breathing heavily. A quick cleansing charm and the taste of sick was gone.
“Yeah, I know. It’s my job to figure it out. Isn’t it always?” Severus dismissed the younger man and went back to his coffee. “Bloody Gryffindors.”
That being said, she went back to her patient. While Dumbledore waited for Lucius to regain complete consciousness, Snape grew louder and more urgent. At last, Lucius opened his eyes.
Blaise moved a bit closer and reached a hand out to rub Harry’s stomach, hoping to soothe McKay into going back to sleep. It wasn’t the first time he’d done this. However, Harry always had the same reaction. When he first touched the bulging stomach, Harry jumped then relaxed after a few moments. “Harry? You’re stomach is hard.”
"So what you have here is a 10 week old, male, Blue Merle Australian Shepard. I suspect he was abandoned by his mother as he was the runt because he is quite a bit smaller than what he should be at 10 weeks. He seems relatively healthy, just a bit underweight so what I'll do is keep him here so he can warm up and give him a bowl of food."
"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine." That was a lie. Draco was anything but fine. Draco muttered Hermione and Ron's address. "Can you get there as quickly as possible please."
It was about ten minutes before Draco's name was called. He and Hermione followed a police officer into a small room.
"Your mum, dad, Sirius and Remus, right?" Draco asked. Their eyes narrowed for a moment before they quickly stuck their hand out and held it to Harry's neck, catching the snitch tattoo. "Found it."
It was a rule now that the 8th years were allowed to go out when they wanted as long as they didn't have a class but they had to ask McGonagall first. Harry and Draco walked to McGonagall's office and knocked. There was no answer so they knocked again. Draco slowly pushed open the door but she wasn't in there. Draco and Harry next checked in the Hospital Wing because Madame Pomfery and McGonagall were good friends and could often be found together. Harry knocked on Madame Pomfery's office door.
Harry was about to walk off to find Draco when he felt someone grab his arm. He turned and saw Seamus who was tugging him over to a quieter place in the hall. Harry looked down at Seamus in confusion.

"The ones up until 2011 are a little boring. They're okay but not the best but after 2011, they really start to pull on your heartstrings. If you don't cry at at least one of these adverts, I will deem you as having no heart."
Draco watched Harry expectantly and laughed to themselves when Harry met their gaze and shook his head.
Draco licked his bottom lip before drying it with his thumb. He leant forward and ran over his bottom lip with the lipstick, leaving a rich red colour drying on his lips. He kept going over until his lips matched the colour in the tube. The lipstick felt soft and velvety against his lips, gliding over them with ease. He took just as much care with the top lip, not wanting to make any mistakes. He cleaned up the edges of his lips with tissues until it was perfect.
"Good. He's right to be terrified of us. That waste of space couldn't escape us even if he tried. That boy deserves every punishment." Vernon said.
Draco was struggling to comprehend the words that were flying out of these three monsters mouths. They didn't care about what they did. They didn't care that they broke a human being. They didn't care that they destroyed Harry's life.
All of it began to pile up over time. The self-hatred, the self-doubt, the insecurities, the previous emotional abuse from their father and one day, Draco couldn't hold it back anymore. The afternoon during his seventh year when it all came out was something that Draco had mixed emotions upon, but what mattered is that Draco finished the day feeling so much better about themselves.
"Mr. Potter, you and Mr. Malfoy are still to ill to go back to lessons. You will not be going back until I say so. And that is final." Madame Pomfery told them in a stern voice. With that, she walked out of the room.
A snowflake falling gently caught Harry's eye. He looked up to see thousands of snowflakes twirling down from the sky. Harry smiled softly.
Surely Seamus didn't kidnap Harry. They had been friends since they were eleven and Seamus had always been by Harry's side. They had always been such good friends.
"I know you don't want to hear this but this conversation needs to happen sooner rather than later. Mr. Potter is showing no signs of improvement, he is getting worse everyday. The rest of the healers working with Mr. Potter and I have had a lengthy conversation and we think it would be best if Mr. Potter is taken off life support in the new year if he still shows no improvement. Of course the decision would be up to you but this is what we think would be best moving forward." Healer Rhodes said.
Harry hadn't realised how long he had been thinking about Draco until a loud banging noise came from the opposite side of the door. Harry jumped and scowled at the noise for ruining his peace.
A chorus of agreement came from the others and Harry felt a small lump begin to rise in his throat. He was just so thankful to have such supportive friends.
Kingsley Shacklebolt had called a meeting. Draco pretended that he didn't know what it was for, maybe they had a new lead, but deep down, Draco did know why the meeting was being held. He pushed it away to the corners of his mind because it made Draco feel slightly better pretending to know what the meeting was about.
"Okay, thank you so much." Draco picked up Bud who was starting to fall asleep and wrapped him up in his scarf again.
There was a certain atmosphere to this place and Draco couldn't quite describe it. Draco could feel the magic in the air, that's for sure but there was something eerie and uneasy that hung in the air. Draco forced himself to walk faster, there was something unnerving about this place. Draco wondered if it was because of what happened in 1981, the attack of the Potters and 1899, the three way duel between Albus Dumbledore, Aberforth Dumbledore and Gellert Grindlewald. Draco wondered if the residents were scared of something like that happening again, scared of their house ending up like the Potter's.
Harry leant forward and lifted the legs of Draco's trousers up and there were the things Harry wanted to see. Draco was wearing some light blue socks with penguins wearing Christmas hats on them.
He took one final glance at the photo before he went to put it away, but then all of a sudden, Draco heard it.
"Could you possibly get a Christmas tree to go in the 8th year common room because Draco and I are decorating it?"
Draco had been pining over this dress for months but they could never seem to get their hands on it but now they finally had it... it felt like magic. It was so much more beautiful than Draco could've ever imagined.
"Okay. Could I just take a name and an officer will call you to have a chat." The receptionist said.
Draco parked their car and headed towards one of their favourite shops. They wondered what they would do if they happened to bump into Harry, not that it was going to happen but a person could dream. Should they apologise for kissing him on the cheek? No, you shouldn't apologise for something you're not sorry for. Get his number. That's what Draco should do. Get Harry's number.
"Oh Harry." Draco whispered to himself. "Merlin, I miss you so much. I didn't think it was possible to love someone so much but, you came along. I wish you were here with me. It's hard being back here. I try to cover it up from mother as best as I can because I need to be strong for her. But right now, I'm finding it hard to be strong for myself. I just want you to hold me and tell me everything's alright. You should be here Harry, we should be sharing our first Christmas together. I love you, Harry. So fucking much. Merry Christmas, my love."
"Uh, Harry. Can I talk to you for a moment?" Draco asked as he jogged to catch up with the trio after DADA.
"I second that." Blaise said. "I mean, how fucked up do you have to be to kidnap an innocent human being."
The environment was comfortable and friendly. Everyone was talking, eating and just having a good time. Harry shut his eyes and let himself bask in the warm sunlight and soft grass. It was so peaceful here and Harry knew that this was a memory he would take and store forever.
It took Harry around half an hour to get into town on the bus. In this time, he was thinking about the type of Christmas jumper he wanted to get Draco. It needed to be predominantly black, otherwise it was out of the question. Harry wouldn't return without a Christmas jumper because Draco would win and he didn't want that. As he stepped off the bus, Harry checked his watch and did some quick mental maths. He had two hours to find Draco a Christmas jumper. If Harry was buying a jumper for anyone else, two hours would be too much time, but when shopping for Draco, two hours wasn't enough time. Harry made a list of all the shops he should visit: Jack Wills, Superdry, John Lewis, H&M and Abercrombie and Fitch.
“I do. Which do you like Blaise? Despite what you keep saying, you’ll have to deal with them as well.”
“Has the child arrived?” Snape asked, quickly closing the door behind him. “Obviously not.” He crossed his arms and stood in the corner, waiting.
“Don’t be stupid Ron,” Hermione said. “Malfoy’s in the hospital wing right now recovering from the attack in the Forbidden Forest during that same detention. They said the only reason he’s still alive is because Harry was there to help him. Now then, if Harry wasn’t there then how did Malfoy survive? I agree though, this should have been spaced out more. It sure is nice not having Malfoy about to torture us though, don’t you think?”
. He didn’t bother with anyone else in the battle; he left that to his fellow Order members and allies.
So I was going to make this a short story, kinda like my other two. However, I don’t think I can make too much of it. So, yeah. It’s a one-shot now. Yeah. That works for me. If you don’t like it, stop reading. Or don’t read at all. Or continue reading, complain about it, send me flames. My response will be: all flames are put in a jar and will be used when I take over the world. Because I will one day. I just have to learn who all I want to keep around. *crickets* I mean… *clears throat*
“A quick question for Harry,” Poppy said at the same time. “Does Draco know about what we were talking about before you woke him?”
Draco looked at Severus and mimed drinking to ask for some water. They should have had some ready, knowing he’d be doing all the talking. Immediately, Severus provided a glass. It gave Dimitri and Luna time to write.
This caused a blush to rise on the matron’s cheeks. “I didn’t mean the mechanics of it, Harry. I meant… When the two of you were last seen, you were heading to a detention in the Forest. You hated each other. You were rivals. You had gotten in trouble for fighting in class which was why you were serving detention in the first place! And then you come back, won’t leave Draco, won’t stop touching him, and he’s pregnant with your child. How did that happen?”
“Yes. After saving my life, Harry was stuck in the nundu’s poisonous cloud. When it and the nundu cleared away, Harry was left blind and mute. That is why we learned to speak to each other, or rather him to me, in a gesture-based language. As for his vision, he uses his magic to see. It’s a sort of sonar or echo-location.”
Draco came and went throughout the two months, and they shopped together in Diagon Alley for their seventh year school supplies. And then, once school started, it was much like the second part of their sixth year. Classes were held and homework was done… sometimes. Gryffindor won the House and Quidditch Cups. But the day before graduation, Draco walked out of Harry’s life. All because of a misunderstanding. Knowing how important everything that was going on was, Blaise stepped up. He comforted Harry and got him through the night. When they couldn’t find Draco the next day at graduation, he kept the Gryffindor calm once more.
“Yeah, okay,” Harry answered. “Is that all?” Theresa nodded and watched as Blaise helped him off the table. Harry made his way to his room and closed the door behind him.
Harry pressed one slick finger into his husband, pumping slowly in and out. Then he added another. Draco’s pleas were a running litany that hardened Harry’s cock. He was only a man, after all. His sexy husband pleading and begging for sex was a turn on, one he couldn’t deny. He scissored his fingers to open Draco up for him. Even though he knew it was useless, Draco begged for faster and harder ministrations. As expected, Harry ignored them. He did add a third finger, however, to be sure he would not harm his husband.
“Ah, welcome to the land of English, Poppy,” Severus said, setting down his quill and smiling… almost, pleasantly. “I could not understand what you were saying so I merely ignored you.” The smile vanished and the Potions Master was back. “What can I do for you Poppy?”
insulted one of the hippogriffs, which caused a stampede. Harry and I were given detention with Hagrid to find the hippogriffs that had run off into the Forbidden Forest.”
“We’re sorry, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said, looking sheepish. “I told Harry that I wanted you to check to see if you could find out the gender of our baby today, but he said he didn’t want to know until it was bourn. We had an argument, then settled it. In the Forest, anytime we had an argument the wand settled it. We spun it and whoever it pointed to more won the argument. Sometimes that was a bad thing and sometimes that was a good thing. Either way, that’s the end of the argument. Harry won. This time.”
“Blaise, your turn.” Blaise walked forward and allowed the doctor to take some strands from his right temple as well. “I have added Draco Malfoy’s hair to the paternity test on the left. I am now adding Blaise Zabini’s hair to the paternity test on the right. I am now swirling both carefully to mix the hairs and paternity tests. It will only take a moment to get the results.” Sure enough, as soon as she stopped moving the vials, the one on the right (Blaise’s) started turning a deep red colour. “The vial on the right, the one containing Blaise Zabini’s hair, has turned a violent red. He is not McKay’s biological father. The one of the left, Draco Malfoy’s, has remained blue. He is McKay’s biological father. I state, for the record, that Draco is McKay’s biological father and Harry is, for lack of a better term, McKay’s biological mother. Take the antiserum please.”
Harry started gesturing, but was cut off by Pomfrey. “Can someone explain to me what just happened? And why you were both on the floor? And why you both felt the need to completely ignore me?”
“The first three months I thought about turning you in, but I didn’t. I couldn’t then. I am repaying my life dept to you in this manner: I am not telling the Dark Lord of your spying and therefore am keeping you alive. Do you accept these terms?”
The two men stared at the door in silence, then looked at each other. Harry shrugged, signaling his willingness to let the argument end. Draco sighed dramatically and rolled his eyes, but he too conceded. “Don’t think this means you won, Potter,” he quipped.
, before him, Draco dropped the velvet box where he stood, turned on his heel, and left the school. He walked to the edge of the Hogwarts wards, took one last look at the place where he’d gotten to know Harry, and apparated out, never wanting to be seen again.
Harry raised his right hand with two fingers extended and placed them on his cheekbone. Then he dragged them to his jaw line before moving the hand to Draco’s left cheekbone and doing the same thing there.
“Apparently he didn’t because he saw that and then left, not telling anyone where he was going. Harry started to freak out. I told him I’d pretend to be his fiancé until we found Draco and explained things to him. But Draco didn’t want to be found, so we took our plans a step further. I married Harry to keep his pregnancy under wraps. We sleep in separate rooms in the same hallway in case he needs something. I hired one of the best medi-witches around to live here. She promised to keep everything quiet since this is Harry Potter.”
“You’ll laugh,” Harry said, looking down. “But when I was still living with my aunt, before I found out about being a wizard and Hogwarts, I got really sick one day and had to stay home from school. My aunt, while she was cleaning, was listening to the radio and this muggle song came on about a bunch of different islands. I can’t remember all of it, but can we go to all the ones I can remember? Just… just to spend a few days at each one?”
“Once your father let us know there was something wrong in Professor Snape’s room and Hermione let us know something was mortally wrong with Harry, the obvious conclusion was to come here via emergency floo,” the headmaster interjected before a fight could break out. “You know the rest since you were here. What of the past may I share with Miss Granger, Draco?”
“Let him stew,” Hermione said. “It’s good for him. If I could get some answers, I can explain it to him. Malfoy. Er, Draco, I mean. You seem to be key in this mystery. What is going on here? Why do they keep referring to you as Potter-Malfoy?”
He couldn’t explain about the DA and their charmed coins. Instead, he mimed the signs for Hermione – bushy hair and opening a book. Draco rolled his eyes; of course Granger knew a spell for their situation. Didn’t she always? He watched as Harry conjured four bracelets, simple in design and silver in color. He held each individually and concentrated on the spell he wanted cast on them. When finished, he put one on himself. Then he stood and went out to the living room to get Snape’s attention.
Harry slowly moved his right palm over his face from forehead to chin, then took two fingers and moved them from right cheekbone to chin before repeating that movement on Draco.
“Ah, Severus. After Harry removed his Mark, he needed to rest. It was the same with your father, but Severus’ was more difficult for Harry to deal with. That is what caused the magic depletion.” He looked over at Hermione, allowing her time to fit more pieces into her puzzle. “However, Severus began acting strangely. It was your father’s friendship with him that led us here. That, and a burning piece of jewellery.”
By the end of the class, Hermione had everything but the teacup filled with Earl Grey. She was given eight out of ten extra credit points, and full credit for everything else. Ron had a teapot, milk dish, sugar dish, four teacups, and all the accompanying parts to each of those. Two of the teacups didn’t match, and there was no tea. He was given full credit minus ten points for the two teacups. Neville hadn’t done that badly either. All of his tea set matched, and he even had a bit of tea, though not Earl Grey, in the teapot. His problem was that instead of handles, all the teacups and the teapot had fluffy cotton tails instead of handles. He had fifteen points taken off.
“Bloody Hell Potter. You never do anything simple, do you?” Snape grumbled, laying his student on the ground slowly and taking his mask off.
“It’s no use Madam Pomfrey,” Draco said. “He hasn’t slept while I have since our second month gone. We were attacked by woodlouse. He won’t allow both of us to sleep at the same time anymore. Besides, it allowed one of us to be the lookout, more often than not it was him.” He yawned. Harry tucked him in and kissed his forehead. Then he sat at the end of Draco’s bed cross-legged and watched the two adults with wary eyes.
“Please join hands with your betrothed and listen to that which I am about to say. Above you are the stars, below you are the stones, as time doth pass, remember... Like a stone should your love be firm; like a star should your love be constant. Let the powers of the mind and of the intellect guide you in your marriage, let the strength of your wills bind you together, let the power of love and desire make you happy, and the strength of your dedication make you inseparable. Be close, but not too close. Possess one another, yet be understanding. Have patience with one another, for storms will come, but they will pass quickly.
“Yes, I’m aware I’m as full as it gets already. Now get that prick in me or so help me- YES! Right there, love. Right there! Oh yes! That’s it!” He gave a long, low groan of satisfaction as Harry rubbed across his prostate as he pulled out. He was instantly moving back in however, using long, slow movements to distract and drive Draco to madness.
“No. He explained it as a bastardized version of Muggle Sign Language,” Draco explained. “We came up with symbols and signs for the most common words we used. When he speaks of him, Weasley, and Granger, he holds up three fingers like so. And when he speaks of Dumbledore, he widens his eyes and motions like he’s stroking his beard. When he speaks of Voldemort, he holds up two fingers in the shape of a ‘v’ and then makes a slashing motion with his right hand. I thought it was ingenious since he needed to communicate with me somehow.”
“But if everyone thinks you proposed to me, they’re going to wonder why I’m wearing a ring and you’re not.”
“That is going to happen regardless, Mr. Malfoy,” Snape said with a smirk. “However, I will see when the other professors are free. Any certain day?”
While marking his territory, Harry’s hands moved around Draco’s front to his nipples. Through the robes, he teased the nubs carefully, aware of their acute sensitivity this late in the pregnancy. Draco loved nipple play. He could even come from it alone nowadays. But that wasn’t the plan right now. With the blonde moaning and humping the air, trying to find some friction for his hard and leaking cock, and Harry now unbuttoning his lover’s robes slowly, the pair was lost in their own world.
Harry lay Draco down on the bed as instructed, but not quite in the way Poppy had expected. He had actually climbed up on the bed himself and arranged Draco so he was still being cradled in his lap. “Mr. Potter, this is highly unsuitable. Please place Mr. Malfoy on the bed and remove yourself.” Harry shook his head fiercely, strengthening his hold on Draco. “I cannot treat either of you if you are holding him as such.” She moved forward to physically separate the pair, but the piercing glare Harry was sending her made her stop. “Mr. Potter, what has happened these last five months?”
“Yeah, contractions started about two hours ago. Don’t Harry!” he said when Harry reached for his wrist and the bracelet there. “This is only the second contraction I’ve had! They don’t need to come yet when the contractions are so far apart. It won’t be coming just yet. Leave them to their jobs. It’s the first day of school. I’m sure Pomfrey has plenty of homesick firsties and it’s not really the first day of school until a cauldron explodes in a class or two. I’m fine. You’re here with me. We just need to do like the books said. Like Pomfrey said.”
“Keep giving answers like that, Mr. Potter, and you will stay one very happy man for the rest of your life.” He kissed his lover soundly on the lips. Then he curled into Harry’s arms, his back to the Gryffindor’s chest, for a cuddle. Really, he’d gotten used to the idea of cuddling. And, to be even more honest, he liked it. With Harry and only Harry, of course. Two fingertips moved across this cheek and caused him to smile. “I love you too, Harry. With all my heart.”
The question startled the witch. “Why do I want the job, Mr. Zabini? Because I am one of the foremost experts in male pregnancy and I believe that, under my care, everything will run smoothly for your first child.”
“Molly and Arthur. Professor Sinistra. Twins… Female twins. Oh, the Patil twins.” Harry pointed over to the other side of the crowd. “Male twins, for the Weasley twins. Hagrid. Oliver. Jack. Katie. Make sense to you now?” he asked everyone in general. Several people started talking at once to each other and to Draco. Nothing made any sense.
“I am not telling them that!” Draco suddenly shrieked. “No, it is not important for them to know. Harry, I draw the line. I–” He was interrupted by Harry’s gesturing. “It is
Snape sneered at the man. Luna giggled. “I bet you two came across some Moon Frogs,” she said, smiling. Harry was just grateful she didn’t write that down in her notes.
Harry just flipped him the bird before cuddling with Draco on the couch for the rest of the night. Snape left when it was time for dinner, making sure the house elves brought food for Harry and Draco first. Then he had two detentions to oversee, which didn’t allow him back to his rooms until late. Which was perfectly fine by Harry and Draco. They had found other things to occupy themselves with for the rest of the night.
“That’s because you couldn’t see it under my robes. Most brides wear a blue garter or something of the sort. I got close enough I figured.”
“Her name is Weasley now. And to keep from getting her and Ron confused,” Harry continued before Draco could start in, “you could call them Ron and Hermione.”
“Now Severus,” Dumbledore started, “let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Who else have you told this to?”
She was quiet for a moment. “You’ve asked Harry, right? Making a decision like this could upset him greatly.”
“Where is Potter? I must thank him. This changes everything. This changes everything! Where is Draco? I saw him earlier? I must speak with him now. And Potter. I must thank Potter.”
Another contraction came, this time only an hour after the previous one. It was already past nine o’clock at night. Snape said he was going to bed and to wake him if he was needed. Narcissa and Molly and Harry all took pepper-up potions and stayed with Draco. When possible, he napped. Otherwise, he lay and sniffled at the discomfort or walked the nursery quietly with Harry’s assistance.
As he neared his quarters, he lowered his wards and checked for any of Potter’s own wards. They didn’t always remember silencing charms, but sometimes he got lucky. When no extra wards were found, he knocked loudly on the door and waited a few moments before slowly opening it. He peered around its edge to see Harry and Draco standing in a corner, with Harry positioned protectively in front of Draco and hand raised.
After a few moments of silence, Mrs. Zabini sighed. “So he’s pregnant with Draco’s baby, and you’re doing him a favour by marrying him so he doesn’t have a bastard child?”
The here and now was important as well, of course. Getting Harry awake and aware was top priority. However, Draco was a firm believer in letting him recover on his own time. They were safe at Hogwarts, in Snape’s rooms. Everything they could ever need was here. Harry was safest here, period. As long as Voldemort was out there, Hogwarts was safe. And the day Hogwarts was not safe... It didn’t bare thinking about.
“Yeah. Thanks Blaise. Really.” In just a few moments, both were sound asleep. However, that wouldn’t last for very long. Harry awoke to a sharp kick in the side. “You need to cut that out McKay Draconis Zabini, right now. Blaise will be most upset if he’s woken twice in one night because of you. Now settle down. I mean it. Don’t wake Blaise.”
Harry nodded, moving down Draco’s neck to just below his pulse point. It was a very sensitive spot for the blonde. The reaction was immediate: Draco ground down against him, an answering hardness that was equally naked was rubbed against him. Draco moved to impale himself on the length, but Harry stopped him, gesturing for a few moments before just holding Draco’s hips and rocking back and forth. Draco nodded, holding onto Harry’s shoulders. It didn’t take very long. After the dream he’d had, Harry was on edge. And the silent cry of ecstasy never failed to send Draco tumbling after him into the land of bliss.
Just as he was putting on his second coat, Blaise came out of his study to see Harry at the back door. “Harry, you know it’s not a good idea to be outside in this weather. What if you got sick or something? You’ve only got about another month before McKay is due. I don’t want anything to jeopardize that. Please, stay inside Harry?”
“Uh, yeah, Mum,” Ron murmured, looking away. “It was for their safety, ya know? We couldn’t say anything.”
“There is no way in the world you could understand what I'm going through!” Draco snapped, turning away from the group and fleeing the room. They all watched him leave, each thinking different things about the young man.
“No. But you’re just in time. Harry and I were talking just before Draco was woken and you came in.”
“How nice of you to volunteer Severus!” Dumbledore beamed. “If you could see that he is taken care of and placed in Minerva’s capable hands, you can then return to your other duties as previously discussed.” And that was the end of that discussion.
“Of course, Severus. But Harry and I haven’t had sex outside our rooms since our last conversation,” Draco insisted.
“Well now, where are you two lovebirds off to?” Mrs. Zabini asked with a large smile. There were still tears in her eyes. It’s not everyday that your only son gets married to Harry Potter.
When he'd woken up this morning, Draco had been laying there beside him, sound asleep. There was no breakfast in bed, no presents, nothing. Okay. That was okay. Draco and he could celebrate that evening or something. Surely that was why Draco didn't say anything before he went to work.
“So we got the Marauder’s Map,” Ron picked up, “and looked around to see if we could see where Harry was. We discovered he wasn’t here, he’s not in Hogwarts. But we also discovered that Malfoy isn’t in Hogwarts either. Just this morning you said he was in the hospital wing with Madam Pomfrey. Well, he’s not. And two months is too long to heal from something. Madam Pomfrey can re-grow bones overnight!”
“Calm down Harry,” Blaise soothed. “I just want you to tell him about Draco at every possible second. I want him to have no doubts that his other daddy is Draco Malfoy, arrogant and stubbourn prick of Slytherin.”
However, the pair had to return to their beds every night. At first Pomfrey tried to keep them in separate beds, but she always found them sleeping in the same bed when she went to wake them. They remained in the private room with the door locked and warded to prevent unwanted guests from entering. It was a shock when, a week later, Snape offered his guest rooms for their usage. He knew Draco didn’t want to be in the infirmary. And he wanted Draco close by. He had everything he could need at close hand, and what he didn’t he would soon. The only problem was Harry. He didn’t like the boy and the feeling was returned. But he knew that with Draco came Harry, so he swallowed a bit of pride and opened his doors to them both. It was allowed.
“Okay, so you began to rely on one another. I can understand that. You kept one another safe and looked out for the other. I don’t understand how you became so close as to warrant a child though.”
One of the fireworks Fred and George set off suddenly started singing, heralding the arrival of a ginormous birthday cake sporting six layers and eighteen sparklers. The fact that each layer was a different color and the colors clashed with each other made Harry smile. The fact that the cake was leaning slightly due to the differently shaped layers was even better. It reminded him of the Burrow. Molly had really outdone herself.
Blaise chuckled. There was silence for a few moments before Blaise rose to his feet. “Would you all care to follow me please? I have some ham to fry for Harry’s cravings.” He didn’t wait for any answers, merely walked away. The four immediately followed him into the large kitchen. The house elves there greeted them and got any drinks they asked for, as well as the ham from the freezer Blaise asked for. Blaise used a thawing spell to thaw the ham, and then began to fry strips for Harry. He worked in silence for a few moments.
As Draco’s eyes drooped, Harry carefully bundled Corvus into his arms. A quick thought had the boy bundled up in a swaddle of a light green color with little hippogriffs dancing around the edges and a matching hat. He made sure Draco was successfully settled into a nap before moving to the rocking chair he’d conjured next to Draco’s bedside. Then he simply sat and rocked with his son for more than an hour.
“Thisss isss acceptable.” He flicked his hand at the man and watched him scurry back to his spot in line. “Goyle, report on the happeningsss at Hogwartsss.”
Everything had been set up as Draco had dictated. As Draco was one for tradition, he demanded that Harry not see him the night before or the day of their wedding until they met at the alter. Harry was not okay with these demands however. It caused a large argument, half silent though it was, and ended with Harry being stunned and then potioned to sleep. He would not let Draco out of his sight, much less for an entire night and day. No, the protective Gryffindor was having none of that. So Snape drugged him. Another room had been added onto their quarters for the time, so that Harry could stay in his coma and Draco could work with Dumbledore and Pomfrey on wedding plans.
“Right, yes. Getting ahead of the story, but I guess you should know,” Draco mused. “Harry is mute. He cannot speak. He can hear. To communicate, we created a sort of gesture-based language. He was correcting me when I said ‘we’ insulted the hippogriffs instead of ‘I’. There are no, er, blubbery… what’s-its.”
A knock on the door heralded Luna’s arrival. She sat down in the chair next to the fire and greeted everyone in the same dreamy manner she usually did. The soon-to-be seventh year student was ready with her quill and parchment, the quill stuck behind her ear. Her radish earrings swung merrily from her earlobes.
“Your father is the Dark Lord’s… lover, for lack of a better term. When the Dark Lord orders him to, he drops trou and bends over. He’s been doing it for years now, long before you were bourne. The Dark Lord told him that he wanted you to take your father’s place, that your father was to start conditioning you to be the perfect whore. He came to me after we’d been dismissed and begged me to keep you away, that he knew I was a spy and this was me repaying my lifedebt for him not telling about my spying. I told him you were lost in the Forbidden Forest, but that I would keep you away. And now that I know you are able to carry, there’s no way I will allow you to go back there and become his… brood mare. Not even as a spy like me.”
Instead of complying with Draco’s wishes, Harry reached around and began to lightly tease one of Draco’s nipple again.
“I still reserve the right to look at my child and choose a different name,” Draco huffed, his hand going to his belly. “If the names we chose just don’t sit right once I see him or her, I have the right as bearer to change the name.”
“Every year on this day we’d get on a big red train and travel to school. I loved this school. It’s where I fell in love with your real daddy, and met your other daddy. And every year, it never failed, your real daddy would come in and say something mean about me or one of my friends, Ron and Hermione. But in my fifth and six years there, Ron and Hermione grew closer together and forgot about me. It’s okay though. That’s when I found your real daddy and your other daddy. We all became friends. Then I defeated the big, nasty, scary man named Voldemort. Do you remember me telling you about him? I want you to never be afraid to say his name. He’s really gone now and nothing will hurt you or me ever again. I won’t let it.” A few tears leaked from the corners of Harry’s eyes. “I won’t let it,” he whispered again.
The male doctor walked into the room and immediately seized Harry’s hand, pumping it furiously. “Mr. Potter, I mean Mr. Zabini it is a pleasure to meet you. I just want you to know that any care you receive from me will be the best this field has to offer. I’ve been working with male pregnancies for nearly twenty years, and my own wife has had four children in the past twenty years.”
One by one, he floated presents to Harry’s hands to open. At the receiving of each, the gifter would shout out that it was their gift. After opening it, Harry would sign ‘thank you’ by placing his fingertips of an open palm on his chin and dropping it away until his hand was palm up in front of his face. He received all sorts of chocolates and candies, books on children naming and rearing, some Quidditch supplies, and many baby gifts.
“Draco doesn’t want this. He doesn’t need this. Any of this. I cannot allow what I do to become what he does. Please, Severus, please help him. Tie him to a chair or chain him to a wall until he listens, but for the love of Merlin don’t let my life become his,” Lucius begged. Severus nodded once and then left. Lucius sent a silent prayer to all the Gods and Goddesses above for help.
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
Even as Harry held him close, he let Draco cry and yell and beat him. It didn’t really hurt, until Draco punched his nose.
Blaise simply wrapped his arms around Harry and whispered, “It’s okay Harry. Just eat the ham and then I will tell you about the doctors so you may pick which one you like best.”
“Very, very slowly,” Draco said with an exasperated roll of his eyes. “We worked on the most needed words first. He’d make a sign over and over until I guessed correctly what he meant. Eventually we realized that writing in the air or conjuring a paper and pen were easier than that. His sign for me, other than pointing at me, is to slick his hair back.” Harry demonstrated as Draco explained. “For Professor Snape, he points to his nose. Harry assures me that this is because of your talent at potions and nothing else.” There were a few titters from the crowd at that. "Headmaster Dumbledore’s sign is to stroke his beard. Please is a rotating fist on his chest. Hungry is eating a sandwich. Thirsty is drinking a glass of water. Sleepy is placing both hands under one side of his head with palms together.
During one of his fits, Harry shut him up with a hard kiss. Draco was seated on a bench in front of a vanity, so Harry leaned down and took command of his husband’s lips. Immediately, Draco surrendered and opened his mouth. Their tongues met and glided over one another. Harry’s hands cupped Draco’s cheeks, forcing the blonde to tilt his head slightly for better access. Then he started to trail kisses across his husband’s cheek to his earlobe, behind his ear, down his neck. He left a rather large love bite at the nape of Draco’s neck.
“Not really,” Harry said with a sniffle. “I love Draco Malfoy, and I always will. No matter how much of a prat he’s being right now. When he left, he broke my heart. Blaise kept me strong enough to deal with these things for now, and I thank him with every breath I take, but he’s not Draco. I tried to tell him that he couldn’t do this for me, but he insisted, saying he wanted to help his friends. I’m so sorry Mrs. Zabini. I really am.”
“I think it would be a marvellous idea. I will talk to Minerva and Poppy about it, and floo in tonight after dinner. Is that acceptable, Severus?”
"You know what, fine. I'm gonna go into town and I'm going to find you a christmas jumper that you will love, even if it kills me because that is how nice of a boyfriend I am, Draco." Harry walked out of their flat and slammed the door.
"You are unbelievable. Do you have anything to say, Dudley? Have any insults to throw at an innocent person?" Draco spat, his voice laced with venom.
"There's a second part to the present." Draco smiled as he gently handed the box that contained Bud over to Harry.
Draco knew he had to something about this. His thoughts were consuming him. His burning desire to ask him had been washed out by his thoughts but the blaze was growing stronger and Draco had to do something about it.
Draco was convinced that no one could make him happier than Harry, no one could make him feel more comfortable than Harry, no one could make him laugh like Harry, no one could make his heart beat the was Harry did. No one could ever replace Harry.
"Where is my bow tie? Have you seen my bow tie? I need my bow tie." Harry asked, frantically searching for the bow tie.
Ron drove as quickly as possible to Ginny's house. As soon as they stepped onto the pavement, the three began their search, looking in and behind every bush and hedge, up every tree, they checked in shops, down alleyways but Harry was nowhere.
"You're a boy then. What shall we name you? I should probably leave that to Harry, I'll just call you... Bud for now. Okay, Bud?" Draco gently stroked the puppy behind his ears.
Harry and Draco were snuggled up close to each other on the sofa in the 8th year common room. The two had gotten together at the start of the year and it was their first Christmas as a couple. They were the only two people in 8th year that had stayed at Hogwarts over the Christmas holidays. It was quite nice being the only two there, they could do whatever they wanted and they really enjoyed it. Today, though, they had no idea what to do, they were both so bored. The two had been firing ideas about what they should do at each other for the last fifteen minutes.
Draco didn't only just search in his free time. He created cork boards, he looked through everyone's alibis. He made sure that he hadn't missed anything because Draco needed Harry to come back. He needed Harry to come home. He needed Harry to survive.
"Harry? Harry? Mate, are you okay?" Ron asked, looking down at Harry with a looked of concern and confusion.
Harry saw a light pink dust across Draco's cheeks. He lifted his hand and placed it against the side of Draco's face and gently ran his thumb across Draco's cheek. Harry felt Draco lean into the touch. It was such a simple gesture but it seemed to say everything that needed to be said at that moment as the two boys simply smiled at each other.
Draco couldn't believe the words coming out of this woman's mouth. How dare she try and imply that Harry ran away? Draco felt the anger begin to build up, frustration was leaking into his veins.
Both boys took a deep breath as they pushed open the doors to the great hall and stepped in. The hall looked amazing. The ceiling was bewitched to show the night sky with snow falling gently down. Tables covered with white cloth framed the open space in the floor that was presumable the dance floor. Lilies, roses, snowdrops and orchids were delicately placed around the entire hall and a Christmas tree decorated so beautifully stood tall and proud at the back of the hall.
Harry went up to the counter and ordered a hot chocolate for Draco and a gingerbread latte for himself. Harry also got two mince pies. He waited a couple of minutes for the drinks and went to sit down with Draco.
Everyday Draco went to visit Harry in the hospital. Everyday in the build up to Christmas, Draco would bring Harry's advent calendar chocolate and place it next to the one he'd received the day before on his bedside table. Sometimes Draco brought two, he sometimes stayed over night at the hospital, never falling asleep purposely.
Fuck, they were a death eater. They were a part of the group that nearly destroyed the entire wizarding world. Why they weren't rotting away in a cell in Azkaban was beyond them sometimes.
"Yes you did. This might give you a heart attack so brace yourself. I did some washing yesterday and I put around 10 pairs of your socks in the wash. I dried 10 pairs of your socks and I put 10 pairs of socks back in your sock drawer the way you like your socks placed."
Harry reluctantly got out of bed, got changed and walked downstairs. He saw Draco opened his mouth to say something but Harry held up his hand.
"Pansy told me she needed to practice animals." Draco sounded almost pained talking about the tattoo.
Harry sat in silence for a moment. "I'll make a deal with you. I'll take it, if you let me wrap a present."
"Ah, yes. I don't want to influence your decision in anyway but Harry has never been a fan of big events that involve him. I know he's told you how much he hates his fame and how difficult it first was for him." Hermione said, her mind flicking back to all those times Harry had come crying to her, telling her he couldn't cope anymore.
Harry lightly smacked the back of Draco's head but smiled despite himself. He grumbled under his breath as he stood up to get the food.
As Harry and Ron approached Draco's place, Harry shot them a quick text letting them know they were here. Harry took a deep breath and wiped his slightly sweaty palms against his jeans. Was he nervous? Why was he nervous?
Harry stood up and made his way back to his dorm. Right now, he needed to flop on his bed and scream into a pillow. Harry wasn't exactly sure what was happening, Malfoy was making him feel things and that was not good.
Even though Harry was so clear to Draco in this photo, nothing else was. He couldn't remember where this was taken. Draco looked at the rest of the photo. He saw Dean and Seamus in the background, Dean was driving and Seamus was pointing and what looked liked shouting at something.
"He did everything for you for sixteen years. He cooked, he cleaned, he did every single chore and you're telling me he didn't do anything for you?" Draco asked. He was in shock, he couldn't believe what he was hearing.
Liking someone was different from what Harry had thought it would be like, especially when it came to Draco. He thought that he would be able to say what he liked about Draco, but that just felt unfair. It felt unfair to only say some things that he liked about Draco when he adored everything about Draco. The small things became so noticeable to Harry, like the way their eyes changed from a metallic silver to a pale blue if the light hit just right or the way that they ran their hands through their hair as a nervous habit. The warmth in his heart when he looked or thought about Draco wasn't just concentrated in one part of his body, it flooded throughout his veins causing his whole body to feel warm and fuzzy.
"They were but they broke up shortly after the war because they both came to terms with their sexualities. Ron is aromantic and Hermione is homoromantic and demisexual." Harry explained. "You know, now that I think about it, I don't actually think I have any straight friends."
"Firstly, how are socks going to ruin you reputation? And secondly, an aesthetic?! You wear black all the time, you call that an aesthetic?"
Draco rubbed a hand across their face, surprised when they felt a dampness on their cheeks. They hadn't even realised they were crying. Draco let out a heavy breath as they swung their legs out of bed and got up to go to the kitchen. The cool tiles were a nice contrast to their burning skin.
"Right, now that you've had some coffee, there's an outdoor ice rink that's opened in the market square in town and we are going in half an hour so get your shit together." Draco said.
"I ordered food earlier, it'll be here in twenty minutes." Draco said as they flicked through the channels, stopping on one that was playing his favourite romantic comedy.
Draco didn't even realise he was crying until Harry took his hand away from his and used his thumb to gently wipe away Draco's tears. Even an action as simple as that could make Draco's heart explode. Draco smiled softly at his love as he felt Harry's hand rest against his cheek. Draco allowed himself to melt into the touch.
"I know what you've done to him. I know about the abuse, the torment. He still has hundreds of scars. Do you actually have any idea how much you broke him?"
"Ugh." Draco whined. "I don't want to hear about your dumb dates if I don't even know the girls name."
Draco, Harry, Seamus and Dean in one car and Ron, Neville and Blaise in another car as they drove around the U.K. They were gone for a month, visiting famous sights, beaches, forests, big cities, mountains and every moment of it was amazing.
Draco took a deep breath and nodded his head. Harry took Draco's hand and they made their way towards the doors of the great hall. Harry knew Draco was nervous, no one but Harry had seen him in makeup before and he knew Draco was scared of someone telling his father. Harry vowed to himself that he would always make sure Draco felt safe and he would protect Draco at all costs.
Bud was the main focus of attention all Christmas for everyone. He was so cute, always cocking his head, having one ear up and the other down and just being the cutest, most perfect dog and being the best Christmas present Harry ever received.
Harry smiled at Draco before taking his hand. Draco pulled Harry close to him and began to sway softly to the music. Harry mirrored Draco's actions. Draco led Harry around the circular field, twirling him occasionally, earring and huge smile from Harry. The two stared into each other's eyes, the forest and storm, a perfect combination. Their eyes told different stories, both tragic but both full of hope. The snow fell softly onto the boys hair. The snow barely visible in Draco's platinum locks but very prominent in Harry's messy, raven hair. The music slowly drew to a stop and Harry and Draco stood in each other's arms, their clouds of breath merging to form one.
Draco sighed and stood up. He needed to go for a walk, he hadn't been outside in a couple of days and some fresh air would probably help clear his mind. Draco got up, slipped some shoes on and reached out to put his coat on. He stopped before his hand could reach his own black coat and instead redirected his hand to one of Harry's coats. Harry was smaller than him so nearly all of Harry's clothes didn't fit Draco but he had this one coat that was oversized and it fit Draco perfectly.
"Hi, how can I help you?" The receptionist asked, her demeanour seeming too sweet for a police station.
Harry sighed, he needed to go to dinner but he really didn't want to wipe the kiss off of his neck. Instead he just covered it with a glamour and hoped nobody would notice. Harry hurried down to dinner and tried his hardest not to make eye contact with Malfoy as he sat down and ate.
Harry broke his lips away from Draco's, watching as a brief look of confusion and disappointment wash over Draco's face before quickly reattaching them to his neck. Harry sucked and nibbled against Draco's neck, trying to find his sweet spot. Harry breathed in Draco's intoxicating scent. Harry knew he had found it when Draco let out a low moan and pulled gently on Harry's hair. Harry smirked into Draco's neck as he kissed Draco, making sure to leave a mark.
Draco had no routine anymore. He had taken a break from work, Draco was sure he would have lost his mind if he was still at work. Draco found himself eating pasta or cereal at midnight and having a shower at 3am more often than not. Draco honestly didn't know what to do with himself anymore, he just felt so lost. He felt trapped.
"Oh, sorry. My mistake. I just  though you were sneaking out of the house for Merlin knows what reason." Draco said, sarcastically.
Harry rarely went anywhere alone, he liked having someone with him to provide him with a sense of security and safety. The only place Harry went alone was Godric's Hollow where his mum, dad, Sirius and Remus were buried. Harry went back to his birthplace every month to visit their graves. Draco offered to come with him every time but Harry had always declined. Draco knew that Harry needed his space and it was still very painful for him and Draco knew Harry would bring him along one day when he was ready.
Harry looked more closely at the person trying to figure out where he had seen those eyes before. He could see that colour and gaze in his mind like he saw them yesterday but the memory that they came from was foggy and unclear. He took a sip from his drink, and then all of a sudden it hit him.
Harry leant forwards and captured Draco's lips in his own and Harry knew that anyone who got to kiss them like this would be star struck. The feeling of Draco's breathing, the small noise they made in their throat, the softness of their lips, the warmth of their skin, it all made Harry feel like his heart was breaking apart and being mended together again, over and over. Draco's hands tightened around Harry's waist, their mouth pressing against Harry's bottom lip and god, what Harry would give to feel like this constantly.
Harry opened his mouth to say something before closing it quickly and looking at the floor. He had been freaking out ever since Draco had agreed to go on a date with him. Harry hadn't been able to eat because with all the butterflies in his stomach and his head buzzing, there was no way on Earth he'd be able to swallow a bit, let along a whole plate.
Draco Malfoy standing there in a mesh top and skirt looking really, really good. Draco looked at Harry, their eyebrows furrowed in confusion before turning back to their drink.
Draco slowly leant forward and caught Harry in a passionate kiss. Their lips locked together perfectly. The kiss was everything, full of love, full of magic. The two boys pulled apart breathless and Harry leant into Draco. Harry was quite a bit shorter than Draco and Draco loved it. He could give Harry forehead kisses whenever he wanted. Harry also loved it, he loved the forehead kissed form Draco, he loved the fact that he could snuggle into Draco but his favourite was when the two boys hugged as Harry could feel Draco's heart slowly beating.
Harry came sprinting into the kitchen, put some oven gloves on and carefully took the burning mince pies out of the oven. He placed the tin in the sink and turned the tap on. The flames died out pretty much straight away but them smell of burnt pastry lingered in the air.
Draco stepped outside into the cold air, already feeling a lot calmer than he did upstairs. He could always count on a walk to make him feel better. Draco nestled his face into his scarf as his breath rose into the air above him. Draco didn't really have a destination, he just needs to escape that flat for a few hours. Draco slowed as he passed a coffee shop, debating whether to go in or not. He decided against it seeing as he probably would be apparating soon. Draco hadn't realised that his mind had already made the subconscious decision to go to Godric's Hollow.
All the rest of the time they spend in Harry’s bed, or the shower, or, the night before Draco has to leave, out on the roof terrace, pressed together in one rusted lawn chair. Draco in his lap is a warm barrier against the bite of the night air, his tongue in Harry’s mouth better than a shot of Firewhiskey for keeping the cold at bay as he gets Harry off with one hand, shuddering when Harry slips both of his own under Draco’s shirt and pulls him closer.
. There’s always been a strong dynamic there, but Draco likes to think he’s mellowed out a bit, and it doesn’t sit right with him, the tension in the air whenever they interact, the possibility that Potter still holds enough resentment to prevent them getting along. They’re quite literally living side by side, and Draco would rather things are as comfortable as they can be if they’re going to keep rubbing shoulders like this.
They get Potter up and out into the snow again faster than they’ve ever managed, and Draco quickly finds and unlocks the car. He’s watched Granger do it so many times that he can replicate the wand movement perfectly.
“Gin—” he starts but she glares at him and moans again. Harry shakes his head at her, grinning in spite of himself. She wasn’t especially loud when they were together and he really doesn’t see her like that anymore, but it still makes something in his stomach sit up and take notice. She’s beautiful, after all, and one of his best friends, and she’s on his bed.
“Sorry,” he says, leaning heavily on the doorframe. “I didn’t mean that. I meant why. Why is yoga happening?”
Draco doesn’t have to leave until late, the Portkey scheduled for evening so that he has the whole day before he has to go back home. Harry cooks, makes a curry paste from scratch and gives Draco space to pack his things up. Once he’s finished though, there’s nothing left to do but leave it to simmer and wait for the rice to be done, so he goes in search of Draco.
“Do we really have to have your Aunt Muriel there?” Hermione asks, sitting at their kitchen table whilst Harry and Ron play chess and pretend to be helping with the seating plan for the reception.
Harry nudges at him playfully, hamming it up. “Oh you know, just had to piece my heart back together, no big deal—”
Weasley tries to stun Dolohov but he dances aside and cackles, shoots a jet of fire out of his wand that sets the mouldy curtains alight.
“Is he,” Potter starts to say. Draco can’t look at him, afraid that it’s not real, that he’s not really ok and that if he turns around Potter will be on the floor, bleeding. But he comes up behind Draco until he’s only a few inches away and they both look down at Dolohov’s twitching hand, his wand still clutched in it.
Overheating, Ginny had thought, was at least preferable to being bored. Except now she’s pissed off, sticky and, thanks to Harry’s preoccupation, still not entirely
For some stupid, self-sabotaging reason, Harry practically follows Malfoy upstairs. He could have stayed where he was, slept on the floor or at least dozed against the wall until enough time had passed that Malfoy was probably in bed, asleep, but instead Malfoy’s footsteps have barely faded before Harry’s up and covering a yawn, clapping people on the shoulder goodnight as he passes, climbing the stairs to the third floor.
“Potter,” Malfoy says against his skin, voice unfairly steady. “Potter. Did you know there’s absolutely no sound-proofing between our rooms?”
She’s got them out onto a busier road, steering through traffic, frantic, looking at every road sign they pass. “I don’t know,” she admits. “I thought a hospital maybe, but how would we explain how Harry got hurt? And if the wound is unresponsive to healing spells, Muggle methods might not work either.” She bites her lip, Draco sees her in the mirror. It’s a bad sign.
doesn’t really mean much to anyone outside of the UK, parts of Europe maybe, at a stretch, but Draco seems to be sort of a— big deal here. Harry thinks he knew that, in an abstract sense, knew that hardly anyone makes it through the years of training to qualify for actual flight, but it’s very obvious now he’s actually here. Everyone they pass greets Draco by name, a couple of younger witches and wizards even seeming vaguely star-struck when Draco nods at them. The most Harry gets is a couple of half-curious looks.
For some exasperating reason, Potter apparently doesn’t get the message about leaving Draco alone. Maybe it’s because Draco’d let him keep them up for another hour last night chatting about increasingly ridiculous ways to get Potter to fall asleep. It’d only been when Draco had unthinkingly suggested they find someone to tuck Potter in and Potter had blushed, visible even in the dark of well-past-midnight, that Draco’d had the sense to go back to bed, his eyes heavy and his skin wind-chilled. He’d slept right through until nearly midday this morning, waking from the remnants of a dream with a half-blocked nose and a confusingly warm feeling in his chest.
“Before,” Draco says impatiently. So far everything’s happened almost exactly as it did last time, and he doesn’t know how long he has before he or Potter passes out.
Harry had been wrong, about what it’s like out here. There’s darkness, obviously, but there’s also so much light, this bright, white-hot light splashed everywhere, all across the black, and there’s Draco, separated from him by mere centimetres, instead of miles.
Draco raises an eyebrow at that, momentarily distracted from her attempts at trying to watch Potter without risking the other girl seeing her. “Weasley? Since when do you talk to Weasley?”
Potter grins like he can’t help himself, thinking about his friends. It’s nice, because Potter’s smile always makes Draco feel nice, but there’s a twinge in Draco’s chest. He doesn’t know if anyone from Slytherin is coming back for a repeat year.
“Draco. I’m serious,” Pansy pokes a finger into Draco’s cheek. She looks it too; she’s got her stern face on, which Draco is grudgingly impressed by. Pansy had been out with work friends before Draco had joined her and she’s put away considerably more drinks than Draco. “She’s single, you’re single, you clearly want to shag her brains out, she probably feels the same way..”
, that’s an image. The old inch/mile metaphor springs dazedly to mind — relenting and allowing his brain to create a picture to match the noises he’s been bombarded with for months has apparently opened the floodgates: Malfoy, pale hand wrapped around himself. Malfoy, sweaty and bright-eyed, panting as his fist moves quick and tight. Malfoy getting off in the shower. Malfoy rolling over first thing in the morning and just pushing down into his sheets, half-awake and lazy. Malfoy, unable to stop himself crying out at how good it feels, or else unwilling, liking that someone might hear him, that
It has to be sometime past 9pm now, because the sun hasn’t quite completely set but the house is mostly dark and full and there’s music playing. He and Malfoy stand in the hallway, backs pressed to opposite walls, and Harry can’t quite remember how they got there.
“He’s cold, Weasley. There’s a thing near you that makes hot air come out of these.” Draco slaps the small vent he knows will kick to life if Weasley hurries up and finds the right switch.
Potter finally straightens up and Draco can see his tongue poking out in concentration as his arm goes back, fist clenched, shoulder flexing as he throws.
“I don’t—” He can’t help but look at Potter’s mouth. Someone’s cleaned the blood away and he’s biting his lip, his teeth white against the flesh, eyes wide. It’s stupid and frankly sort of— mortifying, unacceptably
He presses two fingers, slick with distractedly conjured lube, against Malfoy without warning and they slip in with little resistance. Malfoy makes a noise like he’s choking on his own spit and his thighs lock around Harry’s face as Harry gets his mouth back on him and starts moving his fingers, drags them slowly out and back in again. He’s stretched out inside, wet but still a little tight.
Draco’s half-heartedly spread a couple of his books out on his desk, thinking it might be time to start doing some actual work now they’re this side of New Years, but he’s not feeling particularly motivated.
Draco feels the fight go out of him too, overcome with an unwelcome urge to reassure Potter. “It’s fine,” he says, voice breaking between the two words. “I thought, actually, you might,” and then stops, swallows once.
“Pull your weight, slacker,” Ginny stage-whispers at him, shoving him with her foot. “Or do you want him to think you’re so shit in bed that you just lie there like a stuffed Hippogriff.”
“Really?” As much as Draco likes the way snow paints the world clean and white, he’d rather it get warm again. It’s always been easier for him to get out of bed if he can feel the sun on his face, even before the war.
“Alright.” Draco pulls her own top over her head before she can overthink it and lies down next to her. There’s space between them; it’s a pretty big bed.
Draco’s used to the routine, is all: no classes, going where he pleases, studying when he wants. At night it feels like he and Potter are the only ones here, that the school is something secret and theirs. The castle’s been here long before they were born and if it’s survived this past year, he has no doubt it'll be around for generations to come, but still, Draco feels irrationally wary about having to share it.
Harry gives him the abridged version (the one where he hasn’t been secretly pining like a teenager the entire time) but when he’s finished, when Draco’s all caught up and he says, with a soft look, “Sounds like life’s pretty good, then,” Harry can’t resist pushing it, just a tiny bit.
“Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything,” Headmistress Mcgonagall had told him before she’d shut the door behind her and left him to unpack. “Your head of house won’t be here until the new year.” Draco’d nodded, noting her clipped tone and wondering how she could even bear to talk to him.
When Harry was sure the door to his dorm was locked, he immediately grabbed a mirror. He admired the perfect kiss on his neck. Harry traced his fingers around it, his heart beat getting faster and faster.
Hermione shot Harry a confused glance. "Okay, well, come in then. I'll leave the door open for Ron."
"I know the answer to this will be a no but I need to ask anyway. I cannot stop thinking about you. You consume my thoughts everyday and I can't stand it anymore. I just want to be with you, I want to hold you, I want to talk to you, I want you to be mine." Draco's eyes were glistening with tears. "And I look at you everyday and I see your pain, Harry. I just want to make it a little bit better for you and it kills me that I can't. It kills me that I can't talk to you. It kills me that I can't be with you because I love you Harry. I love you." Draco passed to wipe away a tear. "So, Harry Potter, will you go to the ball with me?"
But, this time was different for both suit and event. The suit he was wearing today was perfect (though he did suppose that was a given due to the fact it was literally made just for him). Nothing about it made Harry feel stiff and uncomfortable, in fact, it felt so right wearing this suit and standing where he was at the very moment that it almost scared Harry.
It's strange how attached you can become to an inanimate object. Like you can't function without it or you say sorry to it if you lose it or drop it. As soon as Draco has throw the bracelet, he found himself crossing the room to pick it up. He whispered "I'm sorry" to it over and over again.
Things started to get better when Seamus was caught. He had been apparating around the world and it had been extremely tricky to catch him, but they eventually did. Seamus got sent to Azkaban for kidnap, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, rape and use of an unforgivable curse, and there he would stay for the rest of his life.
