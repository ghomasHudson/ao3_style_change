If I decide, Draco, that I want to be associated with you, and want to love you, then that’s my decision to make alone. If I cared what my mates thought, then I’d be planning the big autumn wedding to Ginny Weasley that the
nonsense, I teased you for being such a sappy poet for me again. We kissed, I massaged your scalp, and your broad hands felt so firm and solid on my sides. I never wanted this moment to end, Harry. But end it did, of course.
I’m going to go back to bed. I'm going to try and get another hour or so of snooze before the morning.
Just, whatever you do, send me a couple of lines every single day. Please. I’ll fret otherwise. At least while you’re at Hogwarts I know that you’re safe.
And love, if I’d enjoyed last night, somehow today’s kiss felt even better, for I knew how you would taste, and how well we fit together. I felt the tickle of your tongue against my own, questing and conquering me, and I heard you make the smallest of breathy sighs. Don’t be embarrassed, my darling. That small noise was like a rod of lightning hitting me and in mere seconds I felt my cock swell in response. I was a little mortified at my intense, instinctive reaction but I couldn’t help it. You overwhelm me. It was all over so much faster than I’d have liked and you slipped away the moment our kiss ceased.
I'll bet that you’re rolling your eyes, but I’ve heard tales about other diaries. I’ve heard stories about rings and lockets and other, innocuous little objects that were magicked to deceive you, and make you act in a way contrary to your character. I imagined, perhaps, that this had happened to me.
Please just tell me, for I’m racking my brains trying to work out what I did wrong. I made my way straight as quickly as I could to the Slytherin dungeons, just as you requested, and I wore my Invisibility Cloak even though most of the corridors were deserted.
Right over supper and rather unceremoniously, I already blurted out my most important news. I had planned to wait until tomorrow or at least until after we finished eating, but I couldn’t contain myself. Not even a second longer. “Mother, I’m in a committed relationship with a wizard,” were my exact words when I wanted to tell her that I fancy someone, that I was in love, or anything of the amorous sort. But that’s the sentence my overly intellectual mind produced for me – isn’t it romantic?
Swallowing Harry finally looked away, to his hands in his lap, the spider in the top corner of the ceiling, the shape of the clouds against the slowly brightening sky, at anything but the person sitting next to him.
It was all still there waiting for him the moment he shut his eyes and Harry had to accept he wasn't getting anymore sleep tonight. Fighting to keep quiet Harry swung his legs off the bed, pulling on a hoodie and his closest pair of jeans.  Taking each step with care Harry crossed the distance to the door, only realizing once it shut behind him that he had no idea where to go.
It took a moment for his words to register, a smile splitting over Harry's face the moment they did. "Know my class schedule Malfoy?"
"You didn't make me uncomfortable, that's not what I meant. I just, things are already changing. I sat at the Gryffindor table. What's next? You wearing Slytherin colors?" He asked.
, treating him like glass, like he was fragile and would break at any second. He just wanted to be normal. Just Harry… He didn’t know what was normal anymore, but it just felt great to have someone not give a damn about how they were around him.
“Oh, alright.” Narcissa said softly, giving her a smile. “How is he?” She asked her. Pansy sat up fully, pulling the covers from herself. “He’ll be alright… I promise.”
Sirius opened his mouth to say something as James stood there, looking guilty. “No! You don’t get to say anything!” Remus spat. “Is that what you have been doing? Have you ‘gotten over’ me? Have you just ruled me hopeless? Is that why you have been telling James these things. Because the Pads I know would have encouraged and supported his brother!” He was breathing hard. “I at least deserve the truth and a goodbye. I don’t need your pity or you staying with me because you feel guilty or obligated to!” He bit his lip, shocked that that had come out of his mouth. This wasn’t about him. It was about James and Sirius and Lily. His love life could come later. “Nevermind, dealing with that later. NOW APOLOGIZE TO YOUR BROTHER!” He demanded, making everyone jumped and Lily tried to hide a smile.
“Shh.. Uncle Harry is here..” He whispered to the child. The baby curled up and grabbed a fistful of his shirt before settling down.
“Do you really think that you are singularly the only person?” He continued with a hiss. “People died, Malfoy. People died and they aren’t coming back.” He yelled, making Draco bit his lip with a frown.
“I owed them both.” He shrugged. “Honey, please.” She nodded, fixing both their teas. “I just… couldn’t believe that Cissy would do that? Draco, yes, that boy doesn’t have a cruel bone in his body. I was wondering when he was going to break. Reminded me of Regulus, honestly.” She paused. “But Cissy… She-“ She stopped, plating the biscuits before bringing it and their teas over to the small battered table.  Harry joined her as Teddy settled down, nodding off to sleep.
Harry didn’t get a chance to answer her because Draco appeared at the bottom of the stairs, looking a bit disheveled. He stared at Andromeda before smiling widely. “Andy!” He moved over, hugging her tightly. “Is mother at home?” He asked her, completely forgetting that Harry was there.
They all filed into the muggle bar, crowding the small booth in the corner. George on the outside, Harry next to him. Dean in the corner with Seamus smushed next to him with Ginny, Ron and Hermione on the other side.
Draco woke to the smell of coffee. He slowly sat up, looking around the room. He didn’t remember how or when he went to bed but that was a common thing for the past few days. He got up, smiling down at the tshirt before padding his way down to the kitchen. He passed Teddy in his swing, watching something that he probably shouldn’t be on the Telly. He walked into the kitchen to find Harry making breakfast as he watched the show and kept an eye on Teddy.
Teddy was watching him from his swing, dozing a bit to the sound of his voice. Draco on the other hand, was sorting through some novels on Andromeda’s shelf, not even paying attention as he sang the song without any hesitation, or holding back.
“What’s wrong with him?” He asked her, hoping that at least he might get something from her. Pansy shut the door, walking up to stand near them.
He had never seen Remus in this light. A sad, confused man who was just trying to be a good father and husband. Trying to make a better world for his child. Just like Harry’s parents had done. It really was history repeating itself. He was the lone survivor with a child left. A child who would never know their parents. Who would never understand just how brave and loving they were. He kicked the box in front of him, spilling out more books but he didn’t care. He pulled himself up and walked out, down the stairs to the main house.
Though, it seemed like the other kept seeking him out to say something, but didn’t go through with it in the end. Even though he had been trying to pull it out of him. He could see it in his eyes, the way they flickered, the way that he held himself back. He recognized the mask the other wore, because it was the same one that he wore for Andromeda and Hermione.  He also recognized the skittish movements the other did, because he had the same reactions to large crowds.
They didn’t say anything to each other again until he was sitting in front of her with his breakfast. “Do I even want to know what happened to your face?” She reached over with a laugh, taking his chin in hand and looking over his injury.
’ card and everyone just did what they were told. Not only was his probation cut two months early, actually eight months early, but he was getting his wand back and he was going back to Hogwarts. He shook his head. Fucking Bastard…
Harry chuckled. “The great Draco Malfoy actually thanking me, I might actually be insane.” He said, grinning. Draco rolled his eyes, looking over the books the other had gotten him. He picked them up, placing them on the desk. “Don’t get use to it. It’s a one time thing.” Draco said, moving back to the bed.
Harry turned his head to Ron who was looking at them in shock. "Oh, yes, Malfoy the victim! How rich!"
“Your grandmother is a very scary woman.” He cooed to Teddy, getting hit with the letter on the shoulder by the older witch. “See.” Harry laughed, taking the letter and putting it back into his pocket.
Harry wiped the tears from his eyes, smoothing the creases out of the pages as he reread the words. Some things made sense now. Actually a lot of things made sense now. He didn’t know what or how to feel. He didn’t know what to do. It was like he was getting a glimpse of something extremely private. He wanted more but he wasn’t so sure if he should.
“So that’s the complication.” He said, nodding as Draco covered up his arm as he moved to go upstairs. “Does he know that you like him?” Chris asked again.
“I get it. You don’t have to explain anything to me.” He said, with a nod as Pansy joined them. She passed Draco a flask and he took a long sip from it.
Harry had stayed for two episodes of his Buffy show that morning before leaving to go to his house, leaving Draco to do nothing all day. He fiddled with the remote to the telly, figuring out how to work it and completely being absorbed by a muggle show called “Real World” for a couple of hours.  He played with Teddy for a bit before getting sucked into a show called TRL.
The next day Harry was at his DIY Centre picking up somethings, being a little more self-conscious around the shop keep than he had been before. He heard low muttering as he picked out some stuff for his kitchen.
Hey guys! I know its been forever, but still alive. Been quarantined in my apartment for like 5 weeks now, so I think as a little pick me up, we could have a Q&A and chat on the fic discord!
"Good to know it's not just me he likes annoying." Ron frowned, stabbing his eggs with more force then necessary.  Harry wasn't paying attention to them as he was more focused on who had just walked by them. "Hey!" He called out.
“I got you rice with your noodles, I hope that is alright.” She told the blond. “As long as it isn’t meat, than it is fine.” He confirmed, moving to the table and looking inside different containers. He froze when he heard a loud bang and a muttered curse from the person halfway inside his stove.
Harry finally removed his arms from Draco's middle, reaching out and taking hold of Draco's wrist. He looked over the puckering flesh of the never healing wound. "You need to stop picking at it." He said, making the blond jerk it back a bit. Harry swallowed. "Sorry.."
birthday, of course we are going to do something. Not only are you of age in the wizarding world, you will be of age in the muggle world as well. You could possibly get a muggle job, if that is the sort of thing you want to do.” She said softly.
Draco’s breath caught at the smell and his chest constructed. He felt dizzy after a bit and spots were forming in front of his eyes. Harry turned to see Draco collapse to his knees. He placed the bottle down, missing the counter. The bottle toppled over spilling over the side of the counter as Harry rushed to the blond’s side.
“What is that?” Pansy asked, staring at it with mild distaste. “It was the plans for Harry’s birthday party, but it’s not going to happen if I can’t figure out some things.” Hermione huffed, opening the folder.
Amidst yells from Molly, “George! Don’t hit your sister!”, and George, “MUM! DID YOU SEE WHAT SHE DID?!”, and Ginny’s sobbing, Harry snuck over to the kitchen fireplace. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder and stepped into the fireplace. Ron smiled, giving him a small wave. “See you soon, maybe..” He told him. “Take care yourself, Mate…”
He leaned forward, placing his head in his hands. He was going to be alone in this muggle hell.. Alone…
Harry woke to loud screaming, scrambling to untangle himself from his soaking sheets. It took a moment for him to realize that the screaming had actually come from himself and no one else. He sat up slowly, his breathing fast and shallow. He wiped the sweat from his forehead, feeling that the wetness  had soaked into his fringe and probably the rest of his hair completely.  It had been the first time in weeks that he had made it to his bed, nor had drunk himself silly to fall asleep.
Harry stared at him, biting his lip as he thought over what to say as Draco moved to get up. The blond was wearing his clothing again. The shirt that he left at the party and the boxers that he had stolen that day the blond had stayed over.
“Brands aren’t really easy to get rid of, especially ones with dark ink. But it seems like yours is faded a lot so it shouldn’t be too hard.” She opened a large binder, flipping through some pages. She turned the binder around for Draco to see.
“Nothing like that!” She said, her eyes widening as she realized what the other must have thought. “It’s just… It’s about Draco.. Pansy and Ginny are just really really worried about him. And I know that you two have been talking and I was wondering if you knew something or if Ginny had talked to you.” She explained.
Harry nodded, understanding. “Just put some antiseptic on it and it should be fine.” He said, taking the rag off and letting the other go.
“Oh..” She said, nodding. “It’ll be alright, Draco. Just another six months. It will go by so fast and then we can go back home.” She assured him. He choked on his drink, eyes wide as he stared at her. “Six more months? But it was only six months’ probation. We only had two months left.” He all but yelled at her.
“Harry knows more than he lets on, just so you know. You really don’t have to work that hard to make him really acknowledge what you want him to. A soft nudge in the right direction should do it. By the way that everything just went down, that was more of a violent shove.” Ginny laughed.
“Yeah..” He nodded as Ron hurried over to him. “Mate! We are going back!” He said a large grin on his face.
“Hermione, what are we doing at Malfoy’s place?” Harry asked her. She just gave a devious looking smile before moving to the door and opening it. “Malfoy offered to have your party here because I can’t find a venue. Come on.” She said, pulling him through the threshold. They walked out back to find music playing loudly. Harry smiled at that. “Nirvana.” He said, looking around at everyone. “I know. Pansy was able to get a cover band for them!” Hermione said excitedly. “They will be playing in a bit after food.”
"No, but it's alright. I've faced worst." Draco said, his head held up high. Harry looked him over, biting his lip. The plan that he and Pansy had made was rolling around in his head. He was to take any and all spotlight off of Draco, to make it easier for the other. Then he was going to, as Pansy put it, 'own that shit.'
“You think you are the only one that has it bad? You got off pretty easy in the aftermath.” Harry continued.
“What is it?” Hermione asked hesitantly, not sure if she liked where this was going. “Oh, don’t give me that look Granger. It has nothing to do with Ginny.” She scoffed. Hermione relaxed a bit at that. “So what is it?” She asked.
She stood there for a moment before running over to him. “Darling…” She whispered, kneeling down and drying him off. Draco sat there still just staring at nothing and everything. It was like he wasn’t aware of anything happening to him and this scared her more than anything else in the world.
They had been hanging out with Chris for a month when it happened. Draco had been sharing a cigarette with him outside after his show, talking about just random things as Pansy just fluttered around, drunk. Chris stubbed the cigarette out and leaned close kissing Draco’s lips lightly. Draco reacted immediately, pushing him away gently. “Chris...”
“I’m not being your beard again.” She frowned at him. “It took me almost 8 years to get you out of the closet finally, you are not going back in.”
Had everyone else known? Remus had said Sirius had been his fiancée, so did that mean everyone in the order had known? Everyone had conveniently just left out this little detail from him. Also the little detail that Remus was forbidden to see him. Who forbid him? He had always wondered why Remus had never contacted him while he was at the Dursleys. Had they forbid him? Or was it Dumbledore?
’ before she pointedly looked away. Her attention was brought back to the table when Hermione plopped a large folder down in between them.
“I use to stare at him because I never saw someone so broken before in my life. But every time Dora came around, his face just lit up. It was like watching time rewind itself and all the broken pieces that had been Remus were put back together again. My daughter did that.” She paused. “I saw that loving devotion that he had for my cousin slowly shift towards my daughter. He looked at her like she was the sun and the stars. Like she was the most perfect thing in the world. And I knew at that moment that he deserved her. That Dora couldn’t find a better man then Remus Lupin, because I watched a completely broken man be pieced back together slowly. He appreciated and almost irrevocably worshipped her.”
He didn’t return home until really late that night. He had stopped by a shop and picked up some food, realizing he really hadn’t eaten anything in the last few days. He was walking home when he came across a real shady looking shop that was selling large quantities of muggle liquors and beers. He had never really tried anything before so he stepped inside. The shop keep was very helpful in finding him something to try and didn’t check any identification when he rang up the lot. He gave Harry a knowing smile before waving him off.
“Of course.” Harry gave her a smile. She rolled her eyes before taking a long sip of her drink. “ A little bit after the battle, maybe a few weeks after.” She said, resting her cheek on her hand as if bored. “I ran into her at this takeaway restaurant. We got into a row and then after getting kicked out by a tiny Korean man yelling ‘I’m kick your ass,’ we saw how stupid it was and worked some things out.”
Draco smirked. “Oh a date.” He laughed and she smiled, reaching over and giving him a hug. “Don’t you ever fucking do that to me again.”
After breakfast, Draco got dressed to go home. Which really just consisted of Draco stealing some jeans from Harry. “You know you can stay?” Harry told him as he stood at the front door.
“Draco might kill me.” Ginny said, pecking her lips once more before moving to the window and down the garden trellis.
Draco stared at him, confused for a bit before he shook his hand out. “Your stupid face is just a very large target.”
"What am I inking you with today?" Chris asked him, looking Harry over as the other did the same. Chris was a few inches taller, only because of his boots. They had the same black hair, Chris's was a little shaggier. They both had green eyes, though Chris was covered in piercings and tattoos, and all Harry had going for him was glasses and scars.
"But nothing, Ginny. He doesn’t like me like that. He can barely stand me. Every time we talk he always wants to walk away. Even when I kissed him, he was trying to pull away. It's like every time he doesn't want to be near me." He sighed, rubbing his eyes underneath his glasses. "It's just better if we are just a semblance of friends."
Harry woke a little after Draco had fallen back to sleep. He grabbed his glasses, putting them on and staring down at the blond. He gave a slight smile, pushing his bangs back off his forehead, his fingers lingering there before he carefully detangled himself from the sheets and him. He covered him up again, making sure he was alright before leaving reluctantly. He might not have to worry about being hexed but Malfoy did have a damn good right hook. His face was still throbbing from last night. Probably not the best way he could have handled it, but it worked.
“Has Ginny talked to you?” She asked him, biting her lip as he walked over to him. She looked a little worried and slightly scared. For a moment Harry had a flashback to when they decided to go back to Hogwarts before the Battle. He felt his chest tighten and he couldn’t breathe.
“Mrs. Malfoy, morning.” Pansy said sleepily, sitting up and stretching. “Draco is still at Andromeda’s I think, but he should be home soon.” She assured her. Ginny froze, hunching underneath the bed and the wall, trying not to even breathe.
Draco was agitated, leaning close to Chris on the side of the stage as the others set up when Pansy, Ginny and Hermione walked in.
“It’s really nothing Pansy.” She told her with a smirk. “Come on, I’ll make some lunch.” She pulled her into the kitchen, sitting her on the counter.
“Oh Harry! Perfect!” She smiled at him, dusting herself off. She had on a pair of blue jeans with a flannel shirt on over a grey tank top. He smiled at her, shrugging off his jacket before walking over. “What are you going to do with it?” He asked her, pointing to the motorbike. “I was going to see if you wanted it.” She told him, looking it over. “I’m sure you can fix it up, give you something to do, other than destroying my aunt’s house for the greater good.” She winked at him.
“Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine, I'm leaving my life in your hands. People say I'm crazy and that I am blind, risking it all in a glance.” Draco sang softly, his voice strong and carrying over the music coming from the telly.  He was still in Harry’s shirt and the sitting room was a bit of a cluttered mess. There were a few discarded food containers on the coffee table and an almost completed Jane Austen novel open next to the couch.
He finally made it to the French restaurant, grabbing the soup and the bread like Pansy had told him before making it back to his house. He took the floo back to Andromeda’s. He didn’t know what he was going to do or say. He didn’t even know how to approach the subject. He just knew he needed to do
Ginny rolled her eyes as the sorting started, reaching down underneath the table and taking Pansy's hand in her own. Pansy squeezed it tightly.
“We live in a muggle community Father. It’s best to blend in and not give cause for the Ministry to punish us more.” He recited, helping Pansy plate the various food items.
“Be careful.” He told her, saying goodbye before hanging up. Harry locked his phone, placing it on the table as he laid back, shifting a bit and pulling Draco closer to him. He closed his eyes falling into sort of a sound sleep.
Harry’s jaw tightened unconsciously at the memory. He didn’t want to talk about this.  It had been  almost three weeks since the…. Battle of Hogwarts… He had chosen to stay at the Burrow, which he regretted whole heartedly. He felt he was suffocating… There were too many people, the house was too big… It was too loud and people were always in his face and… touching…
The blond sat down carefully in the open seat next to the window and closed his eyes. Been on the train for all of fifteen minutes and it was already starting. Must be a new record, he joked. Harry grew silent as his attention shifted to Draco, raising an eyebrow in concern. Draco shook his head before curling up in his corner and tried to rest. Maybe some sleep would ease some of the pain in his ribs, also he wouldn't be intruding on their little gang.
"Yes, I have your wand with mine. Nothing is going to happen to it." Harry assured him before  lugging the trunk out of the room to line it up with his own and Pansy's.
She leaned in, kissing his cheek. “I’m only an Owl away and you have Andy and..” She trailed off, looking over at Draco. The blond shifted, glaring at her while Harry had his back to him.
"Stop fucking moving. You're making my lines crooked." Chris reprimanded around his unlit cigarette as Harry hissed in pain, squirming. "Stop being such a pussy, take it like a man. We are almost finished."
Everyone looked to see none other than Harry Potter rushing up towards the stand. He looked horrid and thin, like he hadn’t slept or eaten in the last few days since the battle. He was still scuffed up and bruised, moving a bit gingerly on one leg as he walked.
“So what brought this row on?” Harry asked, motioning to Ginny and Ron. “I assume it must have been something that happened at your party. Sorry for not being there by the way. I heard that it was quite interesting.” He smirked.
“Two weeks, maybe. She didn’t really give me a definite time.” He sighed, smiling at her softly. “Thank you.” He whispered softly. “I didn’t know who else to turn to.”
Draco rolled his eyes but got up and moved back into this room. Harry waited on the balcony until he came back, holding a large hoodie and a worn snapback. “Thank you.” He said pulling both on. He moved over the railing before making his way down the trellis again.
. And you must have me or an Auror escort you to Kings Cross.” He finished, rubbing his eyes under this glasses from exhaustion.
“Stupid Potter.” He shook his head. “I just tired of being here with them…” He said, talking about his parents. “At least when I went to Hogwarts I had a break..” He whispered. He sat there for a moment before flinging himself backwards onto the bed, letting out a frustrated sigh. “How did my life get so fucked?” He asked her.
“Yeah, a headache. Probably brought on by stress or exhaustion.” Draco told him, soothing the tension away.
It didn’t hurt at all really, just an annoying repetitive picking feeling. Chris at one point laughed at how bored Draco looked, impressed. Chris was nice to look at, longish dark hair, green eyes, piercings and tattoos.
He let out a scream, gripping his hair tightly, pulling it down in frustration as if it could block out the images. It was as if all the feelings that he had suppressing with the alcohol had come racing back with a vengeance.
“You’re a good girlfriend.” He told her, motioning to Pansy with his cup. He knew the only reason she hadn’t was because of Pansy. The dark headed woman looked up and between the two as Ginny blushed.
“This address is where you are going to have the party. I will help decorate. There is a pool out back, so make sure you tell everyone. Just give me the date and time.” She said, jotting down something on the paper before shoving it back to Granger.
“Tell me about it.” Draco muttered under his breath, looking away but Andromeda caught it and smiled to herself.
Draco nodded. “First of all, what are you doing? And secondly, what are you watching? And thirdly, what time is it?”
“You are…” Pansy started but was left speechless. Harry smiled. “It was nothing really. More irritation than anything else really.” He shrugged. Pansy gave him a smirk before kissing Draco’s cheek and moving to the door. She paused next to Harry before quickly leaning in and kissing his cheek before going to her own room.
Draco moved to him, snatching the letter from Harry’s hand and tearing it open. “You are fucking insane.” He said, reading over it before turning to Harry in complete shock. Harry grinned widely. “So I’ve been told.” He shifted a bit as Pansy bolted over the bed to look at the letter with Draco. “This is amazing.” She said, looking up at Harry.
He rolled his eyes. “Fine, I won’t freak out.” He settled down in the chair. “I need to meet this girlfriend of yours with all the muggle knowledge.”
“Did I do it right? I followed the instructions Pansy left me.” She said, hopefully. Draco gave her a small smile. “It’s fine Mother.” He answered her, his voice flat.
"Hestia Jones. I'm your new Defense against the Dark Arts professor." She told him. "See you in class later." And with that she hurried off towards the high table.
“It’s sort of a culture shock.” She went on, motioning for the boy to drink his tea. “First things first. Is your friend, Pansy was it? Is she alright?” She asked him still in the same soft voice. He reminded her of how Harry was the first time that he had visited her. Shaky, jumpy at every little thing. Uneasy and uncomfortable with the unfamiliar surroundings. Hermione was right about those two.
“I’M GOING TO DROWN YOU, YOU LITTLE SHIT!” Draco screamed, shoving Harry underwater again. At this Ron and  Dean hurried over to the side of the pool. They froze next to Chris when Harry resurfaced, laughing hysterically. Draco held him up with his arm around his throat. Harry just let out the most honest and wholesome sounding laughter anyone had heard from him.
"Like how your father is an abusive arsehole and is still not in prison." Harry shot back, locking his trunk up before glancing at Draco.
“Zach, it’s fine, I’ve got it.” He said, popping out of his hiding spot as Draco rounded on the other.
Dean and Seamus were arguing about what to get while Ginny smirked at them. “So Harry, how are you feeling? You left the party pretty early and really pissed.” Seamus laughed.
Draco. You’re busy revising at the moment, making dozens of neatly quilled notes about the fifty most common ingredients used in healing magic and I’ve been glancing in your direction for the last ten minutes. You’re steadfastly ignoring me, though I know you’re aware of me looking. Don’t worry. I won’t disturb you too much.
Onward to your lavatory encounter. Haughty stares, pointy face, thinking too highly of himself to engage with the common people? It’s not exactly unobtrusive who you’re referring to. And honestly, who would judge you for walking away? Whyever would I judge you? A proper beating serves him just right. I bet Malfoy would’ve hexed you, had you tried to help. It’s not worth the effort of a single spell or your time. Why is he even back in Hogwarts? Do you have any idea?
You laughed. “This bed is ridiculously peaceful. It’s so silent here… All those school noises. Other boys snoring. Slammed doors. The Squid, tapping against the common room windows… Bloody hell, Harry. I could sleep for a week.”
Public feeling against witches and wizards that were known associates of He Who Shall Not Be Named is still exceedingly negative, whatever their personal circumstances might be now, or in the past. Therefore, I doubt the Wizengamot will countenance this course of action. I do not wish to challenge the facts of the conviction, as I believe this will be a fruitless endeavour.
Tomorrow we shall – if we really must – revise the Transfiguration of complex, animate objects (and no, we WON’T practice on house spiders) and the effects of different brew times on Wiggentree bark. It’ll be a very quiet, very serene day, and we’ll break only to eat, have extended (and very fervent) making-out sessions, and explore this cavernous and very magical house.
At one point, I aimed a Tickling Hex at your delicate neck and was pleased to find that it didn’t miss. I took my time to avenge your dominance, love. I watched you clasp your neck, laughing and wiggling, before I cast a Petrificus Totalus and a Cushioning Charm for you to land on. Then I swaggered over to you, straddling your bound lap and leaned down to press a kiss on your lips before I casted the Finite Incantatem.
I’m sorry, I know it’s technically your turn, but you couldn’t actually think that I’d leave you with just those few, largely jumbled words from last night?
The second thing is that I’m very sorry for what you must’ve been through right after the war. You were obviously in no state to be interviewed. You should’ve been left alone to have some time to start healing. It sounds like you’ve been in a daze.
You’re having a little nap, darling, and I can hardly look away. You’re looking so very peaceful and exhausted. You also forgot to take off your spectacles. Which I should fix before you hurt yourself, Potter.
Merlin, but you were so sensitive tonight and I wanted to take such good care of you. You managed a few words – an exultation to Salazar, perhaps, breathless words spilling from your mouth – and you were definitely enjoying yourself. After only a few nibbles and licks your chest was hard and peaked, but I wasn’t willing to let you go quite yet.
Thank Merlin that it’s finally the weekend, and a Hogsmeade one at that. This’ll be our first proper date outside of school together and I’m excited, love, I honestly am. Of course, my personal preference would be to stay here, huddle beneath my dad’s cloak and make our way back to the Prefect’s Bathroom, but sometimes needs must, and Hermione has promised to buy us lunch in The Three Broomsticks.
That we’re both on our respective beds, wrapped in the afterglow of our mutual orgasms is a fantastic sensation. I feel very close to you right now, like you could be here beside me.
Sorry, the above paragraph makes me sound like a right git, but I’ve had a good bit to do with Harry over the years. He’s a good person – at least he believes his heart is in the right place – but he isn’t anything like you might imagine. I don’t think that Potter is the big hero that the world wants him to be. He’s a bit boring really, a bit nondescript? It’s as if he spent so much time playing the boy hero that he forgot to grow up.
headlines, or anything else really. He went on, though, “I mean- I do know that you two were in… relations. But it wasn’t as one-sided as the media had made it sound. You two were…”
So please, please, don’t go off writing letters and asking people about nefarious pure-bloods in France. I can’t imagine it would help.
I’m grinning from ear to ear. Just talking to you makes me happy. Speaking of families, I loved reading about your mother and father when they were younger. I could drink in such tales all day long.
I hate the position Mother has put me in. Thanks to her I’m doing exactly what everyone has been thinking all along. It’s exactly like both Auror Atkinson and this bloody Jefferson say: I’m a vampire. A Malfoy using his relations to famous wixen for his own good.
Firstly: nobody ended up attending the Hospital Wing having got embroiled in a fist fight. Secondly: no wands were drawn, and before you ask, love, no, I was never involved in any of those escapades. Well, yes, once I flung a Jelly-Brain Jinx, but that was only to defend Ron, swear it to Merlin. What can I say? Some of those hot-headed, impetuous Gryffindor stereotypes are a bit true, despite what I wrote so lyrically in my last reply to you, and a lot of us do love our Quidditch teams to a rather unhealthy degree.
Good Circe, listen to me! I must admit that I took a quick break to read the Shakespeare Sonnet that I once wrote into our diary, checking how much is involuntarily inspired by our most sentimental wizard. Well, a great deal. But I used my own words and thoughts, I swear to Merlin.
Now this wizard? He is quite a lot older than us and as straight as a wand. I still see him every so often. The first time I saw him, I thought he looked exactly like a Muggle rock star! Thinking back, I was so easily impressed. I thought he was the coolest person that I’d ever seen. I mean, thinking back now, he might have been a bit clichéd. He wore the whole dragon-hide boots-and-earrings-with-a-fang-dangling-from-it ensemble. The whole rough, wild wizard look. Whenever we met up, I always got so tongue-tied, and I used to flush every bit as red as a beetroot.
You and I need to dedicate serious time and energy into researching the matter, my darling. Many, many hours of pleasure. It could be of great benefit to the wizarding world if I were able to bottle this feeling.
"Wait," I said before really making up my mind about what to say. I blame your Gryffindorish influence on such impulsive behaviour I observed in myself recently, Harry. But anyways, I couldn't in good conscience let such an opportunity pass. So I asked him to talk for another minute, guiding him to this small passage near the library where we could converse tête-á-tête.
Maybe that’s part of the fun of being gay, as would seem that I'm discovering I am. Other boys aren’t a mystery to me. I understand what will feel brilliant for you and how your prick feels when it's heavy and full. I understand the sensation of an orgasm, and how it feels like you’re tipping over the edge of a precipice and suddenly the ground isn’t there anymore.
I took it as a warning; that she thought me naïve to fall in love like we did, Harry. But I recall her own smile now. How she smiled before she said that, and how it faded. How fragile she looked after that. My thoughts were with Father just now, but it was about me, Harry. She loves me so and I must’ve done everything wrong. I let her down. I let her down because I couldn’t stick to my own fucking rules to not get myself in trouble. And now she’s gone.
I canted my pelvis against yours, desperately yearning for the friction of your body against my prick. You must have noticed my needy little thrusts, because you dropped your hands to my hips, and you pulled me hard into you. Without warning you were driving our erections together. Darling, I saw stars.
We went to the lavatories together, and luckily there was hardly anyone else there. I wish I could’ve shown you the charms and prettied you up myself, but this darned magic restriction… Anyhow. I told you what to do with your hair, you charmed mine, I fixed your tie (seriously – if you don’t get the knot right, don’t just keep going but start anew!) and our kiss was so warm and so chaste.
Back to less worldly matters. Draco, did you really write: ‘Don’t forget to wear your ring’? My darling boy, when exactly have you seen me without my ring since I was given it? The only time that you ever see me without it is in Potions, and then I wear it on a chain around my neck with an unbreakable lock. Not only is it my sign to the world that you are mine and I yours, but it also keeps my magic in check. Not having to think or worry about it surging has been the most incredible gift, and one that I’m grateful for every single day. I didn’t know how anxious I was until suddenly I wasn’t.
Don’t talk to Dean – I saw exactly how much he wants a piece of his “best friend”. Do find out what Seamus thinks. Only then can we know whether there’s a chance to set them up or not. And to get Seamus talking – just fuel your inner Slytherin. Make something up. Tell him how it started between us and how much it stung when I once called you my mate or something like that.
I know, you’re rolling your eyes at my lack of originality, but the words were so perfect. “I’m in a committed relationship with a wizard” were the first words out of my mouth after Edward’s gran had served me a slice of Shepherd’s pie, and I honestly thought the lovely dear would keel over in astonishment.
It’s a heady, wonderful thought and I’ve got Wrackspurts in my belly just thinking about everything that might entail. Oh, Draco, I do so love you, and I’m so ready to show that love to you in every way possible.
I’m a snake, Harry. Through and through. I’m a coward with a proclivity for unjustified self-importance. I preen in admiration. With your words, throughout this whole diary, but especially in your last two letters, you had my head in the stars. But don’t you see that everything that binds me to this earth is doomed?
I lay down on top of you after a while. I didn’t plan that or anything, but – properly lubed as we both were – my prick went between your thighs, right below your balls, and I couldn’t resist. Circe, now that I write this down, I feel like an idiot. But I humped the heat between your legs, my darling boy, and I’m (almost) unashamed that I did. It felt glorious. All I could think about was that it must be so close to fucking you for real.
“Everything looks yummy,” I complimented, leaning over to kiss the tickly part of your throat. I could have gotten distracted there – you, after all, are rather delicious yourself – but you coughed discreetly. “And yes, the breakfast looks good too.”
“Ah yes,” Robards answered. “Mr Malfoy is going to live here too. That’s why Atkinson and Waters have asked me over here today. You’ve deigned to ask Draco Malfoy,” he said, squinting in your direction, “a criminal currently under severe Wizengamot probation, to be your tenant, is that correct? Decided to offer him a roof and shelter? That’s a fine altruistic attitude that you’ve got there. Otherwise, I’m not sure where Mr Malfoy would have ended up after Hogwarts, though I’m sure we could have offered him lodgings with his father. It’s not too late to take us up on that offer.”
Don’t forget that: you’re going to bond with a Malfoy, Harry. If there’s one thing I know, it’s how to get what I want.
You took a deep breath, squeezing my hand, before you went on. “It’s good for Teddy though. Practising his abilities as a Metamorphmagus is the same as practising magic – he will hardly have any magical outbursts which will save Andi a lot of trouble, I suppose.”
This, along with repeated incantations by the guests all the while, is necessary for mingling the blood and the magic of the bonded couple. Wards, magicked heirlooms, all the house magic – it will only react to you if you’re related by blood or by bonding. Also, scions might end up being a stranger to their own magical house, should you refrain from proper bonding. Traditional, arcane magic might not accept heirs who don’t have the needed magical signature in them.
Could you feel my hard prick rubbing against your leg? I'm sorry if I was blatant. All I need to do is watch you, Draco, and that part of my anatomy immediately decides it is playtime. That’s the effect that you have on me, darling.
As for your probation: I know there’s a lot of regulations, but I promise that nobody is looking to try and drop anyone else in it. There just isn’t the appetite for it, at least not amongst anyone that I know. Take our old friend Draco Malfoy for an example. You surely can’t have regulations hanging over your head that are as demanding or harsh as his, yet nobody is out to make his life harder than it already is. Indeed, I’ve seen an acquaintance of mine (Luna Lovegood?) palling about with him during the last few weeks. I know the Ministry has a bit of a shitty reputation, but I don’t think even they want to send anyone else to Azkaban. I know it’s easier said than done, but please, please don’t worry.
I have some cuffs that would go very well with it if you’re not opposed to wearing something the colour of your eyes. Don’t worry, they are very subdued, nothing sparkly or anything. Just silver and a very fine line of crystals around polished malachite.
Maybe I should take your advice and become a Mind Healer when I leave school. I could dole out psychobabble (that’s a Muggle term, by the way) with the best of them. With that fact in mind, I’m going to give you some advice and tell you a bit of a secret.
Sorry, that I answer only now – you probably wondered why I didn’t mention your proposition when we ate lunch together. But my day has been so busy. I hate days without free periods – however did we manage to get through the first few years of school when there wasn’t even such a thing?
The life you’ve saved would have been spent in Azkaban without your testimony. They were debating imprisoning me for at least one year, but Shacklebolt kept citing your words and insisted that they should trust Harry Potter’s opinion on his classmate, especially given our well-known animosity.
Truth is, if I didn’t adore every single hair on your head, my oft-broken nose would be thoroughly out of joint. Andi and Teddy absolutely adored you, Draco, and have officially adopted you as my other half.
I have a hairy chest, thighs and a dark trail that leads from belly button all the way to my pubic hair. I tried charming it all away once, but it all grew back the very next day, twice as thick and every bit as stubborn. I think it might be here to stay.
Sounds like your lot is a bunch of overprotective Hufflepuffs. Look, I’m not a reliable source when it comes to friendships. Used to have some allegiances but I’m on my own now. What I do know is that I’d be fucking furious if they’d been meddling with my school business and career choices. You said you ran away like a petulant first year but I get your point. I don’t know who thought we’d come back and be able to put up with school in the first place. I’m so bloody sick of this cursed castle and the professors speaking about our N.E.W.T.s and all the rejoicing Hogwarts students waltzing about the halls and preaching inter-house unity. And don’t even get me started on these bloody dormitories. Is it too much to ask for some peace and quiet in the common room I’ve known for years? Everything is so fucking fraught with friction and misjudgement and memories. Must they pen us in like this?
It’s funny: I can see a few parallels between your mother and Edward’s gran. When she arrived home, she announced, “you’re obviously writing to your young man,” and she smiled all the time she was saying it. I answered, “but of course, what gave me away?" and you’ll never guess what she said in reply?
Thanks for telling me about all these dreadful memories. We both know that it isn’t easy to think back to them, let alone write about it in detail. I won’t go through your reply in meticulous detail, but please be sure that I won’t forget one word you wrote to me yesterday. Not one. I shall remember them as the truth about a part of wizarding history that you and I lived through.
Deciphering these lines is practically the ultimate test to understanding stilted pureblood small talk. Will you pass, my darling fiancé?
That comes to just a little bit over fifty Galleons to be spent when we get to Diagon Alley, and then we’ll need to spend about the same again on the two owls that we’re planning to buy and take back to Hogwarts with us. While we’re there we’ll be able to avail ourselves of their Owlery, but we’ll need to allocate another five or so Galleons on equipment so that they don’t get bored. I won't be one of those owners that keeps owls locked up every hour of the day. I’ve still got a few bits from Hedwig that we can put to use, like my travel crate, but we’ll likely need another one of those.
So, I’ve been to eleven weddings that I can recall. In contrast to the Malfoy line, purebloods usually make sure that there are a bunch of children to continue their house, so basically every summer one or the other huge bonding ceremony takes place.
Telling fibs? I’ll try that with my Mind Healer. They usually don’t ask many questions, so I’m going to blurt out some story and see what they’ll do about that. This may be the first time that I’m looking forward to my next session. Will be reporting back how things went.
I showed you to which point I wanted to get my revision done, and you tried picking up a book, but we both knew that it was wasted effort, didn’t we?
I felt the slide of your hands over my side, and the feel of your fingers lightly squeezing my bum. My cock was heavy in my hand, and I wanked it slowly, casually. I didn’t want to orgasm yet, and I knew that a firm squeeze would have tipped me much too quickly over the edge. The desire coursing through my belly could so easily have exploded into a
As for all your critique of my various table manners: I’m afraid that I’m rather a slow learner. You’ll have to keep murmuring instructions into my ear when we’re eating at the Minister’s side. If you wanted to murmur other, more private things then I wouldn’t be averse to that either. I wonder if your Slytherin tongue is quick enough to make me blush. There’s a wager for you, Draco. Dare you to accept it.
As you can imagine, it’s wonderfully picturesque. The North Sea, the houses, the abbey – wherever you look, there’s wild beauty.
You’re sleeping now, fast asleep on the settee. I’m writing quietly, my quill gliding over the parchment. I won’t wake you, Draco. You look peaceful, your blond hair curling over your ears. You think it needs a cut, but it doesn’t, not really. I’m fond of it longer because I can run my fingers through it and feel the silky strands between my fingertips. We can certainly get it cut when we go to Diagon if you wish, though.
“It’s good that you talk about it so openly,” the Healer answered. “It hasn’t always been like that when you’ve been talking to me.” He must’ve seen that I didn’t like the praise, for he went on rather quickly. “That’s a lot to address at once. Now, you’ve mentioned several times that you don’t feel like you should feel.”
There was one moment I could have ruined everything. Maybe even something as dramatic as the outcome of the war, to be truthful. Doing nothing was the perfect choice at that moment and I gladly tell you, that it’s one of my proudest memories. I know that I’m not very heroic. But I did the right thing for once.
I didn’t say much then. I’m sorry, but I couldn’t speak although my thoughts were racing. You filled the silence, saying: “She loves you, Draco. She’s put herself at dire risk – she had no way of knowing whether they’d throw her into Azkaban or not! She’d do anything for you. And Narcissa even seems to accept us, love. Of course – her original intentions with the ring were a bit iffy, but in the end, she put your happiness above all. That’s all that matters.”
We stayed in tents right in the wild nature of the mountains there. Granted: I hated it at first. That’s usually not my kind of thing. But the reason you travel that region (yes, we’re finally getting there, patience is key) is the night sky. The photo pollution induced by these Muggle lights as bright as a Lumos Maxima is usually taking away so much of it. I mean, we are lucky in Hogwarts too. Stargazing is no problem here at all.
Now that I’m free of the spell, my cortex has burst into its full torrent of power, but it has never learnt to naturally control itself in the way that any wix normally does as a matter of course during their puberty. So, exposure to big crowds, powerful spells and even some strong emotions get potent magic thrumming through my bloodstream in minutes.
And yes, look at you. I’m proud again that I’m meddling in your likes. We’ll make you a suave and well-read gentleman in no time. Which might be a rather promising endeavour on your love-seeking quest. As a courtesy, I’ll ignore this little slur of yours; there is most certainly not the slightest connection between having a favourite poet and being sorted a Hufflepuffian.
“Well, Lord Malfoy would be my father, at least until he’d resign his peerage to me, I suppose.” I told you more about titles and all that, and you remarked that I obviously wasn’t kidding when I said that there was a rule for everything.
Darling. I think that I need to draw this letter to a close. My eyes are fluttering closed, and exhaustion is creeping through my limbs. My experience within the Druid circle is catching up with me as is Edward’s company. Babies are terribly soporific: a couple of hours in his company and you’d never need a Sleeping Draught again.
He didn’t take much time to deliberate over your Sorting, did he? It’s a pity. You’d have made an excellent Hufflepuff: determined, practical, and tenacious, plus the yellow would have brought out the colour of your hair handsomely. Merlin. Was I really sitting there for ages, that sardonic, sarcastic rag sat on my head? I’ve seen several hatstalls occur during the years since, but I never realised I’d actually been one. The whole experience is a bit of a blur now.
Harry, I just read the Sunday evening edition of yesterday’s Prophet. They talked about us again. Well, they rather denounced Lulu.
I want to thank you for the photograph, your foolish hopefulness, and your self-destructive persistence. But you are falling in love with someone who doesn’t exist while deserving everything you’re dreaming of.
I’d research a very accurate horoscope for you though. I’d take the time to observe the luminaries very closely and then give some good thought at it. I’d tell you all the nice things about your personality and warn you just in time about your bad omens and how to avoid them. You’d never have bad luck again in your life with me as your personal seer.
But I digress. Salazar, I wanted to tell you about the photo albums. After Glynis’s family retreated to their rooms – nephew still fuming, his wife a little thin-lipped like she didn’t know whether she should support her husband or feel ashamed of his outburst – Glynis, Mother and I came together in one of the sitting rooms. One good-natured rant on Glynis’s side and a few brandies for the three of us later, Glynis and Mother were back to their stories of the late sixties and seventies and told me a bit about their youth and adolescent years. Then she fetched the old pictures to add some visual accompaniment to their anecdotes – yes, we’re finally there, chéri.
Circe, I’m so relieved now. That she showed up. She must be well enough if she’s in custody and not in St Mungo’s. I just can’t quite know what this is about. But shit, she’s in custody of bloody Aurors right now… This can’t be good.
You moved to sit on my lap, and your hands found my cock underwater. Merlin, I thought about the lube you gifted me… What it would feel like to have you in my lap while fucking you, my prick buried deep inside of your perfect arse.
Hearing about your concerns made me realise that I have no idea about bonding or weddings apart from traditional pureblood ceremonies.
Fuck, I’m not sure whether we’d be so straightforward in real life, but I can’t get this out of my head, especially not while my legs spread further, and my cock is leaking. I want you inside me. I have no idea what that would feel like but when I’m thinking about us in bed together, I simply know that I couldn’t be close enough to you, darling. And just right here and now, I wish you’d take me and claim me. Make me yours completely.
Then, after their papa had left the room, the three of them would stay awake for what seemed like hours to her, convinced the ghost of Great Uncle Ally would come back to collect their hearts for his breakfast. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, love! It sounds as if this story of yours is naught but a wizarding urban legend, told in many families. It's a pity: I was looking forward to chomping down in a great pile of raw meat in the Great Hall each morning, much like one of Hagrid’s Thestrals.
Alright. I’ll start us off. I’m going to bite the bezoar and tell you an ice breaker. Something embarrassing. Something I've never told anyone.
Merlin, this letter is dreadful, my love. First you listen to me, ranting about table etiquette, then I’m boring you with my family tree. To cut a long story short: there aren’t as many ties as you might expect. When it comes down to it, there’s me and Mother.
I know that other wizards have intricate fictions that they play out in their heads. A friend told me his own once, when he’d drank a few too many Butterbeers at the Three Broomsticks. It was some long, complicated story that involved his girlfriend Transfiguring her appearance into some Muggle film star. To each their own, I suppose, but the whole thing left me cold. I want to look into the face of the person that I was sharing my fantasy with.
That’s true, Draco. Both you and Nott have lost your childhood homes, and everything that you knew and believed would be forever. This is me guessing – and I might be very far off-base here – but I do wonder if falling in love this year and all the plans we have made for the future have shielded you from this traumatic event?
Hermione squinted her eyes at me. “What do you mean, ‘apparently’? What does your verdict say?” I muttered something in response, repeated my words before, which chagrined Hermione further. “Draco, I mean, what does it say word-for-word?”
So, yes: as a young lad, I was quite the Harry Potter fanboy and I’ve been to Godric’s Hollow to see the statue, the Potter grave, and the home in which it all happened. I wish I had actually coaxed my tutor into allowing me to add to the graffiti adorning the wall of your parents’ cottage. Imagine how funny that would’ve been to see the child scribble of your soon-to-be-husband there, telling you how cool you are before spending the next decade on opposing ends of a war before ending up in an unhoped-for Trauma Recovery Programme together?
It’s probably all for the best, Draco. There wouldn’t have been room for two mastersofthesnitch in the Slytherin Quidditch team. Mm. I think I would rather have enjoyed riding one of those Nimbus 2001’s that Lucius so generously gifted. I would have swooped down and given you a wave, Draco, swear it to Merlin. I heard that those subs benches were pretty comfortable.
“Did it occur to you that such a reaction precisely sounds like the definition of a ‘prize prick’?” He opened his mouth to protest, but I wasn’t done yet. “You’re going to be the husband of one of the smartest wixen of our time – who happens to be a witch. Don’t you think that she – or Harry, when you talked to him about it – would get the idea that you’re a bit sexist, trying to keep Hermione on a short leash?”
Alright, yes, roommates. They are quite a nuisance, aren’t they? Mine were starting to make fun of each other every time someone closed their curtains. And I was far too proud to let anything on. So I became quite masterful at wanking in slow strokes and complete and utter silence. I think I’ve even done it with the lights on once or twice which sounds awfully needy and embarrassing now that I think of it. But well, my randy self couldn’t be helped, I assume. Not that I’d do anything like this today. The last few years got me way too anxious for that and I already told you that I haven’t been aroused at all lately.
Then there are standards that the laboratory must meet, even if it’s not a high-end professional Potion master’s lab. There’s this little pamphlet Slughorn gave me. It’s published by the British Wizarding Committee for Potion Standardisation, Health and Safety and in it are all the requirements for different types of labs and potions.
Please know that I’m not entirely fluent in French (even though I always desperately wished I had grown up bilingual). But I’m a decent enough speaker. I definitely know my way around and I’d order you every ice cream there is. Oh, and pastries. You’d love mille-feuille. Perhaps you know it as a custard slice or a Napoleon around here. But this type of pastry is made so much more delicately in France. It feels like diving into a cloud with your fork. I wish I could bypass Gamp’s Law, just to conjure a slice for you.
As far as I know, it’s just a signature and a background check. But I highly doubt that anyone from the Ministry will administer a background check on Harry Potter. So, yes – how does it feel to date a criminal? Hold your hippogriffs, Potter. I’m joking. You, saying that I have never been a Death Eater in the first place, warmed my heart. But I’m okay with enduring the consequences anyway.
Your confidence buoyed me, darling, and with that I felt better. I took both of your hands in mine, and sat there just for a moment, pulling together all the loose, rough ends of my magic.
Merlin, this sounds awful. I hope you don’t get this wrong, love. But you must know what I’m trying to say here.
I’m trying it your way, as you can see, trying to speak instead of writing my thoughts down. I’m sitting on my bed, Muffliato applied, of course, and it feels sort of awkward to hear my own voice, but I’ll try.
I wrapped my dressing grown around your shoulders, a fact that I knew you’d complain about when you felt better – it is offensively red and Gryffindor, after all – but I liked the way that you stopped trembling and started to breathe a little more deeply.
It was interesting to hear that you knew Malfoy. I suppose, thinking back, that you must be fairly well acquainted with him. Those pure-blood cliques were small and tight.
Only then did you cover my skin under your warm hand, soothing my overstimulated nerves with a firm touch.
“You’re right about Mother, about her upbringing and her strong feelings on formalities,” I told you. “Although I don’t like the idea that she feels like she can marry me off to the most influential suitor. I know that it’s not true – we fell in love, and we were engaged before – but it makes me feel like a silly boy. I bet she’s in high hopes that I’ll change my surname to yours.”
It was the last line that had the most impact on me, though. I think they had a somewhat tempestuous relationship, didn’t they? Their love wasn’t easy. It was a challenge. They had to work at it. I think Barnfield was really besotted by this prickly, difficult man whom he loved so much he actually wrote poems for him. Imagine what it must be like to experience such romance.
My love. You should be shower-fresh by now and pink with the warmth of the water. I’m going to come to you now, and hold you close for as many minutes as Pomfrey allows me. I cannot see that the witch has any reason not to allow me entrance, as it seems like we are officially betrothed to be bonded when school finishes.
“Yeah,” Seamus said, giving me the first genuine smile that I thought I’d seen from him in ages. “You did look a bit of a tit with that bullshit excuse about the Entrail-Expelling Curse. Where’d you find out about that?”
However, I’ll try to think about some positive things now. As sorry as I am for holding back the truth, I’m sure that I ought to be proud of myself that I told you about my past. And the only reason I did it was because I wanted to be honest with you – no scheming, no abuse of knowledge, no picking the lesser of two evils. I simply wanted you to know about this important part of my past as well as my current life because what I feel for you is far too real and too important to keep such a thing from you. It felt like lying so I had to make amends. And that’s that, I guess.
It isn’t too early to flirt again, is it? I confess, I’ve missed the randier conversations we've shared and yes, sexual revelation was absolutely the right description for our special night. (I can imagine your head swelling as I write the words!) I don’t regret a moment of it and I promise, it isn’t ever far from my imagination.
One of our extern correspondents, a Muggleborn St Mungo’s Healer as well as renowned Muggle medicine expert, explains this phenomenon: “You see, it sounds odd at first glance – a victim becoming fast friends with someone who caused them so much harm. In my psychology sessions – I see it as my duty to help both wixen and Muggles alike – I dealt with several of these cases. The Muggles call it Stockholm Syndrome. A hostage is very likely to bond with their abuser. It might be the only way for poor Ms Lovegood to cope with the horrors she’s been through in the dungeons of the Malfoy family.’
What I scored is actually – out of three options – the best thing I could think of for a proper Valentine’s date. I’m sure we will both enjoy it. I’ll give you one tip, or rather some insider information. You and I will go to a place where I’ve wanked once or twice. And it’s the only semi-public place in the castle that saw me masturbating. I do hope this sounds lewd enough to be enticing for you, love. Perhaps it’ll spark some alluring fantasies that will put your fingers at use tonight, love.
First though: were my amateur dramatics too awful for words during DADA class? That spell that I sent flying in Seamus’s direction wasn’t much more than a loud bang and a bright light – simple stuff from the Grade 1 Standard Book of Spells – but (and you’ll be impressed with me here) I managed it without voicing the incantation.
I’ll start deciphering numbers now. I shall let you know, should I discover anything out of the ordinary concerning our future in the numerical sequences.
We crouched down in front of the crate, just watching them. When, after a while, I turned my head to look at you, though, you were looking at me. “You look happy,” you whispered, probably not willing to share that with Mr Eeylops, attending to his shop somewhere behind our backs. You opened your mouth to speak, but I leaned in for a kiss, lingering for as long as I dared in public.
Salazar, but when you massaged my arsehole? Did you feel how my whole body shuddered with every brush of your fingers? Every nerve ending was sensitive, and so quick to respond to you. Your lewd suggestions are playing on a loop in my mind. I think that you must have been made entirely for my pleasure, Draco, made entirely for my delectation. You say that I looked like an Adonis, or a sex god? Well, I thought you looked like a fallen angel, fell to earth and stripped of their wings.
Anyway, I think we might have looked innocent enough in our robes. The loose fabric is practically designed to cover unintended boners.
Also, while we are on the subject of our burgeoning love affair, please don’t make an apology if you don’t have time to put a quill to paper as often as you’d wish. We are suffering through a ludicrously busy school year in the oddest of circumstances and it isn’t all that easy to find time for as many dates as we’d like. We’ve got forever to be together, Draco, and I’m thrilled that you’ve been spending time with Luna. I did see the two of you say together, your two blond heads tipped towards one another’s. Together, the pair of you are very hard to miss. I would have said hello, but the pair of you looked as thick as thieves and I didn’t like to disturb you.
Punishment, rather than an establishment of true facts for posterity seems to have been the order of the day. It is my hope that once a true deposition of facts is presented, we will be able to reduce the number of years the probation will be in effect for. I also believe that some of the very harsh travel and conduct restrictions might be lessened.”
Circe, you could even ponder whether Ginny and Dean might have another chance (weren’t they a couple before you two fell for each other?) and see how he reacts! Jealousy drives people insane, even over supposed best mates.
Do you know – and I’ve not admitted this on any of our dates – but Ron and ‘Mione used to tease me about you. Obsessed, they would joke. “What’s Malfoy doing today?” they’d both ask, laughing at me. “Styled his hair differently? Five minutes late for dinner? Godric! Ignored you rather than scowling?” My interest – my beguilement – in you really was every bit as forensic as that.
Anyhow, this sounds like it was a very long and horrifying ordeal which it hardly was. It took about half an hour and then he grabbed the Portkey and took me to Whitby.
Okay, before I force my lengthy harangues upon you, just two more things, then I need to see you in person. You won’t get away from more love confessions, even though I take from my aunt’s (!) letter that there are things to discuss that I’m apparently unaware of.
You must excuse my wordy remarks on this. I just think that it’s the most adorable thing ever: you, picking up words I use all the time. Did you ever realise that I managed to not curse ‘Salazar’ when we still wrote anonymously? I only ever heard Slytherins use it, and I thought it would have been suspicious. Now my perfect, Gryffindorish fiancé uses it. I’m enchanted.
Alright then. I have a lighter hair colour for starters. Okay, this is much harder than I expected. I have a set of moles on the inner side of my arm which you can pretty much only see when I lift my arm. They look a little like the head, body and the base of the tail of the Leo constellation if you squint at them.
So yes, that’s that. I hope I didn’t wake you. And I really, honestly hope that you didn’t get the wrong idea. But I’m probably just being paranoid.
Why do people have such a hard time saying 'gay' or even just 'into me'? Well, whatever. I, of course, actually knew more about this than I could let on. I answered, "You will never know if you don't talk to him. You see, you'd be surprised what goes through people's heads. The other day you were asking about the diary for the Recovery Programme and why Harry and I still use it. It's a lot about trying to be honest with each other, telling each other more than sometimes is possible in the momentum of real life. That doesn't mean it's impossible to try to have an honest conversation. It's just harder to say it out loud than to take my quill and share my thoughts with him."
Wiping my wet, sticky lips with your thumb, you offered to return the favour, but I shook my head. Tonight was all for you. Tonight was everything you’d wanted, and I’m the lucky man who got to make it a reality.
It’d be remiss of me not to mention the Hippogriff in the room; that Draco is your kin, and Teddy’s Cousin. Draco told me that he happily – and gratefully – wishes to be considered your family and in this I know he is genuine. Family means the world to my fiancé, and I can guarantee that this isn’t him paying lip service only to be accepted.
As you requested, I’ve left you alone. Walked away. All this week, I’ve just let you be. There’s been not a single look in your direction. No cautious smiles over breakfast and no small gestures of friendship. I haven’t asked Luna once if you’re eating properly or watched to see if you’re distracted in your lessons.
exposed that we’d managed to make ourselves late for dinner – my unpunctual ways are a little contagious! – and so we rushed to The Three Broomsticks where our friends were waiting, sat around a table.
So I stroked down and kept his cock in a firm grip and just started licking his head. But I quickly wanted more of the taste and the scent and Blaise started breathing really hard which encouraged me quite a lot. I remember that my jaw cracked when I opened up and I must’ve been so ridiculously tense in my jaw and my neck, because it all felt kind of stiff when I started moving.
She was willing to fight for you at the Battle of Hogwarts, and she’d do the same today. Your Mother isn’t a fool, Draco. She wouldn't have run the risk of life in Azkaban on a whim. You worry that she is trapped, or that she has been taken prisoner and I won’t lie to you Draco. You know your family, and the people who might seek to do you harm far better than I, and so perhaps this is a possibility.
I’ve always trusted her judgment and I was panicking. Please don’t judge me, but we tried to reverse the privacy charms in my diary, to try and discover whether it was some manner of cursed object. We even talked about incinerating it with a spell.
Let’s take this precious book back to Hogwarts. Hagrid shall have a look at it. After all, he’s the one who trained a whole flock of Thestrals in spite of all the superstitions there are about these magnificently eerie creatures (and most presumably in spite of several laws). I suppose most wixen would have run for their lives instead of trying to get involved with a flock of wild Thestrals in their forest of a back garden. Admittedly, I’m not sure if Hagrid will learn from the book or rather be able to add to it.
"Might be nice," Neville echoed back to him, his voice now firmly settled into disbelief. Harry could relate.
"It's not like you don't already know," Harry said easily, endlessly distracted by the bit of hair curling by Malfoys ear. It really was ridiculously unfair that he could look that good doing nothing but sitting there, wearing the same robes as everyone else and yet somehow looking better than anyone ever had. "You're probably one of the few people who knows just how shit I am at quite a few different things."
"Touch me," he breathed against Harry's jaw, arching into his hold, spreading his legs even wider on top of him as he pushed back into Harry's hands, a small jerking movement like he just couldn't quite help but want more.
Harry hardly moved as he waited but it appeared that was all Ron had to say, shrugging as he went back to his food. Harry let himself breathe a small sigh of relief, ignoring how hot his ears felt.
"Anything," Harry murmured down to him, so close to the edge but desperate for Malfoy to get there first. "Come on Malfoy."
It was only after a minute of standing in the silence that Harry realized he didn't have the faintest idea where their new rooms were and all but sprinted back to the great hall, hoping someone else from eighth year was still there eating.
Harry didn't let himself think too hard on what that had been, but couldn't deny the dread that sat like a rock in his gut at the thought of the year at Hogwarts without Malfoy there too, irrational as he knew it was. After being unable to give up on anything for so long it was nice to do now, even if it was just to accept the fact that the way Mafloy made him feel would never make sense to him, let alone be something Harry could begin to understand.
"I talk to Malfoy," Harry said right away, like maybe if he told someone else it would actually make it be true, at least in the way he wanted.
Harry had to laugh, taking a small step towards him. "So you can be rude but I can't, is that how this works?"
Hermione's eyes went over to the staff table with Harry's right behind her, sending up a silent thank you when he saw Hagrids seat was empty.
With a quick glance around the hall Harry could see the few students scattered around all openly watching them and reached out a hand to grab Malfoy's arm, ignoring his protests as he pulled them both into the nearest empty classroom.
It felt unreal that they were suddenly like this, and Harry knew that they were moving fast but at the same time it didn't feel fast at all, like they'd been living in the build up to this moment for years.
"We haven't even started classes," Malfoy said after a moment, looking away from him for the first time.
His class schedule didn't seem like such a daunting task anymore, compared to whatever it was that was happening to him now.
Stealing himself Harry finally lifted up a fist to knock, comforted by the small fact that he would have at least until the house elf gathered Malfoy to figure out exactly what he would end up saying. After a moment the door opened and there stood Malfoy, his hair slightly disheveled and his shirt collar crooked. His face was lightly flushed, eyes red rimmed and tired, his expression slowly turning to shock as he took in who was on his doorstep.
"Just curious," Harry said, looking down to his half eaten plate of food. He wondered if Neville ever mentioned him to Malfoy, if Malfoy had ever asked about him, if he even remembered Harry was still there at all. "He won't talk to me."
It said something for his self control that he managed to hold back a smile as he looked at Slughorn, fighting to keep his voice earnest as he spoke. "I think partnering with Mafloy would help me to catch up, he's always gotten top marks in potions."
"You actually care." Malfoy's voice hardly seemed to be there at all, his words so unexpected Harry couldn't seem to figure them out for a moment, looping endlessly inside him.
"You know what Potter, despite everything telling me it would be an absolute disaster, I almost want to root for you."
The eighth years were apparently all staying in a converted section of the astronomy tower, the common room a mix of decorations from all of the different houses that somehow clashed and made sense at the same time. The room listings were posted at the bottom of each stairway, one for the boys and one for the girls.
He knew he was grinning but couldn't figure out how to stop, limbs still pleasantly numb, laying on the stone floor with a completely disheveled Malfoy still on top of him.
"Hello," Harry said dumbly, rocking back onto his heels and feeling every bit the fool Malfoy had always claimed he was. He had no idea why he'd let himself think any part of this was a good idea.
Malfoy stepped forward in a rush, hands grabbing Harry's shirt as he pushed him back, so much further into his personal space than Harry was ready for. "I don't know why you think you need to keep tabs on me Potter, but I don't appreciate you showing up at my house just to–"
He was unable to stop the surprised noise that fell out of him, not expecting much considering who had made it. "It's good," Harry said after he swallowed, wondering why he'd thought coming over with no plan on what he would say had ever felt like a good idea.
Harry had only realized he was shaking when the witch next to him began openly staring, whispering to the woman next to her as they had both turned to watch him.
Realizing he was dangerously close to running but unable to care what he looked like Harry closed the distance to the door, flinging it open and himself through it in one movement. Stepping forward in a rush Harry quickly darted his eyes around the surrounding hallway entrances, but of course Malfoy was nowhere in sight. Harry let his shoulders sag, wondering why he'd even come out here, what he thought might have happened if they'd actually spoken to each other.
Harry nodded, letting them both fall into their own conversation as he lifted his head to let his eyes travel over the platform, ignoring all the sets of young wide eyed that were looking back at them. He had to wonder if they'd all really been that small as first years, knowing that somehow they had been. His eyes locked on a narrow frame and blonde hair and Harry was taking a step forward before he even realized, quickling stopping himself in what he hoped past as something casual and not the random jerking step forward that he was sure it had been.
"How do I sound Malfoy?" Harry repeated, moving closer still, shifting across the floor until there was hardly any space between them at all. Malfoys hands fell open in his lap and Harry let himself reach out, sliding his hand along his palm before intertwining their fingers, hearing Malfoys sharp intake of breath, though he made no move to pull his hand away.
It suddenly seemed ridiculous that he still didn't know what Malfoy looked like shirtless, but Harry knew the face he made when he came.
"Are you secretly very boring Potter?" Zabini asked from his desk, his voice breaking across the silence so suddenly Harry jerked on the bed.
Harry didn't know what to do for a moment, a strange tingling emotion filling him up side as any words he tried to say died the moment he tried to make them take shape in his mouth.
"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?" Malfoy snapped, still just standing there when he could have left so many times already.
Malfoy's shoulders were tensed and Harry knew that Mafloy knew he was watching him but he didn't look back, just kept working through his revisions as Harry looked on. The bit of skin at the back of his neck that Harry could see peeking out of the top of his robes was a soft pink. Harry had to wonder if Malfoy had always blushed this easily and he had just never noticed before, or if it was something new, something that he'd managed to find inside Malfoy that no one else had thought to look for.
Without quite meaning to Harry zoned off again, knowing Hermione would fill him in on anything important that was being said. Keeping his head propped up on his hand facing the front Harry let his eyes wander to the Slytherin table, only to find Malfoy was finally in his line of sight and already looking back at him. Stunned all Harry could do was blink, noticing that Malfoy's hair still wasn't pushed back like it had been in all the years before. It was loose, falling in a soft wave across his forehead just like it had been over the summer. Another blink and Malfoy looked away, down at his plate and then back up to the front where Magonagall was still speaking.
Harry brought his hands rest along his hips and just like that Malfoy stopped, like just the barest touch from Harry was enough to keep him there. Swallowing Harry worked his thumb in a mindless circle along Malfoy's hip bone, slipping it under his shirt to touch bare skin.
Harry didn't realize he was smiling until he rubbed a hand down his face, ignoring the looks being shot his way as he finally turned and started back towards his class. Even knowing he was likely going to be late enough to warrant a detention now Harry couldn't bring himself to rush, could hardly see the point of even going back to class at all when he knew there was even less hope of him concentrating than usual.
Harry let one hand that had come to rest on Malfoy's lower back slide down to grab his ass, holding him tight against him with the other when he tried to jerk away. "Wild guess," he said through a laugh, leaning down to kiss the frown from Malfoy's lips.
Just like that Malfoy moved to walk out of the room, like he would really just leave Harry sitting there alone, still holding out his wand to no one. Harry stood up in a rush, closing the distance between them in a few quick steps and grasping Malfoy's upper arm. "Wait."
"He really is quite a shit teacher," Harry said under his breath, fighting to keep his expression neutral when Malfoy actually glanced back at him. "I'm pretty sure he's hungover half the time and just has us revise so he doesn't have to talk."
"Yes well," Slughorn said in a rush, shuffling a few quills uselessly around his desk. "I suppose you're right. As long as there aren't any problems it should be fine."
Harry had never seen Malfoy like this, unkempt and something dangerously close to soft. It set off a feeling in his chest that Harry couldn't place, and even blurred and far off inside of him it still felt too big for Harry to have any desire to examine it any further than that.
"Why did you speak at my trial?" Malfoy finally asked, the one question Harry would have given anything not to answer.
Somehow, even though they still hadn't got to the reason Harry was there yet this had already turned into one of the more surreal experiences of his life. Even after everything that had happened Harry could have never imagined sitting down for tea with Malfoy in his house like this, like they were just a couple of old friends meeting to catch up. He decided to take it as a good sign, and resolutely ignored the mass of nerves swirling around inside of him.
The sound of his voice again after so long was jarring in a way Harry hadn't thought to prepare for, especially like this. Seeing Mafloy like this always made everything feel like it was just on the verge of spilling over inside of him, and even now after years of feeling it Harry still felt no closer to understanding what it meant. Maybe with Malfoy he just never would. Maybe that was fine.
Harry had never considered Malfoy might actually want to be kissed, that he might actually want to be kissed by him, that he could think about it with that kind of look on his face. Harry's hand was halfway up to reach out for Malfoy's face before he caught himself, smiling at the panicked look behind Malfoy's eyes.
Harry had no idea how Malfoy managed to stay here after everything that had happened, and then he turned to face him again and Harry's silent question seemed to answer itself, just from the closed off expression on his face.
"I hope I see you at school," Harry said before turning the handle, letting his eyes travel over Malfoy one last time before he stepped outside, the cold air like a slap against his senses.
"I don't think you want me to do it in the hallway," Harry said, burning up inside the moment the words left his mouth.
"Well that was faster than I thought," Malfoy's voice came from behind him, "and I didn't think it would take long at all."
Three weeks into the year and Harry had yet to decide if he regretted coming back to school or not. It had seemed like such an obvious choice at the time, to the point that it hadn't seemed like much of a choice at all, but now he wasn't quite so sure. He couldn't seem to remember how to focus in class, or sleep on something resembling a normal sleep schedule, or how to talk with people he had considered friends for years. Harry wasn't sure what was happening to him anymore.
But the silence was starting to be too much, and the way Malfoy was looking at him like he'd never seen Harry before in his life only left Harry tense and on edge inside. "Can I come in?"
"Since fourth year," Malfoy said with a smirk, picking up his quill to twirl it back and forth between his long slender fingers. Harry wondered if they were as cold as they had felt before. "It could probably use an update, now that you mention it."
"It's nothing," Harry said quickly, his eyes darting back across the platform, taking in the back of Malfoy's head, the shape of his shoulders beneath his robes, hair close to shining beneath the harsh lights above them. Doing everything to keep his breath even Harry stepped forward again. "I'll be right back," he said as he moved past them, ignoring Ron's question at his back as he went.
Malfoy visibly jerked but didn't step back, his eyelids fluttering so slightly Harry only saw it by chance, watching Malfoy pull his bottom lip between his teeth before he spoke. "What do you want then?"
Malfoy shifted on top of him as his hand started to move, dropping forward to rest his other elbow next to Harry's head, his mouth resting along Harry's ear. "You should fuck me," he said in that certain voice he had, like he would make it so just by saying it. His hand gripped Harry's cock tighter ok the away down, easing on the way back up as he reached the head, letting a finger slide ever so softly across the slit.
Shaking his head Harry glanced around the now thinning group of people in the hall around them, and how not one seemed to be paying any attention to them for once. "You want to talk to me," Harry said simply, knowing it would only infuriate Malfoy more.
"Why not?" Harry's voice came out softer than he'd ever sounded talking to Malfoy, distantly wondering at what he was doing by letting himself actually ask that question.
Harry stood in a rush, walking over and pressing himself against Malfoys back as he wrapped his arms around his waist. "I can't argue that," he spoke against Malfoy's ear, laying a distracted kiss against his jaw. "But this is better, right?"
Malfoy made some affronted noise, eyes darting around to see if anyone was listening before turning to walk towards the classroom again.
"What?" Harry managed to ask, the word wrapped around some strained kind of laugh that didn't really sound like a laugh at all.
"Don't be so dramatic," Harry said, eyes stuck on the flush just beginning to touch Malfoy's cheekbones. "Did you want everyone listening in?"
Trust me, that was a sentence that I never expected to write. Still, there's been a lot of things about my short life that I never expected. This is perhaps one of the milder surprises.
There’d also be a time without sharing the broom, I’m sure of it. We’d race each other and perhaps pass the Quaffle or catch the Snitch. I’m sure I’d be a little rusty on a broom, but I know you. You’d let me win once or twice so I wouldn’t get too fed up with your smug grin from winning all the time. I bet I’d be back to peak form in no time with you.
I know that Hagrid didn’t say much in return but that’s just his way. He’s a taciturn man. I know he accepts us though. He’d never have let you walk Fang like he did, or show you his prized collection of Blast-Ended Skrewts that he keeps. I mean, yes, everybody KNOWS they are an aberration, Draco, but you can’t tell him that. It’d break his giant heart.
The music was exquisite. All those hours of lazing on the settee with you listening to records has made me quite refined in my musical taste. You guided me so masterfully on the dancefloor, and it was as if the rest of the eighth year vanished, and the night was ours alone. I love the feeling of your hand on my hip, so steady and full of love.
Truth is, I wasn’t expecting to see you this evening. You had that after school studies group, didn’t you? The one with Slughorn? Primer for the Alchemical Process? See, I listen! I wasn’t feigning interest in your egghead pursuits while only thinking of how gorgeous you are.
People have told me in the past that I’m very like my father (another way you and I are alike!) and I do hope that I am. He seemed like he would have been a very funny, kind person. Unlike yours, my parents only had an age difference of a couple of months.
While you were grinning to yourself before, your smile fell a little then. “The Dursleys made me cook sometimes.”
Obviously, good old Finch-Fletchley had plenty to say, but that is nothing new. Merlin, but I feel a bit sorry for the git. It was worth dressing in your green just to experience his outrage. His face turned the same shade of puce that Uncle Vernon’s used to turn when he saw gay people on his television.
“Draco, love,” I said, wrapping my arms around you, swaying slightly, feeling like my absence had been more significant than a mere few hours, “there’s nothing to catastrophize. Everything in the Paris Gringotts went just like a dream. The Goblins were every bit as rude and unpleasant as the English variety, and they showed me to the vault without a second glance. Narcissa has set aside a big pile of Galleons for our future – enough for us to instruct a Barrister, set you up in business with a dozen solid-gold cauldrons if you wished, and even buy you a fleet of owls if that was what you wanted.” I leant over, kissing your silky white-blond hair and feeling the tingling coils of your magic knitting with my own. “I love you,” I continued. “I truly do. Everything is fine, I promise.”
Sorry to hear that you were let down in love as well. Did your girl move away after the war? I know that a lot of families took their children to live abroad after it was concluded. If you knew you were to marry since you were both young, then the sting of that must have really hurt. Were the pair of you childhood sweethearts?
So, my Harry. What are you up to this fine evening? I shall hope that they don’t treat you as the Saviour there, but as the inquisitive apprentice that you are. There’s nothing worse than to be given an advantage because of your name – you never know where you really stand, and you start doubting yourself all the time, no matter whether you have a solid reason for it or not.
Voldemort’s followers fled and vanished, as soon as it became clear which way the wind was blowing after the battle. The thing is, though? Much as I loathed Malfoy – and I genuinely did, he was a horrible bully for years – nobody deserves to go forward into their future lives with such severe probationary demands hanging over their heads. What kind of a future is that?
You thrust inside me then, pushing home until I was taking every inch of you, and I was stretched full. Soon you were pounding into me, flexing your hips, making me groan. We fucked with a pure, wild abandon until you wrung an orgasm out of me, one that made pure magic cascade through my veins. We lay, afterwards, breathless and panting in each other’s arms, cum slippery on our skin.
I need to ask you a favour and I will not be able to repay you any time soon. It’s about money which, as you can probably tell, hurts my pride. But I can’t help it, I require dress robes. Tailored, if it’s not too much to ask. Also dress shoes. I’d feel quite out of place at your ceremony without appropriate attire, but I can’t afford any. Mother still can’t get into the Manor where I would have a bunch of clothes to choose from.
“Good Circe,” you breathed, and the way your groin moved against my wrist told me to let go of you, give you a moment to recover.
We also spoke about social interactions, and I mentioned – only mentioned, really – that you’re a good friend. Didn’t get into detail about that. Apparently, what I said about flesh-and-blood-schoolmates made my Mind Healer think that I have a low self-esteem. My former self would have laughed right in their face. Then I read some of the things I told you and I’d still laugh in their face wouldn’t it be so awfully uncalled-for. I’m a right narcissist.
“I meant to wait until later, but I just can’t wait, love,” you said. You handed me a small package wrapped in brown paper, retrieving it from a black plastic bag. Our fingers brushed, and you leaned back against the wall with a crooked grin, half abashed and half excited. “Now go ahead,” you urged me on.
We’re both blokes. Nearly all traditions I’ve seen in my life are based around differences between the sexes. Flowers and feathers tied into the bride’s veil, certain garments for the first intercourse, soirees for the groom-to-be and the male part of the family he’s bonding into, and so on. It’s all very ‘sexist’. When I’ve chatted with Hermione, she said that’s the term for what I described. (We were not talking about bonding, but about the way the
Also seeing you do some Potions revision like I suggested earlier is quite a sight to behold. I can see your eyes swoop over to me over the rim of your spectacles, but apart from these not-so-furtive glances, you do look like you’re actually reading about the influence of the moon cycle on the magical properties of animal source ingredients.
He sat down next to me, and (ever the polite pure-blood) started off with some school talk. I had none of his faux decorum and asked him rather testily how I could help him.
“Why?” they asked me, over and over. “Why would Draco Malfoy have made that decision? It simply doesn’t fit with what we know of his character. It doesn’t fit with the well documented history of antagonism between the pair of you. Wouldn’t you say, Harry, that it’s far more likely Draco actually didn’t recognise you, and that he made a mistake at Malfoy Manor?”
When you were on my bed, you looked at me in that almost shy way that you sometimes have. So different from all the fierce vigour you displayed on my behalf only hours before. And when I asked you to take off this Muggle-esque Harpies shirt – Merlin, my hands felt so shaky, I’m surprised you haven’t commented on how nervous I must’ve looked.
At least this steamy preview gave me a good idea of how to spend the short break between classes. I rushed down into the dungeons, making sure to appreciate your recollections of this morning’s events with due dedication.
article on top of your mother being missing was just too much for anyone to cope with on their own. I’m the only one to blame. If only I hadn’t left you at breakfast… I’m sorry. You’re my everything, Draco, and I don’t know what I’d do without you. Remember Easter, and all those plans we made? Those long lie ins, eating buttery croissants in bed and then sharing a lazy, luxurious bath together? None of those plans have changed. Hold tight to those, because we’ll get through this. I’m holding true to what I know in my heart: that our lives together are just beginning.
Right now, I’m feeling thankful that we can take the time. I have no idea how many Galleons Mother has stored away for me, and I’m not sure on the exact holdings of your account. But Merlin, we have a house, we can take some time off after we graduate.
– that interview with Cho today was a low blow, we only shared one sodding kiss! – but I felt a little like people were starting to move on a little bit. Those idiot second years getting themselves suspended till Easter for trying to Stupefy the Giant Squid – a brilliant bit of fun, I reckon – has definitely taken some of the heat off us too. That’s the best thing about a school teaching witchcraft and wizardry. Some other odd, funny incident is always around the corner.
“Someone wants to get laid,” I said with a cocked eyebrow, running my fingers over the bottle and reading the etiquette. “Is 1980 a good champagne vintage, monsieur?”
We definitely ought to try it, once you’re back. You are, after all, my very favourite test subject when it comes to my potions. (I KNOW that you’re still holding it against me, that terrible rash you had after trying this potion. And I still insist that it was from spending all afternoon in the sun without a decent Sun Potion or shade.)
on the poor pair left them staring at each other in confusion and shock as I slid out of the Dungeon door, entirely undetected. Perhaps it might be advisable to check up on the unfortunate twosome: my magic might have been a touch strong and they, after all, are still recovering from Pomfrey’s healing charms. Part of me wishes I’d just
I raised my eyebrows at you. And Harry, darling, you were so turned on from my haughty stare. There’s no denying it, I got you right on the wand, Potter. Our eyes were glued to each other’s for a long moment, and I’m amazed that we mustered the self-control to not rip each other’s clothes off right there and then.
Frankly, I have no idea how much I care about my N.E.W.T.s or my career, if at all. I tried to think about this question for a bit, but I honestly can’t tell. I’m lucky enough if I manage to think ahead of time for a period as long as a fortnight. It’s not that I would’ve had much of a choice anyway without the war, because of what we’ve talked about: future carved in stone and all. Beautiful, marbled stone.
Now, before your brain starts ticking, I’m not actually a Charms student. However, a few of my friends are, and Flitwick is kind enough to let me sit at the back of his classroom. Usually, I’d do a bit of homework but today? I couldn’t. My head is all over the place. I couldn’t resist picking up my diary and spilling out my thoughts.
And yes, you’re so bloody correct when you claim to have a “proclivity for unjustified self-importance”. Merlin’s fucking eyes, Draco! That last letter of yours was the most majestic piece of angsty teenage catastrophe that I’ve ever cast my eyes over, and, let me assure you, I get a big pile of lovelorn missives, every day of the bloody week. I had to read it twice, Draco. Half of me expected you to threaten to throw yourself from the Astronomy Tower in a fit of tragic anguish.
“Indeed, you are,” I replied, sneaking up behind you and snaking my arms around your middle. I pressed a kiss into the crook of your neck, and inhaled your lovely, musky scent, marvelling at our soft domesticity. “Keep moving those sausages about,” I added, aiming for another (very weak) double entendre. “The whole length of them needs a good covering. I know you’ve got form in that department.”
“He will talk about a last chance for a family of the Inner Circle that used to be so dedicated and of such importance in building the vital bridges before the war – the first one. ‘The last chance shall be your puny scion, Lucius,’ he will say. And we will just kneel there, arms stretched out and bare, limbs going numb on the stone floor of the Grand Drawing Room, the room in which I learnt to play chess.
Well, and so it began. It was a storm of Bombarda’s and Expulso’s on the junk in the basement and Vanishing the residue before it could even dust the ground. The competition, the thrill of destruction – I felt like a child without one sorrow in the world, and you mirrored my exuberant mood with fierce eyes and hoarse laughter.
Of course my fingers went over your belly and down to your crotch, stroking so lightly and teasingly over your prick that you wriggled underneath my touch with a soft, low chuckle that resonated through your back against my chest. You made the sweetest and softest gasp, though, when I closed my hand around your cock, pulling and squeezing until I felt it pulse with lust, felt your breathing change. With my arm tucked under your neck and looped around your chest, I pressed you so close back against me, my love.
As you’re no doubt very used to, I could wax lyrical on the subject of making out with you for hours. Sadly, all that’d leave me with would be an erection that I’d have to take care of, and a terrible feeling of injustice that you weren’t beside me, so right now I’ll move onto less sensual subjects. All talk about wriggling, writhing and associated terminology will have to wait for bedtime, when I can set Silencing Charms and fill my mind with images of you.
But what followed, my darling, was so much more important and enticing than all the antique furniture of the Sacred Twenty-Eight together.
But this morning, after our extended bath, I fell in love with you all anew. I think you might be aware, because when I sat at the kitchen table, and you dismissed Kreacher, telling him that you will prepare breakfast, I must’ve looked at you quite reverently.
I felt a bit relieved then and thought me ridiculous for being so darn angsty so quickly. But I started observing the fellow, and I even remembered that you told me how he and Seamus sometimes sleep in one bed. Though I have never seen them even hold hands or hug. And to my knowledge, they are not officially anything more than friends, are they?
