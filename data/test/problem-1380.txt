The crash is unavoidable, but what Draco doesn’t count on is Potter grabbing onto his coat as he goes down, the two of them hitting the ice hard and sliding until they skid to a stop at the edge of a snow bank. Draco’s taken the brunt of the fall under Potter’s additional weight, and he lying beneath him, he can hear the way they both gulp lungfuls of air, chests rising and falling.
“He’s made plans with the Weasleys. And he’s not my boyfriend.”
Potter stomps through the grass and snow, sparse as it is now that it hasn’t fallen in a few days and the good weather has been doing its best to keep it at bay. There’s a part of Draco that hopes it’ll snow again soon, fond as he is of the usual Christmas traditions and the picturesque way the large trees and sweeping hills frame the castle grounds, everything covered in white like a postcard.
? You must think bigger, darlings. Perhaps here at Hogwarts it’s a touch unique, but what about other magical institutions? Other historical figures? There is a whole, wide, world outside these walls!”
“Let me guess: you’re looking out for Draco’s best interests?”
They reach the familiar tapestry, which Draco takes his time examining, chewing his lip. In a lot of ways, this is far worse than the Astronomy Tower.
He didn’t know how to feel about the revelation that Potter might have been trying to look out for him.
Beside him, Potter’s eyes fly open. “Seriously?”
“Well, I think it’s a good thing,” Granger’s hair is bushy as ever as she settles on the other side of Potter. Her sparkly red headband catches the light. “I suppose it was bound to happen in one way or another.”
"I think I'd have managed it eventually," Harry says smugly. "Given our history."
“I suppose.”
“I’m not his underling, you git!”
Thoughts of Harry are still on his mind when he enters the Muggle Studies classroom and Professor Hangingbone stands at the front of the room, behind her desk. She looks worse for wear, as if the time off has had an ill effect on her spirits: her hair is lank, her eyes dull. Draco thinks she looks thinner than the last time he’d seen her, the day of the brawl. It feels like months ago, though Draco knows logically it’s only been a week or two.
Prompt:
“Are we back on speaking terms already?” His deep baritone makes the words ooze like honey, slow moving and heavy with intent. “I thought I had until New Years at least, for one of us to issue a formal apology.”
"Neither do you. Does he, Longbottom?"
Several people wince as Draco shoots up from his chair, the legs making an unpleasant screech. “Book,” he grounds out, holding himself erect until he turns a corner, walks several feet and sags.
“How does it feel? Seeking the attention of someone who wants nothing to do with you. It must be quite a shock.” The stricken expression on Potter’s face makes Draco feel like Christmas has arrived early. It almost makes up for Blaise’s harsh words and the reminder that The Manor offers no relief.
“Then I guess you’d better start calling me Harry.”
Merlin’s pendulous ballsack. Sighing heavily Draco spins, yet again. "In a manner of speaking. I suppose you all had a good laugh about it down on level two."
"It's nice to see you, too," Potter says dryly.
"Karrey is taking Mr. Draco to meet the others. They is in the Come and Go Room."
“You’re already touching me,” Potter breathes, amused.  “You don’t have to ask, Malfoy. I want it. I want to watch you do it.”
“This is easier.”
“This is me.” Potter slips out of his trainers and sits on the edge with a bounce. “Feel for yourself.”
“You mean

who threw off an Unforgivable like it was an old cloak.
"I-. I was passing through." Potter won't meet his eyes.
Auror Abernathy fails to make an appearance on Wednesday for Draco's weekly mind healer appointment, which doesn't much surprise Draco, but clearly comes as one to
"You could have come and gotten me, you know."
"It’s none of my business. Forget I asked."
Unfurling his fist, Draco grimaces. He’s still holding Parvati’s monstrous quill, the shaft snapped a third of the way down.
Draco's hand wanders on it's own accord
“I think that push off the dock exposed some kind of fetish. You’re a kinky sod, Potter.”
Draco stops short, freezing in the middle of the grass. "I'm not trying to clear my conscious."
Which is why he needs to try the hat on again. Whether it pronounces him NAUGHTY or NICE, at least he’ll have his answer. And if he tries it on again and it says nothing at all.. well, that’ll be an answer of sorts, too.
“Yeah, Malfoy,” adds another boy with a slight overbite. “Get out of here before we tell the Headmistress!”
They continue on, turning another corner, and Draco takes in what he can. The part of him that always seeks to hold an advantage is storing as much information as possible for future use. He supposes it’s not very different from the magically preserved pantries of the Manor: there’s baked breads and butchered meats, biscuits, wine, cheese - hey pass a tall display of various juices and Draco wants to stops and examine them, their contents like something out of a potions class.
That’s what he suspects it is, anyway. Draco’s been watching Potter to be sure, but everything that’s been happening makes sense: feeling tired and unfocused while Potter walks around looking like ill, laughing when things aren’t funny, being overcome by waves of sadness so strong he bursts into tears.
, was the once elegant ballroom where they'd gathered to congratulate Weasley and Granger, before George Weasley approached them to say what he really thought of Draco’s presence.
Karrey blinks, his eyes flat. He closes the box with a snap that almost takes Draco's fingers with it. "This way."
"Please don't underestimate me." Blaise sniffs. He mouth transforms into a smug smile. "We only have about ten minutes, so Luna and I are coming through. Step back."

means he’s gearing up to say something. “Look, you know how I feel about it. Harry’s a good guy, but he’s always flying by the seat of his pants about something or other.” Ernie shrugs. “I just don’t want you to be one of those things.”
"How horrible for him."
In the evenings, the stone walls of the Dungeon are tinged emerald from the ornate lamps that sit on the smooth, dark, side tables and the flames that roar pleasantly in the hearth. The fire is charmed to remain Slytherin green, even without Floo powder, and as it burns, the light creates sinuous shadows in the room that undulate with serpentine curves, thrown into stark relief.
+++++
It’s very much what he expected and yet, not at all. The red and gold was predictable enough. It’s everywhere, the curtains, the armchairs, the pendants and cushions. But the windows are large and let in a lot of light. The furniture looks worn but inviting, and the hearth has a roaring fire that crackles brightly. It’s where Draco finds Potter and Weasley, sat on the ground with cups of hot chocolate on the low table in front of them, an open bag of marshmallows, and an absurdly large bowl of popcorn.
“What?” Draco eyes dart back and forth. “What’s happened?” He rips the hat from his head, frenzied and frightened.
"What's this then?" Millicent, leans forward, tucking a stray curl behind her ear from where it's escaped her bun. "Did something happen before? Are they targeting us?"
“You asked me to leave you alone, didn’t you?” Potter asks in the same pleading voice. He extends his legs as he turns and Draco idly notices that Potter’s woolen socks have little stags on them.
! You might as well have murdered her yourself!!”
Most of the eighth year students are already seated when Draco walks in, chatting and joking as they prepare their quills and flip idly through their textbooks. However, there’s a noticeable change in volume as Draco weaves his way between the chairs, hands covering mouths in hushed whispers as eyes flicker over him and away again. Pansy and Parvati takes seats in the back of the room, nont too far from Potter who also sits towards the back of the room
“Budge over, Potter.” Draco licks his lips as he removes his dress shoes and neatly slides them with one stockinged foot under the bed. He waits until he’s sitting on the bed to remove his robe, hoping the room is too dim to make the press against his zip noticeable.
Granger is quick to come to Harry's defense. "Harry's obvious when he likes someone, but that isn't his fault. He's just more expressive than most."
Potter face turns a brilliant pink. “Excuse me?”
Flatware back on the table, Draco lifts his slice and mimics the others, taking a bite of his own. He chews. It tastes... terrible. Not at all unlike how he imagines thick parchment would. It must show on his face; Boot laughs. It's pleasant -- the kind of dry laugh that reminds Draco of endless hours spent in the Slytherin Common Room.
“I don’t know, Professor,” Finnigan grins, gesturing at Potter. “Wouldn’t be the first time Hogwarts’ produced something unique.” A few people laugh good-naturedly. Potter grimaces. Runs a hand through his awful hair and it lingers just a bit too long over the curls that Draco knows hide his scar.
Blaise passes them two steaming mugs of cider spiked with a bottle of Blishen's that Theo managed to sneak in, while someone turns on the wireless and the latest release from The Weird Sisters’ Yule album begins to play. Draco lowers himself onto the empty hard-backed sofa, and Harry puts on no airs about settling in right next to him.
"Gin?"
"At first I thought it may not have reached you. So I wrote another. And another. But I--" Draco wants to throttle himself for how idiotic he's being. "I just thought if you'd gotten them, you would have written back."
When it becomes apparent he isn’t planning to leave, Draco does the one thing he’s tried with varying success: ignores him. He’s been doing a good job of it since September, careful to never closely examine the reasons distance suddenly became necessary. What Draco knows is that he needs a book before he can head back to the table, and he needs to his his essay.
Draco wrinkles his nose. Honestly he wants to curse whoever came up with that term. As if Potter and his friends aren't well known enough without the ministry stroking their egos.
It was the wrong thing to say. The exposed length of Malfoy's neck flushed a hot pink, his gaze hardening into something past warning, but not yet sanguinary. "If I had a warm body in my bed, Potter," he said, coolly. "Do you think I'd drop everything as soon as you curled your finger?"
Potter and Malfoy were said to have entered several stores, including Honeydukes (as it is wildly know that Potter has a rather large sweet tooth), The Alchemist’s Secret Wares, and Creature Comforts to name a few. When asked to comment, Potter reportedly shouted obscenities at the crowd, telling them several times that while not in his right mind, he believed himself capable of making his own decisions.
From the depths of the bag she removes a red velvet cap trimmed with fur and topped with a fluffy pom. “Here we are!”
Draco fling the door to Abernathy's office open and almost collides into Harry Potter, who jumps back as if he's seen a ghost. The color drains from his face as he looks at him, eyes wide. "Draco."
Patronuses weren’t used lightly -- most people preferred to send owls and notes to relay messages within the castle when necessary -- so waking up to the spectral form of Potter’s stag was nothing short of ominous.

I can't believe I did it. Wow. This was an experience. Thank you to everyone who came with me. Thank you for reading, commenting, kudos-ing, or just wishing me good luck in the back of your mind. Thanks to the mods for running this fest, and I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday. Enjoy all the entries!! They're seriously amazing.
That left one empty bed in which the three of them used as a catch all — games of exploding snap, laying out clothes, even the occasional pillow fort, which was a fact sworn to secrecy and never to leave the room.
Ernie McMillan gently knocks his shoulder against Draco’s, rousing him from his reverie. “Alright, Malfoy?” He nods and Ernie nods back, satisfied. He flashes Draco a conspiratorial grin. “Listen to them go on, then.” He indicates the others. “Three more weeks and they’re scheduling shag appointments.”
"Sorry, I really can’t talk now," Potter’s eyes dart wildly as he backs away. "Official... Auror stuff! Maybe later?" His walk becoming a sprint as soon as he reaches the end of the hall.
“Oi!” Weasley shouts, though he’s smiling. “That’s my best mate you’re talking about it. And his head is as hard as ever, with or without the ferret around.”
Harry Potter is preparing for pain. For the threat of being hurt by him.
“I’m not going to poison you, if that’s what you’re afraid of. Don’t tempt me.”
“And differences are all you’re working out?” Draco’s head snaps to the Weasley across from him, who is watching him with knowing blue eyes. Strangely it’s his eyes that remind Draco that for all their class differences, the Weasleys are still a part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, a pureblood family through and through, with the old magic that runs through their veins to awaken all kinds of latent gifts and clairvoyance. Draco brings a veil down over his most Potter-centric thoughts just in case.
"You know as well I do. Biggsby’s always been eager to show it off."
Draco’s not fooled for a second. “You don’t have to lie, Potter. I know it’s not the Gryffindor common room, but it suits us just fine.” He gestures half-heartedly to the members of his house lounging about who pretend not to eavesdrop, like Harry Potter sat in the middle of their common room is an everyday occurrence. Let no one say that Slytherins aren’t ones for keeping appearances. “I suggest you get used to it.”
“But that’s not her!” Pansy fumes, crossing her arms. “She’s trying to seduce him with who she thinks he wants, not who she actually is! What’s the point if you can’t keep up the act?”
Hours later, after a late-night snack and another round in which Draco straddled Harry and rode things out to great success, they feel across Harry's bed, sleepy and sated. The post-orgasmic bubble they share has lead to the usual vulnerabilities, but there's only one question Draco has had on his mind for weeks now.
“If you’re sure..” It’s directed towards Draco, who firms his mouth into a hard line. He’s not a child. And he’s certainly not going to give Harry the satisfaction of making the scene expected of him. Instead, Draco raises his chin and displays the full brunt of his poshest accent.
“He is,” Draco answers slowly, wondering why he feels a prickle of anxiety. “But he’s getting behind on his classes thanks to you, so I’m going to help him revise in the meantime.”
Draco smirks. "It was certainly a shock to Longbottom to find we have something in common, I assure you."
“I don’t suppose you’d like to spend hols with me?” Harry says softly into Draco’s ear. His breath puffs sweetly on the shell of Draco’s ear, sends a thrill of pleasure down his spine. “We’d have to spend Christmas Eve at the Burrow, but I don’t anyone will mind if we were to spend Christmas Day at mine.”
In Hogsmeade, the open plot of land next to Madam Puddifoot’s shop had been fashioned into a brand new attraction for couples to indulge their romantic overtones. In the warm months, it was to be a lake upon swan boats would glide while cupids sang, surrounded by benches and picnic blankets for those who wanted to eat their cakes and drink their tea while watching the sun on the water. But in the winter, it functioned as a skating rink, ideal for couples’ skating, set amongst a glittering gold gazebo and enchanted hearts that bobbed beneath the surface of the ice.
Draco slaps his hand down on the counter as a belly laugh knocks him off his feet. His stomach actually hurts he’s laughing so hard. He has to grip the smooth wood to keep himself upright. Still gripping Scrivenshaft’s soiled handkerchief in one hand.
The next dish arrives and it’s a succulent white fish topped with a white wine reduction and fresh greens on the side. The fish is perfectly cooked, flaky and moist when he pares it with his fork. It’s even better when he tastes it, melting like butter on his tongue.
“You know what I mean, Harry,” is Hermione’s curt reply. She picks up one of the many books she’s brought out to the lake with her, flipping the pages until she finds the passages she’s bookmarked. “It’s all right here:
Lovegood plucks a red box from the shelf and tears it open without pretense. Draco can only watch from somewhere outside himself, the experience even more surreal in it’s mundanity. It certainly did nothing to improve his opinion of muggles, faced with their casual disregard for small defenseless fish. Lovegood motions for Draco to hold out his hand, which he does as a mechanical response, and she pours several orange crackers into his open palm before taking some for herself.
True to form, Potter steps further into the aisle. Responding to his movement, several books slide towards him in an attempt to gain attention. “You didn’t mention they were still doing that.”
"You've given this some thought."
Theo is back at the manor a few days after visiting his father to check on his horse. Draco invites him to stay for lunch, and once they’re done, realizes he has to keep his mandatory appointment at the Ministry with his Mind Healer to discuss his thoughts. His very hostile and unsatisfied thoughts. He’s quite eager to share – something Pansy, Theo, his mother, and even Theo’s horse can all attest to.
"I’m perfectly fine, thank you." Draco finishes his glass of water. He doesn't want to get drunk tonight. If anything's going to happen, he wants to be sober so he can remember it.
“Ah, it’s for Blaise. He collects albums.”
"Fantastic," Draco moans.
"It's a shame these suppers are dry," Romilda pouts, swirling the ice in her glass. "Think how fun it would be if we could get a bit sloshed."
A warm glow spilled from the sitting room out onto the floor, the fairy lights of the tree twinkling merrily in the twilight period just before sunrise. Harry stood, tall and glorious before the tree without a stitch of clothing on.
.” Draco claps a hand to his forehead. He can feel Potter watching him. He turns his head in his direction. “Potter, this not just my problem, it’s yours too. You don’t want to go to back to a life without magic, do you?”
Draco guides Potter back down onto his shaft, his head bobbing eagerly as he sucks from root to tip. He brings a wandering hand up to brush over Draco's balls, give them a light squeeze, and Draco shouts, rising onto the balls of his feet. He feels the familar pressure building, feels his cock throb warningly in the wet heat of Potter's mouth.
At the end of the summer his house arrest would be over. He's already decided he's going to continue seeing Mind Healer Headland. He's going to warm up to Auror Abernathy's constant presence in his home. He may even continue weekly suppers with Squill & Spoon.
"Blaise?" Draco scrambles out of the chair and falls to his knees in front of the fireplace. "How are you getting through, our floo is monitored!"
“That’s the second time you’ve called me Draco.”
"What." Draco closes his eyes, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. "Are, You. Doing. Here."
Touching his wand to the stone wall, the craggy rocks slides back to reveal the entrance to the common room. They aren’t even through the hole before a loud BANG! Causes Draco to stumble back into Harry as silver and green confetti rains down on them. Draco looks around in utter confusion.
Harry runs a over his face. Sighs. "You didn't have to do that."
“Come here,” Potter growls. “Wanna do you too.”
Harry nodded. The rest of the Aurors would arrive any minute. Somehow, it'd only made sense to summon Malfoy first. As his partner, Harry'd thought nothing of swiping two fingers over his uniform badge, all the while dodging hits as the sweet, friendly, tone-deaf woman who'd moved in next door, now lunged at him, shattered glass crunching beneath their feet.
“Or them,” Theo says through a mouthful of eggs, directing his gaze at the miniature fleet of reindeer Professor Flickwick has charmed to soar above their heads, sleigh bells jingling merrily. “I think Peeves considers them competition. Who can spread the most cheer.”
He may know what’s going on after all — he’s just not sure he likes the answer.
“You can trust that,” Hagrid finishes, his voice gruff. “If nothin’ else.”
.” He doesn’t miss the way Potter’s face heats at that, the thrill that runs through him. “Haven’t you been listening at all, Potter? Test it. Try something else.”
"Hermione." Harry catches Granger's eyes and they exchange looks. He shakes his head at her.
Why he feels like his mind can’t focus.
Draco shakes his head. He doesn’t know what any of that has to do with him. His face must say as much. Hangingbone continues. “Do you remember what I said that day, Draco? I passed the hat around and I told you all to think of strong,
“Was that you?”
"Your words, not mine," she says with a small shrug. Tell us what’s brought you out of hiding."
Draco blinks down at his knees. He wants to go back to the fun playful way they’d spoken to each other before. It was just a few minutes ago and now it feels like hours. Days. Would every conversation they tried to have eventually spiral into something like this? Good intentions dissipating like smoke and revealing a chasm too daunting to build a bridge across?
Spine straight, chin raised,
Old Scrivenshaft looks as alarmed as Draco feels. “My word! Lad, are you alright?”
"Definitely not," Draco agrees. "You’d be a fool to think so."
with Father Christmas,” Draco begins, careful to staunch his sarcasm. “I notice you’ve brought the hat with you." Hangingbone glances down at it, the thin hand bracing her desk curling into a fist. "If you don’t mind, I’d like to try again. I think there’s may have been something wrong with it the first time.”
"Draco..."
"I never made you feel like a peasant, Draco." The use of his name leaves Draco momentarily stunned, his mouth moving stupidly, gaping, as he tries to find words to brandish against the assault.
"For the record, he doesn't hate you either. But he does think you're a prat."
"I thought you weren't so desperate as all that." Harry shivered as Malfoy's warm breath fanned across his lips.
"Ministry escorts? You mean an Auror detail?" Weasley glances around the bakery, obviously hoping to catch sight of another prat in red robes. Like they’re impossible to spot. He turns back to Draco with suspicion. "I don’t see anyone here, Malfoy."
Fatigue does nothing to dissuade anyone from finding Potter handsome. It just changes the type of handsome, enhancing other features of his face to distract from the ones that dim his usual brilliance.
“Yes, I’m—” There’s a dull ache all down his back, his right shoulder throbbing when he tries to move it. Draco hisses as he sits up. “I’m fine. You?”
"Well." Malfoy shrugged. Closed the distance between them. "Magic doesn't solve
Potter doesn’t look like he believes it and really he ought not to, but it still makes Draco bristle knowing Potter can constantly see through him.
"That makes sense." And it does. It's one of the reasons Draco encouraged Theo to come stay with him once their fathers were sentenced, despite knowing Auror Abernathy would be another one of the conditions. Loneliness is a great motivator.
Draco squeezes a bit of lemon juice onto his greens. "I have to admit I wasn’t expecting it to be quite this good."
up, they’d just manage to lip read the conversation. Since Hogwarts was built, generations have passed through this house in hopes of emulating their Founder’s parseltongue skills and as the obsession passed down the line, so did a growing fetish: lips. mouths, tongues. It’s a running gag that one can tell how just how adept their partner is with their tongue by the curve of their cupid’s bow. It’s also made several Slytherins, bi- and tri- lingual, which meant that there was really no means of communication that would be safe for them to have without leaving the room completely. “We’re going to my dorm so we can speak in private.”
"We've been doing much worse as wizards. We cut the tentacles off of murtlaps and then turn around and feed it to them when we need a bit of good luck."
Potter’s sitting down at the table, sandwiched as usual between Weasley and Granger. As if she can sense his gaze, it’s Granger who catches Draco’s eyes with her own. She seems to consider him for a moment, like she’s mulling something over before Potter says something that pulls her attention. It’s just as well. Draco wants to stay clear of her too. He’d written Granger over the summer towards the end of his probation, too cowardly to approach her on his own while they’d been taking part in the reconstruction. He’d told himself he was waiting for the right moment, but it seemed the right moment never presented itself and he’d justified the wasted opportunities as a sign that his written apology would be enough. Guilt pulls at him.
Potter grabs his arm and pulls him back to down. “I don’t know what that was about!” he hisses. “It just happened!”
Draco shakes his head. “I don’t think we need it anymore.” He allows himself to shook Harry a knowing smirk. “You’re so transparent, I can read you like a book.”
“Wrapping presents?” Draco bites back a grin. At the Manor, the elves were in charge of wrapping all the gifts. However Pippi, one of the elves who’d spoiled Draco the most, allowed him to fold the sharp creases when his parents were not looking, to hold the corners while she performed sticking charms. He supposes it’s one of the reasons he loves folding paper so much. “I manage.”
"I suppose you’ve sold the Black Home," says Draco's mouth, wholly and entirely without his permission.
The three of them are led to the table and seated just as the remaining guests arrive: Terry Boot, who Draco remembers as being agreeable enough at school, and Romilda Vane, remembered almost exclusively for her obnoxious attempts to garner Potter's attentions.
"Of course. If you can brave the public’s hostility, the least I can do is extend an olive branch to my own sister. She returns the pressure of his hand with her own. "Take care tonight. Summon Coopey if you need anything."
Draco scuttles back as the flames burst a brilliant green once again, Lovegood stepping out of the fireplace. She moves aside and Blaise steps onto the hearth, brushing near-invisible soot from his rather appropriately coloured charcoal blazer.
To his credit, Harry looks like he tried very hard not to snort before he fails. He pulls Draco back down. “We’ll leave for Andromeda’s early. I’m sure your Mother’s looking forward to seeing you.”
“What about at night, when we’re sleeping?” Potter insists on invading Draco’s space, however subtle as he slides closer to him on the bench. Draco eyes flit around, but no one seems to be watching them as Potter continues. “You kicked me out last night but I think we ought to try sleeping in the same bed. Just to see how it affects things. Maybe it will-- why are you mad?!”
Potter pauses, a crease between his brows. "Why would I? My godfather left it to me."
"Draco? Answer your floo, you sod, I'm not down here for my own health." Blaise's head appears.
he’s ever met, after Potter. He pulls his laces tighter and makes a concentrated effort not to watch the dark head as it circles the ice. “Apparently the helpless damsel routine hasn’t lost its touch.”
“Hmm?”
“A Santa hat?” Dean Thomas asks incredulously. A few students turn to blink at him, then Hangingbone, seeking confirmation.
"I wouldn't put it past the muggles in charge of this disaster," Draco grimaces. "But I don't think so. Perhaps it'll be cool outdoors?"
“I’m close,” Draco rasps. He wants to take his prick out so he can get off properly. Even better, he wants Potter’s out — to feel the solid weight of his prick in his hand, to feel the precum dribble from the tip and slick it up, nice and wet with his fingers. To press the pad of his thumb into the slit the way Draco does when he’s alone. But there’s no time for that as Potter buries his head in Draco’s neck, and the feel of his soft lips, the hot puffs of air and the knowledge that Potter is just as turned on, that Draco is the one who’s made him so hard, is too much and the coil wound tight in his belly, snaps, hot and dizzying.
“When have you been to Hufflepuff?” Potter leans forward, eyebrows drawn. He’s genuinely curious and Draco’s tempted to string out the answer and enjoy Potter’s rapt attention.
He reaches
Swallowing his irritation, Draco
"You’re the one who asked." Right now, Draco doesn’t mind the comparison to Granger. It’s reassuring to have some confirmation that he hasn’t completely lost his mind. "Wasn’t it your idea to be open-minded?"
“No, you’re not,” Draco answers coldly, rising from his seat.
"And I suppose you wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?"
“Hmm, not really. Mother usually has a preternatural way of knowing exactly what I want before I think of it myself but I--” Draco stops himself. He doesn’t want to let Potter know that he hasn’t heard from his Mother in weeks. That he still doesn’t know if he’s doomed to spend his Christmas hols in the gloom of The Manor or the lonely halls of an empty Hogwarts. “--I haven’t managed to make a list yet. You?”
Dizzy and confused, Draco wobbles to his feet and does just that.
Draco shakes his head. “Not tonight.” It’s silly, but Draco feels content bringing Potter off. He’d wanted to do it, got off on the way Potter had squirmed and panted, the way he’d tasted. Draco was already anticipating the next time. The chance to feel the weight of Potter’s prick on his tongue. “You don’t have to.”
"Well, well, well. What have we got here?" Pansy Parkinson settled down on a cushion across from them, dressed in a skimpy red nightie that failed to leave much, if anything, to the imagination. Draco observes Potter's eyes as they run a quick glance down the length of her body and he shoots Pansy a hateful look.
He gives the words a few moments to hover between them for dramatic effect. When the beat ends and Potter still looks as if he’s trying to solve a very difficult math problem, Draco runs a flustered hand through his hair. Potter’s eyes follow the movement with what appears to be great interest. Draco watches as he licks his lips. Potter’s cupid bow is extremely well-defined.
Draco tilts his head and feels his neck click.
Ernie raises an eyebrow. “Could have fooled me.” He looks around the courtyard in a way that Draco
"I suppose you think it’s nowhere as bad as trying to use me as your arm piece. Like my friendship is some kind of badge of honor!"
“I’m being careful,” Draco frowns.
Potter leans in, lowering his voice. “Don’t you remember what Hermione said? We have to spend time together to offset the curse. Are you sure it’s a good idea to bugger off to McMillan’s dorm after.. Everything?” There’s definitely an odd lilt at the end of his words that wasn’t there before.
What a strange choice of words. He'd already forgiven Malfoy of much worse. The thought of it made his chest grow tight. "Am I keeping you?" Harry rose to his feet. Congratulated himself on sounding casual when impulse made him add, "Hot date?"
"It's standard procedure, Malfoy."
“How could I be, when you launch into enough histrionics for the both of us?”
Weasley’s still frowning. "Harry may have mentioned it in passing."
"Shut up," Draco growls out, mulishly wrapping his arms around his knees.
Draco bites his lip as he climbs to his feet. Behind him, he can hear Hangingbone continuing to thump and flail as he holds out his hand to help Harry up. “And I just wanted to say,” Draco says, tightening his grip on the warmth of Potter as he levers his weight, “Is I hope you know a good drying charm.”
The satisfaction Draco entertains, at the idea of watching Potter get booted from tonight’s proceedings on account of obviously being in the wrong location, is short-lived; Karrey arrives mere seconds later to collect Potter’s wand, all but confirming that yes, it is in fact Harry Potter's seat, and yes, thank you Mr. Draco,there is nothing wrong with Karrey’s eyesight, please sit down.
Blaise doesn't bother to hide his amusement this time. "We've already moved past the introductions and onto the small talk, my friend. Help yourself to a drink?" The side of his mouth lifts. "You look quite thirsty."
Opening that morning's copy of
Properly medicated, Draco tampers his irritation long enough to give Madam Pomfrey a polite nod as he slips on his shoes. He likes the school’s matronly nurse — the way she never asks too many questions and doesn’t allow for opportunities of bias to keep her from efficiently doing her job. She’s almost laughably Hufflepuff, with her kind mannerisms and parental rebukes. Pomfrey reminds Draco of the nurse he’d had as a child at the manor, when his parents had decided they’d rather have him forego nursery school for a private tutor. The transference of those feelings of affection has resulted in an unquestionable deference when in the hospital wing, that Draco would never admit to if asked.
+++++
And that’s the real problem, isn’t it. Somewhere deep down, Draco wants that to be true. He’s starting to feel possessive of Potter. To enter that dangerous zone where the time they spend together isn’t just fun and games, or for the sake of moderating their magic and keeping each other in balance -- he wants Harry Potter of his own volition. And as impossible as he knows it to be, he wants Harry Potter to want him back.
"Harry's always had stubborn focus," Chang says, in a winning attempt to keep the cheer in her voice from sounding too forced. "I think it's a bit of a seeker trait. Makes sense that he has a thing for them."
“Pleasure? I suppose i’m not opposed to it, but that’s hardly something I’d discuss with

"I’m not sure." Draco glares down at his hands, lips pulled into a thin line. He forgot to put his gloves back on and his hands have quickly become filthy, the dark of the soil staining dark under his nails . "It doesn’t matter. The whole affair
“Corrupt, the whole lot of ‘em!” Another person shouts, and a noise of agreement goes around the crowd, drowning out the few good samaritans who try to drag their loved ones away, reminding them that it’s Christmas.
"I'm just stating a fact," he smiles. "Look there, I think I see someone."
+++++
“I said I know,” Potter laughs, the berk. “I really don’t mind if you think I’m a freak Draco.  You’re one too. I’m starting to like it.”
“Done something,” Potter repeats, eyebrows raised. He huffs loudly, taken back. “You’re out of your mind.”
He's at Hogwarts.
"Oh, piss off."
“Hello, hello, all.” Hangingbone seems distracted, a stiffness in her movements as she unwinds her scarf. She discards it, reaching back into her bag to pull a few sheets of parchments, a bit of self-writing chalk, and then Draco spots it. The hat.
“No you’re not. You’ve been trying to restore your reputation, and people are going to take your feelings for Harry and assume it’s a stunt to make yourself look better. All the mess they’ve said about potions and love spells? And what happens when he decides to break it off?”
“She’s all over him!” Pansy juts her chin towards the center of the rink where Parvati has an arm draped over Anthony’s shoulder, giggling nervously as he takes the lead and guides them slowly across the ice. “You know she knows how to skate? She and Padma took lessons! Her uncle negotiated the deal for the rink at Rockefeller Center!”
Theo invites himself along, and the three of them spend the afternoon in the orchard, where Neville shows him a potion formula that clears the yellow mildew from their trunks, instantly brightening the apples that are weighing down the branches. Draco climbs -- he's always adored climbing, sitting up in the trees to survey all that he could see -- and at the end of the day sends Longbottom home with an entire burlap sack of gold, silver, fuji, and red delicious. Even a few strips of bark, so that Longbottom can show a friend interested in examining the magical properties within.
"Have you ever stopped to consider this from the other direction?" Blaise props his elbows on his knees. "Potter only joined Squill & Spoon the week before you did. Since his first supper with you, you continue to show up in his rotation like clockwork."
"Which is...?"
“Oh, yes, Saint Potter! Never a dull moment around you and your savior complex!” Draco spits, his tone venomous. “You just love lording it over everyone, don’t you!”
His stomach nowhere near full, Draco chucks his spoon back into his bowl and rises from the table, glowering at everyone who crosses his path until he reaches the doors. He has no classes until late afternoon, and suddenly the idea of leaving the castle for a few hours feels extremely tempting.
"Rather presumptuous of you, don’t you think? Not that I’m surprised." Draco says with no real bite. He’s actually rather stunned and needs a moment to process the information. Perhaps pinpoint the exact moment in Potter’s timeline where they’d gone from drawing their wands on each other to a friendly negotiation of terms. And how would these new terms affect his wanking privileges? "I suppose I’m not entirely opposed to it," Draco hedges after a moment’s deliberation, "Whatever not being enemies would make us."
Draco bites his cheek. Trust Pansy to withhold that pertinent piece of information from no one but him. Draco had indeed had lunch with in the Ministry Atrium with Terry Boot after he'd cornered Draco coming out of his Mind Healer's office. Boot had even talked his Auror detail into sitting at another table where they'd be well within his eye line. When Draco had risen to leave, Boot pulled him into an alcove and kissed him, a tepid experience that left Draco feeling as if he'd dragged slimy murtlap tentacles across his mouth.
Laughing, Draco shoves Harry towards the water, and it’s only when he doesn’t let go of Draco’s hand, pulling him over the edge of the dock with him, that Draco truly feels for the first time since Potter approached him that afternoon in the library, that things will be alright.
, was the first time they'd fucked,
“Fuck, wait.. wait.” Withdrawing a shaky hand, Potter guides Draco to straddle both his legs, so that when he arches, a delicious frisson of heat shoots down Draco’s spine as their cocks move together. Potter shudders. “Shit.”
Hangingbone’s eyes are overly bright, as she looks from Draco’s face down into the water. “Do you think so, Mr. Malfoy?” Her voice is low. “I’ve found true nature will always show itself in one way or another.”
home if that’s what she’s afraid of. My mum and Greg the Muggle™, have a place in Islington that is perfectly on the up and up.” She rolls her eyes. “Goodness, I thought Ravenclaws were supposed to be the smart ones.”
They all turn their heads to watch Weasley as he exits the fireplace, dressed in plaid pajamas that match obnoxiously with the orange shade of his hair. The entire effect is eye-searing, Weasley intolerable to look at for more than a few seconds at a time.
It’s like his touch trips a wire, unleashing something wild in Draco that has his hands on Potter at once, rucking up his jumper to pull the tails from his trousers.
A reward? A threat? Draco’s not sure what to make of it. If his mother’s sent it to him, surely his father would know, and if his father’s heard what’s going on despite an entire ocean situated between them, Draco has a lot more to process than whether or not he plans to have the loss of his virginity forced upon him by his parents of all people. “Just something she thinks will be helpful.”
"I’m sure I don’t know what you mean." He focuses on the dents his boots make as he treads across the grass, spying on Pansy out of the corner of his eye, hyper aware of her eyes
Finnigan lets out a low whistle, his eyes wide. "They're really going all out, aren't they?"
From the back of the classroom, a chair scraps the floor with a metallic sound that draws every eye. Just five minutes into class and with the two of them at odds, it was resembling Wimbledon.
Draco crosses his arms. He’d been
You’re not serious.”
“Don’t make fun of me, I— for gods sake Weasley, here.” Draco reaches across Harry and threads the needle himself, his moments swift as he ties one end of the string off and shoves them back at him.
Draco narrows his eyes, studying Potter’s face. He’s avoiding Draco’s eyes, but his mouth set in a stubborn line. It’d be easy for Draco to place his hand on Potter’s cheek, to close the distance between their lips.
"But tonight?" Draco emphasizes. He knows perfectly well after his last talk with Parkinson, there's no way her turning up is a coincidence. Who did she have to bribe to get the invite and why the hell hadn't it worked for Draco after pressing into Headland?
Prompt:
. There's a photo of Potter looking distracted in his training robes, gazing past the camera as someone shakes his shoulder, trying to get his attention. His glasses are smudged.
Draco holds it up to the light, the sun hitting the platinum sharp and bright. The engraved M curves at the ends, ornate and grand. “My father’s signet ring.”
Draco shuts his eyes, grips the base of his prick to bring himself back down.
They don’t hold hands or anything so obvious, but heads swivel in their direction anyway as they walk through the halls. Harry brushes the back of hand against Draco’s as they walk, bumping shoulders,

"I think Hermione has been talking to them again. Something about making the menu more diverse."
“You’re welcome.”
“You’re just mad because he’s the only beater to hold his average the whole season,” Draco pats Ernie’s shoulder with mock sympathy. “If it were you out there, you’d have already been knocked off your broom.”
“We both may have been a bit…
"I'll wait until we're seated, thanks."
"Please. You’d have done the same if you’d thought of it fast enough."
+++++
“Or something,” Potter laughs. “Pervert.”
Potter raises an eyebrow. "You've no proof of that."
Draco continues buttering his toast. He’s in good spirits and awoke this morning feeling practically ravenous. He’s currently on his fourth slice, and if the combined Malfoy-Black blood didn’t ensure that he’d always remain svelte, Draco thinks he’d have reason to worry. “You do not. You love every excuse it provides you to decorate based on a theme.”
Of course he says none of this out loud. Draco’s not looking but he can tell his silence makes his friends uneasy.
They watch as Ernie walks back into the castle, Harry coming around the side of the bench. It’s apparent he doesn’t plan to take a seat. Draco’s eyes harden.
Potter hurriedly steps out of range, likely afraid that he might be next.
In an unusual show of tact, Potter doesn’t say anything, but claps a firm hand on Draco’s shoulder and squeezes. Draco meets his eyes and they nod in unspoken acknowledgement, understanding passing between them. Every day it feels more natural, the message loud and clear: they’re in this together.
“So, err, have you asked for anything special this year?” Potter pauses near the entrance to Honeydukes as they pass, and they both take a moment to breath in the warm vanilla scent of sweets and toffee as it wafts towards them.
“Alright, then.” Professor Hangingbone stops once they reach the end of the dock and clasps her hands together.
"Blaise tells me you've been feeling down." Lovegood’s smile is soft and as she leans down to brush Draco's shoulder. "He's right. There’s a bit of Pogrebin hair on your jumper."
Draco raises his chin and walks with all the aplomb and poise he’s ever been taught. He’s relieved when he spots not only Blaise and Pansy, but Ernie waiting for him on the end of the eighth year table. He drops wearily into the seat next to Pansy who pulls his arm as soon as he draws within range.
Potter rolls his eyes, but carves a small piece all the same and brings it to his mouth. The fork slides between his lips and his head tips back, eyes fluttering as they slide closed.
“Ernie?” Turns to face on the bench to face him. “I thought he was still on bedrest?”
“My hand slipped,” Potter starts to explain, raising his chin. But Malfoy’s not going to play that game.
Draco scowls. Cho and Weasley were both back to back. Wood and Diggory weren't a thing until after Hogwarts, although looking back the hints were definitely there. It makes sense. Maybe it explains why Draco's been so stubborn too. He's still fixated on Harry even now. Neither of them are seekers anymore.
Draco rises onto his elbow. "You don't own me an apology, Harry."
“I’m not!” Draco says through clenched teeth, turning to face forward again. Fucking Potter. He should have known he’d have some kind of ulterior motive for insisting they spend time together. But to suggest something like this just because he wasn’t able to have his way last night, was too much.
A thick silence descends. He feels he ought to say something to fill it. On the other hand, why make the effort of polite conversation when they both knew there was nothing to say? He’s sure Weasley would appreciate the honesty and lack of pretense. Draco turns back around to the display.
"Your probation is almost over and these suppers are being presented as neutral ground. If I were expected to re-enter wizarding society and ferret my way into everyone's good graces, it would a good place to start."
“That’s about the time you wake to iron your robes, isn’t it?” Potter asks innocently. “But you must be feeling daring this morning to let us see you with a hair out of place.”
“You’ve had some questions about my Sorting Hat, as well you should,” Hangingbone says. “It’s quite the magical object. A hat that doesn’t judge character based on thoughts, but on emotions. And why shouldn’t it? Emotions are much more genuine.”
A low, rough, voice surprises him. “Has he died in there?” Theo sounds as if the idea tickles him immensely. “Draco Malfoy,” he intones gravely, “if you’ve passed to the other side,

"You lack emotional resonance?" Theo finishes for her, never failing to slip a knife between Draco’s ribs when presented with the opportunity.
Harry snorts. “He’s
acquaintances and I’d say I’ve made a concentrated effort just to achieve that consolation prize.” He keeps his tone light, relishing the way Potter’s eyes narrow at his words, feeling the twist in his gut.
“Don’t phrase it like that,” Potter grouses, his chin in hand. A few yards away, someone has built a snowman, the snow packed unevenly making him lop-sided. Potter swishes his wand and the carrot moves from the center of it’s face to the top of it’s head, like a unicorn.
“It was only supposed to be you, Draco.” Hangingbone steps closer, and he takes a step back. “The Sorting Hat reads emotions, but it uses magical energy to do it. Stores it up. That’s why Father Christmas can check his list — he has so much joy and peace stored up, it wouldn’t be a drain to his body.”
did. You and your vile family, scouring this world with your evil, twisted—”
Walking along the perimeter of the Herbology greenhouses, Draco stares at the newly decorated evergreens. There’s another tree up ahead, bigger and grander than the rest, standing in the clearing where the eighth years are gathered. His eyes instantly find Potter,  flanked by Weasley and Granger as they admire the tree, and Draco passes behind them, pretending to admire the lights.
"Hilarious," Draco mutters, and takes a sip from his water glass to have something to do with his hands.
If one were to like that sort of thing.
to the hospital wing. She has her damn tree.” He juts his chin towards the Christmas tree standing tall and proud in the corner, and doesn’t mention that they hadn’t been able to participate in the tree’s preparation due to the Blaise incident.
Because his first instinct is to be cutting, Draco says nothing at all. Nods.
“Mr. Malfoy.” Another voice drags Draco from his thoughts once again. It’s not exactly a trend he’s keen to continue; not now when he wants to throttle Potter’s throat. Draco rounds on the figure than stops.
Squill & Spoon meets on Saturdays.
Draco snorts. “The pompous, stubborn, fool-hardy ones, you mean.”
freedom and don’t you
On his other side Draco feels, rather than hears, Potter chuckle. “Sorry,” he waves his hand to dismiss the action. His smile looks a little tight around the edges. “Just imagining Ernie taking a ball to the face.”
"I think everyone likes flowers, Harry. Caring for them isn’t exactly rocket science is it?"
Draco frowns. He’s never heard anything like that. Glancing at the others, it seems they’re just as confused. Even Granger raises her brows at Weasley, who shrugs. Behind his glasses, Potter’s eyes are wide.
"I wouldn’t want to bore you." Draco spies Potter watching him out of the corner of his eye, his shoulders tense. The sight of it is like a challenge to Draco, his own muscles growing tight as irritation lances down his spine. "This supper club came highly recommended. I suppose I’ve’ never been opposed to keeping good company."
"He who does not comb?"
"Dining with others has long been proven to have a whole host of restorative properties for witches and wizards," Draco finds himself reciting stiffly. He's back in his room, then, running a finger for the millionth time along the torn pamphlet he’d managed to spellotape back together, if only just. "In the magical world, communal meals serve
, where he’d angrily purchased a square of Alihosty fudge in order to test it against his symptoms. Alihosty, the primary ingredient in Laughing Potions, seemed like the most obvious place for him to start. While it was a long shot to think that someone had possibly snuck the leaf’s essence into his breakfast or hexed him, food related paranoia was something Draco was readily prepared for. Unfortunately, once he’d returned to his room and ran all the diagnostic spells he could think of on both the Alihosty and himself, there were no results strong enough to support his theory. Especially when, in the next moment, a wave of heartrendingly sweet contentment washed over him, despite his frustration.
Not yet, Draco scolds himself, panting. Not yet.
If you want me to stay away from you so badly, then you stay away from me first!”
“Says the person who’s been following me around all year.”
"No. According to Headland’s records, others have reported I’m quite demonstrative. It’s just not as," Draco pauses, considering, "positive," he decides, "as they'd like it to be. Which is why he refuses to sign off on any of my release forms until I can prove otherwise."
He was next. Draco’s straightens, preparing himself for the inevitable when Potter suddenly crosses the circle. He comes to a stop in front of Ernie, using a wandless spell to fan away the smoke as Ernie gasps. Draco steps back, hoping the smoke will obscure his attempt to withdraw.
Draco says nothing and makes another fold.
But of
magic requires skill."
“Yeah.”
“Funny you should say that.” Draco waits for Harry to elaborate but he doesn’t, just turns back to the front as Hangingbone begins the day’s lesson. Draco sighs and starts on his apology letter. There’s only a few more days before hols. If  he and Harry going to get the situation sorted before then, it seems like the most practical place to start.
But tonight, the decision isn't in his hand. He doesn't regret taking those first steps. Sending that first letter. He never did.
"It’s a Sainsbury. Isn’t it lovely?" Why Lovegood chooses to interpret the curl of his lip as anything other than blatant disgust is a mystery.She gives his arm a small tug, her grip surprisingly strong as she leads him down the nearest aisle. "Muggles will eat such wonderfully strange things. Would you like some Goldfish?"
it is, goes both ways, Potter make have some insight into Draco’s thoughts that he’d rather he not, at all.
“Why should I? Why should anyone?” Potter sets his jaw in a stubborn line that resembles more of a pout. Draco shakes his head in bewilderment. He’s not asking Potter to tell the world if he’s not ready: it’s his business and he, more than anyone, has earned the right to his privacy. But telling the one person not in a position to judge him might be a good start. Especially considering he’s the one person, Draco hopes, that knows what Potter looks like when he comes.
Draco feels something inside him wither. "Right." He steps around Potter and stalks away, ignoring the way Opal tries to flag him down. He's almost to the elevator when his arm is yanked back.
Potter settles back onto a cushion and stares. Draco’s breath quickens. Under Potter's ardent gaze, the flush spreads from his face and down onto his neck, an unflattering shock of red that contrasts with the silken silver fabric at his chest. With the way he’s got his gaze fixed so utterly on Draco, there’s no way for Potter to miss it. Still, Draco can’t bring himself to demand that Potter stop, insist he attend elsewhere. Draco likes being looked at when it’s Potter doing the looking.
“Being nasty to each other hasn’t particularly gotten us anywhere either,” Potter says. “Even before the curse.”
add another thirteen inches before a pair of third years accompanied by a burly fifth year trickle into the room and the light that filters through the murky water outside their window is bright enough to justify breakfast.
“Fuck..” Draco takes Potter into his hand, whispers the wandless spell every boy to come through Hogwarts has passed along. Using the flat of his hand, Draco slicks Potter up, thrilling in how
"I’m early. Be a dear, Opal, and see if Headland can be accommodating?"
“Figured that out, did you?” Draco sneers, gritting his teeth. He’d like to start from the other end this time, but suspects the results will be much the same if Potter doesn’t stop hovering. “I’ll be done in a moment if you’d like to go.” The dismissal is as polite as Draco can muster, given that they both know he’ll refuse it.

“Granger?” Draco asks at the same moment Potter chokes, “Together?”

"A friend who's been staying at mine for a few weeks. Ginny finally managed to kicked me out, so I'm back at Grimmauld Place but that house is too large for one person. Figured I could use the company."
“I think that’s Ron’s..”
“Mr. Malfoy, front and center!” Professor Hangingbone’s voice rings out loud and clear, stopping him mid-step. “
Draco sits up slowly. "What have I done now?"

He shakes his head. "Distilled bezoar."
A stiff breeze moves across the surface of the lake as Draco drapes his scarf around his neck and knots it, nuzzling down into fabric that’s been spelled to be soft as a cloud. The ripples work their way towards them, Draco with his arms wrapped around his knees and Potter, on the other end of the blanket, crossed-legged. The light glinting off Potter’s lens’ obscures his eyes, which is just as well - he doesn’t want to know in what direction he’s looking as Hermione repeats herself.
"The lads at the Ministry who cooked up this whole supper business." The steak Karrey places in front of Finnigan sizzles enticingly. "Suppose to be a secret innit? Anonymous donor. There's all sorts of speculation as to who."
Potter snorts, amused. "You’ve got me there."
“Oh..?” Potter says, scratching his cheek.
“Here now, there’s no need to be upset! I just wanted to make sure you weren’t doing anything you shouldn’t!” Draco can barely make out the sound of Scrivenshaft’s cane as he taps it against the floor. “Stop all that crying! Drat!” The cane clatters as he drops it. “Now see what you’ve done??”
Draco allows himself a cursory sweep of Potter's robes, careful not to linger on anything... unnecessary. The fabric looks expensive: a deep jewel green, so dark they're almost black. Obviously bespoke. Perhaps Twilfits, or a designer from off the continent, leaping at the chance to dress the most famous wizard in Britain while charging him through the nose for it.
“I see. You might like them, as far as muggle groups go. They’re very catchy.” Potter smiles at him, a true heartstopping smile that Draco suspects might actually be the death of him if he manages to survive the afternoon. “You’re definitely a Posh.”
“Well whatever the case," Harry says, "we'd rather be on her good side. We still need to talk to her about the curse and she won’t stop looking at you.”
Draco looked down at his silk pants and matching top, both in a silver that matches his robe. The pants are a bit short and he's conscious of how knobby and childish his ankles must look, out on display as they are.
“Do you miss it?” Harry asks. He’s leading them up the staircase that will connects to the fourth floor, where they can take the nearest flight of stairs to the Prefects bathroom.

“Thank you Potter for repeating exactly what I said right back to me,” Draco scoffs. “Is your animagus a parrot?” The withering look Potter gives him makes Draco smirk. “I just mean,” he continues, “that we’ve been looking at things in terms of black and white. Maybe we should be examining the gray area.”
Harry looks down as if he's not sure what Draco is talking about. "Ah. Yeah. I've been working on a lot of things lately, its a bit of a handful. And Henry's been no help."
“Anyone up for a skate later?” Seamus Finnegan calls from further down the table. “We had to cut it short last time but now that Harry and Malfoy are mates, we don’t have to worry about cracked skulls!”
"Which suits you fine enough, since you’re too cowardly to do anything but play games! You assume everyone else is too. I wasn’t trying to lie to you!"
“You know what,” Potter says, visibly annoyed. Good. It make two of them.
Someone attempts to brush the pale hair from his face as Draco takes labored breathes, the pain in his abdomen sharp, throbbing unpleasantly as he inhales. It takes effort to make his eyes focus. He's dismayed that they do so just in time to watch Potter pull the red cap down over his tangled curls, his face flushed. There's a angry pink scratch on Potter's cheek, bringing attention to how bright his eyes are, high as they are with the rush of adrenaline.
The following morning after breakfast, Headmistress McGonagall asks all the eighth years to stay behind in the Great Hall. Draco braces himself for a lecture —he’s been wondering when she’d address the fight after heading about it — but in fact, all McGonagall does is give them the morning off with the task to find a Christmas tree to for Hangingbone’s classroom. Apparently Hagrid, who usually takes it upon himself to decorate the castle for the holidays, has taken time off to visit family (an idea that Draco thinks should alarm more people than it does). The Headmistress presents as a good opportunity for them to work on
Hangingbone doesn’t nod so much as twitch in response. Draco takes that as his cue, and hurries as fast as a dignified walk will allow, to the open seat next to Harry.
The rest of the evening is relatively uneventful. When the last spoon vanishes and the table is clear, Karrey appears and they all rise to their feet. One by one he returns their wands, saving Draco for last, under the rightful assumption that the choice would leave him highly affronted. Draco thanks Lovegood for being gracious enough to eat his pizza, then snatches his wand back with a stamp of his foot that sends the house elf scurrying off.
Professor Hangingbone waves her hands, one flicking fluffy snow from a stone table as the other beckons them. She’s dressed in multiple layers as usual, her long face nearly disappearing into the cowl of her jumper and long coat under her robes.
His arse is in a bin full of apples.
"It’s a form of treatment." Draco climbs to his feet, removing his soiled gardening gloves. He knocks them against his trousers a few times, eyes focused on the ground. "It starts at the end of the week, and I have to do it if I’m to return to any sense of normalcy. There's nothing more to say about it."
that there may be times Potter goes off by himself to have a good cry over things from his past that he can’t change, and the people he loved that he can never get back. Draco feels uncomfortable when he thinks about it, so he doesn’t. Instead he pushes it to the back of him mind, along with the thought that if this,
Within his robes, the glass vials clink against each other, bumping against the outside of thigh. He uses his wand and does a cushioning charm that doesn’t hold. Instead the tubes float weightlessly from his pocket, soft as a marshmallows when Draco grabs them out of the air.
The day is flat and grey outside, making the horizon hard to distinguish between the snow and the sky as he crosses the courtyard. He’d been to the Owlery to send a letter off to his mother, since she’s being unusually stubborn. Stopped by the kitchens for some biscuits, and all manner of meaningless errands to put off the inevitable. He needs to talk to Potter and for once, he doesn’t want to do it while the entire school is watching.
"I'd have to get to know someone before I could make that decision. Overcome differences. Work up to friendship." He pauses, meeting Harry’s gaze straight on. "That's why I'm here."
Draco sneers. Let him stew, then.
Draco exhales, slowly. He’d been so caught up in chasing his own pleasure, he/’d completely missed it. He’s strangely disappointed, but Potter’s wash of satisfaction — and the damp spot on the front of his trousers — doesn’t allow the feeling to linger. And while the sensation of cooling spunk should be unpleasant, Draco’s chuffed to know he lasted longer. The whole affair couldn’t have taken more than a few minutes at best, but as he rolled off of Potter, Draco felt floaty, languid, and at peace in a way he hadn’t felt in days, if not
"Here." Harry hands him a glass of something cool and slushy that looks like a sunset. A thin plastic tube is set inside, curling and bending in several loops, almost as tall as the glass itself. Harry lifts his own almost identical drink to his mouth, hollows his cheeks and sucks.
i'm having a hard time keeping up, lol💦
The words hang in the darkness between them, and true to form, Draco rushes to fill to silence.
"Karrey?" says Draco, voice echoing around the empty room. The elf appears right away. He has an old-fashioned night cap on his head, crooked jauntily to the side.
“Did what?” Potter puts both hands in the air, the picture of innocence. “All I did was offer Ernie a drink.
“Professor?” Draco wrinkles his nose. He’s maybe been down here twice since first year, as there’s not much purpose for visiting. Every September, first years are brought across the water, led by Hagrid’s on the small fleet of boats. It’s more for first impression than anything else — the rest of the year the boats bob sadly in the water, warded off from students and unused, unless Filch or one of the Professors needs to sort out the creatures within the lake. It’s cool and dark down there, the moldy wet smell of twine and sea water filling Draco’s nostrils.
it. You got pleasure out of it.”
"Are you asking me if the house elves are targeting former Slytherins by poisoning their food?" Potter's eyes narrow, and Draco has a fleeting thought of Dobby. Of course the thought would make him angry if he thought it were a serious one.
Blaise shakes his head. "This is reminding me of sixth year all over again."
"Couldn't make them stick, even back at school. Kind of hard to concentrate when you're..." Harry made an aborted gesture with his hand. Cleared his throat. "I mean, magic doesn't solve

"I told you about Boot," Draco says, evenly.
Potter frowns but doesn’t argue the point, hands buried deep in the pocket of his robes. The intensity of his stare is unnerving. It gives Draco the distinct impression that Potter feels entitled to something.
“So what are you guys calling this?” Blaise gestures between them. “Are we ‘
"Doubtful," Draco nods towards Harry.
“Something tells me that owl won’t go for the usual stuff.”

Potter’s face clouds over and Draco instantly frowns. Not this again. “He is my friend you know, it’s not as if I’m never going to talk about him. Thanks to your bloody trick, he’s been keeping his distance from me, so don’t start.”
Well it’s not really like he had a choice. Draco tried asking Headland and Abernathy about taking a weekend off, and had been told it would have to be an extreme circumstance, which would be nothing short of dying or kidnapping the savior and keeping him in this house.
caring. A Hufflepuff to the core. Why not take him up on the invitation?” Draco can tell by the way the fabric pulls that Harry’s making a fists inside his pockets. “After all, I’m not your boyfriend.”
A look of shock, and possibly anger, flits over her plain features before settling into placid interest. “I see. While I would like to grant your request, Draco, I
"The rumpled one."
"I'm asking Draco, but you're welcome to answer if you think you've got one." Millicent doesn't so much as blink under Potter's cold gaze. "I'm sure you wouldn't let something like that happen on your watch but the information's still valuable."
He can feel the way Potter's cock pulses in his grip. He curls his fingers and squeezes. Potter throws his head back, hissing as he nods helplessly. "Nngh, please..!"
"Well that's alright, isn't it?" Theo looks a bit envious at the mention of riding. He'd been to check on Persephone twice already that day. "You suppose you'll be dining on horseback?"
The words don’t echo off the cavernous stones, or hang in the air between them. It’s exactly the opposite. They sink like a stone beneath the surface of the water. Like a heavy object dropped unceremoniously at Draco’s feet. “The plan?”
hot chocolate and pours it into Weasley’s lap. Shocked, Draco watches as Potter deliberately lets the mug drain, shaking off the dregs before putting it down. Weasley shakes off his stupor and jumps to his feet. His entire crotch is soaked. “Harry!?” He shrieks with the indignation of someone who enjoys having a prick and wants to use it again one day.
In the silence that follows, Draco brushes himself off, cursing Abernathy and his faulty aim under his breath while checking the back of his trousers. He’s conscious of Lovegood watching him intently, craning her neck like an exotic bird, her colorful earrings large and garish. There’s a beat, and then another, and in between each of her curious looks, Draco feels the tension in his shoulders building, waiting to see who will speak first. "I assume you’re here for supper."
"Mother."
I appreciate it so much.
On the other side of the table, Pansy looks up from last month’s
A sharp pain traveled up the back of Harry's leg, and he whirled to find Malfoy much closer than before, hands over his ears, eyes wide with panic. His lips were moving frantically, but Harry couldn't make out the words.
"What it’s not about is a guilty conscious." Draco hates repeating himself, but if ever there was an occasion, this warrants it. "These dinners are about leaving my house!" He stabs a finger in the direction of the Manor. "Being able to walk ten feet without seeing an auror, or house elf for that matter, tracking me with their bulbous eyes." He widens his own as he says it, fingers miming binoculars to emphasize
knock twice.”
“Is that so?” The innocence Harry injects into his voice wouldn’t fool Peeves. “Then you must have an idea of where I’m taking you now.”
He glances once more around the circle. All eyes were on him, even Hangingbone’s. They’re slightly manic and he feels hunted as he puts the cap on.
"Just leave it alone, would you?" Draco takes an angry bite, a sour expression on his face that transforms the moment his mind registers the taste of the eggs. They're perfectly cooked fluffy and light, the perfect amount of salt. Bless these bloody house elves. "I'll have to proposition Karrey if he keeps this up," Draco says around a moan.
Probably.
"Because it's temporary?" Potter makes a show of hands his wand off to the elf, who places it inside a small box, emitting a squeaky, "Thank you, Harry Potter". He turns back to Draco. "Don't you think you'd have heard if magical folk were handing over their wands and never getting them back?"
“And why,” Draco asks, with what he knows is a near perfect impression of Narcissa Malfoy’s icy distain, “would you think I have any interest in something like this?”
Draco looks down at his plate. He supposes it Gwarp or the rock cakes. This is what he gets for surrounding himself with more and more people with a low threshold for danger.
. It seems to bubble up in him without any warning, a fit of giggles that come out of nowhere
Draco grabs it
to shakes her head. “There’s no such thing. The last year has made us fast friends and Parvati finds me perfectly lovely to be around. So much so that we’re spending Winter hols together, aren’t we?”
"Mmm, yes. Adequate company, substandard food, harassed by house elves. Karrey has it out for me, I'm sure of it."
His voice sounds closer now. Softer. “I’m sorry.”
It feels good to laugh. Ernie is a good influence that way, his strange, snarky humor one of the aspects that won Draco over. In the last year, he’s discovered that Hufflepuffs can be delightfully petty when all that empathy oscillates in the other direction.
Draco’s still trying to piece together what’s going on as Blaise leads him with Potter in tow over to the corner they’ve commandeered as their own. Potter’s looks around with interest.
"Mimosa?" Pansy holds the pitcher out, looking skeptical.
Draco looks somewhere off to Potter’s left as the words leave his mouth, more to gauge Potter’s response than to set any ground rules. Just because it was his idea doesn’t mean Potter actually
Then he’s back.
"So I suppose they've let you out?"
“So are you!” He shoots back. “And that’s not exactly a leap considering out history.”
The truth of the matter is that Draco’s probably make a big deal out of nothing. He’s been through much worse. Had much worse said about him than idle gossip. And he’s about to say as much, when something catches his attention out of the corner of his eye. Up ahead, Potter stops and looks up.
"I practically threw myself at you," she continues. Draco reminds himself to nod to whatever Boot is currently saying. "The last I heard, you were gallivanting around the continent with that dashing Quidditch player. The pierced one."
His cheeks grow hot. "Mother, please.. I'm not a child."
“Help?” Draco arches a fine brow. “Have a friendly chat? We are not friends, Potter. At this point we are
"And the DMLE doesn't care enough to investigate?" asks Millicent. Draco cranes his neck for a better look. Beef Wellington, a safe choice, if a little predictable. "Sounds like they aren't pulling their weight."
“Oh, uh, hey!” He says a bit too cheerful, his eyes wide behind the frame of his glasses. Draco’s seen horses during a thunderstorm that looked less spooked than Potter does in this moment.
“Professor Hangingbone.” He notices a postcard on her desk, an image of London Bridge covered in snow, the tower clock looming in the background. He supposes that's where she must have spent her time away, but given that he's not sure, Draco decides to play it safe. Keep things vague. “Welcome back.”
“We’re not staying here.” Draco knows his housemates. Even if he were to throw a
Draco's stomach flutters uncomfortably. He looks down at his empty plate, Karrey should be coming to clear it away soon. The beater for the Wasps has pierced ears, but that hardly seems exciting.
Draco clenches his teeth, plucking at the blue gingham beneath him. “None of that tells us what we actually have to
Prompt:
He jolts upright, gasping for air as perspiration slides down his back. Hair sticks to his temples as Draco feels for his wand, pulling it from the holster on his thigh to cool himself down. Wearing the holster has second nature to him now, despite how strange it’d felt when he’d first bought it, the way he’d chided himself for his paranoia as he tried it on. It was justified, considering what happened to the Hawthorne.
“Oh, ah..” He turns wide eyes to Potter, and Potter, the great tosser, only manages to shrug back. Clearly he’s used to Hagrid’s aggressive friendliness and doesn’t think that this particular proposal is a hill worth dying on.
“Where are the others?” Draco asks in a low voice, indicating the other beds.
Draco shook his head. It would never happen.
Draco goes still. Maybe? It is almost Potter’s birthday. Certainly friends celebrate those types of occasions together. And if he can’t move freely, it doesn’t mean that Potter can’t. He’s allowed to break all kinds of rules. In his pocket, Draco fingers the gold watch.
handing it back to Scrivenshaft as he sniffs noisily.
“Well, tell Padma if she doesn’t favor Pansy’s, she’s welcome to stay at mine,” Blaise winks, settling back. “Bit low on bed space though, so we’d have to share.”
His eyes never leaving Draco’s, Potter summons a house elf and asks it to bring Draco a steaming mug of hot chocolate. It’s mere seconds later that it arrives, Potter adding a few marshmallows before sliding it towards him. Draco takes it with nervous excitement. Blows on it for a moment, then takes a sip. He waits for the compulsion to rise in him, the one that will make him react before he has time to register what he’s doing.
Potter’s hand hovers over the spot Draco knows he keeps his wand, but he doesn’t draw it. Not that he’d really need to - Draco’s seen what he can do without one. Weasley, moves the popcorn to the floor, warily. Apparently they’ve been stringing popcorn for the garish tree sitting in the corner behind them.
Draco bites his lip. He doesn’t know what to think of that. His heart and his libido are running away with their own thoughts as it is. “Tell them you needed time alone to wank or something?”
"So you’ve said... Remember, we're not enemies anymore. I expect you noble types to be truthful."
To his credit, Potter doesn’t immediately look at Draco like he’s barmy, but with the interest of someone expecting a punchline. "Watching you," he repeats playfully.
His wanking habits, for instance.
“How do you know all that?” Draco abruptly throws the curtain aside, feeling his pulse quicken. Three sets of eyes dart to his face in various states of exasperation. Parvati indeed has her bag slung over her shoulder, arms crossed. Pansy leans against the wall nearest him worrying a nail, and Theo looks relatively unfazed, although his brown hair looks as if he's run his fingers through it more than a few times. Draco focuses expectantly on him, his eyes probing Theo to continue.
Shards fly as the champagne flute between them shatters. Then another. It's wandless *
Potter gives him an even look. “I can’t just recreate a life or death situation, Malfoy.”
He leans back. “I remember perfectly fine. I think you’re the one who’s forgotten -- last night,” Draco says with meaning, “-- should be enough to tide us over for now. It’s just a few hours.”
“I--” Weasley looks down as the mass of snowflake covered paper he’s crushed up and tied with a bow. “Oi, I never claimed to be good at this!”
“You’re supposed to love
Harry seems to be thinking along the same lines, as he gives Draco a flat look, rolling his eyes when Draco mirrors the look back at him. “You’re a Slytherin. You know greasing the wheels won’t hurt.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Hangingbone greets him with a frown. It’s like she doesn’t even have the energy to disguise her displeasure, and Draco’s unsure if the source stems from his sudden appearance in her classroom or her having to be there herself.
Draco’s gut lurches. Violently.
It was hard to decide which would be more shocking — if he was pronounced
"You aren’t a death eater anymore!" Harry shouts, sitting up so that the sheets pool into his lap.
Both young men are currently attending their final year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, and it’s been rumored that both Potter and Malfoy have been spending more time together than some would bid proper. School staff has declined to comment, but we at the Daily Prophet will continue to keep you, the reader, informed as more develops.
"Why didn't you ever write me back?"
Potter's laugh surrounds Draco. It's a deep warm timber that travels down his back like a shiver. In comparison, Boot's laugh doesn't even register.
in her outstretched hands. "She likes to show off, you know that."
Draco scowls, applying more pressure. He ought to have recalibrated the damned thing weeks ago, but that meant a trip into Diagon Alley, and as far as he was concerned, Diagon Alley remained off-limits.
“Wanna see you come,” Harry pants, licking his lips. “Want to feel it on my skin.”
Draco is torn between embarrassed sympathy and laughing his arse off. Glancing at Potter finds he’s trying to keep his mouth straight as he spells Ron dry.
He seems to get the message. “Vigorous eavesdropping. Hangingbone dropped by Flickwick’s office to ask him a few questions while he was looking over the schematics for that prototype I told you about.” Theo pauses. Draco expectants he's waiting for one of them to ask for details. When no one does Theo scowls, but keeps going. “Flickwick had me wait outside the room, but didn’t couldn’t be bothered with a simple
"But I’ve suspected for a while now and have only just confirmed it. Karrey, in particular, but the others too— no, don’t look!" Draco snatches Potter’s chin. The rasp of stubble lingers on his fingers when he releases it. Potter hasn't shaved today. "Are you mad? You can’t let on that you know! Then they’ll know that I know."
“Is that The Spice Girls?” Granger points to the topmost album in Draco’s stack. “That’s their new record isn’t it? I’d meant to pick up a copy over the summer.”
to indulge his sweet tooth.
“Alright, what?” Draco
For fuck’s sake.
“So what you’re saying,” Hermione says once they’re done, “is that the two of you need to stick together so that you can keep interacting normally with everyone else without having emotional flare-ups, at the expensive of your magic.”
He gets the zip on Potter’s jeans down in record time, massages the shape of Potter’s prick through the cotton of his pants. He’s long and thick, responsive to Draco’s touch in the way his stomach flutters when Draco slips his fingers under the elastic to grip him properly. Potter cries out, a guttural groan that makes Draco’s own pants tighten as he traces his fingers over the veins.
