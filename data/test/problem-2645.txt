Harry, of course, didn’t like the silence that followed James’ words. He decided that he would throw in a quick barb, seeing as he had been polite for the three minutes that James had been here and that was annoying him. “Or, perhaps, you cannot tell me as I’m a Slytherin and the natural enemy of the entire Gryffindor population of Aurors,” he said, staring directly at James. “Maybe I’m wrong and you simply don’t want your future Death Eater son to have any information regarding the Auror department. I mean, according to you, all Slytherin students are evil and joined Voldemort.”
“And what if it’s reversed?”
“Probably too much,” said Ernie. “Stop changing the subject.”
His toy box was placed off to the side, which only had a few trace amounts of toys in it, not a very creative child in that aspect. A large wardrobe with drawers was under the window, which had a few shirts and pants folded neatly on top of it, as well as a candle.
“What about the Potter Manor?” suggested Severus, wondering why the small Potter family just didn’t live there. “I’m sure that it’d be far more secure than being here, right?”
“You’ll never believe this professor –”
Harry bit his lip, not wanting to offend his mother by stating that he didn’t care for the neighbours and he didn’t wish to interact with them. He had noticed it last year during his time at the Dursley residence. Muggles didn’t like anything that couldn’t be explained and sudden change frightened them. Something floating, which was normal for most witches and wizards, would freak them out and cause them to scream and shout. He remembered how Vernon acted when he saw two woman dating. He shuddered and decided that it would be better to just listen to James’ inane ramblings about the television.
“What do you mean, Peeves?” asked Dumbledore, interrupting the poltergeist. “She’s not hurt, is she?”
“By controversial, you mean Voldemort.”
“You cannot hex a portrait snake.”
“That tap has never worked,” said Myrtle brightly, even snickered when the boy tried to turn it. “I told you.”
Harry coughed. “Anyway, I think we should get this Prefect back to the Great Hall.”
Chapter 23 –
“And Ginny Weasley scores the first goal of the match, ten points to Gryffindor!” Lee Jordan called out.
“I know,” said Harry after a moment of silence, mentally wondering how the professor knew he was there. “I was just walking by and I heard some noise. I thought that it may have been a younger student that’s lost. Hogwarts is a big place.”
“That’s the only thing that you noticed was missing? The fireplace is also gone, instead we have thicker warming charms and some kind of furnace,” said Draco. “You were obviously in here before all of us and you only just realized. Merlin.”
Pansy grabbed Draco’s arm and tugged him along, “I know what happened, he told me earlier, I shouldn’t have been so oblivious to it.”
Harry ignored the slight banter, knowing that the two goons wouldn’t have anything to say besides a grunt. He chewed on his toast, which was coated in butter and had a thin layer of jam on it. He turned towards Draco, swallowing the last bite, and frowned. “I have something to tell you,” he said simply. “But before that, you – Nagini, leave my toast alone. I doubt it’ll do you much good. I’ll get you something soon.”
his family. No matter what I do, he always has something bad to say… No matter, though, the Portkey isn’t here.”
Lily broke down into tears, unsure of what she should say or do. “Three days, James,” she said. “Three days and we haven’t found him yet.”
Pansy blushed slightly, following Potter’s gaze towards Daphne, who was giving her a curious look.
“Harry, don’t – stupid child!” said Professor Snape, holding the bridge of his nose. He glanced around and realised that the Slytherins, mainly the second-years, seemed as if they already knew and some appeared awed. The Ravenclaws looked appreciative that someone so young had mastered mind magic and was able to use it effortlessly. The Hufflepuffs were still concerned about the cat. Gryffindors were in an uproar at the use of ‘Dark Magic’ on the Boy Who Lived.
“So you don’t think he’s evil?” said Neville. “Ron does, and Hermione thinks he has something wrong with him, but I know that he’d never really harm anyone.”
“Checkmate,” said Narcissa, a very smug grin filled her facial expression, the groan her son made was just adding to it the more time went on. She barely gave her son time to analyse what she did before she swept her wand and the pieces tucked themselves away. “It’s something that I, personally, have always wanted, something that isn’t very common and would have most confused or incredibly happy. Now, off to bed with you, it’s late and you need your concentration for tomorrow.”
“He is not joking,” said Clara, her eyes shining in amusement. “He is clueless!”
“– even has a pet snake,” continued Ron, glancing towards said snake. “The theory adds up, y’know, and none of us are mad. It’s stupid, I know, but the pet snake –”
“A stray?” he asked, looking at the dog with an amused expression as if it could understand. He bent his legs slightly, lowering his height. “Quite a nice looking dog for being a stray, though. Looks like you were groomed earlier today.”
“Your point, Potter!”
Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signalling the start of afternoon classes.
“Yes,” said Lily. “What did you get on your exam results? I was so excited to get mine that I almost fainted!”
“It seemed jumbled…”
“ALBUS,” Harry yelled and wrapped his arms around Dumbledore. “I’m so sorry for what I did… whatever it was.” Tears streamed down Harry’s face.
“Honestly? Not so much… at least, not to the level you are,” said Harry. “Emotions are tricky for me to explain due to my status as an Occlumens. My brain works differently to yours because I can, well, filter everything. Then again, Occlumency works differently for each person, so there may be someone out there who is more empathetic. To use your own example, when I look outside, I don’t see sun or rain. I see clouds.”
“You do?” said Harry, twirling the brown wand between his fingers. “Before you get into it, do you know much about wandlore?”
“Isn’t Gilderoy Lockhart teaching this year?”
“Smith, Sally!” called Professor McGonagall.
“Me,” said Harry, already seeing Hermione Granger walking towards him. “What have I done now?”
Harry stood, scowling. “I’m not sure who you think you are, professor, but I’m not a child that needs to be babysat. I’m not sure why you think I’m going to listen to you, but I’ll deal with this myself and I’ll be fine,” he said fiercely, pulling out his wand and shoving open the door. “Just try and stop me.”
“I believe that the sword reacts badly to anyone who has any sort of Ill-intentions,” said Dumbledore. “Mr. Potter obviously wished to hurt someone using the sword and it’s simply heating, magically, and pushing a burning sensation outwards, making the holder drop the sword.”
James turned towards Albus Dumbledore, who was happily stroking his beard. He found it amusing that the man did it, even when he was in school, when in deep thought. He wondered if it was a habit the wise man had yet to break. He went to open his mouth, preparing to repeat his question, when said man turned towards him with a smile and said the most obvious solution ever. He gave a nodded, prepared his body, and Disapparated.
“Can we move? I feel sick,” said Ron, holding his nose with one hand, and the other on his stomach. He had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in mid-air before them.
Harry debated whether he should actually cast it or do it silently like he had been practising. He knew that Tom told him that he should cast it nonverbally to assert himself as a powerful and competent wizard that could already cast dark spells nonverbally, but he felt that he was giving Pansy a massive amount of trust with that’s secret.
“I have no idea, that’s why I’m looking for him, if you happen to see Harry, send him my way, I’ll either be in my office or in my classroom.” Severus turned to Blaise, “keep your hands to yourself or off Draco, if Harry walked in I doubt he would use his head and think it wasn’t sexual, and Harry doesn’t know the relationship you two share.”
“I see,” said Lily. “And you and Sirus were intelligent, your marks proved it. Remus was quite smart, but you and Sirius were top of the year.”
Professor Snape sighed. “You may breathe, you imbecile, just not loudly!”
Harry snorted. “From what I learned throughout the holidays from the very few pure-blooded Slytherins, it’s that our house was dubbed as evil… dark… strange. We were, of course, forced from such things,” he said slowly, his tone light. “All I ask, and it isn’t much, is that you assist me in getting a study group between Slytherin and Hufflepuff going. Only first-years, we needn’t rush for other years.”
“Then how did you mean it?” said Harry. “Exactly. Please teach the lesson and quit trying to determine whether I’m using the knowledge of Muggles for some kind of dark and evil rituals.”
“Worry not, headmaster,” said the Hat. “Slytherin will prove to be the hardest challenge will ever face.”
“Why do you think Professor Dumbledore dislikes me?”
The worst thing is that no one knew what was causing the students to be petrified and you can be certain that every student that went home asked about it and studied as hard as they could about anything that could petrify.
“That explains Weasley’s annoyed expression, but it doesn’t explain why Longbottom’s so upset over a broken broom when he can afford to buy thirty of them without even fearing that he’s dipping into a percentage of his money.”
“Did I do something wrong?” Harry pouted.
,’ said Tom. ‘
bathroom impressed him.
“Everyone thinks Longbottom is so smart, wonderful Longbottom with his stupid broom and his stupid scar –”
“You are correct,” said the man, sitting down slowly. “I saw that you were quite enthralled with the small fight you saw. It is not every day that a young person will stop to stare an art that is quite old, quite forgotten, and takes more time to learn than what they desire to give. I was not going to approach you, at first I assumed you were mesmerised by the uniqueness of the art, but then I looked within, consulted the winds, and caught sight of a dulled flame inside you. You are quite like me. We both walk towards the flame. Our affinity, our magic, our soul is the Flame. Your Flame has been dulled, nearly extinguished. I must aid you, so it may become a roaring Flame.”
The moment the door banged shut Neville and Ron jumped from their hiding position. “Bloody hell!” said Ron, looking around. “We’re in trouble now. No Dumbledore. They might as well close the school tonight. There’ll be an attack a day with him gone.”
“About once a month,” said Death. “I see you’re a Parselmouth… how interesting. It makes this whole step so much easier. Find a snake, a venomous one, and bond with it. You’ll need its venom.”
“He’s a vampire, which he is,” said James. “Believe it or not, Knockturn Alley was named after him. Likewise, Diagon Alley was unnamed and they had no idea what to call it, so they just named it what it was: an alley that was built diagonally. It was never meant to be a stupid play on words as you said. The original meaning was just lost in time and no one cared.”
,” hissed Nagini angrily. “
Harry, Neville and Ron all followed. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.
“Hey!” said Draco, his eyes narrowed. “Try and be a little less offensive.”
“More rumours,” said Atieno. “Powerful vampires can have children, but only the female. The weakest male could somehow impregnate the most powerful female. Isabella von Karling, for example, gave birth to a vampire son who ended up ruling the von Karling vampiric bloodline. That, however, is extremely confidential.”
Harry hadn’t been having an easy time of things ever since that announcement that happened in the morning. He was almost one hundred percent certain that Dumbledore had orchestrated the whole thing on purpose. It made sense, even more so when he knew the Headmaster was out to get him. There was an underlying tone of mistrust and that meant the idiotic masses of stupid teenagers would use that distrust as a weapon.
Severus decided he would go back and collect Draco, and hopefully Harry would have been found and dealt with. Severus opened the door and thankfully Draco was still sitting there, “Draco, come with me.”
“Thought it was very well done,” said Harry. “Especially when she started crying and claiming that if she was held any longer, her father would start looking into it himself.”
“Do you think he told the rest of them that our castle is ugly?” said Harry, watching as the rest of the students from Beauxbatons stepped out of the carriage. “A warning so they don’t outwardly offend us by screaming or crying at the sheer sight of the castle?”
“Cute little nose,” mocked Pansy. “I never noticed it, but you do have –”
“You’ll never learn from your mistakes if you push them onto others, Theo.”
“You’ve been spending too much time with Potter, mate,” said Ron, slowly moving towards the pipe.
“Why are you telling me this?”
“I think it’s nice,” said Harry. “It feels like home.”
Draco snorted. “Higgs, Harry and I would like to take a quick look at you-know-what.”
unicorns are. Even if a werewolf happened to defy this, and caught a unicorn, the moment the werewolf split the skin and caught the werewolf, it’d die the moment the blood hit the werewolf’s lips, driving the beast mad.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he should do, nor say, and so he just nodded and tilted his as the man twisted on the spot and fled from the darkened alley with billowing robes. ‘A lot like Professor Snape,’ he thought, holding the snort. He sneaked towards the corner of the alley and peered his head around the brick corner, wondering if he’d see the man standing there. ‘Of course not.’
“If it’ll help,” said Draco. “C’mon, Nick.”
“You manipulated the hat?”
“Oh, be quiet,” said Draco. “It was obvious that Dumbledore was going to change his mind. The entire school rallied against him.”
. Not sure where mum went, I think she went to an all-girls school or something like that.”
Harry snorted. “Be quiet and eat your breakfast, you need all the nutrients to grow into a healthy young man, as your mother has said frequently.”
“Why are you smiling, Draco? You never smile unless you’re planning something.” Harry debated for a moment. “No. NO! You’re not doing that!” He hissed and narrowed his eyes at the blond, who held his hands up in surrender. “Not now, not ever!”
“You’re going to knock your cauldron off.” Harry said softly to a Slytherin girl, she noticed and grabbed it just in time and smiled at Harry, Snape glared at him, “I was saving her from blowing it up, she is a Slytherin after all, and you don’t want to remove points from your own house.” Harry said it enthusiastically, knowing Snape cannot do much. “Does it pain you to know now that you cannot remove points off Gryffindor anymore for my actions?”
“I didn’t think vampires could breed,” said Harry, gently sliding the scroll back into the middle of the wooden table. “It makes very little sense because you lot supposedly have no blow flow and you need blood to –”
“– once woke up naked in the Slytherin common room with everyone pointing and laughing at me.”
“I’m not sure,” she said half-heartedly. “I think it would be better to just remain here and lay low. If we owned a shop, or appeared to be in Hogsmeade frequently, he’d grow suspicious, especially with how we escaped his clutches and then he could turn on you, and I’d never want that.”
He would look at those doors as soon as he got the chance.
“Argus!” said Dumbledore loudly, walking between the students, sweeping by Neville, Ron and Hermione. “There’s no need to accuse students.”
. Trying to learn a bit more about Quidditch.”
“Indeed it does Molly, cannot wait to eat it!” Harry said eagerly, knowing of course it wasn’t for him, he already expected it when she gave him toast.
Harry looked out the window and watched the scenery change from busy streets to seemingly peaceful land quiet backroads, with a forest leading off the side. The carried wasn’t bumpy or rough, it was smooth and relaxing. Off to the side he saw a large waterfall, the water looked almost clear; it fell into a smaller river that curved around the cliff side.
“I didn’t see you there, Wood, I hope I didn’t interrupt anything,” said Harry, a very fake smile appearing on his face. It widened when the entire Gryffindor team spun around to face him.
“If we attack them like you desire to, we may cause severe destruction to homes and businesses,” said Albus, twisting his wand and causing another golem to rise. “We should aim to lure them to us in a controlled environment, using our minds and magic to contain as much damage as possible.”
“It was worth it to see Longbottom hurt,” said Harry as he shoved open the large double doors into the Great Hall. “Of course I’d do it all over again.”
Harry snorted and glanced at Hagrid with a smile. “I simply don’t care what the Ministry has said, you deserve a new wand.” He gestured to Ollivander. “Go on Hagrid, pick a wand that suits you, I’ll pay for it. This is how I’m paying you back for you bringing me into this world, without you, I would still be in that cupboard.”
“And those two are Ivan Volkov and Pyotr Vulchanov,” said Vasily, pointing at the two men who looked similar. “Not related, if you’re curious. They’re just so similar.”
“Y-you’re a Legilimens?” said Terence, blinking in shock.
She needed a translator.
“Shut up, Harry!” said Neville with an instant force of rage, he began to shake slightly. “You don’t know anything.”
“You get the spell,” said Harry, leaning closer. “It still looks like gibberish, though. I’ve never seen a spell look quite like that.”
“Follow me,” said Pansy, grasping Harry’s arm as she led him through the dungeons and into the Slytherin common room. “Shut up about not being seen together! Now, there’s more to this situation than just a teenage drama. Sure, I’d love to take her down a peg, but there are just so much more things that are unsaid.”
Harry nodded, already knowing this piece of information from last year when the diary of Tom Riddle taught him everything he knew. He slowly moved around the room, his posture tense and his eyes cautious. It was impossible to guess what could jump out at you at any given moment.
“Was that a jab at us?” said Ernie and Justin together.
Hermione fiddled with the necklace around her neck and threw herself around him. “I’m glad you’re alright!” she said before pulling away. “That was foolish of you!”
“Uh,” said Draco, thinking back to a few people that had seemingly changed their personalities overnight. “Weak point, but I’ll let it slide.”
“Merlin, it’s a library Ronald, don’t yell or Madam Pince will throw us out, she’s already annoyed with us.” Hermione carefully looked around, searching for Harry.
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled, “that’s not exactly for yourself harry, but we will see what we can do, we will have to find a decent professor.”
“If I were to place him in Ravenclaw, and yes, before you ask, the Inner Rowena in me demanded that I take him, would have been able to lead the Ravenclaws with perfection, as the boy is naturally intelligent, due to excessive studying and a sponge like memory. He hasn’t got an eidetic memory, but I dare Assume he comes close, with the assistance of Occlumency. Gryffindor, oh Godric loved the boy, even if the boy wasn’t suited for his house at all, at least in basic terms, Godric wanted him. The boy would have earned the respect needed, especially with his father, for the lions to instantly jump to his defence. Sadly, he would have been the anti-hero in that house, by his minor thoughts, he wants nothing to do with a certain boy, who was sorted into Gryffindor just a few moments before he was.”
“Oh yes,” continued George. “How will poor little Harry Potter ask for help?”
“Did you hear that Freddy?” George said.
Harry, still glaring, ducked under Peeves and ran down the corridor, aware that the other three were following him as he did so. He ran towards the end of the corridor, they slammed into a door, which was closed and unsurprisingly – it was locked.
?” hissed the snake, confused.
“Why not now?”
Harry shifted a few books, moving them as carefully as he could manage without them falling off the sofa or the marked pages being lost. He cleared room for the person who was standing rather awkwardly in front of him. He scooted to the right side of the sofa, tapping the left side with his right hand, gesturing for the person to sit down.
“Prof –”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wouldn’t have guessed it without the book you gave me,” said Harry. “Salazar Slytherin was a great help as well.”
Gemma placed on of her hands onto her cheek and glared at the book. “That’s not even in this book, it says nothing about that!”
Severus was lost in thought, he watched Draco walk off normally to his bedroom, he will pursue it, when Draco woke up.
“You know what I mean!”
!” hissed Nagini, her tone impatient. She slithered around some more and began nudging his cheek with her head. “
“The horses are actually called –”
,” replied Harry. “
He paused unexpectedly, lifting his head as he caught sight of Draco. He bit into his lip and turned left, giving the boy a wide berth. He knew that Draco would be angry, not that they were currently speaking, but it was best to avoid that particular confrontation until they had both calmed down.
Harry rolled his eyes and cut Neville off before the boy could ramble on more about it. “Don’t you think it odd that a shady man who refuses to lower his cloak is in a bar carrying around a rare dragon egg? Most of all, they single handily seek out the oaf and begin speaking about said dragon egg as if they know the oaf will instantly want it. These coincidences just don’t happen.”
“Like that would bother you at all.”
Harry had a confused expression on his face. “I must admit, I’m not very good at culture.”
“Okay,” said Mrs. Mason after five minutes of thinking. “I have no idea. I must say, that one is difficult.”
“You said these games don’t last long,” he said, rubbing his temples. “Are we honestly watching five-year-olds play the game? How do you drop a Quaffle?”
Linfred smiled at the boy, his smile reaching his eyes. “Just think back on a memory, any memory will do, and study it closely.”
Harry sipped his tea, internally debating why no one else was helping themselves to the tea when it was right there. He grinned when his eyes met Granger’s. The class hadn’t even started yet and he was already making her angry.
“If he told you, why don’t you just tell me?”
“Because only Granger and I are taking the classes for it,” said Harry. “We are the only people attending thirteen classes. I doubt she will take up Alchemy and Duelling in her sixth year, as I will be.”
‘Conversation,’ = Thoughts
Voldemort began pacing, “Draco was meant to use the amulet to capture Harry and then he would come to me, the amulet was infused with the Imperius curse. He would come here and leave me the amulet and then go back to Hogsmeade and the spell would end.”
“A prime suspect because he has studied and learned the Mind Arts?”
“Actually,” said Harry. “Most of Salazar’s descendants didn’t attend Hogwarts, but one came and hid the Chamber when plumbing was added. So, technically, you’re probably about the tenth. Let’s see… There’s Tom Riddle, Ginevra Weasley, Myself, Longbottom, Lockhart, Weasley, and then you.”
“In some sense,” said Professor Snape slowly. “According to a recent rumour in the Slytherin common room, a fellow member told Mr. Potter that he was nothing special and that triggered something inside the boy and he ignored everyone in order to focus on studying. Recently, Miss. Parkinson was able to get him to recoin the house at meals.”
Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.
,” hissed Nagini. “
level.”
“Say bye to your brother, Daniel.”
“Draco’s
“Each generation has updated it, adding to the original writings,” muttered Harry. “It’s amazed me to learn just how much land witches and wizards own. Did you know that the Abbot’s, the ones currently attending Hogwarts, once owned the land that Hogsmeade was built on? They owned it in 1342 and held it for almost 200 years before a cocksure heir challenged someone to a duel and bet the land. The Abbot’s lost the land to the Smith’s – yes, the Smith in our year, too – who promptly gave the land, not really needing it, to Hogwarts. It’s why the Ministry cannot really intervene into Hogsmeade, despite the fact they desire to.”
“Been spending as much time as possible with Harry,” said Lily, gesturing to the boy with a gentle hand motion. “As well as other things…”
a bargain,” said Lucius. “They can easily afford to pay my first offer.”
Harry shrugged it off, not really caring, he could learn French if he really wanted, Draco goes there enough as it is. “That’s wonderful, at least your French seems accurate, unlike your native language, which is horrific.”
“Harry and Draco are worse,” replied Terry. “Give them a few minutes and they’ll run out of insults and just glare at each other.”
“What’s an ouroboros?”
“What was your idea?” he asked after a few minutes of silence.
Narcissa knocked about an hour later and got no reply, so she promptly locked the door with a strong locking spell, because Bellatrix was coming over, unplanned of course, it was better for them to be away from her.
“Oy, you!” said a familiar voice of the dwarf that had just left the Potions classroom. “I’ve got a musical message to deliver to Neville Longbottom in person.”
“Shut up, Pansy,” said Harry with a sneer. “Trust me on this. You can rant and moan about it all you like, even complain that it’s pointless, but I assure you that it’s the best course of action, and here’s why.”
Adrian looked like he was about to pass out, “well, congratulations, but at this time I need to give my notes to my girlfriend, I’ll be seeing you guys later.”
“You have a wand in the front of your jumper,” said Robin. “Which isn’t
The door swung open and Lucius bowed, “Yes My Lord?” Lucius was still bowing; he caught a glimpse of Harry’s body and held in the gasp.
Linfred couldn’t stop the wide smile from appearing on his face. “I shall start from the very beginning, avoiding my own childhood as that’s irrelevant. I do hope you’re comfortable, as this will be a long story,” he paused and waited for the boy’s nod. “Right. As you’re most likely aware – at least I hope you are – I grew up in a small village that had a community like a family. The village of Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire. I lived next to Muggles, not that they were called that at the time, hidden from them, but still in the open enough that I wouldn’t be questioned. I had a slight façade of being absent-minded – actually, no, I was rather absent-minded… I guess my real façade was being eccentric.
Harry snorted and turned over the large purple envelope, which had silver letting on it, making it look like a child had designed the thing. “Kwikspell?” he asked towards the group of Gryffindors, who said nothing. Deciding that they were no help, he decided to read it in his head.
Professor McGonagall sent the book back towards Harry Potter, glamour charm still in place, with a blank expression. “If it’s not Lockhart, it’s you, Mr. Potter… today just isn’t destined to be a smooth experience,” she said, smiling. “You may read ahead, and that goes for all of you, just make sure you understand the previous material before moving on.”
Harry hummed, actually debating the question as he studied the man in front of him. There were so many clues that he could piece together and get an answer from that, but beyond that, he wasn’t sure. “I can see that you’re not human,” he said, studying the man, who was kneeling in a dirty alley. “Despite your attempts at speaking as if you’re from this generation, you’re clearly older than what you appear to be, and I shouldn’t have to mention the fact that you call me a child, when you’re about twenty in appearance.”
Harry nodded and climbed into the cart, hoping that the ride up would help him clear his head a little. The ingredients that could be used to make the Elixir of Life flickered through his mind, even with his talent in Occlumency, blocking the constant thoughts was a hard task, excitement was driving him almost insane.
“I agree, a bit of physical violence can get it sorted, not that I urge people to do it or anything, Harry and Draco are a unique case.”
Harry watched, mesmerised, as the blue water slowly hardened and encased Viktor mid defence, which easily bypassed the shield that the boy had in place. Viktor was quite adaptable and, naturally, he broke out of the ice prison quite quickly, but he had noticed that Viktor was now moving much slower as if his bones had been frozen.
,” said Harry, looking like a child who was caught with their hand in a cookie jar. “
,” hissed the snake while tilting her head. “
“Indeed,” said the Healer, nodding. “When I was a young lad, I hit myself with a spell gone wrong and needed almost an entire week of care. As a teenager, I
“We could,” said Fred, frowning. “But we’ve been saving for three years and the thought of spending it makes me nervous.”
“I’d never allow that,” said Harry, cutting across Neville. “I’ll always strive to be the best. I’ll never allow being poor, or having no money, to hold me back. I would earn money, even if it required me to do such mundane things as cleaning a house from the bottom to the top.”
“I promise, I don’t want to do anything bad to him, I even bought him here and it was his idea for me to punch him!” Draco heard a voice and turned around, “father!” Draco nearly yelled, but lowered his voice.
Professor Snape turned to Theodore Nott and Rosier. “Mr. Nott, you may go to bed, you’re not needed. You to, Mr. Rosier.”
“Mind your own business, Patil. Clearly no one was speaking to you,” snapped Harry, turning to the group of Slytherins. “Come on, Draco, Theo, Rosie.”
“Secondly, I would like to award Ronald Weasley seventy-five points for assisting Mr. Longbottom in saving the school,” said Dumbledore, waiting for the clapping and cheering to stop. “And, finally, to Mr. Potter, will gain the same amount as Mr. Longbottom for the same reasons. House unity is an important thing, so I’m offering every house an extra thirty points in light of the events and how we all stuck together.”
“No need to be sarcastic,” said Hermione, frowning. “You should be more concerned for your friend.”
“Harry does claim to be bonded to his snake,” said Neville. “That could be why…”
“You can’t learn about Muggles from a book!” said Professor Burbage with a cheerful grin. “Books can be biased because they’re written from the author’s view. I want you all to forge your own opinions.”
The three of them arrived at his office “Lemon Sherbet Drops.” McGonagall said firmly as the stairs took the two kids up to Dumbledore, who was waiting in his office. She was really debating about rushing off to see if Harry was okay, but needed to keep this quiet about the situation, she rushed off to the infirmary to tell Madam Pomfrey to seclude Harry’s area and not to let anyone near his hospital bed and to curtain it off, ‘no one can know Harry is in this condition, it must be kept a secret’ she thought to herself.
“The side effects of the Antidote to Common Poisons is rather obvious to anyone who has picked up a book on common healing,” said Harry with a cruel smirk. “If the potion is brewed incorrectly then the potion will fail and not cure the actual poison. Instead, it mutilates it, causing you to get even sicker and amplifies the poison, speeding up the process and will inadvertently kill you faster.”
“What do you and Draco have?”
“I write my speeches,” said James. “I can repeat everything that I’ve ever said –”
“Why didn’t you get the book with a decent title?” said Draco. “Actually, all the books you got have weird titles.”
“Roper, Sophie!” called Professor McGonagall.
“Yessir,” said Harry, saluting in an overenthusiastic manner. He smiled when he heard someone snort.
“If this was reversed you’d be making me teach you the moment you knew I could do something,” said Draco. “I need time to learn and practice it! Also, the next Quidditch match is in two and a half months, not four.”
“As you know, I’m an adapt Legilimens, I was interrogating him and used Legilimency to see into his memories. What I saw was disturbing to say the least.”
“After Mr. Potter snuck out and brewed a highly illegal poison, I had to make sure he was staying in bed,” said Professor Snape. “I am glad I did.”
Draco stayed silent, not wanting to look at his mother to get that question out of her head. It was curious though, as Harry hadn’t met his gaze not even once during the once, his eyes locked firmly on the board from the moment the first move failed.
“You know them both?” Lucius looked at the figure.
His left eye closed and he put it down to the fact that there was sand in it and it was hurting to keep it open.
As it turned out, the burning sensation wasn’t nerves, nor was it any sort of issue on Harry’s end. Instead, it was something that Godric had done to the thing and Harry dropped it as if it had burned him, which it had, greatly so.
“Arrogance,” hissed Harry. “You threaten my mother and I’ll find a way to destroy you. It just so happens that I’m a quick thinker and a genius. Say goodbye, Voldemort.”
“So rude…”
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed open the door fully, entering the room as quietly as possible, not wanting to draw the ire of the stern professor. He knew that if they behaved, they would be fine. Professor McGonagall, unlike Professor Snape, was fair and just in her action, a typical Gryffindor trait. He walked in the room just in time to see Ron Weasley trip over his own feet. Suddenly, he knew why they were there.
“Not the point.”
“It isn’t Harry, headmaster,” said Professor Snape the instant that he could. “I know that it isn’t. You have my word. There must be a valid reason for him to be out of bed and out of the common room.”
He bent down, retrieved the wand that had been left there, and walked towards a sturdy-looking box, placing the Hawthorn wand on it with a slight smile. He retrieved his own wand, ignoring the look of surprise on the face of the boy, and Transfigured three boxes into three chairs with an annoyed sigh as they still looked like boxes to some degree. He sat down, placing his wand next to the other one beforehand, and gestured Draco into the room.
Ron threw a weak spell back at Harry; Ron kept his wand firm, despite him shaking heavily after he cast the spell. Harry didn’t react, he just watched, and waited for it to come closer.
“Of course I didn’t,” said Selene. “I would never do such a thing, it is not the Malfoy way.”
‘Hardly.’
Harry spun around, trying to figure out where the voice had come from. It sounded as if the person was frozen to the core and shuddered as each letter of the word came out. It was the slow pace that the word was said that made it so creepy.
“You say that, yet you did that regardless! How’d you even figure that out?”
“Are you now?” the man replied calmly. “I never thought I’d see a female Malfoy born in this lifetime.”
Harry gladly accepted the call, hanging back. He needed to be the last one to enter. He watched as Granger and Viktor entered first, he heard the shocked noises at them, and he grinned. He took the hand of his date, preparing, and turned his head when he felt his hand being squeezed.
“We shall move back to more important topics –”
“I aimed that at myself, too, you know,” said Harry, snorting. “It wouldn’t surprise me if we remained as immature and childish as we are well into our adult lives. Some people do, and they’re often the most mature you’ll ever meet.”
Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Neville started to clap too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face.
“Finally, Mr. Longbottom and Mr. Weasley will be receiving an award to the school, as will Mr. Potter. The awards can be located in the third-floor corridor, in the trophy room.”
“Perhaps I can convince Lucius to look for it?”
“Professor Lupin was a good professor!”
Harry gently opened the library door, wary not to shove it open and have Madam Pince staring at him with her eyes that demanded he respect her books. He instantly made his way towards the section with the books on history and began scanning them for any mention of Nicolas Flamel in the titles of the books. He didn’t get far when he spotted familiar looking bushy hair. “Granger, what brings you to these parts at such a time?”
Harry sent the man a cold glance. “Nagini didn’t touch your stupid cat!” he spat, his eyes narrowed. “She cannot petrify and she definitely cannot hang a cat up by its tail on a damn torch bracket. Nagini’s venom kills, not petrifies, therefore, it wasn’t her that did this to your cat!”
“These doors should automatically open for us,” said Harry, shoving at the Great Hall doors. “How do they expect a first-year student to open them? They weigh so much.”
Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin captain, Marcus Flint. He sneered at her then chuckled to himself, knowing damn well this match would be fun.
Harry bit his bottom lip, trying to figure out what he could say to calm the near hysterical house-elf down. Mopsy was a rare house-elf. She wasn’t unhinged like Dobby, the house-elf that would smell socks before he washed them or complain to the other house-elves that he didn’t want to be a servant and wanted to be free. He knew that that was the result of inbreeding amongst house-eves and the house-elf was as crazy as the Black family, except Narcissa, who was the only sane one from that family. “Mopsy, please calm down,” said Harry, staring at the wailing house-elf. “You’re a good servant, better than any other.”
“He stutters?”
“Trouble in paradise?”
Harry sat in the singular armchair in the drawing room at Malfoy Manor, a rather thick tome open on his lap, his eyes skimming the pages for knowledge at a rapid rate. Off to his left, in his peripheral vision, he saw Draco pretending to read a book as he glared hatefully at the far wall. He knew better though, his friend had been in a snit for the past two days, especially when he was mocked that Gilderoy Lockhart would be teaching at Hogwarts this year, seeing as Professor Quirrell had left due to ‘personal reasons’, not that anyone with half a brain believed that.
“I’m sure James will let something slip when he gets home,” said Lily. “We had things planned today. Damn it all.”
“I’m sorry Severus.”
“Bludgers have anti-tampering runes engraved on the insides,” said Harry. “Not only that, but they also have charms and spells that stop them from seeking one player for far too long and have magic resistant runes etched into them so they cannot be controlled with magic. Summing it up: the Bludger was tampered with by a powerful and intelligent wizard, not a student.”
“Don’t take too long,” said Draco, splitting off from Harry. “Father will be very displeased if we keep him waiting.”
“Probably Weasley.”
’ said Tom. ‘
Florean looked at Harry, “I’m glad you were finally able to befriend him, you deserve such things.” Florean turned to Draco and Narcissa, “Narcissa Malfoy I assume, it has been a few years since I last saw you, I hope you’re doing well.”
,” whined Nagini. “
“Draco!” hissed Harry.
Harry slowly turned towards Draco, knowing they could not speak and give away that there was two of them and held out his hand. It was a silent conversation, one that was one-sided for quite the time, before he felt the humming wand sitting on his palm. He mouthed a thank you and slid it under the door, glad that it fit with zero issues or damage. He would have hated to have to blast open the door to protect the wand, which he would do as if it were his own.
“I wouldn’t exactly call this working, mother.” Harry laughed.
“But you left an innocent boy to just die.”
“Dumbledore can’t actually tamper with the, uh, impartial judge,” he said. “So whatever he’s gonna do, it has to be outside of that.”
“Be quiet, I’ll be right back!” snapped a sandy-haired boy, he stood at the top of the stairs. “Honestly, you women drive me absolutely bonkers.”
“Professor Snape’s right, though,” said Harry loudly as he refilled his goblet with some chilled pumpkin juice. “We’re so behind in both practical and theory just for that one lesson. We’re still studying creatures when we should’ve moved onto curses months ago! I seriously mean months, Rosier, so don’t give me that look. We should’ve finished up creatures at the start of our second-year.”
“I do,” said Albus, lifting his wand. “You have one of the brightest minds that I have seen among those of your age. I hate to see you push aside your strategical side in favour of rushing in wand first. You need to work on sitting back and thinking of entire plans before you act, lest you get caught out. For example, there is a building overhang above us. Should the building catch on fire, it will weaken and crush us.”
Harry had am aghast look on his face.
Harry was, as it could be put, shocked into deafness. The only thing that he heard was that his mother wasn’t well and that meant that she was sick! The last time he had seen her she was healthy and now he was learning that she was sick and that something could be wrong? He needed to leave and make sure she was fine.
“You know what Malfoy? Shove off.”
Harry watched in amusement as Professor Snape sent a spell at Rosier’s bed, which made it neatly. “You know that he doesn’t like it made, he constantly makes debates that it’s pointless as he’s just going to climb in it later.”
Professor Snape sneered when everyone turned to him, his dark eyes narrowed and he began to expression his concerns with his house, mainly the first-years as that’s what everyone seemed to discuss. “I’m not sure what’s happening with Mr. Potter,” he said after discussing Rosier. “He hasn’t been himself since after the troll incident.”
“Easily done,” said Madam Malkin. “Would you like them signed for you, or will you be signing the tags yourself?”
“As you know Gryffindor needs a new Seeker, because of the incident that happened recently. If you would like to apply please contact Oliver Wood.” McGonagall smiled and sat back down, leaving Albus slightly chuckling.
“Potter, please,” said Pansy with a sniff. “I am certain you already know how everything works but I can
Harry knew her from the few times he had been to the Ministry and met her father. Her and her twin sister were rather well off and already pretty influential in the Ministry.
Harry weaved around the old lady with a shopping cart at the last moment and sent her a warm smile, ignoring her cries about youth. He turned into an alley, almost sliding on a puddle and cursed as he was met with a dead-end. ‘The day I ask Nagini to stay at Malfoy Manor, I get chased by a crazy stalker,’ he thought bitterly, hoping he lost the stalker. He heard footsteps coming around the corner. ‘Please be that old lady, asking if I’m alright.’
The three Potters soon left the store, aware that the wand maker was smiling at them far too brightly for it to not be creepy.
“What is the reasoning behind your assumption?” said Professor Moody. “And you were right, Mr Potter was the red. He was the first person to cast the spell, so I’m unsure on how no one saw his colour.”
. Very good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods – palmistry, crystal balls, bird entrails…”
“What the fuck was that Ronald?” Harry was clearly agitated.
A smile appeared on Narcissa’s face before it faded as quickly as it appeared. “Don’t try and sway me with your little charming ways. I’m sure if you could, you’d be blinking sheepishly and kicking your shoes against each other if you felt it had a way out of your current predicament,” she said, looking at Harry with a somewhat concerned expression. “While I’m sure your little façade of an innocent boy works on plenty of others, it’ll never work on me because I know you, Harry. In the future, do try and remember who taught you the pleasantries that you use daily.”
Harry looked down at the harmless looking black diary which belonged to Riddle, could it be T. M. Riddle? The same person who sent him the Dark Arts books? He debated it for a moment before he glanced up, ready to move from the room. All he needed was an opening.
And so Harry did. He spent no less than an hour plotting over minor details with his companion, flawlessly planning for things that would change the year. No one cared about petty pranks or even dumber ‘prank wars’. Any fool can prank someone. It takes a touch of genius, and maybe a subtle hint of insanity to do what he was going to do and he needed it to be perfect.
“Why do you think Voldemort never bothered with goblins?” whispered Harry. “No matter what immortality he claims, they would kill him the moment he stepped foot in this place and demanded they join him. Oh, they may join him, for a split-second, at least, and the moment he relaxed or turned his back, he would be cut in half.”
“Some protections may be a good idea,” said the old woman. “I’ll use what strength I have left and then head right to bed, despite the time. I’m sure whatever happens will pass and leave me well enough alone.”
Chapter 25 –
“Ten points to Slytherin for above average knowledge about the age of the four founders,” said Professor McGonagall. “However, I suggest not being so blunt regarding the case.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It may do them some good; I personally would like to see who comes out on top.”
Neville rolled his eyes but laughed. “We also need to pay Hagrid a visit and make sure he’s alright.”
“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” asked Hermione curiously. “Why is he studying dragons?”
Draco nodded, “you see Harry mother cannot have any more children, she wanted two. One for the Malfoy line and one for the Black line, father agreed that it would be a good idea to continue both lines but something happened and mother lost the baby and then fell infertile, she cannot have any more children. Mother sees you like a son Harry, it’s why she spoils me so much, she could not handle to lose me and I don’t think she could accept losing you either, she wanted to adopt you Harry, badly.”
“Are they famous around here? I assume they are because of Harry.”
Slytherin was already in the finals due to winning all their games. Points hardly matter in the long run as wins were more important. This was to stop teams banding together and allowing one team to win by thousands of points, pushing the leader out. Point tallies were only added in case of a tie between houses.
“I explained that all the objects are immune to magic due to the fact that people many years ago, students decided to burn them when in foul moods and it was becoming tiresome to force them to replace the items constantly.”
“What Harry’s trying to say is that we’d like to use a bathroom where there’s some privacy,” said Rosier, stopping any form of argument. “Would you use that thing?”
“I never would have-” Hermione hesitated and glanced towards the castle Draco approaching, “-guessed, but Malfoy is coming, is it okay if I eavesdrop?”
“Leave it ickle Ronniekins,” teased Fred. “He’s been out there for
Professor Snape grumbled, pulling the cork from the potion and tipped a small amount into a container which the bunny happily hopped to and drank.
Ron made a sound that sounded like a distressed animal. “She came back to the Gryffindor common room crying! She refused to tell us what happened and she was last at the library!”
Theo looked at Draco and then spun slightly to look at Harry. “I see you didn’t get expelled, that’s fantastic.”
“I guess not, perhaps we should seek to remedy that,” said Dumbledore, his blue eyes twinkling. He gave a grandfatherly smile and turned to Professor Snape. “Severus, my boy, would you mind fetching Mr. Potter’s trunk?”
Anyone who knew Lily Potter knew that the tone that her son was using was from her, the tone that wasn’t a screech, nor a shout, but just as deadly and punishing. She was far more frightening when speaking calmly rather than yelling. The ability to remain calm, even when furious knocked a few people off course. Severus of course knew that Harry had taken all of Lily’s mannerisms and changed them to be his own, slightly merged with anything that was taught by Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy.
“If they bypass the spell, they will always know that the school is here,” said Salazar. “A Muggle, as you call them, will see the castle the second they step foot into the Chamber of Secrets, even should they instantly leave, because they will have bene welcomed by the castle.”
“You need to listen more in Potions,” said Harry. “Anyway, looks like everyone else is leaving and they should be done with the introductory speeches. Hell if I wanted to get dragged into that. I know Snape would, too.”
“Are you stupid?” said Harry, angrily pushing his foot into his shoe. He kicked the floor, trying to make it fit on right. “Scratch that, you are. I’m not gonna shower, then put on clean clothes, and then go outside and walk through a forest while Nagini hunts. God, some people…”
Ernie nodded. “Justin made the connection himself that anyone who spoke to snakes was evil. After Creevey was petrified he has been really jumpy, constantly saying that he can hear hissing and that You-Know-Who is after him. Granger put ideas of the Chamber of Secrets in his head, so that didn’t help. I guess Longbottom speaking to that snake freaked him out.”
He cancelled the spell, unsure on whether the druid had been hit or even shocked, and recast it without the change, making sure it was more powerful than the first one. He could not take credit for this part of the chain, however, as it had all been Severus Snape. A less powerful whip to take them by surprise, cancel the spell mid slash, recast it before the whip connected for a more powerful version. It was genius and he could not wait to see how Atieno and the druid would react.
Harry cringed at the overly motherly voice of the Goblet. It was full of genuine praise. He crawled back as an ember flew off the flaming avatar and landed on the end of the hospital. He sucked in a breath, silently, and snuffed it out before it could end him.
“Do not mistake me for Harry,” said Severus. “I know not your ancient traditions, nor do I care for them. By wizarding duel standards, Harry had won and I simply used a spell to keep him upright. I hardly interfered.”
Harry nodded and glanced out the window, looking at the school, which appeared to look boring, a square shape with a few buildings scattered around it. The building held no aspirating traits and could almost be compared to Weasley’s shack, that’s how boring and bland it was.
It really couldn’t be labelled to Gryffindor-ish behaviour, as it wasn’t exactly like a Gryffindor would act, at least according to his father, which was ignored by Severus completely, every time.
“I’m still confused, but you at least make sense,” said Harry, pointing at the boy. He pointed to the girl and added, “She, however, does not.”
Snape shook his head and gently tipped the memory into the Pensieve, Snape watched Harry drop in front of his parent’s graves and cry. While it was obvious Snape had a very high amount of disdain for Harry, this scene before him made Snape realize it was really petty and he promised Lily he would take care of Harry if something ever happened. Snape walked around Harry, getting a good look at his face, his lip was quivering, and tears fell rapidly from his eyes and slid down his cheek and dripped softly on the snow.
Blaise lent up against the doorframe, “I’m not going to wank if you’re hinting of it, and I have a few books I would love to read to be honest. Be sure to put a silencing charm on the bed and draw the curtains back, the last thing you would want is for something to walk in and catch him in your bed.”
“For a chat and some tea, obviously.”
Ron, already feeling brave enough, slowly inched forwards and gently stroked the beak of Buckbeak, which almost made him snicker at the thought.
“You can’t really blame Malfoy for what happened,” said Hermione, ignoring the looks she got. “He is a child and he doesn’t understand what’s going on. You see, when Potter is with him, he’s decent.”
“I apologise, Harry, but the seven year old you would run around the house claiming that you would be the best and most powerful wizard since Merlin himself. Whenever Neville Longbottom came around your attitude would change and you’d scowl and flare at him as if he was the bane of all your issues.”
“I spoke to them about the importance of discretion,” said James, mumbling. “They know better to go and spread information about what we’re doing.”
Harry frowned, his bright green eyes reflecting the flickering torchlight. “When’ve you ever listened to what
“Loyalty isn’t something that you should scoff at, Draco,” said Harry in a calm tone of voice. “I spoke with Susan Bones recently, as I knew the name was familiar. My father, he speaks to Amelia Bones at the Ministry and often comes home and talks about her. You see, Amelia Bones is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, which isn’t something that you should really scowl or such at. Lucius always did say that the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is often used as a stepping stone to the Ministership.”
They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.
“I’ll go talk to him,” said Hermione, standing. “You can come too, if you want.”
Harry sat down and listened to his aunt.
Harry couldn’t help but snort at the name of the goblin. “Your name is Grexle Pepperknob?” he said as he watched the goblin, silently thankful that the goblin had also stopped fighting for the moment of banter or taunting – probably the latter of the two. “If my recent take on goblin history is correct – which it should be – your job or duty is to pepper knobs?”
“Harry,” Draco said quickly, “did you know Blaise had a crush on me in the first year?”
Lily woke up much later than she usually would, especially on a day that she had plans and that her husband had work, who would normally wake her with his clumsy walking at seven in the morning. The moment she had opened her eyes she realized that it was much later than she first thought. The curtains had been pulled open, allowing the cruel, but warming sun to force its way into the bedroom, which she instantly blamed on James, as no one else should have been in here to do it.
“From here on out any students caught fighting will lose fifty house points, as well as serve one month’s detention, it doesn’t matter who started it.”
It didn’t take long before all the students started to fall asleep, even those that were afraid of the looming threat of Peter Pettigrew.
“We don’t need to see this,” said Harry. “They’ve clearly got an Ageing Potion and think that’ll work. Let’s go and get some toast. I’m starving.”
He stood when he heard a loud crack in a room upstairs. He quickly stood and made his way towards the stairs, trying not to wince when he looked at his godson, who stopped glaring and was simply staring directly ahead as if he saw nothing.
“Grow up Ron.” Neville shook his head.
Draco sighed and gestured roughly at the letter. “What’s that for?”
“The Irish International Side’s just put in an order for seven of these beauties!”
! He takes Quidditch too seriously, he has since year one.”
“Once I get out of here, Potter, I’ll tie you up in the Great Hall, and then I’ll find your stupid Mudblood mother and I’ll torture her right in front of you,” said Ginny, glaring. “Only once you beg and plead for her life will I turn my wand onto you and break all your fingers and then I’ll break your legs while your Mudblood mother cries for you. I will then kill her and uri –”
Mopsy nodded.
“Great, you’re a life-saver, Mopsy,” said Harry. “If you could make a nice steak with potatoes, vegetables and maybe some pasta that would be great.”
“Well, if we backtrack a little to what we just spoke about, we’ll have our answer,” said Harry. “Just because you could kill someone using the Levitation Charm doesn’t mean that spell is now Dark Arts. The Dark Arts require malicious intent, a strong desire to actually cause harm and that intent and emotion is driven by the spell itself during creation. You can cause serious damage with a simple Tripping Hex, but it’ll never be considered Dark Arts.”
“Speech” | ‘Thoughts’ | ‘
,’ said Tom, his tone slightly pushy. ‘
Nothing happened.
“The dark book is destruction and power. It contains spells that could tear through the strongest of wards, spells to raise your own army, spells that could do anything you ever wished with a simple flick of your wand. Its darkness, it cloaks instead of protects, it makes you invisible. But it’s cold, it’ll slowly turn you cold, the more you use it.”
“I did indeed,” said Harry lazily, tossing the letter onto the desk. “You’re a Squib.”
Severus waited patiently for Harry to make the first move, like most duels it all started off on the first move and if no one moved the duel could be at a standstill for a while until something for agitated enough to throw the first spell. He knew that Harry always played black in chess, so he’d use the same tactic and use the first spell of the enemy to capitalise and push on from that. The issue was that both of them had that same tactic.
Severus took the time to appreciate Harry’s form, in a duelling perspective, as he deflected a stray Cutting Hex that could have caused some damage if it had actually landed. He realised that Harry had an almost professional duelling stance, clearly taught by Narcissa or Lucius. In the posture was a tiny bit of Lucius, Narcissa and Bellatrix. Having duelled alongside the insane witch countless times, he could say that he recognised it from anywhere. He shuddered at the mere thought of Harry resembling that maddened loon of a woman.
“Be quiet!” said Draco in a whisper, looking concerned. “What if someone heard you say that just now? It would ruin us.”
“It was me who set everything in motion, allowed all these events to occur to take everyone’s mind off what’s really happening! The Dark Lord, my master, will rise again and again and again! He cannot be killed!”
“Wait, if he didn’t have his wand out, then who cursed the hippogriff?”
Harry grinned and sat next to Nagini. “
let you leave.”
“Oh, oh, oh!” said Harry, dragging out each word a little longer than the last. His tone of voice indicated at someone just realising something stupid that they shouldn’t have even forgotten about it. “That makes a lot of sense now. You’re a lot like Granger in the sense that you just repeat knowledge instead of studying it. You just repeat things that aren’t even in your own words and take credit for it. I should’ve known, honestly, it was far too professional for you to know. Taking credit for what Professor Sprout had told you, why I never!”
,’ said Tom. ‘
Harry silently began to prepare the ingredients, deep down he was thankful for having Draco here who was at least competent in potions, as much as he learned over the years it seemed like the only Malfoy to not excel in potions was Lucius and Abraxas. He carefully sliced into the ingredients, preparing their lengths for when it was needed, he asked Draco to set the cauldron on the standard temperature.
?” he said softly, taking a small sip of his tea. “It essentially makes us purely magical. It’s not like how Muggles portray magic in their fiction novels. There’s no core that we draw magic from – a core that is larger in some people. It’s silly, isn’t it? Witches and wizards are all equals, it just depends on the emotion and desire of the caster.”
“A proper one,” said Harry. “We’ll have rules planned out and drawn up and then we’ll meet in the Duelling Chamber and get this over with.”
“Yeah, same,” said Harry, laughing, “but he’s not
“Now the bad part, the longest a Potter has lived is to thirty-two, most are killed at around twenty-five. Back in the day a ritual was done that protected a Potter heir until he was eighteen, his magic would expand at seventeen, and this gives them a year to learn as much as he could before they had to fight for their lives. Remember the Potters were seen as Dark, even if they did nothing but sit at home and fear for their lives, the difference is you came into this world stopping the darkest wizard of this century, I assume people forgot about your past, or they’re waiting.”
“You know how wizards can be,” said Harry, peering at the book. “Just look at most of the students in this castle. Each of them fit into a category that neglects magic and knowledge.”
Chapter 25 –
“Huh?”
“Is the curse bad?”
“Can I join you? We can talk on the way.”
Ginny released the embrace and smiled; she stood in the middle, but leaned closer towards Harry. Ron was bright red, he sprinted at Harry and rammed his wand into Harry’s throat.
“So, it’s definitely something to do with adults for themselves?” said Jude. “Seems a bit uppity. They’ve got all year to do whatever they want and now they’re trying to cut into our school time?”
He won. Just like he knew he would. Nott was far from a threat, both he and Tom now knew that.
“Anyway, sit down, we have plenty to discuss over some tea.” Narcissa sat and directed the boys to a two seater sofa.
Harry began plotting in his head as various students slowly entered the room, surprise filling their faces when they already saw him sitting there. He smiled at Draco, who sat next time him, and watched as Ronald Weasley and Neville Longbottom walked in, almost late, talking as only they existed.
“The Ministry has many ways to detect and track magic without using the Trace,” said Harry, jolting slightly at the voice behind him. “They don’t use these methods because they assumed the Trace was infallible.”
Theodore nodded and decided to just change the subject, not wanting to talk about a subject that could cause issues for the small group. “I wonder what we’re being served for breakfast today. Yesterday was the usual for the day, but today is the random day. I hope its pancakes, to be honest.”
“You’re not using him like he’s a piece of meat, Blaise.”
Ron moved up to investigate the tap and the marking. He stood still for what appeared to be a few seconds before he snapped from the daze. “Neville… say something – say something in Parseltongue!”
To sum it all up, I have a few story ideas to keep me writing and creative. I will list them below and see what people think. You do not need to read them at all, or anything like that, just want to see what my readers find interesting.
Peeling gold letters over the door that read:
“But –”
Draco swaggered up towards the seat and sat down, waiting.
“He did?”
“It’s pretty big,” said Draco, grasping the tip of the wand and studying it. “It looks great though, so refined.”
“Fancy seeing you here, Granger,” sneered Draco, ignoring the comment about sneering from Harry. “If I remember right, you called Divination ‘hogwash’ on Monday and yet you’re here, taking the class.”
“Oh Merlin,” she said rather blandly, with no attempt to conceal her worry. She rushed off to contact Dumbledore, which left Draco alone.
“My name was down for Eton, you know, I can’t tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see how useful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family.”
He allowed the woman to do her job, knowing from the rants of his mother that blocking or halting any sort of Healer was something you never wanted to attempt, especially seeing as most spells that were based on healing, much like potions, had a timer before they became useless and more harmful than good. The longer you waited, the fewer options you had.
“You’ve memories
Dumbledore chuckled, “for a rule breaker, he seems eager to want to follow them now.”
“Each,” said Professor Snape, a predatory gleam in his dark eyes. “For your disrespect and the interruption you had on my class.”
“I didn’t, either,” said Harry, ducking his head. “I expected it to be something more complicated than standing on a platform and defending against attacks. I was, I dunno, hoping for
Hagrid looked imploringly at Dumbledore. “You know that I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir…”
“Jörmungandr is a sea serpent in Norse mythology. The serpent grew so large that he was able to surround the earth and grasp his own tail. As a result, he received the name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. When he lets go, the world will end,” explained Harry, just as he had back in Hogwarts to most of the Slytherin students. “That’s putting it simply.”
“Well, Krum is talented, powerful, and famous,” said Rosier. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? Karkaroff has been grooming Krum and is sticking close so that he can reap the benefits. Krum’s far too old to still be in school, I assume, so that probably means Karkaroff is failing him on a subject to keep him there.”
,” said Salazar, twisting his head to the side in a mocking gesture. “
“Because they lack sense,” said Severus. “The Ministry panics and then ignores their own protocols and instructions for what to do in an emergency. Collateral damage does not bother them as long as they are safe.”
“NO!”
“I never thought I’d see the day where a Malfoy, of all people, was bowing to the whims of a half-blood.”
thing correct.”
“I realise that this is not what you wanted when I said I would be tutoring you in the Dark Arts,” said Salazar, dismissing the mannequins with a soft remark. “It is impossible to just pick up a book, read a few lines, and then be proficient in the Dark Arts, even if you are talented and an innate genius. The descent is slow and can be unbearable, but that is just how it is.”
Harry sighed and stabbed another piece of bacon with slow movements, fully aware that his friend was watching him. He did deliberate movements that made it look as if he was eating a lot, but in reality he was hardly eating anything. He had hoped the small amount that he had eaten would get Draco off his case about it. No such luck. He knew at that moment that Draco wouldn’t be dropping this and if it got to be so severe of him not eating, Draco would pick up a fork and force feed him. After a minute of pursed lips, he finally picked up the fork once again and placed food into his mouth, forcing himself to not glare at the smile that he notice don his friend’s face.
Dudley couldn’t help but laugh, but he slapped Piers on the back.
Dumbledore still sat at Harry’s feet, enduring the explosions of dark magic that hit him constantly, they weren’t powerful, but just strong enough to deter others away so they didn’t intrude, even after all that he had seen with Harry, this impressed him the most. Harry’s body lifted, like he was possessed and let out a scream, a scream that was filled with different emotions, a scream most wouldn’t understand unless they had lost as much as him. Dumbledore stood still, as Harry’s body finally dropped back to the floor, Dumbledore still muttered in the language most wizards wouldn’t understand. About fifteen minutes of constant dark magic bursts, random screams and images of Harry’s past floated around them, after a brief period of the torment, he was finally quiet, the magic slowly faded and Dumbledore breathed a sigh of relief. Harry awoke and started to speak.
“I hate to be the bearer of bad news Harry,” Dumbledore broke the silence, “but you must know this position isn’t permanent, it’s only for this year, the Ministry will not allow a fourteen year old to teach, despite the fact you know more than them.”
. It’s good because we can focus purely on Gryffindor and not a three-way directed attack. A few well-placed traps and a few traps that are executed perfectly… well, that’ll thin out Gryffindor numbers just a tad.”
Harry’s facial expression showed how he felt in that situation. “I wasn’t going to take it, professor, I was just thinking.”
The Dark Arts used an astonishing amount of power, some of which lingered, and that is what caused the air of power to surround those that practices the art.
Harry turned around and stared directly at the straw-haired boy, better known as Theodore Nott. “Nott,” he said as he rubbed his chin. Slytherin students were hot and cold with how they greeted you. One day it would be your first name, and then other days it would be your surname. “Do you
“I know, I know… but now that I do it, I’ll always catch myself doing it and that’ll cause hesitation, and hesitation breeds defeat.”
“But we
“I’m pretty sure a father is meant to prioritise his son over filling out some forms.”
“Mr. Potter understands, clearly.”
Draco walked out and gave Pansy a nod, he then saw Harry and cursed and then sat in between Harry’s legs, blocking the view from anyone who looked, “good morning Pans and Blaise.”
“Before you leave, Mr. Potter, could you perhaps hand me that sword that Professor Lockhart is holding?” said Dumbledore, his tone clam and his facial expression relaxed.
“Girl,” sneered Pansy. “More girlish than Draco.”
“So is your Gryffindor rashness.”
“Look at this furniture,” he said to Draco. “The Shrieking Shack used to have someone living in it, rather recently.”
“I agree Ginny; it’s just that his safety should be our top concern and of course I feel bad if we don’t do something to at least attempt to help him.” Hermione frowned.
Pansy stood up, “oh my, a love letter. That’s adorable!” Harry snorted as he left the room, ignoring her completely. Snape left afterwards, wanting no part in that.
“That was pretty amazing flying, Potter,” said Terence, standing directly in front of the boy. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone fly so well, not even the professionals can fly that fast.”

Draco snorted and sent a glare towards his friend. “Just like you forgot my birthday, not just once, but twice!”
“Thank you, Gilderoy, that is most kind,” said Dumbledore, a wide smile on his face.
That hadn’t been the only thing that caught the eye of the spectators. The spell that had intercepted the Blasting Curse had been done nonverbally. Reaction speed was essential, and being able to cast spells nonverbally allowed for that extra millisecond that could allow you to win. A large spell repertoire would get you across obstacles, but intense reaction speed would get you the furthest in duels.
Harry watched the boy storm off, or as quietly as one can in the library, and went back to reading a few books. The constant chatter was driving him up the wall, as everyone was trying to be quiet and was therefore much louder than usual. The girl at the desk opposite him was trying to explain male anatomy to the girl next to her, who would break down in a fit of giggles whenever something questionable was said. If that was not evidence enough, she would stare at every boy in the room, an intent expression, trying to picture something on them.
Draco conjured some roses and placed on the grave, he hugged Harry tightly.
“Are you reading that?”
“Look, Beauxbatons just got another goal! It’ll be over in no time.”
Lily shifted, moving around the room so that she didn’t shift into the firing range of Molly, knowing that her son had done something to ignite this little argument. She loved her son, believed every word that he said, but she knew that he liked to push limits. She knew, as much as James, that Harry was really soft at heart, he just liked to prod people and get under their skin. She sat down, blocking the rest of the room and smiled.
“Sit Lucius, we don’t have much time.” Voldemort snapped.
“I’m not ill, Hermione,” snapped Neville and then sent her an apologizing look. “I think it’s a warning… I think it means that danger is coming.”
“Kind of like me,” said Draco, whispering to the few younger students near him. “I’m a fantastic Seeker, but I think I’d be an even better Chaser.”
“Rowena was working on something similar,” said Salazar when he was questioned. “Godric worked on something, as well. Helga worked on the greenhouses and – have we not already had this discussion?”
“Understatement,” said Draco, laughing. “When we were seven, I stepped on a book of his. He still hasn’t forgiven me.”
Harry gave him a forced smile and shook his hand. “Harry Potter.”
“That was amazing,” said Dudley as they sat down. “No one has ever beaten her in chess before!”
The three of them followed Weasley, Longbottom, and Granger at a close distance. They made sure to keep the chatter down and their footsteps soft. They also kept an idle discussion that they could revert to if anyone else besides the people they were trailing came near them.
Hermione howled and lifted the robe back over her face, hiding her from view.
Harry went bright red at the remark, was that a double innuendo or just misinterpreted? A Malfoy would never misinterpret anything, so what he said… he meant. Harry glanced over towards Draco and realized he wasn’t bothered by the comment, so maybe Harry took it the wrong way, oh Merlin.
“Why not?”
“Yet I am,” said Harry. “It’s debilitating. I feel like it’s killing me.”
“Do you know who it is?” asked Draco, studying the student closely. “Wait a second, that’s not even a student.”
“Because their soul has been corrupted by the festering disease that haunts them,” said Harry. “No matter, that’s a whole different topic. Do you remember that, when I was six, I
