"Knut for your thoughts" he had been watching his confused expression for as long as he could resist the curiosity.
The other occupants of the room looked at them a little uncomfortably, the atmosphere surrounding the teenagers was somewhat intimate and it felt wrong that they were witnessing the moment.
Draco blushed a little. " Ahhhh well, you were not waking up. I panicked." Harry just stared at him for a minute before he started laughing. All the tension in his body quickly melting away, maybe it was the stress, but he couldn't stop laughing. He was laughing so hard that Draco had to tightened his hold on his waist to avoid him falling to the ground.
"Yeah sure" voice dripping with sarcasm "because you were so charming when you had to wake up early. A sweetheart really."
"I have a very powerful mass murder trying to kill me. It does not seem far-fetched to think that he will eventually succeed. It is just an incredible mixture of dumb luck and a miracle that I have survived to this point." He shrugged, it seems quite logical to him. "He is an older well trained wizard, I am a teenager with a somewhat mediocre education on how to defend myself."
"That is normal since we are very careful not to be discovered by wizards or other creatures. There is just a handful of us still existing, it would be too risky for us to be known" Kaly said.
"the Hand of Glory is the one known way to find the way through it."
Since then he understood that no matter how much he fought it he was completely in love with one Harry Potter. The same guy that has hated him for years with good reason to do so. He resigned himself to just look at him from afar and confined every trace of his crush for him in a corner of his mind. That worked for a while, but now things were different. There was a war coming and Potter was in the center of it. He couldn't help but be terrified of what would happen to him. Yes, he knew Potter was incredibly powerful even with all his lack of training and he could hold his own in a duel. But war was different, war needed a lot more than just power if you don't want to die. You had to be ruthless and fine with the possibility of killing another person. He has seen Potter, he knows his heart is as pure as they come with a childlike innocence that is looking for the good in the world even when there isn't any. He was not made for war and yet he was chosen to play the biggest part.
"By all means then explain" Severus said scowling.
"We get our O.W.L. results today! I want to go back as soon as possible." He seems to be buzzing with excitement. He didn't particularly care about his results, he knew it was probably pretty average.
"Hello Mr. Weasley, I'm glad to see you as well" Harry smiled. Mr. Weasley looked almost the same, albeit a little sleep deprived. Draco just acknowledged the greeting with polite nod.
Before they could keep talking about this Harry started to move, waking up little by little. Harry didn't know what was happening, he just knew that his body didn't hurt as much as when he lost consciousness. He also knew he was surrounded by something warm and comforting, that same thing ran fingers through his hair something that always made him sleepy. He tried to recognize his surroundings, but everything was blurry without his glasses. Uncle Vernon had broken them while punishing him a couple of days ago.
"Let them, Harry needs her" said Luna with a serious tone no one heard her use before.
They were taken to the back room, it seemed to be the place where the tests were performed on the new inventions. As soon as they closed the door the twins grabbed Harry raising him from the ground with a hug.
"we need to check on the store."
"Really?" Harry was surprised, people usually go out of their way to keep him unprepared and uninformed.
Narcissa had a good idea of how they could find that place again, but she would have to speak with her husband before getting Remus's hopes up. It wasn't something easy, and they would need Harry's cooperation for it.
He looked at the others again, "yes she is poisonous, but promises to only bite the people I ask her to."
So that is how he ended up like this. The five of them trying to live with each other. They had been with each other a little over 3 weeks already.
"We can always hope..."
"He is stable for now but he is heavily underweight, he currently three broken ribs, and his ankle and a couple of fingers are broken. His magic seems to have been trying to heal him all by itself"
"Call me Narcissa or Cissa dear" she corrected him gently. "Of course what would that be?"
"Well, you're a little young for my taste but for that pretty face I could make an exception," Fred winked and Draco blushed. The whole table started to loudly laugh.
"I have no choice, Dumbledore forces me to go there every summer. I have no say on this." Harry sighs.
"Harry" speaking a little more firmly this time "if you do not wake up, you will not get to try the Treacle Tart I made for dessert."
"Not just wizard kind... when we said the end we mean the end of magical world in itself" Kaly said "think about it, it's not just your kind that is fighting after all."
"It is useless to resist them when it comes to clothes," Lucius said with a solidarity look. He had not been able to choose his clothes for years and he didn't have a bad sense of style to begin with. "it is easier to accept it."
"What else do I need?"
"You failed two?" Fred started to cry on cue.
"Don' wanna" Harry replied groggily.
"What are your intentions with him?" they asked at the same time.
Random detail:
"Sure, but why would you want to go there?" Harry asked a little confused.
"Now wait a moment you lot of freaks can not come to my home and demand things! First we get stuck with that horrible boy who only causes problems for everyone, and now thanks to him I have to have these freaks in my house! He should have done everyone a favor and died with his useless parents. " Vernon had the bad choice of shouting. Narcissa did not bother to listen to more of the insults of the man and cast a silencer spell on him, while the other three men had the opportunity to cast a couple of curses in his direction that would not be visible outside.
The Gryffindors at the table saw the menu and had absolutely no idea what any of the dishes were since the menu was written completely in French.
"Why are we still here? He is obviously in trouble." Draco was nervous without knowing what happened to Potter to cause him to send something like that.
"We noticed that you are very close,"
"to our lovely little brother."
"Whatever you're selling, we don't want it!" someone screams from inside. Remus keeps knocking on the door until they hear very loud footsteps approaching. A whale of a man was standing at the door. "What do you all want, it's late?! Go before I call the police!"
There was a contemplating silence over the table. Not long after they paid the bill and went on there way to find the teens. Luckily they were just coming out of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, they all happily went back to the place they would call home for the rest of summer.
"Not really it just feels a little strange, like there is too much bulk in a tiny space" explaining as best he could.
"Take him far away from here if you want but be out of my house before we come back! " she grabbed her husband and elephant like child and disappeared as fast as humanly possible.
"They mentioned that there are not many of them left. It is easier for them to hide everything if they keep their numbers small," gently forcing him to lie down, "if you keep going like this you will get sick."
"I will," taking Draco's hand he practically dragged him outside. The moment they were out of sight he turned to the blonde, "do you really want to go to see Fred and George or you were just making something up?"
"I did, thank you" he wanted to cry but refused to do so. He was so happy he couldn't stop smiling.
"Morning cub, did you make breakfast?" Remus sat down where Harry pointed and soon there was a plate in front of him and some coffee. "Thank you."
Draco was starting to dread that he would not find anything at all or they would need to go to "Borgin and Burkes." They all avoid that store as much as possible since Pansy accidentally got cursed touching an item, but when he started to lose all hope something in an old jewelry shop window caught his eye. It was a fairly simple choker made of black velvet ribbon with silver filigree embroidered on it, and right in the middle it had a deep green opal pendant. It was a beautiful and would look perfect on Harry.
Severus now knew the extension of the things that Harry endured. This including what happened during the years at school to some extent, now more than ever he had trouble understanding how he didn't see everything before. A child who went through all that abuse should have shown more signs. He fears that he did show them but he refused to see them out of hatred.
"For Peter, we want to leave him the same amount of galleons as Remus in addition to that he can ask for everything he needs to pay his debts with the bank" James said smiling, though Lily did not look very comfortable with the mention of Peter.
"He's your mate, help him with the pain" she said in her deep voice, she helped him holding Harry's arms down. "Touch his head and concentrate on him."
Theo is a whole different story. He is extremely quiet and tends to blend into the background often. He doesn't really talk much, but he is a very sweet guy and the three of them have a soft spot for him. His home life is especially horrible, after his mother's death his father went absolutely crazy. He is a very abusive and cruel man with obvious anger management issues. Theo doesn't talk about what happens behind closed doors, but you would need to be blind to not notice the different wounds he has at the beginning of every year and how he always tries to get as far away from him as he can. He usually he stays with Blaise or Draco during holidays and as much of the summer as he can.
"Bill tried to teach us a little of the language. His fiance speaks it and well, that's all that I can remember. What does it mean?" Fred was curious now.
Once they got there, everything seemed normal, the lights were still on. They hoped not to have many problems trying to enter.
His body felt as if they were taking every muscle and bone in his body and tearing it apart. It was the worst pain he had in his life, he wasn't even aware he was screaming. He could only concentrate on the pain.
"It's all we need to know" the twins said at the same time.
"Because you do idiotic things."
"He explained to some extent yes, but I will like to know the conditions from you" Lucius said.
Draco sighed, he knew he would need to apologize to Longbottom soon. He had been terrible to the shy Gryffindor, he will do it when he can talk to him alone, for now he will try his best to be nice and maybe the other will relax. He keeps his face neutral "good evening, happy birthday Longbottom"
"What did you try to break that was so important?" Draco asked, his mind was trying to remember something but couldn't quite get it.
"Yes, I think I'm fine" he smiled weakly, his eyes were duller.
"I could have helped them... maybe help the girls to escape..." Severus whispered.
"Yes I did, he actually said it wasn't necessary because he always fought back. So we were even in a way."
"I wish that was an option Sev, but it's not up to us. We can only prepare them to the best of our ability."
"Can we help you today?" Fred continued.
"Thanks... "He closed his eyes. He felt weak and dizzy but the potions were working.
"He is a lunatic with too much power in his hands, I'm glad you didn't have to assist him on that nauseating mission" Lucius said a little sick to his stomach. The Dark Lord always preferred to target families when he was in the mood to kill.
"When you two were born we could feel it" a little lost in a memory, "there was a little change in our magic, it's hard to explain."
The twins mixed perfectly with them after a while of speaking, but most of their attention was on their little brother and Malfoy. Both seemed to be strangely close now. They were sitting as close as possible, sharing their food, and giving small smiles every once in a while. It was completely different from the rival they saw last year. They usually hexed each other every time they were together, this was a bit odd. But the twins trusted Harry's judgment, and they loved watching him smile so much.
"Potter, you just had a fit of accidental magic. You are in no condition to take that now." said Severus pinching the bridge of his nose.
"I gave them the money from the tournament to start their business and open the store. They insisted that makes me a silent partner" he said as if it was a regular thing to give that much money to someone while looking for sweets.
"Remus breath please. If this is Harry's blood and he needs help we will all go. But you need to be in control of yourself first," putting both hands on his face and forcing him look at her.
Lucius came up hugging him from behind and resting his head on his shoulder effectively pulling him out of his thoughts.
"You should shut your mouth or a fly could get in there" Draco said amused at his expression and loving the blush on Harry's cheeks after that.
"Can you please stop the unnecessary display of affection," Severus grunted when he sat down.
"Are you coming to hear the will of Lord Black and Lord Potter? We have been requesting your presence for a month." He said once he got a form with the previous notification.
"We need them now."
"If I hadn't been born, they would all be alive right now," Harry mumbled, burying his head in Draco's shoulder, "If I just wasn't born..."
The others were panicking, one second everything was fine and now it looked like Harry was dying. They quickly tried to move the things off of the couch and tried laying him there.
"I'm not kidding sir ... what day is it?" he asks suddenly.
"We hope you have a long and happy life, and that you always know that there are people who love you. Even if we can't be by your side physically, we will always take care of you, you are all our life" added Lily
"Potter has the greatest magical potential I've seen in my life, but he's not trained properly. I think he could do it, but not with the little school has taught him." That was the truth anyone could easily see his magical potential, he could be at the level of Merlin and Morgana if it weren't for their lack of education.
Remus began to take deep breaths and holding  for a couple of seconds and releasing. He keeps following that pattern for a few minutes making sure that Harry looked at the room and regained his balance a little. No one wanted to interrupt them in case the situation got worse.
All his life he wished something different. He hoped to have a family like any other child instead of one that hated him for existing most days. When he was introduced to the magical world he thought that he could perhaps get one, or at least he would get a place to fit in finally. Instead he only got a world that expected perfection from him. A world that hoped he would follow the same legacy of courage and achievements of his parents, people he didn't even know what they looked like and barely knew their names most of his life.
"Yes, legally you would be an adult. Of course you would still need to go to school and follow their rules inside the castle. But outside of that no one can tell you that you are obliged to go to that house. You can go through your family's properties to find your own place to live"
Draco did not understand why the Weasley twins kidnapped him. He tried to remember if he had offended them at school but could not remember anything and then it hit him. Harry, it had to be about him. Maybe they did not agree with Harry staying with them or they didn't trust him because of their history. He had to admit that it was suspicious to suddenly be kind to him after so many years antagonizing him. They took him to the dark alley next to the store.
"J'aimerais passer la nuit avec toi. That's more or less all my knowledge of French" Fred said, the Slytherins laughed, "I don't even know what it means I forgot."
"We were so worried when ..." Fred started
"You did smuggle a dragon once" Luna said.
"We are in a small town in Scotland, the exact location is unknown. This is the safe house the Order sent us to. The Malfoy's are here because Lucius was a spy, but his cover was discovered by accident." He didn't want to mention Sirius, that would only alter Harry more. "So they needed to be out of the public eye for a while. I'm here because I wanted a little time out of the Order and with as many people here as protection would be more convenient. You are here because ... we received your note asking for help and we went looking for you"
"It's okay Harry, we will figure it out. " Remus smiles at him and got up from the chair. "Cub, please excuse me, I need to go for a couple of minutes. I will be right back and you need to eat."
"Dumbledore knows a little... at the end of my first year, after everything that happened with the stone, I begged him not to send me there. I told him that they were going to kill me now that I knew about magic. He told me that I had to go back" he remembered when Dumbledore explained to him about the blood wards. Harry spoke with a little bit of anger and bitter humor, "last year he explained that it was because of blood wards. Said that because Petunia took me in, she sealed the charm he put on me. Even if she did it grudgingly, and didn't love me at all, as long as her house was my home it would be the best protection for me
"No problem."
"Can you explain what just happened? Did you become an illegal animagus?" His godfather asked in the angry tone he usually uses in class when the students had already fed him up for the day.
"Sir, I don't appreciate someone yelling at me or insulting me," Vernon jumped out of her way but ended up against one of the walls. The others were surprised by this, she normally wasn't violent in the least, "now, you are going to find Harry immediately."
There was an amused laugh behind them, the other adults were now in the kitchen. Remus seemed to be the one that laughed. He had a smile on his face from seeing the closeness of the two. Narcissa was glowing with happiness, Snape looked like he swallowed a lemon and Lucius was as unexpressive as ever. Well at least they won't need to tell them they are now in a relationship.
Dumbledore looked at both of them for awhile before turning to Harry. "Harry can you come with me. I would like to speak to you in private for a moment."
He looked at Draco expecting to see the other peacefully sleeping hoping that he would tell him all of this was just a strange dream but instead Draco is wide awake looking at him with both confusion and so much sorrow that he felt like someone punched him in the gut.
"It was to be expected, we will have an explanation for this" Lucius say.
"I believe I can help him," said an unfamiliar and cheerful voice.
Mr. Weasley stayed on the sidelines because Molly didn't let him discipline them as he had done with his other children. He had almost no input in their upbringing. That is why the twins said the family and the marriage were getting worse and worse. They had almost no relationship with their mother once they managed to get out of the house, it was the same for Bill and Charlie. All of them felt closer to him than their younger siblings.
"Wait, you can enter The Chamber?" Draco looked at him in shock.
"I'm looking for a birthday gift for Harry." He enjoyed their shock faces for a moment before continuing, "it's a long story. But at the moment he is living with us and we are friends now."
"I didn't know you could smell magic, that's quite impressive. " Narcissa blushed slightly, not sure if Remus could smell her magic and know her feelings. "So it seems that my dragon is finally in love"
"Don't dare put a finger on him" Draco said in a low menacing voice. Ron had a brief moment of fear before his foolish Gryffindor courage kicked in and he was going to say something before Ginny screamed.
"I don't know what happened. As far as I know I have not done the process to become an animagus." He was worried about this, he could feel that his body was different as a human and that was definitely not part of the transformation of a normal animagus. "I knew that Harry was distraught and I needed to get to him in some way, something in me wanted to leave so I let my magic do what it needed ..."
"Drake?" Pansy tentatively said, and when he nodded she threw herself at him and almost choked him with a hug.
"Maybe because I like Draco, that is why people normally date" he is trying to be patient with her, but he didn't like the way she was looking at Draco with such a disdainful look.
"We will discuss more in the morning" Narcissa got up from her seat thinking how to fit so many beds in the small living room.
"Technically yes, but muggleborns and some half-bloods do not receive a significant improvement in their current magic levels because they do not have those years of accumulation behind their name yet. Although there are some exceptions of course, like your mother for example, she was a muggleborn but still had an extensive magical inheritance. Many people believe it's because they have blood from some pureblood line that disappeared at some point in time and manifested itself with them" Remus added. He always found it fascinating how magic can be always traced back to a couple of core families that branch, out later losing their original name.
The problems started sometime after they had Percy, out of nowhere they started to fight constantly. It seemed like they couldn't agree on anything anymore, and with time its only gotten worse. Now they seem to only talk to antagonize each other. They both try to keep it away from the children and the public as much as possible. After all, their children didn't need to know their problems as a couple. He doesn't think they were all that successful, he is sure their oldest heard them more than once.
The night was dreadfully cold, the forest that surrounds the house was uncharacteristically quiet. In one of the tallest tree two figures settled to watch over the lonely house.
Draco wraps his arms around Harry. "Do you think you will be able to do something in the castle since you are the heir of the founders?" No one knew their was still the possibility of an heir for the founders. After all, their blood lines were believed to be extinct. Because of this many of the secret of the castle were supposed to be lost forever.
"Thank you sir, we are going to take that into account" Narcissa replied. They waited a couple of minutes until the doctor said it was safe for Harry to open his eyes.
Draco felt every nerve in his body scream to tear her apart, that was his mate! Who does she think she is touching him like that, he pushed the feeling down, that was definitely an overreaction. He settled for gently grabbing him by the waist and pushing her away from Harry. "Weaslette I would appreciate if you did not touch my boyfriend like that."
"Really? Then we can try to go, I haven't tried since second year but it should be easy." He looked out the window noticing that it was bright outside, they must have been here longer that he thought "Oh the others should wake up soon!"
"How you two have been married this long is a mystery to me, he is insufferable." Severus glared without any real heat behind it.
He could not contain the sorrow that was corroding him now. All he could think of was in their last moments. His mother's screams, the noise of his father's body falling lifeless to the ground, and the face Sirius had while falling into the veil. Their corpses looked at him shouting that they could have been alive if he had not been born in the first place, that their deaths were all his fault.
"Alright.... what do you need to know?" He looked at a spot on the wall and pulled his legs to his chest.
Deciding that this was a losing battle he moved on and smiled at his boyfriend "did you get the prefect badge?"
"I was wondering if you had something to turn teddy bears into spiders?" He was pretty sure the twins would recognize him with that. Fred and George looked at each other for a few seconds before showing a mischievous smile.
"we will support you." They smiled, but suddenly Draco had two wands on his neck.
"She was like a second mother to all of us. Since the beginning she treated us like her sons, she gave us all her love and support always." He loves his parents and he knows they did their best with what they were given. But the Potter's always will have a special place in his heart as his second family. "She knew of my condition... or well I assume they both did. They never questioned me about it or tried to convince James that it was too dangerous to be around me. They actually went out of their way to help me and my parents. They were one of a kind."
"It's amazing, it's really different now" looking in all directions excited.
Remus couldn't help laughing at the face of horror that Severus put on knowing that the twin terrors would be accompanying them. He was also sure that Severus would not contradict Narcissa.
"Who would say that James Potter could be mature?" She pinch his cheek.
"Yes, he is waiting for you upstairs to talk about it." The three of them went to talk to Dumbledore, it wasn't a good idea to make him wait to long.
"No, we need to leave today to tell the rest about all of this," she smiles kindly while helping feeding Atreya.
"They did amazing things with that money." He grabbed Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, mostly out of curiosity, while Harry grabbed some sugar hexes and some glow in the dark bubble gum.
"Watch where you walk Weasley" he sneered. "Behave" whispered Harry just for Draco to hear. The other rolled his eyes pushing the girl away from him carefully.
Harry read the papers carefully, the only thing he learned from Uncle Vernon was to always read the contracts before signing them. They were normal documents that said he was the legal head of this house and that he assumed the responsibilities that this entailed as the goblin had summed up previously. He was worried about not being able to handle so much magic at once. But it was the only way to finally free himself from his relatives and have all his magical potential could only help him against Voldemort. He made the decision to sign everything, one by one he put the rings on his fingers.
" You caught a snitch with your mouth in your first game" said George.
a snake looked in his direction, the snake was a beautiful silver with black eyes and green gem on her forehead.
"keep in mind that it's a favor"
The two were in the garden most of the day talking about everything under the sun. One of the first issues they addressed was actually their other friends. Draco was happy to talk about Pansy and Blaise, they have been his best friends practically since they were born. He missed them a lot, since his family escaped he has not been able to communicate with them more than a few short notes. They know that he is well and alive. Crabbe and Goyle were his friends for his name and his supposed ties to the Dark Lord. He really didn't know what would happen now that they know the truth.
"Really?" he couldn't hide his excitement for this.
"Blood quill" Severus said in a faint voice. "Why didn't you report this? Did she do this to anyone else?!"
"Everything?" Harry asks, "is that what you put in the letter?"
"Yes perfect," everyone sat down except the twins whom grabbed Draco's arms and started to pull him away.
"Whoever I'm with is not your concern Weasley." Ron glared and he held his ground, keeping eye contact. He knew this was probably not the last time he would have to defend his relationship, he might as well get used to it.
After a couple of minutes the shield surrounding Harry and Draco fell. The adults approached them slowly as a precaution of whether Draco was in a more primitive state of mind due to his current form.
"That is dreadful" Narcissa said.
Remus could not believe that he did not go check for himself that Harry was well. That he blindly believed Dumbledore every time he told him that Harry was happy and well taken care of with his family.
The appointment with the bank was set early in the morning. This way they had time to get a couple of things from Diagon Alley. Narcissa wanted to buy him a new wardrobe and fix his eyes. He was willing to follow her after how sweet she had been with him, even though he was not enthusiastic about buying clothes.
Draco relaxed and knowing what it was they wanted to know made it easy to answer. "I don't plan to hurt him, I promise. I just want to know him better" he smiled.
"I will ignore that for now." He groaned looking at the window, the sun was not out so it was definitely too early to deal with this. At least it seems that Harry is happy, so it wasn't a nightmare. "What has you so lively this early?"
she sounded surprised but happy.
During that summer he also had another thing occupying his mind, he just couldn't stop thinking about Potter. He wished he could say that was a novelty but it wasn't. The guy had always managed to be in Draco's head one way or another. Ever since the first moment in Madam Malkin's when he saw those beautiful green eyes on the scrawny and shy boy, he was in trance, and something called him to this boy for reasons he couldn't come close to comprehend. Even after he had been humiliated by said boy their first night at Hogwarts he could not stop watching him all the time, craving his eyes on him constantly. He even decided to bully him to have Potter more aware of him. And yes, he is completely aware it is pathetic, but he just couldn't deal with not having Potter's attention.
"That has Harry's blood!" He was up and ready to leave in seconds until Narcissa put a delicate hand on his face.
"I thought they would ask for more explanations than that" Lucius said.
Narcissa jumps into action immediately and checks his vitals. She's relieved when she sees that everything is fine and that his body is only readjusting to the new magic.
you will not need a wand, don't worry."
Harry opened his eyes carefully when they told him he could. Everything was blurry around him at first, but little by little his eyes began to focus. He was surprised at how much sharper everything was and how the colors looked more saturated this way. It was much better that his glasses could ever do.
"I think your mother would prefer to call it a small infatuation, but a crush could be the word also" deciding to ignore Harry's look at the moment he got up pulling Severus out of the room with him.
"shut up that is no true, I didn't kill anyone! I'm sorry I didn't do it" Harry started to repeat hysterical.
Draco considered this for a moment. He trusts his family but they would ask too many questions for which neither of them had an answer. "We should wait for a little while, at least until we understand it better."
When they returned to the center of Diagon Alley the twins had to return to their shop. The adults agreed to give them the address of the safe house to visit Harry or send him letters. Shortly after they left, Draco grabbed Harry's arm excitedly.
They all jumped into action grabbing Harry as best as they could trying to keep him from moving, which was rather difficult since Harry was thrashing wildly. Narcissa opted for cutting the shirt and quickly applied a glamour to the scars on Harry's back just in case the others hadn't seen them already.
"I know this must be difficult for you Severus, but right now the child needs you to be in your best shape. You owe him at least that" Lucius's voice always took him to a state of calm, where he could reorganize his mind safely.
This chapter is very short and most of it was written with me being very sick so I'm sorry if it's terrible.
"Cub, I sat through one too many speeches about Draco for you to be laughing now."
"Yes and you were doing such a good job at it" Remus said sarcastically.
"I doubt she would asks you to like him, I guess he doesn't have much love for you either, but both of you should be polite now that we'll help the Potter boy"
Conversation flowed much easier after that, but just when they were about to finish the meal Draco noticed Mr. Weasley was a little bit tense when he was asked something. It was obvious he didn't want to talk about whatever issue that made him go to his father for help with them there.  He made eye contact with Harry, he saw that the other boy thought the same. "Harry, I wanted to go see Fred and George can you come with me?" This caught the attention of the rest of the table.
"Mom didn't react well." Both twins winced at the memory. "They ended up yelling at each other for an hour more or less, she doesn't approve of Fleur..."
"The circumstances have changed Headmaster. That place is not my home any longer as I did the process to legally emancipate myself from them. And you said so yourself, I was safe there as long as it was my home. But it's not anymore." Dumbledore shivered at the snake language. He hated the ability and as soon as the war was over he would make sure Harry never used it again.
"It is not my fault, he is bloody gorgeous and an excellent Chaser! And it's not like you don't fancy his wife, I remember very clearly how you drooled over her in our fourth year."  He mocked the face of outrage she did.
"Darling, is there a problem here?" Draco couldn't take it anymore, he wanted to kill this guy for looking at his Harry in such an lewd way. He didn't stop to think that technically Harry wasn't his.
"So that's what happened, I forced my inheritance" Draco said.  "What do you think father?"
"It sounded aggressive but Harry's magic responded to that by letting you approach him" Remus added. "It makes no sense, Harry's magic should have rejected you if you were a threat."
"How many times do I have to tell you no? I just want the price of this snake, please." He rolled his eyes and didn't realize the lewd way the guy was looking at him.
"We are tired of being your friends you bloody idiot. Why would we want to be with a whiny git like you?" Ron said laughing and continued in a mocking imitation "Oh I'm famous poor me, I have a fortune and good name oh the horror."
This chapter is longer than the other ones. I got a little carried away, hope you like it :)
"For someone younger, you sometimes speak wisely" safely nestled in his arms.
"You told me you let a dangerous snake free in a muggle zoo" Remus decided to add.
Harry let out a loud scream and started to thrash around more than before bringing back the attention to the problem. She spoke again sounding distressed, "Please, this will be even more painful if you don't let me help him."
"This house may be safe for them but you are a different matter" he used his usual kind smile. "The Weasleys are worried sick about you. Molly hasn't stopped asking for you and poor Misses Weasley cries every day for you. I'm sure they would love to know you are safe with your family again."
"What they said, it was true then. If we couldn't in that life, the next one we would have another chance." Sighing at the ominous message, "what do we do?"
"Because he has an incredible taste of course." He laughs at the unimpressed expression he received. "And most likely he likes to be on higher ground."
"Yes, you are in perfect condition to take your lordship now" Narcissa responds.
"When has this happened?" Lucius asked concerned. He knew most teachers were incompetent, but they didn't seem dangerous.
"Everything is fine, you are doing very well just keep copying my breathing, nobody is going to hurt you I promise." After a couple more minutes Harry seemed to calm down enough to speak, even if he was still gripping Remus's hand with all his strength. "I will explain everything I promise Harry."
"The will of a wizard uses a concept similar to a pensieve memory. The only difference being that it is impossible for someone external to manipulate it since it is sealed with the blood of the people involved. That is what gives it the dark color" Remus explained. "This can only be opened by the blood of a family member. In special cases the wizard can put the name of another person, that way their blood would work as well".
"He's a parselmouth" Lucius said when Harry was out of earshot.
"We know but ..."
"Tough luck, you are getting one." Draco started to drag him while the other remained at a safe distance.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You deserve it. You are the only teacher we actually learned something useful from," smiling and added as an afterthought, "and also the only one that wasn't trying to kill me or harm me on purpose."
"Thank you, a bed sounds wonderful. We have been sleeping in the woods for months" Kaly said gesturing to her sore neck.
"No no no no no! Please, I'm sorry, I didn't want this to happen. Please, I'm sorry!" He screamed hysterically.
"What makes you think that?" Lucius asked him. He did not like the calm tone he used, as if this was a well known fact to which he had already resigned himself. As true as his assumption may be, it is not right for a teenager to have that kind of certainty that he will die young.
Draco blushed slightly at that, but his body moved before he could think. Slowly approaching the bed until he was next to Harry.
"How did you make them disappear" Harry asked. He was now able to move a little more but everything felt numb still.
"Look at us! I carry you for 9 months and this is what you do to us? Killing us and your godfather?" Lily adds.
"What are we going to do father?" It was the only thing Draco could ask him.
"Not likely, they don't buy their supplies until last minute normally." He stopped walking abruptly startling Harry. He spoke a little nervous "I...I wanted to tell them what happen on your birthday...if that is okay with you of course."
Kaly nodded and smiled sadly "I did, I saw everything and I knew you wouldn't have survived much longer like that. It was the only way to help I could think of without revealing myself."
"I see, how did you find this place?" He did not look happy. Everyone was tense, waiting to see the situation unfold.
Sit libera / let them free or at least that is what google told me
"I'm fine sir, thank you" he faked a smile.
"Oh, you don't know?"  Tilting his head to the side, at the astonish faces he elaborated
"You couldn't know Remus. And you are not the one who put him there, you love Harry like your own son and you are not to blame for this."
"Yes they did answer some things, but now I have even more questions." He pulled the other boy closer putting a protective arm around his waist.
"Oh Harry, I had never hated you not really. There have been times where you have irritated me, but it was never hate." He got closer to Harry, sitting on the bed next to him.  "I'm being nicer because well, I would like to know you better now. I know very well that I had been unpleasant with you for a long time ... I have treated you horrible and made your life more difficult than it already is. I am very sorry for all that I have done to you. I kept a stupid resentment for something that happened years ago where I was the one who was wrong. I had been a git, of course you weren't going to want to have me around. I would like to be able to start over with you if possible. I am very sorry for everything I did in recent years and I will understand if you do not want to start over. There have been many years of hostility for a simple apology to really fix anything. I understand if you do not want to, I will not hold a grudge this time if you don't accept."
"Okay, I have no idea what any of this is," George finally said.
The only part of this new memory that he could comprehend completely was Altais. Everything about him was clear as day, his smile, his temper, every little conversation they had together and most important his feelings for him. It was odd to say the least he loved him with a heart that doesn't completely feel like his own. He feels the pain of his loss but he can't distinguish how much of that is his own and how much is second hand emotion from Harwind if there is any difference between the two. He can see how Altais resembles Draco, not only in appearance but in personality. But he can also see that they aren't exactly the same and his mind and heart don't seem to know what to do with all off these new and strange feelings and it was overwhelming him.
Remus hugged her like a life line, he knew he should keep some distance taking in consideration that she is a married woman. He couldn't help it, his wolf picked her to be his mate the moment he saw her, whether he wanted to or not. Remus needs her more than he needs to breath right now.
"Thank you, happy birthday as well Harry." Neville beamed, they got closer to the other, the twins greeting them warmly. Neville looked at the Malfoy heir very nervously, he was an easy target for his bullying a lot of the time unlike Harry he rarely, if ever, fought back.
"I wasn't thanking you! You probably tripped her on purpose!" As always Ron's temper rose to the bait easily.
"No, they left a little after I woke up. Kaly said they need to inform the rest of their people about this and collect some more information."
"Darkness Powder is resistant to many Light-creation spells,"
"Hey! It wasn't a cheap one, I have standards" she said indignantly.
He was confused, mate? What was that supposed to mean?! He followed the instructions either way if just to try to help Harry. The moment he touched Harry's head he understood what she meant, he felt like someone was repeatedly stabbing him and the air was like sandpaper in his throat. He was about to let go when he noticed that Harry wasn't moving around as much as before. He was still in pain, but it was more manageable with him sharing it now. He stilled himself to take it, if this was helping Harry he sure as hell wasn't going to let him suffer through it alone.
"I think the same Dragon, it's normal for the Malfoy family to have multiple lords" his mother said as she stood up to inform the goblins.
"I might have been a tiny bit obsessed, but stop being dramatic." He rolled his eyes, "how have thing been for both of you?"
"Uh, nothing..." looking anywhere but the blonde now.
He smiled at the scowl he got from both of them. "Hello, Blaise, Pansy, it has been a while since we saw each other." Their eyes widened dramatically once they recognized his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry look at me." Remus acts quickly knowing that Harry was going to have a panic attack. He had already dealt with many of them with Sirius and Peter at school, and with Harry a couple of times when the lessons with the boggart were a little longer than usual or it was a bad day for the teen. "Breath with me I know this looks bad, but I promise you that you are 100% safe, try to follow my breathing cub."
Draco didn't know what to do, he was completely incompetent in the emotional department. Pansy even said she preferred to cry to a brick wall than him any day. He didn't want to make this worse... so he decided to go on instinct. He hugged the boy back, letting him settle in his lap while rubbing his back and whispering comforting words.
"Oh I'm not sure. What will the centaurs do to someone that called them filthy half-breeds?" said with a smirk.
"Just make sure you know,"
"I can't, every time I move he starts to wake up and seems to be in anguish." He moves a little and immediately Harry clings to his shirt making a sound almost like an injured puppy.
"Are you absolutely sure this has his blood?" his father asks with a neutral tone.
"How does Lovegood know this place?" Draco asked, the girl always freaked him out. The aura around her was a little unnerving to him.
Draco was panicking, Harry's screams were almost physically painful for him. Having to hold him down for him to be able to take the pain was unbearable. He knew he wasn't the only one feeling like this, the four of them were sweating with the effort and the distress was more than clear in all of them. He noticed the taller girl was looking at him like he was supposed to do something, which just made him even more hysterical and annoyed "What?!"
"Arthur I'm sorry" Remus said. He was very surprised, he never thought they would split up. They have been together for so long it seems impossible to see them any other way.
"if Harry stops being happy with you,"
"What?" blushing a little at the question, oh he could and it drove him absolutely crazy every second they were near each other.
Narcissa could not stop the gasp that fell from her lips. Unable to grasp how someone could do something like that to another human being, much less to a child. Harry must have heard her because in a matter of seconds. He jumped from his position to the far end of the bed, looking at them with pure fear in his big emerald eyes that without his typical glasses looked larger. His face looked so childish even with his hollow cheeks.
"you were during lunch today."
No one said anything, not even Fred or George dared speak right now. It was obvious that their questions were not going to be answered yet.
"They have what?!" Narcissa said
"Wow make me sound more desperate please" rolling his eyes "I haven't been talking about him since I was six."
"This was extremely reckless Harry. Taking your lordship was dangerous, you could have died in the process." Dumbledore was trying to sound worried, Harry wasn't buying it. "I know you feel like they don't love you my boy, but of course they do. They are your family, I'm sure they miss you terribly, and you need to be somewhere where Tom can't find you."
Harry looked up at the growl, he didn't feel it like the others had for him it wasn't something to be afraid of. It was more of like a gentle request to approach him. His magic reacted before he did, letting the big animal into the barrier he created. The animal stood in front of him, lowering his head to Harry's level of vision. His size could be scary but his eyes looked so warm and gentle. Something primal in him felt that he would be safe with the creature, that he would take care of him and drive away the grief. No one dared to move when the tiger settled around Harry letting him curl up in his fur.
"I still don't like the werewolf" he still resents him for not stopping the rest of the Marauders "but it's not like I haven't been making that potion for years"
"Mister Potter, may I ask how are you feeling? " the goblin asked while analyzing the damage in the room.
"No no no no this is not real, it's not real!" he shut his eyes tightly. "Please go away, please go away." He slowly opened his eyes after some time passed to find himself in the middle of the Death Chamber. He was witnessing Bellatrix attacking Sirius again, and perfectly saw how the life was leaving his eyes. He tried to run to him but his body did not respond to him anymore.
"People with a working sleeping schedule?" Raising an eyebrow he heard this argument countless times before. Harwind never really learned how to get out of bed without waking the other up or well it was more that he loved how grumpy the other got so he never tried not to do it.
"If Mr. Potter allows you to be in the hearing then it would not be a problem. On the issue of emancipation, we would need to check the capacity of his current magical core before he can sign the forms." He looked at Harry for an answer.
"My intentions?" Draco asked.
that is the translation google gave me i hope it's correct but it should be something in that realm at least
Having a baby is a challenge by itself. To have one when you are a young couple and in the middle of a war, it must have been a nightmare. All logic must have told them that it was a terrible idea, that they should have just ended the pregnancy... but they decided to go against all logic and have their child, love him for as long as they could and hope to live long enough to raise him.
Of course we will"
"Fleur? She was nice when I got to now her in the tournament." Harry liked Fleur. She hadn't been nice to him at first, with all the accusations of him cheating to enter the tournament, but after the second task she started to be extremely friendly with him. She even sent a couple of letters with her support last year. "How did your family react? Mrs. Weasley always talked about how much she wanted one of you to finally get married."
"Lady Potter." She looked surprised so he elaborated, he spoke with a sweet smile on his face lost in memories. "We used to go to James's house for at least one month every summer. Lord and Lady Potter were the kindest people I have ever met. They never judged or insulted anyone and everyone was always welcome at their home. She told me this in our fifth year when James decided that he would become an auror instead of a professional quidditch player as he had wanted since childhood..." He could remember that day very clearly. It was painful to see James letting go of his dream like that, but his desire for saving others was always bigger than his love for quidditch. "They were not happy about that, they were worried sick. They knew after all, everyone knew, that times were dangerous. Lord Potter tried his best to talk him out of it but Lady Potter never said a word against his decision."
"See if I do anything nice for you again" it was a completely empty threat and everyone knew it.
"Hey!" He looked at the rest for some support but it didn't come. "Traitors. When have I ever done something stupidly dangerous?"
"You're not as subtle"
"I'm fine, I promise. Just little weaker than usual." Something came up to mind suddenly. "Miss do you think we can go to a store before going for the rest of the things?"
"I don't know, Luna just has her ways" he shrugs while reading the second letter.
"God dammit, wake up and smell the cheap motel darling. You are just the lover" Blaise said pinching the bridge of his nose.
"What dear?" Narcissa asked with the barest hint of a smile now that she was looking at him.
"Alright, thank you for your kindness" he smiled and they waited for Remus and Severus and quietly made their way to a restaurant.
"How many owls..."
"It's not imposing, we are inviting you" Lucius said calmly.
In the last year he saw how bad the pressure was hitting Harry. He could see that it was crushing him, the constant flow of hate from people who thought he was crazy for saying that the Dark Lord came back and the way Umbridge was dead set in breaking his spirit slowly but steady. He doesn't know what kind of detention she was giving Potter, but he knew that it drained him. Potter lookd pale and dead. His eyes were lacking the emotion that before they were so full of. Draco knew that he was close to snapping but he couldn't do much to help. The only thing he could do was not give him as much detention and try help him if he could to keep his little defense club a secret as long as possible. But once someone told Umbridge their location, nothing could be done there.
"Is there a way for us to contact them if anything happens?" He was still unsure if he wanted to share what they learned last night but they might have to at some point.
"Oh Harry" he hugged the boy a little tighter, "it's not your fault. You weren't the one that killed them, the Dark Lord is the one that decided to target you. It is not your fault."
"Love, are you sure it's a good idea?" James said a little nervous.
He blushes furiously, he had clung to Draco Malfoy while he slept, that was mortifying enough without even considering his current state. It is one thing to have a crush on him and a very different one was to act like a clingy child demanding that he hold him while he slept. He decided not to think about it now and concentrated on classifying the rest of the information he just received, something had stood out for him.
It was strange to see them like this, he didn't like it one bit, he had grown accustomed to Narcissa's kind smile and Draco's laugh and expressive eyes. Even if their mask of indifference was one he had saw for most of the time he has known them the change made him uneasy, like he needed to be on high alert of everything.
"Too early," Draco pulled him closer looking very grumpy at waking up at this hour.
Charlie has always moved to his own rhythm since he found his calling in life after he read a book about dragons at the age of four. He has never wavered or doubted his choice, even with Molly's very vocal disapproval. They see him once a year for Christmas if they are lucky and even then he is not comfortable and goes back to Romania as soon as he possibly can.
Harry found himself in a strange room that was dark and cold. He walked for a while until he found something familiar. In front of him it was the Mirror of Erised just as it was in his first year. He got closer, expecting to see his parents smiling at him, but instead he just found them watching him with hatred and disdain.
"Yes, they are quite healthy and I made it in time to take them out safely. I would say in couple of weeks they should settle into your body enough for flying."
Harry loved talking to Draco, he was impressed by how different the boy was without his Malfoy mask. He was so expressive and passionate when he talked about his friends, he couldn't wait to meet them. They sounded fun and different from the people he had met until now in the other houses. When he talked about Hermione and Ron, Draco didn't ask for the details even when he was quite vague with the information he gave him. They had been horrible, he could not believe these people he trusted with his life would abandon him like they did.
"I couldn't sleep..." she said honestly and sat down on the foot of the bed.
"Why would we be? We are always in your shadow and we just get in trouble constantly. Why would we stick around someone like you? You are not even interesting, you are the most boring person I have ever met. Even Percy is more interesting to talk to than you"  Ron said. "It's just a matter of time before we get killed thanks to you. Look at Cedric, he barely talked to you. He couldn't be with you for more than a hour and he got killed."
"You want to continue then?" the goblin did the same process with the next bottle leaving them alone while collecting the studies that were done in Harry's blood.
All of them were on edge for days after that, the uncertainty of the whole situation was the worst. His father was away from home most of the summer either in a meeting with You-Know-Who, in a raid, or sending reports to Dumbledore. His mother seemed to always be a little distant even if she did try to smile for him. Draco was kind of numbed by the information, he couldn't really grasp the concept of a war. Yes he was born in one technically, but it ended before he had use of memory so it always sounded like a foreign concept for him. It was something you just know happened and learned about in school, but never imagined you are gonna live in it. He is certain he will have to live through it, you don't have a father like Lucius Malfoy and get to be neutral.
Draco felt a stab of guilt hearing that, he often forgets that Pansy's father is a real death eater. Of course he has been away for a while, the little they have gathered about the outside word is that the Dark Lord has been attacking more often that ever, now than people are aware of his existence again. Her relationship with both her parents is strained at best. They kicked her out of the house and almost disowned her when she came out to them. For most pureblood families homosexuality isn't a big deal, if some were okay with inbreeding they certainly didn't have the hypocrisy to judge others preferences. But the Parkinson's were the exception to that, ironically taking more of the muggle believes in marriage. Pansy cried for days after not knowing what to do with herself if they disowned her, they took her back just because Draco's parents were going to legally adopt Pansy and that would reflect poorly on them as a family.
"Hey it wasn't my fault, Salazar Slytherin was the one that put it there in the first place, and that diary gave Ginny the capability to set it free." Harry tried to make it sound better, "Fawkes helped me a lot and I survived the bite just fine."
"You two are the first ones of our species being born outside of our circle" Kaly decided to continue the conversation, she seemed a bit distressed "that was supposed to not be possible."
Harry sat down and all of them started to eat and chat happily, even Snape seemed to be enjoying the morning after being forced out of bed for this. Draco and Harry went to the garden until the twins arrived.
"That's it, I'm done this is not worth it!" Ron shouted after receiving his first detention with Umbridge.
She was practically jumping for joy, she had worried when her baby showed absolutely no interest in any of the marriage candidates they had presented him with. They did not want to pressure him or make a marriage contract without his consent as their parents did to them, but it is improper and frowned upon for an heir like Draco not to be properly betrothed by the time he is of age.
"Morning, I hope you like it." Harry sat next to him waiting for the others to come down. "I didn't want to wake you up, I'm a bit of an early riser."
It was a simple corner shop with a big sign that said "Mr. Wright's Optician." He was incredibly nervous, he had never gone to have his eyes checked before. His glasses were ones that Aunt Petunia found in a charity container and said, "They work well enough for him to do his housework." The place was painted in pastel blue for the most part, it had many different models of glasses on the wall.
