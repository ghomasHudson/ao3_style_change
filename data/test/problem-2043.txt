Draco Malfoy stirred restlessly on the musty couch, looking very much worse for wear. His right eye was swollen shut, his lips were split in three places, there were cuts all over his hands, a slash across his chest, a wrist broken, and a few ribs cracked.
A few minutes later, Harry was knocking at the door to the Burrow while Scorpius and Teddy stood behind him. The little boy was looking about in awe at the strange plants half-hidden behind fences. This house was like the ones he read about in his picture books. It was old and had ivy growing on the outside. The windows were crooked and the walls seemed to sway with the wind.
Ron and Hermione were still trying to get their bearings. Teddy was gushing over the photographs. Scorpius wasn't sure what to think yet. He stuck close to Teddy, his eyes round and his mouth open as he took in his fifteen minutes of fame.
And so the two Malfoys began setting the table for dinner. Scorpius was spacing out the fork from the knife evenly while Draco folded the napkins, watching his son for a few moments. The kid was impossible. "Hey."
Draco stifled his annoyed sigh and walked over to the old sofa that threw up a cloud of dust when he sat on it. As he waved the dust out of his face, he said, "I'm trying to be civil." He drank a bit of tea while watching Harry's demeanor. His back was turned. He wore light jeans smeared with dirt and a plain grey tee, crumpled and creased. Tufts of dark hair lay in an untidy mess atop his head, also covered in spiderwebs. He stood with his weight on one foot, using his other foot to poke at some ash that had fallen on the floor. Draco pushed those subconscious observations away. "What do you want, Potter?"
Scorpius flew down to meet Harry, Draco trailing behind him. The boy had the biggest and proudest grin on his face.
"Alright." Harry downed the last of the tea in one gulp. "How am I supposed to say no to him?" He looked at Draco expectantly.
"Who's that?" Scorpius raced out of the study, across the corridor, down the grand staircase, and into the foyer where he threw open the door expectantly.
Draco had been watching him change right before his eyes since September. "It's school," he said. "You read about it in books, you know, how his personality will develop once he socializes and all that. I never realized just how much he would change. The things he says are… terrifying, really. He's so smart." Draco reached out to push a lock of pale blonde hair away from Scorpius' shut eyes. "Harry says he is respectful and kind. He's a perfectionist. Works hard at school."
"I'm thinking of waiting until I'm dead so that you can tell him all about my life," Draco grumbled.
In the upcoming weeks, it soon became apparent that the students favored playtime and drawing hour more than the time they spent on academic learning. Gabrielle and Harry were always exhausted come nap-time. This year's class seemed to be much more energetic than the classes they had taught before.
Draco had to cover up his laugh behind a cough. He set the quill down on his desk after managing a straight face. "Wherever did you get that attitude?"
"On." Scorpius picked up a book from the pile at the foot of the bed. He had asked Patricia for them before she left. "I'll read to Dad. I'm not sleepy yet."
Without thinking, Draco reached out to stop Harry. His warm hand slid over Harry's chilled palm, cold from the harsh wind outside. Their fingers entwined.
"Some of those are priceless, Potter," Draco exclaimed as he heard bottles clanging together in the dark. "Watch it." Just when he finished his warning, he heard stumbling and falling.
"Yes. I know. Now drink up, Mr. Potter, or I'll have to call your doctor over and I'm sure he'd be more than willing to prescribe something else. I hear the stronger stuff literally burns as it goes down."
A cool breeze rustled the leaves above them. He titled his head up and shut his eyes. Even behind his lids, he sensed beams of light flickering through the branches of the old tree. He breathed in the scent of autumn around him. It was a beautiful day. He cracked his eyes open and looked at Draco, near enough to make out faint wrinkles at the corner of his eye, watching him pretend to read.
She watched the boy eat stiffly for a moment before leaning towards him. "I like your name," she whispered. "It's pretty."
That afternoon, as the day was coming to an end, the students had some study time before school let out. The classroom buzzed with a quiet din as children painstakingly worked on their shapes. Scorpius was engrossed in his work, keeping the book steady with one hand and dragging his pencil down the page with the other.
Harry sat down on the bed and rubbed his sandy eyes with his fist. In the background, doors opened and shut , water ran steady, and there were quiet footsteps. He laid down on the cool mattress. He was aware of lights being extinguished and the mattress dipping beside him. He drifted off to a heavy sleep a breath later, just as Draco pulled him close.
Luna Lovegood tossed a pinch of salt over one shoulder and sugar over the other before digging into tea and scones. She had picked up very peculiar tics following her trips to South America. Her greenhouse was filled with exotic plants, bugs, reptiles, and birds. Harry had to duck a few times to stop a purple moonjay from making a nest in his hair. He pushed a translucent lizard away from the butter dish. "I see you've brought a few friends back from the expedition this time."
In fact, that was exactly what she was doing. Harry didn't do well with gratitude, so he just smiled sheepishly while she articulated her appreciation. "He has changed so much over this past year," she said. "I know Draco won't tell you himself, but the kindness you have shown Scorpius has made him grow leaps and bounds."
"Of course," Harry murmured before leading the way out into the deserted hallways. The children were being put down for nap-time. Harry heard quiet whispers behind him and realized that the Malfoys were talking to each other. Scorpius seemed to tuck his emotions away around people he didn't know. It was so strange to see the transformation when he was around his father. Harry grabbed Scorpius' bag and coat from the small cubbyhole near the door to the classroom. The blinds were shut and none of the lights were on. Gabrielle was walking up and down the rows of students, making sure all of them were asleep. She jerked her brows questioningly at Harry who gave her a thumbs-up in turn before walking out the door and handing Scorpius' things off to Draco.
the smartest," Scorpius insisted. "If you keep being nice to me, then... then... That's why I-" He broke off as fresh tears rolled down his chubby cheeks.
The boys wanted to make a snowman. The four of them spent the last of the daylight rolling up snow into the likeness of a snowman, three huge snowballs stacked on top of each other, complete with Teddy's scarf, Scorpius' mittens, pebbles for eyes and a stick for a nose. Satisfied and thoroughly drenched, they headed inside the Malfoy Manor for some well-earned hot chocolate and dinner.
Rose Weasley, a plump red-headed toddler with a heart of gold, patted Harry's cheek, a cute pout bunching her lips together. "Ouchie?"
Victoire threw open the door excitedly. "Teddy!" she crowed as she bounded the last few steps and threw herself at him. Scorpius jumped out of the way just in time because a torrent of children rushed out after her, all of them wanting to hug a piece of Teddy. He was obviously a very popular young man. Harry simply laughed as he ushered Scorpius past the chattering crowd. Inside was a more domestic crowd of adults gathered casually in and around the dining table and kitchen. Most of them were redheads and most of them had a derisive brow arched at the sight of pale Scorpius Malfoy who was hiding behind Harry.
Scorpius didn't really care that Harry wasn't married. He was just wondering. Maybe because Harry already had Teddy for a lot of years, even though Teddy was off at Hogwarts now, Harry didn't feel lonely in that big house all by himself. He had said that he didn't mind, but still, Scorpius wasn't sure. If Harry was so nice, why didn't he have a perfect family? And who was this mysterious girl who made Harry so sad?
Harry stepped up to Draco, eyes narrowed, and asked, "Are you going to pick these up?" He gestured at the books on the floor.
Harry grabbed Draco by the collar and forced him outside, slamming the door shut behind them. Draco was too startled to protest and Scorpius jumped in fright when he heard the loud crash of the door striking the jamb. Harry was seething now. "Now you listen to me, Malfoy," he growled. "I couldn't care
"Don't say that." Harry patted Draco's back. "You heard him. He wants to spend the day with you. He means it, you know? He really does like having you around."
"I suppose." Draco straightened Harry's jacket and stepped back. He hadn't seen Potter in a getup like this since they were children. He cleaned up well. "You should wear this more often."
One afternoon, at recess, Harry snapped out of his work when he heard a commotion in the playground. He found a small group gathered by the monkey bars. As he approached them, he could see Gabrielle consoling a
Draco looked up at Harry. He hadn't realized until then that he had a faint frown on his brow. He quickly smoothed it out. "Pardon?"
"At night, fevers spike. That's probably why he had nightmares. It happens. He seems perfectly happy now. You did everything you are supposed to. And..." Harry took a moment to revel in the hug. He realized this was the first time he had hugged Draco. "Next time, call me sooner." It felt nice.
know what possessed him. Draco Malfoy had possessed him. He would never have raised his voice or said such hurtful things to anyone else. Malfoy knew how to push his buttons, even after all these years. And Harry had fallen for it too, just like old times. Although he stood behind everything he said, now he was kicking himself for letting Malfoy goad him into being the fool. On top of all that, Scorpius was angry with him. The boy would hardly talk to him anymore, simply glaring instead. That signature Malfoy glare. It was all too much.
Draco supposed so. Scorpius' fascination with his new teacher. Scorpius insisting on seeing his cousin. Scorpius asking Harry over for dinner. Scorpius wanting someone to teach him to fly. Halloweens, birthdays, adventures, all for Scorpius. He nodded.
Draco rolled his eyes as he turned to the cupboard. "People make fun of you if you act like a baby."
"It was too late then too." Astoria finished sipping the last of the wine and set the empty glass on the parapet. "No matter how much we talked or tried, I think it was too late then too. And that's okay." She turned to face him, draping her arms over his shoulders. "I never imagined my life at thirty to be like this - a mother, divorced, spending months abroad, writing. I never imagined this, but now I can't imagine
Harry was halfway through his first bowl of cereal when the two boys came in with damp faces and freshly brushed teeth. They sat opposite Harry and set about shoveling breakfast into their mouths, paying no heed to Draco who was constantly clearing his throat and pulling faces at their lack of manners. Only after finishing a bowl did Scorpius suddenly realize something. He looked up at Harry. "Did you sleep over too?" he exclaimed in disbelief.
Ron Weasley came into the drawing room in search of his daughter. He rolled his eyes when he found her coddling Harry. "Done feeling sorry for yourself yet?" he asked.
Harry didn't deny it. He had been lounging on the sofa, twiddling his thumbs, and staring at Draco for a while now. Draco sat in an armchair and was going through some letters. Scorpius was at the other end of the sofa, by Harry's feet, carefully colouring in a picture book he had on his lap. "Is this all you two do on Sundays?" Harry finally asked.
" He twirled them dizzy. As they stumbled away in opposite directions, he caught the spoon Teddy had thrown to him. Victoire and Dominique jumped down onto the bench. They twisted up and down, rocking the bench precariously, and Harry pretended to scream into the spoon along with the song, just as he clapped eyes on Draco standing at the foot of the stairs.
"I was worried." Scorpius snatched the napkins out of Draco's hands. He began placing them beside the plates. "That's not a problem."
"Because it's Christmas Eve, everyone comes to the Burrow," Teddy explained. "That's where Aunty Molly and Uncle Arthur live. It's always crowded in there, so it's a lot of fun."
He rarely had an opportunity to converse like this with anyone. At work, he was all business. At home, he was with Scorpius. Potter was welcome company, strangely enough. They had been at each other's throat for long enough that they had gotten comfortable with it. After all, they had known each other since the beginning. They had been through the worst together. They had reached the lowest point in their lives in the presence of each other, in that abandoned bathroom and on top of the Astronomy tower. Harry knew nearly every heinous thing Draco had done, yet here he was, in the manor, about to have dinner at the same table.
"I'm not going anywhere." Draco moved his wand upwards so cold air could blow onto the bed. Then he gingerly laid down against the pillows with Scorpius still holding him tight. "You don't have to go back to sleep if you don't want to."
Draco had a way about him, an aloof air that Harry begrudged. When they were younger, Harry had assumed that Draco was putting on a pretentious act. Once in a while there would be cracks, like the disastrous bathroom incident in Sixth Year or when Draco had asked Harry to take care of Scorpius if anything were to happen. But those cracks would soon smooth over into an effortless mask of apathetic superiority. Harry began to wonder if maybe it wasn't an act after all. Maybe Draco really was a cold person.
Teddy jumped off the sofa and parked himself in front of them with his hands on his hips. "I'm Harry Potter," he announced, pushing his imaginary spectacles up his nose. "I like to blow up my kitchen because cleaning up is
"I can do what I want with it," Ginny argued. "What else am I supposed to do with it? Carry it around in my trunk? Marvel at it when I'm half-asleep after practice? You'll obviously take better care of it, Harry. When I want it back, I'll ask for it." She placed the box firmly in his hands. "It's for you and you're not allowed to say no on Christmas. Besides, I wouldn't be where I am without you."
He came to an stumbling halt when he was met with Harry, who was sitting outside the booking office. They blinked at each other, but Draco quickly gathered his wits. "Potter."
"It's a surprise. My uncle has a shop in Diagon Alley and I bought it. " Teddy reached inside the bag, grabbed something and tossed it into his mouth. "With my own money too. It's pretty good. Don't worry, it's not poison. I wouldn't try to poison you. At least, not yet. I have to get to know you first."
To say Astoria was livid would be an understatement. Draco had to silence the study so her explosive ranting couldn't be overheard by their son.
"I don't know," Scorpius mumbled as he quickly finished up his sweet and stuffed the pouch into his pocket. "What is it?"
He jumped a foot in the air when he heard footsteps by the door. He zoomed over and pulled it open with a flourish.
"I just wanted to say how well you are doing in class," Harry said to him. "You are respectful of all the other boys and girls. You don't make a fuss about anything. And I've notice the effort you're putting in to make friends. I just want you to know that you are doing well, alright?"
"Because." Harry stretched his arms above him and yawned. They were in his bedroom at 12 Grimmauld Place, and they had been up to no good. Sleep felt great. He had been in the middle of a marvelous dream when he had been rudely awoken. "Listen."
Teddy and Scorpius insisted on spending one last evening together as summer drew to a close. Harry and Draco kept to themselves downstairs while the boys made a ruckus upstairs. The men had polished off a couple bottles of wine between themselves. Draco shook the empty bottle and piqued a brow at Harry.
Hermione was one of the many who smiled in response. She knelt down next to Scorpius. "Harry's told us a lot about you, Scorpius," she said.
"His fever has been coming and going. Patricia is on holidays, so I stayed home with him. I'm giving him potions to get rid of the chills. But he can't swallow any food. He starts to cough. And he can hardly talk because he... he's... I don't-"
Scorpius couldn't believe his eyes as he pulled the knife out of the jar and saw chocolate coating the metal edge. This was his dream come true! He swiped the knife over a bit of his bread. It really was chocolate. He picked the bread up and bit into it. It seemed to melt in his mouth. He sighed, which caused Harry's smile to widen into a grin. He watched the boy quickly dunk the butter knife back into the jar and take another small portion. "Maybe you could ask your father to buy you some?"
"Of course, I did." Teddy snatched the wrapped gift out of Harry's hand while at the same time being dragged into the great room by Scorpius.
not-so-proper family." Teddy sprang up to his feet and pulled out a photo album from the bookshelf before sitting down. Scorpius leaned in to gape at the moving photographs. "These are the Weasleys."
Once back in Scorpius' bedroom, Draco sat down because he figured they had been tiptoeing around the topic for far too long. Scorpius would be starting Year Two at school tomorrow. Draco wanted him to have a fresh start. "Can you tell me what's bothering you?"
Harry stuffed his gloved hands into his pockets and scuffed the snow with his shoe. "There's not much to tell." He looked at Draco who was once again furiously shaking his head and mouthing 'no' at him. Scorpius watched his father, amused by his antics but not making a comment.
After the war, the wizarding population had been fragmented more than ever before. Dark Army sympathizers were run out of town. Most went into hiding. The few that couldn't escape in time perished in the hands of vigilante justice. It seemed Malfoy's time had run out. With no family or friends to turn to, he was well and truly alone in a world that no longer had a place for him.
She came to his rescue without batting an eye. "I'm all out." She snatched the remaining candy from Harry's basket. "There's more candy canes in the classroom. Grab them for me?" She jerked her thumb at the door behind them, giving him a 'smooth' exit strategy.
The Malfoys spent the next few minutes examining crafts and drawings. Scorpius stood between his mother and father, clutching their hands tight. He was just too embarrassed to do anything but mope. He had been so prepared for this day and he had wanted to impress them. Astoria had come all this way to see him in the pageant. She had never seen him sing like this before. He was supposed to impress her with how much he had learned. Instead, he had choked and looked like a big baby in front of everyone. He hated this. He didn't ever want to come back to school ever again.
be the same as Harry. He was a Malfoy, not some orphan being hidden out of sight. He should be making a fuss like a spoilt Malfoy would. He should be threatening to sue the school. He should be loudly blaming Harry for his bum ankle. He should be raising hell. Harry smirked at the thought of Scorpius raising his voice even the tiniest bit. Seemed impossible.
"Do you think so?" Harry looked back. The door slammed shut at the same time. "I think you're right." He looked down at Scorpius and said, "I'm used to it." He took Scorpius' hand and disapparated.
made a fool of himself. And, in other circumstances, he would be giving Potter grief over getting blasted on a couple glasses of wine. But these circumstances were different.
Scorpius placed his hand on his father's cheek and said, "Harry's so nice to me. He always smiles at me."
As much as it pained him to admit, she was right and he couldn't deny it. They had been happy together, just the two of them, for a time. The pregnancy had driven a wedge between them, and the crack couldn't be repaired. There was too much resentment there, too many hurtful words, ugly emotions buried under a carefully constructed layer of amicability they had built over the years since their separation.
He didn't want to wake up before Teddy. They had been telling silly stories all night long. Or rather, Teddy was telling silly stories about Hogwarts while Scorpius listened eagerly. They had fallen asleep that way. Scorpius had never slept in a tent before, so it was a lot of fun. It wasn't a
"Of course, of course," he said. "Administration is piling on a ton of new policies on us. That's been a bit frustrating."
"I know that," Scorpius grumbled. His father was always bursting his bubble. "Harry said he likes me better than you because I'm nicer than you."
"I... um... No, that's not... She doesn't bother me." Harry didn't know where Draco was going with this. "Wait, do
"He won't come over to our house anymore. I won't keep any secrets from you. Everything will go back to the way it was-"
Scorpius looked up upon hearing a change in his father's tone. "No, I do," he quickly said. "It's just that at Annie's birthday party I had a lot of fun. I was thinking..." He trailed off when he realized that Draco had yet to meet his eye, and he knew the answer. So he shook his head. "I bet no one's going to be around anyway because it's Easter break." Nothing more was said about that topic.
"Right? What are you going to do alone in this huge mansion when that happens?" Patricia waved goodbye and followed her ward out, resorting to jogging to catch up with him when he stamped his foot in annoyance at her tardiness.
Draco wrenched his arm out of Harry’s grip, anger bubbling up in him. Savior Potter looking to fix things, as always.
Draco tried the thick beefy stew with the slightly undercooked potato and onions. "It's good," he said. He had never imagined himself getting caught up in another serious relationship after going through his disastrous marriage. "I suppose I would tell him if I was certain."
On cue, Teddy and Scorpius marched into the kitchen, prompting Harry and Draco to step away from each other. Draco did see for a moment the disappointment that Harry hid behind an easy smile as he turned to the boys. Teddy said, "We're out of sprinkles."
"What do you mean what am I doing here?" Ginny held up the bane of Harry's existence at that moment – the dratted Witch Weekly. "What are
Once the mess was cleaned up, Harry was thoroughly exhausted. He excused himself so he could wash off the tomatoes from his hair. Draco, Teddy, and Scorpius were left alone then.
Teddy and Harry skidded behind the blocks of snow to hide from the deluge of snowballs following them. Their measly shelter had, when they initially built it, seemed strong and high enough. Now they realized their wall of snow was no match for the Malfoy onslaught. They cowered as snow began to pour over and through their blockade. There was no escape. By the time Draco and Scorpius got to them, Harry and Teddy were half buried in a snowbank. Scorpius cackled in glee, adding insult to injury by scooping more snow off the ground and dumping it on them. Draco had his head cocked to the side and asked, "Give up yet?"
"No, you are not. You are not useless." Harry tightened his arms around Draco. "You are worried. You have a lot on your plate." He had no idea Draco was feeling this way. He didn't know Draco
Astoria was infuriating. She was entitled, belittling, and smug, about many things, but especially about his life, and he was not going to engage today. He stormed out of there without another word.
Harry was quick to put him at ease. "Everyone gets sick at least once a year. It's a miracle that you haven't ever gotten sick before."
think that, because you're my family, they're your family too." Teddy said in all seriousness. "You'll make a lot of friends because there are a lot of kids your age. I'm the oldest. I'll be your big brother."
Scorpius lifted his head up a bit to reveal his pale eyes over his father's shoulder. He stared at Harry for a moment.
Draco got up, fixed his shirt, seemed to think about having the last word, then thought better of it before walking away without a second glance.
Now there they were, five years later, in the manor surrounded by books, toys, and drawings. They never reconciled their marital differences, but they did bond over their beautiful son. Scorpius stayed with Draco, Astoria was free to pursue her life. She would fly back a few times a year to spoil Scorpius rotten. Theirs wasn't a typical family life, but it worked. At least for now, it worked. Scorpius had fallen asleep in Astoria's arms, as he often did when they were together. He held very still when he slept. He was the sweetest boy any mother could ask for. She watched him sleep for a long while, cradled against her safe and sound. He tried so hard, bless his little heart. Astoria kissed his hair for the hundredth time that night. Then she looked up at Draco properly.
! "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!" they screamed. Scorpius gawked up at his mother. Astoria said, "Go on," and gave him a little nudge forward. Scorpius didn't have to be told twice. He made a mad dash towards the picnic table filled with pastries, presents, and party hats.
He let go of Harry. He didn't know what had come over him. He stuffed his tingling hand into his pocket as he turned away and let the crowd pull him out the front doors of Gringotts. He ducked his head against the wind, his ears tinged pink even though he had just stepped out into the snow. He shook the embarrassment away with some effort as he picked his way out of the lunch rush.
"Consequences matter. Time doesn't change the fact that I hurt a lot of people. They might forget what I look like or what I said and did, but that doesn't change the past."
Astoria, Draco, and Scorpius walked down small cobblestone streets, blending in with other families who were out at night to marvel at the Christmas light displays. There were traditional fairy lights wrapped around trees, blinking colorful globes floating atop houses, and more nontraditional apparitions of flying reindeer clopping over rooftops. Little blue, wispy elves milled around Scorpius singing cheery music, much to his delight. There were street vendors selling hot cider and mince pies. Draco realized that it had been a very long time since he had ventured out during the winter holidays. When he was young, his parents were too posh to take him to winter markets, at least not ones such as these, 'for the general public'. He had been to many parties, wearing stuffy robes and mingling with high-profile witches and wizards instead, feeling rather important indeed. When he went to Hogwarts, he had finally had a chance to experience some of Hogsmead's Christmas magic. But even then, he was too stuck up to enjoy it. Now, seeing the little winter marvels through Scorpius' eyes, he realized that perhaps he had been missing out.
He frantically searched his pockets for his wand to do just that. Or at least do the next best thing, which would be to disapparate and forget this ever happened.
He liked Hermione and Fleur the best so far. They sat opposite him and, if he shifted about while eating, he could watch them talking from around the bowl of potatoes. Hermione had bouncy Hugo on her lap and Fleur, who looked and spoke like an angel, held Rose. They weren't as loud as everyone else. They even smiled at him when they caught him staring. He would drop his eyes fast, but then couldn't stop himself from peeking a minute later. Hugo waved at him from time to time, obviously taken by this unusual boy with white hair and grey eyes. Scorpius certainly stood out in contrast to everyone else at the table, from his physical features to the clothes he wore and the way he ate.
"Shut up." Theo didn't even spare a look Draco's way. "While I was there, I did safari tours in Tanzania. We chanced upon a family of elephants by a watering hole. Gorgeous animals. There was a calf who was rolling around in the mud, having a time. Reminded me of you, Scorp. Chubby little thing, it was. Wouldn't go more than a few steps away from his mother, but you could just tell he had an adventuring spirit about him, the way he was looking at us. Probably wondering who the devil we were."
children's books rather than their own. Then there was the handful that thought that wandering towards the toy box was acceptable.
The relief she felt when she saw his face that night was enormous, a feeling she never shared with anyone. She clutched his hand tight and let him brush her sweaty strands of hair away from her face. She was so glad for him at that moment.
Theo simply watched with narrowed eyes as his friend coughed and spluttered, making quite a spectacle for the other patrons in the crowded coffee shop to snicker at. He slid a napkin across the table. Draco snatched it up and proceeded to dab at watering eyes and nose. Theo had to wait a few moments for Draco to stop embarrassing them both. Once Draco had composed himself, Theo asked again. "Christmas? With Harry Potter?"
He had to look his best for his mother. He had already laid out all his schoolwork on the dining table in the right order. His father didn't help one bit. Scorpius knew that Draco didn't like all the fuss. But his mother was coming to visit, so he wanted to fuss as much as he could. He made sure his room was tidy and that his playthings were put away in the right shelves. He had his books ready to show Astoria how well he could read now. He even cleaned the living room, fluffing up pillows and making sure everything was straight.
"I know. Words aren't as easy to clean up as ink, is it? That's why we have to be very careful with the words we choose." Patricia always knew. Scorpius was very glad for her. "Let's start by being extra nice to Harry at school."
Nearly every family member figured it was their moral duty to lecture Harry on the various devious reasons the Malfoys had befriended him. All of them seemed valid. In fact, they
"Never counted." Draco opened a door at the end of the corridor and peered into the dark abyss below. "Got your wand on you?"
At two, parents started to wander into the classroom while the children attempted to be on their best behavior. Harry and Gabrielle ushered the adults to their seats in the middle of the room. The children were sitting on the floor at the front in three neat rows as instructed by their teachers. Many of them were waving wildly at their family. For most of the kids, this was their first performance.
"How is it?" Harry asked him once they had gotten through a few bites. Scorpius nodded eagerly and hummed. He didn't want to talk with his mouth full, even though a lot of the Weasleys tended to do that from what he could see.
"I think you might want to try a little harder," Patricia suggested lightly. "Clear the air. It was nice having Harry around. Scorpius thought it was nice too."
Harry helped the last boy put on his backpack before standing upright and stretching his aching back. It was Friday evening and he couldn't wait for a restful weekend.
Just as lightning flashed ominously, a figure staggered in, drenched. It bumped into the coat stand and, in an attempt to right itself, proceeded to fall instead, taking the coat stand with it. It fell to its knees before collapsing completely onto the floor. Motionless.
Harry patted Scorpius' back. "I didn't think you were bad. Your parents didn't think you were bad, either."
"Anyway," Harry decided not to press any further, "I'll be off." He made his way out the drawing room. "I'll pick Teddy up after breakfast. Maybe around ten." Draco followed him out to the foyer. Harry was pulling his damp winter coat off of the stand. "Oh, and the Weasleys are having a dinner in the new year, asked if Scorpius wanted to tag along." Draco handed Harry his scarf and nodded. Harry took the scarf and, while winding it around his neck, said, "Friends of convenience, right?" Draco supposed so, so he nodded again. Harry opened the front door and the sound of howling, biting wind slipped into the manor.
"I have to go to the bathroom," he said haltingly. He really was going to cry now. He slipped away despite mild protests from Draco and Astoria, and ran out of the classroom.
"I just want to meet him," Theo frowned. "What's wrong with that? Haven't seen him in, what, ten years?"
First thing he did was throw himself at Harry, because he knew no one else could have planned this. "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" And then he threw his arms around Teddy, because he knew no one else could have made the decorations so outrageous. "This is awesome!" He couldn't stop giggling. This was everything he wanted. Best surprise birthday ever!
He would pick at his lunch while at work, lost in thought, ignoring his coworkers' chatter around him. He couldn't think of 'more'. What they were doing was absurd to begin with. It was selfish and borderline irresponsible to be sneaking around like this. As far as he was concerned, there was no more. There would only be the occasional thrill of getting caught and stolen nights. Before they knew it, June would arrive.
He saw a group of children sitting huddled in one corner of the room, exchanging stories and giggles. Listening in on them, he realized that they were talking about him.
Harry interrupted Draco by pulling him along as he apparated to Malfoy Manor. "I know." They had landed neatly outside the front door. Harry placed his hands on Draco's shoulders. "I'm Harry Potter. I'm kind of a big deal."
"Yes. He's doing some schoolwork." Patricia flicked her wand at the dishes in the sink so they were soaked and soapy, ready for rinsing in a few minutes. "I haven't made dinner in a while for you two. Harry's been around so often. He likes to cook, hmm?"
"Oh, 'that's all'. Right," Theo parroted. "Sure, that's all, Draco. He's just teaching your son. No big deal. It's just Harry Potter. Wiping up Scorp's snot." He cackled at the image. "Have you talked to him yet? Been a bit civilized?"
He was scanning through the bookshelves of the Malfoy library when he felt a soft graze at his side that made him jump a foot in the air and sent books tumbling down.
Teddy scoffed. "He's got a mansion. Marble statues and crystal chandeliers in practically every room. You should see the size of his estate. There's even a forest with peacocks." Teddy was on a roll now. If there was one thing Teddy loved to do, it was to talk. "I've gotten lost a few times in the manor. No ghouls or ghosts though. He does have a bunch of antiques. His family's ancient, you know? One of the oldest families in history. Everything in that manor is worth a pretty penny and hundreds of years old."
looking for a bird. For all he knew, she was taking a long, leisurely look at the leaves in the wind. Either way, he didn't have anything more to say, so he was silent. They stood in that silence for a few minutes. They were in the middle of a bird sanctuary and it was the crack of dawn. Luna was in the final stages of publishing her book, and the only way to catch up with her was to meet her in the bog, river, or forest where she was doing last-minute research. Harry would meet her anywhere if she could grant him this favour.
"Okay. Got it." Harry gulped down the pain potion in one go, gagging as the bitter molasses-like medicine coated his throat. He handed the flask back to the nurse. "How much longer do I have to stay?"
He turned his head to the side, breaking away from the kiss in an attempt to clear his head. Had his fever returned? Most likely. Where was he? At home. He was in the library. What just happened? Harry had woken him up. What was happening now? He glanced up when he heard soft rustling. Harry was still there, perched on the edge of his writing desk, looking down at him. Faded moonlight streamed through the window, casting faint and obscuring shadows around them. This must be a dream.
"Impressive." Draco wasn't being facetious either. He had been trying to show Scorpius how to tie his shoes for ages. "Did Patricia teach you?"
Teddy bit back the rest of the speech he had prepared. Instead, looking at the miserable look on Harry, he went in for a hug. He let Harry squeeze him tight. "Don't be sad, okay?" He rubbed Harry's back. "This is such a silly thing to be sad about."
Draco glared at Theo defiantly. "Scorpius wanted to exchange presents with Ted, so yes, I had Teddy over. Potter happened to be with him."
"Not often." Draco was vague on purpose. "There is no point in fighting it. Bygones and all. It's just wasted breath on them."
Then, finally, Teddy clapped his hands together once, breaking the staring contest. "Well, I think it's rubbish, what they say about you." He sank back deep into the musty, old couch. "Scorpius is a great kid. So you can't be all that bad. And you're pretty good at healing too. Usually Harry has to check with Aunty Hermione to make sure he's done it right, you know? You'd think, after all this time, he would know how to mend himself. Merlin knows he hurts himself often enough. Last time he was trying to make bread and the dough practically took over the entire kitchen. Got our socks stuck in it. It was like a bog creature. Smelt like one too." Teddy itched his nose. "Anyway, do you guys want to see something?"
Draco decided brutal honesty wasn't the way to go in this case. "Everyone's a bit excited right now. That's alright. Excitement gets forgotten soon enough. If anyone says anything to upset you at school, you have to tell me right away."
Harry groaned with embarrassment and slapped a hand to his face. "I'm never to live that down, am I?"
"I'm painting!" Scorpius perked up excitedly. "I forgot to tell you! My class is doing a play and I'm making the trees and the castle. I have so many gold stars now."
"Fine by us," Theo decided. "We will see you in an hour." Pleased with himself, he turned to the Malfoys. "Shall we be off?" Then he tsked at Scorpius. "Why aren't you zipped up?" He knelt down to zip up Scorpius' coat and force mittens and a cap on him, despite the boy's loud protests.
He squinted at the sound and muttered, "Not very good." At the open doorway stood Draco with a mug of steaming coffee in hand. Harry dropped his head in his hands. "Ugh." He took a few cleansing gulps before grabbing his spectacles from the bedside table. "What time is it?"
"Maybe you and I can practice together next time. That's what we'll do," Harry suggested. "Just like how I help some of your friends with their shapes and colours, I'll help you with your singing. I know Michael and Lisa were
"He's looked past Malfoy's history, hasn't he?" Victoire reasoned. "And if he thinks Draco Malfoy has turned over a new page, reformed, become a productive member of society, I'm sure he has valid reasons."
Draco knew that Scorpius hadn't minded in the past. But, ever since he started school, he seemed to mind a bit more than before. Seeing his friends with their mothers must be hard on him. Scorpius never complained though. "Didn't you have a hard time?" Draco asked instead of answering Harry's question.
Harry fiddled with the strap of his messenger bag. "Sorry, I was hoping to meet with you at school, but you never-"
"Ah." Draco nodded once. He placed the golden object back on the shelf. "She's playing well this year."
"How fat was this kid?" Ron muttered under his breath as he took a closer look at his friend's injuries. "Let's see."
Scorpius gulped hard when hi classmates started standing up. He struggled to his feet and pressed his hands to his sides. His eyes flicked from Gabrielle to his parents frantically. This was such a bad idea.
. I HATE HIM AND HE'S NOT ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE. I'M GOING HOME!" Scorpius ran out of there, much to Draco's shock.
When Draco rushed after him, he saw Scorpius practically fly down the stairs, right past Harry who had been cleaning up the mess in the foyer, and straight out the front door. Draco knew Harry had heard. The entire house had shook with Scorpius' words. Draco stumbled to a halt beside Harry. "He didn't mean that."
The older students blinked at the strange seven-year-old boy who had suddenly butted into their conversation.
"I don't know," Harry murmured. "I wasn't thinking. I guess I haven't been thinking for a while now."
Scorpius took a deep breath and tried again. "I don't want Harry to come over to our house anymore."
Whoever had captured the blurry picture on the cover of Witch Weekly had managed to get it just right. Teddy's shirt was all askew and muddy, and his shoelaces were undone and trailing in the grass. Scorpius was flushed from the heat, but he still looked pretty as a doll, munching on popcorn. Draco was in the middle of saying something to Teddy as he tossed an apple with a lazy flick of his wrist. Harry was in his own world, his head tilted up towards the sun, eyes shut.
"Do you know what he told me when I asked him if he could take care of you?" Draco continued. "He said, 'Of course. He's family, isn't he?' If you are ever in a bind, he would help you out, no matter what. Even after all that's happened, he would help. Family is
He was startled when he felt hands on either side of him. It was time for the children to hold hands. It was part of the song and they had practiced this so often. But Scorpius couldn't get his hands to move. Annie and Tim had to wrestle his fists away from his sides. He held onto their hands tight once they had managed to grab on. Annie squeezed his clammy hand many times to reassure him. It helped. His voice picked up a bit. He focused on Harry again who was nodding in time with the song with a proud grin on his face. Although his teacher wasn't looking at him, he still felt some of that excitement seeping in.
"Harry taught me," Scorpius said. "We just finished our flying lesson." He then proceeded to show his father how he could do up the other shoe as well. "It's actually really easy. Easier than when Nanna does it."
Scorpius blushed. He had never thought that he could have a big brother. He cast a sideways glance at Teddy.
" Scorpius and Louis skipped around the kitchen, cookie in hand. They bumped into Harry by the fireplace, stuffed the cookie in their mouth, and held their palms out for another.
"Everyone in your class will," Harry assured Scorpius. "Imagine how funny your class pictures are going to turn out by the end of the year with all of your missing teeth."
The Aurors glanced at each other with a loaded look, as though they had been expecting such an upheaval. Draco felt panic rise up in him in an enormous wave. They had 'evidence' against him. Now they would want to look at his memories and feed him that blasted truth serum and-
"Got that out of your system?" Draco asked, and he kept his resolute gaze on the two boys kicking muddy snow at each other.
The moment Draco opened the door to 12 Grimmauld Place, he heard music. It was muffled, it was loud, and it was rock. He followed the sounds to the stairs leading down to the kitchen.
Harry nearly laughed at the question but he caught himself in time, disguising his chuckle by clearing his throat instead. "Well, I'm not supposed to have favourites, Scorpius," he said dutifully.
Draco stared at Harry and Scorpius in shock, his hand still gripping the doorknob tight. All Patricia had told him was that they were at St. Mungo's. That was enough to send him panicking. Now here he was looking at Harry kneeling beside Scorpius, as though nothing was the matter.
Draco seemed quite displeased at having had to wait outside for the past three minutes in sleeting rain and melting slush. He didn't have time to wait for Harry to return to his senses as well. He pushed his way through into the house and shut the door behind him. "We need to talk."
The front page of The Quibbler showed a photo of Ginny Weasley on the red carpet, holding an award in one hand, and draping her other arm around Harry Potter as they smiled cheerfully. Dressed to the nines in evening wear, they posed with practiced ease as flashes went off in rapid succession from various photographers behind the velvet rope. When Ginny whispered something into Harry's ear, he laughed. And the moving picture restarted, Ginny once again draping an arm around Harry as they smiled.
Draco didn't know who he resented more at that moment, Harry or Scorpius. "Damn it." He ran after his headstrong son.
"It's been passed down." Draco gestured at the bookshelves that spanned the entire perimeter of the room from floor to high ceiling. "Enough books to last a few lifetimes in here. A lot of history."
Scorpius clicked his tongue. "I know I'm supposed to eat vegetables to grow big and strong. It's not because I'll turn into a goblin. That's just a fairy tale. Right?"
An hour, bowls of peppery soup, and two potions later, Scorpius was sleeping with his head on Draco's lap in the drawing room while Harry cleared up the messy coffee table. "Are you feeling better?" he asked Draco.
"Teddy's different." Harry couldn't think of a single person more unlike Scorpius than Teddy. "He likes the attention. He's not bothered by how absurd my life is. He's grown up with me. Scorpius isn't like that. He's shy, quiet. He's sheltered. Draco has-" He broke off.
It wasn't long before Harry started to feel sorry for the kid. He examined the picture. It wasn't that bad. Scorpius had drawn a large, irregular sunflower surrounded by jagged clouds. He hadn't even started coloring it in yet. It seemed just penciling an outline had reduced him to tears.
Scorpius grabbed the pencil and set about drawing a painstaking star without another word. He drew one small triangle and then an upside-down triangle on top of it, trying to get all the corners pointing the right way. Then he showed it to Harry.
Draco took Harry's wrist in his hand and began fastening a black cufflink to his sleeve. "Don't lose these."
"No denying it." Harry stretched his aching back. He was sore from head to toe from all that running and chasing. "Hermione was amazed. I think she was expecting the worst."
Upstairs in the playroom, Scorpius had hastily shoved Teddy inside and shut the door to ensure they were alone. "Teddy, we've behaved so poorly," he bemoaned, repeating his nanny's words. He wrung his hands in front of him. "I think they're happier together. Or maybe they're sadder not together. Don't you think?" He looked up with wide, expectant eyes at Teddy.
Scorpius had crawled into Draco's bed early Sunday morning, knowing Draco wouldn't wake up properly for another hour. He didn't feel like playing or reading, so he lay down and stared up at the white canopy with his hands on his belly and his feet planted on the mattress. It didn't take long for Draco to turn over and drop an arm on Scorpius' chest. Scorpius wiggled to get his own arms out from under it. Then he pushed up the sleeve on Draco's shirt, exposing the Dark Mark. He traced it once, refusing to stop even after Draco twitched sleepily. "I know what this is," he announced.
"Argh!" Draco pulled at his hair as he turned back around and kept stomping to the living room where he flopped onto the couch. Theo was now snickering as he sauntered in. He hadn't seen Draco this flustered in a long, long while. Draco was trying to hold in in his sharp words because his son was present, but Potter was just so
Draco looked down at his hand for a moment. It felt warm, despite the snowy wind blowing over him. Convenient? He clenched his hand into a fist before throwing the door closed. What the hell?
He gritted his teeth. At times like this, he was just fed up with his life. "I don't know," he snapped. "Every time a damned leaf falls, they haul me in. Justice knows no bounds."
"I've got to get back." Hermione glared at her husband. Then she turned to Harry. "I'll see you later, okay? Tomorrow for lunch? You'll need your rest tonight. And please do as the Mediwizard tells you."
"Me?!" Harry pretended to be offended, even though he had heard her comment on him being a 'lost cause' for many years now.
"Why?" Harry glared at the offensive magazine sitting on the coffee table between them. "It's another intrusion into my life. I went to a carnival with Teddy, and I brought Scorpius with me. That's all this is."
. Like Scorpius needs special treatment because his mother doesn't live with him. I'm so sick of his elitist bullsh-" He caught himself just in time. But Scorpius knew exactly what Draco had meant to say and he gasped very theatrically.
"Look at you," Harry cheered, standing beside the floating boy and his small broomstick. "Not so bad, right?"
"Yes," she said just to spite him. Then it was her turn to ignore him. She turned her attention to Scorpius. "I wish you would write to me more often." She kissed his cheek, leaving a hint of her cherry red lipstick on him. "I really do enjoy reading your letters."
Theo sat down with him, barely able to speak because he was laughing so hard. "What did he say, exactly?" he asked Draco.
convince Harry. But he didn't really care. The Malfoys wanted him on their side for the sake of Scorpius. Many people had benefited from him, why was this scenario any different? He knew that no amount of reasoning would help him get out of this mess, though, so he just listened, nodding and mumbling at the desired pauses while letting his mind wander. He had been expecting this. In fact, he was somewhat surprised that it had taken this long for the Weasleys to intervene in what they saw as a trap. He had been teaching Scorpius for nine months, been civil with Draco for half of that time.
He directed his worried expression at Harry who was kneeling in front of his students. "Everybody ready?"
"That's right," Theo agreed wholeheartedly. "But the thing with Harry and Draco is that they never seem to grow up when they see each other. They act like they're back in Hogwarts."
Harry grimaced as he took his third potion from the nurse. He tried his puppy dog eyes with her to no avail. She merely shook her head in disapproval. "It's quite disgusting, you know?" he insisted.
Scorpius fiddled with the bag in his hands. "Mum and I might go visit the ice castles one day. And... and maybe if it snows, we'll play outside with Dad?"
Scorpius turned bright red. What on Earth was Harry talking about? "I-I don't know. I have to ask my father," he stammered out.
Scorpius sidled up to Draco and glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. "I thought he broke his neck too," he whispered. "But he didn't."
"DON'T YOU DARE, DRACO!" Astoria drowned Draco's excuses with one breath. "Don't you dare try to shove blame off of yourself! You do this all the time! You have always done this. You think you can wipe your hands off of matters concerning your life because life happens
Harry held up his thumb, showing the blue icing that he had brushed off of Draco's ear. "Did you help too?" he asked with a smile.
Harry understood what the worst part was. The worst part was that Draco had no one to blame but himself. Worst part was that Scorpius could be associated with those crimes, just as Draco has been associated with Lucius'. There was no running away from that and no one else to blame for it.
"-surely you'll find someone you want to spend time with, maybe when Scorp goes off of Hogwarts. You wouldn't tell him even then?" Harry wondered. He scooped a bit of stew with the spoon and offered a taste to Draco. "What do you think?"
"At least have the decency to deny it," Astoria snarled. With the setting sun behind her, she looked a vision - fiery red halo silhouetting her golden hair and taut posture. She seemed ready to strike, like a coiled snake.
walked fast. He was always in a hurry. If Scorpius didn't hurry, then he would be left behind. He couldn't wait to be taller so he wouldn't have to keep hurrying like this. He nearly tripped over a sidewalk crack but quickly caught himself with a small stumble. Oh yes, hurrying wasn't fun at all.
"I'm sure it does." Draco finally bumped against a lantern on the table and started struggling to light it.
Harry glanced at Draco for a moment before saying, "He's doing very well. He's a pleasure to have around." He smiled when Scorpius looked at him shyly. "You are," he assured Scorpius.
"Harry's on here loads of times," Teddy explained. "In fact, I've been on here a few times myself. Witch Weekly loves Harry. Witches love Harry. You're famous now, Scorpius! Isn't that great?"
Harry opened his mouth to retort. But he didn't. Because he realized that Draco hadn't said anything offensive.
"I'm trying out for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team," Teddy announced to the table. "I want to either be a Chaser or a Seeker."
"I already know Scorpius," Harry said with a grin. "You don't have to fret about introducing me to him."
Meanwhile, Harry was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Theo Nott had just flagged him down. If he went, he would have to socialize with him, which wouldn't be a big deal if Malfoy wasn't with him. If he didn't go, he would look like a complete prat. After weighing his options for a bit and then seeing Scorpius wave at him as well, he dragged himself away from the doors and trudged over to them.
By six, Malfoy Manor was bustling with conversation, laughter, and clinks of cutlery. Theo was a conversationalist who quite enjoyed talking about his favourite topic of interest - himself.
He almost never had sandwiches. Draco didn't think it was real food. He had pasta or casseroles or chicken or fish instead. Patricia was quite good at those. Scorpius liked the idea of sandwiches. Whenever he saw his classmates eating them, he would get a little jealous. It looked yummy with red jam in the middle. He always brought stir-fry to school. While he got many compliments on how good his lunch smelled, he would glance longingly at the sandwiches in his friends' lunchboxes. Maybe Harry had jam in his house. He hoped so.
He let out a quiet sigh before rolling over onto his side. The setting sun cast a red hue in his bedroom. He studied Draco's sleeping face, disheveled fair hair fanning the pillow, lips parted to make way for quiet breaths, an arm thrown over his eyes, revealing the faint Dark Mark. Harry lifted his hand from under the sheets and brought it up, stopping just short of Draco's cheek. He let his hand land on Draco's shoulder instead and shook him awake.
"Of course." She gave him a fleeting kiss, then stepped back with a wink. "What are you fantasizing about these days, darling?" she wondered.
Theo picked him up with a happy laugh. He was always glad that Scorpius wasn't one of those kids who whined and sniveled all over their parents. This little boy was someone Theo had no trouble spending a day with.
"Sweetheart," Astoria cooed, kneeling down beside Scorpius' chair before he could get up anxiously. "Oh, sweetheart." She hugged him tight. "You are the most wonderful boy."
"No." Then, without another word and in the blink of an eye, Harry had grasped Draco's wrist and pulled his arm forward.
Harry cursed his Firebolt for failing him miserably against Draco's Yajirushi. All he could do was watch as Draco zoomed past him towards the flitting Snitch. Draco was just barely an inch away from the golden ball when it blinked out of view. "Damn," he swore as his fist closed around thin air. So close.
glare. But eventually everyone grew used to that. He had attempted to be as unapproachable as possible but, being a rather charismatic boy, his ploys of keeping to himself after class and fixating on his schoolwork wasn't cutting it. As Halloween came upon Hogwarts fast, he grew resigned to the fact that everyone had something to say to him but no one wanted to be the first to poke the bear.
"I wasn't serious," Ron blurted out. He held his hands up in surrender. "Do you really think I'd be coherent if he broke his neck?"
"Ah." She nodded a few times with a smirk. "A peace offering. He's too sweet for words." She popped the top off the container to get a better look at the jam sandwich. "Are you going to eat it?"
That night he wrote a crooked letter to Teddy. He refused to let his nosy father take a peek. He hunched over the table, using his arms to hide his words. He knew Teddy would give him a straight answer. He also trusted Teddy to keep the letter to himself.
That night, he tossed and turned in bed, growing more and more furious as the hours ticked by. He had always thought Potter was strange, but he had been stranger than usual, more confrontational than usual, and more callous than usual these past few weeks. About absolutely nothing at all. Draco couldn't even figure out why they were arguing this time around. The fact that he refused to admit he had a good day? Maybe that he didn't like Christmas? Or that he wasn't acting like all of Potter's friends, doting and fawning? What was it? Friends of convenience, that's what Potter had called them. Yes, that was exactly what they were. If circumstances had been different, they wouldn't be friends at all. Was that irksome? Draco didn't care. Potter seemed to care about making friends though. The right kind of friends. Draco angrily flipped the pillow over so he could rest his hot head on the cool side. Why in the world was he losing sleep over this? He firmly shut his eyes.
Harry tried to look more presentable for Scorpius but his temper didn't allow him to look any less angry. Luckily, Draco was right behind. "Go to your room, Scorpius. Now," he said. Scorpius seemed to have half a mind to argue, then thought better of it. He shrunk away but didn't go any further than out of the hallway and into the living room where he stood by the pillar and strained to hear.
"Okay," Scorpius said. He gestured at the wall of drawings where some of the parents and children were already gathered.
It seemed like a very big deal by the way everyone was now gawking at Teddy in awe. Here was a real live person who had seen a Dark Mark with his own two eyes. "Have you been to his house? I heard it's creepy in there, filled with ghouls and all."
The faint red Dark Mark etched into pale skin was on display, plain as day. It was usually hidden by sleeves, but Draco had pushed his sleeves up when giving Scorpius a bath. The tattoo had faded slightly over the years, but it was still unmistakable. A constant reminder. Draco felt an ugly twist inside, but he was frozen on the spot, unable to wrench his arm away as memories flooded him from years ago. The shame and pain that accompanied this scar, emotions he had worked at burying deep down, were ensnared in those memories. It was stifling.
Astoria, still seated on the rug, looked at Draco with forced patience. "I didn't realize you two were getting on again."
"No, of course not," Harry said earnestly. He would never do anything to hurt Scorpius or Teddy. "We're adults. We can keep it together for the kids, regardless of the situation."
Harry was too confused to argue otherwise. "I know. I'm stupid." He knelt down on one knee. "Scorpius?"
"I'm not excited," Scorpius lied. He grabbed his books that his teacher held out for him and then hurried to his seat so he could get excited in private.
He hadn't wanted for a long time. He hadn't wanted in so long that he thought he didn't want anything at all. He hadn't wanted in so long that he had forgotten what it was like.
"Oh yes," Luna picked the lizard up and placed it on a nearby plant. "This has been an awfully productive summer for me. I've almost completed the book, you know?"
After the winter pageant at school, Scorpius was handed a bouquet of flowers by his mother, as well as two hearty kisses on his cheeks for his wonderful performance as a reindeer in the play his class had put on for the parents. His button nose was painted black and he wore felt antlers on his head. Absolutely ridiculous, if anybody had bothered asking his opinion. The adulation was nice though. He smiled bright at Astoria and graciously smelt the flowers. These bouquets were getting more and more outrageous. At this rate, by the time he had completed school, he would hardly be able to hold the mountain of flowers his mother would shower on him. Astoria was singing praises about him remembering all his lines and what a perfect little reindeer he was. Draco patted Scorpius' back because he couldn't get a word in edgewise. The three of them were walking through the cheery corridors of the school when they bumped into Harry.
no one liked his father. That was the reason for his irritability when he saw Draco being treated poorly. There weren't many people who could recognize the Malfoys anymore. It had been so long since the war, after all. Draco's deep-seated insecurities were the cause for most of their hiding and intense privacy. However, his insecurities stemmed from a few incidents that occurred during the first five years after the war had ended.
Astoria held up her hands in surrender. "I know, I know." She then folded her hands on her lap. "Maybe I should be more direct." For a brief moment, something akin to vulnerability flashed over her face. "I want to spend Christmas with my son."
she was seeing, but she did see. She saw exactly what the heading had read – a picture-perfect day. Actually there was nothing incriminating in the photographs or in the article surrounding it. It had just been a shock to see Harry photographed with Draco Malfoy. She looked at Harry, who was watching her every expression with carefully guarded eyes. She looked at Draco as well. She hadn't seen him since after the war.
When Draco brought up the uncomfortable conversation with Harry, he wasn't expecting a laugh and a ready solution.
"Dad doesn't like Harry." Scorpius then leaned in to whisper, "And Harry doesn't like Dad either. Why?"
"I know it's not poison," Scorpius said under his breath as he took a piece of rough candy out of the bag. It was colored pale blue and felt warm to the touch. He popped it in his mouth and let his tongue get accustomed to the taste.
Harry took in the beautiful words and colour. He imagined Draco and Scorpius sitting in the playroom, hunched over the small desk, bickering about how best to tug at Harry's heartstrings, thinking up the perfect words, painstakingly colouring within the lines, and now impatiently waiting for an answer.
"You've snapped back to your senses?" Ginny reached out and hooked a finger under Harry's chin to make him face her. "You wish you hadn't? And nothing like this will happen again? Is that the plan?"
Patricia smiled while slipping into her sandals and said, "I suppose we should enjoy him while he's like this. They do grow up before you know it."
"Yes, that's my teacher's name." Scorpius nodded. Then he turned and pointed at Harry who was standing by the door, regulating traffic. "There he is. That's my teacher."
Finally George whipped around to face Ron, who was hiding in the back of the pack. "You said he broke his neck!"
"Whoever told you that is lying," Harry said. "Crying is just as natural as laughing. When you're happy, you laugh. When you're sad, you cry. No one's said you can't laugh, have they?"
Scorpius sifted around the mass of pencil crayons lying beside him to find the perfect shade of orange. "Do you want to colour with me?" he offered.
So, one Wednesday evening, when Draco showed up in the kitchen while Harry was in the middle of his cooking, he was only mildly surprised. "I didn't know you were coming over today."
what you're going through. I know it's scary. It's not fun at all to feel this nervous. But you're not alone. All your friends are singing with you and Gabrielle will be with me right there in front of you. Like we practiced, okay?"
A few moments later, when Harry arrived upstairs with a couple mugs of hot tea, he found Draco warming up by the fire. Despite using charms to ward off the snow, he had still managed to get splashes of water on him. He ruffled the rain out of his hair and was rolling up his damp sleeves when Harry handed him the tea. "I don't have coffee in the house." The freezing rain had started an hour ago and showed no signs of letting up, with wind gusting raindrops straight into the windowpane, a steady drumming.
Scorpius brought his teddy up to his face and hid behind it as he shook his head. He knew he would start crying again if he talked about it. He shouldn't have tried to climb up all the way to the top. He should have known that he would tumble off the play set. He was so embarrassed. Everyone had seen him fall and surely everyone was laughing at him for crying. He didn't want to cry anymore. But thinking about crying made him want to cry some more.
Theo stood up and gave Scorpius a final pat on the head. "Ready." He turned to Harry and Draco who appeared nonchalant and like nothing was the matter at all. Theo knew then that dinner would be a good time. "Let's go." He pulled Draco along, Scorpius leading the pack on their way out the schoolyard.
... and licked the sweet syrup off the spoon as he was brought back to the present. He tried to listen to the last of Hermione's rant.
Ginny dragged Harry to a cramped bedroom currently filled with luggage from visiting family members. "I have something for you." She finally let go of him once she had shut the door. "But you cannot tell my brothers. Promise me."
Draco didn't even glance at Harry as his attention honed in on Scorpius sleeping in Harry's arms. He reached out instinctively.
First there were the few who thought drawing hour was for throwing small pieces of rolled up scrap paper at each other. Then there were the few who liked to draw on
Harry dried his hands on his jeans and sat down on the bench. "Speaking of Scorpius," he said, giving Draco a pointed look.
Harry was trying to stop his big mouth from running off on him, but he failed. "You don't have anywhere else to go." He winced as soon as he said that.
Typically Ron would have said yes. Anything to steer clear of a touchy topic. However, that afternoon, he figured it was time to talk. He got up to his feet, hot cider in hand, and said, "Come on." He beckoned Harry to follow him out the busy kitchen. Harry reluctantly agreed. They walked upstairs, away from the hubbub, and into the much quieter foyer. Ron gestured at Harry to take a seat on the stairs while he remained standing, leaning against the balustrade. "You've been spending a lot of time with Scorpius, so it must be hard for him to not see you these days."
Harry was still marveling the festive decorations that adorned Malfoy Manor. Garlands twisted around the balustrade of the grand staircase, two ornamental trees stood on either side of the foyer, adorned in sparkling gold and silver ornaments, twinkling lights floated around the chandelier, homemade wall-hangings of little green elves and fairies hung in strands across doorways, and everything smelt of cinnamon. "It's all a little extravagant, don't you think?" he commented while taking off his coat.
Scorpius pretended not to hear him. He brought the letter up to his eyes. "Her name is Ginny Weasley." He smiled triumphantly at his father. "
Scorpius was quick to come to Harry's defense. "Harry helped me so much," he told Astoria. "We practiced, me and him and Michael and Lisa. Could you tell?"
Scorpius gave Harry a big nod. "I think it would be wonderful." If it was anything like the stories he read, a night at a magical ball would be a fascinating night.
"Right." Harry supposed that since neither party had bothered to contact each other, it wasn't much of a surprise that Teddy's existence hadn't come up in any conversations at the Malfoy Manor. "He is a bit upset with you because of that."
Draco gritted his teeth, sharp words at the tip of his tongue. The kettle clattered onto the countertop with a clang. Potter had been really grating his nerves all day and this was the final straw. "Just say what's on your mind," he snarled.
Sometimes he would lay awake, wondering what he was doing with his life. If Harry from ten years ago could see this now... After the war, everyone had expected him to join the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He had decided against it. Everyone had expected him to settle down with Ginny. He didn't for reasons not entirely satisfactory. He was living a life of boring rebellion. Harry from ten years ago would be trying to shake some sense into him, telling him to get on with it, make something of himself, live the life he had dreamt of as a child hiding under the stairs. And certainly not screw around with Malfoy, of all people. Draco Malfoy was never part of the plan. April would pass by in the blink of an eye - an hour after work, maybe a Saturday together. Harry would find himself in bed once again, thinking they couldn't possibly keep this up for much longer, this preposterous clandestine affair.
"Then, then," Scorpius excitedly said, "I got first place in the spelling bee! I got a first place ribbon. And guess what? Harry said he's got a surprise for me for doing so well. He says he'll bring it over tomorrow."
"I want to go! I want to see elephants!" Scorpius gave Draco an angelic and pleading look. "Can we go, Dad? Please?"
At lunch, Scorpius wanted to know all about Harry becoming the youngest Seeker at Hogwarts, flying around on a cursed broomstick, chased by Dementors. He was enthralled with the stories of elusive Snitches and rogue Bludgers. He couldn't believe how such a dangerous sport could be played in school, of all places, but he couldn't wait to try it out. "Harry," he said, "are you famous?"
The room grew heavy with the sound of rainfall, shaky breaths, a creaking bed, and rustling sheets. Fingers entangled and strained against each other between them. The heat was almost unbearable. Harry had his head thrown to the side, eyes screwed shut, and moved in synchrony to Draco, who had his forehead pressed to Harry's shoulder as he edged closer and closer-
Harry finally resorted to pulling Scorpius up onto his lap. "He'll be here in a bit, buddy. Why don't you go back to sleep?" He settled into the sofa while wrapping the blanket tight around the boy.
Draco couldn't get that drunken proclamation out of his head. It was irritating, Potter living in his fantasy where everything was perfect, the past was the past, nothing bleeding into the present or the future. Good people? Him? In what sane world?
"That's because I don't need one." Harry reached up and shook the branch above them, dumping fresh snow all over Draco. He laughed along with Teddy when Draco yelped as snow got under his collar and ran down his back.
In the meantime, Draco had finally caught up to the excitement at his front door, and he appeared just as shocked as his son.
Patricia looked back again, this time to make sure it was just the two of them in the room. Then she turned around to face Scorpius as she sat down on the edge of his bed. She beckoned him forward. Once they were huddled close, she whispered, "I'll tell you a secret."
The corners of Draco's mouth twitched for just a moment, right as he got up and began clearing the table. "Why do you think you did anything?" He started floating the dishes to the sink.
"Good. Because I didn't and wouldn't," Harry said. He was lounging on the couch, drinking a cold Butterbeer. "It's a present from Ginny."
After he had explored for a good while, he went down to Harry and they raided Teddy's library. They took lots of picture books with them. Scorpius sat on the couch with the books beside him and one open on his lap. Harry was sitting beside him against the arm of the couch with his legs crossed, reading his own grown-up book. Scorpius thought Harry looked very funny when he was reading. The man sat hunched over with a hand pushed into his cheek and the other holding the pages down. His hair fell over his eyes and he would brush it away every few minutes. When his back ached, he would sit up and arch it with a quiet groan before going back to hunching over.
The thirteen year old knew that he had every right to be behaving like an insolent child, so he didn't feel bad at all for sulking. He was sitting by the window, angrily stabbing the wooden frame with the tip of his wand. Harry had been trying to speak with him every day since 'the incident'. The way he saw it, Harry had kept a secret from him for almost a whole year. That meant he was allowed to not talk to Harry for almost a whole year too. He could do that. He wasn't feeling lonely at all. In fact, he was doing just fine without Harry around.
Draco snapped the lid onto the box of cookies and slid it over towards Harry. "Weasley, right?" he guessed. "Rickety bungalow, three kids, annual Quidditch League pass, Christmas year-round, that sort of thing." Draco turned around and rested against the counter beside Harry, both staring out the window at the fresh sparkling snow that had fallen overnight. The year had gone by quickly this time around. "The holidays aren't too bad," Draco confessed. "Mother used to dress the manor like this. She would throw lavish Christmas parties, mostly to impress. I don't think she had many friends, not in the strictest sense of the word. The presents, I didn't mind. I never liked putting it on for the society ladies though." When Astoria did her elaborate decorations, Draco was brought back to those memories. It was bittersweet, remembering his mother swishing her wand in an elegant swoop to wrap a garland around the tree. Things were different now, especially after divorcing Astoria. There were no more parties at the Malfoy Manor. No more facades. It was a lot quieter. "I did have a good time yesterday."
The cellar door flung open up above, striking the stone wall with a terrific crash. "What's taking you two so long?" Theo called down.
Harry was surprised by Scorpius' initiative, although he didn't express it in any way other than by widening his smile. "Teddy's coming into town tomorrow, so I've got to get his room all set up," he said. "I'm sure he will keep me busy, like he always does." As he said that, he thought of something. "Hey, Scorpius?"
Astoria's words faded as she stepped inside the manor, saying, "I didn't think I'd walk in on you confessing your soul to Harry Potter-"
Harry simpered at Draco to gloat before graciously bowing to Scorpius. "Thank you, thank you." He straightened up. "I have a ball to attend tonight."
He tapped his pencil against his chin. Now that all the pleasantries were out of the way, what did he want to ask Teddy? Should he just ask what happened to Harry? Or should he be more discreet?
When he cracked an eye open, he saw Draco fuming before him but no hint of any further violence. Still... Unusually close. "Did you finally snap?" he meekly asked.
"Why not?" Scorpius asked. "It's okay, Dad. He likes to know if things are broken. Yesterday, Annie broke some crayons and Harry said-"
Harry didn't know what to do with that kid. "I wanted to speak to him before I... That is, we had a couple of long talks after we received your letter," he said. He didn't mention that the 'talks' were actually just him trying to convince Teddy not to sulk. "He's protective."
Harry's question, although barely mumbled, seemed to hang in the air for a little while before fading.
The enormity of all that singing didn't strike him until the thunderous applause that followed. His eyes snapped up to the audience and, though he couldn't make out a single face because of the lights above his head, he could hear their cheers.
Draco tsked and pulled Scorpius on top of him. Scorpius ducked his head when Draco brushed his blonde hair away from his forehead. The ache in Draco's chest that had started the night before was starting to return as he tried to memorize his son's slight frown and pursed lips. How time flew. "I love you," he said. "Do you know that?"
Harry snapped his teeth together, now positively fuming as he glared at Draco. "No," he said deliberately. "Your problem is that you try to protect Scorpius to such an extent that it suffocates him."
The three of them glanced back to where the real Harry Potter stood, looking eerily like a taller version of Teddy's impression, complete with a sour expression and his hands at his hips.
Harry didn't even have to think twice. "First door on the right," he said as Draco rushed past him. He cringed when he heard retching in the bathroom. He wandered into the drawing room, leaving Malfoy to his business.
Harry hesitated. Then he shrugged. Then he said, "Something like that," his words muffled behind his hand.
But Draco drew him back in with a gentle touch at the small of his back. Draco tasted gingerbread, smelt familiar soap, and felt a flutter in his stomach as he brushed his lips over Harry's. They hardly ever kissed this way, lingering in tender and nonchalant.
The next evening, Scorpius was kneeling on the carpeted floor of his bedroom, laying out all the leaves he had picked up from the park in order of size. They were of all sorts of colours and still damp from the melted snow. He had made sure to pick the most perfect ones and he was quite proud of his collection of ten different leaves.
"I see." Harry's situation couldn't be any more different from Draco's. "Everyone expects us to be together," he said. "And we always tried. We still try sometimes." Harry often couldn't imagine life without Ginny, but sometimes it was difficult to imagine a life
Draco hopped off the barrel, picked his wand up, regarded it for a moment, then slipped it back into his pocket. "Don't ever touch my wand."
Harry regarded him and the response for a beat. "Alright." He stepped back into the wintry night. "Then I'm not doing anything either." He shivered against the cold air. "Speaking of friends of convenience," he added, "this is rather convenient, isn't it?" With that, he disapparated from the front steps.
Draco felt as though he had been squeezed through the eye of a needle before falling on his hands and knees, bouncing softly on his landing. He was breathless and disoriented. He whipped his head around to look at where he was. It appeared to be a bedroom. Potter's bedroom? "What the-" He was yanked down. "Whoa. Wait-" He caught himself just before he could smack into Harry. This was not how he expected their talk to go. "What are you doing?"
"Alright, show's over." Harry grabbed a dish towel and tossed it over Teddy's head. "What have you spilled?" He ushered the boys out the kitchen, but not before casting a curious look at Draco.
"You just don't understand." Scorpius pushed Draco back and scooted away from him. "I'm going to have breakfast." He hopped out of bed without further fanfare.
Harry collapsed onto the grass beside Draco, exhausted. "What a day," he groaned as he flopped onto his back. "Thank goodness for Teddy." Teddy was keeping the children entertained with a game of Simon Says. When Teddy played Simon Says, things became very silly. The children were bent over double with laughter because Simon had told them to pretend to be chickens being chased by an army of gnomes brandishing feather dusters.
Harry was a mystery to Draco. The man would be utterly hopeless one moment and then spout something thoughtful the next. Draco couldn't get a fix on him, not because Harry hid his sentiments, but because he wasn't hiding them. He had always known Harry to be bold. He wasn't afraid to take a chance, look the fool, try something different, or say what was on his mind. He wasn't even afraid to fall asleep beside Draco.
Teddy marched over to his cluttered table and picked up a mysterious black bag that fit in the palm of his hand. He held it out to Scorpius.
"You aren't supposed to play with your food," Scorpius hummed, his lips quirking up into a sly smile. He chomped on the flower and chewed it happily. "Yummy."
Sometimes Harry was rather sweet and naive. "I'm not your keeper." Draco noticed the look on Harry's face, the way he bristled. He enjoyed riling Potter up. "You can do whatever you want."
They appeared in front of Ron and Hermione's home where the Weasley children were rearing to begin their pilgrimage to get as much candy as they possibly could in the span of a short few hours. "Oof," Ron said at the sight of Scorpius in his zombie get-up. "Spooky."
Scorpius' eyes went wide. He flicked his gaze between his star and his teacher's star. He realized after comparing the two that his teacher drew a much more grown-up star than he did. "I want to draw
He swept his hand over the fallen grounds, pushing them onto the floor. "No." He tapped his wand on the kettle. It rose and slowly poured hot water over the coffee in the press in hypnotizing circles.
Harry was tempted to ask how long it was going to take, but he held his tongue instead of antagonizing Malfoy any further. He glanced at his watch as the call ended. He still had some time before it was time to put his tired students to bed. He was sure Gabrielle could manage. He took a breath to calm himself, purposefully ignoring the pointed look the secretary was giving him. Draco Malfoy. Still a git. After composing himself, he walked back into the nurse's office.
Draco made his way back to the kitchen after gesturing at Harry to follow him, and asked, "How was he?"
"Hey, buddy," Harry said as Scorpius settled onto the pillow. "Your father asked if you could stay over at my place for few hours after school. Something came up, so he is running late."
When the two finally returned, Scorpius was glad to have the grass under his feet again. He snatched some berries from the basket of fruits they had brought with them, then ran off with a promise to bring back something cool for Harry from beyond the grove of trees. Harry waved at the sprinting boy, marveling at his energy, before sitting down to stretch his legs.
Draco nodded as he watched his son run down the gravel road, backpack swinging wildly as it often did. "I don't think I'm ready for that."
As Draco watched the three of them squabble, he thought back to a few years ago, when the holidays were a quiet and happy affair. Astoria would put soft music on and the manor would be dressed in the most elegant ornaments and garlands. Scorpius would be sticking close to her, helping her primp the tree or carry mugs of hot cocoa precariously. Draco never participated in the decorating. He knew he never did it the way Astoria wanted it to be done, so it was better left untouched. He simply enjoyed the way his son lit up during Christmas - in anticipation of the presents, spending time walking in the snow, lazing in front of a sweet-smelling fire, and falling asleep after feasts for lunch and dinner.
"I'll leave you to it." The nurse winked at Harry before walking away, letting the poor man fend for himself.
As soon as Draco heard the door to Scorpius' bathroom thud, he was pulling Harry out of the master bedroom. "Patty's going to be here any minute. You need to leave. Now," he hissed, not caring for the fact that Harry was stumbling over his feet behind him. "Quietly."
Harry realized that he really needed to learn to put a sock in it next time he felt like arguing with Malfoy. Lately it seemed to end with him wanting to take back his words. He cleared his throat. "Sorry. That was uncalled for."
Scorpius watched Draco drop his head in his hands with a defeated sigh, and asked, "Why didn't you tell me?" When Draco didn't answer, Scorpius got up on his knees on the sofa cushions and forced Draco's hands away from his face. "It doesn't bother me," he insisted. He wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and hugged him tight. "I was lying when I said I didn't like him. It doesn't bother me that Harry's your boyfriend."
Scorpius was fast asleep not ten minutes later, a blissful expression on his face as he lay enveloped in a plush blanket in the middle of his own huge king-sized bed, his brand new broomstick clutched in his hands. Draco and Astoria stood on the balcony of the suite, enjoying a final glass of ice wine in the cool breeze. Astoria rested her head on his shoulder while looking out into the dark gardens and starry sky. "Thanks for joining us, Draco. I wish it didn't have to end."
"Sure, he would," Scorpius insisted. "It'll be fun if he married you. He could come play with me all the time."
Draco watched the three of them bicker over the cake from his perch on the corner of the credenza behind them, thoroughly exhausted and dreading the kitchen clean-up that awaited him. He watched Scorpius and Teddy wave the sparklers wildly as Harry cut the cake. He watched Harry make the boys taste the cake first 'just in case'. And after getting a big nod of approval from the boys, he watched Harry try a piece. He watched Scorpius flush with pride when Harry loudly proclaimed that this was one of the best cakes he had eaten all year. There was surely crumbs everywhere, but Draco rarely had a chance to see his son like this, so he didn't bat an eye.
Harry got up off his chair in a huff. "Because you haven't said a word all morning." He folded his arms across his chest. "I knew it. I did something stupid last night, didn't I?"
"Alright, alright," Teddy laughed as Scorpius' whine carried into his spine. "I had fun too. And now I'm hungry."
These feelings had built up gradually, so slowly that Harry didn't even realize anything had changed until it was too late. Sitting together under the large oak tree after Scorpius' first flight, near enough to see the faint crinkles at the corner of his eye, worrying his lip with barely masked concern, pale fingers flipping through a page of the book that he clearly wasn't reading, a faint scent of cologne wafting in the autumn breeze, that was when Harry was struck with an intense clarity. In the library that same day, the Dark Mark didn't have quite the same impact on Harry as the feel of Draco's wrist in his hand. His skin was soft and cold. And, after lunch, when Draco angrily poured the tea down the drain, Harry had been surprised by a twinge in his chest, something akin to... fondness?
"Keep wiggling your teeth every night when you brush them. That way it will get looser and looser without you even noticing. Trust me. I've lost all my teeth already. I'm what you would call an expert." Harry puffed his chest out.
Harry pressed a hand to his heart. "Oh, you didn't," he gushed. He had been made to sit in the living room as soon as he had arrived to pick Teddy up from the manor. He had kept his eyes shut firmly as per instruction, and when he opened them, he was met with a cake on the coffee table and the two boys showing off their creation on either side of it. He pulled them into a big hug and said, "Thank you. You really didn't have to."
Draco had figured as much. Again, no skin off his back, he thought to himself. Or maybe he lied to himself.
Scorpius didn't find that idea as appealing as everyone else and Harry noticed that by the way his face twisted up. "Let's go," Harry rushed, but it was too late. Scorpius sagged heavily and shook his head as a muffled sob escaped him. He was embarrassed and shocked and scared and everything hurt and he didn't
Before Draco could blurt anything out, he was grabbed by the arm and pulled away firmly by Astoria. The two Malfoys stumbled along after her confident strides through the lines of milling parents, and Draco could hear her mutter under her breath, "Leave that poor man alone."
Scorpius rested his hands on the arm of the chair, tilting forward so his face was right up close to Draco's. "If Harry were here, you would let me, right?" he asked sweetly.
He splashed cold water in his face to snap out of those spiraling thoughts. Nothing productive came of dwelling in the past. His gaze followed the swirling water going down the drain. Then he glanced over at The Quibbler laying on the granite countertop, drops of water wetting the cover. Theo had called it a publicity stunt. Ginny Weasley was this Quidditch season's sweetheart, after the nail biting match against the Falmouth Falcons at the European Cup finals that summer. As the captain of Holyhead Harpies, she had turned the team around in a spectacular fashion over the past few years, culminating in a fantastic championship match that had the country hooked. Being by Ginny Weasley's arm at the award ceremony would put even the most heinous criminal in favourable light. No doubt the tabloids would latch onto this new development. Last month's Witch Weekly was already forgotten, thanks to The Quibbler article.
Draco couldn't pick out a single word of what Harry was saying. He could see Harry's lips moving, his left arm supplementing the story with descriptive gestures. Scorpius was listening intently, his mouth hanging open in astonishment. A familiar dread twisted Draco's stomach into knots. It made him weak. He managed to walk up to the foot of the hospital bed and sit down before his knees gave way. He gripped the edge of the mattress as he pretended that he was fine. That he hadn't spent the last three months fighting to keep it together. That he hadn't missed hearing Harry's voice.
. Like, the Unforgivable Curses. They've almost gotten themselves killed too. Can you believe it? Harry's the coolest godfather ever, Scorpius. He's the best wizard in all of history."
Harry arrived at the Malfoy Manor after school the next day and he was quite surprised to see a haggard Draco greet him at the door. "What's up with you?" Draco looked like he had just woken up. His hair was unkempt, he still wore his sleep clothes, and his eyes were bloodshot.
Scorpius seemed satisfied by that vague answer. Draco stifled a sigh. There were so many things he still had to explain to his son. Scorpius had no idea
Harry waited. Scorpius didn't move to leave like the rest of the children had the moment they had received their first present of the season. Instead, he seemed as though he wanted to say something more. But he kept his eyes on his shoes, evidently second-guessing himself. "What's up?" Harry prompted.
"Now, now." Harry rubbed circles on Scorpius' shuddering back. "Why would you say something like that?"
is what I hate about him. He wants to make everything perfect," he ranted. "Like the world needs to look the way
Harry didn't know what to say. He cradled the bird figurine in his palm, studying the intricate feathers, gleaming sheen, and stunning beauty of a Snidget. "It's so... I mean..." He gasped as a sudden thought occurred to him. "How much did this cost?! Are you insane?!"
"I did!" Scorpius threw his arms up. "I had so much fun, Dad. It's not fair how much fun I had. I wish you had come with us."
Astoria knew that to be true. Draco had always been rather lonesome, even as a child, too aloof to have this much fun. "He seems to be a popular boy."
Scorpius eyed the brown goop with some doubt before digging a finger into the blob and pulling off a small piece. It didn't feel like play dough. He ate it. It didn't taste like play dough.
Harry checked the time on his watch. "We should get going, actually," he told her apologetically. "We need to be at the Burrow before eleven."
"Oh," Scorpius flipped through the comic book and swallowed hard. "I have my mother and father. And… you, maybe?"
There was little point in trying to reason with a sulking boy. He held back a sigh instead. "Maybe, after you color it, you will like it. Show me when you're finished."
"This is wonderful, isn't it?" Astoria exclaimed. "You should come out with us more often." She always invited Draco to her Christmas walks with Scorpius, and he had always refused. But something was different this year. Because here he was, walking alongside her under the starry sky. "Let's get some cider."
Most of them glanced at each other, pursing their lips to indicate that they had nothing at all to say, whatever gave him that idea? Silence dragged on for a bit of time, making Teddy more and more irritable. If no one had anything to say, he just wished they would stop bugging him. Or start bugging him. Anything but what he had been put through for the past two months.
Harry smirked as he held his cup close, treasuring it while he shuffled into the bathroom. He looked worse for wear. His hair stuck up every which way, his eyes were red and droopy, and his stubble made him look his age. He splashed water on his face and attempted to smooth his hair by running a damp hand through it. It didn't help much. After freshening up as best he could, he made his way downstairs to the kitchen. The manor looked different in the morning. With the curtains thrown open, there wasn't any need for artificial lights. It was organically lit, making everything glow white. The shimmering chandeliers cast dancing rainbows on the walls. Harry paused at the foyer to look up. It really was beautiful in there.
"Sure, there is," Scorpius retorted, coming to Theo's rescue in an instant. "He's exciting." He liked Theo because Draco liked Theo. That was reason enough. He also hadn't seen Theo in ages.
Draco pretended not to see Harry glancing at him when he collected Scorpius from school. He wouldn't acknowledge Harry grazing his arm anytime he walked past. When a hot cup of coffee was waiting for him in the kitchen, he knew it would have just a bit too much sugar in it.
Scorpius didn't fancy having a pretty name. But he wasn't about to have an argument with this girl he had just met. "Thank you," he said dutifully. "You have a pretty name as well, Rose. Like a flower."
anyone. "I had always thought that you would be someone who would own one of those empires, you know? But here you are. A lawyer. Working in an office. A salaryman."
An hour later, Scorpius stumbled out of bed with an errant thought in his head - Harry had slept over. He blearily padded down the cold stairs and into the kitchen where he heard sounds of breakfast. He was disappointed when he saw his father alone in there, puttering around, cooking eggs. "Where's Harry?" Scorpius complained.
"Yes," Harry lied. Not a day had gone by yet when he wasn't hounded by people he hardly knew wanting to get a look inside his life that had been so uneventful over the past many years. He was suddenly the most sought out celebrity again, especially now that he had gained a certain level of notoriety. He was practically part of the Dark Army, in the eyes of many. Trying to avoid the reporters and crowds was exhausting.
Scorpius dismounted his Firebolt with Harry's help. Just as he took his first step, he tripped over an undone shoelace and fell onto the soft grass. "Ugh." He sat up while rubbing his sore hands together. "Stupid shoes."
"Perfect!" Theo grabbed the bottle and waltzed out of there with Scorpius in tow. "This will pair well with the cheesecake."
Draco rubbed the back of his neck, privately wishing Scorpius had inherited his discreet nature instead of Astoria's precociousness. He decided on responding with a nonchalant, "So what?"
From the other room, they heard a clatter followed by a dismayed, "Oh no," that prompted Harry to pull away.
When Harry glanced up from his reading, he found Scorpius sleeping with his head against the cushion and legs curled up. He glanced down at his watch. It was only seven and the boy was already asleep. Maybe he had been tuckered out from school. Harry rolled his neck and arched his achy back one more time before conjuring up a thin blanket. He draped it over Scorpius.
Scorpius glared at Draco when a quiet sound interrupted his concentration. Draco was quick to look out the window and feign innocence. "Do you have something to say?" Scorpius asked in a clipped tone; another line Draco sometimes used on Scorpius when he was being stubborn.
"Really, this has nothing to do with me," Harry tried to say. "Being in school with these other children helps him. That's all he needed to come into his own. He's very inquisitive and sharp."
Teddy narrowed his eyes and his smile turned into a very sly smirk. "That's a secret," he said. "You know something? I was glad that you agreed to come visit me. I don't know much about you at all, but I really want to know more. I don't have a proper family except for my Grandmum."
"I think so," Harry mumbled. He shifted his hand against the floor to sit up straighter, but let out a sharp yelp before he could readjust. Upon bringing his hand up, he realized that it wasn't just tomato sauce that was coloring his hand red.
Draco shoved Harry away angrily and spun around because he knew he would end up throwing a punch or two if they faced each other for much longer. He pressed his fists against his temples while his heart raced. This was his worst nightmare. This was the worst case scenario.
Hugo examined Scorpius, then reached out with his chubby hand. Scorpius flinched away in shock, knocking into Harry. He had never been that close to a baby before. Harry also knelt down next to them. "He likes you," he told Scorpius. "See? He's smiling." Hugo was grinning, which exposed his toothless gums, while reaching for Scorpius' hair again. Harry urged Scorpius forward. "You have to be gentle with him, okay?"
"Mount Kilimanjaro. That's very impressive." Harry nodded in appreciation. "You must have trained a bit before that climb. I've heard the altitude changes are nothing to balk at."
"Don't be a spoilsport," Scorpius chided. He set about inspecting the ground, poking it with a stick, taking care not to smudge the tracks.
Draco still didn't lift his eyes, but his finger twitched against the page. Scorpius was patient. He knew he had struck a nerve. He decided to keep strumming. "Maybe just for half an hour? And then I'll be so tired, I'll go to sleep right away," he promised. "Exercise is good for you, that's what I learned in school. In the winter, we don't get nearly enough exercise, did you know that? We'll bundle up a lot. We won't even feel cold-"
Harry swallowed the rest of his argument. Happy? He sort of was, actually. "Yes," he answered and folded his arms against his chest. "As a matter of fact-"
"Whoa, wait just a minute," Harry interrupted, holding up his hands. "I was just... I was making conversation."
Scorpius hollered in delight. "Teddy!" He grabbed his cousin and dragged him inside, snow and all. "This is the best surprise! Merry almost-Christmas!"
Harry raced down the grand staircase three steps at a time, nearly twisting his ankle on the last hop. He slashed his wand at the fireplace just as he heard the front door open. He had disappeared from the manor right when Patricia walked in.
Harry glanced over his shoulder at Draco. He saw the carefully guarded expression on Draco, as well as the imperceptible shake of his head. Puzzled, Harry wondered if he had said something he shouldn't have? Draco didn't elaborate. Harry hesitated a beat before saying, "Well... I suppose I should be off." He ruffled Scorpius' hair. He cast one final look at Draco before walking out of the manor and disapparating.
"Patricia said that he had outgrown them." Harry waved a flippant hand. "Think of it like arts and crafts."
"-let the goblins have their share and be done with it!" she finished, sitting up straight as a rod, as she did when she was indignant. Ron was rubbing her back, trying to calm her down. "Anyway," she shoved an errant piece of hair behind her ear and sank into the couch, "I digress."
Then he turned around to face the figure on the floor. Redoubling his hold on his wand, he approached it. A nagging thought in the back of his mind told him he was still dreaming. It must be a dream. He knelt down. With a gentle wave of his wand, he lit the chandelier in the foyer.
imagined herself with one. All her life she had wanted to spend days full of adventure, travel, experiences, and freedom. She did not want to be a mother. It had never been part of her plan. She had made that very clear to Draco before their marriage. At the time, Draco had agreed. They had agreed to adventuring and traveling and experiencing freedom together, now finally rid of the war and their past. So, she had been shocked when Draco fiercely urged her to keep the baby. Their marital problems started to surface after that. Astoria hated Draco for making her feel guilty for what she wanted out of life. Draco hated Astoria because of her seemingly callous attitude towards their unborn child. And, just before Scorpius was born, they separated with rough water under the bridge.
Draco tsked, grabbed the Daily Prophet off the coffee table, and tossed it to Harry. "Do the crossword." He went back to his letters.
Draco leaned forward to meet Theo's glower with a scathing look of his own. "The least I could do is tell him how much of your mother's money you've gambled away playing in goblin stocks."
Harry smiled, confused. "Um. Thank you." He took the lunchbox from Scorpius' hands. "You didn't have to do that."
Harry glanced at Draco, who hadn't moved from his spot by the window. "I don't think it's a good idea-"
Harry was inundated with Weasley well-wishes and food that afternoon. It turned into an impromptu gathering in his kitchen, in fact. Molly insisted that he still wear the sling for another day, so he was halfway useless, smiling helplessly at the ruckus around him. He wondered if the Weasleys were maybe making up for the past few months.
"Unbelievable." Draco dragged Harry to the side, away from Astoria's prying ears, and hissed, "I'm not your bloody babysitter."
Ron was beginning to read between the lines now. "Then, isn't this for the best?" he asked gently. "Wasn't this the wake-up call you were waiting for? All of you?" He sat down next to Harry. "Over the past year, we've been seeing less of you. You hardly talk to us. I doubt you talk to them about us. It must be tiring, living two lives. The new year will be here soon. It's time for a fresh start."
Everyone turned to look at Victoire Weasley, who was perched on a windowsill, Butterbeer in hand and examining her fingernails with sudden interest.
"I think you're a good person," Scorpius continued. He stroked Draco's cheek. "Because you're my father, I think you're good. People at school say mean things, but I don't believe them."
"I already told you I am," Harry said quietly while giving the boy a loaded look that told him to keep quiet. "I've been much worse, Molly," he added for her sake. "You know better than anyone. This is nothing at all. I don't even have to stay overnight. There's nothing to worry about."
Scorpius really was growing up much too fast, Draco thought as he conceded with a smile and a nod. "I am very proud of you," he said. "You found all that out by yourself."
"Ah, so he doesn't like me much." Draco rubbed the back of his neck. "Not too obvious, no. He was acting strangely yesterday around me. He hardly spoke to me. Which is very unusual for him. He is usually talking my ear off."
With a loud snap, Harry shut the book in his hands and placed it back on the shelf. "A lot of history," he echoed under his breath. He walked up to Draco. "What do you plan on doing with them?"
made a bigger deal out of things and then everyone came rushing down to worry insistently until he was smothered. Usually he would have no problem being in that position. When Molly smothered him, it meant great food. When Ron smothered him, there were gratuitous compliments and an almost brave optimism. Today was slightly different, what with the Malfoys thrown into the mix.
"He's not my teacher this year," Scorpius explained. "He's been teaching me to fly. Oh, you should see the tricks I can do, Theo. You'll hardly believe it."
Harry swished his wand at the pantry. Scorpius' eyes widened when an assortment of cheeses, cold cuts and spreads floated out. "I used to do this with Teddy," Harry said conversationally as he sat down without noticing Scorpius' astonishment. "He's such a picky eater, so I let him make his own sandwich."
"I could manage," Harry said under his breath, much to Arthur's amusement. After some coaxing, Arthur managed to get his wife to let go of Harry. The two said their goodbyes and left.
Draco knew that and wasn't going to let that stop him. "Scorpius would have more fun with you in any case. I didn't have to come along."
Scorpius' thumping footsteps echoed down the stairs, and his muffled voice calling out, "Dad? Harry?"
After all these years of being tackled by children, Teddy knew to brace himself when Scorpius flew at him. "Merry almost Christmas!" he cheered just as enthusiastically as Scorpius. He caught the little boy mid-flight and spun around. "Did you get me a present?"
Harry clicked his tongue in exasperation. He had expected to hear this but it was still very frustrating. Prejudices ran high, especially within the Ministry. The Malfoys were the only Death Eaters who were acquitted, but that didn't mean Draco was in the clear. "How often?"
Harry tripped over an uneven step and twisted his body around to save the 'priceless' bottles of wine in his hands, landing square on his back with a grunt. "Oof."
"Certain that she's here to stay?" Harry had heard this from many a divorced parent in his line of work. Mothers and fathers didn't want to introduce a new person into their child's life until they were certain. He supposed Draco was even more cautious than other parents because Scorpius' own mother wasn't 'here to stay'.
Harry was just finishing up his lesson plan in his library when the fireplace suddenly flared orange, startling him into knocking his hand against the inkwell and upsetting it. Before he could duck under the table, Ginny's flickering face appeared in the flames. "Not so fast, Potter!"
Draco clicked his tongue in defeat. "It's okay, Scorpius." He had most certainly overreacted, but he would rather overreact than have a boy with warty hands running amok in his home. "You need to be careful picking around in the dirt. You never know what kind of diseases are around."
The room once again fell silent. Scorpius hopped up onto the bed, Draco stared at passing cars on the street, and Harry tried to figure out what to do next. "That wasn't so bad." He scrunched his eyes up when he felt a sharp pain in the back of his skull. He shook it off. "Some might even call it civilized."
Teddy stopped his yammering when he felt Harry jerk in his sleep. He tried to shake Harry awake. "Wake up?" Harry kept sleeping. "Well, if you were so tired, you shouldn't have come over." Teddy eased a thin sheet over his godfather and tucked him in.
"No." Draco didn't add that the reason was because Astoria had a new fling every month. If she kept them abreast of her love life, they would be going cross-eyed with the sheer number of names they'd have to remember. "Bad example, Potter."
Draco carefully brushed some specks off the table so he wouldn't have to look at his son. "No. I don't have a problem," he answered.
Harry froze while trying hard to wipe a guilty expression off his face. "I wasn't going anywhere," he said, lying through his teeth.
"Oh dear," the beautiful blonde woman cooed as she bent down to pick up her son. "Look at you! You're so grown up!"
Draco picked up the Snidget imitation from the mantle of the old stone fireplace in the great room of 12 Grimmauld Place. The intricate figurine looked rather out of place beside crooked frames of Harry's friends and family and the misshapen clay plate adorned with five-year-old Teddy's blue smudged handprint. "I cannot picture you buying something like this," he told Harry.
Draco tilted his head and muttered, "That's what I thought." He pulled away, slapped the books out of Harry's hands, and stood up, paying no mind to the indignant exclamation that followed him on his way out the study.
After dinner, the family settled in the living room for a nightcap. Soft music played in the background as assorted fruits and cups of tea were passed around. The children were quieting down considerably by then, leaving the adults to their own conversations. It was nearing eleven when Ginny was finally able to wriggle out of her mother's grasp and join Harry on the floor by the window. He had Rose in his arms and she was fast asleep. Ginny smiled as she stroked her niece's cheek. "I missed you all so much."
Meanwhile, Harry and Draco were seated in the living room. They had finished up with their pleasantries, leaving them with little else to talk about, so an uncomfortable silence was starting to encroach.
While some of the children turned back around nervously, a few smiled up at Scorpius, beckoning him to join them. Scorpius shook his head. To emphasize his intentions, he even shuffled back a bit. Harry had been flinching through the whole fifteen-second scene, wondering if it was time for him to intervene yet.
"And a mistake," Draco was quick to add, now kicking himself for saying the wrong thing. "That was definitely-"
Harry followed suit and lay down as well, shoulder to shoulder with Draco. He stared up at the breezy canopy above them. "If it hadn't been for me, you'd drink the potion and they'd know you were telling the truth. Easy."
Astoria gasped. "Oh dear, how improper of me." She began to get up. "How about a cup of coffee? Draco just brewed a fresh pot."
Harry shifted his weight uncomfortably as he slid his cold hands into his pockets. "Next Friday is the winter pageant. Scorpius told you about that, right?"
"It matters to me too," Harry confessed. And, with that, he took his hand off of Draco's leg. "I like you." He placed the wand atop the barrel, beside Draco, and hesitated for a moment. "That is..." He looked at Draco without pretense and repeated, "I like
After brunch came more games, this time with some adults joining in on the fun. They played Stuck in the Mud and Mother May I with hilarious results of Charlie having to twirl on one foot ten times until he toppled over and Angelina waving her arms about wildly at everyone who passed her so she could get 'unstuck' from the mud. Scorpius felt both overwhelmed and delighted to be part of such festivities. He never knew playing with adults could be this much fun. But he had a feeling the Weasleys weren't a regular set of adults.
The mad scramble that ensued lasted seconds, but it felt like ages as they fumbled out of bed while wiping sleep from their eyes and silently threatening to punch each other for not waking up even once through the night. Once presentable, Draco opened the door a crack, so Scorpius couldn't see into the bedroom. "What time is it?"
As Draco made his way downstairs, he made out commotion coming from the foyer, where the boys had cleared a path to show off their cartwheel and round-offs to each other. At that moment, Teddy and Harry were racing each other from the dining room to the living room doing somersaults, Scorpius cheering them on with excited claps and hoots whenever Teddy veered into Harry's path. The Christmas decorations had been pushed out of the way to make room for their ruckus. Christmas music blared. Draco gingerly lowered his aching body down onto the marble steps to watch the chaos. How or
Scorpius followed Teddy's instructions. The chocolate melted all over his hands and the marshmallow stuck to his fingers, and he couldn't be more ecstatic.
"I think you're a natural." Harry wasn't being patronizing. Scorpius really was growing fearless after each flight. "You'll be showing Teddy up in no time."
Draco shrugged as he walked over to inspect the stew bubbling away in the pot on the hob. "No one was home. Scorpius has a play date."
Harry was so glad to feel Scorpius' enthusiasm. It wasn't often that the boy spoke highly of one of his own works. He was usually critical instead of pleased. "Then I guess you need to share your star with your father, Scorpius."
"You would think so, won't you? And then you try to go to the loo, slipping and sliding your way out of the banquet hall," Astoria said. The boys cracked up. "My heels were this tall." She moved her hands apart an exaggerated ten inches. "Can you imagine?"
On cue, Astoria breezed into the kitchen holding the plate of pancakes. "They hardly ate any of this," she complained.
Theo swallowed his curiosity. He knew better than to push Draco to open up. It was best to let him be. "Anyway, speaking of Scorpius," Theo said, "when do you pick him up from school?"
record of me breaking the law over the past decade?" Draco seethed. "Do you have any substance in your case?"
"Just wondering." Harry set the cup full of pencil crayons on the table. "It's strange seeing you like this - a part-time homemaker."
"We pretended for a while. Then we just stopped pretending." Draco hadn't thought about this for a long time, and it had been even longer since he had spoken about it with anyone. "She couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand her. Trying became too hard." Theo had been furious with them when they broke the news of their impending divorce. He had called them cowards. "We like the easy way out." He knew Theo was right.
It wasn't often that Astoria wanted to have a serious discussion with Draco, so he paid attention. "Alright," he said slowly.
"Ah, that can be a problem." Harry knelt down beside Scorpius and pulled his foot forward. "Shall I show you?"
Scorpius was practically buzzing with excitement as he picked his little legs up on his walk up a gravely path in the middle of a countryside he had never seen. Teddy was already so far ahead, running up the slope with purpose with Harry following along, enjoying the early summer wind in his hair. Summer had just begun and the three of them were feeling wonderful. Scorpius and Teddy had no idea where they were going. That morning, Harry had come over to the Malfoy Manor with Teddy and said that they were going out for the day. It was going to be a lot of fun and they were made to wear light clothes and a good pair of sneakers.
Draco stumbled to a halt at the bottom of the stairs. He took a moment to survey the damage. Then laughter bubbled up in him and burst out.
"Then don't waste my time." Draco pushed Harry off of him and rolled out of bed. "Like I said, I can listen and get dressed." These evening rendezvous were beginning to get out of hand. Third time this week Draco had lied to Scorpius about working late. It left a bad taste in his mouth. But rather this than trying to explain to his son that he was having a tryst with Harry Potter. Draco buttoned his trousers and realized that Harry hadn't said anything in a minute. He looked back at the bed where Harry was watching him. "What am I supposed to listen to?"
They were in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Typically, being admitted to St. Mungo's meant something was awfully wrong with you. Unfortunately for Harry, any injury he incurred resulted in a huge hubbub. Sometimes he felt as though he was treated like porcelain instead of the Boy-Who-Lived. That day, he had been placed in a rather swanky private hospital room despite his protests. He wished he could just be in his own bed instead of being fawned over something so silly.
They sat in silence for a moment, although the greenhouse itself was anything but. Chirps, croaks, snorts, rustling, squelching, squawking-
Scorpius ignored him and kept stomping off. If he wanted to make sense of things, he would have to learn more about this strange person. His nanny would be the best person to ask. "You are
"That's a relief," Draco grumbled. He was sitting in the library with his work piled up in front of him. His head ached, his nose was stuffy, his throat was sandy, and he felt awful. It didn't help that stupid Potter was sitting across from him with a stupid patronizing grin on his stupid smug face. "Go away."
A little while later, Scorpius slipped and skidded his way to Theo and Draco real quick when he saw them standing at the front gates after school. "Uncle Theo!" he cheered. "Happy New Year!"
Harry let out a loud sigh. "Do you think you should be seen at St. Mungo's?" he tried again. That was an innocuous enough question. Malfoy shook his head. Harry wanted to insist that he go because he was definitely not confident in his first-aid skills. But if Malfoy was feeling alright, who was he to argue? "Right then…" He drummed his fingers on the table. He had done everything he could do, he figured. "You can go home, if you want?"
Draco forced out an exhale. He was determined not to be happy. He picked up the shuddering kettle and began pouring steaming water over the coffee grounds by hand. He found Potter absolutely baffling. Especially at this moment, gloating in his kitchen, pretending to know everything, barging into his life. "You could have said no to Scorpius."
"What will happen when Scorpius isn't around anymore? When he's off to Hogwarts? He won't be a distraction."
"I can take care of you if you want to be a baby sometimes," Scorpius promised his father. He had never had to take care of anybody before. "I can be
"Wait." Harry hurried after him. Draco was striding up the narrow stone stairs with purpose, heading straight for the front door. "Malfoy, wait." He grabbed Draco by the arm and forced him to stop. "Where were you last night?" He peered into the pale man's face, trying to make out an answer.
Draco didn't lift his eyes off of the baked fish he was carefully plating as he said, "What do you need me for?"
"Well, it's not the first time you've had to fend off your fans." She winked at him. "And, speaking of your precious fans, Teddy's being a pain in my arse again. I mean, how many damned broomsticks does he need? He sends me a letter every other week asking for one. What does he do? Gobble them up for dinner?"
Astoria interjected by putting her hand over Scorpius' and saying, "That trick won't work." She told Harry, "Don't bother with him. He knows we won't want them. He's planning on keeping them for himself."
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry watched Scorpius scuff his shoe on the floor for a few moments before turning around and walking back to his solitary corner. He pretended not to notice when the boy glanced at him.
A few of weeks in, Harry chanced upon Scorpius' art once again during drawing hour. The boy must have drawn at least twenty stars on the page and was in the process of coloring around the points with a dark blue crayon to make a sky. Harry arched an impressed brow. "Hey, buddy… Who taught you to draw that?" he asked.
"I'm sorry." Harry couldn't stop his voice from quivering. "I am. I wish I hadn't- And now I-" He broke off as his words cracked in his scratchy throat.
"I don't want you to feel that way." Harry hated to think that Draco felt less than because of him. "Don't fret about it, because I don't. I want you to know that I don't think about that stuff."
Before long, they were in the nurse's office and he couldn't have stopped crying even if he wanted to. It was even sadder to see because when Scorpius cried, he kept his voice inside, screwed his eyes shut, and pursed his lips closed so not one sound escaped him. He ended up shaking and trembling with each stifled breath.
"Daddy," Scorpius whimpered. His fingers were clenched into fists and they bunched up his father's shirt. "Don't go," he begged.
glad for it. He had been worried that he would fall behind, although it would be quite hard to fall behind in a Year 1 class. As they ate dinner together, Harry told him how children often get sick this time of year. Flu season, he said. All of them had to keep washing their hands and covering their coughs to make sure they weren't spreading germs. Scorpius felt a bit embarrassed as he wondered whether he had gotten his friends sick.
Draco tossed the damp towel over the boy's head again. "I don't want anything for Christmas." He began drying Scorpius off.
"Good, good." Theo shifted Scorpius over to his other arm so they could shake hands. "Surprised to see you here, I must say. I was expecting you to be an Auror or something else of similar caliber."
Harry bit the side of cheek when he realized that Scorpius didn't think it was okay at all. "Alright, what should we do to make it more perfect?"
"Hello." Scorpius strode up to Harry and stuck the lunchbox straight at him. "I made you a sandwich."
When he walked into the living room, he found the curtains had been drawn and Potter was standing in front of the fireplace, pretending to read a book. He also spotted his wand on the table beside the couch he had been laid up on. Relieved, he strode to it and slid it into his pocket. Then he hazarded a glance at Potter who quickly averted his eyes down to the brown pages in his hands. The stuffy silence was difficult to sustain. So, Draco cleared his throat. "I-"
Harry glanced at Ron in dismay before pushing off the pillows and swinging his legs off the bed, wincing when a stabbing pain pierced his shoulder as he got up unsteadily. He hobbled over to Scorpius with some effort. "I'm okay. I didn't mean to scare anyone." He rested a hand on Scorpius' shoulder to try to get him to look up. "Would I be lying?"
my closet?" Harry exclaimed. His closet wasn't really a closet, to be fair. It was just a cupboard and a bunch of drawers stuffed with shirts and pants he had bought over ten years ago. Perfectly good shirts and pants too, he thought. But when it came time to annual Ministry hullabaloos, he had to break out the black tie attire he kept in the back of the wardrobe, shake off the moths, and begrudgingly wear it. This year, he had somehow misplaced the tie. He stood in front of the rows of ties of all colours and shapes neatly hanging from pegs. "You're too much."
"Of course, I am!" Harry wanted to melt through the floorboards and disappear. "Don't go reading into things a five-year-old brat wrote! I don't know what he was thinking."
After all the lecturing, he made sure to look sincerely sad and sorry. He knew that they weren't angry with him. They simply seemed to think that he was incapable of taking care of himself. There might be a bit of truth in that statement, but Harry glanced over that. He then told them that he had to continue maintaining a good relationship with the Malfoys because Teddy would be very angry with him otherwise.
Harry swallowed hard and nervously rolled up the magazine in his hands. "They're rather good pictures," he said in an attempt to lighten the mood. "Have you taken a look at them?"
Luna looked back at him, her dreamy expression fading as she studied his face. She then squinted and placed her teacup down on the table before leaning very far forward, startling Harry into craning back in his chair. She moved her gaze over him rapidly. "Hmm." She sniffed a few times. "Hmm." She closed an eye, then opened it, then closed the other eye. "Hmm." Then she sat back. "No. You're still the same."
"Sore subject." Harry didn't like talking about his childhood. "It makes him special though. He appreciates the little things in life. I've noticed."
"No." Draco finally finished brewing his coffee and set the implements aside before bringing the cup up to his lips.
On the day Astoria went into labor, she refused to call Draco. She couldn't stand looking at him, not for another second. She had deluded herself in thinking that they would have a happy marriage. She hated him for what he was making her go through, with this child. He didn't deserve her.
"You're nicer than him, though," Harry said. He watched Scorpius to see if he had elicited a reaction from the boy. When he hadn't, he added, "Don't tell him I said that."
Astoria was arranging the presents under the tree when Draco stormed into the living room. She had heard the door slam shut, but she didn't comment on it. He sat down by the hearth and began peeling off his wet socks, warming himself at the fire. After a few moments of silence, Astoria asked, "Is it strange that I come over for the holidays?"
Harry knocked on the door to Teddy's room that was perpetually locked now that he was old enough to learn how to cast a charm.
Harry now stood beside him, hands pressed against the edge of the sink, leaning forward to study his expression. "What happened last night?"
Harry placed hot cups of tea on the table, along with the sugar bowl and some milk. He sat across from the Malfoys, elbow on the table, cheek propped up on his fist. "So?"
important for Scorpius' future. Why do you think I fought so hard to get him into that school? I'm glad you two have made amends. It's all for your baby, right?"
Draco turned to Harry incredulously when he heard the defeated mutter, and his bewilderment doubled when Harry leaned in and kissed him.
Scorpius scuffed his foot on the floor and tugged Draco's sleeve. "Last year Harry practiced with me at school, remember?" he hummed.
"Sure!" Scorpius didn't have to be told twice for a chance to jump on the swings. He dumped his backpack with Draco and raced away, melting into the crowd of children leaving for the day.
"That's okay," Scorpius answered while getting under his blanket and rolling away from Harry. He was the only child who didn't bring a stuffed animal to school to hold while sleeping.
Harry gnashed his teeth together. He wasn't going to give Draco the satisfaction. "You're not nearly as smooth as you think you are," he mumbled under his breath. He crouched down to pick the books up.
Draco wiped his mouth and rested the back of his head against the cool tile behind him as he caught his breath. An unbelievable nightmare, that’s all this was. He pressed a hand against his fevered forehead.
Harry sighed for the umpteenth time while looking up at the ceiling from his slouched perch on the couch. It's what he had been doing for the past hour. Then he let out a pitiful groan and slid sideways so he ended up curled on the couch cushions with his knees pulled towards his chest and his arms wrapped around them.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. "What happened between you and Astoria?" he asked instead of answering Draco.
"Because, you know, I think Harry likes you a lot too. You shouldn't worry about what other people think, especially if they are bullies." Scorpius also knew something else. Sometimes it was hard to talk without knowing where to begin. Lucky for Draco, Scorpius knew exactly where to begin.
taken Scorpius out with him. Scorpius was holding onto Teddy's hand tight and gawking at everything. Draco knew that when Scorpius grew older, he would start resenting the sheltered childhood he had led. But, for now, Draco would protect his son as much as possible. Strolling down the street with Harry Potter was about as much protection as anyone could get. That didn't stop Draco from worrying incessantly.
pale Scorpius while tending to what appeared to be a twisted ankle. Harry attempted to shoo the other children away but all of them insisted on staying and watching this excitement. Scorpius was worrying his lip and sniffling back tears. Gabrielle shrugged at Harry, as though to say the ankle didn't seem too bad. Harry ruffled Scorpius' hair to try to get him to look up. Scorpius ducked his head instead. Gabrielle hooked a finger under her student's chin and moved his head up so he could see her smile. He blinked away his tears and used the back of his hand to wipe his nose. "Can you walk?" Harry asked. Scorpius didn't answer. "Let's try," Harry encouraged as he helped the boy up. He was able to stand on one foot while keeping a tight hold on Harry's arm. "There we go." Harry waved a hand at Gabrielle so she would stay put with the other children.
"I'm sorry to sound insensitive, Harry," Hermione said. "But you need to take into account the reactions you'll be getting from people who aren't as forgiving as your friends. Like your work, for instance. Have you thought of that?"
"That's too bad." She let the door swing shut as she disappeared into the dining room to relay the unfortunate news to the boys.
Draco watched Harry massage his aching temple and Scorpius pout sympathetically. "Are you sure you want to go back to your place?" he asked.
"You two better," Draco muttered under his breath. He was having immense reservations about sending his son deep into Weasley territory for an entire day. He must have be going insane. He looked down at Scorpius who appeared about as nervous as he did. "Behave," he said sternly. Scorpius nodded more than a few times to show that he understood.
Scorpius didn't know how to respond to that. Teddy laid the book on Scorpius' lap. Scorpius picked it up and held it as though it was the most precious thing. "Thank you."
that could happen?" he asked. "You might be a bit angry with yourself, a bit embarrassed, and tomorrow will be a brand new day. So, if that's the
, perhaps, and he was probably telling the truth. He didn't care and there was nothing wrong with it. Harry exhaled in one big rush and shut his mouth.
A few minutes later, Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione were seated on the musty couches upstairs. Draco had his arms crossed at his chest and one of his knees bounced in an off-beat rhythm. He was frowning at Ron who was too busy frowning at Harry to notice. Hermione sat on the edge of her seat, waiting to hear an explanation while Harry darted his eyes at all of them, trying to gauge the atmosphere. There was just silence for a few minutes until Hermione broke it by clearing her throat. The three men turned their attention to her. She nodded at Harry, urging him to begin.
Scorpius pouted and stalked away. He didn't fancy being called ugly. Blame it on some Malfoy pride, if you will. Besides, after all he had seen of Harry, he was willing to defend the man.
"There's nothing to see, Ron." Harry's right arm was in a sling and tied close to his chest so the bone would remain in place while it set. Other than that and a small scrape on his cheek, he looked fit as a slightly banged up fiddle.
"Just past nine." Draco brought the coffee to Harry, who took it gratefully. "Boys aren't awake yet. Breakfast?"
Draco let out an exasperated exhale. "What?" It was rhetorical 'what'. He knew what Harry was alluding to. Draco dropped down onto the bench beside Harry. "Why do I have to say anything to him?"
The Aurors couldn't seem to grasp Draco's words. After a moment of deliberation, they got up and left without saying another word, leaving Draco alone in the interrogation room once again. He dropped his head on the table and curled his arms around them.
Scorpius started and quickly shook his head. "Merry Christmas," he said, then he attempted to scurry past his teacher.
"Look," he said through clenched teeth. "I've been telling you for years now, and I'm going to keep telling you the same thing - I am not part of the Dark Army anymore."
"I want Teddy to meet his family," Harry said when he was asked the question. "Isn't that a good reason?" The four of them were walking back to 12 Grimmauld Place, the children running ahead to jump in the slushy puddles while the adults hung back to speak.
"Yes, I'm fine," Scorpius mumbled while rocking in his father's arms. "You have to be nicer," he added.
"Five more minutes." Draco turned his back to Harry and sank into the pillows again. His exposed skin was flawless and creamy, faint musculature visible when he shifted in his sleep. Harry slid a hand down his spine, eliciting a shiver. He tsked and arched away.
"Gotten him into heaps of trouble already too," Harry said under his breath as he walked into the room smelling a bit less like tomatoes. "Lunch?"
"I was saying that Draco has made sure of it," Harry mumbled. "Protecting Scorpius, I mean. From the past."
"We read a lot. Usually he has to work for a bit in the library. And we paint. Or we go outside in the yard and explore if it's not snowing out. When Nanna is here, I go out with her. We go shopping for groceries and she lets me feed the birds at the park. What do you do, Harry?"
"About time," Draco muttered. He was minutes away from a mental breakdown and he would hate to give those Aurors the satisfaction. He knew he could be detained for twenty-four hours without cause because of his criminal record. He just never realized that things would come to that. He snatched his jacket off the chair and stalked out, making sure to glare at the Hit wizard the whole time. It was the least he could do. Three hours in that godforsaken room, enough to drive a man mad.
"I would have swallowed it too if I hadn't realized that my tooth was suddenly missing," Harry said. "It didn't hurt one bit. All you've got to do is wait for the right moment to pull it out. It feels funny once you've lost them."
Scorpius giggled. It certainly would look pretty funny. He could imagine it right now. He held up his peanut butter flower. "This one's nice."
Draco whipped his head to the side to find Harry sitting up beside him. Sunlight streamed around them. "Damn," they swore in unison.
Harry turned away from his conversation with George to find Ginny at the stairs, beckoning him up. He tried to wave her off, because George was fascinating him with a marvelous new invention in the Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes – a jewel pouch that dispensed miniature dancing pixies who would nick any knut-sized shiny object in plain sight. He felt a hand grabbing his collar from behind and he had no choice but to stagger up the stairs, much to the amusement of the handful of people who witnessed this.
The Holyhead Harpies were indeed quite a surprise entry into the World Cup that would be taking place that summer. They deserved all the success because they had been training day and night for that one shot. Harry was very proud of Ginny and looking forward to what the year would bring. "Best season they've had in ten years, I'd say."
"Mhm." Teddy pressed the bag into Scorpius' free hand as he chewed up the rest of the candy and swallowed it. "Give it to your friends at school. Then you'll be so popular. My friends are always asking me to get them stuff from the joke shop. That's why I'm so popular." He marched over to his bookshelf. "Do you like comic books?"
"Don't tell me shut up." Draco got up and grabbed Harry by the arm to spin him around so they were facing each other. "This isn't about you. You are used to this. You can handle this. This is about me. It's about Scorpius."
In the warm orange glow, Draco saw Harry standing before him, no longer shrouded in darkness. Not anyone or no one. Here was someone standing before him.
Teddy glanced back at his cousin. His stomach clenched in dismay when he found the boy in tears. He hurried over to Scorpius. "What are you crying for?" he chided gently. He hugged Scorpius. "Harry does this
"He was right about everything." Scorpius sniffled. "Teddy said that everyone would be angry with you and that it'll only make you sadder. I don't want you and Dad to be sadder. Teddy was right about everything." He pushed the rest of his sobs down. This was the worst day in his whole entire life. "And... I thought you got really hurt, Harry. I got scared."
Another hour went by for Draco. An hour of pacing the small room bathed in yellow light, worrying about Scorpius even though he was perfectly fine with Patricia, cursing the Ministry, for whatever that was worth. An hour before the door to the interrogation room was opened by the Hit wizard. Draco stopped his pacing.
Draco could never fully express the love he had for his son. He couldn't get the words out without sounding disingenuous, so he had stopped trying. But he would hug like this and Scorpius would understand. He loved his father too. He listened to their hearts, wondering how much older he would have to get before his heartbeat started sounding as loud as his father's.
On Halloween, Harry figured he would be doing Draco a favour by offering to take Scorpius trick-or-treating with the Weasley children. He was often put in charge of herding them like cats from one neighbourhood to the next until sunset on Halloween night. One more child in the mix wasn't going to change much.
Harry looked over at Draco. The man appeared withdrawn, exhausted, and lost in the past. "Do you want to sleep?"
Harry was startled to hear a voice so familiar and buried so deep in his memories. Memories of the sounds of ladles striking cauldrons in potions class, freezing wind on the Quidditch pitch, the metallic stench of blood in a dirty bathroom, searing heat of magical fire... It all came flooding back when he heard the voice of Draco Malfoy.
Furious, Draco grabbed Harry's wrist and jerked him forward with a snarl. "What more do you want from me?!"
"You could say that again." Astoria, like Draco, wasn't used to being around children looped up on sugar. She watched from afar instead of getting into the fray. That was excitement enough for her. She looked over at Harry. "Alright, Harry?"
Harry jerked awake. "Huh?" He blearily swatted at his ear before flipping over onto his side so he could glare at Draco. "What?"
"Of course! They were Harry's not-so-proper family first," Teddy said. "Harry's best friends with Ron and Hermione. This is Ron's proper family, actually. They like to add more and more people to their family, that's what I think. You know, Harry and Ron and Hermione met at Hogwarts ages ago. Can you believe they're still friends? They've gone on a lot of adventures together."
Scorpius skidded to a halt in front of Draco first. "Dad, come play!" He grabbed Draco's elbow and tried to pull him up.
Students were crowded around the sofas and warm fire, chatting lazily on a Saturday night, munching on sweets from Hogsmeade, happy to have one more day off.
Draco smirked at Teddy's comments as he resorted to forcefully grabbing Harry's wrist and pressing the tip of his wand against the saucy hand. The skin melded together easily so that not even a faint scar remained. "Twice a month, hmm?"
Draco stumbled into a bookshelf beside Harry. His head and elbows smacked into the mahogany with a resounding thud. "Ow!" He scowled at Harry. "What?"
An enormous weight lifted off of Draco's shoulders, he finally relaxed his fists. He didn't even have to ask. Selfless Potter could read his mind, he thought wryly.
Harry knew pressing Scorpius would get him nowhere. So he said, "Alright, it's nothing." He let go of Scorpius, who looked relieved. But before he could turn to leave, Harry asked, "Are you doing anything fun for the holidays?"
No one spoke for the longest time. The Weasleys were trying to make sense of the scene they had walked in on. Harry stood in front of them with an arm in a sling, a slow bruise blooming on his cheek. Draco appeared rather like a spooked deer, perched on the edge of the hospital bed. Scorpius quickly let go of Harry's hand and gawked back at the Weasleys, wide eyed and slack jawed.
"Dad, you need to grow up," Scorpius advised. "You are my father now. No more fighting with Harry. He doesn't have a mother or father to teach him to how to say things. That's why sometimes he is rude to you. But he's always nice to me."
By then, Scorpius could make out faint music and muffled clatter. His curiosity piqued, he wriggled out of his father's grasp and ran up ahead, trying to catch up to his cousin. Harry waved him along when he looked back to make sure it was okay to go. Then Harry turned to Draco, finally letting go of him. "What is your problem?"
Harry titled his head down to hide his amusement from Draco. What was he to do with this sweet boy? "Do you know what I heard some of the parents say?"
Despondent, Harry sighed. There was no mercy in this place. He opened the newspaper, sulking. "Scorp?" He held out a hand. "Can I borrow a pencil?" This would be a boring Sunday, he supposed. He chewed on the end of the red pencil crayon Scorpius had graciously handed him and stared at the crossword puzzle that he was definitely not smart enough to complete. He didn't notice Draco glance up at him.
"What would you like to know?" Theo relished this more than he cared to admit. A whole new generation of Malfoys. Absolutely delightful.
As the door swung shut, Draco could hear his son saying, "Do you like kissing my dad, Harry?" followed by an exhausted groan from Harry and an emphatic shriek of disgust from Teddy.
"I haven't done anything..." Draco was close enough to Harry to smell the scent of musty books, see flecks of gold in those emerald irises, giddy with an overwhelming sense of
"I should be back to normal in a day," Harry said over everybody's excited chatter. "They're keeping me here to make sure it's healing properly." And, apparently, to be collected.
Harry shook his head, unsure what Draco was meaning to say. "What? What's 'all this'?" He didn't understand.
"He's quite mature for a twelve year old," Harry boasted. He thought of Teddy as his own son. He had basically brought up the child. He had helped Teddy when he stumbled over his feet. He had taught Teddy to read and write. In fact, Teddy was the reason Harry became a teacher. He was immensely proud of his godson. "He's pretty great."
His expression was both honest and resigned, making Harry's heart sink. "I see." He glanced away while trying to think of a sensitive way to approach this topic. "Will I get in trouble for being nice to you?"
one around here looking out for you! And this is the thanks I get?" He threw his arms up in the air, turned his nose up at Harry, and stomped out of sight.
Harry asked Gabrielle for a minute. She was surprised at the sight of Draco Malfoy, but didn't ask any questions. She nodded stiffly before walking out the classroom and closing the door behind her.
Teddy and Scorpius shrugged in well-practiced unison. Speckles of rainbow sugar were stuck around their cheeks and chin.
Harry didn't know what that meant. He sank into the kiss and the caress at his chin. It was fleeting, barely two breaths. Not enough time for him to figure out what it meant. As they pulled apart, he did see Draco's pale eyes flitting over his face and linger up by his forehead. Harry brushed his hair down to hide his scar. Draco's eyes snapped back down to meet Harry's. Harry quirked his brows and asked, "Better?"
"Simple?!" Either take a truth serum or let them dig around in his brain, that was the simple choice he had. "This is preposterous! It's borderline criminal to strong arm me like this!"
Patricia Hassleton had been Scorpius' au pair for the past five years, since he was a baby. A brunette in her forties with a soft shell, she adored her charge like her own son, despite him being nothing like the other children she had taken care of in the past. Until this year, she had been looking after him for the better part of the day. Now that she had the whole morning and afternoon to herself, she was still getting used to the routine of picking Scorpius up at three in the afternoon from school. "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry," she apologized as she reached down to hold his hand.
When the backdoor slammed shut, Harry set his empty mug on the table with finality and asked Draco, "Okay, what did I do?"
Harry wrenched the magazine open and hurriedly flipped to the middle where the feature spread was printed for all to see. There were many more pictures inside, three pages of them.
Truth was, yes, he did like Harry a lot. No, he shouldn't worry about what bullies think. What's the problem then? In Scorpius' mind, it was all so simply laid out.
He had ended up coming home much later than expected. He had found the house shrouded in darkness. It was just past eight. On a weekend, Scorpius' bedtime was anywhere between nine and sleep. He wouldn't go to bed without fussing for a little while. So, when Draco had found Scorpius and Harry asleep, evidently tuckered out after an active reading session, he had been pleasantly surprised. Scorpius was still recuperating and Draco had some more work to do before he could think about dinner. He was glad for the lack of interruption.
In contrast, Harry seemed to have it worse. The tabloids had been flush with opinions pieces, near-voyeuristic pictures, and confused uproar.
The dimly lit bedroom had previously been filled with quiet breathing and stifled snores. Now the sound of flapping wings and harried hoots was enough of a wake-up call despite it being an hour too early.
"It's exploding, isn't it?" Teddy laughed behind closed lips so his candy wouldn't fly out of it. He held out the bag of candy to Scorpius.
Turns out he had been worried about Scorpius for no reason at all. He shook his head to himself once the Malfoys had rounded the corner and disappeared from view. Trust him to jump to awful conclusions. He tiptoed back into the classroom to fill Gabrielle in on all the details.
. I do not want you to speak to Scorpius about his or your personal lives. I do not want you to treat him any differently than you would treat another child. Am I clear, Potter?"
"Protective," Harry repeated firmly, despite Draco's pointed side-eye. "I wanted to make sure he was alright with us before we came over. He assured me he was. Give him some time."
Their banter was interrupted when the fire whooshed unexpectedly, turning bright green and causing the children to fall backwards, away from the heat and light. Out stepped a rather sooty Hermione and Ron, practically tripping over Teddy and Scorpius in their excitement to get out of the fireplace. Scorpius coughed as he inhaled some of the black smoke while Teddy frantically swatted at his singed hair.
"Really?" Scorpius was fascinated. He thought that only happened in fairy tales. "With music and waltzing?"
"That's generally what investing is." Theo jerked his thumb at Draco. "He hordes his money, won't let anyone get a piece of it."
Harry narrowed his eyes. Whenever he was around Malfoy, he was put in a situation where he either had to fight or run, so, as a conditioned response, adrenaline was pumping through him. "I don't know what you are talking about," he said with as much calm as he could muster.
Draco carted his fingers through his son's soft hair. Scorpius had reduced that difficult conversation to such simple and decisive words. Was it really that easy? Draco couldn't believe it. "Scorpius?"
Harry was, quite frankly, terrified to leave the crying child alone with this man. But he really had no grounds to stay. He all but stumbled out the door. However, instead of closing it behind him, he stood with a hand over the doorknob, leaving the door slightly ajar so he could barge in if needed.
"Right." Harry had arrived at the manor in the evening to find the Malfoys in the same position he had left them - groggy in bed. And then Draco had forced himself awake and walked like a zombie to the study, mumbling about getting work done before the upcoming deadline in three days. Harry watched Draco write diligently. So serious. "I can hang out with Scorpius tomorrow if you want to go in. It's Saturday," he offered.
Time spent at the Malfoy Manor was not much of a secret to close friends in Harry's life. He didn't outright say that he wasn't able to join in on impromptu drinks because he had already promised an evening to the Malfoys, but he didn't try to hide the fact that he was teaching Scorpius how to fly or that he was occasionally invited to stay for dinner. It wasn't a topic that his friends broached. Harry returned the favour by not speaking of it either. Out of sight, out of mind. However, not a soul knew about time spent at 12 Grimmauld Place. Not a soul but Harry and Draco. As far as they were concerned, no one needed to know.
Hermione's fingers twisted into each other as her brows furrowed. "That's not all this is. If Teddy figured it out, it's not a huge leap for others to read between the lines." She kept her words level. "Now, putting aside that fact, the implications of this article are more widespread. You've been here before. You know what people will say. I know you don't mind losing friends, Harry, but you could be losing your future too. People will say you're fraternizing with Death Eaters. They'll say you're setting a bad example for your students. You could lose your job at school. I can't imagine what parents are going to think."
Harry stepped back and turned away while bringing the bottle of Port wine up, pretending to study it as Theo waltzed in with Scorpius in tow, because he would prefer to be in a spooky cellar with everybody else rather than in the huge manor all alone. "Yeah," the boy echoed loudly. "What's taking you two so long?"
After the tumble in the wine cellar last night, Draco had managed to herd Harry up the stairs towards one of the many guest bedrooms. "I'm fine," Harry had kept repeating while tripping over his own feet on the way down the long hallways of the mansion. "Bossy as always, Malfoy." Draco had rolled his eyes instead of responding. Then Harry had stopped, turned to face Draco and asked, "Hey. Can I say something?"
do something to warrant a time out. At least, he never would have. Harry slowed to a halt near the boy, unsure of what to say. Scorpius didn't notice until Harry cleared his throat. When Scorpius looked up and recognized who was standing beside him, a scowl drew across on his face. He turned away and faced the wall.
A small knot twisted in Draco's stomach. Now that Scorpius had started proper school, he had been invited over for many playdates and even a few sleepovers by his friends. That was all well and good. Patricia would handle it without a hitch. Draco didn't have to meddle one bit. However, what sane parent would send their child to a birthday party in the Malfoy Manor? This wasn't a two way street. "Don't you want to keep celebrating with your mother and me?"
Draco was sitting beside her, leaning his arm along the length of the back of the couch and his head rested on it, watching mother and son. His drowsy expression turned into an unpleasant frown when he realized that she was looking at him.
Draco's words were deliberate, as though he had been formulating them in his mind since that morning. "That's all this can be." He needed Harry to understand this more than anything.
"I don't know… Something." It's just that Scorpius was starting to like Harry because he was being so nice to him. Then maybe being nice wasn't as bad as he had thought.
He easily stepped up beside Draco, matching his stride as they blended into the evening crowd in the busy city. "Are you okay?"
He bolted upright in bed and snatched his wand from under the pillow. Thunder rolled outside but the hammering at his front door was deafening. He struggled out of his twisted sheets and jammed his glasses against his face before stumbling out of the dark bedroom and into the corridor, down the stairs and towards the foyer. The door was rattling in its hinges. He brought his wand up at the ready. Taking a moment to compose himself, he twitched the wand, throwing the door open.
that. Everyone keeps hiding it but I know. I know they're mad at you for liking me and my father and I know family's important to you and I
Harry and Gabrielle admired Scorpius' project. "My father helped me," he announced proudly to anyone who was listening. "He has nice writing. See?" He gestured at the swirling and elegant words that were written on the very top of the parchment. "He got me this, this, this, this and this," Scorpius added while pointing out the five leaves Draco had collected. "He got them from work for me."
He struggled up off the couch in a flash, letting out a gasp when his ribs protested. His vision started to fade and a wave of nausea crashed into him. He crumpled back into the seat while clutching his head. He had to remember. What had happened to him? How did he get here? He paused. Where was ‘here’? Frantically he swept his eye around the empty room where he blearily saw antique furniture and a dying fire in the ornate fireplace. Above the fireplace was an old portrait of two regal aristocrats dressed in ball gowns. They were blinking disdainfully down at him, painted lips pursed tight. Deep maroon velvet drapes hung down to the floor from windows lining one wall. A discolored rug lay under his feet, spanning the expanse of the large room. A cobwebbed chandelier hung above him, unlit. And a flicker of motion at the corner of his eye made him glance at the doorway where Harry Potter stood, appearing slightly taken aback.
Harry pretended not to notice Draco's gaze from the front gates of the school as he helped his students with their backpacks. He didn't stop Draco from taming his wild hair. When the perfect mug of tea was placed in his hands, he would mumble his thanks.
"Mhm." Harry had guessed as much. Malfoys always had an ulterior motive. Harry was used to ulterior motives. Soon after the war, he had made many 'friends' - people who needed help getting the right jobs and references, reporters wanting the exclusive scoop, those who rode his coattails. As far as he was concerned, it was par for the course. He didn't really care if the Malfoys used him to help themselves. What else was he supposed to do with all his unused persuasive powers?
"Harry doesn't treat me special." Scorpius shook his head to emphasize his point. "He's nice to everyone. Really. And maybe he didn't know
At some point, he remembered Draco stooping down over him and asking if he wanted supper. He must have answered no because the next thing he saw when he opened his eyes was darkness. The sun had set. He looked out the windows in some confusion before lifting his gaze up at Draco, who had woken him.
With a wave of his hand, Harry wandlessly unlatched the window, and it flew open from a gust of wind, freezing rain splattering into the bedroom, cooling the air almost instantly. Dramatic. He shut his eyes against the droplets.
"Because I'm sick, Harry," Scorpius explained again. He was the epitome of patience. "And it's still cold outside. I'll get more sick."
"I don't care if you tell him," Scorpius retorted. "And you don't have to pretend to like us anymore. We've gotten into enough trouble already."
Draco wiped some of the rivulets of sweat off of Scorpius' neck. "Will you look at me?" he asked. "Scorpius? Can you open your eyes and look at me?"
Harry pitched backwards, stumbled a step, and slipped spectacularly on ice, falling onto the snowy landing with a muffled thump. "Ow."
Harry sipped on the hot beverage with relish. "Sorry about yesterday," he apologized. The smell of coffee started to perk him up. "I don't drink very often." He got up to his feet gingerly, his head still swirling. "Did I do anything stupid?"
Scorpius wailed even louder and brought his balled fists down, repeatedly banging them against his knees. "I don't like you," he sobbed. "I'm hurt and you're being mean and you're supposed to be
Harry said, "I don't mind. I see so many people all day long, right? It's nice to be alone for a bit."
Harry poured a healthy cup for the both of them and then lined up two pieces of bread on each plate.He gestured for Scorpius to hop up onto the bench at the dining table. Scorpius narrowed his eyes at the empty slices of bread. Maybe Harry didn't know how to make sandwiches…
Luna finally brought the binoculars down. There were circular imprints around her unblinking eyes where the eyepieces had pressed into her fair skin. She cocked her head knowingly at Harry, then tucked an errant hair behind her ear. "So, you see why I can't help you," she said as she pulled herself out of the swamp, her galoshes squishing in the mud when she stepped onto firmer grass. "Who am I to stand in the way of love?"
Harry clicked his tongue and grabbed the pile of cards off the table, much to Scorpius and Teddy's glee. "How did you know?" he grumbled at Draco.
The next day, Scorpius and Teddy were huddled close to the fire, examining their pieces of parchment carefully. Teddy had bought trick parchment at George's shop. When you look at it with a plain eye, it appeared blank. But if you held it close to fire and waited for ten seconds before studying the parchment again, you would see scrolling green letters that told a secret. Teddy and Scorpius had nearly burnt the parchments twice already and they still couldn't find any writing.
Harry laughed at Scorpius' enthusiastic answer. He had a feeling that, despite Draco's tough looks, he would cave to Scorpius' ask in a few years yet, malaria or not. "You and Astoria are quite the jet-setters, it seems," Harry told Theo.
"No, help me understand," Ron interrupted. "Until I know what it is, I won't ever be on your side in this situation."
Draco didn't find any of this amusing and he turned away. Harry walked over to the full length mirror at the end of the closet to inspect his attire. He fixed his shirt while peeking in the reflection at Draco rummaging through a drawer angrily. Yes, he had been cheeky with that question. Eliciting any reaction out of Draco was a pleasure, but a scowl was especially sweet. There was some truth in the joke. What did Draco think of all this? That's what Harry wanted to know. Getting a straight answer about their relationship was like pulling teeth. Harry quickly looked away when Draco shut the drawer with a loud snap and stomped towards him, scowl still in place.
