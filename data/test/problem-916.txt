Mystery woman? Harry thought. Well, this was unexpected, he for sure thought this was going to be about Draco.
Professor McGonagall pursed her lips. “I will be mentoring Bill Weasley to take over Head of House should he make it passed the year.” She gave Ron an apologetic smile after he winced. “However, Professor Dumbledores Portrait has assured me the curse should be broken now. Any other questions?”
"Since getting sent to Azkaban? No." Narcissa’s tone was harsh. "I am hoping this time away from him will help Draco come into his own; the rebuilding of the school seems to be helping."
"Malfoy," He said, returning the nod and then looking him up and down. He was wearing a velvet suit similar to the one Harry was holding in his now clammy hands, but he was in black. His white-blonde hair was how he had last remembered it to be, and his face as pale and pointed as ever, so why did Harry feel his heart thumping hard in his chest?
The morning had come quickly, the next day as Harry laid lazily in bed, he had such a good night last night, he couldn't believe being married to Draco Malfoy, would feel so incredible. Harry had always secretly felt a flutter in his belly whenever he had seen Draco in school, but obviously, he couldn't act on it, he was cruel to Harry, but now he is charming, caring and a little OCD.
Draco dug his fingers into Harry's arse cheeks and thrust up hard in a continuous rhythm moaning and grunting with Harry.
The next few days were crazy for Harry and Draco they had been all over the Daily prophet following the capture of Theodore Nott. Draco wasn't referred to as an Ex -death eater but a hero who saved the chosen one's life.
Harry groaned the moment the sensation hit the pit of his stomach. It felt like someone had reached in, grabbed hold of his cock and tugged. The need to bury himself inside of something—a hand, a mouth, whatever—fought through him and he struggled with the button of his trousers. He yanked on the zipper and let them drop to his ankles. A small mound of dark hair curled around his dick.
Ginny bent down and picked up a half-empty bottle of firewhisky. "Didn't you drink enough at Seamus's last night?" She asked sternly.
He knocked on the door and waited to be called in. He didn't wait long and turned the gold handle and pushed open the door, where Robards was sat at his desk surrounded by a mountain of paperwork. Harry sympathised.
A tiny bottle flew towards him, and he grabbed it skilfully. He passed the mirror again and stared into it, smiling when he saw Harry smiling back at him.
Draco tried to cover his smirk as he sat at the dining room table in complete silence with Harry by his side. It was just like it used to be when they had meals together, complete silence except for the occasionally coughing and knives and forks hitting the plates. Draco had poured the decanted wine into his recently emptied glass and watched everyone as their eyes flickered at each other.
"Well I am sorry," Harry said. "I promise you I am going to be around you so much you will be begging me to go away."
"We had drunken a lot by the time he had started having a proper conversation, then we argued, there was a privacy spell around the booth so no one could hear us screaming at each other, then suddenly we weren't anymore."
"Just for a walk," He lied. "Needed a break from everyone, I had five marriage proposals today, and first and second years asking for autographs."
Harry watched him slither around near Fred and George's feet in his sitting room, they had been bugging him and asked him pointless questions about when he participated in the Triwizard tournament. It wasn't the best year of his life, especially when he had seen Cedric Diggory die and Voldemort return.
"We did tell you, mate, it was when Fred and George came round, and they made their famous pasta dish," Ron said as if that would jog his memory as Fred and George always made their pasta dish when they came round.
“Correct, Miss Granger,” Bill said with a smile. “Since this potion is actually well beyond N.E.W.T level, please take ten very well-earned points for Gryffindor.”
“Next two months, actually,” Damien answered, “but that was a small sacrifice.  Goyle’s Bludger wasn’t even meant for Malfoy though.  He was supposed to hit Potter, but I guess he got confused and hit it at Malfoy instead.”
“This is the Temple District, Draco,” Asheera confirmed.  “Most Atlantean cities don’t have this many temples, but as the capital city, not to mention the largest city, Atlantia has a temple to every God and Goddess of the Olympian pantheon.”
“If it can’t the Atlantean armory can provide all the suits you need,” Asheera said.  “King Erevan may not be able to commit Atlantean troops in the war, but I’m sure he’ll be more then happy to help in any other way that he can.”
Silence filled the room for several minutes before Harry finally found his voice and asked, "Why are we doing this now?"
Kissing his way back across Oliver's chest, Matt placed a second kiss on the right nipple, again swirling his tongue around on it, as Oliver let out a moan to indicate that he was thoroughly enjoying himself. After a few more minutes of going back and forth, Matt continued to kiss his way down, pausing to kiss and lick the muscles of Oliver's six-pack abs. Oliver continued to moan as Matt moved further down, kissing and licking his way down Oliver's right thigh, deciding to ignore his raging cock for the moment.
At this point, Hannah started to hug Cedric again and started to kiss him all over his face, prompting him to groan and say, “Mum, I’m happy to be back, but please stop it, you’re embarrassing me.”
“Well, you don’t have to worry about Fleur. Obviously, she’s left you pretty much alone since the tests said you weren’t her mate, but she’s found him now, so you don’t have to worry anymore.”
“Well, within reason,” clarified Rowena.  “For example the castle will not inform him about every conversation that takes place within its walls.  He also doesn’t know what every single person is doing at every single second of the day, but the castle will give him a general idea of what’s been happening.  So, you may notice that he asks questions and while he may present the façade of already knowing the answers, in truth, he probably doesn’t, because the castle has only told him so much and he still needs to fill in the blanks.”
“As interesting as all this is,” Poppy said, “I’m afraid you’ll both have to leave.  Mr. Malfoy needs his rest.”
“Of course,” Asheera said as she watched Severus and Pomfrey working feverishly.  “That is as it should be, Professor Snape.  At any rate, I shall help in any way that I can.”
“Yeah, it does,” confirmed Matt.  “I guess King Erevan and Queen Calliara are going to personally give them the grand tour of the kingdom.”
“Don’t worry, son,” Hannah said.  “We’ll take you to Ollivander’s and buy you a new wand.  Oh, Merlin, I’m just so happy to have you back!”
“I realize that, Mr. Pucey,” Snape drawled.  “However, I am a professor, as well as your Head of House.  In this house, what I say goes, and I say that you will not be kicking them off the team.  They’re four of Slytherin’s best players.  Getting rid of them will kill Slytherin’s chances of winning the Quidditch Cup back from Gryffindor.”
Silence filled the Great Hall, as everyone with subscriptions to the Daily Prophet eagerly read the front page article.  The students that did not have subscriptions were reading over their friends’ shoulders.
“My, my, this place really does need cleaning, doesn’t it?”  Helga asked as she looked around.  “I can scarcely believe that it’s really been so long, but Rowena tells me that it’s been over a thousand years since we died.”
Fourth-year Gryffindor Romilda Vane asked, “Aren’t you going to do anything to Harry for attacking Colin, Professor Weasley?”
A light bulb went on in Aarik’s head when Draco said that and said, “Draco, are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
Colin nodded and asked, “Do I need to tell the others?” referring, of course, to all the other members of his now disbanded Photography Club, who had helped sell information and photographs to the Daily Prophet.
“Behind you, my boys,” the voice, a female, said.  “No need to be alarmed.  I couldn’t harm you even if I wanted to.”
“True,” Harry agreed.  “I’ve become good friends with Draco though and I figure I’ll be spending a fair amount of time with you because of that.  I’ll probably let Draco call me Aarik, so I might as well let you do it as well.”
“Early? Harry, it’s almost eleven o’clock in the morning,” Hermione admonished. “Professor McGonagall will be here in about five minutes to help the sixth years with their schedules.”
“Legal guardian?”  Draco asked, as he looked between Matt and Madam Pomfrey, obviously confused.  “I thought your father was my legal guardian?”
“Well, we’d better get a move on,” Kevin said as he looked at the clock on the wall.  “It’s nearly noon and the carriages to Hogsmeade leave in an hour.  I want to get down to the Great Hall and eat something before the train ride, because after Christmas shopping, I’m a bit low on cash, so I don’t think I’ll be able to get anything off the trolley.”
“Well, if your sexual prowess is even half as good as your skill with your tongue, then I know I will love every second when we do take our relationship to the next level.”
‘Hmm, as much as it pains me to say, Dumbledore has actually had a good idea.’ Pansy thought. ‘I’ll look so good on Draco’s arm.  I’ll dress up in my best dress, fix up my hair, and I’ll wear some of that special perfume I bought in Paris over the summer. He keeps claiming that he’s gay, but I know he’s just playing hard to get. We’re destined to be together and I intend to make sure we are.’
Draco nodded, before he stood up and followed Ryan, Nicolas, and Harry out of the hospital wing.  The four of them all had fencing class this morning and they all walked silently outside to the edge of the lake where Professor Lasinius had told the class to meet him.
“Not at all, Mr. Laitannen,” the secretary said.  “We are at war, in case you didn’t know.  We don’t take kindly to people entering the Ministry with unknown wands.  It raises serious questions about what they intend to do with them.  The biggest fear being that they may intend to assassinate the Minister.”
“While your willing compliance is not necessary, it is good that you realize who holds the power here in the Hells,” Asmodeus said. “However, that does not change the fact that you have allowed a devil of your realm to escape and set in motion a plan to unseat me. Such an act cannot go unpunished, even if committed in ignorance or by oversight. As punishment, I order that sixty percent of the souls bound for Phlegethos for the next 191 years be diverted here to Nessus to serve me instead of you.”
“I really do like you, Draco,” Harry said as he pulled away.  “I would not venture so far as to say I’m in love with you, as we’ve been bitter enemies for years now and I’m only just beginning to get to know the real you.  Though, I must say that the more I get to know the real Draco, and not the stuck-up prick you were in years past, I can honestly say that there is a very real possibility that I could fall in love with you.”
‘Hmm, I wonder what Justin would think about going together,’ Ryan thought from his seat at the Ravenclaw table.  ‘I know that he’s out to his housemates in his year, but I’m not sure if he’s ready to be out to the whole school.  For that matter, I’m not sure I am, even if it is accepted.’
The next morning, Charles had the day off from work and decided to stay home and keep Draco company while Matt and Oliver took Ryan shopping on Diagon Alley. Draco was understandably not in the mood to go shopping, considering the very recent death of his mother. So, Charles wrote a note to the goblins at Gringott's telling them that he was now Draco's legal guardian and to allow Matt to collect some money from Draco's vault. So with the note, Draco's supply list and his vault key in hand, Matthew and Oliver flooed over to Diagon Alley with Ryan. Matthew and Oliver both have apparition licenses, but the wards surrounding Cromwell Hall only allow for Charles to apparate through them, so the floo was quicker in the long run than walking out to the edge of the wards, especially since Ryan can't apparate yet.
“I think you’re overreacting, but fine, check away,” Harry said as he laid his copy of Advanced Potion-Making in front of Hermione.
Justin looked at Corelian and noticed the look on his face, which led him to believe that Corelian already knew who all the heirs were, a fact which he soon voiced.
I’m truly happy to finally have something of my mother’s.  While it is true that I have her eyes, it’s nice to have something tangible that I can actually touch.  I’ve had my dad’s Invisibility Cloak since first year and the Marauder’s Map since third, but I’ve never had anything of mum’s.  Hermione said that I should go talk to Professor Flitwick though and ask him if I can keep the book, lest he remember loaning it and then take points away from Gryffindor for not returning it.  I don’t have Charms again until second period on Thursday afternoon, but Hermione said I should probably ask before that if the opportunity arises.
“Lena, you’re embarrassing me,” Brendan said.  “Of course, I’m not the only one who could be a bit vain when they wanted to be, now am I?  I remember when you got your first gray hair, the way you were carrying on it’s as if the world was going to blow up any second.”
“You have failed me,” he said. “During the attack on Inverness, I set you a very simple task. You were to stay at Malfoy Manor and guard the prisoner in the dungeons. And now I find out that my prisoner has escaped and was replaced with Wormtail! You will all pay for your failure!”
"You do this school proud," Dumbledore said, his eyes twinkling madly.  "If we are to survive this dark time, the members of all the houses must lay to rest all of the old rivalries and unite.  I am pleased that the two of you have already begun that most vital of tasks.  Now, I bid you all good day,” and looking at Professor Byrne, Ryan, and Nicolas, he continued, “and I look forward to seeing you three back here on September the First."
‘Good,’ Harry thought. ‘I think it’s time I pay a little visit to my good friend Bill and see why he didn’t bother telling me about his new job.’
Adrian walked over to the large wardrobe in the corner of the room, opened it, and then pulled a potion vial from a rack on one of the shelves.
“We know what you did, Godric,” Rowena said, her voice lowering to her normal tone, but with a dangerous edge to it.  “We know that you amended the Sorting Hat’s memories so that it would lie about Salazar.”
“Aarik, is that any way to talk about your boyfriend?”  Lily asked.  “Calling him the Slytherin Ice Prince?”
“Your wand is made of Atlantean Spruce, Ryan,” Corelian said, “as for the core element it contains the tail feather of a roc, which was soaked overnight in my blood.”
“I’m afraid it’s not that simple,” Asheera said.  “The wands that Mr. Ollivander makes work very well for humans.  Atlantean blood, however, is a highly concentrated magical substance, so powerful in fact, that human wand makers can’t make wands that will work for an Atlantean, due to a conflict between our blood and the wand’s core element.”
Turning once again to the pile of boxes,  Ollivander scanned his eyes over the boxes and more than once reached for a box, before changing his mind and whispering, "No, not that one," to himself.  Continuing to peruse the selection he'd brought, Ollivander said, "No, definitely not," before finally, "Hmm, perhaps this one?"  as he grabbed a box and removed a wand from within.
"Okay, then, see you in awhile, Ry," Oliver said with a smile as he walked off with Matt, the two of them holding hands.
‘Oh great, a dance,’ Harry thought.  ‘Just what I need: another opportunity to look like an idiot.  I need dancing lessons, just in case I actually manage to find a date.  With what I now know, I guess I could even ask a guy to be my date and nobody would think anything of it.  Not like I have many prospects in that department though.’
“It appears as though he’s been hit by two Dark curses,” Severus said.  “The Discrucio curse and the Eviscero curse.”
“We plan to,” Albus said.  “The week after Christmas the members of the Circle of Atlantis are coming to Hogwarts to help strengthen the wards.”
“The number one rule?”  Draco asked.  “You’re going to hate it.  Rule #1 of the Malfoy Code of Conduct states that pure-bloods are better than everyone else.  On a similar tract, Rule #24 states that Malfoys are like royalty among the pure-blooded families and are in fact better than all other pure-bloods.  Complete and utter nonsense, yes, but there’s not much I can do about the lunacy of my ancestors.”
After two dances, Harry and Hermione stepped off the dance floor and took a seat at one of the empty tables.
Adrian could see that this situation had the potential to get out of control at any minute, so he decided it was time for an even more drastic measure than the Virginitas charm.
“We haven’t really talked about it,” Matthew said, “but, yes, I think I’d like to have children at some point.  What about you, Oliver?”
“I do not claim anything,” Corelian answered.  “I am merely stating a fact.  As for how old I am, I’m 296.”
Madam Hooch paused for a moment, and then added, “There has been some concern that some students in this school might send word to the Death Eaters about the scheduling change.  The Headmaster and I sincerely hope that no student would ever do such a thing, but we aren’t taking any chances.  Until today’s game is over, all of the Floos and all outgoing owls will be being monitored.  If any student is caught telling any outside source, even if it isn’t a Death Eater, about the scheduling change, they will receive detention with Mr. Filch every night for the rest of the term and 500 points will be taken from their house.  That is all, thank you, and I will see you at the pitch this evening.”
“Because it was you,” Blaise answered.  “Draco said your name when he came.  I talked to him afterward and he admitted that he likes you.”
“Well, you’re a good friend,” Harry said, “so, I’m going to tell you this but it can’t leave this room.  I also found out that my name isn’t really Harry.  Turns out it’s just a nickname born from a misunderstanding on Hagrid’s part.  My name is actually Aarik.”
“Oh I wish I could be there to see the look on Scrimgeour’s face when he’s forced to eat crow,” Draco said.  “From what I’ve heard, he doesn’t like surprises or being wrong.  I’m sure he’ll be more then a little peeved to find out he was wrong.”
“Well, Valen and I only friends,” Bill said.  “So, I’m not going to hold it against him that he ran out of here but I just wonder why he took Ryan and Justin with him.”
“Nothings wrong, per se,” Hermione said.  “It’s just odd watching you interact with your parents.  You’re sixteen and your parents aren’t much older, Aarik, it’s a weird-looking sight, is all.”
“You’re right, Harry, I do,” Hermione said.  “He’s just being a total jerk right now and he pushed me to breaking up with him.  He’ll come around eventually I’m sure and then we can perhaps pick up where we left off, but for now, we’re not an item.”
“So, I suppose I’ll have to have guest quarters setup for you two?”  Dumbledore asked, as he looked at Corelian and Asheera.
"Hello," Charles called as they approached.  "I'm Charles Cromwell, and this is my nephew, Ryan.  You are?"
"Wake up, you miserable, ungrateful little toad!"  Lucius Malfoy shouted as he barged into his son's bedroom the following morning.
“Unless they’re seventeen,” Nick said. “Then it’s perfectly okay, seeing as we’re both consenting adults.”
Justin blushed and Ryan grinned as he leaned over and nibbled Justin’s ear, “I love it when you blush.”
“I couldn’t help but notice that Nearly Headless Nick has been spending an inordinate amount of time around the Slytherin table lately. What’s up with that?”
Well, another day in paradise has dawned. I'm loving every minute of being in Martinique, but I'm also well aware that each passing minute brings me that much closer to having to return to Malfoy Manor. Thankfully, school will be starting soon and I won't have to deal with Father very much. It's probably too much to ask that he not get back from his business trip until after I've gone off to school.
“Well, I was asked by an interested party to check on Ryan and make sure that he was being well taken care of.  I’m happy to say that I was able to give a glowing report because William and Lucinda Cromwell did a very good job with him.”
Corelian pulled back his long blond hair and held it back, revealing that he was wearing a silver stud earring in both ears.  Each earring had two silver chains attached that looped up to connect to silver ear cuff.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Rowena said before noticing their expressions and asked, “Is there something wrong with them?”
A bit startled by the sudden voice, Ryan saw his dorm mate, Kevin Entwhistle, and said, “Oh, hi Kevin.  Yes, I’m missing a book.”
Thankfully, Harry was on the other side of the shop with some of the other students, so he was out of earshot and didn’t hear this conversation.
Arriving in Dumbledore’s office, Dumbledore took a seat behind his desk and conjured chairs for his guests.  He was still a little too shell-shocked by their unexpected appearance to make the normal offer of tea or lemon drops.
Motioning towards the last cauldron on the table, which was full of a thick, black tar-like substance, Bill asked, “Now, can anyone tell me what this is?”
“What did you challenge Death for?”  Aarik asked.  The concern when Draco said he had risked his life was evident on his face, but he was doing as Draco had asked and saving his concern for later, as hard as that may have been.
“I took the job because Dumbledore needed a Potions teacher and I wanted a bit of a change of pace. As for why I didn’t tell you, Dumbledore asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn’t.”
“Liar!”  Tom yelled.  “I saw you in his arms!  I saw you!  So don’t stand there and deny it, Zacharias!”
“I suggest you see if Colin can get in without you saying anything,” Nick said.  “The founders said that once you give someone permission, they won’t be able to open the door, but they will be able to enter anytime the entrance is open until you rescind the permission.”
"Now, I'm sure all of you are probably getting tired and want to be getting back to your dormitories for the evening. Before you all go, however, I have two more staffing additions to announce. Hogwarts did at one time offer these two classes, but they have not been offered in many years. It is with great pleasure that I announce the return of Art and Music classes, which will be extra-curricular activities, open to students in all years. These classes shall be taught by two recent Hogwarts graduates, who some of you will very likely remember, as they just graduated two years ago. Teaching the Art classes is a former Gryffindor who is on loan to us from Puddlemere United's reserve team, Professor Wood and filling the position of Music teacher, is a former Ravenclaw, Professor Cromwell."
“Ron would say dislike is an understatement.  He’d say he hates him.  Malfoy has gotten Hermione, Ron, and I into so much trouble over the years and done everything he can to make our lives a living hell.  So, Ron’s hatred of him isn’t totally unfounded.  Hermione hates the fact that Malfoy calls her a Mudblood every chance he gets.”
“Yes, Ginny, there is,” Harry responded, as he relayed the information that had recently become known about Voldemort and Tom Riddle.
“Nope,” Aarik answered his mother.  “Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were not exactly happy to be stuck taking care of me, so they never gave me anything that Dudley hadn’t outgrown or broke.”
Aarik and Draco’s kiss was interrupted when Aarik felt a hand on his shoulder.  Aarik turned his head and saw his mother, who was looking at him intently.
“You won’t get any argument from me, Draco,” Narcissa said, as she along with many other people in the room, grimaced.
The four prefects did as Ryan asked and followed Harry and him through the door into Rowena’s quarters, as the door closed behind them.  Motioning towards the fireplace, Ryan said, “May I introduce, my however many times great-grandmother, Rowena Ravenclaw.”
One of the reasons that Rowena Ravenclaw was so intelligent, was because she was very observant and noticing a look on Hermione’s face, she asked, “Is there something on your mind, Hermione, dear?”
The students stared in wonder at the collection of armor and weapons on display, as their two Professors walked silently down the hall to the large doors at the other end.  Reaching the doors, Dumbledore and Pomfrey turned to the students behind them and Dumbledore said, “Eat, drink, dance, and be afraid, be very afraid.”
Corelian nodded and said, “Yes, Ryan, that’s exactly right.  The soul-bonding will insure that neither of you has to spend a single second alive without the other.  It will not take into consideration the fact that you may have young children who depend on you.  If the scenario I’ve mentioned played out and Oliver broke his neck in a Quidditch accident and died, you would die instantly Matthew.  You could be in the middle of feeding your newborn baby a bottle and you would drop dead, leaving him or her helpless and unprotected.”
"Because he was arrested after using the Killing curse on Narcissa," Dumbledore said as he entered the room.
Tom’s screams only made Voldemort laugh harder and he held the curse for two or three minutes, before he bored and walked out of the room, cackling evilly.  As usual, a house-elf soon came into the room and began to clean and dress Tom’s wounds.  Even after so many years of torture, Tom had very few physical scars to suggest that he’d been tortured, as the house-elf always treated them with magic almost as soon as they were sustained.
“Similar to human weddings,” Corelian said as he held out both of his hands, “there are rings involved.  Although, humans usually only wear a ring on the third finger of the left hand, whereas Atlanteans wear a ring on the third finger of both.”
Ravenclaw’s heir, Ryan Cole Cromwell, 16, is the grandson of the late Auror Lucinda Elizabeth Malfoy Cromwell, whom he lived with in Asheville, North Carolina, United States, where he attended the Asheville Academy of the Arcane, until her death this past summer.  Ryan then returned to the Cromwell ancestral home in Yorkshire, England to live with his uncle, Auror Charles Matthew Cromwell, and transferred to Hogwarts where he was sorted into Ravenclaw house during a private sorting ceremony in the Headmaster’s office before the school year began.
“I’m sorry Corelian couldn’t make it,” Asheera said.  “He was busy talking to Erevan about some important matters of state when Helga came, so I didn’t want to bother him.”
After a few words with Alexandra Kirkwood, Matthew and Oliver proceeded down to Charles’ cubicle.  The walls of the cubicle were covered in newspaper clippings and pictures about Dark wizards and other people that the Aurors were working on tracking down.  There were, however, a number of personal items as well, including several family photographs.
“So you chose to go back to Atlantis?”  Ryan asked.  “Why?  I wouldn’t have cared if you didn’t have your powers.  I would just have been glad to have you around.”
“It’s okay, I brought it up,” Aarik said.  “So, do you even have a guess as to how much money you have in your vault?”
He soon realized that Bill liked to go for a two-hour run around the grounds in the mornings and it was then that he decided it would be a good idea to go for a run himself and make sure that he “accidentally” ran into Bill.  He hoped that Bill would then invite him to join him and that perhaps it would go well enough that they could start running together every morning.  Nick wasn’t usually an early riser and doing this would mean waking up at like five in the morning, but if it brought him closer to Bill, he was more than willing to deal with it.
Deciding to take a chance that the previous owner was right, Harry reached over and borrowed Malfoy’s abandoned silver dagger and crushed the bean with the flat side of it.  Almost instantly, a large amount of juice came out of the bean and Harry realized that maybe it wasn’t such a bad thing that the previous owner had felt it necessary to correct Libatius Borage’s instructions.  Adding the sopophorous juice to the potion, Harry was pleased to see it immediately turn the exact shade of lilac described by the textbook.
“Moving back to the topic of the Circle,” Corelian said, “there is one other member of the Circle here; my beautiful wife, Lady Asheera, who is Mistress of the Sphere of Life.”
“Well, you now have the name of one of Salazar’s living heirs,” Rowena commented.  “Perhaps if you do a little research on Ariana you’ll be able to figure out who the student heir is.  At any rate, what about Hufflepuff and Gryffindor, any clues?”
Among the escaped was Lucius Malfoy, who was only just recaptured a few days ago after he was arrested for using the Killing Curse on his wife, Narcissa Black Malfoy, and for using the Cruciatus Curse, on their son, Draco Malfoy.  In addition to Mr. Malfoy, fifteen other known Death Eaters were aboard the vessel and all of them are now unaccounted for.
“Thank you.  That means a lot coming from you, considering how my father treated you.  I tried to get him to change his mind considering that you are family, but you knew my father.  Once he made up his mind, there was no changing it.”
Aarik must have really liked Draco’s answer, as the blond soon found himself being kissed more passionately then he had ever been kissed in his life, not that he was about to complain.  Speaking of complaints, McGonagall would normally have had something to say about such a public display of affection between two students, but considering the circumstances, she remained quiet.
Kneeling between Oliver's legs, Matt smiled at him for a moment, before he leaned down and began to kiss Oliver's ever-hardening member through the material that was covering it. As Matt did this, Oliver pointed his wand at the bedroom doors and mumbled a locking charm, followed by a silencing charm. He certainly didn't want to give Ryan anymore ammunition to embarrass them with, not to mention the fact that he did not relish the thought of Professor Snape overhearing them.
"I am not disputing that fact, Severus," Charles said. "However, the Ministry has granted me custody of Draco until he reaches his age of majority."
“True,” Corelian said.  “However, according to the ancient texts in Atlantis, Hera ranked below Poseidon and Hades in power.  The three most powerful Olympians were Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, in that order.  Their wives were each a match for their husbands in power, but could be beaten by the other two.  So, while Hera could hold her own against Zeus, she was not strong enough to stand against Poseidon or Hades.  I know that may seem strange, but the priests think it had to do with the bonds of an Olympian marriage.  When Olympians married, it equalized them in power, thus making Hera a match for Zeus, Amphitrite a match for Poseidon, and Persephone a match for Hades.”
“Tom, I swear by Merlin’s beard that I am not lying!”  Zach said.  “I have never lied to you, ever!  This really is Cedric and he really was dead and gone before today.  Lady Asheera helped Draco go to Tartarus and challenge the Lord of the Dead for the souls of four people.  Cedric is one of the people that Draco chose to bring back, along with his mum and Aarik’s parents, James and Lily Potter.  Ask Professor Dumbledore if you do not believe me!  As unbelievable as it may seem, he will confirm that I am telling you the truth.  And I know that you are smart enough to know that no seventeen-year-old wizard like me could use any magical trickery to make Dumbledore say something is true when it isn’t.”
“Um, no, not really,” answered Ryan.  “Well, it looks like a ‘Z’ and then what could be either an ‘A’ or an ‘E’, I can’t really be sure.”
"Good, good," Ollivander said, as he handed the goblet back to Narcissa, who sipped some of its contents herself, before allowing Lily, Dumbledore, and James to sample her handiwork - all of whom agreed it was delicious.  "Now, gentleman, please present your wand arms."
“Oh, I forgot to mention that,” Corelian said.  “While the jewelry may look like it is made of silver, it’s actually made primarily of mythril.  Mythril a rare metal, but it’s abundant in Atlantis.  It looks like silver, but it’s also indestructible and feather-light.  For the wedding jewelry though a combination of mythril and orichalcum is used, because alone mythril is resistant to magic.  Orichalcum looks like gold in color, but it is inferior in value.  We charm it to look silver and put a layer of it under the mythril when the jewelry is crafted.  Without the orichalcum layer, the jewelry would resist the spells cast on it during the ceremony.”
“A magic filter,” Queen Calliara answered.  “It allows only the water and this lift to pass through it.  Prepare for a breathtaking sight.  We’re almost there.”
Later that afternoon in the sixth-year Ravenclaw boys’ dorm, Ryan was at a loss.  He had come up to his room to get his Charms book from his trunk and when he did, he realized that the small book of invisibility charms that his grandmother had given him was missing.  He searched through his trunk, twice, and was unable to find it.  Not understanding what could have happened, he quickly checked the small shelf above the headboard of his four-poster with no luck, before searching through the drawer of his bedside table, again, with no luck.
So, I asked Blaise to be my date for the Ball.  Seeing as how he didn’t know whom else to go with himself, he accepted.  We’re going to go into Hogsmeade together tomorrow to shop for some new dress robes.  Even though some people would probably say that neither of us really needs any more clothes, Blaise and I both believe that one can never have too many outfits.  Especially considering that we’re wizards and we can always magically expand the size of our cupboards as needed or shrink outfits we don’t wear very often so they take up less space.  Honestly, I really don’t understand how the Muggles survive without magic.
“Well, your wand is ten inches,” Asheera said, “but it is not oak and it does not contain a dragon heartstring.”
“Correct Minerva,” Corelian answered.  “Persephone is an interesting case actually, because Amphitrite was a Nereid, so Persephone’s elevation to Queen of Tartarus is the only example of a second-generation Olympian becoming more powerful than a first-generation Olympian.  After marrying Hades, Persephone out-powered both her mother and her Aunt Hestia.”
“Yeah,” Matt answered.  “Corelian is working on getting himself named guardian.  Unfortunately, he’s run into a bit of a problem.”
"The only reason he doesn't kill all the Death Eaters himself to increase his power, is because if he did, there'd be nothing binding him to this plane,"  McGonagall explained.  "The second he revealed his true nature, Asmodeus would have found out that he was on Earth and would have attempted to force him to return.  Bound to over two thousand living mortals, however, that's impossible because it's against cosmic law for devils to force living beings who were not born in the Hells to go there."
“No, Justin,” Asheera said with a smile, “not a rock spelled R-O-C-K.  Corelian was referring to a roc, spelled R-O-C.  It’s a very large hawk-like bird, comparable in size to a dragon.  It has two heads and is capable of picking up an elephant in its claws to feed to its young.”
“Oh,” Blaise said.  “Couldn’t get a date?  I’d imagine you having to beat the girls off with a stick.”
“I demand that you stop saying that and do what we both know you want to do and ask me to the dance!”
“Yes, well, the truth is, Ryan,” Corelian said, “that you did indeed go to Mr. Ollivander’s shop to buy a wand and if you remember correctly, you tried several that did not work, before finally Mr. Ollivander produced a wand that did.  It is the only wand that Mr. Ollivander has ever sold that he did not make himself.”
Oh well, I should get going.  The ball starts in ten minutes and I’m sure Hermione is starting to get impatient, wondering what’s taking me so long.
“Same here,” Blaise said as he held a black robe with green and silver accents in front of him and looked at it in the mirror.  “What do you think, Drake?”
"I'd like that, Ryan," Nicolas replied with a smile as McGonagall lifted the Sorting Hat from his head.  "Please call me Nick.  That's what all of my friends in France used to call me."
Everyone laughed at Draco’s comment and the six students settled into a companionable conversation as they continued to eat breakfast.  Rowena spent quite a bit of time watching them from her frame, happy that she had at last been found and was no longer having to spend her time alone.  She was also looking forward to the day when the other quarters were found, as she then would be able to visit and talk with her old friends and fellow founders.
“I’m sure Professor Weasley will have a book you can borrow and that he’ll allow you to use the school ingredients until you can get your own. Now, did you want to take any of the new electives?”
“What evidence to the contrary?”  Pansy asked.  “I haven’t seen any evidence to the contrary.  The only thing I’ve seen is Draco playing hard to get by trying to make me think that he’s gay, which I know he isn’t.”
“From the Sorting Hat,” Harry answered.  “It’s mentioned several times in it’s songs that Salazar thought Hogwarts should only accept purebloods and that when the other founders refused to see his way he got mad and left the school.”
“It gets worse, Albus,” Snape said.  “Once everyone was there, he called up the nine Death Eaters he’d left behind to guard Riddle and called them out for their failure.  I think he was going to use the Cruciatus on them, but then he snapped his wand.”
“GODRIC BRYANT GRYFFINDOR!”  Rowena yelled.  “You are so lucky that I am only a portrait now and am incapable of performing magic, because if I could I would hex you into the next galaxy!”
“You’re wrong, Ron,” Harry said.  “I’m not under a spell and I did just offer my friendship to Draco.”
Harry was probably better then he had been at the Yule Ball, but he was sure that he was still bad enough that he’d look like an idiot at the ball without help.
By the time that Hermione returned to the Gryffindor common room, it was nearly empty.  Harry, who was asleep in one of cushy red armchairs, was the only person left in the room.  Hermione knew that Ron would be upstairs in his dorm, having retired early rather than spend time with Harry.  Ever since last week, when Harry had announced his intention to be friends with Draco, Ron had barely spoken two words to him.
“Trust me, Potter, I thank the Gods every day that I was born a wizard.  Of course, then again there are times when I wish I wasn’t, or more accurately, that my sire wasn’t.”
“Hmm,” said Phineas Nigellus, who was actually in his portrait for once.  “You should do something about that Albus.”
Madam Pomfrey screamed in frustration, before she pointed her wand at her throat, said, “Sonorus!” and then yelled loud enough to be heard throughout the castle, “Will someone please come to the hospital wing and get rid of Peeves?”
Looking up at the imposing edifice before him, Draco couldn't help but shudder.  He had never liked coming to the mausoleum, but then what six-year-old would?  Lucius walked up the stone steps and cast the necessary charm to unlock and open the massive stone doors.  The torches lit by themselves as Lucius and Draco walked in, revealing a large and ornate room.  Straight ahead, were two life-size, gold statues of Armand and Angelique Malfoy standing atop black marble pedestals, and at the foot, rested their matching gold sarcophaguses.
Draco snorted. "With all due respect Minister, the only way this will get out is if it was leaked to the daily prophet, they will spin their story, and put doubt in their heads about the way you have run your Auror department. If you fire Ron and Harry, I am pretty sure that would stir up some nasty rumours."
"Thank fuck for that," Draco has kneeled beside him in the study,  with a look of uncertainty and worry. "What was that all about?"
"I would rather fly my broom into the Whomping Willow," Ron whispered back. "Sorry mate, I am sure it won't be too bad."
Draco smirked sympathetically. "He has to work sometimes, and he has been skipping work a lot lately." Now Draco had said it; he realised maybe he hadn't been the best influence after all. "Do you know what happened at his last birthday?"
"Friday is good for me, I will let Ron and Hermione know," Draco gave his Mother a hug goodbye and left The Manor.
"Shut up, and go help my mother stop worrying about whatever she is worried about." He kissed Harry on the lips just as Lucius entered the room.
"Another cup of coffee, please," Draco said to the waitress who was carrying a tray of dirty plates to the kitchen.
Upon further inspection, he had decided to check the drawers to which ones were his clothes and was surprised to see that everything was colour coded and tightly folded away there was even a drawer full of watches and ties, who was Harry living with? He thought. He couldn't see any of his clothes; they all looked like Draco's.
It was deafening as everyone was talking loudly and excitedly Harry could hear a buzz in the air as everyone was discussing the mysterious manager. He looked up at the fifty-foot high round goal posts and smiled. The corner of his eye caught a woman sat high up in one of the stands; he couldn't tell who she was he just saw flowing brown hair sat staring down at them.
"We need to tell Kingsley," Harry said. "They are doing a full enquiry on him at work already; this can help."
Harry grunted in approval and pulled back, almost completely withdrawing. There was nothing to compare to this. Even if he lived to fuck a dozen dude’s arses—which he wouldn’t except for Draco—Draco’s was the first. Only. Draco’s was the only.
"Fine, yeah," Ron replied, his ears red with embarrassment, almost overfilling his cereal with milk. "Bet it will be all over the school now. 'Ron Weasley cries like a baby in his sleep.' Bet Malfoy and Zabini, got a good laugh out of it."
Along the other side, there were burgers, hot dog vans and a fish and chip vans, which smelled amazing; He hadn’t eaten in a while, so he was definitely getting hungry.  Harry saw Malfoy looking scared as they passed a ride with a giant skull on the front, it was the haunted house ride, and it wasn’t even that scary he remembered Teddy laughing all the way through it the previous year and he was only six at the time.
Harry stood up, too, and stretched. "I will come as well then, the first day back is always tiring." Ron looked as though he was going to tell him to stay, but chose not to, and they walked upstairs to their dorm room.
The time had come for the big cake reveal, and Draco's palms were sweating as he flexed them open and close. Hermione had gathered everyone around the stage when Draco had given the signal.
Draco sulked his way up to Astoria and then quickly put on his best smile, taking her around the waist. "Hello, you made it," He said casually.
Blaise nodded and opened his desk drawer flicking through files, pulling out one that said "Daily Snack Cafe." He placed it on the desk in front of Draco. "Are you sure you want to do this?" Blaise asked scratching his chin again. "What about your job? Ginny will shout at me for even being the one signing it over. I would like to have children someday, and that won't happen if she hexes off my balls."
"She was a Muggle, and even she judged us for being friends." Draco frowned. "What will everyone else say?"
After a minute or two Lucius finally spoke. "I have no doubt you and Harry would make excellent parents but isn't going to be difficult with you both working full time?"
They both ignored him and spoke animatedly together about their favourite parts of the first book. "I am in it a lot you know," Draco said straightening up importantly.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable," Harry apologised and ran his fingers through his hair.
Everyone around the table clapped and gave their congratulations. The only person who seemed less impressed, was, of course, Mrs Weasley, but even she seemed to be proud of the success of her sons.
The people who hadn't noticed Harry was there started talking in excited whispers and stared at the guy Draco was looking at intensively.
"As I told you, I am fine, I am going to bed I have had an awfully long day," Draco said walking back to his mother and kissing her on the cheek and then leaving the room.
"Well, if you are so confident that you will beat me on..... that, then I suppose you will have to earn your freedom."
The table just looked at her bewildered apart from Zach who was leaning across the table to pick up her bowl. Just as he reached it the table cleared off and a new course was laid out, pork chops with applesauce, roast potatoes parsnips, sprouts, green beans and carrots appeared on their plates.
Mr Weasley looked up at him. "Yep, that's it; case closed, thank Harry for me will you? I am sure he helped to find it as well?"
"Professor Flitwick will escort you to your new common room shortly, I just wanted to go over a few things beforehand," She said with all the severity she could harness. "Those of you who take Transfiguration, I will be continuing to do so."
Draco couldn't believe it, he had spent the past year and a half working in a job he hated, and Harry knew the whole time. "You know, I think I preferred it when you had no memory."
"Wow, big achievement," Harry said amused but couldn't help feeling somewhat jealous. "What are you doing at work on Saturday anyway? I thought you would have somewhere more important and less boring to be."
Draco kicked off into the warm air, followed closely by Harry; they took off north at a fast pace, Draco had to keep slowing down to let Harry catch up now and then. The rows of houses underneath became blurred and looked tiny from up high.
"Ladies and Gentleman, thank you for joining us for the 260th Summer Ball..." A wizard said, standing on the stage the whole room died out as they all began paying attention to the man on the stage.
They separated at the kissing gate at the entrance of the graveyard and joined back together on the other side.
"Keep me out of this," Ginny said stepping backwards. "If you want to buy stupid things that's down to you."
He had reached the door at the bottom of the stairs and held onto his wand tightly. The long corridor was dimly lit, it was very depressing and reminded him of the wartime at The Manor. He could see two beefy guards outside one of the cell doors; it had to be Theodore.
"We had fun; he is a good kid. I think he is lonely and needs friends his own age," Draco replied peeling potatoes with his wand. "He misses you also."
When Malfoy didn’t reply, Harry took it upon himself to take a good look at his bedroom. It was very messy; the brightly coloured pink walls were covered in Weird Sister's posters, while the desk next to the door was littered with school books, parchment and quills. Clothes were strewn about the floor,  and crumpled up bits of parchment surrounded an empty bin.
It brought Draco back to the critique he got this morning about how his shop didn't go with the rest of Diagon Alley.
"I should come for breakfast more often," Draco smiled, head tilted back, eyes closed still breathing heavily.
"Thank you," Harry grabbed the cup with his left and saw the wedding band as he moved it back to him. He put the cup on the table in front of him and looked at the ring for closer inspection the name 'Draco' had been engraved on it.
"I am Draco Malfoy," Draco screamed making his body jerk upright in bed his fathers grey eyes were staring at him widely.
"We all sat down last night and discussed it, and decided it would be best to tell you so you could deal with it appropriately, sir," Harry spoke with unease, he had rarely seen Kinglsey so quiet.
There was united agreement through yes's and nods. Cotton looked at everyone and then began to tap a few people already, they got up quietly and annoyedly and left.
"You know, when I lost my memory I asked myself the same thing, It was a question I still don't 100% understand, but I know it's something I want to do." Harry felt Draco's hand in his. "I also recommended Ron as my replacement, which he accepted after Ron has completed his four-week retraining programme."
Mr Weasley was sat on a small pink footstool twisting some sort of muggle metal stick into a muggle electrical device. Draco subtly rolled his eyes.
He sat with Ginny, Blaise, Ron, Harry, and Luna at the dining room table eating bacon sandwiches that Ginny had spent the past ten minutes making for everyone. Draco had to admit they weren't as good as the one he ate at Harry's house the other day.
He got to the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and walked up and down the corridor three times, trying to request the room, it was difficult when he was so tired, and all he could think about was Harry bloody Potter.
"I wanted to apologise for the way I acted at dinner the other night, I wasn't very friendly towards you," Mr Weasley replied with a look of regret on his face. "It wasn't because of you kissing a man, no, I am very much open minded about any type of relationship."
Malfoy's curtains around his bed were closed when they got inside. Zabini's bed was empty, Ron moved around the room getting his stuff together, he looked like he had not got over Harry calling him Roody.
"I feel I am becoming like him; there's a darkness in me, I feel it most when I dream," Draco admitted for the first time. "What if it surfaces when you go?"
Harry sat in Lucinda's with Hermione and Ron; they were all smiling warmly at each other. Harry and Ron had both gotten their dream jobs as Aurors and were out celebrating together. It was one of the happiest days of Harry's life.
“Draco,” he groaned as he clenched the muscles wrapped around Draco’s cock, causing Draco’s grey eyes to fly open as he panted.
Draco signed his name with a flourish, smirking pleased with himself. Blaise, however, looked mortified and as though they both had made a big mistake.
Harry took the lift down a level to the magical law enforcement offices trying to avoid eye contact with anyone he came in contact with. He heard a few people tell him Happy birthday, which he smiled and nodded to, but he wished he had brought his invisibility cloak with him.
"I mean it Draco, I want conversation, I get better conversation from a goblin at Gringotts than I do in this house." His mother said over-exaggerating.
"Draco, Old chap, amazing party." Blaise Zabini had approached him before he could crawl into the corner and have a mental breakdown.
Harry felt a cold, rough surface on his back; his head hurt like hell. He groaned as he tried to lift his head up off the hard surface, he had been laid on. Harry opened his heavy eyelids to see where he was, his vision was blurred, but he could make out he was in his kitchen. His memory of how he got there was foggy he had absolutely no idea why he was on his dining table, and why he was only in his boxers.
Draco did the same as they walked through the Manor peering through the open doors, most of the furniture had been covered with sheets to keep the dust off. "I don't think there is anything down here," He said after they checked the last room at the end of the hallway.
"Yeah, mate," Dean said agreeing. "We have always been here for you if you needed us; we are even soberer now."
Narcissa let out a small annoyed noise and snapped her head away from the two of them and picked up her own glass.
Hermione had outdone herself, it was exactly how he envisioned it to be, the large buffet table held all Harry's favourite foods and sweets the present table was overfilled with presents. Panic hit him when he couldn't see the birthday cake, the essential part of his surprise.
"Harry, I'm so sorry." Draco sat in the chair next to his bed, grabbed Harry's hand, which to Draco's dismay he pulled away.
Draco and Ron arrived at Theodore Nott's house, it was silent, and that worried Draco. Ron had Harry's invisibility cloak on and was clutching his and Harry's wand.
He leaned down and got his mouth to Draco’s, kissing him gently. “Why are you so bloody perfect?” he muttered against his lips.
"Yes, I had no idea about you and Potter until the photographer brought me the pictures. It turned out I wasn't the only one who had hired photographers, Robards was keeping a very close eye on you, and it was only a matter of time before something would be leaked to the prophet, so I had to use all the connections I had left to get things hushed up. However, you and Potter insisted on parading around together."
"Interesting. So now it's the Masquerade Ball, and you two are spotted sitting together at the VIP table. You are seen dancing and together the whole night. The daily prophet story was confusing, and they brushed off the juicy story as being a statement, can you reveal if this was for a statement or have you both come out as gay?"
"I think I have a Quidditch match at three and if we were going to find something it will still be here tomorrow, you can either stay here and look or come to the match with me," Malfoy said then blushed and added, "or not."
Harry groaned but didn't budge. Draco shook him vigorously. "Alright, alright," He said sitting slowly up. "You better be showing me something important, or I swear to God you will be fed to the snake."
Blaise was somehow still conscious and talking in slurs about the time he and Draco went to America. "The thing is right; they don't call Muggles, Muggles in America they call them No-Maj, which isn't very creative."
"I have spoken to Andromeda personally. Her husband and only daughter were killed in the battle, and she is left to raise her grandchild, Teddy Lupin. Andromeda has volunteered to take in Narcissa on any conditions of probation, and she will accept her help with raising Teddy." Harry turned his head to the Malfoys. "A mother would do anything for her child, and I believe that everything Narcissa did, was done to protect her child."
"And how are you going to explain to Muggles how you managed to stuff a 3ft unicorn in your bag?" Harry said poking a hole in his cunning plan.
"Let me," Draco murmured. The hand paused, and Draco was half-glad... it would make it easier to focus. "Let me..." Draco wanted to do this, needed to, but Harry had had plenty of time to second-guess himself. If Harry let himself think too much, they'd both regret it. Draco went to his knees.
Thirsty, gasping, Draco pulled off a moment, heard Harry make a low, displeased murmur. Draco licked his lips, ran a finger along the ropy vein on the underside of Harry's curving cock, and kissed the crown, lapping it lightly. He kneaded the velvety sac, drawing up between the other man's powerful thighs, and rested his cheek against the narrow curve of Harry's hip.
"Yes, for the ball tonight," Draco replied like he had read his mind. "We had this conversation this morning; don't tell me you forgot already."
Harry stood up also and couldn't get out of the office quick enough. He said goodbye and raced back quickly back to his own office to go through what the hell had just happened. He was being put up for Head Auror, and Robards was all of a sudden leaving with all their problems solved.
“Okay,” Draco said. “Okay. Go slow.” And he tried to relax, tried not to tense as Harry manoeuvred and pushed.
After the commotion had died down, Harry began to testify on behalf of his school nemesis, Draco Malfoy. Of the three Malfoys, Draco was by far the hardest for Harry to look at. While Lucius Malfoy was just as gaunt and pale as his son, he had been in this situation twice before. But Draco, as his mother had said, was just a boy; a boy who had grown up surrounded by blood prejudice, and had not had the chance to be his own man. He didn't deserve the fate of the other Death Eaters; he may have had the Mark on his skin, and spent a year trying to kill Dumbledore, but unlike the other Death Eaters, he hadn’t felt like he had a choice.
Fred and George had an announcement to make after all three courses and seconds had been devoured. They stood up in their best dragon skin suits and looked around the table to make sure all eyes were on them.
"It's better for the public's opinions of you and The Ministry," Shacklebolt replied. The Minister and Mr Weasley started for the door. "Come Mr Malfoy; I am sure Gawain would like to speak to Mr Potter in private now."
Bill got the class to pair up and to practice nonverbally disarming each other. Ron called got to Hermione before Harry, so he ended up with Neville, which wasn't too bad, it could've been worse, he supposed, he could've ended up partnered with Goyle, who was told to partner with a less than pleased Malfoy. It took him back to the exploding snap game when Malfoy had said 'fuck Goyle', and Zabini had told him he was a 'sore subject', he wondered what Goyle had done to get in the Slytherins bad books.
The night before Harry's return to Hogwarts he went to Andromeda's to say goodbye to Teddy as the next time he will get spend time with him will be in the Christmas holiday's. When he arrived in the kitchen fireplace he saw Malfoy, Zabini and Nott sat around the kitchen table deep in conversation, only noticing Harry when he stumbled out losing balance and falling to the concrete floor.
Harry pulled out and manoeuvred, so they were in perfect position to suck each other's cocks, they moved in unison together letting out little moans as they went. They both felt ready to let go and held each other close as they swallowed each other's salty liquid.
He leaned in and grinned. "This is good," he said, and he bent to Harry's throat. His tongue licked his lips, and he pressed them, moist, against Harry’s skin. He breathed him in, tasted the tang of sweat and smelled the heady spice that was all Harry. He pressed his lips firmly against the pulse that beat rapidly under the soft skin of Harry’s neck.
When Harry had arrived at the ministry in the morning, he had almost missed Ron leaving to find him. Apparently, he had gotten hold of a powerful wand, albeit not the elder wand but one that is close to its power that even Voldemort couldn't find.
Fred and George looked at each other as though they were silently communicating and then nodded. "Fred had kissed Angelina Johnson that day and was trying to remember all the details; poor bloke just wants to relive one of his favourite days, are you going to deny him of his happiness, Harry?" George said shaking his head solemnly.
Harry and Malfoy looked at each other, Harry inhaled and sidled to the desk next to Hermione and Daphne.
"Draco snuck into the ministry holding cells and almost got himself thrown in one himself, for trying to use the cruciatus curse on Theodore Nott." Ron looked like a completely different person; he had rarely seen him get so wound up.
"That's hot," Blaise stared at the two girls making out. Draco punched his arm as he sat down in between Theo and Blaise. "Just because you don't get turned on by girls doesn't mean you have to spoil it for the rest of us."
Harry broke away from him and smiled, pleased that he had just had the best blow job he has ever had and their team was way in the lead.
"I don't know, I have always done it," Draco said and balled his hands into fists and put them into his pockets.
"Yes, now tell me why you need the tracker and don't change the subject. I am pretty sure the ministry has no idea you have a tracker," Harry had his arms folded. He had no idea where this confidence had come from, he never really paid attention to how trackers worked when he was in Auror training, he just knew you had to be authorised to use one, but Draco had at least two from what he could gather.
"Robards contacted me, telling me I could get my full status back, and everything under the sun I wanted, on the condition I help him with he wants."
Draco followed Blaise through to his large office, he had never been in it before, and he was sad to see it was bigger than his own. Blaise slumped into his chair and rested his legs on his desk. That was the Blaise; he knew and loved.
Harry was attempting to put his suit on, but he would miss a hole and have to start again, and then the edge of his shirt got trapped in his trousers zipper and to make matters worse Lucius Malfoy was stood watching him at the door.
The empty bowls disappeared and were replaced with the main course of lemon herb roasted chicken served with corn on the cob, roast potatoes and a selection of vegetables. The only sound was the knives and forks hitting the plate as they ate and occasionally glanced at each other. Draco often caught his mother glaring at Astoria and looking at Draco with concern in her eyes. Lucius was also glancing at Draco and Astoria with an odd expression on his face.
“I want to try again,”  He demanded, pulling out the pouch again and handing the man another pound coin.
"Yes, I want you inside of me, Malfoy." Harry moaned louder as Draco gripped tighter and moved quicker.
He made it to his office successfully without being bothered by reporters or Mr Weasley, or anybody. He read the letters that had arrived for him before he had gotten into work; it was the same old Weasley Wizard Wheezes items being reported, that he would have to reply back with the same old response,
"Unfortunately not, the owl waited for a reply, I tried to ignore him, but he started pecking at my hand." Draco held up his hand showing little red beak marks. "Just go, and make sure you are at the restaurant by 7, I will be mad if you show up late and not dressed in the outfit that I have picked out for you."
"I said I need you to make sure you have brought your suit and mask today, and if you can pick up those cases of wine and Firewhisky from The Leaky Cauldron, I would much appreciate it."
"Excellent choice of colour, by the way, it really suits you. Mr Malfoy was tempted by it also, but it would clash with his hair colour I told him, so he settled for the black," She said smoothing down his shoulders and refolding the collar over.
"Draco," One of the twins called him across the table. "Can we ask you some questions after dinner?"
"When I got back to the top I found out they weren't actually in any danger, which was pretty embarrassing," Harry shrugged.
"Mum, dad, Uncle Harry has been teaching us how to cast spells, without a wand," Rose said joyfully skipping into the kitchen followed by Hugo and Harry.
Back in the kitchen, the guys' were whispering and quickly stopped when they saw Harry reach the bottom step. "I think I'm going to head off now; I guess I will see you on the Hogwarts Express tomorrow." He stepped into the Fireplace.
"Robards said something didn't he?" Draco asked wanting to know that this wasn't really what Harry thought. "What did he say?"
Teddy lifted his arms in rejoice and ran to Draco giving him a massive hug. "We can go shopping in Diagon Alley or fly brooms; I have one here, don't I Uncle Harry?" Ted asked excitedly his hair changing from red to pink to blue to red again.
"We are just friends," Harry finally said slumping down in his chair and letting his head fall back. "He asked me to go to a carnival with him tomorrow."
Draco smiled, pleased that his rumour skills had pulled through, he didn't think it would get to the prophet that quickly. "Oh really, and who is she?" Draco teased.
When he finished reading, he was relieved to know there was nothing written about the carnival or the multiple kisses he and Harry had participated in. The picture of them was actually perfect; he would have to buy The Prophet for once and cut out the image for his scrapbook.
"Thank's Seamus, I will let him know." Harry stood up and moved along the table giving Mr and Mrs Weasley each a hug.
When Harry and Draco were up and in the kitchen making breakfast the morning owl post arrived. The brown screech owl was carrying the rolled up Daily Prophet. When it dropped into Harry's hand, he was surprised to feel there was a greater weight to it.
"Oh, I do, he is my favourite. But that doesn't mean I don't know what, he and his family are capable of." Mr Weasley paused. "Look Harry, I care about you and to some extent I care about Draco too, so listen to me when I tell you, to stay away from each other, not everyone is going to be accepting of The boy who lived and an Ex-Death Eater being together, there will be mistrust in the community all over again."
"Yeah, we didn't need extra bags of fan mail," Fred said. "You're not going to sue us though, right?"
He came to a stop outside a door that was not completely closed. Draco slipped inside the room through the crack Harry was looking and standing mortified.
"In the basement, through that door," Harry pointed to a brown, wooden door near the fireplace that he hadn't noticed there before. "Don't touch anything; there are a lot of priceless items down there."
"I think I am going to stay at home tonight Harry," Ginny ignored the question and stood up quickly.
"Yes, you are, I won that bet fair and square not my fault you lost control of your broom," Draco snarled. "Come on, shall we go back to bed?" Draco carefully moved Harry's legs off his lap and stood up holding out his hand.
Astoria's head rolled away from him to stare at the ceiling; he grabbed her hand again to feel what little life she had in her, he felt her pulse faintly beating as she tightened her fingers in his. He moved his lips down to her hand kissing it softly, a tear dropped on to the skin and rolled off her hand and on to the sheets. "I do love you, you know," Draco whispered.
"It's just my sister and me, she is the cook, and we put all our savings into buying the ingredients. We aren't going to keep it open much longer," She confided backing away from him
Draco hadn't come to practice the following days, and Harry was getting more worried. On the Friday morning when he got to practice, he decided to ask Cotton where he was.
"Excellent, any Potter updates?" Draco hoped there wasn't a sniff in the air about the surprise party.
Harry shrugged, and they walked into the grounds together both just as nervous as they saw about fifty people sat on benches on the grass. He recognised a lot of them from school, but there were some he had only seen in Quidditch magazines that have been playing for years. Harry sat next to Angelina Johnson who was another fellow Gryffindor; she looked the same as he remembered her to look, dark with black hair and brown eyes, She smiled warmly at him.
Draco had been in the Union Jack Cafe since eight o'clock that morning he had been filling out contracts, checking risk assessments and even making his own plays; it was his team, so he wanted to make sure they have the best matches. He was sat at his usual table at the back of the cafe next to the stone fireplace that was always lit and kept him warm and relaxed to some extent.
Then they lay quietly, Harry finally opening his eyes to drink in Draco's star-kissed skin. He kissed the rosy mouth and laid his head on the smooth chest, falling asleep as Draco's hand stroked his messy dark hair.
"We are close, as soon as we get him we can find out who he was with that cursed Harry," Ron said in a more business-like tone, he turned his head to the mountains of paper on the table near Draco. "You're not getting involved in this."
"I think you just need to deny any knowledge of seeing me; you don't want to lose your job do you?" Draco said caressing Harry's hand under the table.
Draco put the paper down and turned around to face the house elf. "You don't need to keep announcing his arrival he is perfectly capable of greeting himself." Draco snarled at the elf.
"Ye, yeah," Harry replied, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. He grabbed the swan-shaped napkin, opened it out and placed on his lap under the table. He clapped a hand to his mouth as he felt the hand playfully squeeze his thigh.
"Draco?" Blaise’s voice came from the back; He saw his friend walking towards him, dressed smartly in black robes, he wasn't used to seeing him in his work robes. "Follow me."
"Tell you what?" Harry asked angrily as he pushed open the kitchen door and walked inside looking at the startled looks on their faces. "It's one thing to talk about me behind my back but another to do it in my own house."
"You tried to trap us together?" Harry spoke up. "That's immorally wrong; you can't play people like that."
"Draco, what are you...?" Harry was stopped by Draco's lips against his; he kissed back still with his hand locked in with his.
Harry took the envelope and pulled a piece of parchment and read. "Portkey acceptance form to the United States of America."
"Annabel was nice to me. I got called into Robards office and saw your father walking out of it." Harry paused and watched as Draco's face turned angry.
Harry sat back down in his chair once more and tried to refocus on his paperwork which was still difficult with the heat, and the fact that he had to worry about going on a date with Ernie Macmillan, who he knew perfectly well-fancied him. Every party they would go to he couldn't help but follow Harry around like a lost puppy and try to flirt with him. He supposed he could pretend to like him for one night.
This chapter has male slash if you don't feel comfortable reading it for whatever reason, then don't read on.
"Good Afternoon," Professor Weasley said, standing in front of the class, he didn't look nervous, he seemed to have a coolness about him, now Harry had come to think of if it, Bill was always so relaxed, unlike Ron who was the complete opposite. "As I am well aware, the position of a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher is not one to take lightly; When I was at school all ours had their own special way of going out, my last one was an evil witch who almost got my friends, and I killed."
On the last day of the week, before their three days off Harry had gotten dressed after his shower and was walking over the pitch with his firebolt ready to go home, when he saw Draco coming out of the stands and calling after him. He stopped and turned around to face him quizzically.
That evening saw the three of them sitting in  The Burrow kitchen with Ginny, while Mrs Weasley prepared a special dinner. The Daily Prophet had hoped  Harry would have an extravaganza with half of the Britain wizarding population to celebrate he, the Chosen One and the Saviour of the Wizarding World, being born on this day eighteen years ago. He, therefore, had purposely decided not to do that.
"It's great," Harry replied. "Especially now it's darker, the lights make it seem more magical, and you forget that you're in the Muggle world."
Draco walked through the house closely followed by Ron behind, he kicked open a few doors, and they were empty he got to the double doors near the staircase and kicked them open.
Draco decided to have lunch in Diagon Alley today; he thought he might as well try to act as normal as possible, eat food with the regular witches and wizards on his break instead of locked up in his office.
"Good, you should probably take it to Madam Malkins to get re-tailored though," Draco advised with a smirk.
Both Harry and Draco had noticed Ginny walking away from the crowd that had gathered to Blaise Zabini, who Draco thought was looking handsome in his all-black suit and had remembered going with him to help pick it out last year.
Potter inhaled and exhaled, another thing Malfoy seemed to enjoy watching. "Can we go somewhere to talk?" He looked down the table towards his friends, did he not want them to be seen talking.
Harry re-read the resignation letter multiple times, what was he doing throwing away his career? Was this something he wanted? He wished he had his memories so he could understand what was going through his head at the time. He stared at the words start a family and then to the photograph of him and Draco dancing together on there wedding day, that was almost blocked but the stacks of paper on the desk. "What do you mean, Harry?" He asked himself out loud. "This is 15 years of hard work down the drain."
Draco narrowed his eyes at the space Danny had just occupied and flicked his wand making the door slam shut and lock. "Carpe Diem, I said, I will buy a cafe I said," He muttered angrily to himself.
Draco smirked and walked up the steps to the double doors at the front of the Manor. "Alohamora," he muttered, and with a click, the doors unlocked and swung open.
"So, your pictures didn't make it into the papers, and now you want to play nice?" Harry continued. "I don't accept your apology, and I don't see why I shouldn't tell the Minister about your little plan."
"Fuck off," He said to the snake quivering.  He shook the snake off his wand and back onto the ring quickly tapping it back to inanimate. He slammed the glass shut and panted heavily, trying to get his heartbeat back to normal.
Dumbledore nodded.  "Well, it can be done again, but not for a thousand more years.  So, for all intents and purposes, you're correct, Kingsley, because nobody in this room or anywhere on the planet will be alive to do it."
“My late grandfather, William Cromwell,” Ryan answered.  “He started giving me lessons shortly after I turned five and continued until his death when I was ten.  He also taught my cousin Matt and he helped me practice quite a bit as we were growing up.”
“How do I know that it was really Veritaserum that Adrian gave Draco?”  Pansy asked.  “I mean, when brewed properly, Veritaserum is as clear as water.  How do I know that Adrian didn’t just put three drops of water in their mouths and they then pretended to be under the influence of Veritaserum?”
“It shouldn’t be too hard,” Ryan said.  “Matt and Oliver are the Music and Art professors, respectively, and the others are all students here at Hogwarts.  I’m not sure though about getting my uncle to come for a visit, because being an Auror keeps him very busy considering the current state of things.”
“Yes, that’s true,” said Rowena.  “I know I worried about stuff that didn’t need to be worried about, but that’s my mother’s fault.  She taught me from a very young age that it was unnatural not to have anything to worry about and that you should worry if you can’t find anything to worry about.”
“He would never do that,” Asheera said.  “But, if he did, then Mephistopheles would become King of the Hells, because Zeus would destroy both Asmodeus and the Ninth Hell, which would make Cania, the Eighth Hell, the deepest of the Hells.”
“Oh dear lord,” the woman said.  “So they have limited capabilities when it comes to detecting wandless magic.  Obviously, it is nowhere near advanced enough though if they can’t tell the difference between a house-elf’s magic and a human’s magic.”
Harry Potter offered me his hand.  I still can’t believe it to be honest.  Of course, I haven’t told him, but I wish it had been offering me his hand in marriage instead of friendship.  This, my dear journal, is something that you already know, but nobody else does as I’ve kept it well hidden: I’ve had a major crush on Harry since fourth year.  A crush which I’m sure has developed into love; well, I’m not totally sure, because I don’t have much experience with romantic love, but I do know that my feelings for Harry are something which I’ve never felt for anyone else.
“No, we’re not,” answered Harry.  “Bill and I haven’t been together since the day before school started.  I wanted to continue our fling, but he told me it was against school rules for him to be with me, because I’m only 16.  He did consent to give me one final kiss after school started, but that’s it.”
“Uncle Amos and Aunt Hannah?”  Tom asked, as he recognized the names from what Zach had told him when they were discussing their families.  “You told me they only had one son and that Voldemort killed him two years ago.  What was his name?  Richard or something?”
“I don’t mind, Professor,” Ryan said.  “It just feels good to be fencing again, I’ve missed it.  I didn’t really get the chance to practice much in the States, because my grandmother didn’t know the first thing about it and most of my friends at school had never so much as looked at a sword, let alone used one.”
“Yes, during the wedding ceremony,” Corelian answered, “a few drops of your partner’s blood is dripped onto each piece of jewelry.  The spells on the jewelry allows it to absorb the blood.  The blood is necessary for all of the benefits granted by the Atlantean marriage ceremony.  In the case of sponsored couples, an additional spell is cast upon both rings to allow for the absorption of the sponsoring Atlantean’s blood in order to give the lifespan and eternal youth.”
“My cousin and his fiance, Rowena,” Ryan answered.  “Allow me to present Professor Matthew Cromwell and Professor Oliver Wood, the music and art professors, respectively.”
“Rowena taught me a spell to make my shoes as hard as iron but as light as a feather.  So, Harry, you could repeatedly drop a brick on my feet and I wouldn’t be in any pain.”
At this point, several people at the table started talking all at once, most of them asking Dumbledore why he'd say such a thing that couldn't possibly be true.  Raising his hands and calling for silence, however, Dumbledore said, "I expected you wouldn't take my word for it.  I can't say as I blame you, but perhaps you'll believe your own eyes."
“Yes, Valen, I know, I know.  The time is fast approaching when I shall have to come to Hogwarts and then he will finally know the truth.”
Later that evening in the common room of Salazar’s private quarters, everyone who knew the full truth about Tom Riddle and Voldemort had gathered as Professor Snape had sent word that he’d finished brewing the potion.
“Correct. As I’m sure it’s use is rather obvious, I won’t ask you what it’s used for. Five points to Hufflepuff.”
“How is that possible though?”  Hermione asked.  “How can a person born in 1926 be only 16 in 1996?”
“Yes,” Cedric said.  “I really did spend the last two years in Tartarus, as dead as a doornail as Dickens put it.”  Cedric gave a weak smile, as he was trying to inject some small bit of humor into the otherwise very serious atmosphere.
quoted, however, because I’ve known them all my life and it is also very well documented that Atlantis sank thousands of years ago.”
“It’s a very interesting place,” Bill said.  “Of course, it’s also hot and getting sand in your shoes can be annoying, but all in all, I did enjoy it.  Many people don’t know this, but they still have a Pharaoh you know.”
“Well, my great-great-great-grandaunt Hepzibah Smith apparently said we were related to Hufflepuff,” Zacharias revealed.  “From what I’ve been told though, the rest of the family thought she was just a crazy old woman who only said that to justify her purchase of a cup that belonged to Hufflepuff.”
“Good idea, Bill,” Matthew said as he stood up.  “I’m going to go up to the Owlery.  You two stay here and have fun at the Ball, I’ll be back soon.”
"Yet, you still showed emotion when you saw these little beasts," Lucius said as he kicked the smallest of the puppies, which whimpered loudly at the contact.
Vernon snatched the letter from Harry's hand, as if he didn't believe what Harry had said, and after a moment he asked, "Weasley? Aren't they those people who destroyed my fireplace two summers ago?"
“Why did you take this job, anyway?” Harry asked as he sat down on the edge of Bill’s bed. “Better yet, why didn’t you tell me that you took it?”
“Rowena, the man deserved it!”  Salazar exclaimed.  “Our son died and instead of being there for me, the man he claimed to love, he blamed me for Alaric’s death!  It was like having my heart ripped out of my chest and stomped on.  I did not kill Alaric; I could never hurt a hair on that precious boy’s head!  I loved him and I did everything I could to save him, but he still died.  I can’t tell you how many times I wished that it had been me instead of my beloved nine-year-old son!”
Dumbledore paused to conjure himself a cup of tea and took a sip before continuing.  "Now, let’s get back to the subject of sorting.  Each house has qualities that it holds in high regard, and the Sorting Hat will determine which house it thinks you belong in based on those qualities.  For example, Gryffindor values bravery, so if the hat judges someone to be exceptionally brave, they will likely find themselves in Gryffindor.  Ravenclaw values intelligence, Hufflepuff values loyalty, and Slytherin values cunning.  Now, Minerva, if you would be so kind as to place the hat on Mr. Cromwell's head, we will begin."
“No, Potter, I’m not,” Draco said as he rolled up his left sleeve to show that there was no Dark Mark.  “I don’t want anything to do with that madman who calls himself the Dark Lord; I never have.  As for my sire, after what he did to my mother, I don’t want anything to do with him either.”
The next morning, Tuesday, November 12, 1996, many of the students were feeling rather depressed because the first Quidditch match of the season had yet to take place.  In years past, it was usually the first Saturday of November, which should have been November Second, but Professor Dumbledore cancelled the match for reasons that he chose not to elaborate upon.
“Oh come on, Bill, I know you like him. I know you have a thing for younger men with black hair, which describes Nick to a t. True, he does, have those blond streaks, but I don’t think that’s really a problem. His eyes are a lovely shade of blue you know. Kind of like sapphires in the sun and I heard it from his own lips that he’s bisexual.”
“Yeah,” Bill said as he wrapped an arm around Nick’s waist.  “Godric is really going to be in for it though.  I mean, Rowena and Helga are mad enough at him.  Can you even imagine how angry Salazar will be with him?”
“Corelian is indeed a very smart man,” Asheera said.  “Of course most Atlanteans are.  We’re very studious by nature and when you live as long as we do, you have plenty of time to cram tons of information into your brain.”
“It most certainly was his fault!” thundered Godric.  “He should never have been giving Alaric potions lessons!”
“It’s a note from Bill,” Hermione said. “It says we’re supposed to meet in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.”
After the trip to Atlantis, Minister Scrimgeour and the others had no choice but to admit that Atlantis still existed and they all spread the word that the experts quoted in the
“A former Hogwarts student actually,” Harry said.  “Tom Marvolo Riddle, now known as Lord Voldemort; he’s also Salazar Slytherin’s heir.  He went to school here over fifty years ago and he did find Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets, but as far as we know, he didn’t find Slytherin’s quarters.”
“I think this one would look great on you, Hermione,” Draco said as he pulled a flowing light blue silk dress with dark blue trim and gold accents from the rack.
“I still say that its slavery and it needs to stop!”  Hermione insisted.  “The Wizarding World is stuck in the Dark Ages and it’s time that it came into the twentieth century.”
“No!”  Pansy shouted.  “I will never give up on Draco.  We are destined to be together and I don’t care what I have to do!  We will be together!”
“It’d be impossible to not have a good time,” Nick said with a grin.  “My boyfriend has got to be one of the world’s best kissers.”
“Draco was attacked during the Quidditch game today,” Aarik answered.  “The word is out that Draco and I are together and I guess some of his teammates don’t like that very much.  Crabbe and Goyle both hit Bludgers at Draco.  He got out of the way fast enough to miss the one from Goyle, but Crabbe’s grazed his foot and broke his toe.”
Dumbledore, Hermione, and Bill all cast concerned looks at Harry at this revelation, because if it was true, then that meant...
"Oh my, that poor boy," McGonagall said. "It's sad to think of one so young having the Cruciatus cast on him, but even worse for a child to have to witness their own mother's murder, especially when their father is the murderer."
Harry was indeed correct on the assumption as McGonagall soon called out the name, "Waters, Kyle," followed by, "Waters, Lane," "Waters, Mark," and "Waters, Noah." They all looked identical to one another, but as if to prove that despite their appearances they were in possession of very different personalities, Kyle was sorted into Gryffindor, Lane into Slytherin, Mark into Hufflepuff, and Noah into Ravenclaw. Harry watched the four of them as they were sorted and thought that they looked a little sad that they'd all been sorted into different houses, but at the same time they all looked proud to be in the houses that they were sorted into. Harry knew that as first year students there probably wouldn't be much they could do to influence the older students, but he couldn't help but think that there was a good chance that they might be able to help their fellow first year housemates overcome the longstanding house rivalries, so that in the years to come, the four houses may start working together, rather than fighting.
Several of the other professors were now standing behind Dumbledore, with their wands drawn, sending a clear message to all of the gathered students that it would be extremely unwise to do anything against the rules.  Before Dumbledore or anyone else could say anything, Salazar spoke up.
Harry sighed as he turned his gaze to the lake and said, “Well, if you must know, I’m upset about the ball.  I can’t dance and even if I could, I don’t have a date.”
Harry got the required ingredients, which included valerian root, sopophorous beans, powdered root of asphodel and an infusion of wormwood.  When Harry arrived back at the table, he said, “Why don’t you start chopping the valerian root while I take care of crushing the asphodel root.”
“Aarik, I have no idea how you survived it,” Godric said.  “By all accounts, you should be dead, because a one-year-old wizard should not have been capable of rebounding spells.  As for my training room, it took almost forty years, but I finally managed to charm it in such a way that offensive spells lose their effectiveness when cast in the room.  The Killing Curse will still knock the person hit by it unconscious, but the Enervate charm will reverse it with no major damage; perhaps a concussion and headache, depending on how and where the person landed when they lost consciousness, but that’s about it.”
Pansy continued to look stricken, but she did know that Adrian was right.  Adrian was the first Slytherin named Head Boy in the last several years, so as far as Professor Snape was concerned, he could do no wrong after he had brought the honor back to Slytherin house where it belonged.
Rufus Scrimgeour has been quoted as saying that if the law allowed him to remove Albus Dumbledore from his post as Chief Warlock for this uncalled for breach of the public’s right to know, he would do it.
After several moments of silence, Dumbledore peered at the younger man over his half-moon spectacles and said, “Severus, I swear to you, if there’s a way to break the power of that fiend’s Mark, we will find it.”
“Extremely,” Nick said.  “I can’t thank you enough because Bill is the best thing that ever happened to me.”
"I said 'problem solved,'" Harry said as he held up the letter he just got. "My friend Ron's mum and dad have invited me to spend the rest of the summer with them."
The boy was awake instantly and moaning in pain, so oblivious to anything other than the pain coursing through his body that he didn’t even notice when some of his own excrement ended up in his mouth.
“Miss Parkinson, is it?”  Rowena asked from her frame and Pansy nodded.  “What reason could we possibly have to lie?  We were the four greatest and most powerful wizards and witches of our age.  Do you honestly think that if we say something is so, it isn’t?  I assure you that there truly is no difference between Muggle-borns, Half-Bloods, and Purebloods.  For example, look at Miss Hermione Granger from Gryffindor, she is a Muggle-born, but she is also the best student in this school and I don’t doubt for a minute that she is very powerful.  But, perhaps, it might be a good idea to see just what your various power levels are.  Salazar, didn’t you create a potion for determining power levels?”
“A well-respected British Muggle school,” Matthew answered, “which is very popular with the royal family.  Mum thought two years at Hogwarts was more then enough.  She figured I’d learned enough to control my powers and that I should attend Eton and get a proper British education.  She always complained that education at Hogwarts was not well-rounded enough.  Eton is an all-boy school, so I think she also hoped I’d make good friends with a few classmates, preferably those of royal birth, in the hopes that I’d meet and fall in love with one of their sisters and marry into the royal family.”
Entering the room, Harry stepped into a shadowy corner, removed his cloak, deactivated the map, and stowed them both in an inner pocket of his robe.  Walking over to Draco’s bed, Harry could see that the blond was sleeping peacefully.
Adrian was just about to tell Lane that he wasn’t old enough to try out when seventh-year Slytherin Miles Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, walked out onto the pitch carrying his uniform and the Nimbus 2001 that had been issued to him.  Throwing them down at Adrian’s feet, Miles said, “I quit the team.”
“That is entirely possible,” Rowena interjected.  “As Headmaster of Hogwarts, he would also be in control of the castle wards.  As such, the castle keeps him very well informed about what goes in within its walls, almost as if he were omnipresent.”
“I’m sure you know that you were named James after your father,” Remus said.  “As for the Aarik, you are actually named after a cousin of your mother’s.”
“I don’t think so, Your Majesty,” Corelian said.  “The woman I love, the woman I intended to marry, just died giving me a son.  And instead of being where I belong, with my newborn son, I’m here.”
I’m still in a state of shock, to be perfectly honest.  I knew that each of the four Hogwarts founders had an heir in the school, but I never expected to be related to one of them.  I knew that I wasn’t an heir because if the Malfoy family had been related to any of the founders, Lucius would have made a point of mentioning it at some point, well, at least if we were related to Slytherin or maybe Ravenclaw.  If we had been related to Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, Lucius would have hid the fact and probably killed anyone who found out.
“The attack has been lifted,” McGonagall said.  “Thankfully, someone got word to Professor Dumbledore and reinforcements arrived.”
“Well, grandmother, it’s because I have a greater connection to Slytherin House then any other Slytherin in this school.  It turns out that your birth name was Ariana Merope Riddle, the eldest daughter of Thomas Riddle and his wife, Merope Gaunt-Riddle.  The Gaunt family was the last remaining direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin.”
"I was wrong, Molly," Dumbledore admitted.  "It's recently come to my attention that this young man has been held in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor, being tortured by Voldemort himself, for over fifty years now."
“Yes, Delaney, it does.  I only acted the way I did before out of fear of what my sire would do to me.  Now I could care less and I intend to act the way I want to.  If my sire doesn’t like it, he can just go fuck himself for all I care.”
“Well, I’m only 25,” Bill answered.  “And no, I haven’t been in the position long, only since the beginning of this school year.  The Headmaster transferred the former Potions professor into the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, so he brought me in to teach.  I’m normally a curse-breaker for Gringotts’ Bank, but I did get an Outstanding Potions N.E.W.T.”
I’m glad to be back at Hogwarts, but at the same time, I’m not. As usual, as soon as we had some modicum of privacy, Pansy once again tried to seduce her way into my pants. I really don’t understand how she can be so dense because I’ve told her on more then one occasion that I’m not interested, but she just doesn’t take a hint.
“Thank you, Pucey,” Draco said, which was exactly why he had asked Pucey to do this in the first place.
“Mr. Malfoy?”  Dumbledore asked, clearly shocked, as Draco Malfoy stepped down from the coach.  “Why are you with the Dullahan?”
"And young Mr. Malfoy is responsible?"  Ollivander asked.  He liked to think of himself as being a good judge of character and when he'd met the young Malfoy a few years ago, he never for a second thought he'd ever do something like this.  He had obviously been wrong about the Malfoy scion.
“Who would do that, though?”  Ryan asked.  “I mean the only people who are in here on a regular basis are you, Stephen, Terry, Michael, Anthony, and me.”
On the other end of the room, opposite the organ, a long table of food and drinks was set out, along with several round tables, so that the students could sit down and rest.  The length of the room, though, left more then enough space between the tables on one end and the organ on the other for a large dance floor.
"Fine," Draco agreed. "Good day Minister," Draco bowed his head and left the Ministers office almost knocking into Jane Honeywell.
"You're welcome." Draco smiled and gave him one last kiss before walking out of the gate and disapparating home.
"Thank you." He said looking at the evident girly scrawl of his ex-girlfriend Pansy Parkinson. As the house-elf hurried off, he ripped open the letter hoping to get the response he needed.
Draco stood up and walked back over to the pensieve taking out his wand; he emptied the contents back into the vial. He closed his eyes and pointed the tip to his forehead and withdrew it allowing the memory to be extracted. He placed it into the pensieve and swirled it gently around.
"I don't know what you are talking about," Harry grinned lifting a glass of Firewhisky to his mouth.
"You're going to knock those over Ronald," Hermione said as she watched Ron leaning against a stack of large cardboard boxes that weren't there last time Harry had been round and when he came to think of it their house was looking bare and full of the same boxes.
Draco walked into one of the dimly lit rooms in the east wing of the Manor, only himself and his parents could find the room to any other person it was just an ordinary wall. He faced the ceiling to floor glass cabinet in front of him; it was filled with strange objects, things anyone would wonder why it would be in a protected room.
Something snapped inside of Harry. It beat at his chest and spread until it hummed everywhere. It was fierce, primal, and it broke from his throat as he wrenched at Draco's wrists, twisting them until Draco's body turned against his. He pushed Draco, arms now pinned above his head, until he fell flat against the wall.
Draco covered Harry's mouth with his palm. He leaned forward and kissed the back of his own hand, interested in the tickling, intriguing way Harry's lips moved against his skin.
"I am not Potter," Draco shouted standing up slamming both hands on the table. "I am Draco Malfoy." A pain shot through his forehead and he was now sat in Dumbledores office.
"As a matter of fact, I will." Draco grabbed a piece of parchment from his briefcase next to him, and his quill moved aggressively across the paper. "To whom it may concern, I would like to thank you for the good wishes for our anniversary; however my husband Draco Malfoy is 34, the same age as me, please check facts in the future. Harry Potter, Head Auror."
"I can't tell you; it's not my secret to tell." He said not looking Draco in the eye. "You wouldn't have done it if I told you it was for him."
He peered through the door and saw nurses gathered around her checking her vitals and giving her water; she smiled weakly when she noticed him stood there, he walked hesitantly inside sitting in the chair beside her bed tears began to roll down his cheeks.
"That's just as bad," Draco replied, folding his arms and sighed. "I am grateful you would do that for me, but Harry is already suspicious of you."
"I assume you have both seen this morning's paper and the reporters in the Atrium?" Robards spoke with an angry tone in his voice.
"Can you teach me to cast nonverbal spells," He repeated slower and clearer, his cheeks flushed pink.
He hadn't said anything yet because he was still waiting for him to laugh and say it's just a joke, but a small part of him was considering it, why? Two reasons, one because he was an idiot and two because he wanted to spend time with the prat that he had been thinking about for the past three years. But as it was Potter, there was a natural order of things; a sneer here, a snarky comment there, shove on the shoulder through the corridor, and then the longing stares when he wasn't looking.
"And what if they ask you something you don't want to answer?" Harry asked, worried he might let something slip he might not have wanted to share.
"Do you hear that Gin? They want a private conversation in our home, at our table where we are sitting." Blaise said dramatically.
"They are our photo albums I thought they might jog your memory," Draco said noticing that's what Harry had been looking at.
Harry rose out of the pensieve and was back in his basement with Draco stood impatiently next to it.
"Okay then," He agreed nonchalantly, but on the inside, he was jumping up and down with joy. "We should probably cancel our order then."
Harry felt the anger take over and the next thing he knew he was pulling out his wand and saw the green flash of light leave his wand as he had said the incantation.
"Ok," Ron nodded in quiet agreement then looked at Draco, "I know it's not just Harry I should be apologising to, I have acted like a right prick, I am sorry."
"When was the last time you rode your broom?" Draco asked, brushing off the dust and cobwebs from the handle.
He pulled open the drawer in his desk and picked up a bottle of Firewhisky and glass. He filled the glass up to the top accidentally overfilling it so that there was a pool of liquid on his desk running down towards his stacks of paper. "Oh shit."
She backed him against the door where he and Draco had been moments earlier. "I felt it, you know, I often have that effect on men," she whispered making Harry's eyes widen with alarm.
"No, Hermione," He said, rubbing his face, getting agitated that she didn't understand. "Robards told me not to tell anyone, or he would leak the pictures."
"You alright, Ron?" Bill Weasley was striding up their table with the new timetables. "You look a little pale."
Harry leaned back to study the shirt and, gripping the hem, tore into it, watched it rip apart. He braced himself as Draco jumped, snapping his head back to look at Harry.
"Well, I know, Miss Granger, that you and Mr Weasley are returning to Hogwarts for your final year, so I was hoping that Mr Potter will consider returning also," McGonagall answered in her usual no-nonsense manner, but Harry could tell her eyes were pleading. "I know you have said no already, Harry, but I need you there to..."
He saw Harry roll his eyes and then turn around picking up the hanger off the closet door. He stroked the silk material and saw his lip curl into a smile. "I like the feel of this," Harry purred.
"I'm sorry, I wasn't sure what you wanted," Harry said nervously and hating himself for being an inconsiderate prat as Malfoy had so kindly told him.
Harry sighed and fell back onto Hermione's bed, staring up at the ceiling. "I was hoping you could give me a reason to tell him I can't go."
Harry let what Blaise had said sink in for a moment before responding. He didn't understand why they would think he was a loner, he saw them plenty and has always spent as much of his time with Ron and Hermione, he will admit it's been a hard year, he has had to work a lot, but they needed him at work more.
"No, It's fine, I understand." Harry smiled weakly; he had to admit to himself that Kingsley and the board were indeed correct, maybe he could work his way back up eventually.
"Don't be so dramatic, Morty, or you will be abandoned," Harry said half-heartedly standing up and walking to the small box next to the tree and taking out one of the little dead mice and chucking it towards Morty's eager open mouth.
Draco's stomach clenched tightly; he wanted to put his head into his pillow and scream. He had known the night she referred to; he had to witness his Aunt torture Granger; if it weren't for the Occulmency he would be having the same nightmares-- sometimes they did slip in.
"Yes, that's what I was worried about. Look, Harry, I am going to be bold with you, you're not the boy I first met all those years ago, and I know I will always have time for you, but my hands are tied at the moment regarding these special circumstances."
Draco picked up his wine and finished his off too; he had lost count by now how many glasses he and Potter have had since they had been seated, he was pretty sure Potter had been drinking beforehand too.
"Manager? Harry, I thought you said, you turned it down?" Ron said looking away from Draco to Harry.
"Not tonight, I need to go out," He sped up to the portrait hole leaving a half-naked horny Pansy spawled out on the sofa.
"If I remember this correctly, you said 'Draco I have to let you go, your talents are wasted as my secretary.'"
Draco pulled slowly away as if wanting to keep going but couldn't, he had let go of Harry now and was backing towards the fireplace. "Please don't go, stay," Harry said quietly.
"I may have lost my memory, but even I know those words would never come out of my mouth," Harry smiled amusedly.
Harry turned his head toward him hands gripped tightly on the rail. "No, I prefer to stand; this view is amazing," Harry replied with excitement.
He could see Harry looking around for Draco. He lifted his hand up and waved it to get his attention; he couldn't help but feel a rush of pleasure when he saw Harry's face brighten into a smile.
Five minutes later the double doors in front of Draco swung open, and a bushy-haired Hermione hurried inside. He didn't remember inviting Granger to this meal, but his face paled as he saw how frantic she looked.
Harry nodded but didn't reply; he always enjoyed the sorting ceremony, the ones he managed to attend that is.
The dining room table had two extra guests tonight, Blaise Zabini and Ginny Weasley. Draco frowned at the sight of them. He had forgotten they come around every Wednesday for dinner.
Harry took another long swig from his glass nodded and slammed the glass back in front of him continuing to stare at it.
"You are really good at nonverbal spells." He finally said, and it looked like it pained him to say it.
"My dad tells me he has you and Harry at a cursed Manor looking for something, have you found it yet?" Ginny smiled plainly.
Harry bit his lip, he didn't know if he should tell Kinglsey about the blackmail and the photographs, but he thought maybe this is the only chance he will be able to get rid of Robards.
"Ron, Hermione, could you both sit? We need to have an important conversation," Harry said politely ignoring Draco's grey daggers.
Draco coughed to let them know they were still there. They smiled guiltily at them and turned away from each other.
Harry stared ashen-faced at his boyfriend, he looked as though he was about to throw up, he wondered if it was because he had been in there for so long or because of what he saw, or both.
He stepped over the threshold cautiously and walked inside turning head to face the street outside, no turning back now, he thought. As he was being led down the long corridor by Harry he couldn't help but grimace at the interior design; it was dark and drab like it hadn't been decorated since it was first inhabited. There was clutter everywhere; he wondered how Potter could live like this.
Draco slowed down and licked the cock out of his mouth teasing the tip again, tasting the pre-cum. "Do you want me inside you, Potter?" He breathed.
Harry looked up, and sure enough, he saw white blonde hair sat in the stands with a large stack of papers and folders next to him. "Why is not in his office?"
The whole table all looked at him, and Harry was trying to pull him down by his arm sleeve, but he yanked himself free and sat back down taking another swig of wine from the other glass he had.
"No, I don't have any reason to,"  Harry said.  "Do you want me to explain the notes and coins to you?"
"I am okay, just behind at work, there are still some Death Eaters we have lost track of, and I can't get permission to follow up on them."
"A Muggle thing, a car-ni-val," he said, sounding out the individual syllables of the unknown word. "It says it starts tomorrow and it's here all week, fun for all ages."
"I wasn't allowed to, Mum and Dad knew, of course, and Fleur, but I wasn't allowed to tell you three, Professor McGonagall's orders."
Using his teeth, he unbuttoned and unzipped Harry's trousers greeting an old friend lovingly. He followed the trail back up towards Harry's head he was moaning with pleasure as he did so. Whipping off the tie he still had around his neck he grabbed Harry's hands and tied them up and back to the bedpost.
"Who?" Matthew asked, honestly curious, since his grandmother never gave many details about her time as a student.
Moments later, the Fat Lady swung open to admit the large group of people.  She was a bit hesitant to admit non-Gryffindor students to the tower, but considering that both Professor Weasley and the heir of Godric Gryffindor himself told her to, she did.
The mission was a success.  Wormtail signed the confession, before Madam Pomfrey successfully altered his appearance to turn him into an exact duplicate of Tom Riddle.  Once the prison charm was transferred to Wormtail, the rescue group left the Manor as quickly and quietly as they had come.
He let out a small noise of surprise as the duvet began to move and a snakes triangle shaped head poked out of it near his impatiently tapping leg. "Fuck, Morty, don't scare me like that," He whispered, putting a hand on his chest to steady his breathing. The snake stuck out its tongue and covered its head back under the duvet.
Harry accepted hugs from all the Weasleys, Blaise Zabini, Neville, Seamus and Dean, The Patil twins and few of the Aurors from work.
Harry felt his palms were slightly sweaty. "You said you thought we were becoming friends," Harry shrugged.
Harry wrapped his legs tightly around his waist as he kissed back and unbuttoned Draco's waistcoat. He ripped open his shirt as Draco's tongue was deep inside his mouth, Harry bit his lip teasingly making Draco moan pleasurably.
He pulled out a quill and parchment from his bag and began writing a letter to Pansy, he let her know how desperate he was and hoped she would understand and come to his rescue.
Blaise smiled his million-dollar smile at her and Harry felt the love and connection they shared together, and it made the knot in his stomach tighten as the feeling of resentment he would often feel for them both after a few drinks appeared and he found himself balling his hands into fists.
"Goodbye," the kids sang as they floo out of the fireplace leaving Harry and Draco in a disturbed silence.
She pursed her lips ready to say something; her cheeks were flushed too. "Well, that's a slap in the face," She sighed. "I also have that effect on men too, I kissed Zacharias Smith once and then he was kissing Ernie at Neville and Hannah's engagement party."
The small act didn't go unnoticed, heads turned quickly, fingers were pointed, and whispers were sparked as Draco lead Harry in a waltz. The people on the dance floor were moving slightly back to the edge of the dance floor, as Draco stepped his left foot forwards and Harry stepped his backwards, Draco's hand was resting against the small of Harry's back.
"There have been numerous reports about a Manor in Cumbria. Apparently, there is at least one dark artefact in there. Two Muggles have been reported missing in the past week, and the Muggle police have found them standing outside the gate with no memory of how they got there."
"I didn't invite Astoria," Draco replied, crossing his arms. The last time he had spoken to her was after she had shoved her tongue down his throat.
Draco gave his best fake laugh. "It wouldn't upset me if I didn't win," He said as politely as possible, even though he secretly took satisfaction of winning each year.
“I will allow it, as long as it is not interfering with your performance levels, as soon as I get word you have been late for class, not handed in your homework, I will ensure you are pulled off the team and your second will take over.”
"You see?" Draco asked. "I didn't know it was because of you, Blaise told me at his party that he asked me to protect you and he didn't think I would help him if I knew the truth."
They walked up the staircase and down an unused corridor. Draco leaned against a wall one-foot balancing while he bit into his apple, waiting for Potter to ask his question.
Draco’s hands slid round to grip at Harry’s arse, and he whimpered as Harry pushed himself against the head of his cock. Holding Draco's cock steady, Harry lowered himself slowly until he felt the widest part of the head slip inside, and stop. Draco’s fingertips pressed into his bottom cheeks, and Harry saw his chest lift and fall with shallow, quick breaths. His eyes were shut tight as he worked his lips and grunted unintelligibly.
"I am working with Malfoy, no big deal," Harry shouted defensively, then blushed when he realised how he had acted. "Sorry."
They stopped opposite the blank wall, Edwin kicked open one of the doors and frowned when he saw a bedroom. He moved on to the next one and again another bedroom. After he got to the storeroom, he turned to look at Draco.
He didn't know whether to move his chair closer to Ernie or closer to Malfoy. He slyly tilted his head to see who Malfoy was sitting next to; it wasn't a girl, it was Zacharias Smith, the blonde Hufflepuff that was a member of his D. A club, who he and Ron didn't like that much. He wondered if his date had stood him up or there was a mix up on the seating chart.
Harry stared at the picture of him, and Draco sat in the Ministry courtroom; it was a caught off guard picture of the two of them smiling and whispering. Draco had written "Perfect picture", but the whole of the article had been circled and words of disgust at the poll.
After falling asleep on the sofa, he was rudely awoken by a constant pecking on his left hand. A beautiful black Owl with a letter attached to his leg was in front of him. "You should really get some etiquette lessons for when a person is sleeping." He told the owl while he grabbed the letter from its extended leg.
"I would make him pay," Draco said through gritted teeth. "I would make him regret ever uttering those words."
They decided it was best to leave out Draco's momentary relapse, as he shouldn't have snuck into the ministry and they didn't want to have to explain how he had got in.
Harry and Ron explained what they had said to Kingsley and his reaction to it all, also how Draco had basically blackmailed him, which Draco received a hard hit on the arm from Hermione.
Ron was excused from retraining and thanked with the Head Auror promotion for his involvement in getting Nott safely locked up in Azkaban.
"I lost control somewhere over Birmingham, luckily I was flying lower and had my wand otherwise I would probably have ended up in St Mungo's," Harry said wincing when Draco felt the graze on his cheek.
Morning, hope you slept well, I have to go to work on my case now, so I don't know what time I will be back, Kinglsey wants you to go to the Ministry at your earliest convenience, his words not mine, there's also lasagne in the fridge if you find yourself hungry.
Mr Weasley was holding up some sort of poster when Draco was standing in the doorway, ready to knock on the open door. Mr Weasley had looked up as Draco's fist was just inches away.
"I'm fine, thank you," Draco said holding his hand in front of the third spoonful of mash Mrs Weasley held over his plate.
There was clapping and sobbing after Draco had finished his Vows which put a lot of pressure on Harry's shoulders he hadn't really prepared anything he was just going to wing it.
"No, I like to know who I am working with," Malfoy smirked, then carried on searching his area of the floor in the room.
Harry chuckled with them and gave them both a warm hug. "Thanks, we are going to have that guys night soon I promise."
Harry shot up holding his wand tightly in front of him "Draco?" He croaked squinting slightly as he saw the blonde stagger into view. "What are you doing here?"
"I thought since you were never going to take me for lunch, I would join you for some lunch instead," Blaise grinned taking a lunch box out of his bag. "And also show you today's paper," He handed him a folded up copy of the daily prophet and gave him a nervous smile.
Malfoy scraped his chair back and walked over to him, Harry thought he was going to make fun of him or kick him down as he tried to get back up, but instead, he put one hand out and helped him stand, shaking his head with a smirk on his face.
Draco was hesitantly pacing up and down the hallway in front of his father's office; he needed to pull himself together and just get it over with. He paused in front of the door and the held his hand over the handle as if to grab it, then began pacing again, muttering and cursing himself.
An Auror walked to the Malfoys, and Narcissa began sobbing harder. "My son. I need to stay with my boy," she wailed.
Harry stood in the mirror looking at himself in his new suit; he didn't feel as confident in it now, maybe it was because he realised it was because he had to go with Ernie Macmillan or perhaps because he saw Malfoy had pulled it off better than he did. Then the thought of Malfoy pulling off his suit popped into his head making him curse himself. He hadn't thought about Malfoy in many years, and now after one run in with him, he can't get him out of his head.
“Oh where are my manners?”  Corelian asked.  “Corelian Anilus Laitannen, Supreme Lord of the Circle of Atlantis at your service.  And this is my wife, Lady Asheera Liana Lasinius-Laitannen.”
Rowena nodded and asked, “I should very much like to meet them, Ryan; especially this Matthew and his boyfriend Oliver.  Am I correct in assuming that Draco is not related to me?”
“Yes, well, Salazar didn’t intend to give Voldemort the chance to turn Earth into the Tenth Hell either,” countered Harry, “but it is what might happen, nonetheless.  My point in this, Godric, is that your feud with Salazar has come at a very high price for many, many people and ultimately it might mean the destruction of not only the Wizarding world but also the Muggle world.  Don’t you think it’s time that you end it?”
“Then you may have given Colin permission without realizing it,” Zach said.  “Helga told me to always make sure to specify people’s names, because if I didn’t everyone in hearing distance will get permission to enter the room.”
The security wizard placed the wand on the brass device and it began to vibrate.  After a minute, it started to vibrate more and after a minute, it stopped.  Finally, a small strip of parchment came out, which the wizard took and read.
OF COURSE, THEN TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY I HAVE TO FIND OUT FROM THE BLEEDING DAILY PROPHET THAT MY SON IS GAY AND DATING ONE OF HIS STUDENTS, AND NOT JUST ANY STUDENT EITHER, BUT THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN!  HAVE YOU TOTALLY LOST WHAT IS LEFT OF YOUR MIND?  DO YOU THINK I WANT YOUR BOYFRIEND’S RELATIVE YOU-KNOW-WHO COMING TO CHRISTMAS DINNER?
Adrian hesitated for a moment before he nodded and lead the group out of the office and to the front door of the Three Broomsticks.  Wrapping an arm around Hermione’s waist he went into the doorway and said, “When I open the door, conjure your Patronus and I’ll cover you.”
“It’s okay to say it, father,” Alaric said.  “You suggested it while you were having sex.  Oh don’t look so shocked, while it’s true that I was only nine when I died, I’ve learned quite a bit lurking around this castle for the last thousand years and I know all about what people in love do with one another in the privacy of their bedrooms.”
Harry and Ryan nodded and then went over to the massive oak doors that Rowena pointed at and opened them.  Walking inside, they found themselves in a cavernous room filled with bookshelves.  Walking over to the fireplace, Ryan quickly lit the fire to provide more light and then looked up at Rowena’s portrait.  She smiled and said, “Welcome Ryan, Harry, to my private library.”
“Translate?”  Vaisey asked a clear note of suspicion in his voice.  “Why does Delaney have to translate the recipe?”
As interesting as it was listening to his ancestors talking to one another, when by all rights he shouldn’t be able to, Ryan did have a question that was burning in his mind.
“Other house elves and I start immediately, Harry Potter, sir,” Dobby said, as he popped out for a moment, before popping back in, followed by about ten more house-elves, who immediately went to work cleaning Godric’s common room before moving on to the other rooms.
The kiss lasted for several minutes, before Matt broke away and began to kiss his way down Oliver's sleek and toned body. Starting at the tip of his right shoulder blade, Matt kissed his way across to the left, before moving down a bit and planting a kiss on Oliver's left nipple, taking a moment to swirl his tongue around on it.
Well, today has certainly been a long day.  I simply cannot fathom how deluded Pansy was earlier.  She simply refused to acknowledge that I’m gay, even after I kissed Blaise in front of her.  I’m very thankful that Blaise was willing to play along, because if he hadn’t been, I would have had an even harder time convincing Pansy that I’m gay.
Aarik returned the blond’s grin, before lunging at him.  The two boys were soon wrapped tightly in each other’s arms, as their lips sealed so tightly that an onlooker wouldn’t be able to tell where Draco’s lips ended and Aarik’s began.
"Shut up, no excuses!  You're a pureblood and she's a mudblood.  You're superior to her, and it should be you who's the number one student in your year."
"It is never as long as one might wish, mortal," Valshar said.  "You would be wise to remember that.  Now, be gone!"
Following the installation of Godiva’s portrait over the corridor entrance to Godric’s quarters, Harry, who had now decided to go ahead and use the name Aarik, as it was now public knowledge, as much as he wished it wasn’t, invited Draco over to talk privately.
“If I’m right, he’s at the manor,” Draco said.  “That room looks identical to one that Lucius locked me in for two weeks after the end of second year.  He was angry that Hermione had outperformed me in school again and for losing the house-elf Dobby, so he took his anger out on me.  He starved me and used the Cruciatus on me about five times a day.”
“Yes,” Draco answered.  “Dating you breaks about half a dozen rules, but to be perfectly honest, I don’t care.”
As if some divine entity had decided to help Draco, the answer came to him almost as soon as he’d asked the question.  Reaching into the pocket of the Atlantean battle robes that covered the mythril armor that Asheera had given him, Draco pulled out Apollo’s golden Mirror of Truth.
“Well, I wasn’t suggesting you come with me alone,” Corelian explained.  “You’re welcome to bring as many people as you’d like for your own security.  I would need my wand in order to create a Portkey, but you’re welcome to confiscate it again afterwards if it would make you feel better.”
“We’re prefects,” Justin said as he adjusted his robes so that his prefect badge was more clearly visible.
“Oh and Dobby?”  Ryan said before Dobby left, “For the moment at least, I’d prefer that nobody knew about my being the heir or that these rooms exist.  So, please refrain from telling any of the professors and students.  You can tell the other house-elves if you need help cleaning, but that’s it.  Just make sure to tell them about my wish that nobody know for now.”
“I cast the Secret Revealing Charm on him,” Harry said.  “Since Colin thinks he’s entitled to blab everyone else’s secrets to the whole world, the spell I just cast is literally washing his mouth out with soap.  Every time a soap bubble escapes from his mouth, it will pop and reveal a secret that he’s been keeping about himself.”
"Yes, you heard me, young man," Angelique said.  "And don't bother asking me to explain what I meant, because if you don't already know, then you're hopeless."
“To purge the school of all who in his view were unworthy of studying magic,” Hermione said.  “In other words, Muggle-borns like Justin and me.”
"I knew the name Cromwell sounded familiar," Hermione said. "I saw it in the Daily Prophet yesterday. Malfoy has made it his life's work over the last few years to annoy and insult us, but I'm willing to cut him some slack."
Draco had been thinking about who to claim ever since he’d left Atlantis.  He knew that he could claim four people.  Obviously, he’d claim his mum and Aarik’s parents, but what about the fourth?  He’d considered claiming Charles Cromwell, but he didn’t fit the criteria, because he did not die of the Killing Curse.  Eventually he had decided and he now said, “I seek the souls of Narcissa Druella Black-Malfoy, James Nathan Potter, Lily Marie Evans-Potter, and Cedric Jeremiah Diggory.”
“Yes, Pharaoh Khafra CXLVIII (the 148th), he’s the Egyptian equivalent of Minister Scrimgeour, except that he isn’t an elected official.  When he dies, his son Prince Khufu LXIX (the 89th) will become Pharaoh.”
“Yes,” Ryan said as he reached over to the nightstand, grabbed his wand, pointed it at Justin’s mouth and muttered something under his breath.  “Ah, much better, now where were we?”
“She can’t, Nick.  She said that the magic that hid her quarters prevented her from being able to leave them and visit other portraits.  The only way that she could have gone to visit one of the other founder’s portraits is if their heir has found their quarters and thus lifted the protective magic.”
"Albus, what is this about?"  Ollivander asked.  "I have a store to run and it is not my custom to close down in the middle of a work day to bring a selection of wands to Hogwarts."
“Right you are, Minerva,” Corelian said with a smile.  “However, the founders never met an Atlantean and thus the wards erected around this castle do nothing to block Atlantean magic.  It’s not that different from the magic humans use, but it’s different enough that the wards can’t block it.  How do you think Asheera and I got past them the night of the Halloween Ball?  Albus was able to detect that the wards were being breached, but he couldn’t do anything about it.”
“We discussed that,” Bill said, “and we weren’t ready for the whole school, let alone the whole Wizarding World, to know that we were together.  Up until now, only a select few of Nick’s friends knew that we were together.  I haven’t told anyone in my family yet and Nick hasn’t told his grandmother, either.”
"That's right," Harry said. "Bill told me all about that. Fleur was convinced that he was her mate, so she was using her powers on him all the time, because he wasn't being as receptive as she would have liked. She finally gave up the idea that he was her mate after all of the tests were done because they determined that he was most definitely not her mate; a fact which he would have made perfectly clear if he had been in his right mind at the time, since he is very much so gay. You can trust me when I say that considering how many times we've, um, had sex."
"Fifty years?"  Kingsley Shacklebolt asked.  "Forgive me, Albus, but as Molly said, he looks like he can't be much older than sixteen.  How could he be a prisoner for fifty years?"
The heirs themselves had no problems giving their professors permission to enter the rooms; however, they didn’t really want to give them all permission to open the entrances.  In the end, Salazar suggested that the heirs leave the hallway entrance to the quarters open and then have a portrait installed over the doorway.  Then anyone with permission would be able to get into the room anytime they needed to, as long as they knew the password to get past the portrait.
"Well, Harry, I've been fighting with the Ministry for the last month," Dumbledore answered. "Sirius' estate has been ready for division under the terms of his will since the beginning of the month, but the Ministry has been doing everything they could to block it from happening. Unfortunately, Peter Pettigrew remains at large, so Cornelius is still refusing to believe that Sirius was innocent of the crimes he'd been accused of in life. I think we all know how difficult Minister Fudge can be, correct?"
“Mr. Filch gather the rest of the staff,” Dumbledore said urgently.  “I don’t know if we’re under attack, but I want to be prepared if we are.”
“I didn’t know, either, Rufus, until recently,” Dumbledore said.  “It seems that the founders’ portraits were all in their private living quarters.  Only their heirs are capable of entering them and giving others permission to do so, so it was not known that the founders’ portraits existed until each heir was found and in turn found their portraits.”
"We figured this would come up," James replied, before he began explaining to the group what the afterlife entailed, with occasional comments thrown in by Lily, Narcissa, and Cedric.  After that, the meeting wound down, before finally Dumbledore dismissed everyone, with the warning to stay sharp in the coming days, for he feared it was only a matter of time before Voldemort would reveal his true nature to the world and put his plans into high gear.
