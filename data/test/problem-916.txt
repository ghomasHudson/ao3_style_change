He’d killed someone, and she was trying to comfort him.
“I overheard someone talking about it today,” he said after a short pause, trying to invent some reason that didn’t involve him lurking under a window, eavesdropping on the Minister for Magic. “Sounded…interesting.”
When Andromeda and Teddy were gone and Bill had taken a seat on the couch beside Harry, Robards set his tea down and leaned forward, folding his hands together with his thumbs steepled up. All at once the somber old man regained the steely demeanor of the Head Auror. He took out a sharp black quill and a pad of paper, and set it down. It was a quick quotes quill.
“We—we’ve never been on the best of terms,” Harry said quickly, embarrassed to have to explain a stupid childhood rivalry. “I’ve known his father was a death eater since the night Voldemort returned, and Draco had never exactly been quiet about his family’s—darker inclinations. I noticed he was acting strange on the Hogwarts Express and over the course of the year came to be understand he was working on something for Voldemort.”
“Don’t go,” Harry gasped, stepping forward. He reached out and caught lean arms, slender shoulders, the edge of a soft, unbuttoned collar. “Don’t go. Stay.”
Harry said nothing for a long time. He saw in her eyes when the intensity shifted, when the last hope she’d been holding onto died.
The ground shifted as an explosion rocked the castle. He fell back, reaching out—and something grabbed his hand.
The auror blinked. “Er. Well. You know what I mean.”
Robards hummed low in thought. “We have reason to believe that Goyle was under the effect of some kind of toxin or substance which enhances certain abilities. We’ve still got people identifying it, but it might explain his heightened strength and his mania. We’re not sure, yet, but our working theory is it’s a concoction meant to mimic the effects of lycanthropy. In a small way, of course.”
He glanced from Kingsley to Robards. “If the investigation is over, I’d… Well, I think it might help if I knew something. I guess.”
His mouth dropped open as a shiver of delight fizzled through him. As
The final green light of
everything he had left. That his ultimate utility was just to die. That his life was worth nothing unless it was being taken.
Kreacher rocked back and forth on his little bony feet, the movement so reminiscent of Dobby it made Harry’s chest hurt. He hummed in consideration, one hand reaching up to clutch at the fake locket Regulus Black had swapped for the horcrux while the other patted his eyes dry with the corner of his clean pillow case. “Master is wanting to organize?”
in his stomach. He didn’t know if it was nausea or arousal but it made him want to crawl out of his skin. He tripped into the bathroom and sat under the cold torrent of his shower for a long while, remaking himself one shiver at a time.
“This is the
“You were in the Ministry of Magic, Harry.” Ron laughed darkly. “You could have eviscerated him and people would understand.”
I've been having a bit of a time of things the past few months. I live in the US and everything is currently on fire. It's been a bit of a struggle to find time to write and my energy has gotten sucked into other things like figuring out how to make money now lol.
Recognition was on the tip of his tongue. He drew upright, opened his eyes—
Hermione let out a sharp laugh. “I’m sure you do.”
Harry did not comment that he knew that very well, having been nearly convicted of a crime while being underage, in this very building. Of course, back then he had been nearly thrown in jail just for conjuring a patronus in front of his cousin. The circumstances were a bit different.
wanted the same. Back when he saw her in the Room of Requirement it was all he could do not to bury himself in her hair and breath her warmth and life in but now he… He didn’t know what he felt. His emotions kept stalling, getting waylaid and shuffled as his brain processed the events of the last twenty-four hours.
“Course. I don’t exactly have a full schedule,” he added, looking again at Kingsley.
Harry slid his hands into his pockets, riding high on a sick rush that made him almost jittery.
He was quiet long enough for Malfoy to look down and meet his gaze.
He retreated into himself, where there was nothing but anger and loss. A wide open cavern filled with hateful things just below the dark surface. All the sounds and noise and flashing swarmed around him, pressed in on him, but remained muted and distant. It felt, oddly, like the first few moments after he’d brought Cedric’s body back to Hogwarts. Lights and color, music flaring up as people cheered and laughed and clapped before they saw the truth. And him lying on the ground with his arm cut open and his hand clutching a dead boy’s wrist.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, relieved. “Yeah. I didn’t mean anything by it, I swear.” He didn’t know if he was talking to the house at this point or Kreacher, but maybe there wasn’t really a difference.
Harry watched the efficient movement of his fingers as they pulled on the glossy leather, remembering what Malfoy’s hand had looked like trembling around his wand in the Astronomy Tower, it’s solidity when facing off against his aunt. He wondered, suddenly, if Malfoy really had chucked the hawthorn wand, or if it was hidden up his sleeve right now. Or why he cared.
When it was done and they were lying next to each other in the silence, he waited, desperately wishing that that feeling would click into place. For him to know, finally, that he wanted this, that he wanted her, because he would be mad not to, right? After everything, to come out of the war with nothing…
He slipped his glasses off and pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes, bending over and allowing himself a small groan. Maybe he would just leave. Chance a walk outside to clear his head. He could meet Bill and the others later when he felt more sociable. He didn’t know how the fuck he was supposed to just sit here—
It was all still there. The posters, the records, the clothes and the trunks and the broken quills and crinkled toffee wrappers. Cigarette butts sat in the stained glass dish on the bedside table—an heirloom, had to be, it was crystal, and Sirius would have gotten a kick out of using something that valuable as a glorified bin—and the blanket Harry had curled up in that first night back here only a month ago was still stretched across the foot of the four poster bed, gold and red and threadbare.
“Right. I’ll take your word for it.” Harry cleared his throat, silently accepting that he didn’t want to know why Luna knew what spark plugs tasted like. “I, uh, wouldn’t know anything about buzzsprites.”
There was the sound of a glass being set down gently on a table. A silence Harry could feel even outside the house.
His eyes flicked to Harry and held.
At the end of the hallway a door opened and a tall, thick man with white hair and a face hewn from granite stepped out and spotted Harry and Bill. “Mr. Potter.”
A girl stood a few feet away from them, hands primly folded in front of her immaculate robes, large eyes moving between him and Hermione. At first he didn’t recognize her—her hair was a lighter shade of brown, longer too. Her freckles weren’t as prominent.
“He told me to come in for a talk.”
Harry told him everything, trying to be as detailed as possible, though he choked and stumbled on the actual killing. Now that he was feeling closer to normal, the reality of what he’d done hit him.
If felt more like he’d been given a gift.
He snatched off his glasses and pressed the heels of his palms to his eyes, pain-prick lights erupting against the black of his eyelids. He clenched his jaw to stop what little there was left inside him from spilling out and setting the floor, the mirror, himself on fire. Setting it all on fire.
Just like Voldemort had marked him. Twice marked by death, once by murder.
The guilt Harry had been waiting for returned with a vengeance. How long had she been listening?
Unbidden, from the dark recesses of his mind, came the Sorting Hat’s soft, whispered words.
Robards cleared his throat. Harry looked up after a moment, when he was sure his face was blank, distant.
This was the last day of trials. The last day of walking into the Ministry and looking into the eyes of the actual monsters who were to blame for the war, the death eaters who’d killed people he loved and the Ministry officials who’d stood there and watched, then he was done. He wouldn’t have to walk through the mob of journalists and photographers every morning. He wouldn’t have to listen to all the horrible details recounted again and again, listen to the names of the dead, the lists of atrocities committed against muggleborns and anyone who stood up for them or against Voldemort.
Also, for all my fellow Americans: STAY HOME. WEAR A FUCKING MASK IF YOU GO OUT. And you know what,
He answered her questions along with a few from the other members of the Wizengamot—simple, really, nothing he hadn’t already answered more than once with Robards, Kamau, and Proulx. Only the first and last were present in the room, Robards sitting to his far right at the edge of the curved benches, while Proulx was top left. Throughout, Harry managed to keep his voice level, his answers short and simple. He didn’t rise to the condescending remarks from Yeats, tame enough to ignore for now. He didn’t shout at anyone. All in all, he thought he was doing a great job, all things considered. He couldn’t help but feel like Umbridge was going to walk in here with her tinkling laugh and her cold, dead eyes, trailing a dementor in her wake.
That’s what Neville had said about the Carrows. First years. There had to have been some Slytherins who objected.
he was. The Malfoy he’d known for seven bloody years. It was almost a relief. Some things would never change, and Malfoy’s petty cruelty was one of them.
because we couldn’t
Grimmauld Place might be lonely and quiet, but it was safe. Or, as safe as Harry was ever going to get. Leaving would mean reentering the world where he’d alienated and hurt his friends and insulted an entire government, reentering the world where he was a killer, twice over. Where he still didn’t know what he was going to do or what he wanted. Once he stepped into the fire he would be confronted with the fact that he didn’t know who he was supposed to be anymore. That he had no bloody idea where to even begin.
Of course the next moment he had tried to cast the Cruciatus Curse on Harry but considering what he did in retaliation…
A drop of water fell into the still pool of his mind. The echo spread, rippling, and then it was all stillness once more.
He saw it now. They were all waiting for him to lose it. Thought it was inevitable.
Now that he was out here on his own, he realized how thoroughly he had just
Harry had nothing. Becoming an auror had been his path, he’d never thought about anything else. He didn’t think he was good for anything else besides fighting dark wizards and helping people. That’s all he was, really.
Kreacher walked up next to him, hopping up onto an empty ledge to get a better look. “Kreacher is not knowing…”
“The fuck is this about, Harry? Why does Bill seem to know more about whatever the hell is going on with you than I do?”
The world wrapped and warped around that smile until Harry felt like it was the only thing that ever mattered, until he could see nothing else, but he didn’t have time to panic before he was being squeezed through space. Within a second the pain completely wiped his brain of all thought.
“I’m upset, you see,” he said forcefully, “because I’ve witnessed this kind of thing before. Kids being used as collateral to make sure their parents behaved and fell in line. You know who else did that?
Harry choked on a sob and turned, trying to dislodge the thing working its way up his throat. He clutched both sides of the sink, knuckles white. His head dropped as he shook with the effort of holding back a scream.
Harry read the pages describing how to safeguard one’s horcrux against destruction, how to prepare oneself for the murder, but there wasn’t much on the theory behind it, and the book said very little about what happened to the vessel when a horcrux was put into it. There was no mention of what might happen to a living person.
In the silence as she considered him, he had the horrible realization that Luna was quite close to Ginny. It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to think Ginny had confided in her about their night of sad, disappointing sex. The pathetic coda to a relationship which had been crawling on by a string.
So he did. He couldn’t not, when the sound of that word in this voice made something fragile in him break. And in the cracks there was fire. Heat poured into him, electric and burning, reigniting his blood and making him
“I’ve heard good things, Mr. Potter. Very good things. After this nasty business is done, feel free to visit my office any time you like. We’re in need of fresh blood and you’ve got a few fans there already, as well as a personal recommendation from the Minister for Magic himself.” Robards didn’t smile but his face seemed to lose its stony edge. “Shacklebolt was one of the best aurors I ever trained. If he says you’re good, you must be extraordinary.”
His conflict took a sharp turn into fully-fledged outrage.
He didn’t add that he
“Do you know why Goyle decided to target you, Harry?” Robards asked. “Beyond his belief that you were somehow responsible for his friend’s death, and Mr. Malfoy’s abandonment.”
Harry didn’t smile, but he was grateful for the attempt at humor. Before he could leave, though, he was waylaid by a suddenly distressed toddler, eyes big and green and growing wet as he watched Harry leaving. “I’m coming back, Teds,” he said, throat tight. “Here.” He shrugged out of the jacket, draping it over the boy’s shoulders. It swamped him, but Teddy seemed mollified for the moment. He’d forgotten how much he liked the taste of it, anyway. Harry smoothed down Teddy’s hair where it’d gotten mussed from his exploration of the ground. It’d gotten darker since Harry’d arrived. Strands of black joined in with the turquoise, and it was all Harry could do not to lose it entirely.
The small envelope was a soft robin’s egg blue. He opened it carefully, wondering if it might be a howler, hoping she at least wanted him to explain. She’d lost her family to the war. She’d have more cause than most to think what he was doing was wrong.
He hadn’t dreamed anything clear enough to know he was actually
“The boy’s always been special.”
“It’s not that cut and dry,” Kamau said, her big black eyes studying him closely. “But yes, essentially. We dealt with something similar back in the States in the 80’s. Potions meant to replicate lycanthropy, vampirism, even a few folks trying to grow themselves wings. Didn’t work out well for them, I’m afraid. I have a bit of experience in this field, so I was asked to consult by Mr. Robards. Hope that’s okay,” she added with a comforting smile.
“What do you want me to say?”
“Right, it is.” Felicity looked like she was holding herself back from asking anything more, as if she saw Harry’s expression and realized he wasn’t in a sharing mood. “Unlike fiendfyre, though, the caster has a very small window of opportunity to reverse the spread, to pull it back into themselves. Fiendfyre will burn for a long time, but it will stop, eventually, once it runs out of fuel. This curse doesn’t have the same limitations. The last recorded incident occurred in 1605, when an entire island in the Hebrides disintegrated and vanished into the ocean, along with the fifteen hundred people who lived on it.” She fiddled with her glasses, skin gone pale. “I can’t even imagine what it might have done here, in London. The level of destruction—”
It was grotesque, and Harry couldn’t look away.
His eyes flicked to Malfoy, narrowing. “Sorry about this one. He can’t keep his slimy mouth shut most of the time. But that’s a death eater for you, isn’t it? Thinking they’re smarter and better than everyone else even after they lost, the bleeding snakes. If he’s been bothering you, I’ll make sure he gets his. Don’t you worry.”
They had gone slow when they were dating in school, so slow one might say that they went nowhere at all, Ginny only being fifteen when they got together, and Harry having about as much sexual experience as a turnip—bit of over the clothes groping, some quickly-stifled heat when Ginny shifted on his lap and his cock decided to get up and cheer for her. At the time it had felt like they were building up to something, increasing the anticipation with every kiss by the lake or brush of her hand against his.
When he was able, he lifted his head.
“Well, yeah. This old bat was trying to shove her grandson on me and Malfoy scared her off.”
Harry spent the days after Ron left searching through the stacks, looking for something to occupy his time.
Harry stared down at his hands. His right was still wrapped in linen, numb and swollen. His left was trembling. He felt Andromeda’s stare but he couldn’t look up. He couldn’t see the fear in her eyes, fear
Harry startled, getting ketchup on his t-shirt when he bumped his plate and one of the sausages made a break for freedom. He shook his head, trying to think of nothing at all. “Ah. No. Sorry, Kreacher, I think I’m full.”
When Kingsley spoke, his voice vibrated it was so low. “It’s not your fault, Harry. Gregory Goyle’s death was an accident.”
She paused, taking a breath, composure wavering. “You are also poisoned, Harry. I won’t be able to treat any of the other injuries until I purge the poison, but unfortunately you have to remain conscious because I need to maintain this map of your body to monitor the spread of the poison to make sure the antidote is working. I can’t put you under yet. Luckily, the poison seems to be rather generic, so a general antidote should do it, but it is necessarily thorough, and it isn’t gentle. You’re going to be in a lot of pain. Do you understand me, Harry?”
Yeats’s nostrils flared. She cut a glance to Kingsley beside her, but he remained silent. With what looked like a great amount of effort, she schooled her features smooth. “You are approaching a line you do not want to cross, Mr. Potter. The Ministry of Magic is not interested in having any one person, no matter how influential, dictate national policy.”
“Don’t you have somewhere else you can go?” Harry asked sharply, hating that Malfoy’d got it in one. “Perhaps on another continent? I hear Hawaii is nice. There’s a few volcanoes you could throw yourself in.”
Harry stared at Kingsley, the world around him growing sharp and cutting. His mind was quiet like the moment before a storm broke. He smelled rust and fire—the disdain sitting like petrichor on his tongue. It would kill him, would it?
“About the Elder Wand? Obviously,” Malfoy spat, his face hard and haunted.
Harry was staring, heart in his throat, sweat beading on his temples.
Harry stared at the page for a long time, thinking through the ramifications of having a shield charm permanently fixed to your body. The level of control you’d need to keep that kind of magic up long term was daunting. But maybe it was like Occlumency, where a true master was able to block someone else out even when they were sleeping. It just took time and work, and perhaps an inherent ability to cast defensive magic.
“What about Gringotts?”
Harry nodded, watching the auror from before meet Malfoy by the lifts. “Yeah. They asked me about him today. Told me he was turning on his pals, or their parents, anyway.” He winced. “I wasn’t supposed to tell you that.”
Blood magic was old and untaught at Hogwarts. He’d heard it mentioned once or twice by Snape in sixth year, but other than asides meant to make everyone feel like they knew nothing, Harry had assumed it was too dangerous to be taught to kids. This didn’t
Harry stared at the box for a long time, a weird sense of familiarity settling over him, like he’d seen this box before, when he knew for a fact he hadn’t. He’d never seen anything like this.
wasn’t it? And Kingsley had trusted him, just like Remus had trusted him, just like all of them.
“Anyway,” he said without grace, trying not to look troubled, “you were talking about your family in Lagos. Your parents want you to go?”
The bandages had come off yesterday when Bill pronounced him functionally fine. He’d come straight from Andromeda, apparently, who had given him the all clear after one more course of Skele-Gro. Bill had, mercifully, left soon after, sensing Harry’s need to spend the next year unconscious in an attempt to make up for all the sleep he’d lost, but only once Bill had agreed to leave him alone until the investigation was through. He wasn’t going to have Bill or Andromeda stopping by when there was still a chance someone would come looking for him. Maybe Harry just looked that crazed, but Bill had relented. He told Harry to try to get some sleep. By the time Harry finally threw himself into the bed on the far side of the room he’d shared with Ron during fifth year, made up in clean sheets he was pretty sure he’d had no hand in preparing, he was starting to go well and truly mad.
Andromeda said nothing, but her hug was almost too firm. She gave him one more cursory look over before she let him go. Almost like she couldn’t help it, she smoothed back his hair and gave his cheek a gentle pat, concern flickering like a flash of lightning behind the dark grey of her eyes.
Her husband, however, looked like a stiff breeze would send him sprawling. Lucius Malfoy used to be nothing but unctuous charm and easy, confident superiority—something his son had never managed to achieve, despite his attempts. Not anymore, though. Lucius was nearly unrecognizable. His whole demeanor had changed. Actually, Lucius reminded Harry of Wormtail in the Shrieking Shack moments after he had been forced back into his human form. He had the same panicked light to his eyes, the same pallid sheen, white hair wispy and disheveled twitchiness—all his class and smiling cruelty gone now his master was dead. He was just a scared old man who had been forced out into the light.
“Make sure he doesn’t move.” She flicked her wand in short, precise movements, liquids and ingredients combining and then separating into streams which swirled in the air. It was beautiful and precise.
“Yeah, there are—er,” Harry hesitated, feeling acutely the eyes of both Robards and Kingsley on him, “so muggles sometimes put small figurines at the front of their car that sort of—wiggle, when they drive. It’s kind of a joke, I think.”
But the tears didn’t come. He didn’t cry. His grief felt like it belonged to someone else, trapped behind a glass wall where he could look at it but he couldn’t claim it. In a detached kind of morbidity, he wondered if he had at last lost enough people for it not to touch him anymore. Fred, Tonks, Remus—maybe they’d pushed him over the edge. Or maybe some part of him had broken when Voldemort tried to kill him. That piece of Voldemort’s soul taking with it the last of his humanity when Voldemort died for good. Maybe he had broken it himself when he’d killed Voldemort.
drag him under.
could barely understand what he was feeling. He didn’t know how to explain the anger and doubt and resentment without explaining everything, and he couldn’t bear the thought of Hermione’s reaction when she heard what he was, what he’d always been. The longer he sat with it, the less he wanted to tell anyone. The harder it became to imagine Ron or Hermione not looking at him in pity or fear. Not knowing one more thing that made him different, strange. It didn’t matter anymore. Voldemort was dead. It seemed like an unnecessary burden to hand to his friends after everything they’d been through.
- "Savior" by Thirty Seconds to Mars
He was sore, but no more sore than after a grueling quidditch game. In fact he could recall more than one practice when Wood was still captain when he’d woken the next day to wonder if his bones all hadn’t started screaming and his flesh had been replaced with poorly glued on parchment.
“I think that’s a good idea. Go…have a nap, or something.”
Harry didn’t know how to answer, so he just crossed his arms, trying not to shiver too much from the exertion of standing. Circe’s tits, he was tired. Maybe he should have postponed this for a time he didn’t feel like collapsing to the floor and never getting back up.
He didn’t sleep, he didn’t want to—his dreams would be filled with the sigh of Goyle’s lifeless body. The time drifted as he listened to the quiet sounds of the house and the world outside. A tap turning on and off. A soft shuffle of feet. Birds chirping somewhere outside. A car spluttered on, pulling out of a garage what sounded like a few houses down.
Kingsley, they’re
A small trill rumbled in Fawkes’s throat, and he left. In a flash of fire and light, he flew out into the sky, disappearing behind a cloud bank on the other side of the lake.
Harry watched her gather up blood-stained cloths and a very empty vials, cleaning the floor with a wave of her wand before retreating to the kitchen. The sounds of her putting the kettle on seemed magnified in the sudden silence.
“I think,” he started slowly, “that Draco didn’t realize what he’d gotten himself into. I think he found out the hard way that he wasn’t up to the same level of cruelty he liked to mess around with as a kid. I don’t know.”
Even if the longer he spent inside this building, the more he was wondering
he exhaled, bracing himself on the chair to keep his balance. How long had he been up here? He started shaking too, like he was getting a cold, pulses of aching heat rippling under his skin as he blinked his vision clear.
“I—” He frowned. “I don’t really know how to answer that, Luna.”
It took longer for the blood to catch this time. Harry felt the slight tug too, where he’d been too startled to feel it before. It was like a string attached to his…everything, or his mind, the sensation of himself as a thing separate from the rest of the world—it was drawing out something inside of him, and he could sense that he
Andromeda’s jaw clenched and she looked as if she might refuse. The look reminded him so much of Madam Pomfrey he felt oddly sentimental.
Bill eyed the bracelet with alarm. “That a—family heirloom?” His expression faltered for a moment, presumably stumbling over Grimmauld Place. Right. That was going to need some explaining today as well.
at the Minister for Magic, accused the Wizengamot of being cowards. They were, and Kingsley deserved that much and more if he really had stood back and let Harry take the fall for him, but…
He took a deep breath and braced himself, then he opened his eyes. It was dark, all sound muffled. The air was cold, but not overly so. It smelled of damp earth and old stone.
“Is that what Hermione told you?”
her. I cracked it, yeah, because it was pretty fucking obvious you’d ditched her and didn’t want to talk about it. I was going to bring it up after the trials were over, because I guessed even then that you were gearing up to go mental.”
He found a potions book focusing on Eastern European recipes and ingredients, outlining the history behind each potion and the more notable potioneers. Under a pile of decaying newspapers, the charms on the front long gone dead so the images were stationary, he found a box which contained three books bound in white leather, with embossed engravings of an eye, an ear, and a mouth, respectively. The first two he recognized the moment he opened the books—tomes on the study of Occlumency and Legilimency. The third he’d never heard of—Potensimency. Presumably it was related to manipulating the mind and thoughts of either yourself or someone else, but he didn’t bother sitting down to read more than a few pages. He’d never been able to do the other two, so he figured this would be beyond him as well. He kept them, though, in the growing pile of books on the small table just inside the attic, next to the history books and the books on magical artifacts and, to his continuing shame, the old erotica. Out of curiosity, presumably. Sure.
He had to let someone know. He couldn’t—he
He’d never particularly cared what clothes he wore—he was still a bit thrilled by the fact that he could buy his own clothes, ones which didn’t drown him. And it was a mark of how much he’d been eating that these jeans were almost a bit too tight round the hips. One day he might actually stop looking like a scrawny, starved kid. Maybe that was something he could deal with while he sorted out the rest of his life. And Sirius’s closet was still full, so…
than them. We’re not supposed to treat them like they treated us or it’ll never end and all of this bullshit will keep happening! Kids will keep dying and breaking and no one will care! How can you not
“Sorry,” Harry muttered, letting his eyes close for a second. “Been a shite day.”
Malfoy was watching him, an unreadable expression turning his eyes hard and bright. Harry couldn’t wipe away the image of Malfoy facing Dumbledore, Malfoy crying in the bathroom, Malfoy torturing Rowle, Malfoy in a sea of flame.
one of my siblings
“I’m warning you, Harry, if you don’t—”

“Wait, Robards—the
Harry held his breath.
He wasn’t moving.
But that had been over two years ago. Harry’d been a different person then.
Harry stared at the rug between his bare feet, counting the rings of rough-spun wool where they looped over one another—orange to red to brown to mauve and then back to orange, all of it spiraling in a uniform, constricting oval. It was faded and worn through. Well-loved.
Harry’s jaw clenched. How nice of him.
“I came here for
“And for what it’s worth, I don’t think Draco would have gone through with it.”
His attention caught on the box, because where there had been a simple gold lock there was now faint, dark red light. Slowly, a line of glowing red spread out from the center of the lock, illuminating the grooves and seams of the wood. It crawled up to the surface where, Harry watched in growing fascination, the outline of a tree appeared as…his blood drew it into being. The tree was large, stately, a thick trunk separating into two sections from which the rest of the branches spread. The pattern ended on a symbol nestled in the roots. Some kind of rune, maybe, or—
Fucking
“Come on, girls,” she shouted, dancing expertly out of the way of Hannah’s Body-Bind Curse, deflecting Luna’s attempt to disarm her. Ginny clutched at her arm where a fresh gash was leaking blood, face screwed up in pain, wand swinging wildly. “Let’s see which one of you—”
for sure. There was no way to know.
Malfoy looked away, waving a hand dismissively through the air. “I can practically hear you thinking I’m a hypocrite.”
Harry had to take a break that night, turning up the wireless as loud as it could go and pacing in an attempt to get Malfoy’s pale, shaking reflection out of his head.
“If you say so,” Harry said, disliking the way there was something amused in his blue eyes.
He hummed as he gripped himself, sliding down his shaft slowly and thumbing the head, hissing when he ran the side of a nail across his slit. He didn’t do this often, for some reason. Maybe he’d thought it was indulgent or something. Or maybe it was that lingering religious fear his aunt had tried to hammer into him every Sunday—that was, before he’d turned eight and they’d had to switch churches because the pastor had noticed Harry one day and asked Petunia why he looked so sickly and small when his cousin practically oozed excessive health.
He was out before the sun rose, waking a very disgruntled Ron the morning Hermione was due back to ask how he’d bought his flat. Before lunch he took the first place the agent showed him—a small two-bedroom on the top floor of a wizards-only building one street over from St. Andrew’s Gardens. Flustered and still doing a poor job of not ogling Harry’s scar, the agent asked if he wanted to purchase something called the All-Inclusive Furnishings Package. Harry was barely listening, so he just nodded and agreed, anything to hurry the whole business along so he didn’t think too hard about the fact that he was
Kingsley rose to his feet, drawing Harry’s gaze. He was having a hard time breathing. He was slipping, his mind warping at the edges as flashes and sparks swarmed around him, explosions and jets of green light, a wall of orange fire—
The moment Harry had killed him.
“From
No. Not…
And they were putting these things on
He was a chaser on the Slytherin team when Harry was in sixth year. He was young but he was good. Harry remembered thinking he would turn into a great player one day, despite his natural aversion to anyone who came from Slytherin. Harry tried to construct an image of the kid but he couldn’t remember anything other than a head of black hair and the lanky limbs of a boy coming off his first growth spurt.
Harry fought the urge to laugh.
Having nowhere else to go, Harry agreed to stay with the Weasleys when Molly and Arthur offered, meaning Molly sat him down and told him in no uncertain terms that he was going to stay with them whether he wanted to or not. Right away, though, Harry felt weird.
A flash of white cut through the haze around him and he remembered the promise he’d made himself never to welcome his death again.
Harry kept frowning at Malfoy, but the asshole didn’t even look at him. He was just staring at the old woman, brow raised as if to question why she was still standing there.
Harry paused with his new drink halfway to his lips, distracted by the lines of muscle that appeared in Charlie’s upper arm when he rested it on the table. “Er, that’d be odd, since I never tried for it and don’t even know who the coach is. Maybe you’re thinking of a different Harry Potter.”
He threw a few orbs of light into the air, as if lighting the interior of his empty apartment was going to help him calm down.
But that option was gone now. Harry had blown it spectacularly to pieces. He’d alienated his friends and the people who trusted him. He’d provoked the Ministry,
“You’re getting better. If only you weren’t such a coward, you might become something one day.”
A shadow passed over the courtyard followed closely by a swift breeze. Dust and smoke cleared where they’d obscured Malfoy’s face.
Harry’s mind was ripped backwards in time to the smell of burning, the shrieking of thousands of horrible voices as a wave of fire surged through the Room of Requirement, it was so hot the air shivered all around him and he couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t see, and all he could hear was this distant cry of panic, turning on his brook before he knew what he was—
Harry felt himself tense all over, staring down at the ground and willing himself to walk away. He didn’t want to hear other people talking about him. He didn’t want to know what they thought of him, especially not when it sounded like this was a recurring conversation.
“Good!” Ron reached over and clapped him on the shoulder. “There’s your career sorted, then. Hermione, how does it feel to be the one who isn’t prepared for once?”
This apparently was news to Robards, his brow furrowing sharply. “We have testimony from Draco Malfoy that there was no one present in the tower except for the persons later identified as Alecto Carrow, Fenrir Greyback, Severus Snape, and Albus Dumbledore himself.”
“The important thing,” Percy said as they walked out into level nine, “is that you’re as thorough as you can be. You never know when some small detail might lead to a conviction, or a pardon.”
And in that silence and stillness the anger he’d been holding, coiled and tense in the pit of his stomach, caught flame.
It didn’t change anything. Love hadn’t saved Harry. It’d brought him back to life, maybe, but it hadn’t saved him.
Harry stared at Robards, chest tight as he realized the old man would have known Tonks well, almost as well as Kingsley.
He considered more than once just putting the invisibility cloak on but it seemed like some kind of surrender, so he just stopped going out.
Harry tried to mask his discomfort at the second mention of Ginny’s favorite team.
“I swear I won’t throw anything away without getting your permission, all right?” Harry realized belatedly that that was a big promise to make, one he might very well regret in the future, but the look of growing happiness in Kreacher’s eyes made him ignore some of his misgivings. Kreacher would never look innocent or cute, but he looked in that moment the same kind of recklessly hopeful that Dobby had looked sometimes.
Charlie blinked. “From
Robards took the same chair he’d occupied before while Kingsley took the one next to him. It put them both on the opposite side of the room as Harry, who had no choice but to sit on the couch as Teddy squirmed and began to protest the sudden change of position.
It was almost anticlimactic. The house looked the same as it had before. It felt no different either, and he wondered if maybe he’d already done the hard work by ridding the house of whatever that darkness had been with the blood ritual. He mentally poked at the secret. It certainly seemed to have worked. The secret felt hidden, the wholeness of it a weird sensation he couldn’t really explain, but knew on some level deeper than expression.
for an end.
But they were older now and they had all the time in the world. Ginny was nearly of age, and it wasn’t like Harry wasn’t interested in the concept of sex, far from it, but every time things turned in that direction—he felt nothing. Not wrong, just weird. He had the thought more than once that he would probably feel the same if he tried to shag Hermione, which put everything into a perspective that made it rather hard to get…hard. Seventeen and bored out of his mind and he couldn’t even get it up to have sex with his girlfriend, his brave, beautiful, wonderful, infinitely capable girlfriend. Every time it got close, every time he felt Ginny waiting for him to make the move they both knew was supposed to be coming, Harry just shut down.
“Again,” Ron said, “perfectly reasonable. If Malfoy snuck up on me the rest of my day would be ruined too. Surprised he isn’t locked up with his parents.”
can they?”
He smiled gratefully at her, giving her hand a squeeze for good measure. “Thanks, Hermione.”
A hard knot formed in his stomach. He knew this already. Malfoy telling him didn’t make it any worse. It didn’t.
But his alarm felt weak, something he could brush aside like a finger of smoke. In the soft, sibilant world of the dream, he only felt a weird kind of discomfort. An emptiness. A longing.
A weirdly hurt feeling pricked at his chest. Harry knew full well that Kreacher had only decided to start liking him recently. The business with Regulus’s locket, and then his notes, had given Harry the impression that Kreacher at least cared something for Harry.
Harry felt like the ground under him had shifted. It became, suddenly, painfully real, that he was being questioned about someone he’d murdered.
A high, cold laugh broke the sky. Harry flinched back, fear rising in his stomach like fire. The laughter was echoing all around him, shifting from one voice to another, both of them cruel, both of them horrible in different ways. He’d expected one but he’d never heard the other, not like this, and it made no sense because she—
Harry shook his head.
“Come on, Potter,” he said, low, tilting his head. “Use your imagination. Not like you don’t have enough experience.”
But he couldn’t shake it, in the brief moments he had before he fell asleep on his little cot in the attic, his eyes throbbing and his hands twitching, little prick-points across his fingers where he’d drawn drops of blood stinging like bug bites. It felt right. It felt…like he was meant to do it. Like the house
“There’s a reason I’m drinking ale right now,” Harry said with a smile. He laughed as she screwed up her face and mock gagged. “You know you don’t have to drink if you don’t want to.”
“Come on, Hermione, you must know more ways to check if someone’s making me do this.
Harry stood without looking at Bill and muttered, “No, I think I’m good.” His chair made a jarring noise as he shoved it back under the table. He was too close to throwing Ravenna Lamar and the other two kids in his face, just to see him try to defend that, but he knew better. It wouldn’t help his case.
“Of course. I’m not the first muggleborn to think about it. It’s a bit complicated, but there’s a small wizarding society in the city and they apparently do this quite often.” She smiled. “I have to say, it’d be interesting to see what it’s like. I used to dream about going to university as a child, where I would apply.”
The voice was small and familiar, breaking, raw.
“We don’t know their motive, Harry.”
he told himself half-heartedly. It
big MISSIO chapter today lol
“Bout the same,” Bill said after a while. “Maybe a little better. Hard to tell with Harry. Sometimes I think he’s fine and then…” He trailed off. In what was left unsaid, Harry found himself filling in the blanks.
“Is that—”
Harry flicked a glance toward Kingsley, anger rising up.
He gasped for air as his cock softened, watching a few valiant spurts of cum wash over his hand and slip down the drain. When he was spent, he reached out blindly and turned the heat down, letting the cool water drill some sense into him. He breathed until the steam was gone from the air and he didn’t feel like he was going to fall over if he tried to move.
“So,” Proulx said, voice startling and sharp, “you think the boy is innocent?”
A small, sharp cough came from Malfoy. Harry very purposefully ignored him.
“I think we’re fine, Andromeda,” Bill said gently, giving Teddy a little pat on the head. “Really. You’ve done more than enough.”
Kreacher hummed and muttered under his breath, but it was too low for Harry to hear.
He couldn’t drag them down with him anymore.
“Proulx wanted to bring in every member of Slytherin house, even the first years.” Malfoy smiled grimly when Harry looked up in alarm. “Apparently Robards and Shacklebolt talked him down, but the froggy bastard insisted on everyone over the age of thirteen at the time of the Battle of Hogwarts. Yeats, charming woman she is, sided with the Frenchman and in the end, who’s really going to put up a fight for a few scared Slytherins?”
“Streamlined.”
fanciful accounts of a wizard’s travels through the Orient, but were actually hundred-year-old erotic novels. He’d been collecting a bunch of porn for the better part of three hours. After his initial shock, he flipped through a few of them, curious despite himself. The second realization which made him feel like the collar of his jumper was attempt to strangle him was that they were all, seemingly, about gay men. Not that Harry was offended by them being gay—he didn’t have any problem with blokes liking other blokes, obviously. It was more the shock of flipping through an otherwise tame, if flowery, book only to read the line,
And no one fucking cared. Because they were Slytherins, no one gave a fuck.
It occurred to Harry as people started staring that he had no idea where he was supposed to go. Presumably to level nine and the courtrooms but he didn’t know if he needed to check in somewhere, or let someone know he was here—
“They told me you were cooperating with them,” Harry said before he could stop himself.
Madam Yeats was not looking at him, shuffling parchment on her desk and reaching for a gavel which sat on a black stone stand in the center of the bench. “That will be unnecessary. The Wizengamot is more than aware of your opinion in this matter, Mr. Potter. As is, I’m sure, a good portion of this building.”
He just…couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy.
“Fine!
If the living vessel’s body was dead at time of casting.
Robards stood and moved to a clear space in the corner of the room. With his own wand, he murmured,
“And we have no clue who…”
“The Fidelius Charm broke, Harry. I’m not sure how much safer you’ll be there than here.”
Teddy’s forehead was clear, though, unmarred. Teddy would grow up with someone who loved him, in a house where he didn’t have to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs. Teddy would know who he was, who his parents had been. Teddy wouldn’t be alone.
He’d searched for two days, sleeping little, until he’d found the hidden door to this underground place. Part of him thought the house had taken pity on him and shown him the way, which he took as a good thing. If the house liked him, and wanted him to cleanse it, maybe it’d step in before this…
A kitchen materialized as the flames retreated. A kitchen he’d only seen a bit of, the only time he’d been there. From what he could see now, the house had been rebuilt, mostly. There was a conspicuous absence in the center of the round room, but then a green tartan dress with what looked like bananas stitched onto the skirts appeared, and Harry smiled.
But Malfoy only stepped forward and lowered his voice, eyes gleaming like a cat who had been waiting for hours for a mouse to emerge from a hole so he could rip it to shreds. “That’s it, isn’t it? You thought you were special, thinking you and Granger and Weasley were the only ones who had any clue what Vol—what
It was time to end this. He didn’t have anything more to say and he didn’t want to hear Kingsley’s excuses or attempts to comfort him. He didn’t want anything from Kingsley. Not anymore.
She tucked her long red hair behind her ears—and he didn’t want to immediately run his fingers through it, which was a stupid thing to get caught up on but he used to love her hair—giving him a rueful smile. “But I don’t want you to force yourself to be with me if you don’t— That wouldn’t be fair. To either of us. So. It’s all right. Really.”
that shouldn’t exist. He should never have come back.
Not yet.
An ugly resentment curled up inside him. He’d known the spell he’d cast was different. He shouldn’t be surprised at the reaction. He’d known how people would think he’d done something extraordinary and tell him so and expect him to thank them and be a good little prodigy.
“I was just there for about a month. If they tolerated me, they’d love you. Fleur might steal Teddy once she gets her hands on him, though, so maybe it’s not such a good idea.”
Meeting Kingsley’s gaze now, he felt the final brick laid in the wall between him and everyone else. Kingsley wasn’t looking at him like he was an eighteen-year-old kid who’d had a temper tantrum. It was more like Harry was an unknown quantity—there was pity there, sure, and a decent amount of shame and affection, but Harry felt it through the filter of separation between them. He was the Minister for Magic, arguably one of the most powerful people in Britain, and Harry still couldn’t be reached.
The next thing he knew she was under him with her clothes off and his clothes had come off as well and this was the moment, if it was going to happen, it was going to happen now. So…he made it happen.
“Right,” Bill said. “You don’t happen to know anything about the Avery estate, do you?”
Harry whispered, helpless, following as Tom’s hand on his back moved with purpose and pressed him closer. He was cold, so cold, but the fire inside Harry felt like an inferno and he needed relief, he needed— “Oh,
“I miss him,” Harry said honestly, “a lot. This…place reminds me of him. It’s sad. It makes me sad. But that’s not your fault, or the house’s. I just miss him.” He hesitated, hoping he wasn’t pushing too far. “Like you miss Master Regulus, I’d wager.”
“Of course you have the right,” Yeats said sharply, “as all witches and wizards have the right to disagree with how the Ministry conducts its affairs—”
Malfoy only stared at him harder the longer Harry stayed silent.
“Wait a bit for it to cool off,” Andromeda said, setting down Harry’s cup and taking the only other chair left. She stopped when she saw Teddy’s new distraction, an oddly amused look lifting her face. “Is that…” She touched one of the beads not yet covered in toddler drool and exhaled a soft laugh. “This was my aunt’s. Goodness…” She trailed off, eyes distant.
Harry had accepted Sirius’s odd collection of random and mildly offensive muggle items long ago, items meant specifically to piss off his family, but he wondered how best to phrase it to everyone else. “It was—well, a woman in a bikini and a hula skirt. Pretty sure he kept it there to be an arse.”
This hit the hard exterior of his stillness, but it didn’t break through. Was that what he was doing? He hadn’t been trying to, but now…
Bellatrix shrieked as she managed to catch the edge of Draco’s sleeve on a lash of black fire. She grinned a rictus smile when more of his pale skin showed through the material, when blood began to soak through his shirt. “You were given everything,
His vision tunneled. The sensations of his body dimmed as, with every shaking breath, Goyle remained perfectly, horribly, still.
“This room is being hidden by Kreacher after Master Sirius returned.” Kreacher’s voice was low, though he didn’t sound at all ashamed. More like he didn’t want to make Harry angry by outright insulting Sirius. “When Kreacher is learning that Master Sirius was wanting to purge this noble and ancient house of all things reminding him of his family, Kreacher is wanting to protect some things. The house is asking Kreacher to hide them.”
to them, you’re an investment. You’re just a way to get what they
Harry rubbed a hand over his raw, tired face, and reached down with trembling fingers to pick up the single red feather Fawkes had left between his feet.
“Respectfully, my opinion doesn’t matter, Madam Yeats,” Hermione said after a long, long pause. “Furthermore, I wouldn’t wish to give my opinion if it did, because I don’t think I could give you one that was unbiased. I hope the Wizengamot will take everything they hear today into consideration when they come to their verdict, and not merely my personal—judgements.”
Kamau was watching him with a soft smile but Harry had a feeling the woman just looked like that all the time. Proulx still looked like he was sucking on a lemon, even if something in his dark blue eyes made Harry uneasy, gleaming with interest.
Bill nodded. “Right. Thank you.”
He should want to be with her though, right?
Harry felt a hot stab of guilt wash through him as he recognized the fear in Andromeda’s voice. He’d only heard her this sharp once before, and that was the night of his seventeenth birthday, asking after her daughter.
“I’m going fucking mental,” he whispered.
Bill looked up over the heads of his friends. “What’s up, Harry?”
After what felt like an hour, the green-gold dust disappeared, shimmering over stalk and leaf and petal like fresh morning mist. Harry twisted his hands again, this time bringing his right thumb to his left palm, performing a series of contortions with the fingers of his left hand until he felt something connect like a key into a lock. He turned his right hand, and the disc of blood rippled into a steady stream, pouring down onto the plant like water from a can.
No, the only person who knew where he lived was Andromeda.
He loved the Weasleys, they were the closest thing he had to family—they
“Don’t apologize about swearing in front of me,” she said with a small smile, wiping the residual blood from his palm. “I’d prefer if you didn’t do it in front of Teddy, at least until he’s older.”
He looked down before Kingsley could read his face, frowning as he shifted some of the papers away with one hand while he held Teddy. He’d dropped the bracelet in favor of Harry’s jacket and seemed to be trying to shove his head inside the arm hole.
Harry stopped a few feet away from Voldemort, who had bent over and contorted his body to remain standing as he shook with the effort. Their eyes level, Harry stared into them and looked for the black eyes of the orphan everyone had feared. He looked for the boy who had grown up without parents, without love, who had fought to carve out a place for himself in a world which didn’t want him.
He grimaced. The level of morbidity was a bit much, even for him. Curious, he compared the silver branches and roots on his palm with the twin puncture holes on his left forearm. They’d faded since second year, Fawkes’s tears not quite erasing the memory of the basilisk’s fangs and the venom which had nearly killed him.
Harry forced himself to hold Ron’s gaze, trying not to lose his temper. He had no ground to stand on here. He felt like shite for keeping things from Ron and Hermione. He’d fucking murdered someone,
“God, what was the thing about the future being—”
What really gnawed at him was the fact that he wasn’t more upset about it. He missed the life he’d imagined for them over the year he spent on the run, the fantasy of a happy ending after he did what he was supposed to do. The one where they’d have kids and settle down and live the life his parents never had and he’d finally be normal.
“Did you have a
He felt raw. Worn out. Empty.
Her eyes moved to a point just above his head and she chewed on her bottom lip. “Hmm. Well, you have a veritable flock of wrackspurts in your hair right now. You’ve always attracted them more than others, but this seems excessive.”
He stared down at the sigil under him, somehow still intact even as he’d apparently fallen on it and rolled around a bit—the dirt was disturbed, but the sigil looked like it had been carved into stone. He prodded it with his toe and felt the barriers he’d laid down flare ever so slightly.
Maybe it would have been better if he’d died in Godric’s Hollow with them. If it meant being spared this…this horrible, ragged longing for something he would never have, maybe it would have been better.
Since before he could
He blinked again, and a few more times, eyes flicking back and forth across the room. He waited for something to explode, or catch fire, or maybe one of the dressers would transfigure itself into a big hairy monster and jump at him, but nothing happened. He had the thought that he should probably see to his wounds, that whatever job the house—the bloody
It was selfish in a way Harry’d never been able to justify being. Cruel, dismissive, arrogant. So many things he’d once thought were his virtues had fallen to the wayside, but this one stuck around. He didn’t get to worry about shite like this. Who was he kidding, really? This—trivial bullshit like who he might theoretically not be opposed to looking at for more than a few seconds was what other people worried about. People who weren’t reanimated corpses and repositories for evil, broken souls. People who weren’t being hunted down like dogs, even after the war they’d fought and won was supposed to be over. People who’d never killed before.
It couldn’t have anything to do with Harry.
And Harry had bought it into it just like everyone else.
Now, however, with the deadened feeling of a person having just awoken from a century of sleep, he could see things quite clearly. Specifically, the silver, branching scar on the palm of his right hand. It followed the lines on his palm. He tried to remember something from their section in Divination about palm reading, but either he was still out of it or his brain had decided to throw it out in the intervening years. Probably around the same time Trelawny had pronounced his life line was broken or something and he was in imminent danger of being squashed by a falling piano.
was foreign and weird and it made him feel all empty down at the bottom of his stomach.
It took him the better part of three days to get a handle on the greenwood book. The spells inside were largely based around cleansing, refreshing, or renewing. Clearing out anything which prohibited the movement and transfer of magic. He got caught on the idea that he could somehow heal his soul, if that was possible, but the book seemed largely focused on removing things which stopped something from working properly, something physical which had manifested and gummed up the works. For all intents and purposes, Harry was working fine, and he didn’t trust he’d be able to work any spell so complex as
He picked a fight.
The auror looked over his shoulder to the large clock hanging on the wall above the lifts. “Right. Well.” His demeanor shifted, confusion to embarrassed anger. “I’ll be waiting, Malfoy.” The man sent another baffled look at Harry before he turned and left.
His eyes slid shut as his hand drifted low across his stomach, a weird tension fluttering to life inside him as he drew a long wet line down his navel. When was the last time he’d had a good wank? Not for a while. And there was something antsy in him, like something had gotten knocked loose in the cleansing ritual. Whatever it was apparently made him remember that he had a cock, and that, would you believe, it felt rather nice if he tugged on it for a while.
Malfoy held Harry’s gaze. His mouth tightened as if fighting the urge to speak.
“You’re going in for questioning.”
And some part of him wanted it. Badly.
Goyle had been Malfoy’s friend, once upon a time. Harry had no idea what happened to them after Hogwarts, but he’d been there for the death of Crabbe. He’d seen what it had done to Malfoy in the immediate aftermath.
“Just giving it back now I don’t need it,” Harry said with a tight smile.
“So, then,
Right away Harry regretted the words. They weren’t true. Malfoy had done plenty of things which were good. He’d stopped himself killing Dumbledore, he’d saved Harry, twice.
Harry deflected her spell quickly, his wand out and in his hand before he realized what he was doing.
It took Harry three days to fully understand how Voldemort had crafted his bid for immortality.
The crystallized fog of his depression shattered and it was like icy air rushed in on a wave of panic.
sent him a little wave of warmth.
Funny. He was eighteen now and he was only just starting to realize that he wanted nothing more than to never have to prove himself to anyone ever again.
To that world behind the veil in the Department of Mysteries, maybe. If that was the afterlife.
It looked a bit like the strange view he’d seen out of the greenhouse windows back in Grimmauld Place. The vista now sitting in the entry hall where Walburga Black had once terrorized intruders.
And any leftover guilt Harry had been feeling died in his chest, unspent.
“No, Harry.” Bill sighed heavily. “
Mercifully, Bill tugged Percy gently into the lift, still smiling. Percy recovered impressively and started listing out the topics Harry might expect to be asked about with a zeal that seemed disproportionate to the subject matter.
Harry frowned. “Should I have worn something else? I figured—”
“Our school was turned into a
“Like you said. They’re probably trying to make up for those years of treating me like a criminal.” He shouldn’t press it. It was bad enough Malfoy was here, Harry didn’t need to go provoking him.
Felicity’s eyes widened. “You’ve heard of it?”
The moment he got to the first floor, though, he realized it was someone banging on the front door.
Special.
How to resurrect a person and make sure their soul didn’t pass on. How to break them just right so they were trapped here.
“You heard about the firefight.” Malfoy exhaled softly, incredulity in his voice. “You did, didn’t you?”
Harry’s eyes remained fixed on the table, unseeing.
“The Internation Confederation of Wizards is concerned that Britain has a dark wizard problem. This is our second in a century, and it’s a wonder the muggles didn’t figure it all out this time. It’s not like—
Harry nodded. “Of course, sir.”
Both lived. Both died.
Harry hadn’t seen much of Percy that summer. Once at Fred’s funeral and then again one night when George had forced him to join them all for a drink. He still didn’t know quite how to feel about Percy but he was glad Percy seemed just as uncomfortable as he was.
“I think you’re cutting everyone out because that’s easier than dealing—”
Harry wiped his face clean of his conflict, unable to say anything, afraid if he opened his mouth something horrible would come spilling out.
He leaned forward, squinting down without his glasses, and read,
It sounded like it came from just behind him. Harry turned but with an unsettling shift the world turned with him. He spun around again. The light fractured as a noise like a whine cut through the stillness.
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “I feel…like I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing.” He made himself look up and meet Bill’s knowing gaze. “I’m just hanging around waiting for someone to tell me what I’m allowed to do, I guess.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to be surprised. Bill had mentioned someone else that night, someone who had been cooperating with them and might be willing to talk to the kids, but Kingsley had shot him down for fear of asking this person too much. He didn’t want to scare them off.
He knew, he
Malfoy’s gaze flickered over Voldemort’s shoulder, then back to Harry, and then with purpose he released Harry.
“It doesn’t?” he found himself whispering, the space between them shrinking. He felt edgy, nervous—like he was about to jump out of his own skin. Like he needed something to hold onto him.
It was from whatever he’d done to kill Goyle, obviously. If it’d been unconscious magic, or some kind of wandless spell he’d cast without thought, he hadn’t the faintest idea, but it had marked him.
“Yeah, Luna, I know what sex is.” Harry grinned, going a bit red around the ears.
He might loathe the bloke, but he couldn’t help thinking of those kids, that girl with her blank, dead eyes—Malfoy lying on a floor wet with his own blood, eyes wide and unseeing.
Bill was the one who finally broke. He took a purposeful step forward, giving Andromeda a reassuring smile. “You can stay if you’d like, but I don’t think this will take very long.”
The moment his head hit the pillow, he dreamed.
All he knew was that he felt like someone had burned all the vital things that made him up and stuffed him full with dead air. Left him in the dark. Again.
Harry looked up at him incredulously. “He nearly blew himself up to make it less likely he’d go to Azkaban?”
Bill stared at him for a moment before he nodded. “Okay. And she’s… You trust her?”
When the rushing of his blood died down there was only the sound of his own wet breathing, the heartbeat in his ears. Far off in the distance, he heard the rush of traffic, but he was so far into the park that it was just a faint murmur. Bugs chirped. A little splash of water as something dropped down onto the nearby lake. Mundane sounds of the world around him.
“You doing okay?”
Harry was still on the ground in the middle of the path, bleeding. He needed to stand up and get somewhere he could sit. And then he could— He could—
Harry’s brow raised. “How are you explaining away half the building disintegrating?”
It took him a moment to adjust, a strange sense of stepping through another barrier as he left Grimmauld Place overcoming him. The connection was still there, but it was like he’d set the house aside for the moment, freeing up his mind.
The moment folded in on itself and suddenly Harry was standing in Dumbledore’s office amidst the shattered pieces of the things Harry had broken in an attempt to make his own pain stop.
“Draco Malfoy could have become every bit as horrible as his father. Worse, maybe. He had every opportunity but he didn’t. He changed his mind before the end. People can change,” he added, softly. “And I think they deserve the chance to try. He was a kid.” Something fragile went taut in the back of his mind, tensing until he felt a cord was pulling at him, straining.
He was eighteen and his life had already ended and begun again twice. Maybe that was as much as he was allowed to get.
Andromeda was holding Teddy in the door of the kitchen, the boy squirming and reaching toward Harry in a demanding, imperious way.
Maybe he had loved Harry. Maybe he’d hated himself for what he was doing to a child who’d lost everything before he was even two years old.
to save his parents, because Voldemort knew exactly how to ensure their loyalty, by using him as a deterrent to keep his parents in line. You have no
Robards cleared his throat.
He screamed,
He closed his eyes and tried to take a deep breath, only to whimper when his ribs protested.
He’d defended Malfoy twice. Once in the interview and again in front of that auror. Both times he’d wondered what he was doing. Both times he’d questioned why he felt guilty every time he thought of the idiot. There was no reason. Malfoy had gotten himself into his own mess. He was a nasty, spiteful arse. He’d taken every opportunity to make Harry’s life hell for six straight years, to hurt his friends, and the bastard had
Harry redirected the blast with a quick slash of his wand. Fire lit up the path as it caught on a few of the oak branches.
Anger flickered up like a candle’s flame stirred by a breeze. “But I… It doesn’t matter what I meant—”
curse up through my leg. Encouragement, obviously, to keep me from getting any ideas about revenge or homicide. Convenient as well, because while I’m here, they can take my wand and monitor what spells I’ve used all day to make sure I’m not off hexing innocent muggles. It also prevents me from apparating. They call it La Douce Prison in France. Rather straightforward for the French, wouldn’t you say? And who do you think introduced this clever workaround to answer the question of what to do with the children of the death eaters they couldn’t indiscriminately throw into cells? Who do you think gave it the stamp of approval?” Something strange flickered through Malfoy’s bright grey gaze, almost resignation. “I know exactly who’s holding my leash, Potter.”
when it fucked him over.
He was in a decidedly nicer suit and robes, though he had left the tie out and looked about ten times more at ease than his brother, who was wearing official-looking black and white Ministry robes. But that was hardly fair, as Bill always looked cool and polished. If he didn’t like Bill so much he would find it frustrating.
Harry sat there for a solid two minutes, trying to convince himself he hadn’t just gone insane. He supposed it made a kind of sense, when he squinted sideways at it. Wizarding houses were alive, in a way. Magical residue made the world around it change, grow more…active. Something had tainted the house, had corrupted it, and probably had lived here for a long time. Whether it was the combined presence of centuries of dark magic and bigotry handed down by the Blacks like family heirlooms or it was something else, it was gone. Now the house was free to… Well. He didn’t know what it was free to do now, because Harry had never before needed to consider the aspirations of a house, especially one he’d only recently decided he liked.
Cold fingers slid around Harry’s wrist, serpentine and soft, moving with a proprietary ease. The chill of Tom’s skin made his heart jump. His lips parted—mist formed in the air between them. He was so hot, he was burning, and the room was just getting colder. Tom tilted his head, eyes glittering in satisfaction when Harry’s head tilted to mirror his, following without thought.
“Blood’s the thing, isn’t it?” Tom’s voice dropped. “And aren’t you just singing for it?”
“No, we won’t impose any longer.” Kingsley said as he and Robards stood.
He understood now why wands had become the standard, at least in Britain. It was bloody hard to rely on your fingers.
He must have, or Voldemort couldn’t have made him into a horcrux. And whatever magic had been wrought when his mum died for him, it had brought him back. It, and the shard of Voldemort’s soul, reanimating him. Before Voldemort reclaimed his body he could have possessed as many people as he liked, but he shouldn’t have been able to after… And yet Voldemort
He waited a few seconds, the green flames around his face almost tickling.
His first step sent shockwaves through the golden dome. He heard the shouts of those outside through a filter of molten glass, saw the shadows move around him, but they couldn’t interfere, not anymore. No one else would die for him today.
Proulx stared at him,
Through the chaos a dark shape flew down from the sky and disappeared again into the cloud of smoke and wand-fire. Skidding to a halt before a group of centaurs stampeded over him, Harry swirled his wand in the air over his head and cried,
he said harshly at Hermione’s confusion, “I saw his memories in Dumbledore’s pensieve after he died. That’s what he gave me. He was in love with my mum his whole life and when she picked my dad over him, he lost his mind. He treated me like I was worthless for six years because she didn’t fancy him, and he was supposed to be Dumbledore’s man.
killed—
A senior Ministry official. Bill had said Kingsley had managed to convince the Wizengamot to keep these kids out of Azkaban long enough to give them a fair trial, but he’d wanted to do more. He’d argued against Hogwarts’s closing. He’d thought Yeats was going too far, but he couldn’t outright object, or he’d lose support, and he’d be forced out of office.
“I think you should do like Ron and not talk to me for a while. I think—I think I need time. Alone, or… More time, to think, or… I don’t—” He exhaled, the sound curled around a final sob. He pushed his hair back as he cleared his throat, voice still shaking with his hands. Going through the motions like someone else was pulling the strings.
don’t work for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, you berk.”
“Sure, but as far as I know he never stabbed people. It was more just—bullying, really. Might have started in seventh year. I told you what I heard from other kids who attended last year. I’ve never seen him that—unhinged before.”
“Ease off, little man,” Harry muttered, producing the bracelet of colorful glass beads—large enough that they weren’t a choking hazard—he’d found last night. “Chew on this for a while, yeah?”
As the crowd churned and people reached out to touch him, to make sure he was alive and whole, to grab onto a piece of him and pull, Harry’s eyes shifted as if by compulsion to a gap between the many, many heads.
“Kreacher is not knowing. It is something Master Regulus is treasuring above all his other fine things. He is wearing it all the time, twisting and turning it. Master Regulus is making sure that Kreacher is hiding it especially.”
“Kamau?” Hermione asked, leaning forward. “Not Faye Lorelai Kamau?”
“I have too. I’ve played you.”
Belatedly, he realized he didn’t actually know if the ritual had worked. His wand wobbled over to him without him even realizing he was summoning it, brightening as Harry wrapped his shaking fingers around it. He sat there, faced with the challenge of trying to test whether the blood magic ritual he’d performed had worked to…cleanse his house of malicious spirits…or whatever the fuck it was supposed to do. At the time it made perfect sense, but now that he was on the other side of it—how the fuck was he supposed to find out if it worked?
“You look terrible,” he said quickly, fumbling.
“You can burn them.”
Malfoy asked, frowning. “How disappointing.”
Malfoy frowned. “Which one?”
He spat the last. “You and I both know Hermione doesn’t lose it like that unless you lost your mind at her, unless you
Was murder justified if the man was a monster? Harry had thought so, he still did in theory, but the longer he lived as Voldemort’s killer, he wondered. He didn’t feel justified. Or vindicated, or relieved.
Harry had to duck several times to avoid overhanging shelves and contort himself into a few strange positions just to follow Kreacher on a little winding path through the forest of forgotten books. The farther they went, the more Harry felt like he really was going to get lost in here.
“And how did you learn of this—presumably you were there at school when the event happened?”
An accident.
Harry blinked, caught off guard. “You—”
There were dark circles under his eyes, but he was smiling, with an expression that reminded Harry so much of Arthur. They really did look alike, even if Bill was about a foot taller and even charitably it’d be a stretch to call Arthur handsome.
And Harry could do nothing to save them. He kept trying to throw himself in front of the curses, to cut open his own chest and pull out his heart, but he could barely move. He was trapped, watching his fellow students die from the curses of tall shadows all around him.
For a long moment, Harry felt the weight of a large, ominous presence surround him. Like the house itself was weighing his words. It probably was, he allowed. This house more than anywhere else he’d ever been seemed to live and breathe and ooze feeling. The uncanny silence was jarring, because it went further than the absence of creaking and wind moaning somewhere far above in a drafty attic. It was like the house was holding its breath.
Harry arched his brow when Malfoy did nothing, that familiar thrill of annoyance he always felt when he thought of Malfoy zipping up his spine. Except he wasn’t annoyed now. It felt more like—anticipation. He didn’t buy into all that optics shite, but he knew what happened next was going to matter.
Tom Riddle’s smile.
The Room of Requirement was filled with flames, shrieking and spitting and howling—fiendfyre. Except it wasn’t Crabbe who’d set it loose this time. The grey and white figures—witches and wizards and horses and dragons—all of them screaming their horror, belonged to Harry.
care? He’d hated Slytherins just as much as Ron and Hermione. He’d thought they were vile, cruel, racist pieces of shit. Malfoy more so than anyone else.
“Maybe if you came back and took up the cause,” Bill said pointedly over the rim of his glass. “Not everyone has your deep, abiding affection for the flying death machines which belch fire.”
“Yeah, that sounds great.” Harry took a deep breath. “Probably’ll need that every night this week.”
“I know.” He tried for a smile. “You don’t have to justify it to me. Or anyone.”
The dream fractured. Two figures stood in the glow of a lantern, the sky cracking with thunder and a cold, biting wind. The woman on the ground went still. The figure swathed in black let out another laugh. The other one…
“I don’t blame him. None of us are all right but Harry… It fell on him more than anyone else, in the end. I still don’t know how he did it,” Bill added, a frown in his voice. “That kind of magic…can’t say I’ve ever seen anything like it.”
connected to the source of magic inside himself, like casting spontaneously, or wordlessly. Magic had always come easily to him, but this was different. With a wand, it was nearly effortless to concentrate and channel his magic. This was harder, like he was trying to climb a cliff face with his hands and feet tied together. He could barely get a first hold to pull himself up. He could feel it, sitting there inside him, but he couldn’t figure out a way to grab it and wield it, and then how he would control it with any kind of mastery. That was the danger with wandless magic, as every professor at Hogwarts had mentioned at some point during his time there—magic undirected was volatile. Wands allowed a wizard to direct his magic with intention, not intuition. Wordless
the ones who fought it and
“You’re helping them look through your house, right?”
Charlie scowled. “You just want me back so Mum stops bugging you about your hair.”
“Kreacher?” he called, knowing full well that if anyone would know what happened with the house, it be him.
She straightened up and shook her head. “The witch must have regretted it immediately, activating the reversal right away. It didn’t stop the spell from starting, though, and the swiftness of the spread was astounding. Half the building was destroyed in less than a second. It’s down to luck that no one was killed.”
He didn’t regret doing it. More than one death eater had known about this place, and even if most of them were dead or behind bars, he didn’t want to chance it. If people were going to come looking for him, he’d be stupid not to protect himself. Grimly, he thought Moody would approve. The last time he’d seen the man had been in the entrance of this house. Nearly a year ago.
Somehow, Malfoy’s frown deepened, but he didn’t say anything. No, he just kept staring at Harry—and Harry fought the urge to glower at him and ask what the fuck was so interesting about his face. It wouldn’t help anything and Malfoy would just take it as Harry admitting Malfoy made him uncomfortable, something he vowed right then never to do.
The phrase hovered at the front of his mind, taunting him.
“It’s all right,” she continued, voice flat and casual. “I don’t blame you. I knew what I was getting into with you, so…”
I think I have a right to be more than concerned with how harshly the Ministry has decided to land on this issue.”
When he finished, Bill’s eyes were hard with alarm and anger. With his scars, Bill looked downright terrifying when he was angry, but Harry had never had cause to see him like this before, fiercely protective and furious. He looked older, somehow, than he normally did. Harry felt like a kid looking into his face, because he
Luna hummed, as if she were skeptical, and Harry’s mood flagged a bit in the face of that well-meaning pity.
It made him sick, knowing that. It reminded him of Tom Riddle and his superiority. He didn’t want to be different. He wanted people to stop trying to make him so fucking special.
Hermione sighed heavily. “I told him I was thinking about taking some time to visit family this fall. As you can imagine, he’s taking it poorly.”
Expecting some flicker of darkness like he’d felt from the horcruxes, he was shocked when a cool breeze wafted under his nose, smelling of growing things and sunshine.
Potter. I’m going to
It was so similar to Narcissa’s, down to the way her lips were pursed on the left, how her eyes held him like she could see right through him, his palm slipped on the knife he was cleaning.
Harry had always been other, outside. ‘Special’ was the word Kingsley’d used, wasn’t it? He’d been able to convince himself sometimes that he wasn’t so distanced from everyone else. He’d had Ron and Hermione, Ginny and the rest of the Weasleys, his friends—all of them had gone out of their way to treat him like he was just another kid. Most of the time anyway.
The thought was so abhorrent, so absolutely vile, that some part of his brain shut off. Shock, he knew, probably, as he shifted Goyle off the road and into the little stand of trees, behind one of the bushes. A bird startled out and flew off. Harry errantly wanted to watch it go, anything to stop looking at Goyle’s body, but he couldn’t look away.
He knew that voice. He hadn’t heard it in over three months, but he
Harry exhaled in dismay—he’d done it all right, he could feel that. There was no reason…
Her eyes widened in outrage, but before she shouted at him, he silenced her with a sharp look.
in the weeks leading up to the Battle at Hogwarts. He was the first person to attack Voldemort that day. He dueled his own
Ron was right. He was playing the hero. Like always.
Harry knelt on the dirt floor at the base of Grimmauld Place, arms tight and hot as they leaked his blood, his life force, out and into the house. He looked up. The black entity hung in the air, still for the first time. There was no malevolence any more, no fighting will.
Or I’ve forgotten what he did to me, to you, for five fucking years? I haven’t. I remember all of it, every fucking day, and it’s
“Are you not going to ask for my opinion on sentencing?”
wandless? Downright lunacy to attempt.
It helped that reading more of Regulus’s notes seemed to confirm that this place had never really been cozy. Even Regulus, apparent perfect son, had found his home a bit unnerving.
in the way he was used to. It was a symbolic text, not a series of instructions, and it was so tied to the hand and finger movements that writing wouldn’t have been able to adequately convey it anyway, in the same way he had to work to speak Parseltongue when he wasn’t staring directly at a snake. It just wasn’t meant to be used outside its context.
“Harry.”
There was a loud banging coming from the first floor.
“Why are we here?”
His tears never stopped falling. They collected in a pile at his feet, discarded jewels sinking into the sand.
“You’d be under the protection of the entirety of the Aurors’ Office. There isn’t anywhere more secure—”
Harry stifled a sob, trying not to wake Teddy. Andromeda pulled him into a gentle embrace. She sat with him for a few more minutes, letting him cry into her shoulder until he could stop, before she offered him the potion and guided him down onto the bed.
For the first time in four months, Harry dreamed of Voldemort.
He cast a quick look around the atrium, but it was mostly empty. People were sending him and Malfoy interested looks, but there was no one around who could hear their conversation and no one seemed eager to approach him right that second.
The old woman turned sharply on her heel and marched away, nose so high in the air Harry watched for a while to see if she tripped on the stairs leading up to the floo hallway.
for what Harry knew would be the last time.
“Apparently not. I haven’t told him.” He looked away from her intensely concerned expression. “I didn’t want to make things weird. We haven’t exactly spent a lot of time together this summer, and he’s been busy with George and the store. I didn’t…want to give him anything to get worked up over. He’s so happy,” he finished lamely, knowing it was a shit excuse.
Slowly, and after what felt like hours, she stepped to the side. Her hands lifted and fell, and he could hear her trying not to sob out loud. “We can—we can talk about this. I… I promise—I’ll listen. You don’t have to be alone, Harry—”
It must have happened again in the Forbidden Forest. His sacrifice—whatever magic it’d given him—had fucked with his soul again, because he’d died, he must have.
Harry took as deep a breath as he dared and met Bill’s gaze.
and you spurn it in favor of—”
Forcing himself to inch forward, Harry crawled with his heart in his throat until he could fumble for his wand. He hesitated before he pulled, waiting for Goyle to move, willing it to be some stupid trick. Some feint to get Harry to come close enough to finish the jo.
He ran a hand through his hair, knowing there was nothing to be done for it—the messy black wave of it looked somewhat intentional. Most of it was going the same way, at least. He straightened his glasses. He didn’t look bad. He’d put back on some weight over the summer, Molly and Fleur both taking it upon themselves to shove as much food as they could at him. He was still too skinny, but at least his suit fit him now so it wasn’t so obvious. There were bags under his eyes and the shadow of stubble on his chin looked like it might be ready to grow in one of these days, but he had new, sharp shoes and his white collar was clean. He looked—older. Not quite like his dad in the pictures he had sitting on his bedside table, but closer than ever before, his skin a paler brown and his hair a deeper shade of black, his face growing longer to reflect his dad’s impressive jaw line.
Harry said nothing, warring with himself. Of course he understood. Ron would want to be with his brother. That only made sense.
“So he was a coward when faced with us, but not Voldemort?”
Harry caught Bill’s movements out of the corner of his eye. He tried to speak, but only managed a rough, “An-dromeda—”
He caught Kingsley’s searching gaze and waited, but it seemed the Minister had nothing more to say to him. That, or he didn’t think Harry would want to hear it.
Voldemort tilted his head, one waxy hand rising to tip Malfoy’s chin up. “You have.” His long, sharp nails pressed into Malfoy’s ash-streaked face. “Most egregiously. I could take your life right now and be done with you. Or perhaps you need more effective incentives,” he added this last so quietly that Harry shouldn’t have been able to hear him, not over the distance between them. But he heard it like it was brushed against his own cheek. Like he was there in Malfoy’s place with Voldemort so horribly close.
Today there was kipper with fried eggs and rosemary-roasted potatoes, smokey baked beans served next to toasted sourdough slices which still steamed with heat, and a full English breakfast complete with three different kinds of sausage, seared wild mushrooms covered in butter, garlic, and thyme, fried black pudding, and caramelized tomatoes.
traitor! Undeserving piece of trash—how you could stand there and face me when you couldn’t even—” She broke off as a spell whipped by her face, slashing her cheek. Bellatrix’s eyes were gleaming now, mania taking over and pulling her mouth into a terrible smile. “You weak, disgusting,
He didn’t feel saved. He felt broken.
Harry swallowed his immediate retort.
side. We didn’t—we didn’t want…”
He moved methodically through the rest of the spell, sweat building in the small of his back and at his temples. The disc continued to smooth out until it was a foot across and thin as a sheet of silk. It began to vibrate, the magic separating from his blood and falling down like snowflakes onto the plant in tiny dust particles of green and gold light. Where they touched, the plant twitched. A soft popping sound began to fill the air as more of the cleansing magic sifted down onto the withered and lesioned plant.
Under the papers there were a few books, what looked to be a journal of some kind. Scraps of crinkled paper and tape formed the bulk of the contents. Harry couldn’t help but think of Regulus’s frantic scribblings in the last days of his life.
Harry frowned at Malfoy’s tone—flat and resigned, not even a bit derisive.
Malfoy was helping. He was genuinely helping.
“Of course I could. I could if you’d just fucking talk—”
A coughed laugh made his chest ache. His eyes watered as he wheezed—the whole thing was suddenly, absurdly hilarious. Bloody fucking stupid, and
“Okay,” Bill murmured. “Okay.” He looked up at Andromeda where she was hovering in the doorway to the kitchen. “I’m going to have to leave to deal with this, Andromeda. Can you—”
He’d found this spot two weeks before he’d gone in for questioning, a little hidden patch of grass in the center of Richmond Park on one of his early days of wandering London, trying to fill the time. Caged in on three sides by a hedge, it reminded him of the maze at the end of the Triwizard Tournament. It shouldn’t have been comfortable, but it was, weirdly, covered in shadow and cool even during the day. The air smelled older here—a small pocket of London hidden away from the noise and the chaos of people swarming through it. The world felt like it was perched on the edge of autumn here in the dim light, the last summer warmth trailing up toward the sky in waving fingers.
“No, I…” Harry smiled, feeling the urge to brag a bit. It was an odd sensation, one which sat a little uncomfortably in his chest. “Did you not hear about Gringotts?”
There were people huddled outside the door, because of course there were, but he ignored them. Moving with his eyes on the ground and his face set—
“Yeah,” he said, hollow, pointing his wand at the door, “I do.”
“I know you didn’t mean to kill Gregory Goyle. Your account matches what we found at the scene, and as he was formally charged with multiple counts of murder and battery earlier today, I’m inclined to believe him fully capable of attempting to kill you.” He looked up, his dark eyes filled with a strange kind of sadness. “The formal investigation will take some time, so this isn’t official, but I’m not going to charge you with anything. Neither is anyone else from the Office of Magical Law Enforcement. What you did, you did in self defense.”
Had he…meant to die with that last gambit? Before he’d seen Harry, was he surrendering, or…was he getting out, no matter what it cost him?
Andromeda’s voice was measured and firm, her low tone commanding and cutting through his panic.
“Seriously,” Bill said, nudging him with an elbow. “Something to consider. Might be a nice change of pace.”
He sat back, exhaling in an attempt to calm down. If he wasn’t careful, he was going to start shouting soon. Why had he thought this would go well?
He tried to smile. “I think you have the wrong idea about my life. Believe me. It’s not that exciting.” He finished drying the plate, putting it down slowly so it didn’t clank with the slight tremble in his hand. “I want to be here for him,” he finally said, softly. “I know I won’t—I’m not trying to interfere, and if this is overstepping, shove me out on my arse and I’ll leave you alone but…” He swallowed, the growing warmth in Andromeda’s eyes almost unbearable. “I want you to know that I take this—being Teddy’s godfather—seriously. So however you want me in his life, that’s fine. I just…”
“I think there’s some kind of spring involved? They move when the car moves.”
Kreacher was old, maybe he was starting to go senile. It was a wonder he wasn’t completely mad having spent decades in this place with only a shrieking portrait for company.
True to form, Hermione started in on him. “You don’t have anything to say for yourself?”
Hermione let out a sharp sound of disgust, but Harry ignored her. He waited until he was sure Malfoy wasn’t going to look away, then nodded to him, not caring that it made the people around them gasp and whisper.
He laughed. “No. Not at all. It’s not an obligation. Really. Maybe I thought it would have been before I met the kid but he’s brilliant.” He wanted to hug her, or thank her, or—something. Their only connection was the little boy sleeping in the other room but he couldn’t help but feel like he could do more to comfort her. Like he owed it to Tonks, to Sirius, to Teddy, even. “I know what it’s like to grow up without a family. I don’t want Teddy to ever feel like that.”
Kreacher’s eyes glowed in the dim light, like a cat’s. In the shadows, he almost looked like something else, a being older and sharper and more strange than the world around them. Like he was smaller and…
“Of course it’s safe! You just can’t drink it if you’re going swimming or if you fancy a walk by the sea. I’d take it at night, too, as sometimes it can make you rather tired, but that’s just the dreamroot powder. You don’t take a hallucinogenic regularly, do you?”
to want to shag his beautiful, willing girlfriend. He was supposed to want her.
He could still
“There’s a reason you’re just hearing about this,” Bill said as he slid into the seat next to Harry, divvying up drinks. “For
Ron pleaded. “It’s over, mate. You don’t—”
“Thank you, Mr. Potter.”
Voldemort’s magic slammed down and cut off all noise. The courtyard hummed with it. But Harry could almost feel the places where Voldemort’s magic was weak. He could almost see the places where the threads frayed—the places he might tug, or rip.
With a final push he sent the bead of golden light into the Elder Wand. It rioted and jerked out of Voldemort’s hand, flipped up in the air three times before Harry caught it, easily. Voldemort was blown off his feet before the magic fueling the cage, his own Killing Curse, Harry’s wordless, instinctual counter-spell—all of it shot down and held him in a vice. It funneled and swirled, Voldemort’s mouth going wide and his eyes burning as Harry forced him to experience all of it, as Harry forced him to
. Kreacher will show him.”
“You never need to apologize for needing my help. You will always have a place here.” Her hands shook slightly. “You’re a good man, Harry, with a good heart. What happened tonight doesn’t change that. Sometimes, you can’t blame yourself for the evil others do in your presence. Sometimes, the only thing you can do is save yourself, and you should never regret that. The important thing is you’re alive, and you’re going to be all right. You’re safe,” she murmured, almost to herself. She combed his hair back and tucked it behind his ear. “You’re safe, Harry.”
wasn’t he telling her, and Ron? Why did he think this was any different than what they’d already been through? He could tell them about being a horcrux, and he could tell them about Goyle, and Millicent Bulstrode, and…
Kreacher looked like he was about to start crying again, but thankfully he pulled himself together. He chewed on his bottom lip, long bony fingers playing with the edge of his clean pillowcase, as if making a decision.
Bill actually laughed and shot Harry an apologetic look, which Harry only saw because Malfoy had looked back at him with a furrowed brow and he’d had to glance away quickly. Because apparently he was twelve again and looking at people who were looking at you was beyond his skill to handle.
“This is the same Ministry who launched a moderately successful misinformation campaign against you for an entire year,” Malfoy said simply, frowning, “the same Ministry who caved, with very little struggle, to—Voldemort.”
Not with Teddy so close.
him, and he was asking the same unspoken question Harry had seen in his tired, red-rimmed eyes three months ago amongst the ruins of their school.
The Malfoy sitting between his parents, face blank and eyes hollow? Harry knew that Malfoy better than he wanted to.
No reason beyond the curdled shame in his stomach and the hard knot of fear which had taken root that blood-soaked morning he’d chosen not to tell them the truth about the horcruxes. Layered one on top of the other, they doubled and expanded—his heart started to pound fast against his sternum the longer he stared into the flickering green flames.
Unbidden, the photograph of Dumbledore and Grindelwald as teenagers swam to the front of his mind. Dumbledore and the boy he had apparently loved so much he had stood aside as the world burned.
Harry stood there for thirty seconds before he sat down hard. The weight of his body seemed to weld him to the wood beneath his legs and feet. He waited to get the urge to call Ron back, to apologize, to fix this while he still could. But it didn’t come. Maybe some of that had been true, then. Maybe he really did want to be alone.
“On accident,” Robards said, a measure of authority entering his voice again. “If you’ve been lying to us for the past thirty minutes, and you actually did intend to murder Gregory Goyle when you left the Ministry tonight, please—tell me. Even if I thought you were that kind of person, which I don’t think you are,” he added as Harry tried to interrupt, “I still think you’d be honest about it if pressed. Am I wrong?”
Because we’re supposed to be
Ron stomped around, shoving a hand through his close-cropped hair. He must have gotten it cut recently. “The fuck is wrong with you? I was out there for thirty minutes! I’m surprised I didn’t get any muggles calling their po-leesh men on me!”
have wanted.
“What? No. I didn’t say that.”
“Key word being ‘nearly,’ yeah. He survived, didn’t he? How do we know that wasn’t his plan all along? He could have turned hours before but he waited until the last second.”
Harry spent longer than he meant to out on the beach, tossing stones until his feet were numb and his eyes burned from the wind and nothing else.
If Harry’d been able to laugh, he might have at that—it was nearly the same as what Robards had said to him his first day of questioning.
Hadn’t he just said as much to Percy that morning? He hated that he was worrying about this, about Malfoy and whether or not he was being honest and actually helping or just playing the Ministry for fools. It didn’t matter either way. It was a good thing, if he was. And if he wasn’t, that’d be in character, so there was nothing to get worked up over.
After a while, he let his hands drop. He turned back to the ocean. Tried to find again that sense of quiet.
“Harry!”
Harry’s throat closed and his eyes went wide in panic. He hadn’t heard that voice in months. He wasn’t supposed to hear it anymore, its owner was dead,
“Don’t.”
the ones who finished it. And now you want to punish
Ron set his drink down hard on the table. “Well, why didn’t you just say that first? That git would ruin anything.”
“I thought he was keeping it secret,” he said after a long pause, frowning at Malfoy’s knowing stare. In fact he knew Voldemort hadn’t told anyone. He knew Voldemort had searched for it on his own, going through the wands of his followers for one strong enough to overcome their shared bond.
He scrubbed his hands through his hair as he paced back and forth.
Harry exhaled. “No.”
Gritting his teeth and muttering, “Sod this,” he picked at the little scab which had healed over on his middle finger. A drop of blood welled up again, and before he could stop himself he pressed it onto the page where he thought the writing began.
She was afraid of him.
Panic gripped his heart, but he couldn’t move away from the crib. If he just kept watching Teddy, if he stayed here in this room, he could pretend last night wasn’t real. Teddy was so good, he radiated it, and Harry didn’t want to leave.
because they deserved it, right? Nothing to make a fuss over, not if they’re
Malfoy flinched like he’d been struck. Just like in the ruined courtyard, his gaze flicked up unerringly toward Harry, sending him a static shock and a stab of a needle-sharp attention.
His wand slid out of Goyle’s loose grip. Before he could stop himself, Harry looked down at Goyle’s face.
Because he was looking solely at Malfoy, Harry saw the moment he decided to act.
“Here you are, dear,” Andromeda murmured, putting something soft into his hands.
“They’re not my people,” Harry said harshly. “They’ve never been my people.”
“It’s fine,” he said at once. “I understand.”
A flash of silver silenced him. A sick, wet thud following soon after. A dark shape dropped to the ground before Neville’s feet.
“No. He didn’t.”
It took him a moment to realize someone was saying his name. He looked up, saw everyone in the room staring at him with various levels of concern or fear.
Harry flicked his wand at the curtains and they slammed shut at once. At least the house still liked him.
The conclusion of that thought slammed into him like a brick wall.
The place where Voldemort had buried his power, had remade him, was empty. And it was all he could do not to collapse in on himself at the loss.
And then Malfoy had gone and covered for him. He had lied to his parents. To protect Harry.
Bill frowned, eyes distant in thought. “Yeah, I’d appreciate the records if you can find them. I was talking about the one near Chedworth. They’ve got a curse layered into the surrounding hills which keeps sucking my people into the ground and spitting them out fifty miles away. We’ve been combing the place for weeks and still haven’t found the source.”
Malfoy’s jaw worked as they stared at each other but if he intended to say anything, it wasn’t coming out. Harry looked down into those pale grey eyes and saw every bit of Malfoy’s fear screaming up at him. Every bit of helplessness. Everything he had witnessed through Voldemort’s eyes when he’d forced Malfoy to torture Rowle and watch as Nagini desecrated the corpse of Charity Burbage. Harry hated how he understood everything Malfoy wasn’t speaking aloud. He fucking
As Harry filled his third plate, feeling full for the first time since he’d left Shell Cottage, he wondered if Molly wasn’t hiding out in the kitchen waiting to spring out and shove a whole roast ham down his throat. The guilt of that thought slowed him up a bit.
Not for the first time, the knowledge that Dumbledore had effectively chosen that life for him sat heavy like a stone in his stomach.
He fought the urge to look over his shoulder to check if Ron was coming back with the drinks. “You, er, haven’t spoken to Ginny in a while, have you?”
Usually, though, it only happened when you were trying to cast. Not so usually when you didn’t even have a wand in your hand.
“It’s stupid,” Fleur said sharply, her accent turning the words sharp and deep. “Our ministry tried the same thing after the Second World War and it was horrible. It nearly crippled the school, we lost so many students, so many children got left behind who never managed to catch up.”
Voldemort screamed in outrage and slashed his wand through the air. His attackers went flying back into the crowd. He turned horrible, rage-filled red eyes on Draco, who was still staring down at the corpse of his aunt, lost in his own world and frozen in the center of the fighting.
Tom’s smile went wide in triumph. “I know, Harry. It’s all right now. Just let go, and it will all be over.”
He stared for a long time. Long enough for the light to shift and the sun to come up.
“Yeah, I know.” Harry scowled down at the remnants of his breakfast, the half-eaten porridge and summer melon salad, his stomach turning unpleasantly. “I know.” He exhaled and rose, trying not to shove his chair. “I’m gonna…go for a walk. I’ll be back to help with the garden later.”
Percy stood there, looking if anything even more uncomfortable and guilty.
The beach fell away. The waves turned to shadow and the sand to hard, cold earth. The sky painted itself darker, roiling now with clouds holding black and grey shadows. The sound of lightning cracked in the distance.
Tonks must have learned the spell from her.
“Where are we, Kreacher?” he asked, nearly clipping a creaking cabinet full of garishly purple books decorated with fleur de lis, all of which seemed to be chronicling the adventures of Ogier the Dane, whoever that was. “I didn’t realize there was an attic this big up here.”
That’s what he was.
The fact that he wasn’t sure made a stone drop down into the pit of his stomach.
“No,” Bill said. “He wanted to, though. Dad would have joined but he’s out on a job right now. You’ve got a few well-meaning letters from my mum, too, so you can look forward to that when this is over.”
But he might be able to do something on his own. Just like always.
Harry had—
It made sense, he tried to tell himself, throwing stones into the waves, walking barefoot along the wet sand and rocks. The frigid temperature helped his mind to clear, the salt and the cold air coming off the ocean making it easier to breathe.
A tiny, barely audible
“Whatever you think about Prunelia Yeats,” Robards said quietly, “she’s a decent woman, who understands the need for discretion when it comes to sensitive matters.”
He stopped, staring through the window looking down onto the green in front of the building. Traffic lights reflected off the drops of water, flashing red, then green, then red again. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, and when he opened them he thought he saw a shape move behind one of the trees. He relaxed when another figure walked up to the tree and pulled the first out, both of them disappearing slowly down the road.
He paused, seeming to gather himself. “So you’re going to explain it to me, because I’m not going anywhere until you do.” His voice flipped into something frantic, eyes wide. “Is it a pride thing? Do you feel like you have to be the bigger person or something? Because you don’t. They don’t deserve that, and you know it.”
But there was nothing there. Nothing chasing him. It was all in his head. He couldn’t even remember anything beside the fire and screaming and fear, the weird nausea in his gut.
“Did Mr. Goyle often resort to physical violence when you were in school together?” Kamau asked, brow furrowed.
The smell of acid and sulfur snaked into his nostrils and he fought the urge to vomit. He couldn’t vomit because it would just make everything worse. He’d be punished and he couldn’t bear that room with the screaming again, so much screaming—
He was staring at himself, only it wasn’t him—the eyes were too large and the antlers… He had antlers sitting atop his head. A massive rack of antlers, too large, much too large for any animal to carry. As he watched, paralyzed, his mirror image smiled. Its mouth split wide, too wide. His whole head was separating. The inside of his mouth was a tunnel of dripping black ichor. His eyes burned green, the sickening, lightning green of death and sure enough the whistling sound of a scream cut through him—not his mum’s voice. It was someone else screaming.
The tightness along his forearms faded as heat spread down his face. Tears, though before they could fall they formed tiny crystals and lifted up into the air. Like frozen beads of dew, catching light and softly reflecting it back to him.
“I don’t want to do this with you. I don’t—want to fight. Not with you, or with Ron. But I can’t—” His voice broke and he blinked more tears from his eyes. “It’s really hard to look at you right now, and I don’t want to be around you while I’m… While I feel like—”
“It’s impossible,” Harry muttered. “You can’t stop it. It’s—pure destruction.”
“Er, I mean, what you’ve been making so far is fine?”
Bill took a deep breath. “And you’ll be on your own.”
He closed his eyes, gritted his teeth, hating the voice which slid so easily into his head. Why did Malfoy have to be right?
Edlefina blinked furiously and nodded, ducking her head to hide her tears. “Yes. I…” She gave Harry one last pained smile. “I…thank you. I’m fine, Daphne,” she added when it looked like Daphne was about to put an arm around her. She turned and walked back to the group, shoulders hunched.
Ron’s expression froze and he blinked a few times, like Harry’d thrown freezing water in his face. “What’s going on with you?” he asked, voice ragged. “Why are you being such a fucking tosser to everyone in your life who cares about you?”
Harry ignored him, dousing the lights as he went. Each one of them snuffing the last flames in his heart, leaving him cold and dark and alone.
The fresh night air greeted him, smelling of trees and leaves and the faint metallic hint of the city surrounding him. He took a few deep breaths before throwing a Silencing Charm around him, crouching down, and screaming into his hands.
When he came to again Bill was looking over him, eyes hard with fear. “—hear me?
A seagull startled him as it landed on the roof of the cottage, making him jerk to the side a bit and send a stone rolling down the hill. He wasn’t trying to hide or listen in but he knew Bill and Kingsley would stop if he announced himself. Bill and Fleur might not walk on eggshells around him but Bill definitely tried to keep talk about the Ministry to a minimum. Harry had appreciated it before, not wanting to hear about what a colossal mess it must still be so soon after Voldemort’s death.
Harry didn’t buy it. He wouldn’t.
, and then when you finally turn up in London you never even
Hermione gasped, looking both excited and exasperated. “Oh my god. She’s—she’s an absolute legend! She was one of the leaders of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 60’s. She led the charge for desegregation in the MACUSA Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She’s the foremost authority about human rights when it comes to racial relations in Wizarding America, and she’s worked on so many high profile cases, mostly serial killers and cult leaders. She’s also apparently a total badass when it comes to dueling. She’s won awards and everything.” Her expression dropped. “I suppose she’d understand completely what went wrong here, with her experience.”
Bill gave him a warm smile, doing his own cursory examination of Harry. He did a good job of hiding it, but Harry saw the spike of concern. He must look worse to everyone else, not having grown used to the hardness settling over him the past two weeks. At least Harry wasn’t covered in blood this time.
Again and again Regulus circled back to the relationship between body and soul, how one might manipulate it to push further the boundaries of what humans considered to be life and death. He had started getting messy at this point, his notes growing chaotic, his writing slanted. Three more books were mentioned,
Now that he felt a bit more like a person, he was realizing quickly that he’d landed himself back in Grimmauld Place, alone with nothing to do but think and drive himself crazy. The desire to crawl back into bed, to lay down and close his eyes and just stop trying to be all right when he wasn’t and never would be was so strong he felt gravity increase around him, pressing him down into the chair.
Harry didn’t flinch, but it was a close thing.
He had the vague impression of a big room, a church, maybe, full of white light and the distant sound of a whistle. Someone was with him but he couldn’t… Every time he grabbed for it, the feeling left, and he grew more and more frustrated. It hovered at the edge of his sight and no matter how far or how fast he ran to catch it, it eluded him. Remained just out of reach. He had never met a snitch he couldn’t catch but he couldn’t catch this feeling that he had missed something vital, left something behind when he woke up.
He waited for that voice of reason to reprimand him again, but it was quiet. He felt nothing but anger toward the whole bleeding lot of them. He couldn’t have stood there and not said anything. He would have hated himself if he hadn’t done something. He was right, he knew he was. So what if he’d gone about it in a violent way? Maybe the Wizengamot needed to be shaken out of its simpering superiority. Maybe Yeats had thought she could get away with scaring kids and hadn’t realized they might push back.
Sometimes Harry wondered if the world didn’t bend every now and then just to make him bleed a little more.
Maybe he’d never get the chance. He had to leave this house eventually, and if there’d been two people out there who still wanted him dead, who knew how many more were waiting?
“Felicity,” Robards said gently.
“Mopey,” Ron supplied.
Harry nodded, feeling now the presence of someone beside him. Familiar, but…further away than he thought they should be. He dug his bare toes into the fine grey pebbles, the line of the ocean washing in and out, and then out again.
Regulus had been crying.
Why wasn’t Malfoy moving? Why wasn’t he stumbling forward? The power in Voldemort’s voice…
It was heartbreaking, the first few times, to look down into Teddy’s eyes and see Remus staring back up at him. It helped that the boy’s hair kept changing color and length every hour, shooting down to his knees as he crawled across Andromeda’s worn plaid rug, only to reverse back up into his head when he sat down.
Standing in the little, quiet sitting room, looking up at a man who was nearly a decade older, someone he admired, Harry felt more of the tethers of his childhood slip away. He’d been of age for over a year, and on his own without help from any adult for most of that time. He’d seen more struggle than most would ever see in their whole lives, gone through worse than most people could possibly conceive.
When the noon bells sounded over London, Harry was standing in the middle of an empty flat, the entirety of which belonged to him.
Harry had no idea how to respond to that but was saved the trouble by Robards gesturing to the open seat and the two other people waiting.
“That’s what you meant! How does scaring kids make up for what happened to us, other than putting them through the same kind of trauma we went through? Tell me how that’s all right, and I’ll march up there to those animals and retract the whole thing. I’ll take it all back if you can give me one reason a fifteen-year-old kid deserves to bear the weight of her parents’ crimes,
Why was he making this harder than it needed to be?
And with a small pop, Kreacher was gone.
Especially not if they were killing fourteen-year-old kids.
The roots cracked and shrieked, the ground seized as he tried to claw his way back up.
If anything, Malfoy was far worse than the rest of them, even Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the bags under his eyes so dark they looked bruised. He’d lost weight. It had been too chaotic at Malfoy Manor and in the Room of Requirement but now Harry was paying attention. Malfoy was a shell of the boy who had stood in front of Dumbledore and chosen not to kill him.
“Don’t—you won’t like what you see.”
Harry frowned. “Yeah, he seemed…upset. Actually,” he added, “I’ve never seen him that upset before. He was—emotional. He said he was…trying to fix things. He blamed me for the death of his friend, Vincent Crabbe, and—” He cleared his throat. “He used to be close with Draco Malfoy, but I don’t think that’s true anymore.”
Harry didn’t know where to look as he waited, eyes wandering over the members of the Wizengamot absently, avoiding the area where he could still feel Hermione staring at him, like she was shouting and he was the only one who could hear her.
She seemed to be waiting for him to say something, her eyes intent like she wanted him to tell her she was wrong, that he loved her, that he just needed to figure things out but he was committed to making this work. Because she was that important to him.
anyone. He guessed Molly and Arthur knew, but he had no idea if Ginny had told anyone else. He was surprised, actually, that Molly hadn’t already tracked him down to make him feel guilty. Arthur’d probably told her to let him be.
“His mother was one as well,” Robards said quietly, his deep voice somber.
Harry nodded. He didn’t feel any better, if anything Bill’s healing had cut through the shock and he was now feeling every place Goyle had punched him, had sunk his knife in, had caught the edge of Harry’s shield with a spell and ripped through him. His breathing grew unsteady as he tried not to devolve into racking sobs.
He shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans, feeling like he was about to jump out of his own skin. He felt like there was too much space around him, which was mad because he had only ever felt like he needed more space to breathe—one of the charming perks of living in a five by three foot room for the first eleven years of his life. His chest was so tight he thought he was about to snap in two.
Goyle.
His own eyes were dry the rest of the night. When he left the Burrow three days later, he hated how easy it was.
Harry was rash and reckless, but he wasn’t an idiot.
And this was the thing Harry had been dreading. He knew how Sirius had felt about this place. He’d agreed, and part of him still understood with sharp clarity just how much weight this house carried, and wouldn’t it just be easier to go somewhere else, to leave all of this behind?
Bill must have sensed Harry’s growing discomfort, because after a month of Harry fighting the constant, low-burning urge to smash something or scream, Bill offered him a place at Shell Cottage with him and Fleur, if he wanted it. Harry jumped at the offer without thought, feeling guilty for leaving only when Molly looked at him with big, sad, teary eyes and practically begged him to stay. In the end, Arthur had been the one to talk her down, clapping Harry on the shoulder with tears in his own eyes and telling him he was always welcome, that he was family.
He’d only made it a few steps back to Andromeda’s when Kingsley said, quietly, “Harry.”
stupid.”
Harry watched in horror as another hand swam into his vision, pale, bony fingers clutching a thick black wand. It flicked and the woman on the ground screamed, writhed, and he knew it would keep going and going until she finally gave up and—
There were only three people waiting for him today, including the intimidating white-haired man who had summoned him. They sat at a large table with a tray of glasses, a silver carafe, and a jug.
It wasn’t fair, not by a long shot, but he couldn’t get it out of his mind now he’d thought of it.
The reality of his life became too much to deal with, sitting there in his own chair in his own flat with no one expecting him anywhere, just—living. As a person. Instead of marinating in his own numbing thoughts, he locked up, fortified the existing wards and layered on a few he’d used when he was on the run with Hermione and Ron, realizing after that there was nothing inside of value since the majority of his things were split between Grimmauld Place, the Burrow, and Shell Cottage, and went for a drink at the Leaky Cauldron. This turned out to be bloody stupid, because the moment he stepped inside he was swarmed by well-wishers and grateful witches and wizards who began crying and telling him about all the people they had lost in the war, as if Harry wanted to know. He managed to drink one pint over the course of an hour before he finally bailed, having to duck out the back door and sprint down the street before a group of old men tried to get him to sing another rendition of Odo the Hero.
He wasn’t supposed to know anything about this, after all.
Harry exhaled, frowning at the rush of feeling. Malfoy had always been able to get a rise out of him, but this felt—
it had been a while. He’d never treated getting off as a competitive sport like the other boys in his dorm did. Also, by the time Harry felt it more as an urge than something nice to do sometimes, the object of said urges was his best friend’s sister, which kind of dampened things when he knew there was a good chance Ron would hear him and open up a whole Pandora’s box of nightmare-scenario conversations.
“You know what.”
“Could you come over here for a second?”
The tension between them went taut as Malfoy narrowed his eyes.
Harry scanned the headlines. They were rather predictable—notices of persons still missing from the war, stories about the relief effort and the Ministry rebuilding, calls for anyone with knowledge of lingering death eater sentiment or activity to come forward and inform—and not until he got to the bottom of the page did he realize what Bill must have meant.
Bill scoffed. “As if you have any idea what that woman is capable of.”
The scene froze. Bellatrix’s eyes were locked in wide surprise. The hint of a vindictive smile still tugged on her mouth. It made her look like Sirius. The moment folded. Harry took in a sharp breath.
“Don’t,” Andromeda said quietly. Her wand glowed yellow and green as she did something to his hand which made Harry painfully aware of the precise placement of his fine bones. “Don’t tell me where you’re going. The fewer people who know, the safer you’ll be.”
He’d died.
Harry held his gaze, torn between wanting to listen and let that be enough, but he couldn’t. Not because he didn’t know how he felt about Kingsley’s presence, but because that
At the time, he hadn’t thought about the younger ones, who probably had no idea what was going on.
“They wouldn’t.”
could understand him. But once again, the house seemed to respond, the door opening up a little wider followed by the sound of a tap turning on and a shower curtain being drawn.
It was getting hard to remember why it was so important, though.
When Bill turned back, Harry couldn’t help himself. He had to do something. He couldn’t just stay here, especially with Andromeda and Teddy… “Bill, I can’t—”
of a boy. I will make you regret the day you ever—”
Had it been real? Or was it just Dumbledore making him think it was better for him to be an emotional wreck, better to be an open wound? Maybe he thought letting Harry get himself killed would be a blessing. Maybe he thought, if he could push Harry so far to the edge that he was barely hanging on, Harry would want to die. Maybe Dumbledore thought he was doing Harry a favor by telling him he had no choice but to accept that his life was nothing but a series of stabs through his broken, tainted heart.
“I didn’t think you’d try to take everyone else out with you. I didn’t think you’d start in on the
But every time he sat down and tried to relax he smelled smoke, and he felt a prickling sensation of breath on the back of his neck. He felt like someone was watching him.
Harry took a moment to pull himself out of those horrible, cold hallways. To separate himself from the knowledge that he did not have to wonder how someone lived with that kind of darkness. He’d been living with it for eighteen years.
“Harry’s been fighting this war since he was baby,” Kingsley said. “You don’t come through something like that unscathed. Give him time.” His voice raised, sounding more sure. “He’s the only one who knows what he needs. Until then, just being there for him is probably the only thing we can do. Mind passing on the message that I’m around, if he ever needs to talk?”
“Well.” He frowned at the empty fireplace, which looked freshly swept and cleaned. “That’s sorted, then.”
Malfoy stared, doubtful. “All right.”
The first barrier sprang into place when he reached the center ring. A discordant shriek stabbed at him from behind. He gritted his teeth, holding the magic in place as the outside force tried to knock it loose.
They didn’t ask about the kids in Azkaban or the girl they’d killed. Presumably, this Yeats woman wasn’t going to change her mind anytime soon about their sentencing. He’d nearly brought it up himself after two hours, but he stopped himself. He was here to help. They wanted him to help. Harry could do that.
The white light consumed his vision, and then Goyle was dead.
“Five days,” Ron started, voice unsteady with the anger Harry knew was ready to burst out of him. “Five
It’s not like he’d ever decided on hard and fast rules for himself as to who he liked to look at. He’d liked Cho, but thinking back—it’d been her flying that caught his eye first, not so much her looks, though she had been very pretty. Ginny’d been a fixture in his life for a while before his body decided to go postal over watching her snog Dean, so it was never a conscious choice, was it? And, again, he’d fancied Fleur in the same way he fancied ice cream, because who the fuck didn’t fancy ice cream? So theoretically he liked girls who could fly, girls who were fit and—tall?
“What’s that look?” Hermione asked at once.
He had no one.
Part of him wondered if this wasn’t somehow his fault. He’d been mostly silent over the summer, stewing in his own despair and keeping to himself. Hermione, and Ron by extension, had been busy with their own lives. They were moving on, thinking about the future, making plans and
“Ginny’s going for that internship with the Harpies, right?” Charlie asked, grinning. “You can both go be world famous quidditch stars and make the rest of us normal sods feel terrible about ourselves.”
Harry wished he could shake her until she understood, because he couldn’t be the only one who saw how messed up this was. He couldn’t be the only person who didn’t think hurting children was morally reprehensible. The only person willing to stand up and actually
flat in London. Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was booming and George had brought him on as a full partner at the end of June. Ron, as he explained to Harry in minute, excruciating detail, had been saving up money and scouting the city for the perfect place. He had decked his flat out with entirely new furnishings, opting for a Scandinavian style that made Harry feel like he shouldn’t touch anything because it was so sleek and clean. It was aggressively ‘minimalist,’ apparently, which was very on trend. Whatever the bloody hell that meant. Harry just nodded along every time Ron started talking about his new Modern Aesthetic, happy for his friend, knowing what it meant for Ron to have his own space. Spending time with Ron was like a shot of fire-whiskey and Harry rode the high as long as he could.
Her lips twitched again. “I used to be a healer at St. Mungo’s.”
he could do was strap
And because Voldemort also
A foot scraped across the dirt path behind him.
For a while, Harry thought of nothing at all.
Carefully, he used his other thumb to brush the top of the box.
“The Elder Wand isn’t yours,” Harry said. “It’s mine. You can’t win.”
Harry firmed up his resolve, trying to shove away the last inklings of his own guilt. “I just wanted to make sure we had an understanding.”
“Patrick!” The old woman frowned, as if simply repeating the bloke’s name would jog Harry’s memory. “Patrick Van Buren!”
Harry didn’t feel weaker, though. It was more like—he could sense that something inside the box had been waiting for someone to open it. For someone to offer.
“And how do you know that?” Robards asked.
The forest was empty. The soft green light was gone, the ground behind him turning red and brown like fire. The colors brightened until it seemed the whole forest floor was aflame. The sweet smell of rot filled his nostrils as animals rustled in the dead leaves, ran for safety. More rustling—something was shifting under the leaves, sliding toward him in a smooth, sibilant pattern. He stood his ground, staring, unwilling to look away in case the thing coming toward him rose and struck.
Andromeda took his hand, folding it in both of hers and holding it tight. She looked down but not before Harry caught the tear rolling down her cheek.
Bill scraped a hand across his jaw, sighing heavily. “Of course. That’d be why everyone who touches it starts shouting in Kazakh. I think I’ll have time on Wednesday, if I don’t get called in for questioning.”
you don’t, you fucking maggot!”
“Right. Thanks.”
But he couldn’t ignore the creeping disgust he felt for the whole bloody place when he watched kids walk through the atrium on their own, faces drawn in fear, hands shaking where they were shoved into their pockets or clutched at their sides. He knew what it felt like to have the Ministry treat you like a delinquent.
He had
But he wasn’t. He’d stopped being that person the moment he killed Voldemort. He knew better now.
The boy who had come out of that forest would never face his death without a fight again.
“Well, then you
Britain has to offer, and it all came down to a handful of kids and their teachers hundreds of miles north of here.”
Malfoy’s jaw clenched. “I don’t want it.”
Voldemort. He would wait until Harry made his move because he took supreme enjoyment in making people struggle before he killed them. He liked to give people a shred of hope only to rip it away at the last second. He thought himself superior to every witch and wizard in this castle including Harry. He thought he was untouchable. Why rush an end he had been working toward for seventeen years?
He turned, wondering if this was how he was finally going to die—by home invasion when he was starkers and dumbly carrying nothing but his toothbrush.
you killed Vincent and then Draco, you got to him, you did something to him and how he… and now he—he won’t—”
He didn’t care how many mistakes Kingsley’d made. He didn’t care that his entire understanding of the man was built on the assumption that the people who knew what they were doing would never fail him. That if they tried, if they meant it, they would never let him down.
Nothing happened. No footsteps. Not even the shallow breath of someone terrified for their life. Malfoy’s face in the Room of Requirement flooded his mind, pale with fear and shock and reflecting the flames surging up to grab him. He tried to picture Malfoy kneeling and groveling just like his father as he tried to explain his actions and beg forgiveness. But another image—Malfoy’s face tight and close before his in the shadows of his home as he bent down to get a closer look at Harry, eyes flooding with conflict and the beginnings of defiance.
“Ravenclaw, right?” Malfoy continued, leaning indulgently against the fountain far closer to Harry than seemed safe—no more than three feet between them at best. “He would have been in fifth this year, I think. Bulbous blue eyes and a nasally voice with a penchant for hiding out in the girl’s toilet?” At the old woman’s shocked gasp, he smirked, “Yes, I remember giving him detention once. Did not take it well, poor chap. Think he might have cried a bit.”
The entire room flinched. Harry took a cruel, vindictive pleasure in the shock and outrage on the faces of the old witches and wizards in the Wizengamot. Kingsley, too, cracked his first expression of the day—a small frown, a furrowed brow. He saw Hermione shift out of the corner of his eye, as if she were about to stand up.
“Don’t worry about your adoring fans, by the way,” Malfoy added, the tone arch and artificial. “Just keep scowling like that and people will stop coming up to ask you to kiss their babies. Golden Boys aren’t nearly as attractive when they’re not eager for the attention.”
He closed his eyes. Frowned.
“What I was saying,” Robards said slowly, a note of that deep-running kindness in his voice now where he’d been all business before, “was that we don’t think they were working with anyone else. Or the evidence we found in their apartment led us nowhere.”
“What?”
The room was deathly quiet. Kingsley was looking down at Harry with a horrible pity and guilt in his eyes. Every single one of them was staring. Waiting. What else was he going to say? How much more of his heart did he have to offer up to them on a plate smeared with his own blood?
Harry cut her a sharp look before saying, quietly, to Edlefina, “I remember who you are.”
days. If you wanted to sulk in here by yourself, that’s fine, but you don’t get to ignore me and Hermione just because you’re
And then everything else slipped away. The end had come.
Heart beating in his throat, Harry got ready to run.
Harry blinked, realizing he was no longer in the bathroom, but sitting on a bed in a small room—Teddy’s room, he realized with a jolt. He knew there were only two bedrooms in the little cottage, but the knowledge that he was sitting so close to Teddy after he’d… He looked down and saw he was wearing a faded blue t-shirt and a pair of overlarge cotton trousers. On his lap was a striped pink and green fleece blanket. His right hand was wrapped up, and he only then remembered Andromeda telling him they’d wait on the Skele-Gro until later. Wouldn’t do to be fighting back a scream the whole time he was…questioned? Presumably Bill was bringing an auror back with him, or maybe he’d come and fetch Harry and they’d—
“You treat children like soldiers and you wonder why they fight back. Take away their families, their homes, and tell them it’s
you idiot,” Ron said, voice failing. “You know, my brother? The twin of my other brother who
it. He didn’t hate Hermione, of course he didn’t, but she was standing there looking at him like he was a freak—and he hated that more than all the rest combined. Because she was supposed to understand. Because if anyone in this whole world knew him, it would be her.
“And what’d she do to scare you off, then?”
Her nostrils flared. “How
Andromeda sent her keen gaze over him, dark eyes growing tight as she no doubt saw the strain of his isolation, the barely concealed anxiety which was so close to the surface of Harry’s thoughts now.
“Mr. Potter,” the white-haired man said in his gravelly voice. “It’s a pleasure. Gawain Robards, Head of the Auror office.”
Tom’s smile shifted into a smirk, hunger flashing in his eyes. Harry swallowed, heat licking up his spine. That look made his body riot, a conflicting storm of desire and disgust that began to coalesce into something that should have scared him. It shouldn’t make him feel like—this. Pinned and impatient and so, so willing. Tom was just a bit taller than Harry, tall enough to look down with hooded eyes as he took a step closer. Harry had to bite the inside of his cheek to stop whimpering. He was scared. He was furious. He was…
Voldemort’s expression slid into a cruel smile. Rage down through Harry’s lungs like a snake. He knew what Voldemort would do, because he
for something none of you could manage on your own? This whole building full of specially trained witches and wizards, the
He turned and gave Harry a look which once might have made his blood boil. Now it just made him uneasy. It was like looking into the face of what his father might have been at his age—cold, cruel, unreachable.
“Actually,” Robards interrupted, standing now with his full, imperious height, “I have a thought on that. We don’t know who else might be involved, if this was just the grudge of two schoolmates or something bigger. Until we know what we’re looking at, you’d be safer—”
He looked, Harry realized with a spike of discomfort, exactly like Harry felt.
He stared down into the face of the man who had hounded his steps his whole life, who had twisted Harry almost as much as he had twisted himself, and Tom Riddle stared back.
Malfoy—”
No, Dumbledore’d had an incredible amount of compassion. Just not when it came to Harry and the fate Dumbledore had decided for him when he was only a year old.
“I’m sure,” Ron laughed. “He offer you a job right away or did he make you wait for it to heighten the anticipation?”
Panic shot through him like fire and he jerked in the crushing grip. He was dying. He was letting himself be killed. He couldn’t, not after everything he’d gone through—he’d
, he knew that, and some part of his body bristled as he tried to recall. It was strange—he usually remembered his dreams. They were vivid to the point of prophetic, but he couldn’t…
A wry, pained smile pulled at Kingsley’s mouth. “Before you get started, you should know that it has always been my intention to minimize the amount of chaos the war left in its wake. Letting the public know that two Slytherin students attempted to kill someone the country thinks of as their hero would just fan the flames.” Even as Harry opened his mouth, Kingsley continued implacably, “I’m going to insist on this, Harry. For your safety and for the safety of the students you rightly championed in the trials.”
A flash of anger nearly unseated him. Through clenched teeth, he managed, “Would you mean it?”
Bill’s brow lifted. “I thought all the Welsh sentry dragons died in the Norman Conquest.”
He spent a lot of time on the beach and the hills near Dobby’s grave, walking through the little tufts of grass and watching the sea birds wheel over his head in the pearl-grey sky. The urge to run was weaker here, though maybe that was just because he could fly more often. Bill and Fleur lived far enough away from any muggles that he could go nearly an hour in both directions along the coast, sometimes taking lunch and flying out to a small island which was little more than rock a few miles from shore. The best thing about Bill and Fleur was that neither of them questioned what he was doing, that they trusted he wasn’t stupid enough to fall off his broom and didn’t stand there watching him until he was back and safe. Maybe it was just because they were younger than Molly and Arthur but Harry didn’t feel like he needed permission when he decided to pop off to the village on his own. They didn’t come and check on him when he stayed out a bit later than normal. Fleur just called his name when she needed him, or Bill would come home and wave him in for dinner.
The silence grew oppressive, and Harry found he could only nod.
It certainly looked like the kind of thing Walburga Black would deem a suitable gift—the stalks a putrid shade of brown and yellow, a bit of puss leaking from a few lesions at the base, the petals shriveled up so tight Harry had no idea what color or shape they were supposed to be. It was still alive, though, as the pot it was kept in wouldn’t let it die. After Walburga’s death, no one had seen fit to take care of it, and Kreacher had tucked it away safe somewhere until a member of the family returned to coax it back to life. Sirius had apparently scoffed at the mention, tried to throw it into the fire right away.
Bill snorted and Andromeda smiled.
Standing at the base of a rolling mountain, clouds gathering at the top. Smelling the chill of sea water and rain as it cut past his face. He was needed, somewhere, somewhere that no longer existed. That belonging stretched until it was taut, the tether around him choking until he felt panic surge up like fire around him. A shout in the darkness, over the shrieking of beasts and the crackling of stone as it dissolved into nothing.
“And Sirius had his mother’s bracelet hanging on one?”
No one made so much as a gasp, not since Voldemort had last shouted them mute. Harry opened his eyes a slash. They all stood there on the other side of the ruined courtyard and he couldn’t spot Hermione or Ron. He couldn’t tell which figure in red was Ginny. All of them were covered in ash and grouped together in a gathered dark blur.
Did murderers get to move on and find love?
The song layered over him and bolstered him, the blue-white light from his wand strengthening with every note, tugging out of him all the bound up emotion he’d been carrying with him since he had walked down from Dumbledore’s office. Forms coalesced in the light around him, the shapes of all the people he’d lost, of one person in particular with long robes, half-moon spectacles, and a gentle face, floating just beyond the edge of his sight.
Harry cleared his throat and turned back to Bill. “Sorry?”
Because he’d decided the moment he’d risen from the staircase after Ron had left that he needed to recast the Fidelius Charm on Grimmauld Place.
What was he doing?
Harry narrowed his eyes. “You’ve never seen me play.”
He was sitting in her house, wearing what must have been her late husband’s clothes, clutching a blanket which had probably belonged to Tonks, with his godson in his crib only six feet away, and he’d killed someone only a few hours ago.
“It’s the Prophet,” Harry laughed, grabbing it and finishing his coffee, the heat scalding his throat in a pleasant, smoky way, “of course I won’t like it.”
Harry’s heart jumped even higher up in his throat.
He knew he’d be in for it when the Quibbler came out in a few weeks’ time—its first issue since Xenophilius had stopped production after Luna’s capture. The man had been understandably eager to print whatever Harry wanted. Most likely he still felt bad about trying to hand him over to the death eaters that one time, and conducted an informal interview right there on the spot. It’d be a small piece, short and to the point, and it would give him the publicity to get the magazine back up and running again. He’d asked for time to put the business back together, see if he couldn’t get a few more people to confirm his story—though he’d reassured Harry he would print the story regardless—and Harry had thanked him. That night, he slept better than he had in months.
“You’d know better than I.”
“This one was flagged for us, though, because not only was the level of damage too extensive for the normal Magical Law Enforcement Squad or the Improper Use of Magic Office, but reports from the scene indicated that a dark witch was involved, and present at the site. I was the only one in the office at the time, so I went on my own to investigate. Only, it wouldn’t have mattered when I arrived, because…” She hesitated, a look of deep unrest crossing her prim features. “The entire building was in the process of collapsing due to a curse known as the Disintegration of Morgan Le Fay.”
“I have to, Bill.”
Harry closed his mouth where it’d been hanging open. His arms shook and a headache began to thrum behind his eyes, but he’d done it. He’d done
The figure sighed. “So much. So, so much.”
When it came down to it, the Fidelius Charm wasn’t actually all that complicated.
His body felt strangely disconnected from his mind, which was horribly, painfully aware his best friend had… She’d… His mouth was moving before he realized what he was saying, pulled up from the same hollow void he’d been living in since the day Voldemort died.
Harry hissed and fell onto his arse, recoiling at once. “Bloody hell,” he bit out. But it was just a small prick, a tiny smear of blood over the pad of his finger, like he’d accidentally jabbed himself with a needle.
He wasn’t a person to any of them. Just a name and a weapon. Just a tool.
Strange, to realize how all that had shifted over the past year. There wasn’t a line anymore between magic he knew because of school and magic he knew because it meant the difference between him or the people he cared about being hurt, being killed.
A flash of blinding grey-white filled his vision.
The smoke and dust cleared, sucked into the vortex and expelled out over the bridge and toward the lake. It was carnage, clear now amidst the bodies lying on the ground and the slashes of scarred rock and dark liquids.
He didn’t know why that mattered.
of them, hurt the worst.
Malfoy scanned Harry’s face, confusion slowly taking over his expression. When he didn’t find what he was looking for, he let out a hollow laugh. “Potter, why do you think I’m here?”
Ron carried on over Harry’s silence, building steam. “Hermione went to retrieve her parents after she sent them away so she could help
Shell Cottage didn’t feel like home anymore than the Burrow did but at least Harry didn’t feel like some interloper, like he was dragging grief and ghosts with him wherever he went. Maybe it was that he had never known Shell Cottage without the shadow of death. When he was here last, he had been mourning Dobby, readying himself for the moment he finally faced Voldemort.
He left twenty minutes sooner than he meant to, tired and irritable, in the cheap suit and robes he’d bought on Andromeda’s recommendation, his hair as tame as he could make it. It was probably too long but he wasn’t about to try cutting it himself and show up to the Ministry with great chunks of hair missing. His hair grew back fast but not
All he had to do was fix his broken soul and forget that he was screaming on the inside.
Playlist on
his family. He had no reason not to tell them.
Harry bristled at the arrogance in the man’s voice. “Voldemort forced him to torture people when they displeased him, probably got a sick kick out of making Draco do it for him. I know he was forced to watch at least one person he knew be murdered and then get eaten by a snake, a teacher from Hogwarts. Again, I don’t know the specifics, because we’re not, and have never been, friends, but I know how horrible it was. I do know that he chose to lie to protect me when I was brought to Malfoy Manor, and then again when he saw I was still alive at the very end.” Proulx opened his mouth to speak but Harry spoke over him. “He was the first person to attack Voldemort in the final battle. He killed his aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange. He surrendered along with his parents before Voldemort died and handed himself over to the Ministry without a fight. It’s not my job to say if he’s innocent or guilty, it’s yours. I’m just here telling you what I know. As for how I know, well.” He didn’t think they would take his word that he could sometimes see into Voldemort’s mind. And he wasn’t too keen on them knowing, if they did. “I just know. Guess you’ll have to trust me.”
“Handling Malfoy?” Ron asked, seemingly trying to keep his expression neutral.
Harry looked between them, blinking rapidly as he tried to regain his bearings. “I
He was going mental. He’d been cooped up in this bloody house too long.
Once, it might have stopped Harry, but he might as well have been speaking to a specter. Harry wasn’t here anymore. He was burning in the ruins of all the homes he never had. He was choking on the black water rising up over his head, pulled down by cold hands locked around his ankles.
“Ron,” Hermione chided, scowling as he rose from his seat. “You aren’t going for another, are you?”
“You are dismissed,” Yeats said, her tone growing sharp.
“I’ve never seen it in the field,” Felicity continued over the strange ringing in Harry’s ears, “and as far as I know, it’s been out of common dark practice for,” she laughed nervously, speaking fast, “well, centuries. The only reason I recognized it is because I spent years studying Archaic Medieval Cursework, specifically that which pertained to the attempt to recover knowledge lost in the Norman Conquest, when the last of the Great Celtic Sorceresses died, for my post-N.E.W.T. concentration in—”
A tall, thin slash of light amidst the soft expanse of sand and sea. They were just standing there. Waiting. They seemed to notice him after a while, not turning exactly, but Harry felt their attention.
Nagini was dead. The final horcrux was gone.
There was only one person he saw right away in sharp detail.
- "Land of All" by Woodkid
Ron and Hermione were too busy to answer their floo, doing something he tried hard not to think about. George was working and Harry couldn’t even pop down and help because every time he so much as offered, the mannequins started lopping him over the head with umbrellas. Everyone else was due to arrive in the next few days for preliminary questioning. He was the only one called in for the full week before the trials started.
He took an unconscious step forward, sending another wave rippling through the Wizengamot. He could see bald fear on many faces now. He knew it should have been a warning, but it was just fuel. They were scared. They were all fucking scared, and he didn’t care.
Harry nodded again, trying to pull his hand back from Teddy. But the kid bit down, or gummed down, though there was a definite hardness to it now, like he’d start getting his teeth soon. “Kinda need that back, mate,” Harry whispered, tugging out his hand and wincing at the sound of loss Teddy made. “Yeah, I know. Sorry. If the other one doesn’t get fixed, you can have it.”
“I don’t know. I would have said from one of their families but all three homes were raided within days of the last battle. Something that dark would have been spotted, even if it was hidden.”
been through? Didn’t he deserve that just as much?
Ginny seemed determined to ignore this, though, and when she led him into her room, pushed him down on her bed, and told Harry she wanted him to make love to her—Harry couldn’t imagine saying no, even if the rational part of his mind knew that was impossible, because to make love you needed to feel it first, presumably. He was supposed to want this. He was
Harry took his time to raise his eyes. He exhaled and unclenched his hands, rolled his shoulders back, and made sure his body was under control by the time he met Kingsley’s steady, impenetrable gaze. A gaze which reminded Harry terribly of Dumbledore’s after Sirius’s death, when he had watched Harry destroy his office, impassive and distant. He’d expected to feel guilty when he finally faced the Minister, but all he could feel was a kind of barely-controlled anticipation. A mounting tension.
Malfoy had been the first of a slew of other students, almost all of them Slytherin, he’d been asked about. Their families, their homes, did he know them well, would he consider them to be dangerous, how would he characterize their views on the Ministry of Magic and muggles in general, et cetera. He could only say, “I have no bloody idea,” so many times before they realized he had, in fact,
He was three-quarters of the way there when Malfoy saw him.
Harry and Ron stood there staring at each other, both of them breathing hard, making the silence all the more horrible. That same gulf he’d felt between him and Hermione in the atrium bathroom had opened up between him and Ron, and he felt all at once a stranger. Ron had no idea,
Harry stared, and laughed. Because
Harry stared at Ron. “You’re kidding.”
And it’s not like he was anything special anymore. He didn’t have any great destiny or goal. They didn’t have to put up with him ever again if he became too much of a liability.
Harry’s breath was coming fast and sharp, his mouth locked shut in case he decided to start screaming.
have ignored Ron. Probably. He’d been getting letters from Bill and Andromeda. Apparently Kreacher had decided not to tell him about the others. Or, more likely, Andromeda had asked him to let Harry rest rather than bombarding him with questions from people he didn’t want to speak to right now. He felt a small swell of affection for her, quickly doused when he caught Ron’s expression.
But her eyes were big like her sister’s. Big and frightened.
“No,” Harry said forcefully, stepping toward Ron, “keep going. What were about to say? That I was playing the hero? That I’m just having a temper tantrum and
“I’ll have Bill check in on you tomorrow to make sure your hand’s healing correctly. You’re going to have to do the Skele-Gro yourself.” She pierced him with a black stare. “Every eight hours for the next twenty-four hours. After that, you’ll need to sleep as long as you can. I’ll send you with something to help. Don’t try to do anything more strenuous than walking. Not for a few days.”
When Harry next awoke, he felt…well, he felt tired as hell but otherwise, suspiciously good. He wiped the drool from his mouth and propped himself up on his elbows, confused for a moment as to why he was wearing his trousers and shoes in bed. It almost sent him down a spiral thinking he was back in the wilderness camping with Ron and Hermione.
Malfoy didn’t even react. He stared, and did nothing.
“That depends. I was one when he killed my parents to get to me, then he tried again when I was eleven. Had a few nice years there where he left me alone, then he tried again when I was fourteen and fifteen. After that it was any time he got the chance, really.”
He hadn’t told them anything.
Kingsley’s eyes closed, and it was like his whole body shrank. Fatigue settled on his shoulders. Harry could see the tension all over him, the pain in the crease of his brow. He looked like he was barely holding himself together.
had caused her. “My wand,” he whispered, voice breaking. “My—”
He massaged his shoulder, rolling out his arms as he rotated his neck, reaffirming that each body part still worked. There were faint scars on each forearm, but they weren’t angry. They looked long healed over, like he’d had them for years. Even so, the blood magic must have nearly drained him.
Kingsley said firmly over Harry, “you will respect the authority of this court or you will be—”
Harry trailed off, registering the startled look in Malfoy’s eyes.
She was middle-aged, with a no-nonsense bun and little, if any, make-up. Harry couldn’t help but compare her to Amelia Bones, the woman who’d served as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement before her, a woman whose power of presence was a thing you could feel like an aura around her. A woman Voldemort had murdered personally because he needed her out of the way.
“This is the end,” Harry murmured, lifting his wand as the bead of light slid toward the tip of the Elder Wand. “There’s no one else, Tom. Just you and me.”
from you?” Harry laughed. “Yeah. I bloody well hope so. You think I want to keep anything that belongs to you if I can help it?” He registered what Malfoy had said. “Wait, you know—”
But to go after the kids who hadn’t even
“I’m not sure, that is—I think Professor Dumbledore suspected Voldemort chose Malfoy—Draco,” Harry added, frowning, “to punish his father, for being caught and arrested at the battle which took place a year before. Here. In the Department of Mysteries.” He swallowed the painful knot in his throat. “I don’t think he ever expected Draco to succeed. I think he always meant for—Severus Snape to be the one who killed him.”
He closed his eyes, tried to find one happy memory he could grab onto. It was like trying to hold water in his hands. He’d been so aimless and lonely, so angry, he couldn’t find anything in recent memory that was strong enough. And then—he stopped on one thing he knew was good, more so than anything that had happened to him in months.
pushing Goyle off him enough to get back onto his knees, trying to put some space between them. He just needed a moment to breathe, then he could paralyze Goyle, and—
Her hand was shaking as she kept it pointed toward him, desperation in her face. “Harry, I’m sorry, but I need to be sure—” She jerked back when he stepped toward her.
“Harry, we
Harry waited until Kingsley met his gaze again. “You should also know that I’ve recast the Fidelius Charm on my home. The one I inherited from Sirius,” he added when Kingsley’s face remained blank.
“We were all kids.”
you have to stop moving. I promise the pain will go away soon, but I need you to relax.”
frowning when it came out every bit as bright as it normally did. The feeling lingered, but as he went through a few more easy spells, levitating a book from the table, cleaning a bit of dust from the shelf in the corner, there was nothing wrong with the magic. Had the strain of the spell pushed it too far? The Fidelius Charm was powerful, even if it hadn’t been particularly difficult to cast. And after the magic he’d conjured to kill Goyle…
to get to me.”
“I know you and him don’t get on,” Bill said carefully. “Frankly, I was predisposed to hate the little bastard from the start, but he’s been nothing but helpful all summer. It’s kind of annoying, actually. It’s like he gets a kick out of being accommodating just to buck our expectations. Well. Mine anyway.”
He’d asked Sirius if it hurt. What a stupid fucking question. How could dying be worse than the life he’d lived? He’d actually been scared. And here he was, alive and broken and hurting so badly he sometimes couldn’t breathe.
And you’re pissed we left you alone? Why didn’t you fucking say something instead of disappearing and shacking up with Bill and Fleur?”
Her smiled dimmed as she slid her glasses back up the bridge of her nose. “You would have known my sister, Charity, I think.”
And after everything
No one else looked even slightly perturbed.
Harry nodded. “It’s like fiendfyre.”
Robards sat with a sigh, rubbing a large hand across his chin, scratching his beard. Harry forced himself to look at Robards, to ignore the little shocks of pain in his hand, running up his arm.
Her brow twitched, surprise taking over her features. “I… Fina’s been through a lot. I hope you’re not—”
“I’ll get right on that, then.” He eyed Malfoy sideways, noting that he looked no better than he had the last time Harry had seen him. A little too gaunt, a haunted look about the eyes. But he still, to Harry’s immense annoyance, managed to look like he’d walked straight out of an advert in one of Aunt Petunia’s old fashion magazines—handsome in that ‘don’t touch me, I’m better than you’ way. It didn’t help that his suit was frustratingly sleek and his white-blonde hair was styled to within an inch of its life. Also, he wasn’t covered in plaster dust and blood this time, so that was an improvement.
“I think it was extreme when they started trying to round up muggleborns and
“No, no, it wasn’t like that.” Harry set his drink down and leaned back in his chair, frowning. “It was fine, actually. Just a surprise, I guess.”
Maybe it was all in his head. Maybe it wasn’t real.
Harry didn’t know how to respond to that, another wave of guilt souring his stomach. He truly didn’t think he’d ever be able to accept the absolute servitude of house-elves, and he didn’t think he wanted to. “Right. Well. I can certainly look through them, if you want.”
Her jaw clenched and she flushed dark red, but she kept her mouth shut as she followed him further into the atrium, round the back of the fountain. There wasn’t really any place to talk unless she wanted to shove him into one of the private toilets, but they were at least out of earshot of most people. He checked his pockets just in case, though. He’d found a listening bean in his jacket a few days ago and a tac in the sole of his trainers which would record his movements. Apparently they weren’t above illegally spying on people for their stories. Though, he shouldn’t have expected anything less from the British Media. He should just be happy Rita Skeeter hadn’t shown up yet.
“HARRY! I know you’re in there! If you don’t open this door—you
their school. So I have to say something, because no one else will. You’re using these kids, the ones you’ve got upstairs in another courtroom with bombs on their legs, to scare this country into falling in line. You can say it’s out of caution, but it’s cruel. That’s all. You don’t care about them. You don’t care what they went through. Well
They were kids. Most weren’t even of age. If it had just been Malfoy, he might have understood. It would have been overkill, but fine. He was a death eater. He’d taken the dark mark. That was a choice. He’d turned before the end and when Harry let himself admit it, he was one of the reasons Harry was even alive to kill Voldemort. He might even understand the other seventh years. But the rest of them…
Before Daphne left she dropped her gaze, head still turned toward them. “She’s not the only one, you know,” she murmured. “A lot of us regret what happened.”
His brother, and not with Harry.
Harry didn’t belong here. Or—perhaps he simply wasn’t expected.
It must have taken his patronus some time to get to its intended recipient, but it felt like one second Harry closed his eyes, and the next a loud crack broke the silence.
He should go back and apologize. He knew he should. Hermione meant well. Of course she did. They could talk about this and… Fuck, he didn’t know. But whatever it was would probably be better than him sulking by himself in a park at night.
Harry hadn’t seen the Minister for Magic since the week after the battle, when he had gripped Harry’s shoulder tight and thanked him, giving him a sad but warm smile. It had been nice. Harry had always liked Kingsley. It made him a hell of a lot more willing to trust the Ministry for choosing someone he knew had the best intentions. Once he’d taken office, though, he had necessarily not been around much anymore. If Bill and Arthur were overworked, Kingsley must be run ragged.
The person who had walked calmly to his death would have told them. He would have told them straight away and let them carry some of the pain that festered in his chest like rot. That person would have been more understanding to all the people who wanted to thank him, to touch him, to cry on him and praise him. He would have taken it as a responsibility to be there for everyone, to help them, and so help himself. He should want to be with them, shouldn’t he?
(See the end of the chapter for
The moment Harry stood up, he felt dizzy, his legs protesting something fierce, his body hunched and refusing to straighten out.
But Narcissa’s voice broke the last tethers of Harry’s control—urgent and steady, the same voice which had asked Harry if her son still lived, which had called to Draco across a field of enemies.
He wanted to so desperately he felt his eyes burn with unshed tears.
Ron snorted darkly. “And you thought I’d leave before you had to drag yourself down here, didn’t you?”
Hermione had thought he was under a spell.
“Oh, I know, you’re very busy. I’m not needling.” Her smile was warm and gentle, and Harry felt like the world’s biggest prat for not checking in sooner. “The trials start soon, don’t they?”
Excepting the unavoidable truth, of course, that he was still a horcrux. Or he might be. He didn’t actually know. He had been, obviously, before Voldemort tried to kill him in the Forbidden Forest, but was he still one? Voldemort had died, so clearly…
His body jerked and pain flared in his right hand. He screamed before he managed to close his mouth. He hurt everywhere. He’d hadn’t hurt this much in years, not since Voldemort had tried to possess him in the Ministry. He was on fire. He’d never left the Room of Requirement and the fiendfyre had followed him—
“Of course not. It’s because I’m taking this so seriously that I want to make sure I give you my full and enthusiastic cooperation with any and all parts of this trial.”
Harry let out a sharp, ragged laugh, magic flickering in the palms of his hands. His vision was going spotty. His heart was racing. He felt like he was pitching forward through thin air without a broom or a wand to stop his fall. He was spiraling into dangerous territory, and he didn’t bloody care.
Malfoy took a while to respond, face tensing as if he were fighting with himself. “Unfortunately, I think some people would take issue with my fleeing the country at the moment.” His voice lost some of its nonchalance as he continued, “Aren’t you here about the trials? Or did the Ministry walk you in on a velvet carpet and give you your pick of any of the open jobs?”
