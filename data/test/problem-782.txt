Draco unfolded the note.
“I don’t see a reason for him to keep up a lie for so long,” he shrugged.
He made it back to his hotel room, checking the time - it was two in the morning. He changed into his night clothes, staring at the silk pajamas in his suitcase. Walking into the bathroom, he gazed at the silver streak in his hair which was turning darker and darker, back to his original hair color. Harry didn’t know if he was relieved or surprised. Perhaps both.
“Harry? Harry!” Hermione panicked, trying to shake him awake.
“Letter from someone?” she asked, taking it from the owl and handing it to Draco, who was wide awake now. His parents had never sent letters except for news about Narcissa. A dark feeling in his chest overcame him as he opened the letter.
Harry pushed his hair back which revealed his white roots at the specific strands again. Usually, nobody noticed the white bits, but Snape did. He saw. The white strands in Harry’s hair were almost halfway to the ends of his hair. A few seconds later, Snape noticed how Draco too seemed to have a weird shade of brown in his hair.
, and instead of telling me this, you let me reject his
“Don’t you fucking even try to finish that sentence, git.”
“Do you think him and Pansy are talking about it right now?” Ron asked. The three stared at each other in silence.
Cho stared at him now, wide-eyed. “That’s exactly it,” she whispered. “You’re… a good teacher, you know.”
He had sent a few letters to Harry over the course of the next two weeks, but did not hear back from him. The impending truth was waiting for Draco, quietly, almost a small whisper that would haunt him on his sleepless nights. A quiet, calm yet eerie voice, telling him that Harry didn’t love him anymore.
“This is supposed to be a hate poem,” Draco pointed out. “About these two people bickering and arguing all the time.”
Hermione and Ron watched Harry, both frowning. “Are you sure this is a good idea, Harry?” she asked, folding her arms. “I thought you and Malfoy had a deal... rules, whatever. Besides, he’s a Death Eater, remember? Can we trust-”
“Whoa, what’s the matter here?” said a familiar voice. Harry, who was hunched over the counter and took a bite out of the burnt apple pie, froze in his spot. It couldn’t be. But of course, it was. Turning around, his eyes met silver ones. Hermione, who was just behind Draco, frowned.
“Yeah, hopefully I’m still pronouncing the spells properly,” he said. Ginny watched him with uncertainty in her eyes, but didn’t say anything in response. As they entered the Three Broomsticks, Harry looked around, his eye catching Draco’s, who was sitting with Pansy and Blaise.
Lucius mumbled a spell and cast it on Draco before the silver-eyed boy could think; before he could move out of the way. It was a purple; large spell and seemed to loom over Draco before practically going inside of his body.
“He’s so in love,” Ron said, shaking his head, not realizing that anything was wrong. He got into bed and fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Draco nudged him. “...don’t laugh at me! You should’ve stopped me!”
“Pansy, shut up! We were just sleeping.” Draco said, rolling his eyes.
“Missed a deadline.” Draco slipped out. Harry’s head snapped in his direction. “He asked me to do something before the Winter Holidays, but I didn’t do it.”
“I…” he laughed slightly, confused. “I’m yours?”
“Well, that turned depressing quick,” Draco replied, finding himself smiling as the boy in front of him laughed, reaching forward and gently caressing his bandaged hand.
“Well, yes, but it could just be a wizard thing-”
“Don’t listen to your father. I want you to stay in Malfoy Manor, okay? Who knows what’s going to happen if you go without anyone with you.”
Harry shook his head, gulping. “I’m okay. I just…” he trailed off into silence, looking up at Draco, who was frowning, sincerity and worry etched upon his face. “I just remembered how much I love you.”
Harry sat back on the couch, shutting his eyes for a moment. He was barely listening to Draco. “He’s gone,” he whispered. “I can’t believe he’s gone.”
“They’re actually poems,” he mumbled, but shook his head. “I’m sorry you had to find out this way. I just didn’t know how you’d react to me being bisexual, let alone dating our worst enemy.”
“I’m not kidding, Harry. Please just stay away from me.”
Harry could tell this was going to be a long evening.
just be anyone else. Not to you.” Harry smiled slightly, “After all, I
“I don’t know, Draco, should you?”
Most people just shrugged it off, thinking it was because of how Draco had gotten hurt by Harry.
“What now?” Draco asked, not looking up from the book he was reading.
“It’s a party,” She said, a glass of Firewhiskey in her hand, “Pansy planned it. I don’t know why! I was supposed to be studying but Pansy forced me to stay. I have to admit, it’s been a bit fun. Where were you? The party started about an hour ago. Anyway, Draco’s over there. No one will notice you and him, so you can hang out if you want.” Hermione was talking really fast - it was clear that she was slightly drunk.
Draco took it.
“Professor, did you really just do that?” Draco asked, getting angry. “You have absolutely no right to look through-”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, it’s all good. We can start.”
“What?” Draco’s eyes widened, then he scoffed. “I didn’t take you as such a superficial person, Harry.”
Harry smiled for the first time that week as Draco stroked his hair. “I missed you so much.”
She looked at him, too tired to argue. Ever since the summer, he had become more self-deprecating then usual, which was inevitable, but it hurt her to see him like this, knowing there was nothing she could do to help.
“We can go with the first one,” Draco replied, smirking to himself.
“That’s the best kind,” Hermione said excitedly. “I know it’ll seem weird at first, looking at someone in a romantic way when you never even dreamed of liking them that way. But, in the end it’s the best kind. Unexpected love.”
“I know. I took it too far, and I know that. Honestly, I don’t know why this is bothering me so much. I guess it’s because, uh… a family member of mine is going deaf.”
“I could hear you guys running about,” she muttered, then shut the door behind her. “But that’s besides the point. Malfoy, you shouldn’t be here. Literally everyone in this residence right now hates you. They’ll accuse you of spying for your father!”
what you choose to respond to? For fuck’s sake,” she shook her head, then frowned when she noticed his expression. “Come on, Dray. We can go somewhere else if you want… hey, there’s your lover!”
********
“That’s really beside the poin-”
“I’ve been trying to use this book, but it’s not really helping. I mean, you saw me trying to sign ‘sorry’. I can’t do it,” he sighed. “I understand if you don’t want to help me. After everything you and me have been through, I think it’s actually expected. But… please think about it?”
“He’s hurt,” Harry explained. “I need to go get help for him at Hogwarts. Can you stay here with him as I do so?”
“You were stalking me?” Draco normally wouldn’t have minded. In fact, he would have been pleased. But not in this situation. In this situation, it was perhaps the worst thing possible.
“I’m fine,” he replied, chewing the inside of his cheek. “How was America?”
“...Yes?”
“And they’ve given us so much homework that I want to jump off of the Astronomy Tower,” Harry muttered, “I hate my life!”
Hermione and Harry exchanged glances before Harry sighed. “So, what does that mean?”
“Draco,” She sighed, almost in a disappointed tone, but she didn’t say anything further. She knew it was better to just nod along with his rants about Harry. He was impossible to reason with once he had his mind made up about him.
Draco put a hand to his cheek as he turned around to face him again. “Right, friends,” he nodded. “I suppose that’s all it is.”
“You can’t go alone!” Madam Rosmerta exclaimed. “Haven’t you… seen? Are you not aware?”
Meanwhile, Harry had slowed down, cursing under his breath when he realized he had forgotten his Invisibility Cloak. Shrugging, he felt the pounding in his heart increasing as he slowly got closer.
“Whatever works for you,” Harry said with a laugh, leaning over and kissing Draco on the lips deeply, then slowly taking the shirt and putting it on, then taking off his pants to put on the silk ones, bending over to pick it up when it slipped from his hands.
“We’ll be there, Harry,” Ron said when Harry told his two best friends how he was going to go in search for Horcruxes.
“We’re…”
“I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t think you’d be here,” he said, his tone serious and panicked. “Now I’ll have to-”
“It is. An ancient legend, that no one believes to be true. I didn’t believe it myself, either.”
okay so I hate how the order is messed up now; it says chapter 26 is chapter 27 oooooof wow this is great. Hopefully, it doesn't bother you guys
“How narcissistic,” he scoffed, folding his arms. “You want the truth? No, I wouldn’t have. I would have worked until I found a way to break the curse. But you didn’t even give that a chance. You didn’t give
But that’s when he heard something behind him.
“What?”
“Harry, you should step-”
“Because so many mistakes have been made between us. Let’s put aside the fact that we were enemies for six years,” Harry folded his arms, “even while together… you didn't tell me about your Death Eater tasks, I used that… stupid spell on you, you thought I didn’t trust you, and then… then there’s this fucking
“The last time I checked, you weren’t even supposed to know about my Dark Mark.” Draco pointed out. “Besides, there’s nothing else to do. It just keeps on burning.”
“What? Oh, yeah,” he replied. “It’s strange, isn’t it? It’s not like I heard it recently, but… somehow still got stuck in my head.”
He thought about it for a moment. “No. I didn’t. He never said anything to me,” he answered, looking away from her.
“You want to see if this…” he walked closer to Draco, “was worth the risk, right?” Harry tried not to show his trembling hands, chewing on his lip nervously. He didn’t even know what he was saying, nor had he thought it through. But his gut feeling was telling him to go with it.
“You’re unwell?” Harry asked as he reached his bed.
It was time to go.
The wedding had made him feel worse. He had allowed his mind to go to a place he had never thought of before. An image of him and Draco having a wedding of their own popped into his mind. It eased the pain in his heart a little bit, only to be reminded just how impossible that was.
is, that’s more than what you could ever say.” Harry bit his lip, before opening his mouth again. “
He quickly sat up when he heard a knock on his door. Lucius came striding in without waiting for a response. “What are you doing?” he asked. Draco sat up, confused. “Come, sit,” he patted the chair beside him. “I need to talk to you.”
“It’s not you I’m jealous of,” Draco blurted, his face turning red as he stood up. “It’s not her I want to kiss,” he said, turning away from Harry.
As the three made their way to their first class, Potions, Ron and Hermione exchanged glances when they heard Draco call Harry’s name.
“Don’t come back.”
The day had gone by slowly. The party didn’t start until six, and Harry didn’t plan on opening up shop today. He just turned on the TV and watched some shows to distract himself from thoughts of Draco or anything to do with the fact that he had only a month left to make a decision.
Harry accompanied Dumbledore to find the Horcrux. When they returned, Harry was trying his best to find someone to help Dumbledore.
“Ron thinks I’m getting old and getting grey hair,” Harry said with an eye roll. Ron shrugged at that. Hermione turned to look at Ron. She looked so done with his logic.
“No. Certainly not. I promise.”
The two sat in silence for a while. There were two benches side by side, and the two sat on each end of the benches.
There lied on Draco’s desk, a pile of letters stacked together. Meeting after meeting became week after week, which became night after night.
“No no, that’s fine, really.”
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked.
“Who?” Draco asked, looking up at the ceiling.
“I wouldn’t call it stalking. I was just worried about you. You’ve seemed a bit weird lately.” Harry told him. “Uh, you told me you had to study? What are you doing right now?” Harry asked, finally paying attention to the things around Draco.
Draco heard a distant shout of someone cursing right outside the Hospital Wing. He lied back down, shutting his eyes tightly, knowing well that it was Harry.
“Why does everyone assume I have a girlfriend?” Draco asked, looking up at him. “I know I’m hot, but…”
And Harry was back for a sixth year at Hogwarts. Only this time, he was almost sent back to London because of Draco Malfoy.
“Potter,” Draco whispered right in Harry’s ear, making him shudder. The two looked around to see if anyone was in the hallway. Seeing no one, Draco dragged Harry into a nearby broom closet. Draco turned the light on and smiled at Harry.
“Perhaps you're right.”
He couldn’t argue with that. Most of all, he wanted to be with Draco, but he couldn’t. He had ruined it.
The door burst open.
“Well… I never told you why, because I knew you would be careless and try to stay with me anyway.”
After everyone left, Draco quickly slipped and left to his dorm. He couldn’t take it anymore. He grabbed a piece of paper, a quill, and ink.
“Well… this is weird,” Draco said, laughing awkwardly.
So, if you're somehow still here and reading this, do you have any ideas of what I could make the title? 'He was Never the Enemy' was anyways just supposed to be a temporary title, but I never got around to changing it.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Not that I would be complaining, I think there would be a problem if all of them love me as you do,” Draco said, snickering slightly. “Well, I am quite an attractive man, but, I don’t think I’d want all of the Weasley family to lo-”
“Could you not wake up the whole of Hogwarts? Thanks.” Pansy said annoyedly as she approached him. “It’s seven in the morning! What are you so hyped up about?”
Draco stroked his finger gently over the bird charm, then unfolded the note.
“Harry, don’t just-” Draco, who had just exited the Room of Requirement, was stunned when he saw himself standing in front of Harry. He slowly hid behind the wall, peeking his head out to see what was going on.
He simply shook his head and made his way to the Gryffindor table, afraid if they looked at each other a moment too long they would burst into laughter. It was incredibly funny to throw insults at each other when they knew they didn’t mean it.
“Well, he’s looked away now,” she sighed, almost in a disappointed tone. “I thought you wanted to figure out your feelings?”
“There’s barely any space,” he started, but watched as the room suddenly grew significantly larger, more than enough space for them to dance, along with a dance floor. “I’m not sure if that was a requirement.” he groaned as some loud, ballroom dancing music started playing. “Music? really?”
“Listen? You were signing everything. It was hard
“I don’t trust this fucking device.”
“Is that it? Do you like her? Are you jealous that I got to kiss her?” he persisted. “I didn’t think you would like a Ravenclaw, but… I’m not going to fight with you over a girl. God, Draco, why do we always have to fight? Why can’t we just-”
“Alright, alright, I’m sorry,” Pansy said, running after him down the hallway, her heels echoing. “Didn’t mean to hurt your feelings or something.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “However, you aren’t,” Draco said as Harry tripped over his foot for the umpteenth time. “Here, let’s go a little slower.”
Everyone turned to look at what made the sudden noise. Snape rolled his eyes.
odd to see this sexuality thing come up like this. I should’ve realized. So you like someone?”
“Both?” Harry answered, his eyes boring into Draco’s, his face all serious suddenly. “Today marks one month,” he whispered. “I didn’t want to say anything, but… it’s not fair. We made an agreement.”
“Each and every one of the forty-one that you wrote,” Harry answered with a smile. There were tears welling up in Draco’s eyes. Harry pulled him closer. “Listen… if I die tonight-”
“Coming,” he called out, getting off of him. “Okay, it hurts a little now,” he sighed, trying not to smile as he watched a flustered, pink-faced Draco tuck his shirt back in properly. “Draco?”
“Now don’t be silly, dear! Any friend of Harry’s is always welcome,” Molly said with a smile, ushering them inside before Draco could argue.
Draco hit him so hard that the Invisibility Cloak fell off of them.
hope you enjoyed the chap lovelies
“Ah, Mr. Potter, so nice of you to join us,” Snape said in his usual demeaning voice, “Ten minutes late. Twenty points from Gryffindor. And please come, sit over here.” Snape pointed to an empty table right at the front of the class. Harry rolled his eyes and went to sit down. Just as Harry sat down, Draco entered the classroom. Gryffindors had Defence Against the Dark Arts with the Slytherins this year.
“Harry’s looking,” she mumbled under her breath. It wasn’t as if anyone could hear her - Blaise was being the loudest at the table, acting as if he had won the fight between Draco, and as if it somehow determined his worth.
He nodded. “You two look good too. Like a proper married couple,” He smiled, picking up Luna’s gift that was on the center table. “I figured I should probably come today. I haven’t seen everyone in a while.”
“Wh-what are you on about?” Harry asked, confused, frowning as he stared at Draco, who was glaring at him.
“Proof? Who needs proof! It’s clearly true!” Pansy said with a laugh, standing up and resting her elbow on Luna’s shoulder, clearly amused by Hermione’s outrage and her need to tell everyone the right facts.
Harry pulled Draco into a hug. Draco hugged him right back as if he had been aching to hug Harry all this while.
***EDIT: I CHANGED HARRY’S ANSWER PLEASE REREAD THE “SHOP” SCENE IF YOU READ IT BEFORE! I decided things were moving too fast so they’re gonna take some time***
“Finally you’ve visited,” A voice said, making Harry jump. He turned and saw Pansy standing by the bed. “He’s been awake all day, restless. Every time someone entered he begged for me to open the curtains to see who it was.”
“Everyone kept leaving the dinner table, so I came to see what the fuss was about. You just got here!”
“Harry, how could you even think that?”
Raising an eyebrow, Draco opened the letter that said the following:
WHOAAAA I'm back???
Then, without another word, Snape turned and left, leaving Draco confused.
“You don’t suppose he’s still trying to figure out what Malfoy’s up to?”
But, of course, he didn’t.
“No, no! What you said was perfect. Just… ‘boyfriend’... I didn’t know we could call each other that.”
“Like you actually care,” he set down his hearing aids, keeping his eyes on Draco’s lips.
The blond felt a pain in his chest, but nodded. “...If you think that would be more effi-”
“...well then fine, I don’t care if your stupid arm hurts or not.” Draco huffed, turning to look away from him.
Harry looked up at her. “This might be a huge waste of money…” he said, carefully opening it and taking out the hearing aids, hand trembling slightly.
Draco was confused as he read it. He turned and saw that there was a Gryffindor Quidditch jumper, and a sweater with H written on it.
Draco had Apparated from the Grimmauld Place to the first person he could think of. He looked around the dark room, eventually spotting Pansy who was in bed. She jumped awake at the sound of Draco Apparating, narrowing her eyes.
“You’ve not done anything to prove I can,” Harry retorted.
Pansy gave Draco a look, one that said, ‘Aren’t you going to go check on Harry?’. Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head, but slowly stood up and walked down the hallway to where the dorms were.
“Hey, guys, do you hear that buzzing?” Luna asked in her casual dreamy voice, smiling slightly. “I think it could be the Nargles.”
“You’re wonderful,” Draco whispered. “And I don’t know why, but the thought of you with someone else feels awful.”
“It’s time to bring the factors… and our mistakes… back in,” he whispered in his ear quietly, then took a few steps back, turning to leave. “And yeah. I seriously hate your hair when it’s gelled back."
He shrugged. “I’ll have to see.”
Neither of them knew how they ended up that way, but they sank down to the floor, Draco still crying, and Harry hugging him, never letting go once.
*********
“Bullshit,” he replied, and despite the harsh word, his tone was ever so gentle, concerned. He took Draco’s hand, who held onto it tightly, unable to meet his eyes. He felt as if Harry had seen a stupid, embarrassing side of him.
“I don’t open for another two hours,” Harry stated, looking at his watch that read 7 A.M. “What brings you guys here?”
“Yeah, we wouldn’t have to if you didn’t declare me your sworn enemy in first year,” Harry rolled his eyes, but he was blushing. “Come on, then,” he said, leaning forward, his lips mashing against Draco’s, as if the kiss from a moment ago wasn’t enough. He felt Draco smile into the kiss, both pulling away to catch their breaths.
They eventually made it to their first class of the day, which was Potions. Harry and Ron sat beside each other while Hermione sat beside someone else. She always said those two were too distracting to be around during Potions, so it wasn’t a surprise.
After a few minutes, Draco stood up to move to the couch, deciding he would wait till Harry woke up. Harry grabbed a hold of his arm, his eyes fluttering.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Your Highness.”
“I think your father’s magic might be obsolete.”
Draco frowned, lowering his hand with the ring. “I understand if you say no.”
There was silence, then shook his head. “This isn’t something you should meddle with.”
What he felt for Harry was unlike anything before, which was probably why it frightened him even more. He didn’t want the first person he actually liked to be in danger all because of him and his family. He knew his upcoming responsibilities and didn’t want to hurt Harry. But… what if Pansy was right? What if he would be missing out on something great? What if he didn’t
“Please,” Harry pleaded.
“Good morning. I was waiting for you at breakfast,” Narcissa said softly. “When did you wake up?”
“Yeah, um… I’m not sure what there is to say. And I certainly don’t want to talk to Hermione about this. It seems most of it goes to Pansy when it’s supposed to stay between us.”
Draco shook his head in disbelief, looking down at the sun, a smile on his face. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it, Harry?” he asked, nudging him gently. Harry, who had been staring at Draco’s face, reached forward and gently cupped his face.
“Come on, I need more than that. What happened?” Pansy asked, patting the bed, indicating for him to sit down. Draco rolled his eyes but sat down anyways.
“I should probably get back. You go in a few minutes to not raise suspicion,” Harry stated, standing up and moving towards the door, then turned around suddenly, his hand gripping on the handle of the door, opening his mouth to speak. Draco stared at him, practically urging him to give whatever just happened some sort of closure.
“Oh, Hermione, just because you don’t believe in something doesn’t mean it isn’t real,” Luna replied, practically beaming. “Believing or not believing, they will still be real.”
“Is that really how I’m supposed to spend the rest of my fucking life?” Harry snapped, stopping. “Asking my friends how to pronounce spells?”
They both gaped at Harry in horror. “So-” Hermione spoke.
Draco ran a hand through his blond hair. “Move, will you? I’m trying to get inside.” He told Harry, before pushing him into the closet and fully shutting the door.
“...nothing,” he shook his head, picking up the cup and taking a sip. “You know, um… I really liked the poem you sent me on Saturday.”
Snape watched as Harry did so.
“You know,” he said, standing up, “we’re practically on opposite sides of a war.”
“How would you know?” Draco asked. “Y-you don’t know what I’m capable of. You don’t know what I’ve done…”
“I’m fine,” Harry took a big sip of water before standing up, “I’m going to go, bye!”
“It’s okay if you’re nervous. I know a few boys in Slytherin who would be interested, you know. Do you want me to hook you up?”
He gulped, adjusting his glasses. “I’m not sure, Draco. I know this isn’t what you want to hear because your wedding with… her… is soon, but--”
Harry breathed in slowly, trying to understand her perspective. He had to be patient. “I know. I know it’s selfish of me, and I know it’s a huge risk, but…” he stared down at the watch on his wrist. “It’s killing me a little bit. Not being with him.”
“Did you sleep last night?” Hermione asked after rolling her eyes at him.
“Draco!” Narcissa Malfoy smiled as she noticed the two enter, pulling Draco into a tight hug. Anyone could tell how desperately she seemed to hug her son. Harry found it sweet. Narcissa turned to Harry, her smile widening. “Oh, Harry, I’ve been waiting so long to see you.”
Harry stayed silent for a moment. “I was under the impression it was making you feel good here,” he said, putting his hand over Draco’s crotch, who gasped slightly. The two stared at each other for a moment too long. Harry’s lips twitched in amusement. “Am I wrong?"
“Harry, rule five, remember? We made a deal. I can’t talk about it.”
“Ah, fuck,” he nodded, putting a hand to his head. “Alright. By the way, did you hear anything about Harry coming back to England?”
“Really committing to this act, aren’t you?” he said, folding his arms as he took a step forward towards the two. “You always need the attention to be on you, don’t you? First it was Cedric’s death… and now these stupid lies you’re spreading around. You could at least try to have a year where the spotlight isn’t on you.”
Harry looked up at him for a long moment. “What does it mean when someone tells you they dislike you, but like spending time with you?” he asked suddenly, squinting down at the piece of paper.
“I haven’t kissed anyone in over a year now,” Draco cut him off. “We’re fine.”
“But you two are soulmates,” she gulped. “This sort of thing doesn’t happen to just anyone. Don’t you think you should fight for it?”
It was a rule of theirs to not speak of Voldemort, but it wasn’t so easy. Not when Draco was working for him, and when Harry was the center of it all. Harry put a hand to his temple. “I don’t know. It’s all really frustrating. You know, Katie Bell was cursed…”
She chewed on her lip, then nodded. “Yeah, I’ll get it out for you. Just go get ready.”
She sat down on the floor, stretching her back. “I thought he said you were worth the risk for everything.”
Ron was surprised at the change of subject, but it was the first time they had spoken about something other than school in a while, so he rolled with it. “Er… I would think they’re trying to convince themselves they don’t like me, but failing.”
When they reached, he carefully let Harry off the broom, then took off his blindfold. “Whoa,” he breathed, looking over to Draco, still holding onto his hand. “Draco!” he stepped forward on the cliff, looking out at the golden sky. The sun was rising. “Now I’m not mad that you made me wake up so early!”
Draco watched him, frowning, then took a careful step forward, placing his hand on his shoulder. “Do you need to… um… talk about it?” he signed sloppily after walking into Harry’s line of vision.
“I thought you didn’t want this.”
“But you don’t know the password to-”
“Well, I’ll go. Pansy’s probably looking for me.”
Harry smiled and left to go to the Slytherin Common Room (well in front of it).
“I just don’t think you should be making fun of him for being deaf,” he said quietly, taking a sip from his drink. Pansy, beside him, chewed on her lip uncomfortably. Even she didn’t know what to say.
So after a few secret letters to each other back and forth, they soon decided that their meeting day would be Saturday.
“Know what, exactly?” An icy, stony voice spoke from behind all three of them. Harry noticed that Narcissa’s smile faded, only to be quickly replaced with a different sort of smile as she turned to face her husband. Harry awkwardly cleared his throat as Draco finally spoke up.
Draco slowly sat up. He had no appetite, nor did he want to leave his room. He looked over at his bedside table, surprised to see a book out and open, left on the table. Draco didn’t remember doing such a thing. He slowly reached out and took a hold of the book, closing the book to see the title.
Harry jumped at the chance to catch Draco’s eye from across the hallway, but all he got in return was blank, silver eyes looking right through him. Harry would try sitting right across from Draco at the Eighth Year table, but couldn’t get through to him.
“But it felt like something changed, and something did. It was my father. He started forcing Mother to see his perspective, forced her to join the Death Eaters… after that, Mother had changed. Father had always been cold, but now she was too. I felt disconnected from her. After joining Hogwarts, I felt a little better. I had Slytherin friends, I had a cute enemy, I was busy with studies. Forgetting home was easy. That’s how it was till the fifth year.
“Draco,” Narcissa sighed, sitting at the foot of his bed. “Astoria’s gone for the cake tasting without you, love.”
“Merlin, just forget it. I’m leaving,” he announced, turning to the door, but she quickly stood in front of the door. “Move out of the way, Pansy. I don’t even want to look at you right now.”
“Give me Harry Potter, and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.
“You don’t need to answer,” he said. “You’re not really obligated to admit anything, especially to me.”
Harry helplessly looked over to Hermione, who winced, then translated what he was saying in sign language. He rolled his eyes, turning to look at the white-haired teenager in front of him, trying to ignore the small crowd that had formed.
love,
He bit at his thumb nervously, then nodded. “I suppose you’re right. Thanks.”
When Harry woke on Wednesday morning, the white in his hair had increased instead of washing out.
Harry knew he should have pushed her off. That he should have told her he was in love with someone else. That he didn’t like girls. That he didn’t like her.
“Harry-”
Draco grinned, undoing the button of Harry’s jeans. “Merlin, yes.”
Harry slowly sat up and turned to face the window, slowly standing up.
Right. Their distant coffee date.
to be.
The rest of the lesson went by smoothly - or whatever was considered smoothly for Draco and Harry.
********
“Well, I thought that was a given,” Draco said, slowly taking a step back. He could sense what was about to happen, and he dreaded as the moment was slowly coming.
On the night of Christmas day, he picked up his quill, dipping it in ink and starting to write a letter.
“You would never listen to me if I told you to stop dating Potter, right?” Lucius asked, raising an eyebrow.
“My bad, it was a moment of weakness,” Draco replied, biting his lip as he smiled at Harry.
But before Harry or Draco could register it, Hermione swung the door open and saw the two making out on Harry’s bed.
uhh I don't know how to feel about this chapter.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” The blond broke out. “You know I can help you, right?”
“Draco!” he grinned. “You’re here! How did you get in?”
Sorry for the inconsistent posting but I want to write when I feel that I am able to produce the best quality, not just rush to write whatever so I can keep view numbers up. I want the best quality for this fic because I truly love it so much. I hope you guys can understand. Some days I just don't feel the writing is going to be the best I can do, so I take breaks. However, I'll try my best to be consistent.
“I know the last five years have been terrible. I never intended for us to-”
“I’m fine, really. Madam Pomfrey just wants me to stay here overnight because my nose is still quite sore and bleeds every now and then.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry took out his hearing aids quickly. “Goodnight, Draco,” he mumbled, kissing Draco’s cheek gently, pulling his hand away. He picked up his stuff and quickly left, leaving Draco alone in the room with the sudden tension, the deafening silence, and his own thoughts.
New story!! Woo! Hope you guys like this one as much as I do!
Harry gave Arthur a rubber duck, Molly a necklace, Charlie a book about dragons, Bill a book about Herbology (Harry really just took a long shot there) and George a book about jokes.
“Sorry for being late,” he sat as he finally sat down beside Draco, not even glancing over to him.
Harry looked up, his eyes reaching Draco’s, who was already staring at him. But his stare wasn’t nerve-wrecking, unlike Cedric’s, unlike Cho’s.
Harry nodded, turning to look at her. “Thank you, Professor.”
“Well, yes, but… but it wasn’t… I thought he would… I didn’t…” Harry, at an utter loss for words, slowly walked into the hallway, where Draco had just been moments ago, lightly knocking on the door. “Draco?”
“Good morning, ‘Mione,” Ron muttered as he sat down. “And Harry, it is
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco asked, seeming taken aback. Standing up, he took Harry’s hands and guided them to the couch. As they sat down, he stared down. “I’m sorry for not checking up on-”
“My father, he… he didn’t want us to be together, so… he placed a curse on me. On the both of us, actually. If we’re too close to each other, you will get severely injured.”
? My bad, let me just leave you to thinking those thoughts to just yourself, then,” Harry suddenly snapped. There had been a good moment of silence before Harry had spoken up.
“...that I wonder whether your heart has really been in it…” Dumbledore finished.
Draco’s eyebrows creased as he tried to recall or remember the term, then shrugged. “No idea. Maybe I’ve heard my family use the term a few times. Why? Aren’t you working with Dumbledore to try and stop You-Know-Who?” he asked.
can’t keep secrets,” Draco said, folding his arms and smirking with amusement.
“Harry,” Pansy called out, then shook her head at her stupidity, quickly tapping him on the shoulder. He turned around, and for some reason, he had been hoping it was Draco. He frowned when he looked at her. “Do you have a minute?”
“What, do you need me to write you a poem to help you believe me?” he asked, and Draco snorted. “Ahem.
“He was such a good person,” Harry moved closer and leaned on Draco’s shoulder. “I miss him.”
“We’re here if you need anything,” Ron said.
He blinked in surprise, meeting Harry’s eyes. “What, you think I did this? I didn’t even know what you were up to!”
i hope dearly you guys like this chapter!
The two stayed quiet, letting themselves relax, until Harry finally spoke up. “I wish I could hear the music,” he remarked. Draco turned his head to face him, and so did the other. The two were taken aback by how close their faces were, but neither made an attempt to move.
“I fucked up, I fucked up,” he said, pacing a few more times before stopping in front of her. “I feel sick. I’m going Madame Pomfrey. I’ll probably be off for the rest of the week.”
I don't like the title of this fan-fiction. I'm considering changing it, but I suck at making titles.
Hermione nodded slowly. “Why is it so hard to believe you have feelings for this girl?”
“Please leave me alone,” he stated.
Though Harry was excited to be able to listen in lessons again, he wondered what that meant for the lessons between him and Draco. Well, Harry was still a little behind than everyone else, and Draco still wanted to learn more sign language, but was pretty much at Harry’s level now, which was surprising.
Draco stared at the note, finding himself smiling, putting it away before Pansy could question what it said.
“Wait, someone was trying to get you to fall in love with them?” Draco asked, getting annoyed. “Who?”
“We should get going,” Draco said, slowly getting up.
“I’m… going to… study somewhere else.” Harry said slowly. Lately, he hadn’t even been able to speak properly - he did everything in slow motion. Harry slowly picked up his textbook and walked down the Great Hall.
“I could be bisexual,” Draco said, but both of them knew it wasn’t true. “I don’t want to be with you anymore. If you truly loved me, you would respect that. Now, please respect my wishes.”
“Hey, so, it’s our anniversary tomorrow,” Harry tried.
“It’s not about that,” he shook his head. “The Dark Lord is back, as you know. It’s just… complicated with my family right now. Apparently, we need to prepare for his return…”
“Potter, this sounds weird, but you need to center yourself, especially for someone who’s doubting their magical abilities.”
“Harry,” Draco said firmly, looking at him.
“Uh… yes?”
“You’re so stupid,” he muttered, but he stepped forward.
“Aren’t you worried about what Malfoy might do?” Hermione frowned as they sat down in the Hall for lunch. “He’s been surprisingly quiet since your… dispute last week.”
Draco slowly stopped writing, folding the paper and putting it to the side. “What about?” He asked in a tone that made it seem like he cared when in reality he didn’t.
“I said we should mess with Potter again. We can do it more discreetly if you’re worried about getting into trouble,” he said. “What do you say?”
Draco rolled his eyes, but found himself smiling, reaching for the quill as he wrote back. Harry’s letters were the highlight of his day. There wasn’t much going on in Malfoy Manor, but the whole atmosphere had changed as soon as he had got back. The place had always been cold, lonely and isolated, but it was somehow worse this time.
“You! And Malfoy! Malfoy! And you! Harry Potter, and Draco Malfoy! My best friend, and Draco Malfoy! My enemy, and my best friend!”
“I can tell. It’s a bit creepy, actually,” she commented, then flopped down beside him. “Tell me everything.”
“Oh, yes! Draco got them for me,” he smiled as she walked towards him. He took one of them out and handed them to her. “It works great. I just wish I didn’t have to endure that whole year of suffering.”
He stood up quickly, almost tripping but regaining his balance. He picked up his bag, ripping out a piece of paper from his notebook and taking out his quill, dipping it in ink and starting to write.
Changing into something more suitable for a party, he jumped when Hermione and Ron Apparate into the living room. They’ve been busy, so they didn’t have time to meet up with him and see how things had gone with Draco.
“Leave it,” he pushed Draco off of him. Slipping on his shoes, he stood up, turning to leave. Draco scrambled out of the bed, blocking his way quickly. “Draco, stop it.”
“Well this
“Not even the slightest?” Snape questioned.
Draco entered the Room of Requirement, his gaze softening when he noticed a bed in their room, Harry practically passed out on it. He slowly made his way to the bed, but frowned when he noticed Harry’s sweaty forehead and the frown on his face. Chewing on his lip, he gently reached forward and caressed Harry’s cheek.
She glanced up at him, then sighed in defeat, still glaring. Pulling a note out of her pocket, she handed it to Harry. “Pansy gave it to me amidst the chaos. Said it’s for you.”
“What? Oh, sorry. You were saying?”
Draco took in a deep breath. “Right.”
“D-Draco, stop,” Harry whispered softly. “Draco, I said stop!” Harry suddenly bellowed, pushing the other off of him, unable to calm his breathing. “Just… just leave me alone!”
“Draco,” he heard Pansy’s voice just out the bathroom door, sounding worried. “Are you alright?”
WOW okay I love this chapter so much!!
“Just to a friend. The…  Greengrass’s,” Narcissa said. “You can use my owl.”
“Well, whatever Pansy said makes sense. You had time to try it out. Why’s the distrust coming up now?” Hermione asked. “Not that I blame you. Malfoy’s not exactly trustworthy.”
“Why here?” Draco asked as he watched Harry pace around one section of the wall a few times. He took a small step back as he saw a door emerge on the wall, confused. “Um… what’s this now?”
stupid. So, I want to thank you.” Harry went on. “Thank you for everything.”
“Lover-” he started, outraged, looking up to see Hermione, Harry, Ron and Ginny all going to sit at the Gryffindor table. He wrinkled his nose in disgust, looking back to Pansy beside him. “He can’t trust me.”
“Your father and I have decided that you won’t be returning to Hogwarts for the seventh year,” said Narcissa Malfoy, shutting the door behind her, staying by the door.
Harry stretched his back and took off his hearing aids then got into bed with Draco, who slung an arm over him. And, honestly, while he knew this year wasn’t going to go well at all, it was still nice to forget about that when he was in Draco’s arms, feeling his soft breath on his shoulder as he fell asleep. He could pretend that they weren’t on opposites of a war, and better - he could pretend, in the proximity of this room, that he wasn’t Harry Potter, with the weight of the Wizarding World on his shoulders, but just Harry Potter, a stupid boy in love with another boy.
“No,” Draco replied. “I’m pretty tired too.”
“Right. Are you sure Cho didn’t see you again?” Ron asked as they walked past the Slytherin compartment. Both him and Hermione snickered. “You know, maybe for a round two…”
“Can’t do much hearing, but go ahead,” Harry said, pushing his hand off and folding his arms. “You have thirty seconds.”
“You don’t need to worry about that. It’s not your place.”
“Uno,” Draco smirked as he set down his second-last card. “I’m
“You disgust me, Pansy,” he said monotonously, having already picked up his things and was walking to his dorm. The few Slytherins that were left in the common room turned to her, bewildered and confused. After picking up a few things from his dorm, he left about twenty minutes later, back to the Room of Requirement, though this time, he was asking for a different room.
“I’m trying to capture this moment so it can stay in my mind forever.”
“Harry-”
“Is he alright?” Harry asked, unsure of how to feel as Pansy ran after him. Seeing Draco certainly wasn’t easy, but he was trying his best to make it work for Ron and Hermione. It was nice to see familiar faces again, but his chest ached.
Meanwhile, in another carriage, Pansy Parkinson sat down, almost regretting doing so because she knew she had walked in on one of Draco’s rants - but not just any rant. It was the twinkle in his eyes that appeared whenever he talked about Harry.
“What are you sorry for?” Harry asked. “Crying?”
Though it
Pansy frowned. “I mean, I just walked past their carriage. Ron and Hermione were signing to him, so…”
“Lemonade?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at her, looking down at the glass. “You didn’t strike me as the type.”
Blaise and Pansy exchanged glances as he left the common room, his bag slung around his shoulder.
“What?” Draco asked, frowning.
“I… yes, I have a date, but I’m not in a relationship with hi...her. It’s our first date.”
“Sorry,” Harry said. “Okay, at least we know to be careful now. I really don’t want to break up with you.” Harry snuggled up against Draco, closing his eyes and feeling his warmth.
“Oh, Arthur, look what you did to the poor boy! He’s all shaken up. Don’t worry, Draco. You’re welcome here any time. Harry seems to be so fond of you. If he cares about you, so do we.” Molly said, giving him a reassuring smile.
“If Harry Potter comes too close to you, he will suffer... some serious consequences, let’s put it that way,” Lucius Malfoy explained.
“Thank you for keeping track,” Draco replied. “Anyway…”
People were starting to show up in the hallways. So, before Draco could retort back, they were forced to throw on Harry’s Invisibility Cloak.
“So it wasn’t a stupid Muggle game when you were winning in Monopoly?” Harry questioned, standing up and making his way to Draco, kissing his neck softly, who moved further into Harry’s arms, letting himself get distracted for a moment.
“Yeah, what about it?” Harry asked. “Why? Come on babe, if you told me you were coming in advance, we could’ve showered together.” He teased.
“Well, I didn’t want you to hold it the whole time since it’s heavy.”
As he sat down at a table, watching Hermione dance with Ron for a while. Moping around a little, he made small talk with Luna who had momentarily paused her unique dancing to check in with him. Afterwards, Hermione sat down beside Harry, sighing.
“Are you going back?” Draco asked, not realizing how hopeful he sounded.
“Okay, one,” he sat upright, “you were being a dickhead! Who in their right mind would be friends with someone who’s insulting their friend? Two, not accepting your handshake didn’t mean we had to be
After dinner, Harry went to his dorm and changed out of his uniform, then grabbed his things and left for the Room of Requirement. They had spent the last lesson on Friday quietly. Surprisingly, Draco had recognized Harry needed his space, and rather than a lesson, they had more of a study session. Except the kind where they kept stealing glances at each other while trying to study.
He quickly shut up Harry by capturing his lips in a kiss, who shut his eyes and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, who pushed him down on the ground, kissing his neck. Harry arched his back, leaning his head back, smiling. Draco had told him what he was hoping for, and now, he could melt into his touch without having the lingering feeling at the back of his head, telling him that Draco would leave him soon.
The brunet didn’t look up, so Draco walked towards him and stood beside him. Harry looked up finally, looking surprised. He fumbled around for his case before he put his hearing aids back on. “Sorry, I didn’t want to be distracted by any noise, so… what are you doing here?”
“I’d break your broomstick.”
He was the first thought in the morning. He was the first to make Draco feel worth something. The first to help him understand that being a Malfoy didn’t make his entire identity. His first love. His first everything.
The next evening, Harry hung back after their last class was over, hoping to catch Draco. He didn’t want this to go on longer than it should, and decided it was best to talk to him. After all, he couldn’t help but feel guilty.
He would bump into his father every so often. Lucius would nod at him while Draco gave him a cold look. There was nothing he wanted to say to him.
“I don’t really like change.”
Harry looked down at the note, recognizing the stamp at once. “Oh. This is a letter from-”
It was five a.m. on a Saturday, the middle of March. A month had passed and things for Harry had been growing tense, but he barely said any of it to Draco. This was mainly because he didn’t want him to worry, but also the fact that Draco was really the only distraction he had from all of it.
“I’ve been sleeping better,” he answered, taking a sip of the tea. Harry didn’t question why he wanted to change the subject. “Like you said, they obviously wouldn’t be able to get rid of the nightmares, but… at least I get a few hours in.”
“Can’t we both just accept you were an asshole and move on?”
“You knew about the Room of Requirement,” he folded his arms. “It wouldn’t have been hard to deduce I was using it for other things too.”
The door swung open, and there stood Harry, taking a few steps back from the two that were standing right in front of the door. “Just… come inside,” he said. “Ron, go downstairs.”
“They’ll hate me,” Harry muttered. “They already hate me. I’m not worthy of your family, Draco. I’m not a pureblood, and I don’t know basic etiquettes… they’re going to hate me, more than they already do.”
Draco shut the book and put it back on the bedside table, turning and walking over to the door to exit. He had to tell Harry.
“It’d be strange if she did,” he said, then smiled at her gratefully, putting a delicate hand to his gelled hair. “Thanks again about being so cool with this, Astoria. Seriously. I’m surprised you’re taking all of this so well.”
“Draco, honey, don’t you think it’s unnecessary to invite the Weasleys?” Astoria questioned, staring down at her large diamond ring. “Babe.”
“Harry, I have my own bank account, if you haven’t realized. I’ll pay you back for it, alright? Besides, they don’t care.”
“Do you ever feel like you’re being forced to do something?”
Draco Malfoy sat at his desk, staring down at his watch. He had sent a few taps in the past few days, but never got any in response. Maybe Harry had taken it off and kept it somewhere. That was the only logical explanation.
“Mate, what the bloody hell are you doing?!” screamed Ron, who received a strong, harsh kick from Hermione who was right beside him.
Draco chuckled. “I fucking hate you,” he whispered, pushing Harry down on the couch. The two smacked each other repeatedly, both squirming and giggling like little kids until Harry rested his head on Draco’s chest. “You’re lucky it’s in the best way possible.”
“Maybe I ought to make you drink a Wit-Sharpening potion,” Draco scoffed, then clicked his tongue. “Ah, wait. There wouldn’t be anything to sharpen.”
“Harry, you’re doing it again.”
The door opened and Hermione entered. She looked around the room. Pansy kicked the wall behind her to show her she was in the room. Hermione quickly nodded before shutting the door behind her.
“Will you Gryffindorks stop being so loud?” Someone called from the Slytherin table. Harry turned to see Draco who had just arrived, glaring at them. However, his glare softened when Harry turned to look at him.
Harry quickly scribbled out a reply. Then he put the note on Draco’s notebook, gently so Snape wouldn’t see.
“Why does it have to?”
There were loud footsteps down the hallway, and Harry found himself turning and staring at the door, almost waiting for whoever it was to open the door. Harry was curious as to who it was.
“I’m not in love!” Draco hissed, to which Pansy just shrugged at.
“Out with it, then,” Harry snapped.
“If you couldn’t trust me,” Draco whispered, trying to keep his voice steady, “why did you lie to me?”
Draco carefully finished off his poem, waiting for the ink to dry before folding it up. “Send this to Potter,” he whispered to Pansy, who handed it to the girl beside her. Eventually, it made its way around the class and to Ron, who tapped Harry on the shoulder, handing it to him under the table.

“What makes you say that?” Pansy asked. Harry’s back was to Draco, so he didn’t notice that Draco slowly opened his eyes and shut them again, pretending to be asleep.
Begrudgingly, Lucius picked up the quill and signed his name on the contract that now legally bound him to undo the curse - and if he didn’t, Draco would take it to court and have him taken to prison.
“Like I said, Dumbledore already knew. If he wanted to, he would’ve done something about it,” he shook his head, then stood up. “And yes. It is what I’m worried about, because I love him. Would you please respect that?”
“No, Draco, I need to make sure I know everything if I’m going to have to fight Voldemort,” he sighed, sitting up in his seat. “I just wish this… wouldn’t have to be me sometimes. And I just wish you wouldn’t have to be on their side.”
Draco looked into his sparkling green eyes. No one’s eyes shined this way. Only Harry could make Draco feel this way.
“I’ve watched you talk about Harry for the past six years. And although everyone thought you just hated him, I knew better. I’ve known you for a long time. The only time there’s a glint in your eyes is when you’re thinking, talking or around Harry.”
“You’re no help!”
They had returned at Hogsmeade. Madam Rosmerta came rushing up to them.
“Harry, so sorry to bother you on the second day back, but it seems as if my shoes have gone missing again.” Luna Lovegood said in her usual dreamy voice, smiling softly at Harry. “I am truly sorry for asking you of this, but could you help me look for them?”
Staggering, he made his way down the hallway, insisting that Molly leave at the entrance, telling her he was fine.
“You’re rambling,” Hermione stated with a sigh. “Tell you what, let’s stay till dark. If he doesn’t come by then, let’s just assume he spent the night at his home - his parents probably want him to, you know… We’ll go back to The Burrow if he doesn’t come home tonight, and we can come back tomorrow to check if he’s there.” Harry smiled slightly - Hermione was being rational; she was probably correct, anyways. Harry was probably just being dramatic.
“Well, do you like Granger?”
“Could you tell Draco to go to the tent? You know, when he’s out of here. I won’t be there, I just… I left a few things there for him.”
Oh, how he hated Draco Malfoy.
“It’s good to see you,” she said quietly. She pulled away, but held him at arm's length. “Did your father… undo the curse?” she asked in a low voice.
“You two, work together. For the sake of my sanity, be civilized with each other,” he snapped, then quickly walked away. Harry, annoyed, readjusted his robes and set down the Potions textbook in his hands.
“Too tight!” Draco yelped when Harry fixed up his tie.
to pay attention, you know,” he scoffed. “Do you like her?”
“How are you?” Harry asked, his words slightly slurred. It seemed as if Harry lost his stubbornness and was finally talking to Draco - well, it was more that Harry was too drunk to recognize Draco, and thought that the white-haired male beside him was someone else.
“Yeah, I think you ruined whatever was left of my eardrums,” he said, standing up, putting his hands to his ears, then turning around to look at them again. “This is ridiculous. I thought you guys believed me.”
Harry took the books from Hermione and practically ran off to his next class. Harry had managed to calm himself, not flinching whenever he saw Draco (or in Harry’s situation, his eyes tricking him into thinking it was Draco).
“That’s exactly it,” Draco pointed his wand at Harry’s neck. “I’m teaching you to have the upper hand even without being able to hear. So, here’s what we’re going to do. You need to get ten times better at lip reading, and memorize hand movements. Alright?”
Harry frowned. “What do you mean?”
“Both of you?” Molly asked, blinking in surprise.
Draco took off before the bell could even ring, signaling the end of class. He was highly aware of Harry eyeing him during the whole of the lesson. Harry was trying to see if he was behaving strangely. He knew something was up with Draco.
“Anything,” she said.
Draco sat in the living room now, coming back to reality. Astoria was just beside him, holding onto his arm. As soon as Hermione entered the room, Draco stood up, nudging Astoria’s hands away. “How is he?”
“You’re a dickhead, you know,” he said before he could stop himself, earning a questioning glance from Pansy.
“You’re ridiculous, you know that?” he laughed. “And stop making fun of me! I spend time on those poems!”

In the Room of Requirement, Harry had finally found the diadem.
know me,” Harry bellowed, tears spilling down his cheeks. “Not anymore.”
“I love your honesty."
"Undo it. Take back the curse," Draco was saying, even though he knew it was no use.

“What are you doing?”
Draco’s eyes widened, feeling more nervous - but hey, at least he hadn’t flat out said no. “Okay. Take as long as you need. My wedding’s in March, so um...”
been aching to hug Harry all this while.
“Hey,” Pansy folded her arms, “I just wanted her birthday to be special!”
“Yes, probably. Draco said he wants to continue helping me with my skills, so… I think that’s good.”
Draco didn’t say anything.
“Harry…”
“I don’t know what I want,” Harry’s voice was low, heart beating faster than he could ever imagine. “I don’t know if I…”
Since the number of students for the Eighth Year was actually quite small, it was two people per room. Pansy and Hermione decided to share a room - they had surprisingly become friends.
That evening, Harry and Draco hurried to dinner after sneaking out of the room of requirement. Hermione eyed her best friend suspiciously as he sat down beside her, humming out of tune as he served himself.
“He wanted to know what my nightmares have been about. I was too embarrassed to tell him. Not only that, I don’t want it to be used against me some way. What if You Know Who finds out my deepest fear and makes it come true? I know he might find out either way because he’s been into my mind, but…” Harry trailed off into silence, frowning. “I just…”
“Dodger, no,” Draco said slowly. He was still for a few seconds, and so was Dodger, before he ran towards the window to close it. But Dodger was too fast.
Meanwhile, Harry was already eating, today actually making an effort to listen to Ron and Hermione’s conversation. He had another nightmare and wasn’t able to sleep much, but still, knowing that today was Saturday eased him, since he could see Draco again. He looked over to the Slytherin table, raising an eyebrow when he noticed he was reading a letter.
His eyes moved down to his lap, thinking of how Cedric’s stare used to make him feel nervous. He had been too afraid to confront his feelings. It was strange, right? To feel like this about another person, let alone someone who was also a male. He was able to push it away before. It wasn’t a big deal - Cedric was warm, caring, and kind, it was only understandable. He was a role model, a fun person to be around. It was only an infatuation, barely anything real.
“Fine- what?”
“Hey,” Ron sat as he flopped down across from him. Harry was seated by the window. “We’re going to Hogsmeade if you want to join.”
He gulped when he noticed Draco’s serious expression. “Brilliant,” he blurted. “That’s just… brilliant,” he breathed when he felt Draco’s hands under his shirt. He felt Draco’s lips all over his neck, his face, and eventually his stomach, feeling the cold air against his skin.
They weren’t prepared for what was going to happen the next day.
The Sorting Ceremony was done and everyone finished the feast, and Dumbledore said a few words before everyone headed to their dorms. Harry went up to his dorm, tired and annoyed with Malfoy. He knew he had to be up to something, but despite his tries to talk about it to Ron, no one seemed to listen to him nor believe him.
Draco ripped out a piece of paper, scribbling something before slipping it under Harry’s door. Then he turned and went into his dorm, going into the shower to wash his feelings away, which, if he was being honest, didn’t work.
“Besides, I don’t think you’d be able to handle being alone,” Hermione said quietly so that only Harry heard her. He snapped his head in her direction. Ron and Ginny fell into a conversation about Bill and Fleur’s wedding.
He looked down at his hands. “Oh. Thank you. Pansy insisted on putting it on me. And you know, once she sets her mind on something, it’s hard to tell her to stop. Especially when it’s to embarrass me.”
“And, by both of you, you mean…” Draco slowly shut his book and turned to look at his mother.
“Really?” he asked. Harry watched as the blond loosened his tie and adjusted his trousers, lying down on the floor beside him. “Hmm… that’s quite relaxing, actually.”
“Oh, yes, you did. I had the hardest time trying to figure it out - but I knew once I noticed you were writing letters, all I had to do was read to who it was - so I did. Didn’t come much of a shock to me, I always presumed you had a thing for him. Every summer, it was always ‘Potter this, Potter that, Potter did this, oh did you know Potter did this’, I thought I’d never hear the end of it. But when you came back after sixth year, I did get quite suspicious.” Narcissa explained, “So, I dug a little deeper and… I just knew after a while.”
It was quiet for a moment, and Harry looked down at his hands as he played with them, trying not to give away how shitty he felt. “Did you like me at all?” he mumbled, standing up. He had to leave. It was bad enough that he was practically being rejected. He didn’t want Draco to see him cry, too.
“Pansy! How did you even get in?” Draco asked as he threw on his school shirt, turning away from her and buttoning it up.
Draco sat down across from Harry in the room of requirement, a small smile on his face. “Are your hearing aids working fine?” he asked as he got out a few textbooks, adjusting his white shirt. It was a bright Saturday morning, and the light from outside was seeping through the windows.
“Oh, God, I didn’t mean it like that. I just mean… it doesn’t really matter what I feel, does it?  I’ve just been a little on edge all year. Waiting for Voldermort’s next step, whatever,” he folded his arms. “Sometimes it makes me regret the deal we made.”
A few days had passed. Harry was seated at his desk in his room. He knew they couldn’t stay at Grimmauld Place for much longer. It would be only a matter of time before a Death Eater that wants to kill them would pay them a visit. It wasn’t a safe place to stay.
. Exhausted.
happen. I don’t want you to be hurt.”
“Don’t worry, this is his way of showing he cares about you. He thinks it’s better to scold you than to actually try and care about you.” Pansy whispered with a smile. Harry laughed.
“Draco, don’t leave. People are going to assume things.”
He jumped when he felt two hands on his shoulder, turning around to see Draco in his room, wearing a sweater and black trousers, a bag slung over his shoulders.
“It’s okay, Ginny,” Molly reassured. “We can make something else.”
Draco stared at Pansy for a few seconds. Then he slowly laughed a bit when Pansy hit his stomach from under the table. Then he slowly looked up at Harry who was still staring at him.
Harry Potter. You’re fucking Harry Potter, and your parents are dead. You will never understand.” Draco had said it before he could stop himself; before he had the time to realize what he was saying was wrong.
Draco had been on his bed, staring up at the ceiling - all he could think of was how Harry. He felt terrible. He had promised Harry he would be at Hogwarts - Draco just wanted to see Harry’s face. He felt as if he was going mad. Draco slowly stood up and walked to the door, hesitantly trying to turn the doorknob - he had been trying every hour since he had been thrown into the room.
“Hmm?” Harry, who had been on top of Draco, moved to sit beside him. “You didn’t have to.”
“Oh, hi.” Harry greeted back, only half paying attention to her.
And so they went to Pansy’s dorm. “Alright, I’ll be asking you many questions to get information, answer as quickly as possible.” She made him sit down on her bed. “Take in a deep breath and-”
“Not with that attitude, I won’t.”
“What are you two arguing about this time?” Hermione asked with a sigh, shutting her book and putting it aside, finishing off her breakfast.
Now that Harry thought about it… he looked around and noticed everyone in Platform 9 and 3/4 staring at him.
“Hermione, if you’re about to tell me that Malfoy isn’t right for me-”
Harry said nothing, looking up at him. His bright green eyes in the sunshine only gleamed more. Draco stayed silent for a moment, reaching into his pocket and taking out a small velvet box, handing it to Harry.

“You’re not really on their side, are you?” Harry asked carefully.
Tears were forming in Ginny’s eyes. “What about that person you were talking about to me? That you didn’t expect to love?” she asked.
“Yeah, just put them back in the case and they’ll recharge.”
“Harry, could you help me with the groceries?” Ron asked as Hermione and Astoria sat down.

“...I need more time to think about this."
“They locked you in the cupboard a lot, didn’t they?” Draco asked slowly.
I also haven't proofread most of this so I'm sorry if there are any mistakes lol
“Friendship? Kindness? Caring? Uh… a Hufflepuff?” Pansy listed, seeming quite pleased with her sense of humor. “Why?”
Harry burst into laughter, unable to contain it anymore. “Draco, it’s Siri. She’s like a robot assistant.”
He stayed silent, unsure of what to say. Why did it matter? When did the thought of Harry with someone else start hurting him? When did the thought of his soft lips on his become a daydream? When did the thoughts of Harry Potter fill his mind?
that I hated you, I just couldn’t, because it’s not true. I don’t hate you. I could never, ever hate you.”
“Yes,” Draco started off in a low voice, “you
Their deal to meet at Pansy’s ran past September. They had never addressed it. Harry would Apparate from wherever he was hiding, exhausted, happy to be with Draco, who’d Apparate from Hogwarts, which was way more relaxed in the sense of Apparating. Also, it didn't quite matter, because he was a Death Eater. He would describe how much Hogwarts had changed, and how much he hated it. Harry would be vague with whatever he was doing, but it was easier to just address things rather than hide behind the rules. Harry was more open about how he was feeling. Sometimes he'd confess how anxious he felt, or that he was missing someone. Other times he'd listen to Draco rant about how frustrating his father was. And to their surprise, it helped. Talking actually helped.
“That’s not even a question you should be asking,” Harry fumed. “I trust him with my life.”
Harry and Ron burst into laughter. Harry had missed this; he had been so wrapped up in obsessing with Draco being a Death Eater, and Ron had been so busy with Lavender and arguing with Hermione that they had not spent proper time together.
Harry kept his eyes on him, then shook his head. “Anyway. I guess we should talk about something else. We’re on thin ice with rule two,” he smiled. Draco tried to give one back, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. Harry just leaned forward and kissed him on the lips carefully. “I love you,” he mumbled against Draco’s lips.
“Only because you were going to press me for answers! I still needed to process everything that happened,” Draco exclaimed, but there was no hiding it. The date had gone extremely well, and what gave away this was his wide grin. “I can’t stop smiling.”
“Ah, okay, you should’ve told me that,” Hermione shook her head as she set down the two mugs of hot cocoa. “Now this is dangerous territory. Either you lead him on only to break his heart, or you fall in love again.”
She put an arm around him. “You did the right thing, Draco. That can’t have been easy. Choosing between him and your family.”
Harry entered the Great Hall on Saturday morning, practically slamming his textbook on the table. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, but didn’t say anything.
“It’s got all sorts of things. Muggle things, though. One of my dorm mates is Muggle-born, I just took it from her.”
“What’s there for me to say?” he shrugged, sinking down on the chair. “I don’t want to do this anymore. I’m just… so sick of all of it.”
“Ah, yes. They don’t allow us to be in separate houses, though, and Quidditch is simply out of the question… it’s really a pity. All of us had quite a lot of fun playing the sport,” Harry explained, awkwardly eating the food. It wasn’t that the food was bad, it was just that he felt odd feeling Lucius Malfoy’s eyes on him as he ate.
“I didn’t think you were gonna come,” he said, folding his arms.
Lucius turned around, looking at him questioningly.
“I figured that would happen. The things I do for you,” he shook his head. He got out the food and Harry dived right in, having not eaten breakfast out of excitement for their date. “Harry, I say this not because I think it’s unattractive, but hazardous for your health. Don’t stuff your face with food. You’ll feel sick.”

“Hey, Harry.” Draco murmured, sitting down at the end of the couch. Harry was lying down. He now put his feet on Draco’s lap as he continued reading. After the conversation with Snape, Draco was not able to think straight.
“Just so you know,” Astoria said, “the streak in your hair is dark again.”
“Oh, there it is,” Luna said casually, looking up at the branch where her shoes were tied. Harry reached up and got it for her, handing it to her. Just then, Harry heard the bell chime at the Clock Tower, indicating the start of class. “Thank you, Harry!”
He quickly rolled up the paper and sent it off with Hedwig before could overthink it. He knew it seemed clingy in a way, but he couldn’t help it. He couldn’t help but feel something was wrong.
time! And it didn’t even taste so bad!”
He jumped when Ron tapped him on the shoulder, then sighed irritatedly. “What?”
“You’re worth the risk, Draco, but not when it’s you I’d be losing,” Harry stepped forward too. “I saw what happened with Sirius. I don’t care anymore. I want to spend time with you. I’m all in, for real this time. If you’ll have me.”
“You can’t be serious,” Draco was saying, “the whole point of it is…”
The brown owl flew out of the window and out into the sky, in search of Harry Potter.
P.S. the plot is kicking in woohoooo
“You don’t trust me?” Draco said after a few moments.
The two boys pulled apart at the same time, gasping for air. Neither of them had realized how close their bodies were. Draco started kissing Harry’s neck softly. Harry leaned back and let him do so. The two were craving for attention from the other.
Harry didn’t remember most of what happened, just a few moments of the beginning of his conversation with Draco. He didn’t remember how he got into bed, or what happened before that. And additional to the pounding headache, Harry’s scar was burning slightly and his chest felt queasy. He slowly got up, exiting the dorm and slowly walking down the hallway to Draco’s dorm, knocking on the door lightly. Though it was ten in the morning, no one was awake - everyone was probably hungover from the party.
“You fucking prat!” He yelled, putting it his sweater back on and glaring at Harry who was still laughing uncontrollably.
Harry smiled, before determinedly saying, “I won’t.”
“I think you’re ahead of me in WSL now,” he said, and the two exchanged a small smile. “Anyway, he can do whatever he likes. He’s a coward, really. The worst he could do is learn more insults in sign language.”
“Yes?”
“You don’t need to know,” Harry said. “But I realize I can’t just leave you hanging.”
“You’re late,” Draco said with an eye roll.
Draco had been laying down on his bed, with the doors locked, staring up at the ceiling. Draco felt like he was in Sixth Year all over again. The feelings were the same, only this time so much worse. They had been through so, so much together. Didn’t that mean anything to Harry?
“Hey,” Blaise said, pursing his lips. “...Pansy helped me realize that what I did was out of line and stupid. So… I’m sorry for everything I said. I didn’t mean to sound so homophobic.”
“You’ve been avoiding me.”
“I’m not gay!” Draco shouted to himself as he exited his dorm. Pansy burst out laughing behind him.
Lucius said nothing.
He opened the letter, rolling his eyes at the corny poem as Snape started the lesson. Harry was having a hard time paying attention. It was hard to keep up with him while taking notes at the same time. Despite the notes being on the board, Snape did like to add detail while speaking and Harry was no where near perfect at lip reading yet, not that Snape was trying his best to make sure he understood.
“Have you heard of anything? A cure?” he asked.
“Did something happen?” he asked. “Is it the letter?”
Draco Malfoy’s smile was like the calm after the storm.
“Just to confirm,” Ron piped up, “Hermione didn’t tell me a thing about this. But… I did kind of question the hair thing…”
“Okay, so we’re going on a broom now? Draco, I’m terrified! Please-”
“Harry…” Draco heaved a sigh, then motioned for Harry to follow him, who did so, a smile on his face.
“I didn’t want to start another fight,” Harry muttered, setting down his quill on the table, pausing writing his essay. “So, why weren’t you on the train?”
“How is this-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry-” he said in a whiny tone, shaking his head. “Get to writing before I slap you in the face.”
Draco’s eyebrows were furrowed and he was holding Harry’s hands tightly. This was crazy. He could hear Draco’s gentle breathing. The wind rustling the leaves just outside the window. The gentle shift of the covers as he sat up properly.
walked towards Harry, careful to give space. “...And I just felt really off. I knew something was up,” Draco explained as he wiped tears off of his face too. He slowly sat on the large, large bed, slowly approaching Harry, wrapping his arms around him.
I dunno how I feel about this chapter lol
Draco felt absolutely horrible. He didn’t know what to do. He frowned, staring at Harry.
“Fair point.”
She gave him a blank stare. “I love you, Malfoy, I do, but I can’t handle you around all the time. I’ve been doing it for six years and I’m growing a bit tired of it,” she sighed dramatically, then laughed when Draco kicked her with his foot.
Draco hesitated, unsure of how to word his sentence. “Remember when we broke up?”
Harry sat in Charms class, staring at the board, rather confused. They were learning a new spell, but he was unable to understand how to pronounce it. He looked over to Ron and Hermione beside who were casting the spell perfectly, too embarrassed to ask them anything yet again.
Draco hesitantly put his arms around Harry so he wouldn’t fall, biting his lip.
*******
“What has happened?” Dumbledore asked.
“Physically? Yes,” he sighed, rubbing his hands together, groaning when someone knocked again. “Could you also get the door?”
The person wrapped their arms around Draco’s neck, pushing him against the nearest wall and kissing him deeply.
“There are more important things than being a poet, Harry,” he scoffed. “And I’m nowhere near good,” he gulped. He felt rather uncomfortable to talk about the poems he wrote, especially when they were about Harry. “But… uh… thanks.”
“Hey,” Harry whispered amidst of everyone chattering away loudly as he sat down and put his bag aside. Only Draco heard him and smiled slightly. That’s literally all they could at this point; giving each other a full smile would attract too much attention.
“I don’t need your fucking help.”
p.s 2: I just realized it might be a bit unclear in the chapter: Harry does not actually send the letter to Draco.
“Oh, good, because I thought that was just me,” Draco let out a sigh of relief, pulling Harry to his chest. “You know, we could still create a life together. I can get divorced. Astoria wouldn’t mind. We’re already in an understanding that we don’t love each other. I could move away from my stupid house and be with my real family. That would be you, by the way.”
“God, Draco, this is so good,” Astoria groaned.
“Er…” he looked around at everyone, avoiding Draco’s eyes. “Yeah, something came up, so I’m afraid I have to leave. Sorry, Molly.”
“How are you, Pansy?” He asked as she returned to her spot.
“Yeah, we just decided to have a small Christmas dinner with mine and Astoria’s family,” he cleared his throat, taking a sip from his drink. “I’ll try to come this Christmas, but I’m not sure what the plans are yet.”
If it were anyone else, Draco would have immediately pushed them off of him, but knowing it was Harry, he simply held on to Harry (sneakily) so he could balance them to stand upright. But Harry was heavier than Draco expected, so they both went crashing down to the floor.
“Maybe because I’m not paying attention?”
“Mind you, we’re supposed to be studying right now too,” he pointed out. Harry simply smiled, leaning forward and kissing him, shutting his eyes. Draco ran his hands up and down his back, subtly lowering down to his ass. “I said studying, Harry.”
He let out a loose laugh, walking closer to Draco, who gulped. “I’m kidding. Thank you for the poem.”
“Coming for the feast, Harry?” asked Ron - the Eighth years were allowed to go to their rooms and set up their rooms before the feast - as he walked over to the door, looking back at his best friend.
“Yeah, you’re right,” she nodded.
Then, Lucius excused him out of the room.
Draco was practically just standing there, waiting for his father to come outside. Draco let out a shaky breath, slowly turning around to face his father. “Goodbye,” said the blond in a more mocking tone than a genuine tone, “see you next year.”
“Shut the fuck up, Harry.” Draco muttered, starting to get annoyed.
“N-no, I’ll do it,” said Draco in a shaky voice, slowly standing up and grabbing Harry by the shoulder, pulling him up. He then took Ron and pulled the two down the passageway and down to the cellar.
“Yes it is. I told him my feelings and how I felt. He should respect that.”
“Tell me about it,” Ron replied as he sat down beside Harry, grabbing a piece of chicken for himself. “It’s kind of stupid how they expect you to stay on top of work if they can’t do much to accommodate to your needs."
“I actually need to finish this essay, fuck,” Harry said, quickly getting out his quill and ink, starting to write as fast as he could, the stress in his eyes clear as day. Draco snickered beside him. “Oh, shut the fuck up, Draco,” Harry muttered as he continued writing.
“Well, that was because Harry was behaving like an absolute idiot, which resulted in me-”
It didn’t work. So he tried, five times more. But it didn’t work. Harry sighed in defeat, turning around, starting to walk away.
“Um… I know I said you shouldn’t tell me, but-”
“Sorry,” Harry jerked his hand away. “It’s not my place.”
Still trembling, the white-haired boy refused to look at his lover’s killer in the eye, reluctantly getting out his mother’s wand that was in his pocket, and Apparating away.
“Sorry, what?” he turned to look at her.
“So, what now?” Harry asked, panting.
“Draco, please. For your own safety. For the sake of us.”
“I don’t blame you. I don’t hate you. And I certainly don’t think you don’t deserve me. We both made mistakes. It wasn’t only you. So don’t blame yourself.”
He looked up at Hermione. “I-”
, they’re still your friends and I’d like to be in a room with them without either of us having to be at each other’s throats. I mean, hey, I didn’t say anything until she started being all vicious.”
Both Hermione and Harry stared at him for a few moments.
“Right,” she said down near the foot of his bed, watching as he turned to lie on his back, staring up at the ceiling. “Why do you seem so stressed?”
“Since your first rant about Harry Potter. That’s sort of a dead giveaway,” she said, chuckling. “But take your time figuring things out. And I’m always with you, no matter what.”
“To please my father,” He admitted once he had snapped out of his thoughts, a sheepish smile on his face as if he was ashamed to say it. “He prefers it like this. That’s a bit difficult for me to say.”
“Oh, uh… I thought it was an odd number, so I was going to work alone,” Draco explained.
With a soft kiss, Harry pulled away, shaking off the sentimentalities and sitting down on the couch, adjusting his glasses. “Enough. I don’t want to be sad.”
thank you so much for all the love recently!! <33
********
Much more.
“Wait, Harry, how’d you know they’re here?” Hermione asked, her eyes widening.
“What?” Harry asked confused when Draco eagerly smiled, walking over to Harry and handing him the box. “Draco, you didn’t have to-”
“Smooth motherfucker,” Draco muttered under his breath. “Scarhead-”
With a deep breath, Harry nodded slowly. “...fine. But if it doesn’t work…” he placed each of them in either of his ears, adjusting them properly. Looking up into Draco’s eyes, he squinted, too scared to speak.
*******
“Oh,” he said, putting a hand to exactly where the streak used to be. “I dyed it white. Got sick of looking at it, you know? Anyway, where’s my tux? I’ll go to the bathroom and get ready.”
“Well, yeah, because you need to know them. Anyway,” he threw the textbook in his hands somewhat aggressively. “Read it again. You have five minutes.”
“Whenever you’re ready, send it,” Then she left his room. Draco searched his drawer for a blank sheet of paper and realized he hadn’t had any left in his room. He quickly slipped out and found a stack of papers lying on the table in the hallway.
“It’s our anniversary,” he said softly, sounding defeated. “Dates aren’t quite important, I know, but…”

Harry stared into Draco’s silver eyes as his breath finally evened out, calming himself. Draco was comfortingly squeezing Harry’s hand. “Are you okay?”
“Harry? Oh, come on!” Hermione snapped annoyedly, realizing that he wasn’t even listening.
“Again?” Harry asked, frowning. “Was she sick before?”
“I don’t have the strength to fight with you, Harry, so please,” Draco shook his head, his eyes glistening with tears. He took out his wand, his hands trembling, wiping his face furiously - as if he was ashamed to be crying. “Stay safe for me.”
He quickly wrote down a note for Draco to meet him in front of the Slytherin Common Room.
“Wow, just out me like that, thanks,” Draco said half-jokingly. Harry snickered but Hermione raised an eyebrow at Draco. “I… I was joking- never mind.” Draco looked away from Hermione.
“Draco, I’m always here if you need anything, you know that right?” Harry asked, leaning upwards and kissing Draco’s cheek before intertwining their hands together.
He sighed. “Yeah. We’re done. He said he can’t move past this.”
“I don’t think they’re even trying to look like enemies anymore,” Ron replied, frowning as he stared at Draco and Harry, who had both stopped insulting each other and were just staring into each other’s eyes; both looking like they’ve never seen something more beautiful before.
“Pansy, I really don’t-”
p.s. enjoy a new chapter it's been like what 1000 years? weeeeeee
“Yeah, I’m just not sure the exact number of feet we’re supposed to be apart,” he said, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly, feeling tense under Harry’s heavy gaze.
He sighed exasperatedly. “How would I know?”
Draco cast him a long look. “Harry. Why aren’t you-”
Harry kicked his foot suddenly, trying to casually make it seem as if he had just stepped closer to the cauldron in front of them.
“Ouch?” Harry questioned, raising an eyebrow.
“Draco, are you okay?” Pansy asked, noticing Draco clutching his arm tightly. Then she sighed when she realized what it was. “Are you ever going to tell me what he’s making you do-”
“Harry, we’ve been practicing non-stop without you, I really have a good feeling about this one,” Ron said as Harry sat down at the Gryffindor table, starting to eat some toast. “When are you going to join us for practice? Our next practice is this evening.”
spell on you, I think you’re good-”
Draco spent most of his time wandering around, rather than actually trying to find Harry. Like hell, he was going to do what his father said. Even if he did manage to find Harry, he would probably send him even further away from the Death Eaters.
“Harry? Harry, are you even listening?” Hermione asked, snapping him out of his daze. “Are you still on about Draco being suspicious?” She said with an annoyed expression on her face as she turned to look at Draco, who now shot a glare at her as well.
And suddenly, Harry could feel it.
“And… have you made a decision about his proposal yet?” he continued, sitting down on the couch. Hermione and Harry both sat down as well. Ron was surprisingly supportive, despite his ‘I told you so’s after their break up.
He looked up at her. “You’re kidding,” he mumbled. “No way.”
“Yeah, but nothing quite like the one on Monday,” Harry said, reaching into his pocket and taking it out. Draco felt his heart race, heat flushing his cheeks. “That one was…”
He stayed silent for a moment. “So there’s really nothing you want to say to me?”
Draco watched him, standing up as the soft, slow music started to play. “Dance with me?” he put his hand out. Harry took it, and they swayed to the music. Draco’s hands were on Harry’s waist. “I like this song. Sirius had good taste.”
“Oh, Harry was just in New York.”
“Yes,” he nodded, gulping nervously as he shut the door behind him. “I’m so sorry, Mother. I was selfish. Our last conversation… I don’t want you to remember my voice like that. I was out of line.”
“No, you are not! Next thing I know, you’ll be skipping classes.” Draco scolded. “You are so out of line; not taking care of yourself, --”
“Like you feel sorry for me. I’m aware how pathetic I might seem compared to you. I mean, you’re in the middle of all of this, and I’m just… a minion, I suppose. Someone to do the dirty work for him.”
She stared at him for a moment, then smacked the back of his head. “I get it. Your family doesn’t like him. But why should you let that determine how you feel about him hmm? Since when are you a follower?”
“Where else are you?” Harry asked, tears streaming down his face.
“Shut up. Shut up, Harry.” Draco was trying to hold back the tears. “Why are you like this?”
“Well, that much is obvious,” he replied. “Why would you fight about me?”
“Yes, ouch. I’m a part of your life, am I not?” Draco asked offendedly.
“Uh, wow,” Harry said, blinking in confusion, “I didn’t realize… that your father was… like that.” Harry’s fists clenched under the table, and he looked away from Draco, trying to keep the anger he was feeling hidden. Harry knew that it would probably just make Draco feel worse.
“Wait… would it work?” he smiled. “This is great!”
“There’s no point in trying to fool me,” Hermione said with a sigh.
“Heads up,” Harry said before jumping on Draco, wrapping his legs around his waist.
“Oh, this is hilarious!” Dean said through laughter. “Two enemies, together in a room for seven minutes. Yes please!”
“That’s not sorting things out!” she snapped.
“I am too,” he said. “Does this have anything to do with that girl who’s been sending you love letters?”
Harry did not remember falling asleep. He only remembered being back in Grimmauld Place, being woken by the ghost of a kiss that he could feel on his cheek. The pain of being apart from Draco was still there, but it was less. That was a start.
Harry had spent the past month or so pacing, pondering, imagining, daydreaming. He found himself unable to focus, nor did he go out much - well, it wasn’t as if he had been going out too often anyway. His shop was closed more often than it was open, but none of that seemed to matter to him.
“You would, if you treated me as you usually would. I’m your friend, ‘Mione, not some charity work. I need your support, but I don’t need you to be my lifeline.”
“Hey,” he said, pushing Harry back gently so he could see his lips while he talked, keeping his hands on his face, “I’ll give the Muggles this game. It’s good, realistic, and- are you listening, Harry?”
Draco leaned forward, pressing his forehead against Harry’s. “I know, my love. It hurts me too. More than you could imagine. But we have to stay strong.”
“Hmm? No. Oops.” Harry realized, quickly fumbling around, looking for his Potions textbook, getting it out. “I reckon I should do it now, right?”
Draco and Harry Apparated together in front of Malfoy Manor, and Draco took a hold of Harry’s hand, holding it tightly. “You’ll be okay,” He said softly.
“No,” he said quickly. “No. I understand, Father. When the time comes, I will help.” He had learnt to sound genuine when he said these things.
sounds any better?” Harry cut him off with an eye roll.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, I did. Congratulations,” Harry said. Ginny took this as an opportunity to quickly walk away, making Harry at ease again, not listening to a word of what Ron was telling Harry about the match.
“Hey, Draco, you’ve been to New York, haven’t you?” Pansy said, bringing back to the moment. He blinked, frowning as he looked over to Ron, Hermione, and Harry who were all staring at him.
Pansy looked at Draco in amusement, then made a ‘wh-tshh’ sound while she mimed a whip. A puzzled expression on his face, he held his gaze on her for a few moments while she simply stared back, seeming quite satisfied with herself.
All four of them turned to face Harry.
Pansy shook her head. “No,” She replied, frowning. “We exchanged a few letters. He said he would be here today. I don’t know, though. Maybe something happened with his father.”
“Yeah, you’ll be saying that until it’s one day before exams and you’re cramming everything in your brain,” Draco replied with an eye roll, lifting his arm and starting to stroke Harry’s hair gently.
Draco turned to Harry, handing the note back under the table.
His eyes widened slightly, setting down his glass. “He’s still abroad?”
He turned to her, fuming. “Stop it, Pansy,” he snapped. “Stop meddling. Seriously. Making us sit together at the dinner table? We’re not school kids anymore, honestly! These are feelings you’re playing with.”
He couldn’t mask it anymore.
“Actually, I thought it was quite sweet.”
Breathing deeply, Harry fiddled with the necklace in his hands. He had to think this through properly this time. Of course, there was a big chance that Draco didn’t want anything to do with him again. What Pansy had said lingered in his mind - she was right. Draco chose to be part of this. He chose to be with him in spite of the complications. It was a big risk he was taking too.
Harry nodded at Draco, before feeling dizzy and falling right on Draco, “The room is really spinny today,” He slurred slightly. Feeling Draco’s hand touch his head, he flinched and got up, glaring at him. “Okay, excuse me. I don’t mean to be rude, but I have a boyfriend.”
“It is not!”
actually deaf and not… pretending, like you said?” she asked. She tried not to show it, but she was surprised by his signing ability.
All Harry hoped was that Draco didn’t really mean that he couldn’t be with someone who didn’t ‘trust him’. Draco knew that Harry trusted him with every strand of his being, didn’t he? Draco would never… not trust him, no matter what…
I love this chapter :))
“Hey, Draco, today’s the day!” Pansy said, not bothering to knock as she entered the room, rolling her eyes when she saw he was still in bed. “Get up, bonehead! It’s your wedding day!”
After a few moments, Draco awkwardly cleared his throat and looked down, before quickly eating his food and leaving the hall. Harry took it as a signal to eat his food as possible too, quickly leaving too.
“Something wrong?” Draco mouthed, frowning.
“Okay, this is where we part ways,” Draco said, pushing his hair out of his eyes. “Get home safely.”
“Oh, give me a break.”
“What?” Harry asked in confusion.
“Ones with... Draco in them…” Harry mumbled.
“He’s just tired,” Harry said to the rest who were raising an eyebrow, surprised that Harry was going along with Draco’s dramatic act, watching as he ran his fingers through Draco’s hair and held him tightly. “He’ll be fine once he sees the fireworks.”
“I ruined nothing,” Harry said calmly. “If anything, you ruined everything.”
“There’s no home to wreck,” he replied. “Wow. That was a bit deep, wasn’t it?”
As soon as those words came out of Ron’s mouth, Harry kicked off the duvet and grabbed the piece of paper from Ron’s hand, not bothering to take anything with him before running out the door.
Harry looked up at Draco who had entered the cellar along with them, looking around the area frantically.
And then, Severus Snape killed Albus Dumbledore.
His green eyes twinkled. “You know me better than that, love. Of course I blame myself. I always do.”
“Yeah, and we’ve been enemies for five years! Do you expect that to just go away now that we’re dating? You expect me to just forget the kinds of things you’ve done?”
After a lot of insisting from Harry, they decided that the hearing aids he received would be as large as the gifts would ever go, because he never wanted to feel like he was using Draco’s money for his benefit. Much after Draco’s whining and pleading that there was a difference between
“N-nothing.” Harry was now getting scared of Draco who was glaring at him.
“What? No. No, I refuse to drink that.” Harry protested in disbelief.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, grinning back. Harry reached out to take the Snitch from Ginny, put she put her arm out of reach.
Pansy, Narcissa and Astoria were going shopping for any last minute details for the wedding. Draco smiled at his mother as she left the room. Pansy stood up to leave, as did Astoria.
“Get a room,” Pansy told them, rolling her eyes again as she turned around.
Draco fixed his shirt, looking over to Astoria, giving her a small smile. “How do I look?”
Harry leaned forward and kissed him, this time a little more intense, but still sweet all the same.
“We do
“Why? What’s so wrong with that? I’m your boyfriend, Harry,” he said, taking a step closer.
“I don’t need you to apologize, love,” Harry whispered softly. He sunk to the floor, and so did Draco. Draco slowly and hesitantly crawled onto Harry’s lap, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco turned and for a moment, Harry could’ve sworn they had made eye contact.
“He’s not in the castle,” Harry said after a few moments of silence.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Come on, Malfoy, get your head in the game. In a real battle, he wouldn’t have time to prepare.”
“Don’t be so stupid, Harry. I can’t be displaying it,” he quickly reached for his sweater again, but Harry grabbed his arms. “Stop it. I only took my sweater off for a moment.”
, don’t.”
“Funny?”
Hermione and Pansy entered the Hospital Wing, going to Harry’s bed. It was quite late at night. Hermione and Pansy sat down on two chairs beside the bed, not noticing that Harry was wide awake.
Draco looked down at his wrist, quickly pulling his sweater over it. “Um… yeah. Harry gave it to me. I know I shouldn’t, but…” he paused. “Speaking of which, why did you set us up like that? I… wasn’t prepared for it.”
Draco bit his lip, his eyebrows furrowed into a frown, as he registered what Snape was saying.
“You’re Harry Potter,” he said, looking away.
“I-I’ve got a job to do.”
Guilt, resentment, hate.
Harry took his hands. “Like I want to hear you speak forever,” he smiled. “Talk. I haven’t heard your voice in so long. Last time I heard it you were probably telling me how I was going to lose the Triwizard Tournament.”
“What, you thought we’d let you go on your own?” Hermione said with an eye roll. “Yeah, no way that’s happening.”
The two slowly walked out of the dorm, Harry smiling and Draco still upset over the information he had just found out.
After a long kiss, they pulled apart and Harry slowly got off Draco and then they slipped out of the closet one by one after the bell rung.
“Ron, you’re such an idiot,” Hermione rolled her eyes, signing along as she spoke. Draco was glad for two things - one being that he knew basic sign language, and the other that the three used sign language to communicate while speaking. “The important question is,
Draco’s blush deepened. “Stop it.”
I just wanted to thank you all for reading, liking and commenting this story. I honestly worked so hard on it and the comments make me so happy. I'm so, so happy you guys like this fic. Don't worry, I have quite a few ideas left so this fic will be continued!
Draco chuckled. “It helped, thank you,” he said while signing, looking down at the letter in his hands. “It’s my mother,” he blurted suddenly. “She’s fallen sick again.”
“I only did what I thought was right,” Draco raised his voice as well, growing angrier by the minute. “You should be thankful!”
“Yes?” Harry folded his arms. “Like… I don’t know, how you’ve been avoiding me?”
Unsure if he should smile or nod or ignore his existence, the seeming trance placed on him was broken by Hermione who nudged him. “What do you want to drink?” she signed.
And then they quickly Apparated away along with Hermione and Ron.
“Wow,” Draco said, inching his face closer to Harry’s, “it feels so good to hear that… right here,” he took Harry’s hand and put it over his heart.
“That it is."
He sighed and looked around, then nodded. “Go work with Mr. Malfoy.”
“Of course,” he replied, smiling. He picked up his coat, feeling everyone’s eyes on him as he left. Draco felt his heart sink as he watched him leave. He needed to open that book again. What was the advice on being married and on weird terms with your soulmate?
She ran a hand through her hair. “You and Harry could meet here. Once a week or something. Spend some time with him,” she offered. “I do request that if you’re going to have sex, do it in the guest room down the hallway. In fact, you can hang out there.”
“Say that again,” Draco said when he pulled away, panting. He had locked Harry in place with either leg by his hips.
Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, before shrugging. “It’s more just a dinner party… It had been a while since we’d seen everyone. Besides, we needed an excuse to get you here. You haven’t come to visit us once!”
She took his hand. “Just be honest when it happens. Whatever it is that you’re dreading. If you guys work through it together it’d be easier.”
Ginny Weasley, who was sitting next to Harry, choked on the water she was drinking, spitting it out all over her plate, coughing violently. “I’m okay,” She said croakily, patting her chest and drinking more water to calm herself. Draco snickered behind his hands, trying his best to stop laughing, which made Harry start to snicker too.
Harry stared at her for a few seconds. It was almost as if she knew about how Harry felt colder and more drained when Draco wasn’t around, just the way he felt when he had been away from Draco in the summer.
“I’m always hurting,” Harry said without thinking. When Draco gave him a confused look, he clenched his jaw. “When I’m not thinking about Dumbledore, I’m thinking about Sirius. And when I’m not thinking about him, I’m thinking of Cedric or my parents. And when I finally get a break from the guilt, I’m thinking about
“I can’t have you failing the year now, can I?” Draco responded. “Don’t tell me you’re falling asleep. Honestly, if you were so tired, why did you even want to meet up?” Draco asked, continuing to stroke his hair, biting his lip.
“I don’t want to hurt you, Harry,” he whispered, holding back tears. “Pushing you away feels awful.”
After their first DADA class with Umbridge, the three were already tired of Umbridge and her stupidity. Ron and Hermione sat down beside Harry, who kept his eyes on the fireplace, expression blank.
“Oh, that’s much better,” Harry said with a scoff.
And Draco may have not known what Harry was thinking, but his heart could feel it. He could read Harry’s green eyes, and he could read how he had hurt Harry with just that one sentence.
The rest of the words echoed out of Harry’s ear. Draco was the one who had poisoned Ron.
“Alright, you two,” McGonagall said as she entered the room, sitting down at her desk. “I am absolutely appalled by your behavior,” she said while signing.
“You asked,” the blond responded, holding up the note. He sat down beside the other. Harry put a tentative hand to his wounded cheek. Draco flinched slightly, but let him touch it, unable to look at him.
“No,” Harry snapped, tears in his eyes. “It’s tainted now. You can throw it away. I, uh… I don’t want to look at it.”
“There
“Father,
“Yeah, well, he doesn’t make sense either,” Harry replied, looking down at his food. Ron and Hermione exchanged glances, but said nothing in response, choosing not to comment on the fact that he was smiling.
“I’m just surprised no one’s noticed,” She replied, frowning slightly. “They went from death threats to insulting each other’s hair because they have nothing else to insult the other with. Doesn’t get any gayer than that.”
Harry felt his vision blur, quickly wiping his eyes. This was stupid. Why was a poem from Draco Malfoy making him emotional? That aside, who was it even about? Who was ‘she’? He felt a tinge of anger. He didn’t want to get the discards of poems that were supposed to be for a girl he liked.
you guys have no idea how many times i tried to rewrite this chapter. things just weren't working! but i finally figured out what felt right, so here i am! i hope you guys are still around. i know i make you guys wait a lot for a new chapter, and i'm so sorry. i appreciate all of you for being so patient! i'll try to make the next update sooner.
“Ours.”
Then, he turned, and walked away, not looking back.
“I didn’t know what the spell did,” Harry said at once. “I really didn’t. I was angry, and I was hurt, and I wasn’t thinking straight. I know there’s no excuse, but Draco, I-”
“Alright, I’ll start first!” said Pansy, getting an empty Firewhisky bottle and spinning it. It landed on Blaise. The two shared a quick kiss. Then, it went on to several other people, until finally…
Ginny nodded helplessly, and Molly and Harry both followed after her into the kitchen, both trying not to laugh at the burnt apple pie. “This… is unsalvageable. How did you manage to burn it?”
“I heard your argument with Hermione,” Draco said, clearing his throat -  he had gotten lost in Harry’s eyes. “I don’t think you should blame her for what happened. She and Pansy are ridiculous, but… I’m sure they just meant well.”
“Oh, I didn’t know you two were friends,” A casual voice said. Hermione and Pansy turned to see Luna Lovegood smiling at them curiously.
Harry didn’t move from his bed at all, for most of the day. He stayed in the same position, hidden behind his curtains, his face emotionless, his mind blank.
The two were in silence for a few seconds, before Harry burst out laughing. “Dear lord, things are sure going to be awkward at breakfast tomorrow.” Draco nodded in agreement, sighing.
argue all the time! How rude.” The two managed to somehow say at the same time.
There was no response.
I've been reading your comments and it really makes me feel so happy. Even though I haven't touched this story in a while, I still get an occasional comment that makes me feel terrible for not finishing this story, so... here I am. Some things may seem rushed or strange but I'm trying my best. The spark that was there is slowly returning. Thanks for waiting for so long.
“And,” the Headmaster tilted his head, “what might you say if someone heard you say such a thing?”
“My biggest fear was losing you,” Harry stared down at his cup. “It doesn’t matter how. Didn’t.”
With both Draco and Pansy taking turns, it was a bit more difficult, but he was able to work with it. After about five more minutes, the three of them came to a stop, tired out.
“Did you hear what Harry said? He
“Well, Hermione and I came rushing to see what was wrong. Then Parkinson did too, and so did Luna and a few other students. Then Professor McGonagall asked everyone to move out of the way as she took you to the Hospital Wing. We weren’t allowed to visit you until Friday. Harry, when we saw you on Friday… you looked horrible.” Ron explained. “Hermione even started crying, but she’ll never admit that to you.”
Harry wished to himself,
Picking up his quill, he pursed his lips, staring at the dying fire in front of him, the quiet crackling of the wood. Moving closer to the fire, he straightened the fresh page of his journal. Perhaps confronting his feelings would help.
It was the day of the feast and Harry had just questioned Nick about Sirius. He felt his chest ache for the first time since it had hit him that Sirius had died, and now he learnt that he wouldn’t be back, ever. Not as a ghost, not as a wizard, nothing.
“Oh, no, Professor Snape. It’ll take a while for him to get fully back to how he was before. He didn’t eat or sleep for over a week or two,” Hermione explained. Pansy wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulder, taking him to their table.
“Uh… I feel a bit tired, I guess-”
“Tons,” Hermione said, taking his hand and dragging him to the drinks table. “Uh, here’s a glass-” She stopped talking as Harry grabbed the whole bottle itself and starting chugging it down. “Is everything okay?”
“I know,” Harry replied quietly, munching on his toast.
“Come closer, Draco, dear,” Bellatrix said softly, taking his hand and pulling him closer to Harry. Draco kneeled too, finally letting himself look at him. “Is it him? Is it Harry Potter?”
She smiled at him almost sympathetically, then cleared her throat awkwardly. “Well, run along now. You’ve a feast to get to.”
“How’d you know I was awake?”
“Are you even listening?” Harry asked with an eye roll.
“Join the Death Eaters,” Harry told Draco, realizing there was no time and no point in explaining anything to Ron at that moment. “At least make it
“No, Draco, I do,” More tears ran down his face. “I’m sorry. What happened in March was stupid. I was scared of my own feelings, and I was scared that you would be hurt because of me. I can’t help Hermione and Ron, they’re like… my ride-or-die. But you, I could save you, which is why I tried to push you away.”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand again gently. “I’m sorry. It sounds like a lot.”
“Ah, fuck,” Harry groaned, pulling away from Draco and massaging his temples. “Draco, could you--”
“You have customers waiting,” Hermione said, taking the potion from Ron’s hand. The two marveled at the little bottle. Harry’s eyes moved to the rings on their fingers. The wedding day of his best friends was the best day of his life, but also the most painful. Seeing the rings, he thought of his promise ring, which was hidden in a small box somewhere in his closet, far out of sight.
“You seem to be in a good mood,” he commented, adjusting his glasses as he got out his Charms textbook as well his wand. “Met with your girlfriend?”
comment your thoughts on this chapter? x
“Malfoy-”
“Cut it out!” McGonagall snapped her fingers. “You two will
“Stop stalling,” Harry said with an eye roll. “We should talk about it.”
“Harry,” he tried staying calm, but his eyes were already welled up. “I thought… you made your decision about me. About us.”
“Maybe,” Harry said. The pain finally faded away for him. But the pain didn’t stop for Draco.
“Well, uh… Harry will be having dinner with us, Father,” Draco said, edging closer to Harry, who was trying his best to smile. Though he despised Lucius Malfoy, he was trying desperately not to for Draco. Harry knew that the last thing Draco needed right now was for his boyfriend and his father to fight.
“By the way,” the blond said, and Harry could feel a banter coming up. “You’re the one who rejected my handshake, so really, who declared who sworn enemies?”
“It is, isn’t it?” she asked, suddenly getting excited, clapping her hands together. “That’s so cute! Is he your ‘study buddy’ then?”
“Hush,” Harry said, kicking his shoes off, trying his best to feel the vibrations through the floor. “Now, I don’t know any other dance except for the Yule Ball one, so we’re going to have to do that. I’ll lead.”
Harry slammed open his dorm room door, walking inside. Pansy and Draco barely managed to enter through, and went to stand at a corner.
“Hermione, why would that be the only reason I’d be happier?”
Harry felt anger rise up in his chest, and he banged on the door again, sitting down and leaning against the wall next to the door. “I’m not leaving until you open the goddamn door. I know you’re in there, and I know you can hear me, so stop being so hard to deal with, and please open the door.”
Lucky for Harry, he now was able to process the wand movement, quickly understand what spell was being used, then able to counter it before the spell could hit him, or he would duck out of the way and then think of a spell. Draco thought it would be more efficient to be able to counter the spell as quickly as possible.
It felt strange to be back. Everything looked as it did before the war - before Voldemort had destroyed it.
Then he walked away, and the hole in Harry’s heart grew.
After that, all he could think about was Sirius.
“Seriously? Arguing when it’s so close to the New Year?” Hermione asked with an eye roll as she and Ron approached Draco and Harry. Ron just rolled his eyes, implying that he agreed with Hermione.
He glanced over to the Slytherin table, where Draco was laughing and talking with Pansy, Blaise and some other friends.  Their eyes met and Harry’s expression was somewhat confused yet also pissed, and he quickly looked away. He needed to talk to Draco one way or another.
“Because, I know now you were trying to protect me in your own, stupid way,” Draco ran his hand up and down Harry’s arm. “And it’s kind of true what they say. Love is blind. I’m blind for you, Harry.”
“No, I really don’t, what do you mean?” Draco said, leaning against the door of the closet.
“Yeah, got it,” he nodded, quickly stepping away from Harry at what was now considered their usual distance. “Um, is that better?”
After adding a few ingredients, Harry noticed the cauldron was filling up and sighed irritatedly. “Can you pull up your sleeves?” he reached forward and grabbed Draco’s hands, yanking up the sleeves of his robes and shirt, stopping when he noticed the bracelet on his wrist.
. Soon he will be coming to me asking me why I let him date you.”
Harry’s eyes flickered over to Hermione and Ron as he jumped slightly, snapping out of his thoughts. “Huh?” was all he managed to get out, his green eyes still seeming quite far away.
“It’s fine, I wanted to pay.”
“Why do you need it?” Hermione questioned, taking a step forward. She was just by Ron’s bed, giving Harry space that he seemed like he needed.
After everyone was settling on the table, Harry exchanged glances with Draco. So far, only Narcissa had managed to make a nice impression towards Harry. And maybe perhaps one of the house elves, but that was it. Lucius Malfoy had kept his icy expression from the moment he had entered the room and until now.
“He doesn’t, but that was amusing to watch. Harry is a horrible liar.”
Draco snapped his eyes open.
Draco slightly flinched at the mention of his name, however, Lucius took no notice of it. “Go alone. Out of all of the Death Eaters, you know him best. Look at places he would go.”
“Don’t worry, it’s not you,” Ron said, sensing his best friend’s misery. “She’s been like that all day. She’s worried about her own stuff.”
Draco rolled his eyes (but he was grinning at how cute Harry was). “I said if you ever want another set, tell me,” Draco repeated himself, now carefully closing the box which had the other two sets, stowing it away under Harry’s bed.
Harry woke the next Monday morning feeling fine.
“No, I told you that I couldn’t breathe.”
Harry frowned, but decided not to pester. Draco probably needed space. Harry turned away, taking a step back from Draco. But then Harry remembered what it was like for him whenever he was locked away under the stairs inside the closet, how he would just want someone to hug him till he’d forget about the pain that filled his mind and his chest; so Harry took a step forward and wrapped his arms around Draco, walking over to the nearby bench and holding him tightly.
“Were you ever planning on telling me? That a part of you - no matter how big, nor how small - still believes that I could potentially be evil, that I’m just doing Death Eater work, that-”
“Um… Pansy said you wanted to see me,” Harry said.
“Alright,” Harry slowed down his chewing.
Draco held onto his hand tighter, pushing any sensibility he had aside. He pushed away the thought of his father, and whatever task he would be asked to do soon. All that mattered to him in his moment was what Harry had said to him, because he was right. They would be stupid not to try, right?
on the both of us, and you still think it’s a good idea to be with me?”
They were setting the table in silence, until…
Thank you, really.
Harry had given Draco his first ever hickey. The two acknowledged it but simply continued on kissing heatedly. Then, Draco gave Harry
After a few hours of wandering about (and going to the Grimmauld Place and wandering about inside), Draco slowly made his way back to Malfoy Manor.
He put the sweater to his nose, breathing in the distinct scent of Harry, then quickly pulled it over his head. Picking up the journal on his bedside table - along with a quill and some ink - he creeped out of his dorm and sat down at the Slytherin Common Room. He opened the journal, flicking through the poems he had written. As much as he didn’t want to admit it, Harry had helped him find a new hobby; a way to express himself. The problem was most of Draco’s poems were about Harry, and with their fight, he couldn’t find much inspiration.
Narcissa took in a sharp breath, standing up and fixing her dress. “Dinner will be ready soon.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was nothing…” Harry said, slowly sitting down on the couch. “I just wanted you to be comfortable. After all, walking for twenty-five minutes just to reach here gets tiring.”
“Them? Is it a girl?”
Draco pulled Molly Weasley into a hug. “Thank you,” He whispered softly, “but I didn’t get you anything, and-”
She gave him a once-over. “I beg to differ.”
“That was a good pickup line,” Harry muttered.
Draco reached forward to smack him, then softly placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Let’s get cracking, shall we?”
They had gone from enemies, to sort-of-friends, to lovers, to strangers, to lovers again. And they had finally,
,” Harry sobbed, “
“It’d be so good.”
“I really couldn’t tell you,” Hermione answered, seeming somewhat startled.
“And you’d be okay with that?” he asked, his eyes stinging with tears when he noticed Harry’s trembling hands. Gulping, he held his hands with both of his own in an attempt to steady them. “We’d have to go back to being enemies.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but he nodded. “Sounds stupid. Let’s play it.”
“What kind of question is that, Draco? The Dark Lord can see into Harry’s mind. What is he going to do when he sees all these memories with you? He’s going to use you to get to Harry. And your trust from The Dark Lord will be taken away. You know what he threatened to do if you don’t carry out your job.
He did not want to remember. “Yes,” he said after a moment of hesitation.
“Draco,” he whispered, lowering his wand. Relief flooded his chest, and so did a sliver of happiness. Draco was here. In front of him. “Are you with anyone?”
“Baby?” he echoed, looking highly offended.
“I am?” Draco’s voice cracked slightly, and he cleared his throat. “I am?” he repeated, more clearly. “Are you sure?”
“I understand,” he responded, walking towards her. “I miss him too. It’s like… little things, you know? That reminds you of him. Like the change in the color of the leaves, or the first snowfall, or someone who looks at you the way he would.”
“I do, Draco, I am your godfather.”
Shit. He couldn’t watch this.
“What?” Harry asked after a few moments. His chest felt heavy, and he was finding it hard to take in. “You’re kidding, right?”
“Hmm. So do you know why he’s been avoiding me?” he asked, his eyes lighting up slightly. She winced, unsure of how much she should let on, and how much she should leave for them to talk about by themselves. She cleared her throat awkwardly, already knowing that it was a risk she was doing this.
“You know that’s not true,” she nudged him. “Come on, Harry, you could’ve saved-”
Pansy’s eyes widened, then she nodded. “...I can’t say I’m surprised. It
“I’m just glad everyone else is in class and they’re not here to see this,” Pansy said as she facepalmed. Ron and Luna exchanged glances, but the four were glad to see them together - bickering, like always, but still - it made them happy to see that they were happy.
“You’re… such a dumbass…” Draco said during wheezes, shaking his head. “You’re not supposed to let go of my hand!”
“Sure,” Pansy said, nodding. “Why can’t the two of you just work things out?”
Harry couldn’t help but feel so overwhelmed. Along with his unexplained feelings for Draco, he was getting visions of the Dark Lord, and was barely able to communicate with anyone. He was quite grateful for being deaf during the holidays. It gave him an excuse not to speak to anyone.
“As in, if the Dark Lord was after me,” he explained, trying to tread carefully, “for whatever reason… would you sacrifice me for him?”
Harry laughed against his chest, wrapping his arms around Draco’s body. “We could move in together.”
It was a wonder how Draco’s eyes hadn’t dried out yet. His eyes bloodshot red, as he leaned against the wall, hugging his knees, shaking immensely.
Harry’s green eyes met Draco’s silver ones.
The two exchanged a small smile.
“Er… just before my father placed the curse on us,” he said. The look on Harry’s face made him realize he needed to elaborate. “It was an awful day, really. You encountered the Boggart and I was hurt. In my dorm there was this book that Snape had given me during the war. Um… the book basically explained everything about soulmates. I wanted to go see you after that. You know, talk things out, but… My father sent a letter for me to go back home immediately, so I went. Then he put the curse on both of us.”
Pansy just nodded.
“If we’re doing this, we need to have ground rules. Rule one: you have to trust me,” Draco said sternly. Harry was just surprised that Draco was actually giving into this idea. Albeit stupid, it was nice to talk to him after so long.
Harry kept his eyes on him, confused. It seemed that the blond was conflicted, and he was too afraid to ask. He didn’t want to pry, but he didn’t like seeing him like this. It seemed to be a raw, unfiltered version of Draco Malfoy, one that he had never seen before. When he looked up again, his silver eyes held no emotion.
But he was already walking away, as his Dark Mark burned, as his insides lurched, as he tried holding back what felt like a storm of tears.
“Go to the next page,” she said, and he did so, then looked up at her.
“I wish it were that fucking easy,” he let out a soft, bitter chuckle. “I think we’ve been kidding ourselves - or at least, I have. You know, I always thought, deep down, that we would end up together again. Somehow. No matter how much I told myself I hated you, I always knew that wasn’t true. But with every day that passes, the more I think how ridiculous it is of me to think this way. Why are we holding onto a high school relationship? Maybe your father’s actually done us a favor with this curse.”
And then they spent the rest of the night playing Truth or Truth, which eventually dissolved into normal chatter about this and that. The two felt so comfortable around each other, it was unreal. Harry felt happy. And the next morning, when they both made their way back to their dorms, they felt disappointment that the night was over.
got our friends to believe us,” Harry said with a sigh. “If Ron or Hermione had interrogated me further, I probably would have blurted it out right there and then.”
“No, I… I was wondering how you were doing,” he looked down as he spoke, playing with the sleeves of his jumper. “I didn’t get a poem from you today and yesterday, so…”
Draco raised an eyebrow, taking the box from him and opened the wrapping neatly (unlike Harry who ripped it open), placing it to the side, frowning as he stared at a box that had “iPhone 7” written on it.
They sat in a silence for a few minutes before Harry slowly tried to bring up the subject.
“It must be difficult,” Draco whispered.
“Harry, come on!” Draco snapped. “First you don’t tell me about your abusive past, then you’re skipping meals?!”
But, instead...
Pansy nodded and wished Draco a goodnight, before leaving. But she couldn’t help but regret that she didn’t press Draco for answers and to know more about the task he was given.
“I suppose the curse is gone,” Harry commented, putting his hand on the other’s shoulder.
“No,” Harry said quickly, and the video ended.
“I don’t want to,” he whined, groaning. “Besides, I stormed off. I’m not exactly sure who’s supposed to approach the other after an argument like that…”
He blinked in surprise. “Your mother? But…” he stared down at the piece of paper, reading through it again. “Oh.”
He shrugged. “Alright. You?”
“What are you talking about?” Draco asked, confused.
He shrugged. “I suppose.”
“Well… at least come to dinner. You’ve been sitting here all day,” Hermione said, frowning. She held her hand out, and he reluctantly took it, standing up. She wondered if it was a good time to tell him that she knew he had a girlfriend, but decided against it. He had been easily irritable lately when it came to things like that.
“Harry doesn’t know how to dance for his life,” Draco said with a laugh. “He kept on tripping over my foot, and at one point he fell over. If it weren’t for me, he would have bruises all over his face. Then, after dancing we ate some more snacks and just talked. Pansy, it felt so good. I felt so free. I forgot I was a Death Eater. I forgot about what...
“Well, look at it this way-”
“I’m not making fun of you! That was a genuine attempt,” he said, trying not to laugh. “Would you like me to try again?” He straightened his back, running his hands through Draco’s hair. “Ahem ahem,
“I expected this from others,” He finally said. “I’m expected to be evil. I’m a Malfoy, and I’m a Death Eater. I expected this from others. But not from you. Not from fucking
“Why do you want to meet me here?” Draco asked as Harry looked around his dorm. It screamed Slytherin; everything was either green or black.
Much more than he’d ever care to admit.
"So you and my son are...
“Malfoy’s wedding?” Harry questioned, then scoffed. “Don’t tell me he invited you two.”
before Pansy could use
“I was actually dreading sitting alone in this cafe! Just wait here, honey, I’ll get a drink and sit with you,” she smiled, setting her bags down. When she returned, she tilted her head. “So, how have you been? You weren’t there for the Christmas dinner again, so I was a little worried…”
Harry took a few steps towards him, studying Draco’s face. There was worry etched upon his face, and guilt flooding his eyes. There was a sudden switch in Harry’s thoughts. This didn’t have to end their relationship. Nor did he have to let it drive a wedge between them. Yes, this wasn’t easy. But he didn’t want to give up Draco just because of Voldemort.
The first letter he got from Draco was painful to read, and it took so much not to write a reply or even Apparate to him, but it was the last letter he got on his wedding day that hurt even more.
“You saw me all day, Harry. We literally have the same timetable-”
“Wow, okay, that was
Draco bit his lip. “Right, okay. I understand.”
“I don’t need to understand. I don’t need to be able to help,” Harry whispered in a soothing tone, using his index fingers to draw circles on the other’s hand, slowly taking Draco to sit on his bed.
Draco felt his chest ache, moving closer to the other. “What was your plan?” he asked quietly.
Rolling his eyes, Harry removed his scarf and put it around Draco’s neck, securing it properly so it wouldn’t fall off. “Better?” He asked. “Ron and Hermione will be here soon. You
Harry walked to the entrance of the forest on Saturday morning after dinner, to see Draco already leaning against the tree.
“Come on, Harry, you could ask him for your birthday! It’d be like barely anything for him. He’s rich.”
“You would know that I’m not on his side if you let me explain,” Draco told him, glaring at him. “But, no. You were running off with your little girlfriend, making out with her; perhaps even more.”
Days were idle. They seemed to pass by without significant events. Draco would rarely go out unless necessary for his job, which he found himself putting less and less effort into by the day. Even Pansy’s comment didn’t sting too much. He could practically feel his emotions fading day by day.
Harry grinned and picked up a piece of paper to write back, but jumped when Hermione burst open the door. “You scared the shit out of me-”
Draco didn’t do anything but watch him. He studied Harry’s long eyelashes, his pink lips, and his injured nose. He saw very light freckles on the bridge of his nose, and he watched as Harry breathed in and out.
Draco watched him leave, unable to shake off the sudden positive feeling that had overcome him.
idk how to feel about this chapter but I'm posting it before I overthink it too much
“No, I’m just strategic.”
“I could,” he whispered. Harry blinked in surprise. He wasn’t expecting that response. “I could help you with what you’re doing. Then I wouldn’t feel so guilty for each way I’m hurting you. And we could be together everyday.”
Pansy facepalmed. “Shit,” she muttered under her breath. “Yes, it was. Look, don’t think that Draco’s a bad guy. Really. He doesn’t want to be doing that Death Eater stuff at all, h-”
“Well, I don’t think that could work out too well if she’s meddling,” Harry deflected, then shook his head. “Listen, I just think it’s easier if Draco and I go our separate ways.”
“I’m so
!” Draco snapped. “If your nosy arses must know, we have not… done anything yet.”
“Yes, I know.”
It had hit Harry what he had just done.
“I have an idea,” Pansy clutched her mug. “My parents aren’t usually home, and even if they are, they don’t really come up here to my floor.”
“That’s not the only way I can cause pain in your-
Harry bit his lip, his eyebrows furrowing into a frown. “I just wanted to help-”
Draco, who looked up only after a few moments, almost fell over when he saw Harry peacefully sitting beside him. Snape, who noticed immediately, walked over to the table and cleared his throat loudly.
Well, you might not be either.
“Shut up, you’re worse than me, you know. ‘No we did not! I did not kiss anyone!’” Harry imitated Draco, laughing. Draco glared at him.
*******
“So… you throw my hearing aids into the lake. I earn three weeks in detention because of you. Then when I finally think I’m ready to move on from it, you ask me to teach you sign language for a relative you say you don’t even care about, then… then you get mad I kiss a girl, and then you kiss me yourself. You send me these poems that make me blush and smile, and now you won’t even look at my face. If that’s not avoiding me, then I don’t know what is.”
“Talk to me, Draco,” she said in a soft tone, placing her hand on his shoulder. “I’m on your side here. You know I love her. I’m only worried.”
“Gee, thanks,” Draco said with an eye roll, turning away from Harry as he removed his shirt to change into his pajamas. Harry grinned, slowly getting up and walking over to Draco, wrapping his arms around his bare torso, kissing his shoulder gently. Harry felt as the other male froze. He raised an eyebrow but thought nothing of it.
“No! No. I’m okay. Just leave it…”
Draco shot a glare at Harry when he noticed he was staring. Harry, however, didn’t look away. He watched Draco as he sat down at the Slytherin table.
“Do you guys actually need to-”
He cleared his throat. “But the way I treated you was awful.”
He stared at him for a moment, then nodded. “Right, okay,” he said, then started to sign ‘you’re a dumbass’ to Harry, who wasn’t sure if he should laugh or get mad. He settled on the latter.
“Er…” Harry glanced down at his textbook that Draco quickly grabbed so he couldn’t read from it. “Come on! Just tell me the first ingredient.”
What had just happened?
“Prat.” Harry cut him off, rolling his eyes as Draco smirked. “You know what I mean.”
“See you then.”
Draco was nearby, but kept his eyes at his feet, knowing well that there was nothing he could do to stop Blaise without raising suspicion. Pansy caught up to him. “Why are you standing-”
“Harry, we’ve been in the library for five minutes.”
Harry nodded, slowly taking off his glasses and putting them to the side. Draco leaned down and kissed Harry’s forehead.
Molly nodded, a sad look on her face. “I certainly do miss him, that boy. I know he was already hard to get a hold of after graduating from Hogwarts, but… at least he was around.”
? Were his lip-reading skills just really bad or did Draco actually thank him?
well, if you like, i could make one last, BIG chapter, as a finale to this story, because i know a lot of you were (maybe still are!) invested!
“Well, my only friend right now is Pansy, and she’s more interested in having her tongue in some guy’s mouth, so I think I’m alright,” he replied without looking up, biting at his thumb as he stared down at the textbook.
“I’m sorry that I hurt you.”
“Oh, shut up! This is coming from the guy that thought Oreos dipped in orange juice was a good idea!”
“Cedric…” Harry croaked, then sat up quickly, as if he remembered something suddenly, scrambling to get up. “I need to get to get to him before-”
He turned around to leave, he jumped when he noticed Draco standing at the door, his tie loose and hair messy, seeming out of breath. The two locked eyes, and for a moment, everything had left Harry’s mind. The overthinking, the stress, the worrying had left, and the only thing he could think of was: Draco’s eyes had never gleamed this way before.
“Strange,” Hermione replied. “Usually you wouldn’t have done that. Maybe your girlfriend is making you sweet even to your enemies.” Hermione added, just to tease Harry.
“Mhm,” Draco hummed, finding himself getting comfortable in Harry’s arms, slowly drifting off. But just before he fell asleep, a half-asleep thought had occurred to him, one so quick that he perhaps would not remember thinking it when he woke up. One that, if said out loud, would change everything.
“No, it’s fine. You can work with Ron,” he said. “I’ll find someone…” he looked around the Gryffindor side, pursing his lips when he noticed everyone was in pairs already. He jumped when Snape tapped him on the shoulder.
When Draco received no response, he looked down, staring at Harry. The light from the fireworks was reflecting on Harry’s glasses, and Draco found himself unable to look away. The sight of Harry beaming as he stared up at the sky was utterly beautiful; Draco had no words to describe the way he was feeling.
“You need any clearing up on those pages?” Harry asked, leaning forward and scanning the page. The other shook his head and he nodded. “Alright. I’m just finishing up a Potions essay.”
“Christmas isn’t for another twenty-five days,” Ron pointed out.
“There’s no use in hiding it, I suppose. It’s inevitable, and I don’t want you to be surprised. I just want you to know that I’m not going to intentionally hurt you. My father is… cruel. I’m not him. I’m… more like my mother, in a sense-”
Draco wrapped both his arms around Harry, kissing the back of his neck, making him shiver. “I know, darling, and I’m sorry,” and his tone sounded so genuine, Harry knew he meant it. “We could spend the summer…” he trailed off into silence. “Actually, I’m not sure if that’d be a good idea.”
“Who was your first kiss?”
Despite the usual hostility Draco was used to, he found that they had perhaps made a little progress. He wasn’t sure what exactly it was they were working towards, but he realized he was curious to find out.
Wincing, Harry stayed on the ground, opening his eyes on looking up at the concerned silver-eyed boy who was leaning over him. The music continued to play and as the two stared at each other, they burst into laughter.
“Harry!” Hermione called from behind them.
“I guess you heard-” Harry stopped, but so did Draco, so he decided to speak. “You know, when I had imagined meeting your father again, I didn’t think it would be like that. Not nearly. Though, I did expect violence. Like… I don’t know, food being thrown at me.”
“Yeah,” he replied, then carefully took off his hearing aids. Draco signed ‘stand up’, and he did so. Looking down, he moved to adjust his shirt. When he looked back up, he swiftly moved to the left, dodging a spell from Draco just by an inch. “What the fuck?”
The four (Pansy, Luna, Ron, and Hermione) shot Harry a look but went anyways, to the nearby stands that were selling sweet foods. Luna hung back for a few seconds, sensing something was wrong but caught up with the others when Harry noticed that she was still there.
Hours later, in his dorm, Draco stared down at the box, wondering what it could possibly be. He was almost afraid to open it. With trembling hands, he opened the blue velvet box. Inside was a small piece of paper and a bracelet with two charms. One was a silver bird and the other was a music note.
“You know that you talk way too much, right?” Harry asked, pressing his forehead against Draco’s, not breaking eye contact. “Especially when you should be silent. You know, let our eyes do the talking. I actually didn’t think I’d have to
“I would like to speak to you,” Snape said, motioning for Draco to follow him. It was Monday evening and everyone was going to dinner. “Do you have any idea why you’re here?”
“Don’t you get it, Harry? I never loved you, and I never will. The only reason I was with you was for Voldemort. Did you really think I’d have been that careless to let you find out about my Dark Mark? It was because I wanted you to. Because I wanted you to think I was a victim. You were a fool to trust me. I think you’re worthless, useless, disgusting. I never loved you, and I never will.”
“Well, not talking about it hasn’t helped. Why don’t you try something new?”
The Squad started to file out, but Draco and Pansy hung back. “We’ll keep watch, Professor Umbridge,” he said, trying his best to sneer. “Make sure these three don’t try to come up with some way to escape.”
“Oh come on, it’s Draco. He always says things he doesn’t mean.” Pansy told him with an eye roll. Pansy pushed him down on the chair. “Draco told me what happened.”
“Draco, please ju-”
“I was at risk of all of it before you,” Draco folded his arms. “I’m a Malfoy. My life is going to be at risk whether I like it or not. If I’m a Death Eater, I’m risking my life. If I’m with you, I’m risking my life too. It was
“Right…” he nodded, turning back to the board.
Harry looked over at him, confused. “You haven’t kept in touch with anyone?”
“I’m not doing this right now,” Harry said, pocketing his wand and turning to leave.
“Right, let’s go!”
“Just go away,” Draco snapped. “You would never understand. You won’t be able to help.” Draco clenched his jaw, looking away from Harry, clenching his fists as he tried to ease his anger; his frustration; his feelings. “You weren’t raised by abusive people.”
“Um… I suppose since the end of sixth year,” she said, looking down at her feet. “We didn’t say anything because we were afraid it might interfere with your relationship. Soulmates aren’t exactly something that should be forced.”
“Er… I’m not sure if that’s a good idea,” he said, pulling away from her, pulling up the sleeves of his sweater. She eyed him, and he wondered if it was a look of judgement or something else.
“Take your own! Luna gave us plenty,” she rolled her eyes, sitting down beside him, taking another bite. “I didn’t expect her cake to be so big.”
Draco returned to the Slytherin Common Room, flopping down beside Pansy. “Exhausted.”
“Pansy,” he smiled awkwardly, “why is the seat beside me free?”
“I love him,” Harry said in a firm tone, “and
“Being worth the risk and trust are two different things,” Harry mumbled, but he knew it was wrong of him. His paranoia and fear was getting the better of him.
The bottle landed on Draco. This time, Draco was quick to stand up, running to the dorm. Harry was close behind him. As he entered, Draco grabbed his hand and slammed the door shut, pushing him against the wall right beside the door.
“Trust me, Potter, I really wouldn’t come to you for anything if I had a choice,” he rolled his eyes. “Don’t think you’re some bigshot or something.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey, Harry,” he looked up. “When do you reckon our anniversary is?”
“Harry,” Hermione said after a few minutes.
have something to lose?”
“Oh, yes I do,” said Dumbledore. “You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been…”
“I don’t know… I guess seeing him was more overwhelming that I thought it would be,” he muttered, turning to his reflection, staring at the streak in his hair that was starting to turn darker.
“You’re going to think I’m pathetic,” Draco shook his head, looking away.
“Coming in?” The Fat Lady asked.
“Wait, Draco!” But before Harry could even finish his sentence, Draco had already left and he was long gone by the time Harry got out of the broom closet. Harry sighed. He knew that something was definitely up with Draco.
“That’s great,” Harry said to Ginny. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances. “Oh, er… I mean… if you’re unhappy then sure.” Harry nudged Hermione, implying that he didn’t know how to give her advice. Hermione rolled her eyes and started whispering to Ginny, trying to give her advice.
Rage grew in his chest. It was so easy for her to say that. She didn’t understand what it was like to be in love with someone who’s supposed to kill you. He opened his mouth to say that, then stopped himself. Hermione should’ve been in hiding, given that she was a Muggle-born and in danger, yet here she was. He had to cut her some slack.
She knew how much Draco honestly hated being referred to as Malfoy, but she would call him this on certain occasions when she felt he was being too soft, or when he needed reminding that he was a Malfoy. This had been mainly during times when they were with family.
“...it’s fine, I’ll help you,” the blond said finally, walking over and sitting beside him. “It was an essay on the stupid potion we mucked up… er… Draught of Peace, was it? Yeah, that. He set that last week, you know.”
“Is what I’ve been saying for the past ten minutes!”
“Fair point,” he nodded, ripping out the page from his notebook, pocketing it. “I can’t study anymore. I’ll see you next friday. Thanks.”
“Er…”
“Another letter, huh?” Ron said as he sidled up beside Harry, grabbing the letter from his hands. His eyes lit up as he read the first few lines of the poem, almost as if he was excited. “I get lost in-”
“Hey, he broke my heart first!”
“You are on Lord Voldemort’s side, this isn’t a game, Draco.”
“I wasn’t expecting it,” Draco said finally, sighing in defeat. “I just…”
“Draco,” she said, narrowing her eyes. He slowly looked over at her, fearful. “Do you have a crush on a boy?”
“And… you do understand none of it is your fault, too?”
A confused Harry mouthed ‘What?’ to Draco as Narcissa pulled him into a hug, before pulling away and starting to rant.
“So,” she sat back in her seat. “You want to be with him? What’s stopping you?”
“Oh, he’s well. He’s taking today off but he said he’ll be here for dinner.”
He stared at his father fearfully. “I… I don’t want to hurt anyone.” Especially not Harry.
“No, Harry, you don’t understand. I can’t stand to hurt you like this. I can’t stand to see
Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, mildly horrified but also very confused at what was going on. Pansy, in the background, pursed her lips, deciding it was best if she kept her mouth shut.
Harry was caught off guard. “What?” was all he could get out.
“I know.” Draco started to stroke Harry’s messy hair.
“Harry, don’t,” Draco said in a tone that Harry knew all too well. Harry bit his lip, frowning as he stared at Draco.
Harry and Draco kept in their laughter until they reached a corner where no one was.
“This isn’t much-”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, scratching the back of his neck, “losing a friend can do that to you.”
“Shut up,” Draco whispered, swiftly placing his lips on Harry’s, kissing him roughly and with passion. Of course, Harry kissed him right back, his tongue dancing in the other’s mouth, shutting his eyes and wrapping his arms around the blond’s neck.
Then he dragged Draco into a closet and they had a heated make-out session. Harry pulled at Draco’s collar and even bit at his neck.
Two weeks passed. Things were changing, perhaps for the better. Harry was smiling more, despite the nightmares and visions. The end of their one month was near, yet neither of them had brought it up. They would meet every Friday and Saturday. Fridays consisted of actual work whereas on Saturdays, both of them would find it hard to focus and end up doing something else.
“Are you comparing me kissing someone to you working for someone who’s trying to kill me?”
Harry looked around the Great Hall, making eye contact with Pansy who bit her lip and stared back at him with a grave look on her face.
“I still feel like I just imagined it,” Draco said, astonished. “Come here for a second?”
Y'all, I don't know what I wanted this chapter to be, but I certainly didn't see this coming!!
“You better not,” he quickly pocketed the paper after scanning through it. “I’m not too interested myself, so…”
“Harry,” Draco sighed. “You don’t trust me. I don’t know how we can go forward. Maybe it’s better if we break up. I don’t want to waste my time on you anymore. What I’m really mad about is that…
“I think you sort of know,” Hermione told her with a sigh.
“Just as I thought! There’s no way in hell I can come.”
“I do suggest that you break up with him before I have to take matters into my own hands, Potter,” Lucius said, “And I really know that you’re smart. So make the right decision.”
“Really? So I shouldn’t avoid him as well as my feelings?”
Harry turned and when he made eye contact with one of the owls, all three came flying to him, each having a paper with them. The owls dropped the letters in his hands and went back to the table, patiently waiting for Harry to tell them something or give them a letter back.

“You have a choice here,” she said.
“Bloody hell, I didn’t know that we were so popular!” Ron said - rather excitedly - as he sat down beside Hermione, practically grinning from ear to ear. Harry was sitting opposite them, awkward playing with his hands when Ron and Hermione started holding hands and starting to converse with each other quietly.
Draco tapped him gently, and Harry opened his eyes. “Are you cold?” he asked. “We… can go somewhere else.” Despite what he was saying, he was slowly moving his hands down to Harry’s trousers, who held back a moan. “Hey, are you sure about this?”
“Thank you, Harry. You have no idea how much this… means to me.”
Harry entered his dorm, Draco close behind him. Harry shut the door behind Draco. There was only one lamp on, which was on the other side of the room. It definitely set the mood.
“But that’s what’s normal to me. You being Malfoy, an absolute prick, trying to find new ways to get under my skin. I agree, the hearing aids were too far, and I’m really glad we were able to move past all of that and become friends.”
He took Harry’s hand carefully, pursing his lips for a moment. “Always on your side. Always, love. This is just something I have to do to survive,” he said quietly, as if he was afraid anyone else would hear him. “And I hate every moment of it.”
” Harry shouted, pointing his wand directly at Draco.
And with that, Harry kissed him with everything he had in him.
Hermione smiled. “Always so overdramatic,” she said with an eye roll. “Besides, something tells me that it’s not over between you two.”
“I’m being serious.” Harry told him. He then cupped Draco’s face with his hands, biting his lip.
They reached their usual grass area, but this time there was a huge white tent put up. Draco’s eyes widened an all Harry did was smile.
“It’s the first thing I could think of that would help you achieve some temporary happiness.”
“Why didn’t you just tell me we were soulmates from the beginning?” Harry asked. “Why didn’t you just tell me about the stupid curse?” he lightly smacked Draco on the chest. “I think I’m still in love with you. I know you’re married to Astoria, but-”
“Breathe again?” Harry finished before he could stop himself.
The letter wasn’t long, but Harry wondered why it hurt him so much to read it. Maybe it was because it was so short. Hand trembling slightly, he chewed anxiously on his lip, looking over to the owl that seemed to be waiting for some sort of letter back.
“Let me try to understand-”
“Shall we go back to our dorms?” Draco asked, yawning slightly. “It’s still pretty early, but we should probably use your Invisibility Cloak. I’m not in the mood to get swarmed by people with questions about our relationship.”
Draco pushed him to the floor, and a huge gasp came from everyone that was watching. Blaise fell against a table then onto the floor. For a moment, it seemed as if he wasn’t going to get back up, but he stood up quickly, punching Draco in the face.
“Come on, Harry, it’s two in the-” Hermione stood in the doorway. Her hair was disheveled and her clothes were crumpled. She paused. “What in the
“So, dating yet?”
“Then don’t,” he urged. “Be with me. One month.”
“Blondie, I can be anything you like.”
Harry eventually noticed when Draco started poking at his arm, constantly swiping his finger across it.
“There’s Potter,” Blaise spat. “He’s been doing spells again, even pronouncing it properly. I wonder if that Mudblood has been teaching him that.”
“It’s okay,” he shook his head. “I understand the pressure you must be feeling right now. But, darling, you know the rule is there for a reason.”
“I’m not letting you leave,” said Hermione firmly, starting to glare back at Harry. “You are in no state to-”
The first Friday of November was a little different.
“It’s the middle of summer. You can’t be wearing that. You’d die from heat exhaustion,” Harry looked at him, tilting his head. “Come on.”
thing in the world.”
“I need to clear my head.”
“Does that make you mad?” Harry asked carefully, taking his books out of his bags again so he had an excuse to avoid his gaze. “To see her making out with guys?”
Harry nodded, sitting on the bed stiffly, watching his best friend leave the room, only to hear some muffled noises outside. “Malfoy, don’t go inside. Seriously! Can’t you see that you’re hurting him?”
“I don’t think I forget if I wanted to,” he said, leaning closer to Draco again. “...could we try doing that again sometime, if you enjoyed it? Because I know I certainly did.”
Draco took in a deep breath. “Y-you could say that, yeah.”
“I heard what you said. Just wanted to see how you would lie about it.” Draco replied, running a hand through his hair, which wasn’t gelled up for once. Harry rolled his eyes at what Draco said.
“Oh, whatever. She won’t mind.”
But was that true? Harry wondered how different things would be if he accepted his friendship on his first day at Hogwarts. Well, he certainly wouldn't be friends with Hermione or Ron, and that in itself sounded like a nightmare.
He actually felt fine for once. Everything in his life seemed to be balanced, and he was pretty happy about it. He had Ron and Hermione, he had Draco. For once, he didn’t feel as if anything was wrong in his life.
“Okay,” Draco was too busy staring into Harry’s green eyes, feeling his warm hands against his skin.
“I’m just worried!”
Harry slowly took a step towards Lucius, glaring at him. There was no way to express how much Harry wanted to hex him or cast a spell on him. But he controlled himself. “Oh, sir, I really am making the right decision.”

Draco put it on for Harry, who was struggling. The only light source was the moonlight from the window and the lamp on the desk a bit further away from them. Harry turned his wrist, smiling. “Thank you, Draco.”
“Hey Harry,” Ginny greeted him loudly from beside Hermione.
“I am,” Lucius said as he stood up from his seat, and left.
“Draco, it’s scorching,” she stated, but her expression softened when she noticed the look on his face. “Anyway, did you read the Daily Prophet?”
“Well, I think it looks lovely on you, not embarrassing.”
“Much better,” Harry replied, grinning right back. “I can see your beautiful face now.” Draco scoffed but didn’t say anything, secretly enjoying the compliment. He shut his book and stretched his arms before slowly getting out of the bed.
“I’m sure he’ll forgive you,” Draco said after many moments of silence. “Till then, let’s get you to bed, shall we?”
“Because,” he looked down in embarrassment, biting his lip, “maybe if you forgot, things don’t have to change again.”
“Harry, what was that all about?” Hermione asked as they walked to their next class, which was Potions, which they had with the Slytherins too.
“How did it go?” Pansy asked as Draco entered his room, jumping. “I told you I’d come over. Why so surprised?”
He reached the couch and sat on the ground just in front of Draco’s face, who rolled his eyes. “I’m going to meet my relative tomorrow, dumbass. I need to make sure I know everything.”
“Always.”
“Oh, alright… I understand.” Harry muttered quietly.
“Draco, do you want some of Hermione’s foundation and concealer again? I can give it to you, you know. Hermione won’t mind - hopefully.” Harry told Draco gently, shutting his book.
As Harry, Ron and Hermione, made their way to their next class, she seemed rather upset. “You know, you could’ve asked us how to pronounce the spell,” she said as they walked.
“Funny… funny, yes,” he nodded, waiting for her to leave before taking out the book Snape had given him from his closet, grunting in frustration when the book refused to open. “Seriously?
“Anyways, I hinted that we would have a second date and he said that maybe we would dance on the second date. I said I hated dancing and he told me that we should try out dancing for the next date. So, we slowed dance.” Draco ranted. It felt good to talk about it to Pansy, he had kept in the feeling of excitement he got every time he thought of Harry and now he could let it out.
Harry avoided Hermione’s sympathetic gaze. It was uncomfortable and disheartening. He glanced over to the Slytherin table behind him. He made eye contact with Pansy, who seemed to be moping, and Draco, beside her, was staring down at his full plate of food, unable to even pick up the fork.
Harry looked at her, trying to hide his surprise. Though before the conversation could go further, Hermione slammed her hands on the desk, glaring at Pansy, who just smiled coolly back at her.
“Um… it’s hard to say.”
She gave him a sarcastic smile. “Witty. As I was saying, are you sure it’s a good idea to go searching for the Horcruxes?” she asked, her expression suddenly turning serious.
“I feel like you’re being a bit short with me,” she told him.
As winter break began and ended, time that had been slipping away finally started to slow down, but not for the right reasons. Draco was busy with ‘work’ he had been assigned for ‘extra credit’, so Harry spent most of his time in the Gryffindor Common Room. It was nearing the end of January. He thought about this time last year - they were still trying to figure out their feelings.
He loved it so much. Harry was so grateful to have someone as beautiful as Draco. And he didn’t mean on the outside (Draco was very attractive on the outside too). Harry meant Draco’s kind heart. The cold exterior that Draco had put up all those years had finally been broken, and Harry felt so happy about it.
It was a peaceful night. The two were in silence, but in a comfortable silence. After they finished their work, they gathered their stuff and went to the Room of Requirement. The two were already in their pajamas as they got into the large bed that the RoR had conjured up for them, cuddling up close together and falling asleep.
Draco, who was staring down at the floor, slowly looked up at Harry, a dark look on his face.
Harry was a bit behind in the crowd, listening to Hermione and Ron who were beside him, arguing about the homework’s answers. For once, everyone was on time (which annoyed Snape - taking points from a house that’s not Slytherin was the joy of his day, especially taking points from Gryffindor).
Harry simply nodded reluctantly, and they sat there, both their eyes on the fire but both of their minds wandering in different directions.
“Be enemies? We only ended up this way because of you. If you’re done with your sob story, I’m leaving.”
“Not sure… we didn’t exactly tell him you’d be coming, so…” Hermione admitted.
“Harry, answer me.”
“No, yeah, I’m so deprived, aren’t I? I didn’t have a proper childhood. And, let’s face it, I have no proper family either. So, really, I’m-”
He could see that his face had taken a more green shade, and his demeanor was thin and fragile.
“That would be more ideal than the situation I’m in right now,” he slipped before he could stop himself. To his surprise, Draco actually laughed out loud.
The practice went well; apart from Harry making a few mistakes here and there. The team forgave him for it; after all, Harry had taken a long break from Quidditch. Everyone went into the Changing Room after practice.
They let the whole disc play, dancing erratically and basically jumping about. There was something that made it so easy to be around Draco, something Harry had not even recently felt with Hermione or Ron. They were his best friends, but it was different with Draco. He was putting conscious effort for Harry, despite the asshole he had been.
“I think it’s very obvious,” said Narcissa. Draco turned to look at his mother. Had Snape told her about Harry? “Send a letter to whoever’s on your mind.”
“Just showing house unity, Ron,” Harry said in a blank tone, not looking up from his book.
“Mate, you call your other Saturdays interesting? For the past three months, you’ve been ditching ‘Mione and me to go study. You call that interesting?” Ron asked with a raised eyebrow. Hermione gave Harry a look as if to say ‘wow, that’s the best you can come up with?’.
This is a short chapter, but I just wanted to post this so you know I'm not dead and I'm actually writing lol.
“A Christmas present,” he replied. “I wanted to thank you for everything.”
“Alright. I’ll go down and tell everyone you’re feeling better,” Ron said, standing up.
“So, send them a letter,” Narcissa said with a small smile. “If not for you, do it for them.”
“Love?!” Harry exclaimed, receiving a few looks from fellow Gryffindors that were within hearing distance.
“It is,” Draco said, his eyes on Harry.
To feel each other’s warmth.
“I love being Draco with you,” he said softly. “Just Draco. Not Malfoy, not a family full of Death Eaters, not a follower. I love being your boyfriend.”
“What?” he asked, and the two shook their heads.
“Is this your bed?” Harry asked, pointing to one of the beds that was by the bathroom. Draco nodded. “So you can hog the bathroom first, I reckon.” Harry teased and sat down. He saw the jar that Harry had given him that day in the bathroom almost empty. “Draco, how many times have you used this?” He asked, picking up the jar and looking at it.
“No, the part where you said you were mine.”
Draco rolled his eyes and took the basket from Harry. “How long has your arm been hurting for? Why didn’t you tell me?”
Draco’s silver eyes stared into Harry’s green ones as they sat in silence for a few moments.
Silence. All Harry heard was silence. Everyone else was at dinner.
“Draco… I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything-”
“He’s right there! Why don’t we just hand him over?” One of the Slytherins shouted. All of a sudden, the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws stood in front of Harry, facing the Slytherins. Pansy quickly stood up and joined them, slowly going to stand beside Harry.
Harry, who was still taken aback, gulped, then turned back to his textbook. “Um, right… seven drops of hellebore.”
The morning went by roughly. Harry kept his mind on the poem, and as beautiful it was, it bothered him. Who was the poem about?
“Draco?” said a familiar voice. He looked up, surprised to see Molly Weasley in front of him, smiling. “My God, I haven’t seen you since the wedding!” she put her arms out, and he laughed nervously, standing up. She pulled him into a warm hug, which he didn’t realize he had needed until she pulled away.
“No, it should be my treat.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
“Harry, what’s wrong?” Hermione asked when she noticed him putting a hand to his left cheek, frowning deeply. Hermione raised an eyebrow when he didn’t respond, exchanging glances with Ron.
YALLL this chapter!!!
“Oh, I’m fucking sorry, have I upset you? I thought you were the one to bring up the fact that I have no parents.” Harry replied, blinking innocently as he shot daggers with his eyes.
Warmth. That’s what it felt like. Pure warmth.
“How have you been?” he asked as he sat down beside Draco, deciding it was probably time to stop beating around the bush.
“You’re a sweetheart, Astoria. Oh, and Harry came!” Pansy said, looking past Draco. He turned around, putting a hand to his hair as he did, heart dropping when he realized she was right. Much to his surprise, he was laughing and talking with Luna, Neville, Hermione and Ron. “You okay, honey?”
And while everything else was uncertain, this was the only thing he could say he was sure of. Trusting Draco with his life.
“Then stay,” he cried softly. “Stay. We’ll figure it out. We always do. You could hide from them. You could stay.”
When Friday finally came along, Draco was behaving normally. Had he forgotten? No, he couldn’t have. Their one month deal was clear. He sat down across from Harry, the two silent as they did their own work. Draco now sometimes also did homework with Harry.
Draco stood still, looking anywhere but into Harry’s eyes, then finally spoke. He wanted badly to say yes, but his brain was telling him to think logically. “What if we find that it’s not worth the risk?”
“You came,” Draco repeated after Pansy, his trembling hands enveloping Harry, as if he couldn’t believe it. “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry. I left so awfully. I… fuck. I don’t know what to say. I understand if you’re cross.”
What if Draco was in trouble?
“Harry, I made breakfast.”

Harry was surprised. “What? Why? We’ve been spending every Saturday like this! I haven’t spent a single Saturday on my own for the past three months!”
“I don’t think that at all,” Harry took his hand carefully. Draco pulled away, but after a moment, he reached back. “We have our own battles to fight. I just want you to know that transparency would probably do us good.”
“What’s he mad about this time?” Someone asked behind them. Harry turned and grinned when he saw it was Pansy, who grinned back. She immediately caught up to Harry and started walking beside him.
They made their way to the Great Hall. Harry avoided looking at the Slytherin table at costs. If he saw Draco, he was unsure what he would do. It was better if he simply avoided him because what he knew was that the cold, empty look in Draco’s eyes would be too much to bear.
“So she should maybe ask you for advice?” Harry asked reasonably. “I can’t give advice for my life! Especially dating advice!”
“I should have said it sooner. I should have told you.” Harry said, using one of his hands to stroke Draco’s cheek. Draco adjusted his legs and held onto Harry tighter. “I can’t believe I didn’t tell you that I love you sooner.”
“Er…. yeah, maybe,” Draco stuttered, moving away from Harry who attempted to touch his hair. “Listen, I know you’re probably super tempted to touch me, but we have to stay apart.”
,” He whispered, before slowly turning away from the Boggart.
“Draco,” she took his hands carefully. “I’m trying my best to protect you, alright? I know this is hardly what you want, that’s why I think it’s best if you go back to Hogwarts. It’s just your last year.”
This Friday evening, they both had made it, but had barely uttered a word to each other the entire night. Their session was coming to an end. Harry studied Draco, who was beside him - he barely put gel in his hair anymore, despite constantly telling him that he would put gel in his hair because he liked it that way. He had dark circles under his eyes and his body seemed fragile.
“Please, let’s just leave it at that,” Harry whispered in a hoarse voice with a whimper. Draco nodded. Harry leaned forward, and softly placed his lips on Draco’s, kissing him softly, gently, with love and with pain.
“It’s the middle of winter, Harry. Everyone’s inside in their Common Rooms. We’re actually crazy to be out here when it’s this cold.”
“Hey, Malfoy, still a pain in the ass?” Harry retorted.
He pounced on Draco, wrapping his legs around the other’s waist as tears were starting to spill down his cheeks, burying his face into his neck. Draco, startled,
“Can’t believe I’m doing this,” Draco muttered. Harry’s lips twitched in amusement but he tried to hide it. “I just need your help for a few months. My relative… he’s deaf, so my father wants me to learn WSL so I can communicate with him.”
“Just a tad.”

Harry’s heart was beating so fast, so quick.
“I know you’re there,” Draco spoke in a low, quiet, voice. He sounded different. Harry sighed, taking off the Invisibility Cloak. Draco was still staring at the ceiling. He refused to look at Harry.
“I don’t know,” he answered finally, running a hand through his messy hair. “Just trying to adjust to this change.”
“Another letter…” Hermione stared at the owl that flew on Harry’s shoulder this time, parchment paper attached to it. “Er… Harry, do you have a girlfriend?”

“I haven’t got any options…” Draco was mumbling. “I’ve got to do it. He’s going to kill me… He’s going to kill my family.”
After a while of idle chatter, it was time for dinner. Ron and Hermione sat beside each other at one corner, and Draco and Pansy sat across. Beside Hermione was Luna. But there was a seat free beside Draco, which was at the corner of the table.
Draco figured that Harry still blamed himself for what happened. Maybe it was wrong of him to hide the scars for so long; it was bound to take a toll on Harry since he had moved past it.
“Draco, if we are the ones who hand over Potter to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven,” said Lucius, before pushing Draco forwards towards the boy who was kneeling, his deformed face making him unrecognizable.
Harry stared at him for a few seconds. “What subject? Do you need help?”
thank you,
Enjoy the chapter!
They stayed that way for the rest of the night.
Without missing a beat, Harry answered. “All the time.”
“No. It’s bigger than that. You don’t fucking trust that when it comes to the Dark Lord, I’d be able to keep my mouth shut about you. Do you think I’m reporting everything to my father or something?”
“Do you still have feelings for him?”
“Gee, thanks, Weasley,” Draco replied with an eye roll but nodded slightly. “But Harry, I want you to meet my parents too.”
have thought he’d be able to keep Harry second? Harry was first, always. Even when he hadn’t realized it.
“Uh… what did we have to do again?” Harry asked embarrassedly. Hermione rolled her eyes and got out a plain piece of paper, starting to explain the assignment to Harry. But something caught Harry’s eye when he looked at his textbook.
“Here I am, my darling.” Draco teased back. The two started off into the forest. Harry took Draco’s hand and stared at it for a few seconds before looking back up.
“No buts. You’ve made your decision, and you should accept that it’s over. I know it’ll be hard, but he’s married now. I know this isn’t what you want to hear, but…” she trailed off into silence, then sighed, putting her arms around both of them. “You’ll be okay, Harry.”

Harry had said everything way too fast, way too quickly for anyone to even comprehend it. But he smiled slightly, feeling as if a small weight had been lifted off of his shoulders. Hermione, looking as confused as ever, took a few seconds to even realize he had stopped talking. She cleared her throat.
Draco, who was seated at the front of the class, was still finding it hard to process what just happened.
“You’re being ridiculous…”
He wasn’t.
Harry practically ran to Draco who was crying so hard, unable to breathe.
Seeing the disappointed look on Harry’s face only made Draco feel worse.
Draco was still smiling, though. Draco gave Harry a quick kiss on the lips before settling down on the couch and resting his head on his lap. Harry pulled out a blanket from his back and put it over Draco.
“Don’t. If we can’t even speak, we should probably give up on trying to help each other,” Draco said, then repeated what he was saying before, only slower and signing with whatever words he knew. “Got it? Okay, now just get ready as if you’re doing a spell you already know.”
Draco gulped. “I’m glad you like it,” he said, his expression somewhat panicked, unsure of what to do.
“For the last time, Malfoy,” Harry wasn’t the best at lip reading, but he could make do when all that came out of Draco’s mouth was the same bullshit. He shoved him backwards, “I’m
have a secret girlfriend.” Hermione replied. “We just have to figure out who…”
“Oh, Harry, you made it!” said Molly, pulling him into a tight hug. “How are you, love?”
“You’re right,” Draco admitted, getting out the picnic blanket and spreading it over the grass and sitting down, “you are too cute. Plus, you know what they say, don’t leave kids alone in forests.”
“Harry.” Draco practically growled in a low voice.
Draco signed slowly, hands trembling slightly, and he noticed that Harry smiled for probably the first time that day. “I can’t tell if I’m a horrible teacher or you’re a terrible learner.”
Realizing he was being serious, she nodded, her smile fading. She looked over to the fireplace in front of them, soaking up the heat as she watched her best friend at a loss for words. This was a first. No matter whatever happened - being turned into a ferret, Cedric’s death, Harry Potter opening the chamber of secrets, whatever it was; there was never an instance Draco couldn’t put what he was feeling into words. Unless, of course, this was a new emotion he was feeling...
“Yeah, yeah, sorry,” she dusted her hands off and took the glass back from him. “Hey, where’s the trio?”
“Really?” he asked, his voice trembling slightly as he held onto her, “because… I feel like I’ve known for a while. I just… put it away. Avoided it.”
Harry bit his lip. “But-”
“You two are like children,” Harry sighed as Hermione left. “Is that how you and I were too?”
“It wasn’t my choice. Besides, I thought since you’re soulmates, you two would be able to work things out.”
“I’m sure it’s fine, Potter,” he shook his head. The two stared at each other, unsure, then peeked into the cauldron to look at the potion, which exploded in their faces. Liquid went everywhere and everyone in the room looked up, surprised by the noise.
“What happened to, ‘the last seven years of my life have been way too eventful. I’m going to live a quiet life from now on’?” Ron questioned, chuckling.
“What the hell was that?” Draco asked, still confused.
He gulped. “Okay. One last time.”
“Um… no,” he replied.
“Later,” he sighed. “I know she’s going to ask me a billion questions if I tell her. I need to prepare for that kind of thing.”
“Draco, the only thing you should focus on right now is thinking of what to get for lunch.”
,” he snapped, his tone harsh.
also thank you for 200 kudos! also (i write this on a doc before uploading it on here) this fanfic reached 200 pages lmao, so happy 200 <3
“But Harry, we haven’t even had dinner yet,” Ron started, but Harry looked away, shrugging as he left for the boys’ dormitories. He exchanged glances with Hermione, who looked just as concerned as he did.
Draco just smiled in return. “Okay, so there are two more here. I thought you might like the simple colors: green, black and red.” Draco explained. Harry was wearing the black set currently. “The green and red one don’t have my initials, so it might be better if you wear those. Don’t want your nosy friends asking questions. Well since Granger already knows you can tell her.” Draco was talking very quickly. He seemed to be very into what he was saying. Harry was listening to every word carefully. The two sat down on Harry’s bed, where the box currently was. They both turned to face the box as Draco continued speaking.
Most nights spent together were now silent. Harry didn’t have to explain that he was having a bad day. He would usually take his hearing aids out when he was feeling down, keeping to himself or leaning on Draco, who didn’t mind. What mattered to both of them was the time being spent together
