He let her take Victoire, noticing Molly watching him from the kitchen. Howlers on the mind, he shoved a forkful of roast into his mouth.
“Masons,” Ron interjected. “One of my muggle Uncles was a Mason. But I’ve never heard of a wizard being part of all that.”
“Hermione was curious about a book she thinks you may have.” He held out the decoy paper. Draco took a step forward, plucking it away and reading the title. “And you should know by now that ‘curious’ for her is anyone else’s ‘obsessed’.”
“And I’ve never known you to take a day off. Not since becoming Head Auror. And if you weren’t at work you were with Teddy, and if you weren’t with Teddy...well, I don’t even know.”
“Marcomannic,” she stated. “A rune alphabet. Most Pensieves use Saxon…standard use, storing and viewing. Futhark for things like prophesies…but Marcomannic is…”
“You can’t go in there. It’s cursed,” the stranger said tersely. Panicked. Afraid. His lit wand waved around a bit. Some of the worst cold went away. When he leaned in, his breath was sweet. Minty. “Listen to me, Potter. They’re going to think I did this to you. You
“Mr. Weasley,” McGonagall said, so sharply that Harry jumped. Ron looked stuck in headlights, all signs of Head Aurorship blinking away under her ire. “I assure you, nothing will happen to Potter should he leave your sight.”
“I reckon Ron rather fancies being in charge.” And there was nothing in the world he'd rather do than spend time with Teddy right now. Especially poring over dusty parchment. He gestured to the door. “Maybe you and Reena could give me a tour?”
“Ten.” She groaned, pushing up in to a sitting position and pinching the bridge of her nose. “Pub night?”
“How’s the semester going?” Seamus asked, stuck between respectful and cowering. They were meant to be trained professionals, Harry thought uncharitably.
“Hey,” Ron said, probably surprised to see him. No one had asked him to come in, after all. “What’s going on?”
There was more, but he stopped reading. It felt like an intrusion. These words were meant for someone else.
“The hallway,” he realized. All those people had seen the two of them arguing. Well, they had seen Harry being argued at.
So he stopped, listening intently without knowing why. Calling out for help would have made more sense, but he didn’t. It felt…dangerous. Someone must have done this to him, and left him there.
Ginny looked a little startled at that. He hastened to apologize – he hadn’t meant to be so suggestive, but she broke into a wide smile, shaking her head.
A name Harry hadn’t heard yet. Maybe Sirius’ brother? There was a family tapestry in the drawing room he had yet to look at.
Harry told Ron and Hermione about the letter as they went back toward the pitch. “I mean, what sort of thing would I have asked him for?”
Castor swayed at his full height, nearly three feet off the ground and waist-high with a terrified Draco Malfoy. “
“I promise.” He read the little page of instructions. It was round and ridged all over for a snake to curl up on it. When he tapped his wand and muttered the incantation, it grew to the right size and emitted a faint heat. He put it between the fireplace and a chair.
And it wasn’t solid. A spindly sort of cage wrapped around a small, hourglass shaped bauble. If he squinted, he could see a shifting substance inside the gold, like it was hollow. Hermione pulled it away when he tried to get a closer look.
By some miracle, he didn’t argue. Harry went about starting a kettle and finishing the soup, pushing Castor’s face away from the steam every few seconds. “What was it?”
“Arthurian magic,” Seamus said doubtfully. He looked to Élise. “Don’t they teach that rubbish at Beauxbatons?”
Harry replaced Castor in the sitting room, instructed him to stay put, and sat across from Draco with his food. He was watched with dark, confused eyes as he took his first bite. Too late to wish he’d cooked something less pungent.
” he answered without hesitation. Harry blinked, and then laughed, which made him blush. “And a Bordeaux, if they have it.”
Ron looked like he might laugh. “You’re all set, trust me. I think he’d like something from George’s shop, though.”
If Harry Potter was a politician, Hermione Granger was all of Parliament. And he was more useful to her as the Head Auror, someone to put her head together with. Though he couldn’t imagine he was ever as brilliant as her, it was undeniable his reach. His influence.
“They’re family,” Ron confirmed. The slightly chagrined two words that didn’t need the ‘our’ in between. They were Harry’s family, too.
“That’s my son,” Harry said, standing in the entry way. Draco set the frame down very quickly, on the edge of the table where he’d found it.
, actually. It was somewhere between a glide and a strut. Deep emerald robes started at his neck and swayed to the floor, making his skin seem all the more startlingly pale. White-blond hair was slicked back elegantly from his face, strong jaw and pale eyes on full display. Harry thought he remembered stubble, from that night, and a certain disarray to his hair. Those were both gone.
“I appreciate it, though. It’s sweet.” Her head touched on his shoulder for a moment. “You always went at each other in school. It was plenty deserved, don’t get me wrong, but I think he was just now rather shocked at what you suggested.”
“I mean, it’s problematic,” Draco said. “Centaurs aren’t beasts, like this story implies. Times have changed.”
“I’ll leave early,” Harry offered. Ron was technically doing both Harry’s work and his own to keep up the appearance that Harry was still Head Auror, and his relative niceness to Draco the day before had Harry thinking the stress was getting to him. Besides, it was nice to have something important to see to. “Me and Hermione’ll check it out before he gets there. Make sure nothing too important got left behind by the Order.”
“Yes, yes, he did mention this to me.” She waved her wand, saying something in smooth French that had a file detaching itself from a cabinet and floating into Harry’s hands. “Zis is your information.”
The third was a couple. He didn’t recognize them, but he knew exactly who they were. The man looked like him, and the woman had bright green eyes.
“I think they’re gone now,” Luna said a while later, standing on the topmost bench to look down at where a crowd had been gathered, waiting for Harry. The hat looked utterly out of place on her. “Or they’ve hidden. I didn’t bring my Spectrespecs.”
– or had trick steps that vanished underfoot. Teddy did his best to tell him about these things just before they happened, but it was rarely quick enough.
He crept downstairs, pulling his jacket hood up over his loose hair. The humidity made it curl over his cheeks in fluffy, obnoxious tangles. Rain pattered down on the front stoop, where he paused, watching. Draco was wearing a cloak with the hood down, an Umbrella Charm deflecting the worst of the rain. It was a little hard to believe he couldn’t see Harry standing just across the pavement.
“Fine. Just fine.” George pushed the box toward him and examined the pile of explosives with intent. Harry wondered just how much of that – if not all – would make its way to Teddy anyway. “You’d better get going before Lee comes back out here. He’ll ask you about Dolohov.”
“Aurors,” a thin, waifish young woman stood to greet them. Harry looked at the scarf that covered her head and draped down her shoulders. The fabric was a lively coral, embroidered in gold patterns, the dress underneath a deep teal that made her golden skin glow.
The title of this chapter comes from a famous treatise dating back to original scholarly interest in runic alphabets, Marcomannic in particular is said to be used by the "Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus" (Translation: 'Marcomanni, whom we call Northmen'). The treatise appears to be referring to German speakers, whose letters "signify their incantations and divinations, because they are still given to pagan practices".
“Quidditch announcer,” he said, totally at ease. Harry nearly wondered if George had told him after all, he was taking it so well. “This is the last Friday I’ll have off for nearly the entire year.”
Ron prodded him in the chest, eyes bright with excitement. “Come on. They’ll eat up anything you say.”
“In the meantime…” She patted Teddy’s hand and looked between Harry and Ron. “Draco Malfoy is no fool. Treating him as such would be unwise.”
“Is that – ?” He stopped himself, about to ask if that was safe. Clearly, it wasn’t. He saw a group of students in matching green scarves come to a quick halt at the top of it, turning for another as it rotated over to the landing. Fuck – surely there was at least one blind student?
“I know,” Harry murmured. And he actually did – he had read some of that book Draco had given him. He just didn’t know it was
Draco let go of him. Harry could actually see the grass move as it was crushed under his invisible feet. “This way,” he said, and appeared with a flourish. The cloak shimmered into view as he held it away from his body, toward Harry. It had messed up his hair.
“Ah. The Weezly shop, then.” She stood and conjured a steaming cup of tea. “I will have Rocklor fetch it from your vault.”
The sounds of the open air market over the wall behind them were considerably dulled by the many muggle-repelling charms, and completely gone as they entered the shielded entrance to the underground tunnels. Icy air billowed out at them as they walked, and Harry was sufficiently creeped out by the dark damp and glistening walls by the time it all shimmered and became a very chilly, high-ceilinged library.
Just as he was considering lying on the wet ground and giving up, the hair on the back of his neck stood up.
He countered that with a re-cap of the (fortunately less gruesome) Hogwarts game. She gasped at all the right places, sitting up in attention. Her eyes went wide every time she smiled, hands sweeping through her hair or winding together under her knees. Ginny was comforting. Ginny was like…a well-placed fern. She brought the whole room together.
That was why, Harry realized much too late. George was absent that night, and so everyone else had free reign to talk about things they never would while he was there.
The smell of food had been spreading through the flat as they spoke, and Harry tried not to run when Hermione called for them to come eat. He was
“Thanks,” he said, unsurprised but touched all the same. Warmth couldn’t fly straight through the top of his head anymore. “Better.”
“I can’t be certain. Maybe.” He sounded half-strangled. Rattled. It wasn’t just the snake he was scared of.
It was bad enough she kept pressuring him into this conversation – he could never see when it was coming. “I – I already have!”
“Hm,” Harry hummed doubtfully, going on with the rest. Ron’s smile dropped away when he mentioned knowing Todrick’s name.
“Wait…” Harry tried, reaching. The last thing he heard were the sounds of a scuffle. Someone was hit.
“If you don’t…erm, you know, then you’ll get to see Hogwarts for the first time, yeah? It’ll be great.”
Draco was the first to lower his wand. Harry quickly did the same. “What do you call this? Come to kill me in my sleep?”
Draco started to shake his head, then went frustratingly blank. It was a well-practiced sort of blankness, borne of years and years of hard work. He held out his hand, and Harry tossed the wand through the air. He caught it easily, using it to pull aside the curtain just a few inches. Golden street-light shone in a line over his face. Harry filed it all away. Later. He would ask, but it wouldn’t be tonight.
“Why didn’t you tell them?” Draco’s voice was soft, confused. He looked down where his hand was on Harry, jaw clenched.  “Legilimens. It’s illegal.”
It was…nice. More than nice. Ron and Hermione clearly loved him. He found himself wondering if he deserved it.
And much colder. He pulled his cloak tighter, shivering at the punishing wind. The sky was dark, committing to neither rain or snow.
“What are you doing? Hm?” Draco exhaled a laugh, oblivious to what Harry was thinking.  “Whatever this…experiment of yours is meant to prove, you won’t thank yourself for it.”
“He’s a fucking Death Eater!” There was a flash of light, and what looked like a stinging hex flashed across the stranger’s face. He flinched back from Harry. The flame went out, leaving him blind as rain once again fell into his eyes.
The bad guys. They took over the government, and Hogwarts, and tried to round up every muggleborn into these
“Doesn’t look like Hagrid’s home,” Reena sighed, pointing to the little hut near the trees. They walked to the pitch instead. Teddy told him the figures darting around were the Hufflepuff team practicing, and spent a while lamenting on the first-year Quidditch ban.
Some intrinsic, unforgettable part of him reared up in a competitive rage, and he followed after as fast as he could. She won that round, and gloated plenty, but the next wasn’t so easy. Or the one after. Any time either of them got a clear breakaway, some sort of benign curse or slowing charm would hit them from the ground, throwing them off just long enough for the other to catch up.
He went to the main room, where the others seemed to be preparing. The whiteboard had been wiped clean, or Concealed. Scattered documents and binders that had made up the centerpiece of the table were gone. Debra stood in front of the front door, waving her wand and muttering. They must have Security Wards set up that disallowed random visitors.
“I’ll be gone for the night,” Harry said. Castor managed to look displeased, but nodded his head up and down. “If anyone else comes through the fireplace, just ignore them.” Not that that should be a problem. Ron and Hermione knew to expect him. George…well, at the very least a good scare would do him good. But Harry would be back early.
He Levitated a china plate down, uncaring of its age or fragility. A Scalding Hex overdid the toast by just a hair, but the jam covered the worst of the burned spots. The smell was sweet and sugary, promising to sit heavy on the back of his tongue after eating. The next drawer he tried had one of each utensil (three spoons, technically, but all different sizes and therefore brushed off as rich persons nonsense). He steeped the tea in two silver mugs, glancing nosily through the rest of the pantry. Empty. All of it.
The farther he walked, the less he felt stares directed at him. It wasn’t all that crowded just after lunchtime. The white marble steps to Gringotts sounded hollow against his feet. Or maybe that was just the way the marble echoed. Burnished bronze doors awaited him, flanked by two security wizards. They both tipped their hats to him.
Blue eyes moved over his face, anger turning soft. “The last time you had a feeling about Malfoy, you thought he might be becoming a Death Eater. And you were right.”
If one compartment was magicked, perhaps the other variously-shaped cabinets were, as well. Maybe one of them even had…jam. Perfect. Unmarked, which was strange, and cold to the touch. There was a box of tea nestled right next to it, and both smelled of strawberry.
“She’s also your emergency contact,” Hannah supplied. “We’ll be releasing you into her care. Are you alright with that, Harry?”
“Pig?” Harry asked incredulously, reaching for the lower pane. Something hit him hard on the cheekbone.
The scar was thin, but long. It traveled from almost his hip up to his ribs, a light beige that stood out against the deeper brown of his skin. He exhaled a shaky, relieved breath. There had been so much blood before.
Freezing to the touch, naturally, despite the jumper and trousers. His legs bent up at odd angles, supporting his sitting weight as his head rested on his knees. Harry glanced at the closed parlor door and noted the horrific smell coming from within. Rotting.
Draco’s eyes blinked rapidly, a strange, fluttering motion. Debra frowned like she noticed, too. “That was true. I have no knowledge.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Slytherin won, but both teams were really good. You played Seeker, didn’t you?”
“You’ll let Hermione take over the potion,” he said. Mindless words, really, to fill the silence and keep Draco from passing out again.
“Blood purity,” Ron said, watching him. At Harry’s lack of a response, he went on. “I’m a pure-blood. That means I don’t have any muggles in my ancestry. Hermione’s parents are both muggles. That makes her a muggleborn. Anyone in-between is a half-blood. Got it?”
“How far?” Harry pulled it on, smelling the remains of expensive cologne. The fabric was impossibly light, draping like gossamer and not trapping his heat.
Blurry, in one dim corner of a photo in a kitchen, was a huddled, scowling shape. More gargoyle than House Elf, and truly terrifying. “It’s just sitting empty?”
“Don’t mind him,” Hermione said offhandedly. “It’s James, by the way. Your middle name. How old are you?”
It wasn’t Minerva waiting at the gate. This time it was a squat, round old woman and a tall man. Neville.
Light opened up, and then they were on top. It was quite a lot to take in, all at once. The stands were packed, easily fitting the entire school in narrow rows. One half of the stadium was decked out in red, maroon, or gold blankets (and hats, and scarves, and any article of clothing Harry could name). A long line of students to the center top each held a wooden pike that supported a huge, sprawling tapestry that showed an animated lion chasing around a snake. The other half was green, silver, and black. Instead of a banner, they passed around an enormous, papier mache serpent, like a Chinese dragon, nearly.
Terror spiked through his chest, but it was nothing next to the utter agony in his abdomen as his hands were drawn sharply behind his back by thick cords. The momentum of it pushed him onto his back, his tied hands pinned under his spine and forcing his stomach to bend upwards. Whatever scream he produced was drowned out by the pounding blood in his hears.
The other Harry. The one who routinely, it sounded, lied to Ron about his own wife’s whereabouts and allowed his friend to run herself ragged.
When she clicked the one visible button, the screen lit up, showing the time and date over a white background. “It’s very simple,” she explained. “The magic will keep this from making calls or connecting to the internet, but the camera should work just fine.” Her thumb pressed directly on the glass, where a small camera icon grew until the whole screen was an image of her knees and the table. She clicked a big circle near the bottom, and the image was captured.
“Draco gave it to me. And…and he was babbling the other night about the potion affecting him. And the moon cycles having certain meanings.”
“They knew where they were going,” Greenbaum said. “Illusionment stratus never went down. If they did fly a broomstick up here, they did it blind.”
“And thinking.” Another slow sip, her eyes far off. Sixty hours shuffling through the presumably dark, dank halls of the Department of Mysteries, with that heavy
It wasn’t a total standstill, everyone stopping to stare sort of thing. It was more subtle than that. There was Hannah, who smiled and waved a goodbye to him. But everyone else, as he and Hermione passed, looked up.
Mahmoud looked at Ron over his glasses, interested but clearly focusing on the task at hand. “When the magical and the mystical were one and the same, these organizations were for wizards and non-magicals to share thoughts on science, art, and mathematics. It was the belief that wizards disengaged sometime in the fifteenth century. The spread of this specific type of magic proves the opposite, going as far back as, at least, the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.”
reason any young people ever come out here. Without me, they’d all be at Side Ward or K. Atty Corner. It’s all…clothing shops and potion supplies out here. Old people stuff.”
“I’ve got it,” Harry offered, snatching up the bill before Ron. He didn’t feel silly until a moment later, when he remembered they were in a muggle bar and Ron hadn’t been planning on paying anyway. The Weasleys had a wide spread problem with using muggle money. “Stop by the shops with me? I’m out of tea.”
“It’s important you know that Chiron will be in the eight house of Virgo this week, inviting mistrust in your marital heritage and interpersonal – “
Draco sat on the other sofa, leaning forward like a perched bird, eyes wide and staring in a way that suggested sleep had never come. Light still came predominantly from the fire, but the curtains behind Harry let in the faintest bit of morning at their edges.
“…Hereby release all possession of any memories and experiences gained while visiting the Department of Mysteries. Such memories and experiences are limited to questioning, consumption of food and non-food materials, relinquishing of personal fluids and epithelial cell samples.
“Not quite, at least, not that I can discern. Accounts from the time mention increased physical strength and the ability to heal quickly. There was one transcript from a witch burning in Flanders, eleventh century - the wizard appeared dead, but woke within a fortnight and escaped.”
“Let me guess,” he said, pushing the door shut with more force than necessary. “It’s been longer than a half hour for you.”
She backed away, moving around him in a wide arc to open the shed. “Keep that rubbish away from me. They test us for that sort of thing, and the pre-season’s coming up. Besides, what was the point of the Giggle Gummies if you’re just going to smoke it?”
“How are you, Carys?” Draco asked, shockingly warm all of a sudden. Carys smiled at him, bouncing on their heels.
Harry said his name twice more before Draco’s eyes cracked open. A fresh volley of tears followed the action, falling hot against Harry’s hand.
Harry stared at him. “You were…playing cards with the groundskeeper? And why would he hide in the forest – ?”
For a moment, neither of them moved. Behind Draco, a reception area much like the level above buzzed with people. He’d never seen such a crowd up on Two. The golden script above the lift doors told him this was the Department for Magical Accidents, Catastrophes, and Renovation.
“I have a signed Quaffle in my bedroom back home,” he said. The conversation had led him back, slumped against a chair with his legs askew. He balanced the wine bottle on one knee, tipping its weight side to side. Harry had wedged one of the pillows behind him to do the same. He wasn’t drunk, but the fumes and company made him a little lightheaded. Contact high.
The room was huge. Golden arches spanned over his head, and above them a series of glass lifts rose and fell leisurely. People and creatures alike moved past windows overlooking for at least twelve levels. At the center of the large space was a fountain. Clear spouts of water shot out of a golden statue. He wasn’t sure what it was meant to be. Amorphous limbs and curves stuck out of a central blob.
“I don’t…” Harry felt his face heat up, even though Hermione looked highly amused. “Ron’s rather rude, but Hermione’s only trying to help. I don’t see why you dislike her so much unless it’s something to do with – “
In the air before him, golden numbers shimmered and disappeared. Six in the morning. The room didn’t have windows, so he almost didn’t believe it. His sleep had been deep and dreamless. It wasn’t until he fished his wand out from under the pillow that he realized he’d cast the spell without it.
“Harry Potter!” A young, blonde girl shrieked. Her friends hurriedly tried to cover her mouth, wary of the firewhisky in her hand and casting him apologetic glances. He walked faster.
It was a cruel thing to say, and not even true, but Ron choked so dramatically on his brew half the bar looked over.
Every bit the words of an Unspeakable, but he thought he could derive some meaning from it - she was agreeing with him. And that was miraculous. It said a lot about who he'd been. Before. If it wasn't important to the investigation...
Ron loped off to find it. Harry walked their dishes to the sink and sat them down, looking at the sudsy water and masala and thinking hard about living in the moment.
He still checked the locks, aware of how silly it was. Metal locks were essentially useless next to the protective charms he was sure he had on the property.
was stronger than either of them anticipated. It blew right through Ron’s shield, sending his wand across the room.
“Maybe you’ve got a point,” he said in a new tone of voice, frowning at the table. “Your perspective
“Sorry, mate. I feel like one.” He slowed down just a bit, leaning in with a glance at Neville’s back. “Starthistles,” he whispered. “You helped plant them.”
He and Hermione Apparated to Grimmauld Place after he Flooed home to change into jeans and trainers. Number Twelve managed to look even more menacing than it had on Sunday.
“We broke into it, during the war. It was…just, ask Ron. As an Unspeakable, I’ve taken an oath of silence regarding any and all research conducted inside.” He nodded. “I’ll have to obliviate you when we leave.”
The restaurant, when he found it, was…quaint. Surprisingly so. The name of it was hand-painted on a clapboard sign, a cardboard standee holding the night’s menu. Harry found the
She raised one eyebrow as she sat with brittle grace at a short oak table, bare save a vase of knotgrass and Valerian.
Groggily, he found his glasses and went to the window, looking blearily out at late morning spreading without haste through the neighborhood. A small brown owl looked back, pecking pointedly on the glass.
“I’m unfamiliar,” Hermione said, and it sounded like it cost her something. Draco’s hand smoothed over the dusty fireplace mantle.
“How is he?” Harry couldn’t help but ask. She looked over, something sad in the turn of her mouth. “As a student?”
“Ron has it. He’ll be here, soon. For now, we’ll use mine.” She walked to the center of the room and squared her shoulders. “Disarm me.”
Two more people said hello to him – from the Wizengamot Admin office, it looked like. Harry smiled to them, fully aware that the interaction wouldn’t have happened two months ago. His demeanor had changed enough for simple passerby to have noticed, and react accordingly. Bizarre.
“Sorry, mum. Harry can wait.” She winked at him as she took another great bite of potato. Harry smiled weakly, glancing up at the one who must be George. He slouched low in his chair, feet up on the table, whittling something with a short blade as he argued with the shorter one. Long, shaggy hair almost covered up the jagged pink curse scars that marred the skin where his ear should have been.
It was just that last, lingering look. Just before Harry passed out. It wasn’t a look of hate, or even of malice. Harsh words, yes, but with
“Yes!” Harry called back, unable to believe it. This was the most fun he’d had – well, it was impossible to know, but this might be the most fun he’d had in his
“What is it?” He turned his gaze down, curiosity turning to a vague dread. Something in that smile was so…innocent. “Did something happen to him?”
Draco took it from him and unscrewed the top, holding it against his cheek and blinking up at the ceiling. A single, heavy teardrop snaked down the side and, to Harry’s amazement, turned bright blue.
” The stranger growled. The wand was pulled back a few inches, pointing at his face. The stranger seemed to think hard about something, eyes wide and staring. Then, “
“Hey, Harry,” Hannah said, giving him a careful smile before casting a slurry of spells from the foot of his bed. Diagnostics, it looked like. Vague, uncomfortable feelings prodded along his body in time with her wand jabs. Words scribbled themselves across the air, darting down to the blank clipboard under her arm as she read them.
He didn’t bother with a drying charm on his hair. The water soaked into his pillow as he drew the blankets up, holding his wand tightly. This wand knew him very well. It anchored him. In the darkness, he murmured
“No, it’s what we call – “ Ron stopped, laughing suddenly and loudly. He laughed so hard he fell back, laying on the floor with a hand on his stomach. The sound of it warmed something in Harry’s stomach, even if it seemed incongruous. It made him smile, too.
It was hard to look away from him, but Harry managed. The rest of the team exchanged looks he couldn’t interpret.
She frowned at him while he recounted the misadventure the night before, prodding a finger against the bruise on his ankle when he showed her.
Harry still, he realized, had not moved. He did so, clearing his throat in embarrassment. Draco blinked and stepped aboard, fabric swaying all around. The doors slid shut.
“Just let me know the next time you go,” she said, frowning at black pair of socks. “There are places to get clothes that are less hideously expensive than Twilfit’s.”
He got the jump a few times, but Harry never lost a match. It was rather fun. Exhilarating and challenging. Before they knew it, nearly two hours had passed. He was shaking off the effects of a Babbling Curse when Ron said they should be getting back.
“Fidelus,” Hermione whispered, shifting so close her breath fogged the glass. “Interesting – Yaxley never shared the Secret with him.” After a short pause, she looked up at him. “You’ll have to go wave him in. He can’t see the building.”
Harry stared at him, a bit impressed. Veritaserum was supposed to be really uncomfortable. He spoke without thinking. “Did you have
“I gave you the…suggestion of it, yes. But – but that was a simple one. I’m afraid that…the barrier could break at any time, should something trigger it.”
Under Draco’s pale stare, Harry felt more than a little unbalanced. He gave Ron a look for throwing him under the bus.
Finally, Ron crumpled his wrapper up into a ball, wiping a spare bit of crumb from his mouth. “Alright, I suppose I’ll start us off.”
Hermione swiveled, sharp and startled. Another one of those seemingly inane questions that had more weight than he was aware of. “Fourth floor,” she said, biting her lip again. "You’ll know it.”
“Oh. Well – “ Carys kept up with him as he went down the long hall to the left, launching into more gardenia talk. Harry stood there in the quiet, looking around. It wasn’t inviting, exactly. Pretty, and elegant. The floors were sparkling black granite, the stairs lined with marble banisters and two carved swans with emerald eyes. The air itself was almost stale. This place had been even grander, in the past. He got the sense all the empty space used to be filled with lavish things. Raids, Hermione said.
“He comes back every day after that, and the centaur always tells him to leave. They have some…philosophical conversations, and on the third day a pair of men ambush them from the trees. One attacks the centaur, the other the Pegasus. The centaur tries to reason with him, and gets stabbed in the heart. The man steals all the coins from his saddle bag. Pegasus gores his attacker through the stomach with his silver horn. He eats the rest of apples at his leisure, and returns to the moors to be with his herd.”
“I read,” Harry said, trying to stop Ron from saying any more depressing things. “I’ve been cooking for you and Hermione...I talk to Castor a bit, I clean…I write to Teddy…”
It didn’t look broken – that was the beginning and end of Harry’s Auror expertise. But Ron had told him to ‘take charge’, so he walked over to it and looked at the view. It wasn’t a fake window, like the ones at the Ministry. They were well up, at eye-level with the top of the Rolls Building. That put them six levels above the street, on a floor that didn’t appear to exist from the outside.
“Well…” he exhaled, taking the wooden chair next to her, turning it to put a bit of space between their knees. There was a void where he’d come to expect Ron answering for him. “I don’t think they have anything concrete. We know Dolohov did this to me.”
Wouldn’t look her in the eye for a month.” She glanced up at him, suppressing a grin. “Bill thought it was hilarious, and Phlegm couldn’t understand why you wouldn’t be
Hermione re-emerged a while later, just as Harry surrendered his king. She was wearing sweats, her hair down and clouded around her head and shoulders. Ron wrapped an arm around her shoulder, pressing his lips to her temple.
“George?” Ginny asked as they approached. George waved a hand in greeting, a cigarette stuck between his fingers. “Where did you get that?”
Hermione sat on the edge of a chair, crossing her legs and looking at him expectantly. Her posture was stiff, formal.
He’d get Ron or Hermione to help, he decided. Hopefully get a response in before…whatever time they had dinner at Hogwarts.
He stared into the fire Harry had just lit, eyes wide in a manic way as he took another sip. “I never drank as much as I should. I never cared about mealtimes, or where I slept. There was only the work.”
Harry pulled a knee up, facing him. This was what he had wanted to hear, all those weeks ago, when he’d asked Draco what he was like.
Dean and Seamus had clearly given up reading, turning their attention to Draco. Even Élise had looked up. Harry thought Draco should have sent the report ahead - no one was interested in slogging through it when he was right there to explain.
knew things. Things I didn’t. It’s just – I mean, I let it go, because at least once she started letting
“Not anymore," Teddy insisted, turning his chin up. Harry was glad to hear he hadn't cottoned on to Ron's heavy anti-Slytherin agenda.
“What are – “ Harry started. Ron squeezed his arm and shook his head, plastering a smile on his face.
“It feels like a double life," he pressed, ignoring her attempts to quell him. "Like I was two separate people.”
“No, thanks,” Harry called back to the man, following after the swish of black fabric. Alright, he allowed with chagrin, perhaps Ron wasn’t as biased against Draco as he thought – at least, it seemed he was far from the only one.
There was more she had said, or tried to say. Something about Dolohov, and Draco…but he’d been too upset to listen. Her words spun around his head without finding purchase anywhere. Meaningless.
“He doesn’t know,” she went on. “We were waiting for you to wake up. I thought it wouldn’t be necessary to worry him.”
A body, growing from the dirt. Her arms were caught still by her hips, elbows and spine twisting like she was fighting to break free and couldn’t. Harry imagined her face would be drawn in lines of agony, or fear, but instead of a head she had only a large sunflower sprouting from her neck. Unsettled, he looked at the next page, starting mid-sentence under the heading:
She’d set the take away out on plates. Harry took one of the four chairs, waiting as politely as possible for Ron and Hermione to join him. Ron went to the fridge first, taking two beers and setting one down in front of Harry.
When the wind really started buffeting at him, he knew he’d gone as high as this broom would allow. Leaning back into a hovering stop, he looked directly down at the house – a strange beast of a house, it was – and the trees, and even the town a little ways off. George was a pinprick, walking out the center of the field and laying on the grass to watch them.
“She’s famous, too,” he guessed, looking at her in a new light. She was very beautiful. Eye catching in the same ways Ron was. Bright orange hair, a wide, easy smile. But Harry wasn’t particularly attracted to her. He didn’t let on his confusion about his sexuality, keeping that deep inside. It didn’t really matter, anyway.
Sirius was in a few of the Grimmauld Place album photos. Usually reluctant, unsmiling…and, now that he thought about it, exactly like Harry usually appeared. Except Sirius had the decency to smile at his friends’ wedding.
She took a startled step back when he drew his wand, which he felt distantly guilty about. Maybe his tone wasn’t as controlled as he thought it was.
Nothing on Draco’s face moved, save for his eyes. They widened the slightest amount as he looked to Ron. “He doesn’t remember.”
Harry nodded, and George magicked the package down into something small enough for an owl to carry. “You can send it off with Pig, if you like.”
“Good choice. I heard Ballycastle’s Keeper lost eight teeth. Played the whole second half spitting blood, and
Harry was sure Ron had pulled the curtains open during their visit, but they were shut now, fluttering ominously without a breeze.
Harry didn’t pay it too much mind. If he and George had some kind of problem, he would just have to bring it up himself. Harry certainly wasn’t going to.
“That was fun. I mean, not as fun as Quidditch, but I get the sense I’m good at it, y’know? I’m relieved to actually be good at
Greenbaum slipped in silently behind them. Mahmoud didn’t look up from the parchment. “Thirty years after the
, and tried to wonder what it would be like to watch one of his own memories from the outside. From her expression, he didn’t guess they would be good ones. “Well, I can see what Ron’s been going on about. He’s…abrasive.”
The ripples grew larger, grew agitated. Soreness erupted in Harry’s neck, insidious things shifting beneath the muscle. There hadn’t been light to begin with, but it grew even darker as he squirmed. Pain in his temples. Pressure. A hand. A flame. The darkness flooded, permeating past a simple beast of vision, crushing his insides and blocking his lungs. Like a swarm of mice, it chewed and gnawed its way through him, breaking with sharp teeth what wouldn’t give easily. Remember, the voice said. A strange request, in this strange place.
Harry looked up, the shock of Draco glaring at him nearly stronger than his shock at being addressed. Usually he tried to stay out of everyone’s way. “Pardon?”
Lupin. Harry sucked in a breath, a sudden weight in his stomach he couldn't easily identify. "Teddy's father."
“I insist,” Lou said, sidling by George to exit the office. He kept his back to the wall as though Harry were a leper. “I – really – I didn’t expect to – ah.”
“You’re extremely important.” Hermione’s eyes were more pained than her voice let on. “You’ve always hated the word, but you’re something of a…celebrity.”
“It’s odd, you know, to be me. Or not-me, I suppose. You and Hermione seem nice, and your family was great, but what about the other people in my life? I never date, I don’t even own the right robes for work – “
“Well, I’m not really in legislation.” He gave her a squinty, knowing look, and her cheeks went a bit dark. “Officially.”
Ron showed Harry to a room further into the flat, buzzing with nervous energy. “Who knows, maybe you’ll wake up normal and we won’t have to…”
A line formed on Ron’s brow. “Most of it got repossessed by the Ministry. After the raids, I mean. Probably unfairly – even my Mum had something to say about it, but you know how she is about heirlooms. You and I were only trainees while that was happening, though.”
What stood out even more than his eyes was the strange, jagged scar across his forehead. It started at his hair line and zagged down to his eyebrow. A scar, not a disfigurement. Was
Sirius’ room. There had been some interesting books in there. Slipping quietly out of the parlor, he made his way upstairs, stopping at each landing to look around in consternation. It was spotless. All of it. The parlor was one thing, but Draco cleaning the entire house seemed far-fetched. Was there a House Elf here he didn’t know about?
A boot kicked sharply at his thigh, and then there was light. It was blinding at first. He had to blink tears away before he could make out the ghostly face bending over him. It was a man. He looked surprised (which seemed quite ironic), then
Harry rolled his eyes. “What, you mean when we didn’t talk? I don’t have much to compare it to, but you’re quite obnoxious yourself.”
. Like it might sprawl on forever, pulled straight from old story book. The kind where magic wasn’t wands and incantations but something airborne. Breathed and imbibed. Despite the hour – and weather – many little cloaked figures strolled around the browning lawns. Some walked. Some threw what looked like frisbees.
At the sound of his name, Draco’s hand spasmed. The measuring spoon glanced off the side of the cauldron and fell to the carpet, bleeding indigo into the threads. He cursed and cleaned it away with a spell, writing something down on parchment and re-filling the spoon in quick succession.
Rosmerta tapped her nose, closing one eye. “And you, Mr. Potter!” She grinned an accusation. “Just can’t keep out of the papers, can you?”
“Well – “ Ron hesitated, giving Harry a little smile that made him feel like a child trying their best. “Motives aren’t always logical. Could be something completely dull. Like what I’m about to do – paperwork!”
It was a strange feeling, turning his head to the side and seeing empty air. He reached a hand out, feeling rough stone. All that was visible was the little ledge he leaned on. Maybe it technically counted as inside? He didn’t know enough about the wards in place to be certain.
He fell quiet, and Harry somehow knew. No one had mentioned his own parents, nor had any family come to see him. He must not have any. Neither must Teddy, if he was living with his godfather.
George and Fred crouched by the banister, hanging Extendable Ears over the sides. He knew exactly where the photo had been taken – he could almost see how brightly their orange shaggy heads stood stark against the cool tones of Grimmauld Place, undeterred from their troublemaking even in a place like this. He imagined Hermione and Ron’s laughter ringing, pots and pans banging as Mrs. Weasley made massive dinners. Ginny having a row with someone. Everyone standing bright against the gloom of both the house and the war, bolstered by warm fires and maroon sweaters.
“Would you like to come home with me?” If it could talk, then he felt it was rude to not at least ask. “I can build you a fire, there. It’s plenty warm.”
“He knows I would be interested in something like that, so he won’t ask too many questions. He also won’t wonder why I sent you by proxy.” She produced another slip of paper. “While he’s copying the chapter for me, I need you to find this book.
don’t touch anything,” Draco yawned widely, planting a hand on Harry’s chest and shoving him back. “Shut that thing off.”
Harry didn’t feel like that was aimed at him, so he didn’t answer. Hermione walked over and hugged Harry tightly. He hugged back automatically. When she reached over and sharply tugged at Ron’s arm, he reluctantly stepped forward and put an awkward arm around Harry, too.
Without another word, she walked through the door. It didn’t open for her, or anything. Just…let her through. Curious, Harry stepped forward to try the same, but some quickly written words stopped him.
“Yes, well I know plenty about persecution,” she snapped. Draco went still. “How were artifacts like that not seized in the raids?”
“You think he knows we’re making a move?” Ron asked, and it only kind of sounded like an accusation.
The only standing furniture other than the bed was a wardrobe. Harry eased one of the wooden doors open, met with a blue glow. Quite bright. Quite unmistakable.
,” Ron said, slapping a finger down one a photo from Grimmauld Place. “Is Kreacher. He was the House Elf.”
The Auror team quickly covered up raucous laughter as he walked into the office. Ron was the only one who didn’t wipe the smile from his face.
Two boys sprinted down the long hall, robes billowing. One of them had bright purple hair, and Harry felt a grin steal over his face. He opened his arms just as Teddy barreled into him. His head came to Harry’s shoulder, which surprised him. He’d expected shorter.
“You mean, you didn’t…” Whatever was going on, it appeared Ron had caught on. He was shaking his head, glancing between Harry and Hagrid. “He said Hagrid smells like the forest.”
He went to the Ministry again on Friday morning. The fountain was a jagged, abstract shape that could have been a lightning bolt, or a piece of broken mirror. A pair of women in their fifties called out his name, in the hopeful, unfamiliar way he’d come to associate with people who only knew him from the papers. They tittered when he waved, and he didn’t even care about the man in the pointed hat who took his photograph as he stepped onto the lift.
No, he decided, pulling his hand away and clenching it at his side. He had a good idea who he’d think about if he did. And it just wasn’t on.
you would say that. But you’ve forgotten about the entire point of the Greenfield recovery maneuver – “
Which proved Harry’s point. The disquiet he'd been wrestling with all week (had it really been less than a week?) was getting harder to ignore.
The woman who’d held his hand gave Harry a chagrined look from behind Ron’s back. He was relieved to see that the tears were gone.
he thought as the brick wall gave way to more crowds. It was Friday night, and despite the late hour it was positively
“A very dry porridge.” Draco took one of the mugs and held it between his hands. “Half-turned palourdes. An attempt at sausages, though I’m not certain it was giving me actual meat.”
Eventually, the broomsticks returned to the shed. Ron took a chair near Hermione, and Bill sat on the blanket, drawing the baby into his lap. The conversation turned reminiscing, for Harry’s benefit but not obviously so. They talked about the past ten years, about weddings and small fights and Teddy breaking an heirloom clock trying to climb the picture-wall.
But he ate it. He tore the lid off and sat, Conjuring a fork and shoveling down large mouthfuls. Then the potatoes. And the bread. In desperate, almost animal-like motions. And with no reserve. It was like Harry wasn’t even there.
“And you have a vested interest in the opposite,” he snapped. She looked up with something like horror. “So make something up.”
She stared, eyebrows raised slightly in expectation. Harry started talking, his brain only a half-step ahead of his mouth.
Everything was spinning and slowing and pressing his eyelids shut. The man hit him again, this time in the stomach. Potter screamed, the force of it tearing at his throat.
She chewed a full bottom lip. “If the shields didn’t recognize you, your head, arms, and legs would fall clean off when you stepped through the door. Like a mannequin.”
Hermione’s sudden frown made him wonder if that was supposed to happen. “Not normal?” He asked, bracing for his limbs to start breaking off. “Did I mess it up?”
Harry didn’t very much trust George’s tea supply. Possibly charmed to turn his tongue to taffy, and of course all loose-leaf. He pushed aside the boxes and picked a harmless-looking can of Lavender. “It seems like you’re doing well. No need to make more trouble for yourself. Wasn’t the Hogwarts thing bad enough?”
“Yeah!” Lee said, when Harry asked. “I’ll be on the wand with Jackie Phillipson. Think you’ll come? Ginny probably got you box seats.”
“He’s in London.” Harry put his hand over the mug so he didn’t have to see the words anymore. “It made the papers, didn’t you see?”
“Everyone else seems to think the opposite. You certainly do – it’s like I never smiled, before. Or laughed, or treated any of my co-workers with any sort of respect – “
The bed was unmade, sheets twisted like he’d just climbed out and left after a night of tossing and turning. Forgotten, the duvet sagged to the floor. Its deep red matched the scarf thrown over the bed post. The closet door hung open, half-covering the window.
She swallowed, winding her fingers together. “This could be life or death. Can you accept that as my answer, for now?”
“You fancy him,” George accused, switching tact. Probably because he knew Harry had a point. “You fancy Malfoy.”
“Hey,” Teddy said. She looked up and grinned. But a few other kids looked up, too. Harry was promptly surrounded and bombarded with questions.
He didn’t comment on the fact that they stepped out onto the fourth floor. Honestly, the way this day was going he could have been wrong about entering from the first. They were above the turning staircases now. A few students here and there saw them and skittered away.
He looked up when George gasped, alarmed when he Summoned a pad of paper and started scribbling madly with a pen. “Harry, that’s
“Can’t even use a damn umbrella charm,” he muttered, kicking off his shoes. “Why we ever decided to live in a muggle neighborhood is beyond me.”
from the other room, then the flapping of wings. The owl landed right on top of the box, clutching his claws over the string. It was just over half his size, but he looked confident enough. Harry tied the letter to his leg and leaned to push up the window.
The snake didn’t answer, but lifted its head and stretched to meet Harry’s hand so he could lightly grasp the scales a few inches behind its jaw, holding it around chest height. Counting to five, he pulled the door open.
Leaves rustled beside and above them. Some blew right off their branches in the sudden gust, swirling wildly in the crisp air. They were in Scotland, but he hadn’t expected it to be
The rest of their Sunday party was standing around the garden gate, watching, various drinks in hand. Ron and Charlie both had beer, Arthur a pint. Molly and Ginny were loudly arguing about something while Hermione leaned against one of the posts, every blink getting longer until it seemed she’d pitch over asleep at any second. Alcohol really did her in.
The ice cream shop was shut for the day, it seemed. One of the biggest shops, though. Only ‘one of’, because the one directly across from it was
Halfway through it, he heard the tell-tale rustle of Floo flames, and then there was a hoarse cry. He suspended the magic and rushed to the front room. “Ron?”
Harry didn’t like it, but he couldn’t think of any valid argument. He only nodded, and Draco seemed appeased.
If they weren’t standing so close, he wouldn’t have seen her eyes flick up to stare at his scar for the briefest of moments. “If you can’t name it, tell me what it does.”
Her pink lips tilted up. He thought he might be sweating. “You like to invest in new companies. Donations, really. Diagon Alley would not have rebuilt so quickly after ze war without your help.” She leaned forward at where he was looking. “Ah. Last year…I believe it was to George…’e was fined by ze Ministry for hiring a test group without ze proper permits.”
. Well, that was bloody vague. Harry glanced over his shoulder in the alley, praying that one of the many patrons inside the bar wouldn’t walk out here and see him. Fuck.
Harry tried to look calm and confident, two emotions in very short supply this week. He cast a silent
The person he’d been staying with. Harry wondered if he had a more permanent residence somewhere, or if he just hopped from safehouse to safehouse. There was always the family’s estate Harry had heard about.
Harry gasped awake someplace unfamiliar with the panic of a nightmare hot on his heels. The loud, unwelcome noise only added to his confusion.
Harry almost didn’t understand, then remembered all at once that yes, Hermione was still supposed to be working on that. On getting his brain back together. The agreement they’d come to was unofficial at best.
Harry found that bothered him. Ron had said it so certainly, but Harry wouldn’t have thought witches were his type. Then again, he didn’t know himself very well. “Molly?”
When he stood up, she stretched out, pulling a pillow beneath her head. “I’m usually at yours for this.”
Harry scooped up three of the red pieces, reluctantly popping them in his mouth. Lee had a certain glint in his eye that reminded him of George. “What does that mean?”
Shedding their outerwear and boots, they sat in a private room and waited for a mousy blonde wizard to bring them the documents they’d been working on all week. An ancient Auror manuscript had them particularly stumped – the cursive was so spindly and rushed it looked more like artwork than actual English. Their time on it was wasted - the gist seemed to concern Horcruxes, but it wasn’t as detailed as any of them would have liked.
After a few moments, a large red ball shot out of the shed and up toward them. She arrested it’s momentum so Harry could catch it under one arm.
“I’m quite good at it,” she sounded a little defensive. “No lasting damage. And I always get your informed consent.”
Pig was picking at the uneaten plate. The flight across London and right back must have exhausted the old thing, but Harry couldn’t have left him at the house with Castor.
“Oh, I’ll have words with you, later.” She took Harry’s arm and pulled him toward where the rest of the voices were.
“Well, I’m not just the brewer. I’m also the subject. It’s the binding magic that makes this so personal. And I’m taking the brunt of it to keep Dolohov and Macnair none the wiser to it.”
,” Ginny stood and passed a gurgling Victoire across the table. Ron held a protective hand over his food.
“That explains it.” He lifted the baby up so it’s chubby feet stood on his thighs. Some drool leaked down its chin as it smiled at him, all gums and big blue eyes. “Victoire, was it?”
But also Fred and George, found in the margins of every photo looking like they were still laughing at something one of them had said.
– walking from the fireplaces in the atrium. It had been taken from the side at a surreptitious angle. His undone robes billowed open, showing his collared shirt and trousers.
She shrugged, watching a lone muggle pass them by with a glint of suspicion. “They didn’t say if the stolen records were personal or not. I’m not sure there’ll be much for us to do here – not that I would have turned down your help. Having Harry Potter along should smooth the process.”
Harry crossed his arms and leaned back against the wall. He’d never seen Hermione so completely stunned before.
Harry nodded to each of them as they went, noticing that they all wore robes that matched Ron’s. Black with red stripes around the collar. Was he meant to be wearing those? Hermione hadn’t said anything.
, Ron. No. Harry, if you have to write to him, we’ll help you. Tomorrow I’ll take you to the Ministry. Let the other Unspeakables have a look at you. You’ll be seen, and everyone who knew you were in St. Mungo’s will know you’re alright.”
had gotten a picture of you in Hogsmeade with ‘a mysterious blonde’ and Mum actually had the nerve to ask you about it.”
The stories kept coming, but there was a more muted quality to them. Nods of agreement instead of gleeful arguing.
Harry didn’t dignify that with a response. “If you really need the money, I’ll go to Gringotts while I’m here. So long as it’s
She gestured to the chair in front of her desk; an ancient, spindly thing that matched the rest of the set. A large painting behind her depicted Gringotts from street level, a night sky above complete with shooting stars at repetitive intervals. It was much nicer than the unicorn.
“No, you weren’t. Aren’t. I mean - yeah.” He cleared his throat again. “Sorry. It’s weird to have you staring at me like that.”
Harry went to look. The rain had started up, driving everyone off the streets – not that this one had many crowds – save one dark figure standing at the grassy patch where Harry and Hermione had Apparated.
sake,” he said. He must never speak to Hermione like that, because she gasped and Ron’s eyebrows met his hairline. Harry gentled his tone. “I didn’t do it, alright?
. And let the pieces fall. At least, when he did get his memories back, he couldn’t go back to this forced isolation. It seemed unlikely that Ron would care.
“Do you know what this is?” She asked drawing his attention by unbuttoning the top of her blouse. Balancing her tea with one hand, she drew out a thick gold chain. A pendant hung from it, either very heavy or highlighting her current weakness.
bed, shoved into one corner. Beside that was a table covered in books and stacks of papers. An armchair the size of a taxi glowed from the firelight. It smelled overwhelmingly of pine and cooking meat.
“That’s just left over from last time. Don’t worry – you agreed to it. Today will just be…oh, I suppose questioning. Diagnostic magic. That sort of thing.”
“No,” Ron said quickly. “I’m just trying to get my thoughts straight. You don’t need to...I mean, you don’t want to…?”
She didn’t ask for an explanation, glancing around the floor to make certain before taking a seat in the armchair and crossing her legs. “I need you to take that bag to Draco.”
“Right.” Ron sank down beside him, knocking their knees together as he flipped the scrapbook about three pages in. “That’s their greenhouse.”
“Are you my owl?” Harry cut a cube of apple and set it on the other side of the table. The owl hopped down and snapped it up. “What’s your name, hm? You look like a…like a Todd.”
“Thank you, Hermione,” Harry said. His shoulder was really starting to throb. “Without you, I would never know to take any precaution at all. I might just invite Dolohov for tea and let him use my wand to stir the sugar.”
lift, but kept quiet. He knew if he started talking again he wouldn’t be able to stop. “Why don’t you go talk yourself out of it?”
He was reluctant to let it go, even for the amount of time it would take to go to his apartment, wherever that was. The room outside was large, bustling with people in pink and blue robes. Words and memos moved quickly overhead to their various destinations.
“I know that everyone has plenty of reason not to trust him. I do. But none of it seems to justify letting this go on. If he can help, which he claims he can, then I don’t see a reason to turn him away. I think a lot of this was just – just petty rivalry. I mean, we’re adults, aren’t we? It feels wrong to go on blaming him for any of this when I know it’s not his fault. This time, anyway.”
The one other door entered them into an office almost identical to the one at Harry’s house. Smaller, but just as messy.
He sighed, carefully examining at the shattered piece of glass that worked as a stopper to keep the photo upright. It only reflected his own eye, so he put it back. The spell he cast on the door was simple enough that whoever tried to get in would at least know they weren’t wanted. He didn’t see a reason to take it any further than that.
Hermione appeared before he was at the garden gate, calling his name and hurrying over with a bottle of wine.
She stood, gesturing for him to do the same. Then she handed him her wand. He took it hesitantly. A warm buzz of magic settled over his right arm. It didn’t feel strange at all. He must have used it before.
“And since I was attacked?” He recalled the conversation he’d walked in on. “You think he was involved, don’t you?”
George’s nostrils flared, much like Ron’s when he was annoyed, and ignored Harry’s question. “He asked if I wanted to get dinner Friday night. I assume you know why.”
. “What are you playing at, Malfoy?! Thought you’d cook up some new bullshit theory to mess with us?”
Ginny had leveled off lower down. Her hair floated around her head as she grinned up at him. Tilting the nose of the broom and shooting to meet her felt as natural as breathing.
After he came, an intense, fleeting elation, Harry wondered where those words in particular came from. Draco hadn’t said anything like that to him, but it was Draco’s voice in his head. He was sure he must have heard it, and forgotten or something.
Ron found him on the floor, surrounded by photo albums. As there were only three, this probably wasn’t the deep dive Harry had felt it was. But he’d spend the better part of an hour on the rug, flipping through his past.
Despite the looks, no one approached him. Hermione wound her arm through his and directed them subtly toward a series of lifts.
“It’s a secret!” Harry defended, standing to dump his tea. “This is the last time I have breakfast at
He chewed the tip of the sugar quill, wondering what Draco was doing to prepare for that night. Eating something, hopefully. Staying warm.
Ron returned with an armful of paper-wrapped sandwiches. Harry’s was ham and cheese, and he wasn’t at all hungry for it. There was scattered conversation, mostly about people and things Harry didn’t know, but everyone seemed sort of distracted.
And her frame swung forward, revealing a circular entrance to a very cozy room. A fire went, and large squashy chairs dotted the carpet near the warmth. Reena was sat in one, her nose stuck in a book.
“I thought…but Hermione was right. I can’t do this to him.” Harry scrubbed at his face. “I don’t want to.”
All it left behind was a vague sense of warmth. No one else reacted to it, and as the gate creaked shut the figure pulled it’s hood down.
When he said that, something disrupted the studious calm over her face. But she schooled it quickly away. “Middle name?”
It must be destined for the Pensieve, he thought, and glanced around with new purpose. He’d never seen it in the parlor (he’d never seen a Pensieve at all, actually), and this seemed the next most likely place for it.
running bullshit articles like that. I think Mum was just...hoping.” He gave Harry an apologetic look. “The first question, you tolerated. After the second, you took Teddy and left. Without a word. It was...chilling. The look on your face was just like it used to be… You stopped coming by the Burrow after that, for a long time.”
He met Ron and Hermione at half-past nine Saturday morning. The cold was blistering in Hogsmeade. Wind whipped leaves and spare droplets of rain into their faces as they Apparated near the trailhead. Harry had done his best to layer up in winter robes and two pairs of socks, but still felt underdressed. Ron and Hermione had matching lopsided hats and scarves, a little too amateur to be from Molly.
“Nice,” Harry repeated. “And you’ve got loads of other brothers. I dunno. I just don’t think I’m in a place to help with…” he looked around at the restaurant. “Anything. Sorry.”
Another voice started to interrupt him, but everything went quiet as Harry opened the door, walking inside with more confidence than he felt. The room was cramped, with four cubicles taking up the corners and a central, long table covered in filing folders and papers.
“They’ll be talking about that one for a while,” Neville said. Harry looked over his shoulder, shrugging. There were only two unsmiling faces in the whole box.  Zabini was still at the back corner, next to a pudge older man who laughed heartily at something Professor Sprout was whispering in his ear. Zabini didn’t look particularly antagonistic. Just half-resigned to being amused.
Draco had basically told him to be scarce until the antivenom was ready for its next step on Wednesday. Two days from now.
Harry set his plate to the side, leaning back against the corner of the wall. “That would be difficult, seeing as she doesn’t know I’ve – well.”
There was a twinge of something, behind the tiredness. It must have been jealousy. Harry couldn’t imagine this type of situation could possibly cause any other emotion in someone in Ron’s position.
He turned to the second album, pointing out an image of the whole Weasley clan with Harry and a young Hermione pressed in on either side of Molly. “Where was this taken?”
“Oh, yes...It happened around midnight last night,” he said, leading them further down the corridor. The walls were carefully blocked so everything was a straight line, but Harry felt they were walking in a large circle. “If the wards are dismantled, all the clocks come to a stop.” He waved for emphasis as they passed one hung above a doorway, stopped at 12:05 (Harry assumed – the numbers had been replaced by glyphs). “Night security was here within minutes, but the intruder was gone.”
Harry shook his head, idly trying to scoop escaped sludge into Victoire’s mouth for the third time. “Said she’d set it on fire if I opened it before she left – oh,
He seemed to notice that, finally, blinking and touching his own face in confusion. “Would you fetch me a vial?”
“Broomstick,” Harry finished. He’d seen something similar last week at the Burrow, on the semi-freshly painted garden fence. Arthur told him Teddy had skidded into it his first time on a broom that spring.
“Whatever happened…all my memories – wiped.” He made a slashing motion with his hand, the emphasis making Teddy’s eyes widen.
He pushed his head along Harry’s arm, using the last foot or so of his body as leverage to curl once around his neck, solid weight draping over his shoulders.
“Yeah. Yeah, if we go there this weekend we could look around. For now, we can start researching in the Ministry Archives.”
Harry could barely even smell the tar anymore. His nostrils did burn a bit. And his fingertips were still numb, even as he huffed his breath on to them. “What about you.”
She stood paralyzed, staring at him like she’d never seen him before. Harry didn’t blame her. He felt quite deranged. But he was also furious. And scared.
“Harry, is that – ? Oh! Mr. Malfoy.” She stood and brushed her robes straight. Her voice alerted everyone else to Draco’s presence, and Ron’s orange hair stuck up over his cubicle wall as he jumped to his feet.
Harry was flabbergasted. Maybe it was stupid to be so surprised, after the looks and whispers he faced in the streets. But this was markedly different.
“Gallahey and Seamus,” he went on with watering eyes. “Looked through some old fairy tales about Merlin. We might need to bring in some sort of literary expert, though, because when they
“Yes,” he said, reproachful. Harry smiled. “Of course I will. You said you’d be here for the first Gryffindor game – we’re against Slytherin.”
“Oh.” Harry faltered. He was an Auror. It felt strange to think it. “Why are you keeping him, then?”
“You have my proposal,” Draco said loftily, ignoring the bewildered looks from the other Aurors. “Explaining further would be a waste of my time. And if you intend on maintaining this charade, I suggest you keep your wayward Head Auror on a leash. He just tried to
His first impression was that it was medical. There weren’t any machines or beeping, and it took him a second of looking around to realize that he was in a wizarding hospital. That must be it.
Well, George certainly topped the weirdness with every conversation. “Why would a centaur need sickles?” Harry wondered, pulling items from the pantry.
“It’s…worse,” he said, swiping a hand through his hair several times, pushing it back into place. He was wearing nicer robes than usual, if that was possible. But it was clear he still wasn’t sleeping. “When she has time to prepare. She knew I was in London for a bit, but…I don’t normally see her this often in a year.”
“I didn’t expect so.” She tapped her wand to her nose absentmindedly. “I’ve thought about it, and it’s strange. I can’t tell you a single thing, even what you already knew.”
“Obviously,” Draco drawled. He stared straight ahead, knuckles white around a bound sheaf of papers. Harry pressed for Two again to set the lift in motion. It was too short a ride for him to think of something to say. Draco didn’t exactly run off down the hall, but walked just fast enough to be two steps ahead of Harry.
“Some of the blokes in Transportation thought it might be Madame Rashida,” Debra said, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Any comment?”
And fathoms above yard rules at the Burrow. He and Ginny could have a real competition without George slowing them down.
Debra’s ‘ways’, whatever Dark magic they must have been, had Draco moving in the next afternoon. The message of affirmation came addressed to the entire department.
“No, Harry, it’s fine. Actually, you – “ She stopped herself, pursing her lips while she washed the soap out. “How much have they…told you?”
But as he lifted the wand to his mouth, a reserve of bravery Harry wasn’t prepared for sort of…took over. Maybe it had something to do with the way Teddy was jumping up and down, hands over his mouth. Ron looked like he’d faint.
fractured. Him, and everything he was. There was a scream, some time, and a gasp. A clean sound. Pleasure turned pain.
He didn’t think these had been made by him. There was a crafty, considered touch to the organization of the photos. The first book almost entirely belonged to Teddy. From toddler to Hogwarts letter, his life had been catalogued. One picture had gotten him stuck for almost ten entire minutes, unable to look away. Him and Teddy – somewhere between three and five – asleep together on Hermione’s couch. Teddy’s small form was sprawled across Harry’s chest, on hand fisted against his chin.
Teddy was giving him the sort of look Hermione often did – that he was acting completely out of character but it was sort of all right. Reena left her book behind and walked over.
“I – “ She put out a hand. “Enough. I didn’t come here to argue about it. It – it would be best if you went with me to the Department of – “
He blinked, then shook his head. She hoisted herself onto a countertop, crossing her ankles and watching him over the top of a bottle of muggle iced tea. Silence was a new addition to their dynamic - they usually had more to talk about. There was never silence at the Burrow.
“Hagrid wrote me, as well,” Harry said, retrieving it from the sitting room table and glancing over the words again. It was certainly an interesting correspondence – but the last paragraph had given him a good panic.
,” Molly snapped at the same time, pointing her wand. A stinging hex zapped Ron on the arm. “Watch your tongue in my house!”
There was some puttering around before George hobbled in, balancing two potted plants and a big leather-bound notebook in his hands. Harry pulled the stack of cardboard out of his way. Lee helped him put the plants down without breaking anything.
“I’ll show you how to rework the wards,” she said, pulling him along the asphalt with her big blue umbrella at her side, ready for whenever the inevitable rain decided on falling. Harry had noticed on Sunday with a great sense of irony that the front door had no handle.
“Restricted Section at Hogwarts is fairly ancient,” Seamus mentioned. Ron nodded his agreement, some of his anger falling away.
“Hogsmeade,” he explained hastily. “Magic’s all wonky here. They have to keep the students under control when they visit.”
“Still not feeling anything!” Lee called after the next few boxes were folded. Harry struggled to match his pace.
“Hey, Ted.” He patted him on the shoulder, eyes falling on Harry in question. “Blimey, you get shorter?”
“Probably.” Definitely not. “Y’know, everyone keeps telling me how great this place is? I’m not so impressed.”
Ron didn’t look at him. While talking about Hermione seemed fine, this struck Harry as a different matter altogether. George and Ron didn’t, as far as Harry knew, spend much time together. Besides the odd banter over dinner, they didn’t really speak at all. George didn’t speak with any of his brothers, Harry had noticed. They certainly didn’t see him as often as Harry (both Other and Now) did. They didn’t
“I feel drawn to you,” he said flatly. Draco’s eyes widened, snapping back to him. “And I don’t think that’s the only reason for it. I think we weren’t as distant as you claim.”
“Yeah.” Harry gave up and pulled his jumper off. His wand was somewhere near the nappy station. “It’s about Teddy.”
His shoulder bumped the wall as Ron clapped his shoulder, leaning over the table to snag a blank memo. “What about you?”
The design went all the way up to the inner crease of his elbow; a snake twisting out of the mouth of a skull, in lines of heavy black ink. Aged, but not necessarily faded.
“What do you mean?” Ron pulled his draft back over (correspondence with the German Head Auror, written under Harry’s name for information on some case or another), making some last marks.
She cast him a teary-eyed, but still very furious look. The door slammed shut. Harry nearly drove his fist into the blank wood. Repressing the urge made the entryway lightbulb shatter.
Grimmauld Place was less cheerful. Grey snow sat shoveled into piles at the side of the roads to make way for soon-to-come morning traffic. He tapped his wand to the front door and pushed it open.
“You started trying, for Teddy.” Ron sat up, not meeting his eyes. “You’re a great dad. Really. You give him everything.
“Well, come on, then. I’m sure I’m chuffed to the muff for customers to see me in my jammies.” He stepped out anyway, leaning over the railing. “Alright, Mel?”
Ron stared at him, contemplating. Then Harry shoved a plate of food under his nose and he was sufficiently distracted for a good ten minutes. Ron was a little bit easy to manipulate, or at least divert. Hermione was the opposite - the puppetmaster.
The hall was long, lined with closed doors. A memo darted past his ear and zoomed through a gap at the top of
They went on like that for a while. She rotated questions about history, basic magical facts, and simple displays of magic. There weren’t any other spells he couldn’t do, but she did ask him to name the three Unforgivables.
He didn’t follow her as she stormed off. She’d stunned him, a bit, though he supposed he should have expected more fallout. Why did it have to be so bloody
For a flash second, he thought he saw the same in Teddy’s eyes, but it was already gone, replaced by a toothy smile.
“Soup should be ready.” He kept his notebook out of reach of either of them, getting to his feet and skipping off to the kitchen. “We’ll try the medical ones next. You can take turns naming the bones in my feet.”
She flipped shiny red hair over her shoulder and held the sweater under running water, using her wand to lather in a purple soap. “Who’s to say I’m not pressing my advantage?”
Harry turned. Draco was clearly still winded from what little effort he’d just expended, leaning heavily on the wall.
“What the bloody hell was that?” Harry asked, bewildered and a little afraid. Ron took a deep breath and stowed his wand with a trembling hand.
Harry went to the fridge and pulled out one of the containers Fleur had left. It smelled vaguely of sweet potato and carrot, and matched perfectly to the color of George and Victoire's hair.
Harry smiled, feeling trapped, until eventually Ron cleared his throat. Mahmoud blinked and released Harry’s hand.
“No.” She’d taken off her gloves. Her bare hand was bony and dry against his as she reached out to squeeze it. “I quite agree.”
“Obviously, I’m not doing anyone any good here,” Harry said quickly. Ron came to a stop in front of him, apology written all over his face. “I’ll just go home, yeah? Let you all do your jobs.”
“Or don’t.” He threw his hands up. “It’s not like I get to have an opinion. But maybe now that he’s not egging you on – ”
“It’s necessary for me to...rest...between houses. I don’t always, but it’s not like cursebreaking a castle, or a pyramid. These places were designed to keep people like me safe, so they tend to punish me for breaking the wards back down.”
“He’s working with us,” Harry mumbled, sticking his finger in the hot tea and swirling it. The letters came right back. “Is
He bit the inside of his cheek and nodded. Harry sighed in defeat, turning back to their food to angrily shake the chicken pan. “You said I was a good father.”
He prepared himself for the possibility. Wouldn’t it be better to tell Teddy than to lie about it? Which would he prefer, if he was a child?
“Well, you’ll have to come back this way, no?” She let herself in with a dismissive wave. “I’ve just got a barrel of Beetle Berry – aged forty years!”
Draco’s eyebrows pinched high. “To your knowledge, he hasn’t been near London for at least eight years. Right?”
Harry had no answer to that. With all she was babbling about ancient Greece, it seemed her mind was firmly on Draco’s business. Was that why she was rushing it? Hurrying to get back to studying Harry? “Fixing” him?
Harry looked up, at the people rushing out of their houses across the street. At the nearby piece of wall that had some sort of symbol on it.
He shivered just thinking about the dusty tapestries and dark rooms. They hadn’t stayed long. Ron tried to brighten the visit with happy stories of their time sequestered away from the war, but even those weren’t enough to keep out the chill.
Harry only had a moment to take it in before he was being…mauled? No – hugged. Or at least what this person understood as a hug. He jerked Harry up by the shoulder and crushed him between two strong arms.
requests compensation from one Harry Potter to the order of fifteen galleons, regarding the destruction of a magical press camera on the first of September, year two-thousand-and-nine. Signed Wermley Wilson... Huh.”
It was unpleasant, which he expected. Everything spun, but it was a closed network so he didn’t see any other fireplaces. There was nowhere to get lost, and it was simple enough to step out of his own. The halt of momentum sent him stumbling, and he fell forward as his foot caught on something.
Harry pulled him in for a much tighter hug, willing back the tightness in his throat. “I will. I promise.”
“When she started at Mysteries. Years ago. I was in Auror training, still. And…I mean, she was alone. Entirely alone. Before you started working with her…” he rolled his eyes in an effort to hide the emotion in his voice. “Like I said, I have no idea what it was that you were up to. But you
“Draco,” he repeated, and when he got no response he leaned forward, touching his hand to Draco’s neck and forward, drawing him up as gently as possible by the chin. He looked to be sleeping, but if he was it wasn’t pleasant. There was tension in his face, his eyes circled in bruised purple skin and highlighted by tear tracks. Something like soot marked his cheek.
,” Ron shouted, jerking her back by the shoulders. The snake reared back a little at their sudden appearance.
Harry finished up the signatures and took the papers to the Ministry. Dean and Seamus saw him in the hall, stopping for a brief conversation about the missing Kneazel. Apparently it had been found making a nest underneath some Dumpsters in Side Ward.
“Erm, Harry Potter to see Herm…Unspeakable Granger,” he said. Nothing happened. He jumped as something prodded his arm.
Harry realized, as warmth spread through his chest that had nothing to do with the tea, that he’d like that very much. “I – sure.”
Hermione didn’t say anything. He moved closer to the table, curious and repulsed. A picture frame was turned face-down. When he picked it up, he saw a large crack across the glass. Like someone had slammed it down in a drunken rage.
“Falcons vs. Bangers. Should be good,” Dean grunted, pulling his chin up to the bar, biceps bulging. Harry focused on his own reflection and pushed himself until the weights were heavy enough to pin themselves to the floor.
Did he quietly obey, or was he loud and cantankerous like Ron’s family? Did he like ice cream? Eat his greens? Was he aware of this darkness that bled into every other aspect of Harry’s life? Harry hoped not. He hoped he’d kept it hidden away.
“We’re on duty, Rosmerta,” Debra sighed. Harry thought that was only half the reason – they all still showed the signs of their late night.
The copy I did find, in the Archives, has ten chapters, and exactly five hundred pages.” It was all copied down under the title. “If his copy has any more, then I
He’d taken a walk around his little neighborhood just before dark the other day, stopping at the end of the street and watching the crush of muggles walk past the entrance to what they saw as a narrow, dirty alley.
“Yeah.” Ron smiled at the memory. “It’s protected by Fidelus, so while Dumbledore was Secret-Keeper, it was the only safe place for us to be. Horrible house, but we had good times.”
“Well.” Draco exhaled indulgently. “Assuming I found a ticket, and assuming I made it through the wards…someone could try to kill me, women and children would run screaming, foreign Ministries would pull funding from the League – “
Her eyes opened, full of pain and regret. He could see that he’d gotten to her in every way he could. He saw that it didn’t matter. “I’m sorry.”
Draco shut his eyes, swaying slightly where he sat. Drunk, or rapidly approaching it. “Sleep,” he sighed. “I’ll miss sleep the most. I haven’t dreamed in almost a week.”
“Thanks for the sickles, and everything else,” Teddy murmured after a while. He leaned forward, discreetly wiping his eyes as he dug through his pocket. “Gerard Karasu got me a bunch of stuff from town. This is the last of it.”
heavy – much too heavy for its side. It matched the color of the chain, but even real, solid gold wouldn’t have been this dense.
He closed it back up and tried the third door. This room was messier than anything yet. A desk took up half of it, but the floor was covered with piles of paper and books. The nearest binder he could read was intimidatingly large.
