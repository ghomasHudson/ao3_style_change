Potter nodded. “Sadly it is the truth. The Sorting Hat debated on which of the two houses I would be better suited to, but in the end I begged it not to put me in Slytherin. I guess he let me have my way.”
The words dusted over Draco like sunshine, and he was suddenly in anguish that they had agreed to wait until after the interviews were finished to go any further. He needed Harry. He
“It’s kind of impressive that you can cook at all, though, Draco,” Harry said. The back of Draco’s neck tingled at the casual use of his name. “I mean, I assume you never had to when you were growing up.”
“I hardly lost, Potter!” Draco exclaimed, and Harry rejoiced at the familiar indignance in his expression. “I caught the snitch twice!”
Draco was hardly aware of the noises he was making, Harry’s hand slowly working him into a tizzy, but soon, too soon, he pulled his hand away. Draco whimpered in objection, his cock a dripping, rigid mess, but Harry only smiled up at him, a slightly evil glint in his eye. Before Draco could register what was happening, Harry leaned down and took Draco’s cock in his mouth.
Draco could feel his cheeks heating and distracted himself by slowly depositing the amber-colored bean in his mouth. Every time Harry said things like that, he had to actively remind himself that this was just a job.
“I don’t mind it in the slightest,” Draco told him, haughtily sipping his tea. “Though your compliments are few and far between, as it happens.”
“Not that I didn’t want to,” Draco admitted quietly. He trailed his hand a few inches further down Harry’s stomach, to the hem of his t-shirt. Bravely, he skated his fingertips over the line of hair below Harry’s belly button and pushed his hand underneath Harry’s t-shirt, back up over his chest. His skin was so warm, and feathered with hair, and his heartbeat was racing. And suddenly, so was Draco’s.
“All the parts!” Harry exclaimed angrily. “You were forced into marriage--with a woman, no less--and your wife left you when you didn’t get her pregnant? Every bloody part of that is despicable!”
“Harry,” Draco muttered, desperate for him, but clinging to his restraint like a lifeboat in a hurricane. “You can touch yourself if you want to.”
Even in his numb state, Draco’s body tingled at the word, and he had to remind himself to focus. He took a sip of tea.
“Actually,” Draco told him, straightening his tie, “you seem perfectly capable of pouring your bloody heart out regardless of the location. Coffee shop, ice cream parlor, middle of the street--”
“Look, let’s just be on the same team from now on,” Harry suggested before Draco could speak. “I promise to be honest with you from here on in.”
“You don’t need to say anything,” Harry said. “You won’t need to do anything at all, really. Just lie back and let me lick you and suck you until you come in my mouth.”
The taste of Harry’s precum mingled with the taste of Draco’s soap on his skin, a heady concoction. Harry cried out loudly, and Draco moaned against his cock at the sound, only making Harry cry out once again from the vibration of it. Draco wanted more.
“It’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it,” Harry said after they’d been silent for a moment too long. “I reckon love is hard to talk about.”
“Stop right there, Malfoy,” Ron cut him off with a grimace, holding up his hand. “If you’re going to force me to have this conversation, then I’m going to need a damn strong cup of tea.”
Harry laughed at him and reached for another scone, shifting in his seat so that one leg dangled over the arm of the chair. Draco watched him take an obscenely large bite, crumbs raining down freely on his t-shirt, and he couldn’t help but feel strangely lucky. God, he could watch this man eat scones for a lifetime.
“Glad to hear it,” Harry murmured, still smiling, as they tangled their fingers together. “How long since
“I’m afraid we’re just a couple of messed up blokes, Malfoy,” Harry said with a sigh. “But I don’t mind my own failings so much, when you’re around. You make me feel better about myself. About everything, really.”
“Yeah you do,” Ron grinned, leaning over and smacking a messy, slightly off-center kiss on her lips.
Harry shrugged. “Sadly I think it’s exactly the case here. Eventually we just grew apart. I reckon maybe she got a little bored with me.”
“Well, like I said, I wasn’t assigned to it; and sod off, wanker,” Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
Draco leaned back and crossed his legs again as he looked at Harry looking at him. There was something blooming in those green eyes, something primal that Draco couldn’t name. A swooping feeling in his stomach made him immensely glad to be sitting down. Suddenly he felt like he had just been dropped from a great height.
“...and you watched me. And you like my clothes.” Draco grinned to disguise his very earnest investment in this conversation. “It all points to the fact that you hopelessly fancied me.”
“Who the fuck is that arsehole?” Harry growled. “And if he were to receive a massive shipment of dungbombs, would anyone suspect your involvement?”
Harry lowered his hands to Draco’s hips. “Would you stop trying to get off me, you prat? I like you on top of me.”
“If I’m going to stay, I’ll need to return to work to retrieve a few more supplies,” he heard himself say, ignoring the rumbling of guilt in his stomach. “And when I come back, I expect an endless supply of firewhiskey. And another few hours of questions.”
“Mmm, I miss Pansy,” Draco said, realizing how true it was as he said it. He nuzzled his face into Harry’s pec.
“Really really,” he replied, and he couldn’t wait another second to touch him. He brushed a hand lightly over Draco’s bare forearm... oh fuck, his skin really felt like velvet. He pulled his hand away a little awkwardly, and Draco wordlessly held the teacup up for him to take. Harry took a quick sip before setting it on the nightstand.
Harry’s eyes bugged out for a full three seconds before he threw his head back and laughed aloud. “No it was not.”
After opening a particularly vitriolic one, however, which had been accompanied by a cursed Galleon that Draco had noticed too late, he had wound up in St. Mungo’s for nearly a week.
Draco nudged his arm. “You’re definitely not stupid. Just illogical, impetuous, and very much a mystery to me.”
“What happened?” he asked, very interested and not bothering to pretend not to be. “I mean, what was the final straw in her decision to leave?”
Finally, when he could feel that Harry was finished, Draco slowly pulled his lips off of Harry’s cock and sat up. He looked up and met Harry’s eyes as he swallowed the last of Harry’s cum, wiping a finger across his bottom lip and sucking it as he stared at Harry.
“Are you calling me a dictionary, sir?” Malfoy asked. Harry could see some of the strain slipping from his face and a hint of diversion taking its place. “I rather think that’s a compliment, not an insult.”
“I know I’ve botched two proposals already,” Harry muttered, and suddenly Draco couldn’t breathe. “But, since I’m already kneeling, and since doing anything three times makes it official…”
“I certainly can,” Draco finally laughed with him. “And I heartily accept your challenge to be as annoying as humanly possible for the entirety of our time together.”
“She was due back a half hour ago,” Ron answered. “What about your boyfriend, when’s he coming? And I do mean ‘coming’ in the more conventional sense, mind you…”
“Good,” Draco said, nodding. “And lastly, a skill you possess. Something a little less obvious than flying, if you please.”
“I should’ve given you more warning,” Harry admitted sheepishly. “It’s just that I’ve been away, and I thought maybe… Ergh, I know, I should’ve told you sooner. I was putting it off.”
They looked at each other for a minute, and when Harry lost himself in Draco’s diamond eyes, he wasn’t sure how he hadn’t confessed his feelings ten times over already.
“Yes, I’m sure you do,” Draco said, shifting in his seat. “Now let me tumble into my drunken stupor alone, if you won’t join me there.”
Harry laughed. “You really do. Particularly because I’ve essentially admitted that I’d willingly sleep with you at any given moment. And also because we’re suddenly very alone in this long, dark corridor.”
“Indeed.” She lifted a brow but continued as if everything was normal and her employee wasn’t having a minor breakdown in her office. “Which is why, as he said, he would only give the interview if it was with Draco Malfoy, ie David McKinnon, who, and I quote, should be doing better articles anyway, because he’s a damn good writer.”
So, I really hope you didn't hate that, and if you did, please don't tell me, because I am a sensitive bitch lol. Have a lovely weekend! :)
“Yes you did,” Harry snorted. “I wanted to hex you, and punch you, and push you to the ground and fuck you. All in equal measure.”
“It’s alright, dearest,” Draco said, kissing his cheek. “Mother assured me that he would come around, although I believe I’ve made peace with the fact that that might not happen.”
“You knew you wanted to be a reporter from the get-go then?” Harry asked, dismissing the compliment. He was too busy scanning every inch of Draco’s body for any further signs of damage or discomfort.
It felt incredibly odd being at the receiving end of a chipper greeting from Weasley, even though he knew it was only offered due to his disguised appearance.
“Tea would be lovely, thank you,” Draco replied with another polite nod. “But I’m sure you’re keen to change out of your work robes. Harry and I can manage while you’re occupied. As we know, tea is one of his many areas of expertise.”
“If it wasn’t obvious to you by now, Potter, I would do absolutely anything for you,” Draco said. “Merlin help me.”
“Lend him your glasses, Potter,” Draco fired back as steadily as he could manage, “he’s going blind in his old age.”
“It’s… Well, it was a hard time,” Draco sighed. “I was dealing with a lot. Suffice it to say, Astoria was there for me when no one else was.”
Harry wiped an unexpected tear from the corner of his eye and sighed. There was simply no hope for him now; his feelings were irreversible. And as he bit into the delicious sandwich, he replayed the last twenty-four hours in his mind to see if he could pinpoint the exact moment he had fallen in love with Draco Malfoy.
“I like mine with parmesan as well,” Hermione said, her gaze once again shifting suspiciously between Harry and himself. “Ron’s got some grated already.”
“No, no, not at all,” he assured her. “You have my word that I didn’t do anything to provoke him. I didn’t even raise my wand. It’s just… well, frankly, ma'am, I’m shocked that I appear to be getting off scot-free in this situation.”
“Thank Mr Potter,” she muttered somewhat bitterly, pulling several forms out of the binder. “Now, obviously you’ve been educated as a reporter, so you theoretically have the proper training and don’t need me to hold your hand through this. But I expect regular debriefings, even if it’s just a damned scribbled-on napkin on my desk every couple of mornings.”
“It’s not my fault you’re dressed for summer,” Draco chided pompously, but he let Harry’s hands remain where they were all the same. He supposed he didn’t really mind anyway.
Despite the less-than-ideal colleagues, and the fact that he wrote about the most humdrum of subjects, Draco was incredibly happy to have the job. At times he was even sort of glad to carry the title of auxiliary reporter (a fancy term for non-essential), because while he loved writing, he hated stress. Averaging one story per week left him with plenty of free time, though it was all too often spent serving as the newsroom errand boy and occasional emotional punching bag for the overworked reporters. He was fairly certain that at least half of his colleagues still thought he was an intern.
Draco grinned widely at him and turned to fetch a pair of seldom-worn joggers from his wardrobe to match the too-big shirt. He relished the feeling of Harry’s eyes on him as he got dressed.
After several hours of childishly competitive flying, they each apparated home to shower and change, and Harry picked up his sitting room a bit while he thought about how attractive Draco’s wind-swept hair had looked. No doubt he would show up here dressed to the nines, hair styled to within an inch of its life as usual, but he didn’t mind that either. Harry wouldn’t soon forget how Draco looked on a broomstick: carefree and joyful, yet somehow still as graceful as ever. God he was sexy.
“You really are the sweetest, you know,” Draco told her dotingly, and she giggled as she batted the owl against his wrist.
Draco just kept looking at him. He had no idea what he could possibly say. His whole psyche was in tatters.
“Alright, tell me a few of your favorable qualities, then, and we’ll see how highly you think of yourself.”
“You wish,” he grumbled in response, ignoring the thrilling rush of excitement in his veins. “Alright, I’ll take that bet.”
“I guess… it’s just that the stupid little things, they seem to grow and add up to big things, and I feel the loss of those things every day. Sometimes it knocks me out cold, you know?”
“No,” Harry said firmly. “Draco Malfoy, you’re going to listen to me right now, and so help me, if you call yourself a fucking death eater one more time, I will find a way to shut you up. Got it?”
Potter snorted and looked off to the side, dejectedly taking another sip of firewhiskey. “It never changes. Even with a glamor charm.”
“Just tell me, Draco,” Harry prodded, feeling nervous. He dropped his arms down to his sides. This couldn’t be about their morning together, could it? Or the way they’d been opening up to each other over the past few days? Was Draco having second thoughts about him? Was he questioning everything?
Harry kissed his bare shoulder and then Draco felt the bed shift, and all of Harry’s warm weight was suddenly gone. Draco whined a little in protest, pulling the blanket up over his shoulder to cover the sudden chill of Harry’s absence.
“Nah. Bit busy fighting dark wizards and destroying evil,” Harry quipped, grinning over at him as he reached for Draco’s briefcase. “I can carry this.”
Draco sighed in frustration, cursing his unceasing lack of self-control where Potter was concerned, and carefully moved his head from side to side. His neck felt stiff, but none of the shooting pains of yesterday came now. He cautiously shifted to his other side so that he was facing… Mmm. Harry.
Harry’s moaning was torturous, and Draco fisted his own cock, jerking rapidly for only a moment before reaching up to massage Harry’s balls. Draco rubbed his tongue eagerly over the tip of Harry’s cock, licking up a few drops of precum, and Harry nearly sobbed.
“Look, Malfoy,” Harry said. “I can tell your editor to send someone else if you’re feeling weird about this. I know I kind of forced you into it, but you honestly don’t have to do it if you don’t want to. I was trying to do you a favor, believe it or not, asking for you specifically.”
He shoved his wand in his pocket, strolled into the empty cafe, and ordered himself a hazelnut mocha, taking a seat by the window. The dark street outside was eerily quiet, and all he could think about were ghosts. As he cracked open his journal, Harry felt lonelier than he had felt in years.
Draco enjoyed the sound of those words far more than he wanted to admit. He shifted nervously again as he considered the offer. It really would be best to use this time, as Rosalind would likely be pestering him for information the following morning, and she would have his neck if he came up empty. And, as Harry had pointed out, they’d already agreed to spend the evening together. Why not spend it at Potter’s house?
. The same handsome face behind those round glasses. Harry’s face. Harry’s wonderful, familiar, perfect face.
“Very well. Then let’s proceed, shall we?” Draco asked, pulling his intimidating stack of papers toward himself as he took another sip of tea.
Harry laughed. “Yes. Really, though, he did resemble you a lot. Less beautiful than you, of course.”
of you. And I think that if your family will be hurt by our relationship, then I can… I can find a way to let you go. Because I would never make you choose between me and them.”
“But you like it rough more often than not,” Harry guessed. “You like it when the experience leaves a few marks.”
“Don’t you think?” Harry asked. Draco let himself see and remember the nervous insecurity on Harry’s face, so unusual was the look on him.
“Right,” Harry scoffed, his ears starting to burn as his hope fell around him like autumn leaves. “Well, that’s not exactly what you want to hear after that kind of confession, but thanks.”
“And I’ll finish it, too, if you aren’t careful,” Draco growled at him, breaking their electric eye contact and taking a much-needed sip of water. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him once more. He felt vulnerable and exposed, but he didn’t hate the feeling this time. Not at all.
Draco pulled his mouth away and grabbed his wand, casting a lubricating spell at Harry’s cock and gripping it steady in his fist before climbing on top of him. Harry peered helplessly up at him, and underneath the overwhelming arousal painted on his features, Draco could plainly see how deeply Harry cherished him.
Draco laughed even harder and reached over, giving him a playful shove. “No, that’s your job, remember?”
“I know this is too soon,” Harry said softly, his warm, loving eyes full of tears. “Way too soon. And I know I’m an impatient idiot and people won’t understand it and you have a dozen reasons to say no. But… don’t say no.”
He was a little embarrassed by his soppy lack of self-control, but at the same time, he didn’t much care how he sounded. He knew Harry loved it whenever he let such shamefully cloying statements slip out, and that was good enough for him. Besides, they were always the truth.
Harry couldn’t help himself; he released a loud groan and closed his eyes in frustration. When he opened them again, Draco was smiling at him in amusement.
“Fuck,” Harry whispered, pushing a lock of hair from Draco’s forehead. “You look absolutely debauched.”
As if Harry had summoned it, a letter dropped through the window only a moment later, carried by an owl he didn’t recognize. He dove at it and ripped it open, his hands shaking with nerves.
“But yeah, you can keep telling me things,” Harry said, repeating his earlier sentiment. “Serious or casual?”
Draco smiled again. “A mysterious nod is markedly better than an outright rejection. My fragile gay heart remains optimistic.”
“Yes, that'll be fine.” Hermione’s shrewd brown eyes once again flickered between them for a moment before she also stood up. “Well… I’ll send Ron out shortly. Make yourselves at home, Harry… Draco.”
feel as if you owed me something! I’m a Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake. I was raised to think that everyone should
“I’m fairly certain ending up in hospital with a potentially life-threatening head injury is not your fault, Malfoy,” she said, smirking. “Anyway, we Slytherins have to stick together, no?”
“I hope that’s true, because I’m selfish and jealous and really want it to be,” he said. “But I’m sure there are others too. Your mother, or maybe Pansy?”
Draco tried not to think about the last time they had seen each other as he knocked softly against the doorframe.
Draco looked up in confusion at Harry, who was straddling one of his thighs. He could once again feel Harry’s erection against his leg, and Draco felt like his own erection was about to rip a hole through his trousers. Harry was staring at Draco’s chest and Draco felt immediately self-conscious.
“Yeah, Uncle Draco likes manners,” Harry said with a smirk before throwing back a long swig of butterbeer.
Draco couldn’t finish the thought. He suddenly felt humiliated and vulnerable, two emotions he loathed more than almost any others. This article was his chance to make something of himself, something good, and he was fucking it all up. He was going to fail again, he just knew it… Oh blast it all, he couldn’t do this right now.
Harry shook his head and copied Draco by firing a bean at his head with his wand. “That was not a criticism in any way, shape, or form. I love getting to know you. I wish you’d share more, honestly.”
Harry threw his head back and laughed. “Yeah, I really liked all of the two compliments you’ve given me in my entire life.”
“Harry, butterbeer?” Ron asked as he flung a loud-patterned tea towel over his shoulder like a pro. “How about you, Malfoy?"
Draco knew that to most of wizardkind, he would always be nothing more than a universally hated Death Eater. He accepted it, but being reminded of it was disheartening.
“You really do make things difficult for yourself sometimes, don’t you?” Draco asked, smiling a little sadly at him as he finally set the milk down on the tea tray beside Harry.
“Technically it’s been ten years,” Harry countered. “Don’t forget that we’ve both been taking notes on each other for half our lives. Maybe this isn’t quite as new as it might seem.”
“Do I know you’re there?” Draco asked breathlessly, working his hand faster as he pictured the scene.
“No,” she said, leaning back against the chair with her feet curled up underneath her as Rose slept in her lap. Draco, too, had tucked his legs under himself and wrapped a blanket around his shoulders.
“Why is that?” Harry was whispering as well. He looked back up at Draco. If it wasn’t in Draco’s imagination, Harry’s face was moving closer as well. Or was it just his own?
Finally Draco pulled away, and Harry fought to catch his breath as he looked up into his pale eyes. His face was, as usual, unreadable, but his cheeks were pink, and his mouth was open just a little, and he was panting, and Harry took all of those as very good signs.
Either way, he had to assume he’d never hear from The Stranger again, since he was Draco Malfoy, and that was just the way it worked. And anyway, on top of that, he’d said some truly foolish things in his drunken state. What man in his right mind would agree to go on a date with him, particularly after his forwardness last night?
He refused to let himself feel embarrassed about saying that, because it was so true. Draco had always known Harry was fiercely loyal to his friends, and he had been envious of it many times, including now. Draco wanted to be the reason Harry’s face lit up.
“And you never have to,” Harry argued, scooting forward to the edge of his seat. “Don’t talk like this.”
Draco’s heart instantly began racing in his chest. He nodded, more to himself than to Harry. He had known this was a possibility; the Weasleys had obviously not taken the news of their relationship well. But he had naively convinced himself that they would accept him, for Harry’s sake.
to manhandle you. In every way. Preferably until neither of us can walk anymore,” Harry growled, low and seductive, looking hungrily at Draco’s mouth.
Harry was dying to urge him to share, but he’d discovered over the course of the last week that Draco divulged the most information when Harry didn’t ask any of him.
“I remember being so terrified at the idea of you being hurt, being caught… I knew I would rather die than have anything happen to you. I suppose that made things rather obvious for me, as far as my feelings were concerned.”
“Do you like it when I touch you like this, Harry?” Draco whispered, almost surprised at his own words. Once again, Harry had a way of pulling things out of him.
Harry stood up and stretched his arms above his head. Draco gave up pretending not to watch his biceps flex when he did so.
“How about this, then,” Potter said softly. “We have a shitty history. We both did some really horrible things to each other. Why don’t we just acknowledge that that all happened, and… move forward. Not erase the past, but sort of… stop looking at it. Stop letting it dictate our present. Deal?”
“Draco,” Harry gasped again, and Draco suddenly felt the wet warmth of Harry releasing inside of him.
“First I’m a dictionary, now I’m a wanker,” Malfoy spouted, more amused than upset. “What shall I call you, then, you rather impertinent, uncommonly rude stranger?”
want to talk about it,” Harry clarified. “I’m merely trying to follow your wavy lines running about all over the place.”
Draco stared into the fire and wondered why he had never spoken these things aloud before, and why he felt so at ease speaking about them now.
“Yes," Harry sighed, “my family. My fucking family. If my family doesn’t at least try to accept that the man I love has faults, then they’re not much of a family.”
He told Harry about the first time he realized he was gay, after his second-ever quidditch practice, a fairly typical changing-room awakening. (Harry had admitted to a similar situation involving Oliver Wood back in third year.) He told Harry that he’d always wanted a sibling growing up. (Harry confessed to wanting the same.) He told Harry that he cried on his first night at Hogwarts because he missed his mother so much. (Harry kindly didn’t tease him for it.) He told Harry how much he hated the dark mark on his arm, and he even rolled up his sleeve to show it to him when he asked. (Harry said it looked like it had faded a bit in the last decade.) He told Harry that he’d spent the entire year before the Battle of Hogwarts trying and failing to produce a patronus. (Harry promised to teach him someday.) He told Harry that every day he desperately wished that he could go back and change so many things. (Harry felt the same way sometimes.) He told Harry he hated being alone. (Harry felt the same way all the time.)
When Draco tamed his chuckles and smiled over at him again, the blatant affection in his eyes made Harry feel like he’d just swallowed a Cornish pixie.
They walked the last couple minutes in silence, each lost in their own thoughts, until Draco stopped in front of his little cottage style home. “Here we are.”
Ron strolled out of the kitchen with his finger over his lips. “We’ve just put Rosie down for the night, and if you don’t stop yelling, you’re going to get a Wildfire Whizbang shoved up your arse.”
Harry sighed. “Maybe I… Maybe I was afraid that they would see it as a bit of a slap in the face for me to be in love with someone who…”
This wasn’t a version of Malfoy that Harry could easily reconcile with everything he thought he knew about him, and it made Harry vaguely uncomfortable. Speaking with Draco now, Harry simply couldn’t justify the way he’d treated him in the past. Furthermore, he hadn’t been ready to feel such a strange and overwhelming sense of kinship with the man; it made him suddenly regret all of the things he had done to Malfoy over the years.
But this was his Harry. He didn’t need to filter those thoughts; he could say anything he was thinking, do anything he wanted to do. He knew in his deepest core that Harry was his safe place; he had made that very clear several times last night. And Draco wanted him. Oh, how he wanted him.
He was (understandably, given the subject matter) far more serious tonight than he had previously been, however. While they were covering loads of ground, Draco found that, though he missed the flirtatious, cheery Potter he had grown very fond of, this was the real Harry, the very core of him, scars and all. And Draco really liked that, too.
The thought shot into his head without pause, but Draco knew it was another honest and true thought, because it felt so at home and completely
Draco smiled at him again, and he inched forward, snaking his arms further around Harry’s waist. "Oh, I do."
“Nonsense,” Draco said with a smile. “You must be within my age range if we went to school together. And you’ve already said you’re male. Nothing else is a deal-breaker, as far as I’m concerned.”
Draco sighed. It was now or never. He gathered what little courage he had as he stared at the half-eaten duck on his plate. He could almost feel Harry’s encouraging hand on his back.
Draco rolled his eyes again, but he knew it lost its effect when he giggled. “Having an extensive vocabulary hardly makes me hot.”
But Harry desperately needed to regroup. Between the intensive line of questioning and the nuanced comments, not to mention Draco’s impossibly handsome face, how was he supposed to keep up?
“Not a liar, per se,” Draco said, once again tapping his quill against his mouth. “Just… in denial?”
“Hey,” Harry said gently, taking a step forward and looking up at Draco; oh, how he’d missed those diamond eyes. “I’m on your team, Dragon.”
Draco merely shrugged. “You had me at a disadvantage. I’m sure the encounter would’ve gone much differently had I known who was underneath the glamor charm.”
He was well aware that Granger was objectively one of the least intimidating people he could be interviewing, but every memory of the way he’d treated her in the past loomed large in his mind as she fixed him a cup of tea with her wand. Part of him wished Harry was still beside him to make this whole process easier (well, wishing Harry was beside him was surely nothing new). He had to say something... he had to offer her some sort of apology.
“Hey, you didn’t invite me here to kill me, did you?” He asked it as a joke, but Draco knew there must still be some residual suspicion there, and rather than let it bother him, he only laughed. Goodness, it felt spectacular to be holding his wand again.
“Oh, I don’t know,” he said softly. Without even thinking, he reached over and ran a white hand through Potter’s thick black hair. “Now that I’m really looking at it, I think it’s actually rather lovely just as it is.”
Draco lifted a dubious eyebrow at Harry, but he obediently closed his eyes. Harry stared at him unapologetically. He was always so...
Sod it, Draco decided, pulling off his underpants. He hopped in the shower and rinsed the grogginess out of his eyes, giving his body a thorough scrub-down and washing his hair with care. He resisted the urge to sing, but damn, he wanted to.
Harry moaned into his mouth and he kissed him once again, spreading his knees apart, and Draco lost himself in the moment.
“Nothing terribly formal,” Draco explained, formally. “If it’s alright with you and Weasley, this will be less structured than a traditional interview. I was planning on taking notes throughout the evening, as more of a casual observer, and then to sit down with both of you for just a short time. If that's alright, of course.”
“Having him there, Harry, having him take over our home, torture people, force me to torture them as well… you can’t imagine what it was like.”
“I know that’s certainly part of it,” Draco agreed. “I was afraid when I told my parents this evening.”
The frustration must have showed on Harry’s face, because Draco’s entire countenance softened in remorse. He placed his hand on Harry’s cheek.
“Then by all means, hurry up,” Harry teased, deciding to make the best of the situation. Professional or not, he was still about to spend the day with Draco; things couldn’t be that bad. “Grab and go. And make it a fire grab.”
“Fuck you, arsehole.” Harry shook his head and laughed as he sat back down, only to fold his arms on the table and lay his head face-down on top of them. Draco felt a wonderful tickle of pleasant nostalgia in the back of his neck every time Harry called him names, and he didn’t much care how twisted that was. As a matter of fact, it made him want to do very twisted things indeed.
“Talk to me,” Harry muttered, his wide green eyes darting all over Draco’s face. He took both of Draco’s cool, clammy hands inside his own, and Draco already felt a little warmer. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want to tell Malfoy who he was. It was just that there was really no point, was there? Once this bizarre fever dream of a situation was over, Harry would never see him again, and even if he did, Malfoy would certainly have no interest in speaking to him when he was just Potter.
With one last sip of tea, he stood up, feeling as if the visit had gone as well as he could reasonably expect. Ron stood as well.
“Yes,” Draco said, pulling his arms out of Harry’s robes and looping them around his shoulders. He pushed away a black curl and did his best to commit that particular smile to memory. “But I truly don’t think bringing me along will help matters.”
The unseen house elves cleared away their bowls from the kitchens below, and the second course of Caprese salad appeared before them. The Malfoys somehow managed to consume the entire course without speaking a single word to each other, and Draco groaned internally at the fact that they still had three remaining courses to sit through. He wished he was sharing the meal with Harry, with whom he could always find something to talk about.
“I’ll give you a framework, then,” Draco said, coming to his aid. “One physical trait, one personality trait, and one skill.”
Draco forced himself to think of other things; Harry was unsurprisingly the first thought to flit into his head. He tried to busy his mind by coming up with words to describe the exact shade of green in Harry’s eyes, an impossible feat that distracted him sufficiently from the chills in his body.
“You have no idea,” Ron mumbled in agreement. “The things he was saying about you yesterday were bloody disgusting.”
Draco shivered even as he smiled, and he nestled his head further into the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry responded by burying his face in Draco’s hair. He felt Harry breathe in, slow and deep, inhaling the scent like a drug, and then exhaling in a deliciously slow quiver.
“Draco, you have no idea how demanding I can be,” Harry said salaciously over the rim of his mug. Draco nearly choked on his last bite of toast.
He set down his quill, and for a moment, he observed the top of Potter’s head, still nestled in his folded arms. Draco felt inexplicably peaceful as he looked at him. Merlin, Harry’s hair was very shiny. He wondered what it would feel like if he ran his fingers through it; would it be soft? Oh, what a humiliating thought. But, would it? Merlin’s sake, it had been far too long since he’d had a shag.
He had to admit that Draco wasn’t entirely off the mark, however; Hermione did seem a little frosty. Understandably so, of course, but it was discouraging nonetheless. Harry felt guilty all over again for springing Draco on her and Ron.
Draco finished in the loo and crossed the sitting room to his armchair without looking at Potter. Draco reached for his beer and noticed a glass of water beside it, which Harry must have summoned for him. Something about it made his heart stutter. He looked up to see that Harry was looking at him as he thought of dropped quaffles.
“Yeah,” Harry admitted. “The first time I felt that way was in fifth year, after that one quidditch match, remember? When we got into a fist fight?”
“Because you’re basically a living work of art,” Harry said, as if it was obvious. “And since you’ve really never had any kind of overtly sexual experience with anyone before, then what you did in the kitchen is somehow even more impressive than I already thought. Plus, honestly, I can’t fathom how you’ve gone twenty-one years without someone snapping you up, because you’re pretty damn ideal, in my opinion.”
“Let’s take a break for a while, Harry,” Draco said, uncrossing his legs and picking up his cup of tea (today’s cheeky mug: ‘99 problems but a snitch ain’t one’). “That was a loaded few hours."
Harry chuckled, but it sounded just a little bit self-conscious to Draco’s ear. He liked that he could already somewhat distinguish between each of Harry’s laughs.
At last, Harry sighed. “Fine, you stubborn arse. But I hope you know I’ll be worrying about you all damn day.”
Harry huffed in what sounded like an attempt at a laugh, but really only served to turn Draco on even further. Harry kissed him again. Draco’s every atom tingled. Kissing Potter was like kissing a live wire, almost too much.
Harry shook his head with a chuckle. “Honestly, if you haven’t figured it out by now, you probably aren’t going to.”
Draco sighed. “Well, I suppose I would take a supply of food, since apparently I’m deprived of my wand, for some unknown reason. Water. A form of shelter. Perhaps a blanket. Those muggle fire sticks... matches, I think you called them, no? And, of course, my portfolio and a quill.”
Harry gazed at him curiously, his eyes narrowed. “Why do I feel like you’re setting up a punchline?”
A few minutes later, Harry returned to his room and saw Draco sitting up demurely in bed, blanket pulled up tightly over his chest, holding a scone in one dainty hand and flipping through a magazine with the other, like he was the bloody Queen of England. Harry could almost feel a little piece of his heart splinter off and fly across the room; Draco owned it now. That was that, no getting it back, it was his forever.
Draco scrambled to his feet, sure from his head to his toes that he would always follow Harry anywhere he asked him to go. The thought was slightly less frightening now, but Draco couldn’t say why.
They kissed each other hungrily, making a mess of each other’s mouths, and Draco already felt the animalistic need for Harry deep in his belly. Draco shimmied further up the bed, and together they pulled the boxers off of him. Harry threw them unceremoniously to the ground and whipped his glasses off his face and onto the nightstand. Gently he nudged Draco’s legs apart, bending his head down over Draco’s cock.
Draco huffed in shock. There was no way in hell he wasn’t going to be replaying that line in his head all night long.
Harry moved away from the counter and suddenly came to stand right beside Draco. He placed a warm and solid hand on the small of Draco’s back and the world seemed suddenly concentrated in that touch.
“Well, as much as I would rather pull out my own toenails than have this conversation with you, Weasley…” Draco sighed. “It was only ever going to be Harry. There’s no one else for me. There never will be.”
“Good evening,” Draco replied, unflappable as ever, though he did grace Harry with the tiniest smile, and the faintest blush.
“You weren’t there when I woke up,” Harry muttered before he kissed his way up Draco’s neck and onto his ear.
“Well… your skin is much nicer, in my opinion,” Draco said hesitantly, and Harry’s heartbeat quickened when Draco’s tongue darted out against his pale pink lips. “And as we both know, my opinions are always correct.”
“I promise you, I’m not as interesting as I seem,” he joked, and Draco wisely chose not to respond. “Anyway, there wasn’t enough of a spark there to even get all that sad about it when it ended, if I’m honest. We just sort of hugged and wished each other well, and… moved on.”
“Because I was raised by two people who impressed upon me the importance of having the upper hand.” Draco tapped his quill against his lip again, a bit disturbed by how easily that admission had tumbled out of him.
“What did you just write?” Harry asked him curiously, bottling up his hurt feelings for later. Now was not the time to brood. Instead, he leaned over and unsuccessfully tried to read Draco’s tiny, neat printing.
Harry kissed him, as always, like it was the first and last time. Draco melted against him, Harry’s glasses digging familiarly into his face, and they fell back onto the bed.
All the blood immediately rushed through Harry's body and his ears started to ring. Oh god, that was
Malfoy smiled at him, a real smile, one that Harry had never seen before, and would have been quite content to go his whole life without seeing, thank you very much.
“Come on,” Harry coaxed. “You’re having dinner at Malfoy Manor tomorrow. I’m going to the Burrow. You can tell your mum and dad about us, I can tell Ron and Hermione, at least, if not all of the Weasleys. It seems like a good time to break the news that we’re a couple.”
“And what makes you think that I see this as a one-night thing?” Harry asked. His voice was very quiet.
He wrapped a white towel around his waist and took a deep breath, smiling contentedly. Let the man he loved see him half naked, then. What did he care?
“Five more minutes for it to simmer,” he announced, opening his own bottle of butterbeer and kissing the top of Rose’s head.
After arriving home the night before, he had stayed up late, poring over his notes as well as the transcriptions from his self-writing quill, and he’d managed to draft a brief but thorough synopsis of all the topics he and Potter had discussed. Draco pulled a copy of it out of his portfolio and presented it to Rosalind.
“The sex was bloody great, though,” Harry muttered, devouring the second bean to presumably wash down the dirt-flavored one.
Finally they gave up and broke away, laughing at seemingly nothing for a moment. Draco had never felt so overjoyed before. Harry filled him with light.
“Eight minutes,” Draco countered, setting his mug on the table and opening his portfolio. “I was going to be nice and order you a coffee, but it’s a good thing I didn’t, because it would’ve long since gone cold.”
“You’re all just a bunch of blindly heroic oafs, plunging yourselves into dangerous situations in order to either rescue people who don’t deserve it or haven’t asked for it, or else simply for the thrill of it. All in the name of some arbitrary belief that you’re doing the right thing. Either way, ridiculous, stubborn, and stupid, the lot of you. Vastly overrated house.”
“What can I do?” Harry asked after another quiet minute, and it was so heart-stoppingly tender that Draco nearly answered,
“Forgive me,” Draco said, softly kissing his hand. “I didn’t mean to ruin the moment. I was merely trying to be direct, and evidently it came off too harshly.”
Draco smiled to himself. What a completely sappy, ridiculous, perfect man he had fallen in love with.
“Yes, yes,” Draco said, waving his hand impatiently. “Your divination skills are borderline genius, etcetera. And then?”
“I’m not normal, and I smile too much,” Harry said, grinning. “Oh yes, your compliments have improved a boatload.”
As he was adding a splash of milk and two teaspoons of sugar to his second cup of tea at the kitchen counter and wondering whether he should take a cup to the bedroom for Harry, Draco heard footsteps moving up behind him. He felt an embarrassing onslaught of snitches dancing in his gut, and he didn’t turn around, simply because he didn’t want Harry to see his foolishly large grin.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, trying not to think about the bombshell he’d just overheard. “Is Rose still sleeping?”
Draco nodded politely at her, stepping forward and holding out his hand for her to shake. “Hermione.”
Finally Draco entered the stuffy drawing room, easily three times the size of his entire cottage, and saw his mother sitting on an elegant velvet sofa by the fire, a book in her hands.
“I feel like you’re trying to get rid of a bad one-night stand,” Harry muttered, a little insecure all of a sudden.
“Alex has never been keen on me,” Draco muttered enigmatically. “We’ve had a frosty relationship for about a year.”
After Draco had finished his first cup of tea, he meandered outside and watered the plants in his garden and his front yard, enjoying the slight chill of the early morning. He fought back the urge to pick a flower for Harry, because that would be entirely too pathetic. He came back into the house through the back door and walked over to the tea service on the counter, picking up the tea pot once again.
He clutched his hair and groaned in frustration. The war was ten bloody years ago. Why was everything getting worse instead of better?
“I dunno,” Harry told him, knowing he most certainly didn’t have a favorite word. He thought about it for a moment. “Eureka?”
Harry returned a moment later with only one bottle. He handed Draco the beer, the bottlecap already removed, and then, to Draco’s dismay, took a seat beside him on the small couch. Draco felt his entire body stiffen at the proximity, but he forced himself to take a sip of the beer and tried to appear unbothered by the fact that he could smell Harry’s mouth-watering scent. He still couldn’t put his finger on it; certainly it had to be cologne, but it was a soft smell, almost... clean. Fresh. Absolutely bewitching.
Harry laughed and stared at him for a moment, and Draco’s heart was beating too quickly again. He was expecting Harry to spout off one of his ridiculous observations, or crack a silly joke, or hit him with a disarmingly romantic parting line. But instead, to Draco’s dismay, Harry moved his body away from the doorframe and gripped the bottom of his t-shirt, yanking it over his head and tossing it onto the floor without ceremony.
“I don’t mind it,” he replied, subtly pulling his chair a few inches to the left before taking his seat next to Harry. Distance. “It’s more of a necessary evil than a pleasurable hobby.”
“Because you’re you,” Draco told him. “You’re the very best of men. The rest of us are merely living in your shadow. No one will ever measure up.”
Harry muttered unintelligibly, and Draco watched him until he heard the soft snores once again. Draco thought it was rather fitting that Harry snored, somehow. He even thought it was just a little bit sexy, although he would never tell anyone that, least of all Harry. He’d never hear the end of it.
Rosalind sighed again. “Yes, I’m painfully aware of all that. After all, this is the key feature in our ten-year anniversary special edition, one of the most important issues since Cuffe retired, the most important of my career thus far, and you’re a bloody auxiliary reporter, for Merlin’s sake.”
“Then you won’t get to ask me three questions,” Draco bargained, stubbornly remaining in his armchair. The last thing he wanted to do was leave now. He’d just suffered through a week without Harry; he wanted this day to last as long as possible. Maybe even forever.
“Indeed. There’s something mysterious and rebellious about a man covered in scars,” Draco continued. “Drives the boys wild.”
“Then we’ll just have to show them all that we make each other happy,” Harry said. “Everyone will come around eventually, when they see how good we are together.”
“Former!” Harry shouted, and it took Draco so much by surprise that he promptly forgot what else he had wanted to say. He shrank back a little against the couch.
No, no, no. He heaved himself out of bed and rubbed his eyes with one hand as he reached for his glasses with the other. They were folded up on his bedside table, next to a glass of water, and when he glanced beneath the table, he noticed that his trainers had been tucked in neatly as well. Harry nearly cried, because it was just so very like Draco to take the messy pieces of him and make them orderly. He sat for a moment in the glorious feeling of Draco leaving such a mark in his bedroom, as trivial as that mark might be.
And then Potter looked up and gave him a gloriously understated little half-smile. Draco felt himself grow just a little weak at the knees.
“Yes, you look thrilled,” Harry laughed. “Or maybe that expression is… happy. Or arrogant. Or frustrated? It’s still difficult to tell with you, banshee.”
“Look,” Harry said with another sigh, “I’m never at my best when I’m out in public. I get kind of uncomfortable. Usually I use a glamor charm, but I wanted-- I mean, I’m not making excuses, I’m just… Maybe we could do this somewhere more private?”
“I haven’t decided yet,” he replied honestly. After all, what was the point? If Draco found out who he was, he’d have no interest in talking to him again. Wasn’t it better to just allow the moment to be what it was, and part ways happily? However, if Draco worked for the Daily Prophet, and Harry agreed to the interview, wasn’t it possible that they would run into each other eventually? Dammit, this is where flirting got him.
“Then why did you trust me?” Draco asked, pulling their hands up against his chest. Harry could feel Draco’s heart beating under his fingertips.
shadow,” Draco corrected. “And I don’t know. Not really… I just… sometimes you’re so irritatingly perfect that it makes my imperfections seem all the worse.”
To his surprise, Potter laughed aloud at this instead of firing off a frustrated retort, and Draco felt a hundred snitches suddenly swooping in his stomach.
“Disabuse,” Harry repeated happily as he hoisted himself up out of bed and walked towards the bathroom door. “Hey, don’t forget to take your potion. And don’t follow me into the shower, now, banshee.”
Harry snorted and tossed the t-shirt back at Draco, who caught it with an agile flick of the wrist. Just to prove his own point, he pulled the t-shirt on and smirked at Harry.
Harry let out a “grr” under his breath and Draco’s heart stuttered. Another swift subject change, then.
Fortunately, nothing but the word escaped his mouth as he dodged toward the window and flung it wide open. The sheer white curtains reminded him fiercely of ghosts, but he ignored the fear; he was a champion at ignoring the fear.
“Clearly we’ve never met before,” he began, “but you obviously know who I am, and now you have something you wish to say. You have family who died in the war, or I bullied your little sister, or you hate my stupid face; whatever the case may be. Believe me, I’ve heard it all. So, go on then, say what you have to say. I assure you, whatever it is, I’ll listen, but I must ask you to refrain from using your wand, if you don’t mind.”
“Where?” Draco asked in a strangled whisper against Harry’s mouth, as Harry’s arms came down around his arse. To Draco’s surprise, Harry lifted him up and walked them both out of the kitchen and into the hallway. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist and swooned just a little at the fact that Harry was carrying him so effortlessly.
"You're probably right," Harry agreed, "but this won't be the first time he's rammed someone. He's built for it."
"It took them a while but I think they finally got the balance figured out between people assigned to tame the winds and those attacking. I guess we'll see soon enough." The bright smile growing on Harry's face betrayed his excitement.
“She thinks that perhaps it was me wishing for a baby of my own and my magic accommodating. Which, I admit, I have wished for a number of times,” Harry said. “I mean, I know we talked about adopting or surrogate and both of those are wonderful options but there have been moments,” he paused, taking Draco’s hand and brushing his lips over the pale knuckles, “when I’ve felt such deep love for you, for us, that I’ve wished we could have our own children that are just fully ‘us’, you know?”
“Yes, I’ve disillusioned the space just above the rooftops here. We can race back and forth, just don’t land anywhere, but here and don’t fly too high. The spell only covers about twenty feet.”
“Come on, sweetheart,” Molly said gently. “I am going to make cookies, and I need a helper if I’m going to finish them on time. If we work quickly, we can take them to George at the shop before we go to meet your sisters tomorrow, ok?”
Harry had found more than one sailor knocked out from behind even though the fighting was going on in front of them. Luna would smile and shrug as she called her little ones back to her.
The largest slice of his brain held facts on the pirate and his crew that continued to best Voldemort. There he created a place of honour for Harry Potter and wondered about his attachment to a man he had never met. Would meeting him be everything he imagined or would he treat him like a thing the same way everyone else did?
The clone did not worry someone would see his expression and wonder. Being treated as invisible had its uses, though he did worry about how easily he disconnected from the world around him. Most of the time he felt like an observer, numb to the cares and interests that filled the idle chatter of his world. When not numb, the pain inflicted on him by the living came so intensely he fought to disengage.
If you want to hear more stories about your godfather, you’d do best to hear them from the source. Mother has been wanting for years to invite you over for tea, as a sort of thank you for testifying for us. I think she was never certain how she would be received. Auntie Andromeda keeps telling her during their weekend luncheons with Teddy to just send an owl, but she never seems to work up the courage. It’s very unlike her. She used to be so self-assured. But she’s been different since the war, the radiant confidence she used to emanate has dimmed. I’m sure she’d love to tell you stories though. Thinking about good times brightens her. In moments like that, I see my mother as she used to be.
“And if I say no?” Harry said gruffly. After the blowup with Hermione earlier, he was too heartsore to deal with more pushing.
, well, doesn’t really feel like me, despite people using it all the damn time. Oh sorry,” Harry added quickly.
Fun in a purely self-indulgent way, he liked listening to people unseen. It was different from being ignored in a way he would never be able to verbalize. It was thrilling to overhear all sorts of random, useless, wonderful details that people told each other in confidence.
"He is ruining everything!" Voldemort ranted again but the clone no longer listened.  He retreated from the sterile world of the lab to another; one he built himself. Here, he took the name of Harry Potter and hid it among his treasures.
Harry’s breaths came in short hiccups and he slowly unfurled his fists and wrapped his arms around his own body in a stance reminiscent of the many times in his life that he’d had only himself to find comfort in. He was tired, tired of being angry, tired of fighting, tired of crying, just so fucking tired. His eyes squeezed tight as he fought the sobs that threatened to break through.
“And I’ll tell you all the gory details, I promise. First though, would you help me get dinner on the table?”
His things were placed on a shelf near the spot he stood when he wasn't being poked and prodded. After a visit from Draco where the two of them exchanged almost identical expressions of disdain, one of the techs checked his stack of items.
In the quiet of the night the lab emptied, leaving the clone blissfully alone. He spent his time wandering the series of rooms that made up his whole world. A journal, left out and open, written by one of the old masters, contained magical theory for the dark spells a scholar used in an experiment.
They both knew how true that was. Only a lunatic would ram one wooden ship into another at high speed in the middle of the ocean. The one thing no one accused Sirius of being, since his time in Azkaban, was sane.
“Give me a minute,” Harry said and lifted up just a few feet, then waved his wand in a complex pattern to his right and then his left. Touching back down, he sleeved his wand and smiled. “You up for a race?”
“That’s a muggle barbecue,” Harry said, walking over and lifting the lid. Draco followed and looked at the strange contraption over Harry’s shoulder. “You light a fire in it and cook food. I’ll make you something soon, if you like.”
Harry sighed. “Because I didn't want to upset you. I hoped you'd just go and wouldn't have to know I'd overheard anything. I knew you'd overreact.”
This was an expression he caught his own face making, mirrored off shiny beakers and burner plates, usually in response to Voldemort's presence. The clone was unsure what he had done to make the young Malfoy view him in such a way as he remembered nothing before that moment.
Harry got up from the chair and let Draco help him into his coat. The gesture melted his heart, like all the kind things Draco did for him. As he turned and adjusted the coat on his shoulders, he was caught in one of those moments where you are just so in love you can barely contain it.
The clone never bothered to learn any of the names of the other occupants in the lab. That seemed fair to him, as they hadn't cared enough to give him one.
“It’s certainly not common,” Dr. Smithers responded. “In fact, it’s never happened this easily for any of my patients before, but it’s certainly happening now. Congratulations gentlemen.”
(For those who struggle with graphics or listen to stories using audio assisting devices, here’s what’s in the graphic.)
As Harry’s voice broke, Draco slipped from his chair and dropped to his knees. He laid his head in Harry’s lap and pressed his face to Harry's belly.
Later that night, Harry wrote a note to Hermione and apologised for their fight before falling into an exhausted, but restful sleep.
“Harry,” Kingsley’s voice carried through the empty hall, “would you get the Malfoys? There’s been a development.”
Harry could hardly believe that it was finally coming to an end. Nearly three months after the Malfoys had come to him looking for a place to hide, the trials were finally ending, today, and this nightmare would all be over.
Later that morning, Scorpius was running across the lawn towards Harry. “Daddy, I want Papa!" The soft whimper and accompanying snuffles broke Harry’s heart.
Sweet Merlin's pants was I right about that shirt! I’m inclined to forbid you to wear it out, for fear you’ll catch some wizard’s eye, and he’ll try to get in your pants. I couldn’t bear to watch that. This might come as a surprise to you, but I don’t share my toys well. You think you have issues, my entire life could be described with the words, “does not play well with others”. I have no idea how you don’t see how bloody gorgeous you are, everywhere you go, people turn their heads to look at you, and I assure you it is not just because you are Harry Potter. People are constantly checking out your arse from behind, even before they know who you are.
He stood staring into the dark and ached.  He had wanted someone like that, a person that would be his other half.
“Cookies and Unca Georges?” Scorpius’ voice was timid but interested, and when Molly held out her hands, Scorpius turned and put his hands on Harry’s cheeks. “You promise I can see Papa t’morrow?”
“Harry,” Draco said, looking around as if he was just beginning to process all of the preparations in the kitchen and the dining room which was visible through the large archway.
“No one left behind,” Harry called but need not have bothered. Pirate brothers were already picking up their fallen comrades.
"Our turn," Harry said. His vessel moved across the water like the fire bird she was, charging into the fray. His boarding crew stood at the ready. Knives, axes, swords and pistols decorated their hips. Even Pettigrew had a couple of knives tied to his belt. Someone must have helped him, because the knots were expertly done. Thick leather bracers with iron plating covered every forearm.
It was a foolish notion.  He stared into the faces of certain death, at the men looking back, waiting to kill him, and intellectually knew his life was over.  But he could not help how he felt, that somehow there would be something beyond this moment.
Draco’s eyes looked up, his brow furrowed. “For an upset stomach? I think not. I’ll be fine with just some rest.”
Harry chuckled. “Papa makes them better than I do but I’ll do my best, ok? You can help me and in a little while, we’ll go and see if Papa is up for some soup.”
“Yes, it is, and of course you can call us anytime. I’m sorry we can’t stay here with you, Harry, but I have two weeks to prepare before I report for orientation,” Hermione said.
“Why? I mean, why me?” Harry asked. “Was it just the whole ‘I’m a hero even though I’ve no clue why or any memory of it’?”
Draco Malfoy was the first to refer to him as an 'it' rather than a person. The first time the clone blinked open his eyes, he saw Draco's face. At the time, the clone hadn't realized the pale pointy visage perfectly reflected his own. His first memory was staring at the original of his features screwed up in a look of disgust.
Harry sat at the kitchen table, his heart pounding and his mind whirling. He revisited what he’d heard in the pantry and what Narcissa Malfoy had confided in their conversation and found a new perspective and a jolt of sympathy for his former nemesis. He was ashamed that he’d never even considered that there might be an alternative truth, reasons for Draco’s behaviour that would explain, if not excuse, his decisions. Harry exhaled heavily as he contemplated himself in Draco’s place. What would he have done to save his mother? He knew, with a wry smile, that he’d have done anything to save her, to still have her with him, even sacrificing his own future. It was a strange feeling, realising that he and Draco had that in common. His thoughts turned to his own life, to his best friends, his found family and how lucky he was to have so many people in his life and the freedom to do whatever he wanted, be whatever he wanted to be.
Harry stared for a long time, barely noticing the tight grip Draco had on his hand. They were beautiful, his daughters, their daughters. Finally, one of his hands came up and wiped away the tears that had started to fall. “Merlin, we have two baby girls,” he breathed.
“Something else to consider that might make this easier: They have probably rarely had to work for anything but they have a lot of knowledge about pureblood stuff, like old Wizarding houses. You could make them help you finally whip this place into shape. It wasn’t a priority before, but now, well, just something to think about.”
"See you on the other side!" Sirius called to Harry with a wave and whoop of excitement. For having such a dominant personality, Sirius was a small man. He stood on his tiptoes, hat held high, straight black hair in a wild explosion around his head, to be sure his adopted nephew saw him. Harry waved back, a fond grin at his uncle's antics.
“We know that when my mum sacrificed herself for me, it gave me protection. Hermione thinks maybe it gave me more than that, that perhaps she gave me her actual magic. She was standing right in front of me and the curse passed through her to me. If her magic left her and latched onto me, it would make sense, explain the crazy things I’ve been able to do. Remus was surprised how quickly I summoned a fully corporeal Patronus and then I survived not only being an actual Horcrux but the killing curse a second time.”
"Fire as your guns bear! An extra portion of the spoils to every gun crew that lands a hit!" Then came the echoing command of "Fire! Fire! Fire!" as one cannon after another got a clear shot at the approaching enemy.
. It drove me spare, so I just stayed home and immediately missed being outside, so I started working on this. Flitwick helped me set the charms to disillusion it and to block out the lights so I could see the stars, the rest was easy.”
Harry was still holding Draco's hand, and both men nodded, Draco's grip tightening. Dr. Smithers waved his wand over Draco’s belly and a 3-D image appeared in the air.
Breakfast was an uneventful but awkward affair. After some unsuccessful attempts at polite conversation, Harry was glad when it was over and they could all leave the table.
They both turned back toward the stars, and Draco didn’t even try to fight the smile on his face, still holding Harry’s hand. Merlin.
That had not been the first time the ghost made the odd choice to fly into that wall. It was not along the outside where the sun streamed in nor by the door. The door always stayed locked and only opened either from inside or out with a key.
Draco paced the length of the sitting room, muttering under his breath. His pale skin had a pink undertone which grew darker by the minute. He was visibly stressed because he and his mother had been ordered to stay in hiding ‘as a precaution’ during these last few days of the trials while Lucius was in front of the Wizengamot in his role as key witness.
Long-term, however, he needed a place of his own to stash whatever he was in the process of absorbing. And more importantly, somewhere to practice. As his spell casting got more advanced, so did the miscasts when he got something wrong. The results of his failures got harder to hide.
The battle to retrieve Harry’s body lasted until sunset.  The pirates fled the area with great reluctance, driven off by the marines and the one ship they could not manage to sink.  Fred and George had indeed broken Harry’s combat spell record, having battled all day to retrieve the remains of the man they had all followed.  No one mentioned it.  It felt wrong, just one more way they had lost him.
When you put one hand on my arse wrapped the other around my neck, I didn’t know what to do. I just froze… I… nobody’s ever tried to devour me like that. I felt you against my hip and I was so… surprised. I didn’t think… I…
“No, you aren’t,” Harry said bitterly. “My mother and father died at the hands of the maniac who you two supported, and there’s no bringing them back. I’m glad you all survived, and I appreciate Lucius testifying to put the Death Eaters away, but when this is over, you all will go home together as a family and I’ll…” Harry’s voice broke and he clamped his lips together, determined not to break down in front of the Malfoy matriarch.
A treasure all its own lay behind; a passageway, dusty with disuse. Nothing seemed more beautiful. It was a way out, some place new to explore. His world got much bigger. Dust meant neglect. Did anyone but Voldemort know about these passages?
It was to that empty spot in his life that Harry addressed his final thought.  “I wish I could have met you,” he whispered to the formless void.  “I wish I had been given a chance to know your name.”
“Okay, not Muggles, a Muggle holiday I’m not familiar with perhaps? No? Hmm, okay. A picnic, celebrating with a summer picnic in the dead of winter? No. Okay, let’s break this down. You aren’t sick. Special dinner with the good china and balloons. Muggle candy, barbecue, baby greens salad, baby vegetables, buns in the-”
doing whatever I wanted or thought I should.  I guess I just never spared my professors any thought other than to try and avoid them or stay awake
Funny thing. We can send all these honest and vulnerable thoughts back and forth and then spend three nights of rounds together this week and never discuss my lack of reply to your letter. Heaven knows what was going through your head.
“Not before a shower and breakfast, you cretin,” Draco snapped, his sharp words accompanied by a gentle cuddle and then a nudge up.
Draco narrowed his eyes slightly, seemingly contemplating the situation, before he took the bottle of juice and two glasses into the dining room. Harry just smiled and carried the steaming platter of ribs to the table.
With nothing else pressing that demanded his time, his long fingers traced the dimension of the shelves again. The wood gave slightly under the chalky paint.
The clone pressed himself against the cold stone as the others scrambled away. No one wanted to risk being touched. The lanterns flickered and went out. Light came in from the small windows lining the ceiling and enabled him to see the disembodied dark lord fling himself through a far wall.
“I can walk. Merlin.” Draco groused but he got up slowly, reaching back for Harry’s arm to steady himself when the lightheadedness hit hard. Harry eased him back onto the sofa and went to grab their cloaks. Both now properly attired, and Draco back on his feet, Harry wrapped his arms around his husband’s slender frame and apparated them to St. Mungo’s entrance.
“They are very good,” Harry assured him as Draco finally took his seat. “So, have you guessed the theme of our dinner yet?”
“Yes, two of them. Your daughters, gentlemen.” The doctor stilled the image so that the babies’ faces were turned toward their dads.
Hearing Draco whimper beside him broke Harry out of his reverie, and he turned to see Draco quietly falling apart. “Oh love, it’s ok. Just let it out.” He held his husband close, then lifted his eyes to the doctor in search of any directions.
“I’m ok but you’re right, it is lasting longer and so is everything else. I guess every pregnancy is different,” Draco mused. “I’m just-, Merlin, I'm tired and I swear I grow a size every day.”
My father, he told me that I was better than everyone else and that I should be like him, that there were some families that were better than others and it depended on their blood.
“Harry, Draco,” Dr. Smithers said, giving them both a smile. “The admitting nurse said you two were concerned. What’s going on?”
The Minister cleared his throat and gave the Malfoys a slight smile. “They caught the person who made the attempt on your lives.”
“Maybe not a size,” Harry chuckled. “But it's true that you look more like you're six months into the pregnancy, not four, and I know you aren’t eating that much. Do you want to go see the doctor? I can take Scorpius over to Molly’s or Narcissa’s for the day. We can get an expert opinion and let you get some rest.”
“I have a board meeting at 11, but I can take you to Mungo’s first. If you want me to stay with you, just say the word and I’ll reschedule.”
Thoughts of snuggles and kisses danced in his head as he slowly refocused on his book, but by the time he was several chapters in, he was beginning to grow impatient for Harry… and maybe a little worried.
Bravely, he leaned down and slowly licked his way around the base of Harry’s cock, over his balls, up the shaft. Harry was moaning almost as loudly as Draco was sure he himself had been, and when Draco flicked his tongue several times in quick succession over the tip of Harry’s leaking cock, Harry yelled out a string of curse words and a few more grunting moans. He clenched his fists in Draco’s hair, tugging almost painfully, and Draco slowly eased his head down, taking Harry fully into his mouth.
Harry looked back up at him with a childish grin on his face and then he laughed. In truth Draco was probably closer to an orgasm than Harry, just hearing those sinful moans he was making. Good grief.
They sat in silence for several seconds, just staring at each other. Finally they each took a long sip of their tea, glancing at each other suspiciously, until Draco sighed again.
Curious, he stood up, and to his surprise, he saw that it was Harry’s tawny owl, Ariadne. Immediately Draco felt the icy fingers of worry pinching at his chest. Harry had just been here; was something wrong? Of course something was wrong, Draco thought. It had all been too perfect and now it was about to turn to shit, as always.
He stared, enraptured, as Harry periodically wanked for a few seconds, then paused, panting heavily, only to repeat the process. Watching him tease himself was an intoxicating torment, and Draco knew they were both about to finish.
“Then fucking ask yourself that question, Harry!” Draco shouted back at him, unfolding his legs and standing as well. “There’s a reason you didn’t tell your two best mates that you’re in love, because in no world would you have kept that from them, had I been any other person!”
Suddenly horrified, Draco gave his head a vigorous but necessary shake and picked up his quill, jotting ‘
The sensation, along with Harry’s strangled cries, and the heavenly vision of Harry’s face twisted in unadulterated pleasure, finally pushed Draco over the edge in a blinding eruption of ecstasy. With an uncontained shout, he came explosively, shooting his cum all over Harry.
Once again, thank you for reading! I'm taking a small vacation next week, so there's a chance that my usual posting schedule might be disrupted in some way. I'll try my best to stay on top of things, though, and I am absolutely NOT abandoning this story, have no fear! :) Have a lovely weekend!
Draco strolled into work the following morning at precisely seven a.m., a smaller coffee in his hand than usual. He’d spent several hours at Potter’s house last night, asking even more soft-hitting questions long after they’d confessed to no longer hating each other. Harry had gradually become more comfortable opening up as the night had progressed, even readily volunteering details before Draco could ask for them.
Draco couldn’t help but snort. “Of course not. I swear. No coercion of any kind, you have my word… for whatever it’s worth. Despite your low opinion of me, Harry fell in love with me all on his own.”
For the second time in only a few minutes, Draco shot up out of his seat as if someone had hexed him and paced the small expanse of living room floor once, twice, three times. He stopped dead and looked at the bemused Potter.
“Well,” Draco said haughtily, “I suppose anyone’s hair looks good to a hirsute beast such as yourself.”
Draco looked up at him in surprise, but he quickly tempered it. He could feel every wall crumbling down around him, and he knew that he and Harry were about to see each other with their gloves off for the first time since Hogwarts. Draco didn’t care; he was too angry and too hurt to care.
Draco wasn’t terribly surprised to hear that, and it made him feel not only sympathetic towards Harry, but also strangely proud of him. It was incredibly courageous of him to agree to the interview at all, let alone be as transparent as he had already been. Draco set down his quill and levitated another jelly bean at Harry, and he grabbed it with a smile.
“Well,” Draco said, “our history could become too much for us to handle. We could start associating each other with our past memories, or find that it’s all too much to deal with, emotionally, us being together.”
“What is?” Harry asked, flinging his ankle up onto his knee and leaning back. He draped his arm unceremoniously across the back of Draco’s chair.
Unfortunately, the exciting shock of it made Draco giggle, which, in turn, startled Harry awake. Draco bit hard on the insides of his cheeks to keep himself from laughing again, but when Harry moaned softly as his eyelids fluttered open, Draco certainly wasn’t laughing anymore.
Draco studied him as he chewed, processing Harry’s words. He suddenly felt so overwhelmingly beguiled with him that, for a moment, he nearly let it slip that yes, he would marry Harry after all. Right this very second, as a matter of fact, should he wish it.
“And yet you didn’t tell them I was coming, because you assumed they would object.” Draco calmly stirred a spoonful of milk into his tea and didn’t look at him.
“Hey, before I forget again, here’s your wand back,” Harry said, digging it out of the side pocket of his regrown rucksack, which he had hung on the coat hook alongside his jumper while Draco had been occupied.
Harry’s heart was racing now. Everything about Malfoy was incredibly familiar, and yet it had been so long since he’d seen him in the flesh that this might as well have been the first time. His facial expressions were far less disdainful than they once were. Instead, they were… well, careworn. Maybe even a little defeated. He looked tired, but then, it was the middle of the night. Harry couldn’t deny that he looked good, however. Had he always been so…?
He handed the wand to a surprised Draco, who breathed out an elated laugh. He’d nearly forgotten the whole reason he had met with Potter in the first place.
Potter continued. “I’m sorry for…slicing you open. I’m sorry for rejecting your friendship. And I’m sorry you have scars because of me. This is no excuse, but I had no idea what that spell did when I cast it.”
“Well, we Slytherins are not exactly famed for the way we handle our emotions,” Draco said, leaning his elbows on his knees and folding his hands under his chin. “Anger is an acceptable outlet, in most cases.”
Draco let the information sit with him for a moment. He had watched Potter enough at Hogwarts to have seen him with her. They had looked happy enough, but to Draco, it seemed as if Potter was mostly happy just to be doing something normal for once, content to have found himself in a regular relationship, with a regular girl. Draco never saw anything much deeper in it (though he acknowledged that he may have been projecting just a little), but the whole wizarding world seemed to want them to be together forever. A fairytale romance for the ages.
“No,” Draco said, pulling him closer once again and doing his best to ignore that particular mental image. “Not
“I don’t even know what to say to that, you utter barbarian,” he said with a sigh. “Let it be known that I’ll settle for nothing less than Blishen’s Finest firewhiskey, which, by the way, is another thing that I would absolutely grab in a fire. And when I come back, Potter, we’re going deep, understood?”
“Does my chest hair bother you?” Harry said, shovelling half a slice of toast into his mouth in one bite.
When Draco stepped out of Harry’s fireplace a moment later, he hadn’t expected to nearly trip over the intoxicated imbecile, who was sitting on the slightly-raised ledge of the brick hearth.
“And now you’re agreeing with me. This night is so weird,” Harry said through a mouthful of chewed biscuit.
She finally grinned at him, though, to be fair, it was more of a grimace. “Honestly, I reckon your reaction is the strangest thing about this, Malfoy. He
Draco nodded, losing the last of his doubts in the summer green of Harry’s eyes. He felt the conviction behind Harry’s words in his very core. He couldn’t remember the last time he had ever felt so completely safe.
In the dream, he had been sitting at the head table in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, right next to Professor Dumbledore.
“Granger falling asleep on her feet is a good indicator that we’ve long overstayed our welcome,” Draco teased.
Harry groaned in humiliation and yanked his hand away again, mentally cursing himself for his complete inability to think before speaking. Dammit, and he’d been doing so well up until then. Sort of. “Right.”
He could tell that Draco was trying his hardest not to smile back; it was one of Harry’s favorite things to watch. “Thank you, Potter. It's called moisturizer. Now go to work.”
Harry snorted out a surprised laugh as Malfoy took a sip of his drink. “Damn, are you being self-deprecating? And did you just apologize?”
“Two, you make me feel much less in control of myself,” he continued. “Three, I can’t decide if that’s good or bad, but I don’t much care either way. Four, I don’t want to stop flirting, or stop touching, or stop whatever else it is we’ve been doing. I want us to continue just as we are, only with certain parameters in place. Which I think should be no sex, no snogging, and no dates. I mean, at least until the story is finished. Erm. Six?"
Draco suddenly felt as if he might faint. He quickly stepped back over to the wooden bench he had purchased last summer, which faced the small but bountiful rose bush that was the pride and joy of his garden, and sank onto it. He folded his legs up under him, pulling his knees up to his chin, and wrapped his arms around his legs, hugging himself.
“Plenty of people have given you plenty of reasons not to,” Draco said, squeezing his hand. “Myself more than most.”
He supposed he had to eventually, at any rate. Draco looked in the mirror once again and tried to fix his hair into something passable. He was only moderately successful, but he figured it didn’t really matter now, given the circumstances.
Draco scowled a little in disappointment, but it quickly turned to delight as Harry pulled the tray of macarons from where they had been cooling in the fridge and turned to grin at him.
Draco noticed then that the pair he normally wore were not on Potter’s unrecognizable face now; rather, a fairly stylish pair sat on a longer nose and covered his strange brown eyes.
“Look,” Rosalind said, her voice suddenly turning apprehensive as she paused and stared at him. “I want you to be completely honest with me, Malfoy. Do you genuinely and sincerely believe that you can handle this story?”
One of Draco’s favorite songs came on the radio just then, and he cursed to himself, knowing it would now always remind him of Harry.
“Loosely, it refers to a situation which has played out precisely the opposite of one’s expectations,” Malfoy told him. “Often with comedic results.”
“Well you pulled me onto you!” Draco replied, physically unable to wipe the smile off his face, trying to shift off of Harry.
“Not that I believe half of what he was saying about you,” Ron argued. “You’re going to have to prove that you’re worthy of him, in my opinion. For however long you’re in his life.”
Please don't ever forget that you are amazing, you are hot shit, and you kick major ass. All of the love to you, friend! :) (Unrelated PS, has anyone listened to Luke Hemmings' solo album? Cus DAMN it's good. Please go listen to it so I have someone to talk about it with lol.)
Before Potter could respond, Draco draped his jacket over his arm and made his way, dignified as he was able, out the door and onto the street. He regretted leaving as soon as the door of the shop closed behind him, but he was much too proud to go back. What on earth was he doing? This was his job, and he had gone and made it personal. Far, far too personal. He groaned under his breath as he continued up the road.
When Ron cast suspicious eyes at him, Harry realized his voice had not been casual enough. He watched in horror as Ron’s mouth slowly formed a comical ‘o.’
“Alright,” he said, smiling faintly. “Well, I don’t really know why I’m telling you this, but… to be honest…”
Regardless of a misstep or two, he was feeling much less nervous and, dare he say, a little proud of what they’d accomplished together so far. Not only had they covered much more ground than he’d estimated for their first session, but he had also managed to convince Harry to arrange a meeting between himself, Granger and Weasley in the near future. Potter had agreed after almost no persuasion, his only stipulation being that he also wanted to be present for said meeting. Draco happily complied, and Harry promised to ask his friends if and when they were available to answer a few questions.
He was unsure where his courage was coming from, but he was more than willing to ride the high as long as it lasted. He dropped his hand a little lower once more, so that he was tracing over every line of Harry’s well-muscled stomach, skin on skin. Merlin, he wanted to see him naked more than anything on earth.
Guilt washed over Harry, more forcefully than he could’ve anticipated. Was that really true? Hadn’t he deserved at least part of the blame for their enmity over the years?
Draco had decided last night that he would pay Weasley a visit at the joke shop, figuring that if the meeting was held in public, he at least had fewer chances of being hexed. Despite his conviction that this was a good decision, Draco put it off for as long as possible, spending the next couple of hours checking off menial tasks around his house.
“You prefer to bottom, don’t you?” Draco continued, desperately beating at his prick. “You like to top, too, but you prefer getting your arse fucked.”
“What if I’m not your type?” Harry probed further, thinking of all the times Draco had insulted his scar, his glasses, his hair… Draco claimed to have changed, but Harry couldn’t envisage anyone changing that much.
After the fateful meeting with his editor on Friday, and once he had wrangled his heartbeat into something resembling a normal speed, Draco had owled Harry immediately after leaving Rosalind to her whiskey. Mercifully, Potter hadn’t mentioned The Unexpected Development in his letter, and Draco could only hope that he wouldn’t bring it up during their first interview session either.
He let out a squeak of surprise and clutched Harry for balance as they stumbled to a landing on the floor.
As the witch had informed him would be the case, the robin’s egg blue door was wide open, and Draco approached it cautiously.
It took a few seconds, but when Harry complied, Draco could see that his eyes were brimming with tears. He felt his heart give an unpleasant jolt inside his chest and he leaned forward and kissed Harry without even thinking about it. Harry didn’t kiss him back, but he didn’t pull away either.
“No, stay, don’t move,” Draco whispered, and Harry fell back down onto the bed, back onto the pillow, back into Draco’s space. “I like your face in my face.”
“Or… you could just stay and hang out for a while,” Harry suggested, attempting to be casual, before sipping his water. “First we can have a quick beat-off in separate rooms, and then we can get drunk.”
“Yes, you really should,” Harry replied, grinning. “Your hair is very nice. Plus I’ve been told I should consider a hat permanently.”
There was a long pause. Then, as Draco patted his face dry with a crisp white towel, he heard Harry sigh.
“Are you going to do the interview, then?” Hermione asked as they all stood up and made their way towards the sitting room fireplace. “For the Prophet?”
Draco mirrored the nod, rubbing his thumb over the head of his cock. He thought about Harry naked on his knees in front of him, spreading his arse open... A drop of precum leaked onto his fingers, and he massaged it slowly over his prick before he continued to stroke himself.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco groaned as he snickered, yielding to the most innocent of his impulses and running a hand through Harry’s thick hair.
“By the way, have you two been getting letters from the Prophet as well?” Harry asked a long while later, as Ron cracked open his sixth butterbeer with glazed eyes. Fortunately for everyone, Ron had chosen to take the following day off from work.
“Pretty much,” Draco nodded. “We have another meeting this evening, as a matter of fact, which will likely be our last.”
“I need help,” he muttered to himself in resignation. He’d thought about seeing a Mind Healer for months now, maybe even years, but he hadn’t gone through with it. Maybe it was finally time.
"I want to suck you off in your bedroom,” Harry said gruffly. They didn’t kiss again, only stared at each other hungrily as Harry walked down the hall and into Draco’s room. Draco was panting like a depraved whore... and he loved it.
Draco laughed, joy bursting through him. “You’re absolutely wonderful. And let it be known that I believe our odds are far greater than just fifty-fifty as well.”
to fancy Harry Potter. He couldn’t remember anything ever being so important as the way Harry was looking at him.
“Fine, I said I wasn’t leaving you, same difference,” he said, smiling. “Either way, I’m not going anywhere. I’m never going anywhere, you stupidly gorgeous twat.”
Harry was right; only having weekends together never seemed like enough time. Draco’s heart ached every time they had to say goodbye. His head, however, told him that it was a wise arrangement. For the time being, at least. As much as he wanted to be near Harry every second of the day, this relationship was still very new, and the last thing he wanted was to scare Harry off. Once again he thanked his voice of reason for not entirely abandoning him to his romantic notions, even though that voice had admittedly been quieter than ever these past three weeks.
“You know, your voice got so formal in there,” Harry spouted nervously, giggling a little as he added a diffuser of loose-leaf tea to the boiling water. “You sounded like a real
Harry could feel himself blushing. “Well, at least that last one is more complimentary, if only a little."
“Well… to be honest, yes, we are trying,” Hermione admitted. “I didn’t want to take any chances with a drink, just in case.”
Draco blushed; it was a humiliating thing to say (at least as humiliating as 'kiss me'), but he meant it. And he realized, looking into those kind eyes, that he could say it to Harry, and not worry. He could tell Harry anything.
Draco counted to five in an attempt to calm himself. After a long pause, Harry continued in a slightly less menacing voice.
Potter laughed again, this time looking over at Draco as he did so. Draco stared back, and for the first time he realized he was smiling again, smiling back at Potter as if they were both enjoying themselves.
“And Ginny and I broke up last year,” Harry said, rubbing his neck again, and Draco was reeling all over again with this new fact. “Just after Halloween. It was in the Prophet, embarrassingly enough. I thought maybe… well, I assumed everyone kind of knew.”
“What else am I supposed to say to someone who’s about to embark on a journey, Potter?” Draco sniffed.
To his surprise, Harry reached over and tugged gently on his tie, but only for the briefest moment. Long enough, anyway, to ensure that Draco would be thinking about it for the rest of the night. (Among other things, of course, most notably
“Hermione quickly seemed to pick up on the fact that I was serious, so she told Ron to be quiet,” Harry said. “And I kept talking about you, and us, and then eventually Ron saw that it wasn’t a joke. And that’s when he sort of lost it.”
Draco didn’t want to turn around and see Harry behind him, and he certainly didn’t want Harry to see the tears on his face. He tried to wipe them away discreetly but he knew he was far too obvious for that, so he just decided to be Draco and be obvious, pride be damned. He wiped his hands across his face and sniffled dramatically.
He knew it was silly, but Harry couldn’t help but replay the whole morning in his head as he showered. Opening his eyes and seeing Draco’s angelic face, touching him, teasing him, talking to each other like they were already in love…
“Did you always know you wanted children?” Draco asked, opening up his folder as subtly as he could.
“You could learn a thing or two from us gays, Potter,” Draco cut him off, wanting to change the subject. “You dress as if you’re about to leap on a broomstick and take flight.”
“Yes,” Draco said evasively, bouncing Rose on his knee. He was rewarded with a heart-shattering giggle, and he laughed along with her.
Harry walked around to the other side of the bed and yanked his glasses off before pulling back the covers and crawling in next to Draco. When he turned onto his side, Draco was already facing him.
“Have you ever…” Draco swallowed, unsure why the words were wedged in his throat. “Have you ever been in love?”
Draco felt the epiphany hit him so suddenly and so obviously that it was no longer just a feeling, but a knowing. Harry was it for him. He’d felt it all along, but now he knew. Harry was the one.
The whooshing of the floo filled his ears, and Draco appeared at long last in a rush of green light. Harry dropped his quill and journal on the floor and shot to his feet without a second thought, practically running at Draco. Oh god, he wanted to kiss him.
“You did say earlier that you were a few minutes ahead of schedule,” Draco helpfully reminded him, grinding his hips against Harry’s in order to tempt him further. He dropped his hands another inch or two and massaged his fingers against Harry’s arse. “Despite having to wait so unbearably long for the shower.”
All the mirth had left Harry’s face. “He looked at me like I was completely mental. Didn’t believe it for a long while, actually, even as I explained everything in detail. Well, the fact that you’re gay, first of all, would’ve been enough of a revelation to be getting on with. But then I told them all about how I first wrote to you, how we met up and hung out and fell for each other pretty quickly. And then, when I told them I was in love with you, Ron...”
Draco smiled back devilishly as he licked his lips. Harry grabbed the back of his neck and pulled his head down, aggressively smashing their lips together in a rough kiss.
“Yes, I’m fine, Harry, I promise,” Draco said quietly, closing his eyes and leaning his head forward. This man would take him under, he knew it.
“Alright. So. Afraid, and why else?” Draco said, circling back to Harry’s reasons for not telling Ron and Hermione. He crossed his legs, feeling much more comfortable now that he had regained control of the conversation.
Draco no longer knew what to do; he was fighting desperately to stay in control, to keep his composure, but he wasn’t sure how to anymore. He felt like he was falling, and he was terrified that there wouldn’t be any solid ground on which to land. Draco had been searching for a safe place to land for far too long.
Draco rested his elbows on her desk and stared at the ceiling, his mind racing. He was missing something, and his brain was buzzing too loudly to figure out what it was.
Draco shifted a little under the covers. “Really, Potter, you’re far too lenient. I was a total arse.”
“We don’t, Harry,” Draco said, unable to help himself. “No one wants us to be together. No one wants you to settle for a fucking death eater…”
She sighed. “Then I suppose I have nothing else to say but to offer you my congratulations. This will put you on the map, you know. Might even buy you out of your auxiliary days, if it’s good enough.”
When Draco's lips finally touched his, soft as a whisper, Harry thought that nothing in the world could’ve prepared him for this. His body lit up like it was on fire. Every feeling he’d ever experienced for this man was amplified in their kiss: frustration, awe, attraction, lust, passion, curiosity, hatred, desire.
Draco leaned closer and furrowed his brow, a look on his face that, once again, Harry had never seen before. Harry bravely stared back into his shining, pale eyes. He didn’t want to look away.
Draco curled his fingers around his ridiculous mug and thought about how continuously fascinating Harry was. Was it any wonder Draco was reluctant to divulge any personal information about his comparatively depressing life?
Draco looked at Potter then and noticed in horror that he had lifted his wand. Draco instinctively reached for his wand as well, but then he heard Potter mutter a privacy spell, and then a silencing charm. And then, without warning, Potter pointed his wand at himself and removed his glamor charm.
“Do it?” Harry smiled, and he rested his chin on Draco’s knee, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. “Like sex?”
“Reckon you can handle another beer?” Harry called, his head in the fridge, perfect denim-clad arse in the air, not aware that Draco was walking up behind him.
“I’ve been watching you incessantly for a decade, Potter,” he said. “I know you better than you think.”
He nudged Draco back down against the mattress and moved out of reach. Draco gave a protesting mewl once again, pouting at him.
“It scares me too,” Draco replied, his lips tickling against Harry’s hand as he spoke. “I mean, all of this scares me.”
“Thank you, Potter... Harry. Thank you for saying that. But I’m the one who’s sorry. The things I did…” Draco shuddered. “It keeps me up at night. I’m so sorry for all the shit I did...and I am happy to repay the world for those things as long as I have to. I deserve this.”
“I believe you, Harry,” Draco said, fingering the thick hair at the back of his neck. “But not tonight. I don’t want you to spring it on them this way. They’re going to want an explanation, and… well, frankly, I don’t want you to leave either. I want you back in my bed right now, as a matter of fact.”
Harry sighed deeply and shifted his body so far back in his chair that he was almost lying down. Draco watched as he lifted an arm to rest on the top of his head. Honestly, Harry found the oddest positions in which to relax. Though, Draco certainly wasn’t complaining; those arms were really very pleasing to look at.
This particular thought was surprising, and unexpectedly sweet given the heat of the moment, but it fit somehow. Draco felt his heart stammer, but he smiled broadly.
“Your guess is as good as mine, and probably better,” she replied with a sigh. “Luckily, as you know, the Prophet’s employee contract takes proper measures against any theft of intellectual property. So, not only was he sacked, but if there is any issue with stolen information, he won’t be legally permitted to use it anywhere. In other words--”
Harry snickered. “For two blokes who don’t generally leave their houses, it seems like we have limited options.”
“Of course,” he answered. “Truly, ma’am, I’m very sorry to have inconvenienced you with all of this.”
He thought Draco looked a little ruffled as well, but he composed himself quickly, as usual, and Harry was pretty sure he was once again avoiding his eye. With an internal groan, Harry glanced up at Ron, mental daggers at the ready.
He heard the anxiety ringing in his ears, felt it buzzing through his fingers as he willed desperately for his mother to say something. He needed her to be alright with this. He needed her to love him through this. He tried counting to five, but it did nothing to help him now.
“Careful,” Draco muttered in a warning tone, quickly pulling Harry’s hands away. “Professional for a little longer, Harry Potter.”
“You don’t have to be anything but Draco Malfoy, ever,” Harry cut him off. “You’re plenty good enough.”
“I frequently do, Potter,” Draco snickered. “In fact, you seem to pull things out of me even if I don’t want them said.”
Ron smiled at her, and she peered up at him, and the look that they shared made Harry feel almost voyeuristic. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair and, after several seconds, he cleared his throat.
“I sincerely hope we never become so boringly domesticated as that, Potter,” Draco said, lying back down and folding his hands behind his head.
Draco looked up at him, and he was humiliated by how easy it was to get lost in those big green eyes. He took the words as a compliment, because he knew Harry had meant them as such, and Draco felt them deeply. He didn’t respond but distracted himself by flipping through his portfolio again.
Draco folded his arms across his chest and boldly entered the chilly bedroom after him, grabbing the wayward jumper off of the armchair and placing it in his lap as he took a seat. He scanned Harry’s muscular chest in his fitted t-shirt (oh fuck, his nipples were hard) before meeting his eyes.
“Oh, yes, he did,” Hermione replied, lifting her eyebrow at Harry, “he just waited until the last possible moment, as is Harry’s way.”
Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew these were the same old thoughts and feelings that he had battled against for years now. He knew they were lies, but it didn’t change the fact that they felt like irrefutable truth.
“It’s the highest of compliments,” Harry said, leaning his head against Draco’s. “You never stop surprising me.”
Draco felt Harry pulling his body in closer even as they slowly broke the kiss off. When Draco pulled his lips away from Harry’s, he opened his eyes and was instantly lost in a pool of shocking green. An embarrassing whimper escaped his lips.
Hermione rolled her eyes at him, but Harry could practically see little pink hearts floating between them.
“When was the last time you woke up next to someone?” Draco suddenly asked him, curious to know if he was the only one who had forgotten how the experience felt. He ran a hand down Harry’s t-shirt-clad chest and stopped at his stomach, letting his fingertips settle there against the toned muscles as he tried to ignore his already stiffening cock.
Harry wanted to wank just thinking about all of it, but there wasn’t time; his drunken self had created too many damn problems for his sober self to sort through this morning. Or was it afternoon now?
The feeling… Draco felt Harry fill him inch by inch and was so overcome by the profoundness of it that he nearly sobbed. He stopped for a moment when he was sure he couldn’t take Harry any deeper, allowing himself a second to breathe in and out, and letting the ring of muscle relax, and then clench. He felt Harry stretching him out uncomfortably, and he pushed down further, past the slight pain, until finally he felt Harry’s cock hitting a spot inside of him that made him see stars. It felt so full, so tight, that Draco didn’t move for a moment.
“Oh yes, all those heroic things you’ve done will always haunt you, what a tragic reality to live with.”
“Good afternoon,” Draco grumbled between kisses, roping his arms around Harry’s neck and twirling his tongue seductively in Harry’s mouth. Draco lifted his hips up and rubbed his body against him; really, Harry was so close and so thoroughly delicious that it would’ve been a crime not to do so.
When Harry had finished, he rested his arms over Draco’s thighs and looked up at him, a benevolent smile on his face.
But it was more than that, just as it always had been. He didn’t just want to fuck Harry. He wanted to sit next to him, bake for him, kiss him, talk with him, fight with him, be with him, learn about him, grow old with him. Forever.
“Because you have all of my worst parts,” Draco told him, frustrated by the truth of it. “You’ve been there for every wrong thing I’ve done. You see all the reasons you should treat me like a villain, and yet you insist on treating me like… Well, an actual human being.”
Draco’s breath started coming back in quick huffs, and he felt tears forming in the corners of his eyes.
Yet again, Draco rolled his eyes and chuckled at Harry’s unfailing determination as he ate the jelly bean. “No, Harry.”
Harry and Hermione both burst out laughing, and Rose looked confused for a second before joining along. Draco’s instinct was to be offended that they were laughing at him… until he realized that they were laughing
Draco glared at him, and Harry could see that his fists were clenched now, his chest heaving. His eyes raked over Harry’s chest again, and once more he licked his lips. Gone was his usual gracefulness, the lithe movements that so captivated Harry. This Draco was skittish, and nervous, and agitated. It was all wrong, and Harry couldn’t help but feel like it was his fault, that he really
And, once again, Harry was trying to convince Draco to join him at Weasley and Granger’s house later that night, when he would finally, hopefully, break the news of their relationship.
Draco laced his long, thin fingers between Harry’s, and Harry couldn’t stand the suspense. Draco’s hand in his was the greatest thrill in the world.
“It didn’t scar, did it?” Harry asked, once again picking up their conversation as if there had been no interruption. Harry was trying to be casual in asking, but Draco could see the guilt in his face, and for some odd reason, Draco didn’t particularly feel like making him feel worse about it.
Harry practically skipped over to the door with the knitted blanket under his arm and opened it up with a grin.
Now it was Draco’s turn to groan. “Dammit, Potter, you were so innocent back at that coffee shop; what has gotten into you?”
Draco just looked at him, still trying and failing to come up with a logical explanation as to why on earth he was still pushing the idiot away when he wanted so desperately to pull him closer.
Potter looked as if he had several more comments to add, but he merely frowned at Draco and they stared at each other again, breathing heavily. Draco was nearly getting used to all the staring, or he would be, if he could just stop being utterly enthralled by just how bright Potter’s eyes were. It was beginning to disturb him.
“You can dispense with the chat-up lines, Harry, I’m already yours,” Draco said softly, setting his tea cup down on the countertop.
“And until a few hours ago, I was unaware that I have a very strong penchant for bright green eyes and untamable black hair.”
Yes, distance, that was key, Draco thought to himself as he used his wand to sprinkle some more black pepper into the sauce. He felt strange, as if his body no longer belonged to him, like that time back in fifth year when Goyle had accidentally transfigured his feet into butter tarts.
cum,” Draco replied, snickering, and shifted onto his side so he was snuggled up against Harry’s body.
I am sorry lol. But I'm working on chapter 8 as we speak, I swear. :) Hope you have an amazing weekend. See you soon!
“I know.” Draco laced their fingers together so that they were pinning Harry’s hand against Draco’s cheek. “You would’ve been the hero again, as usual, et cetera, and so forth. As I said, predictable.”
Harry chuckled. “Because he looked like you. The whole time I was out with him I was thinking about you, and then I couldn’t
“Hey, what do you usually do at the weekend?” Harry said a moment later, placing his hand on top of Draco’s.
Harry hung his head. What a colossally stupid thing to say. Whose fucking idea was it to say everything!?
“I always know what you’re thinking,” Draco retorted, wishing desperately that it was true. “And when you snicker like that, it nearly always involves sex.”
“Years?” Draco leaned back and gazed at him over his miniature cup. “No, I certainly don’t believe that.”
“Very well,” he sighed, reaching over and grasping Harry’s proffered forearm so he could side-along. “By all means, apparate away.”
If Harry hadn’t shut him up with a kiss, Draco would’ve said yes a hundred times. But, now that he thought about it, saying it three times had been just right.
Harry took a sip of tea and licked his lips, just staring back at Draco as if he were a porterhouse steak.
“Why? Lockhart was handsome,” Draco argued with a smirk, jotting down a few more random thoughts. “A vapid fop, granted, but a handsome one.”
Harry chuckled and kissed Draco’s neck. Draco reached around to pull Harry’s wand from his back pocket and waved it at the kitchen, summoning the forgotten beers from the counter.
“Thanks, Potter,” he said, tossing a grin over his shoulder. “I’ll be right in, do you want something to nosh on? I’m afraid I don’t have anything comparable to the orgasmic treacle tart from days of yore.”
“Right,” Draco reluctantly forfeited, making a note to ask him about it another time. “I suppose I have to respect the rules, then. Do you like your job?”
Harry stared at him, green eyes wide with shock, and Draco could feel his palms begin to sweat. Volunteering personal information was markedly rare for him, but discussing this particular topic was wholly unheard of. Furthermore, Draco couldn’t shake the not-quite irrational fear that this would be what ultimately scared Harry away. Not that he had any claim over Harry; Harry was always ‘away.’
“It’s definitely not about any of that. And you didn’t do anything wrong,” Harry muttered, his voice gruff. He slowly turned around and kept meandering unsteadily down the narrow hallway, running his hands through his hair as he did.
“Yes, but it happened a few minutes after you told me we wouldn’t have sex,” Draco said. “I’m certainly not complaining, it was incredible and I wanted it too. It’s just… it’s worrisome, the things you do to me, Potter.”
“Yes, it appears you’ve once again roused my inner Slytherin,” Draco replied, and he could feel his face cracking into the smallest of smiles.
Harry nodded; the letters had explained as much. “They want my answer as soon as possible. And I’ve already put it off a couple times, to be honest.”
“Never.” Hermione wrinkled her nose, snickering, as Rose fidgeted on her lap. “And I definitely never wanted to, either, not even for a fleeting moment. Harry is wonderful, obviously, but he’s a brother to me. I’m positive he’s always felt the same way.”
“I suppose I can’t blame you for wanting to keep the relationship hidden, though,” Draco continued, shrugging dramatically. “Why would you ever want people to know that you’re dating a death eater?”
“Seriously, Draco, there’s realism and then there’s just pessimism,” he grumbled. “Have a little faith, will you?”
“What?” Draco asked, lifting his eyebrow. “No, you absolutely should not. And clearly you don’t understand me as well as you said.”
Rosalind smirked (she could give him a run for his money) as if she knew exactly what he was thinking. “Couldn’t tell you.”
Draco rolled his eyes, then gazed blatantly at Harry’s muscles. They always looked the most delicious while he was stretching.
“Alright, fine, you arsehole, I know I’ve done a thousand things wrong,” Draco admitted, desperate now. “I fought for the wrong side in the war, I’m the reason Dumbledore died, I’m the reason for so much destruction…”
“Stop,” Draco interrupted, taking his hands once more, because he liked how it felt, touching Harry Potter’s hands. “Stay here. Please, Harry.”
He was surprised at his own boldness for a moment, but he wasn’t about to feel embarrassed anymore. He figured since Harry had already seen every side of him by now, he might as well find out exactly how much cheek he could get away with.
“I dunno,” Harry shrugged, following beside him with his hands in his pockets. “Because you’re missing a week’s worth of interviews, I suppose. I just wanted to make sure you knew… where I was. I mean, that I’m not just blowing you off, or something.”
“Add one of your thumbs-ups to it,” Draco suggested, smirking. “That’ll knock it up to the full seven.”
Draco bit his lip. Harry reached his hand up and clumsily brushed a lock of hair away from Draco’s face.
Harry smiled. “Probably. Anyway, I’ve always been more of a relationship bloke than a casual bloke, despite what my dating history might suggest. I want to be with just one person, and I want it to mean something. I don’t like the idea that the person I’m with could just one day be done with me, or go and sleep with someone else, you know? I like commitment.”
“It’s me, Potter,” Draco muttered, removing his blazer and draping it gracefully across his low-backed barstool. “You’re not the only one who can’t leave the house without being attacked, though perhaps in different ways.”
“I don’t want to lose you either,” fell from Draco’s mouth, and he clutched tightly at the fabric of Harry’s t-shirt.
Draco sighed. It certainly wouldn’t surprise him if Harry had inserted himself in this case, thoughtless hero that he was. Even though Draco had always found it slightly irksome, there was also something strangely comforting about Harry’s inability to leave injustice untouched. He tried to tell himself that Harry was just protecting him. Maybe that wasn’t such an odious thing. Maybe it was even a little bit sweet (Merlin help him). And, strange as it was, Draco knew that if the situation were reversed, he would protect Harry as well.
“Well you took, like, forty minutes,” Harry whined, jerking his head away and looking at Draco incredulously. “Who takes forty minutes to style their hair?”
“Malfoy, come in,” she said, as she poured herself an obscenely large cup of tea. She picked it up and glared at him over its rim. “Well?”
Draco sighed as he made his way up the winding brass staircase and into the newsroom, allowing himself the luxury of lamenting his recent pitiful attempts at dating. He’d chatted up a handful of boys the last couple of months, in search of a distraction above all else. The few who’d flirted back were either taking the piss, or were unrepentant Dark Lord supporters looking to shag a supposed Death Eater hero. He wasn’t sure which was more depressing. He hadn’t even slept with anyone since… well, no use thinking about that now; he was disheartened enough as it was.
“Well, since we’re saying everything, don’t ever pout at me again,” Draco muttered, quite against his will. “It’s far too adorable.”
“Use your finger,” Draco murmured suddenly, without thinking. It came out more like a question than a command.
After ten minutes of furious wanking (he’d barely had to fantasize at all; he and Draco’s conversation on its own had fueled a particularly enjoyable orgasm), Harry resurfaced from his bedroom with a clear head and a satisfied smile. He’d put on a clean pair of joggers, a grubby sleep t-shirt, and a quick spritz of cologne, ready to welcome Draco back with a cup of his favorite peppermint tea (and a big hug, if he could get away with it).
“Of course I am, Harry,” Draco said truthfully, rubbing Harry’s stomach in reassurance. “I have no regrets about anything at all from the moment I responded to your letter, in fact.”
“I’m saying that it’s admirable that you’re taking into account the feelings of your family,” Draco said softly. “It’s heroic and selfless and very, very
Draco’s nerves finally spilled over and he growled, shoving Potter backwards until he was sitting on the sofa once again, a look of surprise and bafflement on his face. And maybe a little bit of arousal, but Draco was sure he was imagining that.
“So he tells me,” Draco replied. He could still feel Harry’s eyes on him; few sensations were quite so titillating.
“Oh, did you take your potion?” Harry asked, before Draco’s handsome face could distract him too much.
Draco tried his best not to stare at Harry’s arse as the five of them made their way across the yard after dinner, towards a little stone fire pit in the far corner. They must’ve formed an amusing fleet: Ron with an armful of butterbeer bottles; Hermione laden with a pile of flannel throw blankets while she levitated the mismatched tea set along; Harry with Rose on his broad shoulders and a stuffed owl under his arm (must he be so perpetually adorable?); and Draco tagging along a few feet behind them, carrying two broomsticks and his portfolio and quill, wondering how it would be if this was his everyday life.
“Mmm, yeah, I second that one.” Harry shifted and curled up against him, flinging his arm around Draco’s waist and his leg over top both of Draco’s. Draco adored it when he was draped in Harry. “Anything else?”
“Right,” Draco said, and Harry could tell he was barely refraining from rolling his eyes. “Well, shall we continue with our transparent and honest interview, then? I see we’re off to a smashing start.”
“Alright,” Harry agreed. He moved his body and laid back on the couch so that he was on his back, his arm behind his head, staring into the fire. “See, I won’t even look at you. A sacrifice I’m sure I’ll never recover from, but I’ll try my best.”
“I like it,” Draco continued, allowing himself to speak foolishly for the sake of seeing Harry happy again. “I like when you smile.”
Draco sat up and pushed Harry onto his back so that Draco was straddling Harry’s hips. He placed his hands on Harry’s chest and Harry automatically reached up and laced their fingers together. He could tell Harry was trying to look annoyed. Draco was happy to see that he was failing.
“Well, you said you had those weird feelings of being unsure whether you wanted to snog me or hit me: I had those feelings as well.”
“Prat,” Potter grumbled, but it was delivered with a smile and carried no venom. Draco slowly took another sip of his firewhiskey and watched Potter, something he had done without thinking since he was a child.
Draco’s heart stuttered at the sound of Harry’s groggy voice, and he felt his face grow warm with pleasure. “Good morning, Potter.”
Draco started to glare at him but then snickered, shaking his head. “How were you not sorted into Slytherin, you conniving bastard?”
Harry continued. “Because I actually think you’re really great, and smart, and interesting, and even though you’re a giant prick sometimes, I still really like being around you. And frankly, I think it’s rubbish that you’re so scared to be yourself around people that you push them away the moment they start to see through you. And I think it’s even more rubbish that you’re doing it with me, when you obviously like being around me, too.”
“Because I know you’ll do a good job,” Harry stated plainly. “I’ve read your work, I know you’re a really talented writer, and I think it’s pretty unfair that you only get leftover stories. Plus if I’m going to do this, I’d rather do it with someone I actually know. And I’m sure you won’t make me look too awful, because… well, I trust you.”
Draco, ever poised, lifted his eyebrow at Harry. “Please tell me you’re not the one doing my questioning.”
Draco chuckled. “I assure you, you can safely assume that I’m happy every time I’m with you, werewolf. How’s that for a flirty line?”
Harry laughed. “I think it’s because I don’t want to waste any more time. I feel ready to settle down.”
“Thank you for that, Draco,” Hermione told him, smiling politely. “Are you fond of cooking as well?”
“Yes, well, perhaps we’ll simply have to conduct our romantic interludes within the confines of our homes.”
Shakily, Draco picked up his empty teacup and hastily spelled it full of water. Taking a long swig of it, which went down like a handful of marbles in his throat, Draco tapped a finger against the teacup nervously.
Draco sat down, automatically wrapping half of the blanket around Harry’s broad shoulders so that it covered both of them. He cast a quick warming charm before folding his legs up under him and leaning snugly against Harry, who kissed the top of his head.
Draco gave the top of Harry’s head one last kiss and then padded quietly to the bathroom across the hall.
Draco spun around to catch a glimpse of him before he left the room, but Harry remained standing a few steps away, staring back at him. This was the first time he had looked into Harry’s eyes this morning and he quite forgot everything else as he got lost in them now.
"I usually prefer being in control," Draco told him smoothly, "but don't worry, Potter, I'm incredibly open-minded.”
“When I look at you, I don’t see your past,” Harry continued. “I only see how wonderful a person you’ve become.”
“Don’t be silly,” Hermione muttered, exhaustion evident in her voice. Ron gave her a concerned peek and moved his arm to her waist, and she leaned on him with a smile.
“Fine,” Harry sighed. “Although I know the only reason you really stopped me is because you’re worried about your hair getting messy.”
“If you think I’m going to expand upon that answer, then you’re sorely mistaken.” He took a dainty sip of water.
Finally their legs were glued together from knee to hip, and Harry could barely breathe; the pressure of it was both torture and bliss.
“Where the hell have you been?” Harry demanded. Now that there was no more cause for worry, he felt suddenly furious. Oh god, he wanted to hit him.
Draco breathed in and out, quickly, so quickly, and gradually felt himself rejoining his body. He had draped his arms loosely around Harry’s shoulders without telling himself to, his fingers laced together behind Harry’s neck. He opened his eyes and straightened his head to see that Harry was staring at him, an indefinable look on his face. Perhaps it was something like wonder.
Harry hesitated for a moment, but finally he groaned and walked back over to his chair. “What say you… who the hell talks like that?”
Draco expected to be called out for avoiding his emotions with more Slytherin ire, or at least for Harry to question why he was suddenly being not-so-subtly nudged out the door. But Harry took the hint far quicker than Draco had thought he would and stood up rather awkwardly.
He glanced at Harry before he left the room and noticed Harry looked a little nervous as well. Draco was happy to have a moment alone to collect himself.
“Well, why would you?” Draco asked. “The only words we ever exchanged were provocations and scathing insults.”
He gulped as he stared at the ominous paper; Ms Rosalind Peters, Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Prophet, was the only one who sent pale orange notes.
Draco smiled and nodded. “I’d bake a hundred batches of macarons for you, Harry Potter. And, as it happens, I’ve discovered that I detest baking.”
Those words never led to anything good, in Harry’s experience, but he could hardly find it in himself to be worried when Draco was standing this close.
Draco snorted. “It felt like kissing... my arm... but somehow worse? I can still see the face she made when I pulled away.”
“And you’re mine,” Harry replied quietly. “My favorite person, that is. But also mine, in general, I suppose. Just mine, in every way. That’s how I think of you, anyways. Mine.”
Draco counted to five, and then again, trying desperately to calm his rapid heartbeat as he paced the room. To distract himself, he reached for Harry’s abandoned pair of boxers and pulled them onto his body; they hung low on his hips. Harry reached for his hand, and he yanked it away.
“Says the man who complains that I’m trying to seduce him out of being productive every time I’m around,” Harry laughed. “You’re telling me you wouldn’t accuse me of trying to seduce you if I’d just stripped naked right in front of you and jumped in the shower?”
“I suppose you’ve earned it,” he said softly, before taking another sip of tea. “Mmm. Honestly, I’d definitely grab your tea in a fire.”
Harry groaned as Draco worked his hand over him, twisting and stroking slower than he had ever done before, as he lavished Harry’s balls with kisses. He skimmed his tongue lightly up and down the length of Harry’s cock; when Harry shuddered and groaned, he did it several more times. He sucked on Harry’s balls as he stroked his cock, moaning in pleasure when Harry bucked his hips and pushed against Draco’s mouth.
Draco felt his face grow warm as he looked down and tried to focus on the slow curl of steam coming from the spout of the teapot.
Harry made that heavenly guttural noise once again, and he fell heavily onto his back, staring up at Draco helplessly, as if he was drunk, begging for him through hooded eyes. Draco didn’t think he had ever seen anything so attractive.
“I don’t know! I don’t bloody know, Potter, alright! Because the moment I look at you, all hell breaks loose in my brain and all my words fly out my ears and all I can see is your damn green eyes and I lose absolutely all control and it terrifies me! No one has ever come close to having this power over me, aside from a psychopath, and it’s been just a few fucking hours, Potter! Hours! You can’t control my emotions this effectively in a few hours, I won’t bloody let you, you fucking stupid arse!”
Harry was looking at him now, pity and horror and something else evident in that disarming emerald gaze.
Draco allowed himself to shake Potter’s hand at last. He chose not to notice how happy Potter looked because of it. He chose not to notice that he felt the same way.
“Is my husband talking about shagging again?” Hermione came around the corner and entered the kitchen with wet hair and a roll of her eyes. “Honestly, Ronald, do you think of nothing else?”
Draco surrendered to the impulse to kiss Harry’s chest. “I’m sorry, dearest. I don’t mean to be so pessimistic. I’m just…”
“You were only twenty-one years old,” Harry said emphatically. “To expect you to marry someone you could never love and just accept it, for the rest of your life, because it was your duty… I dunno, Draco, you didn’t deserve that, and it just makes me really angry.”
“All cured,” Draco managed to inform him. He knew Harry would worry if Draco mentioned his now-insignificant headache, and Draco didn’t want to break whatever heavenly spell had landed him here. He placed a hand on Harry’s chest. “You’re my panacea.”
Draco groaned and gently smacked his own face once or twice to force himself to focus. He was really acting quite ridiculous; any self-respecting Slytherin would shake their head at him if they could see him now. But it really wasn’t his fault. Harry just did things to him. Mmm, Harry.
“And that is most definitely my cue,” Harry laughed, the tension diffused. “Don’t do anything illegal, you two.”
The first thing he noticed was, unsurprisingly, the ginger head of Ronald Weasley, bent over a short stack of papers at a worn wooden desk. Mercifully he was wearing smart muggle clothing and not the magenta uniform that the clerk had been wearing; it would have been a mighty challenge for Draco not to poke fun at him in that getup.
As a result, Harry practically fell against Draco, their knees knocking under the table, and he couldn’t decide if he was furious with Ron or if he wanted to hug him.
“Close enough,” Potter said, shrugging as if it was a closed matter. He took another sip of his drink.
This time Harry couldn’t ignore the jolt in his gut upon hearing his name on Draco’s lips. Yes, this was definitely dangerous. He felt as if he’d just walked onto the quidditch pitch, in the very best way.
“You’ll survive,” Draco murmured in response, pulling his open folder towards himself and jotting something down at the top of the first sheet.
“Engrave it on a plaque and marvel at it later!” she barked. “The point is, he’ll only do the interview with you!”
Finally Draco looked back down at his portfolio, and only then did Harry realize that his heart was pounding.
The inclement weather had deterred several would-be Sunday shoppers from the street, but Diagon Alley was still bustling. Draco did his best to remember that he was unrecognizable and wouldn’t be bothered.
Draco finally pulled away and continued unbuttoning his shirt, taking his time, basking in the feel of Harry’s eyes on him. Once every button had been undone, Draco pulled the shirt off of his shoulders as gracefully as he could and dropped it to the floor.
When he stepped out of the fireplace into his own sitting room a few seconds later, he dropped his wand on the ground and sat down heavily on the hearth as the room started to spin around him.
“Well, my mother was never exactly comfortable with the arrangement,” Draco admitted evenly, stroking his thumb up and down his teacup. “She felt it was wrong to shackle me into such a situation, knowing my proclivity was exclusively towards men. But my father was adamant, as was Mr Greengrass.”
Beside him, Draco released a throaty sigh, and Harry ran his hands through his hair, his poor heart going a mile a minute.
Draco felt an inappropriately-timed shiver of arousal in his groin at the demanding tone of Harry’s voice. He quite forgot what his next theory had been.
Harry chuckled and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his denim-clad knees, pulling off the relaxed look in a way that Draco could never hope to manage.
“Good morning,” he whispered back, physically incapable of wiping the embarrassing smile from his face.
“Cheers,” they muttered in sync, their eyes meeting for a second too long before they each took a long sip of their drinks.
Alex chuckled again and held up his hands as he turned to leave. “By all means, don’t let me get in the way of your afternoon delight. Remember boys, no glove, no love.”
“Oh, Harry,” he sighed, moaning continually as Harry repeatedly stroked his prick for a few incredible moments.
Draco’s stomach gave an uncomfortable lurch at the sound of his name spilling so casually out of Harry’s mouth, but he kept his wits about him and leaned forward slightly in his chair.
When Weasley had interrupted them in the sitting room, Draco had been on the cusp of confessing to Potter that he’d missed him a hundred times more than he’d expected to. Honestly, his thick, messy hair, bright green eyes, and well-muscled arms had haunted Draco’s dreams all week. They’d been dirty dreams, too. Filthy. And he’d wanted to tell Harry that; he’d wanted to tell Harry everything.
“I don’t know, something about lost souls in a fish bowl, how on earth should I remember?” Draco replied with a smirk. “I’m far from becoming a sudden zealot for rock music, poetic lyrics aside.”
“What about Morris?” she continued, staring at him with intense blue eyes. “Will you be pressing charges against him?”
“Are you… are you still okay to tell them?” Draco said hesitantly, ignoring the barb. “I hope you realize that you don’t need to feel pressured to do so immediately. I trust you to tell them when you’re ready.”
Draco smiled at him and proceeded. “Well, as you can see, I’m not comatose, so the damage could have been much worse than it was, particularly since the curse hit me from such a close distance.”
“Maybe only one more though,” Draco said, embarrassed when it came out as barely more than a whisper.
Draco didn’t reply. He didn’t need to. He slowly turned his head and fixed his diamond eyes on Harry’s. Draco and Alex… had a
Harry’s gaze flitted across his face. “You want to know what I’m going to think about when I wank tonight?”
Draco set his portfolio back on the table, not bothering to cover his writing up this time. Harry watched him stare at it.
Draco glared at him, irked by his flippant response. Harry had a strong tendency to see the world in black and white and ignore all of the vastly important greys.
