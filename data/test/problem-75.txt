Draco looks completely unconcerned, but when Sam fires up the engine, he shoots into the bus and pulls the door closed behind him. Harry laughs at him, and Luna thinks it’s only Benny’s stern reminder of “best behaviour!” that stops Draco kicking him in the shin.
“Yeah, of course I am,” he lies, stretching and smiling at Draco from the second best chair by the fire.
“Oh, aye, that’ll do nicely,” she murmurs, finally releasing Harry.
“You aren’t,” Draco says. “You’re extremely annoying.”
“That’s true,” Harry says, trying for an expression even a fraction of the intensity of his boss’s.
Draco releases him and swims away with an efficient backstroke, heading out into the centre of the loch. Harry follows at a more ponderous pace, sticking to breast stroke and stretching out his arms and legs pleasurably with every push forwards. When Draco stops and begins treading water with an alarmed expression, Harry calls out to him.
The morning is cold and crisp with a wind that blows all of Harry’s attempts to speak right back down his throat. In the end, he opts to look at the lights and decorations as they pass, and makes a silent game of guessing just what kind of Christmas Day each passer-by is having. The studenty types with their excitable chatter and huge backpacks are going home to their families, he decides, to a chaotic but love-filled celebration with Grandma at the head of the table and charades after lunch. The older couple look as though they’re on their way to church, with plans for a brandy-soaked Christmas pudding and a nice cup of tea in front of the Queen’s speech. The woman who stalks past them, snapping about deadlines into her mobile phone, doesn’t seem Christmassy at all, and Harry feels sorry for her, but then they are arriving at the hospital and the whole place is so full of festivity that it’s difficult to feel sorry at all.
, he reads.
“Who was getting married?” Draco asks as if he hasn’t heard the question, and Harry lets it slide.
Even though he is prepared for it this time, the spirit burns so fiercely that it steals his breath, stinging his mouth and throat with the rich flavour of aniseed, closely followed by pepper, blood orange and saffron. Head spinning, he closes his eyes and pretends he is sitting on a nice, soft chair in a completely calm room where there is no screeching of brakes, no pitching around corners and definitely no Ron standing on his foot. When he opens his eyes, he sees Charlie rather gleefully pouring a second shot for George, who had apparently been too busy pretending to be a pirate stag to finish his drink in time.
Louis looks to Ginny for help and she shrugs, pulling a dictionary out of her bag and flicking through the pages.
Harry blinks. “Oh, god, I hadn’t even thought of that.” In the split second it takes him to realise how disgustingly selfish he is being, he is flooded with hot, prickly shame, and he tries to pull away from Draco, but a strong hand holds onto his tightly and warm grey eyes burn into his.
“No, he’s just leaving,” Draco says, but Harry is already out of his seat and tipping twenty silver Sickles into the metal scoop.
“I know.”
Rose nods, eyes trained on Florean, who is now gliding in slow circles, wand arm outstretched to leave a trail of shimmering snowflakes behind him. Ever the showman, he seems to pull every eye to him without the slightest scrap of effort. Harry has no idea what sort of magic he has used to create a perfect ice rink in the middle of Diagon Alley, but he has done a wonderful job.
“Don’t you have a very important job to go to?” Draco asks.
“I don’t know what you’re so offended about,” Harry says that afternoon, perching on the counter and nibbling the edge of his Moroccan flatbread.
Felicity’s smile fades. “That’s right. He dumped me about a month ago. What’s that got to do with anything?”
With a sigh, she picks up her notebook and begins to write. She had, of course, suspected that there would be a difference in the reactions of crows and stubborn young men, but she’s not sure she wants to risk Harry and Draco tearing apart the office and then losing consciousness. It looks like ordinary Cheering Charms will have to do. She still has plenty more things to try.
When they reach the shop, Mr Borteg is waxing lyrical to a customer with his customary theatrical panache and they walk past him into the office without exchanging a word. Once safely out of sight, Harry pulls Draco to him and kisses him, cold lips and caught breath and a wave of pure relief.
“She’s been back and forth between Hogwarts and the Ministry these last few days. I hardly think that it’s that she doesn’t care about you,” Draco says, and the words hit Harry somewhere sore and unexpected.
Stanley looks at the enormous tree and wonders when the shiny balls and glittery strings are going to come out of hiding.
“Oh?” Harry asks, silently waiting for the customer to hang himself with his own rope. It doesn’t happen very often, but when it does, it’s immensely satisfying.
“I also shouldn’t have taken so long to come back and say that, but that’s the thing, Draco, I’m useless with all this and it’s just better if I don’t do it.”
“Yes,” Draco says, expression defensive. “I had a flat in London but it cost a small fortune and I was hardly ever there, so I converted this deck into living quarters. It’s perfectly habitable, you don’t have to look so horrified.”
“No,” Harry says, grasping the carrots by their green tops and smiling at him. “Thanks.”
, the life force, and channel it into healing magic.”
“A hot drink and something to eat usually helps,” Harry says as they start to walk towards the wonderful smell with Needle at their heels.
“Let’s get started,” she says, standing front and centre and beginning to work through the usual stretches.
**~*~**
“It’s a nice kind of madness,” Harry says.
“I have sacks from everyone except Flourish and Blotts, who only use crates, and Florean, who was so busy that I almost offered to put on an apron and help,” Draco says. “How about you?”
“He’s a good swan now,” Draco says, shaking hands too. “Mostly.”
“I’ll tell Hermione what you really think of her soup.”
“Don’t mind him,” Draco tells the goat, blithely ignoring Harry. “He’s quite harmless. Now, if you could just share with us the location of your colleagues, we might be able to conduct this operation in a civilised manner.”
Gareth just shrugs.
Harry and Draco agree that they are very fine bobbles indeed, and when the spell ends, Harry provides the all-important measurements.
Hot water is now pouring into the copper bath and Draco is peering out of the window, nakedness just about covered by the condensation.
Harry smiles then, just a little, picturing the wry glint in McGonagall’s eye and hearing her voice so clearly in his head that he suddenly rather misses her.
Trembling, Harry kisses him and rocks gently. So close. He holds his breath.
Draco groans and Ron instantly perks up.
She sits at the base of the tree and pulls out her notebook.
“Wow,” Harry mumbles. “I take it they don’t see her as a mother, then?”
“Would you really?” Harry says, all at once caught up in a tide of weariness so fierce that he thinks he could curl up on the spot with a cobblestone for a pillow. “I could call Hermione and just check with her…”
Harry grins. “Do you ever re-use them for anything?”
“You can stop,” Draco says gently, and her expression softens the barest fraction. “Do you want a menu, Harry?”
Harry stares at him, astonished. He knows that witches and wizards live longer than Muggles on average, but he still can’t quite get his head around the idea that a woman who stomps around on a moving bus and bakes scones every day, a woman who is currently sipping mulled wine from a paper cup and laughing until her hat falls off, could possibly be four times his own age.
“Is that right?” Mary Ann asks. “Well, I don’t know, but it takes pictures when you press this button—look, that’s my breakfast!”
“Business as usual,” Pansy says, voice joining his on the airwaves and creating a fluctuating pattern of green light in the air in front of her. “Now, while I needle Draco for a few minutes, why don’t you enjoy today’s Song for the Shower. Turn it up loud and make sure to wash behind your ears.”
Corrie laughs delightedly. “Goblins! Oh my lord… now, see, I’ve almost finished.”
Draco smiles slowly, eyes bright in the darkness. “Just across the hallway.”
“No,” Emmanuel admits. “But it would be pretty cool to say I’d sung with Harry Potter.”
“Are you hurt, sir?” Officer Kettleworth asks, taking out a brand new notepad and a pen, which he promptly drops.
If he’s honest, he knows he’s lucky to have recovered from that misguided episode with Ginny and come out of it with a sister and a friend. His other attempts have left him nothing more than suffocated and miserable. Single life suits him, and he has no idea why he would give it up again for someone like Geraint, who was so obsessed with Quidditch that Harry actually stopped enjoying it and who would sulk for days every time his team lost. Then there was Phillipe, who was astonishingly handsome but also the most boring man Harry has ever met, revelling in both the idea of
Harry sighs. “Ron’s working on it. It’s probably going to take some time.”
“Oh, god,” Harry groans, folding himself into a ball and pressing his hands to his face. “Is it really that bad?”
Apparently stunned, the editor stares after Harry as he stalks off down the corridor. Mouth twitching, Draco nods to him and runs to catch up. As they board the lift and begin to descend back to street level, they stare at each other. Harry’s eyes are bright and his skin is flushed. He bites his lip and grins at Draco. Draco grins back, feeling the amusement rising in his chest and letting it bubble over just as they stagger out into the atrium, laughing helplessly.
“Kingsley!” Hugo repeats, beaming up into Harry’s face.
“Ooh!” Fred and George cry as one, and the sound shakes Harry out of his thoughts, allowing him to admire their wedding outfits.
After the best part of an hour, Draco finally stops the bus. Something about the glint in his eyes makes Harry wonder if he has deliberately chosen a circuitous route in order to prolong the suspense, but he decides to claim the higher ground by not mentioning it.
“Shut up. She’s an old woman. Old women like things formal,” Harry says confidently.
Harry takes his seat, face heating. “You only came to see me?”
“What’s festive about a lake?” Mrs Purley asks and Draco sighs.
Draco picks up another set of parchments and settles back into his red armchair. After a moment, his brow furrows and he reaches for his red ink. Idly, Harry gazes at the other, rarely-used pots of ink that dot the floor around Draco’s chair. All the pots are almost full, and he has green, blue, black, and even a rich sort of purple that glows warmly in the light from the fire. Amused, Harry thinks of the chewed ballpoint pen that sits in his jacket pocket and creates the spidery handwriting that makes Draco want to murder him a little bit.
The thought is pushed out of his mind as he carries the requested extra chairs to the table and then finally sits down with his family to eat. Molly’s roasts are enough to make any irritating puzzles disappear, and besides, Ron and Hermione seem intent on talking about Draco.
Harry grins. “Well, not yet. Look, I’d better go—I’ll talk to you afterwards. You can meet the biddies.”
“Just nipping across the street for a minute,” he calls, putting on his coat.
“Take a giggle break,” Mr Borteg’s bracelet says loudly, and a ripple of laughter passes around the table.
“Yes!” Draco says, taking off his coat and draping it over one arm. “You have taken charge of this ridiculous situation and you need to finish what you started.”
“Is that why you’re here?” Potter asks, walking past Draco and behind the counter. “You’ve come to tell me you think I’m mad? Join the queue, Draco. It’s that way.”
“Good.” She sips her tea and pets Needle gently on the head. “Would you like to sit down?”
“I’m learning to be patient,” he says, forcing himself to step around Draco and walk to the front of the bus. As the doors hiss open, he pauses. “I think you might be worth it.”
“Maybe it was a big eel,” Harry offers, gazing down into the water around Draco. He laughs, suddenly struck by the memory of a conversation. “Maybe it was Angus!”
“Are you listening?”
“Thank you,” he says, and Draco just shrugs.
Lifted by Esmee’s optimism, Harry steps around the people cleaning the shop and makes his way out into the street. Draco and Florean are standing outside Sage, conducting a rapid-fire discussion about commercial ovens while Wayne spells the sticky soot from the restaurant’s windows. Harry continues down the alley, stopping at the florist’s to help Felicity and George carry a dozen irritable tentaculas out into the sunlight, then heading for the pet shop, where Mr Pike and a group of helpers are checking each animal in turn and then blasting their tanks and cages clean. When the shop’s resident boa constrictor dangles down to greet him, Harry finds himself picking up a clean, damp cloth and gently wiping the worst of the soot from his scales.
“Harry, it’s really good to meet you,” he says, and there’s just the slightest hint of a Scottish accent.
Draco slides his chair back to the desk, face heating slightly when he realises that the current song has almost finished. He has, apparently, been staring down at the closed-up Magical Menagerie for several minutes, and whatever that means, it cannot be good.
“Who hides in plain sight?” Harry mumbles, mostly to himself.
“You, silly,” Molly says, pulling out the roasting tray and setting it to stand. “I’ll make sandwiches, shall I?”
“Not to worry,” Ginny says, looking rather amused as she vanishes the stain with her wand.
“We could run,” she suggests, and Harry hesitates only for a moment before grabbing her hand and dashing across the cobbles.
Draco grants him a half-smile that steals his breath. “Definitely.”
When they have finished, she brings out another plate, this one containing a large steaming fruit dumpling and a jug of sauce that smells strongly of whisky. Harry gazes at it, impressed by its sheer size. They have never been offered dessert before, and neither does Gertie usually stand there while they eat, but tonight she doesn’t budge, bright blue eyes fixed on them as they exchange glances and then pour on the sauce before trying the dumpling.
And the headline is trying to scrub all of that away. To shatter it and rub dirt into the cracks.
“Aye, I’m sure you’re dying of thirst, Alastair,” she sighs, rolling her eyes and taking an empty glass from the man with the wellington boots. “Cry me a river, eh?”
“It’s fine,” Draco says. “I’ll just have you killed later.”
“I’m not sure it’s time,” she says, frowning. “Let’s choose a different one.”
“I’d forgotten about Kingsley,” Harry mutters, glancing at Needle, who is stomping around in the snow, clearly unimpressed at being gathered into Draco’s arms for Apparation. “Do you think they’ll get on?”
Clicking off the omnivox, Draco drops the needle onto the record and sits back in his chair. The coffee, as usual, is terrible, but someone with a death wish has stolen the last of what he thought was his secret supply of single estate Venezuelan ground, and he has had no choice but to fall back on the standard WWN supply for his early morning caffeine fix. He doubts he’ll ever quite get used to dragging himself out of bed at half past four in the morning, but he does it, even in the winter when the sky outside is black and his quilt feels like a soft, safe cocoon, and he hasn’t been late to work in the last five years. Which is more than he can say for Pansy.
Not that Harry'd ever be able to explain it to Ron, but this was exactly why he wanted to date Draco--he met him exactly where he was at, knowing intuitively what he wanted and delivering. He stoked the flames of Harry's desire until his heart raced and his body sang with sensation.
Malfoy looked doubtful, but he pocketed the slip all the same. Harry hoped he'd actually use it.
******
I hope you don't think I'm overdoing it with the treats here. I know you've got a sweet tooth and it's hard to shop for someone who not only has everything already, but has rather exacting tastes to boot.
Draco smirked, though it was more appreciative instead of taunting or playful. He placed both his hands on the Auror's cheeks, his thumb playing across Potter's cheekbones.
"Hm," Draco began as he swallowed. "Not bad. I imagine too many of these could bad for one's health, however..."
"You've had an exhausting and emotionally-trying morning," he responded, as reasonably as he could manage. "Let's get you home so you can sleep it off."
"So tell me, when did you plan on telling me about your little crush? If I know Gryffindors, I know there is no way you could have kept it to yourself for much longer--not with that kind of cock sucking."
dating," he insisted, exasperated, knowing full-well it would fall on deaf ears.

Harry
Draco smirked as he placed his hands on Potter's waist and pulled him flush against his body, which was starting to feel cold from dried sweat.
Potter laughed, rocking his frame with the force of it. In spite of his affected frown, Draco was really quite content.
It took a great deal of effort to pull his mouth away and lift one lubed hand from Draco's cock to his arse. Harry circled the tip of his middle finger around the glistening entrance before slipping the entire digit inside, pumping in time with his other hand as it continued to stroke Draco's length.
Teddy eagerly complied--he had a morbid fascination with the ancient house elf--leaving Harry bereft of his comforting presence. Reluctantly, he met the sea of disapproving faces worn by the people he loved most.
Draco snorted a laugh and the stag bounded silently through the wall.
Draco waggled his brows at the "

He recounted the tale of his run-in with Burnbridge, Ron cursing sympathetically, Hermione tutting as she waved her wand to clean up after the slob she had married.

Malfoy, after having stiffened at the first of Harry's words, relaxed infinitesimally.
Enclosed are a dust mask for when you cough, some Forever Ice Cubes for your fever and throat, and detailed instruction for decontaminating your home and person. I have already sanitized the office.
"Oh, but you look so good that way: ruffled and marked by me. The bites are most becoming, I assure you!" Draco handed his cone to Harry. It had a few chips left, but nothing more. He pulled a hankerchief from his pocket and dabbed at his mouth until all the leftover grease was gone. He stuffed it away once he was done.
"Tell me what you want, or else I'll do as I please."
Dear Malfoy,
You ought to begin making farewells to your penis--if it has reached the glowing stage, it is not long for this world.
Though Draco's flat did not have a working Floo, the Manor was home to several. And his mother's recent return from her extended "holiday" on the continent gave him the perfect excuse to visit.
Malfoy sniffed. "Potions, mainly. Of the analgesic and sedative variety. They helped with the worst of it, but I have built up a tolerance--they are no longer effective at safe doses. I am in the process of being weaned from them."
******
"I am not going to tell you how long I've wanted you because it reflects poorly on me," he answered eventually. "Suffice it to say, this is not a potion-induced effect."
...Which turned out to be nothing more an aguamenti charm, probably set to go off automatically every morning to keep the lawns looking so green.
, he berated himself.
Dear Draco,
"I would have dressed for dinner, but I don't have any spare clothes. I would have borrowed yours again, but the only clean trousers I could find were some jeans with holes all over them. Why don't you throw those out? Are they sentimental somehow?"
Though Harry had a spotty history of responding well to authority, he could follow Draco's direction without qualm. And, oh, it was worth it to hear the whimper Draco made and see the way his eyes screwed shut at the sensation of Harry drilling his prostate with every thrust.
"'Ow come I 'aven't seen
"Well done, sir knight. I suppose I can give you passing marks," said the man biting his lip the more excited he grew. "I haven't been to the theater in a while. Father always hated these things, surprisingly. I doubt the muggles know about
"Don't cause a scene,
flatmate!
Upon reaching the Atrium, he waved to the handful of people who said hullo and apparated to his doorstep, passing through Grimmauld's wards like water. He then entered a house that was dark and alarmingly quiet.
"So, what now? We only just arrived at the park... Walk some more? Public sex? Or head back to your place?"
Truth.
you're all business."
"Can't wait," Draco commented as he watched both desserts settle on the small table before them. He grinned and lifted a spoon but chose to wait until their company left before digging in. "Have you read the latest about your apparent affair with a Princess D, Harry? Apparently she has to be beautiful to catch your attention, since they speculate you are quite picky."
"I'm not far," Draco panted and squeezed himself around the base, at the same time constricting his insides once more. "Come on..."
He pointed again to make sure she was looking at the correct word then bounded to its real life counterpart in a squat blue jar. Granger read the label: "Fluxweed."

Malfoy's frown deepened. Harry smiled even more broadly. He enjoyed goading the prat.

"I get that you couldn't do much to help, but you could've kept me company, at least. Git."
"Rude!" the girl behind the counter proclaimed, zapping the floor with a hasty scourgify.
Draco blinked at the fancy suit Harry wore, which was promptly followed by an appreciative once over. He looked down at himself, and for the first time since they began dating felt incredibly under-dressed. He gave a sheepish shrug.
******
He bit his tongue and counted to ten and recited potions ingredients in his head...Anything to keep from hexing his boyfriend's father (the supercilious bastard). Though the man was looming over him, Harry remained seated. Lucius' intimidation tactics meant less than nothing to him.
*****
His hair, a tangled mess from his time beneath Potter's skirt, swung loose about his face. The dress swished and rustled with every motion. His breath was hot and humid on his forearms, his arse both burned and sang.
"I am not stalling," he replied tersely, folding his arms over his chest. "I am reminding you why you don't deserve a say in Draco's life." His stare was pure ice, but Lucius met it unflinchingly and Harry was ever so slightly moved. "For his sake, not for yours, I will tell you this much," he relented (thinking Draco would rather they come to some sort of an understanding, if he could pick the outcome), "I wouldn't be with him if I didn't think there was long-term potential in it."
I am delighted to hear that. I'll have Stacy send you a copy of the contracts and waivers first thing tomorrow morning. (Be sure to accept her post this time.)

Harry's finger met considerably less resistance after Draco's muscles were forcibly loosened and conjured lube was added to the much nicer berry-scented stuff he'd brought.
With a sense of foreboding that matched the nasty weather outside, he donned his heavy coat, cast an impervious charm, and made his way street side to apparate to the coordinates nearest Malfoy's residence.
Harry's mouth on Draco's prick finally got the lazy Slytherin's attention (which, it should be noted had never,
Dare.
That was kind of unexpected--to be perused in such a way. Potter's lovely green eyes seemed glued to his body for a few seconds too long, and what a delightful surprise that was. He quirked a brow and stood aside to allow the Auror room to move past his door. He closed it with a quiet click after and locked it with a basic charm. Normally, he would have cast enough locking charms to prevent even the Hogwarts teachers entrance...

Potter stood, clutching his towel to his waist to prevent it from slipping. Pity. "Well," he said. The shadow of a smile lingered at the corners of his mouth and eyes. "Let me get dressed and then we'll get you sorted."
*****
Harry rolled onto his knees, facing his stubborn boyfriend fully and straddling his lap. "I already did embarrass myself," he smirked, inches from the aristocratic features he'd come to know and admire. "In front of everyone whose opinion matters to me. And you know what? I'm glad for it. I don't know how long it would have taken me to stop fucking around and do the right bloody thing if it weren't for that."
"C'mere," he said, tugging him back down again. He pulled Draco into a kiss and ran both hands through his hair to loosen it.
He chirruped at Potter, cocking his head to the side and ensuring his tail was extra fluffy. Potter appraised him with narrowed eyes and pursed lips. "Is that supposed to be an apology?" he asked skeptically.
*****
Slowly, carefully, Harry closed his left hand around Malfoy’s so that it was totally encased within his palms. With that much skin-on-skin contact, there was a noticeable hum of magic that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s arms stand up and the wandlight brighter still.
Auror Potter
, he sighed, heaving himself up to standing with effort. He took four dragging steps to the edge of the table and butted against Potter's chin.
So, after penning his approval and after letting the bird rest for a solid ten minutes at least, he sent his response back, finished his meal, and went off to bed--gently biting the nail of his thumb. His brows furrowed with worry and his heart was already beating a little too fast at the idea of visiting the Ministry.
"Your hand is so rough and warm," he practically moaned as he was fondled through the laces of his trousers. "I can't wait for you to touch my cock... To squeeze me and stroke me with those talented hands..."
Never the less, he squeezed his insides and lifted himself a few inches into the air before falling back down in a slow, fluid motion.
Draco dragged Harry's bottom lip into his mouth for a quick suckle. He licked the darkening skin before releasing it with a gasp. He leaned forward to breathe into the Auror's ear.
Dear Potter,
"Do you need water?" Draco already flipped Harry's wand back into his hand. It didn't respond as well as his own, but his was in the bag and Harry's was right there. He placed the tip of the wand to Harry's lips and poured a small amount into his mouth with a small Aquamenti--carefully avoiding suffocating the man.
He had a whole pile of holiday leave he could use if Draco was serious about his threat. Merlin, he hoped he was.
Finally and without further ado--a new chapter!
******
Draco's longer fingers were better suited to holding both their pricks at once so Harry moved his hand away to make room (having little trouble finding other enticing places on Draco's body to put it). With one hand holding tightly to Draco's arse and the other cradling the back of his skull, he gasped and grunted as Draco wanked them simultaneously, watching with rapt attention their pricks press and stretch and smush against each other in his grip.
Whilst Malfoy was busy making his appointments, Harry snagged a piece of scratch paper and pen and jotted something down.
When Harry arrived at work the next morning, he discovered Malfoy's coat slung over the arm of the sofa where he'd apparently left it. Seeing it triggered a flood of visceral memories: Malfoy stripping down to his trousers for his impromptu nap, the lewd and lascivious way he'd eaten his dinner, the Snog to End All Snogs. (That bloody kiss had been a revelation in and of itself).
“It’s still a studio,” Harry said. “We didn’t know if you would have Muggles over, but Hermione didn’t want to risk—”
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Harry says. “It’s just been so long since we were bitter enemies.” Harry laughs, showing off the deep lines around his eyes and mouth.
“Harry!” Draco gasped as he crawled towards him. “How?” he asked. “Why?”
“No,” Draco admitted. “But it has gotten to the point where I don’t honestly care what’s happening. I mean, I just wanted to see two huge creatures fight. And there seems to be a distinct lack of that.” He sniffed and turned up his nose, something he knew wound Emily up.
Harry is more than OK with that. He rolls out of the bed, finally freed from his spider monkey husband, and walks towards the bathroom. They’re in a suite that has a glass encased shower with three showerheads and a little tiled seat. Draco probably knows what it’s called, but Harry hasn’t a clue. No matter the name of the fancy shower things, Harry thinks he and Draco can get up to a lot of fun activities in their room in the three days they’re going to be staying in France.
Voldie smiled. “Then we shall simply owl for him to return. I will send my fastest owl to find him. Her tracking skills are almost equal to my own. She will find him. But when she does, Draco, darling, what happens if he declines? You did abandon him at the exit of the Forbidden Forest. And he
"Eight o'clock?"
“Tosser,” Harry says, and before he can think about what he’s doing, he leans over, his lips not quite touching Draco’s. “Stop me if this isn’t OK.”
“Are you squeezing me on purpose?” Draco asked, snapping his hips a little harder, feeling Harry squeeze again.
Voldie rolled his eyes. “Next I suppose you’ll remove my tongue. How original.” He twitched his wand and aimed it at Harry.
“Harry?” he asks and Harry knows what Draco wants because suddenly they’re pressed against each other, from shoulders to ankles.
Lovegood takes the Time-Turner gingerly and looks at it appraisingly. “I think it’s broken,” she admits and hands it back to Draco.
“Just watching that boat,” she replied.
“Seriously, though,” Ron continues. “There’s actually good news.”
“Don’t want another leg cramp, love,” he says.
Draco couldn’t keep from laughing a little, which made him slide into Harry even more. Then
Harry scribbles some instructions on the back of Draco’s parchment and sends the owl back.
“I do actually have some unfortunate news.” He lets out a sigh. “When I started taking the curses off the doll, I was able to match some of the curses to a likely caster.” He sighs again. “I believe it came from my dear old Auntie Bellatrix’s estate.”
“This is where Draco was taken by the enemies of Wiltshire. They must plan to start a war,” he said.
Harry’s hips are shifting as Draco plays with his arse, and he can’t keep back a moan when Draco moves his mouth from his earlobe to the place behind Harry’s ear that’s always been sensitive.
Harry stared at Draco. He had been
the world walks all over you, Prince. Once it gets out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you and it’s nothing but work, work, work all the time.”
With a fond smile, Draco starts to unbutton his trousers.
“Bollocks,” he muttered.
“I brought you tea,” Potter said. “
“It’s still creepy, mate.” Harry can’t quite stop his full body shudder and turns his chair so he doesn’t have to look at the thing again.
“I mean, not everybody is going to look like
Draco lets out a little laugh and leans his head down onto Harry’s shoulder. “I do know that,” he whispers. “But on days like today, it’s harder to believe.”
Relaxing onto the sofa, Harry looks around Draco’s flat. He smirks when he sees a scarf in Slytherin colours stashed in a corner and looks for more Hogwarts memorabilia. He doesn’t see any more green and silver, but he does see a few photographs with the Quidditch Pitch in the background. Harry stands and walks to the wall, his jaw dropping when he sees what the picture is of.
“Fergalicious definition make them boys go loco. They want my treasure, so they get their pleasures from my photo. You could see me, you can't squeeze me. I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy,” Draco’s singing and the moment they’re able to leave, Harry drags him back to his place to snog him silly. As soon as Draco’s left, Harry’s got his hands down his pants and he’s spattering come on the floor of his lounge.
Draco could feel his son nodding energetically.
Draco is. He looks like one of the pictures of the Catholic saints Harry had seen on a late night programme about Renaissance art. Whatever Harry’s thinking must show on his face because as soon as they reach their table, Draco smirks and Harry changes his mind about Draco looking like a saint. He’s vividly reminded of some of the racier portraits of Lucifer and his mind is filled with the sound of klaxons.
“Hawwy! Maaafoy!” Rose shouts, waving her little fists.
“I know who the woman with six fingers works for!” Ron half shouted to now a clear-headed Hermione.
There was no biting back the smug grin he felt at making Harry laugh.
come from?” Emily shouted as Draco shrieked, “Why are you stalking me?”
Harry doesn’t think that last part is supposed to be audible, but he hears it, so he leans in and kisses the tip of Draco’s nose.
He stops for a second, his breathing harsh before continuing. “But I’m still
“Who are you?” asked Draco.
“It says it’s milk,” the girl said.
“Me too,” Draco answers, pulling Scorpius into an actual hug. Knowing his son is fourteen and that he’s probably easily embarrassed by too many displays of affection, Draco keeps it brief.
Zacharias glared. “Do you not realize what a HURRY WE’RE IN?”
“Before we start, I want you both to know that the victim is safe at St. Mungo's and in stable condition. She’s in a spell-induced coma for the night and the outlook is positive,” Ron says while leading them into the house.
His breath stutters in his chest. “Are you and Father—” He can’t finish his thought.
Robert the mechanic and his wife Gwendolyn were looking at the toilet plungers, something Draco had objected to, but Harry and Emily had overruled him on. Moira, one of the women Draco’s mum had gotten to know, was flitting about the store. She’d brought her husband, Johnny, her son David, and her daughter Alexis. Draco had hooked up with David when they’d first moved to the Hamlet, but they had realised they were too similar to be anything but friends. Then David had gotten a job in the next town over and they had drifted apart.
“You’re such a lightweight,” Draco said as Emily pushed him and Potter towards the door.
Draco lets out a sigh and looks for Harry. His husband is waving furiously whilst talking to Hugo, no doubt reliving the Quidditch match from last night.
But he saw the distraction for what it was and smiled at his son.
Suddenly the Time-Turner becomes so hot that it scalds Draco’s hand and he drops it. He hears something shatter as it hits the floor. His heart rabbits in his chest before he realises where he is. Sighing with relief, Draco takes in the gleaming hospital wing, every surface shining. His knees feel weak and his eyes start to prickle again at being in the past.

“Have you been having trouble managing your magic lately?”
Seamus and Dean took the sofa Arthur occupied, practically bouncing in their excitement. They, too, whispered amongst themselves but with a good deal more snickering. If Harry didn't put a stop to their gossip, half the country would know about the debacle by morning.
It had never been that way before, not even with other blokes. He didn't know what made Draco different, but he aimed to find out. Starting with this fucking brilliant snog.

Malfoy narrowed his eyes.
, he thought, like the scene had lasted an embarrassing hour versus a few small moments.
"You can stay," Harry repeated. "If you want." He tugged nervously on the edge of his robes. "Don't open the door or unlock the Floo for anyone, and remember that if you leave, it'll be a one way trip. Otherwise, help yourself to anything you find in the kitchen and feel free snoop all you like," he offered cheekily. "I don't think I've left any more deep, dark secrets laying about," he added with a wink, feeling less unsure of the decision in the face of Draco's sweet, awed expression.
Draco gasped and instincitvely scrunched his neck in as his nape was nuzzled. His thrusting had turned into a sudden jerk of his hips, but quickly returned to a smooth fluctuation--still rubbing against his lover's cock while enjoying the pressure of his hand. Both hands squeezed Harry's ass as Draco hoped to Salazar that Harry hadn't noticed the movement.
"You wound me," Draco proclaimed with false hurt in his tone (well, not
The worst of it passed after a small handful of moments. He shook off the rest and took a good look at their surroundings.
"That wasn't half-bad, Potter," he smirked condescendingly. "l think I shall do something special for you... Besides being your own personal sex kitten."
And how exactly is any of this
******
After another minute and with what seemed a great deal of effort, Malfoy returned his gaze to Harry, his expression contrite, if conflicted. "My behaviour will be improved at our next session," he promised haltingly, stunning Harry with the unexpected apology (of sorts).
"When did you start writing?" he asked conversationally, placing a (mismatched) fork and knife next to each bowl.
Draco would have tumbled backwards when the door opened behind him if Harry hadn't caught him. It just so happened that scenario fit rather nicely into his original plan to carry the ridiculous ponce over the threshold. (If that was all he wanted in exchange for the wonderfully wicked things he promised to do to Harry, he was happy to oblige.) Even though Draco was several inches taller, he was slight; it was easy enough for Harry to swing through the momentum to get an arm under Draco's knees and scoop him up.
Drowsy warmth as thick as treacle poured over Harry making his limbs heavy and thoughts slow, but he wrapped his arms around Draco and turned the gentle kiss into a languid, open-mouthed snog. He could taste himself on Draco's tongue and his spent prick gave a half-hearted twitch of interest in response.
Draco nearly sliced his finger. The warm breath on his ear coupled with the tone... Even after all his teasing he never expected Potter to reciprocate. He lifted up a slice of carrot to the Auror's lips in offering.
"After a day of Mother's shopping in one of the coldest countries in the world? Starving," Draco linked his hands behind Harry's neck. "And yes, she did. Rather nice, isn't it? I got to keep some of the length while still retaining some dignity."
Draco,
He peeked in the drawers but found nothing out of the ordinary, just the usual toiletries (or rather, expensive, luxury versions of the usual toiletries), which he used to clean himself up.

Dear Potter,
Draco began to thrust his middle digit--slipping all the way out and pushing back in again as far as he could go.
We can work on our essays together afterwards.

Seconds went by. Then minutes. This was a bad one. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see Malfoy’s mood darkening in real time.

"Yeah, maybe a bit. I'm not objecting."
would single-handedly bring about a new era of integrity for the paper while simultaneously exposing governmental corruption and back door dealings?
"Blaise once said my conversational skills are excellent...as long as you can read my mind at the same time. Apparently half of it goes on in my head." He crossed his legs at the ankles, watching Harry work. "How is it to work with a friend?" he continued without pause. "I would worry such a close attachment would have you distracted in the field."
Not just present--
"Keep touching me, just like that," Draco breathed as he grabbed for Harry's wand near the bottle of lubricant. He quickly cast the necessary spells, opening Harry's way.
******
Heart racing thunderously and body taut, Draco couldn't assess what Potter may or may not be wearing on his bottom half. Really, though, the question should be lower on his list of priorities.
******
*****
"Did you think my other plans were solitary, then?" he retorted smartly.
I'm so tightly wound I fear I might come the moment you lay a hand on me.
I hope it's not giving too much away to say that I hoped I would pick you. I didn't think I actually would, though! I'm surprised you even chose to participate in the Secret Santa since you're only working here for your probation. (It is a pleasant surprise, I assure you.)
"I don't necessarily think it's Malfoy she disapproves of, mate," Neville interjected. "It's the fact you didn't trust us enough to give us a chance. And I can't say as I disagree."
Draco quirked a brow and bit his lip as Harry left. The grin on his face felt huge and possibly permanent. There was a great surge of happiness swelling within the blonde and he didn't even try to suppress or control it. Instead, he nibbled at his toast and shook his head.
Draco decided to rake his hands through Harry's hair for fun until he could properly see the famous scar. He leaned forward and gave it a quick kiss.
—in a way that transcended conventional knowledge—what Malfoy willed. The certainty of it was in his bones.
He sighed blissfully as the cold began to leech the worst of the heat away.
"Such a brat," Harry grumbled, rubbing out the smudge with a spit-wetted thumb. No wonder his friends had looked at him funny.
Harry rumbled his approval and caged Draco in between himself and the wall nearest the stairs. He pulled Draco's hands off his now loose-hanging shirt and pinned them over his head, kissing down the side of his pale neck and biting (none-too-gently) where it joined his shoulder.
He sighed and slowly turned to lay on his back with his eyes gazing across the ceiling in thought. He smiled softly to himself as he recalled their impromptu dinner. The night had been exciting, and Potter (Harry) was surprisingly funny, clever, and so straight forward he nearly threw the exceptionally blunt Draco for a loop. Conversation (and kissing) came easy between them, despite their old rivalry and the years spent apart... Well, actually spending years apart may very well be why they got along so well now.
Harry surveyed the room with a practised eye. "Yeah. It should work," he said after a moment. With a few minor changes it would do fine for a house call. "We'll just have to move the furniture against the wall and get rid of the rug,” he pointed at the item in question with his chin. “It's a tripping hazard." The last thing he needed was for Malfoy to break his leg while under his care.
Draco sat up on his knees and spread his thighs as one hand took hold of Harry's neglected cock. He positioned it against his hole and slowly lowered himself onto the head.

Well, not an outright lie--Malfoy's body was clearly protesting the paces Harry put it through--but it wasn't the reason for the sudden return of his ill-temper. One didn't have to be a retired Auror to figure that out (though it probably helped). Malfoy'd been fine on the stair climber, cordial even, but somewhere in the three minutes between Harry leaving him and his arrival at the mat, his uncharacteristic goodwill had dried up entirely. He was sullen and withdrawn for the remainder of the session, at turns snappish or completely silent despite Harry's best efforts to return to the brief almost-pleasant conversation they'd shared earlier.
!--who hasn't wanted you...at least a little." He had to pant for breath a minute before concluding, "'m glad you changed your mind."

Gingerly, he withdrew his fingers and then eased Draco's leg down onto the bed.

Narcissa was the only other person who knew about their relationship, but that was by Harry's choice, not Draco's. Telling her had been a compromise so Draco could at least have someone to talk to about it. If he'd had his druthers, they would've taken out an ad in the papers by now, but he respected Harry's wishes on the subject.
Just as a sneer was beginning to form on his face, he caught Draco looking worriedly at him. He quickly tamped down on his negative emotions and gave what he hoped was a reassuring smile. "I am looking forward to dinner and your company," he said (mostly honestly), quietly enough that only Draco could hear.
If their previous efforts had felt intimate, those of the past hour had been downright
"I want more," he begged. "Let me. Tell me you want me to."
Harry shifted his attention inward, assessing his own magical stores. Like Malfoy, he found the well substantially replenished, the quiet hum of power singing through his veins when his metaphorical ears were attuned to it.
Sincerely,
Draco quirked a brow and stared down the pile of flesh that was his sated boyfriend.
Harry wanted to be indignant. Really, he did. But he couldn't seem to muster it in the face of the man who was his closest thing to a father.
I've properly cleaned your desk so we should have plenty of room to shag there once you're better. I refuse to get any foreign fluids on mine.
Draco snorted at the exclamation. Harry really did love his sour tarts, but there was a little excitement, despite himself, that burst in Draco's stomach. But whatever laughter or excitement he had left him for immediate, engulfing shock. The blonde stared at his lover as if he were a new species of peacock until his face eventually burst with a bright grin. He threw himself so hard into the Auror they both fell backwards onto the floor.
Teddy had the good grace to look sheepish. "Mostly..." he answered.
"Happy to oblige," Draco half-groaned as he twisted his hips and rolled them over and off slightly so that Potter's back was on the (thankfully long) desk while Draco's feet were planted on the ground. He slid his hands from Potter's hips to under his thighs where he held on firmly to support the other man. He rolled his hips forward again--their clothed cocks brushing once more.
******
This is the other half of chapter 8. Prinn and I got too carried away with the sex and the chapter would have been a behemoth if I didn't split it.
Malfoy cocked his head. "Your own experience?" he repeated shrewdly.
Truth.
He propped his feet on the edge of his desk, reclining back in his chair. He sighed gustily as he once again gathered the files Harry had taken from him and began to sort them into piles--active, closed, trials--to give his hands and eyes something to do while he asked unpleasant questions.
, Draco huffed, only realizing after the fact Potter had called him by his first name. It wasn't even in the throes of passion this time!
"Just be careful around him, mate. I know you say you don't care for men, but... Well... he
"I prefer to bottom," he panted, eyes screwed tightly shut as Draco worked him mercilessly. Brilliantly. "And this is far from my first time." (He wasn't the slag the Papers sometimes made him out to be, but he'd been in a relationship the last two years and dated before that; virginal, he was not.)
Draco smiled wider than he had ever felt himself smile before. His cheeks ached a little from the unmitigated relief, glee, and intense pleasure. There was pink on his pale cheeks and his eyes seemed to glisten with restrained tears.
"Sorry!" he wheezed.
She gave a most satisfying shriek.
Harry
Draco snorted at the very idea of his friends being associated with anything even remotely muggle. He waved a dismissive hand.
******
*****
By his wide, slightly glazed eyes and the pink flush in his cheeks, Draco appeared either horny or just this side of panicked. Context clues suggested the latter, but the former was generally a safe bet with him. Who knew--it could be both.
Potter chuckled, a welcome throwback to his former good humour. "I don't know what you're saying, but I know your cadence, ferret or not, and it isn't wise to call your would-be rescuer names."
The food was delicious--tender, juicy, and flavourful in a way he'd never noticed before. The house-elves were on to something with those eggs; the yolks were especially heavenly. He ate until he was sluggish, fat, and full--his furry belly distended from his gluttony (which he blamed entirely on his greedy ferret brain).
I have had quite enough of destiny for one lifetime, thank you. If that's what it takes to obtain a partner, I should probably buy a dog or something to address the fact I'll be forever alone.
Mind thusly made up, Harry interlaced their fingers and held tightly, squaring his shoulders and daring anyone to look at them askance.
If Draco was bored enough to be thinking about (and, Godrick, wanting to have a conversation about) their post-shagging activities, he needed to step up his game. He pounded into Draco, holding his hips firmly to keep him from sliding up the mattress, angling his hips to strike his best approximation of Draco's prostate. He didn't expect him to come so soon after the last time, but he could at least make things interesting for him.
Current evidence notwithstanding, Harry knew when to quit. He wasn't getting in tonight. And he was quite sure that if he continued trying, this particular house-elf would have no problem hexing him to kingdom come. So he tucked his wand into its holster and held his hands up in surrender.

"You seemed to do all right before," he said flirtatiously, voice a silken purr.
"Pinch my nipples," he pleaded between panting breaths.
...and that was the last semi-rational thought he was capable of having after Draco slotted their hips together and ground against him.
This little fic is done except for a brief epilogue to follow.
"Come now," he dismissed Malfoy's request, lifting a hand and motioning towards the chair Malfoy had been waiting in. "You're already here. And I am rather good at what I do--hence those recommendations you received. Why don't you tell me what brought you in today and we'll see if we can't get you sorted?"
-- Your friend

Harry picked up the cheesecake plate and held it protectively against his chest, angled safely away from Draco for his next bite.
“Oh yeah,” Harry started, acting nonchalant, “I’m bringing you over for the Weasley's Sunday roast at the Burrow, so you better be free.” Harry smirked back at the surprised blond, noticing the powder falling from the slacked hand and activating the floo.
Shaking his head, Harry couldn’t help but laugh, “Yeah, I know I can count on you.”
Conversation winded down suddenly and Harry felt that spark of fear run up his spine as he watched Ron put down his glass and look at him.

Draco pushed himself up to stare at the man.
Malfoy had been truthful before. Now he was being genuine.
He turned his back sharply on Potter and began combing his matted hair into place, methodical and deliberate in his actions.

"I don't mind sharing something. I think I'd like to sit down anyway... Somehow I don't feel comfortable walking into a shop where movement is limited."
Harry pushed until Draco's back was flush with the tabletop, hitched his legs up to his waist, and ground their pelvises together.
you! I know we haven't spent that much time together, but I would think you'd know--" he choked on an almost-sob, but swallowed it down along with whatever else he was going to say. "Forget it. I'm getting the manager and sorting this shit out."
"Stairs?" Malfoy repeated, a petulant curl to his lip.
Draco lifted his torso obligingly as the shirt was peeled away. Once resettled onto the mattress, he kept his arms above his head despite their release (though his hands did clench in the soft, tangled blanket). His skin jumped at Harry's touch as his chest and stomach were immediately attacked. A loud, involuntary groan escaped when his nipple was tugged, causing his back to arch from the bed.
. They milled about uneasily until, one by one, they followed Arthur's cue.
It was a welcome change.
Sometime later, Harry awoke with a start. His wand was in his hand before he was even fully conscious. There was a crash downstairs, voices. One of them female. Goading, gloating.
"I'm sure you're well aware that your condition is incurable," he said, sitting fully upright and dropping his hands into his lap. "We don't need to dwell on that point. The good news is, we can improve things like your pain management, balance and gait, manual dexterity, and endurance, as long as you are willing to work for it. I've had good success with cases like yours in the past."
Harry's head whipped up and he looked the question at Malfoy, feeling...well, rather lost at sea.

So, yes, come save me. I hate this place and I am going mad being cooped up here. That, and I am curious about your ideas. I technically have to remain in some sort of quarantine for two more days, but I am certain your place would be fine for that. Or mine if you prefer.
" Ron was shocked; he gaped in disbelief. "Is he
"True enough," he granted, causing Malfoy to falter for once. Point, Harry.
"Are we going to keep chatting about you fucking me," he goaded, spearing Draco with a challenging stare, "or are you actually going to do it?"
He cleared a throat gone suddenly dry and turned to add the coconut milk and seasonings to the hot skillet.
Draco looked to Harry for his opinion.
Dear Harry,
Despite the funds being so extravagant, the entire affair was as stereotypical as any other wedding he had attended: a plain vanilla wedding cake, chocolate Groom's cake, white everywhere in safe satin and silks, orchids in dreadful displays meant to be "tasteful" (really, who thought purple and pink orchids would be appropriate in a bouquet with yellow Gladiolas? Two dripping plants smashed together in a color scheme of rainbow vomit), and even the liquor was boring and safe. Just some basic two-percent wine mixers in various colors. Usually there would at least be
Draco always complained about Harry collapsing on top of him 'like a great, dumb ox' after coming, so he intentionally collapsed next to him instead, drawing him down onto the bed to cuddle...apparently right into the puddle of his cooling jizz.
His chest felt a bit tight at the thought, but warmth bloomed in his extremities--the idea was more appealing than not. Exhaling a quiet, slightly shuddery breath, he pressed extra hard into a knot near Draco's shoulder blade.
After bacon, toast, and eggs Draco drank his pain potion (though he hadn't been in too much pain, really) and then went right back to sleep and remained that way until nearly two that evening. When he awoke, he decided to clean a few rooms (avoiding Harry's bedroom, as Draco knew bedrooms were an owner's sacred place) to occupy his time... Which only lasted two rooms (kitchen and bathroom, which really weren't very bad) before the blonde decided to slump over the bed again and curl up for a nap.
I'm home now and the floo is open. Why wait?
Alone with his thoughts, he racked his mind for any clues of this secret interest in him Potter apparently harboured. Everyone knew Draco was gay, of course. There was no sense in hiding it. But Potter had always been enigmatic about his dating life. The papers had snapped a few pictures of him lunching with male Quidditch players on occasion and speculated wildly about the nature of their relationship, but it was easy to write that off as tabloid fodder--after all, he lunched with female Quidditch players, as well. It was hardly compelling evidence the man might be bi-sexual, but the Prophet seldom troubled itself over such trivialities. The fact that Potter got himself off while thinking about Draco, on the other hand...
Draco glanced up, eyes twinkling. "Mostly kissing and fondling," he answered lightly. "
Harry groaned, his head falling back momentarily from the onslaught of sensation.
Their server approached to take drink orders and Draco requested a bottle of wine. The somewhat older gentleman's polite, "Of course, sir," earned him points with Harry, who asked for recommendations. Based on his suggestions, Harry settled on the

Draco chuckled as he was hugged close and cuddled. He grabbed Harry's forgotten wand and spelled them clean (without removing his head) before covering them with the sheet and blanket. After, he set the wand under his pillow (an old habit) and slumped into his lover.
Hermione scoffed but let it drop. She eyed a bashful-looking Ron and the two seemed to have a silent conversation. Harry capitalized on their distraction to put his arm around Draco and give him a reassuring squeeze. "You're doing great," he whispered.
You better be willing to do more than just "keep me", sir. After all, no one leaves a Malfoy--not even the Saviour.
I noticed you didn't include "watch Quidditch" on your list. I'm certain you could have played professionally. Did you ever consider it?
I'm afraid I've got back-to-back meetings for the rest of the day, but I'm certainly not opposed to discussing the issue further.
," Harry breathed shakily, leaning hard to the right to get a better look at Draco's long, slender fingers disappearing into his body.
"Didn't think so," Potter replied. "In that case, we'll detour to the Headmistress' Office to fire-call Hermione before heading to the Dungeons. Unless you object to that plan?"
We're baaack! The long delay was mostly my (playout's) fault. Prinn sent her stuff to me a while ago, but I got distracted by adorably grumpy ferret!Draco in 'Where's Granger When You Need Her?'. The good news is, the next several chapters of this bad boy are beta'd and ready for final proofing before posting. I will do my best to get them up in a timely fashion. *mwah!*

That brought Malfoy's pale eyebrows back to a more normal position.
Settling on a time-tested move--one that he'd enjoyed immensely the last time he tried it--Draco smiled innocently as he offered Harry some of his chicken, presenting it on his fork with a casual air. The Auror, of course, hesitated, but upon Draco's smile turning slowly into a hurt pout he gave in. Just as his lips wrapped around the morsel, Draco's bare foot found its way into Harry's lap and pressed.
