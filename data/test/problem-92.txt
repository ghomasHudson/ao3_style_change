The second strange thing happened at a mysterious duel club. A poster for it appeared on the notice board in the Slytherin common room. It didn’t say who was running it, only a time and place for when to meet. Draco and Harry didn’t see much reason not to, and it sounded like it could be fun, so they attended and waited in the Great Hall with a crowd of other students, staring at the platform that had been created in the centre of the room, presumable for the duels that they would be doing.
Draco could see that his dads were having one of those silent conversations they had whenever they had something private to discuss.
’. And it’ll go blank.” Harry nodded, thanking the boy’s genuinely and shaking their hands. He dismissed the ‘thank yous’ the twins made again for what he did for Ginny, and he told them what he told everyone. That he would’ve done it for anyone.
“Don’t ‘Hey, dad’ me.” Sirius’s voice was as cold as ice, a voice that Draco had never heard his dad use before. It made his lower lip tremble and his eyes prickle with tears.
Christmas had finally arrived and Harry was spending it at the Lupin-Blacks! Remus couldn’t be more excited. The year before had gone so well, and he was determined to make Harry feel as though he was a part of the family. This was especially important for Sirius, who felt quite a personal connection to Harry.
Okay so I'm not sure about this chapter, please give feedback. (Speaking of, thank you for all the love this has gotten!!)
“Yeah. Most of it, anyway.” Remus didn’t correct Harry, confirming that the scar on his forehead was proof that not everything in the Wizarding World was amazing. “If you don’t mind my asking, Harry, where have you grown up?” Harry shuffled nervously, clearly uncomfortable talking about it.
After a few moments of silence where neither knew quite what to say, they were saved by the rustle of two owls flying down to the table - Hedwig, carrying with her a copy of the Daily Prophet, and a Hogwarts owl, carrying what was probably the response to the letter McGonagall had written earlier. They each took their things and Harry slid a knut into Hedwig's pouch and gave her a treat before they headed off.
“Look, it’s okay. But please, please just talk to us about it. You know how much your dad and I love you!” He was crying, himself now. They sat in silence apart from the occasional sniffle and Draco allowed himself to be held in a crushing hug as they both settled down. “You know I’m happy, right? The transformation doesn’t stop me from being happy! Your father comes with me when you’re away, he turns into a dog, it’s actually quite fun.” They both let out a wet chuckle at the image of Sirius yapping away. “And you know, I’m registered now.” Draco looked up and peered into his father’s face.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world. If you were, you wouldn’t have been killed by a baby.” Draco was astonished at his friend, for saying such things to Voldemort himself. Of course, he had been a little snarky to the man before, but he didn’t know who he was dealing with then. “And anyway, even though he has made some questionable decisions, Albus Dumbledore is still a more powerful wizard than you. Even when you were at your peak, you didn’t try to take over Hogwarts, because you knew that you’d fail.”
To cheer him up, he and Harry flipped through The Quibbler every morning and became rapid fans. Such big fans they were of it that when they visited the Weasleys for Sunday lunch one week, they insisted on visiting the Lovegoods.
“Look, I understand ‘young love’ and everything, you know me and Moony started when we were in school. I just don’t want you to get your heart broken.”
As James and Minerva passed each other, they shared a look that Sirius couldn’t miss: a cheeky, inside grin that made it clear they were making fun of him a little.
What he did find himself worrying about, though, was Snape. On the night of Halloween, Harry spotted Snape going up towards the third floor and then with a fresh wound on his leg that he was acting suspiciously about. Putting two and two together, Harry came to the conclusion that Snape had tried to get past that three-headed dog thing, and failed. He must have released the troll into the dungeon, hoping for it to be enough of a diversion to allow him to slip away unnoticed. Harry shared his theories with Ron, who met them with enthusiasm.
He was breathtaking. His golden hair lay in a curly bush on top of his head, because Sirius had refused to let him style it for the wedding, and he was wearing a perfectly fitted muggle tux, mainly because Sirius had wanted to piss off his parents even more than he already was by marrying a male werewolf. But, the most breathtaking thing of all, were his deep, honey eyes that shone like stars, so brightly that he could see them from the other side of the hall. Either side of him, were his parents, who looked proud and happy, which was a nice change, and behind him was Lily, wearing a stunning red dress that complimented her hair perfectly, holding a bouquet and grinning even wider than her husband. Even seven months pregnant, Lily looked as young as the day they first met.
Alright, question of the day, if you could go to any of the magical schools in the Harry Potter universe, which would you go to (Hogwarts is a perfectly valid answer)
Draco lightly surveyed him as though he had grown a second head before laughing awkwardly and trying to shake the moment off.
Draco would remember what he saw in the Mirror of Erised until the day he died. It haunted both his dreams and waking thoughts. Sometimes he would look at Harry, or one of his parents and wince, purely because he could so vividly picture what they looked like in the mirror. What he hadn’t expected was that he would see it again so soon.
It made Remus sad that Dumbledore now had to make calls as to who would be going where. It made him feel sad that the boys were being treated like dangerous, cursed objects. Weapons. But, to Dumbledore, that was all they were.
“You’ll be here for about a day probably, sweetheart, okay?” she whispered, voice low for the sake of the other patients. It would take him a lot of energy to tilt his head in a weak attempt at a nod, and she understood, so gave him a kind pat and got to work healing his wounds.
Draco squealed as the doors of the Entrance Hall slammed open to reveal a dozen surly-looking dwarfs wearing golden wings and carrying harps.
Sorry for the long wait. I've just found out that my GCSEs are officially cancelled. It was annoying at first but looking over my grades I'm not too worried.
It started off on a high though, as Harry was forced to be the first one to approach the creature. Which was, as expected, intimidating, but after getting the green light from it, he felt instantly calmer. A feeling that didn’t last long as Hagrid scooped him up and planted him right on the animal’s back.
“I know you did, you daft bugger. And you broke you arm while doing it.” He tenderly kissed the palm of his hand and Harry felt instantly better, but their lovely moment was interrupted by another familiar voice shoving aside students to get to Harry.
“Detention after school. Tonight. Eight o’clock, don’t be late. You’re lucky I don’t give you more.” Everyone in the room was vaguely aware that Draco had gotten off easy because the Slytherin team needed a decent Chaser, and didn’t bother saying it. It was sad that Draco didn’t seem to have a parental figure nobody had anything to say about.
Draco groaned. “You’re hearing voices now? Last year you were defeating a dark wizard, last month you had a house elf telling you this place was dangerous, last week you were sticking you’re hand in a fireplace.” he listed “I swear on Helga Hufflepuff’s mandrakes, being friends with you is like trying to stop a blind bird from flying into a moving train.”
Draco breathed. “The moment I realised that Harry wasn’t dying and that we could actually win against Voldemort.” he confided.
“That’s what it’s called?” The elf in question was nervously darting his eyes between the two boys, who were both glaring at it with matching expressions of bafflement. It was Draco who pulled himself together first.
“I am the only one here who can speak Parseltoungue, I bet that would be a useful trait to have if you’re defeating Slytherin’s monster.”
“I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know, because I’ve read all about them.” Harry’s jaw dropped. He had never seen straight-laced Hermione lie to a teacher. He had once seen her remind Professor Flitwick that he was supposed to give them homework. “If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Draco knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.” Harry and Draco glanced at the teachers to gage their reactions, but Harry’s eyes were caught on whatever Snape was trying to cover with his cloak. It looked like a rip in his trousers that revealed a gaping wound. Harry suppressed a gasp.
The kitchen was so silent you could hear a pin drop. Sirius took the seat next to Remus, not daring to look at his face. The other man hardly ever raised his voice.
and Draco looked around to see every eye in the Great Hall fixed on him. To his side, Harry started giggling, the only sound piercing the Great Hall, until Draco himself joined in. The incredulity of the situation sinking in. Ron, after a short pause, joined in with a chortle from the Gryffindor table, which, in turn, inspired Hermione and a few other Gryffindors to join in too. Within minutes, the whole hall was laughing, even Snape’s fiery snarl softened a little. Everybody continued eating their breakfast with light expressions and occasional barks of laughter. It seemed that Draco’s parents still had a knack for brightening everyone’s mood.
“Turn it off. Now.” Pansy, who was closest to the fire, followed Draco’s orders and doused it. The seconds she did, the blond relaxed in his seat and continued playing as though nothing had happened. The rest of the night was spent in a tense atmosphere as everyone tried not to provoke Draco again. Harry asked him if he was okay but he didn’t seem to remember it happening at all.
Harry’s first week at Hogwarts was, from an outsider's perspective, pretty eventful, what with flying lessons, and figuring out the endlessly confusing staircases and his best friend being the subject of ruthless speculation, not to mention the rumours that followed
“How?” asked Harry, but Draco rolled his eyes as if to say ‘Isn’t it obvious?’ and Lockhart looked even more confused than earlier, but this time was trying desperately to school his features into a pensive mask.
Lockhart stared around at the Professors desperately. “I… I really never… You may have misunderstood… “
Hope and Lyall leaned over to him next, and whispered something similar. To which he, of course, said “He needs no taking care of, Mr and Mrs Lupin, but I’ll do my best.” They smiled at him gratefully and withdrew to their respective seats. As did McGonagall, who squeezed his arm before departed.
When they arrived, Snape threw Harry down into a chair, the parchment onto the desk, and some of what Sirius had told him is called ‘Floo Powder’ into the fireplace. From there, he bellowed into it;
Remus released the boggart after rehashing the spell and it was, as suspected, a dementor. At first, he just used the ‘Riddikulus’ spell, just to know how to do it, but they moved onto the Patronus charm directly afterwards.
Sirius couldn’t remember actually saying his own vows, although he knew that they were the same as Remus’s, and that he meant every word. It was almost like he blacked out, because the next thing he remembered was the exchanging of rings.
“Oh yes.” Said Fred, with a smirk. “This little beauty’s taught us more than all the teachers in this school.”
“Oh, are we?” Said George. He took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly and said, ‘I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.’ And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web from the point that George’s wand had touched. They joined each other, they criss-crossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment, then words began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that proclaimed:
As per the other tradition Draco had for the holiday season, he and Harry spent the final moments of the evening in their room, exchanging presents.
“Professor, I don’t understand, why didn’t you tell us? We had a deal!” demanded Remus, slamming his hands on the desk.
“Take a seat, honey, I’ll explain everything.” Moons sounded tired, like he had just stayed up half the night before, but still comforting.
With the solemn occasion of Halloween over and done with, Remus was free to begin extra-curricular defense training with Harry and Draco. They gathered in the classroom on a gloomy Wednesday night and got started.
“Dobby?” He looked awful, bless him, arms wrapped in bandages, tears filling those tennis-ball eyes but never falling.
“Oh, shush.” he scoffed. “Even if that’s true, there is no way I am letting you be the hero again, Harry.”
Sirius hesitated. "Because the world is shit. Because you are my son, and you are so much better than all of these idiots." He gestured to the conglomeration of snarky schoolchildren behind him. "You are going to make it through this year, just as you made it through every other year, because you are strong enough." He sighed and looked at Harry, who was saying his farewells to Remus. "And... I know I was a little harsh with him... but he's a very good kid. The most lovely one I think you could have been friends with. I'm glad you have him. And for what its worth, I'm glad he has you. Through all the obstacles this universe is throwing at you, you get along remarkably well."
Draco begged Sirius to stay with him and play the game so Remus was going to go to the meeting with Dumbledore and McGonagall alone and report back. He waited to see his son greet his best friend again, if only for the fact that it was too darn sweet.
Finally, the bell rang to signal the end of class and he debated asking McGonagall for a lesson pass so that he could head to bed early, but knew that if he did that his friends would get suspicious and his sleep schedule would be messy for a while, it would be too much of a hassle.
When he first met Harry, he could see that same glint. All he wanted was to make him forget all of the sadness he had been through, but some things are just impossible. He was working on understanding that better.
He didn’t quite know where to begin. He had so many questions, some he would prefer to remain unanswered, like what exactly made him so threatening to Voldemort, but there were some others, like what his mother was like before Azkaban, what they had hoped for him in the future, although he could probably guess that one.
run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?” Harry stood up to leave but paused to ask Dumbledore what he saw in the Mirror. The older man lied, Harry could tell by the way a dark cloud crossed over his features as he stared into Harry’s soul. But, Harry had thought, it wasn’t his place to pry.
“Draco…?” There came a hollow whisper from the corner where the man lay and he crawled painfully slowly to the division. Between them was only a magically enchanted barrier, impenetrable but completely translucent. Draco could see every wrinkle, every fragment, every eyelash, and they all felt like an aged mirror.
“What is it?” Pads patted him on the shoulder, signalling that they would talk about it later, but at that moment Draco didn’t care. Harry was finally back and they were going to spend the whole year together.
“Alright then, no need to get huffy with me!” he squawked before drinking the tea to its completion and staring down at the dregs. “It looks like mush, what does that mean?”
“It’s a shape-shifter,” Hermione had explained “It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us the most.”
And so he did and the group felt that odd sensation of being dragged through a tube before being safely deposited in a quiet, safe looking village. The weather was surprisingly bright and sunny, such a contrast to the general mood of the day, and it made Draco feel just a little better. Sure, he was usually more of a night person, but visibility was preferable at a time like this.
“She’s still alive, but only just.” Something about this ‘Tom’ person seemed off to Draco. He had seen that glint that he had in his eyes too many times and it brought back too many memories he would prefer to remain in the past. Harry seemed blissfully unaware of it, though, probably because of his inhumane good-looks which made Draco feel a small pang of jealousy, especially over those curls which were honestly swoon worthy.
Professor Lupin-Black explained the spell to everyone and asked Neville what he found the most scary in the whole world.
“MEMORIES CAN BE TAMPERED WITH!” That shut Harry up, he clearly hadn’t known that. “And even if it is a true memory, that isn’t our PROBLEM!” He shouted the last word for good measure, before collapsing back on the bed. He located his wand and cast a small healing charm for his throat. “Harry.”
At the raging party in the Slytherin common room, Harry got to talking with the Seeker of the team, Terrence Higgs, a tall, lanky boy with terrifyingly straight, white teeth. He was told that this boy was in his last year of school and that the Seeker position would be open next year. This sent a jolt of excitement through Harry, he was watching the Seeker avidly throughout the game and decided that it was his favourite. However, this invited the problem that there was only one available position on the team. Harry felt his heart sink. He had so hoped to be able to play with Draco, or play at all. Harry knew that, with Draco’s prior experience, he would be the one getting on the team, if one of them was going to. It made Harry a little sad, especially seeing as Draco didn’t even want the Seeker position, he wanted to be a Chaser. But he didn’t let it show, more than anything, he was happy for Draco and he didn’t really have to worry about any of this until 2nd Year.
Harry did, he poured himself a steaming cup of tea and selected a dog shaped shortbread biscuit. Draco, however, wasn’t paying attention, he was still seething from the encounter and needed some form of release. The ice beneath his skin was bursting for it.
And it wasn’t even because of this stupidly boring lecture he was enduring - although, under normal circumstances, he would be fighting off the waves of sleep all the same. There was something about a tough transformation that made everything else in life seem utterly pointless. When the full moon rolled around, there just wasn’t any room in his head for Warlock Conventions or Assemblies of European Wizards, all he thought about was blood and ripping things and generally being much more wolf than human.
It was more that there was so much that could go wrong. What if he said he vows wrong? What if James messed up? What if he fell over while walking down the aisle? What if someone leaked the time and location of the party and the hoard of Death Eaters showed up?
Harry put a soothing hand on his back that he flicked away immediately. He also kicked away Pansy’s annoying rubbing of his knee. He stood up.
The Chamber was dark and eerie, with stone pillars lining the walls. At the opposing end, there was a statue of some kind of monkey man with a really long beard, probably Salazar Slytherin, Draco deduced. He looked over at Harry who was taking his surroundings in with heavy breaths until the stopped abruptly and his eyes lay on a small heap at the foot of the statue.
There was one of him riding a Junior Broom for the first time and giggling, one of him and Remus in an intense Wizard Chess game when he was too small to understand any of it, with Remus jokingly pretending to be absolutely stumped by the boy, one of a seven to nine year-old Draco drowning in Sirius’s leather jacket and motorbike helmet. But, Harry’s favourite was of Sirius and Remus cradling a very young Draco, probably around four or five. They weren’t looking at him with familiar love, but some new kind of awe that painted your features when you are scared and nervous and blind sighted as hell but also feeling like the luckiest person in the world. Once, Harry asked Draco about it. It was taken on the day he was adopted, by Professor McGonagall. It was his favourite too, he says because of the sheer terror at the idea of parenthood on his father’s faces, but Harry thought it was perhaps more.
shits been crazy, life is moving forward at a rapid pace and i’ve been struggling to keep up but - you know what? here i am!
The boys had a connection in that moment that neither of them would ever fully understand. But, little did they know, they were more like their parents than they wished.
By now, Draco had run down from the stands and brushed his hand against Harry’s sleeve, grabbing his attention. “Are you okay? What happened?”
To everybody’s surprise, Lockhart introduced a helper… Snape. It was shocking, but Harry felt almost comforted by the fact that Snape would most likely be taking the piss out of the other Professor. The two geared up for a demonstration, but it didn’t last long. Snape disarmed Lockhart within about two and a half seconds, leaving the man sprawled on the floor in an undignified heap. He passed it off as though he was allowing Snape to do that, simply for demonstration, but it was clear from the redness on his cheek, that the had not.
“So what do we do?” Remus hadn’t a clue. There was nothing that they could do until the boys started showing signs of their hidden magic. And that could happen any day. All they needed to do was just hold tight.
Harry was helped to his feet by Draco, who gave him the once over for any injuries, before allowing him to survey his surroundings. It looked exactly how he would have pictured an evil lair to look, dark, slimy, probably filled with too many germs to be kept under a bathroom, there were even rat skulls dotted around like some kind of ironic decoration. Wands held high, the boys started to make their way down the tunnel and jumped at the sight of the largest snake skin they had ever seen. It was at least twenty feet long and resembled a real one in a horrific way.
Hermione gasped as her eyes fixed on a butterfly a little closer to the ground, although it wasn’t a butterfly. As Draco got closer, he could see that it was actually a key with wings, glinting in the limited light.
“You’ll find your place. I hope we’re in the same house, that means we can room together!” Well that was a lovely thought. Perhaps Harry should just ask to go wherever Draco goes. “Can I ask you something?” Draco was suddenly timid.
“We would be honored if you would. The child’s bank account was the only one of his assets that haven’t been frozen by the Ministry and you will get frequent payments in order to fulfill the child’s expenses…” She was speaking in clipped tones, clearly trying to withhold tears. What horrors this child must have suffered. “We know that he has a lot of archaic magic in him, but he has also shown some signs of unusual magic that could have grave consequences if honed and used for evil, so we need you two, good men, to raise him and, hopefully, show him the light.” Remus and Sirius had matching expressions of shock, and Remus held the child tighter. Eventually, the pair shared a look and Sirius spoke up.
Luna handed out each cup. Ginny and Hermione took a tentative sip and Ron sniffed at it suspiciously. Draco peered at the liquid. It looked not too dissimilar from the mist that surrounded the prophecy. He clicked his cup with Harry’s and took a sip. It wasn’t bad at all. Almost fizzy, like lemonade.
Crabbe ended up with a broken ankle and Goyle hit his head against the rock as they were trying to get down and escape. Buckbeak didn’t touch either of them, and yet they were yelling something about crazed animals. It was actually quite funny at the time. They looked like giant babies.
“I know, Harry didn’t deserve that, but we don’t know how bad it really was! Maybe Harry’s just a skinny kid, but you know, if it really was malnourishment, it’s okay now! He can live with us during the holidays!” Sirius visibly relaxed at that, but collapsed his head on Remus’s shoulder and exhaled heavily. It was then that an old, bearded wizard in silvery robes, calmly stepped out of their fireplace.
Since I enjoy hearing from you guys, I'm gonna ask another question, simply because it is fun. I really like getting that inbox notification and its someone telling me what their animagus would be or what house they're in - its surprisingly interesting!
As I was baking this transcendent cake I thought to myself, what would Amortentia smell like to me? And then I thought, I wonder what Amortentia would smell like for my readers...
It seemed to Harry that their disgust at it was something that they had learned from their parents, as was the case usually, so he spent a lot of time teaching them and it seemed to be working.
“Well, he keeps his wife around, look.” Harry pointed his index finger towards the part of the page that showed a counter displaying his wife’s age.
“‘Ello ‘Arry, Ron! ‘Ow are things?” Hagrid was avoiding eye contact with Harry, instead looking anywhere but.
Overcome with curiosity, even if his rational head knew that the classroom would be nothing more than that, a classroom, he pushed open the door and stepped inside, shutting it behind him and draping the cloak over his arm. The room was barren except for the furniture that was propped up against the walls and the large, ornate mirror, standing tall in the centre. It was magnificent. Harry traced it’s contours with wonder. Along the top was an inscription: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. It must be Latin, Harry thought. Resting his eyes finally on his own reflection, Harry started. There were people behind him. He turned, finding that he was as alone in the room as he was before. But the mirror still reflected the faces of strange people, all familiar. On his left, Harry saw the faces of Sirius, Remus and Draco grinning at him. On his right, his mother and father, serene and peaceful. Harry felt tears prickle his eyes and that sense of longing that he had felt all over the holiday tripled into a dull ache that seemed to carve a hole in his chest. Merlin, how he longed for a family. When he looked closer, he saw generations of Potters, stretching out for miles behind James and Lily. He wanted, so desperately, to switch places with Mirror Harry, if only for a second. But if he stayed in there for a second, he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to bring himself out again.
“Alright guys, next one’s on me…” Sirius yelled, balancing their empty bottles precariously in his arms as he made his way to the bar.
“-and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked ‘Confiscated and Highly Dangerous.’
“HE HAS NO BONES LEFT, YOU MORON!” cried Draco. Harry was shocked that his friend was speaking that way to a teacher. But then, he thought, Lockhart hadn’t done anything in his time here that could be deserving of that title.
“You’ll find out soon enough.” When they reached the statue of a gryffin, Snape bellowed out. “Fudge Flies’ and the statue began to turn, revealing a set of winding stairs that the two began to ascend. Snape’s hand was no longer gripping the back of Draco’s neck but he almost felt like he missed its presence. Without it, he was floating with no anchor. Thankfully, they made it to the door. Without even knocking, Dumbledore’s voice could be heard from inside.
“Mr Lupin-Black, I am very sorry this has happened.” he said, in a clipped tone. Remus was taken aback, firstly because he hadn’t expected an apology, the Ministry tended to place the blame on others, secondly, because people of high position in the Ministry often treated him as some type of subhuman species, and finally because nobody ever really addressed him as ‘Lupin-Black’. It was always just ‘Lupin’. Or ‘Filth’.
Harry remembered the fire incident and explained to Draco how he never felt the sun like everyone else did, that he usually didn’t feel any different stepping outside into it’s blinding rays. The other boy bit his lip and reached under Harry’s bed, emerging with the book that Draco had gotten him in first year. He looked up at Harry, unsure.
“Give it to me, then. And if you don’t mind, Severus, I will figure out a way to punish him fairly, seeing as you seem to be rather tired.” said Remus. Snape looked as though he could blow something up, but stayed silent as he reluctantly handed the map over to the other Professor.
Aside from these new additions of Harry Potter’s life, he still made time to speculate over suspicious information that found itself on his path. When Draco had first passed him the copy of the Daily Prophet that fateful morning, he instead focused his attention to the headline that day about a break-in at Gringotts, in the same that he had seen Hagrid get a package from. It seemed suspicious to him, and his ever unquenchable curiosity had him devoured. He expressed his concerns to Draco who had merely said,
He shook his head as tears welled up in his icy, silver eyes. “No. But I think that we’d be handling it better with them to support us.” He paused for a moment. “James would've loved it.” he said, chuckling.
“You see?” he whispered. “I am your greatest fear, Harry Potter. I was already using it at Hogwarts, amongst my most intimate friends. I wasn’t going to keep my filthy, muggle father’s name, who hated my mother simply because she was a witch, forever. So I fashioned myself a new name, one that witches and wizards alike would be afraid of saying out loud, for I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.”
“It’s okay, Ginny!” Harry was trying to be really nice to the girl because he had a strong suspicion that it was she who wrote the song. “It was my fault, I wasn’t looking!” She blushed as red as her hair and rushed off murmuring something about being late. “Okay! Bye then!”
Sirius visibly deflated at the memory. Harry’s heart went out to him - he couldn’t imagine the kind of pain he went through.
I'll tell you what, online schooling is bloody difficult. It's not even really the schoolwork that's the problem, even though the schoolwork is difficult, to me it's the Zoom calls. They just don't sit right with me. Plus by the end of the day my room is just really stuffy because I've barely moved from my desk and I can never concentrate.
“Bloody hell.” Draco groaned quietly. There was a thud and both of them turned around to find that Lockhart had dropped to his knees. They rushed forward to help him but backed away as he seemed to be grasping for his wand, threateningly.
“I thought maybe…just a little bit” He trailed off quietly before coming to his senses and realising that the wall was now completely solid. A Muggle policeman walked up to them with a questioning look.
“No reason.” There was a small pause as Draco waited for his father to inevitably blurt out what he was really thinking. Eventually, Sirius caved. “I want to check you’re okay.” Draco groaned. “I know he’s James’s son, but it is my duty as a father to make sure he is treating you kindly.”
Sirius looked at him, feigning confusion before thinking better of it. He gnawed on his lip. "I guess we're going to have to face that when we come to it, won't we?"
“Thank you. You have no idea how happy I am.” He watched as Harry’s eyes filled with joyful tears and reached out his hand, placing it on his knee, warm and steady. The other boy seemed to appreciate it because he covered it with his own.
“Thank you for your apology, Mr Fudge, this is going to be very hard on my family.” It really was. He genuinely did not know how they were going to cope.
Sirius closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, absorbing the warm feeling of family that surrounded them. Everything was going to be okay. Lucius
“Thanks for the advice Hagrid but I’ll be fine.” Hagrid looked resigned and muttered something along the lines of ‘Dumbledore better…’ But Harry didn’t stick around to find out what ‘Dumbledore’ had better do, frankly he was tired of hearing the man's name, and joined Draco back on the platform. Draco gave him a questioning look that he responded to with what he hoped was a reassuring smile. He idly wondered what everyone was worried about, Remus and Sirius seemed to be lovely people, and Draco had been nothing but kind to him.
“I’m sorry, son, we were just friends with your parents, James and Lily?” Remus offered, Sirius still seemed to be recovering from the shock of seeing the ghost of his best friend.
He and Draco slept in the same bed that night, wanting to keep the other close. It had become a habit of theirs to resort to this whenever something big had happened. Harry didn’t have much in the way of family, Draco was the closest he had, and he liked the comfort of having him near.
Another thing they had to be thankful for was insurance, something that Remus had cleverly remembered before they purchased the broom, so it wasn’t that big of a deal anyway. The real point was more that the dementors were oddly attracted to Harry. They had some strange pull to him. From what Draco could tell, his parents had their suspicions, but he wasn’t privy to those discussions.
Harry cleared his throat and took a sip of tea, presumably to distract himself from the mistake McGonagall made. “Of course, go right ahead. I’ll probably send them my version of events too.”
I know I said I probably wasn't going to update until after Christmas but I sat down today and then this came out. It's not very big as regards to the overall plot but it's cute and heart warming, so enjoy! :)
They retreated to the ends of the space and readied themselves. Lockhart tried to explain a complicated blocking charm but dropped his wand, Harry saw Snape whisper something in Draco’s ear and he smirked. Honestly, his friend was becoming a little intimidating.
“I can assure them that you’re on a steady dodge of Wolfsbane, I’m sure they’ll be understanding.” Dumbledore leant back in his chair. “They’ll be glad their children will be getting a better education.”
November passed in a hazy blur of lessons and homework, only split up by the time Harry and Draco spent with each other, and occasionally Ron and Hermione. The weather was bitterly cold but everyone was gearing up for the next Quidditch match, Griffindor vs. Slytherin. Harry and Draco were, in particular, very excited because Draco had apparently been riding on brooms since he was very young, and Harry was fascinated by the idea. Riding a broom in his first flying lesson was the most exhilarating feeling he had ever experienced, and the pair had made a pact to try out together in 2nd Year. According to Draco, Sirius was a Beater, while Harry’s father was a Chaser. Harry wasn’t 100% sure that he knew what these positions were, but he was excited to learn.
Remus couldn’t breath. His throat had constricted and he physically could not move. A warm hand on his shoulder and the soothing voice of Sirius telling him to breathe was helping minutely, but his brain was still on overdrive.
Draco sighed. “He was watching me, I didn’t like it. And then he started following me, so I told him to quit it. Then he turned me into a ferret.”
“What is it now?” Remus and Sirius were once again preparing breakfast in their kitchen, as they did every day, when Perseus dropped in with a letter from Draco that caused Sirius to choke on his toast.
Sirius grimaced. “How do you guys know about him?” Draco and Harry both opened up their mouths to give an excuse but Sirius held up his hand to pause them. “D’you know what? I don’t want to know.”
Harry could barely contain a gleeful smile when the text faded away, but Snape was livid. He grasped onto Harry’s arm with a painful strength and yanked him down the hall. He seemed to be heading to the dungeons, and eventually, to his own office.
“Light, Hermione, it doesn’t like light.” The girl cast a beam of blinding light that made the plant coil back and release everyone.
“Yes and no.” There he went with the riddle-talking again, Harry had to refrain from rolling his eyes. “It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, more desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.” Dumbledore paused, looking grave.
“it’s okay, Draco, you can have my place. He’s really good, Ron.” The boy made to move out of his space but Draco immediately felt guilty and awkward.
The Minister averted his eyes to his lap and nodded. “That is definitely a possibility.” Remus didn’t quite know what to say. He could understand now why Sirius didn’t want to go to the meeting - he didn’t want to talk about the kiss.
“So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?” Draco also seemed to have come to his senses and was now giving Harry a look that could easily be interpreted as ‘Oh my God what a fucking idiot’, Harry didn’t usually swear, even in his subconscious, but it seemed appropriate in the moment.
i'm taking my gcses, or at least the pandemic equivalent of, in two weeks and then its just a half term of exams, which sucks because i don't have much time to write. i'm going my best, and i intend to take full advantage of this easter holiday i'm having right now BUT the wonderful thing is that after i'm finished with my exams i have 12 weeks of summer holiday and pretty much nothing to fill them with - so that means i'll hopefully be writing more!
“But you’re one of the most influential people of our generation, you’re in History books.” murmured Blaise, incredulously. He was one of the few people who weren’t charmed by Lockhart, probably because he had 'higher standards than that'.
“Draco’s right, Harry. We’re only in our first year, we can’t fight Snape!” Ron finally caught up and grasped at Hermione’s shoulder for balance as he caught his breath.
“Hey guys,” Harry looked from twin to twin, who were each grinning mischievously at him. “Can I help you?”
Remus cut in. “Look, Professor, we just want what’s best for Harry and Draco. If keeping them apart is what’s best, why don’t you keep Harry at Hogwarts for the Summer?”
“Four butterbeers, please.” he ordered, flashing a quick smile to the man tending the bar, flirting at anyone and everyone, as he so usually did.
“Are you and Draco okay? Did you have a fight or something?” Ron’s face was ghastly white, but all of his colour returned with a relieved sigh when Harry reassured him that they did not. Not only was Ron worried about their supposed fight, as were their Slytherin gang, who had been on eggshells all week, not speaking unless spoken to and avoiding all snarky comments, even when Draco’s hair looked like a birds nest. One night in particular, when they were all gathered around the fire in the Slytherin common room, there came a ripple in their group dynamic. Blaise and Theo were immersed in a game of Wizards Chess, Pansy and Millicent were doing each other’s nails and whispering, and Draco was contentedly piping out a silly tune on his harmonica. It was happy and light and it made Harry feel quite relaxed. Suddenly, he stopped, freezing, and everyone looked up. His eyes were fixed on the fire.
“Why? My boy, don’t you know?” After what he had seen in the Mirror last year, Draco was sure that he didn’t want to know, and that the incidents were related.
“Yes, but it’s okay.” It wasn’t really, their presence was exceedingly alarming and he was in no position to be coming up with any elaborate lies in this moment at all, but what was he going to do? He was sure that the bite marks and scratches were obvious, and that he was clearly not ‘okay’.
“He does seem a little cooky.” Harry frequently found himself wondering why the old wizard had left him at the Dursley’s when there was a perfectly capable legal guardian waiting for him in the magic world. “Do you think he’s using the stone to carry on living? He seems old enough.”
“I don’t know.” he whispered. “I got angry. He said things to me and he asked me questions that I didn’t want to answer, so I slammed my fist against the barrier and I think it broke or something, but the Prophet says that he got out under mysterious circumstances.”
They stayed in that hug for a very long time, and Dumbledore thankfully didn’t interrupt. But it got sweaty at one point and it just wasn’t as lovable anymore, so they separated, but stayed close as they sat themselves down on a plush sofa, conjured by Moony.
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. He went on to tell the four about how he had actually told the mystery man about Fluffy and how to handle him. It was a little ridiculous. Harry could feel Draco rolling his eyes in exasperation behind him. As soon as Hagrid told them that Fluffy only needed to be played music to fall asleep, Draco tugged on Harry’s arm and dragged him back to the castle, muttering all the way about incompetant fools and dragon-obsessed looneys.
“But…” The girl seemed to be struggling to put her thoughts into words, so Harry gave her time. “You like Draco… romantically…?”
“Now is NOT the time." he roared. "There is no reason to keep a child in an abusive home, I didn’t realise before but I do now. I had a rough upbringing, as you know, as you
They took their stances in the middle of the platform, wands against their faces, staring deep into the other’s eyes. Harry had always known that Draco had beautiful eyes, but had never quite realised how terrifying they could be when they were angry. He noticed the other boy’s lips curl into a snarl.
The professor straightened up and moved to the front of the class, where he inspected his book for a few seconds before slamming it shut suddenly and peering at his class.
“Wonderful. Now, copy the following wand movement.” He demonstrated, they copied. “Amazing!” Remus cleared his throat for dramatic effect. “In order to cast the Patronus charm, the caster will need to think about their happiest memory. It can’t be just any happy memory, mind you, it must be one that fills you with so much joy, it overflows your boundaries and courses into the spell. Do you understand?”
Something he was not happy about, however, was the useless study of Divination, the study that Harry had so ridiculously chosen to engage in that year. Which was what got him in the current position of being told his fortune by his friend.
?” Draco replied snarkily. He honestly didn’t see the point of it at all, he much preferred taking Arithmancy with Hermione, that, at least, was useful.
Harry spent every night for the following two weeks gazing into the mirror. He was exhausted the next day but at least he was happy. Draco continued to tell him that the mirror was some dark piece of magic and that he shouldn’t put so much faith in it, but he didn’t care. He had absolutely no idea what the mirror did, that is until Dumbledore found him.
“Ready?” Harry asked, but he reared back slightly in shock at Draco’s expression, which was fiery and determined, almost mean. He had only seen the other boy look this way when he was in an argument with Ron or when he wanted to beat Hermione, he had never used it on him. “Are you oka-”
“May I ask a question, Professor?” Remus intercepted, holding up his hand as if to pause their conversation. He waited for Dumbledore to nod before continuing. “What will happen to Lucius Malfoy if he is found?”
The conversation throughout the meal was jovial and bright, a nice contrast to the melancholy of the last Hogsmeade weekend, but Harry and Draco had a question they needed to ask which was sure to bring the mood down.
Overall, Harry was so happy. He missed Draco with all his heart, and his dads, but he managed to find ways to forget, Quidditch, exploring the castle, feasts. He wished that he was doing it all with Draco, of course, but the Weasleys weren’t a bad substitute, and he liked having more people in his corner.
“You didn’t know what was so bad?” Remus asked, deciding to play dumb and hope that the problem would fix itself.
“Yes, probably. Uhh, I’m sure Sirius will have a boggart or two at Grimmauld he can bring over here. I’ll ask him.”
If Harry was a Horcrux, and basilisk venom kills horcruxes, why didn't the Horcrux part of him die when he was bitten? Did Fawkes cure the Horcrux as well as him? I know everyone talks about this but it genuinely confuses me.
Harry had almost forgotten his strange power regarding his own fire resistance. With every other strange thing that had happened, he almost didn’t care, speaking to snakes seemed like a bigger deal. However, one night when he was talking to Draco behind the drawn curtains of his Hogwarts bed, the blonde mentioned a moment at Christmas when he had received a snowball in the face from his father, only to find that it felt more like powdered sugar.
Please keep me entertained! I love seeing the little notification that comes up on my phone when I've got a new comment xxx
Draco watched as Harry paled and knitted their hands together in support. His friend gave him a small smile and squeezed. It felt comforting and good.
“Probably something to do with life extension, look at how old he is.” He murmured, fascinated. “I wonder why someone extending their life is a good thing.”
“What is it? Also, it’s Lupin-Black now. You always forget that.” He glanced at Harry. “Hello, Harry. What’re you doing here?”
“Dumbledore told me at the end of their first year, he felt that the situation had become a little more unmanageable.” Dumbledore’s lips quirked wryly, of course he had told the Minister. “So what do you say, Remus? Will you take the job?”
The next morning, Harry and Draco awoke to find the entire world wrapped in a thick blanket of snow. They gasped and ran downstairs only to find a mountain of presents waiting for them under the tree.
It was hard to keep track of it all when he really got started. There was a lot of smashing and screaming and clawing desperately at his chest where his heart had seemed to constrict. When he felt the urge to sink his teeth into warm, human flesh, he sufficed himself with his arms. It hurt, but it was miniscule in comparison to everything else that he was feeling.
Each boy tried about three more times before complaining of weariness, so Remus let them go. By the end of the class, they had both produced bright enough Patronuses to scare off a dementor or two, and they were only thirteen! He didn’t dare think what they’d be capable of in a few years time.
“You can’t stop it, child.” Lucius’s voice was hushed and cold. “The more you fight it, the stronger it gets. That is how the prophecy tells it.”
"You know, Star..." Sirius murmured in his ear. "You have no idea how much I want to just take you back home and let Remus give you a hot chocolate and... send a letter to Dumbledore telling him you'll be taking your classes at home this year."
A few nights later, after catching up on some much needed sleep, Harry decided to test out his new toy. He was going to share this experience with Draco, but quite liked the idea of being on his own the first time, and Draco understood, opting instead to carry on merrily playing his Harmonica in the common room. Harry wandered aimlessly through the halls, marvelling at his now complete invisibility, until he came upon an unused classroom that he had never seen before.
“Umm… princesses, dragons, knights.” He bit his lip. “I know you like to read so I thought you might want to try some Muggle Literature. I’ve never actually read any of them but everyone in the Muggle world knows the big stories.”
“...and then Quirrell was all ‘No- not again, please!’ and then he ran out of the room and Snape looked really pleased and I mean it was so obvious that Snape was torturing him! I bet he was using medieval methods, some really gruesome ones. Maybe Snape is trying to make Quirrell go into the dungeon for him… Or maybe! Oh, Draco, do you remember what Hagrid said about…” Draco drowned the rest of it out as his eyes caught on a hooded figure kneeling over the corpse of something white and glowing, pressing it’s teeth to its neck. The unicorn! Harry had stopped speaking, instead gasping and holding his forehead in pain.
Draco had spent the evening of Valentines Day, while Harry was at Quidditch, to catch up on some homework and look into some defensive spells that his dad had mentioned to him. The day had been wonderful, especially Harry’s little surprise, but he was still just as on edge as he had been all year. Ever since they had discovered that damn message on the wall, the reality of the situation had dawned on him, that Hogwarts was a dangerous place. So, unbeknownst to Harry, Draco had been stealing the other boy’s cloak and spending late hours in the library, researching every defensive spell and practising. So far, he was half a year ahead of his classmates in DADA, which was good, but not good enough. If it came down to it, Draco wouldn’t be able to stand by as the more experienced wizards and witches took the lead, he needed to learn something himself.
“For all eternity.” On the last line, Remus held onto his hands tighter, like he was afraid he would slip away.
And thus the group launched into a conversation about the champions that carried them until it was time to get to bed. Harry and Draco decided through a series of pointed looks that they should sleep in their own beds, which was something they hadn’t done since Draco was in the hospital, and it made Harry slightly uneasy. But he calmed himself through a series of deep breaths that mingled with the sounds of sleep coming from his roommates.
“Strange how short-sighted being invisible can make you.” Dumbledore was an old coot and Harry was at his wits end with these ridiculous riddles. Still, it wasn’t like he could ask the man to leave, especially being that he was apparently the one who gave Harry the invisibility cloak in the first place. “So, you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.”
?” Draco sneered incredulously. Honestly, that was hardly the most shocking part of Harry and Ron’s story. But Draco was rather angry that they were still pursuing this mystery anyway.
“How’re you doing, star?” Pads asked. “I feel like we haven’t gotten a chance to talk alone much, what with Christmas and everything.”
boyfriends and they were both a little nervous to announce this to the group, especially seeing as most of them came from homophobic, pure-blood families.
“Do you want to go, Harry?” Remus eventually asked, expertly managing to sound soothing even with the intense nature of the question.
“I get it, you’re angry because my dad used to be kind of a prick, but he’s grown out of that. You are still the same stuck-up, slimy, evil little bully that you used to be, and that is never going to change.”
The man looked wary and bit his lip, but nodded once he dissected his son’s imploring expression. “Just don’t touch the barrier, remember?”
“Moony taught it to me over Easter, he said it was good for self defence. I don’t know how long it will last so we have to be quick.”
“If Dumbledore thinks it’s safe for me to still attend Hogwarts, you should trust his decision.” Draco didn’t actually think this was true, but thought it held more weight than ‘my dads, the werewolf and the ex-convict, would think you’re being really mean’. “Now, I’m going for a walk, quit watching me. And Harry too, for that matter.”
“No, you’re Sirius.” Remus chuckled internally, unable to resist, but Sirius shot him a glare that shut him up. “Look, I am sure that there is a perfectly legitimate reason for it. We’ll just ask Dumbledore, calmly, this time.”
“Okay. Do you want me to go back to my bed?” Draco was already half asleep, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Oh no…” he moaned, but out of the corner of his eye he could see a figure by one of the pillars. He flipped around, wand held high, running through every spell he had taught himself in the past year. Before he could demand the boy’s identity, he spoke softly to Harry alone.
“I think that’s a bit on the nose, Pads.” replied his husband, drily. Harry made a note to look up that constellation later. Everyone chuckled slightly, even though Harry didn't understand why, and continued to gaze at the diamond encrusted sky.
“Ugly little thing. The ginger one probably just realised that he could do better.” Draco shot her a quelling look. Harry noticed that Draco was rather fond of Hermione. It made sense, they were the top of the class and both loved reading. But their friendship made Harry uncomfortable for some reason, as though Hermione was taking something that was his. But Harry’s train of thought was intercepted by the doors of the Great Hall slamming open to reveal a distressed looking Professor Quirrell, barreling down the middle aisle, screaming.
“Alright, go ahead. But just the stockings, mind you, we’re doing the real presents later.” Remus chided, as he went to go make some hot chocolate. The stockings themselves contained sweets of all shapes and sizes, and small trinkets like Exploding Snap Cards or a toy from Zonko’s. When Moony had passed around a hot chocolate for everyone, Harry and Draco began to calm down, but their faces, Harry’s in particular, were the pictures of ecstasy. The day continued at a lazy pace, Remus began working on dinner while Sirius played in the snow with the boys. Harry seemed unusually sensitive to the cold and found himself in the kitchen, helping Moony, but Sirius and Draco continued playing for longer, throwing snowballs in each other’s faces and making snow angels. At one point, Sirius even transformed into Padfoot and chased Draco around the garden in circles. While they were lying on their backs, after making said snow angels, Sirius grinned lazily.
But he didn’t. “Very good.” muttered Snape, under his breath. “Now, tell me, Mr Malfoy. What happens to a werewolf during their transformation?”
“Harry, I want to tell you this before the owls arrive with the morning post,” she began. Harry started to really worry, had something happened to one of the Lupin-Blacks? To Draco? But before he could continue to fall down this spiral, she continued. “Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father, has escaped from Azkaban.”
“Sirius…” Draco could hear his father’s bickering coming from the fireplace, edging close, and leaped into their warm embrace.
Finally, Harry’s features softened a little. “Fine. But if more bad things start happening, I’m doing more research on it.”
“Yes… yes… thank you.” It was too much, it was all too much. Harry was gasping for air. It was as though somebody had been slowly crushing his lungs with an iron clamp and it had finally loosened. As though he could finally breathe real air again. Sirius had crushed him in another hug and Harry was unashamedly sobbing into his chest as he rubbed his back.
He slept for Merlin knows how long and awoke to the familiar achy feeling of muscles well-used. That was one good thing about being a werewolf - you were forced to exercise.
Draco felt calmer now. He didn’t mind people whispering about him, but people whispering about his parents? Sure, he had been dealing with it his whole life, but for it to be used against them like that, so cruelly. And as for the most shocking part, Draco didn’t quite know how he felt about Moony being a werewolf, the nickname made more sense now. He still loved him, but he wasn’t sure if he still trusted him, Draco internally slapped himself for thinking such an awful thought. Of course he trusted him, he hadn’t hurt him yet! Still, he wanted to have all the information before making a proper decision. And so, Draco made himself more comfortable in his chair and watched his dads with a firm gaze.
This seemed a new concept for Pansy, who was now staring at the floor with a vacant expression. It didn’t seem like she wanted to continue the conversation so Harry went back to his Herbology homework.
Quidditch tryouts were coming up and Harry and Draco couldn’t be more excited. The only position open was Seeker, so Draco had resigned himself to the fact that he probably wasn’t going to get it, but Harry knew that he really wanted it. And Draco was a very good flyer, he could completely take on the Seeker position if he wanted to, and Harry would happily give it to him. But that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to try out at all, Draco had insisted they do it together.
“I’m good.” He nodded. “I’m sad I didn’t get to spend Easter with Draco’s family, and I don’t really know why I couldn’t, but it’s not that bad.” Something about the fire burning in the heath and the tartan decorations made Harry feel safe, and he wanted to open up to the woman.
“No, it’s okay. We can talk.” Everyone cleared out of the room after Draco gave Harry’s hand a parting squeeze, and Harry was left alone with the Headmaster.
“What happened?” The men were on the edge of their seats, desperate to know what could have possibly happened.
Remus glanced at him and looked reluctant. “Fine, give him another minute, but then you really have to go. Send a Patronus to Kingsley.”
The Professor nodded sagely. “Good. But, I hope you don’t mind me saying, Harry, maybe you should try a memory with more emotional value? We want to try everything.”
“Don’t you have something else in your life that brings you joy? Other than tormenting children I mean.” Draco snapped, face set and stormy.
Draco felt as though someone was holding a blinding light up to his eye and yanking his hair, pressing him for answers. His throat closed up but he still managed to keep the tears at bay.
“Uncle Vernon says that gays shouldn’t have children.” A line had formed between the boy’s eyebrows as they furrowed, clearly uncomfortable with his Uncle’s bigotry. Remus wasn’t annoyed in the slightest. Being the teenaged secret of Sirius Black made him well accustomed to homophobic adults indoctrinating children.
Snape banished the snake, and the club was dismissed. Harry had no idea what had just happened, but he wasn’t too pleased about it.
“I love you too.” He breathed and shook his head, pushing the movement aside. He raced down the Slytherin table, sat himself down, and began helping himself to a large serving of the marshmallow cereal they were serving.
“What, Harry Potter, in the name of Salazar Slytherin, was that about? You cannot just leap onto a troll’s back! I swear to Merlin you are going to be the death of me!” Harry looked sheepish and opened his mouth to apologize, but was interrupted by a group of teachers walking in with furious expressions.
Remus, Sirius, Harry and Draco were all standing at King Cross station, bags in hand, ready to pass through the wall to platform 9¾ on the 1st of September. Remus passed through the wall with Sirius and their luggage, leaving Harry and Draco to charge after them.
“Happy Valentine's Day!” the man cried. “And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn’t end here!”
And so they did. They researched ‘Basilisks’ as much as they could, using the special book, but they didn’t get much more information than the page had already told them, that looking directly into the eyes of a Basilisk would kill you, and looking indirectly would presumably Petrify you. They didn’t tell any teachers about the information because, honestly, it wasn’t difficult for two second years to find out, so it must be obvious to teachers.
He clapped his hands decidedly and smiled as brightly as he could. “Let's get started then, shall we?”
The entire class was transfixed on the struggle at play. Some didn’t even know what side they were on, but were enjoying it immensely. Aside from maybe the Slytherins, who would probably have preferred it if their classmate stopped getting points taken from them.
Harry was called into Professor McGonagall’s office on the last day of the holiday for some unknown reason, but he sat down in front of her desk with guilt ridden on his face. He was certain that he was in trouble, but her face said otherwise.
“Harry!” They ran towards each other and embraced in a tight bear hug. “Oh, I missed you, kid. And so did Draco, we’ve been worried sick!”
“Both your son, and Harry, have been sorted into Slytherin House.” Sirius gasped but Remus felt only confused. Of course, it made little difference to him that it was Slytherin House in particular, although it would to his husband, what really bothered him was that Draco and Harry would be living in the same room for the next seven years. He couldn’t begin to comprehend the effects this would have. “You can clearly see the difficulty. But, I think this may be a good thing. We can observe. And they will be under my watchful eye, so I promise, I will report anything that happens.”
Draco rose in his seat. “My dad will be back by then, are you really going to make him read forty essays on how dangerous of a creature he is? Are you really that cruel?”
They were interrupted though at two points, first by a dough-faced boy complaining about a lost toad, and a bushy-haired girl inquiring after, presumably, the same toad. But aside from that, the conversation flowed naturally. It was as though the boys had known each other all their lives. Harry was reluctant to leave when Draco suggested they get into their robes. After changing, it wasn’t long before they pulled up at Hogsmeade station and joined the rest of the students on the platform.
“Aha!” Harry exclaimed, bending down to scoop it up, but the thing ran away and out of his sight, and before he could chase after it, a menacing hand clasped itself around his shoulder. The cloak had fallen off.
