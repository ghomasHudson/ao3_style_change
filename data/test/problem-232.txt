Hailee turned her head to look at the sleeping girl next to her. Malfoy always looked at peace when she was sleeping. No matter if there was thunder or it was burning up, she was always peaceful looking. Hailee took in all of Malfoy's features. Her straight, whitish-blonde hair that was scattered among the pillow she lied on. Her pointy jaw-line that Hailee loved to move her tongue over while Malfoy moaned and writhed beneath her. Hailee moved her gaze to the other girl's eyes.
"Hi, baby," Harry cooed at him, kissing James' forehead. I smiled at them when James started giggling, running his hands through Harry's hair. He'd grown it out and it now reached just below his ears. Mine was at my tailbone now and Teddy loved trying (and failing) to make his hair look like mine.
Ginny tried her best to put up a smile, her dad at her side, arms intertwined.
I smirked at him.
"You should be able to see your son whenever you like, not only during the week. I'm so sorry, Draco," She said.
I found myself straddling his lap, elbows resting on his shoulders, his hands warm on my hips as our heavy make-out turned into lazy kissing, lips moving together sloppily
I whispered the counter-curse and both of them made small sounds to test their voice.
When I open them, Harry has tears in his eyes as he stares at us. The judge's eyes are red as she suppressed tears.
"I didn't think you'd make it," He sobbed, kissing my lips repeatedly.
"It's alright. James was too busy stuffing his face with yogurt and the silencing charm between here and the boy's room is still up so Teddy didn't hear anything," I explained. He nodded, then gestured to the floo. I nodded.
"I don't know," I gritted out between my teeth. My mother looked pitifully down at me.
I hugged Scorpius before standing up again, hugging Pansy.
I see Scorpius up in the stands, but instead of sitting on my mother's lap, he sat next to Harry. Pansy was sitting on the right of Scorpius, holding his hand. I expect to see Harry looking murderous at the fact that I was free. Instead, he looked very relieved and my eyebrows furrowed. Mother sat next to Pansy, looking anxious.
When we pulled away, the three red-heads were pointing their wands in the air, chanting a spell under their breath.
Ginerva was looking a bit faint now and was fanning herself with her hand. Even though I didn't like her, I sent a wordless, wandless cooling charm in her direction.
I tuned out the world for a minute, replacing Ginerva with me. Did I wonder if Harry, even for a second, pictured me in her position instead? Me wearing white dress robes, walking next to my mother as tears blurred my vision. Would he cry?
Harry pulled Draco into an embrace and kissed his cheek, nosing his neck. Draco let himself laugh, smiling brightly, leaning into Harry.
"We will," Draco responds with a small nod.
Ginny wasn't defending herself saying that
"Do we have a name?" Healer Marchell asked, coming up beside me.
He shoved me again.
"Help Mummy take these to the kitchen then you can go play in your room, ok?" I told Teddy, who nodded, marching proudly to the kitchen, bags in hand.
Harry came down a few moments later, Lyra, now six, with her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck. She was smiling, big and wide at me and I smiled back at her.
". I nodded my head enthusiastically.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looks up at me and gives me a sheepish smile.
"Fuckkkk, yes," I moan before leaning back down to take Harry into my mouth. My lips stretch wide and I feel the mushroom head it the back of my throat and I thank Merlin for not giving me a gag-reflex.
"Fucking hell, you better still have it," Malfoy moans. Hailee understands immediately what she's talking about. Hailee reaches around in the drawer of her nightstand and pulls of the emerald green strap-on. Malfoy moans at the sight of it.
"Yes," I say, walking out of the closet, now fully clothed. He nods, turning around down the hallway, most likely to go get the boys.
He's the only one to this day who knows what I did. I tried to cut the dark mark out of my arm.
Nothing was the same.
"I WANT DADDY!" Scorpius screams, kicking his legs as he reaches for me. I try to run after him but Aurors stop me, two of them holding me back.
I would generally give James the entire thing but dinner was soon and I didn't want him to be too full.
Harry gave a timid nod.
Harry comes back into the room now,
ago to become married magically connected me and our children to the ownership of this house,
I had been ready to deny Molly right out. If Ginerva was willing to throw hexes with James (an innocent two-year-old) in the room then Merlin knows what she would be willing to do with James
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ginerva?" I countered.
simple.
and when she obliged, I smiled at him). When James began crying because he dropped a bite of spaghetti, Ginerva rolled her eyes and huffed loudly, mumbling something along the lines of "demon baby" and "death-eater spawn" to which I discreetly threw a harsh stinging hex at her which resulted in her death-glaring at me and me looking sickeningly innocent.
"I'm wanna ride you, Daddy," Malfoy whimpered, watching the tan girl beneath her. When the strap-on was secure, Malfoy slid back up, ready to impale herself on the silicone before Hailee pulled her down for a kiss.
"7. Which means I'd drop Scorp off at about 6:30," I told her. she looked sadly at me.
After a cheeky little speech on how Harry couldn't keep his hands off me, it was time to find out the gender. At the party, three people knew already. Pansy and Noah were at the appointment with me and they had been the ones who the doctor told. I also gave Noah permission to tell Charlie so, as long as Pansy didn't run her big mouth, only those three knew.
Hailee sighed and leaned back, staring at the ceiling of the abandoned Ancient Ruins classroom they do it in. They meet every night unless one of them absolutely cannot make it. They usually do.
Harry held me to his side as Pansy and I talked about her new Louis Vuitton bag that Blaise had bought her as an engagement present. I cooed over it and began crying when her wallet was a different color than the bag, when they were, in fact, a set.
"Draco," She says with a smile. I grin right back.
"Damnit, Potter," Her strong accent drawls. Hailee looks at her with question. "You move too god damn much, honestly," And then Malfoy is on top of her, straddling her waist.
at her. Her wand soured through the air and I caught it without a second glance. She let out a sound of disbelief and protest.
" Malfoy let out between bounces. Hailee moaned as the strap-on teased her clit with it's vibrating while Malfoy's bounces added pressure that Hailee wanted to die from. She tried to imagine what Rox and Holden would say if she died because of Malfoy's sex. Nothing good, she guessed.
"Where's Harry?" She hissed. I adjusted my grip on James.
"Wan Dada," James whined. I smiled lightly at how well he was learning to speak.
"He hasn't yet," She responded.
"I don't have to explain anything to
"Your baby is the size of a poppy seed!" Luna said from another couch.
The day Harry and I began going out, it was national news that The Chosen One's girlfriend had disappeared, leaving only a note explaining that she "needed a break after fighting so hard". Harry found me in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, my arm streaming blood.
Healers ran to the other side of the room with her.
Hell, I didn't know. That was the point, of course, I hadn't known with James either. We didn't have a gender reveal for James. Somehow, I'd known.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you," I said sheepishly, scared to meet his eyes.
"Ginny, don't," Hermione said before Ginerva even opened her mouth, looking at her like a mother would look at a child after they drew on the walls with a sharpie.
I felt Harry's arm wind around my waist and my anger went down so fast my head was spinning. I leaned on him, feeling the warmth of his torso leak through my (his) old shirt. It went almost down to my knees and had new holes every time I washed it.
"Here, love, James wants you," I said softly. James reached his arms out and whined out for Harry. Harry's angry expression was gone in a second, smiling as he pulled James into his arms.
Teddy wriggled his way off the counter and ran into the living room and when I arrived there, he sat a few feet away from James playpen, stacking the blocks Hermione had bought him last month. I smiled and watched him for a few more moments before walking over to James, lifting him out of his playpen, and smiling at the giggle he gave. His hands fisted into my hair and I began to walk up the stairs, taking him to his and Teddy's shared room.
"Mind telling me what the bloody hell you're on about?" I said, crossing my arms over my chest.
Malfoy moaned into the kiss as she dropped down onto Hailee's dick, throwing her head back as it started vibrating. Hailee stared up at the pale girl in wonder, rubbing her hands down Malfoy's sides.
With the boys gone and dinner dishes finished, I wiped my hands on the towel that next to the sink for that exact reason and turned around to where a still sulking Ginerva Weasley sat at my kitchen table. Harry had escaped downstairs to the basement to grab a bottle of wine at my suggestion and, now that I'm sitting here face-to-face with his ex, I wish I had been the one to go to the basement.
"Better be, Ravenclaw!" The Sorting Hat called. Ravenclaw house began clapping, cheering on their new housemate.
Hour 4
"DADDY!" Scorpius screamed, jumping out of his seat and running over to me. I put my arms out and let him throw himself at me.
https://youtu.be/-oqUZ2jz5FM
"I could never hate you," he said.
"Not your fault," I muttered against his lips, before pressing them back to his. He squeezed my hips and I pulled away, resting my forehead against his. A moment later, he moves us. Now, my head is resting on his shoulder, my hair to his neck. He rests his head lightly against the back of my head.
Xoxo, Tiffany
I quickly ran over to my wand, lifting up and waving it in the air, demanding it to call my husband.
Sorry for the wait!
"You will do amazing things, son. I got you a little something," Harry pulled out two chocolate frogs.
saying anything bad about my husband or our kids ever again!" He was in her face now, their noses almost touching. His face was painted red with anger and his magic felt even stronger. Ginny sat there, her mouth opening, then closing again.
I turned to my husband now. I expected him to look ashamed or embarrassed. Instead, he looked annoyed.
"How?" Draco ponders a second later, turning around to look up at Harry, who has the beginnings of a smile around his mouth.
Teddy's eyes filled with tears.
"Harry Potter, right?" He asked. I nodded before doubling over in pain.
Hailee rustled more, not sure if she wanted to face her lover or not. She continued rolling over, around, trying not to wake Malfoy. Hailee was brought out of her thoughts when Malfoy rustles beside her.
Malfoy's eyes were closed but Hailee didn't need them open to know what they looked like. The outer ring was grey, simple, stormy, grey. But, Hailee knew, the closer to the pupil, the more silver Malfoy's eyes seemed to be. The flecks of pewter color that did things to Hailee.
Well, we've come a long way. I honestly cannot thank you guys enough for the number of reads on Come Back, I Still Need You, and Hold On, I Still Want You. This is unreal and I have you all to thank.
"Please," Draco said, "one more time I want to hear your voice call me your love, please, Harry!" Draco was screaming, tears running down his face. "I love you, come back to me. Don't leave me," Draco leaned down, making their foreheads touch, "come back for your little dragon,". Draco kissed the lifeless lips, tears falling down onto Harry's face. Draco leaned back and took Harry's glasses off his face. "G-goodbye, My Love," he said, his sobs making his small frame shake.
"I love you and I love our kids and I love that you're pregnant," It's mumbled into Draco's hair and the blond feels himself smile. Taking a moment to put the words in the right order, Draco speaks.
"I'm going to get breakfast started. Make sure the kids are awake for me, yeah?" I asked with another kiss on his forehead. I felt him nod rather than see it and smiled as I slipped out of the bed for the second time.
Neville wasn't smiling.
"Enough," I rasp out. Harry merely sucks again.
his father?" He yelled, looking at me with a painful expression. I shook my head.
I turned on my heel and ran straight into my husband's room.
So now that I already had that answer, I wasn't as shocked when I got pregnant again.
Harry seems like he doesn't believe me.
"Gods, I've missed your cooking," I say, shoveling another bite into my mouth. He stares at me.
Sunday Roast went better than I expected.
"I love you!" Harry growled, putting Draco down and nestling his face in the blond's neck. Draco's arms went around Harry's waist before they shared a short kiss and Teddy let out a sound of protest.
"Hey, Draco, everything alright?" She asked. I resisted rolling my eyes because no, everything was not alright.
"Harry," I sobbed.
"No, we aren't!" She said exasperatedly.
"I raised him. I saw his first steps, I woke up with him at night. I was the one who went through the terrible twos with him. I am his mother," I said. The judge stared.
"Good morning, James,"
"Daddy is going to take you to Nana Cissy's for a bit, sound good?" I asked him. He nodded and jumped off my lap, walking over to Harry.
Except for this month, Ginerva Weasley was attending.
All I could do was hold him and promise that I wouldn't leave.
I look down and Scorpius is staring up at me with those big green eyes. He holds his arms up for me to pick him up. Ignoring whatever the judge hisses at me, I pick him up, balancing him on my hip like I've done so many times before.
"I don't care! I don't care! You're pregnant and we're gonna have a big happy family!" Harry is sitting with his knees tucked under him, holding a pillow to his chest.
"I don't like tea," Ginerva stated. Harry threw a look at her.
Putting the pieces together, I realize what I did.
Hermione was beside me a second later, her wand pointed at the woman with a sneer that rivaled the ones I used to throw at Harry across the Great Hall at Hogwarts (which was another story).
There were tears running down Draco's pale cheeks as he whispered, "Expecto Patronum,".
(See the end of the chapter for
the kids are out of the house," I said calmly, turning to Ginerva. She huffed, but obliged, sinking back into the cushions of the couch.
Song for this chapter;
Instead, the seven-year-old Metamorphogus ran and threw himself at my legs. I looked down at him and smiled, ruffling his hair with my hand and leaning down to pick him up.
"You're gonna sit with her for a little bit, okay? Tell her about your bedroom at Nana Cissy's house," I told him. Scorpius always had problems talking to people, so I liked to give him little prompts.
"I'm sorry, Draco, I have a meeting with Kingsley," before she could go into a rant about how sorry she was, I cut her off.
Hermione didn't have a book in her hand.
I open my eyes and look up at Harry. He's still asleep, gorgeous green eyes locked shut. His long eyelashes cast small shadows under his eyes in the faint light coming from the en suite. I then realize my shirt has been taken off and my skinny jeans replaced with a pair of Harry's old trackies that had to be tied as tight as possible in the waist so I could wear them.
When Ron heard the door lock he immediately ran to it. He had seen Harry walk up here. Harry had tried to take his own life only one other time.
me. My back arches off the bed and a horse scream make its way out of me when he plants his lips around my hole and
I heard something shatter in the living room and ran down the hallway, shielding James with my arms.
James in arms, Teddy clinging onto my leg, my mouth fell open. Harry held his head in his hands. An overwhelming sense of possessiveness came over me when I realized he was still in his pajamas, even more so after remembering his pajamas consisted of only trackies.
"What are
"Later, inside me," I beg. He smirks evilly.
"How do you feel?" He asked softly. I suppressed a snort, instead, I sent a soft smile to Harry, who sent one right back.
"We have a son?" He finally got out. I nodded.
I turned to Ginerva. She stared at me with a look of hatred and I gave her a dark glower right back.
Soon, we found our way around the supermarket, Teddy complaining as I spent five minutes in the produce section, picking out tomatoes for dinner.
"I asked everyone to find you. I went to the Manor, I went to Pansy's, I looked so hard for you,". My expression softened.
"I don't wanna go with him, Daddy, I wanna stay with you," Scorpius sobbed.
Pregnant.
"Do you also remember not using a condom..?" Draco had tears falling now, looking down at his lap, his long hair shielding his face from Harry.
After becoming an Auror, he's gained many scars on his chest. I lean in to kiss the scar right below his collarbone, where the part of Voldemort's soul once seared through his skin. It's not my first time touching, kissing, or even tasting the blemished skin there but Harry reacts the same way he did the first time I kissed one of his scars. He inhales deeply before running his fingers through my hair, my name whispered on his lips.
"Draco, what aren't you telling me," Letting go of Harry's hand, Draco fiddled with his hands, ignoring Harry's eye-contact at all costs.
"Start from the beginning," Harry said, covering my hand with his own. He looked at me reassuringly, nodding his head for me to talk.
When he finally sits the pasta down in front of me, I don't hesitate to quickly shove some of it into my mouth, moaning at the taste.
"No, I'm not letting you go, not again, never again," He said. His words made me momentarily freeze as his words sunk in.
"Molly, love, why don't I help you in the kitchen? I want to talk with Andy, too," Mother's eyes are glued onto Ginerva the entire time and I see Harry gently push her towards the kitchen to make sure she doesn't hex the ginger's breasts off.
"Why are we not focusing on the matter at hand?!" I bit back a sigh as Ron turned to his sister.
Looking around, I see everyone was knocked over.
It was Harry's.
"HARRY, LISTEN!" I cried, tears streaming down my face. I turned my back to the door, leaning against it as I slid into a mess on the floor, crumpling into a ball as my sobs echoed around the hallway.
It was another week until Sunday Roast, where Harry and Draco decided to tell everyone. Even their boys didn't know yet.
"Mumma!" I turned as Teddy ran into the kitchen. Ginny looked taken aback for a moment before smirking smugly. I quirked an eyebrow at her and when she put her arms out, I realized why.
With one final hug, I made Scorpius hold onto me tight and we apparated to our flat.
"Before we begin, does anyone have any objections," I stared at the ground helplessly. Sure, I could make an objection but I was not a homewrecker. I'd just go back to the Manor and pick up Scorpius, the son Harry didn't know we had, and bring him home to our flat. I'd let him tire himself out then give him a nap as I made dinner.
"You can go to your room but I want you to go the long way, ok, love?" I told him, sticking out my pinky. Teddy clasped his pinky in mine and kissed the back of his fist and I did the same.
"That's amazing!" Draco's head snapped up to see Harry smiling, confusion flickering across the blond's face.
"Are you telling me you're..?" Draco didn't trust his voice, simply nodding.
"Come in," I said cooly, turning around and stalking into the house. As I walked through the living room, I leaned over and sat James in his playpen.
"Oh, fucks sake!" I screamed, trying again. The call was left unanswered. I grumbled, calling Hermione instead.
"I could've done that," I said, leaning in the doorframe.
"Who is this?" Harry demanded, looking upset. Before giving me a chance to respond, he stood up quickly, throwing the book at me. I dodged it.
"Harder, oh dear god, please go harder," I'm begging shamelessly at this point. When his hand wraps around the base of my cock, my eyes fly open and I'm scratching at his back.
"Mum, you can't be serious-"
"Because I made a mistake," Harry says simply, crouching down to be at eye level with a still-angry Scorpius. I just watch them, my tears slowing. Harry looks at me then.
When we found ourselves in the frozen section, I grabbed a bag of dinosaur chicken nuggets, much to my godson's appreciation. Squeezing Teddy's hand, he looked up at me with big brown eyes.
Usually, the view of The Burrow just beyond the horizon from the apparation point would make me calm down because
Draco leaves the house with the kids for a bit.
"But Mumma-"
Everyone simply thought that long-sleeves were my style or that I didn't go swimming because I didn't know how. They didn't know the nitty-gritty details of my life.
"Mr. Potter will have full custody of Scorpius Malfoy while Mr. Malfoy will have monitored visits every two weeks," Judge Marigolds ruled.
Sticking the plastic spoon into the light pink snack and slid it onto the tray of James' high chair. He let out a sound of approval and dug in, scooping some of the yogurts onto his spoon and stuffing it into his mouth. As he busied himself with eating, I put the groceries away and threw the reusable bags underneath the sink, beside the cleaning supplies.
"Draco!" Molly was rushing out of the kitchen, throwing a kitchen towel to rest on her shoulder, her arms spread to pull me into a hug. I smiled widely at her, letting her pull me into one of those hugs that have you gasping for air when you pull away from how tight you were smushed together. None the less, my arms swung up to wrap around her shoulders, pressing a kiss to her cheek.
"Let go!" I growl out. I'm thrashing in his arms, trying as hard as possible to get him to let go of me. Instead of loosening his grip, he tightens his arms around me, squeezing my to his as hard as possible.
"Harry," i sighed. He looked at me, just stared down at me.
Scorpius is sobbing as he reaches for me. I can do nothing but cry hopelessly while screaming that I love him. But seeing Scorpius being taken away sparks something inside of me.
Our lips move lazily and the morning breath is something we can deal with as long as it means we can lie with each other for just a minute longer, touch each other for just another second.
-Minerva McGonagall
"Mr. Potter, please come with us," A kind voice sounded. I turned to see a Healer. She wasn't my Healer, but she'd do.
"Mumma! Dad!" He cheered, throwing himself at Harry, who lifted him and hoisted him onto his hip with a huge grin. Molly came around the corner a second later, James in one hand and a sippy-cup in the other.
"Why'd you make my Daddy cry?"
She was coming. I knew it. I clutched at my stomach as a contraction came.
"My parents definitely had a hard time raising me," Scorpius started. I felt Harry grip my hand a bit tighter and I turned my head to look at him. He smirked at me and I smiled, my eyes flickering down to our wedding bands. Turning back to Scorpius, I stared in awe of the young man he'd become.
"NO!" I screamed out. Everyone turned to me. Tears were in my eyes.
"Gin, Draco isn't my maid," He said slowly. Her face scrunched.
"I wanted them to be able to see you off too," Harry said, hugging Teddy.
Handing the frog to Laura, who obliged happily, he tore into the second one, this time giving the frog to Jonah.
Sirius wiped away another tear as he looked himself in the mirror. He stared at himself, lips trembling as he wished so hard that he could be hugging Harry close to his chest, helping his walk out of the hospital wing rather then what he was about to do, escort his godson out in a casket to the graveyard.
"Harry and Malfoy are having a death eater as a baby!"
Especially when James groaned in protest.
"Bring it in, you lot," Teddy said. The large family all bundled into a hug together and, less than 10 minutes later, Draco was crying as he waved Teddy goodbye.
"Uh oh," She whispered.
Draco was lying on the bed, his mother at his side. There were tears on his cheeks and he was squeezing Narcissa's hand so tightly it looked broken. When he saw me, he began crying.
"Draco can handle himself, I know that better than anyone, that's why I've stayed back but I'm done with you're shit! Don't you ever,
"It's not what you think," I said, standing up. Harry pushed me away.
Blaise wasn't laughing at their jokes.
"But he woke me up early to check my measurements," She said, her hands playing in Harry's hair. He'd begun to grow it out and liked putting it in a man bun while at work. Laura had made quick work of the hair tie and put it around her thin wrist. Her small fingers ran through it and he suppressed winces when she tugged her fingers through a knot.
"Today, class, we will be talking about The Patronus Charm," Hermione squeaked while Ron frowned.
"There's no need for that, Gin, Draco wouldn't mind making you something, right?" He said, turning to me. I shook my head.
"Anything to drink?" He asks. He doesn't let me respond, he's already reaching into the fridge, pulling out a bottle of Ribena, my favorite drink. His least favorite. I don't ask him why he carries Ribena when he absolutely can't stand it, instead, I accept the glass of the blackcurrant Ribena and take a sip, savoring the purple liquid as it slides down my throat.
"Ugh!" I choked out, letting out a strangled sort of sob.
"Grow a pair and kiss him already!" Ginny yelled. I laughed lightly and Harry flushed.
I think back to the owl Molly sent us yesterday, begging for us to come to the Roast because
," Harry pulls back and I almost come at the sight. His face is flushed and his lips are swollen. His hair is messy, messier than usual, from me tugging at it and his thick, beautiful cock is standing proudly.
!" She fired back before taking a, somewhat harsh, bite of pumpkin pie and sinking back into her seat. I felt my stomach churning with a horrid burning I hadn't felt in years. I felt the stinging of tears behind my eyelids and suddenly felt the need to blink rapidly. My chest constricted tightly and I felt ready to faint. I shot up from my chair.
"We've been doing everything we can to get ahold of him, no one can reach him," I let out a sob of protest. Someone had to be able to reach him. I heard a crash in the hallway and Healer Marshell whipped around to look, then looked back at me and smiled.
I held four bags. One was filled with ground beef and the bag of chicken nuggets, along with a bag of frozen chips. The second had two boxes of spaghetti noodles with the breadsticks. The third held a bottle of Merlot. The final bag had two tubs of ice cream I grabbed when Teddy turned a blind eye.
"Let me go!" I cry out, thrashing harder. Again, he tightens his hold and squeezes me to his chest.
"I love hearing you say my name," He says. Another lick.
After seven years of visiting multiple mind-healers, dreamless sleep potions, tender and caring love from Harry, the happiness from Teddy, and a miracle baby, I was okay again.
"Mother," I respond.
"Can I... can I talk to you?" I turned around to be met with the man I once fell in love with. I nodded. I turned back to Granger.
Blaise and Harry never got along well. They didn't hate each other but weren't the closest of friends.
"I love you more than anything in the
"Absolutely!" He chuckles at me, holding his hand out and inviting me into the flat. I take his hand and feel electricity zap its way through my arm.
"You little-"
Opening it, I leaned down to the bottom left drawer and pulled it out to reveal different cold things, including yogurt. I pulled out a strawberry one, something my son and I had in common and sat it on the counter.
"So, I put the little one down for a nap, I believe it's your turn, young man," I said, looking down at him playing with blocks. Teddy huffed.
"Yes. About Scorpius," He said. I could hardly look into his eyes.
"How much do you get paid?" She asked suddenly. I stood gobsmacked for a few moments.
Ron sat on another couch, nodding his head fondly. Hermione sat next to him, shaking his arm and whisper-yelling things like
"You're Harry's maid and nanny, so how much does he pay you?" I almost lost my footing and stared at her with wide eyes. In the corner of my eye, I saw Harry choke on his tea.
"This is your Aunt Hermione," I said. Hermione gasped, tears coming to her brown eyes.
"Bullshit!"
"About 4 weeks," I said, smiling as I felt Harry's hand rest on my stomach.
" I cried, throwing a wordless silencing charm around the room so I wouldn't wake the kids.
"I love you," Harry muttered into my ear. I smiled.
Ginerva and Harry were now in the living room, sitting closer than I liked on the couch, and watching something on the telly. Teddy was still playing with his blocks and sent me a smile when I walked in the room, his eyes momentarily flashing grey.
"Hello, handsome," I greeted, sitting him on the counter, allowing him to watch as I continued to clean the dishes. Teddy giggled every time I splashed water on him and I'd smile at him.
sip at James' baby shower, but let me live).
They heard a clatter and Harry dropped his head onto Draco's shoulder. Draco laughed.
The Great Hall wasn't loud.
Ok that's it I'm going on actual hiatus now LMAO. I said I was going to go on hiatus two days ago now here we are ASFHASHFBLKF.
"Seriously what, Ginny?" He said, his arm coming around my waist.
"You tried to take him from me. My son, our son," I said, my words somewhat muffled by his chest but I knew he heard me.
"Mhm," Luna nodded.
"Do you have a proper argument as to why this is unfair?" Judge Marigolds said, one of her eyebrows arched.
"Draco," he breathed. He let us into the flat and I felt a lump in my throat when I realized he hadn't redecorated. As we walked to the couch, I threw a wandless, wordless cleaning spell at it. Scorpius was about to sit down there and I knew the things Harry and I had done on it.
But no matter how much they didn't get along, Blaise broke down crying in the back of the classroom, his sobs silencing the room.
I'd rather die than put my kids in danger.
"Hey, daddy he has my middle name!" Scorpius said excitedly. I wanted to slap my hand across his mouth the second the words escaped it. A light seemed to flick on in Harry's brain and he stared at me.
"What?" I ask with my mouth full, sending him a dark look. He smiled at me and leaned over the table to wipe the side of my mouth, laughing lightly.
Harry was the love of my life too, mind you.
"We... are?" It came out as a question.
After the war, I swore to never judge anyone without getting the know them first but...
That was (kind of) the last chapter! An epilogue is on it's way (don't ask when, I don't know AKJFKLFKAFSDJFK)
SELF HARM WARNING!
"Yes, now, now-" My words are cut off by a scream as he pushes into me with one thrust. My back arches and I tug him down to kiss me. He begins slowly thrusting as I fist my hands into his hair.
"I was too fast to assume something and too stubborn to let your daddy explain," Harry continues. Scorpius huffs. Then, he's stomping over to me. He looks at me, then turns back to Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Gonna love hearing you scream it in a minute," He sounds so confident and then he's thrusting his tongue
"Laura," We said together.
"Please, Harry!" I gasp out, my fingers fisting into his hair as if on autopilot.
I could feel my life falling apart as she stood here, at our front door. I balanced James on my hip and just stared at her.
"I'll be back in a week, I promise. I won't be gone long at all," He said. I shook my head.
Oh boy, this one is sad
Hailee looked at the nightstand on Malfoy's side and immediately spotted the blonde's signature headband. She'd worn it ever since Hailee could remember. It was thick and Slytherin green and Malfoy used to use it to push the stray hairs out of her face before deciding to make it part of her everyday outfit.
After a few minutes of simply staring at Harry, his eyes flutter, revealing a small ring of green, his pupils blown wide before they contract quickly. Harry blinks a few times before his eyes meet mine. I smile. He smiles back softly.
And anyone who said it was bullshitting you.
Scorpius looks at Harry then.
The judge clears her throat and everyone's attention goes back to her.
It was Luna Lovegood.
If she's a Ravenclaw, we'll have every house in our family, Teddy thought, grinning stupidly.
"You have a son!" He exclaimed happily. Scorpius was on my lap, playing with the long strands of my hair. I whipped around to him.
"Yes," Draco said, smiling, taking Harry's hand. "We really rather do."
Harry, unaccountably, wanted to cry. He swallowed. "Something normal, then. Something plain."
"Neither do you," Sheila said, and Harry thought,
"Emotional growth, isn't it?"
section. "It's about the size of an orange," he said, and his fingers twitched as he read,
Draco's skin was flushed. "I don't do this very often, all right? I don't spend that much time needing to know where we're at in the moon cycle."
Ron let out a long, loud breath. "No," he said finally. "Other than I think maybe I'll write a letter to Hogwarts too."
"I'm an Instagram star, Granger," Draco says. "And Potts here is my assistant-slash-flatmate. And now i have to be photographed being bathed by the early evening sunlight," Draco says, draping himself on the windowsill, ginger beer still in hand.
Harry, for his sins, got dressed and went to the library.
Hermione tried to smile. "He might not be right but he's trying to do the best thing for Jonny. You might just have to respect that."
"That's good," Harry says, amused. "Is it how hot you look in the jeans? Can I see?"
"Ferret face," Ron went on. "You've fucked Ferret face."
"Hmmm," Harry says, since, underneath the moody glances into the middle distance and the obsession with lighting angles, Draco is the happiest he's ever been in his whole entire life. Harry's not entirely sure why he's the only one that can see it, although he supposes that no one else is here late at night when Draco curls into Harry's side with his phone in hand as he makes plans for upcoming content. It's almost like removing themselves from being force fed the impact of their own childhood trauma every day has been good for them emotionally; who knew.
McGonagall wasn't asking people to quiet down.
"What if I have kept a secret from you?" I asked him. He didn't waste a second before responding.
"Scorpius is my baby!" I cry, turning back to the judge. I can't stop the tears coming down now.
He got up from the red, soft chair he was sitting in and picked up the paper, tucking it into the pocket of his jacket, walking out of Gryffindor Common Room, and towards the Astronomy Tower.
Draco never went. Hermione and Ron would skip occasionally. The teachers let the small group of Draco, Hermione, Ron, and Pansy pass if needed.
"Daddy, do you have a boyfriend?" An excited voice asked. Harry's eyes widened and they flew down to Scorpius. I knew the cat was out of the bag. Harry's eyes met Scorpius'. They were identical.
Because I woke up to Ginerva Weasley sitting in my living room.
"Bloody hell, baby!"
But I didn't. Instead, I broke down, letting the tears stream down my face, and nuzzled into his neck. His arm went around my waist and he held me to him tightly. My arms were bent in between us and I splayed my palms out across his chest.
"You're so cute, baby," Harry coos.
"Come again?" Cho Chang's voice broke through the silence.
"Seriously?" She said. Like that- all of the smiles were replaced with frowns and looks of annoyance.
"No," Ron banged on the door. "Harry! Harry, please let me in!" He heard Harry sigh. "I'm so sorry, Ron," Harry walked to the edge and Ron was able to bust the door open just in time to see his best mate jump to his death.
Before I could react, he had his hand around my wrist and was yanking me down to his chest, a short sound of protest making its way out of my throat. I laughed as Harry began pressing kisses all over my neck. I pulled him up by his face and kissed him, hard.
"I wasn't sure how you liked your tea so I brought-"
"How could you do that?" I asked him, staring into his green eyes. Too bloody green. His face contorts into one of confusion, eyebrows furrowed, and his forehead creases.
Clearing my throat, I slid into the seat I sat at during dinner, across from Ginerva. I made sure that James sat to my left and Teddy stayed on my left. Since Harry sat at the head of the table, James was also next to him.
My eyes flickered to his middle finger, where a divide symbol lay. I showed him my hand, revealing the multiplication sign on my middle finger.
Professor McGonagall broke through the crowd that was forming, tears running down her pale face. Harry was taken to the hospital wing. And at 2:21 am on a rainy Tuesday morning, the Wizarding World lost their golden boy.
"It's, ok, shh, it's alright,".
An hour later, there was still no sight of Harry.
"Daddy, why is Harry upset?" Scorpius asked me, his big, innocent eyes looking up at me.
And I do. I love him so, so much. And no one, not Weaslette, not even Mother can make that change.

Noah bit their lip on a giggle.
Her crying slowed as the Healers lied a blanket over her and she simply sleeped on my chest.
"Why did you have to come here? Why couldn't you go to Weasley Central?" I heard Harry snort at my long-time nickname for The Burrow and Ginerva's brown eyes narrowed into slits.
"No, I need my husband, please!" I begged her.
The End
Grabbing the container of yogurt, I opened it and began to lick the leftover yogurt from the foil lid, and grabbed one of the spoons that came in the set with the bowls (that also came with plates and cups, along with forks and very dull knives) to scoop some of the yogurts into the bowl.
"Draaacooo," Harry moaned from the bed. I snorted, sticking my head out from where I was getting dressed.
"Harry, I'm so sorry, but I love Ginny so much. I know she doesn't want this and I especially know that you don't want this either, your heart is with someone else," My ears perked up at that. Hermione looked at me and I shook my head because
I nod.
"Of course, I should've told you, I'm so sorry," I say. Instead of responding, he grabs my hand and leads me into the living room, sitting down on the sofa. I sit down next to him.
I saw Harry's eyes widen and he tightened his hold on Scorpius, holding him that much tighter.
this is
She stood in the corner of the room, smiling softly. Molly stood next to her, hands clasped over her mouth in excitement. Andromeda stood beside Molly, wearing the same smile Mother was and sending me a sort of
I gave Scorp a kiss on the cheek before setting him down on Harry's doorstep. Harry never moved, he stayed in our old flat. I thought about our memories here. I thought about the last time I had touched this door. 4 years ago when I left.
"Right, Charlie, would you mind holding James for a bit?" I turned around, the first person I saw being the tall, tan dragon-tamer. He smiled widely, his partner, Noah, at his side. Noah smiled at me and put their arms out for James. I smiled back at them and handed James to them, letting James babble about something or other.
But here I was, walking up to the acacia wood door, Harry's hand slipping out of my own so he could open the door, strutting through the door as if he lived there his entire life. I snorted at my thought before following him through, Teddy running into the kitchen where Andromeda always sat, drinking tea, mixing in Malt when she thought no one was watching.
It was my sworn rule, though. I would never smoke (not that I did anyway) or drink while pregnant (I did have a
"Do what? Live my life? Marry the love of my life? For fucks sake, Gin, just because you left so suddenly doesn't mean everyone's life stopped. You missed so many weddings, so many babies. You left," Harry ranted.
Three days later found them in Luna Lovegood's office in the maternity ward of St Mungos.
throw hexes with
"Harry-"
"Talk to me," Draco's head shoots up as Harry walks into the room, flopping down on their bed. He's on his stomach, chin resting on his hands as he stares up at Draco.
"I'm in labor!" I growled, biting back a whine when another contraction hit. The receptionist nodded, thank god there were smart people in this world. He quickly waved his wand at a stack of papers and they flicked to the middle. He then called a number using his wand.
"Fucks sake, Ginny, you broke up with me over owl the week after you left," Harry said, pinching the bridge of his nose between his forefinger and his thumb.
I snorted. Harry chuckled.
That day, Hogwarts buried their golden boy.
"Its OK, Drake, I promise."
When we arrived in St. Mungo's, I waddled to the front desk.
"I'm his husband, and the mother of his child," I finished.
"My offer still stands. Scorpius will leave with Mr. Potter, the court is adjourned,". I go to protest but soon Aurors are coming over and grabbing Scorpius, handing him to Harry.
"I'll grab him," I mumbled in Harry's ear, kissing his cheek for show as I rushed down the hallway to the boys' room.
Draco's mouth goes dry. "Harry—"
"Does that mean lunch is soon?" Draco asks, finishing his stitch. He pulls the next bit of fabric over, and rethreads his needle with a fresh length of silk thread.
"You're the one following me!" Harry splutters. "I came here for a peaceful getaway, and here you are, showing up everywhere I go!"
"Stupid," Draco says to his empty flat, as he notes that the flowers continue to the back. "Stupid." The Luna moth receives moonstones for eyespots. "You're a complete twat." A smooth leather neckpiece rests just below the dress's collar, studded with the same moonstones, which will also be set into the buttons on the sleeves. He crosses out his note about mother-of-pearl buttons. Moonstone is fragile, and he ought to know better, but he's feeling dramatic.
"Take my picture, Potts," Draco says, and Harry, for want of something better to do with his life, does.
Draco Malfoy can be found across the internet: @draco.
"Sex by the light of the moon?" Draco said. "Our poorly timed fuckage."
"Rub it in, why don't you. In my defence, I maintain no one actually told me it was possible to knock someone up by the light of the fucking moon."
"Something like that," Harry said again. He'd resigned, two days ago. In a month he'd be out of a job. He'd weighed up childcare against having to leave his baby day after day, and it wasn't like his bank balance couldn't stretch to accommodate supporting them both for a while. It had been healthy enough before he'd left school, but they'd shoved him up on enough stages for enough appearance and speaker fees since then that he was going to be fine for a long time.
"I think you do," Harry said, and then he slipped his arm around Draco's shoulders and took him upstairs and into the bathroom, letting the old pipes creak into life so that Harry could run him a warm bath. Then he helped Draco out of his clothes, and into the water, and tried not to make it look like he was sobbing on the inside. "When was the last time you slept?"
"We're not mates," Draco said. He kept stroking his bump, but whenever he noticed he was doing it, he stopped. "We're not friends, Harry."
"No," Hermione said. "I'm keeping him hostage until you go inside and actually talk to Draco about how you both feel. No, go away. Don't make that face at me. I'm immune. So's Jonny. Inside. Now."
It was hours, and Draco didn't let go of him, not once.
Harry did. He talked until Draco was asleep again, until his grip on Harry's hand was slack and loose.
"Come on," Ron said. "Make it up with her. You can't blame her for asking. It's not like this hasn't been, like, a bit unconventional so far."
"You can change your mind, you know," Harry said softly, half way through an episode of Midsomer Murders.
"You need to leave the house," Hermione said. "It's been days and days since you've been out."
"Can I stay?" Draco asked, after he'd devoured every last pomegranate seed in his bowl. "I can't leave him again so soon. I just can't. I'm sorry. I'll go tomorrow."
"Is this something else you've learnt? They don't have teeth?"
"Perhaps," Harry agreed. "So, do you want to go out and have pizza, then? If we do, we don't have to talk about anything else important at all."
"So you said," Hermione rolled her eyes. "I hope you didn't leave him crying in your hall."
. Agony free, Potter. I'm free of all suffering. They call you Harry Potts. All the way through. This is glorious."
"You like how rugged and untidy I am," Harry said.
"It's a boy," Draco said, after Harry answered the door to a relatively frenzied ring of the doorbell. "They told me it's a boy."
Harry didn't know why he did it, but he reached over and wrapped his hand around Draco's, squeezing, and Draco didn't pull away.
Harry, amused, grinned at Draco, who came over and kissed the top of his head.
"Is it possible that you know precisely fuck all about children?"
"Ron's mum. She'd be gutted if she didn't know."
Draco's eyes widened.
"Yeah," Harry said. "Next month, there's going to be a baby." He swallowed. "A baby boy, actually. My son."
A sob caught in the back of Draco's throat, even as Harry was cradling Jonny in his hands, and letting Draco come closer, close enough that Harry could settle Jonny in Draco's arms and let him hold his son for the very first time.
"I know," Harry said. "I know you did."
Harry glanced at Ron, and at Ron's pasty. "Might have been pies," he said shortly. "And anyway, I don't think I saw him until Maja was born, and it's no fucking business of mine how big anyone is."
"In just that? It's winter." Harry didn't know what to do, but Draco had to get warm, and he had to stop shaking. "Come on. Let's get you upstairs and into the bath."
"Just sticking to our plan," Draco murmurs in response, searching the room. The crowd goes back further than Draco could possibly see from here. It's only Harry's hand, large and hot and squeezing, that reminds Draco he's there at all. All five members of Atelier Malfoy had reinforced the Notice-Me-Not charm in the shroud together, since the day Harry tried it on. "Come on, Harry."
"Bit protective," Harry remarks as he throws open the oven door and pulls on a pair of oven mitts. He pulls a shepherd's pie from within, the whipped potato top crispy and golden. "Can't say it doesn't make me feel special," Harry goes on, and Draco's so surprised he lets it show on his face, giving his head a little shake. "Never been to the moon before, though."
"Why?" Draco asks, finally cleaving to the heart of the matter.
Harry doesn't explicitly put Draco to work as his sous chef, but when Draco hears a bit of banging about in the kitchen, he leaves his work to trot downstairs and get in Harry's way until he's given a task. Pansy's diagnosis of "far gone" doesn't even begin to cover how Draco feels when he's next to Harry in the kitchen, doing something as mundane as peeling potatoes or rinsing scallops. An elated thrill runs through him when Harry puts his hand over Draco's on the knife handle, impatiently guiding him on the proper way to slice a tomato, dice an onion, or smash a clove of garlic open.
"I must say, you don't seem particularly grief-stricken," Blaise notes, and gives an approving little nod. "Congratulations on your well-managed emotions."
broad shoulders.
She fixes him with a curious look, mirrored by the oddly expressive skulls that float in a tight semi-circle above her velvet headband, as she heads toward the kitchenette. "I see you've made coffee," she remarks, and taps the kettle with her wand.
Draco sighs, giving Potter's door one last disgusted look. "I suppose I am, yes. And they left you behind to make sure I don't waltz out of the Ministry with an armful of stolen files and goods?"
"Let me guess, your father will hear about this?" Harry snickers, pressing a wad of napkins into Malfoy's questing hand.
"I am most certainly not!
"Well, I
At last, Draco takes slow steps around Potter until he stands in front of him. This time when their eyes meet, there is no bashful looking away from either man. Potter bites his lip, and Draco's eyes drift down to begin work pinning the collar.
Here, their wedding photos, stacked in their own smaller box. Harry and Draco beneath the arch, with Harry in a combination of a Muggle tuxedo and formal robes, and Draco in heavy robes embroidered with silk ribbon and silver thread. The day had been hot and he'd taken them off as soon as the ceremony was over, he remembers. Photos of all the friends Draco had gained by becoming part of Harry's world, each as wonderful and strange as his own friends, if in a much more earnest way. A particularly odd photo of Narcissa Malfoy and Molly Weasley chatting together, looking uncomfortable; such is the effect of Draco's mother, he supposes.
"Sorry, mum," Harry snickers, but he straightens up and lets Draco finish putting the robe on him.
made." Harry laughs, cold and humorless. "Do you think I'm stupid?"
"Well, because you
A young man with twisting hands and a buzzing energy greets him at the door that leads to the Auror offices. "You must be Mr. Malfoy?" he says, as if he's unsure.
Draco doesn't follow him out. Instead he watches Pertinger, his brain a spinning mass of cogs clicking together. She'd had no interest in Draco, but had wanted to curse Potter so badly she'd summoned superhuman strength just to take her shot. He finally trots out of the room, in time to have the entering orderly shoot him a nasty look.
Harry grins, and Draco wants to hide under the table. He leans further over the organza instead, hoping the shadow will obscure his reddening face.
"I was cleared!" Malfoy suddenly whirls, and Harry is startled—and embarrassed, somehow—to see tears in Malfoy's furious eyes, his face a deep pink. "With
"That doesn't make any sense," Draco chuckles, flipping his French curve to complete his line. "You're Pansy. You'd be late to your own child's birth."
"I don't know what to tell you." Harry's green eyes are stormy with anger as he rises. "I'm trying to do what's kindest, because I've been reassured you deserve it, but maybe you don't." Harry turns to leave.
be better." Malfoy disentangles his fingers to scrub one hand through his lank hair. "I'm just—tired."
There Potter stands, in a ribbed white undershirt and loose red tartan boxers, and naught else. The undershirt is a little sheer from stretching across Potter's body, with more than a hint of the exact placement and size of Potter's nipples. The boxers have a Gryffindor crest on them, because why wouldn't they?
Again the urge to flee seizes Draco by the throat, but he roots his feet to the tiled floor. "Don't make this about us."
"Harry's probably tying up loose ends," Ron snorts. "Can't leave well enough alone, the bugger."
Draco should feel relieved. His heart should fold its nervous wings, slide back down his throat and settle back into place. He can finish his pinning and hurry back to the atelier, make his escape before Potter can think twice.
"Ugh, you reek of beer," Malfoy sniffs as they fall back against the broad side of the pub outside.
The funeral is held on the second day of his leave. It's a regular who's-who of pureblood families and all their intermarried cousins, and naturally that group includes former Death Eaters. No one close to Voldemort, of course; Azkaban took its pound of flesh, and then some, but the sheer volume of people with three or four degrees of separation from the Dark Lord himself means there are Aurors posted at the edges of the estate. There are some with a bit of a hunted look as they come through the wrought iron gates, eyeing the Aurors who only give them stern nods.
"With that," he says, pounding one fist into the flat of his other hand, "we should be led right to the source. The original curse caster."
"Now, see," she continues, "Voldemort was obsessed with being powerful, but he did it by depending on people being afraid. People don't always stay afraid, or people become afraid of something else; you can't rely on people. There are only two things you can rely on." She holds up two fingers, as if she thinks Draco needs help counting. "Yourself, and death. So now, people are dying, and I'm powerful, and I have
"Yes, alright, alright," he says, rolling his eyes. "But do leave, won't you?"
"Harry—"
"Don't you know? I'm the Boy Who Lived Again." Potter's expression is so lazy and disdainful, as his eyes take in all of Draco's unimpressive form, that Draco wants to slap it off his face. "I can do just about anything."
Harry scoffs. "So you go off to face the source of
, properly, and not as like, Malfoy brought the wine!" Harry says with a nervous, hiccuping chuckle, his words jumbling together. "It doesn't have to be that word. If you don't want it to be."
Draco considers the way Harry is looking at him, so full of so many emotions Draco can barely pick them out from each other. Anger, certainly. Sadness, which is a surprise; Draco can't really fathom anyone being sad over the prospect of his death except for his mother. Everything else Draco sees in those burning green eyes is too big for him to contemplate and he turns his face away.
"Or just, you know, introduce
"For your mother," Draco says, as neutrally as he can, and is rewarded with Harry's brief smile.
"Yes, Elda," Draco replies, clearing his throat. What had he been in the middle of?
What is he meant to do with his life now? There's no more widower support money coming from the Ministry anymore, now that Harry is alive and well and likely returning to work. The thought of working—of leaving the cottage, of being around other people, of trying to focus on
Can he be Harry now all the time, not just when Draco is alone with his embarrassing fantasies? Does Harry—does he
she'll say, and send Wilda and Rachna out to kick him in the ribs as part of their new job duties.
The orderly at St. Mungo's recognizes him. She remembers that she didn't much care for his apparent experiments with her patient's wellbeing, yes, but she also remembers him as a Ministry employee in some capacity, and she lets him see Pertinger one more time.
pond, Potter?" he asks, bobbing up in the water.
Draco sways as Harry puts an arm around his shoulders. His body aches with exhaustion, his spine burning from leaning over his work; he clutches his wand as if he's trying to crush it. Harry swipes his other hand over his head, and his scalp goes stubbly in its wake. Draco gives him an odd look.
Draco inhales sharply. "The beading is exquisite. If I had a hat, I would doff it to you for standing away from the pack and wearing something refreshing."
"Help that wasn't asked for," Malfoy sniffs. "I could have done it eventually."
This is worse than the wrong timeline. This is a nightmare.
—is so overwhelming Draco can only force himself back to sleep in the face of it.
"You've been alone," Draco says slowly, as he moves an equally slow hand toward Harry's wand, "for a long time. I've come to take you home."
His friends don't have any more platitudes to give him.
Harry looks so happy like this, stretched out with a full belly like a sunning housecat. The golden light filtered through the tall flowers makes his dark skin seem to glimmer, and his plush lips are curved into an easy, sated smile beneath gently closed eyes. A far cry from the man he met his first day reporting to the Ministry, wound so tight he could barely breathe, so far removed from his true self he was nearly unrecognizable.

"Love me now, though, don't you?"
"My father was always just
Harry lifted a shoulder, then dropped it again. "I don't think any of this could even possibly count as
"I think there's a space for that in the Hogwarts curriculum, you know," Ron said. "You could get on that, Hermione. We've only got about seventeen projects on the go, there's bound to be room for another one if we try."
Draco turned around. "What?"
Ron elbowed him. "Try telling Mum that. Just maybe, like, when you tell her, frame you fucking Malfoy when you were both wasted as something a bit more, I don't know, delicate? And in return, I won't tell anyone you didn't notice Charlie was pregnant."
"No," Harry said softly, as Draco turned around and smiled at him, eyes bright. "I'm not worried at all."
"Oh, Harry," she said. "Oh, Harry, my boy. Congratulations."
"Did she?"
"So?" Harry asks, coming back inside a minute later. Draco is face down on Harry's bed. "Is it that bad?"
Sometimes Harry remembered that not many people had loved Draco in his life, and it hurt.
"Right," Harry said. There was a spot on the wallpaper behind Draco's head that looked very interesting. "I don't know much about babies."
"We're fine where we are," Harry said.
"Is he getting worse?" Sheila asked, one Thursday when the cafe was quiet and Draco sat at the counter and smiled at the little girl colouring at one of the tables.
Harry rolled his eyes. "No," he said. "How do you feel about pizza?"
His baby, their baby, their magical moonlit baby.
"I brought you a mango," Harry said, instead of saying,
Speaking of magic, either Malfoy or Potts is an editing wunderkind. Some of the world's best analysts (Tumblr users) have taken apart Malfoy's Instagram stories and TikToks frame by frame to find the editing gaps in Malfoy's sleight of hand videos. They swear they're not there. I ask him if there are any plans to take up a second career as a magician in the future, given his sleight of hand skills.
They ate chicken and pomegranate salad sitting side by side on the quilt, Jonny laying in front of them, seemingly quite content and not at all asleep. Hermione and Ron had made their excuses a while earlier, before dinner, leaving them strict instructions not to forget to eat.
The girl was young, and bored, but at least she was trying. Harry could hardly say, 'just trying to decide if I should bring up my child or not' so he shook his head. "Just looking."
In this light, it looked a lot like Draco was paler than before. There was another pause. "Pansy's an Estate Agent," he said finally. "She was struggling. I thought if I rented somewhere it might help her out and might make us friends again. And I wanted to… not be at home anymore."
"That is not the point," Hermione says, a trifle sanctimoniously. "It would be nice to reblog all those She-Ra gifs without the added hassle of having to constantly put myself in the line of fire of your fucking fans."
"Please," Draco said.
They had forgotten for a while, until Jonny had reminded them that food had to come on a relatively strict and frequent timetable around here, face scrunched up and little tears suggesting that no one had ever actually fed him before in his life. Draco looked distressed, until Harry told him that he'd better get used to seeing this little palaver multiple times a day. Then Draco had held Jonny, looking vaguely terrified, whilst Harry had made him a bottle, and then Draco had fed him, holding his son in the curve of his elbow with his expression swapping regularly between joy and terror.
"Cheese," Hermione said carefully.
"Fine," Harry said, because it wasn't really Hermione he'd been mad at, and he might be a bit thick when it came to mating by the light of the moon, but he could tell when he was taking it out on his best friend a little unfairly. "Fine, all right. I'll make it up with her."
"I've read a book," Harry said, sniffing.
"Yes," Harry said, and took up biting his fingernails as a hobby.
Harry hadn't known they weren't friends. He didn't ask what had happened. He just took the garlic bread out of the oven, chucked a warming charm at it, and led Draco upstairs to see the nursery.
He bought a little blue sleepsuit covered in rainbows and clouds and birds, a little fluffy coat with bear ears, a set of little grey socks with elephants and lions on, and a little soft toy whale, suitable from birth. And then he went home, stood in his hallway for about three minutes, then apparated straight to Basingstoke, and Draco's front step.
"We could have it adopted."
"Mate," Harry said. It hurt, deep down in his chest.
Harry nodded. "Are you hungry? We should order."
Harry kept one hand on Draco's belly, and used his other to cup Draco's cheek. Draco's eyes were wet.
"They won't tell anyone," Harry said finally. "I trust them."
"Maybe," Draco said.
"I like how our revenge plans have got somewhat… smaller as the years have passed."
And then Harry was on his own doorstep, in an old, too-small cloak, and he thought that maybe it wasn't the time to point out that he could just as easily apparate from inside the house.
"Both of us," he says. "I'm learning."
"Something like that," Harry said. He got the bottle opener out of the drawer and handed it over. Hermione did a semi-expert job at opening the bottle and Harry leaned back against the counter.
"Harry always wears socks," Malfoy says, when I point this out to him. It is, perhaps, the only answer I'm going to get.
"I've made his lordship some too," Sheila said. Draco's cup was different to theirs, one Harry had got out of a catalogue Sheila had got for him, one with all kinds of mobility aids for people with shaking hands and poor balance and muscle weakness. "I'll take it up."
"They're Draco's," he said. "He collects them. They make him happy."
"Yes," Harry said. "I always thought it was a bit weird, him knocking somebody up, but you know, who am I to comment on other people's life choices?"
"Is it?"
noise. Harry understands. He feels it too.
"You don't look pregnant," Harry said.
He was at home when the phone call came, when Sheila rang him up and said carefully, "There are two people here, and they're asking for you, and they have wands that they're pointing at Draco."
"There's probably not a chapter specifically about cheese, which will hopefully give you your answer about whether it's okay to feed your baby it—"
For a moment, Draco meets his eyes, then spreads his legs a little more. "Good," he says. "Try this one on for size, Potts."
"You could have made me one," Ron said.
Harry glanced at him. Ron did, in fact, look furious.
It had to, at least, be better than it had been so far.
Draco wouldn't let Hermione touch either the scar from where his dark mark had been, or either of his and Harry's entwined and bonded snakes. "It's not this that's killing me," he said. There was a pause. "I was already sick before Harry even found me."
"I know," Harry said, although he knew fucking nothing about this other than what he'd read in his book. He could have asked Molly, but he hadn't known how. He didn't have anyone else. He'd always been fucking alone when it came to finding out how the world worked. It never seemed like that was going to change. He kissed Draco's temple. "I'm sorry."
"Needed to get out," Draco said. "Can't stay in the flat. Just been walking."
"Well, then. You're miserable in that flat. I've got space."
"Hopelessly," Harry said softly, but Draco was asleep again, and this time, he might not wake up.
"Who knows," Harry said, which probably wasn't very helpful, but then he was sitting back and letting Pansy Parkinson, Estate Agent, into his home when practically the last time they'd seen each other she'd been all for shopping him to Voldemort. That said, he was riding the crest of a wave of newly co-habiting, new parent bliss and couldn't really be bothered to argue with anything that might make Draco happier. And Draco deserved friends, even ones who landed him with a black and chrome flat for a year and never came around for tea or to notice that he'd gone and got himself knocked up.
"So much," Draco said. "Which is why I have to do this. I've spent nine months knowing this is the right thing to do. I can't just change my mind because I'm weak."
"Yeah," Harry said. "I've just got to tell Molly."
"Yes," Harry said. There was a baby here with them in the room, a tiny baby that might change everything. Harry could barely look after himself. How was he supposed to manage a baby? A tiny baby all of his own. He hesitated. "Don't— don't start the adoption process yet."
"Good," Draco said, and then Draco ended up staying for a chicken biryani and a very odd game of Bop It, and no one mentioned the soft curve of his belly where their baby was, or what was going to happen next.
"I've sustained my life long enough," Harry said, after a while. "And it's not like I haven't been feeding myself since I was about three."
Harry didn't quite know how to answer that. In the end, he went for, "It didn't quite work out."
"It'll get bigger, won't it?"
"Not that babies aren't important to us," Ron went on, spraying a bit of pumpkin pasty in Harry's general direction. "Love a Weasley baby, we do."
"A book about babies," he said. "And how to look after them, probably. When you can feed them cheese, that sort of thing."
Harry smiled back. His lips felt like they were stuck to his teeth.
"I will," Harry said, and he finished his cheese and onion pasty and watched the rubbish float by in the canal, and wished things were just a little bit different.
"I wouldn't know," Draco says, sprawling out across his pristine white sheets. "What's this angle like?"
"Not harsh enough," Hermione said. "You're in love with him! He's in love with you! Neither of you have even attempted to articulate this, instead you have a baby you talk around, Draco's stuff is still stuck in a flat he hates, and neither of you have any idea how to progress this relationship in any meaningful way forward. And I still can't actually believe you had no flipping idea you could get someone pregnant by the light of the full moon."
"I wanted him so much."
Draco loosened his grip a little, but didn't let go. "All right," he said finally. "All right."
Hogwarts in the summertime was quiet and haunting and still. The room in the hospital wing had a window that looked out over the lake. Draco, who slept most of the time and didn't have the energy to sit up when he was awake, could see it from his bed. Harry, who sat by his bedside, stared at it for hours at a time.
"It hasn't come up," Harry said.
He stood for a while in front of something called 'baby's first
"Aren't we?"
The message came in the middle of the night.
"I learnt when they get them, which is something I didn't know before." Harry helped Draco cradle Jonny's head. "There we go, Daddy's got you. That's right."
And then he carried Jonny over to the nursery window so that Jonny could see outside, to the garden where he'd play when he got older, and he held him close and tried not to think about his other daddy, and what he was going through.
Draco flushed. "Your baby."
"I liked that duck," Harry says. "I'd named it. You made a TikTok about its demise."
, replied, "The monster needs feeding?" before hiding in a cupboard.
"He's going through an awful lot," Hermione said. "You've got to remember, he wasn't planning to be a parent either."
"Come on," Harry said. "Who doesn't love free food?"
"Minerva's promised to put PSHE on the curriculum for next academic year," Hermione said instead of
Hermione's hand was in the small of Draco's back. "Go on," she said. "It's all right. You won't hurt him. Promise."
John, Harry thought. Jonathan. Johnny. Jonny. "Jonny," he said. "Jonny Malfoy Potter."
"It's all right," Harry said, kissing his temple again. "Everything's going to be all right."
"There we are, what," Hermione said. "Are you honestly telling me that that was the last conversation you had about your impending fatherhood? Three weeks ago?"
"What about your head?"
, Harry thought, and for a moment, his chest hurt.
And yet, they are very clearly the same person. The sleight of hand videos, the model shots, the bickering over socks vs. not socks with Harry Potts, the self-titled product lines. In this world where influencing careers exist and we can't stop them, all I can say is that Draco Malfoy is definitely one of the more interesting social media personalities out there.
"Why not?"
"Hello," Draco said. "Your cloak doesn't fit."
"You wouldn't," Harry said, licking the remains of his cheese and onion pasty off his fingers. "Give me my baby."
"Of course he does," Harry Potts says. He turns to me, and immediately contradicts himself. "Draco's parents didn't approve of popular music."
"And he just started crying?" Ron asked, a little incredulously. "Ferret Face Malfoy?"
Harry did not drop his gaze. "Last time I saw him, he was fine."
"Hey, it's okay," Harry said, rubbing Draco's arms because he was so fucking cold. "It's okay, love, it's okay. Let's get you warm."
Harry kept thinking about Draco's room.
"Deserved that, didn't I?" he said, cradling him. Jonny blinked at him with wide eyes. Babies this little weren't supposed to be able to focus, but Jonny kept staring at him very intensely, which reminded Harry a little of how Draco used to stare at him across the Great Hall every mealtime, so quite frankly he was very clearly theirs. He leaned in close and stuck his tongue out, and after a moment, Jonny's tongue peeked out too. "Such a clever boy."
"What are you on about?" Harry asked, trying to stifle a yawn. He failed, and yawned wide. "Are you sure you're not drunk?"
Harry was getting bits of flaky pastry all over his coat and his lap and his fingers. So was Ron, but pumpkin pasties tended to hold together a bit better than the cheese and onion ones, so his mess was less pronounced. "Do you think I could be a dad?"
Hermione brought wine.
"Stop reading the Famous Five," Harry calls after him. "We've had enough adventures for one lifetime."
"Probably," Harry agreed. He had Jonny perched on his lap, the two of them sitting on the stairs, waiting for the doorbell to ring.
"Hermione's persuaded Professor McGonagall to put PSHE on the curriculum at Hogwarts," Harry said, for want of something better to say.
"New babies always take it out of you," she told him, sitting him down. "You sit here and I'll bring you a cup of tea. They'll be fawning over that little boy for a few minutes, you can have a break."
"He's through here, Mr Potter," the healer said, and Harry launched himself out of the chair and through the doorway into the room where Draco was.
"Good," Draco said. "Show him to me."
, he'd told him, the words lost in the quiet of their room, in the silence of their lives.
"I didn't," Harry said. "Don't know where I was supposed to find out, but anyway."
"What did you pick?"
, and that Draco wasn't having anything at all.
Draco, without taking his eyes off her, undoes another button. Harry floats the idea of having some kind of conniption.
"But there's a baby."
Harry sat down and shifted so that Draco could see him, could meet their son, their little boy. Draco didn't reach for him once, and tried to hide his tears.
"Yeah," Harry said. "He's good. Pick him up. Then we cycle through the things that could be wrong."
"You had a werewolf for a teacher. Moons are important."
Draco looked at him then, and Harry knew he'd lost.
"Sorry," Harry said, as Draco put the mugs down on the coffee table and sat down in the armchair. Harry glanced at his stomach. Their baby was still only small, but maybe Draco might be showing.
Glancing back to ask him how much garlic bread he wanted, Harry caught him scrubbing at his eyes with a crisp, white handkerchief, and stayed quiet.
"You wouldn't hurt him."
"Your baby with Draco Malfoy," Ron added. Harry punched him in the arm for good measure. "That you got because you had drunk sex on your sofa. Mate."
"That's the aim," Draco said. "I believe that's what happens."
Draco, however, looked pale when he answered the door.
"I need to move more of my things into your room, Harry," Draco says. "They're cluttering up the background to my photos."
Harry nodded. He came to sit down on the sofa by Draco's feet. "How about you?"
"So. A boy?"
"There's a nursery?" Draco said softly.
"No," Harry said. "What are you wearing?"
"How is he?" she asked.
"It's okay," Harry said, without looking back. "I've got you."
"I've never been drunk enough that sex with Draco Malfoy was on the table," Ron said, ambling after them. "You didn't do it on the table, right?"
"Coffee and walnut cake," he said, passing it to Harry. "Made it myself."
"You can tell how mad she is because of how much she's swearing," Ron said helpfully. "You can tell how furious I am, because I'm not."
Harry perched on the arm of Draco's sofa. Draco looked pained, so Harry sort of slid sideways until he was sitting on the sofa instead. "Have you any idea what we're going to do?"
"She's forceful, but in a good way."
"Potter," Draco said. "You could at least have changed your clothes this week."
"I've always thought of you as beige."
"I know," she said. "And I'm sorry for that, but you have to look after this one. Which means showering. And leaving the house. And letting him meet his family."
Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm trying a new aesthetic."
Ron stopped by for lunch, bringing Harry a cheese and onion pasty, and a pumpkin pasty for himself. "Come on," he said. "Rain's stopped. You can find half an hour for a bit of lunch."
Harry looked at her. "He's not okay."
"Oh," Draco said. "So-so."
"Hello," Harry said, because it may possibly have escaped his notice that he was supposed to have cooked for Ron and Hermione tonight. He poked around in his head for ideas. "I thought we could get a takeaway?"
"Really," he said. He took the mango and held it in his hand. "Our baby," he said softly, before he put the mango down on the coffee table and looked back up at Harry. "We should go now."
"Harry?" I ask.
"I read that it's the size of an orange. And that it has fingers and thumbs and it might be sucking its thumb right now."
"Ah," Harry said.
"You are a baking genius," Hermione told him, patting him on the arm.
"It's sorted," Harry said, because it was. It was all sorted. Their baby was coming home with him, to his green nursery and his drawers of baby clothes, and there was no need to work out a schedule with Draco, because Draco wasn't going to be a part of it. Every time he thought about it, it started to feel like a heavier and heavier weight in his chest. Draco never talked about the nursery, and he never talked about after their baby was born, and he never talked about anything other than what the healer had said in their latest appointment, and nonsense about the history of whatever food they were eating to fill the space.
"Oh, saw it in the Prophet," Draco says airily, and quickly because he doesn't actually remember. Just another Harry fact he's absorbed and obsessively held onto over the years. "And—wait, I remember you being in those stupid Apparition classes we had to take. You never got your license?"
Even when their conversation pauses, there's never silence, filled with the cacophony of birdcall, insect buzz, and whistling wind.
"Then you must not want to solve this case."
"I can't—"
Draco says, a pleading note entering his voice. "Pansy, please. I'm—I'm here as his tailor—"
Nothing.
For a moment, Draco wonders if he ought to be offended. But he's reminded of Pansy, suddenly, and Blaise, and the way they express their affection for him in volleys of insults and other little bits of loving disrespect. "Harry," he says, trying to keep the wryness he feels off his face and out of his voice, "am I your friend?"
Harry flinches.
But Draco is back to watching Harry, losing himself in consideration of how far his husband has come.
"And your friends, they're here too," Draco adds, quickly as he turns back to the room. Ever since this whole business with Harry started, he's blushed more than he has in his entire life, he's quite sure. "I saw them."
"I don't care. And you oughtn't, either. I wouldn't take on a job I couldn't complete, not with the atelier's reputation on the line as ever." Draco gestures to the doors. "May we fulfill the sitting room's purpose and sit? Or should we have one more silly conversation in your favorite part of the house?"
"My therapist says I have to confront my cowardice," Draco says primly, despite Dr. Fiddlewood having never said that. "I think I hear Mother calling." And he leaves Pansy's side, not even having to feign joining his mother as another ancient witch stops him to pay her respects to the grieving Malfoy heir, or whoever he's supposed to be.
"Is that a hobby, or a much-needed change?" Draco asks, thinking of the oppressively narrow entrance hall he remembers.
"A Vow might backfire when I show up at the Anniversary Gala." A wry chuckle. "Will you put it in writing or not?"
Just about a minute later, the Aurors settle determinedly into their work, returning to the flow of their strange little beehive as if nothing had ever interrupted it. Apparently Sundays do nothing to thin the herd, the offices full and buzzing. Harry admits that as much as he seems to have easily played off their three day absence, he does now have a three day backlog to get through as Head Auror. "Meet me at mine tomorrow? Say, eleven in the morning?" Harry asks, hand on the knob of his office door.
He stops just as he closes the door behind him, eyes darting around the room before settling on Harry Potter. "Please," Potter says, gesturing with one hand before clasping it with the other again. "Sit."
Draco scowls in return. "Well, I am! It's my job! It's quite literally what your blessed Ministry is paying me for!"
Harry had been drunk, so it doesn't count. That's another thing he tells himself. Anyone would feel like kissing in the scenario they'd found themselves in. Soused, alone in the dark, each revealing their attractions to men—a recipe for poor decisions like making out with a childhood rival.
"So you just, what, never get fresh air? If you can't even sit in your back garden lest a gnome bite off all your toes." Draco shifts the organza, finding the next spot to stitch down a pearl. "Are you
Draco should be happy to let Potter leave his ancestral lands, as it were. He should want nothing more than the solitude he had just been seeking, to have no more company than the sky and the plants and the tiny animals housed in both. But finding Potter wandering the canola fields feels like the discovery of a strange new magical creature, rare and fleeting. He reaches for Potter's wrist.
And when Potter gave him that canola flower—well. He'd gone back even further, hadn't he? To a time split between his loyalty to his family and how much he wanted to be held and kissed by his most hated rival. What a stupid boy he'd been.
There isn't anyone in the fields when Draco bursts through their edge, swimming through the canola stalks as if he has someone to look for. Of course there isn't anyone.
"I understand, you want someone on your arm who can form a full sentence because they haven't fallen off their brooms so many times they're more often concussed than they aren't. I hear Justin Finch-Fletchley is just as insufferable as ever, and you won't have to speak to anyone because he'll do all the talking for you." Draco misjudges the angle of his pin, accidentally sticking Potter just a smidge.
So he chooses to enjoy himself. He chooses to even enjoy Harry's wet salad, because Harry made it for him, and that is enough. Draco gives himself over to stupid chatter, which turns to school nostalgia anyway once Harry asks if he meant it about Longbottom and Blaise. Draco lets the cheap wine make him feel pliant and buzzy, because he thinks about Harry going out of his way to choose a wine that Draco might like and he melts with how horribly in love he is. Oh, he's so far gone.
He could never ask Potter to trust him, not in so many words. He knows he has carved himself into an untrustworthy person with his earliest choices, no matter how much he's chipped away as an adult.
By the time Draco goes to bed, it's usually about two in the morning. Which leaves him about two hours to sleep; three if he's feeling indulgent, but he rarely ever is.
"So you expected to speak to my parents?" Weasley asks. When Granger approaches the table, he jumps back up, and pulls a chair out for his wife, who gives him a smile accompanied by a wrinkled nose. "And you thought they'd just tell you where we lived, so you could come bother us in our proper home rather than send an owl like anyone else?"
. "Tell me, Draco, should I make this personal for you? Or would a run of the mill grisly death work for you?"
Draco shifts his weight from leg to leg. Williamson definitely observes too much; any closer to Christmas and Draco would buy him a blindfold as a helpful gift. "Is it really so bad, having a superior who sticks to the rules?"
"Do you?" Draco comes to stand in front of Harry, and Harry bows his head. He slides the headpiece into Harry's thick curls, tucking the ends of the headband behind his ears. It's hard not to run his fingers through those curls.
If he's going to confront Harry about something work related, he ought to go to the Ministry, he muses on his Knight Bus trip back to Swindon. Perhaps enough eyes on him will keep him as Head Auror Potter, cold but amenable to whatever will make the job easier. He'll go tomorrow, first thing in the morning, and with any luck Harry won't have had him banned from the building. He'll march into the Auror offices, kick down Harry's door, and tell him with no room for questions or arguments that he
"Draco."
"You're a bit shrieky now," Harry snickers.
What Draco receives is another plea to come over, and this time Harry doesn't even try to bribe him with food.
Draco shifts, folding his arms and resting them on the table as he glances down the lonely length of the table. "I thought you didn't want to be seen. I thought you wanted to..." He rolls his bottom lip between his teeth, considering his wording for once, but he shakes his head.
Of course, true to any gathering of 40-somethings who have known each other long enough, it takes Harry, Draco and Lily nearly another half hour to leave. Molly wants to ply them with leftovers. Harry gets into a Quidditch talk with Arthur, despite having talked plenty of Quidditch earlier. Draco has to pee, then he has to pee again after the Quidditch talk finally ends, which means Harry and Arthur strike it up one more time and Draco has to physically pull them apart. Neville asks Draco about how Maisie and the rest of the orchard are doing while he waits for Harry to get out of the loo in turn, and then it's Harry who's breaking up the conversation and insisting they're leaving,
"I'm just—I'm not interested," Harry says, keeping his arm tight to his side. "Please don't ask me again."
"Well, that last one might be true." Draco leads Harry to the sofa, lit almost entirely by the fireplace. "But my hard work will not go to waste so long as you, the client, enjoys it."
"In its way," the other man mutters. "Come on, Malfoy." Before Draco can say otherwise, Potter's put a heavy hand on his shoulder, and Side-Alongs him.
"Well, mate," Ron says, tapping the handle of the basket. "It's intense, I won't lie to you. It's like reliving all those memories, not just seeing them happen but
"Don't tease me!" Malfoy snaps, turning suddenly to finally face Harry, and this close, Harry can see his face again—he's angry. Why is he
"My image?!"
"Reckon we'll find out as he goes along, as per usual," Williamson huffs. "Strange, isn't it?"
doesn't want to explain himself. Not when he's trying to not think about Harry. Pansy gives Greg's shoulder a light smack and says she'll tell him in the kitchen, both a blessing and a curse. Pansy is bound to make it salacious, but at least Draco won't have to say it, nor hear it.
"That's insulting to the Minister, don't you think?"
"No, you're not a baby, and I'm not treating you like one. You're a grown man who needs help." Draco smooths his free hand across the nearer front of Harry's robes, fixing imaginary creases. "Let me. It's why I'm here, aren't I?"
"It's not that I don't believe you, you know." Harry's voice grows softer still, and closer. "I understand we were married. I understand it was you who found me after everyone gave me up for dead, and I'm grateful." Draco sees two denim-clad knees as Harry kneels in front of him, but still he won't look up. "But even with everything I saw with Ron and Hermione's help—I just don't feel that way about you." A pause. "I don't hate you, Draco. I want to be friends."
"It will be by the time this
"Is that Harry?" a dreamy voice asks, wafting toward them. "How wonderful!"
As for the unofficial ensemble, it's complete enough to bring to Harry. To Potter, to Potter, to
No response, still. But the door has opened, which has to mean
"Hello," Draco replies, as neutrally as he can manage. "Has something gone awry with your robes?"
Hermione sets her mouth in a line, looking at Draco grimly. "Ron's right, I suppose. I wouldn't advise you to think too much about it at this stage, Draco."
was one far too strong for what he saw in the other man's eyes. Maybe
Draco thinks back to his conversation with Harry.
Draco should just let Potter's words lie, let it be the poison-letting it's clearly meant to be. But he wouldn't be himself if he weren't, as he's said so many times to himself and others, a nosy git.
Harry's eyes light on Draco, and there's none of the malice Draco when he first found Harry. "There you are," Harry says. His mouth does not smile. He doesn't frown, either, though.
"He made a joke about how I missed Hugo’s birth," Harry says, closing his eyes. "Said I must be planning another breakdown in time to miss the next baby." He shakes his head. "What a stupid thing to be so angry about."
"I want anything that isn't the bloody war," Harry spits. "Cho Chang, in fourth year. Ginny Weasley, sixth year. Er, Luna Lovegood, for a bit of fifth year," he adds.
"You can't call me that title anymore, it doesn't apply," Harry mumbles with a little smile.
"Sometimes, Harry, I dream of things you've never even served me, because I know it will be exceptional." Another pearl. Another pull of the organza.
"Fine," Draco sneers, "I'll leave." He yanks his arm away from the Larch's grasping fingers and hurries out toward the Auror office door, snatching up the contents of his desktop as he goes.
After that, Draco only pauses to accept a strong cup of coffee from Harry. He really had been close to finishing the spell before their fight had knocked everything off course. At this point, Harry is only in the room for Draco to talk at, not to, making sure his spellcraft is sound. Fifteen years of just theory leave a bit of rust on the practical.
they just saw.
At the very back of the room, framed by the massive cathedral window, is the table where Hogwarts professors would preside over every meal, including the podium where Dumbledore once spoke his strange words before every term. Not many people are back here, as if the dais the table sits upon wards them off. There are little placards on each empty plate, and when Draco brings Harry close enough, he reads the names. One for the Minister of Magic, dead center. A few more for other high-ranking Ministry officials, including the head of the DMLE, to the right. And to the left, the Golden Trio. The official heroes of the war.
miss you."
"Yeah, I do know that." Harry's eyes glitter. "Shall we?"
I will mark the scene with asterisks but, please be aware of the fact that this self-harm is somewhat violent
"Why, Hare, why did you leave us?" His voice was barely a whisper. His knees gave out and right as he was about to his the ground, Remus caught him, leading him to his seat.
He smiled at me and I rolled my eyes. He came right beside me and brushed his teeth as he moved to lean against the counter, watching me.
Hailee brings her hands to Malfoy's waist, holding her tightly, suddenly filled with the urge to mark Malfoy.
Walking into The Burrow was something that never stopped being amazing to Draco. Even though he grew up pureblood, the way the Weasley's used their magic always amazed him.
I pulled away, somewhat breathless, and toyed with his hair at the nape of his neck.
"I'm upset you didn't tell me," He started. I nodded.
Ginny tries to hex Draco with James in the room. His claws come out
It took me approximately two seconds to figure out what happened.
"Promise!" He said, before rushing out of the kitchen. I looked just in time to see him turn right instead of going straight, the long way to his room. If he went the normal way, he'd end up going straight through the living room and, while I trusted Harry to keep him safe, I didn't trust that Ginerva wouldn't try anything when met with the opportunity.
"I see," Judge Marigolds said. She looks at me. I'm sitting in a chair in the middle of the room.
"I could say the same for you and your man," Ginny said, quirking an eyebrow at him. I wasn't expecting everyone to look at me. I opened my mouth but nothing came out. Soon, I heard applause and turned to see Harry. He was right in front of me.
"Whats wrong?!" I cried, forgetting my pain, replacing it with panic. No one answered, simply swarmed around our baby.
"Gee, Pa, why not playin another,"
"I-I can produce a Patronus," many gasps filled the room. Remus looked, gobsmacked, before nodding.
"We're making a mistake," Harry said jokingly. Draco shook his head, walking over to clean Laura off.
"Well?" Harry's voice had Draco sucking his lower lip into his mouth, chewing on it until Harry's hand reached up to free it with his thumb. His hand moved down to grab Draco's.
He pushes me onto my back and spreads my legs wide and then he gives my hole a firm lick and I'm arching my back with a scream.
"Harry, you aren't making sense-"
"She's perfect," I heard choked behind me. I looked at Harry to see him crying, his hand coming down to carefully stroke the side of our baby's face. I was in awe of the little creature I held in my arms.
"M-mr. Malfoy," Draco put up a hand as if to silence the man.
And then we heard it. The quiet little cry. I let out a gasp of air as Healer Marchell turned around and smiled at me, holding our daughter in her arms.
Scorpius had his fiance- nope, I reminded myself, we were at their wedding, his wife standing next to him. Hayley intertwined their fingers and rested her head on his shoulder. She looked stunning with her brown hair in a delicate updo, flowers scattered throughout. Her blue eyes were filled to the brim with love and adoration as she stared at him.
"Therefore," the healer continues, "Mr. Malfoy is non-guilty," He concludes.
I didn't say anything, just running.
"Why so fussy, my love?" I asked, lifting a crying James out of his crib. Rocking him back and forth in my arms, I shushed him lightly.
as I burned the stick into ashes.
I turned to the floo and instructed the flames to call my once-removed aunt.
Teddy plopped right on Harry's lap and I sat beside him, James on my lap. Molly practically fell onto her red armchair, setting the sippy cup on the coffee table to her left, letting out a loud sigh.
"Yes, but you said it should be over a year before you went back onto the field, not eight bloody months!" I snapped back. He sighed and stepped into the fire. I grabbed a picture of us off the kitchen table. It was a muggle picture that Hermione had snapped at Pansy's birthday party a few months back. I had smiled about something Harry said and my mouth was in a smile as his lips pressed to mine. I wondered what happened to us being so happy.
but today was simply different. Sunday Roast was a once-a-month get together for family and friends when everyone would pile into the magically held together house and laugh, talk, and get drunk off our arses.
"You're still here?" Ginerva drawled, seemingly annoyed. My eyes flicked to her and, for a short moment, I wished the dumb girl knew I wasn't a morning person.
"Thank you," I breathed. I turned to Harry. He smiled at me and I simply looked at him. After my freak out the week before, I was arrested and put into waiting cells in Azkaban. Scorpius had gone with Harry.
As the train left the station, Teddy looked at the two chocolate frog cards in his lap.
"Can I?" He asked me. I answered by grabbing him by his neck and pulling him down to me, pushing our lips together.
An hour later, Harry and I stood outside of The Burrow. As we got to the door, it swung open and we were met with Teddy.
Eyes fluttering open, the first thing I was met with was the face of my husband. I blinked a few times and everything came into focus. Something soft and wet brushed against my lip and I jumped before Harry's hand came up to cup my face, moving some of my hair out of my face.
Anyway, I love you guys so so so much.
"You're seriously having another
"I'm going to wake up Teddy then he, James, and I are going out for a bit, perhaps to pick up some things for dinner," I said to him. He nodded, kissing my forehead. Making my way down the hallway, I woke Teddy up and, no more than fifteen minutes later, the kids and I were out of the house.
"I know but we can work this out! I love you so much, oh my god!" Harry seems elated as he lets out a hearty laugh, throwing his head back.
"Please show us," Draco nodded, slowly walking to the middle of the room. He thought of his happiest memory.
"What are you muttering about?" Harry's voice asks, just behind Draco, and Draco just about spits his heart out.
There's no way around it now. He retracts the tape into its case, stepping in close to Potter with his head bowed. "Arms up," Draco says, almost a whisper, and Potter lifts them just enough to grant Draco access.
Instead, he coughs again, and tries to clear his throat. He's still too weak to stand.
"What do you want from her?"
Potter kneels on the rug of a sparsely-decorated room, facing away from the door with both hands on the back of his shorn head. He rocks gently in place, which does little to alleviate the way his staccato breaths sound like he's drawing them in through thick fabric.
"What an ugly word to call me," Draco murmurs, watching Blaise sweep across the grounds with his hands clasped behind his back. Potter walks like that, only Blaise's hands are loose with ease, and Potter's whole body may as well be a fist. "Have I not returned your every infrequent owl, Pansy?"
on it wrong. There's strength reinforcements in every seam, and it's spill-resistant, tear-resistant, and even wrinkle resistant. You'd better believe there's charms protecting the pearls, individually, as well."
"She does not hate you. She's tired, overstimulated, and twelve. She's going to her room like any other twelve year old." He hooks his chin over Harry's shoulder and clasps his hands loosely over Harry's waist.
. He's on his feet immediately, clutching the most important documents and scribbled notes as he stalks up to Potter's door and reaches for the door knob.
"Please tell me what happened." Granger pulls his attention back, and she's leaning forward again, without the previous intensity this time.
"He's not dead," Draco says, even as he picks out the wood for the coffin that will be inhabited by the memory of Harry.
"And a fare thee well to you, too," Malfoy says dryly, before turning around too quickly, stumbling a few paces, and then weaving his way to a house off to the left.
He taps his wand back to his satchel, and opens the satchel as a proper bag, though it's been Expanded, of course. "Anyway—" Draco's voice cracks. Maybe he's not meant to speak today. "Anyway! I'm pompous enough to have assumed you would like the new sketch, and I was right, so I'm vindicated in my choice to create a mockup for fitting." He pulls a linen robe from his satchel first, followed by trousers, both the undyed color of oats. And then he pulls silk faille out, and more faille, and more, and more, Potter's eyes widening with each armful of fabric Draco extracts from the satchel.
"I wanted to be."
with a grin. Except—
What a stupid delivery. He sounds like a pathetic teenager. Any moment Harry's going to get up and leave, too good to laugh but too uncomfortable to stay. He should say something else, something more mature to take the pressure off so Harry knows he can tell him to fuck off. "You can ignore me, if you want, it was stup—"
"Oh, who do you bet on, then? Those blasted Chudley Cannons your blessed Weasley loves so much, I'll wager."
The body count is so much higher than Draco had known. The only survivors so far are the victims most recently cursed, and by the look of things, their days are certainly numbered.
"How embarrassing to be so worried," Blaise drawls, over tea a week later. Draco agrees, all the more for being called out on it so many times.
"Friendly rivals, perhaps."
After that, there's no one topic that holds them for long, meandering from one to the next. Together, Harry and Draco make short work of the whole spread, and Draco does conjure a bottle of Pinot Grigio directly from the manor's wine cellar, because a little cup of tea doesn't quite quench the thirst brought on by a stellar Iberico.
"Never off the robe, but yes," Draco says, leaning back in his seat to steeple his fingers over his lap. "So you like it?"
"Crept up on you, did it?"
Harry retakes his seat slowly. "I was never teasing you," he whispers. "I told you, both times you said that to me. I didn't—I didn't understand what you were asking of me. But I didn't think you
"You did that on purpose," Malfoy seethes.
"Aurors don't take home their work, do they?"
"Stop calling me Harry! You don't have the right!" Harry shouts, and Draco winces as the wand jabs him in the esophagus. "What's your game, Malfoy? Eh? Did you do this to me?"
His head bumps each step as he's dragged down stairs. Downstairs. Into the basement with the blood stained floor. His attacker doesn't seem to be in any kind of hurry, so at least each thump of the back of his head is slow, less painful than it could be—the only positive he can find in this moment.
"It's a manor, not a palace, you plebeian." Malfoy wobbles dramatically, and he yelps as he grabs ahold of the strong arm Harry holds out. Once he's stable he glowers at Harry, ripping his hand away as though the help has offended him. "Why, am I not allowed to want to get away from England for a bit?"
"Why don't we continue this in the kitchen?" Granger says, gesturing down the hall. Draco waits until they've both begun walking before following them, his nerves whistling as he looks around. Everything is sort of packed together and shabby, yet each oddment looks as though it was always meant to be where it is, crowding the Burrow with a warm sense of being thoroughly lived in. It is nothing like the manor.
"Keep going. I've got plenty of lukewarm stew to get through."
"So I've got to work at it," Harry finishes. "This is the start."
yet. (It doesn't escape him that this is, just about, the glass of wine and h'ordeuvres he'd almost invited Harry to before.) He has a feeling Harry is more a beer drinker than wine, though, and he regrets not inviting Greg, just a tiny bit; Greg might know about beer.
"If that's not a lie, then why didn't you direct him here?" Draco says with a disbelieving arch of his brow.
It had been rough, transitioning from their holiday romance, built in a month of being ensconced in the Irish wilderness, to their real lives filled with terrible history, expectations, responsibilities, and very, very shocked friends. Especially Harry's. A theory that Draco had drugged Harry with some sort of lucid love potion went around, and Harry was dragged to St. Mungo's for thorough testing, but he came back with clean results save for his mild dependence on sleeping draughts.
"I see." Malfoy's sudden reticence is so laden with—oh, Harry's too drunk to properly identify the emotion, but it's not fun, and he's too drunk for that, too. He looks at Malfoy again.
"You know what?" Harry lets go of his shirt hem and smooths his hands down it, then does the same to his head, his hair vanishing in favor of stubble. "Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's go."
"Is that what you'd like?" Draco can hear the rakish smile in Harry's voice. He doesn't know where this Harry came from, but for the sake of his bruising heart, he wishes he'd go away.
"Auror Larch," Draco calls without looking up, and Larch is at his elbow within seconds, startling him. "Are you some kind of assistant?" he asks, instead of the request he was about to make.
"That blighter," Harry fumes, because of
"I haven't been connected to the Floo Network in years," Harry grumbles. "What if someone notices? Someone nosy?"
The dishes set themselves down with a thud and a clink, and instead of sitting down as well, Harry stands over Draco, gripping the back of his chair as he looks down. Draco meets his eyes, lost.
His eyelids slide shut as tears crowd his lashes, threatening to spill down his cheeks. "I would never—I had nowhere left to—" The tears make good on their threat, and Harry hiccups as they roll down his face.
"Oh, come here, you sensitive loon," Harry says with another low chuckle. "I haven't made all this food just to have it sit because you got a bit stroppy."
Pansy had had to concede that the sketch was, indeed, glorious. She practically salivated at the chance to make the halo of antlers, though she couldn't help but teasingly congratulate him on not simply outfitting Potter with a literal pair of antlers.
"I don't know, I just assumed my climbing technique was off," Malfoy says with a shrug, before catching himself, perhaps angry at himself for being so casual with Harry.
"I am sorry," Malfoy says, though it's not soft, not contrite. It's also not whiny, as it might have been when they were younger. He hesitates, mouth open to say more, and then his lips seal shut and he heads off into the tree line after all.
"Beautiful night for a mope," Pansy's voice rings out.
Draco's fingers feel strangely nerveless. "What a fuckwit I've been."
Of course, once the album is complete, he realizes he doesn't know when he'll have a chance to give it to Harry. Draco leaves it in the center of the kitchen table, supposes Ron and Hermione will give him another visit when Hermione's part of the Legilimency healing is complete.
He thinks of his proud father pushing away the scraps Azkaban must have given him, wasting away to a sliver of his arrogant self, and he is numb. There is no fresh loss when he has grieved his father since his sentencing to a lifetime in Azkaban; Lucius had given him a stiff nod before being led away and Draco had forced himself to stay stone faced.
"That's what they never bring up in the biographies," Harry says with a smirk, letting Malfoy find his footing at last. "I'm a real sadist."
Draco sighs. "It's a ferret."
Harry goes on with his story, Draco sipping his butterbeer at the edge of the conversation. He heard this story yesterday, but he laughs along with his friends at just the right points, in case Harry's forgotten he told Draco already. Even when what Harry forgets is easily categorized as natural, human, even middle-aged forgetfulness, reminders of it just breed anxiety and irritability that can spiral quickly. Ron started a story with the words
"Suppose I'll find out in the morning if either of us succeeded," Harry replies. "Er, goodnight, Malfoy."
When he sees Malfoy at the pub central to the houses one night, he reminds himself yet again that he's here to enjoy himself and the natural beauty of Ireland,
The young man sitting in Interrogation 1 is none other than Thaddeus Dendron, the very first known eyewitness to Venari Virtute's effects. But he doesn't look shifty, or angry, or frightened; he looks expectant.
"Good morning, Draco," Pansy calls out across the atelier as she enters, and Draco swears his lungs twist into little babka knots. There's something off about her voice.
Fifteen years, and still he receives sidelong looks, frowning glances, surreptitious lips muttering
Potter only shrugs, maddeningly. He points at a door. "There."
Potter looks—bemused? "Shouting at you seems a bit redundant, I think?" he says, with a nervous chuckle, scratching at his scalp. "Seems you just did all the shouting yourself."
It's the incantation.
her powerful, methodical magic deconstructing his wards.
Draco picks at one of the daisies on the chair arm under his human arm. "My father died."
" he says, quiet under the barrage of cruelty coming from Harry. A silver rabbit leaps from the end of his wand under his cloak, and sits expectantly in front of him. "Go to Ron, or Hermione, whichever you can find first," he tells the rabbit. And then, touching the rabbit's throat, he says, "I've found Harry. My Patronus has the coordinates. Please Apparate as quickly as you can."
"I cannot, not ever," Hermione says with a fond smile in return. "It was in our pre-nup that I'm sure you never read."
"I didn't choose anything, you showed up after dragging me hither and thitter. Thithser. Hither and
"Well, yes." Something is making the floor vibrate irritatingly under Draco's feet, and when he looks for the source, he realizes Harry is jiggling his leg under the table. "I just thought—" Harry takes a horrible loud suck of his oversteeped tea. "It might be nice to introduce my—my boyfriend."
The truth of the matter is that even if Draco did want to "go to" Potter—and he does, desperately, despite having no idea how he might—there's no point of entry for him. It's not just that Potter has real friends. It's that Potter at the Ministry is entirely the same as he has been, which is to say a far cry from the curly headed man smiling under the moonlight. His hair is shorn, his words are clipped, and his face barely moves, with an expression so cold Draco might shiver under that gaze.
"I'm shocked, Potter! Not Parvati Patil? Well, Romilda Vane might still carry a torch for you, though goodness knows she's single for a reason."
Potter doesn't say anything as Draco hauls himself up with a groan. His mother had warned him so many times in the past that Malfoy joints were no good; even with the Cushioning Charm, his knees hadn't much liked being that close to the floor. He ignores Potter to check over his measurements. They're rudimentary, but enough to apply to the Resizing Dress Form, so he doesn't think there's any need to torture Potter further.
Griselda shrugs. "That's part of why he failed. But sometimes, Draco, people just die. There's no rhyme or reason." Her eyes harden, her mouth a grim line. "It doesn't matter who they were before. Maybe they're a parent. Perhaps they're a hard worker, loyal, powerful. Everyone's the same when they die."
"I need to observe her," Draco says, finally taking a seat now that he senses he might be getting somewhere. "I already understand I can't question her."
"Do you ever think of leaving the manor?"
That explains a lot about Potter's fashion sense during their school years, whenever robes were not required. Although Draco remembers, with the accuracy of long term obsession, that Potter looked like he got dressed in the dark long after first year.
"Thursday? As in this Thursday?"
Harry Potter on my doorstep, not some skinny sop pulling his nose out of a book long enough to get himself killed." Griselda reverses directions, starting her slow meander around the basement again.
she'd sneered, fiddling with a short steak knife and kicking her dangling feet, her legs still too short to reach the floor at ten years old.
never mind that Harry's invited him over the very next day and seems to be cooking him dinner.
have, and all that matters now is whether you agree with my theory."
Blood.
"Ow, Malfoy! No, I don't want to go with
Draco is sincerely flabbergasted, and his wand nearly rolls off his lap as it falls from his fingers. "Blaise, I—" And he understands. "I'm so sorry."
"Wave to them, Harry," Draco whispers as the crowd's murmuring of his name gets louder. "It's alright."
right. Draco is kissed out, lips swollen and buzzing, body thrumming with arousal, and it's the afternoon.
Luna's arrival to the conversation is the tipping point for the guests surrounding their little group.
"It's not even—" Draco checks his pocket watch. "It's only barely after noon. And it won't take longer than a few minutes."
"I suppose if you want to go home I'd better pack up," Draco says, already beginning the process of tidying his bevy of parchments into a neat pile that might, with some effort, fit into his satchel.
"If the Gala were canceled I'd lay down and die right here, Potter, and you'd simply have to cope," Draco replies as he hangs his jacket up and closes the closet. "Especially as I've redesigned your look, head to toe." He picks up his satchel, heading Potter's way with every intention of entering the room behind him.
It's as close as Blaise will ever get, and Draco loves him that way. "What about Greg?"
"I only ran into Potter a few times, back in the day." Williamson's hand on his beard stills. "But he seemed like such a fiery lad to me. Not a boy who'd grow into that, certainly." He nods at the glass again.
"I'm such a prat," Draco snorts, chuckling at himself half-heartedly. "I'm sorry, Harry, all that back and forth and I thought you were coming on Friday, so I had Blaise and Pansy—"
And just as suddenly, it's gone.
"I didn't say the story was foul for being Muggle. It is foul, and it was made by Muggles. Two separate facts that describe the story."
"You know, I didn't think about it until now," Draco says, standing by the door that goes straight upstairs. "Convenient, though, isn't it?"
"I think you're making that up," Draco says. "That's abhorrently stupid."
Panic fills him, his breath coming fast through his soundless mouth as a pair of strong hands take him by the ankles. There seems to be little effort on the part of his assailant as he's dragged along the floor, the sides of his ragdoll body scraping against door frames as they take a turn out of the bedroom.
, it wouldn't hurt to  pour himself a bit of tipple. Just a bit. A splash, really.
"It got you here in one piece, didn't it?" Harry says with a chuckle, closing his front door.
But Harry does not, as Draco feared he would, instantly hex him, or even scowl at the sight of him. Harry's breathing comes ragged, full of the fear that paints itself starkly across his features, and his wand follows Draco as Draco takes a few more steps into the room.
"I hardly know how to sit in it," Harry admits, standing over Draco. "But it is pretty."
Then Malfoy breaks the moment by sneering. "Going to tell me to get out of
"Is there?" Ah. There's the danger. Draco had thought he'd climbed out of the particular sandpit that is Pansy's disappointment in him. Ever since their harrowing conversation in which Pansy had casually threatened to take over the atelier as majority owner, Draco had been making an effort to juggle
Harry's breathing slows, evens out to the rhythm of Draco's circles; Draco finds himself doing the same. For several minutes, neither of them speak, both focused on Harry's hand.
"I don't even know what some of those words are." Potter frowns, his eyes darting to look at Draco's measuring tape with wariness.
There, framed by the rocky wilderness just behind him, stands Harry Potter. Hair long, beard full, glasses cracked, but
"Did you help me because you wanted me to leave faster, or because you wanted to remind me you're a better person than me?" Malfoy asks, giving his foot an experimental wiggle.
Draco has nothing appropriate to say to that, and as he pinkens Harry looks about as embarrassed. Both men clear their throats and look away.
"Maybe both?" Harry snorts. "Tried picking up the guitar, turns out I'm tone-deaf. Asked Ron what he thought over a call and he told me, as a friend, that I ought to smash the guitar and put it out of its misery." Draco snorts in kind. Sounds like the sort of thing Weasley would say. "What else? Found out I'm rubbish at painting, but it might be because I was using watercolors and they kept bleeding all over the paper. Tried a bit of poetry, burned every last attempt. And there's, er, a failed garden plot outside?" He points toward the back of the house. "I kept forgetting to go outside and a load of gnomes got into it, so I gave up on that one."
The manor is a distant blob. Draco sways for a moment, then looks for Potter, whom he finds as a thatch of messy black hair breaking up all the flowers. He's overtaken by a brief urge to run his fingers through that hair, then draws his hands over his face as if smoothing the clay of his emotions, and approaches Potter.
"Well, I don't know if you know this, but plus ones rely on that operative word of
"Don't puff me up. It won't get you anywhere," Draco says with a thick tongue and a voice that feels like it's coming from somewhere else.
—that Draco looks away in an instant. He thinks Potter does the same, but he's not chancing another look. He takes his quill in hand, writes in a neat
"I thought this place was Unplottable."
"Potter," Draco sighs, coming out of his fugue state. "How attached are you to wearing trousers?"
Draco wants nothing more than to lose himself in Harry, to kiss him until his lips go numb, to finally take Pansy's pseudo-advice and have I-almost-died sex with Harry, bandages be damned. To do something with his body other than be frightened. But Harry, annoying in his kindness and his sixth sense for trauma, kisses him slowly, comfortingly on the sofa, and asks Draco how he's really feeling.
But it is the first time he sees Malfoy completely, he thinks. Not the loud boy he was, not really; now he's a man with thinning hair and twitching, flapping hands that he tries to hide when he knows he's being watched. Now vulnerable, afraid, isolated, traits that echo through the chasm inside Harry. Now compassionate, brave in spite of himself, bringing Harry back from the brink. Now asking to be called Draco.
"He just
i'm so happy to finally post this the end of this fic! it's been wonderful writing it, and i could not have finished this chapter without the beta expertise of ThestralHouseofBlack, Saphira, and Neev. i've been nervous about every part of this fic, from writing third person longfic for the first time in a long time, to the pacing and character development, and i have to thank all my cheerleaders from the start—my betas for this chapter, as well as spacehubsands, donnarafiki, gem♊️, crowry, and sunmoonandspoon—for keeping me on track and never letting me doubt myself.
"R-right," Potter says as he stands upright again, his arms festooned with cheap plastic bags. "I mean, thanks." He kicks the front door shut, then heads for one of the many other doors at the far end of the hall.
"I should leave." Draco begins to rise to his feet to do just that, but Pansy wrenches him back down with a shockingly strong arm.
"It's summer, and we're going to be outdoors," Draco says, letting Harry pepper his neck with absentminded kisses. "Color is simply chic."
later. "First you liked my new design for you, then you absolutely hated it and threw it at me, then you cooked me a very sexy lunch, after which you confided a bit of childhood trauma to me, and now you're learning I eavesdropped on you so you're going to tell me off for not having changed since school after all and then you're going to, just a guess, tell me to fuck right off and die, preferably outside your home." Draco finds he's dizzy, his mess of a sentence all coming out in one breath. He starts to push himself upright, all the better to go fuck right off and die, and for the sake of his spine, as well. "Did I get all that right?"
Potter likes him. It's more than just tolerating his company for the sake of a job; Potter seeks that company out, finds ways to steal away more of Draco's time. Maybe he's being delusional, considering Potter never
, that Harry has seen it in Ron's memories, will see it in Hermione's.
Draco hesitates. "When you were her age," he says, at length, "you were an abused little boy who had only recently known what it was like to sleep in a real bed."
She takes a moment to write her notes, and Draco doesn't like how much she seems to be putting to paper.
"Don't know what that's supposed to mean," Malfoy says, without turning around. At this distance he's less of a man and more of a white blur, and Harry speeds up to bring him back into focus.
"I think I'd bring a better implement than a measuring tape if I were here to kill you," Draco mutters, putting his quill down.
"Depressing," Harry agrees. Then he convinces Malfoy to share a boot with him, because if they're on holiday they should try weird novelties, and because it's massive. The barkeep only agrees because they're not fighting this time.
"Why come here?" That much he
"Yes, so. I felt bad, alright? I—" Harry swallows. Draco fights the urge to pull the teabag out of his mug—surely the tea is burning by now. "I just wanted to fix it. To make it up to you."
bloody promotion, and then I'll touch any wand you like!"
The Gala may as well be around the corner. Draco has so much work to do to finish this, and that's not even counting all the other work that awaits him at his dreaded desk. Pansy is right—he has other clients, and some of them are also Gala attendees, and they're technically no less important than Potter. A gown made to look like peacock butterfly wings wrapping around the wearer is currently in progress, as well as a rather severe, structured black set of robes with a stiff collar high enough to cradle the wearer's jaw. A bit like Severus Snape, distorted through the filter of couture.
