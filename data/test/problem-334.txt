pureblood trying to adapt to a modern, muggle-friendly society. But if you’re that worried about it, start by giving him a gift, or send him flowers.”
“Great.” Draco unwrapped his scarf from around his neck and tossed it over the back of the closest armchair. Then he froze. “What, by Merlin’s hairy bollocks, is that?”
He’d gotten Hermione and Weasley three of the handmade paper star lanterns from the Christmas Market, with intricate cut-outs that looked like lace. Two of them were larger than Draco’s head, one gold and one silver, and in between them dangled a much smaller white one.
“I’ve asked Pansy,” he says. “She won’t tell me anything, she just mutters things that make no sense.
“I suppose you’ll want to take the Floo?” he asked as he downed the remainder of his tea and carefully wrapped up the rest of the pastries.
Selwyn’s eyes darted from Draco to Potter and back. “Do I have your word that Skeeter won’t get a hold of this?”
“And that is what happened, isn’t it?” Theo says with a pointed look at Draco’s hand, which is still entwined with Potter’s.
Granger gazed up at him and blinked several times. Then she said, “Sorry. Yes, of course you can use the left arm. It’s just, I kept thinking of you as a potioneer who happens to work at a hospital. I’m feeling like a right tit because obviously you
Harry processed that. If she was telling the truth – and she wouldn’t be cruel enough to lie right now, not Hermione – then that meant…and then…but Harry had thought…and Draco wouldn’t…
“Nice to see you, Parkinson,” said Potter politely. He pushed the door closed behind him and proceeded to approach as though Draco were a wild animal. There was a large, thin, square package in his hands. “Er, hi,” he said.
“It’s alright.” There’s a hand squeezing his, and he blindly squeezes back, feeling thankful and confused. “Maybe we can just…practice some spells together. Defence? I’m good at defence.”
“Yes. I’ll inject them in as many places as possible, it’s faster than doing only a single injection and waiting for everything to be distributed. But I’ll alternate. So you’ll have a vein…” Draco raised his forearm and drew a line from the inside of his wrist to his elbow, “…and the first injection here will be a small bit of antidote A.” He tapped his index finger on his wrist. “Next one, a bit of antidote B.” He tapped a spot an inch higher up. “Then A again, then B, and so on. When we take him out of stasis and his blood flows again, they’ll be washed everywhere very quickly.”
– maybe kissed Potter, or even just told him how they felt. Draco half-wished he had his own set of notes that carried over from one iteration to the next to guide him along. ‘Punch Smith on Day 19’. ‘Antidote formula is:’. ‘Don’t try kissing Potter.’
“I despise you,” Draco said for the record and sat on the sofa. “But I won’t deny that I deserved that.”
Draco approved of the pettiness. Smith huffed and tried to pretend that wasn’t what he’d meant, but just then, Blaise came hurrying into the room.
“Second of all, what the hell are you on about? How did you screw up our anniversary? It’s not even until next week! I was avoiding talking to you because I was too afraid I might accidentally give away that I was planning an anniversary surprise for the two of us.”
The broom, which had been in the process of cleaning the ruffles of a dress robe, obediently clattered back down, bristles drooping.
He tilted his head back on the sofa and groaned in frustration. It’s been a week of this and he was already
Despite fearing the answer, Draco knew he had to ask, “And what exactly did your conversation entail?”
“True as that may be, I fear I offended her too much with my words. So I think I’ll stay here. Not only that, but it’s going to be my last Christmas in Hogwarts. I kind of thought it would be nice to spend Christmas in one of the places I call home…”
“Now, I doubt that, Harry.” Hermione shoved Ron’s legs away, but his whines of protest ended when she put them on her lap.
Harry told him how he found Remus’ memory box and how he hadn’t known when his parents’ anniversary was for the twenty-three years he’d been alive. Malfoy shook his head as if to say ‘
“So soft,” he murmurs, finding he can’t let go. His hands open and he pats Draco’s hair. Draco, in turn, leans into the touch and moans. Harry finds that he quite enjoys that sound, so he repeats the motion. Draco turns his head so that it’s his cheek that Harry now touches. Harry gulps at the contact, feeling out of his depth.
He hears familiar footsteps rush down the stairs. He smiles at the tell-tale jump he knows Draco does at the last three steps. It’s endearing that Draco can’t help himself but to jump. It doesn’t take long for Draco to enter the kitchen where Harry is nursing a warm hot chocolate.
“How very Slytherin of you Potter,” Pansy remarked, swirling the liquid in her glass. She was leaning on one hand, and her legs crossed elegantly to one side. Protecting her from wandering eyes as her skirt rode up slightly.
Don’t get him wrong, Harry would love to do anything to push Malfoy away and hex him into oblivion. Only, Malfoy wasn’t exactly acting like himself. Harry just had to
Harry was playing with the loose thread on his jumper, but he had enough presence to nod in reply, before shaking his head, “no Nev. I don’t think so… I think I’m gonna play one more round before heading for bed. I’ve probably drunk too much… I don’t know.”
Harry was about to ask what he needed but realised he couldn’t on account of Draco kissing him. Harry reasoned that he was a weak-willed guy, and when faced with such a situation, you couldn’t blame him. He didn’t resist as Draco tugged on Harry’s shirt bringing them closer together. Harry’s eyes closed and he lost himself in the sensation. Draco sucked on Harry’s lower lip, biting it lightly. The pain alerted Harry, bringing him back to the present. He gathered all his strength to push Draco away.
, but not like this. Not with both of them so drunk, they’d probably forget it the day after. But Draco was already so close… His eyes lowered to Harry’s neck. His unmarked, beautiful, beautiful neck. Draco’s smirk became predator-like, and he watched Harry’s Adam’s apple tremble as he gulped. He pushed Harry’s chin up and to the side, exposing his target.
Flitwick carried on with his lecture, “this arrow is inspired by Cupid, hence the name Eros’ arrow. Of course, that arrow is a lot less potent and simply injects the feeling of romance to a person. This is somewhat deadlier as you become blind to things. Anger, sadness and fear are healthy and necessary sometimes.” Flitwick looked over his glasses, taking note of the students who cowed at his words, he’d encourage them to visit the hired mind-healer later. “It goes without saying, I do not want any of you touching this arrow. Are we clear?”
His cheerful peace and quiet seem to take a turn when Professor Slughorn notices Harry. He squeezes through the tables, making his way to Harry with an enthusiastic smile.
“No catch… I just want to believe you’re doing the best you can. I used to believe the worst in you, and maybe if I can see you trying… it’ll help me?”
: Sixth form – ages 16-18 where students take 3-4 A-Level subjects over the course of two years (Year 12 take AS subjects, Year 13 take A2 subjects). The American equivalent to Freshman year of college, in terms of content taught. MFL = Modern Foreign Language. AQA is an external exam board.
He watched as everyone’s attention suddenly gravitated toward the Saviour. He leaned back into the couch he sat on. It wouldn't be easy to do what he was planning in front of many witnesses. There would be so much that could go wrong, he didn’t need further humiliation.
Malfoy was apparently faster than Harry gave credit for as before he knew it Malfoy was touching the arrow.
Harry looked back at Draco, and couldn’t resist kissing him again, “oh darling, you have much to learn about why
It was difficult to see Harry and not act in the way he wanted. He no longer had the buffer of the Arrow. He no longer had the excuse to hug Harry; to claim him as his. He sighed, annoyed at the direction of his thoughts, and attempted to return his focus on his work. The words, however, decided to dance around his page. He groaned and crossed his arms in front of him.
On Harry’s turn to kiss Draco, he took inspiration from earlier and held Draco’s jaw with his right hand. He turned Draco’s face to the side and before leaning in, inhaled his scent. Draco’s cologne had faded as the party progressed so all Harry could smell was
Hermione has to admit, the sight is adorable. They aren’t able to take their eyes off each other, it’s as if everything else around them has disappeared. They also can’t seem to stop touching each other. They’re either holding hands or each other in a hug. It makes sense, having not seen each other in so long. She is surprised they haven’t been approached by anyone wondering what in Merlin’s name is going on. Only, when she looks up she realises they have been noticed. They just seem shocked by what’s going on that they haven’t closed in on the table.
Draco reached out, grabbing Harry’s hand and tugged him over to another section of the store. Harry merely smiled adoringly at his boyfriend, “yes, dear.”
Harry smiled, still refusing to look away from the ground, “that’s the thing, Nev. I don’t know. I don’t what I’m doing anymore.”
Draco leans his head against the wall and in between gasping, he quietly thanks Harry. He grips the wall with his left hand and uses it to steady himself to stand. He nods at the three and hesitates slightly. He wants to stay with Harry; to not lose him, and make sure he stays alive.
He sat by one of the flowerbeds and took out one of the pasties. Most of the outer crust crumbled off before Harry could take his first bite. He hoped the other one had more left. He really liked the crunchy outer layer that the others lacked.
Draco rejected the idea of acting like the proper pureblood whilst Harry disregarded everyone who wanted him to be the figurehead of a new improved Wizarding world. For both of them, the Muggle world offered solace. It was funnily enough where they reconnected.
Harry sucked in a gasp. He had but hadn’t expected the question. He knew Draco’s curious mind would want to know why Harry hadn’t paired him with anyone yet, but at the same time, he hated having to reveal to Draco that he had no match.
Harry hummed, taking another sip. They sat in silence for a while, before Draco slapped his thighs and stood up. “Right then, I’ll get breakfast started. You still like them sunny-side-up right?”
Harry pulled his earbuds out and focused all his attention on Draco, “why? You were so excited to get back home to your mother…” His eyes were drawn onto the letter Draco was holding, no doubt the main influence for his decision.
’ which made Harry wonder if he was in a fever dream. Because never would he have thought Ron would willingly join in with this. Draco was also somewhat more intoxicated because Harry caught him looking at his lips as he neared for their fourth kiss. They were so close to kissing on the lips that Harry couldn’t help but close his eyes. Only, the peck to his nose made him giggle, an action Draco copied as he sat down. Harry was tempted to tell him to stay next to him since he knew that wouldn’t be the last kiss they would share. And with so few places left...
“I didn’t take the mark. They thought I wasn’t worthy to have one yet. I have to prove myself first of all. This assignment they gave me is what will do it. It will secure my place next to my parents and elevate the standing we have. Once I’ve done this task everything will be okay. It will be okay. It’s all going to be okay.”
“I’m pretty sure you’ve heard from Granger or Weasley. I’ve been thinking for the past few months, well, past two years really. If I’m being honest. And I only came to the realisation that I was nothing but a piece of shit since the moment we met. It was all on me from the beginning. Every action I made against you, was just a moment of jealousy and rage. Here at Hogwarts, I was free to express my emotions for the first time. It was… so euphoric to let go, you know?”
Draco’s head bangs against the tile floors as a result of the curse. He grunts at the force and gasps for air. He hopes death is swift so that the pain inside and outside ceases.
Harry sighed, and walked around his living room as he talked. He noticed a sock by his coffee table and picked it up.
Cally hummed, “any lily in particular? I saw you looking at the tiger lilies earlier. They typically represent mercy and compassion. We also have a few in yellow that represent thankfulness, if you’d like? In my opinion, white lilies would look wonderful with the irises. As they're for your mother, they're very appropriate as they represent motherhood.”
Fortunately, for Harry, Draco remained tactile with him. The hugs had lessened, but Draco still reached for Harry’s hand whenever they passed each other in the corridor.
He unlocked and opened the door. He nearly tripped over the pile of shoes by the welcome mat, and almost cried when he lost his grip on his takeout bag. He travelled far and wide for this conquest and like hell he’d lose it because of some upturned trainers.
Flitwick knew this was coming so he wasn’t too concerned, but seeing a student in distress always made him sad. He carefully spelt the arrow away, locked it in his office, and left the boys alone. Harry had shown his initiative last session so Flitwick knew they would be okay.
Draco’s head spun to look at Harry, who already had his gaze fixed on him, “what could have possibly caused you conflict?”
He bit his lip and searched the common room, looking for anyone who could be a worthy replacement. It was too early in the morning, so only a few people had arrived. Some were looking frantically through their notes, revising for the morning exams. Harry considered himself lucky that his speaking test would take place in the afternoon.
The position is similar to how they sat sharing a horse during the rare times they were able to catch a break in the
Two men lay side by side on their bed one early morning. The only sound came from birds chirping their song outside by the trees. One man leaned on his elbow slightly so they were higher than the other. He looked down at the other man and lovingly traced his cheek. They smiled at each other, content in the bliss that was their life.
The man rolled his eyes, “it’s just water. If I wanted to poison you, I would have done so in the past. Merlin knows how many chances I’ve had during our stakeouts.”
Malfoy nodded, smiling in light excitement, “yes! It’s not a very affluent area, mind you, so I don’t know much to show you. Maybe afterwards we can return and I can show you the art gallery? It’s free of charge, you know?”
Hermione is confused, this doesn't sound like a start to a romance. Which she asks the two before her. This causes Harry to start laughing.
Draco’s grip tightened, “I think fear?” At this Draco’s breathing increased slightly, “right now I hate how dark it is in this room. Can we go outside? Please?” Toward the end, Draco’s voice raised in pitch, his fear of being in the dark suddenly coming back to him. “I don’t like not knowing what’s hidden in the corner. Harry!” He pulled Harry to a stand, tugging the front of his shirt, “let’s go. Now. Please!” His eyes were wide, tinted in pink still.
Draco shushed him, “Harry. It’s okay to be sad about your parents not being around. Don’t belittle yourself like that.” Oh, Draco must’ve heard him. “Also, just because they’ve passed away doesn’t mean they’re no longer married,” he added.
His approach was anything but silent, but he did want to catch Draco’s attention. His footsteps were loud, and Draco was glaring at him when he finally reached his seat.
Harry slumps, realising that Draco has retreated. Unhappily, Harry continues with his lecture. Looking up now and again to check if Draco is fine. It’s obvious that Draco isn’t, but Harry carries on. It’s only after the fifth frustrated sigh that Harry stops altogether.
’ let him know who it was who just arrived. Harry started to rush his task of draining the pasta, so he could join Teddy and Draco faster. Three years together (well, two and a half years, but Harry wanted to round up), yet the newness of their relationship was still present. Harry believed they’d always be in their Honeymoon period.
Draco squinted at Harry as if to read his thoughts. He was probably trying to, so Harry avoided his eyes. “Well, from what I’ve seen, the two seem to have been interested in each other for a while. Why? Are they your next project? Good luck with that. I’ve tried myself, but Pansy’s mum has plans for her that don’t involve Blaise.”
The Half-Blood Prince’s book truly is a blessing and he has no qualms about taking advantage of it. Not if it gets him the high marks in the class he’s been struggling with since the beginning of his time at Hogwarts.
Ron flaps his arms around, “Woah. Woah, Woah. That’s a lot of information all at once. I’d love to know how that happened, but first, finish your other story.” He relaxes back into his previous posture before nearly falling off his seat in surprise at a new voice.
Meanwhile, Harry is struggling to keep his balance as Draco suddenly collapses against him. He grabs Draco’s elbows and lowers both of them to the ground. He pulls Draco in between the gap of his legs and leans Draco’s back onto his chest. His arms wrap around Draco, cocooning him and keeping him steady. He can feel every stutter of Draco’s breath, every sob that shakes through his whole frame. Harry’s eyes water at the guilt Draco confesses, the struggle that he is facing every day.
Draco hummed and closed his eyes. He grabbed his wand and used a spell to turn their radio on. Soft jazz came through the speakers and he felt himself return to that day. That one day that started all this… this… his mind wandered for the perfect word. This… serendipity. Yes, that was what he could call this…
“While I agree with you wholeheartedly, Blaise is very respectful. He would hate to come between Pansy and her mother.” Draco had started to tap on the table, and he bit his lip in thought, “but with the right goading, I’m sure he could see what he’d be missing.”
It was an ordinary day. Well, it was, unless your name was Harry Potter, the famed Hero of the Wizarding World. A man who couldn’t even step into Diagon Alley without having his shopping analysed. Thinking back to last month, Harry cringed at the memory of his latest scandal after a jewellery purchase for Molly. Speculations of a secret engagement carried onto the next month, with no hope of dying.
It reminds Harry of the judgements against him. How people assumed he was bad because of things his aunt said to her gossiping neighbours.
The sounds of chairs being tucked away and bags lifted off the ground fill the classroom. Noise levels steadily increased, teenagers eager to leave and ‘study’ for the next two hours until dinner.
his mum was fond of. And yet… there’s the chance to be with his other half. He doesn’t want to lose this opportunity.
Draco mumbled and burrowed deeper into Harry’s embrace. Harry almost missed it, with how low his voice was, but he managed to hear the end of it, “–miss this…”
Harry’s eyes lit up, his hand was getting tired so he lowered it to his side, grasping Draco’s hand along the way. “So why did you choose to ignore me?”
, he thought. He patted Harry’s jaw as he  backed away and stood up, somewhat wobbly, and headed back to his seat.
Draco glared at those who dared chuckle at his dearest, but smiled when he turned to Harry, “Sure Harry!”
“Harry, I'm glad you’re okay,” Narcissa says, her hand tousling his messy hair. He grins abashedly at her, enjoying the treatment.
Satisfied, Draco stood up and faced Harry. He smiled at the shorter man and accepted his food. Harry simply rolled his eyes and walked back into their living room. Draco followed behind and sat on the couch while Harry headed to the kitchen. He returned with two plates, some utensils and a bag of fish and chips. Draco smiled at Harry and the two plated their food with practised ease.
Harry froze. Of all the people… Draco? Not just that, but a boy? Was he giving out vibes to people? Not that he cared what they thought of him, but it’s a curious thought. Like, was there something about him that made people think he wanted to kiss boys? Besides the thought, Draco? He looked across the circle where Draco was sat next to Blaise. He looked frozen in place too.
Harry is about to step away from Draco but finds he can’t on account for the tight grip he has on Harry. Draco stares at him as if in a challenge, he tilts his head to the side drawing Harry’s eye to the mark he left. Draco smirks when Harry gets lost in the memory. He’s about to lean and give another one when Ron enters the kitchen.
He was gasping, struggling to let in air as tears rushed down his pink cheeks. “H-Harry…” He gasped, his free hand reaching out to him. Harry rushed to his side, not before prying Draco’s hand away from the arrow so he could wrap both arms around Harry. He dug his head into Harry’s shoulder and hiccoughed. One of his hands raised to the back of Harry’s hair where he tugged the baby hairs, while the other wrapped around his neck to bring him in closer.
Harry thinks back to the first day he brought Draco and Narcissa over. Kreacher practically falls on their feet, bowing, one step away from kissing their shoes. He wails, “Kreacher is happy Master Draco is in the Most Noble House of Black. Oh yes, he is. Mistress Narcissa too! Oh, hows wonderful it be’s to have true Blacks once again!”
Harry nodded, “they’re practically perfect for each other.” The glow between the two was starting to become silver again and he was practically blinded by the brightness. He had noticed that the longer the emotions were suppressed the brighter the light. Ron and Hermione’s had been subtle because they were open in expressing their love for each other.
“What’s got to you mate?” Harry asked, pulling an earpiece out. His voice apparently broke Ron’s state and he finally noticed where he was. Harry grew concerned, there wasn’t a lot of things that could make his friend dissociate, so this was probably a serious matter.
When the Arrow was finally on display, Flitwick backed away and gestured toward it. Draco took a deep breath and walked towards it. He looked at Flitwick, seeming to come to a decision. He turned back to Harry and was by his side in an instant.
It takes a while, but the group hug finally ends with surprised laughter. Birdsong starts somewhere in the Forbidden Forest, unexpected, but truly a sign that fighting is finally over. Well, physical fighting, that is. Harry is well aware that there is still the task of the fickle Ministry to tackle. Hopefully, he won’t be required for it this time. A seventeen-year-old mustn’t be necessary for it, surely.
“I’m pretty sure I know my own mind, Mione.” Harry leaned further into his couch, wanting to meld with the material. Maybe if he became part of the seat he’d fade into obscurity and just be normal. Harry Potter, the chair. Sounded nice.
“I say, my boy! Well done! You seem to be ahead of plenty of your classmates. Embodying your mother’s talent, I see! She and I would be so proud of you. Now, I best be leaving you to your work. Do let me know if you need any assistance my boy.”
“Don’t be daft, there’s nothing to apologise for,” he looked away from Draco’s curious stare and coughed, “besides… I, uhh– gotusedtoit.”
Twenty minutes passed and Harry somehow found himself sat between Dean and Neville, with Draco on the other side with the other Slytherin who stayed behind. He took a shot of the firewhisky and leaned back on his hands, entirely relaxed. Acting like the eighteen-year-old he was meant to be.
There weren’t a lot of things that piqued Harry’s interest these days. It seemed as if he was tired of mystery and intrigue. The thought of having to run to go somewhere other than the great hall for breakfast left a sour taste in his mouth. He just wanted to live his life simply, and with the least amount of drama.
Draco hums in reply, content with the affection Harry shows him. He turns his head so he can see the sparkling laurel leaf green eyes. Once Harry starts talking again, all he can do is focus on his mouth.
Harry lifted the flower and traced it against Draco’s cheek, “see… I was conflicted about how to act around you. You obviously weren't acting out of your own free will. I couldn’t do anything but to appease you. I couldn’t respond, no matter how… How badly I wanted to.”
But before he gets the chance, a heat so intense fills the massive room. Draco looks behind him and sees Vince struggling with his wand. Greg is nowhere to be seen. Draco and Harry run side by side and cast spell after spell to try and diminish the flames that are so close to kissing their heels.
She conveys her sincerest apologies and explains how she was not kept in the loop and was not aware that Sirius would die in the outcome. She had assumed he’d be kept prisoner, and she would be able to talk him into their side. When she heard it was her sister that killed their dear cousin, that’s when she knew there was no going back. Bellatrix and Sirius had once been close, but Azkaban has a way that changes people. She tells Harry that when Lucius came back, he was numb to Narcissa’s affections until she gave up and just played her part as his pretty wife.
Draco checked both directions, making sure no one wasn’t coming any time soon and made his way over. The closer he got to Potter, the quicker his heart went. It was just anxiety, it had nothing to do with how relaxed Potter looked.
He shuffles on his feet, insecure about where he stands. A hand reaches out to him, covering the view of his shoes that he found so fascinating. He knows those hands, the callouses from hard labour, how they feel against his skin. He takes the hand and looks up into the
“I’m scared to apologise. I, of course, want to be forgiven. I know I don’t deserve it, but the thought of people not accepting my apology or… or hexing me instead… I’m scared. I know I obviously deserve it, that and worse.”
Draco laughed softly and Harry found himself bringing his other fingers toward his face. He caressed his cheek fondly and watched as Draco closed his eyes and leaned into his palm. Harry felt his breath stutter when Draco’s eyes opened. He could feel Draco start to lean in and was feeling his resolve to not do this decrease. But, as Draco closed in, his pink-tinted eyes brought Harry back to reality. This wasn’t what Draco wanted. Not truly. And Harry would hate himself if he took advantage of the situation.
“So you’re saying if… Hypothetically, I was talking just now… You heard nothing?” He couldn’t believe it.
“You should’ve seen his face, Mione. It’s like I shattered his heart into millions of pieces. I hated that I was the one to do that to him.” His face on the table, hidden from view by his arms. He wasn’t surprised when Hermione asked him to repeat what he said. He straightened and repeated what he said, albeit quieter since now people would be able to hear him.
l think I'll expand on this prompt and make it a fic. There's potential to make this one grow... hmm... Anyways, thanks so much to those who have subscribed and given kudos to this story! I truly appreciate each and every one of you!!
“Do you think I’m ready for the next session? What more can I feel? I think I’m pretty well rounded now, anything more and I’ll probably be worse. I like how I am now Harry, can we just stop at this?”
Harry was the same. This little world of theirs was bliss. Pure unadulterated bliss. He lifted his arm closest to Draco and wrapped it around him, pulling him closer to his side.
Before Draco knew it, Harry had grabbed his hair on back of his neck and pulled him off. His lips were touching the air for a meagre two seconds before Harry’s lips descended upon his own. Draco’s eyes shut and his hand on Harry’s chin moved up to play with his hair. By some clever manoeuvring, Draco found himself sitting on Harry lap and they continued kissing. Hands were moving up and down his sides, making him giggle from the sensation. The kiss eventually broke due to his laughter.
“Of course, after all, us MFL students should stick together, n’est-ce pas?” Draco asked, eyes twinkling in humour.
Harry interrupts, “wait a second. You make it sound like your mother loved Sirius. Why did she order Kreacher to lie? Why did… Was she aware of it? Did she know–”
“Yes, professor,” Harry mumbles, standing up to add the bitter root when he notices it’s time. He chooses to ignore the sour feeling he got when Slughorn mentioned his mother.
He only cancelled the charm once he saw the game resuming, implying that Hermione had answered the question. He refused to look Hermione in the eye as he paid attention to Dean who picked up the bottle to spin it. And so the game proceeded.
! Better than any honey he has ever consumed. Little moans come from them, though Draco isn’t too sure who from. Hands start to roam, and they quickly lose their breath. They part, and pant. Sharing the air between them.
Blaise stared back blankly, before laughing. “Oh, Potter! I have such a good story for that. We don’t result to physically harming our peers. No, we go for something much more fun and enjoyable. We may hex a quill to write incorrectly, or spell ink to look invisible to everyone but the writer. My absolute favourite was hexing all of Draco’s clothes Gryffindor red, and his hair a bright shiny gold. He refused to leave the common room for that weekend. Pity as it was a Hogsmeade weekend too.”
“What? It’s true. Not all of us can be bleeding hearts.” Draco chooses that as the time to back away whistling as he walks off. The whistles fade before his footsteps.
At this Malfoy pouted, drawing Harry’s eyes to his lips. He never noticed how pink they were against his pale skin. They looked soft, cared for, unlike Harry’s chapped lips he continuously bit at.
Harry started to write his number when he heard it. The impatient huffing behind him. He finally gave in and turned around. He wasn’t too surprised, it was indeed Malfoy.
The latest pair involved people Harry was cautious to approach. It was between two Slytherins and Harry was unsure about how to make it start. He wasn’t familiar with the two, and frankly, Parkinson frightened him but the silver glow between her and Zabini was beautiful and Harry wanted to see it more.
“Turns out, our auras had joined and because I was under it, I barely noticed. Draco… can you say something please?”
The teasing tone of Sirius’ words made Harry smile slightly. He turned the picture over and saw that it was another picture of his parents dancing alone. Lily had leaned her head against James’ shoulder and it was obvious that the two were whispering lovingly to each other. Harry’s heart tightened at the sight. It was something that he missed out on seeing.
Harry blocks his ears as if he could prevent himself from hearing it. Little luck doing that, especially if the noise was coming from inside. Inside of him, where he was freakish and weird and strange and–
Draco’s laughter slowed into little chuckles before they faded into the room. He looked at Harry’s stricken face before realisation hit him. He smiled sardonically, “I don’t have a partner do I?”
Mikey whistled and then pinched his lips together as if he had sucked the lemons in the bowl before him, “well that’s shite. I hope they don’t fight. God knows I’d hate to get in between them if they act homophobic.”
Oh, he was mortified. Maybe he’ll have to save the apology for when he returns from the holidays. Or maybe never. Maybe it was his fate to never be forgiven by Potter…
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed away slightly, “that’s only something you’ve experienced. I’m pretty sure he would rather spit on the face of the Minister than offer me he–”
He walks out to the clearing where Voldemort and his followers wait. Riddle is surprised to see Harry alone, but knowing what he does of the boy, it’s to be expected at this point.
“I do, and I know she’s just trying to protect me, but sometimes…well, she goes a bit too far. It comes from a good place, but I got upset because she refuses to admit that she should have told me, and she continues to keep some of these from me. I got her to show me most of them, but not all.” He lowered his arm onto his lap and stared at it. “There is something on here that really disturbs her. I can tell.”
“So what I think might have happened…Merlin, this is such a strange thing to be saying.” Hermione sighed and ran both her hands through her hair. “I think Death used the time sand to send you back to the point in time when you came through the first time, right as you were about to pass through the Veil.”
The sound of pecking on glass started just a moment later. Draco groaned and rolled over, inelegantly getting to his knees so he could reach the window. “Who the fuck sends an owl in this weather?”
She rolled her eyes. “Of course. We still have the photo album as well, the one of your parents. I realize it might feel different for you to look at it now that you’ve spent so much time with them –”
He was afraid that one of those days, he would blurt out how he really felt and that would be it for them. Harry hadn’t said anything about the matter, but surely he’d noticed the way Draco couldn’t help but look at him. He couldn’t stop himself from wishing Harry was his, really his, and he was afraid the emotion was written all over his face whenever Harry stripped him down to the core.
“Yeah,” Potter sighed. “I didn’t mean to stress her out even more when she’s already fighting with Ron, but sometimes – rarely – she really does infuriate me.”
Potter sat up straighter, which Draco took to mean he was feeling a bit better. He stood and plucked the card out of Weasley’s hands. “Enough of that,” he said. “Now, should we start figuring out how to investigate those poisonings, or just drink until we forget all about the bloody time loop.”
“The love room, maybe?” Harry sounded unsure. “My mother’s love stopped the Killing Curse once, and it’s what made the spell to be brought to a loved one work for me as well so I could leave the cairn, even when –” He froze.
“You lunatic!” Draco shouted back, rushing over as to keep Potter from trying again, just in case he was planning to. “Do you know how dirty that thing is?”
“Yeah, eventually, but it’s in code.” Potter frowned. “The reason I started yelling was because instead of
“And…” Draco’s foot bumped against something. He looked down. “That celebration includes disembodied genitalia?”
Potter looked around with interest as they made their way into the room. “Not much left here, is there?”
“More like absolution,” Draco said, realizing it was true the moment he said it. “Afterward, I feel better. Like I've suffered, and it's over with, and I'm allowed to forget just for a little while.”
“Malfoy,” said Potter on the other side of the door, and when Draco didn’t reply, “Malfoy, don’t make me blast my way into the room.”
“You complete halfwit, I gave up on hoping you’d love me back so long ago!” Draco shook his head like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “I started trying to date other people, to try and get over you, but you kept sabotaging me like you just didn’t want me to be happy.”
“Still, Hermione said it was difficult, and she was impressed by how dedicated you were to figuring out a solution.”
“Not at all, not at all,” Ernie says cheerily. “In my opinion, a healthy amount of gin will put anyone in a much more benevolent mood.”
“So, they’ll still be in the blood but harmless, and it gives me time to create something that’ll actually eliminate them,” Draco finished.
“I know you’re wondering,” Potter said eventually, quietly. “I know you all are. It’s not easy to talk about.”
“Apples and ginger and cinnamon,” Molly adds, then pauses and frowns. “Nutmeg, too. Simply marvellous.”
“Because he’s the only one who’s crazy enough about you, and crazy enough in general, to do something this ridiculously over the top.”
She had seen a lot during her years at the school. Students who quarreled and cursed each other were common occurrences, but this year, it had been worse than she’d ever seen before. First it had been Katie Bell, who hadn’t died thanks to Severus, but had to endure a lengthy stay in St. Mungo’s, and now there was suddenly a severely injured Draco Malfoy to save.
Potter reached for something on the floor next to him. The wand he held up a moment later looked vaguely familiar to Draco, but he couldn’t quite place it. It was unassuming, dark wood and little in the way of decoration, and yet his attention was captured by it in a way that felt…strange.
Oh, this was so very bad. How could he stop Potter from looking around his office or at least turning his head to the left? He’d simply have to be so charming, so fascinating-
And that was the reason why he was now standing in the middle of Draco’s garden, ready to get de-gnoming.
Weasley started on the task of casting spells to clean the dishes as Granger stood in the middle of the room, looking undecided. “Dessert first or gifts first?” she asked.
“Is there a limit to how many different magical...conditions, I suppose, and reactions can be put on a substance?” she asked. Draco got the distinct impression she was barely resisting the temptation to start taking notes. Some things never changed, he thought, although what
“Huh,” said Draco after giving him another kiss. “Some people? What people? Will this be in the Prophet come morning?”
“Suppose we’ll take a walk after all,” he heard, and a whispered spell and a pair of surprisingly strong arms supported him all the way to the nearest Apparition point.
Draco was caught off guard yet again, and he briefly wondered why it couldn’t ever be Potter’s turn to act excessively awkward. Of course, he knew the answer already, which was that Potter wasn’t anywhere near as likely to be distracted by his conversational partner’s sheer presence and charisma. Potter also wasn’t the one acting like a third-year Hufflepuff dealing with his first crush.
But then Draco was banging his head against the wall again, cracking the tile. He felt fingers scrabbling for a better grip.
Harry took and released a deep breath, then nodded. “Alright. Did you ask him who’s been given a barrier cube lately?”
She patted her purse. "Muggle mail for my parents, I need to drop it into the post box down the street."
“Of course you would go for something so offensively Gryffindorish,” Draco muttered and regarded the shimmering ornament Harry seemed inexplicably fond of.
Harry stopped his pacing and turned so he could level a proper glare at his best friend. “I feel like you’re not treating this situation with the level of alarm and urgency that it requires.”
Holly soon brought her the essence of dittany and several healing cloths. The young assistant had only been with her for four months. She’d been at the top of her class of trainee healers and had been insistent on doing her apprenticeship at Hogwarts – a thing which Madam Pomfrey was incredibly thankful for at this very moment.
“Right, well, it might be a bit late for that,” Potter points out, finally letting go of Draco, “seeing how you rushed me of the library in a panic and all.”
Parkinson seems to agree, if her face is anything to go by while she says, “Today, there is only one big event to be excited about – or terrified of, in the case of our participants – and that’s the Charms round.”
“I mean,” he said, clearing his throat, “you two clearly have more to talk about. I’ll leave you to it.”
Soon enough, Draco realized that there was no way to gain any sort of control over the situation. Weasley just wouldn’t bloody stop putting up lights – yet another row of fairy lights in Slytherin green and silver around the window, then a grouping of flickering candles – lit by magic as not to be a fire hazard, which was just about the only thing about the situation that Draco appreciated.
They all waited, Harry biting his lip, Draco barely resisting the urge to run his hand through his hair, and Granger clutching her hands in her lap so hard her knuckles were white. Parvati sat straight as an arrow and still as stone, not even blinking as she took in Harry’s appearance.
Granger gave him a shrug, apparently figuring they might as well put all their cards on the table. “We’re pretty sure that this victim time-travelled,” she said. “And he lost his memory, so we don’t know how far in the future he came from, or what the circumstances were of him getting poisoned.”
“Suits you,” Harry said with a grin. “And here, this is for the two of you – well, three of you, technically.”
Granger’s mouth formed a relieved smile before she made a pleased noise and pulled a small silver rectangle from her handbag. She walked over to an empty bit of wall within Potter’s field of vision and slapped the rectangle on the wall with her flat palm. It expanded and rippled, and a moment later Draco was looking at a peaceful, snow-covered yard through glass that was rapidly growing ice crystals on the outside.
“Draco, I’m not sure you understand just how serious this is. These are under lock and key in the Department of Mysteries –”
“You need to eat better,” Harry said, skimming fingertips over the spot where Draco's pointy hipbones were hidden under his trousers. “You're so thin. It worries me.”
“Whatever. Are you finally going to throw yourself at Potter after this display?” She gestured around the room.
For a few silent seconds, both of them looked at the unconscious Draco. Suddenly, Severus’ head shot up and his eyes flashed dangerously as he called out, “Speaking of Potter!” He spun around and approached Harry, who was still distraught and sobbing occasionally. Holly seemed to be trying to calm him, but she couldn’t quite get through to him. He was clearly under shock. Severus didn’t seem to care, however. He decisively pushed aside the assistant, crouched in front of the Gryffindor, took him by the shoulders, and shook him hard.
“It was silly, of course, to think I could have prevented her dying if only I was trained, not when we were all in the middle of that massive battle, but the thought never quite left, that desire to protect. And now, Sylvana dying as well…this is…”
“She’s a Goblin, she’ll be fine. However, you failed to mention that you expect me to be mining treasures for you.”
, but it was somehow drawing power from a ley line, and essentially it was designed to keep every living thing
“Because it’s not like we know anyone named after a flower or anything,” Potter pointed out drily. Draco smirked at that, and Potter, catching it, smirked back while the parents-to-be murmured endearments at Granger’s belly.
Even after Snape had left, Harry continued to stand by the doors of the hospital wing. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply in and out. He felt tired, thoroughly exhausted.
“What?” he asked stupidly as soon as he glimpsed a corner of canvas. Potter had made this? Potter had painted him something?
Draco looked up and straight into Harry Potter's eyes. The savior of the wizarding world was standing in front of him, face flushed, an open bottle of firewhisky in one hand. His hair and shoulders were covered in silver glitter and tiny purple stars. More than likely they were from one of the many balloons hovering just beneath the ceiling, which exploded at random intervals and showered whoever happened to be standing beneath him with their contents. Draco strongly suspected Lavender Brown of procuring them for the party.
“The Bakewell tart, Potter, that’s how it all started! They got to Pansy when she was in the kitchens for whatever reason, and everything developed from there. This is a house-elf incursion!”
“Hermione said she did as much as she could without giving away the why of it. Sue didn’t want to stay home from work, but Neville walks her there and back home. He sleeps over when he can, too. I don’t think she minds.” Potter smirked. “Hermione told her to be careful with food and drink, just in case. And she’s still got Auror instincts, you know, so I hope she’ll be fine.”
“I made…this,” Potter said awkwardly. “Because I didn’t know how else to tell you that I…well, the thing with the painting is…oh, just open it, please.”
It’s a pain to get all the sponges made. Harry can’t imagine it’s terribly exciting for the audience either, watching them all mix batter for so long. At least they are allowed to make use of the sideboard with the cooling charm this round, else he’s sure people would be starting to fall asleep from the boredom of watching them all fan their sponges for a sodding hour. The only thing of note that happens is Ernie throwing his ruined sponge at a heckler in the crowd in frustration, and starting over.
Harry gave him a dark look. “You don’t understand anything at all,” he said, and stormed out of the room, eyes blazing with so much determination that Draco knew this wasn't the end of it.
Right,” said Draco, who realized then that despite the intrigue of it, he didn’t have much desire to revisit that night either. “Sorry.”
“I can only hope that Molly’s enthusiasm about another grandchild will be catching,” she said. “Anyway, this isn’t why you’re here.”
“Potter, I don’t know how to put this delicately,” Pansy said as she picked her way carefully, putting weight onto her sparkly heels only after she’d tested and made sure there was solid ground beneath every step and not another gnomehole hidden in the grass, “but I think you have a problem.”
Potter looked down at Draco's wrist and frowned. It was fairly clear at what – Draco had scratched himself raw not three hours earlier, and swelling and redness still peeked out from beneath the cuff of his shirt.
"Congratulations," he said, and then felt ridiculous. "On it being healthy so far, I mean. It's one less stressor, yeah?"
But Draco didn't listen, he was too busy savoring the new pain, because even this he deserved. Suddenly, it felt less like a punishment and more like an absolution, and when Potter loosened his grip, he wanted to howl with mental anguish at the loss.
Granger opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Draco blurted out, “You could stay with me.”
This late at night, the corridors of St Mungo’s were close to deserted, although the place was never truly quiet. There were only six people waiting in the reception area. Draco thought it might have been the emptiest he’d ever seen it, although it was possible that it was a trick of the eye. The area had been expanded and modernized the year before, making it bright and welcoming, with comfortable chairs and sofas. It was an extreme contrast to the cramped room it has been before, where six people would have been a much bigger, much more obvious presence.
The next cake has the crowd gasping in amazement and makes Kingsley’s jaw drop. It’s a tiered cake, stacked off-center, sculpted to look like a rocky hill, with a little creek made from sugar syrup flowing from the very top to the bottom through a series of waterfalls. Harry is shocked how much it looks like actual water, and he can’t even begin to imagine which spells it might take to create a moving river that won’t soak into the sponge. Butterflies, made from a delicate sort of edible paper, perch on the cake and flutter their wings.
He had to admit that a small part of him had expected her to focus on helping Potter to the detriment of everything and everyone else, and he was glad to see that wasn’t the case. Instead she had been polite, as forthcoming as she could be, and had agreed to accommodate him in every way he could reasonably expect her to. Maybe he should have been surprised that they were able to interact so civilly and smoothly, but he also knew that they had long since grown up and changed from who they’d been before and during the war.
“Oh.” Harry shifted and fidgeted, as though trying to get comfortable but utterly unable to. “I saw him down at the party. He was throwing himself at Hannah Abbott.”
“Really? To what do I owe the honor?” Draco drawled. His fingers twitched – a tick he'd acquired during the war, which wouldn't leave him. He was nervous, and not entirely sure why.
“Well, yes, generally, but we do need to do a certain amount of maintenance on it. She’s careful not to spend too much time in there, she says she’ll never want to leave otherwise. I was told that before the decision was made to keep it locked, there were actually a few people who died because they refused to leave it. Or, when they did, the sudden absence of all the emotion they’d felt in the room literally caused a lethal shock.”
“Harry?” Ron whispers. He’s so confused. Harry finally enters and has to do a double take. Ron doesn’t blame him, he’s sure it's quite a scene they make.
Ron looks so confused Hermione almost feels bad for him. After a quick lap around, they find that yes, she was correct, everything not belonging to Harry has been taken.
“I didn’t know if you guys would accept me.” His voice came out so small, so fragile, a voice Hermione hasn’t heard in years. “And it’s Draco, and I didn't know what you guys would say. And then I wanted to tell you, But I figured you’d be mad at me for hiding for so long.”
.” Pansy shudders and sinks back into her chair. “It’s devastating. And I can't go to the Aurors because honestly, why would they care about an ex-Death Eater?”
“We go over at 5 to see if Harry is still there. And if not, we can at least snoop around.” Hermione doesn't usually condone snooping- but Harry is up to something and Hermione wants to know what.
When she stumbles out of the Floo at Grimmauld, she doesn’t hear anything, which is unusual. Usually, Harry would be in the kitchen sipping tea, in the lounge reading a muggle newspaper. But Hermione is met with silence. She doesn’t think Harry’s actually sleeping, but she creeps into his bedroom to check.
Hermione Granger couldn't sleep. She had never been much of a sleeper. But now something in her best friend had changed- and she intended to know what it was. She was concerned, and hurt that Harry had never told them whatever was happening. But she was a clever witch- and she knew she could get to the bottom of this.
day we have our huge bloody staff meeting, where I meet the absolute Head of the company and get a chance to impress her, I show up
Hermione sends her magic leashing out, sensing for the pull of Harry’s magic. She can faintly feel it. So she harnesses whatever bit of his magic she can as she throws the powder down.
“Yes, Ronald.” Black eyes flash from beneath their lids, venom spilling from them. “When you both are widely known Slytherins accused of being on the wrong side of the war and betraying your country, you learn to stick together.”
Pansy approached, and nearly sobbed at what she saw. Draco was staring straight ahead, blinking only when necessary. He had made no move to even greet her, or to pull his eyes away from the far wall. Pansy could see fresh, dried tears on his face, and the sight was so unusual and heartbreaking that she fell to her knees right there. She reached out a hand to stroke the side of his face, cupping his cheek and turning him to face her.
She turns back around to see someone stopped outside her door. She's far enough away that it isn’t clear exactly who it is. She halts her steps and feels Ron stop beside her too.
Her office door is flung open. She doesn’t look up, she knows only one person dramatic enough to actually fling a door open.
Sheets neatly pulled over the corners, pillows organized and stacks, the spare blanket folded and draped across the foot of his bed.
“I think he’s just going to work early. That has to be it.” Ron says as they walk down the narrow Ministry hallways towards her office.
So she floo’s over to Harry’s, early in the morning or late at night. Time doesn't matter. But she has to see Harry, to show him this new spell combination she’s been working on.
Hermione has her doubts, but Pansy insisted. She had said they needed to talk it out, to reconcile, and Hermione gave in, sending Harry an invitation to Florean Fortescue’s, identical to the one Pansy sent Draco. The boys had met awkwardly, before taking a seat at the same table.
The plan as it stands is that he and Hermione will go ask Harry about the disappearances, and relay it all back to Pansy after. They have two theories, three with Pansy’s ridiculous Love Affair idea, but they’ve spent so many months on this that they just have to know. So they leave Hermione’s office (Their headquarters of sorts) on Thursday feeling confident.
Ron looks annoyed but tells Pansy everything he had told Hermione. She comes to the same conclusion that it
“Of course not. Potter doesn’t know me, doesn't know that I’m involved in any way,” Pansy says, looking at him like he's some sort of idiot. Which, he supposes, he just might be.
Ron’s so tired. He’s been sitting at the dining room table eating biscuits for the last half-hour, while Hermione tries explaining to his family what they’re working on.
He gets a glare. “Don’t you give me that, Weasley. Bloody Potter almost got me fired! I figured since the bastard always leaves at perfect four-fucking-thirty, I could just use my wand as my alarm.”
Standing in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place, Pansy pulls out her wand and transfigures her green robes into a tight black shirt and a plaid skirt.
Pansy doesn’t seem to notice. She just grins her wolfish smile and leans down to whisper in Hermione’s ear.
They walk around Diagon, solemn for their friends, for a love lost. By the time they circle back to Florean’s, they are so stuck in their grief that they pause at what they see.
“Believe it or not, they wouldn’t. The layering of the spells is too similar in purpose to be combined. The elements that make them up are so similar that half the time they end up repelling and creating an explosion. We tried that once and we ended up turning a witch invisible.”
She stumbles out of the floo and calls for Harry. She makes her way through the house, upstairs, downstairs.
Hermione weaves her way through the crowd, staying close to Ron and away from Harry. She had sent him a letter earlier, letting him know she had plans and couldn’t make it. However, they still needed to sneak in to meet up with Pansy, and if Harry found them it would all be over.
“No, you bumbling fool! Now he’ll know someone was here!” She looks livid, and Ron can feel his cheeks heating. Oh. Right.
“Because Harry’s clearly been there! One time he left his glasses, sometimes there’s water, and I don't think Kreacher would go this far to lie to me! Seems like a bit much doesn’t it?”
Draco turns his glare to Ron now. Ron feels like this isn’t right, and he’s so very, very confused. “No, wait. Harry told
- she guesses Draco’s been sleeping on the sofa. Which, why would he ever do that? He has a perfectly comfortable king-sized bed upstairs. Pansy knows, she used to come over shortly after the war, when they could not bear to sleep alone in their Manors.
Ron opens his eyes, and sees that Draco's cheek is a fiery red from where Pansy had slapped him. They should have hidden the evidence, he thinks. Though Harry sounded pretty calm, the way he holds himself screams anything but. His green eyes thunder behind his glasses. No one speaks. And then there was a scoff. From the only one who would dare. Draco bloody Malfoy. Harry looked at him, blinked, and then laughed. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled Harry close to him.
Draco breaks free and huffs, “I’m telling you it was difficult. I had finally freed myself from one secret, only to find myself flooded with many. In a way, Harry helped me relax– oh pish, not like that Weasley– so if anything I was grateful for it. As for keeping it secret… Well…” He looks to his mother, who is merely smiling at what she just discovered.
“You’d be surprised.” Harry murmured. Making up his mind, he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder calling his attention back. “I have something to tell you, but I’d rather it was somewhere private. Are you free?”
Flitwick opened the door for them to his office. The arrow was on the table, glowing in a way that was no longer appealing to Harry. Malfoy’s hand found Harry’s and he squeezed it tight. He suddenly started to hyperventilate. Each session had found him panicking, and there was yet to be some result.
Fortunately, Snape rushes his way in and casts the spell to heal him. Draco fades away into darkness and eases into sleep. So deeply he sleeps, that he manages to forget all that he remembers of him and the green-eyed boy of generations before.
Initially, the plan was supposed to be that they would go as friends. However, roughly two weeks ago, that all changed thanks to a loose stone protruding the ground.
Harry hadn’t heard him introduce himself, which meant Cally was familiar with him. And from the looks of it, Malfoy knew this place well.
“I’m glad you’re happy. But what happens if you’re suddenly struck with a new emotion when you least expect it? Isn’t it better that you have everything back when you expect it? At least this way it’s in a controlled environment? I mean, it’s up to you. If it were me, I’d feel like I was lying to myself in a way…”
Today was no different. He was cleaning up another messy room. Six years have passed and he figured it would finally be time to clean up Remus’ room. He had tackled Sirius’ room the other month, so saw this as progress as a step in the right direction.
The circle of tipsy teens jeered in glee. Question number one, and it was like this huh? Harry was probably the only one who cringed, not wanting to know the answer at all. He was perfectly fine being blind to whatever his best friends were up to. It was like knowing
She pursed her lips and tilted her head. It was obvious to her that Draco’s fond gaze was full of adoration for the boy below him. That may be because she had known him for nearly all her life. However, when she looked at Hermione’s knowing stare, she figured he pretty much became an open book when it came to Harry.
“Very well, Master Harry,” Kreacher snapped his fingers and vanished the dirty cup. No doubt returning it to its place in the cupboard, clean. Harry nodded to Kreacher and rushed upstairs to get ready.
“Draco... son. I need you to confirm something.” He looked at his father, his cheekbones prominent, eyelids tinted lavender, and hair stringy with grease. “Is this the Potter boy?”
Confused, Harry slowly starts to stand as well. The field around them transforms to the familiar Kings Cross station.
Draco continued on his rant, calling everyone names, cursing his father. He cursed the fates for dealing him with such a bad hand and kicked at the table some more. He shoved Harry away repeatedly, but he refused to budge. He promised to remain by Draco and he wanted to keep that promise.
Draco gave him a dubious look, but nodded, “okay.” He turned to the book and started at the top of the page.
“What’s so bad about being my love interest?” Malfoy asked, his voice small. He had taken to playing with Harry’s left hand with both of his.
Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, probably wondering why he was suddenly interested in his friends. Harry hadn’t paid attention to them before, in fact, right now he was looking at both of them. They were seated by the fire, talking with the other Slytherins.
“Narcissus is the scientific name of the daffodil. Then again, I can see the value of being named after such a flower. It represents renewal and strength. Something mother and I have been trying our best to do, as of late. She’s reached out to Aunt Andromeda. I’m sure you might’ve heard?”
Draco sucked the kebab sauce from his fingers and turned to Harry who was watching him fixated. “You’re the best flatmate ever,” Draco said, teasingly.
Feeling his shirt turning damp, Draco pulled Harry away slowly. His heart shuttered at seeing his happy Harry sad. “What’s the matter?” he asked, sitting up, pulling Harry with him.
? Pansy to his right squealed all of a sudden. The room took on a quiet and somewhat tense atmosphere. Draco looked up and jumped when he realised everyone was staring at him. What did he do? Was he talking out loud? His mother said he always talked when he was drunk, maybe that was it? No?
He quickly hung up. He was obviously joking, but Ginny sometimes never knew it. He’d rather prevent evoking her rage.
Harry snapped his fingers, “Soleil!” He looked at Draco and inspected him. Watching as he evaded Harry’s eyes. “...You called me...
Despite this, they do not care. Their eyes are light and bright. Their smiles warm and for each other.
He spotted Pansy laughing at something Ginny was telling her. Harry looked for an alternative, but Blaise wasn’t anywhere near, and Harry couldn’t wait much longer. He approached them, his confidence growing with each step.
They break apart, but can’t seem to stop themselves from giving each other quick pecks. Draco only stops when he can’t feel Harry’s lips, but instead his teeth. He opens his eyes and sees the most dazzling smile. He presses one final kiss to the corner of Harry’s mouth and backs away.
Harry stared out of his window, lost in his thoughts as he sipped his drink. He shook his head, hating how he was turning so maudlin. He was only twenty-three for Merlin’s sake. What business did he have acting in such a manner?
Harry’s rambling thoughts were broken when the man hiccoughed, giving away that he wasn’t as sober as he acted. It reminded Harry of what the man incorrectly said.
Draco’s eyes widened from shock. He covered his mouth as if to prevent more words from rushing out. But it was too late. He ran away. He was sick of that. Always running away. Why was it that Potter brought out the worst from him?
It wasn’t exactly like he was fully innocent in what happened. It all started because Harry couldn't keep to himself. But in Harry’s defence, when did he ignore Malfoy?
Hermione’s hand stopped moving, her the ink on her quill slowly dripping onto the parchment creating an inkblot that Harry knew she’d blame him for once she noticed.
He obambulated towards the door which wasn’t as packed as earlier with eager Freshies wanting to get their first taste of freedom. He ignored the bouncer’s farewell and trudged down the street. He took his phone out of his pocket and browsed through his Twitter feed as he walked, uncaring of who he bumped into. After all, he wasn’t the only one walking around aimlessly.
Draco coughs as he spits up red blood. The metallic taste is familiar. He remembers tasting it while a green-eyed hero clutches his body as his soul swiftly departs. It is not much different now, with
Harry nodded and was getting ready to put his shoes on so he could chase down Malfoy for hurting his friends. His movements stopped at Ron’s next words, however.
Harry grumbled to himself and crossed his arms over his chest in silent protest. He tried to ignore Malfoy’s hands that were caressing his hair. He tried to ignore the delight he could feel growing from the sensation. It wasn’t right for him to feel it, especially with what was wrong with Malfoy at the moment. It wouldn’t do any good.
“It’s just a few more days– er weeks– before it fades away Potter, do try and suck it up. I expected you to be used to the fawning, adoring fans.” Blaise smirked, earning a giggle from Hermione who quickly settled herself. That didn’t stop Harry’s pointed glare in her direction.
All too soon they were close to each other, close enough to smell each other’s cologne. A cologne that until recently Harry couldn’t get enough of. He smiled at Draco and reached out for his hand. He lifted Draco’s hand and kissed the back of it. He grinned when Draco realised the loophole he found and backed away, enjoying the groans of disappointment.
Harry watched Malfoy walk away. He finally let himself smile when Malfoy’s footsteps could no longer be heard. He pulled his walkman out and pressed play. Harry was going to reveal that he had heard everything, only Malfoy had retreated before he could. At least Harry knew Malfoy was being sincere. Six plus years of fighting wasn’t going to fade away like that. But if Malfoy was willing to try, then perhaps Harry should give him a chance.
There seems to be a disturbance among the crowd when she sees Narcissa trying to make her way through. She eventually squeezes through a gap big enough and rushes to Draco’s side. She pulls him into her arms, not ashamed to let her emotions show. After some hesitation, she extends one arm to Harry who doesn’t hesitate to join the hug. A soft whimper escapes Draco, and if Ron had the energy he would probably tease him about it. If anything, it just warms Ron more to Draco. To see him act human in such a way. He has so many questions. Yet, he’s all too aware of the curious stares in their direction and decides it’s probably best to wait.
Draco is leaning against the guest seat when Harry emerges. His eyes are red and tears are flowing down his cheeks. Draco cannot be blamed for rushing to his side and cradling his head into the space between his neck and shoulder.
“I didn’t expect it to feel like mine after you took control of it.” He sounds as if in awe, he casts a spell that cleans Harry’s face from mud and dry blood and smiles at Harry.
“You good?” Harry says, his lips brushing against the shell of Draco’s ear. He doesn’t speak, choosing instead to nod and take a deep breath.
The man is perfect. His tight curly hair is short and moves with the wind. He smiles down at Harry and moves so that Harry isn’t straining his neck any longer. He stares down at Harry for a few seconds before joining him on the grass. He rests his hands behind him, relaxes and sighs.
Harry guffaws into Draco’s shoulder, unable to stop himself at her expression of bewilderment. It isn’t often he can surprise her, “yes I did. Or tried to! He kept insisting my ideas were unnecessary!”
“Well,” Draco drawled, bringing their hands up and tracing the back of Harry’s knuckles against his lips, “there’s no stopping us now, is there?”
Mark looked over and saw a table of six people, two women and four men. Even from his distance, he could feel the foreboding. He could only imagine how bad it was for the ones sitting at the table. He thanked Samantha and walked over. It was drilled into the employees to inform the customers of a change in server. On his way, he noticed one of the men reach up to loosen the collar of his dress shirt.
Harry thought he looked quite pretty. His light blond hair suited him perfectly. Harry wondered if it was as soft as he thought it would be. He rubbed his fingers, sorely tempted to reach across and touch his hair. But that was impolite right? If he was a stranger, it would be
Ron coughs, uncomfortable all of a sudden, “despite what you may assume… you’ve made Harry the happiest I’ve ever seen him. I thought he was happy with Ginny, but that was merely puppy love. What he has with you– I can’t believe I’m saying it– what you have together? That’s true love that is. You don’t get that in every lifetime.”
“Mr Malfoy.” Slughorn greets him, his face void of emotion. “I am afraid, I have noticed your grades slipping. Now, as a student who was at the top for five years in a row, this is quite alarming. Is everything alright Mr Malfoy?”
Two more people joined them in their hidden circle, laughing at what they saw. Pansy and Ron was another friendship that Harry hadn’t expected. He supposed there’s an ironic symmetry to the trios. Hermione and Blaise as the intelligent, book-smart, friends, while Ron and Pansy were the strategic ones with a cunning kick. Harry hid a shudder since that meant he and Malfoy were the compatible ones.
“It goes back to the myth of Cupid. The arrow will be shot at the potential victim and whoever the victim eyes first will become the love interest. Cupid always shot the second person so the love was reciprocated. In this sense, with Eros’ arrow, you were the first to touch Mr Malfoy were you not?”
Harry wasn’t sure why he never noticed it before he saw the auras; the lingering hand on the back of a chair; the smitten looks when one wasn’t aware; the louder than expected laugh when one cracked a joke. Ron had absently commented on it one day which was when the epiphany hit Harry.
“My apologies professor. It seems sixth year is taking a toll on my academics. I believe I am not wholly properly prepared for the workload. I am working on it, however.” He keeps his expression blank. No sense in showing that he wants to scream for help, no one can help him.
Harry turns his stirring rod clockwise three more times before consulting the textbook by his side. The next steps were to let it simmer for three more minutes before letting it cool and adding in the bitter root to stabilise the bubbling that would surely appear. He pointedly ignores Hermione’s huffs and takes a seat, relaxing while his classmates are several steps behind him.
“Spend your time watching me Malfoy?” Harry grinned at Draco, but his smile slowly fell from his face at Draco’s stare. “Malfoy?” he questioned.
He turned the picture around, once more, and noticed the date on the top right. May 28 1979… Harry felt like smacking himself. All these years and he never knew the date his parents got married! He pulled his flip phone out of his back pocket and opened the calendar app. It was currently May 27, which meant the anniversary was tomorrow!
The silence between them was suddenly awkward. Harry would’ve apparated away if CCTV wasn’t a thing. He was starting to feel uncomfortable and his toes curled in his shoes.
“Look, telling us in confidence has got to be better than having people believe you murdered your mother,” Potter interjected.
“It eases your conscience.” Harry sounded understanding, and not like he was judging, even though he should have been the first one to do so.
and that the magic masked the fetching blush that the cold air would normally have brought to his face.
“You were driving yourself bonkers reading about everything that could go wrong,” Weasley protested and looked at Harry for support – and then even to Draco.
“Alright,” he said and pushed his notes to the side so she could come and look at them. She did so, tucking her chin-length black hair behind her ear as a look of concentration appeared on her face.
Draco froze. At first, he thought he had misheard. After nearly eight years of hurt and regret and  revenge, after so much wishful thinking over the scene on the train at the beginning of their first year, he could not actually be getting this. They weren't children any more, and those juvenile grudges had long since paled against the horrors of the war, but still, he had always assumed that... well.
Potter’s skin was covered in four colors of markings now – the mysterious writings in black, then dots for the blood antidote in red, and for the cell antidote in blue, and now the occasional, strategically placed X in green for the serum. It was by far the most complex detoxification he had ever attempted.
“Harry,” Draco said, patiently and…fondly? “You do realize that I hold your hand whenever we’re out somewhere together? And that I call you ‘love’ in front of all our friends? And that you’ve brought me to Weasley Family Dinner
For a moment, he wasn’t sure Granger had heard him. She was staring unblinkingly at a tree in the middle-distance, half obscured by the falling flakes.
Blaise rolled his eyes at that. "It works better if it's done carefully - lasts a bit longer - but I assume you lot actually want to drink them at some point."
used to that, but Potter was apparently an exception, just like he seemed to be in every other capacity. The silence seemed to buzz and crackle between them.
“So we’ll have to make sure she only knows after you’ve stopped com– ah, blast it, we can’t exactly give her a big long explanation of why, so she’s not likely to help us out, is she?”
He pressed his forehead against the cold window and tried to breathe deeply with his eyes squeezed shut.
Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes. His heart wasn’t in it, however – it was too busy screaming at him about what in Merlin’s name he’d been thinking, getting involved in this. If they were caught, he’d be in Azkaban before he could say ‘It’s all Potter’s fault.’
“Mrow,” Evadne confirmed. Her slightly moist nose tickled Harry as she touched it gently to the skin below his jaw. She sneezed.
Potter crossed his arms and, by the looks of it, would have kept arguing, but Granger talked before he could. “I wonder whether you knew you’d be travelling in time before it actually happened, or to which point you’d travel. Or if you knew you would lose your memory before the first time you travelled.”
It was covered in writing. Most of it, Draco couldn’t make out – his eyes seemed to slide away whenever he tried to focus on a specific spot. The Unspeakables had probably obscured it with a spell, deciding it was none of Draco’s business. But on the back of Potter’s hand, the black letters were large and clear.
“No, I…well, yes. Sorry, I don’t mean to dismiss what you’re telling me, but there’s just so much on my mind right now. I talked to Hermione.”
but she didn’t ask a single question about the seemingly shy young man who had come with Draco to take notes and assist with the interview.
“Voldemort tried to cheat death,” she said then, and it was only because of long months of purposefully done desensitization that Draco didn’t flinch. “So even if I could, even if I wanted to…if I did that to him, if I perverted everything Harry stood for because of some selfish desire to have him back, he would never, ever forgive it, or accept it. He’d kill me, and then probably himself out of principle.”
you owe me. I lulled you into a false sense of security and used it against you, like the Slytherin I am.”
There was a different sort of ripple in mid-air. A second later, Clearwater was standing there, looking displeased and pale and not at all like Draco had imagined their mysterious opponent.
“Not at all. Ha!” Draco couldn’t help the grin spreading across his face. “I sort of want to send Lyman Selwyn the memory of this. He’d drop dead.”
“Good,” Draco said softly. “I hope that will be enough.” He barely knew Susan Bones outside of school, but she did not deserve to get mixed up in this.
“Obviously I need to know what the poison is first of all,” Draco replied, and considered pinching the back of his own hand to jolt himself out of the fog of exhaustion that was closing in on him. “I have a few diagnostic spells I can cast on him as he is, but I’ll need a small skin sample, a blood sample, and a hair sample as well. If it’s a poison I’m familiar with, or even a combination of them, brewing an antidote should be fairly straightforward, although it depends some on how long the poison has been in his system. If it’s something I’ve never seen, or something botched…” Draco grimaced. “I can still do it, but I can’t predict how long it’ll take me, or what’s involved.”
“Maybe we should start celebrating birthdays in this department,” Granger sighed, “to remind us all how old we’re supposed to be.” She wrote something on her file and then closed it. “Sorry, Malfoy, you’ve been waiting. Did you need something?”
“Ah,” the woman said and nodded in matter-of-fact fashion. “Yes, that was me. Several of your colleagues already talked to me yesterday, you know. Asked rather invasive questions, too.”
Harry tried to jump up, but that didn’t work the way he had imagined because his arm had gotten caught on a root or something of the sort, and so instead he nearly wrenched his shoulder out of its socket. “Ahrg!” he yelled.
“Hermione!” he called, bursting into her office. Too late, it occurred to him how incredibly rude he was being…again. He should probably stop doing that.
“What complicates things is the fact that I don’t know if it was the poison that caused you to be unconscious when you came through the Veil. I’ll have to run some tests and equations later, when I’m back in the lab.”
“Bones said he wasn’t in the habit of carrying one. No reason he would have had one for this particular mission and not tell her. Besides, even if he’d had one, there were Anti-Apparition wards up, and I can’t think of another way he could have gotten past the Fiendfyre. Regular fire, maybe, but not this stuff.”
Potter jerks against Draco, just once, and Draco turns his head to whisper at him to calm down, but they’re too close and Potter’s cheek is right there, and Draco’s lips brush against it entirely by accident. Potter jerks again.
This one's a bit late. I know it happened right after a cliffhanger, and I apologize for torturing everyone, but I wanted to make sure that the plot of these next few chapters was well and truly polished and any small inconsistencies ironed out. A huge thank you once again to
“Draco, these are…” Blaise took an agitated breath and ran his hand through his hair. “There are exactly twelve of these in existence, and I keep a very close eye on them – because they’re ridiculously expensive and bloody tedious to produce, and also because they’ve got quite the potential for abuse. All twelve of them should be in the office Anton and I share. People can’t just come in and
“Brilliant. We got one from Charlotte Fletcher, so we can compare the two later.” Potter was silent for a beat and then, because he had no subtlety whatsoever, added, “Are things alright between the two of you, then?”
Draco shrugged. He couldn’t deny that it had been quite an interesting challenge, but when Granger had asked for a list of the potions Potter still needed and whether there was anything else she needed to know about the rest of the recovery process, he had realized that his time in the Department of Mysteries was at an end. There was no reason for him to stick around. Neither a healer nor a potioneer was needed any longer, and he couldn’t expect them to let him stay here for the fun of it. Besides, he had patients to get back to.
He found himself at the top of the astronomy tower, huddled into a corner, a bottle of firewhisky in one hand and a goblet in the other, because damn it, he still had a modicum of class left and wasn’t about to drink straight from the bottle. He poured himself more and raised his drink in a mock-toast before throwing back the vile liquid. Then he tilted his head back and looked at the stars, wishing himself among them like he had so many times during the war. It soothed him to imagine himself as his own constellation, seeing the world from so far up that all of his problems shrunk to complete insignificance.
Clearwater turned and bolted for the lift as Harry grabbed Draco’s wrist and pulled, and then they were running into one of the corridors.
“You took down the painting,” was the first thing that burst out of Harry as he entered Malfoy’s office, which…great. He had told himself that he simply wouldn’t acknowledge the artwork’s existence or that they had ever talked about it, and the first thing he’d done was
Draco recited and traced a careful squiggly spiral in the air, Harry’s way. He squinted as pinpricks of light appeared scattered across Harry’s body and then coalesced into a single, bright golden cluster in mid-air, hovering for a long moment as the spell translated the readings it had taken into numbers.
“Because you’ve got the observational power of a pumpkin, Harry. Also, you’re completely irrational when it comes to him.”
“Apparently, those need renewing anyway, because you shiver every time we walk around outside for longer than ten minutes,” Harry pointed out.
Harry gave a resigned nod. It was all the direct communication he felt capable of at the moment. All he wanted right now was some peace.
Granger’s warming charms were downright ridiculous, Draco decided. She’d only cast a single one, and it had him feeling cozy even after crouching on the frozen ground amidst wind and heavy snowfall for over ten minutes.
“I don’t know!” he exclaimed. “I don’t…how can we make ourselves figure out sooner that Clearwater did it?”
Harry took several slow steps toward the barrier. “Maybe you can tell us, Penelope? I know you’re standing right there, your glamour isn’t good enough to fool me, now that I know where to look.”
Draco walked past Blaise and dropped back onto the sofa. “What do you want me to say here, exactly? I don’t know how it happened. I don’t know who did it – not me or Potter, I can tell you that much.”
Potter sighed and rolled his shoulders, probably stiff from all the sitting. “That answer’s not so easy. Has to do with something that happened at the battle of Hogwarts.”
it’s well-distributed? I mean, it’s a complex poison, we know that much, but even a complex magical poison can’t be that self-aware.”
“Yes, Draco, a bit.” Potter rises from his chair and takes Draco’s hand, and for some reason it feels right, natural. Draco isn’t sure when that happened, but then, he’s been too busy investigating Bakewell tarts to pay attention. “Come on. Let’s find someone to tell us the truth of it.”
“Why in Merlin’s name does he even work here?” Draco asked as he began to inject the serum with care. “He’s utterly insufferable.”
Draco shook his head. No one but his parents knew – but his father was in Azkaban now, and he couldn't talk to his mother, not about this. Never about this.
“Come to join our study group?” Granger asks. “We can make space.” She signals to Blaise and Longbottom, who are sharing a book, and they start moving their chairs.
“Malfoy, you've got to eat. You've lost so much weight... your robes are hanging on you like...” Potter trailed off, frowned. “Is this about punishing yourself?”
There are more leaves in all sorts of deep, autumnal shades lying on top of the cake, made from gum paste. Kingsley cuts right through them so they can try a slice of carrot cake and walnut buttercream, which they end up loving. Harry can feel Malfoy practically vibrating with joy.
“Thought you’d finally decided to call me by my first name,” Harry pointed out, poking his head out of the door leading to the opposite corridor before Draco could get there. “You found something?”
Apparently, he sounded more upset than he meant to, because Draco turned around and gave him a smile. “It’s kind of sweet,” he said. “And I don’t plan on breaking your heart in any case.”
“Yes. It only lasts for about four and a half hours, but it creates such a nice atmosphere, don’t you think?” She smiled tenderly at the flames.
Selwyn sighed deeply, opened his mouth, closed it again, and let his shoulders slump. “Yes,” he said.
“You’ve got three minutes left on your shift, actually,” said Granger sweetly. “But I’m sure I can send out a Patronus and let her know you got tired early.”
“We’re with the Auror department,” Draco sort-of-kind-of confirmed. “Our apologies for waking you. This shouldn’t take long.”
After several minutes that felt like ages to Harry, he reached his destination. Twisting, he rammed his shoulder into the door to open it, resting Malfoy’s head in the crook of his neck to prevent it from bumping into something. Madam Pomfrey, having heard the door, was already hurrying toward them, horror on her face as she recognized the students - one, unconscious, pale, and covered in blood, being carried by the other.
Before he knows what’s happening, he feels himself being pushed into the closest wall, and a pair of deep green eyes are staring intently at him.
“I don't hate you either,” Potter said evenly, finally stopping his pacing and turning to Draco. “I used to think I did, but... the war put that into perspective for me. I already told you I don't want anyone suffering any more, and that includes you. I know you went through a lot in the war as well. I'm sure you have nightmares too. Has Madam Pomfrey forbidden you Dreamless Sleep yet? I can't take it any more.”
“And then what? You’ll stand around in the Realm of the Dead like you’re waiting for the bloody Knight Bus?”
They took a quiet, comfortable walk together, breathing the cold air and hearing the snow crunch beneath their shoes, getting snowflakes caught in their eyelashes. It was strange, Draco thought, how companionable this felt when their history with each other was so tumultuous and antagonistic. But he wasn’t keen on questioning it, so instead he decided to imitate Potter’s enjoyment of the weather and looked up into the sky, determined to feel the tingle of snowflakes melting on his tongue.
Draco made a grab for his water glass because his throat was suddenly bone-dry. He truly wished he’d never had that moment of realization the night before. It was messing with him something fierce.
“Well, Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle have always been a bit…over-eager,” Severus responded sardonically. “Still, don’t think for one moment that you can wriggle your way out of punishment. Your reckless behavior almost killed a student today.”
“I really am sorry,” Potter continued. “I had no idea it was all still so raw for you. I suppose I should have…I never really thought about it.”
“Well, she’s upset, and when she’s upset she likes to keep busy. Since she’s obviously not in the office, and there’s not a library down here to my knowledge, I’d guess in the Time Room, wherever that is from here.”
“Maybe it’s for the best. If I’m fired, I won’t have to worry about running into him in the lift or the cafeteria.”
“Right,” said Potter, who had apparently had an easier time getting it together. “I need to know all that you can tell us about the last dinner you had with your fiancé and Lady Selwyn.”
“Roll,” Goyle grunts, who seems to have forgotten he has a wand available, because he is busy whisking his egg whites into submission by hand. It’s quite the intimidating sight.
“Bit of experimenting for the shop,” Weasley told him. “Tried to spell them to form words when people first start eating them, but for some reason, the bloody things can’t tell the difference between eating and touching. Only ever got them to manage one letter, too – not exactly enough for some sort of festive message.”
He trailed off when he glanced up and saw Potter standing there, looking even more awkward than before.
“Well, yes. I had to get started on the antidote.” Draco was a bit concerned that Potter wasn’t showing more of a reaction to the news that the same poison had shown up elsewhere. It didn’t seem right.
Harry gave Draco a look that started speculative and turned sappy within seconds. “No,” he admitted.
“Right, I’m going to run up to Draco’s library and figure out if there are any spells for this sort of situation.”
“What happened between you and Harry?” she asked softly. “You spent so much time together, and now… now you look like you’re ill and he’s moody and irritable all the time. There is something not right, isn’t there?”
Draco cleared his throat. “Well, I…yes, I suppose. Mostly I want to check what condition your body is in after the detox, though.”
– else is. The poison is dormant in the blood until…until a certain thing happens, something external.”
“Don’t be stupid, he never comes in here!” Draco waved her off confidently. The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea. The painting would provide a much needed bright spot in his dull Ministry employee existence, and if there was ever someone he needed to unnerve – truth be told, there usually was – he would simply schedule a meeting in his office and let the painting take it from there.
Draco tied the scroll to a large, haughty-looking eagle owl and held out his arm invitingly. “We need you to fly slowly, and as low as possible, please,” he said.
“Christmas Eve,” Harry told him simply. “Nobody works late on Christmas Eve unless they absolutely have to.”
“She’s our most likely suspect then, yeah?” Draco frowned. “Still seems too simple though, blaming the foreign one.”
of people. We tested it once. All six of us together couldn’t do it. Draco, tell me where you found it.”
“At the top,” Ron picks up the thread, “resides the one and only Luna Lovegood, whose whimsical approach seems to be paying off. She is followed by the slayer of giant murder-snakes, Neville Longbottom.”
“Of course we’ll come along,” Harry said immediately. Draco found he didn’t mind him speaking for the both of them. “We can tell her about how no one else is in danger of getting poisoned.”
“Well, would you prefer blissful ignorance?” Potter snaps, which…is actually a good point, Draco has to admit. He can’t very well ignore the strange goings-on, not when every other Slytherin in his year seems to be involved.
The Death Eaters whom he’d been around so much after Voldemort’s return, the many Unforgivables they’d cast. Bellatrix, Crucio. Yaxley, Imperio. The Dark Lord, Avada Kedavra, again and again.
“And we can’t keep the stasis up for much longer anyway,” Blaise pointed out. “Not without pulling in more people, which I don’t think would be a good idea because we
“Malfoy,” someone called out. He tried to make himself smaller, but then there was a warm hand on his shoulder.
“Is any of it more information about what might have happened to cause him being poisoned?” Draco asked, not unreasonably, in his opinion.
“What?” was all Blaise asked. He sounded confused and, when Draco didn’t meet his eyes, turned to Potter for an answer.
“Yes, mate, you already said that,” Ron pointed out, his voice muffled by half a buttered scone that he was busy devouring.
Potter shrugged. “Just to teach him a lesson, really. Disarm him, shock him, beat him up…something like that.”
bloody hell, Draco was terrible at this - leaned forward, eyes sparkling with sudden curiosity. “Could you cast it?”
"Not quite, no," said Blaise. "It doesn't take any casting at all, just the combination of the magi-grown peppermint, the alcohol and the liqueur – has to be some kind of berry variety, else it’ll collapse immediately. Depending on the quality of the ingredients and the care with which you prepare it, the separation can last for quite some time.”
"Splendid," Blaise said as soon as they'd hurried over. “We received word from your lovely lab assistant Victoria –”
Weasley obviously didn’t know how to mind his own business, and Draco knew just how to make him regret it. “If you must know, I was remembering some good sex I had,” he informed him and leaned back casually.
“I will leave the cake semi-naked,” Draco says confidently. “Apparently, that’s a thing. Very modern, according to that one magazine Granger brought in.”
“So,” Draco says, rolling out the parchment and giving it a gentle prod with his wand to reveal the chart he has made. “This is the path the infection has taken, insofar as I could reconstruct it. I’ve been observing Daphne, but I still haven’t found evidence either way as to whether she has caught the insanity as well. She’s always been a bit shallow and ditzy, so sharing make-up tips with Patil doesn’t strike me as out of character.” He traces a question mark next to her name with his wand, and it glows into existence, Robin’s Egg blue. “I may need your help though. It is possible she’s suspecting me of being onto her and therefore more careful around me.”
“Much as I’d love to be the one working on a drinkable antidote, we both know that if anyone has a chance of puzzling it out, it’s you. Once we have that, investigating the poisonings won’t be nearly as dangerous as it is now.”
He said as much to Potter – not because it was relevant but because he needed a distraction to keep Potter from wondering why Draco had been so reserved and silent all morning. As he had hoped, it made Potter smile, and a nostalgic expression appeared on his face.
The woman who waited for him was pale, red-haired, and completely unfamiliar until he’d invited her into the lab for privacy, like she’d requested. By the time he’d closed the door and turned toward her, she had taken the glamour off.
“No,” Granger said softly. “No, I haven’t…he’s been so incredibly busy at the shop, and there’s nothing he can
“Oh, good,” Harry said as he walked out of it while carrying several medium-sized parcels in a wooden crate.
“Now this one is stunning,” says Kingsley. “Rustling leaves, pumpkins…can’t get any more autumn than that.”
“Hello,” said a young woman with pink hair and cheekbones that many would have killed for. She was holding the missive they had just sent, still sealed. “Um…how can I help?” She sounded confused.
“Don’t think so,” Potter said and tilted his head. “Marielle didn’t go to Hogwarts. And besides, red and gold are very Christmassy colours, so that’s probably why.”
“And yet they trust you to conduct interviews without Auror guidance or supervision,” she said, and then her eyes slid to Harry standing unobtrusively off to the side and she smiled in that knowing way again.
“By himself?” Draco scrubbed his palms across his face. “With nothing but – I presume – a hastily applied glamour between him and discovery? Merlin on a manticore, that man.”
Parvati broke off and stood abruptly, hands fisted. “If you’re about to make excuses, you can save it, Hermione.”
He was waiting for it to steep when the insistent knock on the door sounded. With an annoyed growl, he rose from his armchair, prepared to eviscerate whichever poor soul was rudely disturbing his hard-won peace. The words stuck in his throat, however, when he ripped open the door only to be faced with a familiar head of bushy hair.
But this time, Draco had to. He couldn’t talk about this. Just couldn’t. So he shook his head, frustrated, seeing the emotion mirrored in Harry’s features. Swallowing hard, he pulled away from the touch he craved.
At least eight house-elves turn his way. “Bakewell tart, Sir?” the tiniest one of them, who has the highest voice Draco has ever heard from anyone, asks.
“Oh, Merlin, no.” Harry wanted to cry. “Is it at least possible to obliviate oneself? Please tell me I can erase every fraction of memory of this incident from my mind.”
“I know,” Harry said. Then he bent down and kissed Draco’s neck, eliciting a sound of approval. “But maybe just…take a little while to relax first?”
“Has anyone done an autopsy to look where the poison damage is most concentrated? Even if it doesn’t change structure until it finds the correct cells, it wouldn’t have had enough time to distribute evenly in the blood, so there should be an accumulation somewhere downstream from the entry point, whether that’s an organ or an injury.”
The True Stasis spell cost more power to cast, needed an extremely skillful caster, and the mind needed to be sharply focused to keep it going. Draco didn’t even know the incantation for it. He was, however, willing to bet Smith had been switching off with another Unspeakable; there was no way he could have held the charm for more than an hour at a time, and that was a generous estimate on Draco’s part.
Even though he wasn’t the one supposed to be giving the commands, Harry obeyed him. There was so much heat all of a sudden as his cock slid out of Draco and then back in, so much friction and intensity. Skin dragged against skin; Harry’s fingers still hung onto him hard enough to bruise as he panted into the back of Draco’s shoulder. Draco put more tension into his body and pushed back to try and help, to make the incredible feeling even better. It had been so long, too long since he’d had Harry in any capacity at all, and now, to be at his mercy like this… he could barely breathe.
Hermione laughed, “Harry I know you just came out to us, but Ron and I are pretty sure we don’t want to share. We’ve discussed —”
It was currently free period between lunch and dinner and Harry had taken to the table near the bookshelf. He was observing Neville and Seamus’ interactions and almost squealed when their hands touched and it seemed like Neville chose to keep his hand in his grip rather than let go.
Hermione is now casting every diagnostic spell at his bed. Ron realizes this must look absurd to anyone else- but the two of them are Harry’s closest friends, and he’s never done anything like this before. It's something so uncharacteristic and sudden that they can't help but worry.
“It means we were together, Pansy.” His voice catches and his eyes water as he whispers, “and now we’re not.”
It’s just like yesterday. Except Harry’s bed is significantly more disheveled, and there's a glass of water on his nightstand.
After a few minutes of slow goodbyes and congratulations, the trio makes their way to the floo. Pansy is crying, Hermione is laughing, and Ron is just...really happy for his best mate. Hermione throws the floo powder down, clutches Ron’s hand in one of her own, and smiles.
“Left alone my fucking arse!” she yells, standing up. Her eyes flash a dangerous obsidian, warning Hermione in a way she's never seen.
“Curses when she’s mad, I reckon,” he whispers to Hermione. She just gives him a blank stare and reaches out to pat at Pansy’s head, which she’s buried in her arms.
be friends. You could die and you’d still be bound to me, I’ll even drag your dead corpse to Sunday brunch if I have too. And if you ever left me I’d hunt your new best friend and slice their throat slowly so I could watch them choke on their own blood and regrets.”
He can’t push down his unshakeable feeling that these two women together will be the undoing of them all.
’ calm that Ron had learned to fear over the years. Ron closes his eyes and holds his breath as he waits for Harry to speak.
“We’re so happy for you Harry. So, so happy. Next time you have an announcement, maybe don’t tell Ron first, though?” They both laugh, and Ron really can't be upset. Because his best mate is engaged.
He looks to Hermione, eyes wide. His own expression is reflected back at him, both of them clearly at a loss.
“Not the time for that! Ron, what were you saying?” Pansy thinks it's a little rude, but Ron seems concerned, so she lets it pass for now, vowing to fix it later.
After a quarter-hour of hugs and dismissals, Ron and Hermione make it back to their shared flat, a small one-bedroom with an open sitting room and kitchen.
“This wasn’t a random thing, Ron. According to the spell, none of these have been touched since yesterday morning. So he made it Friday morning and then left. But every time I come over, his bed is in disarray!”
She turns towards him for a brief second before turning away. She doesn’t reply, just makes her way up the stairs. Ron’s left trailing after her like some sort of puppy, which would annoy him if this wasn’t how it always went. Hermione marches up the stairs and heads straight to Harry’s bedroom. She reaches for the knob, but Ron's hand on her wrist stops her.
Pansy sits with Draco while he explains. She finds out that Draco’s shift goes from 18:00 to 04:25, and Harry would arrive at Draco’s at 4:30 every morning. She learns that he would sleep with Draco (“Actual sleeping Pans, actual sleeping.”) until 8, when Potter would make Draco breakfast and leave it on the counter, something Pansy finds equal parts disgusting and adorable. She learns that Potter would apparate to his home and
“Harry, no, we love you and support you no matter what,” she says, reaching for his hand. He looks up finally, eyes red-rimmed, shoulders slumped in defeat, but giving her a watery smile as he accepts her hand.
“Er, Parkinson, this isn’t a formal meeting,” Ron says. Hermione resists the urge to shoot him a look- they’re in the Ministry,
Ron and Hermione, fresh out of floo, had only taken two steps in before Kreacher had greeted them, arms crossed with a scowl.
“Thank you, Kreacher, I’ll be on my way.” Kreacher disappears with a bow, and Hermione makes her way over to the fireplace.
-illegally. He’s said to have escaped custody a few months ago. One of Harry's trainees died just last week from poisons, and Robards had me reopen his case, but no one has been assigned to it yet. Maybe Harry’s after him again.”
Ronald Weasley was stressed. He had just been assigned the Hertzoon case, but was so distracted by Harry's potential involvement that his progress was slow and minimal. His boss was going to have to sack him soon if he didn't get his act together.
“You’re saying the Ministry wants you to track Draco Malfoy,” Ginny says, narrowing her eyes. “Really?”
Hermione glances at him and he shrugs, because he doesn't need her help, per se, but Parkinson is not someone he wants to have as an enemy.
Jordie Hertzoon was free. The creep who had been showing up at his hideout for months had finally stopped, and he could use his lab again. He couldn’t wait to get back to work. He was going to make the whole bloody lot of them pay.
“Can’t we just...put it back?” As soon as he asks, he regrets it, because her glare becomes more intense.
She meets with Ron and Hermione, who agree that it is strange, three months after the whole catastrophe with Draco, for this to be happening again.
They end up in an unfamiliar living room. Hermione hopes she got it right. Ron and Pansy stumble out behind her, Ron landing in the ashes of the fireplace.
But after two years of Draco’s mysterious happiness, Pansy can't stop the flow of nervousness, the flow of fear that courses through her.
They can’t get a hold of Pansy on Friday, but they send her an owl asking her to meet them at Florean Fortescue's on Saturday.
“Doesn’t seem like Malfoy, ‘tis all,” he says, shrugging. Hermione agrees, but holds her tongue, Pansy's wrath is not something she needs right now.
The last thing Ron sees before whisking away is Harry and Draco, holding hands, staring at each other with so much love in their gazes that Ron thinks they just might explode.
“Malfoy? We don’t have much of a relationship, unless you count the times one of my students needs to be sent to St. Mungo’s. What are you on about, ‘Mione?”
So they sit for hours on the sofa, talking about Harry, about Pansy’s job at Witch Weekly, about Draco's work. And when the day turns to night, she walks him upstairs.
Which is how, the next week, the entirety of the Ministry (save a few Aurors and healers) are gathered for a Gala and Fundraiser.
“Have you tried just following him around? A few well cast Notice-Me-Nots and disillusionment charms would work, no?” Charlie asks.
Pansy walks down the Ministry hallway with as much confidence as she can muster, determined to keep the playful smirk on her lips, her chin up high.
They spent Saturday morning at his place and found the mystery that was his made bed, but hadn’t discussed it again until this morning. She knows Ron thinks he’s getting to work early, but honestly, it sounds so bland. Maybe she’s looking for excitement in Harry’s life to excite her own- but she really does feel like there's something bigger going on here.
Ron looks over at her, and she gives a slight shrug. If Pansy is seriously concerned about her friend, then they’ll help. Besides, Pansy Parkinson isn’t someone she wants on her bad side.
Gawain Robards found himself more curious. His trainer had been arriving to work on time recently. Curiosity was something a good Head Auror could not afford to have, he was to be focused on employee’s performance. If someone was suddenly doing their job, he had to appreciate that, and not wonder what had brought it on. But Robards couldn’t help but wonder why.
She doesn’t really know why she had gone to Weasley and Granger of all people. But they had agreed, and that was worth a lot.
“I'm sorry! I was just nervous, and I was scared so I tried to beat around the bush! And I was thinking that- Wait.” Ron is startled. Harry had just gone from pleading forgiveness to a steely calm. Ron lets go of Pansy, and she inches to stand between himself and Hermione. Draco is the only one unsettled, which,
“Jordie Hertzoon. A Potions Master from way back in the day. When Harry was still an Auror we caught him, it was his last case before leaving. He was in charge of an underground potions league, where they traded and made potions-
“I think you’d better tell me! Your house is empty, you say you aren’t dating Draco anymore yet both of you are
“Hertzoon", Ron says by way of greeting on Monday morning. Hermione looks up at the unfamiliar name.
Before Hermione can apologize, can process what just happened, Pansy slams the door shut, and storms away.
, he says, like he isn’t a perfectly well-mannered pureblood wizard. Draco Malfoy you tell me what‘s going on with you and Potter this instant I swear to Merlin-”
Hermione comes back the next day. She was planning on arriving earlier, but time is a construct, and really she was quite busy.
Pansy finds out that he and Harry had been dating for three years in secret. She’s about to demand to know why he didn't tell her, but he looks so devastated that she lets him continue.
As they stumble out of the floo at Grimmauld, like Hermione’s done so often, she’s overcome with how familiar and new it seems, all at once.
“You don’t get it.” She sticks her hand out, and Hermione gives her the Chair-Pen, as Ron calls it. Pansy sits in her chair, head resting against the back of the chair, eyes closed. “He normally talks to me every day. We floo call, he sends me an owl daily, but for the last week, I've gotten nothing.”
him, but she doesn’t think he needs that pressure. Right now he needs a friend to talk to, and so she’ll be there for him. Even if starting tomorrow they grow distant and he has his secrets again, she’ll be here for him now.
She casts the Notice-Me-Not Spells over all three of them, as they sit at a table a few spaces over from Harry and Draco’s.
“Master Harry has being left half an hour ago, Miss Granger. Should Kreacher be telling Master Harry you has come?”
Hermione and Ron reach the former’s office, and sitting on the desk, legs crossed, is one Pansy Parkinson.
Now he can see why Hermione is so determined to figure this out. He feels himself being sucked into the mystery as well.
, but ignores it in favor of staring at her friend. He looks up to her, pain etched on every one of his features. “Not anymore.”
“That’s...not a bad idea, Pansy.” It really isn’t, and with her status and connections to the minister, she’s sure she can pull it off.
down or my boss will have my head.” Pansy says, back in her reporter’s robes. “This was fun, thanks!”
Hermione looks closer, and yes, the short black hair, the not-so-subtle curves outlined in a barely passable reporter’s uniform, all of it screams Pansy Parkinson. As they approach, they meet her cold gaze. Hermione opens her office door for Ron to walk through. After he passes, she keeps the door open and nods, which Pansy takes as an invitation to step inside. Hermione is confused, but intrigued, so she takes a moment to gather herself outside before entering her office and locking the door behind her.
At first, no one talks. Then Harry is yelling, and then Draco is yelling, and they're both crying. Hermione grabs her two friends and leaves, not before throwing a hasty Silencing charm over the table with the two boys. If they notice it, they give no indication.
“Anyway,” Ron says, shoving the last of his biscuit into his mouth and standing up, “We should probably head out. Dinner was great, thanks.”
Ron smiles at her, because her confidence is one of the best things in the world. Ron agrees to buy Pansy’s dessert, if only to put her in a better mood.
“Weasley can stay.” Pansy interrupts, approaching the desk. She reaches across and grabs a pen out of Hermione's breast pocket. Hermione is about to ask what in Merlin's name she’s doing, when Pansy holds out a hand and wandleslly transfigures the pen into a lavish chair. Ron openly gapes as Pansy delicately drapes herself across it, legs crossed, back straight as an arrow.
“At 4:30 in the morning? Seems unlikely.” Hermione says. What would Harry and this lover even be doing so early?
Draco is happy, yes, but he hasn’t told Pansy anything about it. His happiness is like a secret, and it hurts her to know there is something that he can’t share with her. Maybe Pansy had hoped that the closeness developed in their 8th year, the two of them against the world, would stay. It was silly, she thinks, because it had.
The duo grumbles, but eventually they end up putting wards around Harry’s floo. Hermione sets up an alarm spell of sorts, one that alerts each of them when Harry uses his floo. Pansy asks if they can track where he’s going, but Hermione doesn’t think there's a spell combination for floo travel tracking, so they stick with the alerts sent to their wands.
Hermione doesn’t sleep either, but that's because her brain is always running. There's always more to do, more to see, more to know. And Hermione lives for it.
“Oh!” Pansy says, shooting out of her chair and beginning to pace across the room. “Set up a Ministry event. A gala, a fundraiser, whatever. Make sure all departments have to attend, including Potter. What does he do here, again?”
Ron is beyond confused. He’s terrified. He’s known Harry since he was eleven, has slept in the same dormitory as him for 7 years, slept in a tent with him for a horrible string of months. And never once has Ron seen Harry’s bed made.
“Is this the whole Draco being happy, except different? Because honestly Pansy, he might just want to be left alone-”
Kreacher pops into the kitchen with a crack and stares at Hermione. “Kreacher, where’s Harry? Why isn’t he here?”
Draco Malfoy woke up. There was no breakfast for him. He looked at the spot on the counter, where the food always lay. He stared at the blank space on his counter, in his heart, and collapsed to his knees in devastated sobs.
Pansy had gotten up from Hermione’s desk, long hair swishing behind her, and made her way towards the door. At Hermione’s question, she looks back and throws one smirk over her shoulder before making her way out.
“He was such an idiot, taking every precaution to protect me, Pans. It’s his bloody hero-complex, I'm telling you.”
“Don't you think we should cast some sort of protection charm? We never know what could be in there.”
It’s like deja-vu when Hermione reaches her hand out across the desk and Parkinson accepts it with a sly smile.
“Psst, Hermione!” She turns to see a black-haired woman coming towards them, fitted in Witch Weekley’s signature green robes. They catch up to her, and see her sporting a broad, fake smile.
“Let's go over,” Ron repeats. “To Harry’s. Tomorrow morning. It’s a Saturday. You haven’t checked weekends, have you?”
“Then we can see if he still leaves on weekends,” Ron says, licking his fingers clean. “And pass me another biscuit, will you?”
Ron rolls his eyes. Hermione works as a spell-maker full time, she knows everything about every spell.
“Sounds to me like an okay life,” Pansy says, with a smile. Ron smiles back, and Hermione thinks they just might be onto the beginnings of a friendship.
“No, Granger. You don’t understand. Draco seems…” she looks around as if checking for other people before she leans in and whispers, “
Harry smiles at Ron too. For a moment it’s like when they were younger, just the three of them against the world.
to work. Apparently, Potter didn’t want the ministry knowing he came from Draco’s in the mornings, lest they track him back there and hurt Draco.
Hermione doesn’t give him the satisfaction of an answer. Simply walks over to the floo, expecting them both to follow.
Ron’s seated on the edge of her desk, so Hermione goes around to her chair. She unfastens her coat and drapes it on the chair before sitting.
Ron is taken aback. He’s never seen or heard Pansy Parkinson thank anyone for anything. He gives her a tight smile and moves to stand up.
“Harry. Why are you still denying it? Pansy talked to Draco. We know about your relationship. We know that you and Draco have been dating for 3 years, that every morning you floo over to his flat and spend the morning with him. We know that you make him breakfast before going to work- come on, Harry. We know everything.”
He looks to his mother and judging by her stern look, she knows exactly what he’s doing. Ron would feel bad, but they’ve been discussing the whole Malfoy thing for far too long, and Ginny clearly isn’t buying it.
Pansy looks at him and then laughs. She visibly relaxes in her chair, slouching just a bit, resting her elbow on the arm of the chair, and leaning her head into it.
Kreacher gives a slight nod and vanishes. Ron sighs. Bloody house-elf. He makes sure not to let his annoyance show, because Merlin knows Hermione would hex him for it.
“It’s not unlikely,” Hermione says. She thinks. It’s definitely something Harry would do, even if he left the Field Aurors two years ago in favor of becoming an Instructor. Harry is one of those people who will always go after the bad guy, will always put everything aside to get revenge, justice for someone he loves. If Ron’s right and one of Harry’s trainees died- then going after Hertzoon seems like a logical choice, at least for Harry.
Hermione nods her thanks to the elf before he disappears with a crack. The three of them run up to Harry’s room, and see the bed as messy as it normally is.
“Yes. Well, modified of course. I think if I could break down the layers of a tracking charm and a magical use detection spell, then maybe. I think the components of the two charms are compatible. Something that shows us where he goes instead of what he does.”
Hermione, startled, checks the clock again. 4:40. So Harry is leaving at 4:30. She nods to Kreacher, not even bothering to reply, and floo’s home.
Because of Harry and Draco’s relationship, and her bond with the Gryffindor lovers, they find themselves hanging out together a lot more often.
She stands, catches the devastation in his gaze when she lets go of his hand, and takes a step backward. She removes her shoes, before flinging herself onto the couch on top of him. His protests are lost in his quiet laughter, and it thrills her to know that maybe they are still friends, maybe they are okay.She scoops him up into a crushing hug, and lets him cry into her shoulder.
“He’s a part of this too, Harry,” she says, before Harry can get too far. She gestures to the other chair, and Harry sits. Hermione was hoping that Ron would start the conversation when really, she should have known he wouldn’t, so after too long of a silence she speaks up.
“Oh honestly, Ron,” Hermione grumbles as she pulls out her wand. Ron tries not to take offense, because he’s an Auror, of course he's going to be thinking about safety. He casts a solid
around them both and follows Hermione into Harry’s room. What they see there makes them both stop dead in their tracks.
Ron’s about to lose his temper here. “Nothing. We put the trace on him for a full week and a half, and he didn’t go anywhere besides his flat, St. Mungo’s, and the occasional trip to Diagon.”
Ron knows he's covered in soot from when he slipped in the floo, and he’s holding back one red-faced Pansy Parkinson, who is still trying to launch herself at her friend. Draco is cupping his cheek where Pansy had slapped him. And Ron feels more than sees Hermione behind him, smug expression all over her face.
After having Ron test it by flooing to their flat and back, Pansy apparates them all back to the gala.
At this point, she seems to be having a debate with herself more than talking to them. Ron glances over at Hermione, and it appears as though she’s as lost as he is, a rare occurrence.
Ron sighs. But Hermione summons the House-elf anyway. Kreacher snaps his fingers, and all the blankets return to their place. Hermione smiles brightly and thanks him, but Ron just scowls, removing the protection spell from himself and not Hermione.
It's early. Hermione knows it’s early, but she also knows it doesn't matter. It’s not like Harry sleeps, anyway. Years since they used to camp in the woods on unreliable schedules, and Harry still rarely sleeps. He says that his dreams haunt him.
A white silk blanket lay on the lavish sofa, with three velvet pillows leaning against one of the arms. It’s already very perplexing, but what makes her stop in her tracks is the white-blonde hair peeking out from under the blanket.
“Wait. You didn’t tell them?” Draco asks, looking at Harry. “You told me you were going to floo Ron and tell him-”
“I just-” Hermione cuts herself off with a cough and continues reading. “This is a huge list, and clearly we can’t narrow down suspects from this. You said he’s acting happy? So why are you coming to us? If Draco is happy let him be.”
Ron walks over to the bed. He throws a few pillows on the ground, pulls the sheets off, and unfolds the throw blanket, before hurling it onto the bed in the most carefree way he can manage.
Ron is already sitting in one of the chairs in front of Hermione’s desk, as they both wait for Harry to join them. Hermione had sent him a Patronus earlier, hoping that it had come off as friendly and not confrontational.
She misses this, misses being so close, so comfortable to him. She misses the nights where they could visit because they could, not because they had to. She wants to tell Draco she misses him, she
Harry turned to Draco, his eyes wide. Draco wasn’t exactly quiet, and some heads had turned to look at the pair. “You little shit, shut up!”
She let out a sound of excitement as her eyes scanned through the pages, “how big is this bouquet going to be? Because I’ve just started training last month and would be so grateful if you’d let me do this.”
He didn’t stop at feeding Harry, sometimes he would follow Harry, forgetting his class schedule until Harry promised to stay where he was and wait for Malfoy to come back. The biggest request Malfoy made was for Harry to call him Draco,
He heard a street performer play the saxophone to his left. The jazz music, along with the busy steps of businessmen and women walking past him created a picturesque environment. He enjoyed how he was being ignored. He closed his eyes and enjoyed the performance. He made a note to remember to give the performer a few of his leftover notes before he left.
Draco followed behind silently, thinking things could have gone worse, but at least he’s a step closer to forgiveness. And that’s all he was after. Potter turned, making sure Draco was still following him. He probably didn’t like how slow Draco was going as he reached for Draco and tugged on his sleeve. The whole time, he hadn’t let go.
“Well, it’s just some things you talk about as a couple…” Ron’s ears were turning a bright red, and if he was brave enough to face Harry, he’d know for sure the rest of his face matched his hair.
Draco and Harry linked hands and Harry leaned his head onto Draco’s shoulder. Mark walked off. It seemed as if things weren’t going to escalate if Ron’s sigh of acceptance meant anything. The tension earlier had crumbled and he could feel the group’s slow acceptance of the couple. He caught Mikey’s eye and gave him a thumbs up.
Harry let out an almost hysterical laugh, “of course I do. I’m just a bit shy about it and haven’t told anyone. So if possible, could you drop it and answer my question?” he leaned away from Draco. Better to keep the distance between them, so he could think.
“I have no clue. I was gonna take you to Madame Pomfrey, but if you wanted to go alone–” Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hand, “–okay, let’s go then?”
Draco shoved Harry aside and took a seat in the space cleared. “I’ve been thinking I should stay here for Christmas…”
That seemed to startle Potter, whose grip on the cube loosened slightly. His jaw opened, mouth agape. Draco smirked.
things. Harry tried to push Malfoy off him, but that seemed to make his grip tighter. You don’t take away a child’s favourite toy from a child, and it just so happened that for some reason,
He felt the man stiffen and smirked, “you know I meant sun, as in the giant ball of gas in the sky. Not son as in offspring. Merlin, you sure do like misunderstanding me don’t you?”
Harry hums, looking into the distance. The earlier mirth in his eyes slowly dying down and fading away. “Who would’ve thought that they were like that…”
It was finally December and the holidays were fast approaching. Harry tapped his feet to the intro of Will Smith’s
Harry feels the boy sat across from his stare. His eyes are bright, clear, and flashing a cold silver. He shivers as if feeling it sink into his bones, crawling up his spine. He’s no stranger to that kind of glare. However, he remembers how proud those eyes were upon introducing himself as
One Saturday afternoon found Harry and Draco alone in the common room. Everyone had taken advantage of having a free weekend by visiting Hogsmeade, and those with licenses even Apparated to Diagon Alley.
Harry is trying not to be obvious, but Ron can tell that he is looking for something. He takes Hermione’s hand and guides her to Harry. She notices him searching the crowd and asks if they can help him with what he needs to find.
The greatest difference that week was Draco’s silence. He still accompanied Harry around, but he was a lot more reflective. He would grab Harry’s wrist whenever Harry needed to go somewhere, and seemed more conscious of his actions. Where he kissed Harry’s cheek before, he would instead lean into Harry’s side and just wrap his closest hand around Harry’s wrist. Harry wasn’t sure which one he preferred more.
Seamus only snorted, “I have plenty more should we need it –get off me you heavy shit – but it’s only day two Harry. Neville for fuck’s sake!” He was currently underneath Neville who was sitting on his back, digging his elbow between Seamus’ shoulder blades, in a sort of painful massage. Neville only laughed more.
“Shut up,” Harry interrupts, hating how small Draco starts to appear. Before he can shrink into himself further, he pulls Draco back. “I’m sure we can work something out. Don’t give up before you’ve even tried. I thought you were better than that. You should have seen your way wasn’t working out, you should’ve tried every avenue and conclude that your mission was pointless. Voldemort is afraid of Dumbledore. Why would he task you with this? He knows you’re going to kill yourself trying, or die not doing it. Why not pull the rug from beneath him and defy him when he least expects it?”
He was so absorbed in the love beginning before him that he hadn’t noticed someone sat next to him until he heard the familiar drawl.
Harry tried to push himself away, but Malfoy seemed stronger and wouldn’t let him budge. He ignored the feeling of Malfoy’s smiling cheeks against his.
Harry nodded blankly and turned to Draco. His drunk smile grew when they locked eyes. Mark felt the need to check his molars for cavities. The love practically glowed between the two of them. It was so sickly sweet.
Later in the evening, Harry and Draco were lying down in Harry’s bed. Draco’s hand was carefully untangling Harry’s curls. Harry had long ago given up telling him how futile the task was. By the time he would turn over, more tangles would appear. He suspected Draco secretly loved them and couldn’t get enough from touching his hair. Of course, in the time they’d been together, he hadn’t said anything. Draco being Draco would only stop doing it, and Harry loved the feeling too much to lose it.
Harry’s stomach warmed when he heard Malfoy’s light laughter. He recognised the signs and hated himself for it. Of course, it couldn’t be helped. Malfoy grew into himself and sounded more confident. Who wouldn’t feel flustered when confronted with such a gorgeous man?
“Are you still seeing someone?” Malfoy has asked, eyes focused on his cup. As if it held all the secrets of the world.
Harry grunts when Ron’s arms wrap around him, he stops himself from keeping his cries in when he feels Ron’s shoulders shaking around him. After the excitement of spells being cast in every direction, it feels too quiet. There’s a ringing in his ears and he feels… Empty, thirsty, his ears ache — scratch that, everything is aching. Everything is too silent. Until it isn’t. Cheering from everyone wakes his ears up again and he finds himself tightening his arms around Ron. He still feels numb from the Avada. His fingers are the first to start warming up in the wake of the heat from the spells cast.
Still, Harry liked his ordinary days when he could get them. An ordinary day meant waking up whenever he wanted, eating whatever he wanted, and doing whatever he wanted. Most of the time, he would stick to the Muggle boroughs near his renovated home, Grimmauld Place.
He could stay and be at peace. He could reunite with his family! He closes his eyes and can almost hear Sirius’ and his dad’s laughter. He can smell that flowery scent that he
Ron snorted into his hand, “sorry mate. I could’ve told you that ages ago. We’ve known for quite some time.” He pulled his legs up on the couch and stretched across, appearing comfortable for once since the end of the war.
was the apparent term, and when Harry looked it up in the dictionary he almost cried. Pimp? That’s what he’d become?
With that in mind, he got ready for bed. It was nearing midnight, and if he wanted to be well-rested, sleep would be the way to do. Providing he didn’t wake up with night terrors again.
Harry looked up and was surprised to see that his irises were no longer that bright red. Rather they were back to the pink shade they were earlier in the day. Harry didn’t want to think too deeply about why that made him happy.
Harry quickly intervenes, “now wait a second. He knew and probably knew what was happening with your family. Rather than force you to stop and hurt your–”
Draco nods, despite knowing Harry can’t see it. “Childhood in pureblood families are free. It isn’t until one starts Hogwarts that you are told to control yourself. Maybe it was too much for Sirius hence why he welcomed the new house and new people? I don’t know…”
“You’re a lifesaver. Please,” Harry made grabbing motions with his hands and smiled at Draco once he gave it to him. He took a sip and sighed in pleasure. The heat was already distracting him from the dancing pixies in his brain, “Merlin, why did I drink so much last night?”
Mark looked back at the table, they still weren’t talking to each other. “I’m not exactly sure, but the blond and the curly-haired man appear to be dating. They seem to have decided to come out to the other four during this meal.”
The following day, Harry woke up bright and early at eleven in the morning. At least, earlier than his usual so he took that as a win. He headed downstairs where he walked past Kreacher who was wiping down the windows for the french doors that opened to a conservatory.
Draco turned to Harry and raised an eyebrow, “why you’ve been playing Cupid. It’s cute, really, but why do you waste your time on fleeting school romances?”
Harry gaped, causing Draco to laugh. To see him so shocked amused Draco so much that he couldn’t help but to laugh.
Harry lifted his free hand and traced Draco’s cheek. He brushed back some of the blond hair that had fallen onto his forehead behind his ear. At Draco’s gasp, he looked back into Draco’s eyes. The silence in the room was slowly killing Harry. He needed Draco to say something,
, and yet, Draco still hadn’t achieved what he wanted. Needed. Semantics. He was getting impatient, which was unusual for him. He was the paragon of patience. A master in the skill. So patient, he was. As patient as–
Harry straightened up and looked to Flitwick, he ignored the knowing smile on Pansy’s face and the rush of heat in his cheeks. It was
Harry hides his smirk, refusing to leave Draco alone and instead tongues at the lovebite he left last night, taking pleasure at the soft whimpers Draco exhales. He can’t help but to suck another one and leans back to admire his handiwork.
“Why do you think you’re losing your mind?” Hermione appeared to not be truly concerned, she was focused on the patterns on Ron’s sock, tracing every black stripe.
Harry gulped and took hold of Malfoy’s shoulders, he hesitated before he spoke. Coming to a decision he looked into Malfoy’s light pink eyes, “Draco.” Malfoy smiled at his name being uttered. “I understand how much it hurts, but it isn’t smart to ignore the bad things. It’ll only hurt you in the end. Wouldn’t it feel better if you welcomed it bit by bit, rather than getting bombarded by an onslaught at once?” This wasn’t the first time he tried comforting Malfoy.
He dismisses them, not wanting to be distracted by his mission. They’re obviously not talking about him, with his hair as dark as the shadows that surround him.
Neville’s voice brought their attention to him, “I sometimes feel like I’m still recovering from my hangover.” He peeked beneath his fringe and smiled at them, “Hey everyone.”
Harry took his wand out and looked for any traces of magic residue on Ron. Sadly, the only thing he could find was a cleaning charm, no doubt for his constant messiness. Or at least, Harry hoped it was.
The room was dark and soundproof. You couldn’t hear the shouting of excited students from the outside, nor could you hear whatever went on inside. No one but the two of them knew about this room. Especially what happened inside. They didn’t meet often, only whenever they agreed through hidden gestures. The last meeting was only two days ago, however. It seemed as if the gaps between their meetings were too long now.
He held onto his wrist; lost in his memories. He could still feel the phantom hand gripping it tightly enough to bruise. It took forever for the bruises to fade. He had such pale skin, you see.
Draco side-eyed Potter, and from his smirk he realised what Potter was talking about. He felt a sudden rage take over him, which gave him the power to turn to Potter and shove at his shoulder until he was against the wall. He towered over Potter and glared, he could feel his cheeks warm in embarrassment.
Harry thanked him and sank into his regular seat. He pulled the coffee mug toward him and sipped. His fixed his glasses onto his face and blinked slowly as the world returned to focus. He sat in silence and waited for the caffeine to energise him.
Neville poked Harry in the ribs, jolting him out of the staring contest him and Draco seemed to have taken part in. “Mate, are you gonna take it or back out?”
Draco huffed and pushed against his forehead, “your breath stinks, Potter. I have a spare toothbrush ready. For the love of Merlin, go freshen up before you even think about talking to me.”
For example, right now. It is one of the rare times they find themselves free from class and from friends. During their break before dinner, they found a hidden alcove and did what they fancied for the day. Today just so happened to be Harry’s to decide. Which was devour Draco in any way until he was incoherent. But Draco could never let Harry take charge for long. He grabs Harry’s chin and plants a kiss. A kiss he’s been waiting since breakfast for.
Draco starts. No one is supposed to notice. He is supposed to be discreet. Cunning. Sly. Undetected.
Apollo looks up and watches as a bird takes flight in the air. He nods quietly, and sighs. “He had moments of recollection, but we erased it from his mind to ensure Voldemort remains unaware. I am to understand that your magic offers telepathy?”
, so it’s acceptable to reward himself with some wonderful chocolate cupcakes. Plural. He’s had four so far, and the end is not in sight. The icing on this one is just right in terms of texture and taste; not too sweet and not too soft. That little layer of crust added to the sensations. And once he gets into the cake itself,
Harry knew that Hermione had been talking with Pansy about him, but he decided not to go there. What’s done was done. It was time to move on, to move forward.
The two brew in silence as the room starts to take a heavenly smell. Harry shakes his head to clear himself of the fumes. Draco too starts to become delirious, smiling as he writes down the different scents he can deduce. Harry hums to himself as he leans over the cauldron and takes a whiff. Pure, concentrated Amortentia is so euphoric! Harry grins over at Draco who mirrors him.
Draco hides his smile behind the cup, “I’m sorry you were misled. It’s better you find out now rather than later.”
“How?” his broken voice echoed into the room, “how can you? I was horrible, I did terrible terrible things to people who didn’t deserve them. I was an utter piece of trash, no, piece of shit. I am waste. I am lower than dirt. I shouldn’t be here, I shouldn’t be welcomed.”
A common occurrence in the shared area for the Eighth years was the sight of Harry and Draco playfully wrestling on the couch. Laughing together, with insults being called out fondly as if they were pet names.
Draco exchanges a look with Ron. They somehow decided to forego their impending argument to focus on calming Harry down. By the time they do, it is already dark outside.
Draco’s lips pursed together, “no. Nothing of concern to you. I best be going. Good talk Potter. Bye.”
. Draco inhales, and under the smells of burnt wood and sweat, he smells the familiar hint of sandalwood and a fruity scent that he just yet cannot place.
Draco smiled down at the music player and pushed the earbuds in with practised ease. Harry had taken to any music style like a dog with a bone. Excited and eager, the only difference was that he wanted to share it with everyone he could trap.
