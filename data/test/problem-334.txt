Harry supposed he should have been more wary of their motives, showing up at his door all out of the blue. Yet, as he saw the desperation in Narcissa’s eyes, he was reminded of a kinder woman, who kissed and looked at her son like he was the brightest star in her world, who rolled up her sleeves and baked cookies with her sister for children she did not know, who kept them well-fed and watered when they were buried in Horcrux research. There came a compulsion to show said woman kindness, and so he stepped aside and let them in. He showed them into the small living room with his cluttered things and mismatched furniture, as if daring them to make a comment. Surprisingly, none came. He watched with apprehension as the Malfoys seated themselves on his creaking sofa and swept their eyes all over the room in fascination. He watched as their eyes lingered on the jar of Blood Quills on the coffee table, on the stack of books for his Potions course at the Auror Academy, on various knick-knacks scattered here and there. Then Narcissa’s eyes fell upon the painting hanging over the mantelpiece. Without looking away, she blindly grasped for her husband’s hand.
For one moment, Harry's heart came to a stop James' words. Then, realising how ridiculous and paranoid he was being, Harry shook his head.
Harry slowly turned to face his son, processing the words his son had just said.
Then she placed a single blooming sunflower on the grave, and walked away.
“We come bearing no ill will, Mr Potter. We just want to talk.”
“But it's still too bad we didn't know about him before. How come no one tells us stories about him? I've heard lots about grandma Ginny and grandpa Harry, how come there are no stories about grandpa Draco?”
Poor, ill-fated Ginny who could never have a child of her own.
“You’re not going to stop are you?”
In the end, neither Muggle nor magical means could forever prolong Ginny's life. Her weak body finally gave up half a decade later, just a few days after James' 5
“Males can't get pregnant!”
Days later, when Edward stood in front of a freshly-dug grave, nestled between other lily-covered tombstones, he spoke of a man with a brave and kind heart, who never had a family but loved his friends’ children as if they were his own, who worked tirelessly for the good of everyone, wizards and witches and Muggles alike. He spoke of fond childhood memories of trips to the zoo, to museums and galleries, of impromptu Quiddich matches and of stargazing nights. He spoke of the man’s parting moments, eyes closed with a smile on his face, surrounded by comfort and the things he loved.
In reality, Father said a lot more on
"Wouldn't patient confidentiality prevent them from doing any of this in the first place, or an Unbreakable Vow? Surely there are ways to keep this hushed up."
“Just a couple of white lies to make the story more interesting. It's not like it could hurt anybody.”
“I'm not sure about Muggles but wizards can get pregnant. It would require fertility potions, but it can happen.”
It went something like this.
James was suddenly leaning towards him and stared at him straight in the eyes. Harry flinched, seeing his own son so threatening.
“He didn't even know you existed, James!”
Later, he abstractly watched their interaction in the train carriage as it unfolded, as if looking in through a fogged window. As he saw Potter turning away towards his supposedly chosen friends, he did feel a twinge of regret. He wanted to say that he was sorry, that he only wished to make himself acquainted to the boy. But something tied his tongue.
It was now hung above his mantelpiece, side-by-side a wall full of paintings, frame after frame covering the expanse of the dimly-lit wall, mostly replicas, but some were rare originals, obtained with the kind of effort that he would not normally spare for such a frivolous pursuit. Ron told him that it looked like tributes in a tomb, the kind of treasure hoard that Purebloods left alongside their dead ancestors in their pompous crypts. Hermione, knowing that he did not care for materialistic values, tried to reason that he must have had something to prove with his collection.
The meeting, strangely enough, only consisted of James, a law assistant as the witness and the solicitor himself, a methodical-looking man with peppered grey hair and discretion imprinted on his very aura. The will was short and straight to the point, stating that since Draco Malfoy was the last Lord without a legal heir, he was free to choose whomever he wished to inherit the Malfoy fortune. Such chosen person was to be Mr. James Sirius Potter and any children he may bear. The inheritance consisted of vaults in Gringotts and many estates, including the Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire. He may or may not wish to keep the Lord title, which obviously was of no concern to the previous Lord. The will seemed legit and the paperworks all looked legal. It did not seem to be a bad joke or a trap of any kind, James concluded when he read through the papers. What puzzled him beyond all else, as well as the reason he asked for more time to decide on the matter, was the motive of this all. Why did Draco Malfoy choose him as his heir? It was not explained in the will and the solicitor, when asked, gave no opinion of his own, years of working for ancient pureblood families had proven that it was not his place to question the clients' wishes.
“I caught him staring at me no less than five times today. Rather unsubtle, too. Like he wants something from me.”
Suddenly Harry's phone rang, the sound bounced off the closed room and startled all three of them. The baby wailed at the intrusion and Harry retracted his arm, looking somewhat uncomfortable. He sent glances at both Malfoy and the child, then down at his vibrating pocket.
Dinner was a strange affair. On the surface, it was no different from any weekly dinner Harry had with his son's family. Diane's roast was as delicious as Molly used to make, Albus still chattered all the way through the meal, completely ignoring his manners and at one time almost spilled his entire glass of juice. James still grinned at his son conspiratorially as Diane scowled, shaking her head and sending Harry pleading looks, as if she was begging him to just Apparate her idiots of a son and husband somewhere far away. Despite all of this, the laughter of Albus and the motherly scolding of Diane could not hide the fact that sometimes James seemed to be all too silent, slipping into a hard mask now and then when he thought no one was looking. Harry found this odd and silently reminded himself to question him, or at least Diane later, as it was no proper manner in the presence of company. For the moment, he feigned ignorance and laughed along his grandson, the grim face on his son's face never quite vanished in the corner of his eyes.
“Where did you come from?”
That year, he received a package for his birthday. The package was unsigned; inside, wrapped in fine tissues, was a smallish framed painting of brick-walled buildings in blue and brown and an expansive sky from afar, as if drawn from a window. He did not recognise the painting.
Many years from now, Harry would often find himself in that room, lounging on the couch and tucked among cushions and blankets as his god-children and nieces and nephews fussed over him, nagging that he should have stayed in bed and kept his feet up. On one such days, as Teddy closed the door behind him, the conversation with Hugo and his cousins muffled by the heavy wooden door, Harry sat alone in the quiet room, surrounded by the looming frames of paintings. Once upon a time, when he sought refuge in this very room, wishing for a moment free from the ever-present threats of war, he was not alone. Back then, there was someone by his side, pointy elbows and knees poking into his side as the two of them were entwined on the ratty couch. Someone would have cursed at him, calling him names as if from habit, yet their voice would have been fond.
All the while Harry himself, feeling like a complete fool, could do nothing to stop her tears.
“I haven’t heard your voice for so long”, he whispered to no one.
His eyes then caught the sight of a brilliant golden field, lit up with a little bit of sunlight that had escaped through the cracks of the closed window. He watched as dust motes floated like flecks of snow against the background of wheat and sky, with a single road winding its way through the field, its far end disappearing into the threading sheaves of wheat. In the middle of the frame, a murder of crows took flight, their black long wings hanging mid-air like kites. When he purchased that painting many years ago, he was told that the painting depicted sorrow and solitude. Yet, whenever he looked at it, all he could feel was a hopeful promise.
Annoyed and furious, Harry considered ignoring the woman. Still, when she continued on her way down the hall and bore no interest in whether he followed her or not, he grumbled to himself in irritation, then followed her through the hallway, catching her before she made a turn at the end of a staircase. They walked quietly up the marble steps, neither making an effort to break the uncomfortable silence. Once they were on the second floor, Diane turned into a corridor and finally stopped in front of one of the doors. She abruptly turned around to look at Harry, as if telling him 'this was it'. He gave her a questioning look that went unanswered, but approached the door anyway. Once he was sure that the woman did not intend to follow him, he opened the door and entered the room.
He once casually asked Hermione whether she had seen Draco around and all he got in return was a pitied shake of the head. He had never told Hermione or Ron about his and Draco’s relationship, but he had a feeling that Hermione knew anyway, in the way that she seemed to know everything. He knew that she was subtly keeping an ear out for him, for not long afterwards she told him that someone had spotted the Malfoys arriving at Hogwarts at some point during the Battle, but they were quick to disappear after it was over. He presumed that they had taken Draco with him when they left, but that did not explain why there was not even an Owl, as if Draco saw no need to let him know. That left him resentful for a while, and for a few weeks all he wanted to do was to Apparate to Malfoy Manor, tear down the door to Draco’s room and demand an explanation.
Until now, maybe.
In the end, before Ginny could coach him on how to react in such cases, Harry was the one who accidentally blurted out the question one day post-coital. For one long moment, Malfoy did not say anything and Harry convinced himself that Malfoy had already fallen asleep. At midnight when Harry stepped out of the shower, ready to go back to Ginny, he found Malfoy sitting upright on the bed, twisting a handful of quilt in his hands and staring straight into Harry's eyes.
“Potter," Malfoy drawled, "either you answer the damn thing or let me destroy it. Either way, get it as far away from my son as possible, it's upsetting him.”
“The prick is probably unnerved that another Potter's going to start working at the Ministry. If he makes any threats to you, tell me immediately, you understand?”
Even then, James did not look at him. He only walked pass him as if he had heard nothing at all. Until he paused briefly next to Harry and whispered quickly,
“So?”
came from?”
“No, don’t say it.”
“Bullshit! There was no way that the Malfoys would ever willingly sacrifice their own son. You tricked them into this somehow, didn’t you?”
Harry just hummed lightly, focusing solely on the sleeping child in her daughter-in-law's arms, not hearing what James had said at all.
Harry listened to all of this in mild shock, partly from the idea itself, partly from the fact that it was rather obvious to him too, now that he actually thought about it.
The only good thing about his Father’s departure was that the Order became somewhat friendlier to the remaining Malfoys. He supposed that they felt sorry for them, being held back as bargaining chips while their patriarch was sent into the battle zone. They stopped giving them hateful glares as they moved around the house, and some, like Tonks and his Aunt Andromeda, even asked them to join for dinner, making awkward small talks and keeping up a sense of normalcy. Then, just as life was starting to be tolerable, Potter and crew joined them at Grimmauld’s Place. After the immediate shock, that brought about a fresh wave of hostile looks and words, especially since the reason for their supposedly defecting was still kept secret. For a while, things went back to zero, with Draco and Mother avoiding the Trio whenever they entered a room and sneaking around like thieves in avoidance of a confrontation. Eventually the hostility eased, thanks largely to Tonks and Lupin, who must have spoken to the Golden Trio at some point. They still kept largely to themselves, but at least could share a room without trading barbs.
“But Daaaaaaddd!!! Grandpa won't be here til next Friday! Please, Daddy, please?”
Pansy used to read a lot of trashy romantic pulp fictions. Deep underneath the bossy bitchy outer layer was a very romantic schoolgirl apparently, but since Pansy had a reputation to uphold, she went to great lengths to hide her guilty pleasure from people. Such rule did not apply to Draco, to his utter annoyance, and thus over the years he were repeatedly subjected to her lengthy rambling and had heard many a sigh as she daydreamed of star-crossed love stories of true soulmates and their happy endings. In a way, Draco thought, his situation was not unlike one of those soulmate stories, if one glossed over the fact that he and Potter were by no means mates or in love, or that one half of the equation was not aware of the connection between their souls.
“Keep your nose out of things that you do not understand! I know that you’ve been pestering Greg and snooping around, thinking yourself so clever. Well, keep out of our way or you’ll regret it.”
“Err, Ginny, I know we're in a really desperate situation, but males?”
When Harry walked out to the hallway, he did not close the door behind. He handed the baby to the waiting Mediwitch then silently turned at the doorway. Malfoy was on his side facing away from the door, his body rising evenly with every breath. Harry gave one long look at the man in front of his eyes, then took out his wand and pointed.
“Because you were dead set on not conceiving a child through sex. Male pregnancy cannot be brought about by artificial insemination, Harry.”
Draco and his parents spent the summer of his seventeenth birthday at Grimmauld’s Place. Moments after their return from King’s Cross, Professor Lupin and Moody came knocking at their door and demanded that they packed. They told them that it was per Dumbledore’s instructions, that Draco and his family was to be put under the Order’s protection. The mistrust in their eyes told Draco that they were unaware of the true reason for such bizarre wishes. Draco was surprised that they let his parents stayed with him instead of just whisking him away alone, but he guessed that they supposed it was better for them if his parents were not free to be in cahoots with the Dark Lord. They arrived at Grimmauld’s Place to a dusty and dank living room, the fireplace ringed by a circle of suspicious eyes and mumbled swearing. But no one actually threw them a curse, so he supposed it could have been worse.
All of the sudden the excited voice was replaced by pondering, which jolted Harry out of his secret musings.
. He wrote back,
“Were you ever going to tell me?”
It was a dark December afternoon when Diane's barn owl came knocking furiously at Harry's closed window. Harry startled, he had been too concentrated on a case report for the past half an hour to pay attention to much else. The shivering bird swooped into the room and immediately perched on the chair closest to the fireplace, all the while giving Harry the mightiest glare. Harry apologised to the bird with a smile even when she pecked at his hand violently as he reached towards the scroll at her foot.
Harry came over to James' London house one day to the sound of chatter in his grandson's nursery. Upon looking inside he found James and his wife playfully argued over Albus' cot, James having a mock hurt face and Diane rolling her eyes while lightly punching his arm.
Harry really knew that this time, it was his punishment.
Diane was equally confused when he told her that night but also did not see this as strictly a bad thing. Draco Malfoy had been anything but a scheming plotter for the last two decades of his life. He was solitary and quiet unless work was involved. He had worked his well-earned way to the top of his department using nothing but his skills and talents. He had no scandals of any kind nor trouble with the Ministry whatsoever. It was hard to look at the man and imagine him planting a huge trap for the son of an old school rival for no apparent reason. Still, they agreed that caution was necessary and had the estates and heirlooms checked for curses. After half a year of no negative reports, they decided to accept the will, half-convincing themselves that Malfoy had chosen James due to his relation with the distant cousin Diane Warrington but had forgotten to mention it in the will.
“Dad, I know your relationship with Malfoy wasn't the best in school, but don't you dare say things about Diane just because she's remotely related to him. Besides, it's not the worst thing being related to Malfoy, you know?”
, he thought as he ruffled the Chosen One’s messy hair.
“And knew exactly what was to become of him. All of the Malfoys did. That’s the price they agreed to pay to right their wrongs.”
“James was accusing me of cheating on him!” Diane exclaimed quite dramatically.
The reason he was in the conundrum that he was in.
“Yes?”
For all of the time that he had spent thinking about the meaning of his life, never had he envisioned meeting Potter for real. Intellectually, he knew that they were of the same age, that they were most likely going to attend Hogwarts together, that at some point they would have come across one another within the Magic community. He knew that Potter had his mother’s eyes and his father’s hair and a lightning bolt scar on his forehead and if knowing else, he knew that the link between them would would set Potter out like a beacon among the crowd. Yet, for all that he knew Harry Potter was the person in whose hands his demise was held, he had never taken a real shape in his mind, for how could a single human being had such power over the life of another?
As the flame in the fireplace burst into life, Harry heard his son's quiet voice speaking into the fire:
Only when they went passed the rows of disapproving Malfoy portraits did Harry remember. The fury James was harbouring was identical to that he once saw in Malfoy's eyes years ago when they were still schoolboys. Those were quite unpleasant memories, however, and Harry quickly swallowed them down like a particularly bitter potion.
Shock was the first feeling. Then it was a rush of relief, of worry, of happiness as Harry imagined Ginny's face beaming with joy. When he bent down to hug the blond, Malfoy's face looked as if something had just been broken. But it was probably just the patches of moonlit shadows on his face.
“It’s the worst idea ever.”
“What I'm saying is that, why don't we try with a male surrogate instead?”
Then, as the Hogwarts years went by and Potter, while getting himself into peril every school year like clockwork, never actually died, Draco supposed he could give the guy some slack. For awhile, Draco thought that Dumbledore had told Potter about the bond, that Potter did not have to fear mortal danger while there was literally a back-up life in reserve. That gave a bitter taste in his mouth, but then he overheard a conversation between the Golden Trio sometime in the middle of their Third Year, frantically whispered in a corner of the Library admist the general fear of Dementors and Sirius Black on the loose, and realised that Potter too was scared like everybody else. Then, as he pieced together Potter’s adventures from gossips, he started to feel sorry for Potter. All the grievances that he himself had wondered about in his childhood, Potter was now living them. While Potter was not innocent of some of the things he found himself in, danger did seek him out despite his best intent and the guy was only trying his best not to die in the process. Draco supposed that they were not so different after all, two boys whose fates were preordained for death and explicably out of their control.
“I'm fully aware that she was my mother, but that was no excuse for leaving my father out of my life like this!”
Then, Parkinson drew her wand from beneath her cloak. Startled, he wondered whether she would be tempted to hex him off the edge. Would that not be terribly ironic, to have avoided death by Voldermort only to be killed by Parkinson of all people. But then, instead of pointing the wand at him, she pointed to the sky and murmured an incantation that was too quiet for him to catch. The sky, just now thick with clouds, cleared up and left a gap just big enough, like curtains drawn on a stage. There, as if conjured up from out of nowhere, from that small window of clear aquamarine sky, sparkles filled his eyes with countless twinkling stars. There were so many of them, some twinkling brighter than others, some hazed on their edges as their light reached them from light years away. Years of Hogwarts should have helped him name all the constellations and stars, but in that moment his mind was blank, their names and meanings inconsequential as he took in the wondrous view before him, speechless for words. In the corner of his eyes, he could see their patch of sky reflected on the surface of the Great Lake, its myriads of stars duplicated on the gentle ripples of the water surface. Strangely, even though it was the first time he had seen the night sky this way, a well of nostalgia, of wistful memories, of a vague yearning rose up in him, perplexingly unexplanable. As he gazed as the stars, mesmerised, his ears were no longer filled with hisses from curses being flung, replaced by a muted hum of white noise. His legs no longer tapped but felt light like feathers, as if they would not be able to hold his weight. His fingers no longer twitched but felt warm and full, and he realised that Parkinson and him had somehow moved closer together and her wandless hand was now in his. He could not tear his eyes away from the starry night, and all of a sudden he could not stop crying. Big fat teardrops fell down his cheeks, yet he made no sound, maybe he was not able to. Next to him, he had a feeling that Parkinson was crying too, although she too was quiet, herself lost in thoughts unknown to him. So, there they sat, eyes unmoved from the starry night, shoulder to shoulder, hands clasped together, until dawn edged from the horizon.
His Raison d'être.
In all of honesty, Harry did not expect much to come out of his visit to Hogwarts. His mind was still reeling from the encounter, thinking that the Malfoys had been nothing but overtly dramatic. They had ulterior motives perhaps, trying to catch him off-guard by bringing up a sensitive spot, trying to leverage his once feelings for their son for their benefits. Maybe Draco had coached them so, telling them about his schoolboy crushes. With such frame of thought in mind, he Flooed into the Headmistress’ Office, expecting to have his suspicion justified. Yet, when he saw the glint in Dumbledore’s eyes, he knew that there was more to this than a joke of poor taste at his expense. He had been lied to enough by Dumbledore over the years to recognise the well-concealed guilt in his demeanor. Still, nothing could have prepared him for the truth.
Not answering, the Auror paused in front of a room, opened the room and gestured inside. All the three adults gasped at a lone naked figure lying on a metal table, covered from the chest down with a white sheet. The bony shoulders and thin neck, as well as the sides of a pale face were soiled with blood clots and bruise. The blond hair was matted with blood and the room was utterly quiet.
“Harry, you know I wouldn't suggest this if we only had a tiniest chance with any other options, but we don't. I know you don't want to sleep with someone else but we have no other choice. Can you please do it for us, for me?”
All of the sudden, Harry was seeing a lot of Malfoy. He saw Malfoy when he stopped by the FD to turn in evidence or to receive a report; he found Malfoy chewing on his sandwich alone in a corner of the cafeteria; he had a glance of blond hair in the crowded lift in the morning rush; he used the Floo next to Malfoy's after work. Each time Malfoy acted as if he did not know Harry. Actually, he acted as if he did not know anyone but his team and Kingsley, obviously a poor attempt to erase his dark past and the offending tattoo underneath his sleeve. But that suited Harry just fine. He was still not fond of the man, despite being the one who spoke for him at the trial; however he felt no need to taunt on their past. As far as he concerned, they did not owe each other anything.
he wanted to say, but words could not come out of his mouth. Not when James had leaned back against the couch and was still crying. Then he remembered the Pensive and vials of memories churning inside, their silvery content glittering like mercury. He remembered Malfoy talking to a younger James over shimmering cauldrons. He remembered James noticing Malfoy's stares. And he remembered Albus' accident and the cold body on the metal bed. At this point, James were no longer looking at him. He had stood up and turned towards the fireplace, turning his back against his dad, the man he had practically worshiped for the better part of his life. Just like the day his dad turned away from his father more than twenty years ago with him in arms, never to return again.
"Can I see them? The petals?" He asks, walking towards Draco, "They say the flower usually represents the character of whom you're in love with, and I'd like to know what they're like, at least vaguely, since you won't tell me who they are"
Thirty minutes after he laid down, he heard a soft knock and a quiet "Madam Pomfrey? I think I'll be having trouble tonight, could you help me out?"
"Was that Potter you just came in with?" Blaise asked Draco as he slid into his seat, "Yeah, unless there's another Gryffindor with circular spectacles and unruly hair." Draco tried to sound annoyed, but he was a little too giddy for it.
He closed his eyes and visualized the classic chairs, and flicked his wrist, transforming the damned book into a chair.
Draco noticed potter's shaking hands push the chair into the table and pick his books up and just walk out of the classroom, stopping by professor McGonagall to excuse him.
Harry smiled against Draco’s lips, and whispered "the only good thing you ever did in your life was keeping your mouth shut when aunt Bella asked if you recognized me." A cruel sultry twist on his face.
People care for Draco, and they notice, more than he realizes.
"You never got presents on your birthday?"
“Oi, I’m not your fuckin charity case, you can’t try to kiss your friends, just because they’re in love with you.”
“Uh, turns out it was me? Who Draco is in love with and I- I love him too? Only he didn’t know? And so I kissed him, with his permission of course, and he just-
Trying to steer the conversation away from uncomfortable roads, Harry continues, adding fake cheer to his voice "Which reminds me! Remember the time you claimed to be the heir of Slytherin? Dear lord, little Malfoy with slicked back hair boasting about it"
“No, no!” He shakes his head violently, “it’s been years, long before I even found out about this disease.”
"Ah, that's because I avoid them thoroughly, I don't think the rest of the class would enjoy seeing a former death-eater lounge in the common room or play chess with him, and I don't think I'm wrong"
with you, that’s big commitment, innit? I mean after all you just have a crush on him, and he’s absolutely fatally in
His conversations with Luna had made him feel like a true sinner, she'd made him understand that his hatred towards people for things that are beyond their control and their blood status was cruel.
Draco lurches "What? She used a spell on her parents? Did she get knocked up or something?"
, it is still most definitely
" Draco huffed out in a rush to cover up.
Draco looks at him.
“Yeah, no, of course it wouldn’t.”
"You’re okay, you’re okay." he mumbled to himself, waiting for the onslaught of coughs. He could hear a faint rustling in his chest. Just as he finished whispering a silencing spell, the coughing began.
"Hmm, go ahead, but I might not answer,"
Is this the demented inverse of Sleeping Beauty?? He’s full blown panicking, he kissed the boy he loves, who decided to
would it matter to
"It's going to take a while to kick in, because of the Prunus, so just sit tight. Oh, and Draco? If you have a chance with her, please just woo her and save yourself."
SO! this was a long chapter, and i decided to upload it in two parts! Sorry for the horribly long wait, but consider this a New year gift, just keeping it secular!
“Maybe you should ask Longbottom, he’s obsessed with plants isn’t he?”
“Were Gladiators named after Gladiolus or is it the other way around?”
"Not until Hogwarts," he says, shaking his head.
Harry accidentally overhears a conversion he shouldn't, and as always, hermione comes in clutch.
Harry stood there, looking down at an unconscious Draco in horror.
"That book, in transfiguration, you seemed rather unsettled after it, what was it?"
Just before professor decided to begin class, Potter walked in, shuffling over to Granger and Weasley, and Draco could hear nervous whispers from Potter, and an encouraging tone from Granger. He heard Potter huff, and walk over to Ernie, smiling at the boy and thanking him. Draco watched him out of the corner of his eye, his frown deepening. Ernie clapped Harry’s back and vacated his seat.
righteous, not really the nose-in-the-book type.” Draco sighs, “Not a Ravenclaw, then.”
Under normal circumstances, Draco would've said no, but he's got nothing to lose so why the fuck not?
" Draco burst out, silencing half the table, grabbing his bag and storming out of the great hall. He felt completely bare, and raw.
“I need to talk to you, Draco. Please wake up.” He says out loud, feeling like a fool and a damsel from those romance novels Ginny used to tell him the plot of.
"Oh yeah, Hermione once used them on her parents, and then she had to search for them after the war, super stressful" Potter says, like it's a tale about making a sandwich.
Groaning, Draco closed his eyes. Furious all of a sudden, is this why he came back to Hogwarts? To be plagued by this pompous disease? If he'd stayed at the manor, maybe it wouldn’t have progressed so quickly, he thought.
comment to make an author happy <3
Either give him hope, or make him fall out of love with the person.
Harry’s brows were now furrowed in concern, it’s been 6 hours, and though Madame Pomfrey said it’s normal, it still freaked him out, he was tracing patterns on Draco’s hand.
Draco didn't know how to reply, "Oh. No wonder"
Also, english isn't my first language, so if you find any issues, please let me know!

He goes to library to work on his essay for charms and begins to gather the right books, when he gets back to his spot he finds Potter standing next to his seat.
Potter settled in, right next to Draco.
still stands, sorry,

"Quite the Shakespearean monologue, Potter," Draco tried to say coolly, but his eyes were burning, and his chest was rustling, "I’ll think about it, as of right now, we're about to miss supper."
It's been a month and IM SORRY. Which is why theres a double update :)
“She said it was
Perhaps it's time to dive into a bit of backstory to Draco's situation, a little bit of light on his redemption.
Draco splutters out a weak “Why not a Ravenclaw?”
At Draco's suspicious look, Blaise rolls his eyes, "Ask Madam Pomfrey, she'll tell ya, anyway, the petals!"
“Oh my god, I fucking told you! Agh I knew he was in love with you,” Ginny exclaims arms wrapping around Harry’s shoulders. “I’m surprised you’re so okay with this,” Ron interjects, and Ginny shakes her head, “He was good to Luna, and though she wouldn’t go into details of their friendship, she told me he was
Potter turns his attention away from Madam Pomfrey, and catches Draco’s eye with surprise coloring his face. "Yes, Madam Pomfrey"
“We can’t be sure, can we though? Just because Draco thinks of the person as a gladiator it doesn’t have to mean
Blaise lets out a laugh devoid of humor, turns to her, and scowls, “Shut up about it, Granger.”
Draco coughs awake, flowers choking him, “Damn it!” a warm hand grips his shoulder to prevent him from falling of the bed, “Water.” He chokes out. A pale hand passes him a glass of water, a very pale hand in comparison to the usual Blaise-brown toned one.
Draco strode into the transfiguration classroom, as usual he was one of the first few people there.
He can feel the prickling in his throat and the burning behind his eyes, he's either going to cry or cough, and neither of them is he about to do in public, so he rushed to the closest bathroom.
Luna Lovegood had been the first one to notice his symptoms, the first one to catalogue them and tell Draco that there was a plant growing inside of him. One can imagine how smoothly that conversation went, especially with her reputation to casually talk barmy.
Potter squeezed his eyes shut and Draco could almost hear his brain working, rolling his eyes he started focusing on his own book and turning it into a chair again. He began the visualizing process when he heard a sharp intake of breath from potter.
Madame Pomfrey looks at him, sympathetic, “Harry dear, are you sure you’re in love with him? You’re not making yourself believe that because you want to save him, right? Because that would only hurt him more,”
He feels his coughing wind down and heads out of the bathroom to wash his face, getting caught by a solemn looking Blaise. "So much of slowing the progression."
Draco watches potters gratuitous response with a deepening frown on his face, why on earth was Potter reacting like he saw a ghost?
, he just didn’t have a chance to show it. And then he also saved you guys, so, yeah.” She pulled away from lightly throttling Harry, “Plus, as an outsider, you know, not in the epicenter of the war and all, their obsession with each other was
"Yeah, I did. You were right, she did give me something to slow the progression and it’s the first time in a while I've had uninterrupted sleep." He clamped his mouth shut as he realized he was about to tell Blaise that potter was in the infirmary and how it was quite ironic.
"Hmm, go ahead, but I might not answer," Draco mimics, smirking.
Draco’s face flames with humiliation. “What the hell?” He whispered in accusation, eyes blazing.
With a soft gasp, she puts a spell on his napkin to isolate the flower, and sets it away.
Draco shot up in his bed, his breathing unsteady. He clutched his quilt and pushed his fists against his chest.
Comment to make an author happy?
"Well then, I am sure you won't tell me who, but try not to cough near the rest of the students, since you've already progressed this far, we wouldn't want a Hanahaki epidemic here. I trust you to be responsible. If you'd like to, you can spend the nights in the infirmary." He nods.
homoerotic, all the damn time.” Hermione bursts out laughing, “Oh! I know, Harry always found every excuse to spy on Draco,”
Draco gripped Harry’s hand and harry looked up to see Draco watching him. Relief flooded his face and he relaxed. Draco smirked and slowly sat up.
Draco sighs, "I will choose not to answer that, but you can ask me something else if you'd like, so that we're even."
He couldn't give himself the option of looking at potter. He didn't have the self-control to keep his eyes away, if he had the chance. It did him real damage he couldn't afford.
"Neither am I, and you should know that." Draco replied, turning back to his books.
That’s a sure fire way to get Draco to listen, Just use Potter’s name in any context. Blaise
“Let go, what else do you need? There, cat’s out of the bag, I’m in love with you, I’ll get the treatment done the day the winter holiday’s start, Blaise already booked me an appointment, don’t worry, you’ve saved the world, you don’t have to save me.”
Draco finally shifted to make blank eye contact with potter, "How does you enlightening me about figure of speech translate to '

spell it out for you, What I’m trying to say is, I want to kiss you, I have for an embarrassingly long time.” When Malfoy says nothing and only gapes in return, he grins and steps forward, looking up at Draco “So, Can I kiss you?”
Much love, stay safe, hope you enjoyed this! <3
Harry shrugs, “Never had the opportunity to philosophize, getting hunted by Voldemort, and all.” He flashes Draco a smile. His fingers a little cold with   nervousness.
Ernie and Millicent make out, Hermione tries her hand at the ballet, Weasely tells the tale of the flying car, Blaise pole dances for 4 minutes, and a few other things happen. Draco doesn’t feel alone.

towards Draco.
This chapter is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, for most people involved. Hold on tight ;)
“Only to you.” Harry snaps.
She gives him a Sleeping draught and an odd tincture of Prunus Dulcis which reduces the love hormone, slowing the progression of Hanahaki.
secret, nothing I needed to know. Stop trying to derail this, I’m trying to have a serious conversation with you.”
Draco looks at him, flummoxed, “What are you trying to say?” He croaks out, slowly.
"Granger is certainly a force to be reckoned with" Draco tells him.
On their way to Charms, Draco asks Blaise how he knows so much about the disease, "Hah! a cousin of mine fell in love with a muggle, he had to get the surgery done, no other option for him, as if his parents would let him run off with a muggle" Blaise scoffs.
He'd snuck in as Blaise left his ‘guard duty’ for class and Madame Pomfrey didn't seem to mind his sheepish shrug for an excuse
He stops short at the doorway of the Great Hall where Potter stands in front of him, "Malfoy, you okay?"
“Don’t- don’t try to do that, you know I am concerned,” at the odd sparkle and smile on Draco’s face, harry huffs “It’s not funny, Draco, you’re being a fool.”  “It’s a little funny, at least to me.”
So, maybe a little selfish. As of right now, his only emotions were related to Potter, and the rest of his world was so painfully bleak, like a nightmare made of the color gray in smells, taste, and sounds. And the smallest, most irrational part of Draco hoped that Potter might someday, miraculously return his feelings.
She nods “Well then, notify me when he wakes up, I’ll check his progress.” He nods in answer, eyes fixated on Draco’s flushed face.
"Listen, not all of us can have perfect looping cursive, Malfoy. I didn't even get presents on my birthdays, much less a fancy tutor" He replies with a laugh.
As he rose for class the next morning, Draco was sure he'd spent more than a third of the night coughing. Blaise looked over at him and cringed, "You should consider asking madam Pomfrey for a sleeping draught, instead of a coughing one. Clearly it has no effect, since you look like you were chasing toads for the better part of the night"
Draco forced himself to keep his eyes on his notes, and replied "maybe a Quaffle"
It started like this.
"It's faster than I thought it would be, it's not... well" He opens his napkin to show her the bud and its petal.
Draco could see potter paling by the second and decided to end his mysterious misery, maybe becoming the hero for a moment in anyone's life.
He glared at Blaise, and when he saw only genuine concern in the boy’s face, he forced himself to bury his anger.
"Draco, why are you here? There are healers who could cure you, and you know that!"
Draco had to force himself to look away, "I just... Imagined a page, and added a few more pages to it. Maybe try not to focus on the book entirely, but on each component that makes the book"
your comments make my day!! So please comment, it makes me feel like people actually want to read this hehe
Blaise Pulls invisible strings and Potter keeps Draco company :)
“Why are you
With a shocked look, she ushers Draco to the examination room "Dear, this is certainly not alright, why on earth did you keep this from me? How bad are your symptoms?"
He yells out for Madame Pomfrey, lifting Draco and putting him back on the bed, after a few calls for her, she rushes to him “Oh dear, what’s happened?” She asks.
“To be honest Blaise, I thought the gladiators were named after the flower” A bleak attempt of humor, when Draco felt like he was being read like a book by Blaise. All because of a stupid flower. Blaise gave Draco a blank look. “So, they’re a Gryffindor or a Hufflepuff.”
Draco lets out a tiny laugh, “You sound awfully concerned, Harry.”
any criticism is also welcome, Reach out to me on tumblr @no-motivationlads
"What’s the flower called, Draco?”
Shoving Potter lightly, laughing, he says "Please, we will pretend that never happened. I was a whole prick back then,"
Draco opens his fist, to show him the petals, "I don't know what plant this is. Blaise, I can't lose the rest of my days trying to woo them, it'll only make the disease worse"
“Bloody
For some reason, knowing that he doesn't need to avoid Potter at every turn, gives him relief and his day goes by smoothly. After classes he goes to get his tincture from Madam Pomfrey, and she confirms Blaise's theory and tells him if he isn't friends with the subject of his affections, he should, since it could do two cathartic things:
Turning to Draco, potter shot him an overcompensating bright smile. "Morning Malfoy, hah! That’s alliteration," and he clamped his mouth shut, blinking dumbly. "W-what I meant was, you alright?"
They get a foot and a half of work done, and the conversation is surprisingly easy between them.
They pulled away for air, and Draco looked like a wild rabbit about to scatter, his face crumpling. Before Harry could lean in to kiss him again, Draco’s legs give away, his eyes rolling to the back of his head, and he faints.

"Oh, I know, I was wondering if you'd be alright with me sitting next to you and um... maybe helping me with the essay for charms, I was rather out of it" Potter replies, scratching the back of his neck.
"Potter, you're in eighth year and your handwriting is like chicken scratch, why bother research for your essays, you could write anything and it would be still be incomprehensible."
Recently, the green eyed hero was being quite a prick. He kept appearing in Draco’s direct field of vision, greeting Draco,
“Oh right, I forgot my reputation as the

"Wouldn't Granger be a better person copy from?"
Ron Weasely and Hermione Granger have been friends with Harry for years, through the darkest of times, and they know what he means. Ron’s face smoothens. “Well, then. What are you here for? Aren’t you supposed to tell him that you’re most likely in love with him too?”
You’re making
After Draco learnt of this, he decided to keep it to himself, and just suffer, even though a part of his pain was selfish.
” He gets up from his seat and walks to the other end of the infirmary bed, joining Draco, a couple of steps separating them.
The silence stretches between them.
“Friends? Oh wow, you think I link pinky’s with all my friends? Hold their hand while we run from the rain? Actually visit the
"I... don't want to be cured just yet. If I survive till the end of the year, I'll look into some healers." Madam Pomfrey looked at him with mournful eyes, like she knew exactly why.
Draco and harry play quidditch, and someone else stumbles upon Draco's secret.
"Slightly invasive questions, can I ask you one?" Potter asks, smile melting away.
side-eyes him in curiosity, watching Draco snap out of his trance. Daphne Greengrass continues “I wouldn’t say, lucky, because I reckon he’s been through quite a few awful circumstances, I’d say Potter’s strong willed, and after all, not even death could stop him from doing what he wanted to.”
She then smiles warmly at him, having finished a check-up for his vitals, “Well then, I’m glad you were able to sort it out in time, this fainting of Draco’s is not uncommon, specially since he’s reached stage 4. It’s basically the bodies way of getting rid of the disease, there’s a complex combustion process taking place in his lungs. A little painful, but the pain is what makes him endure.” She charms a cool cloth on Draco’s face, “Do you plan on staying with him?”
The Italiacs during a specific scene is the translated version of a french song.
Draco’s face is like a sword, unwavering and ready to strike.
Draco was still furious. He felt like the physical embodiment of a thundercloud.
"And it's not like you were actively a part of the war, you had to because of your father, and you've been very docile this year, and oh! Even Potter deemed you worthy of being saved fiendfyre, and he spoke at your trial, so if the Hero thinks you're redeemable then surel-"
and he receives a nice thwak to his head from Ron, “
Gripping his wand tightly harry tries to clear his thoughts to turn that bloody book into a chair again, and fails.
Harry laughs, and takes 3 steps towards Draco, “Let
"Alright, so we're doing an essay on the development of memory charms, and these are the books we'll be needing, at least for now."
Potter raises his eyebrows, "well, you are wrong, malfoy," Shifting in his seat, he continues, "You do know that all of us realize that you had no choice? You should know that I, of all people, know exactly how it feels to have no choice. Maybe not everyone realizes that you and I are two sides of the same coin, but all of us do know you tried to minimize the damage. Luna told Ginny about how you helped her, and Gin also knew about you acting like it wasn't me in the manor. So naturally, everyone knows. So stop being a pompous prick and just hang with everyone, I'm serious when I say no one's going to make it weird unless you do."
As soon as they got to the practice part of the lesson, where they had to turn their chair into a smaller object, and then back to a chair, Harry leaned over "what will you turn it into? I think I’ll try a book."
Harrys hand reaches out to grip Draco's sleeve.
, the chosen one, master of death etc etc.
Draco glares at him and washes his face away coughing one last time and catching his cotton candy colored petals in his fist.
"Enough, Blaise."
"Oh." Potter replied, his shoulders hunching as he walked towards his bed, "Well then, good night, Malfoy." Draco watches Potter down his potion with a solemn smile.
love!
Harry closes his eyes, waiting for the mocking laugh, for the pain.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wished he could sew his lips shut as soon as he sees Potter's bright green eyes flash and he tilts his head "My pretty little head? You think it's pretty?" he teased Draco with a cheeky smirk on his face.
"A Deatheaters
“And now we know he just wanted to stare at Draco’s arse,” Ron finished. At Harry’s blushing protests they quieted down, with a final ‘I’m happy for you, mate’ Ron wrapped up the gang and herded them away. Harry valued that about Ron, he always knew when Harry started to get antsy, and gently pulled people away from Harry.
Potter barks out a laugh in surprise
“Tell me who it is.”
"That's my seat potter," Draco says, unable to meet potter's eyes, he felt guilty about his outburst towards potter earlier that day.
“I… did, but I… are you being honest right now?”
Harry sits next to Draco’s sleeping form,
In moments like these, when he looks up at the dark ceiling and feels truly alone in his problems, he wishes Luna was here.
“So what if it is you?” Draco says, voice like smoke and obsidian, clear and emotionless.
"Hey! I don't want to copy from you I just want... guidance since I have no clue what was going on in class, and no, 'Mione has never let us leech off of her," Potter shrugs, with a smile on his face.

Draco was woken by his coughing fit, and he was surprised to see dawn breaking. He'd had 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep and he felt… better. He left the infirmary, and a sleeping Potter, and headed to the Slytherin dorms to get ready for the day.
Blaise confronts Draco, in the most Slytherin fashion possible.
“Yeah, I’m not leaving anytime soon.”

Hermione shoots him a look of exasperation but quickly explains, and Ron looks at Harry in awe “That’s fantastic right? So why’d you look so horrified, mate?”
“How did you even know I speak French?” Potter runs a hand through his hair and shrugs, a wide grin planted on his face. Just for that expression, Draco would do anything. Even sing in French.
"You alright, harry?" Weasely asks, tentative. Potter lifted his dilated eyes into Draco’s and let out a slow breath.

Harry’s life is very far from a fairytale, so he can’t just rush to Draco and kiss him awake, for many reasons but also because it is
Happiness, angst, and then some more angst.
"I said
Draco asked, scrutinizing.
"Alright, Draco. 'Tis nothing but a question, lad" Blaise says with a nasally voice, earning a laugh from Draco.
Harry grips the flower, and brings it to his eye level, “It’s pretty, is it sorta symbolic how something so pretty can kill you from the inside? Like a literal tangible version of love?”
he spits out, walking away.
Harry brushed his fingers against Draco’s hair, his thumb fitting right under Draco’s ear.
The class began filling in, and eventually granger and Weasley took their places, Potter didn't waltz in with them. Yes, Draco noticed. It was one of the few moments he allowed himself to catch a glimpse of potter.
because he doesn’t speak that way.” He says slowly, with a small grin.
And then Potter showed up in the Manor, on his knees with a swollen face, and Draco felt his chest constrict, he lied, of course, he lied.
“...what did you just say?”
“Which is why, Harry, I think most women are less compatible with your magic.”
Taking it as permission, Harry bolted out of the room, barely looking back at the blond. The baby stopped crying almost immediately and he resumed staring at his father in quiet amazement. The man looked down at him, still smiling while lovingly tracing the soft frame of his round face with a thumb. The child's tiny fingers wriggled out from under their cover and took hold at his father's ring finger, gripping at the warm metal ring coiling around it. Both of them could hear the muffled voice of the brunette on the other side of the door, the words unclear, though Malfoy suspected he already knew who called. Suddenly, he gripped the boy in his arms tightly, making the child frowned, yet he remained quiet. Green eyes still stared at silver ones, the silver eyes that were filled with indescribable grief and fear. The boy felt his father lifting him up to his chest and his cheek crushed at a bony shoulder, his tiny body shaking with trembles from the body underneath him and his fingers never letting go of his father's ring.
“What's wrong with males?”
as she poured herself coffee. Ginny seemed to have forgotten about her demise altogether. Harry did not, but he himself was at a loss as to what to say and tried to push the depressing thoughts to the back of his skull, following Ginny's cues instead. It was fine until one night when he woke up to Ginny silently crying in an empty room, originally intended to be a nursery when they first renovated Godric's Hollow. The moment he saw her rolling tears as she sat motionlessly on the floor, it hit him again that nothing was all right, that nothing could change the fact that Ginny was sick and dying and condemned to childlessness. Again, as he drew his wife to his chest and rocked her slowly to slumber, he felt hopelessness washed over him, pulling the two of them down a bottomless dark sea.
“Daddy?”
It was during this time that Potter became Harry, and between their mingled breaths, even though he should have known better, Draco began to hope.
For five years, he kept his head down. He went to classes, did his homework and read until late in the Library. He enjoyed a faint acquaintance with his fellow housemates and laughed and talked when he was expected to, but kept them all at arm’s length. At the beginning, they fluttered around him in search of connections or to curtail favours, but were quick to leave when they realised that he would grant them none. All except for Pansy Parkinson, a sharp-eyed girl who was impervious to his cold demeanour and snapped at others when they got too close to him. She hung on his arms as they walked between classes like an overbearing girlfriend, but she was also sarcastic and rude and never refrained from calling him out on his bullshit. He knew that there was no point in cultivating a relationship with anyone, but five years was an awfully long time to be alone and her persistence wore him down. Pansy was a friend, he suppose.
At that moment, Harry decided to move on and try to forget about him.
They started to visit a counsellor and put their names down on the surrogate waiting list. Despite the anonymity of the procedure, somehow the couple found themselves with a surrogate after just a few weeks. Maybe their Healer had pulled some strings, or maybe it was Harry, anxious to please Ginny, was actually the one pulling strings, by then it no longer mattered. The insemination was done soon after, then came the two weeks waiting for the pregnancy to be confirmed. Two weeks of both of them nervously on the edge of their seats and a great air of excitement in the house, Ginny even forgetting a Healer's monthly appointment. The day of their appointment found the couple waiting in the Healer's office looking as if their hearts would jump out of their throats at any moment.
He had never understood why the painting called out to him so much, but he did now.
“Yes, yes he did.”
“I just do.”
“Do you, erm, perhaps recall that James and I-”
The day Harry saw James off for Hogwarts for the first time, he was pretty sure he saw a mop of platinum-blond hair in the middle of the crowd at the station. When he returned to the Ministry later that afternoon, he heard that Malfoy had taken a day off.
On the headboard was an engraved 'Scorpius'.
“All right then, you little crups. You know how much mum and dad love one another?”
“For one, they're males!”
So Draco left.
Approximately twelve hours later, he woke up to a dark Infirmary and invisible hands gripping his. When Potter leaned over and kissed him, his lips tasted like tears and apologies.
“Was raising me as a sacrificial lamb not enough that you need another at your altar? Draco was a child, Professor!”
The spouses decorated the nursery with enthusiasm, happily filled up the once-emptied room with baby furniture and re-painted the room with flying griffins and unicorns.
, he told himself.
Later, when Ron and Hermione had come by and listened to the entire story, Ron patted on Harry's shoulder sympathetically. “Such an irony, mate, after all that hatred between the two of you over the years, it was Malfoy that ended up saving your grandson's life. Guess the ferret did have a heart too.”
Well sure, he did spend the first few years or so of his life questioning the fairness of it all. Why should he sacrifice his life for this boy who loomed larger than anyone else over his life but had never once shown kindness to him? Why should he give up his life for someone who was practically a stranger, a strange who was meant to go up against the most powerful Wizard of their time? Why should he take that burden, he who had no say in the matter?
Draco never came.
"Merlin help me... we would be taking advantage of someone in no position to say no! I'm still not going to force myself on anyone, even for you Ginny. It's enough I'm trying to force myself into this.”
At first, the words did not register with him. Then, his brain caught up to his words, spoken out loud for the first time in his life. Pansy’s silence dragged on. Finally, with dread, he turned around to her and learned from her face what devastation looked like.
His mind was wary, but he did not think much of it.
A week later, Harry was unsurprised, but still disturbed, when he saw that the blond hair had remained. No matter what kind of spells he used, James said, he could not get back his original brown colour, unless he considered dyeing. Somewhere in the background Diane chirped in, saying she loved the new blond head, thus James was content with keeping it this way. When Albus pointed out that his daddy looked like the man that saved him, everyone was even a bit mournful.
“That's because my aunts and uncles didn't know enough about him. Shall I tell you his stories then? How about that time when grandpa Draco's findings led to the capture of a very dangerous criminal that had not been discovered for three years?...”
“Where did I come from?”
One evening, after a weekend dinner at The Burrow, Ron and Hermione announced that they were expecting their first baby. Immediately, all eyes went to Ginny who seemed to have frozen in her seat. There was a quiet hush and angry whispers coming from Molly's direction to the older couple, enraged by their carelessness of Ginny's condition. The guilty look on Ron and Hermione's faces were wiped off with a flick of Ginny's hand, assuring everyone that she was fine and her situation was no excuse to stop the family from being happy for her brother and sister. Everyone was reminded for a moment that Ginerva Weasley was a strong woman who did not tolerate pity in any way and hated being reminded of her inferiority. Joy was back in the room once more as people congratulated the expecting parents. Harry cheered as well, though he felt Ginny's heavy gaze on him all the while.
“Can’t sleep too?”, she murmured.
It had been so many years. Harry could barely remember the voice.
“Really?! We were in mum's belly? How did Al even fit in there, he's an elephant!”
“It doesn’t matter now does it, I would die soon anyway!”
“So you're saying...”
And then, James was gone.
“See, see how my concrete proof is revealed?” James' voice was booming but his mind failed to register the words. He was trapped in a trance caused by the irregular-coloured eyes. “How can a Warrington-Potter child possess such beautiful silver eyes, unless the mother had been unfaithful?” James continued, but after a while both him and Diane burst into laughter again. They stopped when they realised that Harry had not joined in and was apparently too busy staring at Albus' eyes.
It was Ginny at the end of the rope when she visited Harry at work one day and found Malfoy quietly but constantly watching her husband from a distant table in the cafeteria at lunch. As she laid in Harry's arms later that night, she recalled the fierce stormy gaze and could not help but wonder.
That was what he told himself as he crawled into bed for the night, for five years.
“Pardon?”
Harry heard his son's not-so-subtle hitched breath. James did not look taken aback when he heard his father's words, more like he did not realise that Harry required a speech to understand whatever it was that had been hanging over them all evening. He finally lowered his gaze down to the carpet and let out a heavy sigh, burrowing his fingers into his hair, a sign of distress that he inherited from his father. For a long moment, James said nothing, but then he stood up from the sofa, walked up to a cupboard and opened one of the shelves. The door effectively blocked off the content of the shelf, but Harry could hear glass or ceramic clinking as James rummaged through them. After a while, he retrieved two considerable-sized boxes and brought them towards Harry. He dropped the boxes on the coffee table between them and returned to his seat. James slowly opened one of them and, to Harry's surprise, revealed a Pensive. James moved on to open the other, which was full of small vials of silvery memories. For a while, James just stared at the vials in silent, which did nothing more to explain the situation. When Harry finally decided to ask, James suddenly looked up.
James lapsed back into silence, and for some reasons Harry did not think that it was really about the stories at all.
“They're full of lies.” There was no change in his expression whatsoever.
“Yes, that's the one. That's the one with the least words, except for the flower stone. It looked fairly new too, so maybe that was grandpa? Is that right, dad?”
The first time he visited the National Gallery however, he was immediately taken by a landscape painting. It was hard to explain why it stood out among all the other beautiful paintings on display in the room. Abstractly, he could see that the paintbrushes were rough and unrefined, the different colours popping boldly like toy blocks, unlike Mother’s elegant favourites or the many paintings that adorned the walls of the Manor. Yet, the painting called out to him, and as he gazed upon it all he could feel was a quiet sense of happiness and peace. Right then and there, he told himself,
It had been years since he last physically heard of the name. The same could not be said about his dreams, which frequently featured a familiar blond boy, looking the same year after year as he did not age, his maddening smirk, his piercing eyes, the hitch in his breath when they held hands, the oddly metallic taste on the tip of his tongue, the scent of bergamot in his dampened hair. Ten years had not blurred any of his features and also had not erased the bitterness that his departure had left.
Malfoy got pregnant after two weeks.
Draco’s plan was to take Pansy to somewhere safe and then looked for Harry. Pansy, forever contradictory, did not want to let him go. Her hands gripped the back of his shirt tightly and she glared like a feral cat when he tried to pry her off, stubbornly holding on, despite knowing that there was nothing that either of them could do. Finally, he sneaked a Sleeping spell on her and handed her off to their Slytherin peers hiding in their Common Room, making them swear not to let her run off after him. He brushed a kiss over her forehead, apologised under his breath, then took off.
“Then why didn't our Healer suggest that to us in the first place?”
On the one hand, it felt like a weight off his shoulder, now that he had given words to his destiny and that someone outside of his immediate family knew.
It ended all too soon when the door creaked open again. Harry popped his head back in to find Malfoy bouncing their baby son happily, just like before. He walked back into the room, mumbled a half-hearted excuse at which Malfoy did not question, as if he had not heard him at all. “You seem tired”, Harry said as he weaved his fingers into the blond strands, the usually perfect hair now matted together with sweat. “You try giving birth to a baby this size, 'tired' doesn't even begin to describe it”, Malfoy retorted back, a grimace on his face. “You should lay down for a bit. I'll take him back to the Mediwitch”, Harry suggested as he reached out towards the baby.
"So you're saying that there is no way out of this, since we will never be able to find someone who will absolutely keep their mouth shut."
After that they stopped with the pretense. The next evening, Ginny went to The Burrow alone while Harry was caught up with work late and told her family the news. The couple started to go to frequent check-ups to monitor the development of the tumour growing in Ginny's uterus. Ginny started to take caseful of potion vials, although all they were good for was to numb the terrible clenching pain. Ginny's health started to deteriorate at a subtle speed, though recognisable, and sometimes Harry would stay up all night with her, holding her firmly in his arms as she whimpered in agony. Hermione dived head-first into researching, as she was wont to do, and their friends and family as well. Unfortunately, be it an unknown family curse or a particularly maligned cancer type, there was simply no cure. And Ginny grew progressively worse.
Later, when Albus dozed off once more, though Harry bet that he was only faking it to avoid the constant attention, the adults left the room and really breathed out in relief. Only then did they take in the presence of a young Auror waiting for them patiently in the corridor, looking as if he did not know if it was acceptable to interrupt the emotional moment of the Potter family. When Harry beckoned him towards them, the man seemed obviously relieved. He greeted them politely and asked the family to follow him, all the while recounting details of the accident. Apparently Albus' kindergarten class had a field trip down the river bank this morning. One moment when the teachers were looking elsewhere, the boy had ventured down the river with a couple of other children. It seemed to be purely an accident, but Albus fell into the river and was quickly submerged due to the strong current, even though the boy did know how to swim. While the teachers were calling for help and trying to calm the other children down, a man had jumped into the river after the child. After a while struggling with the current, he was able to bring the boy to shore. Fortunately the boy, while stiff frozen and hardly breathing, still had his heartbeat and was taken to St. Mungo's as fast as possible.
“So what, was I his punishment?”
“Is there something I missed?”
After a week, Harry received a reply from Malfoy on an invitation of a Friday drink. Then it was another drink next weekend, then a ticket to Quiddich, then it was dinner under candles and moonlight on the grounds of the Malfoy Manor. The affair commenced so quickly it almost give Harry whiplash until he recalled Malfoy's long-time crush for him. They started to go on proper dates, dates that were more like colleagues meeting up for a drink after work, dates that were more like friends relaxing out over a Quiddich game, all in secret of course, there was no need to make things complicated for a married man like Harry. Only that Harry tried to hold Malfoy's hand under the table and Malfoy kissing him on the mouth before he Apparated home. Then, it was only the matter of time before he got Malfoy into bed, Harry mused as he half-heartedly stared at the naked man lying next to him on the biggest bed in the Manor, breathing softly and hair matted to his forehead with sweat. It was almost too good to be true, really, that Harry had a hard time believing how successful Ginny's plan had been. When Ginny urged him to ask Malfoy for a baby, he told himself that this was it, this was when this would fail. He tried to stall for time, telling Ginny that it was too soon in the relationship to start talking about having a child, and what if Malfoy demanded a divorce when he thought Harry was getting serious?
“Those stupid Gryffindors must have rubbed off on you, you have never been this reckless.”
So he woke up.
Then he thought he heard someone chuckling and whispering back to him.
As Ginny felt the rumble from Harry's incensed yell above her head, she hushed him gently and snuggled up even closer to his chest. She assured that there was nothing he could do to make her stop loving him, she would not see it as an act of betrayal and she would rather prefer a child related to one of them than one of strange blood. She was certain that she would care for the child as if it was her own, and just because she could not have a child by blood did not mean that he would be deprived of that honour. But he did not wish a child from someone else, Harry cried, still failing to comprehend how Ginny could have thought of something so outrageous in the first place. Still, Ginny was nothing but stubborn and took it her mission to convince Harry night after night, whispering to him in desperation and urgency. By the end of the month, Harry finally yielded after one more night in the would-be nursery once again, Ginny sobbed into her husband's chest, “Please do it for me, Harry.”
Thus, it was the understatement of the century to say that Harry was only surprised, when one day after lunch he and Ron opened their joined office to find himself staring in the face of Draco Malfoy of all people. Even if said Draco Malfoy was accompanied by one Head of Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt, who seemed to be all too nonchalant about the presence of an ex-Death Eater in their mix. Kingsley, once spotted the men, went out to introduce the newest face of the Forensic Department, resolutely ignoring the deadly glares the ex-Gryffindors were aiming at the blond. All the while, Malfoy kept quiet and stood partially hidden behind Kingsley, flipping through a stack of paper like he was bored. As if it was no big deal.
“So it's fine if the recipient is willing?”
Then, Vincent killed Dumbledore.
, Harry thought,
Once, he finally burst into tears in front of his son.
The first few days following the diagnosis, Ginny acted as if nothing had happened. She woke up with a bright smile and hummed to herself as she made scrambled eggs in the kitchen, she kissed Harry good morning with a twinkle in her eyes, she joked over an article in
“Nobody told him. All these years and nobody told him…”
“Yes, dad, and ew, don't go into details, baby Scorp here is too young to know all of that!”
“Who was that man, dad, and how come we never meet him?”
Years went by and people moved on from the bloody horrors of the War. Things once seemed to important and relevant were no longer of concern, scandalous falls from grace left no more imprint than a vague memory. The Malfoys, like many of their peers, seemed to have faded from people’s mind. Last thing Harry heard, the family had moved to France. Not my business anymore, Harry thought as he left the other Aurors to their gossips. Really, no, he reminded himself, as he got on with his life, knowing that a boyish shadow was always at the back of his mind. A month after the tenth anniversary of the Hogwarts Battle, he heard through Ministry grapevines that someone had seen Lucius Malfoy in Diagon Alley just the week before. Sometime later, Hermione mentioned seeing Narcissa Malfoy with Pansy Parkinson in a café in Muggle London. Nobody mentioned Draco.
At the end of the day, he knew that she did not really understand. But that night, they snuck onto the roof of Pansy’s Aunt’s house where they were staying, dangling their feet over the edge of the building as they tilted back their heads and watched the country stars blinking brightly in the sky. When he felt Pansy’s hand curling up in his, he knew that she did not need to understand everything. This here, was enough.
“You do?”
Nights passed, yet Draco still did not come.
He could see Dumbledore’s mouth moving, could see his face shifted in a moue of sorrow, but the ringing in his ears had drowned out all sounds and he knew that all was lip service to him. Before he knew it, he had slammed a chair at the old Headmaster’s frame and Apparated out of the room, leaving behind the stunned silence of Dumbledore’s portrait and the alarmed voice of the Headmistress.
For one, Draco could not experience any of Potter’s physical pain. He did not feel it when Potter fell from his broom during Quiddich, or when Dementors swarmed all over him that time in Third Year, or that time when a newly-ressurected Dark Lord Crucioed him the year after that. He certainly did not feel any of Potter’s emotional pain, like when Cedric Diggory or Sirius Black died. The only time that Draco got a glimpse of the bond’s effect was sometime at the end of Second Year, during the midst of the Heir of Slytherin drama. It was one evening as he and the rest of his House were cluttered in their Common Room, trapped inside by curfew. One minute he was leaning by his favourite window, listening to Pansy chattering on about one thing or another, the next his energy was completely drained and his knees buckled like a stringless marionette. For a minute, his vision greyed out and he felt trapped within his skin, mind racing with confusion and fear, unable to associate his sudden bout of weakness with his link to Potter. Then, as quickly as it came, the feeling was gone, life surged back into his arms and legs as if someone had dosed him with a strong Pepper-Up, just in time to stop Pansy from alerting others. In the end, he gave Pansy an excuse he was sure she did not believe and made her promise not to tell a word.
They did not talk about this either. But then, they also did not talk about the kisses that followed.

When he couldn't comprehend her words, she dragged him to a bookstore and showed him the records on the Hanahaki epidemic in the Japanese wizarding world.
Draco raises an eyebrow, in challenge, trying to gauge what Potter is here for.
Been a while since I updated, the motivation just wasn't there. ((Haha pun on my username lol))

Draco stares at him. There’s no wriggling out of this. He doesn’t know what the
Harry laughs, “You’re an idiot. What do you think I'm doing here?” He leans closer to Draco, their faces just a few inches away, and looks at his lips. Draco’s eyes widen, and he pushes Harry’s face away, getting off the bed, to put some distance between them, hoping Harry cant see his strawberry red face.
Potter hums in thought "Alright then, How come I barely see you in the eighth year dorms?"
Draco nodded, and turned to his new quaffle and focused on turning it into a book. He closed his eyes and imagined a blank piece of paper, and adding a few more pages to it. He accomplished it in his first attempt. "Hey! That just isn't fair, tell me your secret, Malfoy, I’ve been trying for a while and you just swish around and produce a pristine notebook!" Potter huffed, pouty and adorable.
"That's certainly another thing to add to my mental list of things that befuddle me, but talking about that, I've got a question that could be slightly invasive, can I ask you?"
, why are you making yourself
"I...I’d rather master something hard and know that I can go easier from there, you know?"
“Why, Draco?” Potter asks, and Draco doesn’t have to fake confusion, “Why- what?”
He puts a steaming teacup on the cabinet, and walks towards the door drowsily. Pulling the door open he leans in to kiss his lover, who had many titles. The boy who lived, the boy who lived

Draco felt his ears turning red,
“You’re a fool,”

"What did I do wrong?" Draco huffed to himself. Weasely glanced at him and gave him a grim look, "wasn't your fault mate, thanks for getting rid of that cursed book" he gave Draco a tentative pat on his shoulder before walking back to Granger with a troubled look on his face.
"You look like you slept well," Blaise remarked, passing Draco the plate of Treacle tarts.
By the time professor McGonagall walked in, there was only one spot left in the room, at the very end of Draco’s row, which was quite the relief. He wouldn't be able to see Potter today. Maybe it wouldn't hurt so much.
They quickly pack up and head to the Great hall directly, parting ways to head to their respective tables.
Harry rubs a shaking hand over his face, “Just tell me who it is, so that I can move on, alright? And maybe prove that Hermione isn’t always right.”
Ron quickly shoots her a horrified look “Blimey! What the hell happened now that
was two beds away from him.
With twinkling eyes potter told him the tale of Hermione choosing to use a modified version of Obliviate on her parents, and then finding them in Australia to restore their memories after the war.
Half the class noticed and sent Draco dark looks.
Harry’s brows furrow in confusion and before he can say anything, Draco cuts him off, “Really, then, is that what this is? Another little puzzle for your world saving friends and you to solve?” he spits out.  Draco starts saying something more, but Harry interrupts, “Hermione thinks it’s me,” he says softly.
Rolling his eyes, he replied "Yes, I'm staying for the night, and it's nothing serious, so don't worry you pretty little head over it"
Blaise gives him a quizzical look "Draco, the disease is going to progress whether you're near them or not, because I'm guessing it began during the war and it progresses whether you're around them or not, it never came to a standstill during the holiday's did it? It progresses faster when you become hopeless. Trying to make them fall for you will give you a chance, and hope, along with the medication, that could slow down you're progression."
Draco stares at him, “Who… are you and where is
"So it's not a Slytherin," Blaise deduced, amused.
Harry was paralyzed, his heart was beating a mile a minute and he couldn't think. He felt faint, and he needS to get rid of this horcrux replica before he begins losing his mind. He could feel snakes and spiders already crawling across his skin. A touch on his shoulder broke him out of his reverie "Potter, are you really that surprised that you accomplished this?" Malfoy questioned
Harry can’t believe it, he cannot. Physically cannot, he rushes back to the common room, and stumbles into Ron, “There you are! How could you not wake me up? I was just bout to miss Potions. Everybody’s already in the great hall”
Harry pulls Draco’s sleeve in response.
He knocks at the infirmary door and lets himself in, "Draco, here for the coughs again? This is getting a little out of hand, you should reconsider my offer to make a thorough evaluation."
