“Alright, three, two, one, and, action!” Harry pressed record and stepped back as Draco started to play.
“Of course.” He knew he didn’t have to warn Fleur like he did the twins, and sure enough as soon as Molly handed him over, she cradled him gently against her, stroking her fingers against him softly.
“I’ll suck your dick.” The boy offered and Harry almost fell off his chair, he startled so badly. Looking the boy up and down, he certainly wasn’t…. against the idea. He’d realized he liked men as well as women when he was thirteen, but he’d never exactly had much of a chance to experiment with it. Most of the boys at St Brutus’ were violently homophobic, and so certainly couldn’t fool around with any of them, and the only other people he even saw were the guards.
“You’re a liar, girl! You were born a girl, and you will always be a girl!” Uncle Vernon stepped towards him and grabbed him by the scruff of the neck, pulling him out of the kitchen and shoving him to the ground outside his cupboard. He was only down for a second before the white-hot pain of Uncle Vernon’s belt lanced through his back, whipping him bloody and tearing at his shirt. He was glad he hadn’t put on his binder yet- he couldn’t afford to replace it if it was ruined- it had taken months of saving every bit of money he came across before he could even buy this one.
"Okay, you're okay, come here." Harry felt himself be pulled against Draco's chest and wrapped his arms around his waist. Draco slowly guided them into one of the alcoves nearby and leaned against the wall, holding Harry tight and letting him cry heavily against him. When Harry started to calm down, Draco spoke again. "What happened?"
He started at the shoes, picking out multiple pairs that he thought would look nice with his new outfits- mostly he chose high tops, because when he tried them on they felt far more comfortable, although he did get two pairs of low-top vans, one in pink and the other in blue.
“Professor McGonagall.” The man greeted, his voice creaky and old, but kind. “And this must be Harry.”
“Aw! ‘Oo iz zis?!” She smiled warmly and reached over, stroking her delicate finger down Teddy’s nose.
Remus burst out laughing then, shaking almost uncontrollably as he tried to catch his breath. “Oh my god, Harry.
“Uh, okay, great, thank you. I’m just down the road from the manor, I’m almost at the entry to the Forbidden Forest.”
Harry just rolled his eyes- he’d heard far more inventive comments at Stonewall. “So, McClaggen, I hear you’re secretly a bigot, then?”
Nym smiled at him good naturedly and pulled him into a quick hug, resting their chin on his head. “No problem, kid.”
The sun had gone down an hour ago at least, but Harry kept walking. He had made it at least to the next town over, and he was exhausted, but he really had nowhere else to go. He was resigned to continuing well into the night, when an old-fashioned black car pulled up beside him. As the back door opened, revealing a tall, pale man with a moustache, he whipped the knife out of his boot.
Platform 9 ¾ was possibly more crowded than Harry had ever seen it, and there were reporters all over the place- they all kept trying to talk to Harry or snap photographs of him, and he had to dig his fingernails into his palms to stop himself from screaming. It was just too much. It was even worse when he got onto the Hogwarts express and Hermione and Ron had to disappear into the prefects' cabin- McGonagall had agreed that the 'eighth year' students who would have been perfects during their seventh year would retain their prefect status, with the exception of Draco. Harry tried to find any of his friends on the train, but it seemed they had all congregated into one cabin- Luna and Ginny, Neville, Dean and Seamus, along with Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones from Hufflepuff were crowded into the seats, leaving no room for Harry.
"Okay, sweetheart. Do you want to finish up here or go home? There's just this floor and the next one left." Hermione asked him.
“Yes.” Harry wanted to laugh at the pained expression on his best friend’s face when he confirmed that fact.
“Fuck yes.” Draco pulled Harry back in for another bruising kiss before standing up and leading Harry back towards the house, their hands entwined. Sirius’ car was gone and Andi, Ted and Nym had all retreated to their rooms, and so no one noticed when Draco pushed Harry lightly into his bedroom and down onto the bed, both kicking off their shoes, socks and jeans and curling up together under Draco’s heavy duvet, their kisses slowly going from hot and fervent to slow and sweet to barely-there touching of lips as they both fell asleep.
Harry was stunned- he’d always been told the Dursleys had been the only option, when his entire life he could have been living with someone else entirely? “Can- can you call them, please?” He asked.
Draco snorted and ran his silver-grey eyes up and down Harry’s body. “I suppose you’re in need of a new tutor, hm?”
“Right. Of course, you can stay here as long as you need. I’m sure Harry will be happy to share his room.”
“I’m so glad you’re here, love. I always said Narcissa was daft for marrying that man, but ah well. Nym!” She turned to her child. “Grab Draco’s stuff and take it to his room! Your dad’s on his way home and I’m sure he’ll want to meet Draco too.” Nym grabbed the three items from the backseat and Andromeda frowned. “Is that all you fetched?”
He had made sure he had plenty of more socially acceptable pieces, although they were mostly still in pastel colours, which he found himself much more drawn to than the bright colours- they made him feel more soft and comfortable, whereas the bright colours just felt wrong, and he was sure that he could probably pass off even a few of the more 'little' clothes he'd picked, like a few t-shirts for cartoons he'd been enjoying, or a few plush jackets modelled after characters or animals, as fashion choices, but some of them he knew he would probably never wear out of his house - that was okay, though, because he could still enjoy wearing them at home.
Hermione took over again. “Oh, it’s horrible, really! Ron’s sister’s girlfriend, Luna, she’s his cousin and they’re rather close I think, so she told me all about it. Apparently because Malfoy’s autistic, his father wanted him to make sure it was kept a secret as to ‘increase his chances for a good marriage’, and so when one of the Hufflepuffs, Zacharias Smith, found out and spread it all over the school, his father found out and, well, he got very angry. He started yelling at Malfoy for ‘allowing something like this to sully our good name’ and then started going on about how much harder it would be to find him a good wife now, and then apparently Malfoy yelled that he was gay and not to bother, and that’s when his father told him he would be disowned, which is why he lives with Professor Snape now.”
Harry checked the time, but it was almost 6PM- the shop would be closed. He checked the next day's opening times and set a Tempus charm to wake him up at 8AM so he could go as soon as they opened.
“You know, Draco, that’s actually a really good song.” Andi smiled at him. “Do you know what you should do?” He cocked his head. “Record it and get all your friends to send it to him.” She winked devilishly.
"They're much nicer than your old clothes, don't you agree?" He nodded again. "Have you allowed yourself to regress again in the past week?"
“I don’t understand why you’re sticking up for it, Draco, you used to be better than this.” One of the boys, Nott, Harry thought, said.
“Excellent point, darling. Let’s go.” The three of them crowded into Mils’ car and she drove them to their favourite smoke spot, just on the edge of the Forbidden Forest not far from Draco’s family manor.
Harry smiled amusedly. "I wonder if they'll talk to your dad. He'll probably try and insist I kidnapped you or something."
“Malfoy…. Andi was killed this morning.” He knew it came out too blunt, but he had no idea how one was supposed to break that sort of news.
“That’s ridiculous. I mean, I knew she was mental already, but Merlin. I’m definitely glad Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon are muggles; I think the cruciatus would be the only spell they’d like.”
“Can you just tell me what it is you’re trying to do?” Harry had asked at least twice a week, and every time Draco had rebuffed him the same way.
Draco moved one of his hands, pressing it against his forehead theatrically. “My entire reputation, my years of hard work and carefully cultivated cruelty, shattered! All by one cute boy!” He spoke with a level of drama Harry was sure even Sirius would envy.
“Okay, Harry, that’s your table.” Remus pointed to the far-left table, where Harry’s eyes instantly landed on the most beautiful person he’d ever seen. He was clearly tall, even sat down, with white blond hair, grey eyes and a sharp, angular face. Everything about him seemed cold and aristocratic, but somehow it was the most attractive thing he’d ever seen. He headed towards the table, sitting down across from a Pug-faced girl with a severe black bob.
“Really?” Harry almost didn’t want to get his hopes up- it hadn’t even occurred to him that Sirius and Remus might consent for him to start T.
Clearly something he said must have been correct, because her stern expression gave way for a genuine smile. "You should tell him that. Now, Ron, let's go."
“Morning, Harry. Morning, Moonpie.” Sirius sat down on the arm of Remus’ chair and took a sip of his coffee.
He smiled a bit at that. “No thanks, love. Although, if you know any way to get everyone to stop staring at me, that would be appreciated.” He opened his eyes and looked briefly around the courtyard, until his eyes settled on his cousin, Luna, heading towards him with her girlfriend Ginevra in tow. Her father was his father’s disowned older brother, and everyone always thought she was a bit mad, but he’d realized pretty early on that you just had to interpret her.
Ron looked at the smalls and then back at his friend, realizing that they would almost definitely go all the way down to his knees. "Are you sure you wouldn't be better with a smaller size?"
Harry considered briefly before nodding. “Just don’t drop him.” He handed the baby over to George, who already had his arms out to take him. Teddy blinked his big golden-brown eyes at him, scrunched his face up and turned his little hairs orange. Harry laughed.
Harry had been at the police station for almost 9 hours when his godfathers showed up, and it was almost pitch-black outside. Shacklebolt had sent officers to take pictures of his cupboard at the Dursleys’ for his file a few hours ago, and, feeling exhausted by his statement, he’d fallen asleep not long after, curled up in his hard plastic chair. Mx Greenfeld was still with him, and they had insisted that they would stay until his godfathers arrived.
The rest of the week passed uneventfully, between classes where he’d already taught himself everything, hanging around with Ron and Hermione, and at the weekend he joined Remus in going home to visit Sirius. He settled into a routine fairly easily, and before he knew it a month had passed.
When they got home that evening, Harry just waved a hand to put all of their shopping away and dropped down onto the sofa as Draco unlatched Teddy from his pram and headed into the kitchen to make him a quick bottle. Once that was sorted, the blond sat himself on the other end of the sofa, feeding Teddy and toeing off his boots.
“Ok, I’ll uh call or we could go to dinner.” Harry suggested hopefully. Draco’s eyes went wide and his jaw twitched.
sink so low as to be homophobic. But then he realized that left the other option and he wasn’t ready to admit that, so his words were a stumbling mess.
“I simply came in here to freshen up. I was feeling stifled.” He fought the urge to lift his chin up even more and cross his arms across his chest. Instead he narrowed his eyes and asked, “Is there something you were in need of?” Potter’s earlier confidence seemed to disappear and a look of confusion crossed his face.  “It’s not a difficult question.” Draco patronized, old habits die hard.
The tea will go cold if not consumed. Harry pulls back the rest and maybe Malfoy is watching his throat as he swallows. Harry presses down the heat this brings.
: Harry finds it of course it’s too close to home. Vision oscillating between Annabeth—kept, unclean—and his own crouched form, abused in quiet ways.
Harry tries to avoid the red on the ground as he approaches. It may not be real—but he doesn’t want to be stained. Alan finds a leather-bound journal, left open to an entry:
And though he hates to be scolded, and is used to the sight of his own blood, Harry obeys. Something in the tone, maybe. He is careful and holds his finger perpendicular and walks off to find a loo.
“Oh. It’s blue, for me.” Malfoy circles a finger around the rim of his glass. “The poolwater. Theo’s eyes. It was the most I
Draco left bed that morning agitated, grumbling about errands and this and that, about lovers too lazy for normal breakfasting hours, for a well-brewed morning cup. Harry watched him as he dressed, fingers quick and lithe on shirt-buttons, brow puckered in a half-formed frown. To watch Draco was to drown in the pink slip of early morning; Harry never stood a chance. Not warm under sheets, remembering. Not being scolded for watching, chided for the too-long kiss, all tongue and hot throats, voices waking up.
Malfoy blinks. He’s cleaned himself of all debris, all the dust and residue. Hair combed back neatly. “Alright, then. We’ll sit in silence.”
He falters, tugged; stops mid-step. The others murmur in low tones, perhaps discussing where they start, how to go about repairs. Harry feels his fingers flexing in and out. Tucked into his back pocket, his wand gives a small vibration.
“Rumor to fact! Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are dating.” Dean said, his voice taking on the tone of a news reporter off the telly.
“Harry, you won’t believe the madhouse it was out there!  I made it just in time, these were the last three packages of toilet paper in the entire grocery aisle.  Not to mention how bare the meat department was getting. I might have gone slightly overboard, but I don’t want to have to go back.”
“Only this has to be ten times worse, with all of Quidditch cancelled until who knows when.”  Draco said, his brow furrowed into what looked like genuine worry.
“Not even for the children?” Malfoy said, giving Harry an astonished look. “What will my dear cousin think? His own Godfather won’t help to raise money for orphaned children.”
When they got back from flying, Draco seemed to be in better spirits.  It had even been twenty minutes since he had mentioned anything about the virus or self isolation and Harry thought that a little distraction was all he needed.  That idea quickly died.  As soon as they set foot in the house, Draco made his way straight to the wireless.
“Thank you, Lovely.” He said, taking the drink from her gloved hand, the glove elegantly covering the numerous ink smudges her fingers were stained with.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “They didn’t. I intercepted Draco’s mail this morning.” Draco didn’t even act surprised or that he cared.
Draco, wasn’t pleased at all by the article in the Prophet. Although it had caught his good angle, the reminder to the world that he was a former death eater, was not welcome. And he was afraid it would scare Potter off.  Draco decided he was going to spend the day in bed, or at least that was the plan. But as usual his plan didn't go like it was supposed to, someone always came along and ruined them. Today it was Pansy. She apparated over, with a pop.
Harry pulled out two slices of bread to make a sandwich.  He was going to ask Draco if he wanted one, but noticed he already had a plate of food in front of him that was still untouched.
“That’s what Mione says.” Ron said, shaking his head as if surrounded by fools. “She actually brushes them and then charms them too.”
Harry heard the ancient front door of Grimmauld Place creak open and then slam closed.  Draco was always overzealous with his wandless magic.  Harry padded into the entry still barefoot and in his pajamas to see if he needed any help with the groceries.  Draco had left earlier that morning saying he was going to stock up for the next few weeks of mandatory self isolation.  This new virus was throwing the whole country into a panic, both wizarding and muggle.  Harry stopped short, when he came around the corner and couldn’t see Draco behind the wall of toilet paper he was carrying.
“No, you can keep your ungrateful hands off my supplies.”  He huffed and headed to the kitchen, his items bobbing and twitching behind him to match his indigent attitude.
Draco rolled his eyes.  “It’s not a big deal Potter.” Draco walked over and saved the silk swatch that Potter was twisting, into a wrinkled death. He cast a quick ironing charm at it and put it back. “You are either homophobic or gay and still uncomfortable with it. Which is it?” Draco stared at a surprised looking Potter. As he stumbled trying to convince Draco that he was not in fact homophobic. The heroic, chosen one, would never
Ron held his silence and shrugged awkwardly. Harry didn’t miss the telling sign that Ron wasn’t telling him something. Usually when Ron had something he wasn’t saying he over compensated by saying nothing. Harry leapt to his feet and side stepped Hermione to stand directly in front of Ron.  “What are you not telling me?” He was trying for demanding, but he only sounded obsessively curious.
“For three years. In which he has done a marvelous job of not acknowledging me as well. I once rode the elevator with him for eleven floors and he didn’t even look my way a single time.”
“No, but with them both home and not working they will start driving each other up the wall.  They’ll fight, Ron will end up on my sofa, then he will go home and apologise, they’ll make up and that’s how babies are made.”
Harry had been surprised when he showed up to the second practice wearing actual training gear. The color plain brown and his shirt loose fitting, hauling a bundle of pads behind him. The most surprising thing of all was the bright red ring around his neck that he wasn’t even trying to cover. Harry had painstakingly been reading everything written about Rubert’s disease and the sight of the cursed ring left him unsettled. Draco had looked confident and determined when he entered and Harry had later admitted he had looked even better than usual, when it was clear that for once he wasn’t even trying to.
Blaise had his camera up and his finger on the button. He hesitated, before lowering his camera again, with a pout on his face.  “But if there isn’t a picture than it’s like it didn’t happen.” He complained. Draco rolled his eyes.
“I was drunk, but that didn’t mean I didn’t like you.  It meant that I was drunk enough to actually have the courage to do something about it.”
“To your bedroom?” Potter waved a hand at the neatly made bed, then looked away as if it were indecent for him to see it.
Two days later, people weren’t calming down as Harry had hoped.  If anything they were getting crazier, feeding off of each other’s worry and panic.  Harry came down from his room for lunch to find Draco hunched over the wireless, giving updates to George every few minutes while he sorted stacks of forms.
“It’s been hours since I’ve had an update.  I need to stay informed.”  Draco tried ducking under Harry’s arm, but Harry moved to block him again and a small skirmish broke out in the doorway to the kitchen.
Of all the things he didn’t need today, Draco Malfoy appearing in his department wasn’t one of them. He had gotten woken up at 5 this morning with owls sending letters. Mostly owls of outrage. Some with letters of encouragement. He would feel more encouraged if the owls had not woken him up. He needed to get a P.O Box, Personal Owlery Box. Then he could get his mail at his convenience, not at the crack of dawn. He would go set one up after work. With the article in the Daily Prophet he would need it.
“Yes. It could perhaps be strong enough to break the curse. If we don’t tell anyone then I think the danger would be minimal.” She said, looking at Harry skeptically and looking at Draco as if she were hoping he would keep it a secret.
Pansy leaned forward, looking mildly impressed and holding her empty glass out expectantly for Draco to fill for her.
“I bet on You and Draco.”  She said, batting her eyes.  “And Greengrass and Smith.  There was no way that was going to last.”
“Perfect timing!  Maybe you can help me, I was thinking a shade of teal.” Pansy pounced on the color samples, flipping by each color, with a trained eye.
“Who among us isn’t stuck with a skeleton, stuck inside a body?” Harry teases in a yellow sunshiney kitchen. Draco making eggs, pouring juice. Domesticity draped like a promise. “It’s not enough to ask for death. We must dig our own graves.”
“Shut up.” Malfoy bites at his shoulder, tongue soothing the spot—and this is how it will proceed, no doubt; a burn followed by balm. “
It’s a practical luxury, Harry thinks, to own the Muggle car. Something he associates with leaving, with getting out, with being able to go. Without a thought or plan. He sometimes works himself into such a knot, pulled so tight, that he gets in and just goes—all the way out of the city. Stops in the country, where the sky and the land are two wide, unbroken bands. Sits down in wet grass and breathes.
They meet in a bar and he’s wearing a black jumper that makes his pale neck glow; there’s a ring on his left pinky finger. Thin gold, with the glint of an engraving. A signet, perhaps. Harry has never been close enough to see.
“Well, sure,” Harry shrugs, in an effort to rid any of the hysteria buzzing in the tips of his fingers, snapping at his throat. He shrugs again, quickly, for emphasis. “Why not? All needs doing, sometime.”
“No, earlier.” Which is both a lie and the truth; he is thinking of him, always. “I was eating peanut butter and thinking of you.”
“And Parkinson, you’ll know,” Malfoy murmurs as the group rounds a corner, street narrowed down to a single cobblestoned lane, buildings transitioning into a clutter of dead-faced flat buildings and snub-nosed half-homes. Pansy Parkinson turns, and Harry didn’t recognize her, not at all—slick black hair cut at her chin, eyelids lined in lime-green. Wearing swingy linen pants. And her eyes, nervous, like Harry might lunge forward, shake her by the shoulders.
But Ron—like Harry, like Hermione, like the rest—had come to a kind of peace, in recent years. And maybe it’s the peace that makes him say, “I trust you,” and nod, as though to reassure himself of this, too. “I trust you.”
The magic in this house was gentle, and then: An infestation. Moldy magic, bursting; an incident, an object, a curse. Harry feels an echo of the people in the house; the cut of their pain as the magic infested first their bodies, then their home.
Malfoy drags him to his feet, fretting, angry, tugging him to the en suite. “Really, it’s fine.” Harry betrays himself; likes the feel of Malfoy’s arm around his waist. “This happens all the time.”
She quickly dialed 999 and put the phone to her ear. “Hello, yes, this is the Headmistress of Stonewall High, we have a student who has been stabbed by a fellow student, please send an ambulance and the police.” Harry couldn’t hear the response but he looked down at his shoes and scowled. Her facial expression told him all he needed to know. Hanging up the phone, she turned back to Harry. “Harry Potter, correct?” He nodded, his narrow shoulders tense. “Now, your relatives informed me of your tendency to… embellish the truth, so lets just wait for the police to arrive and they can speak with you.”
Ginny looked resigned as Luna responded brightly, "Of course, Draco! Your wrackspurts are clearing up nicely, although the adora moths are still dense around your ears." Harry had never heard of adora moths, but he had long since learned to just go with what Luna said instead of questioning it. Draco, though, seemed to know exactly what she meant.
"Well, they're idiots then. And really, you, the next Tom Riddle? You're far too smart for that, although if you ever tell anyone I said that I'll deny it."
“Malfoy? Are you okay?” Draco had been half expecting Harry to make fun of him, even though he knew logically that the other man would never do that, and so was shocked by the gentle concern on his handsome, square face. Draco opened his mouth to speak, but instantly knew it was futile, and closed it again. He shrugged.
on the opening to remove any traces of blood and he let it close back up, turning back to the mirror to scrub the blood off of his skin.
Remus smiled. “If you want.” When Harry grinned he turned back towards Sirius. “Pads, Harry wants a piercing too.”
kisser.” Harry took a bit of sadistic pleasure in tacking that on the end, barely restraining himself from full-on laughter at the sight of his friend’s misery.
It was almost a week since most of the boys left when someone finally came to sort out Harry’s arraignments. Officer McKinnon arrived with two men and headed straight to Harry’s room.
“You’re not a Slytherin, ergo, you’re at the wrong table.” She spoke to him as if he were a moron when he’d be willing to place money on his being smarter than her.
Alaistor nodded weakly and slumped to the floor, dizzy from the blood loss. “I just wanted to know what wood it was.”
combined with the magic from a time turner was his most inspired idea yet, if he did say so himself, and if he could somehow prevent the entire second war….
Draco cleared his throat softly and started reading. "The night Max wore his suit and made mischief of one kind and another his mother called him 'WILD THING!'..."
He checked the time on his phone – 5:45PM, so he had about half an hour before dinner. He made his way as quickly as possible to his suite and threw a single change of clothes, all of his comfy boxers and socks, his laptop, his headphones and all of his cables into his school bag along with as many of his toiletries as he could fit. He then dropped the bag, along with his guitar and amp, by the door, and headed towards the dining hall. Somehow, he was still the last one to the table, with both his mother and father settled in their seats. Almost as soon as he sat down, his favourite servant, Dobson (or Dobby, as Draco had nicknamed him as a child) started serving them their meals. Draco’s eyes lit up as his favourite bouillabaisse was sat in front of him, and with none of the propriety his father expected of him, he tucked in immediately, groaning as he took the first bite.
“I- no, I’m a 10. Are you really sure about this?” Draco looked as if he was half expecting Harry to rescind his offer at any moment.
As soon as Harry got home he grabbed his laptop and headed to his bedroom. He got changed into his pyjamas, curled up and powered it on, anxiously rubbing his thumb over his chewed bottom lip.
“Boy! Up!” Harry dragged himself up off of the tiny cot in his cupboard and made his way into the kitchen where his Aunt Petunia was waiting for him, her shoe tapping impatiently on the tiled floor and a wooden spoon held in one bony hand. “You ought to have already been up and making breakfast, you terrible, freakish little boy!” She smacked his head with the spoon hard enough that his ears rang. “Now, get on with it! You need to have a full plate of pancakes ready before my Dudders gets downstairs. He needs to be at Smeltings by 8, so no dawdling! Do you understand?” She snapped harshly.
“Oh, I didn’t know. When they were pregnant. I actually now know a rather ridiculous number of protective spells for pregnant people and babies thanks to that, although she never did actually come after them.”
When the police finally arrived, it was a hard-faced, attractive man who approached them, his partner only two steps behind.
Smith’s eyes were wide as he saw Harry’s body, and he forewent his shower completely in favour of running back up to the castle to tell his friends what he had seen.
“Locked me up, smacked me about a bit.” He shrugged again, awkward. He didn’t particularly like talking about the Dursleys, but he sort of wanted Draco to know. “My bedroom ‘till Hogwarts was the cupboard under the stairs, then I had my cousins second bedroom each summer. And Aunt Petunia is the reason I get the migraines.”
“Right. Yeah. Alright.” I nodded, standing up and making my way back over to Draco’s side, smothering a grin when he immediately reached out and took my hand again.
Draco felt his face flush. “I-no. There is someone I have feelings for, and have done since my first year at Hogwarts, but he doesn’t-” Draco cut himself off, shrugging and dropping his eyes to his lap.
Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy of the notorious gang Death Eaters, has apparently captivated the ministry's own Harry Potter, the youngest ever member of the so-called 'Hit Department' in the department of law enforcement.
"Don't forget to get some underwear and socks, Harry." Hermione reminded him gently when he seemed to be entirely ignoring that section.
Harry was surprised, however, that Draco Malfoy said nothing. Certainly, he wasn’t about to join the Harry Protection Squad, nor was he being even close to nice, but his sneering comments and taunts remained the same as always, with not even a hint of the transphobia his housemates displayed. Harry was suspicious of this, wondering if it was all some joke leading up to something terrible, but Hermione told him he was just being paranoid, and he tried to make it a rule to listen to her.
Still giggling, she handed it over and slumped back against the wall of the abandoned girl’s bathroom. “You’re no fun.”
“I- Aunt Petunia- I just-” he took a deep, steadying breath. “Once I overheard Aunt Petunia and Aunt Marge talking about someone not even being killed by the electricity, and I’d assumed they were talking about someone on the telly, but now…”
Draco woke up the next morning to a soft, warm weight on his chest. Harry's head was laid on his sternum, his mouth slightly open and one arm and leg thrown over his body. His hair was somehow even messier than usual, and the pacifier he'd had in his mouth when he fell asleep had somehow disappeared during the night.
years once already, so he was 2 years older than the rest of his year. He harassed and belittled Harry every single time he saw him, and had even once threatened to rape him to “prove he was really a girl”, which had earned him a detention from his own head of house, and the only instance anyone had ever seen of Snape taking points from Slytherin.
“…It’s not like we all don’t already know you ain’t got a cock, tranny.” Draco flinched at the disgusting drivel Flint was spouting.
By the time the bell rang to signal the end of the day, he could feel himself starting to sober up and he was not happy about it; he definitely didn’t want to have to be sober for dinner that evening. He grabbed his bag and headed out to the carpark to meet up with Pansy and Mils, who were stood snogging against Mils’ Audi.
They’d been wrapped up together for a few hours when Draco’s body started shaking, not too severely but bad enough for Harry to notice. “Are you alright?” His voice was deep and laced with concern, which made Draco melt inside.
“At least sixth year, that’s when I realized, but probably longer. I’ve definitely liked you since at least third.”
As he heard the car pull into the driveway, Harry moved quickly to hide by the front door, so that when it opened Uncle Vernon wouldn’t see him immediately, and then he could strike. It worked perfectly. The door swung open, and his uncle walked straight past him yelling “Boy, why can’t I smell dinner cooking?” and Harry pounced, jabbing his knife into the back of his knee- Harry had been stealing books from his cousin and the library and teaching himself to read since he was three, and he knew from the anatomy book he’d stolen that there was an artery that would make him bleed out rapidly there. His uncle turned as he went down, screaming and reaching out to grab at Harry, who took advantage of his small stature to dodge at scramble up the stairs, sitting himself at the top and watching as Vernon clawed his way towards the closed living room door, but when he reached it and pulled it open only to be met by the sight of his dead wife and son, he passed out. The blood pooled around Vernon in a macabre puddle, and Harry made his way back down the stairs and slashed his knife across both of his uncle’s eyes, splitting them open, before he dropped the knife and turned to go back upstairs.
Harry woke up on the most comfortable, nice smelling pillow he'd ever felt. His pacifier had disappeared some point during the night, as usual, but he was still clutching his teddy bear in one hand.
"Y-yes pwease." Harry's voice was small, younger sounding than Draco had ever heard it, and he felt something inside him melt- every fiber of his being was screaming at him to look after this precious boy, and he certainly wasn't going to argue. Harry took his hand as they headed out into the corridor, and Draco squeezed it reassuringly.
He walked into the dressing room and carefully hung each item up ready to try them on, and with each outfit, as soon as he looked in the mirror he grinned- this was him, this was what he looked like.
Harry groaned. “Christ, you’re so pretty.” He pressed a kiss to the pointy end of Draco’s nose, which made him scrunch it up cutely. “But yes, absolutely. I love you, and that means you’re never getting rid of me.”
"Right, good, I suppose. I have a feeling they'd both hex me otherwise." Draco remarked, and Harry cracked a lopsided grin.
“Uhm, injections, I guess.” Harry remembered seeing somewhere that pills, patches and gels were all daily options, and he had a feeling he’d be likely to forget them, so injections seemed far more sensible for him.
It was nice, having people support him, and when the taunts got too much he could just go to Remus’ suite and spend time with him. Plus, McGonagall continued to turn a blind eye to his friends’ actions against the people making transphobic comments, and barely followed up when Smith was hospitalised after being beaten bloody and having both arms broken (Seamus had confided in Harry that it was “So the wanker can’t wank”, which made him laugh loudly in the middle of Spanish class.)
“Yup. It’s a bloody good thing I already know all of it, cause otherwise I’d be bloody screwed- his desk is right in front of mine and you know how bloody tiny Sev’s classroom is, he’s so close I can bloody smell his aftershave.” Draco groaned, tapping out his pipe into the sink and shoving it back into his backpack.
Potter's friends, head of the department of law enforcement Ronald Weasley and Weasley's wife, researcher Granger of the University of Cambridge, have repeatedly insisted that Potter would never take over as the UK's most dangerous criminal, however Potter is no stranger to violence or questionable morals, and so his new-found relationship with a known criminal such as Malfoy brings these claims into question.
When they reached the great hall, Remus guided Harry to a tall teacher dressed in all black, with sallow skin, greasy black hair hanging down to his collar and a large, hooked nose. “Harry, this is Professor Snape. Severus, this is Harry Potter. He’ll be one of your Slytherins.”
. You and Sirius aren’t related by blood, and besides, even if you were, you’d still only be second cousins, and so were Sirius’ parents.” Remus teased.
“I-oh. Okay. Good.” Draco’s pale cheeks were flushed pink, and it was beautiful. He took my hand again. “We should probably head back to the tower.” I just nodded and followed him out into the corridor. About half way back to the eighth-year tower, the sounds of the busy hallways got to be too much for me again, and I used my free hand to pull Draco’s ear defenders back up, stepping closer to him unconsciously.
“pequeño, I was wondering if you needed help.” The man reached out as if to clap Harry’s shoulder, but the young boy ducked and held his knife to his throat before he could make contact.
When Harry made his way in to the great hall for dinner, once again fully dressed, he was confused at the stares and snickers he was receiving. He took his usual seat between Ron and one of the other Gryffindors, a chubby blond boy called Neville, and leaned over to his best friend.
Ron and Hermione were standing talking to the sales assistant while Harry got started on picking out clothes.
“You don’t need to leave, Draco.” She gave him that smile he could never quite understand- it seemed like it might be fond, but for all he knew it could be pity or even entirely false.
“Yeah. Just take a shower and come to my room, I’ll pick out some stuff that should fit you. What size shoe are you?”
"They absolutely were not. There is nothing about age regression that makes you a 'freak'. If you met another little would you think they were a freak?"
Harry wasn’t sure how to answer- he usually had 6, because it was almost all he could get away with stealing at the Dursleys to keep him going, but he supposed he didn’t need to do that anymore. “Uhm, two?”
They were leaning into one another, giggling and watching the sun set, when Harry looked up at Draco. The last bits of sunlight were dancing over his angular, pale features in just the right way and Harry couldn’t even think before his mouth was moving.
“If Molly hadn’t already done it, I’d go out and kill her right now.” His voice was dark, and it sent a twisted thrill through Draco.
“Hey, hey, you’re okay. I’m here. Deep breath, come on, follow my breathing.” Harry softened his voice and made sure that he was taking deep, clear breaths. Can I touch you?” Draco nodded, taking a shuddery breath, and Harry reached out, splaying one hand over his shoulder and wrapping the other around his forearm gently. “Okay, come on, in and out.”
“Of course, my apologies. Mr Potter, it seems your actual guardians were initially declined custody of you due to their being a homosexual couple, however they are still listed as your primary guardians in the system, so if both you and they are amenable, they will be able to take you in.”
Draco just rolled his eyes and put the pipe to his lips, holding his lighter over the half-burned weed and taking a deep breath in. a few seconds later he exhaled, intentionally blowing the smoke back into Pansy’s face and sniggering as she scrunched up her already upturned nose. “I need this more than you, you slag.”
The outside of the store had been nondescript - large, but with a neutral coloured sign and nothing to give away the wonders inside. It was tall, with multiple floors, but that was the only thing that stood out even a little.
“Dray, can I put some eyeliner on you? It’d look dope as hell, I promise.” Draco barely even had to think about it before nodding- why the fuck not! “Killer.” She grabbed what honestly just looked like a pencil to Draco and dragged it along his waterlines. Once she was done, he turned to look in their mirror.
“Fine by me.” Draco stood and made his way out, stopping when he got to his things. He slung his backpack over one shoulder and his guitar bag over the other, and was about to pick up his amp when the tell-tale clacking of his mother’s heels sounded behind him.
“Oh, Harry. Come on, sit down, I’ll get you a cuppa. Ron and Hermione will be back soon, I’ve just sent them out for some meat for dinner.” She ushered him into one of the armchairs near the fire. “I reckon I’ve still got some of my old baby books in the attic, I’ll dig them out for you after dinner.”
“Yep. I reckon we should take the knight bus to Diagon, get whatever we need there and then head out to muggle London. Is that okay with you?”
“Might have.”  Pansy and Nott both said at the same time.  Then Pansy gave a grin that made her look pure evil for a second.  “I placed one bet on who I thought would end up a couple by the end of this and a second on who I thought would split up by the end of this.”
Potter choosing to ignore the jab, continued as if not hearing him. “I cross referenced some things. The charity wasn’t contacted until days after you came to get your permit. The venue wasn’t rented until after, the catering services weren’t scheduled.”
“Dunno Mate. Maybe in school, his fighting with you was his way of flirting. And now he’s older, he’s figured out there’s a better way.”
When Harry went to put away the condiments he had used on his sandwich, he noticed that the fridge had been reorganized and cleaned.  “Did you clean out the fridge?”
Draco adjusted the collar of the dark green robes he was wearing. It was nice to have an excuse to wear green again; he wanted to show his support for the Harpies since he was going to be sitting on their side. He wore a black muggle t shirt underneath he thought it would appeal to Harry’s tastes. He did ask him to the game after all when he was wearing a muggle shirt and jeans.
Draco put on an easy smile, getting along with Potter’s best mates would be a big step in the right direction.  “Hello, Weasley and Granger.” He greeted holding a hand out. Both accepted his hand with a shake, Granger's a little firmer than Weasley's, Draco noted.
Once he made it to the ministry he was greeted by cat calls from Dean and for some reason Ginny. He wanted to go home and owl a sick note to his boss. It wouldn’t be a lie, he was feeling rather ill.
“I think you might be right.” Harry commented out of the blue. He shuffled a piece of fish around on his plate, in a distracted manner.
“Well I have a few more ideas, but they are less solid and I really don’t think we need to consider them yet. I will leave these here.” She said pointing at the stack of books on the end table.
Potter let out a sigh of frustration. Honestly, he needed a keeper. Someone that wouldn’t let him leave the house wearing...well anything he owned. Draco had turned down every suggestion Potter had made for good reason.  “Your input is valued, Potter.” Draco gave Potter a light pat on the shoulder, letting his fingers linger slightly. “You just need a point in the right direction.”
Potter wasn’t gone long before Draco heard the shuffling of his feet as he came back carrying a tray with two mismatched mugs. Why am I not surprised?
“No.” Harry assured, “He came by the office today and when he was leaving he said something and it, I think he was flirting.”
“Everything is in order.  I suppose relaxing a second before everyone arrives would be nice.”  Draco lounged next to Harry on the settee, making it look comfortable.  Harry meant to just hand him the drink, but ended up kissing him and almost spilling the drink on him.  The sound of the floo didn’t allow the kissing to go on for long.
“I didn’t know that.  You didn’t say that, you just drunkenly pressed your mouth against mine.  What was I supposed to make from that?”
“Er…”  Harry tried to think of some sort of excuse, but his brain went blank and Harry didn’t think that he had a spider on his face would cut it.  “I got nothin.”  He admitted.
“No, the Quidditch match.” Harry could see her posture change and knew he was going to get Hermione’s advice whether he wanted it or not.  “You loved Quidditch at school. This won’t be much different.” She did have a point, but the fun part was beating Malfoy and the Slytherins. He shrugged, in response.
“But Harry, why’d you ask him to come if you didn’t want him to be there?” Hermione asked, looking exasperated that Harry would ask and not mean it.
“Because you had practice with him today.” Ron said, as if it were obvious, “Besides only Malfoy is obnoxious enough to make you get that look on your face.
Potter’s hands pulled Draco tighter to him, his body pressing him against the counter. Draco’s fingers tightened around his wand and without consciously thinking about it apparated them both to his flat. Harry didn’t act like he noticed until he leaned into Draco even more and without the counter for support toppled them both onto the floor of Draco’s bedroom.
“Congrats, Ginny.” Harry said, standing to wrap her into a sisterly hug. She patted his shoulder in return a large grin on her face. They had managed to stay friends after their breakup. They had gone through a rough patch for a moment, but then Harry had realized why he didn’t want her and when he had finally confessed, it was a relief to both of them. Harry didn’t have to feel guilty and Ginny didn’t have to feel inadequate and then she had got the position on the Harpies. She had confessed to Harry one night that she was glad they had broke up. She didn’t really want the strain of a relationship, while traveling and trying to get her Quidditch career off the ground.
Ron opened his mouth to say something, but instead just started laughing again. “I can’t believe Malfoy was flirting with you.”
Draco raised a brow, then without answering, sauntered back towards Potter.  “Uhm,” Potter said, looking down at his feet and looking slightly flushed. Since Harry wasn’t looking at him, Draco didn’t even bother trying to hide his smug smile. Finally, he thought.  “I was thinking that you could bring the uniforms next practice. So that everyone can get them sized before the game. If you’ve got them yet, that is.”
“He came to Fred’s funeral.” Ron finally admitted. Harry paused for a moment that hadn’t been what he was expecting.
Draco got the feeling she thought he needed cheering up, but would never come out and say such a thing, it wasn’t their way. Draco’s bedroom door swung open and Blaise walked in. He was wearing robes, but they were short robes, that spoke of practicality, which Blaise didn’t usually show in his clothes. Fashion was hardly ever practical or comfortable.
“The past, Pansy.” Draco could see that he hadn’t swayed her opinion an ounce, but she shifted over to let Draco climb closer, then ran her hands through his hair, like she liked to do.
“Like you suggested.” Harry added, realizing this was all Ron’s fault made him feel a little better.
“I think we would have heard something suspicious by now if the ministry was out to control us.  We do know a few people that work at the ministry.”  George pointed out.  Half his family worked at the ministry and Harry too in case Seamus had forgotten.
“I didn’t mind helping lift the hex either. I’ve never done that kind of magic before, only read about it.”
“There’s no need to research the second one.” Draco said, but Harry knew it was a wasted request Hermione would most likely research all three and the one’s she didn’t even tell them about and then find a couple other options as well.
“Go ahead and laugh, but it's better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best, than be caught with your pants around your ankles.”  Seamus stood taller and then shrugged again.  “I’ll be by later.”  With a pop he was gone as suddenly as he appeared.  Harry shook his head, smiling at least his friends weren’t boring.
“I know, but it’s nice to know that you noticed as well.”  This won him an eye roll, and Draco chuckled. This was actually easier than he had expected. He felt calm and relaxed. He walked up to Potter boldly and ran his arm through his.  “Shall we be on our way then?” He asked, and felt Potter tighten his arm before he apparated them away.
Harry woke up the next morning once again in the expensive sheets and comfortable bed of Draco, only this time he didn’t wake up alone. Harry shifted carefully so not to wake up the sleeping figure. Draco was spread out as if use to sleeping alone and for reasons Harry wasn’t ready to analyze just yet, the thought that Draco wasn’t use to sharing his bed made Harry irrationally happy. Harry sat up carefully on his elbow and looked over the sleeping blond, he was on his back with his arms above his head, the death eater mark in dark contrast to the pale skin of his face.
“I think we are past the small talk stage. Don’t you?” Draco’s voice sounded low and Harry felt his stomach flutter. Draco reached forward to grab the two glasses of liquor off the table using the action to draw even nearer to Harry, his leg was now pressing against Harry’s. And his elegant figures brushed Harry’s when he handed Harry his own glass.
“I didn’t think it through.” Harry said, “I’m going to have to sit through an entire game with him and it will probably be in the paper for some reason or another. And then Ginny will all want us to out afterwards for drinks and I will have to invite him to that too.”
On Friday nights Harry joins Ron and Hermione for dinner. He talks—maybe too much—about the faction, all the talented, off-putting characters. He doesn’t mention the second job—which, just as Malfoy had said, was fixed, albeit slowly, over the course of a few steady days, Harry observing more than helping, actively restraining his magic. He speaks of Malfoy guardedly, too, still wary of Ron’s wariness. Hermione, on the contrary, asks question after question, wondering how Malfoy got into the field of domestic magic. “It’s such a fascinating subject,” her brown eyes brighten at the prospect. “I’d love to pick his brain. Think he’d come round for drinks, if you asked?”
It is the general pattern: hurting before he is hurt. Ending before it is over. Making it even; making it fair. Even with Jane, Harry is loathe to explain it or endure it being explained. Things were taken from him as a child. Taken and never forgiven, never rationalized. Teetering the edge of
“But—” Harry swallows, trying to catch up to the information Malfoy laid out, trying to see where he fits in—what he just did, without any clear purpose or meaning. “How come—”
The back has smaller, careful work. The kitchen, and the stores, beneath; a hearth, winding up into the air without walls. The heartbeat of the home.
She looks over in surprise—and laughs, a wily, unkempt thing. “Tiller’s in the back. You’re more use to him.”
“I’m not—I'm not sure I can give you what you want.” Malfoy says it quietly, swirling wine around in the glass.
Malfoy is watching, absently, as Isaac and Diana put their hands against a wall, and listen. “Might require—”
In a dug-out tread of vein: Bright blue flame. He remembers the pain of that particular part, feels the heat of Draco’s young waist, hears the cries of another, left behind.
Harry may not have any right to feel impatient—this is Malfoy’s faction, after all—but he’s beginning to panic, the hum of it low and heavy in his chest.
Draco breathing in, breathing out; nudging his nose at Harry's throat, like he’ll tear it apart and be the breath, himself. Like he'll take care of the breathing.
He’s never been good at washing himself clean of feeling, especially this kind; the kind that burrows under his tongue, wrenches open his jaw. “Don’t tell me you’ve fucked Dean Thomas.”
Harry stares. At the sink, Draco is a creature of the deep sea; hunched over and lonely. Even his back looks so lonely. A curve to press in.
Harry had never thought of it; that a wizard or witch would take to water with magic, rather than arms and lungs and diving in, coming up for air.
“I’m bad at this, I told you.” Is what Harry actually says, leaving the dishes and rounding Draco’s body with his own, arms reaching for what they want to hold. “Won’t you look at me?”
Malfoy sighs heavily. There’s a sound like rustling, like cloth on cloth. “I wish you’d spare me the honor.”
It’s just a floorboard, gone rigid, gone stiff. Slicing his finger an inch. Nothing life-ending. Fixable.
Malfoy introduces the others in short bursts. “Alan Tiller,” he says, gesturing to a short, burly man, and then a woman with ferociously blue eyes—“and Diana Woolf, both at Hogwarts, few years ahead of us.” Diana levels Harry with a neutral gaze. From the man—Alan—a curt nod.
Harry looks up at Malfoy without putting his finger under the dingy flow. Grieving magic clogs the pipe below the sink.
The surviving so much like a circle. Time goes; winter closes in. The windows crack with frost. Even in darkness, Draco is full of curved lines; the smoothed-out jaw, long blinking lashes. A sigh in a warm neck.
The habit of drinking after a job started without so much as a lick of oddity. Harry had asked, once, on a whim—and Malfoy accepted. It went just the same each time; Harry tired in his bones, the kind he couldn’t quit, so he just got deeper into it. Malfoy would tuck his shirt into his jeans. They huddled in a corner booth. It’s a Muggle bar, somewhere in the burrows, sparsely populated; allows them to feel anonymous, like they’re just two people.
He thinks the polite exit will be enough; to tamper the way his blood is eating fire in his veins, the way his head is stuffed with an unbearable scream.
“How long will you blame yourself,” Harry wonders, tucked into the cut of Draco’s body, a long, full, beautiful thing. His knees are soft. His lips are soft.
Harry is surprised to find he is the only member of the faction invited to the flat. He drinks the tea Malfoy offered, in the sitting room, eyes roving the space hungrily. Stoic, contemporary, green. Impeccably clean, smelling of leather and pine. Even the teacup is unembellished china; cold to the touch. “Er, are we waiting for others?”
“I appreciate your honesty,” Malfoy finally says. “And I don’t mean to be short. I have my own...reservations. About—” he waves vaguely at the in-between. “This.”
Maybe the drain would clog with his hurt; maybe the hurt would crawl back up. Wouldn’t stay where he wanted it to stay. Couldn’t be drowned. Slip along the light to dark he had manufactured, so carefully, in this old ancestral home.
They round the edge of a thicket of woods, sparse in leaves and birdsong. Bare branches that shake in the wind. Harry is glad for his parka, blue and old and warm, held together by sheer faith and piss poor re-threading charms.
There is a sound like a sigh, then a little bit of a laugh. It wriggles into Harry’s sternum and stays. “I hoped you would call.”
“Not exactly,” Hermione says, though her brow crinkles in confusion. “It’s just—I’m not entirely sure, Harry. But I heard from Nev, actually, and Padma—” she sighs. Upstairs, Ron’s frantic footsteps, rushing to the cries of their daughter, waking from a nap. “Maybe,” she suggests, “you should just write to him? No harm in a letter.”
“No,” he finally answers, picking distractedly at his sleeve. “It’s only that the location is confidential, and you’ve never been. We’ll have to side-along.”
Even good magic goes bad. Harry feels the end of it all, down the back of his throat. He sees a flash of the flame, for a second, the aggrieved pair. How sometimes love cuts just the same as fear.
Once the mess had been cleaned from his hand, Malfoy sent Harry home. Told him it was important to establish boundaries between them. “Such as,” he murmured guardedly, fingers clenched carefully, like he had to restrain touch. “I am absolutely not putting out on the first date.”
Harry meets Hermione’s gaze, head-on. It’s searching, gentle. Dear and familiar. She reaches out a hand to his. “Tea?”
And his prick is pulled right out of his pants, overeager and dumb, jumping at Malfoy’s immediate grip; the roll of wrist, the heat of fingers, spreading. Harry inhales, clings to Malfoy’s neck. Head thumped back against cabinets.
“But what if that happens again?” Harry asks quickly, his fear and failing tangling up into one ugly thing. “You can’t trust me, I’m—I’m impulsive. My magic, sometimes it’s...apart from me.”
Harry remembers when Lucius Malfoy died in Azkaban. It was the winter after the war, and Hermione and Ron were still living at Grimmauld. They read the article together, over breakfast. Snow at the windows blinded the kitchen brightly; Harry had felt nothing, really, knowing no injustice could be undone by the death.
“Kreacher, then?” Hermione asks, emerging into the dining room, toting a tin of lemon bread. “Hardly seen baked goods pass through this house, all these years.”
“Is there...something I can do? To help?” He scrambles, pulling at strings. Pushing the phone into his ear. “I have faith, somewhere, I can give you—”
Malfoy’s house—in a strange neighborhood, on the edge of the city, far from that cold-walled manor, Pansy’s green-walled flat—is so low-ceilinged that the sky must be pressing down, indoors. He pours wine in the kitchen, barefoot on linoleum. White tiles married in the middle by kissing black diamonds. A plant with chartreuse-leaves hangs from a hook above the refrigerator; one of its vines so long and winding it reaches all the way to the top of the cabinets.
“I might’ve agreed with you a year or so ago,” Harry says, tentatively, “but he’s—he’s actually very different, now.”
“As if you’ve never been saddled with anything new, or anything hard and—triumphed, yeah? Gotten into it and over it or however you—y’know. Survive it.”
It was a mutual decision, to let anyone other than Harry begin the covenant with complicated homes. The last few jobs made clear that should another faction member initiate contact, Harry could latch on, easier. Feel out the dark blue energy, safely.
Ron, brow-knit, nodding, contemplative. Taking a drink of his tea. His shoulders so broad, his beard coming in nicely. “It’s exclusive?”
“Like that’s a good idea,” Ron laughs, lowering Rose into her little highseat at the end of the table.
A tightness forms in the space behind Harry’s eyes. Malfoy, patient. Slow. The idea gnaws at him. Briefly, attracts him.
Malfoy writes a few days later, saying there’s another job, if he wants to join. Harry does. He meets the faction on the uneasy border of Diagon Alley and a busy Muggle street, their cluster more skittery than before, perhaps because of such a public wizarding locale.
Harry knows a spiral when he sees one. He tells Hermione and Ron as much, tucked between café benches, Rose fast asleep in her buggy, cuddles up in the smallest Weasley jumper Molly can manage. He stares down at the hands of his best friends, entwined atop the table.
Harry doesn’t ask anything more, for fear of the glare Diana hawks at him, her eyebrows thick and dark. She’s wearing a turtleneck, though the day is beginning to heat.
“No,” Malfoy sighs, exasperated. “I attended school with you, did I not? Broke your nose, once, on a train? Ring any bells?”
Jest? Levity on past, violent encounters? Will he tear off his shirt, expose the sixth-year scars for a jolly good laugh?
Malfoy stretches his wand hand, taps his floating timer. Purses his lips, a little, stutters where he stands. Then he walks over—no shoes no socks—to lean next to Harry. “What do you want to know?”
“I’m quite distinctive, Potter. You should know that by now.” Malfoy stands up and reaches for Harry’s empty cup and saucer.
“I’m fine,” Harry snaps, tugging himself from the hold. Ignoring the imprint of Malfoy’s hand. The burn.
Harry was unsure of what to say once he was seated and tried for small talk. “Nice place you have here.” It sounded lame to his own ears and he felt his face flush when Draco let out a snort.
Draco chanced a look at Potter. He looked surprised, but pleased and his hand returned to his back, as if rewarding him for his good behavior. “Let's take a seat.” Potter suggested leaning to speak in Draco's ear. Draco could get used to being on the arm per say of Harry Potter. But he wouldn’t he firmly reminded himself. This, whatever it was would be was just short term.
Draco brought his hand up and placed it over his face, Harry thought he might start hitting himself.  “I thought you were just drunk.”
Ssshhh. Harry tried to shush Ron. The last thing he needed was another article in the paper with the head line: The Chosen One’s, One Night.
“I didn’t give you a proper tour.” He said, smiling and feeling a little silly, but more at ease than he normally was around his dates.
“I didn’t think you would, but I just wanted to give all options I could.” Draco nodded but said nothing else.
“Not all the spots are filled yet and I’m still waiting on replies, but I was thinking about asking that Weasel...ey.”
“Er, thanks. You...do too. Look nice. I guess you always look nice though.” Potter’s eyes went wide, as if surprised that he had said that. Causing Draco’s smirk, to turn into an actual smile.
Harry ate standing at the island, the table too cluttered to sit at, while Draco continued to announce what he thought were important highlights from the broadcast.  “They said that the hospitals are starting to see a rise in cases, but it’s not putting a strain on them as of yet.”
Harry didn’t really know what to say. Malfoy had one hip on the edge of his desk again as if that were a perfectly normal thing to do. “I’m glad to hear that.” Harry looked back down at his unfinished work, but Malfoy didn’t leave. Continuing to linger instead.   “Is there something else you need?” He finally asked, hoping Malfoy would get the hint that he was expected to leave after getting his permit.
Draco rolled his eyes.  As if the lead singer to a band was competition to the Savior of the wizarding world.
“He’s only the lead singer for the hottest band, Warlocks of London” Hermione said, shaking her head as if Harry had disappointed her by not knowing that.
Potter’s eyes, darted up immediately. “Lunch with you?” Potter asked, a look of complete disbelief, and Draco grudgingly admitted horror.
“That’s even more absurd. Me and Malfoy on a date!” Harry eyed Ron, expecting him to laugh at his own joke, but he didn’t. Instead he just shoved another large bite of food into his mouth to avoid having to say more, but Harry couldn’t believe Ron of all people would suggest such a thing. He hated Malfoy. Didn’t he?  “I
The room was starting to get full and Draco had added a stretching charm to the settees to seat everyone who wasn’t in the other room or standing instead.
He summoned his clothes and climbed out of bed begrudgingly. His clothes felt like he was pulling on a canvas bag compared to the sheets he was leaving.
Harry didn’t know if he ever ended up paying. The room got more crowded, as all the Weasleys and a few others piled in from the adjoining room.  “Everyone gather round.  We have an announcement to make.”  Ron gave Ginny a shove to the side so that he could make his way to the center of the room, pulling Hermione along behind him.
His searching did find an intriguing room. Harry stepped into the room his eyes taking in the small room, small comparatively speaking. It had a large map across one wall, a large plush couch along another, and centered on the wall directly across from the door was a pale-modern looking desk. Harry walked to the map and the world map zoomed in, bringing London into focus. The streets stretched out from Harry's location.
“Draco really. We are in public.” His mom scolded, but whether she was scolding about the elbow or the public display of affection he didn’t know. His mother was a firm believer in keeping that sort of thing behind closed doors. Draco rolled his eyes and turning around pulled Harry into a kiss. Letting his tongue explore for an inappropriately long time. Harry was flushed when Draco pulled away. He didn’t want to get too carried away. He would save that for later in the men’s lounge.
Teddy’s eyes widened, his teal eyebrows raising in excitement as he pointed excitedly at an over-sized stuffed dragon as it came charging out of the locker room. Harry smirked and wondered if it had been Draco’s idea. Instead of flames the stuffed dragon blew bubbles out of its mouth. Teddy twisted in Harry’s arms to face Andromeda.
“I got you a drink.” Luna said, handing Blaise a glass filled with a pink bubbly mystery beverage. Luna was always adding her own twist to the drinks. Blaise was getting used to it and usually they tasted better anyways.
It had been a drunkenly made attempt at coping with the horrible news that he survived the war only to die in five short years by the ancient, Rubert’s Disease. Which wasn’t a disease at all, but a curse. He didn’t know why it was named as such or why someone thought of all the surviving death eaters he should be the one to curse. It was a nasty thing. The cursee had to take their own life to complete the curse, there for making it irreversible, for only the person who cast the curse could undo it. The only sign of the curse is a red ring around the cursed throat a constant reminder that time was ticking. Then when time was up the curse choked the life out of the person. It was debated as to why the cursed was given five years. Some speculated that it was to torture the person even more. To give them false hope that maybe they could be the one to find a counter unlike so many before them had failed. Others theorized that perhaps it was a chance to right the wrongs the person had committed in their life and that the cure lied in that small hint. If the cursed could feel true remorse for their actions then the curse would be lifted.
Harry pictured the Malfoy that had been leaning on his desk earlier today. His pants had been so tight it was a wonder he was able to lift his leg high enough to prop it up on his desk at all and he just didn’t think this was going to go anything like it did at school.  “Malfoy has been acting...strange.” Harry admitted.
"Harry! Have you seen the prophet yet?" Hermione practically shouted down the line and Harry winced. Draco sniggered at him, laying his head back down onto Harry's bare chest and closing his silvery eyes.
“Well, I had to design a new runic sequence, and it took rather a lot of experimentation and rather a lot of broken phones. It was based off of the standard magical interference sequence used in hospitals, and…
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. "Ye-yeah, ok. It's happened a few times, for about a month?" He mumbled, pulling his knees up to his chest.
The first floor was full of clothing- clothing that he actually wanted to wear. He'd never had much interest in clothes beyond envy at Dudley when he was younger, but suddenly he wanted to redo his entire wardrobe with clothes from this shop.
They were on their way to a much larger homeware store nearby when Harry pulled Draco towards a second-hand shop with a gasp.
The hat didn’t even graze his head before shouting out “Slytherin!” Freak stood gracefully and made his way towards the table, glaring at a small girl until she moved aside and sitting himself by the interested looking boy. His hair was almost white and his eyes- they were sharp and grey and calculating, and suddenly Freak knew exactly what his father meant when he spoke about his Mother.
“I was going to help you out with him anyway.” Draco almost pouted, but handed Teddy over and stood up. He stretched himself out like a cat, and Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from the way his lean muscles moved under his pale skin. “I’ll just go have a shower then.” And he headed into the bathroom. The mirror was still fogged over and the air was moist. Draco took a deep breath in and inhaled the lingering scents of Harry and soap and closed his eyes.
“A new jacket it is! I’ll take you shopping tomorrow and you can pick out stuff for your room and for your dorm at Hogwarts as well.” Sirius’ eyes gleamed.
Like with the previous floors, he took his rather large pile of shoes and other items down to the counter before moving onto the fourth floor. This floor was filled with all different kinds of toys, plushies and children's books, and he grabbed as many as he could carry, spending about 20 minutes trying to select the perfect plush. He ended up picking out a white dragon from jellycat that reminded him of Draco, very regal looking. His favourite things other than his plushie were a set of blue alphabet blocks and a sanrio colouring book with pastel coloured Crayola crayons.
"'Mione. Not the point. So you think Harry has this age regression thing, then? Why did he never do this before?"
Mx Greenfeld was growing more and more concerned for Harry as he spoke. “Just how bad are your relatives?”
Freak made his way up to the front of the hall. He wasn’t dressed in the uniform or robes, but no students or teachers were stupid enough to try to punish an Addams for dress code- they were the most feared family in the entire magical world, even more so than the Malfoys or the Lestranges. Instead, Freak wore tight black trousers, tailored with blood-red stitching, black dragonhide boots with steel toe caps, a dark red button-down shirt cuffed to his elbows, showing off the thick knots of scarring on his hands and arms from Uncle Vernon or his siblings and the black leather wand holster strapped to his right forearm, and a beautifully cursed black pendant his mother had given him that morning, his shoulder-length black hair falling in waves around his strong face. He sat himself on the stool, legs crossed elegantly and his back straight and looked disdainfully down at the students in the hall- they all looked nervous or scared, except, seemingly, for one fourth year boy at the Slytherin table, who looked…. Interested.
Harry had always thought of Malfoy as an island: An isolated idea, feeding on the isolated waters around him. But now he wasn’t so sure. Malfoy was a collaborator. He cared.
Harry meets Hermione’s eyes. She shakes her head, a bit, as though she’s examined him, and come to a conclusion based only on the lines of his face. “Oh, Harry,” she murmurs. Rose reaches up from her highchair to tug at one of Hermione’s curls, babbling. Harry turns to her tiny, rounded cheeks. Feels a little burst of handmade love.
Harry keeps him. Tucked to his chest in the night, mumbling and sated. Like a fixable axis. He doesn’t sleep, for the longest time. Feels himself actively caving in.
“Oh,” Harry says, stupidly, because he doesn’t understand. He’s hardly a second to ask all the questions crowding his head, like when—
“Sort of...” Harry takes a contemplative drink of his pint, foaming catching on his lip. “Consultation, I suppose. Him and the—he calls it the faction, and—I know, I know, yeah,” he reassures, seeing the look on Ron’s face. “I’m not entirely sure what that’s about, yet. But they go in and...help the house magic. Help it...” he shrugs. “Heal.”
In the depths of sixth year, buried under expectations that exceeded self-worth, exceeded all cowering doubts, Harry sometimes stopped off near the Great Lake and looked over the dying grass of autumn and wondered if he was cut out for it, after all. The fixing. The ugly truth—felt in the cleft of his chest, tucked between ribs—being he had already failed to fix himself. He was a coward in the worst way—unable to admit he was alone in the failing, that he would always fail alone. Fix one thing, break a thousand others. It was all his own undoing.
On the bar, Draco’s elbows slide wide enough for his hands to engulf his face; to cradle. Harry aches to reach, to help, now, if he can. But—Draco is not a house in need of fixing. He is blood and bone and soft, beautiful hair.
The cottage might be hundreds of years old. Harry turns on the water and it spits out red-brown, angry with its own hurt.
Feeling is a byproduct of a body. Harry resists, for a moment. Tries to, at least. His finger drips circles of red to the floor. Malfoy reaches out, appalled, yanks the wrist under water.
The line always picks up on Harry’s second ring and in the second of silence before the cool, detached, “Hello?”—like Draco hasn’t saved his number, like he doesn’t know who it is—he always tries to stop himself from saying something far too much, far too honest, like—“I was thinking of you.”
The hand retracts. When Malfoy rolls back his shoulders, he’s a good inch or three taller than Harry. “Not at all.”
Harry clings to him, wasplike. And he won’t say it aloud, won’t wake Draco up, but his body pulses with it:
And maybe Malfoy inhales, sharply. Or maybe it’s wind. “You, a total stranger? I’m content with that.”
He staves it off with a shake of his head. “It’s—no, I’m the one who should—I didn’t—think, I acted. I thought—”
It seems a continual effort of Malfoy’s to surprise Harry. “Look—I apologize.” The apology is bare; firm, and honest. “I didn’t prepare you enough. I should have—done it slower, and been patient.”
“When a magical house is invaded, gets hurt, it breaks from the physical structure to protect itself. Self-preserves. To reattach a house and its magic, especially a house as old as this one—requires trust, and a covenant. Sometimes the owners can manage the connection, because the magic knows them, might remember them. But more often the magic buries too deep once it’s severed. It depends on the depth of the cut.” He shakes his head at Harry, a few pieces of hair falling over his forehead in a silver-blonde swathe. “That’s why we come in. To repair the relationship. To make the house trust us.”
Harry realizes his hand is still stuck firmly to his chest, over his heart. He lets it loosen. Fall away. “Covenant?”
He turns on the light in the loo, sits down along the cool, dark wall. The skin of his neck sweating. He licks his lips, eyes shut. If his complications—immense, untraceable—were malleable, he would form them into something small, palm-sized. Stuff it in the bathtub drain, wash it down with water.
And Draco, saying calmly, “I don’t mean to make you feel badly about yourself. It was an average sleep. I’m not better rested than yesterday or the day before.”
They’ve arrived on a quiet side street, and one roof in the middle of the row is blown out, completely.
For a moment, it seems like Malfoy will refuse. But then he clears his beautiful throat, and slumps down a little in the booth, long legs stretched out, the toes of his shoes kissing the toes of Harry’s trainers.
The muscles in Harry’s arms strain, drawn taut, hair plastered to brow. Heart swelling up with blood. Beat rapidly and new. He blinks and the floorboards are clearing; the gunk expelled. Alan, is watching, waiting, mouth sewn shut—and Malfoy steps up behind, something pulling at his face.
“How the fuck you did it, I’ve no idea,” Malfoy mutters. “But you’re...a very powerful wizard. Don’t need to read the unofficial biography to know that.”
“You’ve got to tell me.” Harry interjects, despising his own desperate voice. “You’ve got to tell me right now if this is just a—a bit of a
a good friend. And he was interested in old magic, the kind that lives in homes, and so when there was a place in Yorkshire that belonged to someone he knew, a friend that needed help—we ditched school to puzzle it out.” An alarm rings, and Malfoy flicks at the oven with his wand. The kitchen fragrant with saffron, with garlic. “And we fixed it. It took weeks, we were very young. But we fixed it.”
A car is making its way down the thin alley. Harry and Malfoy separate in the middle and press against opposite walls. The brick is cool at Harry’s back. He keeps Malfoy’s gaze; trying to deconstruct. The failure—the winning magic—itches at his skin, still. When he blinks, he sees Annabeth.
It is something like madness, a kinetic buzz; falling from Draco’s white blonde hair, long and tangled; body, bright and scared; eyes, spilling over grey.
Harry wonders what it would be like to invite Alan Tiller for a drink; maybe share a brusque fuck in the loo. Drink a whiskey, after, and part ways. Uncomplicated.
Draco snaps a stasis on the eggs, pins himself between Harry’s thighs. Looks up, wanting. “We’ll take less of the sun each year; and then, in repose, or rejection, or regret, we’ll fall down to die. Heavy and boned.”
A sound comes out of Draco so desperate, like a warning. “Don’t look at me, god. Please don’t look.”
Nothing appears outright amiss. Harry follows the rest—a solemn parade led by Malfoy. The darkwood entryway lit only by weak overhead bulbs, narrow by illusion; foyer diminutive beneath a twisted stairway. A cursory glance reveals no personal effects save a solitary portrait: dark-haired mother and father encircled by three sons, one daughter.
The Ministry sends owls of varying lengths from varying departments. The thick envelopes stay fixed to a spot on a desk never used, unopened, unanswered. Harry fixes up Grimmauld place, clawing its soul from the floorboards. He fixes his skin back together when he bleeds. Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Neville and Luna come by and he fixes them dinner, stumbling through culinary spells and starting small kitchen fires and just laughing, laughing to fix it all, uncorking the wine with his wand and over-ordering takeout, all sorts.
The job was hard, more taxing than usual. Harry feels the exhaustion pulling him apart. He’s dehydrated, but he orders a whiskey.
“You don’t have to apologize for feeling, but—if someone asks for space, you should give them space. Doesn’t always mean...an end. Can mean room to grow.”
The faction crosses the empty street. “Owners are gone,” Draco tells him. “Sometimes it’s difficult to witness.”
“I was in an empty warehouse, with an empty canvas and a bucket of paint. Blue paint. I spread it all out with my hands. My back hurt horribly. I stood back and saw a sky. And you were in there, sort of...I saw your face, but it was—different. It was barely you.”
Malfoy stares down at his drink, half-full. Harry wants to take the clenched jaw between his fingers; feel the bone under his tongue.
“Okay,” Malfoy gasps, sprawled out on his bed, pink and long-limbed and quaking; open wide. “Good, very good.”
A long silence. Harry imagines Draco taking his lips between his thumb and forefinger, giving a good squeeze.
Because I never learned to hold my tongue, Harry wants to say. Because I couldn’t stand it if you left, forgot about me, slept better in another house—a sturdier, more beautiful house, one you made with your own magic, your own two hands. One you fixed, without me.
Malfoy looks over. Has he always had such unthinkable eyes? Stones gilded in light? The way a river smooths over a rockbed, gentle, constant, Harry breathes and breathes and breathes.
In an effort to reason with himself—with his pulse, gone feral, gone sweet—Harry sits on top of the counter and dangles his feet. “Would you be my boyfriend, if I asked?”
Malfoy deflates; all the air gone out. “Forgive me. I’m—shell-shocked. I suspected, but I never really believed it could be true.”
Malfoy and his body that will not apologize for itself.  Sweat-slicked, bright, joyful. Harry looks—and stares, without meaning to stare.
But now—now, they’re tall, and clean-shaven. Calling out Harry’s name in a Muggle park, wearing Muggle clothing. Wearing jeans.
The paper is torn along one edge—Malfoy having ripped it off a page already used. It’s late afternoon in the garden. Or—the pitiful yard, tangled in overgrown bushes and scattered wildflowers choking each other for soil, the careless result of haphazard effort. Harry reclines, legs crossed in his lap, on a wire garden seat. It’s chilly despite October sun; he pulls his coat close. Stares down at the collection of numbers. Feels the rough, torn edge between his thumb and index finger.
