“Ooh, mysterious,” the girl laughs, leaning against the counter. “That’ll be £2.27”. Draco counts out the amount painfully slowly, still not fully used to Muggle currency, while the shopkeep watches with a raised eyebrow. He hands over his money to her, only leaving one coin behind, and she returns another three with a flash of a smile and a “Thanks luv.”
Harry shrugs. “There was an overharvesting problem for a while apparently. The bats weren’t being left enough silk or something. I don’t really know the specifics.”
Draco ducks his head, smiling into his hot chocolate. He could get used to this.
He needs a distraction, something to keep his mind off it. The only thing he really has is the bloody romance novel, though. Draco reaches a shaking hand for it and flips it open listlessly, not really able to focus on any words through his shivering, but also not needing too. He’s read this book cover to cover countless times, and he knows its contents by heart. What he really needs is a nice new book, and a nice warm place to read it.
Potter cocks his head. “That’s your favourite winter activity?” He determines. Draco nods.
The warm, familiar smell of books and ink greets him as he pushes into the building. The librarian, sitting behind the counter today, looks up and nods to him in greeting.
“Sorry to bother you,” says the otter contritely in Granger’s voice, “but Ron’s got a work emergency and Rosie fell of a table and hurt her leg. I have to take her to St. Mungo’s, but Walker’s is getting that new wool I wanted to get for Molly today and I’m afraid they’re going to sell out. I’m terribly sorry to ask, but can you please pick some up for me? Just a skein of each colour please.”
Potter, the complete arse, lies through his teeth. “It’s not,” he insists. “It was barely anything, honestly.”
Forsythe gives an oily smirk. “Get to it then,” he says, “and don’t think of shirking out. If you’re not back by noon you’re fired.” Then he sweeps off back into the front room, leaving Draco standing there, trembling with anger.
Draco self-consciously tugs his hat lower. What is she getting his picture for? Could she be an undercover Auror who has somehow recognized him? But no…she’s not familiar to him. He doesn’t see how she would be able to recognize him on sight without him at least doing the same. Maybe he’s just dressed funny for a Muggle and she wants to laugh at it later. He doesn’t think so, based on what he sees them wearing, but who knows what the unifying Muggle theme is?
Potter flushes red. “It seemed like a good idea at the time,” he says, allowing Draco to steady him with hands on Potter’s waist. “Besides,” he adds, his voice dropping to something more intimate, “It’s not so bad when you’re here to help me.”
“The Wizengamot thought so,” Potter agrees. He looks pleased with himself as he crosses his arms behind his head and leans back in his chair. The move reveals a tantalizing strip of golden skin at his belly that draws Draco’s attention.
The shop is not very large – tall, narrow, and unassuming with a faded sign above the entrance that declares it
“Potter, we’ve passed the hot chocolate stand,” he says.
Draco feels a blush rising up his cheeks and frowns. “I’m hardly a savant,” he argues. There’s no way for Potter to know that he’s been working on this for around seven years now, he supposes, but he doesn’t feel comfortable with the description.
Draco inwardly rolls his eyes at him self and pops a bite of bagel into his mouth. “Well, good to know those glasses are good for something then,” he says at length, far too late. Potter doesn’t call him out on it, though his green eyes are amused as he sips his hot chocolate.
The street is less busy today, likely as a result of both the temperature and the early hour, but it’s still lively. Draco thankfully has no run-ins with Potter today on his way to the library.
He feels his gloves tearing further, palms scraping against harsh stone. Draco can’t help his cry of pain. He turns, looking wildly over his shoulder, but nobody is looking at him. With an inhaled hiss, he pulls himself to his feet and double-checks that his hood is back up before bringing his hands up for inspection. As he suspected, the gloves have ripped and the scrape against the ground has broken through the skin, drawing bloody scratches across his palms.
Potter is watching him, of course, with those intense eyes of his, and Draco’s sure that the pink is stained onto his cheeks permanently by this point. He quickly slides his arms into the new coat and pulls it closed around him. The first thing he notices is that the coat has a built-in warming charm, and he looks up at Potter with shock. Potter just smiles unabashedly back at him, as though this is normal.
It still doesn’t feel right, though, and the easy smile on Potter’s handsome face when he returns to the other man makes his stomach twist with shame. He frowns and resolves to kindly rebuff any future invites from Potter.
Draco stares, incredulous. “By
Finished eating, Draco sits back and contemplates what to do with his evening. He really doesn’t have much to occupy his time in this apartment and, if it weren’t for the terrible cold, it would be the boredom that irritated him most about having time off work. At least at the shop, he has Forsythe’s potion books to keep him occupied in the odd occasion that he runs out of things to do.
“It’s Harry,” corrects Potter with a grin, “and you should be honoured. My company is in high demand,” His tone is teasing and not at all the bragging Draco would have once expected from him. It’s oddly charming.
“Are you getting tired? I can walk,” he offers, but somehow he knows that that’s not the case. He doesn’t want to examine it too closely, however. He’ll just be reminded of what a truly terrible idea this all is. He should not be here with Potter.
Before him, a figure blinks into existence. It at once looks human and not, bright and glowing with a shifting iridescence that makes it impossible to place. Draco startles and stumbles backward.
Gringotts will take some time – either the goblins dislike him, or else they are simply very busy, he has no way to know – so he returns to his room and strips off his clothes. Shivering against the cold air, he quickly starts up a shower and steps into the hot water with a grateful sigh. He cleans himself quickly, and then, after a moment’s consideration, lathers soap through his hair. His younger self would surely have died at the very idea, and Draco inanely mourns the silky perfection his hair used to be. He shakes himself of the sentiment and dries off roughly with his scratchy towel before dressing in yesterday’s clothes. Another nail for the coffin of his past life.
“Stop!” Harry shouted. He put a hand to his head like the information was too much for him to process. “Draco, this is rubbish.
“You’ll eat.” Harry paused for a moment as Draco’s hand quivered in his lap. “Now.”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, eyes wide with relief. He moved forward, arms outstretched.
“Please,” he mumbles, face pressed tired against the door, his weight leaning heavily into its smooth surface. His leg is injured somewhere, but he can only feel the pain thrumming through his bones and up to his spine. He can’t see anything.
“Draco, I have to be honest. I wouldn’t peg you as the type to use drugs.” He said eventually.
“How about tea,” Ethel offers kindly, her features softening at the anxiety in Harry’s tone.
“What did you talk to her about?” Draco asks. His eyes don’t shift away from their focus. Draco doesn’t like making eye contact through hard conversations.
Draco blinks and then takes off his coat.
Harry woke to the sound of knocking against his window.
He’d experimented with a few wizarding drugs after the war, mostly for fun, but this,
Before Ollie can respond, the room seems to fall silent, and Azalea is walking in, clad in modest charcoal robes, her afro styled back into a puff with a yellow ribbon. She wears a serious, but wise expression on her features. Her mere presence seems to calm the group as she takes a seat in one of the chairs.
She took a delicate sip of her soup, closing her eyes at the taste. “Salazar, I
“Bring him home, Harry.” Narcissa exhales. “If you can.”
He missed her painfully, still.
“Tea for Harry and I would be lovely, and maybe some afternoon fare, please.”
“Sure, Jack, anything for you.” Oli snorted, throwing his head back to grin at the group briefly, but focusing his attention on Harry nevertheless.
“Slowly,” Harry chides. “Or you’ll make yourself sick.”
He obtained profound pleasure from Draco’s pain.
The first time Harry arrived at work looking cheerful, Ron had said, “You look like you’ve had sex for breakfast, Harry.”
“Okay, fuck, yes, stay home with me, please,” he whined and hated how he sounded like a child. But the pain cleared away abruptly, and the relief that followed was practically symphonic.
“Do you have an owl?” Harry asks. “I need to contact my supervisor.”
There aren’t many lights on in Hampstead, and the midnight blue sky shines with stars, casting dancing rays of moonlight across Draco’s pale features. He looks ethereal and angelic against the backdrop of the night.
Instead, Draco pretended he’d acquired the plants for Harry as a gift and set to grow them in their garden as soon as he could.
“Take care,” Draco said, with a shocking sincerity in his voice.
“You don’t happen to know who Malfoy’s soulmate is, do you?” Harry asks abruptly, unsure if he’s about to blow his cover or not. He knows it's a tactless move, and he wants to snatch the words back as they leave his lips.
Harry nodded in response, but his mind was filled with thick fog. Something inside was screaming at him to just stumble forward and kiss Draco sloppily against the door of the entrance hall. But he didn’t, and in seconds Draco had stalked off in the direction of the dungeons. Harry pushed his back to the cold wall and sunk down the floor, head in his hands. He was sobering up and willing his mind to let the alcoholic stupor envelop him so he could forget what feelings felt like.
“It always is, isn’t it?” Harry says before following the woman into the back.
“What’s that?” Draco asked, his mouth slack and soft against the bedsheets. Consciousness slipped from his grasp before he could hold onto it, and the welcoming arms of sleep outstretched to pull him under.
“What would Granger and the Weasel have done if you left them like this?” Snape wonders aloud, gazing out toward the Quidditch Pitch, “hardly seems like something the noble Harry Potter would do. Leave the people he loves behind.”
Ron’s gaze hardens. “Come on, be reasonable. I hate him, too, but realistically it makes sense that he wouldn’t have just asked you over.”
Harry fucking him than any other before. This one was calculating and ruthless, and he had no other desire in the world than to physically damage Draco as much as he could.
Draco removed his Muggle cell phone from his pocket, dialling out a number to call. It was a clunky thing with a screen that, when touched, shifted into different images and shapes at the user’s will. Draco quite liked it, though he would never admit it to anyone, as it reminded him of magic.
When he looked back at the mirror, everything was back to normal. He was met with his own haggard frame, crouching in a cloud of fear and shame by the closed door.
One morning Harry wakes up with a sinking feeling in his stomach that he’s going to do something supremely stupid, and it will result in dire consequences. He figures that if the Wizengamot isn't going to exact punishment, he would have to take matters into his own hands. At least then he’d know he suffered, paid a fair price, for what he’d done. The idea that he's allowed to roam free throughout a school he had killed another student in was eating him alive. That it had been Malfoy, of all people. It seemed like there remains nothing left to live for anymore. He's too tired to fight a war that hasn't even started yet.
The shopkeeper from Harry’s usual apothecary sat back in his chair, regarding him with a toothy and knowing smile.
Something shifted in Harry that he couldn’t qualify when he heard voices from the door. The idea of entertaining guests remained unappealing to him as they made their presence known in the kitchen. A weight hung in his stomach like a stone. His Draco was nothing more than the unfortunate result of a pseudo-Imperius Curse, and nothing could change that. But Harry couldn’t go back to the way things were.
Harry feels warmth bloom in his chest at the thought. He watches Draco’s delicate fingers whiten as he presses down into the knife.
“Potter, I’ll never admit to saying this, but you’re not terrible company,” Draco remarks, bringing a Marlboro Red to his lips and lighting it with a half-hearted
Harry walks inside without much of a second thought.
“Go upstairs then.”
“Auror Potter,” Locke called, and Harry’s head turned a fraction of an inch to accommodate him. “You forgot my little gift.”
Mr Marchand winced at his youngest daughter’s name, and something twisted painfully in Harry’s chest. Capucine nodded, though, and Harry continued as his job required.
“No, sir, I insist you take it. No need to purchase the first time around. Give it a try. See what happens. There’s no harm at all in making the people around you more tolerable, eh?” The shopkeeper gazed at him hopefully. “Free of charge for you. If you like it, you can come to me for more.”
“I think it’s time for you to go.”
. Draco shook his head. A cursed word. He’d rather be curled up in bed with a good book and a steaming cup of tea on a frigid day like this one.
Harry can only offer a weak smile back.
It takes Harry a moment before a horrifying realisation dawns upon him.
He didn’t answer, leaving his things behind and advancing to the Slytherin side of the hall. Draco’s eyes grew wide as he approached, obviously surprised by Harry’s appearance at his table.
“You have such a flair for the dramatics, Potter. You know not everything is about you.” He snarled, his eyes flashing with anger and maybe something else too. Harry just couldn’t identify what it was.
Harry, with surprise, brings up a hand to cover his mouth.
He and Ron had been so close to classifying the case as a suicide out of simple convenience. Harry felt embarrassed at the thought but knew that there were things that needed to be prioritised as an Auror. For a while, Harry was ashamed to admit that Pauline hadn’t felt like one.
“Hullo,” Harry said, low and gruff as though he’d only just woken. Draco knew all too well that his sleep voice stuck around for a while longer after he’d been in bed. A smile flickered across his features, and he practically lit up from across the room.
When he thought about it, though, Harry hadn’t necessarily convinced him. He’d offered, and the annoying tic at the back of Draco’s mind had actively forced him to go unless he wanted to sit at home with a splitting headache.
“Table?” Harry asked, eyeing the bare hardwood and dreaming about laying Draco down on it and fucking him until neither of them could still see.
It was only when he walked away from him that Harry realized the gravity of what he had said.
When the door had closed behind her, and a silencing charm was cast over the room, Ginny spoke again.
He doesn’t think anyone’s really heard him, and the music playing from downstairs is still far too loud. Harry closes the door gently behind him and approaches the bed. When he pulls back the gauze, he finds himself less surprised than he should be by the scene in front of him.
When he opened the folder, his heart swooped to his stomach.
Harry brings his hand up to knock, slowing as it gets closer to the wood. The door is gothic-shaped, with a point at the top that, for some reason, makes him anxious to look at. There’s a small arched window at the centre, but Harry can only see blackness inside. It almost seems like no one is home.
Pain shattered through his head like the distinct prongs of a lightning bolt. Draco cried out, pressing his temple against the wall and forcing a deep breath.
“I don’t know,” Draco said because it was the truth. He would’ve been violated, probably.
“Different?”
“You know,” Draco says, his eyes tracking something Harry can’t see across the ceiling. “I’ve always preferred a kind of French ending.”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry groans, “you feel so good.”
As Harry is bringing up his fist to knock again, the door swings open, and he takes an instinctive step back.
“So, are you going to tell me why you were there?”
Harry inclined his head at the figure next to him, adjusting the summer sheets so that they, at least, covered him to his shoulders. Draco would wake up in a better mood because of it.
“You’ll have to learn,” Harry replies, sternly but with all the love he can muster. “You’re so strong, and you need to push through.”
His stomach twisted and curled unpleasantly at the voice. Everything in his mind was screaming at him to flee, but he held his ground, digging his winter boots further into the bakery’s tiled floors.
“We should dance,” Harry says breathlessly, pressed up against Draco’s side in the packed room. He’s surprised that he doesn’t feel overwhelmed. There’s a pervasive sense of calm. He knows he’s okay, and that Draco will have his back if he isn’t.
“Sorry?” Harry asks, resisting the urge to cough as the rough feeling of Firewhisky burns a tunnel down the length of his throat.
“I-I’m not lying,” Draco managed, but his nerves were triumphing over level-headedness.
He reached for some spare parchment on the table, and after locating a self-inking quill, scrawled out a quick note to Luna. He sent the owl off with a pat and a slice of plum as an incentive to deliver the message extra fast. As much as Lyra loved him, Draco figured she’d take her own sweet time as usual.
Draco doesn’t respond, training his eyes down to a spot on the ground. Harry continues wiping up the blood, until the area looks as clean as it can get.
To make him feel owned.
Draco for long at all. And he bears no place in his life to make such a calculated observation.
After locking up Grimmauld Place, Harry heads for the tube.
“She’s back at McGonagall’s,” Ron answered in response to Harry’s searching eyes.
, shouted the morning headlines.
“I wasn’t, really,” Draco says quietly, a red blush creeping through his neck and over his cheeks.
“Doesn’t it?” Narcissa hums, content with his praise. “Unfortunately, Draco hasn’t seen it like this yet.”
“I did,” Draco said, and his face tightened. Clearly this was a question he had been waiting to ask. “I don’t want to start a fight.”
A splintering ache stretched across his skull, Draco’s mind going numb with overstimulation for a fraction of a moment. The hurt wasn’t as demanding as it usually was, and Draco found himself able to hold it off with some effort.
“Wish him a happy birthday from me, please. He deserves the world, you know.” She gave Harry a pointed look, and he felt small under her gaze.
to her. And well, he was probably attracted to her. If he wanted Pansy, he could probably have her, because she shared a similar interest in both sexes. But Draco had shaken himself out of the intrusive thought as Neville, cheeky grin plastered upon his features, replaced the empty champagne flute in his hand.
Draco gives him a pitying smile. “Someone very wise once told me that my recovery had to be my own, and not anyone else’s.” He squeezes Harry’s hand in his. “She’s eventually going to pull herself out of this, don’t worry.”
So really, Harry was just being strategic, because he was relishing in the fact that Draco was still with him. Years later.
Rage swelled in Draco’s lungs, but he couldn’t tear his gaze away. He could hold himself together for only a moment longer before he interrupted the two. There must have been a dangerous look in his eye because a few patrons from the table across had begun regarding him warily.
“Not to Ginny?”
“Dressed,” Draco announces quietly, and Harry returns to the bed.
Capucine blinked back a few tears before sitting straighter against the couch. “We firecalled this morning. I’ve been trying to contact her, to see her, for weeks now, but something was wrong. She wouldn’t come see me, and every time I asked her to, I could tell it was like she wanted to, but couldn’t. Something was holding her back.”
“I’m starting to get used to this whole cayenne pepper on egg habit,” Draco said innocently, stealing a bit from Harry’s plate with his fork.
The clock struck twelve and Draco’s birthday was over.
Draco smiled back, a small upturn of his lips that, to anyone else, would have seemed unfriendly. Harry would know that there was more to it.
“I considered that,” he admitted guiltily.
Harry, suddenly the most horrified by himself that he’s ever been, finds himself just wanting to bend over and suck on it.
Though technically, Draco didn’t have any specific addiction to treat besides one to his hair gel and paperwork. The plant could be totally hopeless, and he would be none the wiser.
He wasn’t sure when Harry had started making him feel so inhuman.
He startled at the fact that the potion let him say it. The thistle seemed to be working, even if it was doing the bare minimum required of it.
Harry
“How do you feel?” Harry prompts.
“An individual who still has a bone to pick with some of us Death Eaters. You know I don’t blame him for having the balls to at least do what everyone else dreams of doing to me.” Draco flashes a resigned smile that Harry finds makes the croissant he ate for breakfast flip over in his stomach. “At least he follows through.”
“Yeah?”
“I’ll teach you,” Draco smiles.
Draco turned the thought over in his head a few times before fiddling with his fingers — a stupid habit he’d picked up from Harry.
Harry poked his head out the French doors and held one hand out in the cold air. “
“Yeah, well, we’ve already established you’re mad,” Draco says, but there’s a faint pink blush appearing on his cheeks. “I just don’t want to put that kind of pressure on someone. Imagine finding out your soulmate used to be a Death Eater: what a disappointment.”
“You won’t be. We’ve been using it to aid patients for years, and it’s only still in trials due to the volatility of its synthetic counterpart in labs.”
Draco smiles ruefully down at the table. “It’s possible that I have one, but I know I don’t deserve one.”
“God, you’re so dramatic, Theo darling,” Pansy crows from the doorway. Harry hadn’t even heard her come in.
He occupied the seat across from Draco, sliding a plate of eggs and toast across the table. Draco hummed a thank you in response as he picked at breakfast half-heartedly and looked anywhere but Harry himself.
“When was the last time you spoke to her?”
“You got these…for me?” Harry asked, struggling to keep both amusement and affection from blanketing his voice. Draco had bought flowers for him.
Draco wiped at his eyes hastily, holding the blanket to his chest like a lifeline. “I couldn’t tell you,” he said because it was technically the truth.
Draco doesn’t put his book down, but Harry can tell he’s stopped absorbing the words. He makes a noise in question.
“She didn’t necessarily tell me to come over,” Ron said, after a moment of silence. Only a small bit of shame creeped into his voice. “You know I always enjoy hanging out with you. Just the two of us.”
” Harry sighed. “You can barely shower or dress yourself without my help. You’re all skin and bones. Do you really want people seeing you like this?”
“You know,” Pansy makes her way toward them, perching herself delicately on the edge of Theo’s bed. “I honestly thought last night was an entire hallucination, and Harry Potter hadn’t strolled into our house and made himself right at home.”
“Maybe not literally,” Draco says. “But in many ways, I do.”
Draco wanted to spend time with him for the first time in years.
He fights his way through the crowd, pounding music drowning out any semblance of rational thought in his mind. He’s looking for blonde hair, literally anywhere in the room, but apart from Luna the only one he spots is Lavender. She’s wrapped around Parvati on the dancefloor, their bodies pressed together as they sway to the rhythm.
“I’ll leave you alone for now because you look like last night has taken years off your life, but you know Hermione and I will have questions later,” Ron teases.
Harry’s there for longer than he needs to be, mostly to give Draco more time with the book he’s chosen. He knows for a fact that without him, Draco would never be allowed into Flourish and Blotts.
“It’s safe,” Draco repeats, his voice far off and distant as though someone else has spoken the words entirely.
, but Draco seemed as though he were having a good day, and Harry would be damned if he was going to ruin it.
“So, the drugs,” Harry supplies, but his tone is colder than he expects it to be.
“It’s your name, we’ve been over this.”
Harry’s not sure how he remembers, because he’s certain that he and Ron had fucked around during this seminar of Auror training, but he works mechanically. He remembers what Hermione had mentioned to him at Hogwarts, how wizarding curatives couldn’t work properly when it came to Muggle substances. Especially with a rise in substance abuse after the war, it was precisely why Aurors were taught to administer Muggle medication.
“Go home,” Harry says softly. “Get some rest. I have this under control for tonight. I just want to be here if something happens again.”
“Harry, I know you have to be seeing what I’m seeing, and Ginny’s worried sick. Draco’s been missing work and moping around at home. He barely firecalls us anymore when he used to all the time! He’s obviously going through something, and we need to be there for him.”
“You’re so wonderful,” Harry whispers, forehead pressed against Draco’s. “I’m never letting you go.”
“Draco, your definition of openness is skewed,” Harry frowns, and he can’t help but feel slightly irritated. “I never know how you’re feeling, and I don’t understand why you still put yourself through this. Forgive me, if I don’t think you’re the most honest with me while you’re sober.”
“I don’t think I would’ve come if you’d invited me, but I’m curious as to why you didn’t.” Harry looks away as he says the words, unsure of why he’s even spoken them in the first place. The happiness of his high is already wearing thin.
Harry flushes quickly, his cheeks hot with embarrassment. “No, er, I meant like, just to get to know each other better, you know? Or we don’t have to, if you don’t want—”
“Yes,” Draco says tightly. “Terms of my parole.”
A wry smile plays upon Draco’s lips. “Are you asking me on a coffee date, Potter? You know, I’m more of a tea man myself.”
The entirety of the Three Broomsticks swiveled to stare at who had just disturbed the peace in the quiet establishment. Malfoy, presumably, couldn’t hear a thing, but recognizing the reactions from other patrons and the way Harry’s mouth opened so widely was apparently enough. Madam Rosmerta was already sending nasty looks their way, and neither of them desired a lifetime ban.
“He weighs nothing,” Harry says tightly, aware his tone is the slightest bit accusatory. Theo frowns, and Pansy looks down. Harry’s a bit relieved that they, at least, feel guilty too.
The day was unseasonably sunny, but a wind chill made its presence known. Fine hairs on Draco’s arms stood up in response. He wondered why he wasn’t more worried about getting his shoes dirty but found that it was one of the last things on his mind. He followed Harry to the patch of peppers in the back of the garden.
“I promise Mrs. Malfoy, I really do.” Harry bows his head.
For whatever reason, Harry listened.
Harry’s head felt as though it were about to burst, and he steadied himself against the apple tree for support. He knew that Ron had lost so much to the war too. But, Harry and Draco weren’t together and it wasn’t anyone's place anymore to tell him what and who to involve himself with. Harry was allowed to do whatever he desired, after the last, however many years of his life had been an absolute nightmare. At least Hermione understood a bit better.
Before Harry knows it, he’s twirling through the air, landing roughly on the doorstep of Draco’s funny little home. Though the sight of it is familiar, Harry still finds himself unable to look away from the looming structure.
They had free time on Thursday mornings, and usually, Harry spent it outside when the weather was nice, but he didn’t want to risk a chance encounter with Malfoy just yet.
“It’s quite obvious, isn’t it.” Ron shrugged involuntarily, but there was anger on his face. He waved his hand at the scene in front of him, “You and Malfoy.”
“No, you’re not.”
After dinner, Draco sent the dishes to clean themselves, and Harry held his tongue from complaining. He often found himself staying in the kitchen to do the washing up just to avoid interaction with Draco. Now, if they were both really committed to fixing things, that would be unnecessary and unfair. Instead, Draco suggested a film.
“You were acting in self-defense.” Dumbledore continues, hardly disconcerted by Harry’s lack of response, “You will be placed under probation, but will undertake it as such within Hogwarts. You
“I love you,” Draco answered. Though he noticed his mind hadn’t tortured out the response like it usually did. A part of him didn’t mean the words anymore, but he was so used to being compelled to say them that they tumbled out easily.
Ron nods. “Thanks, mate! I’ll get it next time.”
“I know you would.” She offers a smile, albeit weak, but genuine. “Alas, we are witness to Draco’s fate already.”
After much too long, the door opens itself, and Harry walks inside. There’s no one waiting in the foyer for him, but Harry’s content to give it a moment. He begins to take off his overcoat, and a nearby coat rack outstretches two arms to ease it from his shoulders.
“Care for a read?” she asks, smiling at Harry. She very decidedly chooses to ignore Draco’s presence.
“We can help her,” Harry whispers to Draco.
him he’s your soulmate. You just need to patch up your relationship and become friends. That’s not the hardest task in the world.”
The night is still.
“Milk thistle. Earlier tonight, when you couldn’t control yourself, I couldn’t either. My body, something about it, just wanted to let you do as you pleased. My mind wouldn’t let me say no.”
Lyra stretched out a wing languidly, letting the cold chill of October settle over it. The owl knocked at the windowpane a couple times with her beak, the glass letting out noises of annoyance at her inquiry.
So much for a surprise party.
“Ron, that’s not a very appropriate topic of conversation right now. I’m trying to eat.”
“Set the table?” Harry asked, and Draco complied.
A soft meow from the kitchen pulls his attention, and he heads in the direction of the pantry. While he’s not quite hungry enough for a proper breakfast, something in his stomach might soothe the ache there.
“Do you want some?” Draco asks, his fingers twitching as he attempts to point at the spot where Harry had noticed the white powder earlier.
It takes him another hour to pick himself up off of the bathroom floor and head down to the kitchen, but Harry stays the entire time.
Harry finds himself a seat in the circle.
The man looks over at where Draco’s seated, pushing his glasses further up on his nose and squinting to see. “Jane Austen, judging by the cover. One of our First Editions.”
He enlarges the box and swings it open.
classes. Absolute madness!” Ron leaned away from Harry as he and Seamus engrossed themselves in a conversation about Quidditch.
“So, is it true, you can speak in Parseltongue?” Draco asked the next week as they were reading Jane Austen in the courtyard.
The walls were a grey cobblestone that smelled disturbingly marshy. Moss grew tangled and stretched along each brick’s jagged surfaces as though it inhabited space in the rainy outdoors. The ground itself was the type of spongy wet that Harry hated to step on even in his garden at home. Death lived in the skeleton walls of the cellars.
It was those kinds of moments that Harry lost out on entirely, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to let them go just yet.
“I’m sure there will be something to do. It’s a university.” Harry grumbled, leading Malfoy out of the Three Broomsticks. “Stop being so negative.”
When he’d told his Mind Healer about the voice, she’d written it off as a symptom of his depression. When he had told her about his hallucination, she’d told him that he was broken. Things in his head weren’t working right and wouldn’t until he started getting serious about taking his medication.
“And what kind of state is he in then,” Harry says, failing to hide the ridicule threaded deep into his tone.
“He forgot to take them to the tailor.” Hermione shakes her head, a certain fondness in her tone. “God alone knows why I married this man.”
Draco presses his spine to the wall, resting his head back with a soft thump. Somehow the sight of it all makes Harry feel sick too. A slick layer of sweat coats his forehead, damping long blonde strands of hair that fall around his face. His eyes are a bloodshot, unpleasant red that make it look like he hasn’t slept properly in days. Harry doesn’t really think he has.
Harry pauses then, suddenly interested by the words on the page in front of him. Draco doesn’t prompt him again, so he continues to read through the case file: a burglary in Diagon Alley.
“They’re Greek statues,” Harry said, paging through the guide. “People love them, apparently.” He eyed the young Muggles around him, crouched beneath the statues as if they were in God’s presence.
So if living got to be too much, he just wouldn't bother.
“Only if you call me Draco.” Malfoy sniffed, “Shame to waste such an elegant first name.”
“You weren’t?”
“I’m fine, I just have a headache,” Draco said. “Maybe I’ll owl in sick.” He summoned Lyra with two fingers, and she followed them eagerly.
There's an awkward, lengthy pause as Harry struggles to come up with what to say next.
For some reason, Harry notices, she seems to be reading words on a page that he can’t see. The entire length of the book that is visible to him is one long and suspicious blank page.
Harry reaches forward, plucking a small, thumb-sized plastic baggie from the surface of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s
Harry found himself flustered when he realized he had finished next – it was a rare occurrence. As he began to approach the bench, someone pushed out in front of him. Harry’s hasty slowing charm prevented the vials from crashing against the floor and ruining hours’ worth of tough work. He glared at the blonde in front of him, though Malfoy would not meet his eyes.
Harry stands on the doorstep patiently, his hair beginning to wet.
Draco did cry out, pressing fingers to his temples as a rush of information eclipsed his senses. It was like a door had been unlocked in his mind. Memories came rushing through.
“I’m sure.” Proudfoot scratched at her head absentmindedly; eyes still focused on the page in front of her. “I’m almost done here anyway, and you’re making my skin itch with all that energy. Please go.”
the voice said.
And Harry knows it isn’t. Because, well, he wouldn’t be here if it was.
So, on Thursday morning, when he entered the Great Hall and sat at his table with his friends, he hadn’t expected to look up and meet familiar grey eyes.
“I told him he was a bastard like his father,” Harry said quietly, “I shouldn’t have said that, I know.”
“I thought it would be fun,” Harry exclaimed, resisting the urge to put his head in his hands.
A knock on his door cleared his thoughts.
He considered it for a second but shoved the idea away. If Draco was to spend even a moment alone with the thoughts inside of his head, he might truly go mad after all.
“I think I do,” Malfoy said softly, unable to tear bright eyes away from the mess of colors on canvas. He was lit up like Harry had never seen before. “It’s different.”
“Hi there, Harry.” Luna stood in front of him, the firelight making her platinum hair glow. She looked celestial.
The room smelled like oak trees and sweat, which was so distinctly Harry that Draco smiled where he usually would have frowned.
When they walked into the boardroom, Minister Shacklebolt, dressed in deep blue robes, was already at the head of the table. At his side, Hermione looked stoic and composed. She sent a side glance at Harry and Ron and smiled with her eyes. They returned the smile to her with enthusiasm.
“Oh, it is one, but it’s mine.”
He entered the Department of Magical Law Enforcement with a spring in his step. When Ron joined his side, he barely commented on it because it had become a regular occurrence.
“You think we would ever let you talk to him after whatever stunt you pulled yesterday!” Parkinson’s eyes flashed with anger. She looked at Harry as if he were a bit of scum on her shoe. “You are absolutely pathetic, coming over here.”
“They don’t make me feel like
Hermione, with confusion written across her features, allows herself to be led out, mouthing an apology to Harry and asking him to owl her later. He doesn’t acknowledge it, purely because of the way Draco is watching his every move.
Harry strung up twinkling fairy lights that cozied up the space and cleared away stray leaves and fallen fruit to make room for round tables with wicker chairs. He arranged a food and refreshments table on one side and an area for music on the other. The whole space seemed quaint, like a perfect summer party. Harry knew Draco would somehow manage to detest it all anyway.
“Hello there!” He clapped Malfoy forcefully on the shoulder, and he at least had the decency to startle. “Name’s Oliver. But you two can call me Oli.”
Ginny sighs. “Harry, you haven’t been a part of the magical world for that long. And you didn’t hear the stories that we all did growing up. This whole soulmates thing can be a blessing and a curse, that’s why they did away with it in the first place.”
Earlier in the day, they had arrived on the scene of a domestic disturbance. A wizard had killed his wife for leaving their home without his permission. It should have bothered Harry, like it did Proudfoot and the rest of the trainees, to see all the blood and the woman’s mangled body, but he was hardly fazed. The only thing that irked him was the mountains of paperwork that came with cases such as these, and he worried he’d lose out on his evening entirely at this rate.
When Harry and Draco head back into London, it’s dark out. They’d stayed for dinner, and then subsequent dessert and then tea, before deciding it would probably be best to head home before it got too late.
“I do not!” Draco said defensively, but lifted his feet onto Harry’s lap. “I just think the box is an eyesore in the living room.”
The bar was too loud for Draco to discern any of their conversation, and there were far too many people around for him to cast a discreet amplifying charm. Instead, he watched bitterly as Harry’s grip tightened on the woman’s thigh as his eyes drank in her corseted waist and moved upward, lingering on parted red lips like an invitation.
The two arrived back at Hogwarts in the early evening, and they lingered awkwardly in the doorway.
was already playing on the channel, and Harry knew it was horribly cheesy because he’d spent countless nights watching movies alone. Draco would never admit he loved a sappy romantic comedy, but Harry let it play anyway knowing it would be appreciated even in secret.
Wind howled against the glass of Draco’s hospital room, branches relentlessly pounding against the panes. Late August rainstorms were always the muggy, sticky kind. But Draco enjoyed it from the cool indoors, awaiting his mother’s inevitable presence in the already too cramped room.
“Next week, I’ll have lunch with you at the office,” she agreed, wrapping an arm possessively around Harry’s waist. He felt comforted by the press of her long fingers into his side.
“Merlin, Potter, I thought you were going to kiss me in front of everyone.” Draco let out an angry sigh.
Harry felt himself light up at the statement. He’d always loved a possessive man, but Draco was always another level. It was comforting and painfully arousing, to see him eye Pansy’s touch like a personal challenge.
“I won’t disagree with you,” Harry says. He finds himself feeling distinct relief that Draco is eating too and isn’t being shy about it.
“You’ll just feel a slight twinge—”
“I was propositioning him, obviously.  You know how I like to deflower the angry ones.” Malfoy grinned at Zabini, who promptly threw his head back with laughter. Parkinson didn’t look very happy, but Malfoy’s eyes glittered mischievously.
Draco’s eyes snapped up to meet themselves in the mirror. The voice had never spoken out of turn, never unprompted.
Without thinking, Harry casts a Warming Charm over the both of them.
The room was silent save for the hushed click of the grandfather clock on the wall. It seemed like the people around him were holding their breaths, awaiting something. A sign.
Now that Harry’s come to think of it, he hasn’t seen Blaise interact with his friends from school much at all. He recalls that Blaise and Pansy used to be very close, and wonders what happened to all that. But people grow out of people and that was the way things went sometimes.
“You’re right. I would.” He sighed, shifting his weight in his seat. “If I feel as though something is seriously wrong, I’ll talk to you. I promise. But until then, please leave me alone so I can get some rest.” He poked her side and pasted on an adoring smile.
Ron was beside him, gripping his cloak with white knuckles, pulling the skin taut over his hands.
The visual in the mirror was terrifying. His body stood there, same as it always was, still and unmoving. But his mouth, it was someone else's, the voice someone else’s, but it was coming from somewhere deep within himself. Draco looked away and then back to make sure he wasn’t losing his shit entirely. But he gazed into the mirror, and there was his reflection, smiling back at him with an unnerving intent.
Somehow, despite all that he’d done to his husband, Harry felt sorry for her.
“Look, I’m actually genuinely sorry I said what I did,” Harry said. He was placing all cards on the table, and hoping Malfoy would respond reasonably well. “It was stupid of me to say that about you. I’ve been around you a lot for the past few weeks, and we get along fairly well. I just said that to get a rise out of you. You’re not like your father at all, and, er, I’m sure you already know that.”
“Draco,” Clove said, formalities aside. She cast a few charms that Draco recognised as diagnostics. “Can you hear me?”
Harry stuffed the shirt into Draco’s mouth ruthlessly instead. “Quit talking.” The command was swift, and Draco’s mouth snapped closed around the button-down instead. Harry couldn’t bother to look at his face.
Draco would never call him a pet name.
At twenty-three, Harry feels even younger than when the battle first ended.
Everything had changed so drastically, so quickly in the span of one evening.
Harry leads them to a small bakery around the corner, and Draco finds a seat by the large windows while he goes to order. It’s beginning to snow outside, little spots of white stippling the glass. Draco pulls his cap down to cover his ears.
“Observant, isn’t he?” Draco says, as though he’s trying to show off Harry to the group.
Harry looked at the man next to him, his gaze turning cold at a familiar face wearing an unfamiliar expression.
Ginny snorts, flicking her wand again and sending the yellow jumper directly into the rubbish bin.
“Don’t do that with me,” Harry says, but it comes out as more of a question. “We’re equals in this relationship.”
“I bought it for you,” Harry says. “Keep it.”
It came on quick, the wave of pleasure, and crested atop Draco as he rutted against the bed.
Harry suppresses the urge to roll his eyes because the statement couldn't get more Draco than that. “And why’s that?” he asks.
As Harry peruses the shelves for a specific book on Magical Contract Law that she had requested, Draco has found a book and is already settling into a cushy chair to read. Harry watches him intently, noticing how his eyes seem to devour the words. He spends much more time than he needs to on each page, flipping back to take note of what he’s already read. It’s far different from the way Harry skims through anything he’s assigned like it’s a chore. Draco seems to really enjoy the act of reading without the frills.
Draco was combing through
“It could be,” Harry says. “There are organizations and people that are trained to help with this sort of thing you know, I could connect you—”
He had known he was acting incredibly juvenile but couldn’t help it. Malfoy always managed to bring that side out of him.
Hermione groaned, pressing her fingers to her temples. “Ronald, how many times do I have to tell you, he will tell us when he’s ready!” Her breath was growing irregular, which happened when she was stressed and overwhelmed.
He doesn’t really feel sick anymore.
For a moment, Harry stared down at the hard lines of Draco’s dress shoes. He admired the soft curve of the silver buckle, a small spot of wet mud on the tip. Harry blinked and they were gone. Draco’s wedding band, abandoned on the mulch.
That way, he’d never try to leave again.
The Healer’s eyes narrowed. “Mr Malfoy, we know you’ve been abusing substances for some time now. Tests indicate this has been in your system for years.”
“Eager, isn’t it?” Draco remarks.
He steadies Draco next to him in his arms, thoroughly resisting the urge to wrap him up and never let go. Draco looks down at him through his eyelashes, and Harry feels his heart almost give out right there.
“You should tell him.”
“Harry, I brought—” Ron begins, but stops in the entrance to the kitchen, his mouth hanging open and low into an o-shape. He holds a stack of files in his hand.
and soft light filtered into their little area. It felt cozier than Harry was willing to admit. They sat down on the small blanket, their knees touching just slightly. Harry hoped Draco couldn’t sense his racing pulse.
“I’m not gonna last if you keep on like that,” Harry slurred, high from the Cannabis and the sight of Draco’s fingers rubbing at him so gently.
Harry wished from the furthest reaches of his soul that he could. He felt the words, the truth, come, and almost cast them out into the peaceful silence of the evening. Instead, he shrugged the blanket from his shoulders and walked back inside.
“You don’t like this?” Carrow chuckled, gripping harder. His eyes glittered with an insatiable appetite. “I love making boys like you hurt.”
“I gave you the potion on purpose. An experiment, if you will. I didn’t know if you’d use it or not, but I knew I’d be able to tell from the photos in the papers. Do you know why Auror Potter?”
Harry was shocked at the revelation but is unable to express it well. Instead, he wants to argue Snape’s statement. When he begins to open his mouth, Snape gives Harry a bruising glare.
Draco sighs but obligingly steps into the front room. He’s not allowed here often – Forsythe doesn’t want customers seeing him and doesn’t half trust him besides - but the man has always been self-serving first. If it’s in his best interest to let Draco close the front he will do so, trust or not. Draco locks up the cases in the front as well, sweeps and mops these floors, and wipes down the windows, door, and case-fronts. He knows that Forsythe doesn’t do all of this daily, but it’s expected when Draco’s the one closing the front. He doesn’t mind, and he works languidly – he has nowhere to be after all, and the shop is warm.
He glances over at his ‘kitchen’ – a battered old stove that only works half the time, a tiny ice box, and a folding table as a counter – but the only food he has left is a half-frozen loaf of bread. He weighs the effort of toasting some on the stove, but there’s no guarantee that it will turn on and he’s has limited time before he is due at work. Besides, he’d had breakfast yesterday – eating again so soon would be wasteful.
“If I have to go out and buy a healing potion it will take up time,” he says reasonably. “Surely it would be better to just –“
Thankfully, it is not too much further to his job and he’s soon slipping into the back door of Forsythe’s Potions and Apothecary. He releases a relieved breath as a wave of warm air hits him, and takes a moment to stand and relish the feeling of comfort it brings. The sting in his palm makes itself known again after another moment, and Draco heaves a sigh.
He spends the rest of the day there, warm and cozy, curled in a squishy armchair in a homey library, pouring over a tome on wandless magic, and it’s the best afternoon he’s had in recent memory. He only leaves when the library closes, walking slowly Diagon and enjoying the way the festive lights sparkle against the night dark.
“You don’t even know me!” Protests Draco, rolling his eyes. Potter leans forward again.
Potter laughs. “It’s a new blend, very high in demand. This is the only shop in Britain that carries it, because it’s so bloody expensive, but Hermione and the owner… don’t exactly get along.” Draco raises an eyebrow, curious as to what Granger has possibly done. “Hermione took very public umbrage to Walker’s use of Sicilian Silk Bat silk,” Potter explains. “It’s lucky any of us are allowed in here at all.”
“Thank you,” he replies, quiet but honest. Potter beams at him, and Draco smiles back as he sips at his drink, which he is delighted to find is hot chocolate.
Draco looks up at him, surprised. No traditions – none at all? Catching the look, Potter expounds, “The muggles”, which was no clearer.
They settle into a cozy sort of quiet, just enjoying one another’s company. Potter hums along with the wireless, and Draco alternates between peeking glances at him and gazing around the café. At length, he catches sight of another Muggle putting his little camera box to his ear, and frowns.
Ugbert pulls him in closer, a hand sliding down Draco’s torso and hip to cup his behind. Draco raises his chin, fighting to keep his expression neutral. “The potion, Ugbert.” He reminds him. Ugbert leers at him.
But his garments still hang too loosely on his thin frame, ragged and torn and not flattering at all. His gloves have so many holes that they scarcely count as gloves, his coat is threadbare, his pants are patched and baggy, and his boots are one hard knock away from falling apart. Draco scoffs at himself and turns away from the mirror. What is he doing, trying to primp himself, trying to look attractive? Those days are long past.
as boiled water sounds,” he says, “how about we get that hot chocolate I promised you instead?”
“Ugbert.” Returns Draco, keeping his voice as bland as possible. “I require a healing potion.”
Draco’s head is spinning. For a charm to be built into a garment and not fade as the magic wears away, it has to be woven into the fabric itself. To properly make such a coat, the charm has to be applied continuously throughout the creation process. It’s finicky, time-consuming, and very, very expensive. “Potter, this is far too much,” he protests.
“That was amazing,” Potter says, his voice awed. A wave of warmth settles over Draco, and he looks up, surprised. “Until you master self-contained spells,” Potter says with a wink, putting away his wand. Draco’s cheeks heat further, and he tucks his face into the collar of his coat to hide the silly smile spreading across his face.
Potter soon comes back, levitating a mug of something steaming, that’s topped generously with whipped cream, and a freshly toasted bagel in front of him. It’s soon followed by a platter of pastries that slides into place between them. Draco blinks at these and then looks questioningly up at him. “What are these then?” he asks. Potter flushes.
It’s somewhat slow going, but the way that Potter’s eyes light up as he manages to travel a few paces without the threat of wiping out makes it entirely worth it to Draco. “That’s right, just like that,” he encourages. “You make a half-decent penguin, Potter.” He pauses and grins, and Potter throws him a dirty look.
“It’s…Merlin-” Potter flounders, “it’s like an owl?”
Draco clings closer to Potter and eyes the racing vehicles nervously, glad that Potter doesn’t seem inclined to put him down. Potter glances down at him, and his green eyes dance in amusement even as he says, “Sorry, I should have warned you it was in Muggle London. It can be a bit overwhelming the first time.”
Giving in to that weakness, however, means that his groceries for the week is going to be a loaf of bread again. “Nice work, you thrice-cursed idiot,” he mutters to himself, pocketing the coins.
The owl swoops in immediately, offering him its leg while darting looks around his shabby little apartment. “Sorry, I don’t have any treats for you,” Draco apologizes as he unties the satchel. The owl hoots disapprovingly, but thankfully it’s too well-trained to peck at him. Raptor beaks are sharp, and he doesn’t fancy having bloodied fingers.
“Sorry, I don’t follow,” he says, tilting his head in confusion. “What muggles?”
“Oh my god, are you alright? I’m so sorry!” Says Potter in that voice that has never failed to make Draco shiver. Hearing it now in person is even more spine-tingling. Large, strong hands come up to brush away the snow now covering Draco’s coat and hair, and Draco’s entire body heats with entwined desire and mortification.
It’s a new coat, black and thick looking. When he lifts it out of the box, it falls long and heavy and surely down to his knees at the very least. In the box underneath it is a new hat, scarf, socks, and fur-lined gloves. Draco looks at Potter, slack-jawed and completely speechless.
Draco looks at it, slightly panicked. Are they exchanging gifts? Is that what they’re doing?
“Sorry, I didn’t know how to stop,” he says.
Potter walks with him back to the library, where he needs to meet up with Granger, and Draco is almost regretful as they arrive.
A couple of hours go in which Draco remains deeply engrossed in his study. The library is busy, but overall quiet, and nobody disturbs him in his little corner of the world. Then, he hears that unforgettable voice.
The librarian catches sight of him and gives him her usual smile. “Hello dear,” she says, as she does every day. Draco returns the smile, genuinely happy to see her friendly face.
Potter laughs. “Maybe that’s what we want you to think,” he says. He’s tucked his hands back into his pockets now, and Draco watches him carefully, worried that he might misbalance and fall without them. Potter has proven rather uncoordinated on the ice.
Face heating further, Draco rushes to deflect the attention. He huffs. “Oh yes, by all means Potter, do sit down. Thank you for asking, no I’m not doing anything, I’d love the company, et cetera et cetera.”
Draco looks up then. Potter seems intent on plying him with free food and drink, and he’s not willing to turn them down when he gets them so rarely. “Okay,” he says, his voice unsteady from the cold.
“Don’t,” he warns, but Draco only laughs.
It’s more fun that Draco expects, teaching Potter. He’s never been a great teacher, always impatient and tetchy, but having Potter’s incredible body draped all over him every time Potter doesn’t succeed is great motivation for him to put up with it.
Potter is still looking at him expectantly, and he burns in embarrassment at failing such a simple task as deciding his drink. “Surprise me,” he hedges. Potter nods, starting to turn away, and Draco adds hastily, “but make it sweet!” He feels his cheeks flush again as Potter chuckles.
There’s a moment of waiting, then the door is yanked open and Draco is face to face with his boss – Edgar Forsythe Charles, a short, squat, beady-eyed man with a pencil thin moustache and oil-slicked black hair. “Malfoy,” he barks. “What have I told you about disturbing me?”
He slips off his coat and gloves and hangs them on a hook on the back wall. Then he pauses, taking a moment to lean his head against the wall – he is exhausted already though the day has just begun - before turning and going up to the door separating the backroom from the front of store. He stops again there and draws a deep, fortifying breath, steeling himself – facing his boss is never a pleasant ordeal – before he raises a hand to rap sharply on the door.
It’s almost warm when Draco wakes, and the sun is bright through his ragged curtains. A smile crosses his face, unbidden, as he recalls the previous day. It’s almost unbelievable that Potter, with whom he had spent so long in a miserable rivalry, is the one to provide such a pleasant afternoon to him. Then again, it’s probably the human conversation and good food responsible for his mood – no need to attribute it to Potter. He stretches luxuriously and spends some time just basking in the warm sun and his own happiness.
“Emory,” he says, thinking of the dashing love interest in the romance novel sitting on his bed. “Emory Hughes.”
“Surely you don’t mean to carry me the entire way there,” he says.
Draco raises an eyebrow of his own and looks pointedly around the empty café. “That may be a hardship, what with this crowd, but I’ll try my very best,” he cheeks. Potter outright laughs at that.
But Draco hasn’t come this far to turn back now, so he draws in a steadying breath, steels his nerves, and steps out of Knockturn and onto the snow-covered cobblestone of Diagon Alley. And, in the grand scheme of things, very little changes. He steps from one street to another. But to Draco, the moment feels weighty, monumental. He takes another step, then a third, looking around in delight.
“You’re on Potter,” he says, and darts off. Potter, to his credit, doesn’t try and outdo his own abilities and by the time Draco’s coming up behind him he’s made it a quarter way around the rink and hasn’t fallen down yet.
Draco stiffens. What can he say? He doesn’t know what might trigger Potter into remembering him. “There isn’t much to tell,” he says eventually, staring unseeingly at his book.
“No Hermione, I said I’d do it,” he says.
“I got my prize, though, didn’t I?” He asks quietly in Draco’s ear. Draco doesn’t answer, too busy clinging to Potter for dear life to even feel flustered at Potter being so close.
I have problem with tone sometimes aaaa
By late afternoon, Draco has finished sorting through the new shipment and moves on to preparing the ingredients Forsythe with need for the list of potions he’s preparing for tomorrow. There is a lull from the front of house, no customers having come in for the past forty or so minutes. The wireless fills the silence, now into a newscast about the case that Potter and Granger have presented to the Wizengamot.
How he wishes he could just tell Forsythe what for and leave this ignominious job behind, but the truth is that he’s lucky to have it. When he’d been released from Azkaban, he’d found a world that had no place for him – he was hated from both sides, both for being a Death Eater and for not being a committed enough one. He’d been at wits end, on the brink of starvation, when he’d found Forsythe. The old miser had thankfully been more enticed by the idea of exploitable labour than turned off by Draco’s identity. Forsythe may hate him, treat him like shit, and underpay him, but he’d given him the job and that was more than Draco can say of anyone else.
He touches Potter’s arm gently, hoping the other man doesn’t feel how he’s trembling, and says “Don’t worry if you need to go shopping Potter. The ice will be there tomorrow.” He hopes Potter agrees. He’d much rather chance that the weather will be warmer tomorrow. He doesn’t know how he’ll manage to get on the ice today.
Then again, maybe it’s embarrassing just to go out dressed as he is. He looks himself over critically in his chipped little mirror, taking in his appearance and grimacing. He’s scrawny, malnourished and it shows, his naturally sharp features turned harsh and unattractive. His hair is neither as glossy nor as healthy as it once had been but it’s not greasy either. He fiddles with it until it lays in an acceptable wave, framing and softening his face.
There’s something about the Manor at Christmas that looks entirely too cosy for Harry’s liking. Warm and inviting yellow lights glow from large bay windows, and Harry can see a Christmas tree, decorated with embellished bulbs, just inside. The estate seems alive in a way that it hadn’t been to Harry when he’d been here during the war. There is colour and life to the whole place that makes him uneasy. He thinks it's unfair that Malfoy lives in what appears to be a welcoming and enchanting home while Harry’s place is so cold that it looks like it belongs to someone else completely.
Draco groans, “Merlin, I don’t want to be one of your projects.”
And really, Mind Healers weren’t supposed to go around sharing confidential information with their patient’s spouse. But Harry was the Saviour, and exceptions were made for him, as they usually were.
“We only have leftovers, unless you want me to make something,” Harry said.
Malfoy looked down at his clothes, his gaze ridiculing his own appearance. His wand was out in a second, and he was back in uniform robes. Harry had temporarily forgotten how strange it was to see Malfoy wearing, of all Muggle clothing items, a sweatshirt.
Draco stared blankly at Harry’s face as though he were waiting for him to reveal it was all a joke. When he didn’t, Draco fidgeted a bit before standing up. “Well, that’s odd. But alright, let’s do it.”
He had his trousers down in an instant, turning Draco around so that the side of his face pressed uncomfortably rough against the wall. Draco struggled, but Harry had already pinned his wrists up above his head. He had to stop this.
If plants often deviated from most wizard’s innate understanding of what they healed, this could be his shot. The Silybum, or whatever it was called, could shut the voice up in his head once and for all. And if it didn’t work, then there would be no harm done.
Draco answered without meaning to when whatever curse or draught twisted it out of him. In some ways, it felt like being administered Veritaserum. A stream of words flowed unconsciously. “I saw you and that woman. She gave you a potion, a vial of something.”
“What?” Pansy says, turning to face him.
more times than he can count. Something pricks at the edges of his eyes, and its only moments before tears stream relentlessly down his cheeks, and his eyes burn like a fire.
“You alright?” Harry asks, as Draco flushes.
Harry is taken aback. “You’re not embarrassing me, Draco. I just want to know if you’re alright.”
He was in a bed, maybe located at the center of the room, and linen white curtains had been drawn around the bedside. Harry and a Healer, maybe, were speaking from just beyond the barrier, clearly unaware that Draco had woken at the noise.
He Summons the lube from the bedside table, and it clatters out noisily from the drawer. He drizzles a fair amount onto his fingers before slicking up Draco’s hole, encouraging him open in lazy circles. Draco hisses as Harry presses a first finger in, and then slowly a second.
The rest of the day is spent in a flurry, Harry and Draco joking around as they bounce from shop to shop picking out personal presents for each member of the Weasley family and enjoying the cheer in the air. Draco’s mood is looking up, and he can’t stop thumbing through the pages of his new novel. Harry feels his heart swell at the sight.
“As many of you who’ve been in group with me before know, I am a former Death Eater.”
“Of course you didn’t,” Draco drawls, his features cold and pointy and undeniably unpleasant. “You’re unobservant.”
“I don’t blame you,” he says, blankly.
“More than Zabini, at least.” Draco snorted, “never trust a Slytherin.”
Now Draco’s interest had been piqued. “The Janus Thickey Ward?” His eyebrows had shot up unintentionally. “What does it do?”
“Your breath is abhorrent.” Draco wrinkled his nose, but there was a distinct fondness in his gaze. Just for that, Harry gave him another kiss, to which Draco protested loudly.
“I know,” Harry says sincerely. “I’m so proud of you, it’s unbelievable.”
The statement had been one he’d come to repeat often in the weeks following New Year’s Eve. Draco had practically moved into Grimmauld Place, and with him, he brought light and joy to both Harry and the home itself.
“You know...” Zabini shook his head. “Draco has no one anymore. And if you intend to lead him to a place where he believes he finally might have someone, only to pull the rug out from under him, I will finish what the Dark Lord started with you myself.”
Harry hums a happy response: “You better.”
“Do you think if you weren’t high right now we’d be having a normal conversation?” Harry asks, countering Draco’s question with one of his own.
“What if it’s someone I don’t know?” Harry asks, mostly to himself.
“Okay,” Harry said slowly and thoughtfully. “But the other day you said it was nice to have an objective party like her to talk to when you needed to.”
Harry switched their butterbeer in a flash, sipping at Malfoy’s contentedly. The Slytherin reached his arm around to snatch the mug back, but Harry’s reflexes were always a tad quicker.
Harry shrugged. “This is our home. You’re allowed to be here whenever.”
“Draco?” he called out into the empty house. He breathed, attempting to slow his heartbeat at the lack of a response.
So Harry forced himself to calm down and made for the bedroom, wondering what Draco would want to eat for dinner that evening. Maybe he’d cook something special for them. Something French like a coq au vin or bouillabaisse would make Draco’s day, even if he were already having a pretty good one. He loved the simple intricacy of French foods, the addition of wine wherever needed in a sea of flavour. Harry remembered they’d grown a nice batch of pearl onions in the week prior that would do perfectly in a hearty homemade dish.
"Stop." Draco held out a hand in front of his face, and something red flared up inside of Harry.
“There’s nothing else I can do but give him this potion and hope he gets better?” Harry had said, worry ringing out in his tone.
Pansy took a breath, as though she were calculating her thoughts. “Something is wrong with Draco.”
Harry curses her in that moment. She always seems to wax poetic about his love life but chooses the precisely wrong moment to be so straightforward.
“Merlin,” Draco breaths, raising an eyebrow. “You forced me out of bed to do errands with you?”
Summer season for the Aurors was never as busy as expected. Criminals never really stopped being criminals, but things certainly slowed down as the humidity made everyone just the slightest bit lazier. Harry took more days off than he could count, but no one cared too much because who wanted to work in the summer anyway? Draco did, of course. He had left for work early, as usual, after drinking his tea and agreeing to stay with Harry.
His eyes reluctantly followed the noise, settling upon a man standing at the head of the table. His stature revealed he’d been the one to buy Draco a drink earlier in the evening. He held two burnt auburn drinks in his hands, sliding one across the table and taking a seat next to Draco. The bar had quieted at his movement but resumed raucous conversation when they realised the man’s attention had focused somewhere else.
“He was only a boy. Just like you.” Snape spoke, softer than before. Softer than Harry had ever heard the man speak.
“Are you ready?” Draco asks, from the foyer. Claude leaps out of his arms to stand defensively in front of him as Harry enters the room. The damn cat has become entirely too protective.
Draco felt used when he saw himself like this.
He was good at his job. He enjoyed the frenetic and fast-paced world of finance that he’d drowned himself in after the war. It gave him purpose. Numbers were much easier to understand than people, and Gringotts had provided such a relief for so many years. It had been a constant when everything was different and changing. Draco couldn’t imagine quitting a job he’d devoted much of his heart and life to.
When Harry and Ron touched down at the Apparition point set up by the DMLE, a crowd had already gathered. Hoots and hollers infiltrated Harry’s ears as passersby watched him approach the scene. He cringed inwardly, but Ron didn’t seem bothered by the spectacle they were causing. He’d gotten rather used to it, apparently.
“I don’t know if I want to leave him.”
“The lights are cheesy.”
“Of course I did.”
“I can understand that,” Harry offers. He looks out the window to see two children playing in the snow. “Do you know who yours is yet?”
A genuine smile colors Harry’s features for the first time in a long time, “In another life, we would have been best friends Draco.”
He ventures out of the sitting room and back into the foyer where a set of steep steps ascend into a dark hallway. Harry’s unsure if anyone is upstairs at all, but he’s feeling confident and drunk and like Lavender would know what she was talking about.
“Oh,” he mutters, entirely to himself, pushing forward without thought.
Harry sits with the silence for a moment, and Draco leans back down on the pillow. He pats the open area next to him, and Harry lies down, too. It would be more strange if there wasn’t a valley of space between their bodies.
“What will it do to me?”
. I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to him, but we love you and we’ll try.”
Momentarily Malfoy looked a bit like his old self, less business-like and more perpetually irritated. It eased Harry’s mind to see something familiar again.
Draco was depressed, the Mind Healer had told them.
Harry had advanced, like a lion, high from the euphoria of the moment before a kill. Something unruly in his eyes told Draco that he’d already been beaten.
Ginny looked sad. “We love Harry and want what is best for him too. But this relationship is taking a toll on both of you.”
“Draco!” Hermione exclaims, rushing in front of Harry with open arms. “You are
“Your recovery should be yours,” Harry says with a firm resolve, because he’s thought about this before. “I want to be there for you in every possible way that I can, but it’s important that you establish your own reasons for staying sober. I can’t be the only one.”
Hermione makes an impatient nose. “Alright, shoo now, before you see him.”
Harry swallowed uncomfortably. It was a disturbing revelation to realise his mind wasn’t entirely his own. He stood from the table, making for the exit hastily.
But Draco knew his walk home and was confident there would be something along the way.
Because, for now, this is enough.
Harry pulled it up an arm’s length from the bed, as though they were colleagues, maybe distant friends. Not husbands, or life partners.
“What the fuck,” Harry says, eagerly going in for another bite. “This is unreal.”
“You must be fun at parties,” Draco jokes. “Get it? Because we’re at a party.”
Harry paused for a moment as his magic stretched out in long hot tendrils around his body. Seconds later, he shattered every window in the house.
“So you said.” Harry paused, his mouth hardening into a thin line. “And you require nothing in return for it?”
The previous summer, Harry had attempted to cultivate a rare strain of azaleas that Neville had acquired on his last trip to Asia. He had promised Harry that if he had been unable to care for them, he shouldn’t worry, because Azaleas, in general, were some of the hardest flowers to take care of. But Harry had insisted anyway that they wouldn’t be a problem, and when the first few had come into bloom, he had wanted to gloat. He had been desperately excited that he was the exception to a long-standing rule. The flowers were a beautiful and deep orange with a ring of rosy pink at their rims. The stems, surprisingly, were an eggplant purple. Neville had told him that the best way to measure the health of a wizarding plant was through the state of its stem. Harry had been in the middle of writing an optimistic note to Neville about the success when he had glanced outside and the flowers had curled in on themselves. What remained had been unpleasantly wilted petals and stems that had turned a horrible shade of grey.
“Don’t you think we’re too old for last names?”
Harry figured he’d never use it, but still tucked the vial safely into his bag. The shopkeeper was starting to squint at him funny again, so it would be best to make a quick exit.
“He confessed what seems like ages ago. Shacklebolt had said they wanted the story to make paper headlines first thing the morning after, but I guess there must have been some kind of delay.”
A distinct chill settled over the small valley that their cottage was settled in, and Harry went cold. Something was wrong. He looked around as though the answer to what felt off was waiting for him by the willow tree in the corner, or the chocolate cosmos in the bush to Harry’s left side. But all of his plants were still and unmoving in the wind, and somehow that felt...wrong.
So negative thoughts about Harry were off-limits as well. Clearly, his subconscious wanted him to fix his marriage, maybe more than he did himself. Draco thought back to the night before when he’d said things he could never have imagined himself saying. It all seemed hazy and unclear, like a bit of a fever dream that he was clinging to the memory of. There had been no pain yesterday, but he had certainly been unable to control his words. Though at the time, he’d attributed it to one too many glasses of wine. Did he even drink any wine? He cursed himself for being unable to remember.
“Thank you!” Draco yelped, afraid any lag would incite any more pain.
Ginny, though, nodded understandingly. Wouldn’t she, of all people, know when Draco wasn’t telling the truth? Was what he had said even the truth? Confusion bubbled inside of him like a tetchy cauldron.
Draco opened the box of green plants again, and the unpleasant smell polluted the clearing. Harry wrinkled his nose. “Muggles call it weed, which is a foul name for it. They ought to use its proper name Cannabis. It’s a specific strain from a family of flowering plants called–”
In recent days, Draco made his decisions based on his head-demon, which he had named with a vengeance.
He easily picks up Draco from the couch, heading for his bedroom because he’s hard-pressed to leave Draco anywhere out of his sight for the next few hours. He shoos Claude from the bed when he enters. Setting him down gently on the bed, Harry tugs off Draco’s trousers and tucks the boy underneath the blankets.
“Morale is low,” Hermione says, paging listlessly through a copy of
Seamus smiles, “I’m alright, Harry. Hope you are, too.”
It wasn’t as though he’d been offered any of the larger cases, and he would have taken them in a heartbeat if only to feel like he was doing something productive. At least there was this.
Ron, at least, didn’t feign ignorance. “She is. But you are family to Hermione and me before anyone else.”
Draco looks even more wrecked than when Harry had seen him in the Ministry.
Harry suppresses a sound of surprise, eyes widening from behind his glasses. “Merlin, no, he’s not dead!”
Harry pinches his brow and forces himself to breathe past the pounding of his heart. He knows it’s not his place, but in a way that Draco doesn’t know about, it kind of is. His hand reaches out almost mechanically, tapping Draco’s shoulder and easing him back over. Draco looks up at Harry through long, white eyelashes. Harry remembers why he thought Draco looked ethereal in the week before. It’s clear now with gentle moonlight streaming in through the large windows, casting black shadows over the room. Draco’s eyes practically sparkle with life, and it’s a disconcerting contrast to the rest of his fading physique.
There’s no answer for much longer than he expects, and he taps his toes impatiently against the welcome mat. It pleasantly reads:
“No, thanks,” Harry says.
Quickly, a hand pressed into his forehead, holding his head back down against the pillow. Another opened his mouth, tipping inside something that tasted suspiciously of nothing at all. Sleeping Draught perhaps, Draco thought, as the images around him swirled into darkness.
The thought of even going to the Manor sets Harry on edge more than he’d been the entire morning. There’s something still so visceral and raw that he remembers about the place. Too many terrible memories living within its walls.
“You’re worrying me,” Narcissa said, moving to stand. “I’m going to fetch Healer Clove. You may be having a reaction.”
“Do you love me, still?” Harry asked into the silence, the question obviously self-serving.
He’s still high as far as Harry can tell, sipping something out of a cup, his head rested lazily back on the wall where he’s leaned up, his jaw slack and open, exposing white teeth. His eyes flit erratically across the crowd, bouncing across objects in the room.
all those years ago. He moaned shamelessly at the sight of his husband’s bare chest, one he hadn’t seen since their Hogwarts days.
“You know your way out.” Harry nodded to Pansy, keeping his voice as even as he could bear.
“I’m an Auror, Pansy, or did you forget? I could detain you right here for even
There was nothing else clearer than the fact that he was completely and utterly screwed.
That worked.
“You love me, but you’re giving up on me,” Harry said pragmatically.
“Could I—” he gestures at the clothes Harry is wearing.
“We should have Ginny and Pansy over for dinner. It might be fun, like the old days. I miss our friends.”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked warily, skin creasing in his forehead. “What just happened?”
nervous? You have this in the bag.”
“Mr. Potter.” She says grimly, indicating for him to sit down in the armchair across from her. He does so stiffly and uncomfortably. “I did not ask you here for an apology. So I will hear none of that, am I clear?”
Harry felt as though a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He was growing increasingly accustomed to Draco’s presence and had been a little lonely all week without him.
“I won’t complain,” Draco replies, attaching himself to Harry’s side and nuzzling into his neck. “I could stay like this forever.”
Malfoy pushed Harry’s wand, stiffly from his chest, “I can do that myself.”
He climbs down the stairs to what looks like the site of a crime scene. Red cups are strewn across the shag carpet in the sitting room, and various bodies lay positioned on armchairs and sofas passed out from the night of heavy drinking. Seamus is curled up on a disgustingly ornate chaise lounge. Harry feels more hungover after seeing him than he did before. The winter chill outside does nothing for the state of his body either.
promise I’m sober.”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, voice wavering.
“It is, essentially, a bottled Imperius Curse.” Shacklebolt moved forward with quiet authority. “One can understand why, if possessed by the wrong hands, this substance could wreak havoc on our community.”
“Harry, you’ve never done something like that to me before,” Draco said, his voice quivering and small. “During sex, I mean.”
“I find myself regretting the niceties.” Draco chuckled, pausing at the street corner and awaiting direction.
“Stuffed peppers for dinner?” Harry mused, reaching a hand out for the vegetables. They hadn’t eaten something creative like that in a while.
“Fuck,” he gasped, rummaging through the drawer on his side of the bed. None of his distinctly purple liquid was found.
“I don’t want to go to St Mungo’s.”
“Don’t you always know what to do?” Pansy scowls.
“So you think dinner will just cancel that out,” Harry jokes, dying to break a bit of the serious tension laden over the room.
Draco seems to linger on the question for a few moments, but he ultimately chooses not to answer. His lips close, pressing thin and hard into a tight line. A strand of white-blond hair falls from behind his ear, draping gently in front of his right eye. Harry has a sudden, inexplicable urge to reach out and push it away. To run the flat of his thumb down the sharp edge of Draco’s cheekbone, following the line of his nose, to part pink lips with a single, gentle push.
“They’re just danishes —”
Still, he wouldn’t qualify them as best friends. The past thirteen years had taught him that Hermione and Ron filled those slots, even if they were a little too busy with their own lives to remember sometimes.
let go. Harry’s face buries deep into Malfoy’s neck, still feeling warmth emanating from his body and seeking out more of it. He doesn’t mind that blood begins to obscure his vision, Malfoy is alive, he has to be. He has no choice. Harry simply rocks against Malfoy’s body in a haze of disbelief.
Harry was fumbling with his belt buckle, eyes driven wild with lust. “You need me,” he rasped, words slurring and incoherent against his tongue.
“An average name to match an average face,” she murmured, heaving a large leather-bound book onto the countertop. She flipped through the book uninterestedly until it was open to a page near the back. Then she ran a long and manicured fingernail down the row of names before finally coming to a pause. Without a word, she disappeared somewhere into the back.
“You wouldn’t consider us friends?” Harry quirks a smile. “I’d say we get along rather well now.”
“Don’t say that,” Ron said. “Of course you do. You have to.”
Hermione lets out a laugh. “You don’t see the way he looks at you.”
Harry doesn’t know if he’s too sleepy to register what he’s doing, but he pulls Draco’s cold body close into his chest, closing his eyes to the sound of his soft breathing in the pillow. He presses his forehead gently against Draco’s, who exhales, relieved in his arms.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry bawled, tears swimming lazily through his vision as he clutched Draco closer to his chest. “I never meant for this to happen. If I could go back in time, I’d change everything. I would do anything, Draco, anything. Oh, God —”
“You have to start calling me Harry again.”
“It’s Christmas Eve,” Draco pointed out more weakly than he would’ve liked. “I just wanted to spend time together.” It was a vulnerable, unfounded response, and he knew it. But maybe playing the role of lonely husband would garner him a bit of sympathy.
“I love you,” Draco said. He meant it most of the time, but other times he said it to appease the voice inside of his head to which he had somehow become a slave.
Luna nodded. “I suppose you’re right. When you think about it, your subconscious is just an expression of your deepest and darkest desires. Your conscious mind decides to either reward the subconscious and give it what it wants or ignore it and keep it at bay.”
settling into a relaxing summer, and then this happens!” Ron groaned, shuffling papers around his desk before looking at Harry, who was sat on the other side.
Draco doesn’t smile, and he shifts uncomfortably underneath the covers. He opens his mouth as though he’s going to say something but neglects to do so.
Pansy reached out to smack him, but he darted out of the way just in time.
Draco surveyed him with terror in his eyes that Harry couldn’t place. His fear excited Harry, like the thrill of a fresh kill on a particularly strenuous hunt. He knew it was the potion’s effects that were causing such a reaction, and that the interrogation earlier in the day should have been reason enough for him to stop administering it. But something in the back of his mind demanded him not to dare. He listened to it, unflinchingly.
Kipsy can barely contain her excitement, nodding her head vigorously. She Disapparates with another pop and a wide smile on her face.
“You can call me Harry.”
Harry nodded in response, but Draco cut in. “We’re just in for a visit, we should leave soon anyway–”
“It’s not a question of whether you want to or not. I hope you know that.” Hermione shakes her head. “Things in life have never been easy for you, Harry. You’ve survived so much. Don’t let this be the one thing that ruins all of that.”
“Harry, you just
,” Portrait Draco says crossly, “We’ll I’ll be reporting back to my father of course, and he’ll have something to say about this.”
Draco had felt his throat tighten at the revelation. Could the medicinal plant be of potential use to him? Maybe it would effectively quiet the noise inside his head and subdue the shattering headaches that occurred whenever he so much as disagreed with Harry.
Draco offers a small smile. “Don’t get too comfortable yet, then. We have plenty more years for me to do that.”
“When you said you didn’t deserve a soulmate,” Harry begins, “it broke my heart.”
At first, Harry had been uncomfortable by the prospect of it. He maintained nowhere near Hermione’s level of infinite compassion for animals, though handing Lyra live prey made his stomach turn. After Draco had yelled at him to “grow up,” Harry forced himself to overcome the uneasiness. It was a habit now anyway.
“I don’t see why you couldn’t open one,” Harry shrugs. “Life’s too short to not be doing something that you love.”
“Dragon.”
Harry shakes his head. “It was really overwhelming for me. The Weasleys are amazing. They’re unbelievable, actually. Changed my life in so many ways that I could never thank them enough for. Their hearts are so open, you know? So willing to let anyone in.”
Cherry colored water puddles in the middle of the room, converging around a nearly lifeless body. It would be hard to tell if Malfoy was alive if he wasn’t struggling to inhale with every passing second.
“I don’t – I don’t feel well,” Draco said, Harry’s touch suddenly smothering him. The comforting cool press of the wall and chilly breeze of the night had been replaced by heat and nausea from somewhere within Draco himself. He could keel over at any moment and empty the contents of his stomach onto Harry’s shoes.
Draco turns over, a lazy, lopsided grin on his features. “That was fucking great.”
No one moved to say so. Seamus’ eyes were hungry with excitement. Parvati was practically buzzing from across the table. Ron wouldn’t be happy that they’d been tasked with research, but he would keep his mouth shut because Hermione never wanted him to participate in dangerous undercover work anyway.
The pub was crowded for Christmas Eve. Draco couldn’t say that he’d ever been to Knockturn Alley around this time, but he was surprised, to say the least. Only one table was empty, and Draco made for it quickly without thinking twice. He’d have to blend in if he wasn’t going to be caught. Harry had settled at the bar, disrobing and claiming the seat next to him.
you can say no. I was thinking, it would be interesting for students to learn about Muggles of – well, of our own age.” Harry shrugged as Malfoy sat with the thought for a moment. “We’re eighteen, we wouldn’t look out of place at a university over here. It would be interesting to just observe people. See what Muggles are like there. It would be more fun than reading the paper.”
“The sun,” Draco breathed, crouching down on his knees and reaching into the planter box. He selected a round bell pepper, crimson in color, and held it in his hands. “We grew these together, Harry.”
Harry barely registered himself sending a Patronus to Ron. He’d alert the Aurors, which would cause an enquiry, but Harry needed a Healer and he needed one fast.
“I-uh, yes, I was. We went to Aberdeen.”
Then,
“I know.”
, Harry wants to say aloud, but he doesn’t because he’s barely known
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Not really. I would never peg you as the type to try any drug at all, even if you were drunk. And with Draco Malfoy, of all people?”
Harry waited for minutes, before drawing his head up to where she finally emerged. From her seat at the countertop, she had looked like a tall woman, but Harry noticed she only made it to well below his shoulders. Somehow that made her more intimidating than before.
“Thank you for sharing your story, Draco,” Azalea says, from the other side of the circle.
Draco’s eyes softened, and he reached across the table as though he were going to take Harry’s hand. He pulled it back hastily instead. “Seems as though I’m already lost, though, don’t you think?”
“Ah,” he gasps abruptly, knuckles whitening as his hands close into fists.
When Harry failed to agree immediately, Ron fixed him a confused gaze. “Am I missing something?”
He pulls out a pair of flannel pyjama bottoms and an old t-shirt of Ginny’s that would probably fit Draco more loosely than on Harry himself. Harry turns away as Draco dresses and notices it takes far longer than he expects.
“How was your day?” he asked, his voice brittle and cracked from disuse.
Draco runs his finger along the top of the book, pursing his lips as he thinks of how to explain what he means. “Our society is entirely built upon the assumption of magic,” he answers eventually. “Think of housing. At minimum, you’d want heating charms for the winter, wards, or even just magical locks. A Squib can’t do any of that. So, they either must rent somewhere that all of this is provided by the landlord, which is at extra cost mind you, or they must pay a third party to provide it for them. Heating charms and wards are not just a one-time thing either – they are a yearly expense at least. And it’s not cheap to have them done well.
Potter comes to a stop and turns to him. “I – um – I got you something,” he says, sounding uncharacteristically uncertain. He pulls a little box out of his coat and flicks his wand, unshrinking it. It’s long and silver, sparkling prettily and wrapped with a bow. Potter is furiously red as he offers it to Draco. “Think of it as an early Christmas present.”
The day only gets colder, however, and once he’s shivering so hard that the words in the book are impossible to make out, Draco gives in. He sets the book aside and tugs off his gloves with a sigh, furrowing his brow in concentration as he feels for the magic deep inside himself. It takes a moment to corral it and draw it out, doing his best to shape it as he whispers the incantation.
But no, it takes skill to have a transfigured object retain its new properties for any significant length of time, and transfiguration is more difficult to do wandless besides.
“Erm…no thank you,” he says regretfully. The old lady shrugs good-naturedly.
Draco listens to their questions though, mentally criticizing where Forsythe’s answers could be improved, either with the potions he suggests for their issues or – more rarely – the brewing advice he gives for potions.
“I always knew the Falcons had potential!” He proclaims loudly. “They just needed the right push. Good job that new bird joined and whipped them into shape.” Draco rolls his eyes. The ‘new bird’ – Ginny Weasley – has been with the team for over three years now. The customer opines that the Magpies are going to take back the title, and Draco tunes out the conversation as light bickering ensues.
It’s not injudicious that most Squibs choose to live among Muggles, even though they are of magical folk. At home they have a harder time making money, yet it costs them more to live.
Potter gives him a once over, smirks, and says, “I see that.” Draco sputters, red-cheeked. Is Potter flirting with him? No, that can’t be possible, he’s reading too much into it. That’s just to be expected when nobody’s talked to him like a human in years, he supposes – a single modicum of human decency is shown to him, and he thinks he’s being flirted with.
“Yes, very good,” he says, holding up his book and hiding his burning face behind it. “Now if you’ve quite finished interrupting my reading Potter…”
Draco flushes and looks down at his ratty boots. “I – ah – haven’t really learnt self-contained spells yet,” he mutters, embarrassed.
Then a customer comes in and demands that Forsythe change the channel. She and Forsythe begin wanking each other off about how very insulted they are about Saintly Potter trying to take away their servants. Draco rolls his eyes, but he can’t help feeling a little relieved that they’ve changed the channel. It’s hard for him to hear Potter’s voice – the feeling it brings up is mostly shame at how low he’s fallen while Potter is a shining beacon for the wizarding world, but there’s also the lingering feeling of desire that thoughts of Potter always arise.
“Save us a table,” says Potter as he joins the large queue waiting at the counter. Draco winds his way through the little shop, finding an empty two-top near a window at the back. He quickly snags a seat and turns to watch the brightly-lit Muggle street curiously.
Today is particularly freezing in fact. Draco showers for the couple of minutes of warmth he can steal, then bundles up in all of his outdoor clothes. He fishes out the one book he has – a sappy romance novel that he’d found under the bed when he’d moved in – and settles himself on the bed, wrapped in his blanket, to read it for the umpteenth time.
“Great,” he says, not wanting to entertain this but also not wanting to waste time arguing with dreamt-up wish magic. “What are you here for then?”
Harry’s chest feels heavy with anguish. “D’you know what he said to me when he realized he was dying?”
It had been a moment of clarity and peace for Draco that he’d found to be empowering. Forging his own path in life was something he’d been working on. And well, he’d been doing it splendidly.
Harry leapt to his feet; the blood rushed to his head, forcing him to take a beat before moving forward. He felt trapped in a dream state, moving slower than he intended to but unable to go any faster — sluggish against the impenetrable wall of time.
“Then why?” he asks, as though he doesn’t already know the answer
“Not like this, no.”
Locking eyes with himself in the mirror, Draco hardened his gaze. He was supposed to be stoic in the face of adversity, after all, a Malfoy until his dying day.
Harry’s stomach protested at the thought of any food at all.
Draco would never ask him about a case; he knew not to. He knew that Harry would break confidentiality any day to let his husband in on exciting information, which was precisely why Draco refused to pry. He wasn’t necessarily rule-oriented but knew that Harry would do anything he asked and then feel bad about it later.
Harry had yelped, but Draco barely heard it. He felt hands touching his body, but he was far too hot to stand it, pulling away instinctively. Sharp feeling splintered through his forehead as though someone was exploring it with a blade.
He points his wand at the wireless radio, turning it on with a quick swish. Something gentle comes through the speakers as Harry extracts a pan from the cabinet to fry an egg. He would make another, but Draco doesn’t seem like he has the stomach for breakfast this early.
“Draco,” Harry breathes, unsure if it would even be heard above the sound of pounding music that rattles through the walls of the house.
“Say you love me,” Harry said, and the potion twisted happily inside of him at the command.
Harry wakes at dawn to the sound of noises in the bathroom down the hall. He turns over on his side, steeling himself for a moment before retrieving a cup of fresh water from the kitchen and bringing it back up to Draco.
It’s only a few moments later that he’s leaving the room to give Draco and Narcissa privacy to speak. He worries for a fraction of a moment, that Narcissa will convince Draco to leave, to go back to his old life. Despite all of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, it’s sometimes still hard for Harry to remember that people have changed since the war, including the people he least expected to.
Draco doesn’t bother turning around, electing to flip Harry off instead.
A small, rational part of Draco knew he should never stand for such behaviour. But his mind, the voice in his head, lusted after it. He figured if there were a hard line that he wouldn’t want Harry to cross, his subconscious would be the first to tell him to stop. The voice inside of his head was on his side, wasn’t it? It had to be.
Draco cried out as Harry slammed inside without a second thought, pressing deep into his core.
Draco swallows, some of the anxiety disappearing from his features as Luna begins the ceremony.
Still, especially after their perfect Christmas, Harry had wondered if Draco would be able to pull himself out of the cycle. If he was using drugs to make himself happy, and he appears to be happier, then what is Harry doing wrong?
“Hello,” Harry said cautiously, reaching out to greet the pair across the coffee table. He withdrew it hastily when neither of the two offered anything back. “I’m so sorry for your loss,” he said with an earnest and searing resolve, hoping the family would understand how truly he meant it.
“Ron?” Harry mumbled, feeling around the nightstand for his glasses. When he managed to wrangle them onto his face, his best friend sat cautiously on the edge of his bed.
She holds out a ripped piece of parchment, folded in on itself, almost too crumbled to seem like anything important. He smooths it out in his palm, noticing the nearly illegible scratch of an address in crimson ink.
“I don’t just want the good parts of you,” Harry says simply. “I’m accepting it all.”
Harry snorts. “There’s no possible way you could know that.”
“Yeah,” Carrow replied, hand creeping up the length of Draco’s trousers, which were suddenly too tight for his taste. “Such a pretty little thing. So easy to defile something like you.”
“You are, though, on some level.” Ron grumbled. He was standing next to Hermione, who had just emerged from behind Mrs Weasley's quivering frame.
“Nice,” Harry repeats. “I think I’m sober now.”
“She’s not really mine,” Draco says, using two fingers to stroke between her eyes and down to her tailfeathers. She nuzzles happily into Draco’s chest, and Harry finds himself sitting with the horrific realisation that he wishes that were him.
“You do,” Harry says.
Turning his gaze, Draco focused back upon Harry, who was still alone. He ran his hand through distinctly brown hair, remembering his glamour and letting his nerves buzz in the background. There was no need to be nervous. Harry would never notice, and besides, he was far too occupied to care.
Draco knew nothing about the potion. He’d believed Harry about his subconscious — he probably thought of that initially, to be fair.
“Pity,” Draco says, removing his own wand from his boot. It isn’t the same one that Harry had given him back after the trials. Draco seems to notice the surprise. “Ten-inch vine wood, thestral tail hair.”
It was awfully stupid of Harry to show up without a disguise to such a public place. He supposed it was Knockturn, and no one would talk anyway, but it made Draco angrier to know that Harry wasn’t even bothering to hide in the shadows like the rest of the crowd at the bar.
Harry sat on the armchair, the one that, despite years of wear, remained functional. Splayed in his lap was a copy of something by Jack Kerouac, a Muggle author that Seamus mentioned enjoying. He couldn’t be bothered to flip the book on its frontside and relearn its title. Travel fiction was, admittedly, a boring genre, but at least he was doing something productive with his evening.
“Open your eyes, Draco,” Harry says softly.
“Something tragic and dramatic. Equal parts miserable and exciting.” Draco brings his fingers up to his face, translucent fingernails tracing circles around the skin of his cheek. “No one remembers a happy ending.”
It had been so long since Draco had teased Harry like this, and he could feel the tears behind his eyes before they came. They trailed down his face incessantly before he could swallow them in, and he felt weaker than ever before. Harry’s hand went to cover his mouth as he stifled a sob. He turned, hoping Draco would ignore him and just go back inside as he usually would. But strong arms wrapped around Harry from behind, and he felt a head press into his neck.
Harry is surprised at how little time it takes them to get there. He feels like he’s somehow smuggling him in, but Draco’s blonde hair is more of an eye turner than the wound on his face.
Harry nods his assent. “My partner comes here,” he says, unthinkingly.
Narcissa nods in agreement as Harry leads her inside. They approach the doorway to Ginny’s room and pause outside.
He frowns, touching his cheek gently, pulling his hand away to reveal a fresh layer of crimson on his fingertips.
Something felt terribly and irrefutably wrong, but he just couldn’t put a finger on it. Usually he was quite good at parsing out right from wrong, normal from abnormal. But what felt like an underlying sense of unsettlement was only growing as he Apparated to Diagon Alley.
Theo thumps his head down on the pillow, his eyes staring fixedly on the ceiling.
A team of nurses entered through the same door moments later to disrupt the calm, bustling around Draco and checking vital signs and reflexes.
“Consider it an early Christmas gift then,” Harry says. “I get them for everyone.”
. “I’m afraid I don’t have time for much else today. Maybe dinner if you really want?”
“Draco is gone.” Snape amends, bowing his head a bit and allowing just the tiniest hint of sadness to crease the lines in his face. If one were not looking for it, they would never notice. “He was a good boy, a perfect one, really. He just grew up in the wrong circumstances.”
“Yes.” Draco’s breathing became shallow. Why in the hell had he said that if he wasn’t even remotely ready? He wasn’t sure how his lips could’ve betrayed him like that when everything inside was screaming at him to stop.
“What did you see?” Harry asked, with a curious glint in his eye. His features were more calculating than before.
“No, I just know.”
The exact time that Draco returned home from work each night didn’t
“It’s naive of you to think that I was ever nice to you,” Draco says, gaze hardening against Harry’s own.
“Her sister seems to think this wasn’t an accident. Apparently, she would never do something like this.”
He was beginning to think his subconscious was having a midlife crisis instead, and there was nothing else to do but wait it out.
“You’re not calling to cancel, are you? Ginny’s been at it all day in the kitchen, and she’ll be disappointed if you skip out on whatever godforsaken meal she’s tried to cook.”
“It wouldn’t have been right,” Ginny smiles. “You love who you love. Take some comfort in that. And don’t be fucking stubborn, go a few more weeks without seeing him and trust me, you’ll attach yourselves at the hip after that ordeal.”
“I wish that could happen too, Harry. And I know you were mad at Ginny and me for saying this earlier, but it just makes sense. This explains why you were both so obsessed with each other at Hogwarts. I’m not saying that you need to love him, or that you ever will, but you can’t deny there’s always been a strong connection there.”
There are two minutes left until midnight.
Up ahead, a crackle of electricity surged through the streets as a lightning bolt energetically splintered across the sky. Knockturn plunged into blinding darkness, and Draco could barely make out Harry’s figure from up the road. He seemed to be walking without any effect from the weather. As if it were a regular day, and he was completing weekend errands. Draco pulled his robes up higher over his head, taking care to cover his hair.
The only sounds in the room were of skin smacking together and Draco moaning unabashedly into every thrust.
Harry wondered what it would be like if Malfoy actually did bite him. But he banished those thoughts quickly, in fear of letting the words settle onto his features. He scolded himself for letting his mind wander like that.
Theo nods in understanding, and Harry doesn’t miss the flicker of concern crossing silently between the two of them.
“Does what?”
So this was about sex. Harry figured he might as well give it to him; it was his birthday after all.
“Is it supposed to look like that?” Harry asks through gritted teeth. His body feels a bit uneasy, even with just that small portion of his magical core removed.
Harry looked startled too at the show of cheerfulness. His simple, “Morning,” was much more sedate, almost suspicious.
“Well, his home would be a good start.”
“Thanks,” Draco remarks.
“You don’t sound so sure,” Madam Odessa mused, and the corner of her mouth turned up wryly. “Name?”
!” Harry said with increasing fervor. The lock did not budge.
“I should’ve,” Harry muttered under his breath without really meaning it. If Draco had heard, he didn’t bother to reply.
“I’ll just,” Harry motioned toward the door. “I’ll go see what’s wrong.”
“No.” Ron frowned, shuffling his feet awkwardly. “We worked on it together.”
Malfoy responded first, and to this, Harry was perplexed. The Slytherin had avoided him like the Black Plague for the majority of the first few weeks and had neglected to insult him. Harry was becoming worried that his mouth had been cursed shut, or something along those lines. The alternative that Malfoy might not actually care about him anymore was too unbelievable to even consider. Of course, he cared.
Harry grasped it, shaking firmly with an odd smile playing upon his features.
“Technically, you can’t see me.”
“You’re rather impulsive. Like your father.” Snape tacks on, but there was no malice behind his words. It was merely observational.
“Well, you don’t seem like the type to do—” Harry gestures at the powder-covered books between them.
“Yes,” Harry snapped too quickly to conceal the truth. How was that at all relevant?
“So, you and Draco are together?” Harry asks her slowly, feeling inexplicably annoyed, as he tries to connect red strings in his mind.
“So that’s why you’re here,” Harry said absently.
Harry let out a scoff but directed it at the table in front of him, eager to look anywhere but at Malfoy.
Somewhere amidst all the chaos, Harry feels more alone than he has in a while.
“I’ll be in the garden, if you need me then.”
Harry liked the carmine colored sweatshirt on Malfoy, but after a quick incantation, it was transfigured into a darker blue. He thought that looked even nicer.
“I did this,” he says.
“Yeah,” Draco says, accepting the glass of water, gulping it down.
Draco nods, as though it makes perfect sense. “This whole situation is quite off-putting, isn’t it?”
“That’s not how it works,” Draco says, with a miserable sort of smile that makes Harry’s stomach turn.
Harry allowed his careful mask to slip as both terror and relief settled onto his features simultaneously. They’d been working the case for months, and Harry had practically promised her family that he’d follow through. Of course, he’d let them down without even realising it, or bothering to apologise. It was a weight off his chest to know that the killer had come forward, but an even more considerable burden to know that this could be the key to breaking the case.
It was his duty to solve this case for the sake of the Marchand family, but he knew every break in their investigation would lead one step back to him. He wondered how long this could go on for. How long he could continue lying to the people around him and the profession he pledged himself to.
“How is London?” Draco asks.
Hermione groans, putting a hand to her forehead. “Harry that's the same thing. You are going to make your life, and Malfoy’s, hell if you don’t sort this out somehow.”
“Draco —”
The crimson red fabric peeks out from behind a set of unused suit jackets, and Harry is quick to grab for it, sending the contents of half of his wardrobe crashing to the floor. He rummages through the pockets for far too long before locating a small, palm-sized box.
It had been a week since he’d first encountered Draco at his home, and six days since he’d spilled a drink all over him in the Ministry. Harry’s sure their next encounter will also not go so splendidly, but third time’s a charm.
“I’m teasing you, Merlin,” Draco says coyly, making for the door. “But yes, we can be friends.”
Once the joints were rolled, Draco handed Harry one. They put them in between their lips and spoke out
“You look well,” Harry said, surveying him. There wasn’t any malice or possessiveness behind the tone like there used to be. But five years was a long time; even Draco knew that.
“Hello?” The voice at the other end was staticky and unclear. Holborn never had good service.
“Pansy,” Theo warns.
“I believe so,” Draco replies, grinning.
“Are you alright?” Harry asks slowly, knowing that, although the question seems well-placed, there’s nothing concrete telling him that Draco isn’t.
Harry isn’t sure how he hadn’t noticed it before, but Draco is so skinny. Too skinny. He’s about to mention it, though he holds his tongue. It’s probably not the politest thing to communicate to the host of a party.
Ordinarily, he could keep his cool during arguments. Still, with the impending and catastrophic horror of his subconscious looming over his shoulder, it was harder to hold himself together enough to give a good fight back.
“Potter,” Draco says slowly, drooping eyes drawing themselves up Harry’s body to meet his own.
Ron let out a low chuckle once Hermione had safely exited the room. “She’s something else.”
“People need someone to blame, and I’m not a terrible choice,” Draco concedes.
Ron nodded knowingly at that statement; they had heard it far too many times in their line of work. He led Harry to the scene where the brick pavement was stained an unpleasant crimson. He supposed they should probably clean it soon; flashes of light from passersby indicated that many were taking photos.
Draco’s breathing is growing heavier as his anxiety increases. His nails dig crescent-shaped indents into the skin of Harry’s palms.
They ate largely in silence, and distinct guilt bubbled around the edges of Harry’s stomach. He ached to take the tea back, to somehow acquire a Time-Turner and never visit the apothecary in the first place, despite knowing that meant losing his husband forever. But this wasn’t right at all.
“What are you on about?” Harry asks.
“Didn’t you already write him a prescription?”
Draco’s stomach turned because the statement was true. Among the warm faces and familiar conversation at the pubs of Diagon Alley, an encounter like this would hardly have broken out in the first place. Here, they had been the ones to trespass upon Carrow’s hunting ground. And by the way other people had dutifully turned their backs on the display, it was clear that he sustained the upper hand. If Carrow took Draco now, if he did brutal things to him, he’d get away with it.
“Too often,” Theo grumbles. “It’s like she and Draco are trying to break some sort of world record for longest sleepover. It’s sickening, if you ask me.”
Harry smiled faintly, burying his initial discomfort, “Guys like me?”
The gash on his cheek is completely gone. Clearly, he’d been taking care of it, and Harry hates that he’s pleasantly surprised by that.
Instead, he hears a door creak. Narcissa Malfoy enters the room and closes the door gently behind her. Harry figures if he’s going to die, if she kills him, he deserves every second of the pain that she will cause.
“I’m not fantastic,” Draco admits, too nervous to quip back at Harry as he usually would.
“Draco, are you alright?” Harry asks.
“The good highs only last for so long,” Draco shrugs. “The bad ones become more frequent visitors.”
He needs to apologise, to make everything okay.
“Fuck no,” Ginny laughs. “I have a date with a glass of wine and Quidditch Weekly tonight. Plus, I have morning practice tomorrow. You’ll have Blaise with you! Come on, Harry. You have to start putting yourself out there a bit more.”
Harry’s terror, his fear was almost paralytic. He dropped his head, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes.
“Draco, ah fuck, I’m gonna–” Harry thrust hard inside of Draco until he finished, coming with a drawn-out moan as a kaleidoscope of sensation exploded from inside him. He felt so unbelievably close to Draco, and something unspoken and ethereal bloomed from within his chest. This was more than just sex.
Once the Healer had dismissed any theories about a hex or physical ailment, the next step was the Janus Thickey Ward, so Draco had just walked out with his back to the door.
“I love you,” Draco said, frowning at his mouth. “I didn’t mean to —”
“There was a time I would’ve done anything for you, Harry. I would’ve flown to the end of the world on a fucking hippogriff if it meant I could see your smile.” Draco pressed a hand to his temples but focused his gaze on the ground, “I don’t feel those things anymore. I don’t know why, but that’s just how it is.”
“If you change your mind just let me know,” she says, and totters off. Draco looks after her retreating back and wonders when libraries have started selling tea. He’s certainly never received such an offer from a librarian before, though he’s spent a lot of time in libraries.
Draco looks down at where Potter’s hand curls around his, hesitant. He remembers the days when he could throw money like this around, like it was nothing. He knows that, for Potter, this is little more than a drop in the bucket. But still, to him it’s not nothing. It’s significant. It’s bloody lifechanging. He’d be a fool to turn it down.
He sighs, resolving to be very careful about hiding his identity on his way over. There is no way that he can afford new gloves this week too. So, he tugs his ratty hood as far down over his face as he can and keeps his head down, watching only his feet as he makes his way up Knockturn.
Draco goes through the familiar motions of wandlessly casting – closing his eyes, focusing, reaching for his magic. But it slips out of his grasp, and the magic fizzles out with his incantation, lost to the cool air of the room. Frowning, he tries a couple more times, but it doesn’t produce even a spark of warmth.
As he’d eaten more yesterday than he has in recent memory (thank you Potter), he decides to skip breakfast today. With no more reason to dawdle, Draco cheerfully lets himself out of his apartment. He’s in high spirits as he makes his way up Knockturn and into Diagon, and he twirls happily in the light snow that’s started up. He’s sure to be attracting some strange looks, acting like an overgrown child as he is, but he can’t bring himself to care. The festive décor festooning Diagon Alley lifts his spirits further, and he takes his time walking along the street, gazing around him and joyfully taking in the holiday spirit on display. By the time he reaches the library, it’s nearing noon.
“I’d like to see you do better!” he calls, making his way over to the git. Potter grins at him in response.
Draco is already fishing his money out of his picket when he registers the price and freezes. Not only is Ugbert not trying to molest him, he’s also charging regular price? He looks up at the other man, jaw slack in surprise.
In the summer, he sometimes uses his limited spare time to get a wank off, but he can never quite manage to get into the mood when it’s so cold. He’d love to though. Merlin knew how long it had been since he’d gotten off. Maybe with a heating charm…
Potter looks at him, determined. “I want to help though,” he says. “Hermione will too. She’s brilliant you know. I’m sure there’s something she can do.”
Draco looks around at the many boxes they could jump to, and his eyes meet with a young woman who’s holding her small box up with the non-glowing side facing him, right as he hears the familiar sound of a camera shutter. Ah, so the small boxes are cameras. Strangely shaped, though.
The library is only just opening when he arrives and the librarian seems surprised to see him, but smiles and greets him warmly anyway. “My, my, you’re here bright and early,” she says. “Come on in, it’s terribly cold out there.”
It’s so tempting, in the mildly warmed room, to just leave it. Though his better sense tells him otherwise, it’s easy to imagine that this time the warming charm will hold, and he won’t need to go out. But he can’t risk it – Ugbert doesn’t keep late hours, and if this day has been any indication then the night will be frigid. If his warming charm wears off in the middle of the night, he may just freeze to death, or else burn his room down trying to warm it.
way in hell we’ll ever allow —”
Harry feels like he’s walked into some sort of alternate universe where, suddenly, Slytherins and Gryffindors actually can get along. He’d known, albeit bitterly, that it was possible for a while, Blaise and Ginny’s picture-perfect relationship being the perfect example of such, but he often finds himself hard-pressed to let go of the past and is surprised that his fellow schoolmates are not.
“Nothing.”
,” Draco repeats through gritted teeth. He looks feverish, a pile of limbs on the bathroom floor. Harry very much dislikes the sight of it all.
After he had left, Draco optimistically crushed some of the thistle leaves together to create a sap-like substance, a thick milky white paste. He’d stirred it into his fourth cup of tea of the day and hoped for the best.
“Is everything alright?” Hermione whispers.
Draco smirks. “See? I know you.”
“It’s more likely that he’d kill me, you know?” Harry calls after Pansy. She has already hoisted Theo up into her arms and is walking him slowly from the bedroom.
“Yes, I’m aware of that fact already.” Draco pressed a finger to the space between his eyebrows. “Just tell me you’ll be there?”
Someone is home.
Neville had been unusually interested in flowering medicinal plants as of late and, as a result, had chatted Draco’s ear off about it at Ginny and Pansy’s most recent get-together.
“Professor McGonagall, I hardly think this is the right... position for me. My knowledge in this area is limited at best. I feel as though my strengths could be utilized in a different field. Perhaps as a teaching assistant in potions, I heard Professor Slughorn was –”
Blaise pops his head in curiously through the open door.
“Well, how do you know?” Harry had demanded, feeling his grip on his anger slip down.
It was easy to forget the things he’d done to Draco now that he’d been doing them for months. He found it became more natural to deal with the guilt, the pain, if only in the short term.
“It probably does, but you’re meant to be a part of this person’s life. It can be scary, but it can also be deeply fulfilling.”
“So, her state of mind was different in the most recent weeks, then?” Harry said, directing his question at Capucine.
Malfoy lies underneath him; his dress shirt bares no ounce of white anymore. It’s a deep and violent red that makes Harry’s face turn green. This is not happening, he firmly tells himself, but it really is. He rips the boy’s shirt open, exposing Malfoy’s naked chest. Harry delivers healing spells at the wounds and feels a glimmer of hope as they disappear. But the confidence is shattered when deeper gashes replace the one’s that Harry has taken away. Malfoy only cries harder.
Harry browsed the shelves for Dreamless Sleep. While it wasn’t an illegal substance yet, it was heavily controlled by the Ministry, and Knockturn Alley’s nameless apothecaries were some of the last places that carried potions of such caliber. Harry always found himself wanting to buy other, likely illegal, draughts from the store, just to see what they would do to him, but he always talked himself out of it, losing his nerve.
“Draco?” Harry calls out.
“Oh, Draco —” Harry startled, turning abruptly, but he welcomed Draco into his arms easily.
A waitress looked down at him from a pair of obscenely high heels. She smelled distinctly of alcohol and other people.
“I think I’m ready to find out now,” Harry says.
“We can talk about that later. Just you and me.” She winked, and Harry smiled a genuine one that exposed the crow’s feet of his eyes.
Life became increasingly volatile for Harry, and he was nothing short of terrified to go home every day. A new horror, argument, or terror awaited him each evening. Something about the way the potion rendered Draco so pliant and malleable excited Harry in a way that he would never have imagined.
“Quite a lot,” Draco supplies.
In the years after the war, and in an effort to boost rapidly declining birth rates, it wasn’t unusual that the Ministry had made an effort in reviving the soulmates program. When Harry had first heard about it, he had been skeptical that such a thing could even exist, likening it to a Muggle matchmaking service. Ron, surprisingly enough, had quickly shut down such an idea.
Harry doesn’t know much about vine wood, though he remembers reading something in the Department of Mysteries about the types of people that possessed these wands. The Druids believed that only those with a larger purpose, a hidden depth were capable of using such an instrument.
When he was unwilling to spend the night making excuses to his friends, Harry went to Hermione and Ron’s to see Rose and Hugo and show his face for a few hours. But Draco was always “too sick” to join.
There was silence in the room as he awaited Draco’s statement.
This seemed like a very Dumbledore thing to do, after all. It wasn’t enough that Harry had been tasked with defeating the darkest wizard of all time, but as a reward for such a feat, he was assigned more work. McGonagall peered down at the two boys in front of her with, what one would call, a sort of humorous expression coloring her sharp features. It seemed a little unnatural to see her face communicate anything more than truly neutral or hopelessly agitated, Harry thought. A small part of Harry expected she would allow him, and his fellow eighth years, to continue their year in peace. But here she was defying his expectations once more.
“So,” Ginny said into the silence, her features tight as though she held something back.
.” There was the sound of something paper-thin hitting the floor. “And I am his family. I don’t have the time for this right now. I —”
“‘Practically’ isn’t good enough,” Draco says, as though those words had been repeated to him, drilled into his subconscious, on a number of occasions. Harry’s almost positive they have been.
Harry allowed a low chuckle, but Draco’s mouth hardened into a thin line. He took a long sip of tea, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat. Despite channelling nonchalance, he found his eyes unable to pull away, especially when Draco set the cup down and smacked his lips uncertainly.
When Head Auror Robards entered the room, everyone fell silent. He wasn’t an intimidating man, but he was by far one of the best Aurors Harry had ever worked with in his life. He commanded impressive respect over his subordinates, and rightfully so. Even Seamus, who always hunched over like some sort of wild animal, straightened his back and sat tall against the chair. Harry did the same.
“I never
Harry gaped at the Professor in front of him, fighting back the urge to say the first thing that came to mind. This was naturally how Hermione would be deeply upset that she had not been included in this venture. Harry pictured she would sprint to McGonagall the second he told her and beg to replace Malfoy entirely, citing her in-depth experience with the Muggle world. In a different year at Hogwarts, Harry posited that her pleas might resonate, and she would be allowed to help him out. But after the mere entertainment coupled with anxiety-inducing intensity on McGonagall’s face, it was evident that her words would fall upon deaf ears. McGonagall had made her decision.
“You might as well quit at this point. You’re never well enough anyway.” Harry laughed cruelly, and Draco suppressed a flinch, only at the mercy of his pride.
“And otherwise?”
He remembered the love in their garden. The way Draco’s gelled hair used to curl in the humidity of countryside summers. How little mites used to peck at their ankles until they were raw and itchy. Harry would pick at the scabs until they were red, even when Draco would bat his hands away and smooth aloe over his aching legs with the most delicate of fingers. Harry loved those moments, when he and Draco spread out a blanket in the grass and rested after a day of giving life to the plants around him.
“Draco?” Harry rasped, pushing hair out of his face and feeling his forehead. “
Ethel brings two cups of tea back to the desk, setting one in front of Harry. He thanks her and takes a tentative sip, burning his tongue immediately on the hot liquid. He’s never been one for patience.
Locke had the decency to look startled for a moment, likely surprised by the Golden Boy’s outburst. He probably never expected Harry to put up much of a fight.
“I’m a mess.”
“Just give it a chance, Draco,” Harry said and liked the way the name felt against lips. He paused when the blonde looked up, surprised.
“All this love. Easy acceptance.”
Harry’s too surprised at the name to react well, but he offers an obedient nod. His eyes are still heavy with sleep, and his vision blurs as he attempts to adjust to the harsh overhead lighting.
Draco stands, dusting off his trousers and holding a hand out for Harry.
“I guess it’s both,” Harry says, his voice weak. “Either way, is it possible to speak to him today? I’m sorry for showing up out of the blue, I probably should’ve sent an owl but I figured—”
A quick Patronus to Ginny confirmed his presence at dinner that evening. She and Pansy barely had any free time with the baby, and apparently, Molly had insisted her youngest grandchild stay for the evening. Nobody was going to argue with her.
He understood more than anyone the loneliness that came when choice was abundant. It was more suffocating than one might expect.
“Erm, Ginny Weasley,” Harry said.
He didn’t bother to shower, or brush his teeth, or comb his hair. He realizes he hasn't done anything hygienic in the days that passed, but time was blurring together almost comfortingly. It felt consoling to know that the world went on without him.
They exited the DMLE, taking the lift down to the Ministry’s cellars, where criminals were temporarily housed before their court hearings or interrogations.
She came to meet him with a copying quill and parchment hovering beside her and a few familiar-faced trainees in tow.
“Theo, we need to get him to St Mungo’s or call a Healer,” someone says from inside, their voice strained.
,” Harry says rather quickly. “We’re having a hard enough time saying one civil thing to each other already.”
“Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says, untangling his arm from Ginny and walking over to meet her.
“Listen,” Harry says. “I know we’re not friends, or you won’t consider us to be, but I’d like to see you more.”
“What the fuck,” he said aloud, wonder and terror clouding the thoughts in his head. “What do I do?”
This isn’t right, Harry thinks.
“Go where?’
“Even if I said yes,” Harry chuckled, bitter and impassive, “you’d want it from me.”
“I know, but I’ve closed some massive cases this year. I could afford a break,” he grumbled, and Harry held back the urge to say something rude.
Most of the front garden had withered away after Harry had ripped out the blooming milk thistles from their root. But Harry worked at the one in the back tirelessly, still, for the sake of appearances. People usually never came through the front door anymore. No one really came at all, but when they did, Harry encouraged the use of the Floo. Somehow, it felt more controlled than any stranger entering through their front door.
a phenomenal cook.”
Hermione wrapped her arms around Ron’s waist, pulling him closer as though she was afraid he would slip away. Ginny and Pansy corralled Draco back into bed with only a few weak objections, and had taken seats on either side of him. Mrs Weasley was at the head, her hands pressed into white fists at her side.
. The words wouldn’t come out, and he began to panic.
“I’m not
Harry had a different opinion, but as he was about to voice it, their food arrived. Somehow, he felt as though it was a sign to just move on – something he had never excelled at. Draco requested another bottle of wine when they had finished their first one. Harry could feel a pleasant buzz in the back of his head that vibrated through his arms and out to the tips of his fingers. He could tell Draco was feeling it too, as both their eyes were going a little wide, and Draco was most certainly slack-jawed.
“Mr Marchand,” Harry amended, and Capucine looked at him with silent thanks in her expression. “I have a few questions if you don’t mind. I understand you must want to be home, but it would be really helpful if I could learn a bit more about Pauline.”
“We’re all doing the best we can,” she says earnestly.
, it must have been expensive.”
“Will you make something for dinner? I’m a bit tired tonight,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice even and pleasant enough.
“There’s nothing to talk about.”
Harry pulls down Draco’s pants, slowly, and with a deliberateness he’s never done before during sex. He’s looking forward to watching Draco come apart underneath his mouth. His cock springs out from behind the fabric, and Harry, without warning, swallows him to the base, nose poking into the small hairs of Draco’s stomach. He presses his hands into his hips, wrapping fingers around his narrow waist, licking up the shaft and sinking back down as Draco litters the air around them with encouraging swears and groans. Draco’s hand knots into his hair, pushing him down rougher and faster, until Harry’s gasping, choking closed-mouthed around him.
“We need to talk about this,” she says after a few moments of silence.
Harry doesn’t hesitate a second longer. He collects Draco’s limp body in his arms, without question from Pansy or Theo, and the four of them creep steadily down the staircase. Harry finds himself horrified at how easy it is to manoeuvre around despite the dead weight.
“I feel dreadful,” he mumbled.
“Tell me something I don’t know about you,” Harry said unexpectedly, nursing yet another glass of sweet liquor. His eyes were misty, and he enjoyed the warmth of the room edging upon him.
“Er, I don’t know.” Harry shrugged. “Last night, I kind of just ran away after everything. I didn’t really mean to, I just got overwhelmed and thought I could figure it all out later.”
Harry pauses at the gesture, as though there’s something more sinister behind it.
“Er-I mean, I didn’t exactly–”
Ethel frowns for a moment before schooling her expression back into professionalism. Still, she hesitates for a moment too long, and Harry takes notice. “All wizards have unique cores,” she says, but doesn’t offer more than that.
The portrait looks at him, confused, but smirks back, “We’re not in another life, though, are we?”
“Do you like it here?” Harry queries instead.
that accomplished decidedly little to the rain-heavy fabric.
, Merlin!”
Draco scoffs, a rough sound that makes Harry’s heart ache. “Please, Harry. Don’t patronise me.”
“Can I ask you something?” Draco began, surprised at his own initiative. They rounded the corner and entered a hallway, cluttered with recovering patients and their overseers.
He’d been Crucio-ed many times, but in many ways this was far worse.
The seminar had taught him that the next thing to do was rescue breathing. Harry acts without thinking, removing the empty syringe from Draco’s leg. He pumps at Draco’s chest with his hands, breathing as much life as he can back into his open mouth at intervals.
There was something unsure in Draco’s eyes, but he fucked him through it anyway, where earlier he might’ve stopped to ask if something was wrong, if he could do something differently. Draco didn’t say anything either, and Harry assumed it was fine. He was too lost in sensation to care.
Harry had a bit of practice with this sort of thing, though. In the early days, Draco could weasel anything out of him, whether it be a guilty pleasure, gossip from one of their friends, or maybe even a secret purchase. That wasn’t necessarily the case anymore, and the lack of trust between them was an influential factor in that.
It only served to convince Draco more that this was truly himself. It was his subconscious emerging to tell him something he already knew but had buried so deep.
“Will you trust me for once?” Draco says impatiently, reaching for a silver box on his nightstand. It opens with an inviting click.
“Good,” he grunted. “Thought you might both be here. There’s been an incident.”
“I know,” Draco breathes. His words are so soft, but Harry hangs on to every sound. “I need to get it cut. Pansy has been mentioning it.”
“Metal detectors,” he stated as if that explained everything.
Harry would take what he could get at this point.
Harry cast a quick preservation charm over the cake to keep it as fresh as possible before deciding it was time to tackle the garden.
“Oh,” the visitor breathed out, and Draco knew he’d been compromised.
“Listen,” Harry said, choosing to ignore Ron’s comment. “I’m seeing Pansy today for lunch, so go on without me.”
Bookshelves climb high like ivy across the walls, a rosewood desk placed in the middle of the room sits atop a faded, ornate rug. There’s a delicate, wilted rose, floating inside of a bell jar just on the surface.
“How do you know?” Harry asked gruffly, hoping his steely tone wouldn’t betray pure and absolute terror. Locke had more power over him than anyone else in the wizarding world at this very moment, and Harry wanted to rip it from his filthy grasp.
Harry leaned into his height, looking tall and fierce even next to Carrow, who towered over him.
“You couldn’t have known,” Draco says carefully, his hand curling into a tight fist at his side. Harry watches as he digs his fingernails into the skin of his palm.
“I should be in Azkaban.” He says forcefully, and with cold resolve. “I deserve to be there for my entire life.”
Harry didn’t know what to make of that, but the moment seemed surprisingly intimate. They sat unbearably close together, and his heartbeat sped up for no apparent reason. He wondered how Malfoy’s presence could have such a mere physical effect on him, especially since they weren’t arguing as usual – which was what usually set him off. The moment was lost straight away when Malfoy stood from his seat and walked swiftly to the next room.
“In the manor,” Harry says. “You recognised me, I know you did. I saw it in your eyes.”
“I don’t think so,” Draco muses. “But this is nice.”
“Drugs?” Harry laughs.
Harry creases his brow. “And how’s that?”
“Harry, I have a bad headache. I’m sorry,” he found himself saying, and his words were soft and light. There was a touch of sweetness in his tone that he hadn’t intended to let on. But Harry seemed pleased, and like he wasn’t about to ask another question, so Draco considered it a job well done.
“I’m not sure, either.” Draco sighed, pressing a hand to throbbing temples. He felt around for any ghost of pain leftover from the routine headaches, but couldn’t find much there. Flinching at the thought, he pulled his fingers away. “I don’t know what to do.”
“You can sit down. I won’t bite.” His words were cutting and direct, but Draco projected calm, almost relaxed.
controlled by the potion, of course. Strong wills and desires can overcome its effects. The person who takes it becomes more suggestible. Say, open-minded. Easier to deal with. However you want to put it.”
Draco scoffs. “You might feel like it, but I can guarantee you that whatever Seamus put in that punch will have you loopy all evening.”
“How did you feel when you first found out?” Draco asks, his gaze unfocused and distant. He has a hard time grounding himself in reality as of late.
Draco wakes up with the dream replaying vividly in his mind. He lies there for a moment, imagining that it were real. Anonymity – his subconscious was not far off base on that one. What he wouldn’t give for that.
Potter laughs. “Of course,” he replies, as though it’s inconceivable that he won’t want to carry a grown man all the way to wherever they are going. Potter carries him as though he weighs nothing, though, and so Draco tips his head forward to rest it against Potter’s collarbone to hide the heat on his face.
Happy New Year!
“It was a family tradition,” he offers. “On Christmas we – it was always a big deal at home. We’d throw grand parties, every year. I’m not actually certain that my parents liked all of their guests.” He shakes his head. “I think they were just people invited for…work.” Merlin, he’d almost mentioned the Death Eaters. Why is he telling Potter this?
People come and go from the library, but nobody pays him any mind and nor does he pay them any. Despite the steady traffic, the library is quiet, and Draco is well able to ignore them all and descend into his study.
“I’ll kill you,” Potter groans, dropping his head forward. Then he almost stumbles, and clings to Draco with fresh vigour.

“You and Granger,” he clarifies. “She was in the magical law section yesterday. I know that the house-elf bill is passed. What is it now?”
He guides them out of the library and into Diagon, where the freezing air finally wakes Draco the rest of the way. Merlin, he’s so mortified. He’s never going to fall asleep in public again.
Potter comes up to him, frowning, and takes his hand. “Look Emory. It’s really no more than I do for any of my other friends. Please, it’s not a big deal.”
He makes it back to work with no incident, and drinks just a single sip of the potion – enough to heal his scraped palms. He looks at the expensive and mostly full bottle dejectedly. What a waste of money. He tries to look at the bright side – at the very least he will have a stock of healing potion at home now – but it doesn’t make him feel much better.
Forsythe whips around. “No, you won’t,” he snaps. Draco stiffens, half expecting a reprimand, but Forsythe just says “I’ve got an appointment to make. You’ll have to close up front too.” He starts to leave, then pauses and turns to glare at Draco. “Don’t mess anything up or it’s coming out of your salary.” He barks, and then he’s gone.
Draco laughs disbelievingly. “You are serious?” He asks when Potter doesn’t laugh along with him. Potter nods, and Draco boggles. “Well, you’ve sounded very confident,” he says.
Potter blinks at him. “Are you serious?” He says.
Draco laughs. “What in the name of sorcery is her objection to Sicilian Silk Bats?” He asks.
He must not hide his shivering very well, though, because Potter after a little while Potter turns to him. “Okay, you’re clearly cold,” he says, his dark brows furrowing with concern.
There’s no reason to dawdle around his apartment so he doesn’t – he slips into the empty hallway and then down the stairs and out to the street. It’s a cold but quick trek up Knockturn and then onto Diagon where the harsh weather prevents him from spending too much time admiring the splendor.
“They’re – ah – something sweet,” he explains haltingly, scratching at the back of his head. Merlin, no wonder his hair was a mess. Still, it’s an exceedingly decent thing of Potter to do, and certainly not anything he’s used to.
Draco flushes. No way is Potter seeing his hovel. “We can meet here,” he replies. Potter wilts a little but smiles anyway.
Potter, thankfully, takes that moment to return. He’s laden with two enormous mugs of the most ridiculous hot chocolate, topped with whipped cream and crushed candy canes and chocolate chips and syrup, as well as a plate of biscuits. “Sorry I took so long,” he says, setting one of the drinks down in front of Draco.
He finds that it’s warmed up somewhat when he steps outside, so he takes his time walking back to his apartment, enjoying the fresh crisp air. He takes a little too long, though, because by the time he gets to his apartment Mrs. Doxley, his next-door, has also arrived home and is standing in her doorway arguing with her husband as she does every day.
Draco blinks, surprised by the change in their daily routine of one-to-two word greetings, but returns her smile. “Thank you,” he says gratefully, stepping into the warm building.
They go to the coffee shop from the other day, and Potter pulls open the door for Draco once more. He thanks him, smiling to himself as he walks in. Potter follows him in and sends Draco to get a seat again – even though the café is still empty – while he goes up to the front counter.
Head spinning in confusion, Draco quickly retreats back down Knockturn to the relative safety of his chilly apartment. He sits heavily on his rickety old bed and fishes out the contents of his pockets, staring in disbelief at the handful of coins in his hand. What had just happened there? He’d assumed Ugbert was just messing with him – the man has to have recognized him, surely he wouldn’t talk to any old customer off the street like that – but even when he’d gone out without his hood on, none of the people walking by had recognized him.
He cuts himself off with a shake of his head. “I’ve become carried away. Forgive me Potter. I simply meant to say that even if there are no laws making Squibs lives harder, that doesn’t mean that they’re treated well by society. It’s the same for vampires.”
Still pink-cheeked, Draco rolls his eyes fondly. “I may as well, seeing as you’ve gone to all this trouble,” he says. He stands from the bench and holds up the new coat. It’s certainly not large enough to go over his current coat so, with some regret, he slips off his own raggedy little garment and folds it neatly. He has no love for the coat, nor is he cold thanks to Potter’s warming charm, but he feels somehow more vulnerable in front of Potter with his overlarge shirt that he knows makes him look smaller by comparison.
,” he says. He pokes at Potter’s chest, and yeah, it’s just as solid as it looks. Draco is reminded sharply of just how long it’s been since he’s been with someone, and his face flames. He rapidly backpedals and turns away to march ahead down the street. Out of the corner of his eye, he catches an infuriatingly smug grin on Potter’s face.
Where has that come from? He shakes away the thought with a frown. It must be because they’ve been spending so much time together, he reasons. It’s only natural that he think of Potter’s company when he wants to share something. He absolutely refuses to believe that he’s getting attached to the charming git.
He steels himself before the door for a moment, replaying the hypothetical conversation he had with the mirror that morning. When Draco opens the door, he’s just going to be upfront. He’s going to tell him what’s going on and everything will be fine and will eventually go back to normal. Harry reaches up, pulling woolen mittens off to raise the snake-coiled knocker against the door. It makes a loud ringing noise as it collides with the wood and is much louder than Harry would’ve expected. Waiting for a while longer, he resists the urge to do it again and is sure someone inside must have heard by now.
“Nothing’s different.”
“No,” Harry says. “Wasn’t the right environment.”
“But look where we are now. Everything is just fine. We don’t need to dredge up the past, and you don’t need to come out and mope on the stairs every evening before you can bear to enter our house again. You can talk to me next time.”
As soon as the words were out, Draco let his hand cover his mouth gently. His eyes widened almost comically, and Harry would have laughed if Draco didn’t look so guilty for voicing his thought. He wanted to reach out and push away a strand of Draco’s hair that had fallen loosely in front of his face. Before Harry knew it, his hand was moving in front of him as if it were being controlled by someone else. His fingers brushed gently against Draco’s sharp cheekbone, and the boy flinched at the touch but leaned into it afterward. Harry’s heart was in this throat, threatening to empty out onto the table. He wet his lips just slightly, and knew exactly what he wanted to do next. A familiar little tug made its presence known in his lower belly. Draco wasn’t moving him away either, his sharp eyes staring so intensely into Harry’s own that he was surprised they weren’t watering.
“Winter flu, probably. Wouldn’t want to pass it around during the holidays,” Harry says seriously, putting on a grave face.
Harry takes a seat on the side of one, while Narcissa elects the armchair nearby.
Everything was still there. Fresh and raw between them like it had just happened yesterday.
“Oh, fuck,” Draco groaned, throwing one free hand over his forehead, and the other curled tightly into Harry’s tangle of dark hair. “Yes, oh, Merlin.”
have your wedding on a rainy day,” George calls out, and the guests erupt into laughter.
,” Draco repeats slowly, as though he doesn’t know who Harry is talking about. Memory loss is a common aspect of drug abuse, and definitely an overdose, but somehow being presented with it makes Harry feel even worse.
“He told me not to tell anyone but I—” Harry pauses, his throat tightening. “I just don’t know what to do anymore.”
“Fuck,” Harry found himself saying aloud because he knew what he was about to do, and it involved a whole deal of embarrassment and probably a Prophet article. He’d always been told he was impulsive.
Harry had been taking Dreamless Sleep for a while. He was certainly not addicted and could probably stop if he ever chose to, but it was easier to fall asleep next to Draco when there was something actively forcing his body to do so.
“Sometimes, I just...” Harry paused, debating how to word his thoughts without sounding like an idiot. “I just wonder if you wish I had done more for your family than I did.”
always annoyed with each other,” Theo says as he pulls Pansy into a one-armed embrace. “How’s Draco?”
“You’re here.”
He stumbles forward toward the door before realising it, knocking fists into the wood as though his life depends on it. If the gate hadn’t locked securely behind him, Harry fears it would.
Harry’s egg is just starting to brown when Draco pulls him into his arms. He’s taller and longer than Harry is, but much smaller, somehow. He still has so much weight to gain back but seeing colour in his face for the first time since they’ve met is enough for Harry to feel a bit better about the whole affair.
They both dozed off on the couch, and Harry eventually woke. The television was still on, murmuring a scene from another romance film. Moonlight shone brightly through the living room window as if it were lit up entirely by itself. The night didn’t seem as cold as it did before. Harry gently lifted Draco from where he was curled into the corner of the couch and wrapped his arms sturdily around him.
It was actually quite easy.
,” Harry said, and a few shovels and shears came flying out from underneath various plant boxes. One particular trowel smacked sharply at Draco’s shoulder before settling into Harry’s palm.
“I’m barely wearing any clothing.” Draco frowned, surveying his magical non-slip socks and patient gown. “You want me to walk around like this?”
He pays a hefty sum for both the books and goes to meet Draco by the doorway. As he goes to put the book back where he found it, Harry stops him, his hands wrapping gently around Draco’s forearm.
He reminded himself of that as he began to explain his situation.
Harry suddenly felt awkward. Like he'd had a particularly rough one-night stand. Like he didn't know the man in his bed all that well at all. Draco removed himself from the sheets before coming to stand in front of Harry.
“It’ll be Ron,” Hermione says, the corner of her mouth twitching up into a smile. There’s no reason why Hermione needs to get her core checked, but with work she’d been quite busy and hadn’t been able to. Ron had already had his consult, and it, of course, matched with Hermione. But she’d put it off for whatever reason—likely because Ron already knew, and it would be rare that she wouldn’t register as his pair.
“He told me he’d be home at seven,” Ginny said, but failed to notice that Harry’s face fell.
“That’s all that matters in the end,” Harry says.
“How are you Seamus?” Harry asks, if only to break the awkward pause.
The door opens slowly, and a pair of sharp eyes peek out, just as Harry’s vision goes dark.
Trousers and pants first, because they were easier. Still, purple spots dotted down each leg and mingled with the yellow stain of bruises from the days before. There were scratches, too, in various states of healing. Ones that had drawn blood and ones that had merely scraped off the topmost layer of skin. Some were scabbed over, but once they fell off, light spots were uncovered underneath to remind Draco of what had been done to him. What he’d let Harry do to him.
“I guess I’m just not grasping how serious this all is,” Harry says quietly, in a moment of honesty. “It’s ridiculous to think that time away from him will literally kill me. That seems dramatic.”
Aurors get to take part,” Seamus said gleefully.
“You know.” Draco removes his wand from his pocket, Harry can feel the magic. “Franklin is fantastic, and if you’d used him, we wouldn’t be here today. Take these off.”
Harry was hysterical, feeling his voice go high and crazed. Draco eyed him uncomfortably and then the door, as if he were planning a quick escape.
“Please, call me Harry.”
“You saw?” she says, frustrated.
“You went out,” he stated, and the tone was a little more accusing than Draco would’ve liked.
“I was so obsessed with you at Hogwarts,” Harry admits. “I was surprised that all that had
The literary district was home to a surprising number of witches and wizards that lived amongst Muggles. A few restaurants and shops were disillusioned between buildings or in back alleys, but for the most part, the people of this neighbourhood lived integrally. They shopped for groceries as Muggles would, used cell phones rather than owls because it was inconspicuous, and dated Muggles too.
“Theo, he,” Draco pauses, clearing his throat before going on. “He didn’t have to, but he practically served my house arrest with me. I know it was only a year, and honestly, I deserved a far worse sentence, but he stayed the whole time. People have forgiven us now, mostly because they’ll do anything for free booze and parties, but it wasn’t so easy in the beginning, winning everyone over. We had to find ways to cope.”
“I guess I could have. But this seems more like it’s for Malfoy’s benefit than it is for mine. Probably something about house unity and all that.” He waved a hand around lazily.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione exhaled. “What Ron is trying to say is that we know you and Malfoy are involved.”
Harry wailed, a wolfish howl of a cry, against Draco’s body. He moved him up into his lap, despite his limp figure lolling about like a ragdoll. His eyes were hazy and glazed over like they’d never blink again. Draco had such dancers' feet, bony and knuckled and a little blue, splayed out on either side of the mattress.
“Oh,” she whispers, to Harry. “It’s good that she’s here.”
“Yesterday you wanted to divorce me,” Harry said, as though he had no idea what caused Draco’s change of heart.
Someone turns on the wireless, and Christmas music cheers up the sitting room.
“This isn’t funny,” Harry huffed, tapping his toes impatiently.
“Harry, we love you, but you can be so absolutely dense sometimes,” Hermione said, but her tone was affectionate.
Harry hadn’t undressed him, and a wave of relief made its way through Draco’s system.
“So are you.” Draco leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, a decidedly uncharacteristic gesture for him. In moments like that, Harry noticed how much the new Draco was not the one he had married. It shocked him out of temporary peace, almost like being plunged directly into icy cold water.
“Now, Ginny, don’t start this already!” Pansy began, flashing her eyes warningly. “We’ve only just arrived.”
“And you didn’t notice this earlier?” Draco said, his tone dripping with condescension. Sometimes old habits die hard, and it was challenging not to pick a fight first thing at the breakfast table.
Thirty minutes later, and after a few more shares from the group, Draco speaks.
Hermione wanted me to come over here and see if you were okay, if something was going on between the two of you.”
He’s gone in, and instantly Harry is alone by the water. It is only a second before heaving sobs rip through his body. He sits again, with his head between his legs, and cries indelibly at the ground. When his tears dry out, and his eyes are sore, he’s on all fours dry heaving. He can tell there is not much in his body to throw up beside the potions administered at St. Mungo’s. Those are out of his digestive system in an instant. He lays like that for endless hours, covered in his own sick staring at the burning bright sky. The grief is washed away by a perpetual numbness, that almost feels even more restricting and inescapable. At least before, he was feeling something, feeling human. Now, he perceived as though he could do absolutely anything, and it wouldn’t matter. He seriously considers letting himself just drown in the lake, savoring the feeling of water in his lungs, but staves off the idea. He cannot picture being able to stand up for a while. Eventually, the sky fades down to a gentle orange, and then to black. He manages a few hours of sleep before he is being shaken lightly.
Draco bites his lip, but he nods in agreement; if anything, it's to convince himself.
“You should put some apples in. The trees are doing well this year.” Draco kissed at the skin of his neck and up to Harry’s earlobe, which he bit lightly.
“Too often?” Harry asks.
“You’re a bad liar for a Slytherin,” Harry said, and there was something eerie and sinister in his tone that Draco took an immediate dislike to.
“Malfoy I –”
“Like hell you did,” Harry growled, turning Draco on his stomach and spreading his cheeks apart.
But Harry will, and always will be, just another reminder of the war. The singular person who symbolises the atrocities they all lived through, even if he was just a kid, too. Nobody wants that kind of buzzkill at a party.
“Your friends don’t call you Draco?” Harry wondered, confusion creasing lines into his forehead.
“You don’t always have to be the saviour,” Draco says under his breath, but the harsh words echo unpleasantly through the small bathroom.
. There was nothing wrong with that at all if his husband was still making his own decisions.
“Like heaven?” Draco fills in.
“I’ve had better days,” Draco admits.
Instead, this year, Harry had planned a surprise birthday that no one really wanted to attend. Of course, none of his friends would ever say that to his face. But it was clear something was going horribly wrong in their household, and not even Ron or Hermione wanted to get caught in the middle of it.
“Draco?” Harry asks gently, putting a hand on the bare skin of his back. “What’s wrong?”
Draco looked pained. “Don’t patronise me,” he said, the look he shot Harry full of venom. “I’d like to see my friends, and honestly at this point, I’m not sure why I’m asking for permission.”
Draco woke earlier than Harry and was immediately surprised at his location. He’d been tucked gently into the covers, and when he peered down at himself, he was even more startled to find himself clothed in last evening’s attire.
“Er, okay. Is it bad?”
“Come on,” Harry chides, “you know what I mean.”
“It looks nice,” Harry offers in lieu of an uneasy silence.
Harry nods. “I understand.”
“You can be such an arsehole,” Harry frowns.
She says it like they don’t work together and talk almost every single day. Harry can tell she’s drunk by the way the words come out of her mouth all slurred and meshed together. He offers a sheepish smile and a one-armed hug before grabbing for Seamus, who leads him into the kitchen.
Something about the potion made them both so achingly passionate, so volatile.
“Holy shit,” Harry says, quietly.
“Figures,” Ollie says, thoughtfully. “You’re too nice, in all of his stories.”
“What happened, Harry? ” Hermione crossed her arms, uninterested in her food once more.
It was likely that whoever dosed Pauline suggested that she avoid her sister. Harry didn’t yet know what would happen if a victim was given a direct demand and then attempted to defy it.
“At what?”
Clove tipped her head. “Well, that’s my cue. I’m sorry you feel like that, Draco. I’m hopeful that you will remember.”
“Wow,” is all Ron can say, leaning back into his chair and exhaling through his teeth.
“I can’t.” Harry shakes his head. “He won’t react well, I can’t just drop a bomb like this on him. He'll be angry that I've been keeping it from him this whole time.”
“I know,” he repeats, his breath faltering as Harry presses down, leaning forward into the heat between Draco’s legs.
“What do you want from me?” Harry asked, feeling his patience wearing frighteningly thin.
The potion itself seemed to have been potent enough to last all day, but Harry wondered when it would need to be administered again.
Draco only shrugs. “Theo and Pansy usually invite people, and I stay upstairs when I can. I’ve never had much of a hand in planning these things, though even if I did, I can’t say I would’ve invited you. I don’t think you would, if you threw a party.”
“My name’s Harry,” He introduces himself stiffly to the portrait. “Er - you don’t know me.”
