“Block the floo, for Merlin’s sake. I don’t want a Weasley squad in here trying to murder me for corrupting their future son-in-law.” the Slytherin rolled his eyes.
Draco felt a jolt of a stinging hex run through his body and shuddered, groaning and cursing loudly. He blinked a couple of times, trying to remember where he had fallen asleep. The place was dimly lit and slightly smelled of mildew and muggle hairspray. He felt a metal spring of a shabby sofa digging into his side and tried to sit up, rubbed his eyes absentmindedly, and squinted at annoyed Blaise Zabini.
“Where do you think you’re going, Potter?” Draco was looking at him, standing just outside the master chamber.
“Well, she could fuck people’s minds up pretty well… I reckon she was useful,” the ginger concluded taking a magical picture of an Auror squad, all matching crimson robes and serious expressions on their faces.
“Ron… I’ve left her not because of Draco,” Harry replied, “I was confused… about a lot of things and me and Ginny… I thought it would keep me away from those unclear feelings, but the more I tried being with her… the more it was all going to shit.”
Harry had never seen Malfoys behave like that, they usually looked completely composed and proper and devout of emotions.
The title screamed at him from every Daily Prophet. Harry walked tiredly to the Great Hall that morning, followed by the familiar whispering of students. He sat next to Ron and Hermione who defiantly refused to read whatever rubbish the paper had published.
“Kawahara,” the girl said, giving Harry a lukewarm smile and shaking his hand, "Kimi… Nanka Inu kusai! *"
The stupid charm that charlatan Lockhart had bragged about in his memoirs suprisingly worked and the boy did not transform back for the remainder of the night. It was a small victory and Draco hoped that his conversation with the mistress of the Orphanage would be as fruitful. He started the car, pulling into the sparse Sunday traffic and drove towards Whitechapel.
There will be a few of the Japanese characters that will speak a phrase here and there I shall provide a translation when necessary.
He turned around to find a Weasley girl, a scowl on her freckled face, pointing her wand straight at his chest. Of course, how he could forget about that creature. Potter and her were a couple. Or at least this was he remembered.
Draco opened his drowsy eyes, a sad smile stretching his lips and he lifted his hand towards the Gryffindor’s cheek, gently moving his fingers over his jawbone.
The blonde sat on one of the dusty velvet chairs in the audience and patted another for Harry to join him.
The werewolf attacked Harry, his sharp nails dug into his skin and his teeth bit into his shoulder. The Gryffindor cried out in pain as blood started gushing from his torn vein and spilling everywhere, he felt hot and cold at the same time and then he saw a vicious curse take over Greyback who prepared for another bite.
They stopped on the empty street in the muggle neighborhood. A group of drunk youth in tattered costumes and painted faces were walking along on the pavement paying no mind to a vintage Mercedes-Benz.
“Draco?” he heard a sleepy voice mumble his name, “You still here… Aren’t your… folks going to worry?”
“No, miss, not for the bloody DMLE,” he spat. “You know how many raids there were since the war ended? Four! Four this year! And this new minister was supposed to be a bit more lenient for our lot!”
“I don’t want a contraband piece of wood that belonged to some dead arsehole!” the girl objected, wincing when her hair got pulled a bit. “I want a proper wand of my own, purchased from a proper wandmaker!”
“Well, Mr. There-is-a-spell-for-everything, my father doesn’t even let me have a wand,” the girl retorted, “And somehow we need to make my hair as light as yours, so your bloody cover doesn’t get blown.”
The world around him whirled with lights and faces of people and glimpses of places. Usually when one was to take the Memory Restoring Elixir they would need to calm their mind and meditate before taking it. Otherwise, there were cases of people losing their minds from the sheer overexertion.
“No clue. Let’s get out of here… I think you’re bleeding,” the brunette suggested and rummaged for his wand.
The door with two serpents was half-open, and there was nobody in the hallway, not even a house-elf to greet him. Draco lifted his wand and the wards let him in easily. The orphanage looked deserted. The walls once covered with colorful posters, children’s drawings, and dozens of smiling photographs were now empty, showing only the yellowing wallpaper. The doors to various rooms and chambers were shut and there were no signs on them like before. The shoe-rack which usually was overflowing with Wellies and odd slippers was completely barren. Even the umbrella stand had only one clear plastic muggle brolly in it.
“What about Elise Baelish? Who is responsible for her murder?” he continued his impromptu interrogation.
“Very well! I can take care of that myself!” the veela cackled and then the Auror lifter her hands towards her own neck and started strangling herself.
He was grateful that at least she wasn’t giving him grief about it, although, he suspected she wouldn’t be so gentle if she had known what happened.
“Don’t strain yourself, Mr. Potter!” Baelish warned. “There’s not much you can do about this situation.”
“Yeah, just… er… pulled my injured shoulder a bit too quick,” he lied and touched his burn gingerly.
“About that…” Harry started, “I’d asked Elise to modify his memory because it turns out he fancied me a bit, and that’s why he was so reluctant to let me be killed and stuff.”
“You were right…” he started, earning a questioning look from the blonde. “I was in denial. I am probably as bent as you are… and I wouldn’t mind… er, doing things with you.”
Harry’s eyelids fluttered and then his face grimaced in pain as he slowly came back to consciousness.
“What…” the blonde asked incredulously, then he grabbed Harry’s forearm and hauled him to his feet. “What are you playing at, scarhead?!”
He came up to her, taking a hairbrush out of her hand, and started slowly untangling her straight black locks. It would be such a shame to damage them with peroxide for his sake. But the Polyjuice potion usually started wearing off at the crown of one’s head. And it was only a matter of time before someone would notice Megumi’s jet-black hair turning into platinum blonde.
"Seriously, you bloody junkie! How many times do I have to say to stop getting high here?"Blaise huffed.
Draco was mortified with the look the menacing bodyguard, Ootani, was giving him when he knocked politely on the door to Megumi’s room. She answered after a few minutes of fumbling. The girl was wearing a colorful muggle one-sie with a plush dragon head on the hood. Draco expected something like that to be found in his four-year-old cousin’s wardrobe. What an utter child she was.
Maybe he should have sold the story to papers, Draco thought about it darkly and then remembered how Potter had protected him countless times from being publicly ridiculed and his malicious thoughts were replaced by a desperate sort of longing. The one that made him ache and want to take more potions.
A small barn owl knocked on the window of the number 12, and he knew that he couldn’t just ignore it anymore. He picked up an official looking letter from Auror Baelish stating that his visitation request had been granted.
His mind drifted to the Gryffindor who was slumped in a narrow booth away from curious truckers, nursing his dreadful mug of coffee and picking at his roast beef sandwich without any interest. Draco was able to find enough wound dressing inside the ambulance to safely re-wrap Harry’s shoulder. What bothered him though was the fact that the other lad was still wearing a bright yellow uniform jacket and green trousers over his hospital gown and probably looked absolutely ridiculous to anyone who managed to see through Draco’s glamour spells.
She was wary of those who needed to get the potion for a child in such a back-alley way. As her experience showed a lot of them weren’t good people.
Sometimes he dreamed of Potter, of his dark eyelashes and beauty marks running down his neck, the sharp white lines of his scars, and how easy it was to leave bruises and love bites on his skin. He could almost feel his ticklish nest of hair under his fingers, he could almost taste those full always chapped lips that liked to smile so much for no good reason, he could almost smell tea and muggle shampoo and something sweet that made up his scent. But then he would see blood, torn flesh next that delectable collarbone, a stain of crimson spreading all over that beautiful skin and he would wake up and scream and sob and beg the guard to put him out of his misery.
Potter sat there with a very strange expression on his face, he looked somehow so subdued and hurt. Draco realized that he must have been thinking about his terrible muggle relatives that were cruel to him all his formative years. He wanted to comfort Harry in some way but remembered that it was important to fish out the location of the memories from this woman.
“Thank you, Bob.” Amanda said curtly, and pulled a thick wad of muggle cash out of her crimson robes, “You take pounds, I assume.”
“There are just a few left… I am sorry I am making you keep them,” she looks and the lady apologetically.
...He glances back and finds that same boy following him in the school corridors, looking at him as he eats in the Great Hall, staring at his notes in class...
"Oh, really? She transferred from the Department of Mysteries to the DMLE a couple of weeks ago," Harry shrugged his shoulders. "Or is it an Unspeakable thing and you can't tell me?"
“But I haven’t seen you in forever… Can I kiss you first?” he asked flirtatiously reaching to trace boy’s lower lip with his thumb.
…. Red… the curtains over his bed were red… he was in his dormitory… what a weird dream… he shouldn’t have drunk that much… He could still pick up a slight smell of tobacco…
But Malfoy seemed like he hadn’t been listening to her at all. Perhaps he had some personal disagreements with the Orphanage’s former mistress that were too difficult to overcome. Whoever made that whistle-blower report in the Quibbler had been absolutely justified to be outraged by what they'd discovered in St. Barbara’s. However, many of those kids were shameful rejects of the pureblood families and after the orphanage closed they went back to the families that didn’t want them in the first place. For them, it was a lose-lose situation.
At least he was getting better at Healing Charms, Granger had slipped him a book with them the next time they worked together on their potion project. There was a note inside asking him to report it to McGonagall but Draco simply shook his head. What good would it bring, he was already a Death Eater scum, reporting would make him a snitch as well. He was grateful to Granger because he had something to talk about to his probation officer: Draco made a muggle-born friend.
Harry did not expect his best friend to be so calm and rational when it came to his issues with Draco and he did not expect him to side with the Ministry on that one either.
“Well, well, Malfoy, making the mudblood do your dirty work? You never cease to amaze me with the level to which you’re willing to sink,” Nott spat, “Does she even know what you’ve done?”
He forgot how to make words, his tongue felt like a useless muscle flopping around inside his mouth, so he just shook his head.
He saw flashes of light at the greenhouse and figured out that it was probably a place of the meeting. The Gryffindor unlocked the glass door and stepped into an immense jungle of plants of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The smell of different pollen was heavy in the air and he could hear faint buzzing of some insects that had survived winter in here. He moved farther, carefully maneuvering between the vines and the leaves not to cause much rustle.
“I did,” Draco confirmed. ”I thought it was mine… You have nothing to worry about, Potter. I have kept plenty of secrets before... and it’s not like I didn’t know stuff about you already.”
She always looked so fragile these days, Draco often found her just spacing out in the garden or when she had her tea. Narcissa rarely showed her emotions, but he could tell that Lucius’ death was devastating for her.
He found Potter’s warm fingers, stroking them gently and intertwining them with his. It reminded him of their evening in the courtyard back at Hogwarts and he wanted to just be like that, not caring about the world outside of their little universe that consisted of one bedroom in the refurbished Victorian house.
“Auror Baelish will need to modify your memories a bit before the hearing, though. I hope it’s not a problem.” Potter finally met his gaze, he was sorry for him.
Muggle club music was blasting on full volume from the speakers, and many excited youths were breaking the sweat on the dance floor, some way too close to each other for Harry’s comfort. He was grateful that his mediocre glamour spell worked well enough in the sparsely lit bar and nobody was trying to strike a conversation. He made his way to the bar counter, where a dark-skinned lad in a scandalously tight sheer synthetic shirt was serving complicated-looking cocktails to the patrons. The bartender looked eerily familiar, and he could have bet he had seen him at Hogwarts.
There were rows of mismatched jack-o-lanterns with crooked and uneven faces, colorful stickers, and bright spots of gouache paint lining the walls and handmade bats, witches, and skeletons decorated every surface.
“Ron… Shit, Ron… is Ginny inside too?” Potter exclaimed not leaving a protective circle of Draco’s embrace.
The other students who were standing in the corridor were staring and whispering among each other. Ron popped his head out of the compartment and was gaping at him.
"Well, did you stick your mobile up your bum by any chance? Cause nobody has heard from you since last weekend!" Megumi sulked.
“How did you…” he thought he had been careful, always going out when everyone in his dorm room was sleeping deeply and not letting Malfoy notice him either. He wasn’t sure the Slytherin would appreciate seeing him after Harry did exactly what he forbade him to do: take him to Pomfrey.
Harry’s throat felt tight for a moment. His being the Chosen One had helped him immensely when he was applying for the Auror Training Programme. Nobody had bothered to look at his medical records that stated his lycanthropy status. And he was able to pass unnoticed into the DMLE force. If he had been someone else, he wouldn’t have even had a chance to participate in the entrance exam. Having lycanthropy was a liability for the Auror and those who were bitten later in their career were made to retire or resign of their own volition.
They were practicing all the N.E.W.T. - related spells in the Defence Against the Dark Arts class. Instead of one teacher a different instructor from DMLE each month was teaching them new incantations and techniques. Auror Proudfoot was supervising today and he divided them into pairs to duel.
Narcissa’s eyes were brimming with tears, she hugged the lady fiercely, her arms shaking with emotion.
The Slytherin knew what would happen next, the Cruciatus curse attacked his strained nervous system, sending him into the abyss of agony. He was too anxious about his mother to dissociate, feeling all of the impact. The ropes tightened, preventing him from writhing on the floor and he felt like lack of oxygen made his mind swim, he was about to faint, to plunge into sweet oblivion.
“Is… is he okay?” the Slytherin asked meekly. He had never lost control like that, he must have been going mad in that Wellness and Reform Center.
“Exactly, the Aurors will be here in no time!” the git was grinning like a loon, “Oh, here’s one coming already!”
“Did he torture you? I’ve seen plenty of Death Eaters throwing Cruciatus at you before but you didn’t flinch… What has he done? You need to tell me and the bastard will pay. I’ll make sure of it!” she was adamant to keep questioning him.
He simply nodded, not willing to let go of him just yet. The door opened for a moment, there was an intake of breath and then it closed with a careful thud.
Draco let go. Not Zabini then… He could not recall anyone else who could be reappearing in so many of his memories and somehow make them all blurry and unstable.
“I can’t accept your offer! Yaxley is still at large and with me gone he would go straight for Harry,” Draco shook his head.
“So… what are you trying to say here, Malfoy?!” he looked properly angry and unguarded by glasses his gaze was piercing and desperate.
“Come on, don’t be a bore! Stay for a few songs at least,” she grinned at him. “I’m Becky by the way.”
“But why, Draco?” the Gryffindor asked a bit desperately, he was nursing his sore shoulder and his bandages started to seep through, Draco must have pulled him too hard.
The blonde cast a quick unlocking spell and half-dragged the ridiculous lad onto the passenger side. It was quite a task since the seats were higher than in a normal sedan. Once Potter was successfully inside, Draco hopped behind the steering wheel. Another spell and the muggle engine came to life, the blinkers and the ambulance siren turned on as well. The blonde pulled out of the parking space grazing the neighboring cars in the process. He had never driven the vehicle that was that big and bulky.
....Emerald… Potter’s eyes when he orgasms are wet and bright and full of lust for him. His body is a map of scars and burns and remains of evil curses but he is perfect nevertheless...
The chamber orchestra had already set up on the stage and the hosts entered the ballroom in matching costumes of silk and organza. Daphne and Astoria followed them, dressed as water fairies, with sparkling bejeweled hair ornaments and robes of aqua and cerulean blue. She looked pretty, he had to admit, a bit shy for such a grandiose event but at least her smile was less fake than any other in the room.
“Because she had discovered something that she shouldn’t have… All those vials that you want, you can’t have them. There are no vials anymore. But I know who can get you the memories and I know who killed Miranda and for that, you will trade!” the blonde stood strong, and at that moment he was fearless and had an upper hand.
“You guys are mental! It has been three weeks already and the more I look at it the further it is from being done!” sighed the ginger, returning the hug.
He opened it and pulled out the metal drawer, presenting its contents to the two visitors. They were both blonde, almost like brother and sister, but their faces couldn’t be less similar. A woman looked healthy with plump cheeks and rosy complexion; and a young man was sickly, his sharp features accentuating the lack of rest on his face.
The muggle hotel they were currently staying in smelled of mold, mothballs, and stale smoke. The walls were covered in sickly beige wallpaper and the bedding had to be cleaned a couple of times with the strongest Scourgify for Draco to be able to sleep on it normally. He would stare into the darkness, his tired eyes tracing cracks in the plaster on the ceiling and his painfully sober mind trying to come up with some sort of plan. Draco might have convinced his mother that he knew what to do when he decided not to ask that Auror for help, but the truth was that he was just trying to survive at that moment.
He felt a sharp pull of the seat-belt on his chest and midriff as the moving car came to a sudden halt. His head hit something soft and big and inflated as he heard the windshield crack dangerously. He gingerly tried moving his arms, pushing away the annoying airbag, and looked towards the driver’s seat. The other person was alive but there was blood on his hiking jacket.
"Halt! DMLE!"a commanding voice spoke and then two idiots in crimson uniforms burst into the room. The boy screamed loudly, his magic crackling around him and producing a giant shockwave of pure destruction. One of the Aurors was thrown into the wall and knocked unconscious immediately. The other one was a bit more cautious, hiding behind the overthrown desks.
Memories of that strange ride in the underground train overwhelmed him: his arm was bleeding, and Potter was pressed to him on that filthy bench, his hands grasping his limbs painfully, his raspy young voice whispering over his ear something, whips of air tickling his skin, making his body shiver.
“Here, Pibsy,” he handed it carefully, “You need to calm down a bit, okay? You haven’t done anything bad… Your mistress forbade you to speak of it, right? Er… nod if it’s true.”
“Mother, I haven’t…” Draco protested, his eyes were darting around wildly as he was trying to think what to do next.
“It is a meeting place with a person who shall secure us an international portkey to safety,” Narcissa explained.
“Hello to you too,” the Gryffindor smiled, letting Teddy go from his arms and taking a step closer to Draco.
“Alright!” Hermione let him go, wiping away her tears and sat across from him with determination, “I have been trying to crack that code, the one in your Tibi at Igni message. And I think I’ve got it!”
“You seem to know your way around a muggle hospital,” the blonde looked at her curiously. “Are you even an Auror?”
“All right, today I am assigning you the partners you will most likely stick with for the rest of your Auror career. These have been approved by the Head Auror Robards so if you have any suggestions or complaints, you can jolly well stick them up your bum since he is not the man to change his mind,” Savage guffawed and gave the group a sympathetic look.
The woman nodded and gave a lad next to her a sympathetic glance, “Come on, Malfoy. It’s not like you haven’t seen a dead body before!”
“What the fuck! Are you barking mad?! That’s a bloody Dark Mark!” the Gryffindor protested, his scar did not hurt at the sight of it in the slightest, after Voldemort’s demise it wad just a menacing picture in the air.
“Relax a little, want to sample sensei’s new invention?” TJ already managed to produce a vial of some sort filled with shimmering pink liquid and twirled it in his hand in front of him. “Quite potent stuff I must add, but it makes you shag like bunnies. Hence why I came to greet you with my fly undone.”
“Okay, I know how to keep secrets… I didn’t say that Kriss wet herself the other night to anyone!” the girl said.
“Well, fucking obviously! Use your gray matter, Potter, cast something other than Expelliarmus!” the blonde retorted, skidding off to the backstreet and moving towards a less populated area.
Harry had a speech to make and hands to shake and interviews to give. But he couldn’t concentrate on any of that because of the way his body started to behave anticipating the changes that would occur on Saturday night.
A blonde woman was waiting impatiently at the back entrance for any sign of the embalmer’s van that meant to deliver a prepared casket with the corpse. Next to her, a bereaved widow stood, visibly uncomfortable in her mourning garb, a long veil covering her face and a cigarette smoldering between her fingers.
He didn’t care one goddamn bit if there was a whole squad of DMLE waiting to arrest him. There was a small chance that the Orphanage’s wayward magic wards were strong enough not to give away his transgression. In any way, he really hoped that him saving the bint’s life would count for something. She cast a full body bind on the veela and moved towards Potter to check on him.
“But the fight is not over! The battle is not won! Every day I and many other people like me face discrimination and ostracism in the wizarding world!”
“Olie was a quiet kid,” the Auntie continued, “but they were friends with Elise… I thought maybe one day those two would tie the knot, but alas. She is too much of a career woman, that girl.”
“Do you want to die?! Are you really such a stupid plonker that you will let yourself be dead just because you’re horny?!” the Slytherin hissed.
“Oh, right… I forgot, not a big fan of brunettes. How about now?” her hair changed its color to blonde, it started to become shorter and shorter.
The mystery continues and is it me or our boys might start to like each other ;) The shenanigans are coming soon, I just need a bit of plot first.
Haley and Kristine noded and ran along the corridor. The dark-haired girl, Martha, folded her arms adamantly and demanded to stay.
Draco rolled his eyes, he stepped out of the car and waved his wand, summoning some sort of outfit for Potter. He mismatched the socks but judging by the similar pattern on them, the twit probably wore odd socks all the time.
He still heard something that seemed like quite a fierce argument between Potter and his girlfriend.
“I am serious, Malfoy. I know what’s it like to always want a drink,” he looked at the Slytherin earnestly. He noticed that Draco’s complexion was even paler than usual, his hair not properly groomed and his eyes darting wildly around the room.
“Stall the mistress! Nobody needs to know we’re here! We’ll be back soon!” the blonde instructed the pupils.
She had been approached like that a couple of times by people with lycanthropy, who were too scared to go through the hospital and get a proper prescription. What they didn’t know is that her ward did not keep one’s full name on the record. So far they could get away with just writing the number of lycanthropy patients that came each month to seek medication. However, she understood that even being seen in the facility every time before the full moon could cause suspicion and potentially damage the reputation of an unregistered person.
"Jolly good, Weasley," Draco grinned maliciously, "But who said that I would let you of all people arrest me! I saved your arse from the Obscurus. You should be grateful."
She was a bit barmy at that moment. What was she even suggesting? To forget about his family responsibility and about the fact that Potter was trying his best to seem straight and pursue whatever strange relationship was between them. It was a recipe for a disaster, public ridicule, and a broken heart.
“Rise and shine, Draco,” she smirked. “I have been trying for hours... you must have repressed that memory, but I need to know about Fenrir Greyback nevertheless.”c
Harry would take casting multiple Confunduses at next-door neighbors any day to being swarmed by the press had someone known where the Savior of the wizarding world actually lived.
“Well,” the Gryffindor exhaled after his shoulder was carefully wrapped in fresh dressing, “What are we going to do next?”
"He hurt you!" she exclaimed, "And yet you refused to tell your parents and your aunt it was him, that day at the manor. Why? Wouldn't you want revenge?"
He was about to go inside the room that was glistening with a spell when he felt the whoosh of the wind from the open front door and someone was standing behind him. Draco turned around sharply and saw a disheveled female Auror. She was breathing heavily, her impeccable ponytail a mess, and her crimson uniform unbuttoned.
he woke up with a gasp looking around and probably hallucinating. He wasn’t on the floor of that abandoned warehouse, covered in blood and vomit, he could smell that familiar muggle shampoo on himself, a nice fluffy blanket felt cool on his skin and a dim night light made a room cozy and safe. Draco blinked a couple of times making sure he wasn’t imagining this. But no it was definitely Potter’s bedroom and he was lying there alone.
“Well, you already know who I am,” Malfoy huffed, giving a pained glance to McGonagall, who left them alone, and leaned over one of the desks, crossing his arms and looking bored out of his mind.
The apartment in muggle London they were currently in had many of the items that reminded Draco of Auror Baelish. There was a mug with a golden letter M on it, probably nicked from the Auror’s Office, a violin case, propped onto the mantelpiece and a couple of wizarding and muggle photographs on the wall showed Amanda and Elise together, smiling, hugging each other, looking completely carefree and in love.
“Easy there, Harry, I don’t want to hurt you,” the nurse gave him a lopsided grin. He felt fingers trying to pry his clenched jaws open and then a bitter liquid on his tongue, he was being drugged yet again.
“I wanted to talk,” Harry replied, coming up to stand next to him at the window. “I’m trying to help... Can you, please, tell me what happened?”
The room unraveled back into the reality, it was so hot around, the flame was slowly getting closer and the veela was still standing over them like some sort of avenging angel of death. Amanda stopped struggling and was desperately gulping smoke-filled air, she wasn’t staring at the creature anymore. The spell was broken.
“The Youngest Hollyhead Harpie in the century, blah blah blah,” she rolled her eyes at him. “You sound like my dad. I swear he will start making T-shirts with it soon.”
“Okay, I’ll humor you, if you promise me to come to class today,” Ron exhaled warily, he picked up one of the photos from the pile on his bed and flipped it to the other side, not to see the bloodied body depicted. “My father has some connections with the muggle police, we can find out… But, mate, come on. You cannot sit there trying to summon his ghost with these bloody pictures!”
“I want you to… please… do it, Draco,” Harry moaned into another boys ear but that somehow had a completely different effect on the blonde.
“Did she ever look into your thoughts?” Draco asked carefully. He had never spoken with anyone who had been in a relationship with a legilimens and wanted to know what was considered to be normal and what was completely overstepping the boundaries. The situation with Harry was too complicated for him to even start comprehending. The Slytherin felt as though he had opened Pandora’s box. Once Potter had let him into his mind, that door was never closed properly and it was just too easy to poke and prod at it until what little defense was left submitted to his juvenile attempts at mind-reading.
Draco put his hand on the injured shoulder and Harry winced in pain, floo powder jar broke, shimmering sand was now scattered all over that wretched Persian rug.
“It’s going to be okay,” he felt a hand stroke his hair away from his forehead soothingly, “Kingsley assured me that they are taking care of it.”
“I’m afraid Mister Potter doesn’t need to know about any of this. And especially about that poor Healer.” the girl said gravely.
“There isn’t anymore. I threw all the dark arts-related tat away! And I am not feeding your addiction, so take the goddamn pills and stop pissing me off!” Potter looked all worked up about it like he was actually worried about Draco.
An older woman opened the door, pointing her wand at him. She resembled a bird of prey, with her sharp black eyes and long narrow nose. Her hair started graying even more than before and was wildly flowing around her face so unlike her slick buns and updos that Auntie was famous for before the scandal.
Harry grabbed the house-elf under his arm and they jumped out of the second floor, wind and wayward spells whooshing in their ears.
“I dunno, I guess it is weird to be back here on this day,” he said, looking at the castle across the dark water of the lake.
Draco sighed wearily and sat up. It was no use arguing with Isaiah Abraham, a stage name, that was even more ridiculous than any of the wizarding names he had ever heard. He wanted to throttle the git but before that, he needed to take his portion of dessert just to spite him.
He shut his eyes tightly fighting with disturbing images that flooded his brain. He remembered the time the Dark Lord lived in the Manor.
Everyone and their nan knew about uncle Alphard, the first queer in Blacks’ bloodline to be demonstratively scorched off the family tree by his own well-wishing sister. He was a cautionary tale to those purebloods who refused to breed despite not being attracted to their match whatsoever. The fact that his mother brought it up was so ridiculous Draco wanted to roll his eyes at it.
...Burgundy… the drapes on the four-posted bed are dark red just like back at Hogwarts… it’s Potter’s bedroom… his bed is completely unmade… they breathe heavily after another round of fooling around… he doesn’t let him go all the way but whatever they do still feels brilliant…
Yaxley nodded to Greyback and the werewolf was about to lower his wand when he sniffed the air and bared his fangs maliciously.
He found her at the library, sitting in the Arithmancy section, surrounded by uneven piles of books that were about to tumble down at any moment, her hair a wild mess.
not just wanted him, not longed for the feeling of his body under his touch. The realization hit him like a bludger and thoughts swarmed in his head like angry doxies… He didn’t want to run away like a coward, he would even forgive the git his stunt in the Quibbler, he would forgive him a murder if the occasion called for it… he just wanted to be with him again, to see that toothy smile, to hear those awkward jokes and backhanded compliments. But most importantly he needed to pay back to that bastard Yaxley for bringing Greyback to the handoff, for hurting him.
“Draco?” Harry was insulted by this lack of response to his touch, his face stung and his wound was throbbing painfully under the bandages.
Harry’s lycanthropy messed up his senses pretty badly. On the one hand, it had made them sharper and more accurate. But, on the other hand, he couldn’t recall how it felt to experience the world around him from the average person’s perspective. This overwhelming array of sounds, colors and scents was Harry’s new normal.
They were sitting in the lobby of Crowne Plaza Hotel, trying to look as inauspicious as they could, given Harry’s roughed-up clothes and a bright crimson jacket on the Auror.
He couldn’t believe this ridiculous git. He was in the muggle hospital on the brink of turning into a vegetable one moment, then avoiding the Aurors, crawling out of wrecked vehicles, and skipping around like nothing had happened in another.
He slowly turned around to see Amanda standing there, in the men’s lavatory, a sour expression on her face.
“Let’s see how we’re doing with that bite,” Kevin muttered, and slowly unwrapped the bandages, “Who bandaged you? Looks quite professional”
His eyes felt like sand was rolling inside them, he probably consumed more cola than his cousin could with his favorite extra-large meals from Nando’s, but Harry kept at it, leafing through he ministry records Mr. Weasley had smuggled for him. Anything that could connect Baelish and Yaxley and Williamson.
Draco nodded. He really didn't want to intrude on the boy's thoughts, but he feared that it could be the only way.
“You must have forgotten what happened at St. Mungo’s then,” the blonde huffed irritably at this display of foolish selflessness. “You were trespassing, escaped the arrest, and then…”
“The keys, the muggle keys… they’re usually somewhere in the corridor!” he levitated the dresser and made a makeshift barricade out of it, while Draco was frantically rummaging through drawers in search of the object.
"Daijobu?*" a sharp female voice asked Draco, and he saw Megumi appear in the room, still holding his Beretta in her small hands, the muggle bodyguard Ootani towering over her with a semi-automatic rifle ready to shred anything and everything  in the orphanage. "You should always take your gun with you. Karera wo dou suru?**"
“You did, didn’t you?! Have you also told him about uncle Alphard… What shame he brought upon the family?!” the other woman was relentless.
Happy Birthday to my fellow Gemini, Draco Malfoy. He's trying his best to do the right thing here :)
“Well, I don’t have any,” he said hotly, “Come on, let’s get you changed, your clothes are soaked in blood…”
This house should have had plenty of bedrooms so he might as well move the Gryffindor to one of them, he tried levitating the sleeping sod but his wand hand was still throbbing and he couldn’t concentrate his foggy feverish mind on doing so. Draco finally gave up, mustering enough strength to drag the boy onto the sofa next to him. They were way to close and Potter’s sweater was scratchy with stains of dry blood on it, but he wrapped his arm around him and buried his nose in messy locks at the nape of his neck. For just a little bit he wanted to pretend that they were like this together by choice and not because of some fucked up circumstances.
“Who is that person?” Draco was curious. It all sounded quite fishy and he was wondering whether it was another elaborate trap by the Ministry or former Death Eaters.
“If there are any traces of substances present you will receive a warning and some of your privileges will be revoked,” the nurse explained monotonously, making sure that Draco wasn’t doing anything suspicious. “Is it clear, Mr. Malfoy?”
They waited for good ten minutes before they saw the headlights nearing the narrow alleyway and the black Mercedes stopped in front of them, badly scratched, a part of stripy muggle barrier stuck to the front bumper.
“I think burgundy is a bit too much for your complexion, don’t you agree?” the woman takes the yard of dyed cashmere away from his shoulder.
…A big two-sided door with two engraved serpents wrapped around the ornate handles. A girl around ten or eleven years of age is in front of it, a set of too big crimson robes covering her shoulders. A man holding a box of toys and personal things is standing next to her, he is tall and dark-skinned a silver earring shining in one ear. An Auror, Kingsley Shacklebolt.
He didn’t want to obsess over this injury anymore, he didn’t want to think about the fact that he had no choice but to leave him for good. The only thing he wanted was to touch him more. His hands moved lower to pull down the zipper on his trousers and caress his erect cock. Harry hissed at the sensation of the icy fingers touching him there, but then he guided Draco’s hand further behind to show him what exactly he wanted.
“We cannot drive like that around all these muggles! Someone will see us!” Harry exclaimed worriedly as a cacophony of klaxons erupted around them.
“Why do you think I can’t just use Legillimency on you and get the answers myself?” the Death Eater retorted.
The door to the compartment opened, and they saw Ginny standing there, she seemed a bit guilty and was trying not to look Harry in the eye.
"What is it? It's completely corporeal, it's not made of mist like a Patronus," he asked, bewildered.
“We want to recruit you,” she said. “You are a skillful wizard and you clearly have some talent for Legillimency. We need people like you on the field.”
One thing that convinced Hermione that the elf should continue serving at Grimmauld place was the fact that he made sure Harry was taken care of when it came to his lycanthropy. Kreacher would always go to the Apothecary to refill his prescription. And he would even draw a hot bath for Harry to soak in when he stumbled into the house at the crack of dawn after the night of prowling the outskirts of London as a wolf. There were no comments about half-breeds or freaks either because the portrait of his beloved mistress was removed from the wall in the sitting room and stuffed in the attic.
Disclaimer: This chapter is a big middle finger to J.K.R's ridiculous TERFy beliefs and I don't support those who agree with them.
There were three people in the St. Mungo’s waiting room turned into the interrogation chamber – a young witch, probably still a few years after her training, an Auror, who was guarding Williamson’s door and inexplicably the Head of the Auror Office himself. They were all looking at Harry who sat uncomfortably in the rickety armchair, his arms folded defensively, and his eyes burning with righteous anger.
Draco did not particularly like this aspect of his job. He usually wasn’t the muscle to shake the galleons off of unfortunate loaners. There were much better methods of persuasion, but his current financial settlement crew thought differently. They were all rough and rugged wands for hire and didn’t particularly care about Draco’s aversion to blood smearing precious rugs in the Manor.
He pointed at Williamson walking towards them, his movements sharp and unnatural like he had been bewitched.
“Hey, Draco,” the lad called him over, “your sister came over this morning, I think she had left you a package at the nurse’s station.”
“Blimey, Harry! How did you manage to make this house even more unlivable?” asked Ron incredulously, stepping out of the fireplace and onto the sheet of plastic that was covering the floor in the living room of Number 12 Grimmauld place.
“A brilliant thing, isn’t it?” the blonde smirked, cast another strong disillusionment charm on the Mercedes, and pressed the gas pedal.
“Harry… It’s Auntie… It’s her, she is connected ot Elise's murder… She’s using children to store the memories,” he told the Gryffindor in a weak voice.
A small hand was on his forehead and then on his throat checking for a pulse. Then a finger pulled one of his eyelids open and some light was shining into his eyes.
The blonde cast a spell to clean himself and smirked, “Aunt Andromeda showed me a passage that connects these two houses. Her place used to be a safe house for the Order of the Phoenix and there is an enchanted barrel of whiskey that works as a two way portkey between her house and here. It was for emergencies only, though.”
Finally, Weasley emerged from his hideout, came up to where Draco was crouching and holding the kid in his arm, and pointed his wand at them.
There was no way his cock could get any harder, but yet he felt like he was about to come just from the thought of Draco impaling himself on those talented fingers to get ready for him. He would never have imagined that a person who had been lecturing him about pureblood proprieties, was willing to let himself be fucked.
However, now I am more than determined to finish it and maybe there will be a sequel in the future as well.
"If she is your partner, look for her yourself," the girl replied coldly and left without saying goodbye.
She saw Hogwarts... a bathroom floor drenched in water and someone's blood... a boy, pale as a ghost. Crimson streaks slashed over his chest... and another boy, Potter, crouching next to him, his terrified eyes so big behind the round spectacles.
“And is there any sufficient evidence to show that it was Draco who did it?” her mouth became one stern line.
… It is a familiar place, magical machines and trinkets are swirling and chirping and letting out steam. A tall wizard with a long gray beard and half-moon glasses is looking intently at the woman in crimson Auror robes.
Harry crept up closer and snuck a look over Slytherin’s shoulder to remember the date and the location of the event in case the git tries to do something notorious while outside Hogwarts. He caught a pleasant whiff of Malfoy’s cologne. It was fresh, citrusy and a faint hint of tobacco smell was strangely complementing it. Harry mentally cursed himself, he shouldn’t be sniffing Draco sodding Malfoy while trying to catch an imposter.
“What’s a Painless Poppy Philtre, Hermione?” Harry asked when the three of them were sitting together once again in the Potions’ classroom. Malfoy hadn’t shown up for the class that morning, so Hermione was leafing through some brewing books and trying to find a suitable potion for Ron and him to make.
He rummaged through his trouser pockets and pulled out a baggy filled with a couple of familiar pills.
It had been four years since he stepped into these halls. The place he had remembered every nook and cranny of in his childhood looked unfamiliar to him at that moment.  They had sold it and resold it over the years after it was taken as a part of war reparations. But somehow the Malfoy Manor just couldn’t find any permanent owner. Some even believed the place was cursed because the Dark Lord had resided there for many months during the war.
Harry didn’t expect to be locked in the car. He didn’t expect to be locked in the car after he a Draco sodding Malfoy managed to escape from an Auror under the Imperius Curse that was trying to kill them. And he definitely didn’t expect the plonker to kiss him like he did, to make him so aroused and bothered and then to let go, cast a body bind spell, stuff his wand in the glove compartment, and lock him up.
Kawahara was surprisingly good at weaseling out of a sticky situation. She managed to completely dismiss Savage's suspicions and get them both off the hook. Harry was grateful but agitated at the same time. She was hiding something. Perhaps she even knew about what really happened to Ron and Cormac. Once they were in their cubicle Harry had completely lost his cool and cornered her.
“Oh, you can see plenty of things if you know where to look,” he looked at Potter intently. “Remember the vial with a memory that you gave me. You thought it was mine… It wasn’t. It was a dossier of some sort about you. I think that girl Baelish made a bunch of those on all the people she had to deal with and Yaxley wants them desperately. That is what I’ve gathered so far.”
The game of battleship had ended abruptly when Draco stormed into the lounge area and dragged his poor roommate up by the collar of his standard-issued polo shirt. The older lady Isaiah had been playing with gave out a scandalized yelp and hurried away from the room.
A body fell to the ground with a loud thud and Draco inhaled soundlessly, he was trying to keep it quiet as long as Yaxley thought he was actually dead. The hand was on his pulse point and then he was shaken once again. He had no chance now. The blonde wished there was a way to notify somebody that he was there. Random images were still swimming in his mind, voices whispering nonsense, and faces that he did not recognize anymore were staring at him.
“I am amazed nobody tried opening it,” Harry commented, looking at the label. From his experience, those three words were an invitation for some not-so-sharp goon at the DMLE to pry.
“Miranda was working for the Order of the Phoenix all this time, right under your nose! She supplied them with all your darkest secrets, she fished out the information from all your associates,” the blonde was slowly moving closer towards them, Harry’s wand firmly clenched in his fist. “She took the memories, copied them, and sent the information straight to Dumbledore!”
They crawled out of the wrecked vehicle. Luckily the annoying siren wasn’t wailing anymore, but colorful blinkers were still shining every which way. Draco was rummaging in the back of the car and then he emerged triumphant, holding some medical supplies and a spare uniform for Harry to change into.
He came up to Draco, taking him by the forearm unceremoniously and dragged him away from the piano. The blonde noticed that his mother was also brought in by another man, whose face was eerily familiar to him.
His eagle owl returned with no reply from Blaize later that evening. Perhaps,  he was in hiding or had gone to America like he’d wanted to.
“Catch!” Draco produced another vial and threw it up in the air, the git caught it with the Seeker’s precision. He looked at it for a moment, shrugged his shoulders, and took a big sip.
A mad idea struck Harry’s mind, somehow the car was able to find Draco wherever he was, maybe there was a way to reverse engineer this and try to move it to the place without the summoning charm. He started clicking the buttons and pulling the levers to no avail until there was one with the picture that looked like a compass. The Gryffindor pressed it gingerly, praying to all the gods and wizards that it would work. And suddenly the car roared to life, turned on all the fancy lights on the dashboard, lit up its blinkers and started driving on its own, picking up more and more speed until Harry had no choice but to clutch at the seat belt and hope that he won’t crash or run somewhere into the ditch on his way to Malfoy.
When Draco first became acquainted with Fumihiro, he thought the man was too soft to be some sort of hot-shot gangster. But after three years of cleaning up the mess after his ruthless underlings and extorting information out of the most tight-lipped adversaries, he knew better than to call him soft. He had no problem using Draco’s magical abilities to torture snitches, extract money out of late payers, and spy on his potential allies and foes.
Blaize… Maybe it was him that Draco was involved with. He seemed fit and there was a certain charm about him that made girls from different houses swoon and send him arrays of love-letters and charmed sweets.
“Why did you run… you two dimwits!” somebody hissed behind him and Draco froze with his fly still undone in the middle of relieving himself into the muggle urinal.
“Have you heard of Saint Barbara’s Orphanage scandal?” Healer Cameron asked and noticed a dark shadow pass on Malfoy’s face.
His gaze wandered appreciatively over the curve of Harry’s arse as he bent down to put on his hideous muggle trainers and then Draco quickly threw out the cigarette butt and floored the gas pedal. Potter scrambled for a seat belt, trying to catch the odd trinkets that flew off the dashboard as the car made a sharp turn at the busy intersection, swerving past sluggish muggle transport effortlessly.
Who was he in love with then? It can’t have been Ginny, he liked her, he wanted things to work out with her, but Harry couldn’t call it love. Did somebody put some love potion into his drink or food? It was insane to even think that. He got angry but decided to send the wretched spirit anyway whatever shape it might have been.
“No! You cannot always take the blame for my actions!” Draco exclaimed, “It was my fault! I was too proud to ask for help and went to deal with Yaxley by myself! I will not be running away anymore!”
“He had to be stopped...” the girl said, replying to his thoughts, her wand hand was still shaking, but Draco couldn’t tell if it was from the shock or anger, “Bob... will you help me with the body?”
“Ron! Why are you… asking such questions? It is a bit creepy, don’t you think!” he wanted to hide under the covers just to avoid this conversation.
“I do too, mate, but you could’ve talked to us about it first…” Ron added quietly, “Malfoy’s on the run now, so it majorly cocks up his chances of ever being acquitted. Maybe Kingsley had his reasons to keep that lady free.”
thought Harry. He had disliked any legilimens since those disastrous lessons with Snape during his fifth year at Hogwarts.
"Mr Malfoy, as I recall you play." Auntie continued. "Some mind-readers use a certain melody to achieve a trance-like state in which they manipulate their consciousness and invade other people's minds. Do you have this sort of melody?"
It was too long for a license plate number and too short for a phone number, it had letters too. How was Harry supposed to decipher this mess? He could try to ask Hermione for help. And why was it written in muggle ink?
.... Black... Black hair sticking out every which way… he likes holding it in his fingers when Potter gives him head… and then he smiles like he has just tamed a dragon… toothy disgustingly sweet Gryffindor grin Draco knows he doesn’t deserve…
“I think so,” the Slytherin remembered those sincere smiles Potter always gave him even when they weren’t fooling around.
“What happened, Harry? You can tell me anything,” Hermione asked for the umpteenth time since he came here.
The blonde started crawling towards a bigger crate as the Death Eater was dueling with a few Aurors, a whirlwind of crimson and black robes in front of him and wayward spells chipping the concrete away in the warehouse. He managed to hide behind the metal container and breathe in full lungs of air for the first time. There was a constant buzzing sound in his head, and the surroundings were still a bit blurry but at least he felt somewhat safe.
The grand ballroom in the Greengrass estate was lavishly decorated by the most exquisite Christmas ornaments. Large garlands of holly and evergreens were hanging off the walls and frozen trees with charmed ice crystals, that chimed every time someone walked by, framed the main entrance. There was an outrageously tall fur tree in the center, an array of baubles all shapes and sizes, candles, and miniature ice sculptures on its heavy branches.
“No, you don’t!” the Slytherin said coldly. “Fuck off, will you? I don’t know what is your deal but it’s disturbing!”
“I will... after the incident at St. Mungo’s I am inclined to believe your side of the story” she smirked.
“Thank you, er… Auror. Please wait outside until further orders,” Shacklebolt said and offered Draco a seat.
“D-Dontcha start yourself” Potter replied, slurring his words. He looked sickly and pale, his hair was even messier than usual and his body shivering. “I ac-actually need t-to talk to ya.”
“And what sort of wrong impression they might get, huh?” he sneered, grabbing the git by the shirt collar and glaring at him.
The Slytherin would most likely be captured by the DMLE, he would be arrested and tried for something. They will find a way to fabricate enough evidence to make him go to Azkaban just for the hell of it. And Harry would not be able to protect him anymore, because all of his efforts to make sure that Draco was safe and out of prison were destroyed by that one lie.
“So, when does your Auror Training Programme start?” Ginny asked after she successfully outmaneuvered Harry and caught the snitch.
“What is happening... Granger?! Harry?!” Horace Slughorn looked stunned and visibly disappointed to see both of them standing next to bloodied and tied down Theodore Nott.
But the worst thing was his temper. He had snapped at unlucky colleagues that were trying to ask some mundane questions. Ron was doing his best to say that it was him being nervous before the big occasion. But even his patience was wearing thin with Harry’s uncalled grumpiness. The only person who did not take any of his shit was surprisingly Megumi Kawahara. She, for once, managed to come to work every day of that week without vanishing somewhere mysteriously.
He hated such kind of research but Hermione was on the Healer duty most of the time, although it felt more like she was studying a fascinating subject than helping Malfoy regain some sort of semblance of reality. Harry had seen her writing notes as often as administering medicine and taking the vitals.
“You’re right,” a bespectacled head appeared in the rectangular window and Harry went back into the audience. “So what are we going to do then? We can’t watch a film.”
“Harry James Potter, you have no right to mess with people’s memories even if it Malfoy. Even if he likes you!” her voice was cold.
Harry nodded and exhaled tiredly, “It’s all my fault. I knew I should’ve stayed away when I discovered he was released… But he came to my house... on his own... and I didn’t think of hiding the potions…”
“Mister Potter, Mister Malfoy, you need to hurry,” the man said urgently. “The Portkey is going to go off in ten minutes. Follow me!”
"I will not have a Death Eater brat like you meddling in my business!" the lady quickly changed her tone of voice.
“Why is he lurking about there?” Ron interrupted his thoughts pointing at the fogged-up window. Outside the pub a tall shape of Draco Malfoy wrapped in his expensive fur-lined cloak was standing apprehensively.
The blonde winced. He was pretty sure that Baelish was the one who fucked with his memory and now he was being framed for allegedly killing her.
He found him in the kitchen the next morning, with no spectacles, damp hair, and pensive expression on his face. The smell of muggle shampoo, bacon, and eggs and freshly brewed tea lingering in the cold air.
“Mate, you need to finish soon,” said Ron eventually, “The portkey to Australia is on Monday, so ‘Mione and I had better start packing already. Mum is going to be barmy as it is with Fleur being pregnant and us leaving.”
It was the main reason they both agreed to take up that project in the first place. Granger told him how she had to Obliviate her parents to keep them safe and perhaps at that moment she stopped being a stuck-up know-it-all for Draco and became a real person. He could not imagine what it was like to know that your loved ones are still alive but have no idea about your existence.
“You cannot lock a child in a cellar! Even if they're uncontrollable!”Healer Cameron exclaimed, “Why haven’t you talked to the Aurors?!”
“Harry! I need to talk to you!” Ginny had ambushed him when he was about to leave the common room and go up to the boys’ dormitories.
“We should probably go back,” he suggested, “I heard your mother wanted me to perform something for the guests.”
The door that he wasn’t allowed to lock creaked open and someone stepped into the room, making too much noise and huffing exasperatedly.
The morning came suddenly and Draco didn’t get a wink of sleep, he looked around sluggishly, forgetting for a moment that he wasn’t in the burgundy bedroom at the Grimmauld place. Narcissa was still in her bed, wand clutched tightly in her slender fingers.
“I will wait for you at the Leaky, Ron,” Harry said, making his exit."If you see Kawahara, ask her to go too, okay?"
“Janus Thickey,” Kevin replied instantly, “Poor sod, he’s not the first from DMLE to get his brains fried up with the Imperius… But at least I heard they managed to restore some of his memories.”
“You have 24 hours, Malfoy,” Amanda warned him and then threw something towards him. “I will find you. And if you a smart lad you will not tell about any of this to Mr. Potter.”
“Why are you doing this?” Harry demanded, “Who’s making you?... If it is Yaxley… You need to realize that he is going to kill you too afterward…”
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy, I trust you can find the piano room yourself. I’ll call them soon,” the lady agreed and disappeared at the end of the corridor.
Ito (伊藤), his given name Ken (研) means "study" or "research", which would be fitting for a potion-master.
“I missed you so much,” he heard Draco whisper into his neck, his lips touching his skin on every syllable and that sounded like a declaration of love to him.
“Don’t say anything… just let it be…” Draco whispered and leaned down for one more kiss before the other boy realizes what they had just done and runs away.
“So you’re not going to call me a drug addict and try to drag me to St. Mungo’s rehab anymore?” he smirked bitterly.
He was surrounded by the disarray that reconstruction of the house entailed, there were heaps of rubbish in the corners, old wallpaper hanging from the walls like loose skin and there were too many muggle supplies: buckets of paint, wood planks and electric tools in the bright orange cases. Whatever the late Walburga Black imagined the freaks and mudbloods had done to the house, it was way worse.
“I knew my daughter was an Auror and I knew that she wasn’t loyal to my cause! But why was she killed, it couldn’t have been anyone of my people! They don’t spill pure blood!” Yaxley shouted.
“Of course…” Harry sighed, “Do you mind helping me a little, I must have dislocated my shoulder a bit.”
“I shall be announcing my son’s eulogy...” Mrs. Malfoy spoke to him quietly, “If you have anything to add, Mr. Potter, you are more than welcome.”
“Draco made it,” Harry commented, twirling the ornate glass turtle doves he had received from Bill and Fleur as a gift in his hands. They had probably hoped that those would represent Ginny and him.
“Potter and Granger know too. Even if you shut me up, they will not let it slide!” the Slytherin said triumphantly.
“It’s fine now, I was a bigger berk there…” Harry patted her back, comfortingly, “I knew about your parents, and still did this…”
Harry felt extremely uncomfortable sitting next to a woman, whose son was presumably dead, not to mention his lover. And judging from the way Andromeda had been talking about the whole ordeal of two of the Malfoys living under her roof, Narcissa knew about the nature of his and Draco's relationship. She didn’t say much after that, just sat there motionless almost like those life-size wax figures at the Madame Tussaud’s, performing her role of a grieving mother.
“Are you sure it’s you though?” Elise hummed and took another drag out of her Marlboro, letting out a cloud of thick smoke into the car.
“Fine, come in,” Megumi huffed and showed him the way into her bedroom. “Ootani-kun, daijoubu da wa! Koitsu wa homo nanda*,” she explained to the bodyguard who was about to interfere.
Homo - in Japanese means f*g and is used in the derogatory sense that is why I am putting it in the translation as it supposed to be
Nobody paid him any mind, since most of the people in their squad were from the same year in Hogwarts. And they were not too thrilled to be facing their former classmates on the other side of barricades.
I used Liszt's arrangement of Saint-Saens' Danse Macabre that Draco was playing, you can listen to it on YouTube
Draco mowed towards it, holding his breath in anticipation of some inevitable danger coming from that part of the building. The spell was shining the strongest at the entrance to the headmistress office. And the knot in his stomach twisted even harder as he realized that the woman must have done something to Harry and probably Millie and Martha as well.
“A team of Obliviators was sent to the place, all the memories that were not the original recollections of the pupils were erased. Some of them are ready to return to their original families. The eyewitness elf was freed by the mistress and is now employed at Hogwarts’ kitchens and as for the headmistress herself… She will receive counseling at St Mungo’s as per her deal agreement,” Shacklebolt’s voice was cold and uninvolved like he was reciting some boring clauses in the document and not talking about real people.
The bullet grazed Weasley's arm, and he cried out in pain, clutching at the bleeding wound. His eyes widened almost comically. He was looking at someone behind Draco who made that shot. There was a low growl of an animal and a white wolf leaped and attacked Weasley, pinning him to the ground with two mighty paws.
Draco gave her a lopsided grin. Having to exist in her body for a long time made him reevaluate how he thought about Megumi. He somewhat understood how vulnerable she felt some times. At least Draco had the advantage of knowing a few dozen dark spells and curses. She, on the other hand, was raised in the muggle family and was actively discouraged from using magic. Naturally, she would feel inadequate in the world, where her father's shady business had an influence on every single aspect of her life.
He saw Harry’s Adam's apple bob as he emptied one vial after another. His hand was itching to snatch one of those away and down it himself.
He still saw grainy Malfoy’s face everywhere, an attractive smile on his face, bowing on the stage, followed by his mugshot from DMLE exhausted vacant eyes and withered complexion. The next picture made a flush creep upon his cheeks and neck - they were standing close together: the Slytherin smirking and taking a drag on his cigarette, Harry laughing at something and looking a bit smitten. The image was disturbingly honest, and he wanted to incinerate every single copy of it. The git was notably missing from the Slytherin table and Harry thanked Merlin from small mercies.
His supposed colleague had just shot him with a muggle gun and her enormous pet attacked him. Draco could bet that was something Weasley wouldn't have predicted.
“By doing absolutely fucking nothing!” the blonde smirked bitterly, letting go of his embrace abruptly.
Draco waited for her at the platform 9 and three quarters until almost every student boarded the Hogwarts Express. Nobody showed up.
“I know Ron… I just need to look for the cellars. The construction company should be done this weekend.” although Harry understood Hermione’s need to reconnect with her Obliviated parents, he felt as though everyone was leaving him this summer.
It is done, a work of almost a year is finished. I am excited about the sequel and hopefully start publishing it soon. I am very grateful for all the attention this fanfic received and that so many of you have read it. Thank you all for making it until the end!
The dish of biscuits fell to the floor, breaking into little shards of porcelain, Proudfoot was lying on the floor in a stupor and Oliver Williamson stood up pointing his wand at the Malfoys.
They stayed there unable to speak, unable to move, their breaths mingling and their eyes burning with desire. And then Harry moved closer, kissing those thin lips and it felt like the first kiss he ever had, uncertain and intoxicating and beautiful. Something wild was awoken by the feeling of Draco’s mouth on his and he wanted to dive into that passion and never resurface.
There was an argument in the corridor and then Kevin, his young attractive nurse, burst into the waiting room followed by two determined-looking uniformed Aurors.
“We had a strict no legilimency policy,” Amanda laughed, pointing at a well-read paperback of “Living With Legilimens” on top of the pile, “But she tried boy, did she try. Legilimens just can’t stop snooping around, can they?”
The dining hall of  St. Barbara’s Orphanage for Victims of War was starting to fill with people. Children from magical families who had lost their parents were wearing handmade costumes and simple glamours that their teachers helped them to charm. A lot of them were only five or six years old. They jumped around so excitedly that wayward magic was seeping from them making the gaslight lamps flicker on and off and random objects start floating and then suddenly fall to the ground.
The passenger door opened and a dark-haired lad exited a vehicle. He propped himself onto the bonnet and stretched his legs leisurely. Next to him, a blonde youth was standing, a lit cigarette in his hands and a pensive expression on his face.
“Hey! Stop that, you idiot! Don’t listen to her!” Draco tried to pry her fingers away but the girl couldn’t hear his voice, she was trying her best to finish herself off.
Draco woke up sometime during the night, he felt too hot and smothered by a heap of covers thrown over him. He saw Potter’s head slumped on the sofa beside him, the idiot was dozing off in a sitting position, crouched on the floor, still wearing the same sweater from last night. Was he really there watching over him? The Slytherin realized that he was naked from the waist up and belatedly noticed a new change of clothes put on top of the blankets. He suspected that this place was an old Black residence, modernized and made to look like an exceptionally dull muggle house. The furniture and magical objects were still there but there was a muggle screen, a telephone, and electric lamps everywhere. He could say that it looked cozy and the creepy atmosphere that a lot of wizarding houses possessed was gone and replaced by that strange wizarding and muggle blend that was Potter himself.
He was not even shocked to hear that. The girl was probably using some sort of reverse psychology on him to make him resolve his sexuality crisis when she constantly talked about sorting things out with Ginny. Harry thanked Merlin and whatever gods existed out there that his friends were supportive even in this ridiculous situation with Malfoy.
Draco had heard about muggle cinemas from Pansy, but he had never been to one. And although he enjoyed a record or two of muggle jazz or swing. The pure-blood wizards preferred watching the plays and listening to the classical music to such plebeian entertainment as films.
“What do you want now?! Why get Kevin involved?! Let him go… if you want to have your vengeance. It is me you should only deal with!” Harry pleaded.
There was a notice on the door written in all caps on the orange paper declaring one should not have sexual intercourse inside the training facilities. And Harry wondered who was that weird person that would do such a thing.
Harry also enjoyed the singing, although his gaze kept following the blonde pianist. He was accompanying the singer with his eyes slightly closed, and a content smile on his face. His fingers were gently touching the keys as though caressing them. There was something about him that Harry knew, that he longed for all this time. He couldn't take his eyes from him, from the way he swayed in the rhythm of the music. And then for an instant he could see behind the glamor spell that shimmered on the pianist's face. It was him. Undoubtedly. It was Draco Malfoy sitting at the grand piano.
… Somebody was splashing in the water next to him, somebody’s hands were painfully gripping his unresponsive limbs and dragging him out of the water. Somebody’s lips were on his, warm and human, breathing life into his shivering body.
They lied tangled together after that, too tired to move, lips touching leisurely and hands caressing sweaty skin.
“You should be careful next time you decide to do potions with Malfoy... People will talk!” she warned him.
These words made an uncomfortable feeling of doubt rise in Harry’s chest. Was his friend actually encouraging to choose between his school sweetheart, the sister of his best friend, a perfect, uncomplicated future, and his former nemesis turned what… friend with benefits?... fuck-buddy?
... Harry heard a rustle of material and then something warm and heavy covered his shivering body... he must have fallen asleep somewhere in the castle... Long fingers were stroking his hair… the surrounding air smelled of menthol cigarettes and citrus aftershave…
The orchids and bright tropical bushes changed to huge flesh-eating plants that emitted rancid stench of rotten flesh to lure their prey, and then Harry noticed very familiar wrinkly heads of Mandrakes and deadly spikes of Fanged Geranium and it wasn’t a simple muggle botanic garden anymore. He couldn’t believe that there was a magical section to this greenhouse, smack in the middle of muggle London and he wondered if some unlucky visitor ever got themselves maimed or eaten by one of these monstrosities.
He was enveloped by the warm arms, the sweet smell of caramel, bitter herbal scent of medicinal potions, and the strange chemical blend of muggle shampoo reassuring him and making the chill of the night terror ebb away. He never thought that it would feel so nice to be comforted by someone he’d grown to care about so much.
He couldn’t recall what happened yesterday after his falling out with Ginny, perhaps he got that hammered.
He felt dizzy, his head was painfully heavy and there was a knot in his throat that was slowly preventing him from breathing normally.
“Miss, the Malfoy kid is here,” another person said and the door to the room opened. Draco saw the priest tied to the leather chair and the vampire and the agent standing next to him, wands pointing at the man’s scowling face.
It was so surreal: one could clearly see the smooth stretch of wet glistening tarmac but it was impossible to tell where the motorway was taking them.
She picked up that muggle book, leafing through countless relaxed pages that he had read, a sad smile on her lips, “Vigilante justice is not the way to go.”
They passed the Whitechapel and were nearing the old abandoned wizarding neighborhood, where the orphanage was located. Before the Dark Lord’s terror on the magical and muggle population alike, many wizards preferred living close together in those charmed Victorian and Edwardian townhouses. But as random murders and disappearances and muggle-born purges became a common thing, those streets were forgotten and houses left behind, the wealthier hiding away in their country estates. The only building that survived was St. Barbara’s Orphanage, it was probably protected by very powerful pure-blood magic, judging by the sign of Salazar Slytherin on the door.
The world was gray and white, or maybe that was what Draco saw every day that he spent in custody. He had been there for two weeks without any news, anything at all. Whatever information he could provide to the wary looking Auror wasn’t sufficient enough to let him go. They believed he wanted to kill Potter and since all the spells that he had cast were done with Harry’s wand there was no proof that it wasn’t the case.
“How much longer?! I am really craving some greasy muggle delivery,” Ron groaned, leafing through the stash of take-out menus that had accumulated over the summer of renovations.
“It’s him!” Narcissa yelled to her, “Keep playing!” she ordered to the organist and the ethereal melody started again, making Harry stop in the middle of the wand fight.
“Your loyalties are misplaced here, Granger. If you knew what I know you would join me in cursing him,” he continued still pointing his wand straight at Hermione.
“Pibsy, you’re going to have to go with us,” Draco nodded to the elf, “Harry will keep you safe, don’t worry!”
His eyes darted wildly over the burgundy and gold upholstery, comforting and familiar. The smell of lavender on his bedsheets, the crackle of the burning wood from the furnace, and light snoring coming from Ron’s bed were meant to lull him back to sleep. And yet he couldn’t even close his eyes. In the morning he had to attend the funeral, Draco’s funeral.
“How long do you reckon it’ll take?” Harry asked, distractedly. Since when did Malfoy become so handsy with him? They were just mates now and he treated him like he was…
His best friend had bitterly reminded him of the remainder of the Christmas Eve at the Burrow and him running into the living room, making everyone jump out of their seats and demanding to drop everything and go rescue Malfoy. It was definitely not one of his proudest moments however after seeing that bloody Patronus Harry forgot about everything, anxious feeling of desperation overpowering him.
Come back?! After all the bridges he had burned, all the lies he had told to weasel away from Yaxley and the DMLE. And Harry… Would Draco even be able to look him in the eye after making him believe he was dead?
“Do you reckon there are any films left?” Harry asked and climbed the rickety stairs to the projector room.
“That you fancied him… I should have known something was weird when you went on about saving him from Azkaban…” she said quietly.
She was great at leading the meeting and had a word of encouragement for everyone who attended. Harry understood that it took her a lot of courage to advocate for the rights of lycanthropes.
So far he had managed to fib his way into the DMLE and be next to Harry. He had promised unattainable to Gareth Greengrass in exchange for a new identity. Because of the chief Unspeakable, Megumi Kawahara existed in the Auror Office as Potter’s partner. And as long as Draco had enough Polyjuice potion, she would continue to be there, watching Harry’s back and simultaneously spying on the Minister’s Undersecretary.
He could hear that distant melody he had always imagined when he needed to dissociate. He followed the sound and soon there was no cinema around them, only silent pleasant darkness…
“Harry, I know it’s hard but you need to move…” the blonde pleaded. He looked around to see if anyone noticed that the devices weren’t working.
“They will take care of you here, Elise… And then next year you will be coming to Hogwarts like you wanted…” the Auror smiles.
Harry chuckled a bit and tried sitting up but he had little strength left in him. He let out a defeated breath and settled back onto the pillow.
There was something different in their dynamic. Harry could not explain it at first but his need to be in charge this time was evident and somehow Draco was letting him take control. He was there, spread beneath him, scarred chest rising and falling with every laborious breath he took, looking stunningly beautiful.
“I dunno, it’s just that you keep disappearing all the time and the thing with Savage and the patrol… You saved my arse there even if you didn’t have to… I keep wondering why you’re doing all of it...” Harry trailed off, not being able to put his frustration into words properly. He couldn’t just ask her whether she knew that he was a lycanthrope.
The Gryffindor wanted to say something back, to put enough venom in his insult to hurt him just as much. But he knew that was the plain and simple truth. The truth that he desperately was trying to conceal, to run away from.
“Brilliant, just bloody brilliant! So now I have to just sit and watch him being treated like a fugitive by the Ministry?!” Harry was refusing to listen to any of their advice at that moment.
He was a Slytherin, he realized that sometimes there things that could be overlooked. That is how his father managed to keep his high status and a prestigious position at the Ministry for so long. But that was Shacklebolt, a war hero, a person who fought tooth and nail with the corrupt bureaucrats he inherited after he was appointed the Acting Minister. And now he was willing to turn a blind eye on such a crime. For what? Some fucked up greater good motive?
He couldn’t care less what would happen to Malfoy senior but somehow knowing that Draco or his mother could end up in Azkaban after everything that they’d gone through just wasn’t fair. Harry unsuccessfully tried to convey this message to Ginny a couple of times and ended up drowning his sorrows at the Leaky Cauldron into the small hours. One day he came home only to find the empty chest of drawers and an angry note on the kitchen table. He simply turned around and headed back outside and sat on the bench in the muggle park until the sunset. Thus, his teenage romance had ended in bitterness and tears and constant misunderstandings and relentless headache. That was another of Harry’s familiar companions.
Draco would meet with Andromeda, who volunteered at the library from time to time. She had even agreed to fake his mother’s signature for the Painless Poppy Philtre he had to take after especially nasty rows with his ill-wishers. The potion was highly addictive but it left him feeling boneless and lightheaded and soon he would use it even when he wasn’t in pain.
“Those were children! Orphans! Who don’t have anyone to stand up for them, Ron!” Harry yelled back not caring that another child was sleeping now far away.
Harry understood that he must have looked utterly mad to them, even more than usual. But who could blame him? One day he was seeping with rage at how unfair Malfoy had been for leaving, as Hermione was trying to drag him through the streets of Hogsmeade towards the castle, and the next day he was summoned to McGonagall’s office to receive the dreadful news about the traffic collision. And ever since then Harry never stopped searching for the truth. He simply couldn’t believe that as skillful a wizard as Draco managed to get himself killed in a simple car accident. His obsession took over whatever feelings of loss and grief he might have had, only constant night terrors reminded him about it. About how much he missed Malfoy.
