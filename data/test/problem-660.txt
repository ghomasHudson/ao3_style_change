"I can only see you."
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armour. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armour. The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
Hagrid shuffled off.
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want... whatever we want..."
"You can't-"
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.
"There, look!"
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes.
"Do you think this mirror shows the future?"
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.
"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see what it was standing on.
"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get into bed."
"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!"
Harry left after that, It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore wasn't being quite truthful... He had noticed that Dumbledore became solemn while answering. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.
"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?"
"I-I don't know what you
"Shut up, Peeves-- please-- you'll get us thrown out."
"Want to play chess, Harry?" asked Ron.
"I'd take you on anytime on my own," muttered Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
"Don't," Harry advised her.
"Make yerselves at home," Hagrid spoke, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
Sorry this took longer than expected!
"Jordan, I'm warning you-"
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.
Draco quickly turned his eyes away from the Gryffindor and busied himself with pouring a glass of pumpkin juice.
At last she found what she was looking for.
"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" asked Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. "It must've cost you a fortune."
"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
"Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. "This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better."
"I almost told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this."
It looked more like the thing was cursed.
Not that it was hard to do, Draco supposed. Potter really was horrid at Wizard's Chess.
He took out the Parchment and wrote.
Actually, Harry wasn't quite sure if he was shivering because of the cold or because of the thought of submerging himself in that lake. With killer mermaids and who knows what else. He wasn't very assured that the professors would be able to make it in a time should a mermaid decide to claw his face off at the bottom of the lake.
(He cries during that one. He talks and talks and talks, until he realizes he’s crying and his voice isn’t coming out anymore, and he doesn’t get to finish, but Draco already knows the ending anyway.)
The wait was horrible.
"My father told me about it when I visited Hogwarts. That Fudge's probably pretending that he's got everything under control." Then, a certain detail caught his attention. "You've been reading the Daily Prophet? How does the Daily Prophet get delivered here?"
"You realize that I can't do much for you," Madame Pomfrey continued. "The Lip-Lock Jinx can only be removed by the caster, or if you fulfill the requirements expected of you." Here, her lips curled up slightly in amusement.
“Well, it’s one of the places that isn’t shown on the Map, so I took a hunch.”
In his other dreams, there would be green bursts of light from drawn wands, a shout of
“Okay. After dinner.”
” he blurted out, completely forgetting his manners and ogling.
Remus gave him a look of betrayal. "Sirius!"
not with Goyle in Azkaban is because of Potter.
Trust Potter to equate dinner with treacle tart.
Once upon a time, Hermione had punched Malfoy in the face for his bigotry and self-centeredness. Now, Malfoy was staring him down, telling him he wasn’t allowed to off himself for the greater good. It was a funny thought, funny enough that it pierced through his melancholy and tilted his lips up into a wry smile.
Snape scowled. “Why now? You’ve left the boy in their care for six years.”
He probably went back five months but the Time Turner was broken and blood that wasn't his was on his hands and the image of Draco's pale, terrified face in the darkness was burned behind his eyelids and he
But once the haze cleared, the reality of the situation dawned on him.
to see that avoiding the problem doesn’t really fix it, kind of makes it bigger and more daunting, and that yes, the war’s over, but that doesn’t mean that everything’s okay.
When Draco spoke again, Harry almost jumped out of his skin in shock.
He was so busy window shopping that he nearly tripped over the cat as it suddenly halted into a stop. He looked down, amused when the cat let out a big, silent yawn.
As if it hadn’t had enough adventure yesterday in Diagon Alley.
, he scribbled hastily, face ashen.

“My mother’s name is Lily,” said Harry because he didn’t know what to reply to what Draco had just said.
He was certainly not about to
Remus elbowed him slightly. “You’re actually older than me or have you turned senile and forgotten?”
And sometimes, Draco talks about
Another stretch of silence and then…
"Potter, would you like to join me for drinks later?"
"Harry," Draco whispered.
overreact.
Harry propped himself up on one elbow in an effort to sit up and groaned at the protest his back made. "Never tried to be much of a swimmer before," he muttered, but forced his body to move anyway.
Draco snapped his head to look at Severus.
Three weeks after Draco was released from Azkaban, Harry enters his room and peers at the food on the table. “What’s for breakfast today?”
The chuckle is out of his lips before he can stop it. Stupid Potter. Stupid, annoying Potter who doesn’t know when to give up. The little bugger just has to save everyone, even those that don’t deserve it. “I’m mad, Potter.”
Draco was stunned.
"I mean," he continued. "You seemed to need it pretty badly."
Eyelids slowly fluttered closed.
With a pointed flick, Malfoy said, “Finite Incantatem!”
The snarl on Snape’s face didn’t lessen in vehemence.
"Do you not have any plans at all to break that spell?" Lavender asked exasperatedly.
Harry took a deep breath.
“I forgot that you… I’m sor…” Draco cringed and took another deep breath. “I mean, about your skin…” he trailed off, making vague motions with his hand towards Harry’s arms that were wound around his own knees.
, right?"
It hurts, to see Draco Malfoy so defeated. Once upon a time, Harry thinks he would have relished seeing Draco like this, atoning for everything that he did.
"He bit me," Draco continued on, feeling like it was an important thing to talk about. It
He wondered if it was rude to show such relief in front of Severus, who everyone knew had Harry Potter as his charge, but right now, he couldn't bring himself to care.
And amidst the few, shocked gasps, Harry heard the blood rushing in his ears.
Ron, who was not able to read what Harry had written on the Self-Erasing Parchment, perked up at the use of Malfoy's first name and – well, Malfoy in general. He was up on both feet and immediately by their side.
Draco had been informed that this mission was a special one. Understandably so, as with all missions involving anything about the Dark Lord. In all these missions, Potter was always assigned as the commanding officer. In this mission, Potter wasn’t his
The way Potter’s face darkens at the message warms him from the inside. It’s fucked up, but he likes knowing that he can affect Potter like this.
The alarm bells got louder.
“I expect your plate to be licked clean,” the man said calmly after the scary face disappeared.
Ron stared at the cat.
His room was flawless. Even his mattress was as soft as his own back in Malfoy Manor.
He closes his eyes, has to look away for a while. When he opens them, Narcissa is watching him carefully, and Harry speaks, just as careful, “May I stay until then?”
Harry's nose scrunched up in confusion. "Is that a Jigsnargle because once you get those critters to sing Cristina Warbeck, they're not gonna stop."
Harry beams at him.
Draco peered closely at Harry’s panicked eyes. “Do you feel like sucking my blood
about him.
"I didn't ask for the gillyweed either, you git," Potter muttered, but said, "Only if you teach me the Wronski Feint."
Ginny sighed exasperatedly. She looked crestfallen. "
Him and…
"You look like shite, Potter," he commented airily, placing the book on the table in front of him, opened somewhere in the middle so that it didn't look like he'd been stuck on page one for the past half hour. He turned to Harry and made a show of raking his eyes disapprovingly down Harry's form. "Not that it surprises me anymore, really, because you've always looked like –"
Potter was also a terrible example of a Slytherin, no ounce of self-preservation in his body, even though he had all the fame to abuse and the fear from other people to take advantage of.
It was
Professor Albus Dumbledore looked down upon them, a delighted smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eyes. “It’s not every day that I get visitors in this room.”
And weren’t the ones who had to wonder if he could ask a friend to point their wand at him.
He grunted and tried to shrug the weight off his side.
can't ask him. It would be too obvious!"
After getting the Dark Mark.
Harry drops his wrist, shaking his head. He glares back, scowling. “Merlin, Malfoy, what’s gotten into you? I just wanted to ask how you’re doing.”
Also, I've always disliked the way Rowling portrayed the Slytherins, she originally described Pansy as 'hard-faced' but I've always imagined Pansy to be a Goth Queen™ and actually really pretty- a bit like Blaise Zabini's infamous man-killer mum lol.
"And it's really none of your business," said Harry.
"Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That's er..."
He heard the whistle blow and cheered along with the rest of his house, waving a small green and silver flag that had been given to him by a prefect earlier that day. He watched as fifteen brooms rose up into the air and the game began- he stared through his binoculars at the players above.
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron. "It'd be safe to ask them."
"Never-- in all my time at Hogwarts--"
"What should we do?"
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.
"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?"
"Will you stop saying the name!" Ron hissed.
"But he seemed to really hate me."
"So- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating-"
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
"It is! Look down!"
"Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, "-how dare you- might have broken your neck--"
"Wish McGonagall favoured us..." muttered Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:
', the note had said.
"Leave it to me."
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
"I'm going with the first option." Draco chimed in, then he shushed them as the game resumed.
A second, very small parcel contained a note.
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.
that Malfoy didn’t need to know to fulfill the assignment, and yet Harry still found himself wanting to share them. It only seemed fair, after all, to tell him exactly what they’ve been asking him to do.
A screeching roar echoed throughout the arena, making Harry clamp his hands on his ears and grit his teeth.
“Of course,” he said, before narrowing his eyes towards Harry’s kitchen. “You’re going to have to bring that red wine from the Inquisition Era though, because I will not allow myself to drown in commoner’s beer during that commoner’s party.”
–" He spat the word with disgust. "– job, you're going to have to owe me ten times now."
and figures falling to the ground with heavy thuds, but all Harry could see was Draco, covered in blood, again,
"You should tell them you like blokes," Ginny said helpfully. "I think the blokes are less likely to molest you."
Harry gave a soundless laugh, the tension easing away from his body until Draco felt rather smug and very satisfied with himself.
, Harry has told us the effects of the spell-casting on you.”
And, speak of the devil, the doors to the Minister’s Office burst open, magic just barely keeping it from bouncing off the wall on one side and off Rosmerta’s desk on the other. Harry Potter, still in his Auror’s robes, stomped out, eyebrows furrowed, and lips curled down into an obviously dissatisfied line.
Salazar Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets was, of course, filled with snakes.
“No, I think he’d be more comfortable with less people.” He looks behind his shoulder and offers an assuring grin. “Next time?”
It was hard not to be.
There is a look of shock on Draco’s face, as if he hadn’t expected Harry to get so angry like that, but Harry doesn’t care anymore. If Draco wants to be a git, then fine.
Harry hugged him back, and that, Remus supposed, was probably what made Sirius start crying for real.
With a sob, he yanked open Draco's collar.
He thinks Weasley and Granger don’t like it, too, but they don’t say anything; they just watch Potter with wary eyes and resigned sighs and it makes the back of Draco’s neck itch. Sometimes, they even greet Draco good morning, too.
Harry and Ron shared greatly alarmed looks. Hermione putting her quill down can't be good.
Ginny waited for the words to disappear on the parchment patiently.
Potter’s voice is near his ear and it’s soft. “You can ask me for help.”
Draco almost dropped the book on the table, barely managing to save it from making a loud noise that would surely attract Madame Pince and ruin their hiding place. (Not that it was actually hidden.)
It should be the other way around. Stupid Potter, did he think he was
“No, Malfoy, I’m just here to eat your pancakes.”
This was going to be his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
to happen, people don’t get out of Azkaban in the right state of mind, or
“What does it matter to us? Our names aren’t in there,” Harry replied but he started to gather his things as well.
Right now, he was quiet, fortunate enough to be under the peace of sleep, but Harry knew that it would only be a few more hours before Voldemort’s magic would come and make him scream and cry again.
When he returns, completely returns, Potter’s sitting on his bed, still holding his hand, and looking straight at him.
Harry couldn't resist.
“Of course,” Draco replied, before a mischievous glint appeared in his eyes and he smirked at Harry. “Among other things.”
“You’re gonna have to help me up, Potter. I can’t feel my legs anymore.”
Malfoy met his gaze head-on. “If you and your Hufflepuff hide
"Ah, yes," Remus admitted, chuckling sheepishly. "We're in constant correspondence, actually."
The idea was starting to form in Draco's head. He tried to stop it. He could feel the color slowly draining from his face.
Harry thought the same. He pulled his Auror’s robes closer to his body to keep the November air of Scotland from seeping into the rest of his clothes. They had Apparated to the nearest possible point outside of the school grounds, almost near Hogsmeade, and had made the rest of the way on foot.
"Such insolence, I ought to give
As soon as the words slipped past his lips, he immediately knew what a mistake they were.
Potter looked at him, affronted. “I will not!”
Maybe this was a sign from Merlin that he should finally let go of those childish thoughts.
“For you to eat it, of course.” Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes. He’s starting to think that all of Draco’s bravado is just a ploy to hide how truly bashful he is. Bashful and Draco Malfoy. Now that’s something that doesn’t go together. “I also swiped some treacle tart from the kitchen.”
But then Draco had to go and ask.
Well. Potter wasn’t in the mood for jokes then.
Harry stumbled into his flat later well after midnight with his head hurting all over. It didn’t matter though because he was still pretty much floating in the clouds after everything that happened that day.
He stared at the Parchment, at Draco's curving handwriting, and wanted to give something of himself in return.
“Huh,” Hermione comments one fine weekend morning.
He strained against the ropes, felt its burn as it chafed his skin, but could only grit his teeth and clench his jaw when the knife pierced the skin of his arm. The blood dripping down his hand felt hot.
Malfoy looked surprised at the compliment, and then rather awkward.
He looks at Draco then, and isn’t prepared for the shame that’s evident on his face.
“Get out! Right now! OUT!”
Harry was gobsmacked.
“So,” Draco started, when they were already done with their main course and were just starting on their dessert. “How many horcruxes in total were there again?”
Snape could feel a snarl threaten to take up his face.
Harry shoves more pancakes in his mouth, just to save him the awkwardness of talking. He nods while chewing.
Leaning heavily on the fence, he wiped away the sweat on his face using his sleeve, noting belatedly that his hand was shaking.
Then, realizing that the source was just Harry, glared reproachfully at him.
He told himself.
But still, nothing happened.
It took him a long time to even trust
"I'll have you know, Potter, I don't want you going around thinking that
He’s not really hungry anymore. In fact, he’s fucking
He wandlessly and distractedly Accio-ed the container of owl treats and set it in front of Errol as he started to read Hermione's neat script inviting him to a small Christmas get-together at their house that upcoming Sunday.
Harry squeaked out, looking at him in amazement. Then, with a guilty shift of his eyes, procured the pencil from behind him. “I found this. I’m sorry I hid it,” he mumbled miserably.
"Why…" Oh, there it was. The slight dizziness. But it was okay. It was bearable. Draco closed his eyes and inhaled slowly. When he opened his eyes, he looked at the door instead. "Why didn't you just take it from me while I was asleep?"
Harry blinked.
In a flash, they were both off the balcony and back up in the air, their laughter and light taunts echoing in the wind.
Draco stared at the parchment, then it was like all the worries in his face had disappeared and he let out a breath of relief. He looked at Harry. "Thank you," he breathed out.
But whatever that was, it was instantly healed when Harry looked at him disbelievingly and exclaimed, “But you’ve already taken care of me best!”
Heads peek from compartment windows and students whisper as he passes, but Harry’s thankful that nobody attacks him and demands for an autograph. He thinks that maybe his three months out of the public eye have done wonders for his image: Golden Boy’s not really interested in rubbing elbows, just wants to live in peace, try again next year.
"Oh, don't think like that, Harry," Ginny said nonchalantly, waving whatever thoughts that Harry was presumably having with a scoff. "I'm trying to help here."
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.
"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute."
"Don't push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty."
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.
"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying-"
"I'd like to see your mum and dad," Ron said eagerly.
Draco didn't think Potter had faked what had happened on the Quidditch pitch. He didn't think the broomstick malfunctioned either- he'd read all about every single broomstick to date and it was physically impossible for one to do such a thing anymore... No, Potter's broomstick didn't malfunction.
"Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it, Potter!"
"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.
Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Philosopher's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
"What?" She asked reproachfully. "I don't like him, but you can't deny that Potter's good."
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.
"That's your problem, isn't it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. "Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?"
The commentary was being done by a Gryffindor boy- Draco never really cared to know his name, but he knew that he was friends with the Weasley twins, and that was enough said there.
"Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."
They fell backward- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
"I suppose I'm being dragged into this, too?" Draco asked with an air of boredom- he didn't much like the fact that Pansy was taking control of the situation, but he rather liked the idea of spying.
Harry heard Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
"I- I didn't see you, sir."
"Did you see his face?"
"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please."
"HARRY POTTER!"
"You are not."
"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped a beat and He felt a little braver.
Malfoy looked a little taken aback for a second, but then grinned nastily.
"See?" Harry whispered.
"It looks like its malfunctioning- But a broomstick hasn't malfunctioned since the shooting stars-" Pansy added. Draco clenched his jaw, unable to take his eyes away from Potter. Sure, he hated him- but he didn't want the bloody git to die.
"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?"
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.
"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic."
He doesn’t know why it feels like he has just been caught doing something he isn’t supposed to do. He just feels that Draco’s gotten it all wrong somehow. Why that matters, he doesn’t know either, because Draco and Astoria are probably going out, so he doesn’t know why he feels the need to explain himself.
The only ones present to send him off are Narcissa Malfoy and Harry himself after all.
Harry hurried along, not very eager to meet those Blast-Ended Skrewts he was talking about.
True enough, sparkling and floating innocently above them was a mistletoe.
out loud after more than half a month, but no, no, it wasn't.
“It’s alright, Harry,” he comforted, reaching out to ruffle the boy’s hair. “It must have surprised you to see a pencil in this old house.”
From time to time, Severus would bring Draco with him to Hogwarts to meet with his parents. Draco looked forward to these meetings religiously, even as the reality that they didn't have the Malfoy Manor anymore would sink in the most during these times.
Draco pulled back and grinned boyishly at him. “Malfoy Manor was boring as hell after our adventures in Severus’ house. I had to
“Hmm, that’s true. And Snape wouldn’t have known whether to dock House points from me or give me more.”
gasped Petunia Dursley. Her eyes were wide with panic and Snape saw her fingers on the doorframe start to tremble. She narrowed the opening of the door, looking behind her once with an expression of fear, before turning back to Snape with a pleading look. “You’re here to take him, aren’t you?”
"You passed out. Harry drank your blood and was righted in no time." Severus paused, making sure that Draco turned to look at him in question, before saying, "You did a very brave thing, Draco."
Malfoy doesn’t raise his head or even turn to look at him. He’s staring at the floor, eyes vacant, with only the rise and fall of his chest the indication that he’s still alive.
Harry was good at this, good at keeping things civil enough – not too friendly but also not awkward. They lived in the same dorm, had the same classes, attended the same fancy parties that Snape forced him to go to every summer, and had the same circle of 'friends'. He convinced himself each and every time that he was satisfied with this.
Silence.
Malfoy met his eyes, and Harry grounded himself with that—in those gray eyes staring back at him, in the hot and steady grip of Malfoy’s hands on his shoulders.
–“ It was with years of practicing holding his tongue in front of Albus Dumbledore that he successfully managed not to spit the word
and hurried to the Great Hall when he found out that it was time for dinner.
The words made his eyes widen and his breath stutter. Harry wondered how many days Malfoy had to tell himself the exact same lines, stubbornly fighting against society and his own demons to go through each and every day.
After devouring that disgustingly sweet treacle tart, Draco marched up to Severus' room. It was more of a laboratory than a room, with all the scattered parchment and bottles of dubious animal body parts lying around the room. An area of the room was even cleared to make way for a boiling cauldron.
“His potion against the sun,” he said, holding the black suitcase up between his thumb and forefinger. “Give it to him on days that he wishes to go out. And –“ He held the brown suitcase up this time. “Your Wolfsbane potion.”
"I also gave you my blood after," Draco muttered.
With a sigh, he rubbed his temples, trying to recall what happened the past few hours. Apparently, he had been unconscious for two hours. The nurse cleared him, finding nothing remarkable about his health, save for his throbbing headache which was usual of victims of Crucio.
Potter’s face flushed with indignance. “I did not—”
Harry nodded.
"I…" Draco started, before cutting himself off. He was surprised to realize that his mouth was suddenly dry. He reached for his goblet of water. "Nagini poisoned me."
Hedges twenty feet high built up the Maze, and a huge gap in the maze made up its entrance. The contents of the Maze were hidden by a dark shroud, and Harry found himself not wanting to go in it.
Harry choked on his own saliva, which was better than spluttering, because etiquette said that one does not splutter when dancing with a lady whose face is just a few inches away from yours. He didn't want to think about Draco and snogging. "Pansy!"
Draco wasn't surprised. He was a pure-blood after all. He already guessed that it was probably Potter that she was raving on about.
For a moment, Harry was scared that Draco wasn't going to talk to him. After all, the boy had barely spoken to him since the school year started except for the seemingly forced and quiet "Morning, Potter." whenever it was inevitable.
“But it got better, didn’t it? It became less frequent the last few times I went to the Manor.”
In one graceful swoop, he grabbed the golden egg from the cluster and flew back towards the sky.
Potter pulls him close, too close, and throws the Cloak around both of their shoulders. It’s a tight fit around two grown men, but Potter keeps him close and Draco doesn’t move away.
Harry bursts into laughter.
He just wanted to be able to keep it in his pocket at all times and feel its weight – a reminder that he
Thankfully, they weren't joined at the hip and went through their careers independently. Hermione established herself a respectable position in society as a renowned and distinguished Acquitor for House Elves and Other Creatures, and Ron became the youngest Auror to also become an Animagi Instructor ever.
Harry raised an eyebrow. He reached for the Self-Erasing Parchment.
He stepped into the Slytherin Common Room, not at all surprised that it was devoid of students. They were probably outside now, clamouring to get good seats in the arena. The only ones left who were waiting for him were his fellow fourth years.
“Potter.”
“I know. But I wanted to save you.”
Draco rolled his eyes exasperatedly. "And you can't just go and snog this girl because?"
That wasn’t the grip of someone who wanted to serve Voldemort.
He stood up, met Draco's bewildered eyes and looked almost desperately in it.
He smiled to himself. That was fine. At least there’d be a sense of familiarity.
Just like old times’ sake.
Defence was boring, even though Professor Quirrel was such an eccentric person to watch. He stuttered a lot and some of Harry’s classmates were actually betting that his turban sometimes
put my name in the Goblet of Fire. Not that I could have, even if I wanted to. And I
Draco Malfoy,
All of his Slytherin sense of self-preservation fought and clawed for a way out,
“Well, should we go, too?” Theodore was already putting his things back in his satchel.
Ron glances down at Harry’s face, before sitting on the foot of the bed. “So. Malfoy’s back, huh?”
Draco laughs, low and empty. “You can’t save everyone all the time.”
He couldn't lie to himself that he wasn't in love with Harry Potter anymore.
At Harry's confused expression, Draco went on but kept his eyes firmly on the book as if the conversation bored him. "The other thing, to take the Jinx off."
They talk about classes, their lessons, and the occasional gossip.
not the one that’s supposed to be saying sorry.
It dawned on him at the same time that the fireplace roared back to life, red and yellow and warm.
He resolutely pushed down his self-persecution complex that reminded him that Harry was just saying that because he hasn’t been outside – doesn’t know what the Wizarding World thought of werewolves – because what else mattered but Harry accepting him?
And that was how they landed themselves detention.
“Well, it is our choices that make us who we are.”
"There's not a lot of romantic prospects for me, no matter what side we take. Do you want to talk about the vampire side or the potential Dark Lord follower side?"
Harry shrugged. “Probably Diggory.”
It was cute. Potter and his little temper tantrum.
“Cunning is the last word I’ll think to describe you with.”
“Excellent observation skills, Potter. I do still have my two legs with me.”
Hermione sighed exasperatedly but simply turned back to her dinner with a huff. "You better know what you're doing," she muttered.
Shuffling and then an explosion in the sky.
Draco's eyebrows furrowed. Just how serious was this?
True to her word, Narcissa did not make any justifications. She told her tale as it is, did not pretend that she is a saint. Apologized for what she said to him back then, about her cousin’s death.
Draco covered his nose as well and closed his eyes. He felt like vomiting. "Potter, I need to call…" His voice broke off, as panic started to take hold of him. What was he supposed to do?!
“Well, I don’t really care who you choose to fuck. You do you.”
a Whiplash Dive!"
Severus observed him for a few moments more. And then, he said, "No, I do not."
Harry quickly touched his wrist, trying to get his attention back.
Hermione glanced at Harry, and then bit her lip. "I'm going to write Molly," she whispered.
Potter wasn't fine.
Potter to be his friend anyway. Potter was also horrid at Potions, which was unbelievable, because
"Dragons!" Sirius' head exclaimed excitedly from the fireplace three days later. "The First Task includes dragons!" His head was practically jumping up and down, oblivious to all the colour slowly draining from Harry's face. Then again, it probably would have been hard to notice since Floo calls usually coloured your face green.
“No,” Harry shakes his head, and then he meets Draco’s eyes head on. “No, I haven’t.”
Harry backed up a bit, nervous at all the attention he was getting. He thought back to his flying and remembered with a dawning dread that
Harry blinked rapidly and realized that his eyes were wet. Feeling embarrassment wash over him, he raised his head from the table, sat up properly and wiped his face on his sleeve.
He isn’t disappointed.
He doesn’t really know how he gets there, his vision’s blurred and Harry belatedly realizes that they’re tears. There’s something really painful in his chest, like something clamping on his heart, and all he can think of is
Harry was ashamed. He turned to his best mate and cringed, both at Ron's expression and what he was about to say. Or write. He groaned. Merlin, he had planned to
Draco looks away from it. He swallows. “I expected
He obviously didn’t sleep very well last night.
." Ginny's look was triumphant.
There were so many things about this mission that they weren’t sure of, so to have both Hermione and Malfoy thinking on the same team…
Harry looked at him, amused. He could feel the beginnings of a grin threaten to worm its way up to his lips.
Draco turned back to Harry and, slowly, raised his head to look upwards.
Of all the questions that Malfoy could have asked, that question was not one of those that Harry had expected from him. Harry flushed, the redness of his cheeks creeping to his neck as he very pointedly tried not to stare at Malfoy's lips.
Draco leaned back on his pillow, already sure of his victory. “That’s why I’m here, is it not?” he scoffed.
Potter tilted his head at him, probably bewildered that Draco was adamant about this. But there was nothing weird about it at all. If Potter didn’t want to entrust this… whatever this was to
“Well? Sit down. I don’t think you came here just to watch me eat.”
"Which means that you should be thinking of what's best for your son right now, instead of being deluded that you of all people will be enough to keep Voldemort from him," Severus hit back, venom dripping from his voice.
Draco sighed. "Yeah, well, you wouldn't have needed to heal if it weren't because of me." Then, he cringed for what he was about to say, "So I guess… I'm… Err…"
There is a flurry of red hair and he finds his arms filled with Ginny and his back roughly patted by Arthur.
"I don't want to stay with Potter," Draco said, frowning. He had always been more outspoken with Severus, because Severus never treated him like a child.
Harry frowns. He hasn’t let go of Draco’s wrist yet. There are so many things he doesn’t understand, why Draco’s looking like he’s about to pass out any minute, why he’s lashing out so much, and at the back of his mind, at the
He wanted to ask, but his father seemed to understand.
was starting to get desperate for Harry to be released from the spell. People were getting frantic, whispering of just who Harry Potter's secret love was. There was also talk of just
"And Potter
Still, when he saw Draco already sitting at the same place he sat in that morning, he couldn't stop himself from feeling lighter.
"Probably the Weasel twins," Blaise helpfully supplied from beside Theodore.
Kingsley sighed, and moved to lean back on his chair. “I’ve instructed St. Mungo’s to visit you every morning, to track any symptoms that might develop. You’ve got the week off. If all goes well with your health, your next mission is next week.”
Harry flushed. He knew that Draco wasn't asking whether he would go to Ginny and beg for mercy. (Not that it'd work, anyway.) He shook his head.
Draco clicks his tongue, irritated at himself for losing control, and turns his head away. He sags back in his seat.
Malfoy caught his eye and smirked.
Viktor Krum and his shark head was the first to swim away, back in the direction they had come. Hermione Granger was safely tucked in his arms. Cedric Diggory was next, trying to swim properly while carrying Cho Chang. And Harry looked behind him, and saw the little figure of Gabrielle Delacour. Her innocent face was turned bravely upwards, believing that her sister would come for her.
and his father falling in front of him, dead and lifeless. Sometimes, he would see the Dark Mark on his arm.
And, after having gotten nothing during his stay with the Dursleys, he wanted nothing more.
. Harry raised an eyebrow. Draco tried again.
was supposed to destroy all of those.
Seamus grinned at him wickedly and pointed to himself. “Charms Expert, remember?”
“You’re incorrigible,” Harry muttered with an amused roll of his eyes.
As the arena came into view, he was embarrassed to see that they had erected a wide projection in the air of him and the dragon so that the audience could see the events of the tournament unfold, even if they occurred outside the arena. Harry tried to keep the flush on his face down. Maybe he could pass it off as windburn and not as currently dying from embarrassment please kill me now.
The look that Theodore gave him was both gobsmacked and bewildered. "
“Alright, but
And so it was on the seventh day that a determined mob of girls flocked to the Gryffindor Table during breakfast and stared pointedly at Harry Potter, who had his sandwich halfway to his mouth.
She leaned back, hands on her hips, and Harry finally managed to take in her appearance. Her black hair were cropped neatly just above her shoulders and she was thin and small, just like him. Her face looked… well, Harry didn’t want to be mean, but she looked like Aunt Marge’s dog.
Harry snapped his eyes back to her faithfully. "I wasn't ogling."
This time, she shifts in her seat so that her body is facing him completely, as if she is giving him her full attention. Her gaze turns serious. “I can’t say I understand why you feel responsibility over my son. Rather, I’m actually worried about you.”
One, all their theories were right, a simple Finite Incantatem would work, and both of them would merrily trot back to the Ministry to file a report before just as merrily trotting back to their next mission location. Two, nothing would happen and they’d go back to the drawing board. And three…
Draco flashed him a beaming smile right back. “Right. Let’s go to the shrubs next.”
“Does it hurt your body? Does it affect your magic in any way? No? Then I don’t see reason why you should stay succumbed to Voldemort’s whims and actions.” Madame Pomfrey’s eyes peered at him, bearing the wisdom one can only get from old age and multiple lives lost, but after a while, they softened and she said:
The castle's many bridges and spires were in view now, and Harry had a brief moment to wonder if he'd get in trouble if the dragon destroyed them, but it was gone soon enough as he thought the least they could do was not give him detention after shoving him towards a murderous, fire-breathing dragon and telling him to go steal her egg.
It was frightening how easy it was to make the decision.
With a sigh, Dumbledore leaned forward in his desk and looked at Snape from above his crescent-shaped spectacles. “Would you like some help? I could owl Minerva or Professor Sprout. Hmm, Pomona seems to be more suited in teaching that young a child, no?”
It didn't really escape his notice that someone may have put his name in the Goblet of Fire in an attempt to get rid of him for good.
Maybe it was because he wasn’t in Grimmauld Place.
“No,” Harry said automatically as warmth bloomed across his cheeks.
now and a lot more human.
the one who organized the cabinet, Malfoy."
Draco didn't mind.
“What the hell for?”
of it
Without asking for Malfoy’s permission, Harry grabbed his wrist tightly and hissed a command,
So much for Slytherin loyalty. "You don't have to if you don't want to, Pansy –"
"It is also yours," Severus added.
“Let’s hope your watch’s as useful as you make it out to be,” Malfoy replied with amusement.
Merlin, he wants to,
The days pass by in a haze of breakfast and small conversations.
"Sod it, Potter," he said smoothly, relaxing in his chair.
"Of course I am," Potter said, glaring. "I was there, Malfoy. Before you arrived. I saw…" Then, he looked away, and Draco could almost hear the words unsaid.
Theodore went on as if he hadn't heard him. "And Professor Dumbledore or Professor Snape's not going to let anything happen to you."
was the only possible solution, then…
Molly huffs, wipes at her eyes again, before waving a ladle in his direction. “Well, come on, then, Harry, you’re just in time for lunch.”
The smile that Draco sent him had him inhaling sharply and holding his breath.
There were reporters shouting “
The thumb stops. There is confusion in Potter’s voice. “What?”
Ron snorted.
What he did know, however, that that wasn’t it.
"Don't you think you ought to retire, mate?" Harry asked in pity as he kneeled down to untie his letter from the owl's legs.
,” Snape hissed vehemently.
To his surprise, Draco starts laughing.
Thank
Lucius hissed. "Voldemort will be looking for you and me. It's better that Draco is not with any of us."
ended up on the table rather than the scalloped potatoes he had been cooking.
“We’re not exactly well-liked, Potter. You know that best.”
the magic, rather than combatting it. It’s all in the beginning stages of research, but it’s worth looking into.”
Harry felt the wind blow out of him as his head whipped back and the side of his body hit the edge of the table painfully.
"I don't know!" Draco sighed exasperatedly. "I don't really go around thinking about biting people, so you tell me!"
The grin immediately dropped from his face at Severus' next words:
“If we’d had known, we would have helped you!”
Maybe staying here wouldn't be so bad.
There was a dead quiet. Feet shuffled nervously. Fear smelled so strongly in the air, it made Harry light-headed again.
Draco winced at how harsh it sounded, and at the fact that all these adults were fighting about him. Severus and Narcissa arguing wasn't new to him, however. Narcissa hadn't really been discreet about her opinions about Severus' charge, and Severus had never taken it lying down.
And Draco replied, just as quiet, “Let me rephrase myself then. This is the only way I can forgive myself.”
"Don't…" Draco said, voice soft and weak. "Don't you hate me?"
He didn’t.
Draco follows his gaze, towards the table with two sets of breakfast: French toast, runny eggs, slices of fruit, and a cup of coffee. He sighs. “Well, sit down, Potter. There’s nothing much I can object to when even my house elf’s making you breakfast.”
Petunia shook her head furiously. “None. Now leave.” One more glance behind. “
Their Quidditch score was 49-50 now, and while Draco was still sour about this, he was adamant that Potter join the Quidditch Team so that they could finally beat the Gryffindor Team that was "
That morning, he got out of bed, took a longshower in an effort to calm his nerves, got dressed, brushed his teeth, and tried to brush his hair.
And then… there was a smell. Like metal. Like blood.
Harry scrambled to his feet, panic and adrenaline making him charge through the chaos and seeking that one single voice, in that sea of screams, that one single voice that mattered—
Harry felt his face burning. "So… you plan to?"
isn’t allowed to talk big.” He shoves the tart towards Draco’s mouth, fully expecting him to turn away. To his surprise, Draco takes the fork, cleans it free of tart, and gives it back to Harry.
meant a whole lot of other things. “I’ll make it fast,” he promised. And then, “
mastered that art?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow in amusement.
A little less Malfoy, a lot more Draco.
Draco wasn't surprised when he saw him, and even nodded in greeting.
“That’s where I destroyed the diary,” Potter said, murmuring as if lost in memory.
As Draco and Potter walked towards the lift, once Rosmerta was out of earshot, Potter leaned in close to whisper, “Was she talking about me or Kingsley?”
Draco cringed. That was true. He glanced back and forth between his father and Dumbledore. "Are you…"
Just like that, Draco's mood lifted.
"It's not…" At this, Draco's eyes narrowed suspiciously. "The Weasel, is it?"
Or maybe, maybe he’s crying because of everything he hadn’t been able to prevent.
"These are mermaids, you say?"
Beside him, Potter looked like a wreck, face ashen and eyes sunken with lack of sleep. Even his hair was messier than usual. Still, Potter had bumbled around this morning as he usually did, talking cheerfully with Headmistress McGonagall and smiling and waving at the gawking students they passed. Ever the professional.
Despite what Sirius and Remus said, he found himself a bit nervous and shy to check each compartment on the train for Draco. Instead, he found himself an empty one and hoped that he’d see his friend in Hogwarts instead.
Ten seconds later, he had to admit that it wasn't one of the wiser decisions he had ever made in his life because just after arriving at their destination, the cat took off into a run and sprinted into the crowd.
“Next, we’ll need to go into the Room of Requirement for Rowena Ravenclaw’s Diadem.”
And how could Draco accept being assigned another partner so easily? As if their history of scathing arguments and childish Wizards' Duels for their honor meant nothing to him? As if he had all but forgotten their numerous name-calling and verbal rows before they matured into friendly insults done out of social obligation to one another?
“I’m up,” Harry says, voice cracking. He swallows the dryness down his throat, and then tries again. “I’m up.”
The defeaning roar of the crowd.
Harry knew it was him because of the crooked circles that made up his eyeglasses and the zigzag scar on his forehead.
enough.
book.”
Almost out of habit, Harry glared sullenly at that.
And Harry was surprised, yet again, to realize that—Malfoy was right.
"No."
“Never as wise as they think they are.”
Harry didn’t like it.
walk, but he can only hold himself up for a few minutes, before his knees start to buckle beneath him. Harry helps him back to his wheelchair by keeping an arm around Draco’s waist and a hand under his elbow, and Draco doesn’t get angry and Harry pretends this isn’t weird.
But then Halloween happened and… Dumbledore said that the boy was safer off living with the Muggles.
He turned back towards the bookshelf. “Shall we then?”
scared, and Harry tried to convey as much apology as he could through his expression. Still, he continued.
"Whatweed?" Harry blinked.
Harry did, and thought that jinxing Ginny's hair into snakes for a month was too merciful.
Thick, white fog emanated from the cauldron.
But Draco thought that he looked considerably more relaxed than he had been at breakfast.
There was a sickening thud that resounded in the pitch.
Potter being here, being so meddlesome with him and his life, and
Harry sees the moment that Draco confirms that he really is indeed Harry Potter.
This really was unfamiliar. It had been a long time since anybody other than his mother had seemed genuinely concerned over his well-being. It was discomfiting, and yet Draco let it warm him.
He was surprised when Draco whipped his head back to stare incredulously at him and said, “You really are an utterly daft twit, Harry Potter. Why would I –“
Hermione’s in Australia, reacquainting her parents with the daughter they forgot they had.
But he didn’t let go and Harry clung to that steady force holding him.
He turned to Malfoy, “Are you ready?”
that Harry would.
Draco’s room is no exception, and it’s like his whole room is bathed in spring. It is large and spacious, with green walls and a beige carpet. His bed, with its green and white comforter, is situated on one side, and there is a large amount of floor before one reaches the other side and arrives at the balcony.
Harry snorted and looked behind his shoulder as they entered the Manor. “You didn’t ask for forgiveness at all.”
he had snarled. “
, Harry thought bitterly as the girls crowed and started to run towards his stiff form on the very cold floor like predators to their prey.
Madame Pomfrey passed the vial to Severus, who walked briskly towards the bathroom without a word.
Did he think that Malfoy was going to get out of Azkaban okay and they can go through their eighth year in peace and everything’s going to be alright and everyone’s going to finally be happy?
"It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. "I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby."
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.
Harry shook his head.
Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
"No..." said Harry, startled by the odd question. "We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions."
"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?"
"Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?"
"And women," Wood agreed with a nod. "This is it-"
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of unexplorable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.
"Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the front, "and say 'Up!'"
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.
Harry ignored her and mounted the broom, his ears pounding. He kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in mid-air. He looked stunned.
"Slytherin in possession- Flint with the Quaffle... passes Spinnet- passes Bell... hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose- only joking, Professor- Slytherins score... Ah no..."
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. "Charlie," he said.
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry- he hated him.
"Why don't you all just shut up and wait until tomorrow to find out?" Draco suddenly spoke up once he had tucked the package underneath the bench.
"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one."
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?
This chapter story thing contains multiple triggering things such as eating disorder, PTSD and depressive undertones. if any of this triggers you, please PLEASE just move onto the next chapter, this doesn't affect the storyline in any way.
"Nothing," said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?
"Seeker?" he asked. "But first years never- you must be the youngest house player in-"
"All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut. Then they heard a distant shout.
"I'm not hungry."
I really really really really hate Snape. He's such a dick. Ugh. Literally picking on Harry for NO REASON and blaming him for Neville's mistake?? calling Neville an idiot just because he went wrong on his FIRST EVER POTION?? Calling literal children Dunderheads even though they're LEARNING-- God, I hate him so much. I know i'm going to hate him more and more as I keep writing this. I hope you enjoyed anyway- barely any changes to this chapter because it was pretty much perfect.
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement, he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch- all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.
"I've found him!" he whispered. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here!... Listen to this: '
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.
"He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. "Wonder what's wrong with his leg?"
"Budge up there, move along."
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
It was a sort of snuffling.
"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!"
Quick Note: You may have noticed that I used both 'Christmas' and 'Yule' In this chapter- eventually it'll just be referred to as Yule, But Harry grew up in a muggle family who calls it Christmas so he would also refer to things as 'Christmas' while wizards say 'Yule'.
"Go away."
"What are you all looking at?!" he asked loudly over the cheering. They said nothing but Pansy pointed upwards- Draco looked up.
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.
"Typical," Harry sighed. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy."
"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely. "Yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it."
"I-I just wondered if I could have my book back, sir..." He said in the most confident way he could.
"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery."
"Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. "We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Philosopher's Stone apart from Fluffy."
"Slytherin in possession- Flint with the Quaffle- passes Spinnet- passes Bell- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose- only joking, Professor- Slytherins score- Ah no.."
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.
"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"
"What are you looking for, boy?"
Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:
"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?" whispered Hermione.
"Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-"
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.
Sorry this took me so long to do- again- .-.
"What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.
His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. '
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below-- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.
"What's all this noise?"
"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd-"
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.
Harry, who was looking up 'Dittany' in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, "Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?"
"Well done," said George in a low voice . "Wood told us. We're on the team too... Beaters."
Draco saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick- he hit the field on all fours- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.
-Harry is 1/4 Indian. (James is half Indian)
"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And send me an owl if you find anything."
"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert- and Malfoy.
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
"Yeah- he's mine! Bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the-..."
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good; every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
(See the end of the chapter for
They all retreated from underneath the Slytherin stand, Draco glancing back at the figure of Potter for one last look, and quickly made their way back to their common room.
"They're... spoons." Harry said, confused. Ron stopped playing with the dragon and went back over to Harry to take a look.
"I don't know, sir..."
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cosy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:
"But it's against our laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden- anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania."
"The library?" Hagrid asked as he followed them out of the hall. "Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?"
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Its one of my weaker ones but I hope you liked the little details I added in. please do leave feedback, it really helps me and boosts my confidence and motivation to keep writing!
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.
"-and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you."
"I'm coming with you," she said.
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have shown in his face, because Filch said, "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy- it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
"No, we don't mind," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you."
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored him. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.
"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much."
Except-
"I'm not going in that forest," he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.
TROOOOLLLLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!! TROOOOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!.......Thought you ought to know......
"You- Potter- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor."
"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget it and go back."
"-And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said George. "Yule is a time for family."
"What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.
At three-thirty on Thursday afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying ominously in the distance.
"But Malfoy-"
"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something."
"You!" exclaimed Ron furiously. "Go back to bed!"
"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.
"I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding."
"It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron.
"Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
Okay so. You might have noticed the changes- As I was editing this is couldn't believe the number of times Rowling used "Said". I changed SO MANY of those- I probably missed a few lol. I hope you don't mind the little 'Harry Triggers' as I call them, my aim was to show the impact that the Dursleys have on Harry. Hope you enjoyed!
"Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, tell me."
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.
"What's that you've got there, Potter?"
"That's true... the 'special circumstances' has to be Quidditch."
"Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom!"
For legal reasons, this is fanfiction :)
"Abou' time," he said. "I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?"
"Oh- I've seen those at Diagon Alley! They're called one-use spoons, you use them in difficult or advanced potions- they're quite expensive... you got four?"
"Very well," Snape cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie."
There was a tap on the dark window.
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but-
"He's gonna fall!" He heard a Slytherin shriek- he noticed a hint of excitement in her tone.
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defence Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
"It's fine, thanks."
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them."
"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon- Malfoy in detention- what could spoil their happiness?
"Hagrid-- what's that?"
"Firenze!" Bane thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.
"Say 'please."'
"Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-"
"Yeah- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it."
"Come back, boy!" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle- twelve feet- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and-
“We destroyed the locket over there. Ron completely smashed it into pieces. What should be left there is just remnants of Voldemort’s magic, in its most raw state. So…” He frowned, trying to remember what Hermione had said. “A
"...Cat," Draco repeated slowly.
The morning of the Second Task came and it was a dreary, winter morning. The sky was covered by thick clouds, making the water of the Great Lake look murkier than normal. It had already stopped snowing but the cold bite of the winter still had everyone wearing gloves and scarves and knitted coats. Harry, shivering in his tank top and shorts as he waited for Dumbledore to start the festivities, envied them greatly.
"Malfoy?"
Gurgling sounds as blood spurted from the wound on a deathly-white neck.
"HARRY, I LOVE YOU!"
, Harry thought grumpily as his vision started to swirl. He barely had time to mouth a very rude "Fuck you" at her before the pain consumed him and he lost all consciousness, dreaming of Skele-Gro and jinxing Ginny Weasley's hair into snakes for a month.
The Dark Lord sitting at the head of the dining table, his mangled fingers holding a shining goblet. His bloodied feet staining the marble floor. Their grandiose ballroom, covered with diamonds and chandeliers, now smothered in darkness and littered with murderers.
Harry knew that the Lavender and her girls wouldn't follow McGonagall's orders and stay quiet for very long, but that didn't stop him from hoping.
“The Room of Requirement might be your last mission.”
had expected Draco to ask for a way out. “We are grateful, Draco. I understand this is not an easy mission, nor will it get easier.” He sighed again, and looked at Draco earnestly. “Thank you.”
plate. Why was he putting food in Harry’s plate?
Harry found himself sighing. A sulking Sirius is always a troublesome Sirius. More so than usual. "Thanks, Remus. How are you doing?"
Draco recalls his summer days in the Manor. He recalls the happiness he felt, the frightening unfamiliarity of it after all those
Harry and Malfoy exchanged frowns, before Malfoy turned his head down to look at his hand holding his wand. “Should I use my left hand then?”
Hermione’s twirling her quill, and there is an open tome laid out beside her half-eaten plate of breakfast. Ron and Harry have tried and failed to get her to stop studying on the breakfast table. (“It’s too early for me to look at a book, ‘Mione!”Ron had failingly pleaded.)
Harry hoped so, too. But if Hermione was correct… And Hermione usually was…
Dying, dark magic, Draco guessed.
“And you mean to tell me that
Dark Lords were vanquished, Wizarding Worlds were saved, and he and Ginny had come to the agreement that they were better off as friends.
, Potter. I'll –"
When Draco spoke, it was sharp and hissed.
He burst out into another round of laughter.
Potter avoided his eyes when he said, “We’re… looking at alternative methods.”
And then Harry asked, so softly and muffled into Remus’ shoulder that he almost didn’t hear: “I’m a vampire, aren’t I?”
to say it out loud, though maybe that was because Harry could finally say
The dragon crashed into the bridge with a deafening howl. Harry quickly rounded the castle, weaving through towers and courtyards to find the shortest way back to the arena.
Draco’s body jerks forward in his seat and his fist slams down on the window sill. “It’s a fucking Trip Jinx, Potter! What did you expect?! Ex-Death Eater comes back to Hogwarts and gets a standing ovation from the student body?!”
"All the suspense is killing us!"
He fell on his knees, on top of small rocks, and he cried out in pain as they dug against his skin.
Without even thinking about it, he stomped over to the bathroom and wretched open the door.
“Just a headache,” Draco admitted. One requirement for this mission was complete and absolute honesty. Everything about this mission was theoretical and still experimental, and Draco knew that hiding information would probably lead to
“I’ll say it clearly, Malfoy,” Harry said, walking back to step in front of him. “The mission’s first priority is you.”
Before Draco could grab his wand and spell his door closed, Potter opened the door, letting the light from the hallway spill into the room.
The two spots of dormant, dark magic had been too close to each other, the explosion was so different from their earlier missions, more violent, more
"Yes, but I vaguely remember falling off my broom, but not hitting the ground. I wonder whose fault is that," Potter replied patiently.
He barely managed to read it before it dissolved into nothing.
"No," Potter shook his head, still chuckling. "No, sorry. I just… Deja vu." Then, he looked down, smiled a small smile, before shaking his head again. He looked back at Draco. "Severus says you saved me."
Draco felt an already familiar anger and feeling of frustration well up in him. Why did his father bring him? An offering? What was his father
After their walk, Harry had refused to go to the Great Hall for dinner.
Harry grins. It’s weak, but it’s real. He had spent the last three months trying to avoid every reporter and request for interview thrown his way. He thinks that Kingsley’s probably exasperated with him, but Harry doesn’t really care. He did his part. The wizarding world doesn’t have the right to demand anything from him now. “I reckon this’ll be the last place they’ll think to look.”
had Draco alarmed. He didn’t just spend the past few weeks using up all of his physical, cognitive, and emotional reserves for this, only to be cast off the mission. “What do you mean?”
to stop the smile from worming up his face. They were on a mission to destroy the remnants of Voldemort’s magic. Malfoy was about to be horribly subjected to a Crucio-like curse in a few minutes. Focus on the mission, not on Malfoy’s wit.
A heartbeat later and –
And he doesn’t know what it is that he said, but Potter’s smiling, and

It didn’t help that the boy was
Pansy immediately stepped forward, right next to Hagrid, the Gamekeeper.  Her face was a pale white when she screeched out, “You are
Draco clutched at his hand tightly but wasn’t reassured. “A dog! There’re trolls and clawed creatures out there and we’ve got a dog!”
Harry didn’t know what he looked like now—he was barely holding himself together—but whatever Malfoy saw in his face made his grip on Harry’s collar loosen.
“…Yes,” Potter said eventually, which surprised Draco even further. “But.” He took a deep breath, one shuddery inhale, and then his face and shoulders both fell in misery. “I can’t.”
Draco
It’s definitely weird. Seeing their names together. They don’t match, after all.
“Thanks,” he whispered breathlessly when he was done. “I don’t know what I’d do without you guys,” he said, a shy smile on his lips and his cheeks pink.
As if his parents were still alive and Harry was their curious child who wandered off to far in the house when they weren’t looking and went through all their important stuff.
“I don’t use it to look for him!” Harry defends, blushing furiously, but he immediately knows that it’s a pathetic lie. Ron and Hermione’s eyebrows are both raised. “Not
It made you a bit dizzy afterwards, but other than that, it felt just like an ignorable task that you do in a day, like brushing your teeth, or eating breakfast, or putting on lotion, or brushing your hair.

Draco's eyes widened.

“He can survive five more years of pampering from his ever-doting relatives, Albus,” he had said bitingly. “His…
Severus cut through his jumbled thoughts. "Don't play with your food, Draco."
“Twenty Sickles that the food served in the next drinking session is cat,” Frank Hartsman, Senior Auror, whispered to Gary Oldmoore.
Briefly, Harry contemplates quitting his position and living a secluded life with his lover in peace and gluttony. He thinks Draco would approve of that. But, he chuckles to himself, he thinks that he would probably go crazy with nothing else to do.
"We're done for," came that uninterested drawl that Harry would recognize in any crowd. "10 galleons Durmstrang wins the Triwizard Tournament."
“I told you he was going to come on a Tuesday! Give me five sickles!” George is howling, and Ron, grumbling, grudgingly shoves a hand down the pocket of his pants.
"Is this why you were so confident with those 50 galleons of yours, Potter?" Draco smirked.
Snape, who had probably been expecting him, didn't even pause in his work of checking papers and marking them all with Dreadfuls. "I'll give you until 8 o'clock sharp, Potter."
to spread them anymore. Harry Potter was so tight-lipped! (No pun intended.) After a quick plan-making session in the girls' bathroom, she took almost half the female student population of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with her to get to the bottom of things.
"So you'll do it then? Soon?"
A glance at the clock tells him it’s past lunch time.
If Hermione's not available – or, err, back in the Great Hall with a mob of crazed students, then one has to make do with the library.
Draco sighs, waving his hand. He looks tired today. Like it took more effort for him to come back. “For the record, I think it’s safe to say we expected the same thing to happen when I entered that godforsaken place.”
As they passed by store after store, Harry ticked off all the things that he
Draco Malfoy looked amazing.
Lord Voldemort had risen once again.
Draco smirked, raising the Snitch in his hand back between their faces. “Is this what you meant by the inscription?
Honestly speaking, he wasn’t surprised. He
Harry didn't know he could get even more terrified that he already was.
Draco nodded slowly, trying to piece all the information together. “So. You don’t know how to destroy this last one. You haven’t asked Weasley
He wondered for the umpteenth time what life would be like if Severus hadn't taken him from the Dursleys. Eight years away from his days in Privet Drive, it was still his bad habit. He wondered what life would be like without Severus.
Remus also told him about wands and potions
Harry nudges him with his knee. “I ought to shove you in the fountain, Malfoy.”
didn'twant to write it at all. He had spent the last hour being generally quiet (which was easy, really) and even attempting to retreat to the sanctity of the Boys' Dorms, but his friends were having none of that.
The day is peaceful. It is bright and quiet and invisible birds chirp softly from different edges of the garden. It’s a stark contrast from the heaviness of their conversation.
wrote Harry on the Self-Erasing Parchment the next morning as they were walking to the Great Hall. Hermione had already gone ahead of them since they had woken up late after staying up until two in the morning.
“Almost all of them are under multiple life sentences.”
The next morning, he taught the kid how to fly.
Two weeks later, Draco was back in Hogwarts, in the Headmistress’ Office, and while he was in high spirits, Potter beside him was decidedly not.
At that, Harry flushed and nodded in greeting, managing a weak grin. Draco nodded back, and then simply returned to his book.

Draco raised his eyebrow, both at the exaggeration and the careful use of pronoun.
Astoria who has now gone quiet and is looking at him as if she’s trying to figure something out.
Draco grinned at him unrepentantly, effectively sending the butterflies in Harry’s stomach into flight.
Draco flinches and looks away, mouth curled downwards. “We lost the chance for that back in first year. Too late for friendship bracelets now,” he mutters.

Draco's lip curled. "How chivalrous," he said, and then turned to his book, making it clear that he did not want to talk anymore.
, when did this become a Grab The Chance to Snog the Golden Boy parade?
Narcissa looks at him in surprise, and it’s clear that she did not expect that. But a smile slowly appears on her face, and it’s wistful. “Thank you, Harry.”
It’s not working. Everything that Draco says still stings.
He wasn't sure if Potter heard him from that height, but Potter slowly hovered downwards, until he jumped off his broom a few feet away from Draco.
He wasn't a vampire.
It had always been him and Voldemort.
Harry watched detachedly as the cat jumped inside his flat and proceeded to walk towards him.
“You’re…” Malfoy squints.
if it isn't Hogwarts' Champion!" reached his ears as soon as he entered the Slytherin common room. Sniggers resounded from around the room.
Ron, out of the habit that he had grown to have the past few days, looked around for Malfoy but was confused when he didn't find him.
Draco, as he has always done, responds to the challenge. He lifts a hand, reaches towards the table. It’s slow, but his palm manages to land on the fork. His fingers shake and Harry understands, with another pang in his chest, that it’s probably been a while since Draco used his limbs.
“It is. Do tell me more about this cousin of yours.”

is too formal, too reminiscent of their old relationship, especially in this house. “And no. You don’t have to apologize for that.”
"The human who gives the vampire his first taste of human blood is referred in texts as the First Donor. It is this blood that… rearranges the chemical construction of the vampire's body. The vampire's body will change according to that first blood, and as a result, will crave for it thereafter." He paused, letting all the information sink in.
whispering, though,” Harry commented nonchalantly.
“Treacle tart. It’s my favourite,” he said, rummaging through his pocket yet again. He produces two forks, and offers one to Draco. “Though you’ve probably already guessed.”
His stomach felt heavy.
was very comfortable.)
Draco did his best to comfort him or tell him otherwise, but all the low mutterings and suspicious stares that he got in the halls only fuelled his belief of Narcissa Malfoy’s words:
"And it won't be," Madame Pomfrey said resolutely.
“Malfoy?” came the tentative voice.
“Don’t scratch,” he warned, but it was either the cat didn’t take very well to being carried or being warned because the cat leapt from his arms, nearly knocking over the table that held the books for the window display. The table, thankfully, kept upright, but one of the books, however, fell from its stand.
“Harry is not a
Flushing, Harry waved his wand and cast soothing charms. He’d learned to be quite adept at them.
He sighs, turning around and lying back down on his bed. His head’s
Red. Red everywhere. In the bathtub. All over the floor. Smeared on the walls. Smeared on the sides of the tub. And in the middle of the room… Potter lay sprawled on the floor, one arm slung over the side of the tub. Blood dripped down his nose and mouth, staining his clothes, arms, and legs. When he saw Draco, his eyes widened with fear, and he pressed his hands over the lower half of his face as he crawled backwards, wedging himself in between the tub and the toilet.
“Don’t talk about her like that,” he says, as calmly as he can to will away the irritation starting to itch under his skin.
Although old times’ sake had them tables apart from each other.
Ron sighed and decided to do his mate a favour and tell him what happened during his mission with Draco. “Remember that mission that he and I were paired off to?”
Dumbledore relaxed in his seat and smiled.
Ginny ignored it. "I hear you've been in the library a lot," she said smoothly.
"Three
Draco let out a longsuffering sigh. "Gillyweed, you idiots."
his mind supplied, but he stopped himself before he could think too much about the future.)
"Aw, Harry, don't you enjoy all the attention?"
He had been lying when he said that they had been looking at alternative methods, because of course Kingsley would never consent to working with other Death Eaters. It had too many risks involved, much like what Draco said.
She didn't need to know.
One corner of Severus' lips turned up into a dry smile. "I suppose. There's a mutt around here spreading his fleas."
It was Harry's turn to shrug.
Draco knew that that was what this was all about.
Severus continued. "He's awake and eating himself sick with those favorite tart of his."
feel guilty for having Draco clean Severus' cupboard of ingredients with him. After all, Draco only went out of his way to get Gillyweed so that Harry could get through the Second Task safely…
Despite his nervousness, Harry felt his lips tug upwards into a smile at the excitement on Draco’s face – but the smile quickly dissolved into nothing when the woman took one distasteful look at him and quickly ushered Draco inside the house with a firm hand on his back.
Harry felt his fingertips go cold. He vaguely heard Draco growl but it was getting harder to concentrate on the words with the loud sound of his blood rushing in his ears.
“Live your life, Harry. Voldemort is gone.”
Pansy peered at him suspiciously. "You've never fancied anyone before?"
He thought happily upon seeing the unmistakable blond hair.
“…Alright, then. See you in a week, Potter.”
A whimper below him had him looking down abruptly, and he stared – with wide eyes and a sick feeling unfurling in his stomach – at the child who was standing, tensed, with his arms above his head for protection.
During the night, exhausted and eyes swollen after crying so much, he had somehow fallen asleep, and for this, he is grateful. He doesn’t know how he could have survived that whole night awake.
Harry pointedly ignored him and focused on murdering his poached eggs with his fork.
The next time that Harry comes to the Manor, it is a week after Draco was released. Narcissa is in Scotland. There are pancakes on the table, covered with temperature spells, and two sets of plates and cutlery. There is also a note in Narcissa’s elegant handwriting, telling him to please help himself.
When in doubt, go to Hermione.
Today, they sat beside each other on the Ravenclaw’s table, just because they could. And it was the closest to the door. And it was a perfect match with the fact that their next horcrux (or rather, it’s magical remnants) was Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem.
(Harry had also told him that he had no idea how he had defeated this Voldemort guy, since he was just three months old, and the offhanded way that he had mentioned the Dark Lord’s name had made Draco wince.)
A few beats passed, with nobody moving as Potter continued on.
Ron clapped a hand on his shoulder. "Well, your Knight awaits."
Harry bent down and scooped the cat in his arms, cradling it in his arms as he entered the warmth and quiet of the bookstore.
Harry knew that whatever insults that Ron and Draco still sent each other were mainly due to traditional obligation than any sort of real animosity, so he didn’t reprimand Draco for that. Instead, he accused Draco of another deed. “You went through my alcohol stash!”
"I suppose I'll have to thank the Weaslette for this," he said thoughtfully.
Stinging Hexes and see what they think about it –" she was muttering, and this was already a very serious thing because Madame Pomfrey swore an oath to
"Drink," came Severus' dry drawl. "It should help soothe your muscles."
Harry peered at Ron in confusion. “You really hate cats, don’t you? You and Crookshanks never were the best of friends.”
Harry waved away those stubborn memories and ignored the twinge in his chest. They really did like to pop up at the most inappropriate times.
he told himself firmly, scrambling out from underneath the white covers.
"Did you just hear that, mate?" Ron said disbelievingly. "That's the first time I heard her say that she couldn't do anything. And she's
It’s an attempt to get under his skin, and it works, because everything that Draco says works, but Harry tries his best to stamp down his irritation. “Don’t call them that.”
He knew he had to convince his ten-year-old self not to spend that summer in Snape Manor.
Draco nodded in acknowledgement.
His chest that held his things was already at the foot of his bed, and he could already see some of his robes through the glass window of the dresser.
Harry shrugs, and then takes the folded note on top of the napkin on his plate. It’s from Narcissa, with pretty much the same message as before. He sits down, swallowing the saliva that’s pooled in his mouth at the smell of the food. “Your mother asked me to come today.”
Thinking about his father and his stupid Dark plans suddenly made him even more irritated.
,he wrote.
you.”
But of course, who better to thwart his plan than Harry Potter himself?
Harry paused. He didn't really know the answer to that one. Actually, he did: Not long, hopefully, but he wasn't really in charge of this one.
Ron sighed once more, this time exasperatedly and with a roll of his eyes. “Temporarily incapacitated and possessing the attention span of a baby Kneazle, but he’ll live.”
See. Harry could be funny, too.
"Shut it, Malfoy."
He rolled his eyes in amusement. “You only want me for my wine.”
It seemed very dramatic, the way that the glass shards rained down on them like sparkling snow, but it wasn't like that at all, at least, not how Harry saw it because what he saw was the seventh-year's head turn as if in slow motion and the look of horror and fear slowly spread across his face the moment he laid eyes on Harry Potter through the rain of glass.
Harry resists the urge to shove another mouthful of eggs in his mouth in an effort to avoid his gaze.
Harry probably wasn’t trying very hard to get away because Draco caught up to him in no time even with his skinned knees.
Harry doesn’t manage to anymore, though, because Hermione’s back and he’s been spending a lot of his time in the Burrow again, doing last minute house repairs and last minute shopping in Diagon Alley. They do it under Glamours, of course, and Harry wonders if Draco’s well enough to walk around Diagon Alley, too.
“You’re a werewolf, aren’t you?” Harry asked him one night after the full moon when Remus had lain in bed, still too weak to continue their lesson on subtraction.
The warmth that bloomed in Snape’s chest terrified him.
Excited whispers came from the table that was hidden from view by a bookshelf.
At that, Harry’s tense shoulders relaxed. “Well, you were laughing at me, so I thought…” he grumbled back, cheeks still red as well. He peered up at Draco through his fringe. “No one’s ever worried about you?” he asked awkwardly.
It was mid-October when Harry Potter realized, with a sense of dread, that he was once again growing to be very much obsessed with Draco Malfoy.
Draco’s smiling, and the sun is bright and his hair is bright, and there’s more colour to his face now than there has been for weeks.
It was
She regarded him from above her thin glasses. “And yet you never do.”
“Yes, I did. Thanks for asking.”
And just like that, it was like a switch was flipped. "Ah, yes, you're welcome with that mermaid part, by the way. Tell me
“You know he never held it against you.”
But this was Uncle Severus’ place and Uncle Severus never fell for his tricks and, well, Harry was looking really scared and concerned and Draco’s never had anyone really
But that was a Muggle saying and when did Muggles ever get anything right? (The box with the moving pictures in Harry's living room, however, Draco could admit, was fascinating.)
Beside him, Ron was a deathly white.
Hogwarts was still not as safe as Dumbledore had once upon a time wished it to be.
Harry will never understand girls.
Harry almost pitied him when he said, “Err. Yes.”
A half of Remus' face appeared alongside Sirius'. "They're really quite majestic creatures, Harry. It's amazing to see them up close!"
"You – you're speaking," Draco breathed out in amazement, eyes wide. Then, his mind caught on, and he let out a small gasp of realization.
didn't sound right. Malfoy definitely wasn't someone who was running to be a saint. He cut off Draco's tirade. "Why did you help me, anyway?"
Draco was immensely sour about this.
Draco brushed it off, long used to Severus' expressions that usually scared all children away. Not Draco. He'd been with Severus long enough to know when he was
Draco sighs, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. “And besides, why would you even want to be friends with me?”
to be swimming in your horde of fans, lording over everyone, giving out autographed posters of you holding You-Know-Who’s severed head. Not skulking around here in my room.”
What happened next was a series of quick events that Snape was too detached from to experience properly.
Harry choked on the wine this time.
Harry took one look at Draco’s face that was drained of colour and it was almost natural for him to reach out and wrap a hand around Draco’s. He shrugged weakly and tried for a reassuring smile. “We’ve got Fang.”
Draco was surprised that it lessened his discomfort in this unfamiliar place.
That night, Harry and Ron stayed up late talking. Or, in Harry's case, writing.
Harry’s nose scrunched up in confusion. He didn’t know what a Weasley was.
“No—“ Harry is quick to cut her off, disturbed to even hear those words from her. “No. I – I wouldn’t be here. If I didn’t want to.”
Severus ignored them.
Harry wasn't the only one who realized the appearance of his rapidly growing obsession.
And the Boggart scampered off into the dark.
was the current person he was talking
Pansy didn't seem flustered at having her crush mentioned in the open, and merely waved her hand as if it was general information. "But to pass on the chance of going to the Yule Ball with Harry Potter – Savior of the Wizarding World, The Boy Who Lived, Champion of Hogwarts, First Placer in the First Task of the very dangerous Triwizard Tournament?" She smiled, her lip gloss shining in the firelight. "You'll be the first to dance, Harry, and for that, you'll need a partner. And besides, Draco understands. We're pureblood Slytherins. Fame and image and all that lovely rot."
It took a few more minutes of silence, of Draco pretending that he was doing his job, despite his head still reeling from the encounter and running a million miles a minute. He was too caught up in his thoughts, that he almost didn’t hear it when Potter spoke again:
But even without all that, surviving through Little Hangleton together was enough.
"Hullo, everyone!" he greeted as soon as the Fat Lady's Portrait swung open.
He succumbs to sleep before he can finish verbalizing that thought.
alright.
Draco's response was immediate. He raised his head and glared. "Absolutely not."
Snape
Harry almost turns around in anger, but Hermione tightens her grip on the sweater on his back.
"But do not fear," Dumbledore continued. "I was told that you've healed quite well. Poppy has a salve so that wound on your neck won't scar." His eyes twinkled. "But I hear scars are quite popular with the ladies."
Crucio?”
"You have a choice. Not all First Donors consent to give their blood after."
Draco liked him!
Madame Maxime wasn't really hiding her disapproval of him with her lips curled up in a sneer and her very calculated distance from him. Harry rolled his eyes. He was used to this, to people treating him like someone with a contagious disease. It happened fairly often during those fancy summer parties.
The boy raised an eyebrow at the tightness in Draco’s voice and at the way Draco had moved his body just slightly as if he was protecting Harry.
Well, shit.
Amazingly, Hermione looked apologetic. "I'm sorry, Harry. I've tried. But surely, if a counter-spell exists, then someone must have already found it. If no one's found it yet, then I don't see how
Harry felt the panic build up in him. He forced it down, swallowed down the urge to cry and run away.
On the far side of the room was a white door, which Draco guessed was a bathroom, because he could hear the sound of water running, and…
Soon, Draco was engulfed in the smell of flowers and expensive perfume.
He sighed. Stupid, clueless Gryffindors.
“Malfoy, could you come with me for a bit?” Harry found himself asking.
Harry could almost
"Take the Jinx off him, Gin," he said with a sigh, but his eyes stared unnervingly at his sister, just as stubbornly as she stared back.
He was near the living room when he heard mother and son arguing.
Draco still felt like shit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Carefully, Harry opened the lid.
"Harry, I
A knock disturbed his thoughts.
This time, it didn’t take long. The snake moved immediately, slowly at first, as if coming from a nap, and then gradually quickening until finally it stopped, its head peeking out from one of the skull’s eye socket, its tongue slipping out as it hissed,

Draco scoffed and waved Harry’s comment aside. He took his robes off and levitated it towards the coat rack. “I am not
“I have absolutely no idea why, but Woods informed me that the current bet is whether the food for the next night out with the Aurors is cat,” Draco said, nose scrunched up in disgust at the thought. He leaned back on the couch and loosened his tie.
Harry was surprised at how at ease he felt around this new boy and easily smiled back. “Match? I think I bested you during that last run, Draco.”
Severus gave a dry smile, before Accio-ing the nearest armchair. He sat down slowly, his back straight and his hands pressed together on his lap. A pure-blood stance for formal matters. Somehow, this made Draco nervous.
"How long do we have to stay imprisoned here?"
Draco’s having a hard time concentrating. He doesn’t understand what Potter’s saying.
be friends, Potter’s the Savior of the Wizarding World, and Draco’s a Death Eater.
The revulsion takes Harry by surprise and he takes a step back before he can stop himself.
At this, Sirius sobered. He grabbed Harry’s shoulders with both of his hands and looked seriously into Harry’s eyes. “No, they might not be, kiddo. But whatever they say or whatever they do to you, you remember this, okay? You’ve never, ever hurt a single hair on top of anyone’s head, so you don’t have anything to feel bad about. They can say what they want, but we know the truth, and that’s all that matters, alright?”
"I believe he plans just that," Severus said. He wasn't even trying to deny it, anymore.
Severus saw that Draco understood. "If he wanted to kill you, he already would have. But he used Nagini instead, whose venom petrifies its enemies."
Harry inhales, flattered and scared, but the answer is already on his lips. “Mrs. Malfoy–“
He takes a miniature, balled piece of cloth from his pocket, puts it carefully on Draco’s desk, and spells it back to its original size. He unties the knot of the cloth, and immediately, a scent of lemon fills the room.
– and we threw a party in honor of our unconscious housemate's victory! Malfoy says you owe him for the gillyweed, someone spiked the punch, Zabini got drunk and snogged Astoria, but between you and me, I really don't think he drank any of the punch."), Harry sneaked through the dungeons of Hogwarts under the Invisibility Cloak.
"None taken," Harry muttered. He looked pleadingly at Snape.
With a satisfied smirk, he leaned back on his chair and allowed himself the view of Potter’s panicked face at Granger’s obvious misery.
The wizarding world already considered him bad. After that incident, the dark side considered him bad too and not the approved kind.
but he didn’t… He doesn’t even know what he thought anymore.
"You look happy today," Theodore commented during lunch.
It was Hermione's turn to sigh exasperatedly. "You know what I mean!" She put her quill down.
Seeing that accusing Ginny of anything wasn't going to lead him anywhere, Harry sighed in defeat.
He looked at Potter pointedly.
Draco took a deep, shuddery breath. “I forgot you had to take your potion to go out,” he said miserably. “I couldn’t sleep last night so I waited until sunrise to wake you and drag you outside because I really wanted to fly with you.”
"Severus said you didn't eat dinner," Potter said, sitting himself comfortably on the foot of Draco's bed. He held out the tart.
Harry was confused. “Go where?”
But being in the middle of a mission probably wasn’t the right time.
He’s tired trying to avoid the press, trying to avoid the Ministry, trying to avoid the Burrow and the Weasleys’ insistence that he’s family now, even though he’s not, not really, and he feels like an intruder to their grief when they see him and have to pretend that they’re not mourning a son, a brother.
Ron eyed the cat on the couch again. “Is keeping that cat one of
Malfoy—“
Harry's face slowly turned pale.
“Ah,” Sirius said wisely and waved his hand in a grandiose motion. “Ever the great professor.”
A dog? Draco cringed. He wasn't good with dogs. He wasn't good with animals at all.
Draco accepts the chocolate frogs every time, and even tries some of Ginny’s Beans. He looks at Hermione’s task list, and never fails to make totally unnecessary comments. “You haven’t done your Potions essay yet? Potter, I’ve finished that
This mission was banking on Hermione’s theory that Voldemort’s soul
“You don’t mean that.”
Harry’s heart seemed like it jumped in his chest. Four years later and it still happened every time he heard Draco’s voice.
He smiled slightly. “Harry Potter.”
More satisfied hisses came from it, like it was content just to be in his presence.
Snape nodded at him curtly. "Undoubtedly."
Before Harry could say anything, Malfoy had already shifted his wand to his left hand, swung it, and said, “
“Anytime!” Sirius winked and knelt down to plant a really wet kiss on Harry’s forehead.
“Promise me you won’t get Nott,” he found himself saying. “You can’t trust him.”
“When Harry comes, he’ll probably avoid Malfoy like Quidditch players avoid bludgers,” Ron hissed out, purposefully using a Quidditch analogy to quickly send the point home to Ginny.
“If you cast Protego around me, I might just Finite Incantatem
With a relieved grin, Harry grabbed a piece of treacle tart and took one savory bite.
Harry snorts. “That bad, then.”
Surely, it's okay to be friends with Draco Malfoy again.
"When's the First Task?" Sirius asked.
And consequently the rest of the whole student body.
To his surprise, the man began scooping a variety of different food onto his plate.
Snorting to himself, he stepped inside the compartment, closed the door and sat down beside the blond. “Of course not. I just thought it was cool,” he said coolly.
beautiful.
At Draco's surprise, Severus said, "You
“This will be your room,” the man had gruffly said.
It would have been around this same hour. Almost dusk. The sky dark and gray. Death Eaters surrounding him, all in black. Voldemort, with his disfigured face and sneer, the tip of his wand, and the gleeful voice that shouted
It seemed that Mrs. Pomfrey had already reserved this room for him.
Had the first two chapters in my drafts for two years, but for some reason, the writing gods smote me with lightning today and had me write the next three chapters in a day jflajsdnla
Harry let himself grin as he took a sip of the tea and felt it warm his belly. Maybe he wasn't the only one embarrassed.
Unbeknownst to the two boys, Snape’s tense shoulders relaxed. “Draco,” he said in a firm voice, giving the blond boy a pointed look down his nose. “Mind your manners.”
It was weird, having the whole Common Room to himself. Draco always went home during holidays, so he didn't know how quiet it was without all the students. He wondered if Pansy and Blaise worried about him, because with no one around, Draco could admit that he worried about them.
Second, he was partly relieved that the Tournament was coming to an end. All he had to do was survive the next day and he could go back to his relatively peaceful life.
"So Harry," Ginny said smoothly, after she had pretty much ambushed Harry as soon as he had stepped out of his last class. She had dragged Harry away from an incredulous Ron and Hermione for a walk to the Paved Courtyard, taking advantage of his inability to voice out his protests. "Anything new?"
Draco looked satisfied with himself.
Another kind of dread washed over him when he saw the cat turn into a very familiar cubicle. Draco Malfoy’s. “Not there –“ he gasped out at the same time that the cat jumped up from the floor and grabbed on to the handle of the top drawer of Draco’s desk in an effort to climb up.
He didn't know if Malfoy understood what he said, so he was surprised when an amused smile stole over the other boy's features.
For a moment, Harry was filled with a sense of longing and maybe even anger because the old Draco would have insulted him on the spot without a second thought. He didn't know if he was angry at Draco or at the world in general for having made him that way. Draco wouldn't have… just sat there, looking sullenly at the empty glass.
. Let’s not even talk about Crabbe and Goyle.
Good point. They hadn’t thought about that. Nevertheless, Harry was saved from bumbling, as Malfoy continued his train of thought, “But if we’re talking about Voldemort’s
and Harry was crying, sobbing –
"And I'm going to have a word with my father about this, I can't believe Severus! This is mistreatment! Child abuse! Forbidding us to use magic to clean his dirty cupboard –"
“She’s not pretending. She’s really worried about you.”
At the back of the crowd, Molly wipes at her eyes surreptitiously using her apron, and Harry flashes her a shy grin.

Potter is leaning back on his arms, keeping his feet and his own dirty boots firmly planted on the floor.
certainly don't get more powerful every time someone calls
Draco’s head is bent dangerously close to Harry’s shoulder. He doesn’t move it. “My face doesn’t need fixing. It’s impeccable.”
Draco raised his head in interest but otherwise didn't look at Harry, who flushed excessively.
"Stinging Hex," Draco said slowly, as if carefully choosing his words.
thought Harry bitterly with a wince.
“Really? I’m pretty cunning.” And he’s turning Draco around again, completely aware that Draco can put the robes on his own, but he’s letting him, and so Harry takes what he’s being given.
Harry had a bad feeling about this. It wasn’t that the Forest was dark and foreboding and was teeming with deadly creatures – or maybe it was that. Still, Harry felt there was something else that was niggling at the back of his mind, making him more anxious with every turn they made and every tree they passed.
Draco moved.
At the center of the desk, something that had once been buried under the mounds of parchment that perpetually littered the Headmistress’ desk, was a small spot of dried, cracked wood. It looked like the wood in that particular spot had died, while everything else that made up the desk flourished on as beautiful, varnished mahogany.
"Oh, for goodness' sake, Lavender!" Hermione said, infuriated.
But he does ask about you from time to time.”
“I am the biggest fan of redemption, Potter, you should know that, but not with Nott. His continued relationship with Dark Magic after Azkaban should be enough as proof of that.”
Malfoy nodded, shoulders relaxing at whatever it is he must have seen on Harry’s face.
“Well, then.” Draco glanced back at Kingsley. “I suppose there’s no more need for my report?”
And Harry found himself smiling a bit, because it felt good seeing him like that after weeks – no,
And so, Draco felt like a fish out of water. With an incredibly pressing headache.
Harry thought as he swerved sharply to the left, almost hitting the wall as the broom responded late to his movements. Madame Hooch was flying beside him, muttering under her breath. Then, she suddenly swerved so close to him, almost dangerously so, and tapped her wand on his head. It hurt, really, since she had involuntarily used more force than what was necessary due to their shaky flying, but Harry could forgive her since she had just cast a Disillusionment Charm on him.
Draco's eyebrows rose to his hairline. "Do you mean to tell me that there is a stray cat in the Auror Department of the Ministry of Magic and that you, Head Auror and Saviour of the Wizarding World—"
He and Theodore became friends after that.
Theodore coughed. When he spoke, his voice was shaky. "Huh, well. Guess I shouldn't be going around opening up golden dragon eggs, huh."
“Muggles have made up all sorts of things about magical beings,” he had explained. “For example, mermaids aren’t very nice at all.”
It was an awkward silence.
, Potter. Go bother somebody else with your goddamned hero complex. I’m sure there’s a lot who’d love to have your attention.”
He thinks he could fall in love with her again.
Draco snorted weakly. "Tell him he's worse than a Gryffindor. He's a Hufflepuff."
Apparently, it was easy to get Potter to look at him again. Potter whipped his head up to glare at him. "I already told you, Malfoy, just because I'm a vampire doesn't mean I go around fantasizing about sucking other people's blood. I… I'm not… I'm not a monster."
He had dreamed of buying the kid’s first broomstick and of James and Lily admonishing him for spoiling their son rotten.
He drained what was left inside his goblet. "So? Where's Potter? I still want to punch him."
, he did perform those manoeuvres. But he didn't think about it then, he just did what came naturally to him! He didn't think it would be a big deal; they really weren't that difficult. And besides, why was Draco angry anyway, what's it to him –
Severus bellowed, and this was it. This was one of the moments that Draco knew that Severus was really angry. No, not just angry. He was
he whispered, sank his fangs in Draco's neck, and
, kiddo,” Sirius said after he had hauled all off Harry’s new things to the side of the room. He slapped Harry heartily on the back and nearly knocked his glasses off.

Harry took one step back, ashamed and face burning with both embarrassment and anger.
already a given, but Harry still couldn't stop himself from feeling embarrassed about it. "I mean, you were underwater for an hour, too…"
He reached out and placed a hand on Harry’s back to guide him towards Platform 9 ¾. “Sirius is really serious, Harry.”
And Narcissa looks at him, really
He had done some exploring of the house, but most of it were just old, dusty rooms with cobwebs and spiders.
Harry shrugged. "A minute?"
one day during lunch when an unfamiliar owl drops an unsuspecting letter on his lap. It’s not his first time receiving hate mail, and so he’s not really surprised when he opens it and sees one line:
And Ron finally realized what this whole thing meant and paled at the prospect and just the general
"You're not going to die, Harry," Theodore sighed, as they were sitting in the Common Room playing another round of chess. As always, Harry was losing. "You're probably just going to be incapacitated, but nothing a few shots of Skele-Gro won't fix."
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm glad I did."
Draco repeated in his head, hand coming up to rest on his neck, which was as clear and smooth as it had always been. The wound had closed up nicely with the help of Madame Pomfrey's salve. Again, Madame Pomfrey didn't lie. The bite really did not scar.
He knew that they were just sending him away to keep him safe. That they were better off separated lest the Dark Lord use one of them as a bait to lure the others. He
That was just low.
Sitting in front the fireplace, alone in the common room with his blanket and the quiet to envelop him, the gravity of his situation slowly but surely started to sink in.
It’s been three months since the end of the war, since whatever happened between Ron and Hermione happened, but it’s the first time Harry has asked, mainly because it didn’t seem the right time then to talk about such things when Fred’s dead and Remus’ dead and they had to arrange all those funerals.
But Harry looked at him and he realized that Theodore was only joking, if his impish smirk was anything to go by. "How long have I been asleep?"
The crowd was deafening.
By then, Harry was feeling pretty proud of himself of having shut Draco up by having him do what he liked to do best – looking through Potions ingredients (without cleaning them). But the silence was also starting to become awkward, though Harry was sure that it was just him. It was almost unfair, how Harry was feeling so hyperconscious and sensitive to Draco's every movement and breath, while Draco was preoccupied only with his task of counting beetle legs.
going to stay in the same house as someone that bit him.
Harry, intent on defending his cat-person persona, fully stepped inside the living room, exposing to everyone present the pink apron that he was currently donning.
That was just the grip of someone who wanted to stay alive.
"Potter," Draco called out suddenly.
embarrassed, but also, he’s just very, very grateful.
As soon as he had stepped out of the Tent into the arena, he barely had time to jump behind a boulder before a burst of flames was sent his way. He was mentally screaming.
The next day, she Owls him in reply. At the end of her letter, she writes:

They reached out for the Cup at the same time.
for them to be just like James and Lily. That the Muggles would love Harry and care for him like he was their own and that toy cars and action figures would take the place of broomsticks and toy Snitches.
Draco snapped out of his stupor, at the same time Potter swerved in front of him and smacked a bludger away with his arm guard.
“Stop eating like a Neanderthal. You’re making a mess.”
Draco Malfoy?
Severus raised a warning eyebrow at Draco's sudden entrance.
Harry made the mistake of looking back, and saw, through the fire, smoke and the steam surrounding the gigantic body of the dragon, the slitted golden eyes that were intently locked on to him. A shiver ran down his body and he willed his broom faster. He needed to get that golden egg.
, Harry thinks, but keeps it to himself. “Yes, I have.”
Potter.”
Harry laid a hand on his chest, staring at the ceiling.
he kept on saying in his head.
Draco probably did, if his look of surprised confusion was anything to go by.
Harry rolled his eyes but grinned openly at him, even though he felt kind of stupid just sitting there and not saying anything.
, Draco felt the same waves of guilt crash down on him. He cleared his throat loudly. "Quite alright, Potter," he said. "I was only teasing."
Harry shook his head. "He's been busy talking with Professor Dumbledore. I've got Potions first thing tomorrow, so I'll talk to him then."
“I think so too.”
Draco looked as immaculate as ever, sitting under that arched window with a book open in his hands. The sunlight bounced off white-blond hair and Harry didn't think that it was possible to fall in love again.
"How many days has it been?" Draco asked with a little exasperation and haughtiness in his voice.
The man in black had fetched Harry from his room – His room. His own room! He didn’t have to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs anymore! – the next morning and walked with him towards a big, dining hall that was so tall and so wide that Harry thought it was funny that the long table in the middle of the room only occupied such a small space.
“Hermione’s pregnant,” he repeated patiently. “I don’t want to stress her out.”
“Alright.” Ron looks like he still wants to say something, and he almost does. He’s still looking at the floor, eyebrows furrowed, teeth worrying his lower lip, and his hand in a loose fist, but Harry sees the exact moment when he decides not to. “Alright, Harry.”
getting
One in the Forbidden Forest.
, he wrote. Ron raised an eyebrow at him, before looking back down at the parchment, waiting for him to write more. Harry closed his eyes and counted to five.
“I’m sorry about Crabbe,” he offered in return. That was one thing that still haunted him. For someone so young to die by his own spell, for a cause that was forcibly thrust upon him with no chance of him even questioning it.
Then he shrugged. He was Head Auror. Why not?
, Harry wrote with a snort.
to be that.
No one else had to get hurt because of Voldemort again. “Aside from the usual, I won’t let anything happen to you.”
What replaced his thunderous expression was a look of worry, as he surveyed Draco up and down, looking for any signs of damage.
Harry cuts him off before he really starts to go at it. “I’m happy to see you up on your feet again.”
Pansy rolled his eyes. "Hush now, Harry, don't you worry your pretty little head over it. Some girls love dark and broody boys."
"Where's Potter?" he found himself blurting out.
?” Draco exclaimed, eyebrows furrowing in confusion. “I mean, I suppose I shouldn’t complain, but
Remus was surprised that the object the boy had hid was merely a pencil. The surprise didn’t last long, however, when he thought of how the boy must have been longing for remnants of the Muggle world.
Dumbledore fixed him with a hard stare. “You know I trust you most in this, Severus. That is why I turned to you. And I also trust that you are mature enough to look past your animosity with Black and Lupin to accept that they will take care of the child as if he was their own.”
Draco was almost scared to ask. "What happened to…" He glanced at his father, not wanting to say the name.
Finally, she smiles again, real and genuine, one that reaches her eyes. “You’re nice,” she says once more. “I think I understand Draco a bit more now.”
He saw Viktor Krum swim to the farthest one on the left. Harry willed his webbed feet and hands to bring him nearer as fast as they could. He recognized the silhouettes one by one.
Narcissa sighs, soft and sad. “I hope you understand that I’m not trying justify what we did.”
The hooded figure continued, its voice trembling even more this time, as he procured a knife from his pocket.
“That’s why I asked Narcissa to let me borrow your books.”
“Six years too long,” Dumbledore had said sadly. Snape didn’t bother asking anymore. The last time he tried, he only got a multitude of riddles for his effort.
Too quiet, in fact.
He said it with such distaste that Draco realized that maybe Severus also wasn't good with animals.
And then –
Pansy narrowed her eyes at him. "It's awfully rude."
Draco thought, angry at how he was still impressed at Potter's maneuvers during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.
, Harry realized.
As Crabbe, Goyle, Draco and Parkinson were all sorted into Slytherin, Harry could feel his hands going clammy. He wanted to get into Slytherin too. What was the point of meeting all these new friends if he was just going to get sorted into another house?
“Oh, this is new,” he heaved out between bursts of laughter.
“No, it’s… I’m…” Potter paused, pressing his lips tightly once again. He turned back to his treacle tart with a sigh. “I’m working on it, okay? I’m trying to figure it out.”
He swallows thickly, and looks up to comment that they’re a bit tight, but Draco is staring at him, stunned and speechless.
“Mistletoe!” Seamus yelled gleefully.
Tentatively, the child’s arms fell down and he peeked through messy bangs at the man with the moon behind him.
He’s sobbing, head buried in his lap, and whole body trembling in his wheelchair.
The Malfoy Manor is dark and cold by the time Harry arrives in the ungodly hour of 3 AM. It is Christmas Day, and the world is right to be cold, and Harry brushes away the snow off the shoulders of his coat. He pats it down, shakes the snow off his hair, before stepping out of the Floo.
He had imagined the boy running away in fear or crying or locking himself up in his room, but none of those happened in any of the times that Snape levitated a feather, transfigured the chair into a table, or introduced Gritty the House Elf to him.
Harry shrugged. "I spent an hour in the baths for it."
And then quiet.
had caused it.
Sirius’ smile turned soft. “I think you’d be very sad,” he joked to keep the mood uplifted.
And Narcissa nods, doesn’t offer meaningless words of comfort, just the understanding of the reality that he is not okay.
Harry flushed hotly, suddenly feeling insecure. He’d spent last night after Ron and the cat left wallowing in his misery like a kicked puppy before he decided to fix his things for the party and saw the Christmas gifts that he had prepared for Draco a few days ago. And just like that, kicked puppy became reckless dog as his inner Gryffindor gave him daring ideas (in the name of throwing all caution into the wind to get what you want) that his inner Slytherin ineffectively warned him not to follow (in the name of self-preservation to survive another day).
Just like that, there is a flash of hurt in Draco’s face. “What did you expect? A–“
And in the midst of that silence, Harry could hear… A hiss.
“Good on you, Harry dear,” Rosmerta said as soon as the doors gave a click. She smiled at him, ruby-red lips curled up into a knowing smile. “I always tell you that Kingsley here deserves a good yelling at, just one or two.”
"That's okay," Draco said. "It's Saturday. You can call your house elf friends of yours and we'll stay here."
She then looked at Malfoy, a proud smile on her face. “Mister Malfoy. This is a very brave thing you’re doing.”
"The Goblet has chosen," Dumbledore said gravely. "And it has chosen Harry as its fourth Champion."
Potter still hasn’t let go of his hand. “Well then, has it convinced you?”
He dutifully did not comment on the way her eyes became glassy.
There’s a sound of a bed creaking, and Draco can imagine that Potter’s gone and made himself at home on the other, nearest bed.
He needed something else to do to get his mind off these things.
Harry frowns at her. “Why would I do that?” he asks incredulously, but he already knows why.
He remembered what happened a few days ago, when they had last talked about the Jinx. He still had doubts on whether Draco was the one who wrote the words
He hated it sometimes. The hatred that Voldemort had instilled in him. That still kept him locked in this endless chase of redemption.
Harry felt like his face was going to break because of his grin.
"Potter!"
. If only I had known that Severus was actually keeping something like thathere, I would have sent you to your Aunt Anabelle.”
“Talk to me again when I’ve sobered,” he muttered, and winced when the effort of talking sent a lance of pain through his head. “
Draco Malfoy was a smart man. Harry could see the moment when the confusion gave way to realization and then—
“Head-Healing Draught for Victims of Crucio,” Draco repeated patiently. “The normal draughts don’t work as fast as I want them to.”
,” moaned Draco mournfully.
Draco could almost hear it.
Harry raised an eyebrow at him.
But years dragged on and the rashes didn’t stop coming.
Narcissa closed her eyes, and said quietly, "The Manor. He's there."
After defeating the giant spider together, he and Cedric had spent quite a while arguing on who should get the Triwizard Cup first. Blasted Diggory and his honor. It was annoying as it was really, really admirable. If he could just get through the fog of the pain in his leg right now, Harry could say that he was genuinely impressed.
"Remember what I told you about beating dragons!" Sirius yelled.
"Of course not," Madame Pomfrey replied easily. Not missing a beat, she opened the cupboard near Draco's bed and procured a vial with clear liquid. She presented it to Draco. "Drink this, Mr. Malfoy, it should help with the headache."
Seven horcruxes. Each one had been a vessel of a corrupted power, created by way of murder, an essence desperately clinging to immortality by feeding on the souls of others…
down. They finally had Harry.
Hands grabbed at his pocket –
“Speak of the devil,” Draco muttered dryly.
Hermione was mollified for the time being.
, he thought, but couldn't say it. Even if he could, he didn't know
weird to suddenly wake up and have your long-time enemy in your house eating your pancakes. “Yeah.”
They made their way towards the Slytherin Common Room, with Harry itching to get out of his uniform and figure out what the hell was supposed to do with the golden egg in the pocket of his robes. But peace and quiet, Harry thought with a mental whimper as he got sight of the Common Room, was too much to ask for.
Harry sat back in confusion. What did Sirius mean?
Harry grinned proudly at the cat which was now curled up on the doormat. “Good job, cat.”
“I will not have the Golden Boy killed by a Dark Magic accident.
Draco gulped it down, taking care not to let his disgust show in his face. Malfoys drank medicine with grace, even if it did taste like goblin feet.
Draco walked over, got his own, and passed Potter's to him. Before opening the door, however, he looked back over the shoulder and asked, awkwardly, "Are you sure you're…?"
When he closes his eyes, he can still remember the heat of the flames of Fiendfyre licking his clothes. Draco screaming
Narcissa smiles that same amused smile. “You are kind. Remember, Harry. The world isn’t nice to kind people.”
Harry’s eyes widens, waving his hands, the denial immediately on his lips. “Oh, no! No, no, no. It’s fine, Gin, I’m not avoiding you, if that’s what you’re thinking. That’s not it at all.”
"Where's Potter right now?" Draco scowled.
Well, you’re not an older brother to her,
He’d be angry, but his head was a haze of exhaustion and, to be honest, Potter at the moment was looking as horrible as he felt.
broody –"
They were talking about something. A girl. Potter’s girl. Oh. Weasley.
Voldemort’s magic still existed. Persisted. Lingering in the places where their vessels had been destroyed. Harry unconsciously lifted a hand to lay on his chest, right where Voldemort’s Killing Curse had hit him. He swallowed thickly yet again.
, if he really did read those words. It could have been just a dream, or – or his imagination, or something.
“I guess. Err.” Harry pauses by the door. “Can I come in?”
Ron stands up, stretches, and gives him a little grin. “Aren’t you hungry?”
“Ginny, flirt with Harry,” Ron rushed out in a low voice as he narrowly avoided the Traveling Mistletoe (courtesy of George Weasley) and sidled up next to his sister in front of the food table.
He landed in the Ministry, taking just a few seconds to brush Floo powder off his robes, before walking briskly towards the lift.
Crucio, wasn’t it?
was a lie.
The expression on Potter’s face changed into one of surprise, as if he hadn’t expected that Draco would notice.
It had disappeared the moment Harry defeated Voldemort.
Harry and Draco’s head automatically turned to look around the room, searching for the latest victims of the Traveling Mistletoe, only to realize that everyone in the room was looking back at them.
Did Potter know about that?
Ron, also under a Glamour, had already boarded ahead of them, as planned. People will be expecting them to come together in a group of three, Hermione had explained. Any group of three students will automatically be a target of scrutiny, no matter how good their Glamours were.
Ron raised an eyebrow at the redness of Harry’s ears. “Right,” he said with a cough. “Malfoy or not, I’ve only ever flirted with Hermione for the past ten years, and, well, you know her.” He shrugged, nose scrunching up. “She’s not exactly susceptible to, ah,
