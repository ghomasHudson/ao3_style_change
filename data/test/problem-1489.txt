“It was kind,” Draco agreed. “She’d like me to marry, and be happy. I know it’s hard to hear, but once, she and my father were very good together. But my father wanted power, and my mother wanted… respectability, and happiness.” Draco slipped his hand from Harry’s hip to his lower back. They were almost flush together.
Harry shook his head. “No.”
A miserable-looking boy in Hufflepuff colours raised his hand. “My Kneazle ate mine.”
Draco opened the box and lifted the wand, and Harry felt the resonance right away.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at him, and Harry laughed.
He got a number of his wishes right away, all in one go, late in the afternoon, when Harry stormed into his quarters with such ebullience and energy that it nearly stopped Draco’s heart in his chest. His eyes went very wide, as he took in the room — apparently, he’d forgotten that Narcissa was coming back to finish her decorating today and apparently, he liked it.
“Why did he do this, Draco?”
“Lie, again. Anyway. You’ve acknowledged it. And he’s gone.”
“Only if I can look at you.”
“You know you don’t have to keep cooking like this,” she said.
,” Harry replied, with a broad smile on his face. “On three.”
have a million galleons, thanks to a series of stepfathers with deep pockets — but I was never stupid enough to bet against Pans.”
“So what usually happens to your post, Harry?” he asked, and Harry shook his head, smiling.
Hermione held his gaze. She looked tired, suddenly. But she forced a smile. “I know. And I love you, too. I guess I just wish that you could find a way to love
Parvati took the rear, silent, watchful, competent.
Harry took Draco’s hand, and Andromeda linked elbows with him, as they began the walk back to the apparition point.
, Blaise. I intend to write up his case notes for his next Healer because I know that one day very soon I will return to my house after work or I’ll wake up in the morning and there will be a painfully polite note left thanking me for my hospitality and ensuring I know where to send my bill. And I’ll never lay eyes on him again.”
“I say, Thomas, your face.” Draco’s face was gentle. Always important to make
That night, Harry stretched out in his bed and scratched Dora’s very small, and currently colourful, head. Pretty little thing. She shone when she was happy.
Neither Draco. The young, terrified Draco in the bathroom with tears burning his face, or the now-Draco. The stakes had never been this high. He’d win or fail here tonight.
“I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.”
Draco snorted. “They lost a lot, and it was my fault.”
“I didn’t say that.” Hermione spoke very carefully, and slowly, which made it sound like she thought Harry might not understand what she was saying. But Harry knew her much too well. “What I was trying to say — Ron? Would you like some more pie?”
He could have reminded Potter again that he was rubbish at potions but twice in five minutes felt a little fourth-year, if he was honest. Plain old-fashioned ignoring seemed like a better option.
He was ready to do this. He was. But if anyone in the history of Big Decisions ever claimed not to have had a single moment’s pause, they were lying. Being unsure was what made those decisions big.
Draco spluttered his own glass of wine so badly he nearly choked. It took him a good two minutes to get his breath back. His mother spent those two minutes examining her nails and taking another sip of wine. And to compound his fury, embarrassment, and other emotions that were making his face go from pale, to pink, to tomato red and onward to something that was probably rather better characterised as aubergine, she didn’t even bother to follow it up with an apology, or a clarification, or anything at all that might predispose him not to surrender her to the Janus Thickey ward to live out her last hundred or so years.
He dabbed at his eyes with his napkin again. “Merlin, why did you make me snort that rubbish out of my nose? Now I…”
. Time to meet Luna and Blaise for dinner at the Leaky.
Harry took a deep breath, and looked Draco directly in the eyes. “Because it was a disgusting, unforgivable violation of his privacy, and I knew stopping was the right thing to do.”
“Please don’t hate me when you wake up,” he begged, quietly. “You’re so much a part of me now that I couldn’t bear it.”
Granger’s jaw set hard again, and she met his eyes. Her own were rimmed in red.
“He’s staying with me for a while.”
“I don’t know any good stories.”
. Draco cringed. There had never been a Malfoy, nor a Black, who had a particular respect for the privacy of others, but she had found Harry’s other photographs and framed them. Harry seemed to be spellbound, and only the sudden tremor in his shoulders told Draco that he was choking back a sob.
Draco let the tips of his fingers kiss Harry’s shoulder, and then he silently climbed off the bed.
“I know. I just have a story to tell you. And some advice I’d like to ask you. And then… I’ll go, or I’ll stay. I’ll leave that up to you.”
“My pleasure,” Draco replied, hands in the pockets of his grey trousers, nodding.
“So many beautiful old things,” Mrs Malfoy said, with a sigh. “So much old, old magic.” Her attention was caught by a clasp for robes, and Harry made a mental note.
“Dunno what beats getting murdered,” he said. “Also, this list is bloody terrifying.”
The Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom was much as Harry remembered, if it bore the marks of repair. He had forgotten the door carefully hidden in the back that led to a clean, warm suite; small, but perfectly adequate. A bed in the corner, a couch and two armchairs (as if he intended to entertain) and a desk for his work. He had been in this room once before, with Remus, and it saddened him to know the man was lost to him.
“I haven’t, much.” Harry joined Draco on the couch, sitting near his bare feet, long and pale with a dusting of gold hair. “I suppose I’ve slept enough for about a year.”
Hermione snickered at Draco, which he liked; it suggested she was a lot more comfortable with him these days and also much more able to tell when he was joking (he had no idea why the Golden Trio had always been so thick about this, but they were).
Draco sucked air through his teeth as Harry bit it gently. “No. Just regular Muggle tattoos… Potter, please…”
Draco forced another chuckle. “Naughty woman. Alright. Go on, then, off with you, anonymous source
Harry rolled them over without dislodging himself, and Draco clamped his legs tightly around Harry’s hips. The spark wasn’t just in his eyes. The air all around them had begun to crackle like it was full of fireworks, burning their skin and making the air somehow thinner and richer at the same time.
“No, Headmaster McGonagall,” he agreed. “We’re not.”
But first;
Rolling his eyes, Draco replied in beautiful script that he was not above Obliviating Harry until he thought he was twenty again and then persuading him to join a professional Quidditch team.
“I’d prefer to at least do it somewhere we’re less likely to be observed by Mother’s very sophisticated guests. Or Mother,” he added, though in truth he thought she would probably just silently slip upstairs to the library and start enquiring about wedding venues in June. He groaned and he felt Harry’s sharp little teeth in his lower lip, and his hips shifted forward.
“I asked,” Draco said, as Blaise poured him another drink. “How he was found. That’s all it says, in the file. He was

before,” he admitted.
He tossed his own wand to the ground, startled by the hollow, wooden sound it made as it clattered on the tiles.
They ate in silence for a while, and Harry found that once he had a little food in his stomach he was actually quite hungry. He took his time, though, unwilling to press his luck. The cold hum of humiliation needed to remain a hum, and not become a roar.
“I probably have a few things I need to figure out,” Harry said, but what he was thinking was ‘
“If I don’t get to do that myself, I think I should at least be able to watch,” Harry complained.
. I guess that will do.” It wasn’t very thorough and Harry’s sleeve was soon sticky where his arm had been resting but he thought it was probably a reasonable go for the first time in several months.
Neville stared after him for a moment, and then shook his head at Draco.
Harry kissed Draco’s forehead. “My life would be so much easier if I did.” His body hummed; not with arousal, with something else. A promise for the future, maybe. At least, a promise to try. Which was the only promise anyone could ever make.
a chance, though.”
“In this weather? It’ll be packed to the rafters and it’ll take two hours to get fed. We’ll just eat here.”
“You poor dear,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes hard enough so that the seventh year Slytherins could hear it at the very back of the room. “Perhaps you’d like to see the headline from my first day. It might cheer you up.
Harry was an Auror again.
’? No, that one was more of a question.”
“No,” Harry said. He looked at his shoes. They were not the sort of shoes that worked in Malfoy Manor. He wished he’d polished them.
It was hours before he had time to read the parchment.
Andromeda cried, a little. She hugged a lot. She talked about how it might be nice to be able to spend time with some of her old friends, now that Tom Riddle was dead.
It was, of course, a singularly dreadful item of clothing. Draco didn’t know why one might smash a pumpkin or why the commemoration of such might be worth a t-shirt, but he dragged it over his head. He gazed at himself in the mirror for a long moment. Respectable trousers, travesty of a shirt; seemed appropriate.
still saw him the way he always had. The way some other people always would. Harry thought he might throw up.
Thank you so much for coming on this adventure with me :)
Harry.
sentence, either. Harry chanced a look at Draco. He’d never been any good at concealing his emotions. Apparently that hadn’t changed. A tear rolled down his cheek, despite his attempt to keep his face neutral, and Harry looked away.
“Please, will you let me — just let me try again?”
at the pan, and while it ruined the pancakes, the amount of smoke billowing in the air reduced significantly.
“He won’t,” Harry said, and if it hurt a little to remind himself that he and Draco would probably never lay eyes on each other again, then that was alright.
Harry nodded, and turned to kiss Hermione’s hair.
“Probably eight years,” he said. “I was sure this was what I wanted. I truly was. I worked hard for it, and I know my defensive magic better than anyone else on the team —”
“Why, Draco?”
When he glanced left, Harry sodding Potter was coming at him at a terrifying speed, smiling from ear to ear; and just as Draco was starting to worry that Harry hadn’t seen him, he screeched to a dramatic halt, only a couple of feet away.
“I didn’t say anything, though.”
Teddy frowned, and tried to think through it all. He bit his lip, and his hair turned a soft violet. He eventually seemed to make up his mind, though. “Yes,” he said, nodding at Draco. “And you can come.”
“Yes,” she said. “I’ll be back next weekend to finish up. And he’s on his way here to join us for a drink, so you might smarten your hair up a little. There’s plenty of time to discuss the rest.”
“Thank you,” Harry replied, embarrassed. “Are you sure, though?”
“Just follow my movements,” Draco said, and Harry wondered where exactly the nearest volcano was. “When I step forward, you step back, and so forth. I promise not to dip you. I wouldn’t want all the blood to rush to your head and make you swoon.”
“This is Harry Potter we’re talking about. Dying for the people he loves was probably one of his better days. Sodding martyr,” Draco finished, grumbling, and climbing to his feet. “I have to get back to him.”
“No,” Draco said, and in a rush, he knew exactly where he needed to go. “Please. One more. If you want to go, after that — fine, we’ll rest on the couch until you’re dead and I’m sobbing. Wondering what might have been.”
Mollified, Draco slanted his chin.
“Weeks?” Luc pouted again. He was wearing eyeliner, a little mascara, as if he needed anything to make him look prettier than he already was, with his messy black hair and his green eyes. “
Harry felt something ugly coil in his heart. He pointed to a photograph of himself and Ron and Hermione, in a small frame on the desk. He had a few others, but they all hurt too much to display. The Order of the Phoenix in 1981, his mother’s softly curved belly and Sirius’s proud smile. He was barely able to look at them, the way they reminded him of everything he had lost.
“Are you alright?”
“You certainly have, dear boy.” He might have bristled at the endearment from almost anyone else but Madam Shacklebolt used it on everyone south of sixty.
“And the two of you can fight to the death over whoever sent them to me.”
“Perhaps I’m overtired,” Draco said.
“Thank you again, Mrs Malfoy,” he murmured, without meeting her eyes. “Travel safely.”
“Never mind. Let’s get you another drink. Did you try Blaise’s home-made gin?”
, to do absolutely nothing, to rest. I didn’t even know what I would do with a day like that. But I knew if he… if
A deathly silence had come over the shop, the house, and possibly all of Diagon Alley. Harry sighed, and closed his eyes, and climbed the stairs with Hermione trailing behind him.
“I couldn’t look at him, Draco. You know, he never once asked us to help. He didn’t. And he planned to go by himself and we said he was an idiot for thinking we wouldn’t follow anyway. And then, in the end… I loved him, I did, but I hated what we went through because we were his friends. And there were days when I hated him for it.”
He brought his wand down close to Harry’s face and checked that his pupils were still responsive to the soft
Just lovely.
Students would be sleeping in. Breakfast was a lazier affair on Saturdays, served until the late morning, and he had no pressing need to do anything else. So he took his broom down from the hooks over his desk, dressed warmly, and set out into the castle. He saw no one but an old grey cat chasing a mouse in the direction of the Hufflepuff dormitories.
Draco almost choked.
It was probably time to accept that things were just not going to be the same again.
The dragon, the enormous snake — Draco forced himself to look, this time, and it was so much worse. Dementors rushing at him. It seemed a little excessive, if it was intended to keep someone out, but Draco hadn’t ever experienced anything like it. He felt the sharp pain of the dislocated shoulder and the smack to the back of the head, and he felt himself go entirely numb.
“My silencing charms are second to none. Wait, no, I’ll take those Galleons. I do miss being rich.”
Draco looked at Harry’s wand, raised, ready. He could still attack; but would he have? All of those years ago — would Harry have struck first? Or had he only been defending himself?
“He was
It was interesting that Granger hadn’t come out and told him that Potter didn’t even have a partner, though.
“I had eleven, in nine years,” he said. “Apparently I’m not easy to work with.”
“Draco,” Harry said, yawning and stretching. He was careful to shift on the couch in just the way that would make his jumper ride up at his hip, exposing a little skin. “There you are. Missed you.”
“This looks good,” Harry said, uneasy. The food looked tasty — a pile of very fresh looking salad and some warm risotto, but the thought of eating anything was uncomfortable. “I don’t know if —”
“That’s not a chair,” Draco snapped.
Maybe this hadn’t been the day for it. He couldn’t help but wish they’d been able to be alone, curled up together on the couch somewhere (preferably naked) and exploring each other, and what this could be, with no obligations and no one to bother them. But a declaration made on an auspicious date is traditional, and it mattered to Draco, no matter how he planned to mess up all the Pureblood traditions he was so fond of by getting Harry into bed before the Winter term began. He’d managed to keep his hands off Harry for this long, despite the rapid rekindling of a decades-old crush that had quickly moved to something much more serious — and if the heat of Harry’s kisses earlier were anything to go by, he didn’t seem particularly inclined to wait either.
“I read,” Harry said.
The expression on his face was entirely peaceful. He looked as if he’d taken a book to bed, and simply died, right there.
Draco’s expression was odd. Fond, but bemused. Still he couldn’t resist looking at that flash of pale skin.
“Harry,” Draco said, just as Harry thought he might drift off to sleep again. “There’s something I’d like to try, if you’re up for it.”
“So fucking beautiful,” Harry said. “I don’t care why you showed up here that night. I’m just glad you’re here. Stay with me, Draco. Will you?”
“Is it still tradition once the family name has been sullied beyond all repair?” He hated the way his mother smarted at the words. “Alright. I apologise. Who did you have in mind? And please don’t forget that by tradition I can veto anyone you might suggest.”
“You do remember,” Draco said. “Harry. You
“How do you feel about Harry?” he asked.
Harry reached across the board and closed his hand over Ron’s clenched fists.
his words.”
Harry didn’t even reply.
“Er,” Harry said, and then Hermione was pulling away and taking off her gloves. Ron shook his hand. Upstairs it felt as if the entire house had taken a deep breath and didn’t intend to let it go. “I was going to meet you at the Burrow,” Harry said. This would be it. If Draco heard these two he’d definitely climb out a window and run away and Harry would never find out what had happened.
“Famous Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, a house-elf?” For a moment Draco sounded dismissive, and then his expression shifted to wariness. Harry could barely see it from the corner of his eye but it was there.
“I usually leave here about noon,” Harry replied, already missing the weight of Draco’s head in his lap.
of yours? Your meditation? I haven’t seen you this agitated since we were in school.”
“Dumbledore made the right decision and I do not regret my part in it.”
Harry’s gaze flicked across the room to where Draco lay, and for a moment the look of hunger in his eyes was so raw that Draco thought he might have come down with some fantastically debauched intent, and then he settled the Auror mask back down over his features.
Harry blanched, and Draco cringed inwardly. No doubt a mistake like that would not have been tolerated too well by Harry’s Muggle family. He regretted his tone. A lazy wave of his wand set the tea service to brewing, and Draco focused on his sandwiches again.
And they smiled at each other, and smiled at each other, and smiled some more at each other. Harry hadn’t felt so close to Hermione since Ron had left them alone on their mission to collect Horcruxes.
“I’m not surprised at all. You haven’t done any magic in several months, and you need to start again soon, or it will get harder and harder to start again. You can start small.
“Side-along,” Harry agreed, and Draco took his elbow.
you’re propositioning.” Gabrielle laughed, and patted his shoulder, and Hermione made her way around some of the other tables.
Draco held his eyes, challenging. And Harry realised it truly wasn’t any of his business. He was unaccountably glad that Draco was there, in his house, even if he was being especially obtuse. But what Draco chose to share with him, or not, was up to him.
The first kiss was not perfect but it was very nearly so, and perhaps it was more perfect for its imperfection. It was warm, and tentative; affectionate and wary.
). Saturday was busy in the shop. Draco was a ghost upstairs, sleeping a lot, eating a little, and keeping out of sight.
It was quiet in the house, though. He felt suddenly uneasy. “Draco?” he called. No answer.
“Terribly embarrassing,” Harry replied, drily. “Very unlike you snorting bats. And can I remind you that I managed to toss a
“We should.”
. Badly enough to have asked the person he hated most in the world for it. Harry pushed himself up onto his feet and crossed the room to the bed. Draco, mercifully, appeared to still be asleep. Deeply asleep. Harry ran his fingers over that silky, spiky head, but Draco’s eyes didn’t so much as flutter. He had to be completely fucking exhausted. Under the last of his makeup Harry could see dark shadows under his eyes. They looked like bruises.
Hermione nodded dumbly.
“Don’t owe me that, either.”
Harry heard most of it; but mostly, he was marvelling at the fluttering under his hand.
“Well, it’s gone,” Blaise said. He took two impossibly fluid steps and settled himself behind Hermione, one arm around her chest and the other, her hips.
Harry lay beside Draco and breathed into his bicep, thrilling to the aftershocks, his cock over-sensitised and sticky.
At the foot of the staircase, Harry and Draco said their goodnights. But just before he headed for the stairs down to the dungeons, Draco paused.
“You are most welcome. Just those finishing touches next Saturday, Harry,” Narcissa said. “Do sit down. This is elf-made wine, very fine.”
“Good,” Hermione said. “Go on.”
Draco spent several seconds staring out into a crevasse of rocks and burning shrubs in absolute horror, wishing that he had considered literally any other branch of Healing — indeed, any other
Harry, drunk, had repeated this back to Blaise one night. Blaise had roared with laughter and said he thought he was getting rather the better deal, there.)
“Might have,” Harry replied.
“Topher. Right, then.” Ron stepped carefully past the portrait of Walburga Black and directed Topher into the sitting room. “Hermione — the Minister — said I should help you find anything you need, and that you could take anything you need away with you. So…?”
But no, it seemed he couldn’t interact, here. His hand went through Harry’s shoulder and Harry didn’t so much as flinch.
Nothing happened.
“Harry Potter,” Draco said, frowning, narrowing his eyes. “Did you just invoke
He was shifting his weight from foot to foot right outside Flourish and Blotts, when Narcissa Malfoy approached him, cool and collected.
It was strange. The last time they’d seen each other was at Narcissa’s funeral and though Harry hadn’t thought they’d been exactly warm with each other, they had been passably civil.
Harry nodded, leaning into him.
, though.”
The moment she saw the woman enter the room, Hermione stood up, slipping a bookmark between the heavy vellum pages and setting the tome on the side table.
“You thought what, I’d come in here and shout at him for abandoning us, bully him into explaining where he’s been the last few years? Shout at him for being such an inconsiderate numpty?” Harry raised his eyebrows. “Right. Fair enough,” Pansy said, and dropped her shoulders. “But why did he come here?”
of yours, who by the way sounds very, very handsome. If you confessed this gross violation of his privacy. Assuming he didn’t toss you out on your arse, of course.”
“Healer Black,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting you.”
“That’s quite possible,” Draco said, pretending he wasn’t stifling a yawn.
“Harry is trapped in a world he has constructed for himself. The general layout is Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. Not as it is now — usually — but a home, light and airy and full of memories and lies. Most of the doors are locked or boarded up in some way, though I have managed to find my way into several of them, now. These are the memories. Things he can’t escape from but won’t examine, either. Things I doubt he has ever really spoken of. Including his childhood in Little Whingeing.” He pointed to a room on the map that Hermione knew had once been a nursery. “A bathroom I have come to understand is probably the Chamber of Secrets at Hogwarts, here. Complete with large, angry snake, and more green smoke than I generally prefer to breathe in. Descending into the larder in the basement, I found myself trapped in a memory of Harry appearing before the entire Wizengamot after conjuring a fully corporeal Patronus charm to save himself and that awful fucking cousin of his. In the memory, he is about the size of a Kneazle kitten and his feet don’t touch the floor, while everyone on the Wizengamot… well, they look like Dementors themselves, if I’m honest.”
“Abuse?”
Late that Friday night, as he lay in bed, wondering when sleep might come, he found his gaze drawn to his broom.
“I shall take that as a compliment. I was a right little tosser.”
Firewhiskey.”
His companion, who was already hooked, shrugged. “Post-post-pop punk, really, but they have a pretty high opinion of themselves and call it something else — I don’t know.”
“Because most restaurants frown upon people eating naked, and as soon as you talk me out of my clothes I’m going nude for the rest of the day. You can start any time, you know. I’m in the mood. Want me to beg? You know how pretty I can beg. Draco, what’s the matter? You look…”
“I was nearly sorted into Slytherin myself,” he said. “Is it fun, sleeping under the lake? D’you ever see the giant squid?”
Draco stared for a long time.
When Draco woke, the following morning, he had an almost unbearable need to fly.
“Unlike Gregory Goyle?”
Draco inched closer, and kissed him a second time.
“Christopher Black’s Villa,
Draco offered a polite smile. “You’re so full of shit that those green eyes of yours have begun to turn a fetching shade of brown, Potter.” Neville snorted. “You didn’t tell me you were out of Dreamless Sleep.”
He opened his eyes again, and met Draco’s gaze. He looked… fucking exhausted, is what, drained and pale and uncomfortable, fingers hiding in the sleeves of what Draco suddenly recognised as an old hoodie that Harry had worn as a child, too big for him but comfortable, despite the chewed edges of the neckband. He looked like he was grieving. Perhaps he was.
“Harry Potter,” Malfoy said, leaning forward in the chair. “This room is an abomination. And it’s so
“Draco,” he said, wondering. “Always Draco. Even when he’s angry.” He elected not to add that Harry sometimes called him ‘Malfoy’ when he was trying to talk him out of his clothes.
“Come on, Daisy — oh, would you stop trying to pull your hair from its braid, you look like a werewolf!”
“You wanted to catch up!”
“Well, he’d be fucked, then,” Draco said, after a long moment, his entire body language shifting. “That was some seriously romantic bollocks, despite all the terrible stalking.”
“Did you?” Draco said. “And why would I do that,
Hermione nodded slowly. The thought of Harry having kept something from them hurt her physically, but it was possible.
Hermione nodded tightly.
There was absolutely no good reason for it. But rather than fudge an answer of some kind or, worse, tell the truth — Draco ignored the question.
Mrs Malfoy was too well-bred to comment on the bald-faced lie, and Harry found himself curling his shoulders inward. Once again trying to take up less space.
“You need to,” he said. “Because I’m missing something, and I don’t know what it is.” Hermione shivered, crossing her arms over her chest. Draco cast a warming charm, seemingly without really noticing. He probably hadn’t; just making sure they could do what needed to be done. Immensely practical. But then, in many ways, he’d always been that way.
“First year,” Hermione said. “The Philosopher’s Stone. The first time Harry saw Voldemort.”
Strangely enough, it was Ron who cast the deciding vote. “He wanted you to read it, or he wouldn’t have said it wasn’t sealed. The pointy git might be a… pointy git, but if he wanted you to know… whatever that is, then I think you should read it. Otherwise, it’s like throwing it back in his face, innit?”
“Well, then,” he said. “
“Always the full cock with you.”
“I don’t
The only public appearance Harry Potter made during his eighth year at Hogwarts was on the 2
“You got your inclinations towards the dramatic from your father, you know. The Blacks were never so theatrical.”
“I couldn’t decide if you were suddenly speechless at my extraordinary skill, or leading up to some kind of very moving oration — I took a chance and guessed the latter, Potter. A thank you will suffice.”
“It does, though,” Draco said, letting Harry escape, and stepping closer. “There’s probably some lovely things down there. Just think. Cheeses, and cured meats…”
Harry laughed, and handed over his second paper bag full of duck food. Blaise looked pleased. He tossed a handful over the ground and smiled as he watched them all waddle across the grass.
“Draco said you can take me to the Manor,” she said.
But he could see what would happen. He saw Amelia’s fragile confidence vanish, going back to Bath to live with her Squib parents and never knowing the joy of letting her magic unfurl beneath her skin.
“You’ll stay a while, won’t you?” she asked.
Hermione sighed. “I think he just couldn’t bear to be at Hogwarts anymore. Knowing what he’d lost. Those memories. Is there anything else?”
Draco’s eyes widened, and sparkled. “I see. Brown-nosers. What does that have to do with me?”
“Perhaps you could slow down a little, Harry. Will I make tea?”
“Not him.” Draco rested his head on his knees. “
“You don’t want them to get hurt.”
Draco withdrew his wand, polishing it absently, and set his feet into a fighting stance.
And then, of course, he went to work. Because he also had a lot to do.
And no Harry. And no Draco.
Draco had opened a drawer, and he was staring into it, looking almost green (the effect of someone almost paper white actually getting paler) and strangely perturbed. After a long moment, he shrugged, and withdrew a small package wrapped in gold paper with a big white ribbon.
Adults, though?
“You’re not hallucinating,” Harry said. “Alright, Draco?”
“I need a House-elf,” he said. One apparated with a loud crack, and squawked. “Get me Professor Potter.”
She wasn’t really a twit.
Harry shook his head, and sped down the corridor. “I’m sure it’s for a good reason. When Sirius comes back from his holidays I’ll ask him.” Down the stairs. Away from the strange hint of something being very wrong upstairs, Draco’s strange questions. It was his day off. He didn’t want to think about doors and things. He wanted to argue about the crossword and eat breakfast and get a shag and stretch out on the couch with his head on Draco’s thigh while Draco read out loud.
“I can’t see it,” she said.
But then, he had to admit: if they had asked him, he would have said he didn’t care. And if they’d warned him, he would have said it didn’t matter.
“No, it’s all about completing this stage in our education,” Hermione said.
The way he’d spat
It wasn’t obvious and it wasn’t easy and it required interpretation. Was the base water, or distilled water, or the water of life? Was it a mercurial base? Dry ether or one of the precious oils? You needed to be able to read the colours and the thrumming and all the rest of it, or you’d get it wrong, and you might kill someone, and Draco had so many fucking regrets in his life that a mistake made when someone was already vulnerable was an impossible risk.
Ron felt his skin crawl.
“I shouldn’t have been sarcastic,” he said, quietly. “There’s something about being back here that brings out the nasty little shithead I was back in school. I’m actually rather nice, these days, not that I’d expect anyone to believe me.”
“Giant prat,” Draco said, satisfied. “Fine, I’ll marry you. But not until you’ve grovelled adequately over the whole stalking me across Europe thing.”
“I’ll go,” Malfoy said, and he pulled the curtain back.
And then came a Saturday afternoon when Harry, ensconced in marking seventh-year essays on the difference between shapeshifters and werewolves, heard a knock on his door. The classroom door; he had been taking great pains to ensure it was locked, just then, since he had a number of fairly nasty things about the place and no desire to let any student set them free.
In the summer, with children coming to buy their wands, Harry was so busy he had to hire a shop assistant. He hired a Hogwarts student, Ellie Greenteeth, whose parents were both Healers at St Mungo’s. She was intelligent and friendly and reminded him of Hermione, her head in a book every time she had a spare minute. She was in Slytherin. She’d told him so with her chin held high, daring him to assume she ate kittens for dessert or something, but Harry only nodded.
“But Harry — you’re important too,” he said. “Not because you’re Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, The Boy Who Lived, and winner of Witch Weekly’s Most Charming Smile Award too many times to count. Not because you’re a skilled Auror, and you have a chocolate frog card in your honour. Just because… because you’re a
“It does on your day off.”
“I was afraid we might have really lost you,” she admitted. “And you’re — you’re healthy?”
to embrace him when he arrived at the gates of Hogwarts. She didn’t look as if she had aged a day since last he had seen her, and it made Harry wonder again just how old she was. Still walking tall and proud.
The house wasn’t at all what Harry would have imagined. It wasn’t icy and clean like the Manor; it felt lived-in, even if Draco did claim not to spend a lot of time there. A pile of books was stacked untidily on the coffee table in front of the fireplace and the large corner couch was overstuffed and rumpled and looked very comfortable indeed. The place was full of oddities he looked forward to exploring when he had a lot more energy and the scent of wintergreen simmering slowly in a cauldron told Harry exactly where Draco’s potions laboratory was.
Harry stared for a long moment, and then nodded hastily and left.
It had been a long time since Harry had been romantically entangled with anyone but his own hand, and after days of what he now recognised as sexual frustration he knew it wasn’t going to take long. And couldn’t bring himself to care, either, knowing they had all evening and all night and ideally the rest of their lives to do this. Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head and he wrapped his arm tight around Harry’s neck, muttering, gasping, begging into his ear before his body locked up tight and he came hard into the narrow space between their bodies, digging his nails into Harry’s shoulder until Harry was quite sure he’d broken the skin. The expression on his face drove Harry over the edge as well, and he let out a very undignified grunt.
Suddenly it seemed like such a crappy present, but when Harry managed to meet Draco’s eyes, he didn’t look like he thought it was a crappy present. He looked… intrigued. Even awed.
“What time is Blaise getting here? I’m dying to taste the steak in this stew. I’m fairly sure it will fall apart on the fork, it’s so tender, and he makes the most
They found their way to simpler topics, and Hermione slept in the spare room. She didn’t like being alone, when Ron was away.
“That’s why you’ll be a superb Auror, while I would probably have ended up in St Mungo’s once a week and ended up dying under
“We should do this again.” This time, Harry met his eyes, and the hopeful slant to his chin made Draco want to step closer, bury his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. Or possibly wade into the lake and hope to be eaten by the giant squid. One or the other.
“Yes. Do you need to go back?”
Blimey, it really was like Sixth Year all over again.
“Minister,” he said, with a nod and a little bow.
The following morning Harry left a fleeting kiss on the sleep-warm lips of the man he’d just shagged stupid. “That was fun,” he said.
“It’s only a bit of magic.”
He carefully buttoned up Harry’s pyjama shirt again, and adjusted the blanket.
He barely tasted the food, but still declared it the best Sunday dinner ever. He produced a cake that had been brought by a grateful customer a few days prior and they mowed through most of that, as well. And then Hermione said she needed to finish an assignment before class the next day, which Ron and Ginny took to mean she was hustling them out the door. Which she was. To Harry’s relief, and apparently, Draco’s as well.
He wondered if there might be a future in which he didn’t have to think about it, in which people would just let him be. Students got used to him eventually because he was stern when he needed to be, a barrel of laughs when so moved, and so frustratingly normal the rest of the time — whatever ’normal’ meant these days — and because he refused point blank to discuss the war.
“Probably. If I’m not, I will make something up.”
“Er,” Harry said, “Yes, I did. And we’ll be learning those later in the —”
Harry didn’t answer and he didn’t need to. They all knew that it would never be over, not really, not for those who had survived it.
“I’ll wait to hear about the arrangements, then, Minister,” he said, and with a nod to Blaise, he took his leave, anger thrumming behind his breastbone.
“Bonnie,” Harry said, because Draco was right, and he was feeling much too cheerful and extremely pleased with himself. “How are you enjoying being Head of House?”
“Alright,” Harry said, as he found his legs again. He was barely aware that Draco was holding him up, and laughing. “Find a partner, find a mat — and focus on jinxes and defences. We’ll move around the room and offer some help.”
“Because going to Draco is the next big adventure. And I need to be the best version of myself if I’m to get there in the shape that he deserves. He can’t be my Healer anymore, Hermione.”
Eventually they made it to the… third? floor of a small wing and Draco opened the door.
“Which would be fine, if you weren’t absolutely besotted with Harry Potter.
Harry slipped away past his new friends thanks to a quick and quiet Notice-Me-Not and he headed out onto the pavement. It was dark, and cooler, now. It didn’t take too long for him to figure out where the band moved their gear in and out. He stood unnoticed by the back door for a while, listening for any sign that his heartbeat might be starting to slow; but it wasn’t.
After a long silence where Harry fancied some of the tension had drained from Draco’s body, he spoke again. “I’m a fuck-up.”
He pulled his hands into his sleeves, and took a breath, staring at the green grass beneath his feet. He opened his mouth to say something, and looked Harry right in the eye. Harry didn’t want to feel sorry for Draco Malfoy; he really didn’t. But when he looked into those eyes, when he felt the frenetic energy of his magic spiking all around him — Draco Malfoy, Harry was reasonably sure, was quite broken.
Hermione’s face softened, and she shook her head. She turned to the pantry and started searching around, her ever-growing stomach getting in the way. She pulled out a bottle of Bailey’s. Muggle booze. Harry’s eyes opened wide, and Hermione brought the bottle down to the coffee table. She poured them each a glass, and then cast a charm over her own to remove the alcohol.
“It’s open,” Draco replied, sounding exhausted.
“I think I have a lot of thinking to do,” he said. “Do you mind if — if I just stay here? Instead of coming back to yours — I can Floo in tomorrow and pick up my things.”
“It’s alright,” he said. “Really. I’m not going to bury myself in my head again. It’s one night. It was bound to happen eventually. It’s time to go back to work.”
“But — it’s a Muggle book.”
“Stop, Draco. Snape was a good man.”
“— you know, just shut up, alright? Shut up. Did you know Harry was almost sorted into Slytherin?”
circumstances. The Prophet would have a field day.”
She made it sound as if it was nothing; something rich old ladies did with their time and nothing more. But she avoided Draco’s eyes when she said it. Something else for them to discuss when it was just the two of them.
. So…”
“But we do need some space,” Hermione said, carefully. “And for that matter so does everyone else. And I love your mum, Ron, you know I do, but she won’t accept much help in the kitchen and she’s running herself ragged.”
Draco sighed. “I still don’t concede that’s a foregone conclusion — but I think you’re probably right.”
Close to midnight, Neville, Harry and Draco decided it was time to turn in. Not exactly drunk, but very, very far from sober. At the door to the castle, knowing Neville was heading in the opposite direction to he and Harry, Draco pressed a small vial of a bright green liquid into each of their palms.
She stopped wavering.
Harry smiled, and sighed, and sat on the edge of the bed.
His bones, incidentally, were as bored as they were warm. He thought over Draco’s instructions to Healer Thistlewish, and decided to follow at least one of his suggested therapeutic activities; a walk. It sounded simple enough. The strange guilt that he felt about being back in the world and not actually doing any work niggled at the back of his mind, but he did his best to ignore it. It seemed like a good day to see something he’d never seen before. The Botanical Gardens at Kew, perhaps. Or an art gallery. He knew that there were apparition points. He could take in some history, and culture.
So modest. No mention of the stupid amount of power Harry had, and the way it was rolling off him in reassuring warm waves again now. “And what
and so you know you’re not getting something for nothing. I know you, Harry Potter, and you might not think that way now but in a few years —”
“Er,” he said. “Hullo again, Mrs Malfoy. And Professor Malfoy.” He let himself be led to a chair, but was somehow unable to sit. Not the Draught of Living Death, then, someone had merely stuck a pole up his arse. Draco felt his lip curl; it was very satisfying, to see someone who had repeatedly beaten — and then
In his head, the people Draco had attended school with had never aged a day. He’d puzzled over it more than once — the day that he’d bumped into Millicent Bulstrode in London, he’d taken at least five minutes to reconcile the woman in front of him with her clear skin and her fashionable up-do with the girl he’d first met almost twenty years ago. He’d searched her features for familiarity and conceded there wasn’t a great deal there, save the hollow-eyed look of so many of them who had survived the war.
“No one has ever called me adequate before,” he said, and he laughed. Narcissa moved her hands, cradling his skull between them and kissed his forehead.
Harry shook his head. “The last thing I need is money.” He was silent for a few long moments. “I saw Draco.” Harry hadn’t meant to say it; he really hadn’t. It just tumbled from his lips, a truth he’d been needing to tell for months, now. Blaise said nothing, but he visibly tensed.
The boy who had walked to his death at the hands of a Dark Lord in the forbidden forest was now trembling in the face of a kiss.
a genius, Granger,” he said, conjuring his boyhood spite over their competitions for the highest marks. “And if I hadn’t made any progress at all, I can assure you I wouldn’t be here looking for even more clues. Do try
Draco looked perplexed by this, but dismissed his reaction after only a moment. “What happened to the Manor?” he asked, after a long time spent silently eating. He was, indeed, starving, Harry could see, but seemed to be having trouble, eating only tiny mouthfuls and resting in between. He looked gaunt. Perhaps he’d been hungry for a long time. All he’d eaten from breakfast was the bacon.
“I doubt anyone does.”
“What have I done?” Hermione asked.
There were quiet tears, of course, throughout the afternoon and early evening. Harry doubted that there would ever be a holiday where they didn’t find themselves thinking about everyone they’d lost.
Harry ended the kiss, but he didn’t pull away very far. “I don’t know why you would, Draco. I just hope you do.”
“We haven’t discussed courting in a long time, Draco,” she said, when the dinner plates had been cleared, and they were waiting for their dessert.
Harry sat back in his armchair and clasped his hands in his lap. Ron was right. He’d never noticed, but Ron was right.
He rather enjoyed Potter’s stunned expression when he pushed the door closed and locked it again with a satisfying swish and click.
That night Harry slept in Ron and Hermione’s guest bedroom, quite unnecessarily, and they took a slow breakfast around noon. Bacon and eggs on toast, mug after mug of coffee until they decided they’d never sleep if they didn’t switch to tea, fresh orange juice and sharing stories about the day before.
— he really did need to sample the local specialty before he left. They found a quiet table, easy when the bar wasn’t very full, and Draco slumped into a chair. Not miserable, though, at all. Perish the actual fucking thought.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m not in the habit of reading other people’s mail,” he said airily, thrusting the envelope into Harry’s hand.
She danced on the spot, nauseatingly praising the Hero of Hogwarts before vanishing with another crack.
“Aunt Andromeda,” he said formally, and Harry found himself wondering how exactly this man and the nose-breaking punk guitar player existed in the same body. “It’s very nice to see you.”
He took a long, hot shower before dressing in plain old Muggle jeans and a t-shirt, tossing a hooded sweatshirt over the top. Sunday. He had some work to do, and he had been debating finding someplace to do some flying, and…
He did not do that.
“We could skip the ceremony and go straight to the consummation,” Harry growled. “You look fucking spectacular, Draco. But these robes will look even better in a pile on the floor later.”
No one else ever got to see Draco like this, with all his corners buffed out. This was only for Harry.
“I will,” he said, flashing it at Draco again. “I have a very strong feeling I’m going to need it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I suppose I am.”
It read.
Hermione cleared her throat and Draco startled, rearranging the sheet over Harry’s body and straightening his spine. “I don’t mean to push, Draco,” she said. “But have you made any progress?”
Harry’s wand.”
“Another sentence fragment. Do you need some help, Harry? A verb? How about,
Blaise and Hermione shared a long look. Draco sipped his wine and tried not to hate them both. Hating them both would serve no real purpose, of course. He scratched his forehead.
“Ouch,” he shouted, as Persephone bit his earlobe. “Sodding horror. I’ll feed you to a Hippogriff if you’re not a little more respectful. I don’t care who your fancy-pants mistress is.” Persephone hooted again, annoyed, but refusing to move from her spot on the back of a dining chair alongside the one Draco was sitting on, pretending to be all casual and smooth.
Ron was groaning into his hands. “She’s my
“I think you might be onto something there,” Potter replied wearily, sitting on a tall stool at the bench. “I —”
She wavered.
“My arse is sore,” Harry complained, but he was grinning.
“This one, Harry,” Draco said almost reverently, and Harry smiled.
So he did that.
“I know you don’t want to hear it, mate, but he is exactly as good as they say he is. Probably better.”
Wandless magic was never as precise as magic with a wand, but it could be much more powerful. And Harry didn’t really like to talk about it too much, knowing how Hermione could worry; but sometimes, he didn’t need to know the words, or even if something was possible. He just needed the intention, and enough mental space to
“Madam Pomfrey would have been able to handle this, you know,” Harry said, not unkindly. “Why did you call me?”
“The washer is old-fashioned. It runs on magic.”
Blaise’s head was shaved almost to the skull, so Harry preferred not to know what he meant.
Draco felt sick.
“She’s excellent. She was living in Chile during the war and though she knew my name, I was never… I was never famous, to her. She knows what I did. She knows what I do. She’s just much more interested in talking about things that have upset or hurt me. Losing Sirius. Thinking about my parents and wondering what it would have been like if I’d grown up with them. She has some interesting ideas about Dumbledore.”
Hermione held her wand out in front of her. “
The next knock sounded terrifyingly exhausted. Harry ran across the wooden floorboards and opened the door without even looking out. There was someone on the front step; homeless? Hurt? He pulled the door open the rest of the way and pulled the body inside.
“I remember. And I think I probably
“You’ll need it more than I will,” Neville promised, and he was right about that.
“He sucker-punched me,” Harry admitted. Ron passed him a beer as he dropped onto the couch.
He hadn’t changed a bit. Harry felt the old anger flash. “Funny — when the rest of us grew up, I thought you might have, too. Guess not.”
But Ron’s hand curled into a claw. He stared for a long time at the board.
Draco trailed kisses over Harry’s cheek, up to his ear, pulling Harry closer as he shivered.
He realised as he followed Blaise into the sitting room that he missed Potter. No matter how bizarre their moments together were, he missed the man. Draco missed who he was in those dreams. No sarcasm, or at least, nothing starkly
“Draco.”
Harry rolled Draco’s trouser legs up very gently, as Draco couldn’t really use his hands yet. “Not so bad.” He returned to the soothing spell.
“It’s so pretty, here,” he said. “I probably didn’t pay enough attention, in the beginning.”
“Nah. He’s worked with most of us at some point or another. Probably hard to get anyone to put up with him in the long term.”
“I remember,” Hermione said, and she crawled across the couch to burrow into Harry’s arms and rest her head on his shoulder.
So much learning, and every part of it thrilling.
“I don’t hate you. You did save the world, after all, and I don’t have alternative accommodations available.”
“I don’t know why I don’t do that more often.”
“Those finger sandwiches look to be
“Mrs Anand,” he said, with a smile. “You are a vision, as usual.” Resplendent in a very bright purple sari. “How is the book going?”
“Aunt Andromeda,” Malfoy said, next. He handed over one of his envelopes. “I’ve placed some money in a Gringott’s vault to safeguard Teddy’s future, and yours. The details are in here. There is a letter from my mother, as well. If you don’t want to read it, I ask you not to destroy it, but put it somewhere safe. She asked me to make sure I said that. But I don’t think she’d be angry if you tossed it in the fire.”
It seemed like a letter he should open in private, but it also seemed as though Madam Shacklebolt knew what the letter said, and was waiting for him to read it. He broke the seal, and slipped the piece of parchment out, open it carefully.
When the food was done, Harry found his favourite bench was empty. He sat at one end, looking out over the water, enjoying the warm air, the cool breeze, and his contentment.
“I suppose he does,” she said, chewing her lip. “But —”
It wasn’t as if anyone had bothered to so much as
Draco had long since learned that if you wanted someone to say something they didn’t want to, the best way to ensure it happened was to give them enough time so that they had to fill the silence with sound. To that end, he took a few more notes, and then waited patiently.
. He didn’t like to tell her that he was sick of being mobbed, that Glamours had been all that made his work as an Auror manageable. But he didn’t want to take the Glamour off and become the centre of attention, either. He could hear Draco mocking him from somewhere deep in the back of his head — no less brutally for one than the other.
He stood to the side, watching the students find their places at their tables, with a ‘
“No, I…”
Draco raised the wand, and seemed to take a moment to settle himself. He straightened his back, tipped his chin back, took a moment to recall a memory — and then he cast.
“Chess. Yeah.” He nodded.
“It doesn’t matter, is what I’m saying, because whoever he created in his head
“Class dismissed,” he said. “You can all head to lunch a little early.”
“You’re still in there, then,” Draco said. “Good. I’m not thrilled with the idea of doing another swan-dive through hell, but I’ll do it, as long as you’re prepared for a chat at the end. Definitely time we made some progress here, though. I wish I had some idea of why you’ve got me in there with you. If it’s just because I’m the one visiting, or…”
Harry snorted, despite himself. “Alright. I can sit on my arse a little longer. I could probably stop invading your, uh, home, though.”
He was looking forward to going home.
Harry froze, preparing a passionate defence of his motivations, but he shook his head, instead. “Alright,” he said with a laugh. Draco’s mockery didn’t even sound like mockery. “What do you propose?”
“Some things don’t go away, Potter.”
“But Draco had a point. About the way I grew up. You know, he told me… a while after he found out about… well, Little Whingeing. We were in the sitting room at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Every pillow and cushion in the house was piled up in front of the hearth, and so were most of the blankets. He told me that when we’d first met, he expected me to have spent the first decade of my life being reminded how special I was, and how important, how I’d defeated the Dark Lord — his words, not mine — and that I’d be every bit the entitled brat that he was.
“It’s not like that,” Harry said.
“Okay.”
When he opened the paper to page three, he quickly found the continuation.
“It’s not for me,” Harry said. He raised his glass. “And it never was. To finding our places in the world,” he added festively. And suddenly, he thought of Draco Malfoy in tight leather pants, playing guitar on stage with his eyes heavily rimmed in kohl. He hoped that in one way or another, Draco had found his place, too.
“Minister Granger,” the Healer said.
“I’ve never been so sure. I’m only sorry it had to come to this.” She kissed Harry’s cheek, and leaned into him again, wiping her tears and ignoring the last of the applause. “When will you leave for Naples?”
“It’s a funny expression,” Ron said at last.
“Seven hells you will,” Ron said. “Come on, Gin, leave him alone to get used to the idea of eating a civil lunch with a bunch of Gryffindorks. You can chop something.” He dragged her by the wrist out to the kitchen and Harry sighed again, and sat down.
Merlin’s frilly knickers, what a terrible thought.
“Well, I’m sure you’ll miss the noise,” Molly said, with a tight smile.
Hermione Granger was a good person and en excellent Minister of Magic.
Harry hadn’t even known Alaric was Muggleborn.
Harry hated to acknowledge that he had so much raw power. He hated that he even had it; the risks were terrible, and it was embarrassing. He briefly regretted having had this conversation at all. He rubbed his hands together.
“Come in,” Harry said, without looking up. When the large, distinguished form of Delilah Shacklebolt came through the door he was instantly alert and on his feet. “Madam,” he said. “I apologise. I didn’t expect to see anyone this late.” He tried in vain to press his hair into submission but it rebelled with all the passion it could muster. She shooed his concern away.
“Trust me,” he said. “Hangover cure. Best in the business. You’ll wish you were dead, for about thirty seconds, and then you’ll be fresh as a daisy — except you’ll stink, and you’ll need a good long shower.”
Draco nodded. “Have you tried it?”
After supper on Friday night Draco met his mother for a drink in Hogsmeade. The weather was getting colder by the day. It would be a bitter winter. He kissed Narcissa’s cheek and pulled her chair out for her. They ordered mulled wine; it was very fine, flavoured with cinnamon and apples, cloves and cardamom. A little port to warm the blood, while the steaming glasses warmed the fingers.
, what in Merlin’s name was she doing there — his hand to shake. She shook it, rather more warmly than he had thought she might.
“No, you shouldn’t,” Draco disagreed, letting his gaze flicker from Harry’s eyes, to his mouth, and back again. “Not everyone here is looking for a bride, Harry.”
That Saturday, a little over half of the staff of Hogwarts accompanied the students to Hogsmeade. They had gifts and cards to buy, window displays to gape at, Christmas lists to write up. The only snow so far was the magical kind, landing conveniently on window sills and not on the footpaths. The day was full of altogether too much in the way of adolescent hormones, exam nerves, and the kind of homesickness that hits right before someone heads home, and when Draco and Harry stumbled into the Three Broomsticks to scoff some lunch it was only the briefest of respite.
’. His face, his name, his reputation had never failed to draw interested and scandalised looks from students new and old, but Draco had learned something interesting in his first year of teaching; if you refused to pay a lick of attention, people really
“If you don’t mind,” Harry said apologetically.
“Oh,” Hermione said. For a moment there was a fuzziness in her eyes that Harry recognised, the threat of being pulled back into that nightmare. “Thank you, Malfoy.”
“I didn’t ask what she needed, or what she wanted,” Harry argued. He rubbed his eyes. “I asked what you thought she would
“I look forward to seeing you again, Harry,” Narcissa said, as Draco helped her into her coat. Harry was too lost looking around his room to help, but Narcissa didn’t look offended. Only pleased with herself, and sly.
The Healer crossed the room to Harry’s bedside, cast a couple of quick diagnostic spells that Hermione was coming to recognise instantly (Harry’s stasis was holding, for now; his vitals were normal. He was just… asleep).
Also, he suddenly had no idea what he was supposed to say. This was not his world. He thought of Grimmauld Place. He realised he should have gone there, instead. Nursed his foolish wounds and reminded himself that he preferred to work than do things like courting, or getting maudlin with history professors, or… dancing with Malfoy in the moonlight.
“Did you get into a fist fight, Harry? Fantastic! Oh, no, you weren’t trying to flirt with straight guys, were you? Did you get a good one or two in yourself?”
“She’s a little girl,” Draco said, reaching for a sandwich. “She doesn’t have confidence in herself and she was startled. Children should be able to make mistakes without the world ending, Salazar’s sake,” he muttered, before cramming a sandwich into his mouth. “I almost burned down Malfoy Manor as a child, when I found an old wand and tried
Teddy fussed, and Harry handed him back to Andromeda, who cooed and patted him softly.
“I gave up on the case files, by the way. Don’t pretend you don’t know what you did.”
“I do. But you know how I love you to say it, darling. Please. Tell me what you want me to do.”
“No, that’s not what — I don’t want you to leave. But I feel as if you need some help, and you’re too stubborn to ask for it, and… — I mean something
“Professor Potter,” he said, cool and neutral. “Welcome back to Hogwarts.”
Harry smiled. “He was… studying. He made friends; few friends, but
The flash of irritation would once have set off Harry’s temper, but now, he was embarrassed. And frankly, desirous. If they were inside his head he might have sidled up closer and apologised with a kiss, with fingers pressed against Draco’s skin but here, he couldn’t. This was real. Draco should never have had to do what he did.
bloke, but you’re not up for doing that. Not these days. But nice try, good threat,” he added, with much too much enthusiasm, like he was trying to encourage a first year student who had just had a face full of Bulbadox juice. Draco let his forehead slam on the table in front of him.
that intention.
“You should have told me,” she said, dropping the paper bag on the counter and crossing her arms. No one that diminutive should have been able to look so threatening.
you are, you’re not afraid to use a hex or a curse when you need to.”
Draco handed him the gift. Harry stared for a moment and then took it. He untied the ribbon and tucked it into his pocket, and then he tore the paper off.
“Have fun,” he said brightly, gesturing at the Floo. “Say hello to everyone.”
“Hullo,” he said, with a friendly smile. There were waves, some laughter, and a few soft charms of celebration, sparks and glitter in the air. “It’s so good to be back here with you. I’ve missed my home, and I’ve missed so many of you. I’m happy to be back.” There was a low rumble of laughter.
Harry laughed. “With luck on my side, sooner or later he’ll be my husband. But we’re old and crotchety and I’m not in a rush any more than he is. Don’t make that face. He’s not going to go running off to find someone else. He knows I’m coming back. He really does know. He’s waiting for me to be ready, and when I am… I’m ready to make the life we both deserve.”
They did look very happy, and the stars, Luna thought, when she gazed up into the sky, seemed to agree.
It was several days later when Blaise finally re-appeared from his mission. He was as straight-backed as always in his Unspeakable robes and as affectionate as ever once he’d been carefully relieved of them. He didn’t talk about his mission, but only because their time was sacred, not because Hermione wasn’t to know.
“You trust this Healer bloke, don’t you, ‘Mione? He’s not just got Galleons in his eyes, right?”
“You don’t know the half of it. Harry’s brilliant.”
“D’you think we should perhaps discuss the Zouwu in the room?” she murmured, into Harry’s shoulder.
Hermione did her best to keep the conversation light, but Kreacher went from wringing his hands to pacing on the tabletop to beating his fists against it in less than twenty minutes. “Master needs Kreacher,” he muttered, pulling at his ears. “Master needs his Kreacher, yes he does — Master’s
“Thought about this,” Draco said. “Thought about this for years. Thought about you when I was wanking in the Slytherin dormitories —”
“Oh, It is, it is,” Emrys agreed.
“Then why don’t you call me Dra—”
They apparated to Grimmauld Place, and Harry immediately thought of Number Twelve. And then there she was, elbowing herself into place between the neighbouring houses.
“Hermione,” Harry said, rubbing his eyes. “Does she know I…?”
They had him.
“A delightful gift for a school chum,” Mrs Malfoy replied, her voice dry. “I had hoped you might have found your way to seeing things differently, with a little time to think.”
Harry bit his lip. “He’s a bit posh. Even if he is a git. He’s a posh git.”
“You’ve been wrong before,” Blaise said, standing, tossing his Unspeakable robes over his shoulders again. “Love, and time, Harry. Longing. Come by for dinner, I’m making Bouillabaisse.” And then he was gone.
“Making breakfast. I don’t know how to say I’m sorry, but I know how to make breakfast.”
“I miss some things,” Hermione said, carefully.
“I’ll certainly give that some thought. Thank you,” he said, and there was another tug behind Draco’s bellybutton. He was folded through time and space, sleep an wakefulness, across years and continents, landing in a hospital bed alongside his very vulnerable and very unconscious patient.
Harry slumped in his chair. She had asked him a question.
Potter had changed. Twelve years older, certainly. But apparently the speccie git had never considered so much as changing his haircut. His eyeglasses were the same shape, his fringe still fell across the scar on his forehead — Draco was willing to bet his shoes weren’t polished and his wand was grubby. Perhaps that wasn’t fair. Aurors probably weren’t allowed grubby wands.
“I’ll bring him a potato or two,” the woman said, but her husband shouted.
“Oh,” Potter said, looking embarrassed, his shoulders closing in as if to make himself smaller. “No, it’s… forget I said that, I’m tired. It’s like you said. We’re not children anymore.”
“Of course you are, darling.” Narcissa tightened her cloak against the cold air. “Don’t worry about a thing; I have everything planned out. I’ll see you on Wednesday,” she finished, and disapparated with a loud
He thought about Blaise, for about eight seconds, and then realised he really, really couldn’t. He thought about Draco, and slipped his hand into his pyjama pants, softly rolling his cock in his hand, coaxing it to fullness. And then he heard it:
The light had almost disappeared, now, but what was left of it painted the walls a soft tangerine colour which was rather fetching. Draco had a powerful urge to kiss it off Harry’s face, but they weren’t finished, not yet. Tired, perhaps. Harry let his gaze drift out the window.
Harry had felt his own anxiety ramping up with every moment that passed. Malfoy handed him the final envelope. “Could you please hand deliver this to Kingsley Shacklebolt, Potter? It’s not sealed.”
He loved the long evenings of the summer. More than the warm weather, he enjoyed the way the day stretched out like the shadows, the way the sun was coming up when he opened his eyes. He cast a quick
Draco’s eyes twinkled. And Harry wanted to kiss him.
He pursed his lips and shook his head.
Draco shook his head. “I’m working. A lot, at the moment. I don’t think I’ll have a lot of time for a social life for the next few weeks.”
Harry felt his lips curl into an incredulous smile. Whatever McGonagall was getting at, Harry had no clue. Harry would be an Auror. He didn’t think he could even live with himself if he knew that there were people putting himself in harm’s way if he wasn’t doing the same himself.
a good line, though. It’s good to know you’re not out of practice,” Draco promised, and then moaned obscenely when Harry gripped his cock and began a slow stroke. His hips snapped automatically, fucking up into Harry’s hand, his cock hard as diamonds and throbbing. A trickle of pre-come escaped from the tip and Harry brought his hand to his mouth, to taste. “Merlin’s tits, Harry. Do you know what you look like right now?”
And if Harry had kissed him —
. We need to train him like a dog. He’s too stupid to take anything else in. There are worrying defects in your genetic line, Petunia.
“Harry?”
“I should go,” he said.
“I have other patients to get to,” he said. “I’ll be back this evening. I have an idea. But if you could just wake up and be all indignant, I think it would be better for both of us. You think?”
something less than dignified.”
Around three in the morning, when most people had gone home (by apparition or by floo, for the most part), and those who were staying were tucked up fast asleep, Harry climbed through the window in the attic and sat on the roof.
It didn’t, though.
“You spoke for him at the trial. You know why he took the Mark.”
Of course, it was
She sat beside him, and knowing how much easier Harry found it to give comfort than to take it, she took one of his hands in both of hers and leaned heavily into his side, head on his shoulder.
“Yes, it is. And after Ron left training and started working at his brother’s shop. Did you see much of Harry?”
Draco moved closer. Closer than an enemy, closer than a friend. Close enough so that Harry was suddenly forcibly reminded of those few inches Draco had over him. Harry let himself be crowded against the kitchen counter, watching Draco’s eyes, even while Draco deliberately avoided his gaze. When Draco reached a tentative hand out as if waiting to be stopped — Harry took that hand and brought it to his lips. He kissed Draco’s knuckles, and then his palm, and then the inside of his wrist. He curved his other arm around Draco’s waist. He seemed so fragile, but Harry knew he wasn’t. No one survived as much as they had and remained fragile in the end.
“Professor Potter,” he said, in cool, formal greeting.
“Fuck it,” Harry said, and made his way to Professor McGonagall’s office.
“Draco, whatever it is that you need to ask me — please, I am begging you. Just ask me.”
“I’m sure this weekend would be fine,” Harry said.
Nothing happened, for several long moments. Probably, wars were fought and lost in that time. Continents shifted. Hearts broke and were mended and then broke again. Draco let himself sob. Trying to stop it would be a waste of effort, he reasoned, and then he sensed Harry closer. Crouching directly in front of him.
That night, Harry sat on the couch at Ron and Hermione’s house and admitted the story, haltingly, and without enough detail for Ron to get nauseated. He had both hands wrapped around a crystal whiskey glass, warming the Firewhiskey inside with his hands until he could smell it, the low honey notes and the faint smokiness. Ron and Hermione’s home was nicer each time Harry visited; piece by piece they had decorated it, painted it, added tiny treasures and more photographs until it was beginning to feel like an extension of the Burrow. Which, while not fully recovered into its former glory, was still the homiest home Harry had ever known. Quilted blankets and cushions, mismatched teacups and plates from thrift shops around London; Harry loved it, here.
The entire thing had been foolish. Harry Potter was not a suitable partner by any stretch of the imagination — just
“I’ll do my best, Healer,” Harry promised, grinning widely at her. The smile felt distinctly boyish, and the way she lifted her eyebrows made Harry feel very young indeed, for a moment.
Harry had also bought a package of an interesting-looking tea as a get-well gift for Ollivander, and he offered it to the old man now.
“Er,” Harry replied.
“Is it enough?” he gasped. “I don’t want to hurt you, but I want you tight.”
.” Draco indicated the small meeting table, and Hermione stepped out from behind her desk, stepping carefully past piles of books to sit in the chair that Draco had pulled out for her.
“I’m afraid, Hermione,” Draco said, and that was the most startling thing she had ever heard him say. “He’s getting physically weaker, and it’s getting harder to reach him. I push, we find a way through a memory, and then I start rebuilding his trust again — until I fucking betray him,
Hermione smiled, and stood up. “Of course. I think I’ll go, Harry. Blaise gets home tonight. Are you sure you’ll be able to cope with the dinner? I’d like to punch Robards right in the face.”
Harry was still awake, listening.
They were on their feet, now, and Draco gripped Harry’s arms, just above the elbows.
Draco flipped an hourglass and looked balefully at Potter. “It will be. Your suspiciousness really is not your most endearing trait, Potter.” He took off his robes, and hung them on a coat hook near the door. Underneath, he wore a pair of silk trousers in a pale grey with a matching waistcoat, and a pale blue shirt. He loosen the tie, blue again if a darker shade, and enjoyed the furtive look Potter gave him. Potter hesitated, and followed suit, hanging his robe alongside Draco’s. It was very warm in the room. Draco folded his sleeves up to his elbows, and nodded pointedly at Potter.
He pulled his own gift out of the air, realising too late that it meant that he had summoned it through several walls, wandlessly and without a word. Draco seemed to have become accustomed, though. He held Harry’s eyes for a long moment, and then unwrapped the gift. It was a book. A small book, a
Sometimes, when Draco Owled his mother, he found himself writing the same kind of delicate prose and then leaving the most important things for the postscript. Perhaps he thought it took the sting out. He paused another moment and set quill to parchment once more.
They were silent for a while.
“A-ha, but as with cats, it’s always terribly entertaining to point it out when you
going on, here?”
Draco smiled indulgently. “Not hungry. I just want to look at you. Can I look at you, Harry?”
“I can handle that, Healer,” he said.
“The signs that the Dark Lor…, that
Harry shook his head. “It wasn’t like that. It just happened. And after that,
The bell over the door rang, and Harry looked up. A handful of the other teachers had stepped inside. Professor Saltzman, who had taken over History of Magic when Binns had discovered quite abruptly that he was, indeed, dead. Professor Bennett, who had taken over Transfiguration when McGonagall had taken on the role of Headmaster. She was very clever. She reminded Harry of Hermione. And Draco. Of
“I made that wand. On the weekend. As an experiment. And today, I took it to show Ollivander, and do you know what he said?”
like a curse.
It took a couple of moments her Hermione to realise he wasn’t just tossing her an insult. Of course he wasn’t. He was a psychiatrist himself; he would hardly belittle his own occupation, not with his ego.
“We were surprised he took it, really.”
At the door to his quarters, he hesitated. He could do the work out here, but the rooms were cosy, and the fire was roaring, and he wasn’t going to pretend to himself that he didn’t want Potter to come inside. Otherwise, he would have offered to make the potion on his own and had a House-elf deliver it.
“You could let me forgive you,” Draco murmured, with his lips brushing against Harry’s ear. “You could remember that I was about to cast an Unforgivable curse on you, and that you — against all laws of rational behaviour, forgave me.”
The sun was down when Draco took Harry through the Floo.
Harry grinned at her. “I wanted to know what the Department was working on
happened. I just got busy.”
Appetisers appeared at the tables, and Harry suddenly realised how hungry he was; he had been so focused on his speech that he had forgotten to eat breakfast or lunch. He wasn’t concerned, but he was glad to have an appetite, because as much as he loathed Robards on a personal level the man knew how to get an event catered. Plus, Hermione was a bully who used her power for god: Ministry events had to be catered by unionised, freed house-elves.
It was strange, because it felt like they’d already done this, before, but —
— the Gryffindor dormitory. A dry bar, and a small tea service. Harry took another step inside, but he didn’t let go of Narcissa’s hand.
Lunch could have been a lot more awkward, Harry supposed. Ron, Hermione and Ginny all put in an effort, Ginny quietly goading Draco, speculating about his obvious escape into witness protection (“If that was the case, Weasley, I’d hardly tell you.”). How he’d escaped indentured servitude in the Department of Mysteries (“Don’t you know there’s a vow that makes people’s tongues fall out if they speak of such things?”). Ron and Hermione took over the cooking, and Harry had the very important tasks of hovering, fussing, and worrying.
He opened the wardrobe and pulled down three quilts, casting warming charms between each one, slowly burying Draco in a pile of patchwork. He spoke soothing nonsense the whole time, resisting the urge to ask questions. Draco couldn’t have answered them, and he was worried Draco might disappear in the night if he felt cornered. He didn’t seem to be asleep, though, or not completely asleep, anyway; his eyes were sometimes open a crack, and sometimes squeezed shut, as if he was trying to stay in his head, trying not to acknowledge the world at all.
Harry bristled, and Draco remembered suddenly that for years and years Harry had been hungry. Truly hungry, the kind of hungry you have to learn to ignore. The kind of hungry where you end up shorter than your parents, despite being so full of power that it rippled off you in waves, the way Draco could feel right now.
Draco didn’t want to fuck Harry.
,” Malfoy said, almost spitting the word, “suggests you spent your formative years in
When Harry woke in the morning, he was alone on the bed. He stretched, and grinned; Draco was probably making coffee, or wrestling with Scamp for the Daily Prophet. Harry let his eyes close, and waited a moment.
“Alright, I promise you and Hermione can have the last two doses of hangover potion if you
“I do,” Blaise said. “Several of them, and you’re playing clueless just as sure as you’re procrastinating, but it’s alright — I do get it. I’m saying two things. And they are things I’ll never discuss with my extraordinary fiancée, just so you know.
“Draco Malfoy’s rooms,” he muttered, and he found his way to bed, and didn’t even bother to take off his robes.
Ron and Harry had to agree. They knew what she was doing. Trying to bury herself in work so that grief couldn’t overwhelm her.
After a long silence, Draco looked up, with a cool, professional smile on his face. “Do you mind if I ask a question?”
“Thank you for receiving me, Mrs Malfoy,” he replied, and kissed her offered cheek.
Hermione nodded.
There was a spike of something in his demeanour; dishonesty, Harry thought. It had really only been a line, and he’d intended to follow it with a smooth ‘then do you want to get out of here?’. But Lucas was watching the band set up. He liked them. Or he liked one of them, anyway. Harry started to think he might be barking up the wrong tree. He bought a round of drinks.
Hermione stayed silent while Harry took his stew off the heat.
Emrys laughed. “Alright. So does that mean I should tell you what’s on your mind, or just call you out on it if you lie to me?”
“I hate that you can read everything I don’t want to say on my face. I know I wear my heart on my sleeve. But I swear you can read my thoughts, too.”
“You may not use any spells, charms, jinxes or hexes that are not on this list. Anyone using a curse will never set foot in this room again, and don’t imagine for a moment that you will sneak one by without us knowing. The moment you stepped into this room, you had a brand new trace on you. No curses,” he reiterated.
