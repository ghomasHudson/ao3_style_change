“I – Snuffles is meeting me in Hogsmeade on Saturday,” he said, deflecting from Hermione’s point about sneaking off.
Scorpius nodded violently and Teddy began to relay the time Harry took him to Romania to visit Charlie with Ron and Hermione as they began to walk to the Market.
“Do you know what house he’ll be in?” Blaise asked. Unlike Pansy, Blaise was completely unfazed and seemed to genuinely want to know about Draco’s new friend.
She sighed dramatically and Draco gave her a small smile, “I do, it’s one of the best jobs I’ve had – it’s helped me to learn so much about Muggles! But she’ll hate me, I know it.”
He hated this feeling. He tried to bury this feeling for as long as he could. He hated this feeling more than any other.
“From Luna?” Harry asked, for a split-second wondering if that meant Luna was Scorpius’ mother before remembering that Luna had never shown an interest in being in a relationship.
“It’s kinda funny that it’s made of pine wood actually,” he said. “Pine trees symbolise reaching for the stars,” he grinned as Draco looked at him with scepticism.
“So, you were acquitted?” Draco asked, his hands in his pockets. He cursed himself for asking a question he already knew the answer to.
“And now my Daddy is taking me to see the ducks – I know that ducks aren’t your friends but they’re really nice!” Scorpius explained to the dog.
Andromeda nodded. “I’m not the best person to ask about this Draco,” she admitted. “Whilst we have both been disowned, the circumstances were substantially different,” she explained, and Draco nodded slowly.
Turning to truly look at Harry, Draco noticed the fiery green eyes, the eyes that intrigued Draco when they were eleven.
Then, an unpleasant feeling grew in his stomach, climbing through his chest and squeezing at his throat. He wasn’t scared, but uncomfortable; it was the same feeling he got before he spoke to Sirius after the article in the Prophet. It was an itchiness and a restlessness that made him want to deny that there was anything wrong, because if he did, the feeling would disappear, as it had done when Draco was distracting him in the tunnel.
It didn’t take him long as Teddy had bubble-gum pink hair. “Teddy!” He called out, grinning as the eleven-year-old ran at him, leaving his trunk behind, and tackled him into a hug. Harry managed (somehow) to stay on his feet, and he held the boy close.
Taking a shaky breath, Harry willed his body to climb the rest of the stairs and rooted around the bottom of his trunk for the mirror shard.
“Don’t forget Draco,” Lucius said, walking toward the front door of the Manor. “You’re a Malfoy above all.”
Remus smiled. “Your mother disliked your aunt quite a bit, I assumed there was a reason. I wanted to give you the happiest home I could.”
“Master Sirius has a call, sir,” Kreacher said as he appeared in the same room as Sirius, tossing the mirror shard to the ground, but thankfully Sirius caught it before it landed.
“I say I’m thinking about it, but I’ve signed all the paperwork, I just have to hand it in,” Harry interrupted, letting her know he was being genuine. “My boss has never looked so relieved,” he chuckled.
Draco gave a short wave and a small smile, and he once again noticed that Harry looked as if he might make a run for it.
Harry laughed, kissing Draco on the cheek and making his cheeks go rosy. “Let me know when you’re free ok?”
“Cub, what was it you wanted to tell me?” Sirius asked, his voice soft, but not as fragile as Remus’.
“Sencha for two?” Harry asked as he approached the table, despite the old couple being the only customers left in the shop that Harry hadn’t already served.
to know what book I got you?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded. He had been curious since they were in the bookshop. Draco pulled a rather small book from the bag and passed it to Harry.
“The Black’s had a long history of being in Slytherin, only to be shattered so easily,” Lucius sighed. Narcissa was sat on the other side of the parlour, and Draco wanted nothing more than to rush to her side for a hug. “I know you won’t let me down Draco,” he said, looking at Draco in what he assumed to be a blank stare, but he could never tell with his Father.
“Remus kept on going back to the clock when the other returned and pushing the forwards by a few hours,” Harry explained, grinning at Teddy’s starstruck expression.
Draco opened the box and selected a jam tart, his expression melting into one of pure joy when he bit into it. Harry watched him, smiling.
a teashop Potter,” Malfoy clarified with a small smile. “And after, the war, I didn’t care much for doing anything else,” he shrugged, and Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t going to explain further.
“This mirror is marvellous,” Draco muttered, clearly already coming up with a list of spells needed to create such an object. “Harry is fine – well… it’s better if he explains it.”
“Of course, there is,” Draco assured, squishing Harry’s hand to let him know he was there. “If you don’t
The Hufflepuffs in his year had avoided talking to him the entire night. They hadn’t been awful, but it didn’t help the tightness in his chest when his dormmates pretended he didn’t exist. The only person who had spoken to him since his sorting had been one of the prefects, Gabriel Truman, who noticed his distance from the other Hufflepuffs. He had tapped Draco on the shoulder and told him that it’s normal to be nervous on the first night, but that Hufflepuff was like a family. Draco had simply nodded and given the prefect a small smile to get him to go away.
“I pay for this date, and you can pay for the next one,” Harry smiled, squeezing Draco’s hand with his own, kissing the man’s cheek without even thinking about it. “I was almost in Slytherin you know?”
Harry had always loved this time of year, when nature turned into warm colours, as the temperature began to drop. Perhaps it was because autumn was always the time when he was able to escape the Dursley’s – he knew that they were the reason he hated the summer months anyway.
“Used to Pansy, it’s been eight years.” Draco knew meeting at this specific café was a bad idea but he didn’t know many Muggle businesses and was certain Potter would not appreciate being seen with him in the Wizarding world
“This is where I first met Sirius,” Harry said, looking around the shack with an out of place fondness in his eyes. The room was still covered in dust and the boarded-up windows forced the sunlight in strange directions, making the room seem almost prison-like. “That was an –
Draco paused, sipping his hot chocolate. “I guess it feels like a living being,” he said. “There's a small pulse, like a heartbeat, and a warmth in some rooms, but a bone-chilling coldness in others.”
The hatch opened and Sirius climbed into the attic, brushing his hands on his trousers. “What are you boys doing, hiding up here?” he asked, smiling as Harry began to deal cards for Draco and himself.
Malfoy didn’t even flinch. “Tell that to those chairs,” he said, gesturing to the splintered remains of a few of the chairs he had exploded. “Accidental magic is dangerous past childhood Potter, and after what you did in the classroom –“
Harry placed his hands on the boy’s shoulders to steady him. “We’ll have to talk to your Grandma, but if you’d like to, you can,” he smiled, and Teddy looked as if he could float with pure joy. “You all right to travel by floo? Or would you rather side-apparate?” he asked, as Teddy picked up his trunk.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, scrambling to his feet, and pacing the tower. “Fuck!” he exclaimed, causing Malfoy to flinch. “Anything else?” he asked, looking back at Malfoy, hoping there was more he could tell Harry.
Harry had never seen Malfoy show as much emotion on his face as in that moment. “What does that mean?” Malfoy asked, staring at the horizon, watching the birds fly in the distance.
“Stay,” Harry said, despite only moments ago wanting Malfoy to leave. Maybe the potion was somewhat to blame. He saw Malfoy raise an eyebrow and he groaned. “I’m not too keen on destroying a classroom Malfoy.”
Absolutely not Potter, you’ll make a mistake at some point,” he insisted, staring intently at his two cards.
Before Hermione could respond, Ron burst through the door, with two children dangling from his arms. “You two are getting too big for this,” he huffed, swinging them through the air and onto the sofa. Shrieks of laughter could be heard from Rose and Hugo as Ron threw himself between the two, sighing loudly. “Hey mate, good to see you,” he said, his eyes half shut.
It was about three hours later when Harry realised, Draco was not kidding, nor was he exaggerating. The teashop was incredibly busy.
After explaining their idea in more detail, Harry felt as if a massive weight had lifted off his shoulders – he felt as if he could fly without his firebolt, though he wouldn’t try. The four of them sat on the cold stone ground, sipping on the Butterbeer that Remus had grabbed on his way to meet Harry. He noticed Draco glancing at him with a faint smile and grinned at the blond, who rubbed circles on Harry’s hand and Harry wondered if Draco knew that he was doing it.
Nodding, Draco picked up the book he was reading, waving it at Sirius. “It won’t read itself,” he joked, causing Sirius to smile and shake his head.
When Draco mentioned that he wouldn’t mind going to pay for the books he had found, Harry insisted on paying for Draco’s books. “Potter, you don’t have to pay for my books,” he said, shaking his head, despite the smile pushing its way onto his face.
“You can flirt with Luna later, this is important,” Ron insisted, and Luna and Ginny both went pink as Neville glanced between the two, baffled.
“It’s only ghosts,” Pansy whispered to him, sounding annoyed. “They made it sound as if they’d been attacked,” she said, and Blaise nodded his head.
He was interrupted by Harry placing his hands-on Draco’s face and pulling him in for a kiss. It was gentle. Possibly because Scorpius was behind them, possibly because neither knew exactly how the other would react. It was short but Draco felt his heart flutter and his stomach flip, and his magic explode within like a firework. When they pulled away, both of them were blushing hard and neither knew of anything more to say.
Harry found himself, once again, thinking about how strange this all was. Normally when he had a conversation with Malfoy one of them said something to piss off the other and they’d be at each other’s throats within seconds. Yet, after taking a Befuddlement Draught, a potion which renders the drinker a reckless idiot, their response was to be civilised with each other. It made it seem as if the true impetuous act for them was to become friends.
Which was why Pansy was making her grand entrance into Draco’s apartment, thankfully whilst Scorpius was at Narcissa’s.
Nodding, Draco flicked the tassel on the cushion. “I don’t know if my friends are okay with it and my parents –“ he broke off, his voice catching in his throat making him hug his knees to his chest again.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows for a moment, but she wasn’t exactly wrong; there was a lot on his mind. “I suppose we might,” he said, smiling as she passed him a teacup. “Thanks,” he grinned, sipping on the tea.
come here Teddy Bear,” Harry murmured, pulling Teddy in for another hug, letting him cry into his shirt. “Have you been worrying about this?”
with my emotions I suppose,” he joked. Draco had mentioned that Harry couldn’t tell a smile from a frown. “Although maybe it’s the peppermint tea,” he said, reliving the memory in his mind with a chuckle.
Biting back his laughter, Harry handed him the card. They were down to four cards, one set to collect, and they had been caught in a loop for the past five minutes. “Draco…” Harry managed to say, before his laughter escaped. “I’ll always end up with three cards, you with one, just give me the card so we can end this,” he pleaded, though it took him a while to say.
“That’s exactly why Andie is angry about this,” Ted explained, his voice barely above a whisper as the voices in the kitchen died down a little.
said that’s ridiculous,” Teddy said, and Harry nodded along, trying his best not to laugh at the story. The streets they were walking down were rather quiet, and the sky was a pale grey, but neither of them seemed to mind as it had been so long since they had seen each other.
“I will!” he called out, walking further onto the train. He wanted to find Blaise and Pansy as soon as possible.
“You can tell a lot about a Wizard by how good his tea is!” Ron insisted, and Harry fell into a fit of laughter. “It means he doesn’t use magic to make it,” he said, and Hermione looked contemplative for a moment.
Burying his hands in the earth, Draco found a pebble, which he held tight, nodding. “Right,” he muttered. “
“I don’t quite think it’s that far, ma petite étoile but I’m sure you’re close,” he said, lifting Scorpius off his shoulder’s so they could enter the shop.
Harry shrugged. “Either way it’s going to be torture,” Harry sighed with a smile. “At least we sit next to each other,” he grinned at Ron who grinned back.
Harry shrugged, a smile tugging at his lips. “You’ll see,” he said. Harry had spent a good while trying to figure out where to go on a date with Draco. His denial to give Draco the satisfaction of knowing where they were going
Harry copied Draco, doing as he instructed until he no longer felt as if he was going to pass out and his breathing felt easier than before. He picked up his glasses and Draco was no longer a blurry blob.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, Dumbledore wanted to see him,” he replied, still brushing the dog’s fur. The dog pushed at Harry’s hand with its head and Harry began muttering to the dog. “
“No,” Draco said, smirking at Harry who looked so close to throwing his cards at Draco. “If I let you win this set, then we
Draco nodded again, his words seeming to fail him, and tried to levitate one of the cushions but could barely get it an inch off the seat. Potter watched curiously.
Harry blushed, shrinking a little. “No need to be a prat about it,” he mumbled, and Draco muttered an apology, his ears turning pink. “But thank you,” Harry smiled, making Draco’s heart stutter.
“It’s Mrs Drooble,” Malfoy said, noticing Harry watch the old lady. “She’s going to hold me in the clutches of her conversation for the next four hours at least.”
“Very,” Draco replied, placing a teacup on the counter. “The weekend rush,” he smirked, glancing at Harry. “I’ll bring this to you when it’s done, now stop distracting me,” he said, waving his hand at Harry dismissively.
to be here,” Harry mumbled. “In fact, I still don’t really understand why you are here,” he said sceptically.
Teddy had started at Hogwarts this year, and never failed to send a letter to Harry, explaining the intricacies of modern life at Hogwarts (from what Teddy had said so far, Harry couldn’t see much of a difference from when he had attended).
Pansy sighed, “he won’t, and you know it. At most he’ll tell you to leave and we’ll have to find a different option.”
He overheard a group of Ravenclaw’s theorising on how the Chamber was opened, curious as to why no one was accused but it was suddenly safe for students to be in school.
Unsure of what to say, Harry blinked rapidly as his eyes stung. “Why would you want to adopt me now?”
“Tell me about it,” Draco smirked. “My Mother can’t talk to me, I’ve been disowned, I’m living with my estranged, fugitive cousin and a band of merry misfits.” That made Harry snort. “And all I thought I’d do with my time is sit in a library.”
Harry reminded Teddy to change his hair from bubble-gum pink to a dark brown as they walked into Muggle London. It was much easier to go unnoticed by Muggles and apparate home without brightly coloured hair.
a plan of Voldemort’s that he heard, then he risked a lot to tell you anything,” Sirius pointed out.
McGonagall’s office,” Teddy corrected himself, making sure he wasn’t walking on the cracks in the pavement between the stones as he held hands with Harry. “And they said they saw the sword of Gryffindor, but
“You’re glowing!” he exclaimed, his book no longer more interesting than what was happening. “Like those Muggle street lights!” he added, making both Draco and Harry chuckle.
Even though Harry wanted to see them both, he knew it was a bad idea, that they would get caught. Remus would get accused of plotting against the Ministry, and Sirius would get sent to Azkaban.
He wasn’t sure why it was only just settling in – the reality of his situation. He had a month at his aunt’s house, but perhaps then it felt like a dream.
Harry grabbed Draco’s collar and pulled him closer, standing on the balls of his feet to meet Draco’s lips with his own as Draco tipped his head forwards, cupping Harry’s face with his hands. As their lips met, it was like when a wave crashes upon the sand; chaotic, intense, awe inspiring and yet somehow, incredibly natural, as if they had done this for thousands of years. It was strange to think they had once been enemies. Harry couldn’t imagine doing anything with Draco other than snogging him senseless in the corner of bookshop.
With a shrug, Harry brought his knees to his chest. “No point,” he mumbled, resting his head on his knees.
Draco let out a burst of laughter, quickly stopping himself as Harry raised his eyebrows. “You have a terrible memory Harry,” he pointed out.
“Thanks,” he said, his breath hitching in his throat slightly. He coughed. “So, when will you get busy?’ Harry asked, pouring himself some tea.
“Why would that –“ Harry’s words were interrupted by his thoughts as he realised what Malfoy was saying. “You
“Suit yourself, but you’re missing out,” Harry shrugged as he took a sip of what Draco could only assume was sugar water by this point. “You said you had Healer exams coming up?”
“I used to hate Samhain,” Draco began, pouring Harry a cup of the surprise tea of the day. “But then, the war happened,” he said darkly, starting intently at the cinnamon stick he had just placed in the teacup.
Harry chuckled, and Draco snapped his head back to Harry, blinking repeatedly as if that would change Harry’s smile. “Aren’t we cheerful?” he giggled, making Draco smile fondly. “
“Sorry,” Sirius said, quickly trying to cover his laughter. “I’m not laughing at you, I just remembered; Reggie used to tell me that sometimes, it was what he imagined it was like to be high.”
about Kreacher is concerning,” she said, looking lost in thought. “Do you think,” she began, before whispering, “do you think he
The volume within the shop had gone up tenfold, however it took a while for Harry to notice as Scorpius was showing Harry the multiple drawings he had done. As Scorpius was showing him a drawing that he had done of the three of them (which melted his heart), Harry realised, that Draco – the stubborn bastard – was not going to ask for help, despite being on the verge of being unable to cope with the amount of work he had to do.
“I know you’re teasing me but, even though I’d be shit at it, it would be so much better,” he sighed, lifting his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose.
Draco’s lips parted. He wasn’t expecting Harry to ask him that. “I know he was your father’s best friend,” Draco said apprehensively, as if testing the waters for something. “And I – Harry I don’t know if you know this – he wasn’t the one to sell out your parents to the Dark – to
Shrugging, Harry tried to keep a straight face. “I’m a man of simple pleasures Draco,” he replied, the façade breaking for a moment as he laughed. He covered it with a cough.
“Do you think Snape’s going to be in a bad or awful mood today?” Ron asked Harry with a nudge, forcing him to look away from Malfoy.
“But I can’t,” Harry said, squeezing his hands into fists. “I’m at the top of Voldemort’s kill list.”
Draco opened the door and immediately folded his arms. “What time do you call this?” he asked, a smirk pulling at the corner of his lips.
Looking at Harry to see if he were being serious, Draco wondered whether that would be a good idea. “I wouldn’t want to intrude or anything -“
Draco suddenly had an idea he was sure he’d regret. “You said you need to ask some questions before hand?”
“Merlin Potter,” Draco said, using his other hand to mess with Harry’s hair. “Your hair’s tickling my neck.”
“Mr Malfoy,” McGonagall said to him, her voice quiet. “Go join your house please,” she said, and Draco realised he hadn’t moved off the stool.
Harry nodded, smiling. “I might have not known her, but I believe she would be,” he grinned, feeling light in his chest as Draco grinned back.
This made Draco roll his eyes. “Probably none,” Draco said, not voicing the fact he didn’t really want to be in Slytherin. “Where did you go on holiday?” Draco asked, making Blaise grin as he admired his own tan.
“I will fight you,” he said, his eyes lit with the same fire Draco had seen in their first year. “Now play, give me the Queen of Diamonds,” he commanded.
you should feel something if you place your hand close, like this,” Harry said, moving his hand over the neck of the stag.
He pulled the Mirror shard from the bottom of his trunk and called to Sirius, releasing a breath he didn’t know he was holding when Sirius picked up his end of the mirror, hearing Sirius fumble to grasp the mirror and trip over something, creating a loud
“Pansy, you know it has nothing to do with pride,” he said, feeling a throbbing at the back of his skull.
Wandering through the halls, he didn’t really remember how he ended up in the foyer outside the Great Hall. He saw Hannah Abbott in the corner of his eye, a look of concern evident on her face. “Draco,” she said, waking him from his mindless wandering. “Are you…” she trailed off as she scanned his face, sighing. “Just, don’t wander too far into the forest, okay?” she said, her smile not reaching her eyes.
Harry nodded. “It’s, he hasn’t lived with me for years, and if he finds out I’m seeing someone who has a kid that I see
“Well it’s in the correct order now so yes, yes I am,” he grinned, picking up the books from Harry and, seemingly without hesitation, holding Harry’s hand again – it took everything within him not to grin like a lunatic, but Harry was pretty sure he was failing at it. “Oh for Merlin’s sake!” Draco exclaimed rather suddenly, almost causing Harry to jump out of his skin.
Malfoy took a deep breath, trying to regain some composure as they approached the pond. Scorpius looked at Harry, mirroring his confusion. “It’s the Nargles,” Scorpius said, completely convinced. Harry covered his spluttered laugh with a cough.
“Yes, well, we’ve already established that you have the observational skills of a brick wall Harry,” Draco smirked, bringing Harry’s hand to his lips. “You always have,” he said, lightly kissing the back of Harry’s hand.
It was as Harry was passing the books to the cashier, that Draco seemed to regain his composure. “Wait a moment,” he muttered. “I call foul play,” he said, glaring at Harry.
Chuckling, Draco moved his hand slightly, never letting go, and tangled their fingers together. “I do,” he smiled. “Astoria, she taught me that there’s more to this life then the mistakes we made, as long as we’re willing to change for the better,” he said, staring intently at the tattoo. “I can’t expect forgiveness from others, but I can strive for indifference.”
is Malfoy here?” Ginny asked, still ready to fight Draco at any sign of danger. She hadn’t heard the conversation between the two boys as Draco only spoke loud enough for Harry to hear him.
“Don’t mind Pansy, she tends to opt for the dramatics,” Zabini chuckled as Parkinson squatted his arm. “The sentiment still holds of course – Slytherins protect their own,” he explained, still flashing a dazzling smile. This unnerved Harry more than Parkinson’s direct threat. “But she means well.”
“One,” Harry replied with a soft smile as Teddy did a small victory dance and picked up the largest chocolate bar, placing it in the trolly. “Sirius told me that Remus had a go at them all because it was only supposed to be going back by five minutes each night, but instead Sirius and my Dad moved it by four hours.”
After a moment of silence, Harry grabbed Draco's free hand and started to trace along the indents in his palm. Draco gasped at the gentle touch but didn’t protest, so Harry continued. They sat in the presence of each other for what could have been hours. Harry’s mind had been quite preoccupied tonight as they sat in their usual spot on the Astronomy Tower.
,” she said, pointing her wand at the two. Harry instantly felt a warmth spread through his body and sighed in relief; Ron had a similar reaction.
“You know,” Harry said, smirking at Draco. “You might be better at charms, but there is one thing I’m good at,” he said, sitting up straight. He muttered an incantation under his breath and a stag burst forth from his wand.
“Thanks for not being a prick about it,” Ron said, chuckling. “I just want a slow life you know? I talked to ‘Mione about it and she said I should just – go for it,” Ron explained. “Stop with a job I hate,” he sighed, shoving his hands in his empty pockets. “And maybe I’ll take up a part-time job eventually, help George out or something.”
Sirius shook his head. “I’m not leaving you there Harry,” he insisted, his words never wavering. “Do you need me to visit?”
He also looked in the crowd for Harry and saw him clutching at the hem of his robes, glancing at the floor. He was able to – somehow – catch his attention and tilted his head slightly, as if to ask if he was okay. Harry shrugged, and Draco offered what he hoped was an encouraging smile and a small thumbs up. There was a moment of confusion that danced across his face, but then Harry returned the smile with a nod.
Ignoring Ginny, Harry leaned into the blond’s touch, shaking his head. “He has Sirius, and I need to – I have to save him,” he said breathlessly, and Draco pulled him into a hug, pressing his lips to the top of Harry’s head.
“Did I tell you about the first time I used the floo?” Harry asked, lugging Teddy’s trunk into the corridor. The lightening charm had worn off due to apparating; he’d take it up to Teddy’s room in a bit.
With a sharp nod, Malfoy glanced back at Scorpius, his cheeks rosier than before. He sighed in relief when Scorpius beckoned him over to the ducks.
“How you ever got anything above a D, is beyond me,” Draco said, reading through Harry’s potion essay, brushing his fingers through Harry’s hair as his head was on Draco's lap. “Your handwriting is abysmal Potter.”
They sat in silence for a minute as Sirius gathered his thought. Harry began to play with the tassels on the ends of his curtains.
Potter raised an eyebrow, clearly expecting some sort of witty remark back. He shrugged, “it’s alright, I’ve been wondering when you’d decide to get your wand checked. I assume that’s why you’re here?” he asked, waiting for a reply.
“Sirius Black,” he said, watching as his reflection vanished as it does when you throw a stone at a still puddle. It rippled until a different view came into focus. “Sirius?” he called out, assuming his shard was on a table.
,” he chastised, pulling on the sleeve of her robes to turn her back around. “He’s really shy,” he explained, looking at Harry to see if he had noticed.
Harry chuckled, leaning towards Draco as well. “Hermione says it’s why people find me attractive,” he said, flashing a grin at Draco.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. “And if I know Harry, he’s probably going to want to hex something,” he joked.
“Positive,” Draco said, his teeth gritted as he furiously scribbled at the piece of parchment, despite knowing it was a waste of parchment. “If
Sirius shook his head, his grin staying firmly on his face. “Told me so himself in my seventh year, he cornered me in-between lessons and told me everything. He pretended to be everything our parents wanted because he knew it would be bad if he didn’t. Then he told me that they expected him to take the mark,” he said solemnly.
In hindsight, Harry had been rather anxious, and Draco was correct, he needed to sit down and take a breath. After some tea, Draco had smiled and assured Harry that Grimmauld Place was lovely.
He felt the usual pull from beneath his feet as he apparated and held on tight to Teddy. As they landed, Harry quickly turned to Teddy to see if he was okay, to see him grinning. “That’s so much better when you know what to expect,” Teddy said, laughing.
he thought to himself. “And don’t talk with your mouth full,” he scolded, but Teddy ignored him, focusing more on the first thing he said.
“It’s not really haunted Draco, you’ll be fine,” Harry chuckled, as Draco lost his usual cool demeanour.
Hermione scrunched up her nose. “Maybe an advisor to the Minister,” she pondered. “But Kingsley is actually rather a good Minister.”
Harry felt cold relieve corse through his veins as he heard that no one died. He was also glad to hear that the Order managed to arrest some of the Death Eater who were there. However, when Harry asked who had been arrested, Sirius went rigid and Remus looked somewhat pained. Remus asked if Draco was with him, and Harry watched as Draco stiffened too, looking sickly pale as Harry nodded slowly, piecing it together.
’ replayed over and over in Harry’s mind. Harry had never thought about it being abuse. “Pads,” Remus said quietly. Harry only just heard Remus speak.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, thanks and doing this does give me more time for customers,” he said, sipping his tea. “So, you have a son?” Harry asked, leaning into his seat.
Ron glanced at Hermione; his eyebrows furrowed. “You’re far from fine Harry, even bloody Snape can tell somethings wrong,” Ron said, tired of asking the same question. It was true that Snape had been less vindictive for the past few days.
Teddy’s mouth fell open. “But then people would notice right? Hagrid told me it went on for weeks,” he said, leaning on the handle of the trolly as Harry picked up fruit and veg to put in said trolly.
As the whistle blew on the kettle, the fireplace roared into life; green flames swirling and twisting up the chimney as Andromeda stepped from within the fire into the kitchen. “Harry dear?” she called out, using her wand to remove the soot from her robes.
Harry nodded, humming. “Told me to be thankful for my memory,” he said, glancing over at them to see they were deep in conversation.
“I’ll visit,” Harry said, covering his mouth with his teacup. “I – I will, I miss him too,” he admitted, and Andromeda smiled warmly.
Harry had mentioned that he didn’t blame Ron and Hermione for how things transpired over the summer, but that didn’t mean that he was completely all right with them, as Draco had assumed.
Logically, he knew that it would be better if he let himself face this feeling, rather than pushing it inside, filing it away with all his other emotions on the subject. Yet, it had been neglected for so long, it was painful to bring it to the surface; it was painful to imagine what it would feel like to allow this emotion to exist.
As soon as he reached the Astronomy Tower, his breath became shallow and the room began to spin. He sat next to the door and tried his best to breathe but it was hard, he couldn’t focus on anything and his thoughts were racing out of control.
“Sadly,” Remus muttered, laughing as Sirius elbowed him. Harry blinked, dazed. He never noticed, but it explained
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Of course you don’t, I remember you used to put at least seven sugars in your tea at school,” he sniffed, and Harry felt his face warm.
people,” Draco said, laughing as Pansy’s eyes widened and her mouth fell open. Blaise failed to supress his laughter.
“Yes!” he exclaimed, his face grimacing as he thought about what he just said. “And it’s Malfoy! Bloody
“I’ve had that conversation one too many times,” Harry joked, running a hand through his hair as he glanced over at Draco, who was still watching him curiously.
The sound of feet on the stairs caught Harry’s attention, and he glanced over to see Draco, who was wearing a brown turtleneck and jeans. It was odd to see Draco looking so incredibly Muggle.
,” before pulling Harry’s face to his and connecting their lips, shocking not only Harry but clearly Malfoy himself, who Harry suspected had never made a rash decision in his life.
Draco smiled; it was a small smile, as if he had just witnessed a private joke occur. “Yes,” he said, his voice soft as a wool. “She wasn’t pleased about the idea, I think she blamed herself for my situation,” Draco explained, still rubbing his thumb over the delicate flowers as they swayed slightly, as if someone has blown upon them. “But she was the only person I wished to live for at the time,” he said, his face still.
Heart in hand, Harry reached out for Draco’s, intertwining their fingers as the winter sun prompted him to smile at the other man. Unable to contain himself, Harry pulled out the book that he had picked in the bookshop. “I got this book for you,” he said, his fingers brushing imaginary dust off the cover. “I read the summary on the back and thought you’d like it.”
“Well then what do you recommend? I know nothing about tea,” Harry grinned, changing the topic after noticing Malfoy’s odd reaction to mentioning his family. Harry had managed to glance at the long list of tea, and he recognised two.
his legal guardian, since Andromeda decided she’s too old to raise a child.” Draco watched as in the photo, the boy’s hair went from honey blond to bubblegum pink. He felt bad that he didn’t carry any photos of Scorpius around. “I tried to tell her she wasn’t, but she insisted I cared for him. I’m glad I said yes.” Harry smiled at the photo before he put it back in his pocket.
“That was awful,” Teddy said, scrunching his face up as he clutched his head to stop him from getting dizzy.
“Did you know dragon’s fire breath can be up to 300°C?” Scorpius said, bouncing enthusiastically on the armchair, and Scorpius then began to explain everything he knew about dragons; Harry was amazed at how much this child knew. Half of the facts he was explaining, Harry had never heard before.
It wasn’t bad to begin with, Harry found the training to be rather enjoyable, and the fact that Ron joined with him,
“Did you –“ Harry began, unsure how to approach the subject. “Did you see much of your Dad before he…” Harry trailed off.
“This is a complete rip-off of a Tale of Two Cities,” Draco said, as he placed a book Harry couldn’t see the cover of, back on the shelf. “A blatant one at that, too,” he muttered, scowling at the book, as though it had personally offended him. “People could at least have some creativity and change the names of the characters
“Thanks Potter,” he replied, leaning forwards, and connecting their foreheads. Harry’s breath hitched and his face burned. Harry’s stomach flipped and a smile creeped its way onto Harry’s face as they stayed like this for a little while longer.
“Don’t, please,” Harry said, not wanting anymore pity. “He knows it’s a bad idea but, he won’t listen to reason, neither will Remus.”
“I’m going to need you to take some deep breaths, do you think you can do that?” Draco asked, his voice calm and pleasant.
It wasn’t long before Malfoy returned, carrying a small tray. Upon the tray was a rather unusual looking teapot, covered in a mass of painted swirling leaves, curving around the handle, and a matching teacup with a silver tea strainer delicately balanced on top. There was also a tiny pot of a golden liquid Harry assumed was honey.
“Thanks,” Harry smiled, trying not to laugh. “I hope I win too if I’m honest, I rather enjoy living.” He grinned as Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco said sincerely. They held eye contact for a minute, but it felt like longer, until Scorpius came bounding into the kitchen, holding a stuffed dragon that was almost half the size of him.
However, they didn’t need to; Harry was already halfway out the door when he realised what he’d done.
Harry scrunched up his face, shaking his head as if to remove a certain thought. He stood there, and Draco suddenly felt the urge to hug him. He looked so worn down, so vulnerable, and Draco understood the feeling all too well.
had quite a few regulars. The boy smiled politely at the regulars and held himself as if he was ten years older.
Harry pointed a finger at him. “Your smile says otherwise,” he said, raising an eyebrow with a smirk.
is back, I know that – my father.” He tried to get the words out, but they faltered. He noticed the ink on the parchment was running and realised he must be crying. “Mother will most definitely allow him to disown me now,” he said, balling up the letter and throwing it at the closest bookshelf, biting his lip in the hopes it would stop him from crying.
“Potter, are you listening?” Draco asked, grinning. Harry realised he had been staring at Draco with a positively lovestruck expression on his face.
“Harry, no!” Scorpius giggled, shaking his head as Harry pretended to not know how to whisk cake batter. “That’s not how you do it,” he said, looking at his father as if he was exasperated. Draco brought a hand up to his lips to hide a smile, but it was clear that he wanted to laugh at Harry’s antics. “Here,
“Hello,” Draco said to the lady opposite his mother, who he assumed to be his aunt. She had a face almost identical to his mothers, but where Narcissa’s expression was stoic and blank, this woman’s face was warm and inviting. Whilst Narcissa had straight platinum hair, Andromeda had long brown curls, similar to the blond ones Draco had when his mother didn’t brush his hair back. The curls were soft and neat, not unruly and Draco was instantly soothed by her presence.
Harry sighed and decided he didn’t want to walk the rest of the way home, so as soon as he was sure he wouldn’t be seen, he apparated to Grimmauld place.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I just didn’t think it was important,” he shrugged, forcing Blaise to look away from Harry. “Besides, I only found out on the train.”
After a second of hesitation, Draco removed the cloak and folded it, passing it back to Harry. “Git,” he muttered with a smirk as Harry took the cloak.
“Why wouldn’t I? And don’t say what you’re going to say,” Harry added, seeing Draco open his mouth. “You’re easy to talk to and I like talking to you.”
“Wow,” Scorpius said, his eyes fixed on the stag as it approached the small blond. “Can I pet him?” he asked excitedly.
This left Draco with many questions, but he knew not to ask them. There were certain topics a person should leave alone. There was a tension in the air that told Draco he should appreciate that Sirius told him this much. He was relieved to know he wasn’t alone in feeling numb.
As Draco noticed Harry staring, he began rubbing the tattoo, a grim smile pulling at his features. Once again, he answered the question on Harry’s mind before he even got the change to ask it. “They’re Narcissus flowers, after –“
Harry looked at him curiously, inching closer to Draco and placing a hand on his arm. “You’re right,” he said, his eyes filled with a similar fire that Draco had seen in the robe shop, though for entirely different reasons.
Harry didn’t want to explain the dream, but he did explain that he needed to get into Umbridge’s office to use the floo and to do that, they needed to get her out of her office.
fucking pampered,” he said, glaring at Snape (who looked caught off-guard) as if he wanted the man to explode.
“Your Auntie is a good friend of mine,” Harry said, leaning back on his chair. “My Godchild is her grandson,” he explained, and Scorpius scrunched his eyebrows together.
” he muttered to himself, leaning back on the armchair. “When your friends come to you with an issue, how do you feel?” he asked.
“That’s irrelevant,” Sirius said, waving a hand dismissively. “But that’s also exactly why I’m your favourite.”
“Don’t worry,” Hermione said, standing up. “I’ll go make sure they don’t hurt themselves,” she said, smiling meekly at Ron who nodded at her.
“Perhaps not in those words, but he didn’t need to say it all,” she grinned. “An old woman sees things you know.”
“Pretty much,” he grinned. “And is this your son?” he asked, noticing the smaller Malfoy who waved excitedly.
Blaise laughed as Pansy groaned. “You’re a sap Draco, honestly,” she complained, grinning, nonetheless. “Wait a minute,” she said, stealing a quick glance behind her, and Draco knew she had seen his scar as Harry brushed his fingers through his fringe. “
Opening his mouth to reply, Harry seemed to second guess himself. He sighed. “I’m – not sleeping well,” he admitted, avoiding Draco’s gaze, and opting to look at the carpet instead.
Harry snapped his head away from the door to look at Hermione. “I have not!” he exclaimed, feeling his anger levels rise as Ron agreed.
Malfoy stared blankly at Harry, as if he had been caught red handed stealing from Snapes personal store cupboard. He sighed before he spoke. “The same reason you are,” he said, and Harry raised his eyebrows, doubtful that Malfoy spent the first eleven years of his life sleeping in a cupboard. “Not the
“So, we need a distraction?” Hermione added, looking lost in thought as she tried to figure out what would be a decent distraction.
“That’s the plan,” Harry said, smiling as Teddy jumped from the stone pavement to the tarmac one as they rounded the corner, deciding to hold Harry’s hand.
“I didn’t know it was common for families to be in the same house,” Draco muttered, more to himself than anyone else.
Malfoy looked at Harry with an amused glint in his eye. “We accept Galleons Potter,” he said. “The tea is seven Sickles.”
Even though tomorrow was the thirty-first of October, Harry felt at peace as he walked along the pavement, admiring the scattered Halloween decorations on the houses. Harry remembered when he spent Halloween in America and he was baffled by the frenzy that was caused by Halloween, but it was oddly charming. No one in London is particularly crazed about Halloween except the children who ran from house to house to get free sweets.
“I – but that was years ago!” Harry exclaimed, a cold feeling rushing through his body as Malfoy laughed bitterly.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and began to laugh, biting his lip to try and stop himself. “Do you pay attention
Draco thought for a moment. He had briefly wondered what his life would be like when he became a Healer, but he hadn’t gone into great detail. “I’m going to spend more time with Scorpius, and probably my mother. I want him to know that in my life, he always comes first,” he said slowly, not sure if he should go into much more detail.
He was a child, who got dragged into a war by his own father who chose a lunatic over his own family.
Scorpius was staring at Harry in awe. He hoped it was because he could speak to snakes and not because he set one on his cousin. Draco, on the other hand, looked as if he was about to explode into a fit of giggles.
Harry chuckled. “Of course,” he nodded. “I was thinking about thanking you with a kiss and,” he paused, watching as one of Draco's eyebrows twitched upwards. “The jam tarts I got from the kitchens earlier,” he sighed, forcing himself not to laugh as Draco's hand froze, “Oh well, I’ll just have to -"
He coughed as he inhaled the black smoke coming from the front of the train. It stung his eyes a little too. He shook his hands, taking a deep breath when the smoke when gone. His eyes flickered across the platform to see if he could see a head of black curls.
“The shops are open to influence from the black market,” Harry explained, sitting opposite Teddy. “Which means quite a few dodgy people hang about there.” Harry pushed Teddy’s hair from his eyes. “So, listen to your Grandma,
Harry chuckled, ruffling Scorpius’ hair. “Hey Scorp’,” he said, placing his arm over Teddy’s shoulders, hoping he wasn’t feeling overwhelmed. “This is my son, Teddy,” he introduced, watching as Teddy beamed at being referred to as Harry’s son.
he never questioned why Malfoy was on his mind almost all the time like an obsession – like his sixth year.
” Harry exclaimed, opening the door for Draco. “Who was the Gryffindor?” he asked, raising his eyebrows.
Once Sirius pulled away from Harry, he heard Draco whisper in his ear, almost inaudible, “Cub?” teasingly, and Harry elbowed the empty space, smirking when he felt his elbow connect with Draco under the cloak. “Merlin’s Mother Potter, you’ve got sharp elbows,” Draco groaned, still under the cloak. Sirius and Remus both raised their eyebrows at the sound of another voice, and Harry knew they had already guessed who it was.
“How are you so good with children?” Draco whispered, leaning towards Harry as Scorpius was patiently scooping the mixture into the cupcake cases.
Andromeda simply stared at him. “How did you know?” she asked. Ted looked at his wife, flabbergasted.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You underestimate me Draco,” he drawled. “I think I’m strong enough to hold a teapot,” he said pointedly.
Then, he saw him, squashing himself against the window, watching the tree’s fly by. “Harry!” Draco exclaimed, opening the compartment door. As he did, he realised that Harry wasn’t alone. “Oh, sorry, hello,” he said, smiling at the ginger haired boy sat opposite Harry.
The door chimed and Malfoy glanced up, sighing as he caught sight of who entered. Following his line of sight, Harry glanced at who had just entered and noticed a familiar, little old lady.
“You know,” Cedric began, as the fire crackled and spat sparks on the stone mantle. “Suffering in silence causes more pain to those around you than talking to those who care for you,” he explained. Draco didn’t understand what he meant. “Your friends can
Harry glared at Draco, who’s eyes suddenly lit up as he glanced behind Harry at one of the displays. “What have you seen?” Harry asked with a lazy smile, his eyebrows raised.
It happened when the night was at its darkest, the moon at its highest, and the house at its quietest. Surprisingly, it wasn’t the creak of the door that woke Draco, but the sound of feet, walking down the hall.
“I’ll try my best,” Harry grinned, but it quickly fell from his face when he saw the castle begin to glow. “We should probably head inside, shouldn’t we?” he asked.
,” Ron blurted. “Sorry Harry, I should have known you didn’t know anything about Quidditch,” he said, his ears turning red.
Harry turned to his boyfriend who shrugged, a pink hue covering his face. “They’re interesting,” he mumbled.
Sighing, Harry started to fiddle with the edge if his robes. “I told them everything, and they said I don’t ever have to go back there.”
,” he said. “But I don’t think I can,” he admitted, leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder. Draco was confused as to what he meant but didn’t want to push.
He watched as Draco bit back a laugh. “Harry, I’m known to be quite the reckless idiot now and then,” he smirked, and Harry groaned, remembering the Potion’s incident.
“But it’s only three types of coin,” Draco insisted. “Twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, seventeen Sickles to a Galleon, simple,” he shrugged, as if it was memorable.
The door creaked open, and Draco’s eyes darted in the direction of the noise. “Draco?” It was Harry. “What are you doing in here?” he asked, his eyebrows furrowing as his eyes scanned Draco’s face for an answer.
–!“ he screamed, the words tearing at his throat, making his eyes water. He noticed Harry was watching him, baffled by the outburst. “Sorry,” he said, sitting back down on the bank with a thud. “Sorry, I was just,
His mother helped him through the crowd, levitating his trunk onto the train, placing a lightening charm on it so he’d be able to get it off the train. “Sorry your father couldn’t see you off darling,” she said. Her voice had always sounded like wind-chimes to Draco – it was calming.
Beth nodded. “Well, it’ll only get worse I’m afraid dear,” she smiled. “We shan’t keep you, but it’s wonderful to see a new face, isn’t it love?” she asked Hilda who nodded.
“I –“ Harry began, unable to continue as a blush crawled up his spine, flooding his face. “Alright, fine, I am a bit unobservant, but to be fair…” he trailed off, unable to think of a justification that would wipe the smug look off Draco’s face.
The two sat in silence for a moment, as Harry continued to stare out the window, and Draco noticed he was fidgeting with the bottom of his t-shirt. “I see Cedric die, every night,” Harry said, closing his eyes as Draco’s blood ran cold. “Again, and again,
“No!” Teddy said, shaking his head violently, only to be betrayed by another yawn. “Maybe a little,” he admitted, taking a sip of hot chocolate. “But I have so much to tell you about Hogwarts and my new friends and –“
,” Harry insisted. They’d had this conversation many times over the past few hours. Draco had never pushed Harry, although his opinion on the matter was exceedingly clear.
“I’ll be there in a moment,” he heard a voice float from somewhere in the shop. “Please have a seat,” the voice said again. Draco recognised it to be Potter’s voice and he wondered if he would have been so polite had he known it was Draco who just walked into the store.
“Hey, hey, take a breath Cub,” Sirius said, placing down whatever it was he was holding. “As you can see, I’m not at the Ministry, however that dream…” he muttered, his eyebrows drawing together.
“I don’t think it would affect my position if they knew,” Draco shrugged with a sigh. “But only if you want to.”
Realising his blunder, Sirius shook his head and Draco could feel Sirius’ eyes on him. “It means she has a plan; a plan she believes will result in the best outcome for
“But we can’t hold it against them if they don’t know something,” Draco said, nodding in confidence and smiling at one of the ghosts, who he assumed to be the Fat Friar as he was saying something about Hufflepuff.
Trying to calm his nerves, he took a deep breath, swallowing as much pride and fear as he could before he walked into the shop. A little bell dinged over his head as he entered, and to his delight, he wasn’t hexed or asked to leave the moment he stepped foot in the shop. In fact, he had no greeting as he entered the shop, it looked deserted. He almost yelped in surprise when he saw a tree branch in front of him. Potter had appeared to turn his shop into a mini forest.
“Who would he get in trouble with?” Ron asked. “His dad? Not the scariest of blokes overall, is he?”
“He taught Sirius and my Dad,” Harry explained to Draco, who nodded. “I still find it weird we don’t have Muggle card games,” he said, furrowing his eyebrows together before he shrugged.
“Being surrounded by like-minded people helps,” Harry agreed. “It helps,” he muttered, quickly shaking his head. “So, tell me, what
Draco continued to stare at the fire, hugging his knees close to him. “But they shouldn’t have to deal with
,” he insisted, not having the strength to argue with her over this. He had been studying for his Healer exam that was coming up, though he wasn’t sure how he’d ever pass at this rate. It took him a few years but when he was accepted onto the Healer apprenticeship scheme, he was so happy he almost cried as he told Pansy – though she still swears dying would be less painful than letting Draco give her medical attention.
The door to the living room creaked open slightly, and Draco waltzed in, looking particularly smug. Harry was mildly amused when the dragon almost collided with his head. “Why thank you Potter,” Draco smirked, joining them on the floor. “It’s good to see you can finally admit to my superior skills,” he joked, and Harry rolled his eyes.
“Potter, I’m one of the last people who would accuse you of lying at the moment,” Malfoy said, his gaze unshifting from Harry who furrowed his eyebrows.
“It’s only been three months Pansy, let him breathe,” Blaise scolded, but he was smiling. “Excited?” he asked.
“My name is Draco Malfoy,” he said, and Ron chuckled, amused that Draco’s go to in every situation appeared to be to reveal his name. Draco scowled at Ron who instantly flattened his expression. “Son of Narcissa Black,” he said, looking at Ron who suddenly seemed to understand why he said it. Harry watched over Draco’s shoulder as Kreacher stiffened.
“Hermione’s not wrong,” Harry muttered with a forced laugh. “And that sounds, actually that sounds great,” he grinned.
He opened the door and was hit by the smell of tea and cinnamon. It was a pleasant combination, but the thoughts of relaxation were quickly interrupted when he saw a man with sky blue hair, similar to that of the man at the pond, behind the counter. He was tall, his features sharp, and the hair made the man seem ethereal, but Harry recognised the man almost instantly, and took a sharp intake of breath as they made eye contact.
“I had another dream, and you were at the Ministry, but Voldemort was torturing you and – I don’t want you to – I’m glad you’re alive,” he said breathlessly, trying to control his breathing.
With a smile, Harry pulled the invisibility cloak from his cloak with a dramatic flourish. “Ta-da,” he said, laughing as Draco raised an eyebrow.
“I’ll keep you safer than the safest,” he shrugged, and Harry looked bewildered. “Come on Potter, I never back down from a challenge,” he said, his smirk widening into a grin.
It pushed its way into his hair, dragging it out of his face and forcing it to stand on end. He took a deep breath, the cold air filling his lungs and making him shiver. Draco hadn’t taken a scarf, and the best he could do to keep warm was wrap his cloak further around himself.
“Dragons seem to bring people together,” Harry grinned, remembering that Scorpius asked Harry a similar question when they first met.
The rest of the day was filled with apple and cinnamon cupcakes and laughter. Harry couldn’t help but stare at Draco and he also couldn’t help smiling whenever he got caught. He noticed that Draco couldn’t help but smile either. Scorpius began to hum a tune that Harry vaguely recognised, and Draco, noticing that they were both humming along to each other, pulled out a record and began to play the song. The three of them danced around the living room and Scorpius’ giggles mixed with Draco’s carefree laughter made Harry realise how at home he felt.
It landed with a soft splash, but Draco’s screaming caused Harry to tense, freezing in place. His back straightened as if someone had tied a string to his spine and pulled it – hard. He looked ready to bolt it.
A few days passed and Harry had started to notice Ron’s worried glances at Harry as his eyes scanned the corridors for Malfoy – not to mention he had been studying the Marauders map – Ron was certain that Harry was obsessing over his conversation with Malfoy to avoid confronting what he said in Potions – which Harry insisted wasn’t the case.
Harry hummed in response, shifting his position slightly to get more comfortable. “Potter again is it?” Harry teased.
“It was nice meeting you too Scorpius,” Harry said, ruffling his hair and making Scorpius giggle. “And I’ll see you soon,” he said, looking at Draco with a small smile.
Harry’s smile widened into a grin and he began to laugh. “You’re insulting me,” Harry said once his laughter had died down, though Malfoy was looking at him as if he’d lost his grip on whatever sanity he had. “You almost had me worried,” he said, trying not to laugh again.
“I’m not… too sure…” Draco replied, but his focus was on Harry, who was staring at his hands and now glued to Draco’s side.
He nodded, supressing a groan as Sirius’ smile widened. “It was so, weird,” he said, watching as Sirius nodded in understanding.
Draco sniffed and held his head high. “As it should be,” he nodded, a faint smile on his lips. He walked towards the Whomping Willow and glanced back at Harry who gestured for him to continue. “If you run my clothes Potter -"
“Believe me, I wanted to,” Malfoy said, sighing. “I’ve learnt to accept it though,” he added, looking out of the tower.
Harry should have expected it to happen eventually, if anything he was surprised it didn’t happen sooner. However, being pulled into an empty classroom on the way to the Great Hall was not when nor where he expected it to happen.
Draco’s eyes narrowed as he examined the empty space where Harry’s body had been. “But invisibility cloaks
“He misses you Harry,” she chastised one day over tea. The two of them were sat in her back garden, watching as Teddy ran around in circles with an energy only known to five-year olds.
Ron continued to make sputtering noises as Hermione rolled her eyes and Harry felt a little lighter. He had been so worried that they would hate Draco, it was nice to know they didn’t.
Harry shrugged, still chuckling at Sirius. “Same as usual, Umbridge is still a bitch – I mean, horrible person,” he added quickly.
“Wasn’t there a book you wanted to read?” Harry asked, leaning back a little, smiling softly. “The –
Draco passed Harry the books he was currently holding, muttering about how disappointed he was in the staff of the shop. “First of all,” he said, picking up one of the books in the middle. “You’d have thought that perhaps they had ordered them by their publication date, but apparently not,” he said, frowning as he pushed the rest of the books to one side. “It’s not the correct order, but it is an order,” he said to Harry, who nodded.
As he was waiting, Harry took another look at the decorations. “Preparing for Halloween tomorrow?” he asked, wondering what the Malfoy Halloween traditions were.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly Potter,” he said, sounding exhausted, but the smile on his face said otherwise.
He wasn’t able to finish his sentence as Pansy leaped out of her seat to smother him with her arms so he would be unable to continue his sentence. Blaise was currently helping neither of them, he had decided to sit in a fit of laughter.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Ha ha, you’re hilarious,” he deadpanned. “Anyway, you clearly like me, even if it’s only a little, you said
Harry felt his heart rise to his throat. “I –“ he began, swallowing down his fear and his anxieties on the idea. “I’m thinking of quitting my job,” he said quietly, bringing the teacup up to his mouth, as if he would be able to hide behind it.
“Mr Potter,” Madam Pomfrey said sternly, and Harry rubbed the back of his neck. Draco watched curiously as the dog appeared to be smirking.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “Depends, what’s the tea?” he asked, enjoying the way Draco’s mouth curled in an amused smile.
Breaking eye contact, Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “I had no idea you could speak French,” he said, sparing a quick glance at Draco, only to feel his face flush as Draco pushed his green hair from his forehead, watching Harry with amusement.
Sirius stared at Draco for a moment before bursting into laughter. “Poppy is a terrifying woman,” Sirius said, more to himself than Draco. “I’m going to join the Weasley clan downstairs, are you going to stay here?” Sirius asked as he stood.
Hermione nodded along. “He might not have lived with you, but you weren’t absent from his life,” she said. “You were there for him, you were his Father, even if the living arrangement didn’t show that, you were.”
“And if you’re playing with his feelings Potter, I will skin you alive and hang you by your throat off the Astronomy Tower,” Parkinson smirked, her eyes venomous.
“Your parents wouldn’t want you to grief their death every year, but remembering it is different to grieving it,” Draco said, lacing his hand with Harry’s.
Draco wanted to ask why he didn’t wish to live with his Aunt and Uncle, but thought that would be a little invasive. There was usually something left unsaid in a conversation, and Draco had learnt that asking a question about it, usually didn’t answer the question.
“I’m glad to see you two are having fun,” Draco said behind Harry, almost scaring him out of his chair. “Your tea Harry,” he smiled softly, making Harry’s legs feel numb.
“Here,” a voice said, and Draco turned his head to see a red and gold scarf being offered his way. “You seem cold.”
Harry chuckled. “Sorry,” he said, lifting their linked hands. “I forget I do it sometimes,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’ll let go if-”
“You wish,” he replied, stepping into the hole, and disappearing. Harry quickly followed suit and was thankful Draco had moved out of the way as he landed in a heap at the bottom of the hole.
No one had taken the news well, especially the Hufflepuffs, especially Cho and especially Draco. Everyone knew that Cedric had taken the role of a protective older brother to Draco, not too soon after his arrival into Hufflepuff. Draco had found it odd at first that Cedric would always ask how he was finding his lessons, how he was finding Hufflepuff, but it wasn’t until he received his first letter from his father after his sorting that he realised that Cedric would be his family outside of blood.
Draco nodded, and saw that Hermione looked just as uncomfortable as Harry did. He didn’t need to be a genius to figure out there was something the trio needed to discuss; the tension in the air was almost as thick as concrete. “I’ll just be –“ he gestured to the entrance of the library, grabbing his book off the table.
“There you go then,” Sirius announced, grinning at Harry. “We would have been going to Hogsmeade at some point anyway Cub.”
Whilst he wished there was nothing pressing at his mind, there was a question he needed to ask, and he wasn’t sure when he would get the chance again. “Auntie?” he asked. “How did you feel when you were disowned?” he asked, staring at his hands. His numbness to the entire situation had been concerning him, despite Harry
Just then Madam Malkin told Draco that his robes were done. “It was nice to meet you Harry, I need to meet Mother – she promised to take me to Quality Quidditch supplies after this,” Draco rambled on, not noticing Harry’s perplexed look. “I’ll see you at Hogwarts,” he waved, heading towards to door.
“I don’t want them to be burdened by me,” he mumbled, burying the side of his face in his knees. “They have to deal with so much and, I’m sure I can spend a few more years with the Dursley’s.”
“My father’s in Azkaban, Voldemort is probably after the Malfoy family’s blood, I’m dating his number one enemy,” Draco frowned, and Harry was worried he regretted his choices. “But I wouldn’t change it. Fuck Voldemort,” he said, laughing. “Fuck Voldemort,” he laughed, speaking louder this time.
the time,” he said, looking back at Harry who had raised an eyebrow at him as he skidded on the trolly. Teddy smiled bashfully. “I
As Harry realised what he did, he felt his heart flutter from his chest to his throat; a blush creeped upon his face, and he saw Draco had the same reaction. Before Harry could come up with a good excuse, or any excuse at all, Scorpius entered the room with a plate of un-iced cupcakes, and Harry had never been more relieved to see a child. “We forgot to make
Taken off guard, Draco scrambled to his feet, just reaching Harry as he began to laugh. It was the sort of laughter that made your blood run cold, your bones rattle inside you.
Unsure of what to say, Draco moved over in the bed and patted next to him. Harry hesitated, but, after Draco gestured for Harry to come over, he closed the door.
Therefore, to not let his efforts go to waste, he had tried everything he could think of to get his wand to work: he meditated, took healing potions, washed and polished his wand, he had even succumbed to drinking less caffeinated tea for a week (this only made it worse). It was official, his wand no longer worked for him, but he refused to admit it for one particular reason.
“I think we still have some,” Draco muttered, searching his shelves. “You’re in luck Potter,” he smiled, pulling a jar off the shelf. “You’re also lucky you’re here before we get busy, or I might have run out.”
And then, the dragon stretched his wings and took to the air, flying in circles around the room. Sitting in silence, Scorpius watched the dragon glide across the room, his head moving to follow the direction of the dragon.
“You’ve raised a Hufflepuff,” Harry pointed out, suppressing a chuckle at the moment of horror on Malfoy’s face.
Unsurprisingly, they lived right above the teashop, and the apartment was a lot bigger than Harry had assumed it would be. There were vases filled with wildflowers on every surface and the windows let in the golden light of autumn, illuminating everything it could. The walls were a cream colour, and the floors were made of a rich brown wood. There were photos scattered across the walls and on certain surfaces, containing pictures of the two of them smiling widely. Some contained people he distantly recognised to be Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini, and a few also contained Mrs Malfoy.
Draco could have sworn he saw Potter’s smile widen at that before he shook his head. “Who in Merlin’s name told you you’ll only ever own one wand?” he asked, his eyebrows furrowed as Draco looked back out the window to avoid eye contact.
Sirius sighed again. “I’ll talk to you later Cub, after I’ve talked to the Order about this, but stay at Hogwarts,” he instructed. “
With those words, Draco Malfoy left Harry, gobsmacked, at a loss for words, and alone in a classroom. The effects of the potion were fading, and Harry felt his stomach drop. He had no idea whether the kiss added to his problems, or distracted him from the chaos he knew he would return to in the common room. The sudden reinstatement of a voice of reason was the only reason why he didn’t chase after Malfoy. However, Harry wanted to run after him and kiss Malfoy senseless, or maybe he wanted to yell at Malfoy for kissing him and leaving without an explanation, he was unsure which was more appealing.
“It’s still – still, une très, très longue distance,” Scorpius nodded, grabbing Draco’s hand as they opened the door and the bell dinged.
Still in a bit of a daze, Draco nodded. “Yes,” he managed to say. “Yes we – books,” he said, and Harry chuckled.
Hermione had convinced him to talk to Sirius about the warning. She tried to convince him to talk about the Dursley’s too, especially as he wasn’t talking to either of them about the matter, but Harry refused and for the first time, neither Ron, nor Hermione pestered him until he complied.
Draco nodded. “You’re right, I do,” he said, with a smile. “Pansy rarely recommends me a book, but she hasn’t had a single bad recommended yet,” Draco said, his eyes flickering across the shelves as he glanced for the book. “It’s most likely in the classic books section, but…” he said, trailing off as his eyes once more glanced over the shelves.
The first time he noticed something was wrong was when he moved into his new apartment. Scorpius was dancing around the apartment, making sure not to get under his dad’s feet as he levitated boxes into their designated rooms whilst Pansy said she was helping – in reality she was lying on the sofa, avoiding going to work. Draco smiled as he saw the grin on Scoripus’ face, who was now sitting on a stool by the kitchen counter.
When Malfoy appeared on his right, he almost fell off the sofa, and Malfoy smirked, raising an eyebrow, but he didn’t comment. “If you’re staying here because of some odd Harry Potter courtesy, you
After a moment, he shook his head slightly, pulling his thoughts together. “Yeah,” he said, his voice slightly strained. “Sorry, déjà vu,” he lied, smiling at the two Malfoys, who both shared similar looks of concern.
“Does this mean I’m moving in with you?” Teddy asked, practically buzzing. “And I get to stay with you in the summer?”
“Bloody lucky indeed,” Draco muttered under his breath, getting elbowed in the stomach by Harry. “Oi you prat! You said it first,” he said, rubbing his stomach.
Once, Harry got catapulted into the ceiling after setting off one of these pranks and Draco told him that he had, had similar experiences.
Remus raised an eyebrow at the mention of the Malfoy’s name, and turned to Sirius who shrugged, indicating he would explain later.
“I want him to have the childhood I wish I did, and not to have the same beliefs I used to.” Draco shuddered at the thought of who he used to be and what he used to believe. “I’d do anything to give him that.”
With a nod, Draco tried to find his voice. “No problem,” he said, cursing himself when he felt his face flush light pink. “Ergh, I can’t be sentimental anymore,” Draco groaned, shaking his head.
Draco was certain if he had been drinking, he would have done a spit-take, but instead he let out a bark of laughter, before covering his mouth as Pansy glared at him.
“Apparently, this safe house is the same safe house that Harry’s been staying in, which means you’ll be able to greet him after his trial,” Andromeda said, finishing her tea.
is a burden at times, but that never changes the fact that there are people who care for you,” he said, echoing the words of Cedric.
The cry made Draco flinch, and his muscles tense, but then he saw a small smile on Harry’s face which, for some reason, made Draco want to cry.
friend because you would listen to him speak about dragons,” she smirked. “He seemed to believe you and his Father were ‘very
Draco smiled meekly, still a little shaky. “You know, I could ask you the same,” he replied, glancing at Harry who grinned.
And so, when he saw a familiar head of sky-blue hair in the park walking towards him, he was certain he was imagining it; when he saw a familiar, platinum haired child holding his hand, he was still absolutely certain that it was purely coincidental.
His mind was spinning, and he felt a little sick, but he wasn’t sure if that was from the nerves or the conversation with Lucius.
having people over for tea unless you know how to make it and how to drink it correctly,” Draco explained, placing yet another book back on the shelf. “I mean as a function of course, not purely a social event,” he said, and Harry nodded, despite being baffled by almost everything Draco had just said.
There was an awkward silence that fell between the two as they skirted around directly talking about the kiss. The light faded from the sky and the stars began to appear, covering the grounds in a silver light.
“Ron, it’s fine, really,” Harry assured, placing a hand on Ron’s shoulder. “If you’re not happy here, I’m not going to force you to stay. I mean, yeah, it’s fun to have you as my partner but if you don’t want to be here, you shouldn’t have to stay. Plus, I’m sure Hermione would rather tame a dragon than have to leave her job,” he grinned, shrugging as Ron looked relieved at Harry’s relaxed attitude.
Draco lightly thwacked him round the back of the head. “Never mention the ferret,” he shivered, and Harry bit back a giggle.
Malfoy sighed and offered a tired smile. “You didn’t expect to see me as much as I didn’t expect to see you Potter, I can imagine this is a bit of a shock,” he said, and Harry thought he was mocking him, but then he saw that Malfoy wasn’t sneering. Malfoy looked rather worried.
Teddy had never asked many questions about Remus, and Harry had never wanted to push. He was glad that Hogwarts had sparked a curiosity in him. Whilst he was hardly the person to ask about Tonks (he thankfully had Andromeda for that) there were parts of the Marauders lives that he could relay to Teddy. It couldn’t be as much as he liked, and he finally understood how Sirius had felt when he asked questions about his Dad; there were parts of them you couldn’t explain because you didn’t know yourself.
Harry chuckled and left Malfoy to his own devices, walking to his seat and taking in the faint scent of cardamom and apples, which Harry had learnt was Malfoy’s favourite tea, as he was constantly sipping on a cup – that and the teashop always smelt faintly of apples or cardamom.
“I’ve never actually seen a photo of him before,” Draco mentioned, and realisation spread across Harry’s face.
–“ Malfoy took a deep breath to keep his composure. “It means exactly what you think it means,” he scowled.
They spent the next hour combing through that bookshelf, in the hopes of finding the book of tea, stealing glances at each other. Draco’s pile of books had grown from two, to five in the space of ten minutes and Harry was beginning to wonder if all book lovers were as mad as each other. With a groan, Harry flopped onto the floor, stretching his back. He had been crouched to look at the lower shelves for too long. “There are too many books,” Harry complained, and Draco looked at him, very clearly amused.
“Only with you, Draco,” Harry said in earnest, smiling when he saw Draco was now a similar shade of red.
“Not really a void,” Draco tried to explain, but it was more of a feeling than actual magical theory. “It’s as if it wants you to stay, but has no charm, so it pulls you in, like how Muggle magnets attract other magnets,” he said, hoping that would explain it. “It feels like a rope being tied around my magical core.”
“Will you stop asking if I’m all right!” he snapped, and Hermione flinched at the volume of his voice.
“How have I never drunk peppermint tea before, it’s amazing!” Harry enthused, and Malfoy had to bite back another laugh.
spell, Harry looked around to make sure they were going unnoticed. “Don’t tell your Grandma about this,” he winked, causing Teddy to grin.
“What a lovely place for a family reunion,” Draco said sarcastically, raising an eyebrow as something in the shack moved, releasing a puff of dust into the air.
“Dad!” Teddy called out, as an owl swooped into the kitchen, his eyes following it as it perched on one of the chairs around the table.
The journey back up the train was much less chaotic than the journey down – Draco was glad he didn’t have to dodge any rogue fireworks this time. As he looked out the windows of the train, he noticed that they were deep into the countryside and he guessed that they were far from London.
Once they apparated back to the Malfoy apartment, Scorpius looked sad, as if he’d made a friend he would never see again. “Daddy, will we see Harry again? I liked him,” he asked, stifling a yawn as they cuddled on the sofa.
“The feelings mutual,” Harry chuckled, managing to speak for the first time since he had been pulled into the classroom.
Harry was still staring at the fire when Malfoy arrived with the tea and cake; in fact, he didn’t even notice Malfoy arrive until he heard a soft clearing of the throat. “So, what is the
knows what Remus would do to me if I let you go to the Ministry by yourself,” he added, talking to himself.
“Sirius and I have been looking into the process of adoption and seeing if there’s a loophole surrounding my –
Draco frowned, “I’m not, I feel normal,” he sighed. “Perhaps it’s the move, maybe I just need to sleep it off.”
Deciding to write the letter to Andromeda before he forgot, he asked if she would like to meet for a cup of tea. He sent Teddy’s letter with Genevieve and his own owl, Cyrus, with Andromeda’s.
“She sounds wonderful,” Harry said, trying to ignore the feelings of jealousy for this mysterious woman.
“Are you sure? You look slightly – ashen,” Draco asked again, placing his hand on Harry’s arm. The contact should have made Harry flinch, but he found himself relaxing into the touch.
Potter looked up from the wand, placing it on the side before raising an eyebrow at Draco, “you haven’t seen me in almost eight years, what did you expect?”
As they stopped in front of the bookshop, Harry couldn’t help but chuckle at Draco’s dull tone. “Oh,
so he didn’t blind Draco, and stood on the tip of his toes to kiss the blond on the cheek. “You’re adorable,” he grinned, watching Draco go from pink to red.
“You would be,” Draco murmured, avoiding Harry’s gaze as well as Harry was avoiding his – which is to say, rather badly.
“I still believe my spell idea wasn’t that bad,” Draco insisted, watching as Blaise was slowly sinking to the floor. He bit back a laugh.
Sirius and Harry, however, were neck and neck, and Draco couldn’t help but find their competitiveness amusing. It was like watching a stubborn father and son, battle for the right to say they won – Draco assumed it was the Gryffindor spirit Harry refused to admit he had earlier.
Harry bolted upright. “Will you go?” he asked. It was after all the safest option. He didn’t like the idea of Draco leaving the country to spend Merlin knows how long away from him, but it would be safe – and far away from Lucius and Voldemort.
Normally, this would have pleased Harry – in fact, a week ago, he would have given anything for Malfoy to leave him alone, but when he wanted to talk to the git, it was infuriating.
“Scorpius and I spend the day together, my mother doesn’t celebrate, and then we light a candle for those we’ve lost,” he explained, clutching his teacup, taking a deep breath. “It isn’t that exciting compared to how some celebrate it, but Scorpius rather likes our tradition,” he said, smiling to himself. Clearing his throat, Draco shifted in his seat. “Would you,” Draco took another deep breath, tapping the brim of his teacup. “The shop won’t be open tomorrow, and I know you visit on Thursday’s because you don’t want to think about returning to that job you hate.”
Once they were outside, Harry felt Draco slip his hand back into Harry’s. “So, we’re in a relationship, are we?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow with a smile plastered on his face.
Lupin, in an act of trying to change the conversation, turned to Draco. “Are you all ready to go?” he asked.
Scorpius looked between the dog and Malfoy. “It was nice to meet you Alexander, maybe we’ll see each other again,” he grinned, scratching behind the dog’s ears.
Draco nodded. “Upset they didn’t ask for your autograph Potter?” he teased, making Harry roll his eyes.
Draco shrugged, giving a small nod. “I have no idea how to play, so you won’t do worse than me,” he joked, and Harry shot him a fond, exasperated look.
“Anyway, how are you dear?” she asked, a warmth in her voice. It had never been intended, but after the war, Andromeda had become a motherly figure to Harry, like Molly had. Neither of them noticed it until Teddy asked why Harry didn’t call Andromeda ‘Mum’.
Andromeda shook her head, and Narcissa looked torn between letting her continue and dragging Draco back to his room. “Muggles may not have magic, but that doesn’t mean that we are superior,” she explained. “They might say the same about the fact that we don’t have electricity or televisions.”
Harry wasn’t a too dissimilar shade of pink either. “Oh, er, thank you Draco,” he said, unable to contain his smile. He had thought about what it was that Harry would want to remember – his family.
As September arrived, Lucius had taken it upon himself to instil his expectations upon Draco, constantly reminding him of the family traditions. “As the Malfoy Heir, you hold the continuation and reputation of our name upon your shoulders,” his father explained to him. As he was unable to go with Draco to the platform, Lucius was his goodbyes on his way to the Ministry that morning. “As well as that of the Noble House of Black, now that your mother’s family either went mad or got themselves killed,” he sneered, slamming his cane into the ground, causing Draco to flinch.
Taking a breath, Draco looked at Harry, to find him now staring at the lake. “Harry,” he said again, his words catching in his throat, then tasting sour on his tongue. “Can I –“ he began. “I need to know,” he breathed out, his breath hitching as his vision went hazy.
“’Course they do,” Ron exclaimed, and Harry looked ashamed, as if he had asked something he shouldn’t. “Fred and George are on the Gryffindor team, and my other brother, Charlie, he was their seeker, but he left last year.”
“That’s a yes then,” Harry said, laughing as Rose whooped and grabbed her brothers’ hand, dragging him up the stairs so they could pick a game. “Careful Rosie, you’ll run into something,” Harry called after them.
As they arrived at the castle, Draco noticed Harry across the docks and waved at him with a smile. Harry waved back and Ron noticed Draco too, sending him a friendly nod.
“Yeah,” Harry admitted, his breath hitching as he brought his hands to his head. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
“Is he friends with Remus Lupin?” he asked, Andromeda looked at Ted who shook his head, shrugging his shoulders. She nodded. “And he’s Harry’s Godfather, he somehow managed to escape Azkaban,“ he muttered to himself, and prepared to ask a question that might seem strange. “Is he, by any chance, an Animagus, specifically a big, black dog?”
Narcissa looked between Andromeda and Draco, eventually giving in with a sigh. Draco practically jumped with glee. “Auntie, Auntie!” he exclaimed, rushing to her side. “Is it true you live with Muggles?” he asked.
Draco was avoiding Harry. There wasn’t much he could do to explain why, but he didn’t want to talk about the Howler’s, and he didn’t want to burden anyone.
That was all the incentive Scorpius needed apparently, as he darted out of the kitchen, excitedly chatting about his toy dragon collection. Harry had a feeling he was going to have the honour of meeting those dragons at some point today.
Malfoy shrugged, a smirk pulling at his lips. “Forgive a man for hoping that meant he wouldn’t see you until next week,” he said, waving a hand dismissively as he stood straight once more.
“Still too posh to swear,” Harry chuckled, yawning again. “And I’m just tired really,” he shrugged, smiling as Draco glanced sideways at Harry. “
“This one might be better,” Harry said, passing him another wand. “Willow, 10 inches, Phoenix feather.”
Shrugging, Harry sat on the sofa. “Same as normal,” he said. Hermione frowned, pursing her lips. She looked as if she wanted to say something but was weighing up the pros and cons of speaking her mind. “Don’t look at me like that ‘Mione, just say what’s on your mind.”
“Harry, Harry!” Scorpius exclaimed, distracting Harry from Malfoy’s conversation. “Did you know that dragons don’t like ducks?” Scorpius explained as he began to head towards the pond.
Draco smiled. “You know, I don’t actually know. Why don’t you ask Mr Potter when he appears?” he whispered back, booping Scorpius’ nose who giggled and nodded.
“Don’t forget about the threats Potter,” Blaise called out, just as Harry reached for the door handle, and Harry bit back his laughter.
Malfoy was still tense, but his eyes looked less as if he was ready to attack Harry, and more as if he was trying to understand the situation. He sighed. “Look Potter, there’s a lot of bad blood between us and I –“
Reluctantly, Harry nodded with an exaggerated sigh. “I can see why you’d want to buy it,” he admitted.
She introduced herself as Professor McGonagall and told them the feast would begin after the sorting ceremony and that they were to wait here until her return.
He laughed. “Shockingly, you’ve said before,” Harry mused, accepting the tea from Draco. The smell of apples and cinnamon began to fill the air as the cakes baked. “What is it with you and cinnamon?”
“In other words, you’re a Hufflepuff at heart?” Harry asked, sipping his tea and staring at Malfoy over the edge of the cup.
He heard Draco scoff and turned his head to see a small smile on Draco’s face. “Show off,” Draco muttered, nudging Harry’s foot with his own.
“Well then, being reckless must just be second nature to you Potter,” Snape commented with a smirk, a few sniggers were heard throughout the room. “Perhaps this is what happens if you grow up a celebrity, being waited on hand and foot.”
“She talked about this ex of hers, Graham, for two hours once, and how she should have married him instead of Reginald,” Draco replied, gesturing wildly at Harry as if that would get his point across better.
the one to blame, Harry,” Draco replied, his voice stronger than he felt. “I miss Cedric, and he’s –“ Draco took a deep breath. “He’s really dead, but it
Draco hummed, his hand still running through Harry’s hair. “At least you won’t be with those arseholes who
“Is he any good at it?” Ron asked, forcing Harry to budge up the sofa so Hermione could sit next to him.
“Both?” Harry shrugged. “I think he’s trying to find a way to make Sirius a freeman, but…” he trailed off, an expression Draco couldn't quite place, edging its way onto his face. He shook his head. “He told me once, Remus, that he would find a way for Sirius to keep his promise, so I could live with him.”
I would like to clarify that in this chapter, when Harry and Draco talk about being 'unofficially' together, it is only because they are now together. Please don't think that's how relationships work (I know most people probably won't, but it puts my mind at ease to write this in the chapter notes 😅)
“He is,” he said quietly, before shaking his head. “How did you find the tea?” Malfoy asked, nodding at the teacup.
Parkinson smiled at him for the first time since Harry at been dragged into the classroom, and surprised Harry by wrapping him in a gentle hug. “You’re all right Potter,” she said, smiling as she took a step back. “Not who I would have chosen, but I suppose I can see why he’s so smitten,” she smirked, as Harry smiled, blushing profusely.
“Did you insult me? I feel like I've been insulted,” Harry said, almost making Draco’s heart jump from his chest as he linked his finger’s with Draco’s.
“Hm, I wouldn’t say he hates you, per say,” Draco said, shrugging, still running his fingers through Harry’s hair. “He,” Draco paused.
Yet, every time he entered, all he received was an eerie silence; his hope shot down swiftly, leaving a feeling resembling that of a punch to the stomach.
Harry shrugged and smiled sheepishly. “I don’t mind that you work here Malfoy, the war was twelve years ago, I doubt you’re the same person,” Harry said, his eyes unable to focus on Malfoy, and instead looking at the empty fireplace. “You aren’t, are you?” Harry needed to ask.
“I hope he didn’t bother you ma’am,” Malfoy smiled, charming the old lady on the bench, who blushed.
Draco frowned, lifting a hand to run through Harry’s hair. “It really is atrociously unkept,” he said, leaning into Harry, who blushed. “Have you even heard of a comb?”
“I’d better be,” Harry grinned. “I think it might be the only reason your Dad keeps me around,” he whispered to Scorpius, who fell into another fit of giggles.
“Emotional abuse is just as bad as physical abuse Harry,” Sirius interrupted, his expression the same as when he first found out about the Dursley’s abusive behaviour. “Just because they never hit you doesn’t mean they’ve never harmed you.” Sirius had a firm grip on Harry’s shoulders, and Harry didn’t know how to respond.
“I know you don’t like Malfoy very much, from what you’ve told me about him, I don’t either, but if he really wants a way out, if he wants to change…”
The dread that Harry had been feeling all day was at its peak. They were going to be brewing a Befuddlement Draught, a potion which makes the drinker reckless and hostile and, knowing Snape, Harry would at some point, be forced to try one of the potions. He was not looking forward to seeing just how reckless this potion made you – what if he mentioned Sirius? Or the DA? He hoped it wasn’t going to be as bad as he was imagining.
Draco from talking to her, but he couldn’t help himself. Draco had snuck out of his room, creeping through the corridors – much to the amusement of the house elves dusting the vases – and into the parlour when he was sure his father wasn’t around. “Draco darling, is that you?” Narcissa called out as he peeked past the door.
Frowning, Draco pushing himself from the wall and turned to Harry. “Yes – I thought it was obvious?”
Harry looked as if he was on the verge of exploding. “I mean, the Wizarding money system is no better, I can never remember what it is,” he said, and Draco looked aghast.
His sentence was interrupted by Harry, who crashed their lips together. It was short and desperate, with Harry having thought of nothing else all week, but it was soft, and Harry felt his magic rush through his body.
Harry nodded. “I mean, there wasn’t much they could say against me really, but there was this one woman,” he paused, and Draco could practically see the thoughts fly through his mind before he shook his head. “I was found not guilty, and now I’m exhausted,” Harry yawned.
“I think, about sixty-eight years?” he said, unsure. “The benefits of a magical lifespan I suppose,” Draco shrugged, sipping his tea again.
“Really?” Harry asked, still amazed at how much Scorpius knew about dragons. “Hang on Scorpius, we should wait for your Dad,” Harry said, as Scorpius hadn’t yet stopped.
Pouring himself a cup, Harry tried to drink it unsweetened, as Malfoy unsubtly told him he should, but after one sip, he knew he needed to add the honey. Unsweetened, it tasted earthy, and bitter, but after a little bit of honey, it tasted wonderful. It was still earthy and slightly nutty, but it wasn’t bitter.
“I’m insulted,” Harry deadpanned, trying to think of a distraction where he would be able to grab the book. A smile tugged on the corners of his mouth.
Teddy started to cry harder at Harry’s words, and it was at that very moment that Harry realised he hadn’t ever
Nothing, however, distracted from Umbridge’s tyranny. As much as they tried to ignore her existence, as soon as Fred and George left, the atmosphere became chaotic and depressing, with everyone trying their hardest to get rid of Umbridge but no one having the same planning expertise. These careless pranks were one of the reasons it was difficult to sneak to the Astronomy Tower.
Harry wagged a finger in his direction. “More than others, don’t forget that part,” he said, his grin infectious.
“Nothing, nothing,” Draco replied dismissively, letting go of Harry’s hand to dig in his pocket for his wand. “I’m just an idiot,” he sighed, casting a levitating charm over the books, so that they now were floating alongside them.
“It’s dark out,” Harry said when Draco returned from the till. He was now the only person left in the shop besides Draco.
He sat, flipping the shard in the centre of his hand, trying to mentally prepare himself as best he could for the oncoming conversation.
“You had just told everyone you sleep in a cupboard, forgive me if I had doubts.” Malfoy drawled, and leaned against one of the few remaining desks opposite where Harry stood. Now that Malfoy had mentioned running after Harry, he could see a few stray strands of hair and Harry noticed his robes were noticeably dishevelled compared to the last time he had seen Malfoy.
“You catch the snitch to end the game,” Ron said. “Usually, the team who catches the snitch wins the game, but it depends on how many goals were won by the chasers,” he explained, shuffling in his seat as the train went through a tunnel.
“There is nothing wrong with being a burden,” Cedric continued. “Everyone is a burden sometimes, we’re human, but shutting people out won’t help anyone, least of all yourself.”
“We probably won’t get a choice in this Draco,” Ted said. “Your Aunt will probably explain this to you as well, but anything Dumbledore asks you to do, don’t do it, not unless you know it is absolutely the right thing to do.”
“’Mione’s been trying to get people to change the law Umbridge put into force after Lupin, but people seem to actually agree with it,” Ron said, and Harry groaned.
When darkness began to spill into the apartment, the laughter turned melancholy as the time for remembrance drew closer, but as Draco left to gather the candles Scorpius grabbed Harry’s hand. “It’s okay if you get sad,” he assured, and Harry felt a strong urge to hug the small blond. “I get sad sometimes, but I’m glad we do it because I don’t want to forget my Mum.”
, no” Harry interrupted, smiling into his hand. “Sorry, it’s just, I don’t think you know how effortlessly attractive you are,” he admitted, biting back a smile as Draco looked bemused. He watched as the realisation dawned upon his face and his cheeks went rosy.
Harry groaned. Whilst he loved Molly dearly, she did fret about his being single as if it was the only thing that mattered. “What if I don’t want to date anyone?”
Remus turned his head, and noticed Harry, who apprehensively waved, forcing a smile. Remus waved back, a black dog sat by his heels, looking disgruntled. Harry bit back a chuckle at the sight, knowing that Remus had told Sirius not to react in a way that would draw attention to them.
It wasn’t long before Andromeda joined them in the living room, throwing herself at the armchair in the corner (but with the grace of a Black). “
Surprisingly, Malfoy hadn’t joined in on Snape’s commentary, which only put Harry on edge. He had glanced over at Malfoy a few times out of curiosity (expecting that the lack of snide comments was due to silent death stares) but he saw that Malfoy looked almost bored with the lesson, and was just staring at his own potion as it boiled, as if expecting something miraculous to appear.
The grounds of Malfoy Manor were starting to decay as they did every year towards to end of August. The grass may have been green at the front of the Manor (the
Deciding to head outside, Draco wished he had brought his cloak with him that morning, as the frost was biting at his fingers the moment he stepped outdoors.
“You have such little faith in me,” Harry said, shaking his head, levitating a branch to the knot between the roots of the tree.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Really? That’s not what I remember,” he grinned. “You truly do have a terrible memory Potter,” he said, quickly managing to dodge Harry as he tried to whack Draco on the arm.
Snape headed over to Ron’s potion and sneered. “Ten points from Gryffindor Mr Weasley, it’s clear you never even read the instructions on the board,” Snape said, barely even glancing in Ron’s cauldron before emptying it – it was now Harry’s turn to stomp on Ron’s foot.
The inside of the shop was just as welcoming as the outside. Each table had a glass vase filled with varying bunches of flowers. Some had roses, others had lilies, and some had what Harry assumed to be wildflowers. Harry smiled when he saw that the table in front of him had lilies.
“Do you really think he sees me as his Dad?” Harry asked. Whilst Andromeda had always told him that he was like Teddy’s father, he had never believed it because Teddy had never called him anything other than Uncle Harry.
aren’t we depressing,” he joked. “I’ve been awake five minutes and I’m crying,” he chuckled, wiping his eyes with his sleeves.
you Pans, it might be a bit – “ He flinched as the box crashed onto the floor, thankful that there wasn’t anything too important or fragile in the box. “That’s never happened before,” he muttered to himself as Pansy sat up to look at him. Scorpius seemed rather unfazed.
The spirit of autumn was hard to miss as he walked into Draco’s teashop. The window displayed an array of pumpkins and tree branches, charmed to stay orange and red, and not to turn brown. The shop still smelt of apples and cardamom, but also there was a faint smell he couldn’t recognise.
It seemed like a wonderful place to escape. The rest of the house was dreary, grey and dark, but this library felt lighter, easy to breathe in – Draco knew this was partially due to the window, but he also could feel a comfort from the magic of the library itself.
The shop was creatively called, Wands (Draco wondered how long it had taken Potter to come up with that name) but besides a different sign, it looked the same. The windows were tinted so you couldn’t see inside the shop, and it was painted a dark shade of purple.
Potter glanced sheepishly at Draco before saying, “I might be able to explain it, but just don’t hex me if it gets personal alright?” he warned.
Harry nodded, understanding the connection Draco had to Samhain completely. He took a sip of the tea, which tasted of something Harry couldn’t place, warming his soul.
The trio sprawled across the grass, laughing at each other’s jokes, eating too much food and wondering just
Andromeda pursed her lips. “I’ll hold you to that Harry,” she sighed, as Teddy wandered up to the two of them to show-off the pebbles he had collected and how he could change his hair to match the colour of the pebbles (which Harry found rather impressive).
“You do,” Sirius replied. “But it’s still unfair,” he said, his eyes filled with the same look his aunt had given him. “And it’s confusing, messy, a downright
Harry bit his tongue, holding back a comment on Draco’s family that was not flattering and took a deep breath. This was the same disagreement they had yesterday, and Harry did not want to restart it, in case it caused a fight. Instead, they walked in tense silence, Draco still clutching Harry’s hand, soothing him as best he could, despite Harry’s brooding.
“I think everything with Warrington made him realise how much he’d been inadvertently encouraging it,” Harry shrugged, choosing to ignore Ron’s comment.
Ron watched Harry for a moment before frowning. “You could leave too you know,” Ron said nonchalantly, busying himself with shrinking the last few objects on his desk.
He noticed the passing of a paw shaped cloud, but chose not to point it out, as Pansy was yet to recover from the dragon on a broomstick. “That there looks like a rabbit,” Pansy said, pointing towards the pawprint.
He enjoyed the way Malfoy brushed his hair from his face as he laughed and the way his eyes softened at the sight of Scorpius and his fascination with anything Muggle; the passion he held when talking about his teashop and the casual mentions of dyeing his hair a pale green next because orange would clash with his skin tone.
The warmth inside of Harry at these interactions almost made him forget why Sirius and Remus were here.
Draco pondered for a moment, glancing at the clock on the wall. “Anytime now actually,” he shrugged. “I’d better go get prepared,” he said, leaning forward to kiss Scorpius on the top of his head. “Is there anything you’d like mon cœur?” he asked.
Draco lifted Scorpius off his lap and sat him back down on the window seat. “So, which one will I be trying first?” he asked with a small smirk as Harry fumbled to open the box.
. “But everyone has their own traits, outside of the binary of this sorting system, which makes it, actually kind of nice,’ Cedric admitted, smiling at Draco.
he’ll be in Hufflepuff Blaise,” she chuckled, as Draco let out a nervous laugh. He felt his stomach drop as he became more uncertain about where he would be sorted. Whilst he didn’t dislike the other houses, he knew that he needed to be in Slytherin to please his family and his friends. “Besides, it doesn’t change that he’s our friend, even if he is a little soft,” she joked, making Draco elbow her in the stomach.
“I’m not sure how to bring it up in conversation,” Harry sighed. “Not because I’m ashamed to be friends with Draco!” he added hastily, seeing Andromeda’s eyes darken. “But because I’m unsure how everyone else feels about him. I don’t want him to get hurt because someone decides to go and punch him,” he said, curling up as best he could around his cup.
Harry nodded with such vigour, Draco was surprised his head didn’t roll off. “Exactly!” he exclaimed, sitting straight. “Like, he expects me to be completely okay with the fact he tried to isolate me for the
“And that,” Harry smiled, as Teddy yawned, rubbing his eyes. “Tired?” he asked, knowing he must be. The train journey from Hogwarts was always exhausting. Ron said it was due to being confined to a tiny carriage. He took the pan off the stove and added the hot chocolate powder, and some cinnamon, then pouring a cup for them both.
Professor Lupin laughed, obviously expecting the confusion. “Feel free to call me Remus, Draco, I’m no longer your Professor.” Draco had already decided he would not do that. “It’s lovely to see you Andie, how long has it been?” he asked, as she grinned.
Draco shrugged. “I didn’t notice,” he mumbled into his mug, turning the page of his book. He could feel Harry next to him, leaning over his shoulder to read the book.
“Basically,” Ron said. “If you see it’s upsetting him, make sure he knows that he is always number one to you,” he clarified. “But only if it’s upsetting him. There’s no need to make him concerned or put ideas about it in his head, you know?”
Harry felt another scream bubbling in his throat at the accusation. Now he wasn’t sure that he would be able to stop himself from punching Malfoy, much less destroying the classroom. “I wouldn’t kill anyone,” he growled, directing his wand at Malfoy.
“Pretty much,” Harry shrugged, still smiling. He rarely noticed how much he would smile around Draco. “How is Scorpius anyway?” he asked, despite only having seen him two day’s prior.
The platform was lit by the golden hue of the setting sun, illuminating the faces of waiting parents and family, and obscuring the clock from view ever so slightly as the sunbeams hit the glass. There was a faint hum of chatter as people spoke about their Christmas plans, as well as about how they wish the train would arrive quicker as they had places to be. The train was due to arrive any minute and Harry was glad for the warmth and beauty of the sun; it was helping him keep his nerves at bay. This would be the first time in over six years that Teddy would be staying with him at Grimmauld Place.
He hummed in recognition. “So, you’re just an idiot?” Draco deadpanned, a smirk twitching at the corner of his mouth.
“First, they move my trial forward an hour, without telling me,” Harry listed, as he tapped his foot, scowling at the ground as if it had swallowed a beloved pet. “Then –
Draco chewed his thumb, before sighing. “Auntie Andie thinks it’s part of his plan, and I’m inclined to agree, although, what that plan is, I have
After crawling out of bed, he tip-toed across the landing and down the stairs, where he sat, trying to listen in. He could see Ted in the lounge, who caught his eye and brought a finger to his lips, before gesturing for Draco to join him.
“I- I’m not sure,” Draco replied. “Intelligence is nice but, being courageous is also good, and of course I’m ambitious, but I don’t think it’s more important than the other traits and values of the houses,” he said. “But my family expects me to be in Slytherin,” he shrugged, shuffling on his feet to the displeasure of Madam Malkin.
“Malfoy?” Ron asked. “Bloody Merlin mate, why did it have to be Malfoy,” he groaned, leaning back into the sofa.
He shrugged. “It’s definitely nowhere near the same as it was ten years ago, but it’s still difficult to walk down Diagon Alley sometimes,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I usually end up hiding in the back of Florean’s ice cream shop, so it’s not all bad,” Harry chuckled.
“And apparently if Norwegian Ridgeback’s scales start to turn a different colour, it means that they need to spend more time in the sun, but that can be really difficult because –“
“Moony! Finally,” Sirius let out an exasperated breath, glancing over the top of the mirror. “What took you so long?” he asked, flashing Remus a grin.
He did leave his mother in that house. He hadn’t even thought about there being a way to get her out. He should have tried to get her out.
“Even if I wanted to Potter I can’t. For multiple different reasons,” he said, causing Potter to raise an eyebrow.
Then he remembered. “I can check,” he whispered, thinking about the mirror shard in the bottom of his trunk. Harry grasped at Draco’s face and smashed their lips together, as an excited ‘
“It all depends on what the wand’s made of,” said Potter. “Dragon Heartstring cores are the ficklest with their owners. Wands with Dragon Heartstring cores choose people based off their values and beliefs but as soon as these change, the wand no longer has a connection to the owner,” Potter explained. “Phoenix Feathers are more flexible. They flow with the ‘rebirth’ of their owners,” Draco rolled his eyes at Potter’s lame pun with a small smile. “But, changing too quickly can cause the wands to fall out of sync with their owners. Now, Unicorn Hair,” Potter made a point to look at Draco, knowing that his wand’s core was Unicorn Hair. “They’re the most loyal. Ollivander never had anyone need to exchange their wand if it had unicorn hair.” Potter looked lost in thought again.
The boy raised an eyebrow at Draco, but before he could respond, Harry did. “You remembered,” he said, sounding disbelieving.
“Are you suggesting Harry should keep seeing Draco simply because he makes good tea?” Hermione asked, raising an eyebrow.
Malfoy blinked at Harry; his eyebrows furrowed. However, it only lasted for a moment before he gently shook his head and passed Harry a teacup. “Peppermint tea,” he replied.
He brought his hand up to his mouth as he choked back a sob, which echoed off the walls of the bathroom.
Sirius gave Draco a brief tour of the house, showing him to his room, the bathroom – Draco didn’t feel the need to know where anything else was; if he needed it, he’d find it.
“Yes, I know, I have the worst luck,” Malfoy waved his hand dismissively, but Harry could have sworn he saw a smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. “It was easier to have you hate me,” Malfoy admitted, sitting on the edge on the tower.
“No one,” Harry said, sighing. “And then, I had that outburst in Potions and now it’s in the bloody papers and,” he paused, trying to control his breathing. “They can’t
Harry feigned innocence. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he lied, shooting a smile at Draco as he leaned against the counter.
“I did think he was trying to kill me at the time, so I don’t think the décor was much of a focal point,” Harry chuckled, as they exited the shack, but not before donning the invisibility cloak. Being this close to Draco made Harry’s head spin and he revelled in the warmth emanating from the blond.
Ron nodded. “Speaking of idiots, did I tell you about this prat who came into the store the other day?” he asked, only just remembering, and Harry shook his head.
“I told him he’d have to obliviate me,” Harry grinned. “Also, it happened after the Befuddlement Draught. He was just as shocked as I was, I think.”
Teddy laughed, and Harry felt himself sigh internally with relief. “I have actually,” Teddy grinned, as Scorpius’ eyes widened, as he bounced about even more. “Would you like to hear about it?” he asked.
Harry froze, unable to respond with anything other than a nod. “Anyway, I’ll see you around,” he said quickly, reaching to open the door.
He had found this clearing, overlooking the lake, with Cedric in his third year. Draco had received a few letters from his father that concerned him, and Cedric had shown him this place, so they could talk about it without fear of interruption.
Harry smiled. “All right then,” he said, kissing Draco on the cheek. “It doesn’t change how I feel. We can figure it out, together.”
The two sat, watching the park and the people passing by, almost in perfect silence. The joy that filled Harry’s body and the comfort brought by simply being next to Draco was almost immeasurable and Harry hoped Draco felt the same about him.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “You remembered,” he said, a smile pushing on to his face. “I may have only mentioned it once.”
Rolling his eyes Harry passed Draco the card. “Queen of Clubs,” Harry said, his eyes widening at his mistake. “Wait, no –“
Draco’s face went pink when he remembered that detail, making Harry raise an eyebrow. “I – er – I’m the one who told him to warn you actually, I didn’t know he’d go quite that far though.”
The sound of his footsteps on the stone floors echoed through the corridor, only just audible past the blood pounding in his ears. The longer he walked, the more his anger dissipated and turned into panic and frustration. He knew the potion was going to make him reckless, but what he just did was practically suicidal.
It took Draco a moment to realise he was no longer alone. “Hello,” the person said, their voice soft and quiet, and yet Draco still tensed. “I’m sorry to intrude, you can tell me to bugger off –
“Unable to act or think normally as a result of love, and the way both of you act when the other’s name is only so much as mentioned –
“A Muggleborn?” Blaise asked, his eyebrow raised. “Your father let you talk to a Muggleborn?” he asked, unconvinced.
Harry rolled his eyes, groaning. “That sounds about right,” he muttered to himself. “You know how Ron and Hermione didn’t write me?” he asked. Draco nodded. “Yeah, well,
Seeming to decide that changing the topic of conversation was the best course of action, Harry asked, “have you thought about your future plans after you become a Healer?”
“I like the colour green, so maybe Slytherin would be cool, but I don’t think I have much ambition,” the boy said, scrunching up his nose.
“My cousin, Sirius Black,” she said, preparing for Draco to panic and exclaim that this was ridiculous.
someone,” he said. Ron opened his mouth to reply. “He’s a friend Ron,” Harry said pointedly, and Ron sighed, leaning into the sofa as Hermione chuckled.
Without explaining himself, Harry looked at the shard and said, “Sirius Black,” watching as his reflection rippled away into what appeared to be the ceiling of one of the rooms at Grimmauld Place. “Sirius?” he called out, and he called out again when he got no response.
Draco shrugged. “I went to see a friend,” he explained, sitting back down next to Blaise – he was scared Pansy would remove one of his limbs. “We met in Diagon Alley getting Hogwarts supplies. I went to make sure he got on the train okay – I’m pretty sure he grew up with Muggles,” Draco said, ignoring their scandalised faces.
Practically running to the tower, Harry made sure to keep glancing at the Map to check Malfoy was still in the tower. Thankfully, when he reached the stairs to the top of the tower, Malfoy’s name was still darting about the tower.
“A real shame that I enjoy your company, despite you having all the grace of a flobberworm,” Draco interrupted with a sigh, making Harry chuckle. “Oh well, I guess if I have to.”
Harry felt the heat rise in his face for multiple reasons. “I wouldn’t have done anything stupid,” he said, frowning at the accusation.
“I know manners,” he muttered, biting into the cinnamon bun. It was certainly harder to scowl after that.
Pansy told him he was being dramatic, but Draco was inclined to agree. So, instead, they were lying on the grass, feeling the warmth of the earth, cloud gazing.
This didn’t appease Ron. “It’s just, clearly something is eating you up inside and,” he took a deep breath, shifting his sitting position. “You’re my best mate, I’m worried.”
Scorpius beamed. “I didn’t spill anything,” he said, tilting his chin up in pride. “Not on the table, anyway,” he admitted, gesturing to his shirt which was not only covered in flour, but somehow cake batter.
Draco rolled his eyes, smiling. “Your inner Slytherin is showing again,” he said, smiling when Harry laughed.
“The twelfth,” she said, smiling at her husband. “I’m sorry I never told you Ted, but we know he’s about as dangerous as a fly, and I’ve only known since we knew he was innocent.”
“Subtle?” Draco asked. “Subtle? Potter everyone in the Wizarding World knows I’m gay,” he said, looking at Harry accusingly.
“I don’t feel any different,” Harry said, trying to figure out if he just hadn’t noticed a difference.
“Harry,” Draco interrupted, his voice soft but Harry knew he was smiling without even looking. “I’d love to,” he said. “I’d also really like to kiss you again, but there happens to be a lot of people around, so…”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked, able to see Harry from the small amount of moonlight which poured in through the window.
“You’d rather take it out on me then?” Malfoy asked, raising his eyebrow even further. “Potter, did you not hear me when I said I don’t – “
Harry watched the two interact with a small smile. “So that’s what that means,” he said, after a moment of realisation.
He poked his head around the door and found that it was the library. There was a giant window opposite the door, and the bookshelves were built into the walls of the room. It was two stories, with a staircase from the door down into the centre of the room, where a few tables stood, as well as sofas.
“He’s the mysterious friend, right?” Hermione asked, smiling as Harry nodded. “I knew if you wouldn’t tell us who it was, there had to be a reason, and I’ve told you two about how Blaise is a work friend, so I knew it had to be someone you thought we really wouldn’t like,” she explained, and Harry felt like an idiot.
“’Mione, it’s fine, really. I don’t want to talk about it all right?” he sighed, the backs of his eyes beginning to ache. “Besides, I have to tell you guys what happened after I left.”
“If there’s one thing working in this department teaches you, it’s that people are idiots,” she said.
Draco let out a sigh of relief too, and everyone in the room seemed to follow suit. “Could you take this mirror shard to him please Kreacher,” he asked, smiling as the house elf nodded and snapped his fingers to apparate.
Harry sighed, nodding. “He told me,” Harry admitted, and this was the first time both of the Slytherin’s lost their composure.
returned,” he explained, feeling his heart getting heavier with each word. “I don’t want to be there, in that house with my Father, but I
Harry rubbed the back of his neck with an apologetic smile. “Fashionably late?” he offered, making Draco laugh, letting them step inside for a moment. He quickly wrapped Harry in a hug.
Draco started to run his fingers through Harry’s hair. “What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked, looking at Harry’s eyes to see him raise an eyebrow.
Draco winced slightly. “What Warrington did was uncalled for,” Draco said, staring at the telescope in front of them.
you also talk a lot about the books that you’re currently reading, so I guessed that you are a book lover and… well, when Hermione is one of your best friends –“
“You’d be an amazing Dad,” Scorpius remarked, grinning at Harry, completely unaware of the implications of what he just said.
The trio almost fell out of their seats as the train started to move. Draco turned his head to the window to watch as the platform disappeared from sight. He grinned, finally letting the excitement flood his veins. He could hear Blaise and Pansy asking him questions, but they sounded distant compared to the buzzing in his ears.
“In the classroom? What did I do?” he asked, part of him hoping he had done to Snape what he did to Aunt Marge.
Draco turned on the tap, listening to the rush of water as he clutched the sink, his knuckles turning white.
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “He would have loved to see the person you’ve become,” he said, smiling warmly. “As would your mother.”
“And you’re worried how your sorting will be received?’ Cedric asked, though it was more of a statement than a question.
Ron raised an eyebrow again, as if Draco might be tricking him. After a minute, he shrugged. “I guess you’re all right.”
“Do you want a wand or not you prat?” Harry said, rolling his eyes with a smile. He opened up another box and passed the wand to Draco. “Elms wood, thirteen and a half inches, dragon heart string.” Draco held it lightly this time, not wanting splinters in his hand. Nothing happened.
“With your pettiness?” Harry chuckled, shaking his head. There was a softness to what he was saying that made Draco’s heart swell like the sound of a string section of an orchestra. “Did Ted show you how to play rummy?” he asked.
Pulling him from his thoughts, Potter stumbled backwards out of the trees. He was as graceful as Draco remembered him to be. Draco was shocked to see that Potter didn’t look that different from when they were seventeen, just older. His emerald eyes lacked the child-like wonder they used have but still held a fiery warmth. His hair a mess of curls, untameable by the strongest of magic, he suspected. His glasses were slightly crooked from his stumbling and his scar was only partially hidden, but his smile seemed to be more effortless than it was in Hogwarts, as if being happier was easier. “Sorry for the wait there,” he said, dusting off his robes. “How can I –
