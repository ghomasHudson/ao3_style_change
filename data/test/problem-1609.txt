“No, I’ll take care of that after lunch. I’ve got to sort the pages in order again, I toss them all on the floor after I’m finished with it. It’s a terrible system.” Draco admits.
“You should stash a pair of men’s dress shoes in here so you don’t have to transfigure yours next time.” Harry suggests. He nods weakly. “Okay, stay here, I’m going to get you a cup of tea.”
He glances around the room at the various teacups strewn about and hastily sends them to the kitchen.
“It’s a good thing you’re so unbelievably cute or I would be a lot more put out by carrying you everywhere.” Harry says gently.
Potter lifts an eyebrow like he read Draco’s mind, but Draco knows that isn’t possible, even if Potter had managed to cast a nonverbal wandless Legilimens.
Malfoy’s hand lands on Harry’s arm before he can step out, and just when Harry turns to see why Malfoy grabbed him, they twist together and Apparate out.
“Hm?” Draco asks, and Harry can hear shuffling as he moves. A second later, he peers over the edge of the bed down at Harry and laughs sleepily.
Draco turns around, stepping closer and lowering his voice. He speaks quickly, hoping none of the people around them are listening.
“Thanks.” Malfoy says when Harry goes back onto the stage again. Zambini has gone off somewhere, leaving them alone.
“You don’t talk very clearly, Marion, he doesn’t know what you mean.” Harry says. Marion blinks owlishly.
All it takes is a tug on his hips for Harry to get the message and lower himself over Draco’s body. The heat of his body sets Draco’s blood on fire, and very quickly, he
“Sure, like Meredith. You don’t have to refer to it as my alter ego, you know. It’s not like she’s just locked away inside my head, Meredith doesn’t exist.”
“There’s blood replenishing potions in this cupboard, one vial is one dose, don’t take multiple unless you’ve been bleeding for over two hours. Use muggle painkillers if you have minor injuries.”
“Mm. If they’re out there getting laid, it’s only fair you should too. I’m ready to go.” Draco says, licking his lips.
featuring Draco as a student at Beauxbatons visited by Harry, Ron and Hermione for the Triwizard tournament in Sixth year! Also there's no Voldie or horcruxes or Dursleys involved so only typical teenage angst involved:)
They don’t speak. They don’t speak as Narcissa shouts for Malfoy to come down to dinner. They don’t speak as Malfoy wandlessly locks his bedroom door against intrusion as her voice draws nearer, and they don’t speak as Narcissa says with a sigh she’ll send food with the elves.
Draco nods again, then slips past them with the faintest ‘okay’ Harry’s heard from him. He disappears into the kitchen.
Draco sits up from where he's been examining each title. He's got tears in his eyes and he swipes at his cheeks hastily.
Draco doesn’t say anything, so Harry keeps brushing his hair off his forehead gently, picking up his book to read until he gets tired.
Draco puts his hand on Harry’s leg, leaning in close. Slowly. His eyes slip shut, but Harry is mesmerised watching him.
Harry wrapped his arms around Malfoy, whose head only reached Harry’s shoulder. His pointy nose and chin dug into Harry’s bruises, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“The accused already has quite a history of crime. It’s hardly his first appearance in court, wizard or otherwise.”
Each time, Harry would make a new stitch and pull on it until Malfoy was biting back whimpers - something apparently only Harry was aware of, knowing what it takes for Malfoy to react like that.
“Then it’s okay how it is, unless you want to move it. I’m alright, you don’t need to worry about me.”
“There he is! And the Malfoy traitor, too!” Alecto Carrow’s shrill voice rang out. The siblings were nearly on them when Malfoy grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him down a different corridor.
“Oh, her whole field has sort of a magical bubble around it. Like Neville’s greenhouse, except you can’t see or touch it. Jeanette is a muggle, Marion is muggleborn, so she had Hermione and me set it up for her.”
He hears the water shut off and puts away the catalogue and phone, picking up a book instead. The bathroom door opens and soft footsteps come down the stairs. Harry looks up and takes a sharp breath.
It takes a few tries for Harry to regain his balance, but finally he manages to sort of squat with his feet on the handle.
“I can go back to my room.” Harry offers, but Draco only hums in response. Harry stays awake for a while, but falls back asleep after midnight.
The previous healer enters a few minutes later, and looks at Draco with a mistrustful expression. Draco ignores it.
Malfoy appears, wearing silky green bottoms which barely cover his arse and a black corset and stockings. He’s also wearing the same high heeled black boots as the first night. It’s very distracting, but Harry manages to find his way to the front of the crowd again.
Harry bites back his laughter while he waits to see what Draco will do, but Draco just looks up with a smile.
“Alright boys, we get it, you’re big and tough.” Knox says blandly, gesturing for Prott to ask the next question.
“You know, we’re really lucky that Hugo’s so quiet, Rose used to scream bloody murder constantly.” Harry says. Draco hisses at the mention of Hugo’s name, which makes Harry laugh.
“This is a beautiful house, Draco. Of course I want to live here.” Harry assures him, lifting both hands to kiss each palm. “It’s the most wonderful thing.”
Malfoy doesn’t change his shoes, and Harry ends up staying for hours, until the sun goes down behind the hills.
dark, you can see loads more.” Harry promises. “Oh I should ask, the dark doesn’t bother you, does it? Because we can go inside if it does.”
“Astute observation, I can see how you’re second in our class.” Harry says very dryly. “Now either pants off or tap out.”
“Fuck, you do open up easy.” Potter says, watching Draco’s face intently as he very quickly works a second finger in.
“Dear me, there they go, I tell you, Harry, we’re in a spot of trouble with those two working together on their muggle enchantments.” Molly giggles, though she sounds like that sort of trouble is hardly the bad kind.
He eats his food as usual but seems a bit cranky through the whole thing, and Harry is concerned at first, but it morphs into amusement the more sour Draco gets.
“You can eat smaller bites.” Harry says, and Draco frowns down at his plate again, nodding. He’s honestly a bit like an alien on the planet for the first time, confused not only by what he’s forgotten about over the years, but also by muggle things.
Draco drinks more than he probably should to steady his nerves after talking about the war again. It’s been a couple years since someone asked him about it, and it definitely wasn’t something he expected tonight.
“Did you want to have sex with them? Did they ask you?” Harry can feel his stomach churning with unease. This is all so much worse than he could’ve imagined.
“I’d like you to drink some of your tea and eat at least one sandwich.” Harry says, and Draco complies without hesitation.
Harry never joined in the torment. He found that it didn’t satisfy him like it used to when someone would pull a fast one on his arch-rival.
“I have something to compare it to, and so I can tell you confidently that we are not a well-suited pair.” Draco says, getting up off Neville and sitting on the desk instead.
The husky brunet, fully nude after his performance, left through a gauzy but opaque curtain, which seemed to operate much like the veil Harry had watched Sirius disappear behind. The performer walked straight through the fabric as if it was only an illusion, and maybe it was.
Here is a good spot to give yourself a rest! Grab yourself some water and get some sleep if you're reading this at night:) take care!
With another scowl, Malfoy waves his wand and everything stacks itself neatly and arranges itself on the floor.
Maybe Potter would have been sorted into Slytherin, having watched Draco be sorted there before him and knowing not all Slytherins are bad.
“I’m literally eight feet away from you.” Malfoy mutters. Harry turns to see him getting up from the sofa to join Harry in the bathroom. “What?”
“Exactly as it states. You’ll be asked to testify against Malfoy in court tomorrow morning. We also require that you visit the Ministry sometime before then to ensure the curse has been lifted, as it’s clearly still in place.”
“Eduard.” Malfoy says rather blankly. “You gave him to me, remember? Hang on, I’ll see if he’ll let me Summon him.”
Malfoy is already packing his things when Harry enters the room, towel-clad once more, but when Harry drops the towel to put on pants, Malfoy starts digging around in his trunk for something.
“These trousers cost more than my Romania house, there’s no way I’m swapping them with you.” He says when Potter gives him a look.
“Mister Black,” Malfoy purrs, sauntering closer. His voice sounds off, like someone else is speaking through his mouth with only the vaguest idea of how Malfoy talks.
“Don’t be, I’ll tear you to shreds in my column.” She sniffs. “Alcohol’s in the next room, snacks everywhere, break whatever you want, Mumsy and Dad are in Tuscany and they left me here to fend for myself.”
"Well, now you can read one, can't you?" He gestures around the hallway, and Harry looks down, to see several of the letters scattered at his feet. Bending down to grab one of the envelopes, Harry breaks the familiar wax seal and starts to read.
What the heck was that? He glances up to see Snape looking down at him disdainfully and shaking his head as if he is disappointed, and it is only then that Harry notices they aren't in the back alley anymore. Turning round, he notices a manor house, bigger than any Harry had seen before. Harry's eyes flick over the house, sparing a glance for the animals resembling peacocks roaming the grounds, analysing the grand architecture and extravagant gate before them, before landing upon his somewhat grubby attire. Harry decides he is underdressed for wherever he is, and apparently this has come to Snape's attention too, as he flicks his wand and mumbles something, and Harry is cleared up, still wearing the clothes he was before, but clean and tidy. With a slight incline of the head, Snape starts to stride down the path toward the gate. Harry hurries after the man, hoping the gate will open, and when it doesn't and the two of them are very close his step falters. Snape's, however, doesn't, and Harry watches with a look of disbelief as the man walks through - through! - the gate.
"Do it!" A boy bellowed. They all began to cheer and chant. Harry grinned and plucked off his glasses. And did a headstand. They all cheered, he grinned harder. At least he made a somewhat good first impression.
The morning came way too fucking early. Harry groaned as the sun shined into his eyes. He severely wished he had chosen the other room. He doubted Malfoy woke up to the sun blinding him. He pulled himself out of bed, put a kettle on the stove, and hopped in the shower. Harry pulled on his favorite jeans, and a burgundy sweater. His tea was too sweet, just the way he liked it. The warmth soothed his nerves. First day! He had been ready for this for weeks and now that it was here it was rather daunting. Funny how the one who defeated the Dark Lord is scared of a bunch of kids. He checked his schedule for the millionth time. First years. First, First, First. Gryffindor and Slytherin. No matter how anxious he was, his growling stomach needed some food. Harry finished his tea and left his room. At the exact moment Malfoy did. Merlin, he wanted to slap him. But he was a mature adult who does not slap people. They nodded at each other and started off towards the great hall. Side by side.
"Damn, Malfoy. And I thought I was oblivious." Malfoy crinkled his brow in obvious confusion. Now it was Harry's turn to smirk.
"Hiya." He grimaced as he opened the door. Not all the way. Not to where you could see the blonde hair in his bed.
"Shove off." Harry teased and they hugged once more before Ron was gone. Harry stared in the mirror as he tugged on his red jumper. Merlin, time moves fast. Scary fast.
"Lumos." Malfoy whispered as they got engulfed in the dark. They approached the woods without hesitation. Harry led the way as they began the search. They slowly creeped between trees, listening and watching. The half moon shone through the dark clouds, giving them light, and the forest was a symphony of sounds. Insects chirping and leaves rustling, he prayed he would be able to hear the girls.
Realizing how shitty of him it was to run away without even a "Congratulations " Harry sits in his room and drafts an "I'm so very sorry" letter. He was done with it by 1 a.m. According to Harry, it was alright.
Inside was a huge table surrounded by chairs. A wardrobe filled with books and ancient items stood on the opposite side.
"Alright. I was wondering whether we could..umm.. you know how Mother is all alone and Father is very ill?" Draco asks. Harry does know that and Draco goes to the Malfoy Manor every week so Harry literally has no idea where Draco's going with this. Harry rubs his temples then continues to write.
I cover my ears from the ear-splitting sound Draco's Mark just made. I watch in horror as smoke coming from Draco's arm, connected to Potter's wand at one end goes into the glass jar Potter had taken out before. He puts the lid on but before he can close it tightly, Draco's body goes limp and he falls forward. Potter catches him before he falls to the floor.
"You do not talk to an Auror that way, Mr. Farley, nor do you lie to one, and certainly not to the Senior Auror." Harry gazed with burning eyes at the gaunt man who stumbled back a step. "Now tell me who bought this knife from you."
Harry felt his cheeks warm, which wasn't really a common occurrence. "Sorry. I was just...surprised."
"So what are we to do today?" Draco asks a little shakily. He didn't want this to be his last day spent with Harry.
"Harry?" Amanda's soft voice cut through his thoughts, reminding him that he wasn't alone. Amanda didn't ask him anything. She was used to his tendency to brood and get consumed by his thoughts.
He squirmed in his chair. Draco was surprised at seeing Potter's discomfort. Many people had told him he could be scary as a Healer sometimes but he never believed them. Until now, that is.
He suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest, near his heart. His head felt like it would split open any second and someone was prickling his whole body with razor-sharp pins, not only that but they had somehow reached within his chest and his heart was slowly clenching, as if a fist was squeezing the sensitive, vital organ.
His ambition to be an auror did not seem as thrilling after the war. Maybe because he was tired of putting himself in danger or maybe he didn't like the paperwork or following orders but he didn't want to become one anymore. So when McGonagall presented him the oppurtunity, he took it immediately.
Harry's eyes sought the man again, he was the suspected criminal of a case the aurors had been trying to solve for a long time and now he was finally going to be in their hands. Just as the man turned a corner and reached a deserted street, Harry knew that was where he had to be captured.
They walked towards the apparition point in silence for a while. Just as they were about to apparate, Potter's loud voice broke the quiet.
"It's painful. It's like someone's smashing my head with a hammer and breaking my limbs at the same time. I also have trouble breathing and my heart rate slows down. I feel like someone's squeezing my heart." Harry spoke the words reluctantly but after he had said everything, he felt a little lighter. As if a heavy weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
"You're drooling." Draco's head snapped up to look at Potter frowning as he folded his auror robes neatly.
Then he turned back to Kingsley. "Look at this." Draco showed him the vial. Kingsley inspected it closely then raised an eyebrow.
Harry looks at him, really looks at him after all these years. He looks at Malfoy's soft creamy skin, his almond shaped grey eyes, his pointed but attractive chin and his high sharp cheekbones. Handsome. As though a door snapping shut, Harry breaks out of his thoughts, not liking the direction they were going in at all.
However, when Malfoy spoke, his voice was smooth, not even a tremor was present in it to show his fear; Harry was unwillingly impressed. "I didn't mean to offend you, Pott- Auror Potter. It was merely a question to help me reach the end of this case." There was no sarcasm in his voice; Harry was pretty sure he wasn't lying.
"How unfortunate, Mr. Farley. You see, this is a very valuable piece of information we, Aurors, need to solve a case and I have a gut feeling that you can give it to us." Harry smiled lightly.
When Malfoy didn't say anything for a while, Harry realized his efforts were in vain. Why would Malfoy want to forget everything that happened between them in the past? He was just putting up with Harry for this case. And from where did
The broken cottage was secure with Dark wards as Harry had discovered a few days back. He had thought that the wizard was foolish not to have the place secured with wards before and that had troubled Harry; maybe the Dark wizard wanted to lure the Aurors there and set a trap for them, though that didn't seem likely considering that no serious harm had come to the Ministry officials.
Potter's eyes lit up in reply. "Th-thanks, Parkinson. I owe you one." He says urgently and runs towards the apparition point.
With a sigh, Harry rubbed his throbbing temples and answered Ron, "I'm not doing this case with my team, Ron."
Draco frowned, was it something about the case? He hurried in the living room and crouched in front of the fireplace where stood a tense looking Kingsley Shacklebolt.
Harry was stunned at that. It reminded him of Voldemort; the way people talked about him, as if his name alone was taboo, he was merciless, killing anyone in his way. The thought certainly wasn't comforting.
Draco had, indeed, forgotten that he'd be working with a companion but he wouldn't be telling Kingsley that. He schooled his face into a neutral expression, "No not at all." Amusement danced in Kingsley's eyes; he clearly hadn't bought Draco's lie.
"Listen, Malfoy." Harry spoke again, Malfoy's head turned towards him. "I uh- you know that we are supposed to work together, right? And it seems that this case will take a long time to solve so I'd say we are stuck together for a while. What do you say about us starting over? I mean get to know each other the way we are now not what we were in the past." Harry said.
They hadn't seen each other since the war except for the few respectful nods they had shared when Harry visited St. Mungo’s. Malfoy was a Senior Healer and was widely known for his astounding healing abilities. Harry hadn't taken him for a healer but then again, he didn't really know anything about Malfoy, did he?
Then he had, thankfully, unfrozen and came to his senses. Taking a step back Draco snapped at Potter, "It isn't your business." They had omitted the 'Healer Malfoy' and 'Auror Potter' bullshit. Draco knew they wouldn't be able to keep up that charade for long.
"Here, have some whisky. I have to talk to my guests." Pansy thrust a cup in my hand, then she poked the guy beside me in the shoulder and walked away. I frowned at her strange behaviour but kept drinking from my cup.
Harry looked away from his face and thought about the first night he had experienced the strange events. He remembered those words spoken in Parseltongue, they haunted him in nightmares every night but Harry hadn't told anyone about them, not even Ron or Hermione.
"Dance, Malfoy or have you forgotten what that is?" Harry gave Malfoy his bad-boy smirk and his heart almost burst with joy when Malfoy looked like he might swoon.
"Hermione! Give it a rest. You can tell Harry about your research after dinner alright?" Ron says, getting up to go to the kitchen where Molly had called him for help. Hermione huffs but doesn't say anything. Random chatter breaks out in the living room and as Harry looks around at the the people who have loved and cared for him so much, he feels his heart swell with happiness.
Draco sips his butterbeer in silence. Infront of him Blaise and Pansy bicker like they usually do, their butterbeers forgotten. Draco clears his throat to remind them of his presence.
Draco knew he shouldn't enjoy the way his name rolled off Potter's toungue; without any malice or hate, almost with affection, Potter's masculine scent, or the warmth of Potter's arms or the way his hand was tangled in Draco's hair. He probably felt guilty for making Draco cry and that was the reason he was comforting him but Draco wanted to believe that Potter did it because he wanted to, because he wished to hold Draco in his arms.
He started to play with a stray lock of hair which looked very soft and silky and I just wanted to run my hands through Potter's hair while our mouths would be joined together as we- I take a deep breath to banish those thoughts from my mind and prevent myself from getting even more embarrassed by displaying a fucking hard-on.
Draco smirked in reply, "Of course. I wouldn't have generously given you my delicious food if you weren't looking like a starved boy."
"I-I, be ca-careful." And the man fell to the floor, unconscious or dead, Harry had no idea. He searched for a pulse, a breath and was relieved to find a steady one.
"Yeah so I was wondering i-if wecouldgolivewiththemforafewdaysuntilfathergetsbetter." Draco says quickly.
The words were utter nonsense but where were they coming from? Was someone nearby speaking them? Harry doubted that, not many people could speak Parseltongue. Then how was he hearing it?
"It's no problem, Harry." Draco's Mother says, picking up the cup of tea Kreacher served. Draco picks his up too and takes a sip.
From the few days that he had spent in the company of Potter and the other Aurors, Draco had gathered a lot of things about his former arch nemesis. Not that he had been looking for them, mind you. It was just his tendency of being extremely observant making itself prominent.
"Pansy said she'd meet you by the drinks." Blaise said as he reached me. He looked at me from head to toe.
"I do think you can do this. Think of something that has made you the happiest you've ever been. Something you've always wanted. How did you feel when you got it? Focus on that feeling. Let it fill you up. Clear your mind of anything except the emotions you felt at the time. You can do this, Draco. I believe in you."
I stare at Potter and feel my heart burst with joy when I see how much concern and worry is present in his eyes.
He was still tracing the body of the snake, careful not to touch its head or the skull. Then he took out his wand.
"When will I start working? And do I have to come here everyday? You do know that I am a healer, right?" Draco asked, regretting not asking these questions before.
"As I was saying, your partner will be debriefing you about everything we currently know of this case." Kingsley said. He wrote something on a piece of parchment. Draco wondered if he had made the decision too quickly or if this decision was right at all.
"I'm going to talk to the snake, then detach it by a spell the Ministry discovered." Potter explained with an impatient sigh.
Harry cast a cooling charm on the room he was in. The events at the investigation room had left him sweating profusely. It hadn't taken him long but Harry had made the connection that was so easy to make. That didn't mean he liked it.
Harry continued working on his report until Malfoy spoke again. "How did you know that the potion was fatal? Did you test it on anyone?" Malfoy's next question was uttered in the same calm and collected voice as before but it sent a flare of anger through Harry.
Malfoy shook his head, "Well he isn't great but I thought there must've been a reason he got the position he has."
"I wanted to-to talk." Draco whispered, sitting on the couch with Harry but he was far enough that Harry couldn't touch him. Harry nodded in reply to show that he was listening.
Potter snorted, "To please your ever curious wonderment, I asked Will for a reason. We get along well and I don't mind him as my date. Besides, he's handsome."
"I am glad to hear that you have a good memory. It will definitely come in handy for this case." Draco wanted to blast off all of the perfectly white teeth Kingsley was displaying at him but he resisted, barely resisted. Instead Draco gave him a cheeky smile.
Gorgeous, is the only word that came to my mind. My eyes widened and my mouth dropped open. As I stared at the guy, I started to recognize the emerald green eyes, the long black locks and the circular glasses which were no longer as hideous as before.
I saw a frown between Potter's brows as he worked on my arm. He started to speak then and the sounds made my stomach clench. It was all Parseltongue and I couldn't understand a word of it but the sound of it was like music to my ears.
Smith's black eyes widened and with a nod he went towards the living room. Harry got up and went to the guest room Smith had pointed to, succumbing himself to sleep in the warm bed.
She looks at me confusedly but nods, nonetheless. I walk behind her as she leads me to a room with black walls and a huge bed.
"So how did you and Pansy become...friends?" I asked, recovering a little bit from seeing Potter's surprising (and extremely sexy) appearance.
Draco cast a Protective Charm on his hands and felt the invisible sheet of magic cover them. He reached forward and grabbed a little bit of the green paste in his fingers. Draco had been right, there were glittering pieces of jewels in a dull green paste. He had to investigate what the paste contained and if these were really emeralds, artificial stones or crystallized poison.
Yet, yet this case, the one that actually concerned him, put him in danger, was the one he couldn't solve.
"Umm I came on the order of the Ministry and removed his Dark Mark for him?" He says, though it sounds more like a question. I notice that he sounds a little scared, good.
Draco frowns. He doesn't know what Potter means by that. He looks at Mother for help but finds her frowning at Potter too.
The other Potion, the one the Aurors had evacuated was blood-red, it must've been made with the pure blood extracted from the Kedavra Potion.
Pansy and Blaise had come to help me get through the process as Mother and Father were still in Azkaban for another year to complete their punishment.
"Now since you've mastered the Levitating spell, let's move to something more challenging. How about...ummm...say...a Reducto?"
Draco had noticed his Mother's behaviour too. He knew she missed Lucius, knew how hard it was for her to live without him but he always avoided talking about his Father, especially in front of Mother.
The last thought surprised him. He didn't want Potter to smile at him. Absolutely not. He was Draco Malfoy; he didn't care about Harry Potter one single bit-
"I...it only happened once." Harry muttered lightly tracing a pattern on the table with his fingers.
Harry rolled his eyes with a sigh; he was so damn tired. "I am not lying, Ron. Anyways, we've made a truce to work together in peace." Harry waved his hand dismissively.
"Go look in the mirror." Pansy squeals, clapping her hands together and jumping up and down behind me.
Draco scowled at everyone as he walked through the Ministry even though anyone hardly paid him attention but a man's gotta keep his reputation upright.
Draco's heart drops. He was never able to produce a Patronus. He had tried, of course. In hideen spots at his home or Hogwarts but he probably had too much trauma in his mind too produce a Patronus. Probably seeing Draco's inner turmoil on his face, Harry peers at him with concerned eyes.
His eyebrows shot up at the Ministry of Magic seal on the envelope. He hadn't had to deal with them since the trials. After completing his house arrest, he had worked as a minor healer at St. Mungos and soon grew to be famous and known for his incredible healing abilities.
Draco thought the wizard might have done exactly that but he didn't say so. No need to terrify the poor man further.
Now he groaned once again as Ginny worked on his hair rather cruelly. According to her it was "grown out rather sexily" and that Harry would look "very hot in a man bun". Harry let her style his hair, mainly to keep her happy.
Harry took a deep breath, not looking away from the reassuring expression on Malfoy's face and continued.
decline but then again curiousity killed the cat, didn't it? Draco was curious but he just hoped it wouldn't get him killed.
"And now we have a special song for a special pair. I know it was my Birthday but I dedicate this dance to the cutest couple in the Wizarding World. Get it Dray!"
"Yes, Mother. I – there’s a yearly Ministry Ball and they have invited me too." He muttered, not meeting his mother's eyes.
Narcissa, though didn't seem to mind. She gracefully picked up the teacup that Kreacher had served and took a sip. Her eyes closed for a few minutes. Harry drank his tea too, it was warm and tasted good.
Harry was brought back from his thoughts by Malfoy's voice, "Do you have the potion sample that was collected?" He asked.
"I- I just ... You know how our past was. We insulted each other a lot and pretty harshly too. I don't want that in this case. It is challenging as it is. I do believe, and hope, that we are much more mature than that now." Harry said, looking Malfoy in the eye to convey how honest he was.
Potter sighs again then stands up and walks to the middle of the room. He flicks his wand and the table in the centre moves to the side.
I obey and stare at the blurry figure of Pansy. She slides my glasses on my face and steps back. I blink for a few minutes and then everything comes into focus.
"Okay." Draco says. He doesn't want to sit in awkward silence so he tries to get to know Potter, their professionalism aside, he wants to befriend Potter, maybe more after that. See if Potter actually likes him or is doing this only out of obligation. Even though he knows Potter doesn't like him that way, why would he? He is a Greek God while Draco is just slim and pale and pointy but a small part of him hopes and wishes that Potter would want to be with him as much as he wants to be with Potter but just as he is about to ask the first question, Potter abruptly stands up.
Harry's eyes widened as he realized what he had just said. He didn't want to tell Malfoy that he and Pansy had become friends because she had helped him in getting him and Malfoy together, so he had said the only thing that came to mind. But now it was done and he couldn't take it back so, fuck it,  I want to make him mine today so why not have a dance? Harry thought.
"I'm fine." Harry replied. He didn't know why he wasn't telling his friends about the recent bullshit in his life; believing they would be worried was still a good enough reason but if Harry was in their place, he'd definitely want to know what was bothering his friend even if it was terrifying.
Ron's face scrunched up in confusion. "But he's the second-in-command on your team." He said, staring at Harry.
"Okay? You look amazing. The sexiest guy I've ever seen." She winks at me. "I'd totally date you if you weren't gay." Pansy pouts at me and I roll my eyes.
The music was an old rock song that wasn't meant for a slow dance but Harry wasn't aware of the world around himself anyway, all he could focus on was the slender body in his arms.
"Come on, let's just go eat somewhere. We've been here for ages." Potter got up but didn't move forward when Draco kept sitting.
Draco ignored the rest of the ingredients and the method, turning the page to the effects of the potion. His heart was beating fast, his fingers tingling in anticipation.
"Yes, yes, I remember. So? Have you decided?" Potter asked. Draco had no idea what was going on so he only flitted his eyes from the guy, Will apparently, to Potter.
"N-no. He'll kill me, he'll kill me and everyone I love!" The man shouted with fear, his eyes flitting behind Harry's large form as though expecting the Dark wizard to appear there any instant.
Harry nodded, "We do have it but Kingsley has kept it hidden safely, considering the danger it poses. He'll let us inspect it if we request, though."
"Its working great. I can do everything I could before." Draco exclaimed, happy at the change of topic.
Harry entered the dark shop at Knockturn Alley; Farley's Trading Hub. He didn't bother knocking on the door, opening it wide with a simple nudge of his heavy auror boot.
"Not now, Mother. Even though the aurors will be protecting me, I believe I am not that much of a weakling to not be able face any danger myself. I did survive in a house full of Dark wizards, after all." He saw Mother go pale at his words, her mouth opening to respond to his remark but Draco apparated without waiting for her disappointed chiding.
Draco had, actually, not been wondering that. After doing all of the evil things he had done in his years at Hogwarts, he had tried his best to make up for them by becoming a healer. Saving lives instead of being the cause of their end felt... comforting...somehow but after hearing about all of the things these Aurors had done, Draco's work seemed nothing. He wanted to be remembered, remembered for something good, for something other than being a Death Eater.
"Let's just go and see." Harry got up and so did Malfoy. They apparated to Kingsley's office, bracing themselves for what was to come ahead.
"I think I know why you and Pansy became friends." I mutter, not wanting Potter to keep looking at me the way he was right now, I would probably faint (or worse swoon) if he continued that.
Just as Draco's about to ask which object he has to perform the spell on, Potter casts a calming charm and Draco forgets everything. He closes his eyes, reaches towards his magic and after much practice, reaches it in less time than his previous tries. He has no idea where to aim the Reducto so he blindly aims his wand, hoping it isn't at Potter but just as he is about to cast, a heavy something collides with his wand arm that he falls to the floor on his arse.
"Ar-are you sure I c-can d-do it?" Draco stutters like a 5 year old, once again embarrassed by his inability to perform simple magic even 1st years should know. Potter's genuine smile, which he recieved in return was probably worth it.
He knew he must look intimidating in his Auror robes; tailored specially to suit his muscular build. The muscles in his arms, visible due to the rolled sleeves, flexed as he rolled his shoulders.
"Me?" Malfoy asked as he picked up the wooden menu a waiter in a tailored black coat just placed in front of them.
"What's wrong, sweetheart?" Harry asked but he turned back to his file. He knows that Draco didn't like being pampered or babied even when he was feeling sad or nervous.
It's like I flipped open a switch. Her eyes light up and she shows me a kind of tube that she had been holding.
Draco had noticed the guy here and there in the Ministry and had always found his eyes on Potter. Draco didn't know what their relationship was but whatever it was, it annoyed Draco. Mainly because of the way he
Inside was a wide room, it was dark inside until Kingsley lit the lamps with a wave of his wand. Draco looked around; the walls and floor were wooden. A huge table was in the middle and at the far wall behind it was a shelf stretching from one end to the other. It had tiny vials that Draco recognized instantly as potion ingredients. Kingsley went towards a far cupboard that Draco hadn't noticed before. He traced another pattern on it that Draco didn't see and the door opened.
It shouldn't have bothered him whatever Potter said but it did. He had thought that after the surprising confession he had made to Potter about him regretting his actions and all, Potter might've forgiven him but clearly, he hadn't. Draco had been a fool to believe otherwise.
He took a deep breath, steeled himself and stepped out of the bathroom. He walked with resolve towards the Investigating Room where the potions were kept. Kingsley had taught him the pattern used to unlock the door.
"Great." Harry opened a drawer, took out a random file. Anything to distract him from that expression on Malfoy's face. It made him uncomfortable, though Harry didn't know why.
Narcissa takes a deep breath and knocks on the door. It is exactly 11:59 p.m. as mother so kindly reminded Draco that punctuality makes a great impression. Draco doesn't know whether she knew about his crush on Potter and was trying to rub it in his face or whether it was another one of her "pure-blood rules" bullshit.
"Now remember, Draco, no disrespect, no sarcasm and no whinings. I want you to act as a respected member of a respected family." Narcissa says. Draco is about to remind her that Malfoys are hardly a "respected" family anymore when the door swings open and Draco sucks in a sharp breath.
"Now close your eyes, feel your magic and hold the connection with it. I'm sure you know the wand movement for Wingardium Leviosa?" Potter asks. Draco nods in reply.
Harry gasped as a loud pop echoed in his room. He stood up, wand drawn, his chair clattering loudly to the floor.
"So you haven't made any progress with the potion or the paste, right?" Potter stopped walking and turned to face Draco.
. Pansy and Blaise always said those words to him. That he was too stuck up for a 23-year old. He hardly went clubbing with them, or went on dates or slept with strangers like most people his age do. He was too busy with the war and then with fulfilling his promise to make the Malfoy's reputation better again.
"D-Draco?" He asked hesitantly, moving a little closer to Malfoy. When Malfoy didn't pull back but stared at Harry's feet, Harry took it as a sign of encouragement and moved forward. He squatted infront of Malfoy and attempted to comfort him again.
"So what's so special in this cranky old decaying book?" Potter spoke as he took a seat behind his office table, Draco already seated in front of him.
"You want to go and live there again? Haven't we already made enough memories there? Not to remind you that they aren't good ones. I don't want to see those gates or that cellar to remind me of how I was captured there or how Hermione was tortured. And you? Haven't you been Crucioed there enough times? Haven't you recieved the Dark Mark there? You want to relive those memories again?" Harry shouts.
"So Mr. Malfoy, you must be wondering why I invited you here." He said, folding his arms on the table and leaning back in his chair.
Aaand that was the chapter..do tell me what you think it really means a lot. I'll try to update as soon as I can!♡♡
"Will it h-hurt?" I asked, my voice quavering. Merlin could I get anymore pathetic. I felt Pansy's hand on the small of my back, comforting me.
"I did not mean to offend you, Mr. Malfoy. It is just a precautionary measure we, Aurors, must take." Kingsley spoke. "All I can tell you about this case is that it involves a Dark Wizard, a Potion and is very dangerous." Kingsley said cryptically.
Draco knew he could decline. He wasn't compelled to go there, was he? No he wasn't. He wanted to decline, he
working on this case but this particular occurrence involves some areas outside of your expertise. Hence you will be having to work with a partner. I have a list of some candidates I think would suit best for this case, evaluate them and choose the best. Remember Auror Potter, choose who you think has the most expertise and not who you would get along with well."
"Before, I didn't push you because I wasn't sure whether you had magic at all or not. Now I was sure so I did push you. As for what I casted, it was a simple calming charm."
Potter grabbed my wrist gently and I felt my heart flutter at the contact. He closed his eyes for a few seconds. I felt Pansy and Blaise stare at my arm too. Their presence reassured me, told me they were always there for me.
"Ummm.. an Accio, I guess? No no.. it was an Alohomora.. yeah.. I performed an Alohomora on my bedroom door, or tried to, you can say."
Draco groaned and whipped out his wand, first casting a Lightening charm on the auror in front of him, then Levitating him outside the room.
It wasn't like the way the Dark Lord spoke at all. Even though it was the same language, anyone could tell whatever Potter was saying was different from what
Potter nods, looking thoughtful again. Draco realizes that Potter isn't a professional in this field, but his questions kind of made sense. Still Draco has no idea whether or not Potter will be able to help him. Draco knows all the spells, the wand movements and everything else important to perform magic but he still can't do anything.
Thanks alot for reading!.. Your kudos and comments mean a lot.. The next chapter will be up next week.♡♡
"Oh Malfoy, it is my business when you mention it to me." Potter had leaned forward, his face so extremely close to Draco that their noses had almost touched. For a moment the only thought in Draco's head was that Potter was fucking
Draco walked behind the desk, picking up the little vial of the blood red potion. Potter nodded with a sigh and grabbed a piece of parchment, scribbling on it.
Draco stared at a point behind Potter's shoulder, not able to meet his eyes. "Just...it seems weird that you'd forcefully interact with someone when you don't want to."
I looked in the mirror again. I had decided to wear a black-button down shirt with tight black pants, to show that I had been working out. I decided that the full sleeves seemed too formal, it was a party after all, so I rolled them up to my elbows (and maybe I wanted to show the muscles on my arms too).
Draco closed his mouth and wiped his lips with as much dignity as he could muster, which wasn't much.
Malfoy sags in relief and looks at his mother with a small smile on his face Harry has never seen before. His mother smiles back then stands up.
"Mr. Farley, I indeed do need your help in a matter." Harry reached in his robes and pulled out a rolled-up piece of parchment.
Harry's anger flared, he placed his palms flat on the table loudly, leaning forward in Malfoy's face. "Don't tell me what to do, Malfoy. You aren't my boss."
Draco closed his eyes and thought of the way Harry had hugged him, the way Harry had rocked him back and forth, the way Harry's warm hand had massaged Draco's head on the night of Draco's panic attack. Draco wanted Harry to do that again, do that and so much more. Draco imagined Harry's soft, pink lips touching his. Imagined Harry's warm hand on Draco's cheek. Even though Draco had never been kissed, involved in war and being a Death Eater and all, he knew that a kiss was magical. He wanted to experience it with Harry. Wanted Harry to be his first kiss, his first boyfriend, his first everything. So with that feeling, that hope, that wish in mind, Draco shouted Expecto Patronum and in his heart he knew he had done it this time even before opening his eyes.
"Speak up, Malfoy. You know how curious I am. I'll get it out of you soon enough." Harry tapped his fingers against the hard wood of his table.
Harry's magic is warm and when he is too happy, too angry or too sad it becomes hot like fire. Malfoy's magic, however, is cold. It must start too freeze when he feels extreme emotions but right now it is calm and relaxed. Having done what he wanted to, Harry pulls out of Malfoy's mind and stands panting infront of him.
I watch, after casting a disillusionment charm on myself, as Potter sits beside the sofa Draco is laying on. He is staring at my unconscious best friend and I can't see him doing anything to harm Draco.
The first thing Draco saw when he apparated into Shacklebolt's office was the picture. It showed a dark room, unrecognizable and very ramshackle. Blood covered the wooden floor, dark red and velvety. Two bodies lay in the liquid puddle, their pale bodies covered in long deep cuts. Serious wounds were present on their necks and wrists. The sight was extremely disturbing and Draco felt revolted, bile rising in his throat.
Draco climbed down the stairs into the dining room. Mother was already seated, the table filled with platters of pancakes, eggs, bacon and a huge jug of pumpkin juice.
"Oh I don't know, a confidential auror discussion?" Ron walked forward, sitting in Harry's chair. Harry jumped down from his position on the table and turned around to face Ron, standing beside Malfoy's chair.
She shouts and even though no one knows who she calls "Dray", they all turn to look at me, in Potter's arms, because Pansy is grinning and waggling her eyebrows at me. I feel my blush spread from the tips of my ears all the way to my chest.
Then he nodded and replied, "Thank you, Sir Shacklebolt." With that, Draco disappirated to the office of his unknown partner.
The house was partly demolished, and the Aurors found more dead bodies inside. As they investigated further, they noticed a strange red liquid in one of the cauldrons. It wasn’t enough to determine the ingredients used in the potion. After running it through a few potioneers, they had determined that it was highly fatal, and the ingredients used were unknown. Only one vial of the potion remained. Kingsley had asked Harry to search the house, look for the suspect and investigate the last vial. Harry knew that was why he needed a partner; he was rubbish at potions.
"I’m alright, don’t worry.” Harry said, giving her an unconvincing smile. “I have completed the report on our previous case. I'd appreciate it if you sent it to Robards."
"Do you want to borrow this? We can research at the Ministry. Kingsley might get angry if we aren't there soon." Potter spoke thoughtfully.
"Just let me eat, okay? I don't have time to eat with one fork and slice with the other." Potter said, his mouth still full.
he'd only caught the man gazing at Potter only once or twice but it still didn't prevent him from scowling at the auror.
Draco had nothing to say to that. He had spent so much time with Harry and he would even call them great friends now but thinking of stopping the moments they spent together brought a strange ache to Draco's heart. He was sure Harry wouldn't want to hang out with him after these lessons. He had only agreed to help Draco to return an owed favour, hadn't he? He hadn't chose to teach Draco because he had wanted to spend time with him. As much as Draco wished it was true, he didn't want to build a false hope in his heart and have it broken into pieces. He wouldn't do that to himself.
"T-thank you. Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means." Dray whispers. His arm is shaking and is face is bone white.
"I think Potter's up to something. I have a gut feeling. You go and get the bowl, I'll see." I whisper.
"So I was thinking that.. well, I'm pretty sure you won't like this but I talked to Pansy and she said it would be alright and you won't get that annoyed because you really cared about me and all. Of course you do, you're my boyfriend. You are supposed to take care of me but-"
"Er…I'll take the...Butter chicken with…curry. Make the spice level 5." Harry handed his menu back too.
The minute they were outside and the door was closed, Potter gave a huge gasp and sat up on the ground, his pain no more visible on his face. He rubbed his cheeks then looked up at Draco.
He had entered the house before and it was the same as he had left it, except for the absent dead bodies. The puddle of blood was still there, it's disgusting smell in the air.
Draco's stomach tightened further. He spoke through clenched teeth, "I thought you didn't care about the ball?"
He was brought back from his thoughts with Mother's soft palm on his cheek. "My love, don't worry about me. I will be fine and so will you. I wish you the best in your deal with the Aurors." She then got up and left the room, leaving Draco with his own thoughts.
Two more deaths had been reported in the town of Purely. The residents of the town were terrified and some of them had started to leave the place but most of them didn't have enough money to buy a new one somewhere else hence they were forced to stay.
"Oh! This is the DMLE staff. This is Sir Shacklebolt, the Senior Head Auror" The Hufflepuff girl stood beside him and pointed to a picture of Kingsley Shacklebolt giving a small smile. Below it was a bunch of text about him.
Then, suddenly he felt a such a tortuous agony all over, it was like he had been Crucioed; his arms and legs were bent at a strange angle, his body twitching in pain as he released unintentional moans of pain. It was the worst Crucio, if it was that at all, he had ever felt. His whole body hurt so much, it was like someone was trying to tear him apart limb by limb.
Dolohov kept quiet, so Harry continued, "I know, Dolohov. You serve him and help me too, because, when one day one of us wins, you'll be in favour with both. It's cowardly but clever enough, I'll give you that."
"So I will be asking you a few questions and I want you to answer them truthfully. Don't feel embarassed and if you don't want to answer a question, just say so." Potter says looking at Draco.
His relationship with Ginny wasn't the same after the war. They had given dating another try but Ginny wasn't so invested and for Harry there was no more spark in their relationship so they decided to end it. Ginny was happy with Neville but Harry didn't settle in a relationship right away. However, Harry did mess around with random people. He went to clubs, had one-night stands and did everything an 18 year old does. Before he didn't had much freedom but now he lived his life to the fullest. All that was missing in his life was a partner who would give him the love and care he deserved.
"The only time my gut feeling was proved wrong, was when I thought I wouldn't kill a criminal if he begged me." Harry saw the man's eyes flit away nervously.
They stopped in front of a small metal door in a dark hallway. Kingsley used his wand to trace a weird pattern on it; a triangle with little circles around it's perimeter. In the centre of the triangle was a complicated pattern of straight lines and curves. Once Kingsley was done, the pattern glowed bright purple and with a creaking sound, the door opened.
Now they were all seated on the living room of Grimauld Place, a cup of tea and cake served by Kreacher in their hands.
Harry sighed and placed his head on the back of the chair he was seated in. "It's a bunch of reasons really." He started to speak; it had been a long time since he'd talked to someone. "First of all, he didn't really deserve his position. The only reason he became Minister was because the Head of the Wizengamot is someone he knows. It was all corruption and injustice. They covered him getting the position by saying that he had fought many death eaters, it was a noble act, blah blah. Noble act my arse. All he did was kill Death Eaters who had completed their punishments in Azkaban. Only, no one knew they had." Harry sighed, he detested not being able to do anything against the injustices.
"Does he know we left?" Harry chuckled lightly at Malfoy's panicked expression. The guy followed the rules too much.
"I'm not lying. You're so beautiful, Draco. I'm so proud of you. You did it, Draco. I knew you could do it."
"Yes, I would love that." He replied and the expression on Harry's face was one of a man whose biggest wish had come true. With a laugh Harry pulled Draco into another toe-curling kiss.
With a sigh Draco tells them about the settlement with Potter, how much Potter has changed and their first lesson about Draco's magic. After he finishes speaking, there is a stunned silence which is broken by Pansy, "How great! Now you can finally tell him about your feelings. I swear I was so tired of your pining after him. Potter this, Potter that. Potter's hair, Potter's eyes, Potter's ars-"
Harry saw Smith's eyes widen. "The man was there? The wizard?" He asked in a hushed tone as if the evil wizard was listening to them. Harry didn't like it, it reminded him too much of people calling Voldemort You-Know-Who.
Malfoy stood up, facing Harry with rebellion written clearly on his face. "Neither are you mine. I will tell Kingsley if I want to." He stood up and turned to leave but before he could step away, Harry grabbed Malfoy's arm.
"Save it, Potter. You are right anyway. I always do the wrong thing." He grabbed the book that was sitting on the table and marched out of Harry's office.
He reached the DMLE Office and knocked on the black door. A perky and extremely Hufflepuff girl opened it with a beaming smile.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut against the throbbing in his head. The words were swirling around in his head; Dreadful. Poisonous. Deadly.
He felt Harry move closer to Draco's face. Draco knew Harry was giving him time to move away but Draco didn't, of course he didn't. He had wanted this for ages and now he was finally getting it.
Harry burried his head in Draco's soft hair, occasionally kissing his head and murmuring sweet words. Soon he hears Draco's sobs stop and his breathing even out. Harry tenderly lays Draco on the bed, covering him with a blanket.
"I-" Draco started to say but he had no idea what. He had absolutely no idea what this case was about and what he was getting in.
For a moment, Draco was speechless as he stared at the white muggle t-shirt Potter was wearing. It stretched tight over his chest and clung to the prominent and taught lines of his defined abs. The short sleeves did justice to Potter's arms; muscular and tan. Draco noticed that his shirt was covered in sweat.
If anyone would've told him that he would be sitting in front of Draco Malfoy and be grinning at him like a maniac, he would've called them crazy; he couldn't have spent a single moment with Malfoy and enjoy it.
"Gaze up, Draco. You are making me feel ashamed." Narcissa says when Potter leaves the room to find Kreacher. Draco nods and looks around the room.
did I do this? What was I thinking? Draco's tendency to overthink everything was starting to show itself but all thought left his mind when he saw just
"So Harry-" Draco gives a surprised jerk at that and stares at his Mother. He didn't know she was on a first name basis with Potter. Mother probably noticing his reaction gives him a little glare and continues "- So about Draco's magic."
Harry had gone and investigated the house in Purely again, without Kingsley's permission of course but it didn't really matter because he hadn't been able to enter it anyway.
Mother raised an eyebrow and took a bite of her food gracefully. With a deep breath Draco started to talk, this won't end well.
"But in all seriousness, Draco, I do wish you get your magic back. Hopefully Potter can work it out." Blaise says getting a nod of agreement from Pansy. Draco nods too, wishing the same in his heart.
"Oh, Potter. I'm hosting a birthday party for myself. Come, bring Granger and Weasley too if you want. Dress nicely, practice flirting and make a move. I'll owl you my address."
"Well, you certainly can! Sir is going to be visiting the Dark Materials shop at Knockturn Alley tomorrow and then he'll be.." Draco tuned the girl out as she babbled on about what Shacklebolt would be doing this whole month. He had given up trying to make her stop being such a Hufflepuff which seemed truly impossible.
"And you? Don't you deserve to be happy?" Malfoy asked. He was leaning forward, close to Harry's face. Harry could see specks of blue in his grey eyes, sparkling with an emotion Harry didn't know or was too afraid to know.
"Oh stop thinking about Potter. Did you see the latest broom? I've heard it is faster than the previous Lighter 2000 they released." After that they hadn't talked about Potter at all, just enjoyed together as they did everytime.
I am about to tell him that we can just Accio the bowls, no need to go and get them but I have a feeling he wants to be alone with Draco. Why, I have no idea because Draco is unconscious but if Potter is up to something I want to figure it out.
Draco's eyes widened in horror at Potter's statement, his Healer habits showing as he exclaimed loudly, "Potter! Don't you know how bad missing breakfast is for your health? Salazar's sake haven't you ever heard that it is the most important meal of the day?"
Healer Brandon raised an eyebrow at him after reading the application he had been presented. "Your first vacation, Healer Malfoy? I must say it is pretty surprising but you do deserve a good rest. May I ask what brings you to take some days off work?"
"What the heck is that?" I shout backing away. Merlin knows what she's about to do. You can never tell with a girl like Pansy.
"That's very Gryffindor of you to say it so crudely." Draco looked up at Harry through his lashes and saw Harry's tanned cheecks stained cherry red by a very adorable blush and a soft smile curling his lips.
The calming charm ends, Draco looks around for the cause of his fall and his eyes widen when he realizes it was Potter who pushed him.
"I just remembered that there's a library here. It has all kinds of books. Maybe you'll find something about the potion there?" Potter spoke and Draco stopped scowling. The git was right; maybe the library had some old books with the information he needed.
"People in the Wizengamot tried to stop it from happening but they couldn't really do anything. There might not be much evil in the Wizarding world after the war but there certainly are lies and corruption." Harry shook his head in frustration.
Potter, however, seemed to be unaware of simple table adicates as he muttered around a particularly large bite of chicken, "I was starving."
"Potter? He's here?" I ask confusedly. The last time I had seen him was when he had removed my Mark. I still wasn't used to the Markless skin on my arm.
His time spent with Potter today wasn't as bad as Draco had expected except for the start. He was glad that they had apologized to each other and gotten rid of any misunderstandings. Apologizing had definitely lifted a weight from Draco's heart. Perhaps, if they remained extremely professional, they could get through this case.
"No... he didn't find what he was looking for and... he got angry. He raged and raged...shouting something about...revenge and murder. I thought he was mad so I tried to stun him, call the healers but...before I could, he was gone. As if he read my mind."
Harry and Malfoy sat in awkward silence. It suddenly struck Harry how absurd it was, sitting with Draco Malfoy in a fancy restaurant, waiting for their order to arrive.
And when he looked down at me, those beautiful eyes shining and those soft lips stretched in the most gorgeous smile I've ever seen, I couldn't resist it. Without thinking I reached on my toes, removing my hand from his and putting both my arms around his neck, I pressed my lips to his.
Harry needed to tell someone about how much he wanted Draco or he would go crazy, he needed advice, needed to know how he would control himself from holding Draco tightly to his chest when he would be seeing Draco out the door of his house, not knowing whether he will ever be able to see him step in again. So Harry had asked Ron and Hermione to come over and help him. He had talked to Charlie through letters, because Charlie was visiting Bulgaria for some work but all he had gotten as a reply was to confess all his feelings to Draco, which Harry probably wasn't Gryffindor enough to do.
"Fine but this better be important." The librarian gave him a nasty look and turned around towards a tapestry. He moved it to reveal a dark brown door on which the old man traced a complicated pattern.
Harry shook his head, "No. The form you signed will prevent you from sharing anything about this case with an outsider."
"I don't see how this is any of your business." Mother said, her eyes blazing with disapproval. Draco was all too aware of the spark of triumph in his own eyes at the fact that she hadn't denied the assumption he had made.
With a nod Draco disapperated to the library Potter had taken him to, his mind remembering that beautiful day, the way the street lights' glow had reflected in Potter's striking green eyes.
"Sure? You mean you want to be friends?" Draco wanted to hex Potter now. Wasn't he the one who had requested that in the first place?
Draco opened the letter, not sure why they were contacting him now but he was pretty sure he hadn't done anything wrong or illegal.
The chilly voice was his only companion as it laughed, a cruel and icy sound. "Look at yourself, Harry Potter. You're nothing in front of me." The voice whispered.
A sudden urge to beat his confused, innocent face to a bloody pulp comes over me but I resist. No good beating up my best friend's future boyfriend.
"I am extremely sorry for making you wait for such a long while, Mr. Malfoy. Oh and I thank you for gracing us with your presence." A deep voice spoke. Draco whipped around to see Kingsley Shacklebolt looking at him with a tight-lipped smile.
Kingsley smiled, "We, Aurors, take an oath before we start working, Mr. Malfoy. We pledge that it'd be an honour for us if we die fighting for the betterment of the Wizarding World. Our top priority is to complete our mission first and foremost, regardless of our physical condition or our amount of will to serve."
They continued kissing and stopped only when breathing became a problem. Draco stared in Harry's eyes, while Harry stared back.
"Indeed a favour. I lied to the Dark Lord for you. You owe me a life debt." Harry was stunned. He did remember that she had saved him but a life debt?
Draco lay in his bed, still awake. He wouldn't admit it but Potter's reaction had affected him more than he would've liked. Draco knew Potter didn't like him, he had made it all too clear at Hogwarts but when he spoke at Draco's trial, a part of Draco thought he could change Potter's opinion about himself but today, after seeing the disgust in his eyes, Draco could feel his heart break into a million pieces. Why was he helping Draco when he didn't want to see him make progress? Hadn't he said again and again how he hoped Draco made progress? Was the admiration and pride in his eyes when Draco was able to feel his magic fake? Draco hadn't expected Potter to return Draco's feelings but spending time with Potter, albeit very little had gotten to his head. He should just quit their lessons. It would be better for both him and Potter. His heart would break of course but Draco's heart was already so broken, his only hope of Potter mending it back had gone away, crushing the broken pieces to dust.
Potter kept talking to the snake and at one time it opened its mouth wide and showed its deadly fangs in reply. I jerked back but Potter's hand was now so tight around my wrist that I was sure it'd leave marks.
"Nothing happened to me, Ron. Just a very difficult new case." Harry answered, hiding the case files as Ron sat in front of him. Ron didn't mind him keeping the files away from view; he knew that auror cases were supposed to be confidential.
Potter is standing near Draco, breathing heavily and staring at something infront of him. Draco is about to ask what the hell just happened when Potter turns his eyes on him and all thought leaves Draco's mind.
The last time it had moved like that was when the Dark Lord was branding me with the foul thing. I panicked and tried to snatch my arm away from Potter but he held on tight. I could feel Blaise grab my right arm and Pansy's hand was still on my back but all I could focus on was the fact that the snake was
"Ready?" Kingsley asked. Draco nodded in reply and watched, frozen in place as Kingsley used his wand to uncover the corpses.
"Yes. That is the reason I am here. Sir Shacklebolt said that you would be telling me the details of this case?" Malfoy arched an eyebrow.
The Hufflepuff girl was smiling dreamily at Potter's grinning picture. Draco rolled his eyes at her sappiness. "When will the mighty Sir Shacklebolt grace us with his presence?" Draco asked her but it wasn't the girl who answered.
As Harry stood, breathing hard and staring at the expression of hurt and fury that passed over Malfoy's face, Harry realized that he had gone too far.
"Why couldn't I do it before? And what did you cast at me?" Draco asks Potter who now sat infront of him.
Amanda jostled out of the thoughts in her head, "Oh, yes. I'm perfectly fine. You seem tired, Harry. Didn’t get enough sleep?”
"Sure. Thanks once again." Narcissa says and gets up and Harry shows her out the door. Closing the door behind him, Harry takes a minute to think what the hell he has gotten himself into.
When no reply came, Harry took it as a yes and wrapped his arms around Malfoy. At first Malfoy froze but when Harry ran a hand down his back, he relaxed and sobbed into Harry's shoulder. Harry whispered to him about how sorry he was and that he had no idea what had come over him. That Draco had done nothing wrong, that he was a good man, that it wasn't Draco's fault, all the while Harry's hand ran down Malfoy's back in a comforting gesture while the other hand massaged his head.
"I see. So it had nothing to do with a certain someone murdering innocents left and right?" Harry saw Dolohov flinch at the words again.
"Oh Malfoy, you'll regret not telling me now. You should know that I am extremely stubborn and curious so don't think you can get away with this."
"Yeah, here." Blaise keeps the bowl infront of him and sits cross-legged on the carpet. I sit beside him.
Harry rubbed his temples, his feet propped up on his office table. He hadn't planned on shouting at Kingsley, specially not in front of Malfoy but lately he had been feeling...different. There was a constant throbbing in his head and his blood was always boiling.
Potter smiled at him but his expression didn't have the same sparkle it had on the first day. "That's great news, Malfoy. I am glad you've made progress." Is all he said before getting up and clearing space in his living room.
Draco screams in frustration. He doesn't want to show how much of a squib he is to Potter. He's had a huge crush on Potter since 5th year and even though he had disguised his feelings as hate, he doubts one-on-one time with Potter would do anything to help him. With a groan he stands up to get ready.
"You make it sound so…heartless, Harry. It wasn't like that." Kingsley spoke nervously although it sounded as if he was reassuring himself as much as Potter.
"Yes, I am working." Harry said, waiting for Draco to tell him what's wrong but Draco only nodded and went to the kitchen. Harry's frown deepened but he didn't think much about it. Draco will tell him when he's ready. Harry started to work on his report again.
He saw Malfoy frown in reply, and Harry realized that it wasn't the best of him to mention Malfoy's Death Eater past at a moment like this, when they were in public specially.
"I'm calling it a day. You can stay here if you want but make sure to lock it behind you." Harry spoke to Malfoy.
Harry blew his breath from puffed cheeks in an attempt to calm himself. "Yes, Ron. That's a rather accurate summary. Now if you don't mind, I have to go. I am already late enough for work."
"Lumos." Draco whispered, leaning forward with the light illuminated by his wand to observe the thing, whatever it was, more closely.
"I am not. And don't think I'll just forget whatever happened in there. You're going to tell me, Potter." Draco stood up and so did Potter.
That night all Draco could think was that he had done it, he had gotten his magic back and he had made Harry his; the two things that were his biggest desires.
Narcissa nods and steps inside, removing her cloack and giving it to Kreacher who had appeared beside her as soon as she entered, looking too gleeful at seeing her.
Draco stared as Potter picked at Draco's food with his fork, his appetite seemed to have vanished suddenly. Draco frowned, he hadn't meant to offend Potter or anything.
"You will do exactly as I say, Draco because you promised you would." Narcissa says calmy, taking a sip from her tea.
"Take a seat, Mr. Malfoy. Here drink this." Kingsley pushed a goblet of water towards him, which Draco accepted gladly and downed in one gulp.
"Harry." Kingsley interrupted Potter's screams with a calm voice. His posture showed that he was rather use to of these kinds of aggressive fits from Potter. "You know that we have a ball every year. Don't you remember the last time we-"
His breathing was coming in uneven short bursts. Harry clawed at his throat with pale, shaking hands; hoping to get some air in his lungs but his efforts were futile. Just then the hissing became more prominent as he felt a familiar burst of pain from the infamous scar on his forehead.
"Oh! Great. I'm Sara, I am a receptionist here. Sir Shacklebolt's already informed me about your visit. You'll have to wait for a few minutes until he calls you in though. Please do take a seat in the meanwhile." She invited Draco in, pointing to a black, leather couch.
The snake suddenly hissed loudly and stretched itself. Its fangs were an inch away from Potter's fingers which were wrapped tightly around my wrist. I gasped and heard Pansy shout in horror, Blaise's hand tightened on my arm.
"Cafina Street." Malfoy said, looking around. "It is near Mungo’s, I usually come here for shopping. More convenient than going to Diagon Alley."
"Can I..uh.. c-can.. umm.. do you-uh-need a hug?" Harry asked stupidly. It was the only thing that made him feel better after a panic attack. Knowing that someone was there for him, that he was safe always made him feel better. Besides, Harry didn't had a choice, did he? He had tried talking to Malfoy but it didn't help and maybe a selfish part of Harry just wanted to hold Malfoy in his arms.
for the betterment of the Wizarding World, that there were people who did even noble acts that Draco couldn't even come close to but he didn't voice his thoughts.
Potter only sighed as he dropped in the chair beside Draco's. "I know, I know. Did you expect me to be dancing in ecstasy at the news of murder we just got?" He asked.
"Eyeliner." Pansy grins and puts her hand on her hips. "Now take off your glasses, Potter." That means she's serious, she calls me Harry otherwise.
"Have you asked Malfoy about this?" Harry finds it hard to believe that Malfoy would accept his help and let Harry see his vulnerable side.
Draco stepped out of the morgue, vanishing the bubble-head charm. It was probably 6 in the evening and the sun had set halfway. Hadn't Potter taken too long? Draco voiced his question to Kingsley who only shrugged in reply.
Draco walked towards where Kingsley was directing; a freezing white room. Draco entered and saw the two dead bodies laying on a stretcher. They were covered with white sheet so Draco couldn't see them. Draco wasn't unnerved by that, he was a Healer, he had seen dead bodies before, examined them even but the thought of how much damage was done to
"H-harry." I whisper and I see Potter's eyes fill with such joy that my own heart squeezes in my chest.
With a nod Harry disappirated to Kingsley's office, dreading the conversation he would be soon having.
Something weird had happened to him, his throat had closed up and his vision had blurred but he hadn't heard voices or felt the sharp pain in his whole body like before.
at Potter. It was clear Potter wasn't interested, Draco was pretty sure that when the guy still continued his staring, it was counted as harassing.
"I'll be off now." Potter stands up and I am about to shake Draco, tell him to atleast say 'goodbye, Potter' or just tell Potter how much he likes him but before I can say anything he looks up.
"By the way, could you inform Kingsley that I'm safe? Tell him I was very tired, hadn't slept since last night so I apparated back home. Say that I'll give him the report tomorrow. And if you mention the passing out part-" Harry let the threat hang in the air.
"I am so sorry, Draco. I would never harm you. You are a great person now. You haven't done anything wrong." Harry said softly. Malfoy's shaking lessened but his tears and sobs didn't stop.
"I need to talk to you, Mother. Perhaps we could during dinner?" Draco asked, hoping to treat his hunger.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle at her reply, it was such a badass way to convince a stubborn git like Malfoy.
"Fine, go ahead." I said as I moved my left arm infront of Potter. Pansy and Blaise come to stand on either side of me.
His tone was different than usual so Harry turned to look at him. He was surprised to see a rusty colour on his cheeks. Ron's previous remark must've embarrassed him. Little does he know; Ron can sometimes be even denser than Harry sometimes.
I wait for him to do something but all he does is stare. Then he sighs, a tired sigh, and reaches his hand forward. I grab my wand, waiting to hex him the minute he harms my best friend but all Potter does is remove Draco's blonde hair tenderly away from his forehead. I watch, frozen and transfixed in horror, as Potter runs his fingers along Draco's cheekbone, his eyelids, his jaw. His fingers inch towards Dray's lips but he shakes his head and stops himself from touching them.
Harry, having observed this whole scene wonders why not Narcissa had treated Dobby this way. He could ask her but that would be impolite and he was really curious as to why Mrs. Malfoy had come to talk to him.
Draco took a deep breath and exhaled softly as he clutched his head in the Auror bathroom. He kept the book aside and splashed some cold water on his face.
"Potter, try to slow your breathing, okay?" He said but it seemed as if Potter couldn't hear him. Draco placed his hand on Potter's shoulder and instantly pulled it back; Potter was practically burning. Now Draco started to panic. This didn't look right at all.
"I request you to kindly not make a scene at the ceremony. You are now on a higher post among the aurors, it will not put out a good impression if you act aggressively."
I stand by the drinks table and grab a cup of butterbeer. Pansy isn't anywhere near but she'll probably be here soon. The party is at Pansy's house. There are too many people, some drinking, some dancing and some just talking. Due to the lights, everything looks blue. I recognize a few Slytherins from our school year but I don't see anyone I know.
. Anything ranging from stupid and useless facts to some of the most important things the world has seen.
Harry knew that whenever Draco was angry, he didn't want anyone to come near for a while so Harry went in the kitchen instead, looking for a potion to cure his headache.
Taking a deep breath, Draco knocked on Harry's door. The door swung open immediately, as though Harry was waiting for Draco on the other side, there goes Draco's wishful thinking again.
There was. Draco didn't want to admit it because it was such a small and insignificant issue compared to all his other problems but it was bothering him to no end.
"Sure." Draco dropped the bottle in Kingsley's outstretched palm. He wanted to go home, eat and sleep in his soft, warm bed. The thought of home reminded Draco of how worried Mother had been when he had left and his desire to apparate back at the Manor increased.
"Ask him yourself, Mr. Malfoy. Harry has a strange interest in ranting against the Minister. He can do it for hours." Kingsley shook his head and Draco knew he was being asked to leave.
"I thought you'd be more excited than that to know that we might get somewhere with this case." Malfoy spoke flatly, the ecstatic emotion no longer on his face. It was better. At least Harry could look him in the eye now.
"Mal-Healer Malfoy, do come in." Harry nodded at him. Kingsley had given him a whole lecture to remain professional with Malfoy, to which Harry had muttered a dejected "I'll try."
"Oh..umm..well.. he kinda had a panic attack and I comforted him so we just.. ummm.." Harry had no idea how to continue.
"Potter, I know there's something you aren't telling me. I promise you, this time I'll try to do the right thing. This time, you are there to stop me if I don't." Malfoy's words surprised Harry and if his surprised expression was any indication, he was too.
Harry knew what those words meant, knew who they were coming from, anyone could tell, but that was impossible, wasn't it? He was dead; Voldemort was dead. He couldn't come back, no. He was buried deep under the black sea, his body probably in pieces. But here he was, even in death he was haunting Harry.
Then he had given Draco that grin; the all-too-wide-split-your-face-into-two grin. And Draco couldn't resist poking some fun back at him. He would one-up Potter and have the last word.
Harry was starting to feel like he had over-reacted but he wanted to clear up a few things with Malfoy.
He expects Potter to laugh at him or make fun of him but he merely nods and says "I see." He looks thoughtful for a while. Draco looks questioningly at his Mother who look as confused as him. A loud crack breaks the silent atmosphere.
Mippey nodded in reply and started speaking in a hushed tone, "Master Malfoy, Mippey is being worried about the Mistress. Mistress only sits in the living room and she is staring at the box. If Mippey asks her anything she orders Mippey away! Mippey saw her crying one time also, Master Malfoy. Mippey is being so worried-"
Draco was stunned at Kingsley's little speech. Life was too short already, why would they want to waste it for the Wizarding World? The same Wizarding World who doesn't give a single fuck about them? None of them would sacrifice themselves for the Aurors. Then why would they do that? It didn't make any sense to Draco.
"Potter?" Harry registered Malfoy entering the dimly lit office and sitting in his usual chair. "Care to explain what just happened?"
"Yes, Harry. Do take a seat." Kingsley nodded to the two armchairs in front of his desk. Harry obeyed the command and waited for Shacklebolt to state the purpose of calling him here.
Draco closes his mouth, feeling himself go red. He doesn't meet Potter's eyes as he greets him or enters Potter's house or sits in his living room.
"The case of course. Whoever is doing this isn't an ordinary wizard." Potter's words sent a chill down Draco's spine. "We'll be fine, though. Can't be worse than good old Voldy, can he?" Draco absolutely did not understand how Potter could take the situation so lightly or speak about the Dark Lord this way.
Harry saw recognition glimmer in the man's eyes as he limped closer, saw his eyes dart to Harry's forehead like it almost always did with new people he met. Harry ignored it all, it wasn't what he was here for.
Of course. Potter would talk to my Dark Mark. I knew he could speak Parseltongue, everyone knew, but him talking to my Mark? That made me feel anxious for some reason.
"You're so beautiful." Draco heard Harry whisper the words softly and even though he hated being called pretty or beautiful (he preferred handsome) but hearing the words from Harry's mouth wasn't something Draco disliked at all, it was quite the opposite to tell the truth. Draco was hyper-aware of his red ears and cheecks and he knew Harry could see his blush too.
"Whatever. Anyways, Hermione should be free by now. I swear she is turning Shacklebolt into a workaholic like her." Ron rolls his eyes.
Harry nodded and agreed but he could feel a heaviness in his actions, a weight in his chest, a dark shadow looming over him.
Potter kept pulling and the pain was so much. I felt faint, my head was spinning. It was worse than any Crucio I had ever experienced and then my eyes closed and I fell into oblivion.
How dare Malfoy suggest such a thing? Who did he think the Aurors were? Yes, a lot of them had died while serving the right cause but that didn't mean they would willingly sacrifice their soldiers for such a simple cause as testing a potion. Most of them (mainly Harry himself) were pretty reckless and served on adrenaline but they weren't suicidal. Harry wouldn't let anyone believe or state otherwise (which many people did).
Potter suddenly opened his eyes and traced my Mark with the index finger of his other hand. The movement was so soft and feather-like that it sent shivers down my spine.
Harry strode with resolve into St. Mungo’s. The hospital was bustling with witches and wizards as always. A man with an elephant trunk in the place of his nose, a witch with green skin, a child with boils all over his face, all kinds of men, women and children whom Harry paid no notice.
"So today I want you to try and use your magic more, have you been practicing at home?" Potter stares at him with his big green eyes.
"Give me your hand." Pansy takes out something, probably a bracelet, from practically nowhere with lots of little chains, bands and spikes, sliding it on my outstretched wrist.
"Yes, Potter. I am quite sure I have read this book and it does not have any information we need." Draco was pretty sure coming to the library with Potter was a bad idea because the got wouldn't stop talking.
Will nodded, "Yeah. I'll be pleased to go with you." He gave Potter a small smile and Draco's stomach tightened when Potter smiled back. It wasn't even one of his fake smiles, no it was a full-on genuine smile that had Draco's blood boiling for not being directed at him.
Thank you to everyone who left kudos! Please comment what you think, I'd be very grateful. I couldn't wait to post chapter 2 so here it is!!
"Of course." She just nodded instead of pestering Harry about his health. “I will send it to Robards.”
Harry was taken aback by the spark of honesty and sorrow that appeared in Malfoy's eyes. It was so unlike him that Harry couldn't help but stare.
"I am sorry Mrs. Malfoy. I was just thinking. Anyways....uh...so as to why you are here?" Harry internally cringed at how impolite he sounded.
I feel my cheeks redden at her words. She notices and pinches my cheeks, something she knows I hate.
Malfoy put his hand in Harry's. His skin was warm and soft, so unlike Harry's which was rough and callous. For a moment all Harry could do was stare at the contrast of their hands. Caramel and pale skin, it looked like the most magical thing he had ever seen. Harry's heart squeezed in his chest. He forced his eyes to look up and found Malfoy staring at their hands too, his breathing a little rough.
He searched the list of potion ingredients carefully; sandalwood, salamander, occamies, skrewts, lead, marble, jewels.
"And what was all that about the Minister?" Draco asked, he knew who the Minister was; Johan Hertzoon, but he had thought that the man became the Minister because he was voted by the Wizengamot.
"Coffee? You do know that too much caffeine can be harmful, right? Is that all you have for breakfast everyday? How do you stay that ripped without eating?" Draco spoke without filter and as soon he realized what he said, his eyes widened and he turned an embarrassing shade of puce. Why was he having these slips in front of Potter, of all people?
Harry looked around his office, taking in the place he had spent so many sleepless nights in, solving case after case. Most of them had been challenging but Harry, along with his team had got to the bottom of each and every one of them.
I look around, trying to find Pansy. I see Blaise who notices me and comes over. I'm not friends with him, we're acquaintances, you could say. I asked Ron and Hermione if they wanted to come but they had promised their kids to take them for a picnic or something so they couldn't.
Afraid someone might've heard him, Draco turns, wiping his eyes with the sleeves of his nightgown but all he sees is an owl outside his window, a letter tied to its leg. Who would send him a letter at this time of the night? A horrible thought worms its way into his mind. Was it sent by Father? Did he somehow know Draco was thinking of him? Thinking badly of him? Draco almost ignores the owl but curiousity gets the better of him and he moves towards the window. Even if it was from Father, he can't harm Draco can he? He is in Azkaban, a thousand miles away. With this thought in mind Draco unties the letter from the owl's leg, ruffles its feathers and sits on his bed. Taking a deep breath, he opens the letter and reads it.
"I am very proud of the progress you've made and the way you both have cooperated together despite the dark past you've had. I know what you think of this Ball, Harry but you have to attend it." Kingsley continued and Harry exhaled through his nose. Of course this was about that stupid ball, of course it was.
"So I'll have to wait until he kills a few bad guys and makes a dramatic entrance?" Draco drawled. He had a job which he
He had been noticing that his Mother seemed happier now, much more carefree. Due to the vacation he had taken from work, he had been able to spend some time with his Mother; a talk in the garden about the flowerbeds, the peacocks, wizarding politics, all neutral topics. Draco felt at ease too, it had been a long time since he had spent a while in his mother's calming company.
"This isn't about me. You-" Whatever Malfoy was about to say was lost as the door of Harry's office banged open to reveal Ron.
Draco cut her rant of with an upheld palm. "I will talk to her, Mippey." He nodded and moved towards the living room.
He had managed to send red sparks in the air but before he could stun the man, he had already disapparated. Smith had come running in, asking Harry what had happened but Harry couldn't reply.
Draco took a deep breath before knocking. He had contemplated sending a letter to Potter in reply but in the end had decided not to. After all, he was disrespected and would choose whether or not to return. Draco had told Blaise and Pansy about everything that had happened but not Mother. He was afraid she would somehow see how upset Potter's actions had made him, (she had always been good at reading his emotions) and then she'll figure out about his crush on Potter, which probably wouldn't be good news for Draco.
Dolohov looked up at him then, his eyes blazing with a mingled fear and anger. The sweeper slammed his hand down on the table between them, standing up from his seat.
"But why in Salazar's name would you do that?" Draco asked, forgetting who was sitting infront of him for a second.
Draco sighs. "Fine. Enter my mind." He says finally. He tries to perform the little Occlumency he had learnt from Aunt Bella, trying to keep Potter out of the embarrassing and shameful parts of his mind.
He saw his Mother's eyes soften at his words as she placed her hand on top of his. "I love you, Draco, but you know that I loved him too. It is hard for me to forget about him."
"Yeah, I’ll get going." Harry stood up, waving his wand to arrange the disorderly mess of files and quills on his table.
"Auror Potter should be here any minute. I notified him already." Kingsley spoke again from his position beside the huge mahogany table. Draco had no idea what to say to Kingsley's statement so he only nodded.
"Mr. P- I mean Harry?" Narcissa cuts the train of his thoughts. He looked at her, now seated on Harry's living room sofa.
"Okay just give it another try. Think of a more happy memory, something that was the best thing in your life." Harry says.
I shuffle back and Pansy steps through. She's already dressed, wearing a blood red dress that goes to her knees. It is a type of corset at the top and flares down at the bottom. She's wearing a matching lipstick and something on her eyes too. Only someone like Pansy can pull that off.
"Ughh. Just shut up, Draco." Pansy rolled her eyes as we reached the drinks table. There were alot of red cups, some filled with butterbeer, some with firewhisky and others with some muggle drinks I had seen Pansy drink.
"Robards didn't assign me this case, Kingsley did. And I'm not alone. I have to work with-" Harry muttered something incomprehensible, hoping Ron would just let it go. But of course he didn't, it was
Potter's brows furrowed in confusion at Draco's hostile tone. Draco knew his behaviour wasn't making any sense and was entirely uncalled for. The raven-haired auror had done nothing wrong. If Draco was too chicken to tell the guy about his feelings, it was entirely his own fault but Draco was absolutely not about to accept that.
Draco's Mother had asked him what had happened and Draco had told her it was just a little panic attack caused by resurfacing memories. Mother hadn't pried and called the house elf for tea.
"I am perfectly capable to fight you if you were to attack me, which I am pretty sure you won't do. So now can we get going? I need to get to work."
"Well, it's a neutral topic. Would you rather I asked why you joined the Death Eaters?" Harry shrugged.
"Then the pain increased and the words started to make sense. Blood, kill, revenge. The last words I heard before passing out was my name; Harry Potter. Dead."
Malfoy sighed miserably then spoke, "They just aren't too fond of me. To be honest, I don't really blame them. I've hardly forgiven myself for all the things I've done."
Then Potter put the tip of his wand directly in the middle of the skull and said something in Parseltongue again. The snake was now writhing, trying to reach Potter but either it wasn't that long or Potter's wand was doing something to it. I felt a discomfort in my arm but it wasn't very painful. Potter's one hand that was still gripping my wrist loosened a little and without looking up he muttered lowly, "Don't move your arm." I nodded even though Potter couldn't see it.
He shouted everyone's names but no one even looked in his direction. He tried to run forward instead but his feet wouldn't obey him.
Kingsley sat back in his chair and spoke, "I do remember that you are a healer, Mr. Malfoy, an incredible one at that and to answer your question, no, you will not have to come everyday. You must have remembered that you will have to be working alongside a partner?"
"You should know not to shout in the library, Mr. Potter." The man said in a croaky but stern voice.
"So.. how's your arm now?" Potter smiled and I would've frozen all over again had it not been for the liquid courage I had gotten.
"He can't perform even the simplest of spells. He used the wand you defeated the Dark Lord with, so I thought that is why he couldn't perform magic but with a new wand, he couldn't do magic at all."
Draco was aware he shouldn't be focusing on these things, his attention should be on who was trying to kill the guy instead, but Draco couldn't help it.
"But, Draco, my child, you already have a job. A great one too. You don't need anymore favour from the Ministry." Draco knew that his Mother would pursue this topic for a long time but he didn't want to argue with her, besides there was something else to be addressed.
"Did you know about magical cores?" He asks. It had surprised him when Potter had told him in detail about his core. How it was cool and collected. How it would freeze when Draco would feel extreme emotions. He also told Draco about how his own magic was warm and Draco's stupid, girly side was giddy about how well of a match they were.
Draco sighed, why were Aurors so thick-headed? "It is a paste which was around the bigger wounds. I had thought it was rotten flesh but it wasn't. There are little pieces of glittering stones in there but I'm not sure what they are. I'll have to examine this."
Harry muttered, "What would you be disturbing?" Malfoy had leaned back by now to maintain a respectable amount of distance between them. Harry missed their close proximity.
"I wish you the best, Mr. Malfoy. You are a great asset for us in this demanding case." Kingsley nodded at him with such honesty in his eyes that, for a moment, Draco was dumbfounded.
My heart drops. What if she cancelled the party? Or thought I wasn't worthy enough for Draco? Or maybe Draco didn't like me back and she was just mistaken. I take a deep breath and let the owl in. The letter was short, all it said was "Check your floo, Pansy."
"So, Dolohov, why were you released early from your punishment in Azkaban?" Harry asked. He had thought long and hard about this; why the Death Eater was removed from prison 6 months before his actual release was due.
"What? Mother NO! I will not go to Potter of all people for help. I am mortified as it is!" Draco shouts his face red as a tomato.
He glances at Mother, who is observing the scene unfold with a crease between her eyebrows. Draco was taller than Potter at school but not anymore. Now Potter has more muscle mass on him. While Draco is lean but not extremely slim, Potter is muscular but not extremely bulky. It is a good combination, Draco's mind supplies. Draco blushes at his train of thoughts then looks up at Potter through his lashes.
He saw a tiny bit of fear creep in Malfoy's eyes. Good. He wanted him to know that it wouldn't do him any good to disrespect him or his job.
"I need to check on something. Stay here until Auror Potter comes." Kingsley said and left the office, leaving Draco alone with his dark thoughts.
Black spots danced around the edges as the dark and murky street transformed into a scene from a smudgy oil painting. Harry felt his hands shake as his breathing became shallow, afraid he'd give himself away, he clapped a shaking hand on his mouth, trying to muffle the sound of his laboured breathing. Harry did not have a bloody clue as to what was happening to him but he knew his auror team would be right behind him, he knew they'd soon come.
And then all the stares I caught him giving Draco while he wasn't watching, the soft and tender way he held Dray's wrist, the way he realized that Draco was scared and then reassured him, all those things start to make sense as I realise that Potter likes Draco.
"Hey, don't lose hope right now. That was a very good..er- try." Harry says getting a sarcastic snort from Draco in return.
I am caught off-guard by how much sadness and tiredness comes over Potter's face. I turn to look at Blaise who is as surprised as me.
I suddenly felt a discomfort in my arm. I looked down from Potter's face and my eyes widened. The snake was
A beautiful silver leopard galloped through the halls, its movement ceasing in front of Kingsley who held a hand out to stop Draco from walking.
Harry sighed. Casting a Reparo on the shards of teacup, he cleaned the mess of parchment and ink he had made too.
It was a dull emerald green but as Draco moved his lit wand around it, little green pieces glittered in the shining light. It was as if crushed emeralds were added in a slimy green paste and applied around the wounds. Or it was what had caused the injuries in the first place.
"Malfoy- Malfoy it's okay, I-" but the use of 'Malfoy' had brought more fear in his eyes. So Harry tried again.
Malfoy frowned for a long time after that, his unseeing gaze directed at the file opened in front of him and his fingers rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
"Don't open your eyes. Focus, Malfoy, focus." He hears Potter say but he sounds so far away. Whatever Potter has cast is making him feel more relaxed, like taking a walk in a garden, a beautiful green garden. Draco tries to feel his magic but he has no idea what magic even feels like. He takes a deep breath and exhales slowly, all the while chanting "come to me. Please. Come to me." Suddenly he feels something cool hit him right where his wand is pointed, on his heart. It is like someone splashed cold water right on top of it. With a gasp he opens his eyes and removes his wand from his chest with a jerk, the feeling instantly vanishing. He looks at Potter with wide eyes, breathing hard.
Draco didn't push Harry away, even though he was undoubtedly very mad at Harry. He probably needed the comfort only Harry could give him. Draco sobbed loudly, his tears were wetting Harry's shirt but Harry didn't care. All he wanted right now was for Draco to stop crying.
Thank you for your comments and kudos! Here is Chapter 4. Next Chapter will be up next week. I have a lot planned for it and am super excited to post it!
He saw Malfoy flinch at his words, "I apologise for all of those insults and the effects they might have, no must have, caused on you and your friends. I also believe that we have matured enough at this point to work together without hexing each other's bollocks off."
Harry hadn't seen Malfoy working with the red potion; Malfoy had said it was harder to determine its effects than the paste's so he wanted to crack its mystery first. Harry glanced up at the blonde then; over the course of the few weeks they had worked together, Harry had observed how Malfoy had changed since Hogwarts, both physically and personality wise too.
Harry didn't know why but he had found himself observing Malfoy more and more. Then he had seen the rusty colour spread on Malfoy's pale cheeks just because of a simple innuendo he had made or a little smirk he had given. Harry had found it amusing to continue to make Malfoy flustered, considering it was a rare sight, so he had continued the acts.
Draco shook his head, bringing himself out of his thoughts. He needed to focus on this case. He grabbed another book, Potions in the Past, and searched for the section on jewels.
Potter was leaning on the table, twirling the knife retrieved from the dark house in his hands. He looked up when Draco entered.
"Something you would like to say, Mippey?" He asked with a sigh. Draco was too tired and famished for this.
In one there is a red haired witch and a man who looks like a carbon copy of Potter, probably his parents. In the other there is the Weasel, Granger and Potter. One has all of the Weasleys and Potter. One with Longbottom, Thomas and the other Gryffindor Potter hung out with. There are many photos of Potter with his classmates, Potter in Hogwarts along with newspaper cuttings, letters and even a few badges.
"What would you young men like?" The waiter who had given them the menu asked, his hands clasped in front of him.
Draco scowled; he was working his hardest to figure out both the potions but it wasn't his fault it was so damn difficult. "No but I'm trying my best." Draco glared at Potter who lifted his hands in an innocent gesture.
"Let's just focus on the main reason of us being stuck together; the case. We need to solve it and I'd rather do it without you rambling over my head."
I still remember how much of a torture it was when I had gotten the Dark Mark. I don't think I could bare that pain again.
"Oh, I don't give a single fuck about that bastard, Kingsley. You and I both know he doesn't deserve the position he holds." To say Draco was shocked at Potter's words was an understatement. Potter was talking that way about the
"Trying to impress someone?" My mirror asked in that quirky voice of hers. I had always hated her snide remarks but today they won't affect me. I flashed her a charming grin in reply.
Kingsley chuckled, "I can't guarantee you that you won't have any injuries but I can assure you that you won't die. Auror P- our most capable Auror would always put your life above his own."
