“I know, okay?!” Draco breathes out an inaudible sigh. He takes Harry’s hands, urging him back to the couch. “I’m tired, too. But I’m happy with you. I don’t want to lose that. I know I can make you happy, too.”
Harry thought it was wisest not to look a gift Thestral in the mouth as he rarely stocked Hangover Potion and there weren't any apothecaries open on New Year’s Day. After a surreptitious sniff, he drank it in one go. The potion burned like spellfire from head to toe, but once that was over Harry was left remarkably clear-headed.
Harry.
"Not sure I’d leave my Gran there if it looked like this," Harry quipped. But the house had been a cocoon from the world when he needed it.
His tone is full of mirth and something else that Draco can’t—won’t—identify. Pinned to the spot because of the green eyes, he lets a sappy smile draw his lips up.
“Is that…?”
The summer after the war, when Harry lived in it, Grimmauld Place seemed safe. During the day, he was always with Ron and Hermione at trials, memorials, funerals and rebuilding projects. All three of them wept a lot. At night, they drank in a passive, idle way. Most of the time it was a case of beer to the three of them. Sometimes it was sangria, which Harry thought might have been Hermione’s half-hearted attempt to prevent them from contracting scurvy.
"Harry James Potter, to whom I owe my life, what is it you wish of me?" Draco asked. His voice was smooth and lower than usual.
"Ah, I forgot. Why would you be familiar with that nonsense? Pure-blood families used to run a legal notice in the paper if someone was officially disowned. It doesn’t go so far as to deny you the use of your name, but it stops you from accessing vaults, using family accounts at shops, or visiting their property. Most families, even in my day, handled it more privately. Like with the Parkinson girl."
When Harry turns around, though, he’s met with the sight of Draco down on one knee.
When he told Draco this, he laughed. "Astoria likes you, that's for certain. She's asked me about Quidditch. Don’t be surprised if she shows up to the Cup."
"A marital aid," Draco drawled.
“Benefits such as?” she asks.
Min-woo caught the Snitch in thirty. Harry was the first to pick him up onto his shoulder. He did not care whether the media was going to call him out again for being too boisterous. He didn't care if it was gloating. He patted Oliver on the back. He gave Atty a warm hug as tears streamed down her face.
But Harry suspected he wouldn’t have been as honest as he had been with Draco with a complete stranger. He wouldn’t have been as nasty either, and especially not about something as inconsequential as food. He would have felt he was entirely in the right if they had come across some Dark artefact, and Draco had said "you must see the merits of keeping and using it on innocent Muggles", and Harry had said "it’s wrong and I knew you were up to something."
Draco doesn’t remember filling the documents certifying Elle’s death. He knows he did it; he remembers Healer Cameron’s comforting words by his side as he mechanically signed the papers. Draco doesn’t remember when the other Healers came in and took Elle’s body from the bed. He can’t remember the path back to his office or how he walked there when his legs are wobbly and weakened by the same loss threatening to grow inside him.
"Look at me," Harry told her, making sure to tilt her head up to face him. "You are not responsible for what any other player does. Not Fleming, and not me, you understand?"
"You use a lot of magic when you cast," Draco observed. Colour was high in his cheeks, and his breath seemed a little shaky. He was flustered if Harry wasn’t mistaken.
And when he brings Harry to visit with him, he
better, he is something new, in grand part because he had Harry by his side.
"Why?"
“Why do you have so many books on Celtic magic?” Granger wonders, sipping from a cup of tea she had resting by her feet. It’s her third cup, and Harry has joined her for all of them.
I met Hermione and Ron over there. Despite not seeing you, your presence was relaxing. You only showed up when I was about to bolt, and I wasn’t sure if you noticed my trembling hands or just had a knack for good timing.
Teddy didn’t quite understand the meaning of Draco's words, and they sounded like just one more of Draco's million secrets. But he liked the cadence of Draco's voice when he said it, and how warm the words felt. He imagined it was what being alive felt like. Like being on fire but without burning.
Blaise glances at him warily, brow raised. “Are you okay?”
up to have him back by his side. They can’t take this away from him now. They can’t take Harry from him again.
Being alone is easier, but it’s almost suffocating most of the time.
Someone who didn’t like Draco very much, someone who wanted to take Harry away from them.
"Can I see your flat?" Harry asked abruptly one morning.
“I’m assuming you’re Julie,” Harry interrupts, voice small, but a huge grin on his lips, before Draco has to find the words to explain the situation. “From Draco’s stories.”
"He’s really the only person who can help you with this, don’t mess around with him." Hermione was furrowing her brow.
"You asked someone to marry you when you were thirteen?" Miles asked. "Was that a threat?"
“Marvin would love to see you again,” she continues, when Draco says nothing.
“Minutes. If everything runs smoothly, it’ll be fast and painless.”
"Yes, Blaise. I would like to report a theft."
“The Room of Requirement?” Harry asks, his hand stilling on Draco’s neck.
So he had always been careful about what he did and how he did it. Harry didn't care that much about his own reputation, but there were things he had left to do to make the sport more decent than he'd found it and that relied on being in relatively good standing.
Harry grins, pulls the arm Draco has around his waist and licks a stripe up the skin from his wrist to the inside of his elbow. “They’re called distressed jeans, and they’re cool. Luna thinks so.”
Harry hopped on his broom and, with his hands behind his back, did a slow, neat backflip in a tight, perfect circle. "That is more difficult than doing it at speed. If any of you can do that, you can skip the drill."
Harry pulls back, breaking the contact between them. “Aren’t you worried I might go into a coma again?”
“Well,” Blaise begins, shaking away his alarm. “Remember when Theo ran from Snape second year and got lost in the Forbidden Forest? He was always saying the tree helped him. Now we know his tales were true.” He snorts, adding, “I’ve always believed him, obviously.”
Draco tries to prise Harry off the bed to eat something, but he drops into a serene sleep and doesn't wake again until the next morning. This time, when Draco opens his eyes, he’s met with two bright green eyes staring at him.
It was over all too soon as Draco tensed and released, flooding Harry's senses and his mouth. Draco slumped back.
Harry assumed that Pansy had a serious falling out because she never spoke of them and Christmas at the Weasleys was two years ago, but he wasn't looped in enough to know if she'd been disowned wholesale, privately or otherwise. He frowned.
And Draco can relate to that. He is uncomfortable with the amount of pity cast in his direction whenever he goes out. He stopped frequenting magical parts of London, relenting to walk his own neighbourhood.
Draco recoils to his side of the couch, trying to keep the lump in his throat from making him choke. He isn’t even sure what’s the right answer, if there is one. “I’m sorry. I... I thought you wouldn’t believe me. That you would resent me. I was a coward.” Still is. He’d have found reason to keep it for longer, if it was not for Pansy. And to be fair, Draco doesn't think he would believe himself.
It troubled me a dreadful lot.
Draco can’t breathe, can’t think, can’t move. He can’t hear anything besides the buzzing in his ears. The walls are closing in. The world becomes smaller, narrowing itself to the pain in his chest, and it becomes the only thing that makes sense. He tries to cry. Maybe he
"You don’t like public events or most of it, do you?" Draco asked, as if the thought just occurred to him. He probably still thought Harry enjoyed the attention.
Harry doesn’t seem to mind doing all the work, as he peppers Draco’s neck with kisses and small bites. The scowl etched on Harry's face slowly fades into relief, then arousal.
Draco swallows and looks too. This is the Harry who’s been more alive than ever since he woke up from the coma. The Harry who tried to get to know the man Draco had become, even though he had no reason to. The Harry that learned to love him for who he is. Draco loves this Harry.
"She wants to come here for Christmas?" Molly looked around as if she was expecting something other than the haphazard messiness of the Burrow.
"It’s in the tin on the side." Draco slathered on a thick layer. Harry sliced a much thinner piece and scraped on the icing.
, Harry repeated in his head.
. Your skin, darker tonight, turned a shade redder, cheeks burning and lips moist.
"Blake?" He addressed Atty, but he would have preferred not to.
Harry’s presence fills his small flat with warmth, and Draco can’t help but close a bit of the distance between them, when Harry’s eyes catch his.
"Falcons always…"
It’s subtle, at first, as the mist vanishes. Pillars tower up slowly, the pale tracks of an abandoned station draw a path on the newly tiled floor. Draco looks up to find a blurred plaque. He recognises it instantly, even if he can’t read the muddled numbers yet.
"Er…yes?"
“Right. Yes, well,” Draco collects himself, schooling his features into something more serious, and rests her file on the bedside table. “Let’s start. Did you take your potions this morning?”
Draco was polite enough to leave him alone in the kitchen.
is not good enough for him.
Healer Cameron, much like Pansy, didn’t like his programme for Elle’s treatment plan and had barred it at first. When Elle was ultimately bedridden and became a permanent resident of St Mungo’s, about three weeks after the initial development of his plan, she had to concede it was the best course of action, even as Draco ran every possible scenario where things could go wrong by her. There
"No problem." Padma waved a hand dismissing his apology. "But would you mind meeting someone for me? My boss is here, and he’s such a big Falcons fan."
It has to be, although it looks like it’s from one of Harry’s art books.
“What glass?”
conversation. But first, he stopped to greet a timid, balding middle-aged man in black robes.
He’s shaking slightly as he approaches the old building. Draco’s now used to its tacky pillars rising to the ceiling and the too bright yellow facade, though he had hated it the first time he stepped into the place. The blinding yellow has become a welcoming balm against his eyes, now contrasting with the heavily clouded sky.
Draco shrugs. “Redecorating.”
The day passes by blissfully with no further problems, and Draco can’t shake the grin Teddy’s letter has put in his face until he enters the room where’s supposed to examine Elle Carrey for the day.
"You never answered me at the party," Harry said. He couldn’t say why he was interested, just that he was. After all, their generation was small and, unless you married early, there was less than two degrees of separation between Harry and every other wizard in the UK.
"Water," Draco said, and, before Harry could Summon glasses from the kitchen, the house supplied them.
Draco paused for a long moment and took a sip of water. "Definitely related. Theo is my ex. We’re still friends, but that’ll always be there."
Draco shakes away the shiver, the horrible thought lurking inside his mind that maybe Harry’s right and this is... this will be the end of them.
Harry paused, still thinking about the scene in the doorway.
—described as the delayed return of spontaneous circulation after death—for months, trying to create the perfect circumstances for them to reproduce it with no casualties—namely Draco. Draco's research showed that the effect was like a tsunami right after an earthquake, however, the only thing he feels is as if a wave of magic has washed over him, pleasant and safe. That magic, along with Pansy's efforts, brought him back to life.
again.”
Harry needs his help now. He trusts Draco like this. He is giving something to Draco he hasn’t even realised yet. And Draco will hold it, cherish it next to his heart. Harry doesn’t need this mess of a man he’s become because of a name. Draco shouldn’t be happy about it with the way Harry is, spilling out anxious energy and magic, but he can’t really help himself.
They ended up in the private dining room of a place called Cloaks in the Muggle part of Camden around ten-thirty. Harry thought it was rather stupid to name a restaurant the way you would name a tailor, but no one had asked him. It was decorated to look like someone’s parlour, with shelves of old Muggle books, antique clocks, and soft blue willow patterned carpet underfoot. Instead of bar stools, their room was filled with an array of velvet armchairs with a low, polished marble table with space for a dozen. Harry hated pretentious rubbish like that. Draco probably loved it.
Potter deserves anything he wants. He dedicated himself to defeating evil, when all Draco did was follow said evil, hurt people, and cry in dark bathrooms.
Harry was mildly amused as Hermione continued on this topic for several long minutes. He knew she depended on other people for her work: activists, her colleagues at the Independent Commission on Justice, the more progressive members of the Wizengamot. But she was tireless about legal reform, and she wouldn’t stop with a few reports and expert roundtables. He was proud of her and told her as much.
“I’m running out of clothes,” Harry says one lazy morning, which grants him a smirk from Draco.
Draco spent the last few days researching many of the same old tomes in Celtic magic and bonding he used when looking for a counter-curse for Harry, and the last hour explaining to Pansy how he thinks he can cure Elle. He’d got the idea from Harry, from their own bond. It’s not the same, but if Draco can only get Elle’s magic to stay bound to something, like the Malfoy magic used to be bonded to the C
Greg was much more quiet than he had ever been in school. He barely chuckled at any of their antics. He glanced at Harry once and then looked away. Draco went to the corner of the room to talk to Greg quietly and left Harry with the rest of them as the conversation swung to inside jokes or past events Harry didn’t know.
Harry--his childhood rival.
Blaise had given him a cigarette last night. And he'd bought Draco several more drinks. So many that the night blurred into a mix of fading light and whispered songs Draco didn’t know.
“No way, Harry, look at you and look at him,” Julie complains, pointing broadly at Draco and apparently ignoring the whole of Harry. “He’s a med student for God’s sake, and he
"She doesn’t have time for a survey!" a familiar voice called. Draco came into view over the top of Andromeda’s head.
"Well, we have lots of dessert," Ron muttered, walking away.
as if it’s the right thing to do. It is, but why does it feel like the beginning of his ending?
to see.
He doesn’t finish his sentence, and Draco wants to grab him by the shoulders and make sure Harry knows he still can do all those things. He can travel again, he can live again, he can fall in love again.
George backed down then, going silent. The rest of the meal they pivoted to talk about Charlie's sanctuary licensing, but Pansy's eyes were bright with unshed tears even as she nodded along.
“Don’t do that, the session is over,” Draco chides, wrinkling his nose, but Marvin is still staring at him like that. He sighs, shrugging. “He just reminds me of someone I know. I’m fine.”
Harry couldn't wait to tell his Mind Healer that he made the choice not to let the frustration bloom into something unmanageable. He took two deep huffs and flexed his feet in his loafers. His voice sounded almost normal when he said:
“How do you… Are you sure? I mean… Is this really what you want or—”
She drew her shoulders back and knit her brows together fiercely. "Gemma. Pardon me. These people, pure-bloods, they contribute very little in the way of social fabric. Very few work. They lost the war, and still everyone toasts them. Why is this? Explain."
He passed his gym and peered into the dining room, noting that Draco had found a way around the spells on the rest of the chest somehow because everything had been put on shelves. Up the stairs, Harry opened his door and frowned. He would have sworn his room was smaller. Waddling sideways between the bed and the wall type of small. Now it was larger, enough that he could have moved the piano beside the bed and still had room to swing a Kneazle. A new door revealed he now had the refurbished bathroom as his ensuite, clawfoot tub and all.
since the war?”
He inhales deeply, fingers softly patting the bird on the head. “You seem like a good owl.”
Why should he? Just because Potter saved the Wizarding World—potentially the rest of the world as well—doesn’t mean he’s entitled to anything that Draco isn’t.
So, Draco swallowed his heartbreak and devoted himself to the care and breeding of the Malfoy flock. He learned everything he could about the great Thoroughbred lines, memorized all the past champions and the names of their jockeys, accompanied his father on meetings with all the other breeders around Great Britain, and even began his certification as a race-thestral trainer. He was determined to know and dominate the industry from the inside out by his seventeenth birthday. To make his father proud.
“Tell me more about… your trips,” Draco asks, ignoring the question more because he can’t answer it the way Harry wishes, and not because he doesn’t know the answer.
“Leave,” says Krum. “This tent is for champions—and
The python slithers out of a corner, followed by the anaconda, hiding in a pot. The boa drops down from a roof support and Cedric shrieks.
“Give them to me now and I’ll do it,” Hermione sighs.
“No, he’s off delivering something,” Ron says, frowning at the damage. “What d’you want him for, anyway?”
Harry did not previously know that snakes could sigh.
“Come on in, then, there we go,” she says, ushering him inside and onto a cardboard box. She upturns a bucket to sit herself on before closing the door and plunging them into darkness.
They wheel around and shoot back towards their friends waiting for them on the lawns. Malfoy holds the snitch out as they land, and his team cheers.
“Ron!” she huffs. She reads over the parchment and smiles too, sticking a gold star on Neville’s collar before passing it on.
“Why do you think they’re uneducated?” Fred asks suddenly. She starts, gazing at him with wide eyes. “Did you know that house-elves are incredibly intelligent?” She shakes her head. “Okay, did you know that the way they use magic is completely different to wizards and witches?” She nods. “Right, well, maybe we should go and have a chat with them, eh?”
Draco sending little hand-drawn notes, the cranes Ron hates, fluttering into his hands. His smirks in the hallways that make Harry’s very being itch. The way the light gives him that look in his eye that Harry has noticed in every interaction since the beginning of term. His pristine uniform and fitted trousers, and the considering way Hermione’s been looking at Harry for weeks.
“Well, we have,” he tells her, tilting his head to indicate Fred. “Been down loads of times to nick food, so we’ve met them.”
Malfoy!”
“All right, Potter?” a recognisable somebody drawls behind him. “Cat got your fingers?”
Snake: No :)
Harry himself gets more homemade mince pies than he can eat and a wonderfully green jumper from Mrs Weasley, this one with a large picture of a dragon; Charlie’s already told her all about the horntail, then. His aunt and uncle send him a single tissue; an all-time low, and possibly punishment for Fred and George’s Ton-Tongue Toffee trick.
rather handsome, never mind what Ron says.
deigns to bugger off. They wait until his footsteps no longer echo.
Snake: That wasn’t—whatever
“What are they up to now?” Harry asks.
“Ginny? Oh, that sounds interesting.”
Harry walks around the edge of the stadium and back through the tunnel.
Beside Harry, the Weasley twins stand suddenly, each lobbing something straight up into the air. Two large sparks zip from their palms across the hall, leaving a trail of shifting colours as they arc and swirl, crack and spark and set off the occasional firework.
“Malfoy,” Ron mutters. “Really?”
Several other faces slip in and out of mind (Bill, the twins, Abbott, Goldstein, Greengrass) until, unbidden, a memory from last year resurfaces in vibrant defiance.
making him.
The Entrance Hall glows with the low-burning sconces. In the shadows of a far corner he spots Malfoy, fiddling with his shirt cuffs and pratting about with a few strands of his hair. Gone is the uniform, just like Harry, and he wears a thick black cloak with a tall collar clasped at his throat. He looks a bit like a gentler, more regal Snape.
I had planned to finish the book (as you do), but for JKR and motivation related reasons I have not. I hate that she's ruined something that has brought an awful lot of people so much joy, but I also despise how she decided it a good idea to use her very considerable platform to attack me and my friends and our loving, peaceful, worldwide community so blatantly. I hope all of you are well and looking after yourselves despite her atrocities and the state of the world right now <3
the custard creams we hexed!”
“Are you all right, Malfoy?” she asks sharply.
“Harry Potter is very welcome!” Dobby squeaks. “I have to go now, we is making Christmas dinner.” He disappears with a sharp pop, and Harry looks over to his friends and their presents.
Freckles: favouritism
Lavender giggles shrilly from somewhere near the middle of the class. Harry leans over to see Parvati shove her in the shoulder, face working to keep itself straight also. They both glance over at Harry, which McGonagall ignores. Typical.
“A puppy?” Ron frowns, handing over the cloak.
not die.”
“Sorry!” she yells. “Are you all right?”
Crookshanks: …
You: Sorry for being dramatic
“I’m sure the song’s ending soon,” Draco says. “If they’re all refusing to switch until then, then we won’t have to wait much longer.”
Harry shouts as they slither off.
“Weren’t you going to ask Cho?” Ginny asks.
“Oi, what’s all this about?” asks Fred.
Harry turns with Parvati around the floor at much the same pace as the others. She smiles and he manages to keep off her toes, and they take the lifts with an awkward fumbling even if they do manage to land them, in the end.
"Your wards. Since I don’t need you to start them," Draco said.
Draco misses Harry and his attempts to help with his indecisiveness, despite his terrible taste. He misses Ruby and her outrageous habit of peeing all over the house whenever either of them was gone for too long. He misses what they had so much that the pain wraps his heart and smothers it until it’s only dust.
, he wants to say, fingers gripping tightly at Harry's collar.
“That’s not true. But I still have to go.”
If their fingers brush when he passes the book, Draco does not scream. But he wants to, when the shadow of a touch
Harry looked up. "Apparently."
"I’m hungry," Teddy complained.
In thirty minutes, everyone was on the pitch. Harry circled the pitch slowly, not bothering with the Snitch. Luc Beauchamp and Milo Feuerbach leaned on their Beater’s bats and chattered away about the livestock on their farms. Oliver inspected the hoops. Stella and the left-wing Chaser, Sam Jagla, passed the Quaffle around, and when they tossed it to Rookie—Atty Blake had a name, Harry reminded himself—she fumbled it every single time. She must have been nervous because she had been exceptional at spring tryouts.
handsome. Artists don’t really have that luck in love.”
Draco’s spared from most of the public’s retaliation when Healer Cameron shoves him in her office to do some paperwork for the rest of the week. Although Draco’s grateful for that, he knows this won’t go away this fast.
it?” Harry repeats incredulously. “I love it. It’s the perfect house, Draco. It has everything. And it’s within our budget.”
“What?”
tracking down who fucking cut it). His glasses are different, oval and silver. He doesn’t dress like Draco’s Harry, rather now wearing a tight shirt accentuating his slim figure. He’s gained muscles since he woke up, Draco realises, wondering how much he works out every day to have filled out so fast.
"Oh yeah, he’s doing your place now, isn’t he? The house got done, as you can see," Seamus said breezy as anything, while he mixed more punch for the bowl.
And it
"What’s the correct wand movement and incantation?" Draco asked Teddy.
“But the tree.”
“Yeah, mate.” Ron tried to reach me, but he soon realised what he was doing and retracted his hands. “We’ve always known you’re different, it doesn’t change how we feel about you.”
“To this day, I haven’t paid that bet,” Draco confesses to him one day, startling a snort out of Harry. He had taken the infamous bet with Julie when Harry was still in the early stages of his art class. It hadn’t been something Draco was extremely comfortable doing, but he wasn’t one to back out from a challenge, even when Julie stated clearly he’d have to pose nude to an entire class to win that.
people. I can hear what they feel like. This sounds ridiculous.”
But they did, and Draco considers burying himself there until everyone forgets him, albeit unsure if that’ll ever happen. However, the certainty that Pansy will find him and lecture him again if Draco reverts to the first weeks of Harry’s recovery keeps him from reading these new articles in too much depth.
“I’ll let them know you needed to leave early.”
“Do I
“Is it okay?”
Who is he trying to fool, though? There’s something between them. Something that sends sparks down his spine whenever they touch, that makes his stomach flutter when Harry smiles at him. It’s not the bond, and it’s not Draco’s memories of their past.
"This okay?" Harry asked. He waited for Draco's nod before draping an arm across his lower back. Draco’s shoulders were tense, but when Harry drew his arm back, Draco whispered, "Leave it."
He only sees Harry when he’s in Elle's now private room, or the occasional stumble whenever the corridors are blessedly empty. Harry doesn’t say it with words, but Draco knows he’s avoiding other people. Draco tries not to get too caught up in the idea that Harry’s avoiding people seeing him
Harry thought back. It wasn't like he had plenty of spell casting intensive work since school, but he couldn't ever recall anything like that. Too physically exhausted to cast, sure.
Her condition is aggravated and fed by the sheer amount of power she has. The stronger Elle gets as she grows up, the stronger her curse becomes. Separating this kind of curse from her magical core is dangerous and could cost her magic, or worse, her own life. But living like this is proving to have a similar cost.
Harry shakes his head, but Draco doesn’t let him say anything.
The room is a wreck, chaos spiritedly roaming around. This is
. Draco politely finished breakfast and helped Harry do the washing up before asking, "So are you going to kiss me again or was that a mistake?"
He can’t look at her. She has so much to hope for, while all he can think of is the rage in Harry’s eyes when staring at him.
He’s still partially shocked by her reaction, and convinces himself it’s good to be left alone to sulk, when Mia returns with his usual black coffee and a large slice of lemon pie on the house.
When Healer Cameron’s horse Patronus barges inside his living room, Draco is almost so lost in thought and so drunk he thinks it’s his mind's playing tricks on him at first.
"I don’t know whether that counts as Muggle or Wizarding, so I’m going to decline to light up my drug tests and find out."
“Yes. Well. I don’t really know what she thinks. We haven’t talked since the war.”
Draco doesn’t have to be holding on to a sense of loyalty that shouldn’t exist anymore. He is divorced from a man who’s constantly in the papers with other men, from a man that hates him.
it. Not only by the way the bond screams something is missing, but by Harry himself. He’s distant. His presence is turning into a fading sensation, like small droplets of rain prickling on his skin. Harry’s usual wild and electric magic is a low hum now, just out of reach, whenever they’re not physically close to each other.
Angelina, talking to Alicia on the other side of the hearth, looks up. “What?”
“Of course. Blaise abandoned me, but Pansy isn’t so bad.”
says the boa.
“A Hungarian horntail, Chinese fireball, common green Welsh, and a Swedish short-snout?”
“We have three Seekers!”
“I can give you a few tips,” he insists. “I know a—”
Harry wakes up on Friday morning with a banging headache.
Crookshanks: Hermione Granger
“Er, yeah, of course,” Harry says. “I have one for you too, hold on.” It’s a complete lie, but he doesn’t think he could take Dobby’s kindness without giving something in return. He leans over the side of his bed and into his sock drawer, pulling out one of his least-used (and least holey) pairs of socks. “Sorry I forgot to wrap them,” he says.
“Hear hear.”
“Karkaroff gave me a three!” he tells Cedric happily.
Spinnet: of course it is
Lunch, the next event on the Hogwarts Christmas itinerary.
Harry nods.
Reads the message they spell.
“Also, Malfoy’s watching you.”
“The moment has finally come!” he announces. “A short explanation, before I bring in the casket, and the Triwizard Tournament can begin!”
Ronaldo: ok Bill n Charlie where r u
“Oh, look,” Malfoy says. “Give them here. It’s my turn tomorrow anyway, and Merlin knows you need your wits about you. Can’t have you murdered by a dragon after I put all that effort into helping you—people will begin to doubt my abilities.”
“I feel like we’re being ganged up on,” Malfoy says.
“Dance partners, Mr Potter. The champions and their dance partners traditionally open the ball. You shall be required to participate.”
“Oh,” Harry blinks, surprised. “Sorry, by all means, go ahead.”
“Why would I be in on this plot?” he asks, voice a few pitches too high. “Sounds like something I wouldn’t do. What’s the plot?”
“What?” he asks, and gestures to the other champions. “I thought we were doing a meet up.”
Blotches: not you mate
“No,” Hermione replies, frowning.
“How many times, Ron? You can’t apparate in or out of the Hogwarts grounds!”
Harry, Katie, Grant and Ginny are losing 80-50 (but Harry has caught the snitch thrice more than Cho has), when they hear a cry from below.
“I really won’t,” Draco insists.
The audience goes even wilder for Krum. Harry wonders if Ron’s as excited as he suspects he is.
“Oi!”
“It’s no good!” yells one of the handlers. “Stunning spells on three!”
“What about them?” Hermione asks.
“Good idea,” Harry agrees.
“Snakemaster General!”
“Just our class one. Mine was full of bad cartoons about Snape, though.”
Their professor gives them one of her looks before resettling herself and taking another breath. “Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age, I would like to talk to you all about the upcoming Yule Ball.” Several of their classmates visibly perk up at the mention. Harry decides that
Harry looks down. The python is disappearing off to investigate a chair. “Oh, yeah. I, um, need some help sending them back.”
Harry scowls at the ground. “Fine. Later. Let’s just get to class.”
Snake: Tragic
Ron and Hermione hand them some more money and send them off. It takes them just over a half-hour, in which time the remaining four hang around trying their damndest to look inconspicuous. Neville was quite smart to beg out, if being on the roped-in-friends end of breaking the rules is always this fraught.
You: Shit
Do they want us to croak it!?”
“Yes!” Harry breathes, wishing belatedly that he’d paid more attention. “There’s one for each of us. A Hungarian horntail, which has a horrible spikey tail, and the red one… A Chinese fireball. A um, common green Welsh dragon? And, um, it was silver and began with… Oh—Swedish snot-shout! No, wait, short-shout.
Karkaroff, sneer practically painted on, gives him a three.
At the arranged time, Harry feigns tiredness and escapes to his room. Ron goes with him, waiting for him to put on the invisibility cloak before heading back down.
“Now?” Draco says, and this time he’s the one parroting. “What do you mean, now? Why all of a sudden? Why, after all I’ve tried to—”
Parvati drops her wand and takes a couple of breaths. “I’m not sweating for you, Weasley. If you want that ruffle fixed you’re going to have to find someone else.”
Ron is, in fact, building a card tower on a table in front of the common room fire with a pack of exploding snap cards. It’s like building a normal tower, but with the added thrill of the possibility of it blowing up at any time.
Speaking of, do dragons speak Parseltongue?
“Oh, all right,” she says. “But you’re dancing some time tonight.”
“Oh, that’s all right,” she says, and offers him none to be going on with.
“So,” says Ron. “Summoning spells.”
You: Yeah
“Oh,” she murmurs. Harry can see her resigning to inevitable mockery. “It means wild boar.”
“Malfoys do not panic,” Malfoy says uselessly.
“Because he’s one of the best in our year!” Hermione whispers back. “It’s for Harry’s sake!”
“Like a charm,” Cedric grins. Harry snorts, leaning over his shoulder to see.
Norberta: The fact you’re only feeling this malicious now shows how incredibly good you are
He follows her gaze to Malfoy watching them with a tiny tilt to his mouth. Harry gives him a small, unsure wave. He turns around swiftly.
She smiles at him, but only slightly. “You’ll be fine, Potter.”
Harry glances over to the pair, but they’re thoroughly engrossed in their work.
Ginny: :)
His eyes land on Harry. It’s a bit telling, honestly.
“Good thing I got one for you then, isn’t it?” He leans across the table and prods it onto the side of her nose. “There! Now we both have pretty eyes.”
The Ravenclaws and Slytherins get to their feet to cheer. Not to be outdone, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff scramble to follow, leaving their guests looking thoroughly taken aback. Hermione gets many claps on the back, and goes quite red with pride.
After a moment, Professor Dumbledore stands. A third silence brushes through with the expectation of a speech. Smiling knowingly, he instead raises a hand.
Hermione drags Harry and Ginny away from their onslaught of raucous bickering, Ron in tow, the four of them sniggering and stumbling over the rocky lawns.
“Just excellent, I thank you.”
Malfoy shrugs. “Lucky guess. And Cassius won’t admit he—”
“She’s crying for you,” she says, and then much quieter, “what’s going on?”
Harry catches a glimpse of another figure stalking across the grounds as he passes a large window. He doesn’t know who, but he can take a pretty good guess. By Thursday the only champion who won’t know about the task will be Cedric, and hell if Harry’s going to let that happen.
“Did not!” Seamus says. “She jus’ wanted to know if I always have half an eyebrow on me left side.”
Harry beams. “Sorry about your book, Malfoy,” he says, handing it back.
for your sensitive self,” Harry snaps. Malfoy ignores him all but for a quirk of a brow, pulling a tome from his satchel.
Greckles: blatant
“Professor, I was asked to come and collect Harry,” he squeaks.
Mrs Norris strolls into view a few moments later, pausing in the middle of the corridor and sitting down. She stares right at them with unblinking red eyes. Her tail swishes and twitches.
Bill: Harry that will never make you a bad person
Freckles: SO
An almighty screeching fills the air, piercing enough that Harry almost drops the egg in shock. Everyone around him is yelling and covering their ears, faces contorted with pain, so he scrambles to close it and holds it an arm’s length away from him.
You: Uh
They hide the goods in the boys’ dormitory, showing off the stock to a surprised and impressed Neville. It’s unfortunate that they have to sit through a whole double lesson for DADA, vibrating out of their skins as they are, but Moody appears to overlook the sudden star-spangled-ness of his students and their unusual enthusiasm. Dinner is equally as torturous a wait, and it’s a miracle the teachers haven’t already put a stop to the obvious festivities being whispered about everywhere they look. Harry overhears a couple of Ravenclaws energetically discussing his approach to the first task. He blushes and ducks his head as he passes and their whispers ramp up in urgency.
“Settle down, settle down!” Dumbledore calls.
At the bottom of the stairs they’re met by a refreshed babble of excitement. Harry spies Ginny over by the fireplace in something pink and odd-looking which Lavender looks to be assisting with amending. Parvati walks straight up to Angelina Johnson and taps her arm, indicating Ron and Harry still hovering by the dormitory stairs. Angelina quirks a brow at Harry but wanders over anyway, looking quite gorgeous in sleeveless mulberry velvet.
"I don’t know about that," Harry said. "I don’t drive." Teddy had a lot of opinions about what would make Harry a little more cool, even though Harry thought being a professional sports star would be enough.
in Harry’s sloppy writing.
"Grand-aunt Wally," Draco said. Harry couldn’t read his expression, but Draco didn’t sound all that happy to see her. "Harry, come here."
"There’s no such thing as too sweet," Draco said. Harry remembered all the care packages full to bursting with chocolate and sweets Draco had been sent at Hogwarts. "Good cake, though." At the end Draco seemed to be in a much better mood, and maybe the secret was plying him with sugar.
“Stand back there, Hagrid!” yells a strained but familiar voice nearby. “They can spit fire twenty feet! I’ve seen this horntail do forty!”
As much as Harry loves Charlie, he’s had enough.
“I mean, it’s all a bit much isn’t it? This whole
Bill: no one convicted and serving a live sentence can
“That was rude,” Harry says off-handedly, pretty sure that he’s just been called a variant of stupid, though he isn’t too sure of…
The pegasi—the closest match Harry can think of—can now be seen to all be taller-than-an-elephant, short-haired palominos. A single one of their stamping black hooves is easily bigger than Harry’s arm is long, and they snort and shake their heads furiously. Flaming eyes roll in glistening sockets, and wings with a span of the Gryffindor common room fold elegantly to their sides.
Harry laughs, and throws an arm around his shoulders. “And we’d still love you regardless, Ron.”
says the boa.
Norberta: I wish we didn’t have to take these precautions but it’s serious
“Thank you, Dobby!” he says, pulling them over his frozen toes. “These must have taken ages.”
“Very funny.”
Cedric jogs away down the corridor. Harry goes to find something to do until dinner. Maybe he’ll go to the library and look up those dragons…
Harry thinks.
I’m not thick. Not like some people…”
Leek: Lee Jordan
Decidedly uncomfortable, Harry hastens back to his seat.
Harry stretches on his toes to see where Ron is looking. Sure enough, looking as surly and unimpressed as one could expect, is Viktor Krum.
Ron exhales loudly and stretches his arms, sprawled on the grass with Hermione and Zabini. “I dunno about you guys, but
“I’m fine, Gin, are you okay?”
“What? No I’m not.
Harry’s one consolation is that his and Cedric’s plan had executed perfectly: no one at the Prophet is dedicated enough to their job to scrutinise the photographs too closely. At least not those of Harry.
. Their hooves hit the ground with a minor earthquake, galloping tremendously past the astonished rows of students. The carriage comes crashing down behind its steeds, bouncing and rolling at an alarming pace.
“Whatever it is, we can work it out later,” Harry says. He heaves it onto a table by the dormitory stairs as everyone gets back into the swing of the party, passing around plates of food and calling loudly for each other’s attention. Someone switches on the record player and Harry happily allows himself to be twisted and turned between all of his friends for conversation and congratulations.
“Well, are we going?” he whispers after a moment.
“Ah shit, I’ve got to go. See you later, Harry!”
“Pretty much,” he says.
“Don’t tell me in the middle of the hall, then!”
Sunday 17:56
“What?” she asks him. “I want to say ’ello to your friends.”
“In you go, you bloody Gryffindors,” he says, but nods appreciatively at the food they hand him as compensation. The wall slides back and, from the outside, it looks like nothing’s amiss. The common room is empty, fire roaring, and no noise whatsoever. They each step through, Hermione and Ron disappearing through a rippling bubble before Harry, who follows eagerly and—wow. Someone truly talented has given the place a makeover.
For reasons unknown, George tries his level best to badger Warrington into giving him a congratulatory kiss. Fred and Maxine egg him on, and Malfoy and Ginny heckle from the back. Such a bizarre scene, Harry isn’t sure he’s been privy to before. The lot of them race back to the castle once they’ve stowed their brooms, stumbling and shoving and raucous. Ginny wins by a mile, leading the lions’ way up to the Gryffindor Tower. The seven of them duck behind large tapestries when they hear Peeves approaching, and giggle between themselves sneaking away.
“Oh, shit,” Harry whispers. The corridor is narrow, and Filch is likely only seconds from meeting them in the middle. “Be quiet.”
His throat is sticky and suffocated and his stomach refuses to stop churning. He can barely face more than one bite of breakfast, let alone the plate Hermione is gently encouraging him to finish.
The dragon farthest away is a silvery blue, tall and thin and elegant, and is growling and snapping at its handlers. The next is green and stumpy, no smaller than the others, stamping around as if throwing a tantrum. It seems to be causing an earthquake with each footfall.
He shrugs. “If none of you are able to keep your voices down, please expect to be overheard.”
“I shall be delighted to hear the reason behind the rudeness, but another time. The Weighing of the Wands is about to begin, as Mr Diggory has said, and we must be along.”
“Brilliant!” Harry cheers. “You’re
“It’s almost time for the ceremony,” he says shortly. “I’m not sure this is quite an appropriate place for an

Skeeter smiles sweetly. “I was merely suggesting the possibility that your views may be somewhat outdated.”

Freckles: hiding in the orchard
There are ruffles and drapings of silk lining the walls, dripping from sconces and adorning the arms of the gleaming suits of armour that now move without so much as a clank. Rich, thick tablecloths have been lain out over the highly-polished wood of the house tables, each in their corresponding colours, with embroidered table runners shimmering gold and silver beneath the platters they boast. The cutlery and crockery of each table have been embellished with their house mascot and the school crest. Matching napkins have delicate embroidery and are impressively presented.
Snake: BECAUSE THEN WHO WOULD I HAVE TO DUEL YOU TWATS
Shrieks and yelps of “Where?! Where?!” and “Ouch Ron! That was my foot!” rise up around Harry. He grins and turns his head with the crowd. Arthur Weasley’s words from the World Cup campsite come floating back to him—”Always the same,” he’d said. “We just can’t resist showing off when we all get together.”
“What—
He leaps.
Christmas morning at Hogwarts has always been a thing of wonder.
Harry steps slightly behind Malfoy and slips his hand over his mouth. Malfoy harrumphs but gets the message. They slip into a convenient alcove, heaven-sent.
Greckles: you and your bloody soft spot
“The expert is upstairs with Dumbledore, right now, but once that’s all done there’ll be a little photoshoot,” Bagman continues. “This here is Rita Skeeter, she’ll be doing a small piece for the Daily Prophet.” He turns around to introduce Harry to the witch in bright magenta robes.
“Sure. Of course we can.”
Harry looks askance at his friends, but receives shrugs all around.
flattered.”
“Still, a pretty good idea,” says a quiet voice from behind them. “Any idea where Granger is? I’m here to deliver the kneazles.”
“Oi Harry!” George yells with suspicious timing. “You want a go pulling my cracker?”
Freckles: :(
“D’you know what it’s about?” Harry asks.
“Za—er, Blaise,” Ron stammers, swallowing hard. Harry stares between them, suddenly seeing everything fall into place.
“A most extraordinary performance we have seen tonight,” Dumbledore continues when the fuss settles. “I must commend you all on your incredible talents and flair for the dramatics. Now, I welcome all of you, ladies, gentlemen, ghosts, and particularly
“It’s so lonely you know?” Harry sighs in sudden false sorrow, buoyed by his success. “Hermione has a date she’s all in a flap about, being so secretive and all… If Seamus and Dean don’t go together I might just reevaluate everything I know—and Neville and Ginny!” he cries, placing the back of a hand over his forehead dramatically. “The betrayal! I thought I’d be all alone! With Ron, of course.”
Ginny: Ron what
“You’re too mental to die just because they’re throwing a load of nonsense at you,” she snorts.
“And you’re not doing much constructive!” Hermione turns on him. “How long until the next task?”
“Oh, a Gregorovitch creation. Outstanding craftmanship, I must agree. Hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” Viktor nods. “Rather larger in diameter than one usually sees… Ten and a quarter inches, quite rigid. Avis!”
“What?”
let him die?”
“Accio dragon book!”
“Anyway, if you three are plotting, I’m going to tell Snape.”
Headboy: And yet he also said not to rule out the possibility
“I don’t know!” he says instead. “Charlie was there—Ron’s brother. He says he thinks they have a death wish for us because the dragons were mothers. There were eggs, too.”
“My dear Madame Maxime,” he greets, barely stooping when he kisses her hand.
Angel(ina): Angelina Johnson
“Harry?” Ron asks outside the bed curtains.
Harry pulls the badge out of his pocket to show him.
“And Malfoy had to come?” Ron grimaces.
“Atmosphere?”
“Fred saw Hermione sneaking away and thought we should follow,” Ron whispers. Harry almost laughs. Just like first year all over again.
“Oh, so it’s
“Ron’s frills,” Parvati says. “I’m better at changing the shape and colour than the fiddly bits.”
Cedric snorts a laugh when Harry explains the plan. “Sure, let’s do it. You’re great, you know that?”
“Clear up that mess, Potter!” Snape drawls. Harry half expects him to turn around and take points.
“Helping?” Hermione reminds, completely exasperated.
“I shall
“What are you two whispering about, then?” calls Ron, toast finished, hands shoved moodily into his robe pockets.
Harry looks over his shoulder and looks between all of the couples behind him. Madame Maxime is very conspicuously dwarfing Hagrid, Professor Dumbledore is terrorising Professor Trelawney, by the looks, and, ah… Ron and Blaise. Ron is as red as Harry expects, anxious and spluttering and still very willing in Blaise’s hands. He snickers.
Mr Crouch holds up his wand and gives Harry a nine. Dumbledore does the same.
Harry inhales deeply and presses his hand to the wood. Just before he pushes it open he has a thought, hurriedly unpinning his new badge and putting it in his pocket.
You: No :)
“This means, Harry, that we’re going to solve the problem of an
“Oi,” Zabini calls. All of Malfoy’s friends are on their feet. “Calm down.”
“I haven’t really thought about it, honestly. Nervous. Yeah, nervous.” Not as nervous as
Norberta: She did the right thing and I will not hear you’ve been an arse to her, all right?
One fear: wow ok simp
“Um,” Harry manages, but she takes hold of his forearm anyway.
One moment passes. A second. A third.
“You’re a right witch, you know that?”
Harry frowns. “I didn’t actually think to check… Well anyway, I was hardly going to molest an eleven-year-old by going through her pockets, was I?” A nearby second-year gives him a very alarmed look as they go by. He rolls his eyes. “I was already trying to haul you over to the door, and Riddle was prattling on about his greatness, and then you were too busy sobbing when you woke up to do much of anything!”
Greckles: merlin I really wish you had
Snake: Draco Malfoy
Greckles: nah man it’s fine we’re something the kids call, ⭑☆★
You: I want to hurt him
Greyham: Graham Montague
You: I can’t stand it
now?” Harry laughs.
Hermione smacks his arm with her notebook.
so he nicks one to wear himself.
Harry gasps great gulps of air and tries to stop the shaking.
“Well, your date is taken care of,” Draco hums, inclining his head to something over Harry’s shoulder. Harry realises a beat too late that he should be looking over there and not at Draco’s fingers tapping the rim of his empty flute, and when he does he catches sight of Parvati safely ensconced in a close dance with Lavender.
Freckles: why do I like you
“Hermione found out that Hogwarts has house-elves, and now she’s on the warpath,” Harry mutters.
Headboy: Nowhere is safe
“Finally shown up, have you?” Malfoy huffs. Zabini is picking at his nails and dangling a niffler cage from his wrist.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “What incredible wit you have, Malfoy.”
Greckles: Oh?
Cedric waves his hands in front of himself. “No no, I believe you… Why would I ask Malfoy?”
“He can’t apparate in or out, because of the wards,” Ron says. Hermione smiles proudly at him. He smiles back. “I doubt he could use the floo, either.”
After barely half a minute of dancing, she says, “Oh, there they are,” and switches to Millicent Bullstrode.
They run over to the owlery during the break, where Ron has to snatch Pigwidgeon out of the air to get him to stay still enough for Harry to attach his letter. He throws the poor owl from the window and he plummets, struggling to get the weight of Harry’s rambling letter up out of gravity’s reach. He manages, eventually, while all three of them lean from the sill with slightly guilty expressions.
"I’ll still write the letter. I don’t care about the fine at all, and I might as well do something good if the League is going to complain no matter what." Harry said.
"Good. Because we are never talking about this again. Also, you slept with Dean, so we'll call it even," Neville said. Harry was not appreciating this being flipped on him, but Neville was clever.
"Didn’t make plans in time," Harry said. Not that it was an excuse. He could. Draco hummed a little. They parted with well-wishes, and Draco said he would return January third.
Draco whipped around with his wand so quickly that Harry almost drew his out of pure instinct. Instead, he raised both hands in surrender.
now that he has it. His fingers tighten around Harry’s skin.
Harry grins at him, bumps their shoulders again, and the world narrows down to their touch for a second.
They don’t exchange much more before Draco leaves. Although drinking to oblivion seems to have lost its appeal since he’s begun taking care of himself again, Draco is ready to tuck himself in bed once again with a bottle of good wine.
Draco rolls his eyes, waving a dismissive hand. “She wasn’t very supportive of my changing, especially the part where I said I didn’t want to marry a good pure-blood girl and continue the Malfoy lineage.”
"Ah, Daph, Astoria and Gemma loved you. They hope you’ll come back. Will you? In two weeks, it’s Astoria’s birthday," Draco said.
, for it?
That would be something.
"Fine." Draco was staring at Harry’s still damp hair.
"Spare me," said Daphne. "Or at least spare Potter who did not ask about Marietta Edgecombe's sister's tits."
He’s on his second glass when the wine starts tasting sour and unpleasant on his tongue and he can’t drink another drop of it. The bottle ends up abandoned on the kitchen table, along with a myriad of objects that he, in his boredom, dug up from the cupboards; mugs, plates, bowls, everything he could get his hands on, which reminded him too much of Harry. It’s too bad that everything in the house reminds him of Harry.
If he never tried to attempt that bond or died to find Harry’s soul and bring him back, he’d still have more than what he has now. He’d still have
"Of course. That makes sense. Like how Flitwick always went on about intentional magic."
“It worked, okay?! He’s awake now! And I didn’t die,” though he refrains from adding the
"I don't really understand it, but I take it you were eventually going to tire of bankers and cauldron heirs."
“I’m not,” Harry whispers, a sad smile taking over his lips. “Alone, you know. People come by.”
The man’s voice is barely a whisper near Draco’s ear as he says, “Can I buy you and your friend drinks?”
Once more, she helped me with makeup, clothes and charms — a shirt long enough that looked like a dress, on top of one of her jeans. My face was a mix of Hermione’s powerful features and Ron’s unsettling grin. She meant it as a joke, and I didn’t mind, despite the gnawing guilt eating my insides out.
"If you say so, Draco." Draco was going to give Harry a headache if he didn’t stand still. He was vibrating with information, pacing back and forth.
"The house is not as badly off as I assumed. We have a lot of work to do even so."
"One of my coworkers is from Mexico, and he said his family back home listens to the Championship Quidditch team matches early on Saturday mornings," Bill said.
However, when he opens Harry’s messages, he finds something he’s never seen before. The last one is from the last day Harry had been awake, and it had never reached the recipient.
"Do you ever get tired when you're casting?" Draco asked.
Harry ran a hand over the sheets again. He was too tired to change them. It was late, anyway. He could spell them clean to return.
The battery is dead, but he’s sure the charger must be in here somewhere. Before he considers his actions too deeply, he plugs it in and waits.
Harry nods, but he doesn’t move.
Still, he can’t help scanning the front page of the
“There’s nothing you can say that’ll convince me Scorpius is a good name for a child,” Potter offers on one of these afternoons, lifting his head momentarily from his notebook.
Elle doesn’t have that kind of time.
“You seem to be recovering well,” he says, at the same time Harry’s rough voice enunciates, “You seem to be doing well.”
Mother lifts her head, gaze so intent on her son it makes him shiver.
“Draco, do you—” Pansy stops short, when she takes in the sight, expression turning slightly blank. “Hello, Potter.”
It doesn’t matter, in the end. He smoked yesterday, and he knows he’s going to smoke again as soon as he gets out of this room.
The contact happens so slowly, Draco holds his breath when the tip of Harry’s fingers finally brush his skin. The touch feels insufficient; he needs more.
Draco backs away a single step, the magic around Harry building to a suffocating level.
This is Harry, who wants him back, who wants to kiss him, to be with him.
"Is that all?" Draco asked.
He’s been here before. It had looked different when Draco had sacrificed himself to find Harry’s soul months ago. He remembers the beach, the mountains, the bridge. He remembers Harry’s inexpressive eyes staring back at him.
"I'll see you at Worlds?" Viktor asked. "I think this will be my last one."
"Of course, it's damned blood wards," Draco muttered to himself, exasperated.
Harry’s hum vibrates against his skin, as his hand finds the hem of Draco’s shirt. He murmurs, “I know the ending already.”
“Are you going to let me go?” Harry asks once inside. Malfoy’s eyes snap up to his. His expression is truly unreadable.
“Thank you, Professor. I think.”
“Yes, well, we have more than one moronic brother in our family,” Fred grins, leaning in.
Greckles: hey!!! Muggles are weird to us
friend
You: Long story
“And you won’t if I let you tag along?” Harry asks.
“One, two, three!” their friends all chant from across the hall, and Harry’s ruthless yank is rewarded with the largest fountain of glitter yet. It’s the size of at least three of their party poppers and drifts over more than half the hall.
Ron grimaces. “Now you’ve said that, I really don’t want to know.”
The Hungarian horntail, number four.
“What?” Hermione asks.
“Dean! Shut up!” Seamus swats at him, red in the face. Ginny cackles and threatens to test him on it. Seamus smacks her too.
It crashes into the spot Harry was in just a moment ago, leaving behind a gaping maw of broken slate and splintered wood. He ducks and rolls again as
Ginny: unbridled
Higgs: Terrence Higgs
especially when Hermione drags him away to the kitchens first to talk to Dobby.
“Lovely.”
“One second.” Harry grins and pats her shoulder. “She’s right, you look great.”
He'd thought it had been a
Cedric and Fleur share a smile as they pass each other.
Grateful for the first thing today that has gone right, Harry sighs with relief. Before anyone can really let their guard down, however, the man with the camera jumps out from the side of the room.
At least Draco’s less of a bastard, now.
Sunday 18:34
“Now, you won’t mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, will you Harry? It allows me to talk to you normally.”
Ronald: Never mind!!
Bill: You have suffered an awful, awful lot of bad things
the both of them chorus.
Quaffle: oh my god hold on I need a quill
“Ronald,” he says, and smiles.
“Good, all good,” says Mr Ollivander. He hands the wand back to Krum. “Last but not least, Mr Potter.”
“This is good,” Malfoy says. “You have a good chance of it working when you need it to, as long as you remember to focus on intent.”
“I’m proud of you,” Hermione says, tone much less excitable than her expression. Harry appreciates the attempt at subtlety, at least.
Norberta: Why would I lie about that??
Ronald: oh
Harry ducks back under the cloak, inhaling sharply when he comes face-to-face with Malfoy. Malfoy studies him silently.
As usual, the table in front of them suddenly finds itself laden with a multitude of dishes. It seems the house-elves have really outdone themselves tonight, with the array of foods Harry leans in to look over. There are pies and casseroles and escallops and pasta dishes and potatoes done every which way, and he’s fairly certain that no two platters are the same and half of them he’s never seen before. Looking over to the other tables, he sees even more mouth-watering foods.
“Oi, Malfoy, Chaser or Seeker?”
“I’m thinking I really might just take Ron and be done with it,” Harry grumbles. “McGonagall would be to blame for that, anyway.”
Viktor catches his model and pulls it out by the tail. The Chinese fireball, number three.
“Somewhat.”
“I suppose. Hey, Hermione, can we leave the cats in the dorm?”
“Of course!” Malfoy mutters. “He can’t
“I’ve never been caught before!”
Do enjoy!
“By broom then?” Harry asks. He scans the stars for any sign of movement.
“Yes, ’e squeaked when Viktor clinked glasses. ’E almost dropped it.”
“Dumbledore!” he calls. “How are you, my dear fellow? How are you?”
He meets each of their eyes, and they all wince in sympathy.
Harry laughs. “Aren’t they both?”
“None of your business, Potter,” he hisses.
Spinnings: oh my god look at the boys lmao
Hermione returns to the Gryffindor common room just before lunch, sitting down and immediately putting quill to notebook. Harry sees several pages have been crossed completely through, and that someone else has also scribbled notes in several of the margins.
he’s a Prefect.”
The parchment isn’t signed, but in the corner is a small pink star. Harry brushes his thumb over it and smiles when the words
“Dobby be making these hisself!” he announces. “Dobby is buying the wool with his wages!”
“Let’s go to bed,” Ron mumbles, nudging Harry with his elbow. “We have a plan now, anyway.”
“It’s all edible!” Fred hollers. “Just spicing things up a bit!”
Bagman tells them. “You’ll know when you see it. On the canon then, Mr Diggory!” He turns to leave but stops short. “Harry, may I have a word?”
Harry laughs. “Just… Have a look.”
“Dobby!” he cries, shuffling backwards so quickly he almost falls out of bed and smacks his head on his nightstand. “What are you doing here?”
He walks down to breakfast with Ron on the Saturday morning to be greeted with more than the usual stares and whispers. Out of the throng of Hufflepuffs, Cedric stands up and waves the newspaper in his hand at them, grinning broadly.
and manages to make it to the tent in one piece. He clears his throat twice before pushing the flap aside and stepping in.
after you.”
Sunday 02:58
“Hey,” Harry murmurs, placing his hand gently on Ron’s shoulder. “How about I go and find someone to help?”
“Anyone who wishes to enter the Tournament need only write their name on a piece of parchment and drop it into the goblet. It shall be placed in the Entrance Hall tonight, to be easily accessible, and aspiring champions have twenty-four hours during which to submit themselves. Tomorrow night, the goblet shall choose whomever it deems worthy to compete for each school.
Freckles: see someone cares
Malfoy sighs. “Let’s get the theory down first, shall we?”
“Not yet,” he whispers back. Fleur had come running up to him in a tizzy at breakfast, but neither Krum nor Cedric were anywhere to be seen.
Crookshanks:
“Harry,” Ron says faintly, “I can’t wear this.”
“Hey, Ginny,” he says with completely false bravado, “would you like to go to the ball with me?”
Malfoy turns his frown on him, stepping forward and trying (but failing) to look down his nose at him. Ron is just too tall, and Harry catches himself trying not to laugh.
Snake: Get out
“Shall we get closer?” Hagrid asks Madame Maxime. Harry and Malfoy follow once they find their legs and Harry drops his hand.
“You all right, Hermione?” he asks. She and Ron pick their way over, minding the number of people they’ve collected.
So just an fyi but I've started dumping my longer & more serious hp fics onto my account because even though I've worked really hard on them I just cannot bring myself to continue/write more with JK being the way she is (but I still want to put it out there for me and for the people who may benefit from it, you know?)

Snape sneers at them again before whirling around and clipping off back down the walkway. “See to it that it stays that way!”

figurehead leader. (Harry does not even think to include himself on such a list, despite his regrettable fame.)
“Because I know you apologised to Hermione last month,” Harry breathes. “I know you apologised to her and I know we’re all… Less volatile this year. I’ve had some thoughts.”
“Well, all of the school heads are on the panel,” Hermione tells him. All of them turn to look at her. She huffs. “Do none of you read
Freckles: ah yes,
Ron mumbles.
“Good point!” he shouts, and trips over his own feet.
“He is rather brilliant at flying,” Zabini agrees, “wouldn’t you say, Draco?”
Ron is gone when Harry rips open his bed hangings. It was awkward the night before when they went to bed, and he’s under no illusion that it won’t be the same today. He does, however, meet him outside the common room with Hermione in the same moment Harry decides he’d rather be whispered about than trapped by the Creeveys.
Ron shuffles ahead of them, crunching into his stack of toast. He kicks absently at the grass and its crackling film of frost. Harry explains the previous night in detail—how only Dumbledore, Crouch and Ludo Bagman had wanted him to compete, how the contract will probably kill him if he doesn’t. How Moody had suggested that someone was out to kill him.
Harry thinks, just as something smacks into his side and his fingers close around the heavensent handle of his broomstick.
You’re already famous enough as it is. He doesn’t mention it, but of course he’s going to be upset.”
“Woah, woah,” Cedric says quietly. “What?
“Thanks?” Harry says, unsure of the transformation that seems to have taken place.
He hears the sharp intake of air by his side, assumes it’s Hermione, but he can’t begin to care. “This means…”
, as he scans the pile of recently received letters on his table he’s been postponing opening since the last of Harry’s news in the papers.
“We should name her,” Draco says from his spot on the couch, the cat resting calmly on his lap.
“You miss a memory, Draco. I’m gone.” Harry glances at the other Harry again. “But he’s here. And you love him.”
"Winston says he's not coming. So I ask him, then what the fuck are we doing? He gets all huffy. He leaves for his sister's place."
She talks as if she knows him, but how could she, when they’ve been so far from each other for the last three years? Mother doesn’t know him anymore.
Draco wants to tell him about the bond, tell Harry he’s the one pulling him and urging him to stay, but he can’t lose this now. He wonders if he should be more terrified of the way Harry’s slowly slipping away. He probably would be, if they weren’t as close as they are now.
"We didn’t give you the nickname," Harry said, holding his hands up. "Don’t take it up with me. Blame the British Press."
Harry wasn’t sure he should credit a victory to Draco, but the Falcons made an exceptional showing considering the recent brief slump, and he caught the Snitch in thirty and turned to the friends and family box with one fist in the air. He just made out where Draco was before Sam tugged on the collar of Harry’s jersey to go to the post game huddle.
Even Oliver and Sam, who were all in on new Quidditch techniques, swore up a storm. Atty seemed to get it the fastest, but even she couldn’t manage it consistently. Once she slipped sideways, and Luc caught her on his broom.
“This is too risky, Draco,” Pansy scowls, eyes narrowed at Draco.
Harry certainly would have preferred the version of events where Dumbledore mentored him by telling Harry that he would enjoy drag brunch more than nightclubs and to not do party drugs.
and love this place once held.
Harry lifts his head, but his gaze is glazed, distant. It makes an icy shiver run down Draco’s spine.
to my face. You meant it." Then, more quietly, he continued, "I don't begrudge you for feeling that way. You don’t have to forgive me."
Taken aback by the question, Draco adjusts himself in his seat, unable to find a comfortable position. His eyes search Harry’s face for something he can’t find in their bond. Where was the anger he was expecting?
From the corner of his eyes, Draco notices Healer Cameron tensing minutely by his side.
“You’re an angel.” He sips the coffee, humming contently as the mellow sweet taste fills his throat. A light roast blend with a citric aftertaste, one of his favourite blends, Harry knows. “This—” Draco gestures at the books, “is research.”
Your fingers intertwined with mine, and I scooted closer.
“Harry, I want you inside me,” he says in a hushed voice, the words almost getting lost in the night. Draco wants Harry’s bruising grip on his skin again, Harry filling him with his body, his magic. The bond quavers and stops, subdued by Harry’s touch, then flares alive with love.
"I hear you. I'll try to…" But Harry was cut off by Draco kissing him lightly. His heart jumped at Draco's hand running along his wrists and sides. Draco had been blazingly jealous, Harry realised. He was trying and failing to keep it under wraps, hiding behind the bite of sarcasm.
Draco turns and faces him, sticky and breathless.
to see you, to challenge you to recognise me again, to find me in the middle of the crowd and to realise it was me watching you.
Draco showed him the pale, vulnerable line of his throat. But Draco had always been vulnerable to Harry in some ways, since they met. Maybe it worked better when Harry was the one who let go. When Harry let Draco find his softness and press his teeth against it.
"It won’t hurt you," Draco said. "It’s protected, not cursed."
“I told you I had met him,” she answers with an innocent shrug.
"What's the headline going to be?
"The season is starting—"
"I was supposed to do everything my parents wanted. Retake their place in society. Then I met Daniel."
“You need to hear this, Draco.” Luna talks to him with the same tone she uses for her younger patients. Not condescending, but soft and caring, as if Draco may break if she pushes too hard.
His friends remain silent until Draco takes the first sip.
"Falcons, we are going all the way to the finals. No question about it. It's been a great season, we've had great results. That ranking reflects some luck on our part but also hard work. And if we’ve worked this hard, I want everyone to see it through. I want everyone eating well and sleeping well and in top form. I want everyone to put it all in. We take home another banner, we'll be going down in history. No one has ever taken home a Cup two years in a row. Until now."
, he can cast the curse away from her body and she’ll be fine, her magic stored in an object.
But he’s not fine, and he fully and truly expects Potter not to show up again.
“I’ll just... be gone.”
and suck all the magic for himself, thus killing the tree, and your house in the process, that was deeply connected to that ancient magic.”
The hurtful growl Harry lets out has Draco on his feet, casting diagnostic charms with quivering fingers. “It’s okay. I’m here,” he whispers, not sure himself of the veracity of the words. He holds Harry close, eyes focusing on the tendrils of magic floating around them. There’s nothing wrong with Harry. There shouldn’t be anything wrong with him. Why can’t his diagnostics detect anything? Draco bites his lower lip, nose shoved against Harry’s hair and thankful that Harry can’t see the tears damping his cheeks. “You will be okay, love. There will be no pain soon.”
Just what the actual fuck is Harry Potter doing here? Draco’s heard about the Saviour’s return to London, after two years traveling around the world, but this... How did he end up here of all places?
So, Teddy held Harry close, as close as his tiny hands could, and cried, “Please, don’t go.”
Harry snorted. "That’s because I'm Harry Potter. I have my choice of teams, I don’t need the money, and my agent Barb would eat the League alive. That doesn’t mean I can do whatever I want."
"It’s one in the afternoon," Draco said. But he slipped off to the guest bathroom after asking for a towel and came downstairs dressed in a different outfit as Harry was scrambling the eggs.
Hope lodges inside Draco slowly, crashing against his heart painfully. He allows it, because it’s been too long since he’s last felt it. Draco
At some point it stopped, and it was Harry who went to seek the music out. Draco was ruffling his own hair as if he was deeply irritated. All the books were back on their shelves, but he was shuffling them back forth with flicks of his wand.
“To be sure I was still me.”
"Is this what you want?" Draco's voice wavered with desire and uncertainty.
"Thanks so much for your time," Harry said. Before Pansy could do her usual winding down routine, Harry got up and left the conference room. Sometimes he hated Quidditch.
Oliver reached around Harry’s shoulder, pulling him into a sweaty half hug in his vest. "You don’t want to know, trust me. We won, okay?" Harry nodded and let Oliver calm him.
Draco hasn't felt this pull of magic since he started living in the Muggle world. The thrill of recognition, of finding those who are alike, of
"Are you more comfortable on a broom?" Toni asked, finally. Harry nodded. "Why don’t we try that?"
His mind draws a blank as he averts his eyes to a crack on the floor. He can still feel Potter’s gaze on him, his magic crackling and electric, testing him,
"What’s this?" Harry asked, wand floating an oblong glass rod. Draco’s smile was predatory.
Each step seems to take something from him. Harry’s shoulders hunch down. His face is scrunched in a scowl. Draco tries touching his arm, but Harry flinches back so violently Draco refrains from touching him again. Instead, he follows in silence, as Harry seems to have forgotten he’s not alone.
Ron drank his fancy coffee without answering.
"Keys are symbolic. Your house will let me in if you desire, with or without it. But no, I think it would be good to clear my head." Draco turned his attention back to the tiny empty drawers.
"Laugh like I’ve just told you a funny joke," Toni instructed while Harry hovered a little higher up so she could shoot from below. Harry did, but it felt unnatural.
It seemed Draco was not going to be content with a quick fuck to take the edge off. He moved at a leisurely pace, and Harry matched him to have more time to commit every gasp to memory. That splotchy flush of arousal. His shoulder bared to Harry.
It was hard telling where I had landed. So distracted I was while apparating, I ended up checking if all of me had got to the destination — wherever it was. Everything was at its place.
"That’s the house?"
Draco feels his throat tightening and chest hurting as if it's been ripped open after this session, whereas he has said nothing out of the ordinary for him. It’s all because Harry Potter was there, and he listened in contemplative silence to everything that Draco said. He didn’t storm out of the room, nor scoff at his attempts at opening up. He just listened.
Though this Harry has never done this, his body remembers how to render Draco an incoherent mess. When Harry’s fingers find his most sensitive spot, Draco’s vision blanks. “Oh, God, stop. Stop,” he wails, nails digging into the skin of Harry’s arms.
The urgency to fill the silence surges inside him, but he can’t bring himself to break the quietness that has encased the room, feeling its frail peace turn into something strained and uncomfortable.
"Cut it out, or I’ll send you to the bench, Baddock," the head referee said. But Atty had already flown back over to the throng to catch whatever it was Baddock was saying to his teammates and laughing about.
He chances another glance at Potter, but he has his green eyes focused on Janet as she shares her most recent accomplishments—something about being able to drive again. Draco’s followed her story from the beginning, when the woman joined them after a traumatic accident that caused the death of her brother. He understands guilt and fear of repeating old mistakes. Most of all, Draco is learning about recovery, but right now, he can’t focus on a word she’s saying.
When Harry finally shows up again, he’s sitting by Elle’s bed, showing her something on his phone.
“And you love the world, you love magic.” A slow grin plays on Harry’s lips when he cups Draco’s cheek between his fingers.
Draco had half expected Granger to be a know-all, like in school. But the woman has taken a much quieter approach to knowledge. She doesn’t share as much, but when she does, it’s with the same excitement Draco sometimes holds. He gathers the secrecy and reservation that comes from her Unspeakable training has changed her in this regard, and he’s eagerly waiting for the moment when Granger will share her conclusions with him.

“Absolutely not,” he snaps.

“Shit,” he breathes. The horntail tries to toast his rocky cover to, crucially, no avail. Harry thinks desperately of the largest non-magical snake he can.
Theodore Nott, in very tight black muggle jeans and shirt, is leaning on the brickwork outside the Slytherin common room looking thoroughly bored. They take off the cloak a few feet away just to see him jump, and grin when he rolls his eyes at the stickers on their faces.

Harry holds his hands up in surrender. “I was just going to offer to take you to Madam Pomfrey if you were.”
Judging by the unintelligible screeching, no.
A shout echoes from a little ways up the table.
Harry contracts Ron's foot-in-mouth syndrome
“Yeah, have you?”
“Are you going to go on about that forever? The snakes got the egg.”
“Have too.”
“Oh no you don’t, Laddie!”
Harry rolls his eyes and strides out into the corridor. “I don’t know, Ron, I don’t bloody know. It’s not like you’re free of this either. Everyone’s going to be taking someone.”

“Just get past them, I think. At least I hope so—they asked for nesting mothers, which is suicide in my opinion. But no one did ask our opinions.” He sighs. “I wish Harry hadn’t got caught up in all this. I pity the one who gets the horntail, and with his luck…”

“And what am I?” Draco asks irritably. “A puff of air?”
“Where else?” he asks, though he has no idea what he means. Are they sure butterbeer is non-alcoholic?
Snake: Welcome to my world
Ronaldo: fuck mornings
Harry watches her unclip her bag and retrieve a handful of candles, lighting and floating them into the air with her wand.
Harry slaps a hand to his face. “Oh yeah! You’re a third-year!”
“You heard me. Fine.”
Greckles: double ew
“Hey Neville!” Ron hollers. Harry grimaces, rubbing a finger into his aching ear. Out of the corner of his eye he sees Malfoy’s shoulders flinch upwards.
“It’s all right, I haven’t done anything to them,” he says. “It’s the custard creams you have to watch—” Neville, having just shoved one of the biscuits into his mouth whole, chokes and tries to spit it out. “Don’t worry! I’m joking!”
Malfoy rolls his eyes but passes the crate over the table. Leonard the niffler uses the distraction to make a bid for Ron’s plate. Fleur catches him and smiles when he melts under her gently-stroking fingers.
“He’s okay, I think,” Hagrid says, frowning.
“Dumbledore himself requested we help out,” Fred mutters to Hermione proudly.
Dates... dates...

“Nothing gets in the way of a good story,” Skeeter says lightly. Her bloody Quick-Quotes Quill is hovering around again. Harry would quite like to set it on fire.
“Don’t! No! It—It’s a surprise!” he yelps, and looks like he very much regrets a lot of things.
“Can’t you just call them?” Malfoy asks. Harry rolls his eyes.
“It’s S.P.E.W., not Spew!” she insists. “And what do you mean?”
“Has to be, works with bloody
The two of them stumble down the rocky path, heading towards the glowing lights of Hagrid’s hut and the Beauxbatons carriage. Harry can hear Madame Maxime talking inside it. She must be near the door.
“Ah, you are ’ere!” Fleur says, hugging all three of them. “We are free to go, so let’s celebrate!”

Colin takes him up through the castle to a nondescript room in the Charms corridor.
“How do I look?” Seamus asks, brandishing himself in the middle of the room.
we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat.”
Several times, Harry finds himself gazing at Cho instead of scanning the field. Once, he catches himself watching Malfoy, and quickly shakes himself. It’s always been Harry who’s better at spotting the snitch first, there’s no need to mark him.
“Your plans! It’s all madness! You fought a giant basilisk with just a sword, and you expect us to think that you’re
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Why?”
Hermione is stunned into a very, very rare silence. Harry grins, and George winks at him, though he too seems surprised by Fred’s generosity.
Professor McGonagall looks quite surprised. “Of course, Potter. Now, off you go.”
“Yes?” He shoves a hand into a pocket and holds out another badge. Harry takes it and pins it to the front of his robes.
“Stop,” he says, almost hoarse. Moody doesn’t take any notice. “Stop!” he repeats, louder, just as Professor McGonagall comes running into the courtyard. “Stop it, you’re hurting him!”
Hermione smirks and stands up herself. She climbs onto the bench, mirrored astride the shield-tunnel by none other than Dra—
“Harry and I are going to find somewhere quiet so I can ask him a little about how it feels to be in such a controversial position,” Skeeter tells him. Harry is surprised she doesn’t pet him on the head and call him a good boy, for all her voice drips with condescension.
Harry starts. “How’d you know?”
Freckles: please no
History! Or A Highly Biased and Selective History, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School!”
Krum strides in last of all, all the way down the rows of students. He stops and kneels front and centre, his head bowed to the head table. Once the remaining students have followed his lead, a second peal of applause rolls through the hall.
Harry gets down to dinner with plenty of time to tell Ron, Hermione, Neville and Gin all about the ceremony, but mostly what a cow Rita Skeeter is.
“I never said anything of the sort.”

“It was fun,” Dean says. He winks at Ginny. “Seamus got chatted up by a drunk hag at the Broomsticks.”

“I’ve read this bit at least twelve times,” he mutters.
Norberta: I don’t know what happened but whatever it is
You: Dw about it
Harry fidgets. Asclepius takes a swipe at last year’s Weasley jumper and gets two of his claws stuck. Harry disentangles him and puts him back in the carrier before he can wriggle free.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Whatever, Malfoy. Now, are you joining us or not?”
“Just… You’ll know why.”
Greckles: you’re soft on her and harry don’t even deny it
“Partners?” Harry interrupts. Professor McGonagall looks at him with a sort of exasperated pity he doesn’t much like.
“Once?” he repeats. He daren’t even hope for anything less than antagonistic, but all Draco responds with is, “Once,” said even more quietly, and a small nod. Harry follows his gaze to his shoes and back up again.
He’s falling. Freefalling so completely he can’t even draw breath, plummeting feet-first into the abyss that entrenches his home. There are rocks coming up to meet his flailing limbs. His robes are flapping and cracking in the wind. Above him the horntail bellows.
Spinnet: we’re gonna fuckin BREEZE slytherin
“Yeah, whatever, I’ve been crying my eyes out
Bill: I’m proud of you lot
“How did
“Ah, the fourth champion!” Bagman cheers, rising and bounding over as soon as he sees Harry. “Come in, Harry, come in. It’s just the Wand Weighing ceremony, nothing to be worried about. The rest of the judges will be along soon.”
—but he says it with such certainty that Harry thinks he’s somehow missed a whole speech.
“Bonsoir,” the boy says, smiling. “I am Florence. The girls ’ave been plotting.”
Sharing the cloak with Malfoy will mean close proximity. With Ron and Hermione it’s fine—he trusts them, they’re his friends, and he’s used to their contact. Malfoy… Not so much. Still, if they’re going to be stupid enough to do this, they both need to be under the cloak. He flicks out one side to throw around Malfoy’s shoulder and pulls the hood over both of their heads.
“It’s unethical!” she insists. Some people were beginning to take a little notice of her near-shrieking, but were obviously and understandably reluctant to join a more active side of the campaign.
“Follow me, please!” calls Professor McGonagall. “First years to the front!”
“Thank you very much!” she grins. “I am Fleur Delacour, it is nice to meet you.”
“Shit.”
Headboy: Snitch
“Glad we’re not them,” Ron mutters.
“Thanks,” Harry mumbles as he’s pulled to his feet and back out into fresh air.
Greckles: <3
lark? They wouldn’t
“I think you should practise summoning your broom, next,” Hermione suggests.
Harry would be hard pushed to miss the lingering glance she throws over her shoulder at them, kind but also sad—no, it’s
Harry licks gravy off his bottom lip and thinks about that, and definitely not his newly understood attraction to his rival. His rival who just admitted he was thinking about going to the ball with a man. Ron makes a choking noise opposite, but otherwise doesn’t say anything.
“What, why do you care? I thought you said we were being silly.”
“Doesn’t it just.”
The Entrance Hall is alive with movement, despite heads of houses sorting their students into relative order. Someone elbows Neville in the side, and Seamus trips over his shoelaces into the back of Hufflepuff seventh-year Beatrice Haywood.
One fear: the roof
Harry watches Fleur climb expertly onto the shoulders of a boy he recognises. He stands up, and she towers over the crowds.
“You are, but… I think this project has been a good thing.”
“Sure, please, go ahead.”
“No,” she laughs, “it’s
By the time Madam Hooch is yelling at them to hurry up and get ready to greet their guests, Harry’s team is winning by a hair. Malfoy is, admittedly, a much better-matched opponent. Both of them have caught the snitch only once.
“Go on, now, go see Madam Pomfrey before you get your scores,” says Professor McGonagall, shooing him away.
“Must’ve taken points for your shoulder and the dragon escaping,” Ron mutters, audibly annoyed.
A slight singing noise slants towards him and Harry looks up in glee. His broom swoops down, and he jumps from the plateau.
that ladies and gentlemen?” Ludo Bagman exclaims. Harry makes a lap around the stadium on his Firebolt. The horntail follows his path, arcing her neck like a black, scaly version of Dudley’s old slinky before it tangled. The chains around her ankles have been set in concrete.
Ron mutters. Harry doesn’t, actually, until Fred glances down towards them.
Hermione chews her lip. “Right from the basics.”
“When’s the next task, mate?” Ron asks Harry.
“What the hell do you think is so important?” Malfoy mutters.
“Been talking to Hermione, have you?”
Bagman looks unsure. “Nobody would know…”
Pansy swoons. “Oh Draco, our saviour!”
Ginny scoffs. “How are you—actually, I don’t care. I want in.”
Bill: none of you are stupid or expendable
“Quidditch?”
Do enjoy!
“I don’t know, Ron. I really don’t.”
“You said yes?” Hermione says, surprisingly disturbed by the idea. “Do you know her?”
“No,” Harry says breathlessly, “thank you. You saved me. God knows what she’s going to write.”
“I said, it’s none of your business!” Malfoy bristles. The hallway goes quiet.
“Serpensortia!” Harry cries again, mentally flicking through any memory he can. A boa appears.

“Don’t worry, don’t worry! I’ll get to all of you very soon. We can’t be leaving anyone out!”
“Hey, Fleur. Are you all right?” She’s trembling, slightly.
“No clue. My bet is, well,
Draco sweeps out his arm, and indeed he may be right. All around them are soft golden faerie lights and thriving rose bushes trimmed around arching pergolas that would have Aunt Petunia green with envy. Snow settles thick on the ground and yet their shoes remain warm and dry, and the same must be said for farther out into the wilderness, as he is fairly certain that he can see Fleur with one of her Beauxbatons friends with their hands all over each other around the back of that shrub. A quick glance over his shoulder confirms that a number of couples haven’t even made it as far as the garden, settling instead for getting handsy on the steps and walkways around the courtyard.
“Oh no,” Harry mutters, spotting red curls approaching from the sidelines. “Percy’s coming. What was that about dancing?”
“And now, Mr Potter if you please!” Bagman’s voice clamours into Harry’s awareness and he looks up and around. The stands, now shield-free, are so full they heave with life. Ludo Bagman is waving him over. They come to a stop near the middle of the stadium to look up.
Behind the door is a small classroom with most of the desks and chairs pushed to the walls. Five have been lined up top-to-tail in front of the whiteboard and covered in red velvet, and the middle of the room is empty. Sitting at one of the desks is Ludo Bagman, who is chatting away to a witch in magenta robes. Fleur, Krum and Cedric are off to the side, talking and laughing pleasantly.
(And apologies for my inability to stop adding or mentioning hogwarts mystery characters... I'm attached.)
Harry rolls his eyes and shoves his log into his bag. “I’ll just… Summarise this, yeah?”
“It’s all part of the charm,” George says, but he’s watching them leave with an odd expression.
“Hmm, yes, and then the individual shots.” Her eyes are still glued, as ever, to Harry.
“House-elves!” she cries, and he winces. “Not
Freckles: thank you Harry <3
He looks around at the tent, but Cedric and Madam Pomfrey are the only ones there.
Greckles: he can at least stop Ron being a prat
now, is it?” George asks, surprising Harry by poking him between the shoulder blades. “Potter keeping secrets for Draco, what a concept!”
“What? Where did you get one of those?” he asks, aghast. “I told them—”
“Or you could always command an army of large snakes, Potter,” Malfoy snorts.
“Course we can,” Harry tells him. “Come on, let’s go right now!”
“What?” Harry yelps, but not before he feels a hand close around his wrist and yank him towards… a direction. There are a lot of people they have to fight their way through, but Harry can’t help but think it’s totally worth the bumping around when the crowd finally spits them back out onto the sidelines. He spends an unashamed few moments with his hands on his knees trying to get his breath back.
“Yeah, um, it’s about the task. Have you seen Fleur today?”
Ronald: is that a uhhhhhhh norwegian ridgeback?
“You’d better do it soon, and then get Granger to help
Leek: ew
“Oh, nothing,” she says, completely unconvincingly. “But what was that about hating him?”
Ginny: don’t
Apparently, Malfoy’s ongoing odd behaviour does not prevent him showing himself up in Hagrid’s last lesson before the half term. Harry, Ron and Hermione snigger among themselves all the way back up to the castle, more for the mortified look on his face than anything else. In the Entrance Hall they found themselves milling at the edges of the large crowd of students gathered there, attention drawn to a large sign providing reception at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron grins at his friends and ruffles their hair in an unappreciated, condescending manner as he cranes his neck to read it.
Harry’s talk with Sirius in the common room is enlightening, to say the least.
“How did it go, ‘Mione?” he asks.
“Er,” she says awkwardly. “I was going to say you dropped your quill.”
Ron has lots of siblings—he’s not the oldest, nor the youngest, nor the one with dragons, nor the Ministry employee, nor a troublemaker. To everyone other than us, he’s just Ron. He doesn’t get much attention at all, and you’re
“You’ll be great.”
Headboy: Percy Weasley
Malfoy tilts his very confused little head. His hair flutters in the breeze.
“I wouldn’t have thought so, from that far away.”
“Snape’s a right bastard, isn’t he?” Ron says, the Saturday before the end of term. “Setting us a test right before we break up—on antidotes! I hope he doesn’t bloody well want to poison us while he’s at it.”
Shaking his head, Malfoy flicks his wand at each one. “Why on Earth you thought this was a good idea…”
George Weasley, Chief Detective >:)
“So, figured out the next task?”
She stands him in the middle of the rug in front of the fireplace and circles him, taking in his baggy jeans and navy jumper and the probably-wrinkled shirt beneath. She lifts the hem just to check, rolling her eyes when he yelps.
