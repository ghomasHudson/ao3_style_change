He didn’t know how long he had been swimming in the darkness when he heard the voice pull him back.
“Okay, can someone please explain? Why can’t we hug you, Harry? Why are Snape and Malfoy here? Why are you calling him Dray?” Hermione quizzed.
They all held their breath as Snape uncorked the vial. Nothing happened. Snape let his tears flow. All of his hope was gone. He buried his face in his husband's chest and cried.
“No. You two are just so cute and it makes me happy. I finally have a family. Now we just need a mom. Father you better get on that.”
Tears leaked out of Harry’s eyes.
“You don’t understand sir. I just did.” She smirked.
“That is true. Well if you are, you can just hang with me. I am a Sytherin, so I can Introduce you to others. If not, pray you don’t end up in Gryffindor. They are nothing but boisterous gits. Worst of all, the Golden Trio is there. I cannot stand them. Granger and Weasley mostly. Potter is less annoying when he is alone, but with those two..” Draco trailed off.
“I know.”
“Please, come back to me. Come on, Harry! Just wake up!”
He went to the dorm to get dressed while Draco took a shower. He sat on his bed and waited.
“Nothing bad I hope? Did you get Lily pad to bed okay?”
Just as they were about to leave Draco stopped Harry in the entrance hall and said, “Harry, you don’t have to go. Death Eaters are still looking for you. I know we have your father, Remus, Tonks, and a few others coming. It still just makes me very nervous. We could just go and get the stuff you need. Bring it and the Weasel and Granger back here. You are five months pregnant, Harry. Think of Lily.”
***************
I'll just be over here hiding....
At the end of the meal, Dumbledore stood and walked to Ron and Hermione. He leaned down and whispered something to them. He then walked back to where he gave his opening speech and began to speak again.
Harry is released from the hospital wing. Nightmares follow.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Draco got married in June after Lily was born. It was relatively small. Just Remus, Snape, Narcissa, Hermione, Luna and Dani came. They did have a seat for Harry’s best
For one of the first times in his teaching career he had gone and hugged a student. He had soothed students before, sure. First years who were home sick. Older students who had family die, but he had never physically interacted with one before. Especially one from a house other than his own.
Snape paused, then sighed. He reached for Harry’s face. He pulled back the fringe covering that infamous scar. Lucius saw it and gasped.
“I know, Love. I know.”
“Wait. Your son that you thought was dead is here? Like, right now? Merlin, Sev. I am so happy you have him back. I know how much that was hurting you even all these years later. So, when can I meet him?” Draco asked excitedly.
“How did that go?”
Draco slept in Aries bed again that night, starting to show a bit of routine.
Harry shook his head. “No father, I’m fine.”
“YOU STOLE EVERYTHING! GIVE ME THE CHILD! SHE IS MINE! MY LORD SAID IT IS SO!”
Snape put his book down. “What is it?”
“Gee, thanks. I’ll remember that when you have kids.” They went out of the room and headed to the port keys to take them all back to the castle. Eager to see what the school year could bring.

All three looked at each other before entering the hall. All eyes turned to them.

A special thanks to nineorfour for the Idea for the of the ending to the chapter!!
“I was wondering when you would get here. Miss Granger said you were called. Are you ok?” Snape’s voice rattled him in the silence.
“Okay, why would I not like that? You know I like most Ravenclaws.”
Pansy looked at him then laughed. “Oh, I like you.”
.” Aries hissed.
Hermione immediately raised her hand.
YEAR 11: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS), MAGICAL EXHAUSTION, BRUISED ESOPHAGUS, MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
Suddenly the hold on him tightened.
“Yes, love. Now we need to get you to bed. We have classes tomorrow.”
“I am so sorry, Harry. You have to be quiet.” Draco whispered.
“Professor, we can’t do that. It is illegal to give your students truth serum.”
He lifts one of Harry’s legs over his shoulder and positioned himself at the entrance.  He locks eyes with Harry and pushes gently but steadily. He bottomed out quickly, knowing Harry is very impatient.
She turned and plopped on the couch followed by Draco. The little head bobbed up and down.
“OK, I’m Jane Trenchble.”
His eyes flutter open and he looked for the source of the soothing voice. Severus Snape sat next to him on the bed.
“Dani, love, I’m ok. I just had a little accident. We just wanted to make sure Lily was ok.”
“Harry?” A small voice spoke up.
Harry sighed, sat down on the couch, and clasped his hand around his stomach. “Okay, first, I don’t even know if I am having a shower. Second, you have two options. You can either let me pick and the other get mad or you can put your two smart brains together and figure out the obvious solution. You are both at the top in every class, figure it out. Lily agrees.” He points to his stomach.
“Draco is not a death eater and this baby is not ‘death eater spawn’. This is MY baby not anyone else’s. MY baby. Lily is MY baby. I am seven months along. She is about ten inches long. She is getting eyelids. She has taste buds, eyelashes, eyebrows, hair, a mouth, fingers, and toes. She is a human being. Don’t act like she is rubbish that needs to get thrown out.” Harry was crying now, but not backing down.
Snape ignored him and pulled a couple hairs from his head. He uncorked the vial he had run to get. He threw them both into the potion. Closed it and shook.
Draco walked to the bed and went to kiss Harry. He felt nothing but cold fabric. His heart paused.
“Harry, are you sure? We can always come back later. After you’ve had Lily.”
“Everything. The good. The bad. The ugly. However, It is so worth it.”
“Yeah, she finally crashed from her sugar high.”
You are making my cry at your comments. All happy tears, but still... I love you guys!
He apperated straight to Potter’s house and knocked on the door. A small pale woman answers.
“Yes.” Draco blushed.
His arm was broken in two places. His nose was shattered and his glasses had actually pierced his eyes. The only way Snape could heal him was to heal him completely. Either
“Only if you call me Draco.” He said with a smile. They shook hands and Hermione faced Harry. “Am I allowed to hug you now?” Harry just smiled and nodded.
“Fine. Snape gave birth to me. He is married to my father. You might know him actually. His birth name is Tom Riddle, but you might know him better by his alias. Voldemort.”
“He went into labor on the way here. Ginny is taking him to Poppy. We have got to go.”
“ How about you? Tell me about you.”
Please review!!
“Harry, you might be in labor! We need to get you to Poppy.”
“Well. However, homesickness is no joke. Twelve first years have either broken down and cried or said how they miss their parents. One is all together refusing to speak. Maybe you could talk to her, Harry. Her name is Danica Dursley. Do you know her? Is she related to your Aunt and Uncle?” Hermione replied.
The first thing Harry noticed as he regained consciousness was the pain. His head, wrists, shoulder, stomach, and jaw. There may have been more, but those hurt enough that he couldn’t notice others.
“Well they can’t exactly disapprove, can they? What about you? Any girls you have your eye on?”
“What? Kneazle got your tongue?” Ron taunted.
“He always favors the Gryffins. It is disgusting and detrimental to the other houses. He wonders why so many Slytherins turn to your father. Well? That is because he treats them better than they ever are here.”
“Yes of course, my boy. Just remember what I said.”
Snape pointed his wand and Aries hair was immediately dried. Together they walked three doors away and Snape knocked. Aries stayed just out of sight.
“Malfoy, we are going to be spending a lot of time together. Please call me Hermione.”
The portrait serving as a door swung open.
I'm sooooooo sorry! I promise it will get better. I bawled writing this one...
They pulled off his shirt and started working on his trousers. Tom had them pulled to the child’s knees when he froze. Snape saw the hesitation and questioned it.
“Dragon, I have never and will never support my insane husband in his quest to rid the world of people other than purebloods. That is just idiotic. I never cared about that stuff. I just did what I had to do to keep you safe. You are what matters. If Harry Potter makes you happy then he is my family, too. I love you, my Dragon.” She replied calmly.
“Ah, Weasley. Did you finally decide to ditch the blood traitors and join us?” Draco said with obvious disdain.
Vincent got red. “Gr-Greg.” Greg had a bit of a smile on his face.
Draco smiled over at Harry and grabbed his hand under the table. Harry blushed and smiled back. Hermione looked over at the couple with a knowing raised eyebrow. Harry just whispered, "Later."
With that Dumbledore left.
They ran to the wing and pushed the doors open. The room was empty.
“That would fit my theory then.” Snape then looked at Harry. “Harry, are you sure about keeping the child, with who his other father is?”
“Your father thought it was a great idea. I do not believe he will be able to, but it would be nice to have reassurance. If you are ready we can go now.”
Luna And Hermione had gotten married almost a year after them. Luna was currently pregnant with their first son. They had used a sperm donor and planned to have Hermione have the next one with the same donor.
Harry shrugged and laid back while they planned. He hadn’t meant to fall asleep, but after the day's activities he was exhausted.
Harry laughed, Draco groaned, and Hermione shrugged, taking another bite of her ice cream.
He couldn’t believe they were blaming him. He already blamed himself for everything that had happened. He had just hoped they wouldn’t.
Draco suddenly jerked back. “What? Harry, say that again.”
“Of course I will. I am still not satisfied. Who knows what will happen next time.”
Harry nodded. Pressure building in his chest.
“My throat hurts, but I’m used to it. Please explain to me what you just said? How am I your son? You and who else? You said you were my mother, so who is my father? Who are Lily and James then? I just have a lot of questions, but start with why Malfoy is here and who that is.”
“I don’t think so, Tom. You may have helped create MY daughter, but she is mine. You will never see her.” Harry pointed his wand and Tom’s eyes went wide. Several wands pointed at Harry.
“And you are ok with it then?” Draco asked slowly.
“Amazing. However finding out your father is the Dark Lord Voldemort can be a bit wild.”
They all flowed back into the conversation they were having before and talked until the train ground to a halt.
“I see. Very well. Just do it here. It will be easier to kill him after.”
“Of course, Mother.” With that Snape left the two boys alone.
After Harry left the hospital, Draco never left his side. He said it was for protection, but Harry didn’t mind being close to him.
He asked Harry his opinion and came up with a plan.
“Let’s go. We just jump.” Aries joked.
Harry hugged his father and said, “Of course I’ll wear it, thank you. I know I am welcome there. You have made absolute sure of that. I’m going to go to the tower and catch up with what I missed from Hermione. Her and I will tease Draco without mercy until we pee ourselves from laughing. Goodnight Father.”
Draco laughed.”Of course he isn’t here. Fumbledick’s favoritism is showing.”
They drew back and looked into each other's eyes. Neither wanted to break the silence of the perfect moment.
Draco was sitting next to Harry feeling the same sense of dread.
“You know what? I am done. I am not leaving. I am not going back to the Dursleys. I am NOT getting rid of MY daughter! You can go fuck yourself with your wand if you think that is going to happen!” Harry knew he was shouting, but he didn’t care. “You have been a manipulative son of a bitch from day one and I am done listening to your bullshit.”
Severus Snape loved his summers. No brats to teach. No grading papers. No Albus Dumbledore. No Harry Potter.
“I am sorry. I had to get him out. He is almost dead. I will explain everything I know. Until then, I need to heal him. Please Lucius?” Severus Snape never begged, but he was getting extremely close.
A loud sob broke up the moment. They both looked to Harry who was crying on Draco’s shoulder. Draco was doing everything to try to calm him down.
“No. He won’t hurt me. He can’t. He wouldn't chance Lily. He wants her.”
Harry gulped hard then nodded and Snape took off to work. Healing his shoulder, wrist, legs, chest, and other injuries. While that was happening he took in his surroundings. He was at the hospital wing in Hogwarts.
The next day after classes just before dinner, Snape went to the edge of the Hogwarts wards and apperated to a familiar street. He knocked on the door to number four Privet Drive. A large teen answered the door.
Yes, the reference in the last chapter was Percy Jackson. Shout out to the two who commented that they got it!
Aries finally met Cissy and they hit it off immediately. Draco was always mad at his mother for ‘stealing’ Aries from him. He had pouted all the way to the train.
“He isn’t here either, but I did find the ferret.”
Snape placed the child on the bed and immediately ran diagnostic spells over him. He started to work on the internal injuries first. He could deal with the rest later. The worst of the internal was a broken rib punctured his left lung causing the blood in the boy’s mouth he had seen earlier.
“You know maybe I underestimated you, Granger.” Draco said, trying to gain back his breath.
Draco calmly walked to the basement doors. When he got to the bottom he heard the scream. He ran to Harry.
“That isn’t true! He knocked into me. Not the other way around!” Ron yelled back.
“You did.” A weak croaking voice sounded. "Do you know how many times I could have died without you?”
“They are living at my house and Sev is my godfather. It would be kind of hard not to notice.” He chuckled.
“I can go with Harry. Draco sent me to see what was taking so long. You go tell Draco and I’ll take Harry.” A new voice chimed in.
“Wait. Voldemort? My father is Voldemort? Okay.” Harry said surprisingly calmly.
“Well if that is the case, I know the sex. Do you want to know?” Draco replied somewhat relieved.
“Yes sir. Completely. May I be excused? Malfoy wanted to study.” Aries spit out the name even though it hurt him to do so.
He didn’t even bother to look up and hid behind his book to hide the laughter that was trying to escape.
“Yes. It is about time I did.”
YEAR 5: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS AND HANDS), CONCUSSION, BROKEN WRIST(LEFT), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
“I will promise to think about it.”
“You had several lacerations, all of which I healed. Unfortunately most were too deep to not scar, like the ones on your wrist. Many bruises, all gone. Dislocated shoulder, broken femur and tibia, several broken ribs, concussion, and broken jaw. I have healed almost everything.”
Snape knew many things, one of those being, he had to help Harry. Even if only for Lily. In that moment he looked to the sky to ask Lily for her guidance. He felt a sudden warmth course through his body and then knew what he had to do.
“Yes, but it is time, so go.”
“I am Severus Snape. A potions professor at Hogwarts. I am the man that got your nephew away from this hell hole. I am the man who adopted him. I am the man who is lucky enough for him to call his father. Now, I am telling you one final time, SIGN THE PAPERS!”
“We could play chess.”
Snape smirked, but simply said, “I’ll be right back.” With that he turned out of the room leaving Harry with thoughts of the life growing inside him. Suddenly muffled, voices caught his attention.
Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry This story isn't up to me. It is up to my fingers and keyboard. I control neither...
“Harry?” Snape looked to the bed and saw two emeralds. “Har-Harry? How do you feel? Any pain?”
Snape immediately had Harry move the girl to a chair where Snape began to look her over. “Dani, my name is Severus Snape. I adopted Harry when he was fourteen. I know what his life was like at your home due to his magic. I understand you don’t know me but I need to ask you some questions. Ok?” The little girl looked at Harry who nodded and smiled.
Aries went to the cupboard for the ingredients and was almost done when he was suddenly knocked into, pushing two vials to the floor. They broke on impact and mixed together. Aries pushed whoever knocked into him into the corner and put a shield around the spill. Not a second later it exploded. Snape rushed in.
“Ok, just stop yelling. I have a headache.” Harry groaned.
“Well, love, things are different here than they are at home. I am having a baby.”
“You-You will?”
Harry nodded again relaxing into the pillows. Not realizing how tired he had been, he fell asleep with the word, WE, still hanging in the air.
“Are you sure this is where it is, Aries? You do realize we are in the girl’s loo?” Draco asked.
Vernon crawled to the table and quickly signed the papers.
“I’ll go truth.”
Draco grabbed his hand and said, “maybe it would be better to just show them, Harry?” Harry nodded and stood, all eyes on him. He took off the glamour first, then his robe. Hermione gasped and put her hand to her mouth. Ron’s face turned dark red.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Dani stayed in the common room right until Harry had to leave to get to his room before curfew. As he closed the portrait he heard whispering. Assuming it is a couple trying to get privacy he continued on. He only made it a few steps before he heard, “
“I was just wondering where Draco is. I wanted to see if he could tell who I was. If anybody would be able to, it would be him. You can’t hate somebody for six years and not know exactly what they look like.”
“Hermione, be reasonable. You don’t even know the full story.” Draco replied calmly.
! “ Vernon started screaming. “Now I have just made it feel as if your blood is on fire. Are you ready to sign?
Aries waved his hand again and Draco felt a cool sensation of lube run through him. Aries immediately went about preparing Draco. By the time he had three fingers in use, Draco was a writhing mess.
“And me.” Said another,
“Not where my son is concerned. Now tell me about the meeting.”
Harry placed a hand on his swollen stomach, still worried, and pressed down slightly. He felt a nudge back on his hand. His worries immediately lifted. Pomfrey came in and checked him over. She told him he had to stay for a few days, but he was going to be fine. He had only fractured his cheekbone and broken two ribs. One of his lesser injuries.
“It was Salazar Slytherin’s snake and it is female. So, why not?”
“Harry, all my feelings went out the window with what he just said. You were my friend first. I wasn’t kidding when I said, I am here for you. Plus, have you seen his freckled arse? I don’t want to see that for the rest of my life anyway. I told my parents I am spending the rest of the break at the castle and that is what I intend to do. I still don’t trust Snape and Malfoy all that much, so I need them to prove I should trust them.” Harry knew there was no sense talking her out of it.
Sorry this a month late!! SMUT warning!!
Halfway there Dani asked Harry about the wizarding world. Harry answered what he could and Draco answered what he couldn’t. When they reached the doors, Harry paused then knocked. He said the password and they entered. Snape swooped in and looked down at the girl.
“Harry? Harry? Are you here?” Silence was his only reply. He ran to the door and out. Directly to Snape’s room. He pounded on the door. After five minutes of no answer, his heart paused again. That could only mean one thing.
Aries laughed as Draco screamed the entire way down, but caught him anyway.
“We are doing potions that require partners for the first section. I have chosen them. As I call them out, move to them. Granger, Parkinson. Weasley, Goyle. Longbottom, Bulstrode. Greengrass, Finnegan. Malfoy, Snape.”
Aries sat back down. Ignoring the redhead.
“This is the part where you say hello back.” He whispered in Draco’s ear.
“Ginny. This is my daughter. Tom wasn’t even the father. Draco is. You are not taking my baby.” Harry replied in a soothing tone.
Tom just grabbed his hand and pulled him over. He pointed to Harry’s knee. There was a spot there that was darker than the rest of the skin surrounding it.
He kneeled.
“Mommy said you died. She said you had gone and gotten yourself killed. Why did you leave me?” She cried.
It was the next Saturday night after when things got interesting.
“I am pregnant.”
“She was in minor distress for a while, but she will be ok. Your magic protected her. I am going to get Pomfrey.” Harry nodded and Draco left.
“Boys, you do remember that you are not alone, correct?” Snape said, making Draco blush and Aries chuckle.
When Harry was released he was able to remain at Hogwarts due to his condition. Dumbledore didn't think muggles would handle a pregnant male too well. Going into an empty Gryffindor tower was something Harry had hardly ever done. Draco coming into the common room with him had never happened.
“Good. I was so worried. Look, I have class, so I have to go. I will see you later though.” She said.
“Goodnight, Harry. I’m here if you need anything. Harry nodded already half asleep.
“Students! As many of you have noticed, we are missing one student this year. Harry Potter has been removed for his own safety and is being given private instruction. Now, first years, follow your prefects back to your houses.”
After dropping a immensely cheered up little girl off at Gryffindor Tower, the boys went back to the dungeons. They were at Harry’s new room when Harry asked Draco, “can you stay? I don’t want to be alone.”
Snape stood there, mouth agape. Next thing Harry knew he was being wrapped in his father’s long arms.
“Some weird Muggle promise?” Draco questioned. Harry just nodded and with that they left.
Aries slipped up the other body and kissed Draco deeply. He positioned himself and pushed in. Draco moaned in a low voice. He pushed back with his hips, signaling Aries to not stop.
Aries looked at Draco who smirked at him and nodded.
“I know what you mean.”
Hermione squealed and went to run to hug Harry when Draco stopped her.
“Well, why don’t we get to breakfast in the Great Hall? Minnie will be dying to see you better.” Snape said.
“Well, I guess you won’t have to blood adopt her like we planned.”
“Blaise. Pansy. I have been here since I boarded.” Draco responded.
“There will be no next time. If he so much as looks at Harry funny, I will hex him until his own mother won’t recognize him.” Draco was seething.
“I am so incredibly proud that you are in my house. How was the train? Any problems?”
“So what happened at the meeting?” Harry asked.
Chapter 12
“Of course, love. I just remembered I have to go meet with someone. I will be back later.” He responded.
Pansy came to her senses and shot him a look. “You knew?” she demanded.
Draco was on his bed reading a book in nothing but boxers. The dorm was empty otherwise.
Aries turned to look at who pushed him and groaned. “Sorry, sir. Weasley pushed me causing the flobberworm mucus and powdered ashwinder egg to fall out of my hands. They broke on the floor and mixed. I put a shield up before it blew up.”
"Your only living relatives were the Durselys, who were just as horrible as Bellatrix. They locked you ina cupboard under the stairs and made you their personal slave. When you finally got your Hogwarts letter, they hid it from you and didn't let you go."
There were a small fireplace and a radiator, and a small wooden coffee table in the middle of the furniture's strategic placement. Percy was back and placing a tea tray in front of Draco on the table.
Hermione skipped some photos going to her and Ron's wedding. Harry was Rons' best man, they were getting ready, and each had a beer in their hands, smiling into the camera.
"How did your visit with the kids go?" The blonde asked, looking back up to Harry. Harry shrugged and looked back at Draco. Today he was wearing skinny-legged black trousers with a dark evergreen cloured button-down, he wore a black cardigan over the top of that, and the same green coloured blazer over that.
As always, happy reading and much love,
"I guess, usually, you don't wait up for me." Draco laughed slightly.
Harry rolled his eyes as the blonde retook his position in his armchair.
"Why did we get married?" Draco scoffed and poured the brown liquid into the pot. "Mutal love for one another, I'd say." He stirred then turned to look at Harry. Leaning back, he crossed his arms. "Why do you think?"
Pulling the papers out and flipping to the first page that needed his signature, he patted around his coat for a pen. Delving into his inside coat pocket, he pulled out what he thought was a pen.
"I can accompany you if you'd like." Percy offered, holding his arm out to the man.
It wasn't technically illegal what they had just done, but now, looking at the sleeping boy on his chest, he thought he should just go turn himself in to the police right now.
I would also like to address some things that seemed the main topics.
"Fine." Draco nodded, taking a sip of whatever was in his glass, and then looked back down to his book.
Billion took Harry into his arms gently, "Harry, we love each other, remember, you used to come over all the time and we-" He paused then and pulled away from Harry. Right about the time Harry had narrowed his eyes, Draco walked in, carrying the Lilly's in a crystal vase, primed neatly.
As they went to bed, Ackley pulled Harry close and hugged him tightly, Harry hugged the boy back and placed a kiss against his forehead.
When Draco got home later that night, Harry greeted him in the kitchen. He was taking a pain potion and downed the whole thing in one go.
Harry sat silent for a few moments then exclaimed, "Tell me I'm not a horrible human being who took advantage of a child, none the less a child who is currently my sons' age!" Draco smiled.
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/open-gently/201310/36-questions-bring-you-closer-together#:~:text=%2036%20Questions%20to%20Bring%20You%20Closer%20Together,sing%20to%20yourself%3F%20To%20someone%20else%3F%20More%20
Hopefully, this was his study.
"I'm sorry, what did you say?" Harry was squinting at the man, trying to keep Ron out of his mind.
Pulling Harry's trousers off he stood and undid his own. This was always the way it was, hasty and too quick. The other man slid into Harry forcefully, it shot pain through Harry's veins but also awoke something deep in his mind that wanted him to scream for more.
"You know, I'm not exactly sure." Harry moved forward and leaned against the vanity. Reaching out, he touched the blonde's elbow, who turned to look at him.
"I mean, it's warm and cosy, and in the middle of the country, I just, I don't know, it's not home yet I suppose." Draco nodded and opened his pad of paper.
Just a reminder, things that are in
"I hope you like Cornish Pasterys and Shepherds Pie." Draco giggled, and his grip on Percy's hand went slightly tighter. Percy smiled warmly at Draco and began leading him through the restaurant.
"I don't feel that way, I got up this morning and nearly took my skin off cleaning myself, just to get his touch off me." Draco smiled again and clicked his pen open.
Draco smiled softly and crossed his legs. "Are you upset with Ginny for choosing to terminate your marriage?" Draco still had a ghost of a wry smile on his face.
"Hello Draco, is Harry around?" Standing, Harry left the living room. Sliding open the french doors, he saw Billion. He had a bouquet of white Lillys in his hand and was still dressed in his Auror uniform."Billion?" Harry went and stood beside Draco. Looking over the blonde's sceptical face, Harry invited the man in. Draco took the flowers and moved into the kitchen while Billion and Harry went back into the living room.
As always, much love and happy reading,
Since their last visit, Draco had rearranged his bookshelf. When had Harry's mind become so consumed with the bookshelf and how he had it organized? When had Harry become so enamoured with knowing who was in the pictures sitting on his desk and when they were changed?
Draco was fumbling with Harry's buttons, slowly undoing them as Harry peppered the man in kisses, careful not to leave a mark. This was not his first time sleeping with a married man.
Huffing, Draco slowly rolled Harry from his shoulder and left the bed. Leaving the bedroom, he went back out into the kitchen and poured another glass of whiskey.
"Has Ginny spoken to you?" Harry nodded and took another sip of his tea. Draco's long fingers were wrapped around the warm mug and his silver band reflected the light of the fire. Harry couldn't help himself from looking for it. Draco had said his marriage had been falling apart and ever since Harry waited for the day he would look over his lithe hands and find no silver band reflecting the nearest light.
"You...ate lots of hotdogs?" Harry guesses. She shakes her head. "You..." He stops to think, looking around the room, "had a slumber party, and you made a bet that whoever fell asleep first had to eat a lot of hotdogs when you woke, and you lost?"
Harry sat on Draco's side of the bed, awaiting Draco's return. When Draco came out of his closet, he jumped and grabbed onto the jam.
Harry began kissing the blonde then, kissing all the places there were sure to be bruises tomorrow. Draco just laid there, closing his eyes, getting his breathing under control. Once Harry was done kissing all the bruising places, he came up to Draco's mouth.
"I think that would be your grandparents, a friend of mine was actually betrothed to your mother but when they snitched they broke up." Harry paused while he sugared his tea.
"I think its the latter." Draco scoffed and sat back in his chair.
"What do you mean by 'that far'?"
"Draco!" Percy said, shock etched all over his face. "What's the matter?" Draco smirked and sighed, stepping back so Percy could step out. He thought about his next words carefully.
"Does this surprise you?" Harry shrugged, climbing into bed.
So, I woke up to more kudos and comments this morning! Thank you all for the love, you have no idea how much it means to me!
"If you would have just kept flipping, you would have found one." Handing Harry the album there, they were. In the same room as the other.
Ackley sighed and moved into the guest bedroom, bidding Harry goodnight. As soon as the door was closed, Harry cursed himself for letting it get this far.
Draco's long legs were crossed and his foot was mindlessly tapping at the air. He had a smile on his face and his pen was touched to the blank page. Harry's eyes were on the bookshelf behind him.
"R-Ron," Harry choked out, "I'm so close." Ron didn't respond, only kept at his abusive pace.
It was in the middle of the city and nice, but it didn't look like anything a Malfoy would live in. Quickly making his way up the path he knocked on the door. He heard someone shuffling inside and eventually the door opened.
When they were just shy of the front garden, Percy bent and picked a flower from the ground. He handed it to Draco with a faint smile.
"What's happened?" Harry raised his brows and took a sip of water.
, he is the key witness to my main case right now." Draco feel into his armchair and raised an eyebrow. "Also, did you just happen to come into a very large inheritance of jumpers?"
"I had a thought, you said that your original last name is Avery, right?" He nodded but continued with the tea. "You might be too young for this, but when the War was going on, the Avery family snitched on the Dark Lord."
TW: Divorce
"You've known the whole time?" Percy whispered, leaning in closer to Draco. Draco smiled slightly and nodded.
So, the families listed here, I'm not sure about all of them. I know they were all part of the Sacred 28, but I'm not sure if they all got the dark mark or even if they died...so, just pretend.
Percy smiled at Draco and stood from the hill they were sitting on. Dusting himself off, he offered Draco a hand, which he took. Once they were both standing, they made their way back towards Percy's home.
"I don't drink." The blonde looked down into his cup, "It's good that you listened to their advice, children who grow up in homes where there is constant fighting tend to mix healthy relationships with bad ones." Draco paused and held the cup tighter.
Finally, he moved over to the leather armchair opposite Harry, tugging the legs of his trousers up he sat. His dress socks brought back the yellow Harry remarked, watching as the man crossed his legs.
I'm not sure why it keeps messing up the formatting, I've tried fixing it on my laptop and phone, yet, it stays the same. So sorry 'bout that!
"What about it?" Harry ran a hand over it, then he took a finger and traced one of the slashes.
"Why?" Harry asked, looking back down to his mug.
TW:  Infidelity and divorce
"Oh! It's nice to finally put a name to the face. I've heard all about you." Theodore moved aside and let Harry in.
"Nymphadora married Remus Lupin, and together they had Teddy Lupin, which is your Godson." He stood then and put his mug in the sink. "Back to the Blacks, Narcissa, my mother, married Lucius Malfoy, my father, he comes from another substantial pure-blood family." Draco sighed, then continued. "When you went into the forest, killing off the last Horcrux, my mother is the one who lied when asked if you were dead."
Drarryandmycat!
He felt Dracos hand run through his hair. "Harry." He throbbed out, before he could finish Harry placed his lips back to Draco's, kissing him deeply.
The man. Harry had guessed wrong, he thought the man wasn't a spouse just an old friend, yet here Draco was, handing him a picture of the man. He was handsome and looked nothing like Draco.
"If I tell you, it will only make it worse, alright?" Harry rolled his eyes and slouched back in the stool.
The raven-haired man nodded and pulled a slip of paper from his pocket. He handed it to Draco who thanked him and unfolded the small slip.
Harry went over his conversation with Ackley again and again, over what the boy was wearing, how he acted, but nothing new came to mind. Closing the case file he stood and walked over to get his coat.
"We first met at Madame Malkins, a robe shop. I was slightly crass and rude, so you didn't talk to me much. Hagrid showed you to Platform 9 3/4, where you met Mrs Weasley and the Weasley children."
"How was work? You must be pretty busy what with you having to stay late every single night." Harry nodded and yawned.
"It was lovely, thank you for asking. Did the kids appreciate a Christmas with the both of you still?" Harry nodded and sat back in the chair, bringing his left ankle up to rest on the knee of his right leg.
"See, not flinching." Then he pressed a soft kiss to the other man's mouth.
He could remember hearing as Draco screamed and pleaded for them to stop, to stop touching him, to stop hurting him. He could remember Draco coming into the dungeons later that night, hands shaky as he handed Luna a plate of food.
Drarryandmycat!
"I don't know anything about your family line other than Lily Potter, nee Evan I think, she was a muggle-born, she married James Potter, and together they had you."
"Have you and Ginny talked since the signing of the papers?" Draco uncrossed his legs instead crossing them at the ankles.
Much love and happy reading,
"Dumbledore found a way found that though, sending Hagrid to fetch you." Draco stopped there and took a deep breath.
"As much as I wish I could continue, I can't trust myself to just end it at a kiss." He finally said, Harry fell back into his chair and closed his eyes.
Wicked Game- Ursine Vulpine
Also the layout is messed up again! I DON'T KNOW WHY IT KEEPS DOING THAT!
"Nothing has happened, sometimes couples find solace in talking to each other," The blonde paused for a moment, "I just wondered if you had." Draco wrote something on his sheet of paper and then reconsidered Harry.
When they were washing dishes together Ackley restruck up their conversation. "If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?"
Ron appeared from his little hole in the wall, and stuck his head out to ask, “Did somebody say cheese?” In the next second the camera flashed, and Ron was seeing spots everywhere from the light.
Founder of the D.A.
“But, Harry, Madame will be so worried. Are you sure we can’t get home tonight?” Draco asked, worrying aloud.
“You know, uhh…not exactly your type, Draco. Maybe we’d better find another place, huh?” Harry said, even as the kittens, energy replenished at the sound of jazz music, ran past the adults and into the window of Potter’s house.
In this big old world,
Prince of my potions class,
“Now be careful, children.” Draco reminded them lovingly.
“Ahhh!” Lucius screamed as he stood up on his bike, trying to get some distance between himself and the angry dog. Then an “OW!” as Sirius bit him in the butt, clearly standing hadn’t been his best idea.
Harry settled in to watch Draco groom his face fur, making it stick out handsomely in just the right way. He stopped that verse and just smiled down at the white cat. Harry rested his head on his paws as he got comfortable. Unbeknownst to Draco or Harry, the kittens had woken up and were eagerly watching from their basket bed.
“We’re on holiday.” George explained.
“Gee, Scorpius, why did you have to fall off the bridge?” Albus asked crankily.
Or home-sweet-home in Paris,
“It’s creme de la creme a la Lucius.” Scorpius answered.
James smiles at her relief, glad to not be in trouble. Though part of him wonders if his dad will say something to him about this incident later. But Madame is laughing and happy and that is all that really matters to them. Draco is too busy checking on Narcissa to worry about his son’s shenanigans in the moment and he smiles and purrs happily as he realizes she is truly happy. He cuddles into her arms as she speaks to her friend and confidant.
"You really hate the Malfoys that much?" Ackley didn't budge from where he was standing, so Harry got up. "He is a reformed death eater, and you still hold prejudice against him?"
Draco smiled slightly then checked the time again. "Well, that's our session."
"Andromeda was the middle daughter, my mother being the eldest. She got married to Ted Tonks; he was a muggle-born, which means he didn't have pure blood, so she was also disowned. She had a child, her name ins Nymphadora Tonks, she was an Auror and part of the Order of the Phoenix."
A small white flower donned his lapel and he had finished the look off with black dress shoes, "Oh?" Draco nodded and looked back over the crowd.
Instead, he let Ron kiss his cheek and leave, using his wand to lock the door behind the other man.
"Why didn't we have children?" Draco looked up from his book. Raising his eyebrows, he shrugged.
So, here's the list.
"How so?" Harry asked, looking the blonde in the eyes.
"Yes, we had dinner together a few days ago." Harry didn't mean to come off distant or stand-offish, but he had. He noticed Draco's change of face. "Sorry, I was just...thinking was all." Draco nodded and wrote something down.
She smiles and picks the child up, sitting her next to Harry gently. Draco takes off his satchel and is in the process of taking off his raincoat.
"The one with you and that bloke," Harry pointed with his head to the picture that, if you were sitting at the desk, you would be facing. "I'm guessing he's not a spouse but someone dear, someone you haven't spoken to in a very long time." Harry finished putting emphasis on his last words.
"Don't get so worked up, I'm here on business, I want to know if you have any files of the Sacred 28." That only seemed to make him more upset.
"What's going on in that head of yours Harry, let me in."  Draco had lent forward and had pleading eyes.
Moving into the kitchen, he slowly slid onto a stool, throwing his head in his hands, and slowly rubbed at his temples. Pushing down on his eyes, he remembered Draco lying on the bathroom floor, slowly bleeding out.
Percy sat across from him and poured Draco a glass.
Harry guessed that this was Theodore and gods, did he look even better in person.
"Um, I believe it was to my daughter, Lily, a few years ago when she still wanted to be sung to sleep." Ackley seemed to be thinking about Harry's answer.
He could remember the lie Draco told to save Harry. He can remember how horribly Draco was treated by Greyback and Voldermort. He could hear his husband screams all the way in the dungeons.
He really couldn't, really shouldn't.
"No, I'm perfectly fine, plus, you're not supposed to be analyzing me off the clock," Harry peered down to the watch that sat on his left wrist, "And it seems to me like you are definitely off the clock."
"A mission went sideways, got hit by a Crucio was all." Draco sighed and plopped down on one of their stools.
"Hi, I'm Harry Potter, is Draco around?" Draco must have talked about Harry because Theodores face dawned with realization at the name.
"Would you like a glass of tea?" Percy asked suddenly, not wanting Draco to go. Draco smiled and nodded, and Percy stood aside to let him in.
She giggled and shook her head again.
Draco had set Harry down on the end of the bed and had calmed him down, giving him a glass of water. Draco sat beside him and rubbed his back gently.
"Yes, thank you," Draco responded, stripping off his long coat, and scarf. Slipping his gloves off he shoved them in his coat pockets then he draped his coat and scarf neatly from the back of the nearest chair.
He can remember Draco and his first kiss. He could remember when he first met Billion. He could remember the Yule Ball. He could remember Draco holding him close when he had nightmares early on in their relationship.
Harry shook his head violently, "No, of course not, Draco just brought it up at our last session and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it."
Harry’s green eyes sparkled in the sunlight as he jumped from the ground onto the bridge above where Draco stood transfixed, watching this gorgeous cat in awe. Harry pranced about a narrow beam on the side of the bridge as he continued his song.
Draco and Harry kept dancing for a while longer, enjoying the rhythm and the ability to unwind after some very intense few days. The kittens were all dancing around or watching the band cats dance and play instruments, enthralled. Pans Cat and her gang were playing away, lost in the music and loving every second of it. Suddenly, Draco noticed a harp, and decided that was a sign to try and wind them all back down. He knew that his little travel group was exhausted after all, so Draco sat at the harp and started to pluck at the strings with his claws.
“Now, this is no time to turn chicken.” Sirius started to walk backwards while speaking, and soon, Remus had managed to walk under the bigger dog. Sirius hadn’t realized it and kept walking backwards, one of his paws stepping on the end of Remus’s ear. Remus started trying to pull his poor ear free while Sirius, still oblivious to his friend’s plight, started to speak again.
“But…oh, you…Why that…sneaky, crooked, no-good husbutler!” Ron shouted between spitting out seeds.
“Oh, and thank you so much for offering us your home. Oh. I mean, your pad,” Draco corrected himself. Annoyed at his lack of visual, Scorpius climbed out of bed and into the newly vacated window. “It’s very nice,” Draco complimented from his spot atop the chimney.
“Oh boy, an alley cat!” Albus exclaimed.
Harry had been relaxing on his back when the truck stopped. Though he tried to grab onto the pickup bed, the momentum proved to be too great, and he went flying through the back window, landing on the driver’s face. Harry was screeching and yowling loudly in his shock and fear, eyes wild and his poor fur standing up on end. His tail had fluffed out to three times its normal size by the time the truck finally stopped. Harry looked down and his face became one of horror when he realized that he was sitting on the woman’s head.
Lucius stood up quickly, planning to capture the cats and hide them before their racket got Narcissa’s attention. Standing up and walking was far harder than expected though because Ron had tied his shoes. Lucius went from standing to nearly falling on his face to hopping about like a kangaroo. “Uh why!” Lucius exclaimed as he jumped a few more times before falling face down on the carpet. Ron ran by him unseen, as quickly as he could.
“Yes, Papa.”
Dean’s partner sat nearby on a piano stool, ready to play more music as soon as Pans gave him his cue. The piano cat,Seamus, a Siamese, was known for being rather talkative and a little fiery. The third cat on the bed,Neville, is brown and plays the concertina while wearing a green hat and a red and white bandanna. The last cat of the gang was Blaise. He was almost as big as Pansy, and similarly-coloured, though his shoulders were broader. He played the double bass on a stool next to Seamus.
Harry stood up first, offering his hand to the blond who readily accepted. They grabbed their stuff, Harry quickly put the stone he had found in the side of his bag, and they walked out of the grotto, through the curtain of water and sat outside in the warm sun. When they started to get too hot, both men apparated back to the top of the water slide, eager to go again. Harry sat down first and patted his lap at Draco, wanting to hold his boyfriend this time. Draco rolled his eyes at the cuteness but sat down on Harry’s lap as suggested. Wanting to add to the intimacy, Draco turned to face Harry as he sat, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and toying with the man’s dark hair. Harry’s emerald eyes lit up as they locked onto Draco’s silver ones. Both men smiled at each other before sharing a sweet, gentle kiss. Draco pushed his lips harder against Harry’s, suddenly needing Harry like oxygen.
“Now, now, darlings, cheer up,” Draco replied gently. “Mr. Potter knows a place where we can stay tonight.”
“Your favorite dish, prepared in a very special way.” Lucius told the cats as he set down the loaded tray. It’s creme de la creme de a la Lucius. Sleep well…I mean, eat well, of course.” Lucius stammered as he bowed himself out of the door.
“Don’t do that!” Harry yelled, accidentally letting go of the vine in the process so that he started to sink immediately.
Harry moaned at Draco’s excitement, stopping on his way back down to lick Draco’s tip as if it was a lollipop. Draco’s cries filled Harry’s ears and he felt his cock twitch in excitement almost in time with Draco’s. Harry kept going, working Draco’s cock up and down, loving the way the blond twitched under him. Not wanting to finish too soon, Draco pulled harder on Harry’s head trying to communicate to him silently, it took two tugs but Harry got the memo and with a final lick of Draco’s tip, the dark-haired man sat back, green eyes searching for Draco’s. Silver eyes, molten with desire and love watched Harry hungrily, while Draco gasped for air, wanting a few seconds to calm himself.
Congregatin’ on the fence,
James had taken advantage of Luna’s distraction to investigate the record player attached to the gramophone and he currently had both paws on the crank. He was currently keeping up with the pace, though his wide eyes hinted that this might not be the case for long. Before anyone could notice him however, Luna commented on the music.
And I’m very proud of that.
“Well…I guess they won’t need me anymore.” Harry turned to head back towards his house, walking slowly with a heavy heart in his chest.
The group waddled along in companionable silence after that, everyone lost in their own thoughts about Paris, food, and home. Harry, for one, was just glad the birds had stopped talking.  They sure liked to pick on him. He wasn’t a fan but he was intrigued to see this Uncle Hagrid character. Draco walked along happily, glad to be getting closer to Paris, and to his Madame, with every step. The kittens were all rather entranced by the geese still, and so they didn’t mind the waddling or the companionship. Albus tried to model his walk after Harry’s after a while, because he looked up to the black cat. By the time they arrived at the street the Café was on, it was dark and the sounds they heard coming from inside didn’t bode well.
Draco squished himself up against Harry hard for a minute before backing up to grab his suitcase. Harry grabbed his own and both men turned on the spot apparating with a crack to their BnB. Harry unlocked the door and held it open for Draco who thanked him and ducked inside. Draco gasped as he took in the house they were staying in. It looked like a quaint little cottage on the outside, but the inside of the house was beautiful and reminded him of a castle. Draco ran into their room to drop his suitcase before flopping onto the bed. Harry laughed and  followed suit. They lay there for a few minutes, looking around at the room and getting used to their new surroundings.
“Oh, please, I was sent here for help by a cat.” Ron explained.
“Sorry love, nature called. But good morning handsome.” Harry greeted Draco as he climbed back into bed.
“Well come along Lucius. Last one up the stairs is a blast-ended skrewt!” Luna practically cackled as she started to run up the mountain of marble in front of her.
Draco stopped struggling with the guard at the sound of Harry’s voice and looked up at his husband, silver eyes alight with love, lust and passion. Harry’s emerald eyes locked on his, and he smiled while shaking his head. Draco had always been persistent, so it didn’t really surprise Harry that his husband had decided to show up at the Ministry when Harry had not texted him back. But he had been hopeful that Draco could wait for him at home.  He was clearly wrong. Rutherford nodded at Harry and stepped back to clear the way for the Auror to pass. Harry nodded appreciatively at the guard and waved bye to everyone still in the office, his face only slightly flushed.
“His name is…what?” Ron asked, confused.
Sirius turned to look at his friend for a minute before turning back to watch where he was driving. All of a sudden, his eyes got big as he realized they were headed straight for a tree! The tree broke the sidecar clean off the motorbike with a metallic clang, as there had been no time to change course. Remus broke off to the left, alone in his unattached sidecar, and forcibly turned it to head back to where the intruder and his partner were. Lucius’s luck ran out with his umbrella and it shot straight up in the air, breaking and sending the man crashing onto the back of his motorcycle. The same motorcycle that Sirius was still riding. Reflexively, Lucius wrapped his arm around the thin dog, not wanting to fall off, and not caring about being attacked at that moment.
With my toe beans curled,”
“Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.” Ron said, pushing up on the cat’s claws until he could stand again, not enjoying the feeling of being trapped. Especially not trapped inside a sharp cage, Ron stuttered as he continued speaking. “Don’t rush me. His name is Evans.”
“Keep practicing.” George told Harry when they got him to a shallow area so that he could stand.
Draco chuckled at this show of alley cat toughness, before changing the subject. “Now that will do. It’s time we concerned ourselves with self-improvement. You want to grow up to be lovely, charming gentlemen. Now Albus, you go and start on your painting.”
“That’s right. It was my favorite role. Narcissa answered, booping Draco’s head lovingly as the cat purred loudly in her ear.
“Well he started it.” James replied grumpily.
“Ow! That’s me!” Sirius complained.
Draco and his kittens are dropped off at home but Lucius finds them before Narcissa can hear them. He tries to send them to Timbuktu but Ron & Hermione aren't having it! They get Harry and Pansy Cat and her gang to help them fight off Lucius. A welcome home party was thrown for the cats, with special jazz band Pans and the Alley Cats being the major attraction! Basically it's the last bit of the story/movie and almost everyone makes an appearance!
Harry nearly choked on his sausage at Draco’s blunt answer. He managed to recover without the use of magic or the Heimlich thankfully as Draco’s laughter filled his ears. Harry shook his head at the blond and rolled his eyes. He forgot how no-nonsense Draco got when he was comfortable and alone with Harry. If someone else had been there, Draco wouldn’t have said what he did, or at least he would have hinted at it rather than coming right out with it. Harry took a long drink of coffee and coughed a few more times before feeling up to answering.
His victory was short lived however, when Rosmerta went to look in her rear-view mirror and saw that same crazy cat that almost made her crash, and a bunch of other cats in the back of her truck! Even worse, the little cats were drinking her delivery! Rosmerta’s eyes widened in her rage, wishing she had never met this cat.
“Absolutely stunning.” Draco agreed. He waved his wand and a fancy version of Lumos erupted to light up the cavern for them. Numerous small balls of white light floated above them now, allowing them to see the sharks swimming in the clear water. Draco gulped loudly, worried about possibly being attacked.
As Lucius was ironing his work clothes, he heard Narcissa’s voice come down the pipe. A will, just what he had been afraid of! He slows his ironing, scoffing a little at her mention of their divorce, before shushing himself so that he can hear what is being said. Lucius decides to stop ironing completely and goes to sit next to the metal pipe that connects his room to hers in case she ever needs to call for him during the night. The pipe has a cover, but Lucius, being the sneaky devil that he is, has removed it in order to eavesdrop on this conversation. His future is at stake after all!
“Boy…” Harry changed the subject, struck suddenly by Draco’s eyes. “Your eyes are like diamonds. Gee. That’s pretty corny though, huh?”
“Hey, Sirius, that sounds like the end.”
“Cats?” Lucius wheezes indignantly slowly falling onto the floor in a deflated heap of a man. He had just been dancing and skipping around his room rather joyfully but this realization definitely put a damper on things.
“A one-wheel, what?” Remus asked.
Little Albus trotted over to Harry, clearly worried and wanting to help. “Can I help you, Mr. Potter, huh?”
“Oh, an Expelliarmus-y,” Harry added dramatically.
“I know I am running late, but I can’t just ditch work to come home and pleasure you, my love.”
“Yeah, that’s ‘cause I practice all the time,” Albus bragged.
“Don’t come in!” He yelled as he tried to run out the cat door. Since it was locked, he merely smacked into it much like the kittens had done. Unphased, Ron picked himself up and ran to a window. “Go away! He shouted down at the kittens, terrified for their safety. “Away!”
“Forward march.” Fred called looking behind him with a smile. Everyone started walking at the command.
A rooster crowed not far from where Draco and his kittens had been abandoned. The morning proved to be a sunny one. At some point, the rain had stopped and Draco had left the basket to give his kittens more room and to stand guard as best he could. He wasn’t sure who had done this to them or what kind of wild animals they might find this far out. Birds were chirping and the frogs had started to croak once more, yet over the sounds of wildlife a male voice was carried by the breeze.
“For your eyes only… I will wear this. And you have to wear the matching one at all times,” Harry said, green eyes serious but still full of love and laughter.
Shout out to J_Amethyst for betaing! Thank you!
Inside the trunk, Draco and the kittens had worked their way free of the sack, but were still trapped within a locked trunk. Harry had realized that the window to the stable had a hole in it, so he snuck inside, jumping up to the loft above, wanting to remain unseen.
Draco smiled down at Harry as he stripped down to his speedo and shook his head at his lover. Harry had always been adventurous and sometimes brave to the point of stupidity, so Harry diving down the slide first didn’t surprise him. However, Draco’s poor heart needed a minute to calm itself after watching Harry do crazy stunts. Draco steadied his breathing while gingerly sitting at the top of the slide, taking a deep breath, Draco pushed off and flew down the water slide, laughter escaping him as he went. Draco managed to stop laughing long enough to land in the water without swallowing any and swam towards Harry, eyes sparkling silver in their delight. Harry’s emerald eyes shone back at Draco, full of love and joy. Draco swam over to Harry and they cuddled together on the edge of the pool, taking time to relax in each other’s arms before going back up to the top and sliding down a few more times, laughing the whole way down.
Scorpius’s eyes got wide at Harry’s words and he sat up at the end of the bed, trying to hear more as the adults moved out of the window, still talking.
“It isn’t Beethoven, Papa, but it sure bounces,” James said from the piano, where he started to bounce along to the beat.
“How about you and me, Draco?” Harry asked his handsome new friend as he grooved over to him.
As Remus started to bark loudly, Lucius and his motorcycle came into view.
“Oh, friends of yours?” Draco asked curiously.
“Good evening Draco. Hello kittens.”
James looked up at his dad from in between Draco’s front legs as he responded. “He had a mouth like an erumpo-lotamus.”
“I’m coming, Papa,” James whimpered as he trekked through the shallow part of the river, soaking wet. “Gee, I am cold and I’m wet.”
“Hush your mouth. Now, come on,” Sirius chided the basset hound.
Draco started off sounding bitter and snarky but at the end his voice became a whimper of emotion and need. Harry’s anger and annoyance dissipated immediately when he heard Draco’s voice fill with sadness. Harry had been missing his husband as well and since Draco had become good at covering his emotions sometimes Harry forgot just how much love Draco needed. Harry pulled the blond into his arms and held him tightly, breathing in the minty scent he had come to associate with home and safety. Draco sighed and relaxed inside Harry’s arms for a minute, but soon his sigh became a low moan. Both men still had hard-ons…and the hug had pushed them up against each other. Harry felt a low moan escape him in response and his face flushed darker.
Remus tried to lift his head up, but didn’t get very far as his ear was pinned. It had apparently fallen out of the hay pile while he had been sleeping.
“What’s a little swinger like you doing on our side of town?” Pansy asked him curiously.
“Oh and Lucius. I am expecting my attorney, Luna Lovegood. You’ll remember her of course.” Narcissa added before disappearing inside her home.
The trio of kittens in the window sighed in disappointment before turning to head back to bed. “Well, we almost had another parent,” James grumbled.
The cat family was sitting on a nice, comfortable loveseat where they were supposed to be posing for pictures. James and Albus, of course, had other ideas and were currently busy chasing each other around the arms and back of the sofa. At Madame’s words though, the two little rascals settled in close to their dads and their brother Scorpius. James and Albus swatted each other playfully a few more times before sitting up straight and looking at Madame.
“Oh that phoenix cage? Hog wash!” Elevators are for old people and, well, normal people.” Luna replied looking back at the long haired man distastefully.
James and Albus were back on the piano, side stepping fancily over the keys. Crossing one paw in front of the other to take their steps, still wanting to mimic the Pans and Harry duo.
“Now, don’t move.” Narcissa called gently. “Smile,” and all of the cats posed perfectly and smiled at her, “say cheese.” Narcissa said as a final warning before taking the photo. All of the cats had their teeth showing at the word cheese which made Narcissa smile herself.
“Oh, shucks, Sirius, that ain’t nothin’ but a little old cricket bug.”
Beneath the alley’s only light…”
“Hey, cool it, you little tiger. That woman’s dynamite.” Harry warned.
The sharks looked at the men swimming with them curiously, but none of them tried to bite or attack. Draco looked at the different sharks in awe, curious as to why they were so used to humans. But since this was a B&B Draco felt like it had something to do with the regular visitors to the island. Draco slowly started to relax enough to swim with both of his arms so he let go of Harry and started to swim beside the dark-haired man. Harry twirled as he swam and he and Draco chased each other through the water and the sharks, who really didn’t seem to mind their presence at all. The lights above seemed to tap into the men’s emotions, going from purple to blue and bright yellow with their joy and love. They swam for a while, chasing each other through the sharks and under the natural tunnels of the cavern. The bubble head charm allowed them to swim for as long as they desired without needing to come up for air.
“Because Potter…I was in desperate need of you. I had a hard-on all damn day just thinking about finally having you to myself tonight. You were supposed to be home hours ago. You have worked late every damn night this week and I need you.”
“Oh ho! Splendid, splendid. Who do you want me to sue, eh?” Luna joked as she skipped over to the writing desk; laughing at her own joke as she sat down.
Draco sighed at the sadness in his son’s voice but spoke kindly to Harry regardless. “I understand perfectly, Monsieur Potter. Well, come along, darlings.”
“Ooof! I mean ooof.” Lucius yelled as he held his head. Still clutching the egg forming there, he started to pace. Thinking out loud. “Each cat will about twelve years. I can’t wait…and each cat has nine lives! That’s four times twelve…multiply by nine times… No, it’s less than that. Anyway, it’s much longer than I’d ever live. I’ll be gone! No…” Lucius said in a calmer voice as his face contorted into a mad smile. “Oh no…they’ll be gone. I’ll think of a way. Oh…there are a million reasons why I should. All of them dollars. Millions. Those cats have got to go.” Lucius said as he nodded his head, agreeing to his evil idea and forcefully stepped into his pants. Which ripped due to strain. He glared at them before putting on a different pair more calmly. He went about his daily chores, thinking of how to get rid of those dreaded cats all the while.
“Ginny, you have nothing to be sorry for. As I said, you are not the one who hurt me. I can’t forgive Ron, but I don’t hold you accountable. You are still a good friend. You are always welcome with me.”
“What classes do you have, Aries?” Draco asked.
Goodbye,
“That had better not be Albus again.”
“Alright, I didn’t expect that. It’s your turn.”
“Maybe. However , you may not like it.”
“Today we are starting with Veritaserum. I hope you trust your partner, because you will be testing them on each other.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, what is going on?” The little girl whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, ew. No I am gay as well. Just don’t tell my parents. They still hope I will marry some pureblood bimbo.”
“Wait, what?” Draco had just finished asking when Aries turned to face him, then fell backwards. Draco gasped and Snape smiled. They waited a few seconds. Draco waited for the impacting thud. Snape waited for the smart ass comment.
“Well, I will start harvesting scales, venom, teeth, and, well, everything. They are going to make very good potion ingredients. Aries, you and Draco, go see if you can find the side chamber that Tom spoke of.” Snape was immediately lost in fascination with harvesting.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “Oh, now you want to get naked, huh? I see how it is,” Harry teased with a sexy smirk.
James was on the piano bench when Scorpius arrived so he decided a little payback was in order. Scorpius pulled on James’s tail to get himself on the bench then as James fell with an “Ow!” Scorpius jumped onto the keyboard and onto the side of the piano. There he sat, primping his fur fussily, as if he was going to be photographed. James hopped back onto the bench, glared at his brother before sitting down and cracking his knuckles dramatically. Scorpius gave James a look of indignation due to the wait, but James didn’t notice.
“If you want to turn me on,
“Oh thank goodness.” Narcissa says in a tired voice. “Just in time.” Narcissa admits as she sits on her couch gracefully.
"Well then, maybe I will come sit in your lap. Or at least near you..."
The two men lost themselves in each other, the rest of the world fading away. Each thrust sent shivers of pleasure through both of their bodies, causing more moans and gasps of excitement. Harry and Draco kissed each other harder, matching the power of their thrusts as they got closer to finishing. Harry’s hands explored Draco’s deliciously muscled torso, and Draco’s hands scratched their way lovingly up and down Harry’s chest. As he got closer to finishing, Harry started to stroke Draco’s cock in time with their hips, with Harry’s extra attention on him, Draco came at the same time as his boyfriend. Harry cried out Draco’s name as he filled the blond with his seed. Draco’s cum coated Harry’s chest as he came, yelling Harry’s name as he finished. Both men collapsed into each other’s arms when they were done, spent but content and craving cuddles. Harry and Draco laid there for a while until their breathing had returned to normal then they got dressed and went back to their house.
“Yes. We’re here to help you.” George added.
Draco smiled at the words, loving the idea of Harry being his husband. Harry was currently rolling on the dirt, trying to dry off his fur. He joined the conversation without looking at the geese.
A few nights later, Narcissa was having a nice party to celebrate the return of her beloved fur babies. Luna had come over, as Narcissa wanted to make a few more changes to her will. Lucius had vanished without a trace, leaving what little possessions he had behind, and she couldn’t really be bothered to care. Her cats were back at home, and they had found a nice, wonderful second parent for the kittens in Harry. He was a handsome and sweet black cat--albeit a little rough around the ears, yet Harry was settling in well and that was all Narcissa could hope for. Luna was sitting back at the desk in Narcissa’s room while Narcissa fiddled with the camera, wanting to take a photo of her now complete cat family.
“Well, why don’t you do something about that?”
He stood and walked to the window. Upon opening the window his sitting room was a flurry of white feathers.
“Harry, are you coming?” Neville asked. Harry looked over to Draco who nodded his head.
“Alright now some hard stuff. Where did you live before coming to Sev?”
Hermione and Luna had a boy named Jacob Leo Lovegood-Granger.
“Harry please tell this ferret he will not be incharge of your baby shower. I’m the baby's aunt. I get to do it.” Hermione tattled.
“No! Absolutely not! I thought you were smarter than that Draco. You will not be doing it!” Hermione yelled.
“Hello, Potter. How is my tadpole doing?”

In the bathroom, he pulled his night clothes off and walked into the shower. After washing his hair, he grabbed a flannel and scrubbed at his body. He had never felt this dirty even after a game of quidditch. After about fifteen minutes of scrubbing, he turned off the water and got out. He wrapped a towel around his waist and realized he hadn’t grabbed clothes. Walking towards the door he caught sight of the mirror. Curious, he went to it. First thing he noticed was his hair. It went down to his shoulders.
He went to sit down when the owl went crazy again. She knocked over everything that would get his attention. After a few seconds snape snaps his book shut and stands.
“I-I do like him. I just don’t think I am good enough for him. Son of a death eater. A Malfoy. That name used to mean so much and now all I can do is hope no one associates me to them. On top of that, he just returned from months of rape and tourture. He isn’t ready to be with me. No matter how much I want him to be. He may not remember it, but I do. I can’t in good conscience be in a relationship with him until he remembers what happened. Not that I think he is broken or disgusting, just that he is a survivor. He needs to know why and how first. If he asked me, however, I don’t think I could say no.”
He got to the door and whispered, “Unicorn.” The door popped open. All the lights were out, suggesting Harry did indeed go to sleep.
Even before he was taken Harry hardly ever hugged anyone. He didn’t like being touched. That made this hug more meaningful.
.” He left the portkey pull at his navel.
“Hell no Weasley! It was your brother who-”
"No, no, it wasn't, I have, is this the first time you thought about it?" Now Ron looked slightly hurt, but was, all in all, hiding it well.
I know I'm a shitty person, I make you wait for months then put down like 100 words, I am very sorry! But everything is going to get good in the next few chapters so, stick around! I promise to update!
Be sure to look for tag changes as the book goes on because while I do have an outline, I have a bad tendency for changing things up and if you are ever uncomfortable with the way the tagging is, please, please leave a comment and I will be happy to change it for you!
Please skip this chapter if this is a trigger!
"What are you doing up so late?" Harry leaned against Draco's shoulder and closed his eyes. Draco also closed his eyes, taking a deep breath.
So there's my excuse!
"I reckon, yes." Harry was in jeans today and he wore a pair of beige, beaten up hiking boots. The tee he was wearing said something about the outdoors, and the light jacket he wore gave off the impression of not caring. Even though he felt tremendously underdressed in Draco's presence and had very carefully picked this outfit form his wardrobe this morning.
Like hearing Hermione scream and Ron scream after Bellatrix, begging her to stop and torture him, he could remember Draco bringing food to Luna in the dungeons where Harry was also put sometime later.
"Oh! You're still up." Harry said, peeling from his clothes. Draco hummed and flipped the page on his book.
Running back over to his desk he pulled a file from its depths. He needed to talk to Draco. Finding his address he quickly disapparated. Landing in Draco's front lawn he looked over the large house.
Why had he pushed Percy away?
Falling for Draco Malfoy was tough, though, defeating Voldemort was harder and he somehow managed that. He could manage this little stitch easily. Somehow he would find a way around it and move on. Somehow.
I wish I could do a recap as Netflix does of the last chapter! I'm gonna keep writing and not stop on this work tonight, I'm trying to get to meaty bits and I think we're here finally! This chapter is a little confusing, but stick with me! For the next chapters, you're gonna need some sad musical songs!
They sat in silence for a long moment.
"What do you mean?" Draco sighed and fell back into an armchair. Draco didn't talk for a long moment.
"Hello, Draco," Harry said as Draco approached him.
He picks it up carefully and hands it to Harry. It's in a frame and sorta small. Two people are dancing around in it, the wind is blowing, and they look happy. In the end, they come together in a sweet kiss.
Ron smiled down at the other man, then dipped down to kiss him on the neck as Harry's fingers dug into his back as the redhead increased his speed. Harry's breathing was erotic and his eyes rolled back in his head as Ron kept on.
"I guess because they couldn't kill you, so, they figured," He paused and gathered all his chopped veggies up, dumping them into the pot beside him, "If they couldn't kill you, they were going to take away everything you loved." Draco turned then and put the pot on the stove. Pulling the water spigot away from the wall, he began to fill the pot.
"I didn't flinch because you touched me. I finched because of the memory I got from the photo." He shouted into the house. He couldn't see Draco but knew he was somewhere. Walking down the hall, he walked into their bedroom and found Draco in their adjoining bathroom, scrubbing dirt from his hands.
"And that was?" Harry asked testily. Draco closed his eyes and sighed.
Moving around his modest home he was busy cooking diner, he had a small glass of dark whiskey sitting next to the cookbook he was using. Picking up the tumbler he brought it to his lips. Almost taking a sip. A knock at the door kept him from doing so, sighing he ran his hands over the towel that rest on his shoulder. Moving towards the door he swung it open. Draco was standing on the other side.
mean they are
Harry found the hem of Draco's jumper and pulled it up over the man's head. Once it was off though, Harry stopped. Draco's chest was covered in deep silver scars. The way the firelight caught them made them shine endlessly.
They were his adopted parents, trouble and turmoil seemed to follow the poor lad everywhere, what with his birth parents being killed by Death Eaters. Sighing he pulled his coat over his arms when a thought hit him.
Draco sighs, "You never talked about him much." Draco sounds sadder than he had all day. Harry knew why he never talked about Billion, but he wasn't about to tell his husband that.
Harry considered this for a while, he toyed with the hem of his shirt and crossed and uncrossed his legs a few times before answering. "What, given your personal opinion, would I have mixed up?"
"Why?" Harry asked, looking up from his mug of tea. Draco was standing in front of him with an apron on, cutting up vegetables. His long fingers encompassed the knife tightly, and everything he cut had the mark of a skilled chief. Draco Malfoy really was a beautiful man.
"More so than usual anyway." Harry sighed and went to scanning over Draco's bookshelf.
"Perhaps, somewhere." He sat his pen down and stood, walking over to his bookshelf he began running his fingers over the binds of the books.
"Nothings wrong. I just wanted to let you know the papers were sent off this morning." Percy smiled and nodded.
Harry stood and moved over to his husband, enveloping him in a tight hug, "I'm sorry, my love." They stood like that until the kettle screeched, then Draco pulled away and began filling the mugs with water.
"Well, maybe you know something, did any of the original 28 get the Dark Mark but were then killed by Death Eaters." He watched as Draco flinched at some of his words. He closed his eyes, seemingly thinking.
Draco was dressed up today, Harry noticed as he walked through the doors. He took his respective spot across from Draco's chair. All the pictures were standing today. Harry wondered if Draco had forgotten to put them back up.
"Did you happen to utilize our exercise?" Draco was looking back at Harry, his searching eyes looking for the slightest inconstancy. Harry shook his head. "And what about writing down your feelings? Have any more luck with that?"
Soon enough, though, he had to vanquish the idea because students began filling into his class, all screaming for him to listen to each of their stories about their recess. And Draco could no longer be sad, because who could when you have 20 young children all trying to tell you something of the utmost importance, at least to them.
Draco groans but says okay. They fall asleep in each other's arms, like they have every night for years.
“You are an arsehole.” Draco pouted.
“Ah, Mr. Snape. You are just in time, please take a seat. Lemon drop?” Dumbledore asked as Aries sat.
“We are having a little girl.” He said softly holding Harry’s hand.
“Wow. I don’t even know what to say. Except I am Aries Riddle. Harry Potter is dead.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Narcissa nodded and took Lily out of the room.
“Well he obviously isn’t here, is he? Did he finally ditch your sorry arses?”
“I-I will do my best, my Lord.”
Draco laughed then nodded. He stood, helped Harry to his feet, and motioned for Hermione to follow him. “Just be quiet when we get there. It’s almost one in the morning. He might kill us.”
Thank you so much for the Kudos! The comments really made my day!!!!
Snape never had hope his son would be alive, so he had never tried this potion before. Now he had to know.
They got ready for bed and laid down. Draco pulled Harry close and kissed his forehead.
After a few minutes Harry broke the silence. “Hermione, since apparently Ron is no longer a potential boyfriend, who do you have your eye on anyone?”
Snape grabbed everyone’s attention immediately.
Draco’s mouth was opened slightly, just enough to let air come in and out. His eyelashes were stark black and made an interesting comparison to his pale skin tone. One thing Harry never noticed was that Draco had freckles. Several light spots decorated the bridge of his nose and cheeks. He realized how beautiful Draco was.
“Oh, right. I didn’t tell you my last name did I? Aries Snape. Can’t say I am pleased to meet you. Now as I said, get lost.” Aries was cool and calm in a very scary way. He looked almost exactly like his mother then.
I finally got to go back to work, so no more a new chapter every day sadly. I will post as often as I can.
I would like everyone to know it’s probably gonna be a while until my next chapter comes out. My grandmother died yesterday and her funeral is on Wednesday. I’ll update this when I can.
The twins do not agree with the writing of this letter, but still stay away from them. You do nothing but bring pain to people. Please don’t write back. The owl will stay until you have read this and you tell him to go. He has been told not to accept any letters in return to us.
Snape raised his wand and did some intricate spell work. After about ten minutes Harry glowed bright white. It was so bright the three adults had to look away. When they looked back a completely different boy laid on the bed.
“So, how exactly did you kill Sally, Harry?” He said as smoothly as if he asked what kind of ice cream Aries liked.
She nodded. “That is all I can ask. Okay, now back to this. Flowers. Should we have-”
As it had turned out Hermione had already sent her trunk ahead to the castle. They got to the front entrance and started towards Gryffindor Tower. Snape stopped Harry and sent the other two ahead.
“Okay, Harry, I'm going to look you over is that alright?”
Aries replied, not paying enough attention. “I had the sword of Gryf-Wait, What? What did you just call me?”
“Well, I may or may not like a certain Ravenclaw.”
“Yeah, Dray. I’m awake.”
They all turned back to the sorting to see the small girl sorted into Ravenclaw.
Harry raised an eyebrow and wrote, WE?
Death eaters all around noticed their Lord was gone. They quickly got out as quick as they could.
“Of course Professor.”
“At least it is something. He could have done nothing. I don’t trust him. He is manipulative and I don’t like it.” Harry said calmly.
He flopped his head back a little too hard. The blackness pulled at his vision. The door opened and black clad feet appeared just before the darkness took over.
“Okay?”
He had just opened his book when he heard a rapid pecking on his window.
“That has never happened before though. I have been basically tortured for years and that never happened.”
"How about we don’t make that choice. You will both get out of here. We have back up coming. Right now we need to get Lily out.”
So this was the game Dumbly was playing. Aries knew some kind of conversation was in the near future and planned accordingly.
