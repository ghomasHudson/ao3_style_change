I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Kudos and comments are always welcome :)
It definitely is not an excuse, but university just got on the way of writing.
She could not believe what she was seeing. Cuts littered all of Harry’s arms and legs, as more and more blood fell onto the floor. How could this have happened? How hadn’t she realised that her brother was hurting, that he was cutting himself over and over again? She was so ashamed of herself; she should have realised; she should have been there for him. She had known that her brother was not okay, that he needed to be watched, that was one of the reasons why she had really “forced” him to go to Hogwarts with her, to keep an eye on him, and to make sure that nothing like what happened at the Astronomy Tower happened ever again; and she had failed. Here he was, covered in cuts and blood, while Hermione had been none the wiser.

“I just couldn’t stop thinking about the letter and about everything you said…”
“Yes Harry, I know. But, tell me, if everything you had been taught since you were little was that you were better than others, that muggle-borns should bow at your feet, what would you believe. There are the ideals with which you are brought up, and in which you believe without a reason behind, and then there are the ideals in which you believe when you are older because you have reasons to do so. What I’m trying to say Harry, is that he did not have these views about muggle-borns because he truly believed in them, but because they had been integrated into his being since he was a child, and therefore he stood by them. The word mudblood is not something you are born knowing, it is something you are taught about, just like everything else. I am not trying to excuse his behaviour either, but if he, like the Weasleys, had been taught that no one was superior to anyone, he wouldn’t’ve had that shitty behaviour. He knows better now, and that is the important thing.”
Furthermore, I just started back with Uni so it's once again hard to find the proper time to sit and write.
“Oh, I thought that I had only been asleep for a day… Can you tell them to come in, please?”
Suddenly being in the Astronomy Tower did not seem such a hardship, he saw it as his way out. A way of being with his family once and for all. He had tasted a bit of happiness back in the forest, when he had seen his parents, Sirius and Remus, all so welcoming, so happy to see him and to have him with them. Now that Voldemort was gone, he could take the train and keep going on. There were no more reasons to stay back. He had been so tempted to go with Dumbledore when he had seen him at King’s Cross Station, but he had had to come back, he had to kill Voldemort. But that was done, so there were no more reasons to be here. He could just be another name in the long list of deaths, no one would pay hiss passing much mind. No one would miss him. Everyone had lost too much to miss him. With his mind set, he walked towards the edge of the tower.
Deep down Harry knew that what Hermione was saying was true. After all, the same had happened with Dudley. He had always treated him badly because it was how his parents treated Harry. If his parents could treat Harry badly, then so could he. However, in the end, he had seen that all his life he had treated Harry with no respect, without any reason, and he had tried to mend his errors.
“Well, what are we waiting for, why aren’t you opening the door, Hermione?” – said Neville, after Hermione and Harry had been staring at the door for two minutes straight. This seemed to pull them out of their stupor, and slowly they turned around to look at their classmates who were looking at them expectantly. – “Sorry, bad memories. Could anyone else open the door, I don’t think I will be able to do it…”
If you see any mistakes please tell me. Know that comments and kudos are always welcome.
Thank you so much for reading this chapter. I hope I can post soon.
“Hey, I’m a Slytherin not stupid! Besides, it was not the first panic attack that I have seen… after all, I was here last year, and it wasn’t an easy one”
I won't lie and say that I'll try to have the next chapter for next week, because knowing myself it won't be done. However I will promise to have the next one as soon as I can, and I will try for it to not be another half a year. The possitive part is that in two months I will be done with Uni, so if I haven't been able to post a chapter before that, I'll absolutely will as soon as Uni is done, so I suppose that you'll only have to wait two months tops.
“Oh, Merlin! Why hadn’t I thought about that before! I’m so stupid, it’s the first thing I should’ve done, I can’t believe I forgot about it”. – she stood while she kept on rambling, and headed straight into their dorm room, Blaise following hot on her heels, not understanding why she was going towards her dorm room.
"E-everyone? W-w-what do you mean e-everyone?"- He managed to choke out through all the pain he felt.
The trial is here!!
had been. She was so scared, scared for her brother, scared of losing him. As she kept running, she was going through different scenarios as to why Harry would be up there, each one being worse than the last. She could not get out of her mind the fact that the last time that Harry had been there, she had almost lost him. She kept running faster and faster, taking every shortcut she could think about, trying to get to the Astronomy Tower as fast as possible, because she could not take the loss of another person, and much less the loss of her brother. She could only think about the fact that Harry was alone up there, while the image of him in the Infirmary Wing, as well that morning with all the blood pooling at his feet kept repeating, not having realised that there was another name up there, a name that could be either a blessing or a curse. The name of Harry's "ex"-nemesis.
He tried to nod his head to Madam Pomfrey, Hogwarts Matron, but he found that the movement was to much a struggle, so he decided to just stay put. Even though he tried, his head could not stop wondering about who could have saved him and, most importantly, why. Why, when all he wanted in the whole world was to die, had someone decided to stop him, why had someone decided to save someone so unworthy, someone who had brought nothing but pain to everyone. He could not get his head around the reason why anyone would want him alive. Suddenly, all became clear as he heard the shriek of his sister, in all but blood, the one who had been with him every step of the way.
Sincerely,
Once those words left her lips, and uproar could be heard throughout the whole chamber. – “Please, lower your volume or I may ask you to leave this courtroom” – said Minister Shacklebolt with a solemn voice. While he was waiting or the crowd to stop screaming, Harry saw the shocked face of Malfoy at Hermione’s statement, as well as, an expression of gratitude as well as shock in Mrs Malfoy; clearly, she had not expected them to help her son, and even less her.
With that last word, he turned around and storm out of their dorm, not once caring that he was only wearing his pyjamas and had blood all over his arm. Hermione was left stunned and heartbroken. She knew that she was not his mum, nor did she intend to be, however, she did consider him family, and even though she knew that he had said those hurtful words as a defence mechanism, that did not mean that they hurt any less.
The Aurors took Malfoy and his parent to a seat located in the centre of the room, and once they were seated, chain sprung out from them and bound them to the chair. Once they were bound, Minister Shacklebolt started to state the crimes for which they were being judged for.
The school had been going for the last month, and Hermione had never been more concentrated on her workload. True, she had always been a top student, but she had always had a little bit of time for her friends and their “adventures”. Now however, she could not afford the spare time. If she even stopped for a minute, memories started assaulting her, and not of the pleasant type; bodies scattered on the floor, spells ricocheting around her, the last breath of her friends and family, the last laugh of a person, the last scream of terror, memories of battles and loses. When she came here for the begining of the term, she had believed that she would be able to do it, separate Hogwarts from the battlefield that it had been, but it was all too recent, the wounds were still fresh, and even with all the restorations, she could still see all around her the damage done to her beloved school.
“Well, here we are. Now if you could all place your hands in the door.” – said Hermione.
“I don’t care whether they are a Slytherin, a Gryffindor, a Ravenclaw or a Hufflepuff. They are Hogwarts students and they should be welcome to our school as so. We should welcome them to their new home, not just to their new house. It is a place unknown to all of them, they have just arrived here. They barely know anyone, and the first thing we do when they arrive here is distributed them in different houses, and instead of being extra support, we turn it into the only support they have. We discriminate anyone who is not in our house, and for those who their only friend goes to another house, they are left with no one once again. We should be a school, not four houses. We should unite not divide. Everyone has been able to see what happens when we divide, and we cannot let that happen again. Let the past be a lesson to everyone toward a better future. So yes, I am applauding to a young boy who has been sorted into Slytherin, because no matter the house he is in, he is also a new student to our school, and we should welcome them all to it.”

Thank you so much for all your love!

of September, their routine was about to change drastically. Here they were again, about to board the Hogwarts Express for their last time to go back to the place where it all had happened. The place where they had all met, where they grew up and have the time of their lives, but also the place where they fought for their lives and where many had been lost.
So... It's been like maybe half a year without me posting anyhting, and I'm so sorry for it, but honestly I cannot manage everything, and I am overcome with Uni work, and therefore unable to do anything more.
Did you like the nightmare? I didn't know who to write it and I wasn't a 100% convinced about it, but I wanted this chapter to have a nightmare, and I really couldn't do better than that. So, how did you like it?
“Hermione, we need to talk.”
He looked at the time and saw that it was almost Breakfast time. Knowing that Hermione normally was already out of the room at this hour of the day, he opened the curtains of his four-poster bed with caution and looked towards Hermione’s bed. He saw it empty, so he decided to go to the bathroom to shower and wash away all the blood. However, when he entered the bathroom, he stopped dead on his feet. He saw Hermione, freshly showered, with only a bra on. But that was not the problem, oh, no; the problem was that he would see every single bone of her body. He had never seen her so thin, and he had been living with her while on the run and with little to no food, so that was saying something.
(See the end of the chapter for
At hearing those words, Harry could not believe that so many people, and even Madam Pomfrey, had worried about him. As he was thinking about what he percieved as unbelievable, he started to feel more and more tired, and he went back to the realm of sleep with just one thought in his mind: "Maybe I should try, try to live for all of them and in the end, I may be able to live for me."
"Miss Granger! I won't have you causing pain to my patient by making him speak, whatever your intentions are. So if you cannot behave I will have to ask you to leave his side."
As she was leaving the Eighth Year Dorms, she bumped into someone, who was entering, and her first thought was “
With so much love,
Harry was left breathless when he saw Draco Malfoy entering into the courtroom. That young man was not his school nemesis, he was just a person who had suffered too much without reason. No one should have been through the horrors you could see in his eyes. He looked like he had not been eating since the battle of Hogwarts; his clothes were torn, and his face looked sullen with bags under his eyes. He Malfoy Mask had fallen, and you could see every emotion written in his face, but how couldn’t it, when he had been three months imprisoned in Azkaban with the Dementors.
With lots of love,
A few minutes had passed when he, once again, heard the sound of the door opening. He looked up and saw not only Hermione, but also the entirety of the Weasley Family. He was surprised to see so many people who cared for him, but once again, Hermione had already told him so, so why was it so hard to believe that he was cared for?
Every comment is welcome, even if it is to tell me you enjoyed this chapter, which I hope, or to give me some recommendations.
I hope to see you soon,
Thank you so much for reading!
“Neville, why is this table in here and why aren’t we seating in the Gryffindor table?”
“Thank you, Minister” – he said – “I too, would like to start taking on behalf of Mrs Malfoy. I would like to make emphasis on Hermione’s statement about Mrs Malfoy acting on behalf of her family, only to protect her. Just like Hermione, I know what it's like to act out of love and for the protection of our loved ones. We all know that we would do anything to save those that we love, nothing is too much and safe is never safe enough. However, I believe that Hermione has explained it all perfectly, so I won’t delve in that. Nevertheless, I would like to make a statement regarding Mrs Malfoy, that not many know of. Mrs Malfoy saved my life, and I do not say that lightly. She might have done it for her son but, nonetheless, she saved my life. As those who were in the battle of Hogwarts, and many more may know, while Voldemort gave us time to gather our dead ones and our injured, I went into the Forbidden Forest to meet with him. When Severus Snape died, he gave me his last memories for me to view. In them I saw Albus Dumbledore telling Severus Snape that, for reasons which I cannot say due to confidentiality, I had to die before Voldemort did, or else he could not be killed and all that time while in the run completing Dumbledore’s mission would have been for nothing. Therefore, I went into the forest. Not to negotiate a truce with Voldemort, but to die. Once I arrived where He was located, He did not wait a moment before he had cast the Killing Curse to me. For unknown reasons, though, I survived once again. I was lying still hoping that they thought me dead when I heard Voldemort telling someone to check if I was dead, he did not want to commit his mistake once again, after all. Obviously, I thought that it was my end, whoever it was would tell Voldemort that I was alive, and He would kill me with some other curse making sure that I didn’t survive this time. However, it was Mrs Malfoy who approached me, she saw that I was alive, and instead of telling so to Voldemort, she asked me whether Draco was alive or not. At that point I had two options, I could either ignore her because maybe it was just a trick to see if I truly was alive, or answer her. I chose the second one, and in a murmur, I told her that his son was alive and in the castle. Then, the impossible happened, Mrs Malfoy stood up and told Voldemort that I was dead. No one else came to verify, no one doubted her word. The reason why I had gone to the forest was fulfilled, and therefore I could finally kill Voldemort. Mrs Malfoy saved my life, and assuredly the life of many others, and for that reason, I ask for you to spare her, if not a full pardon, at least house arrest, but she does not deserve Azkaban, not after saving all of us in an act of love. Continuing onto Draco Malfoy, once more Hermione has explained how he saved our lives back in Malfoy Manor, I will not delve onto that, as all that was said before is true. However, I would like to talk about our sixth year. His father had just been imprisoned in Azkaban due to the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Voldemort decided as punishment for his father’s failures to make him, a sixteen-year-old boy and therefore a minor, a Death Eater. He gave him am impossible mission. A mission that not even Voldemort dared to do and threatened to kill her mother and him if he failed. As you now that mission was no other than to kill the great Albus Dumbledore. Voldemort’s hopes were that Draco would fail his mission and that he would be able to punish further the Malfoy Family. Yes, it is true, Draco almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley, but it was just in an attempt to safe his family. I saw the misery he lived in through all our sixth year, I would not wish it to anyone. Furthermore, even though it may surprise you, Dumbledore knew of Draco’s plans, he knew all along. Before starting the school year, while in a mission Dumbledore run into a curse by Lord Voldemort, he ended with a blackened hand, which was slowly killing him. He did not die instantly because Severus Snape managed to slow the spreading, giving him a few more months of life. Mrs Malfoy asked Severus Snape, a long-time family friend, to help his son in his mission to end Dumbledore’s life and made him take an unbreakable vow to do anything in his power to assure Draco’s success, after all, Mrs Malfoy did not want to lose his son. Severus Snape gave all this information to his mentor, one Albus Dumbledore, who told him to help Draco and to, in the final moments of his life, to kill him himself; as we all know, Severus did. The day Dumbledore died, we had just returned from a mission who left him very weak, barely alive. When we arrived at the Astronomy Tower Dumbledore told me to go fetch Severus Snape, but while I was leaving, Draco arrived, and Dumbledore froze me under my father’s invisibility cloak unable to move. I saw everything that happened that night up in the tower. Draco disarmed Dumbledore but was not able to do anything more.  He was trembling out of fear, and he told Dumbledore that he had to kill him, or Voldemort would kill his family. But he was not able to. Dumbledore offered him a way out, a way to save himself and his family, and Draco was about to accept when the Death Eaters burst in. We all know what happened next, Dumbledore died at the hands of Severus Snape. What I’m trying to say with this though, is that Draco Malfoy is not a criminal, he did not want to commit any of the crimes you accused him fore, he was just trying to fulfil the role given to him, just like I did. We were just children, children forced to take part in an adult war, we are not at fault about what we did, none of us are. No sixteen-year-old should be forced to do what we have been through. No sixteen-year-old should be forced to make the decision to kill or be killed. Thank you very much for your attention esteemed Members of the Wizengamot, I hope my statement helps you make a fair decision for everyone.”
Before anyone could realise it, Headmistress McGonagall had left from the Great Hall, laughing quietly to herself.
“I’m good Madam Pomfrey. I don’t hurt as much as before.”
He saw that his speech had, at least, served for something, because for the rest of the sorting he saw that every student of every house applauded the new student into Hogwarts, not just into his new house.
I hope to have the next chapter soon
Harry saw in the faces of his schoolmates, that even though they did not know what they were talking about, that it was a sore topic for them, so they did not pry on. After all, they all had their secrets and their past traumas. Seamus was the one to open the door, and what they saw inside was not what any of them expected. – “Wow, just wow, I was certainly not expecting that” – a girl, Lisa Turpin, or something like that Harry thought, said. It was indeed a magnificent room.
“Well, if you need help looking for him, I can help you look”
“I plead myself guilty, your Honour”
At the beginning of the school term, Harry and Hermione had gone every Sunday to lunch with the family in the Burrow, but now, even Sunday lunch was missed by Hermione. She said that she lost too many hours of study if she went to the Burrow, because they spend there the whole afternoon, when in reality, even though she would not admit it, not even to herself, the thought of so many food was starting to make her sick, she could not stomach that much food, and after so many days of barely eating, the thought of Molly’s food made her stomach grumble in distaste. While in the run she had grown accustomed to eating scraps of food, and since the end of the war she had barely managed to stomach great quantities of food, and every time, she ate less and less.
“Right, yes, I can imagine that it had to be tough being here with the Carrow’s… Anyways, I should keep looking for Harry… Maybe we won’t be a total slack and will go to class, or so I hope…”

I hope that I can soon post the next chapter, hopefully it will be this weekend, but if it is not then, it'll be along next week.

“Goodnight ‘Mione.”
“Hey Hermione, breath with me, okay? That’s it… in and out, in and out. That’s it keep going.” – Blaise started helping her as she recognised the beginning of a panic attack and coached her out of it – “Okay, now, can you tell me three blue things that you see around you, Hermione?”
“Why would Mrs Malfoy be writing to us, Hermione?”
“The accused have pleaded themselves guilty of their charges. Now, as is normal procedure in wizarding trials, before the Wizengamot leaves to make a resolution, witnesses may take the stand in order to attest to their crime or to defend the accused. Those who wish to act as witnesses please stand.”
- Pansy Parkinson/Theodore Nott
I'm so, so sorry for leaving you again with a cliff hanger, but it had to be done.
“Huh… yes sure I’ll help you look…” – replied Blaise, still in astonishment about what had happened in the last ten minutes, and that such a thing as that map existed.
With lots of love,
Hesitantly, and with not many belief, everyone started putting their hands at the door. When all sixteen of them had put their hand on it, a blinding light was emitted, and when it dulled, in place of the old door you could now see a beautiful oak door with Hogwarts symbol embedded in it.
“Three b-b-blue th-things? Umm, the cu-curtains, a ch-chair a-and the mo-moulding o-of the li-library…”
“Not at all, dear. I hope to see you on Sunday for dinner if you don't come back before, dears.”
“Yes, and she is also the woman who saved your life, Harry! Besides, if this letter is for what I believe, it being cursed would not be beneficial for her purpose.”
By the end of September, Hermione was thinner than she had ever been. You could see every single bone protruding from her body. Therefore, to avoid more pestering from her friend she had started applying a Glamour to herself. She woke early in the morning before even Harry started stirring, and the first thing she did was go to the bathroom to shower and to apply her Glamour so that no one could see her deteriorating body. So far, she had managed to do this undetected, but “luck” doesn’t last forever, and even less when you have Mr Lucky sharing a room with you. When Hermione turned around to exit the bathroom and to go to the library once she had picked her books, she found herself in front of Harry, who had a look of hurt, as if being struck, in his face. She hoped that he had not seen her without the Glamour, but judging by his face, today was not her lucky day. His last words, though not very specific, confirmed her suspicions.
"As we all were, Miss Granger, as we all were..."
“I know Hermione, don’t remind me about it. It will be an entertaining birthday.”
“Hermione, we need to talk.”
Hermione, as always, was the first one to ask a question. – “Headmistress McGonagall, if we are not leaving with our houses, are we still considered from that house, and are we still allowed into our house common room or not?”
I really hope that you enjoy it! As you'll see it is a little longer than the previous two, however it is not as long as the first chapters, but I do what I can, and what my muse allows me to so here it is!
When they left, Ron was still huffing, but at least he said no more about the trials. They arrived at Grimmauld Place in a solemn mood and headed directly to bed. It was late, and the following day would be a long one indeed.
"-. He recognized the spell. He recognized the feeling of falling slower, and he prayed with all his will that it was too late, that they could not help him, that he would die.

“And for who are you testifying, Miss. Granger?”
“There, there, darling. Let it all out, everything will be alright. Now come on go and say hi, dinner will be ready in five minutes.”
I hope you enjoyed this short Prologue.
When they arrived back home, exhausted and ready to go to bed, they saw the last thing they expected. There were two letters waiting for them in the kitchen table with an unmistakable crest at the front.
“Ok Hermione, I’ll try it. We’ll go to dinner this Sunday, but I don’t think that I’m up to any kind of celebration, not yet”
They quietly prepared themselves for bed, and after talking a little bit about their aspirations for the coming year, they went to sleep. After all, tomorrow school started anew, and they could not afford to be asleep.
“Family… It’s been so long since I’ve truly felt part of a family… Remus was, of course, but I was never truly able to be with him, just like Sirius. Of course, I have you, you are my sister, you know it, but it’s just so hard to believe.”
“What?! I thought that you would be living with the Weasleys now that you finally are with Ron… Is Ron coming too, then?”
“Okay, Hermione, okay! You know what, you want to know it?! I cannot bear to see them because I cannot imagine a Burrow without Fred. I don’t think I could cope seeing George again, so devastated and so destroyed, without his other half. I have been through too much heartbreak throughout my life, I cannot bear to see another family broken. No matter if that family is mine, they will be better without me, I just know it. No matter how destroyed I might be if I never see them again, if I give them an opportunity in happiness I will stay apart.”
I believe that everyone was expecting a continuation of the last chapter, but I NEEDED to do this.
spell onto his arm. Oh… the relief! The serenity of feeling the blood trickling down his arm, and the feeling of pain in it took away the nagging pain that he felt all day long in his body, in his heart. It was pure and utter relief, it brought him tranquillity and a peace of mind that he had never felt before, only when cutting. However, the feeling of relief ceased soon, so he kept casting more
Hermione didn’t respond, there was no need to. They both knew that they had gone through while in the run had changed them too much. He still felt as though he should have done more, but he could not denay that those months had marred him forever. Living in cramed places had never been unknown to him, but at least while with the Dursleys he could know when the next meal would be; however, while in the run, they never knew if they would be able to eat that day, they didn’t know where they would be the next, or if they could ever stop running. Every day was full of uncertainties, and they never knew if there would be a next one or if it would be the last.
While he was retaking his seat, Andromeda went to the stand, took the oath and started to make her statement. She was defending her sister, and she explained the Wizengamot what it was like to be born into the Black family; after all, she had had the same upbringing. She explained to them about the Cruciatus they had been submitted since she had been three, about how their parents had been as crazy as Bellatrix and had forced them to always do their bidding. She said that she had been lucky, she had been able to escape, and fortunately, her only punishment had been disinherited, though fore a pureblood, that can be worse than death. Mrs Malfoy, however, had not had much luck, and couldn’t escape their parents' grip, therefore being forced to marry Lucius Malfoy. Even though the marriage may had been planned, it was still her family, and Black’s protected her family fiercely, and for that reason, Mrs Malfoy had stood by his husband through the war and had helped her son in everything she could. Finally, Andromeda stated that had she been in her sister’s place, she would have done the same, after all, she had also done everything she could in order to protect her husband and daughter.
He spent a whole hour talking to the Weasley Family. They berated him for doing what he did, although they said that they understood and, strangely, Harry believed them. These were hard times for everyone and grieve was no stranger to anyone. Throughout the talk Harry started to remember what it was like to have a family; after all, the Weasley’s were the first family that had accepted him. He also started to remember what it was like to be cared for. But it was still hard to see a future for himself, he did not fit. Even though the Weasleys were there for him, he still could not feel that he truly belonged, they were not his true family, he felt like he was just a stray they had picked. When they finally left, he was left alone with Hermione. She was the only person who could see as his true family, his sister, a person who he could trust with his whole heart and without any doubt. He loved her, and she was a little bright spark in his dark existence, the only important reason to keep going and to keep trying. After a few minutes of comfortable silence, Hermione suddenly broke it and said something which Harry did most certainly not expect.
There stood Andromeda with little Teddy in her arms. How could he have forgotten of his Godson? He had not for one moment wondered how he was, and though he knew that he was living with Andromeda, he had not once made a move to see how he was, as well as Andromeda, who had not only lost her husband in this war but also her daughter and son-in-law. He once again started sobbing in despair and felt his legs go weak. Just as he was about to fall to the ground, he felt someone’s arms embracing him and supporting him, and he immediately knew that it was Hermione. He leaned against her and started sobbing in earnest on her shoulder. She did not speak, there was no need to, she just kept rubbing his back until he was able to calm himself. Everyone knew why he had broken down, so they kept quiet, waiting for the right moment to speak. Obviously, the first one who did so was Andromeda, who said something which Harry did not anticipate.
Love,
Once they had boarded, they cancelled the Charms and found an empty compartment alongside Ginny, Luna and Neville, who had also returned for his eighth year. Firstly, they just talked a little bit about their summer a how everything was back at home, but it was a too much uncomfortable conversation, due to all the loss they had been subjected to those lasts months, which made them lapse into a sort of uncomfortable silence until the Trolley Witch arrived. That seemed to break the ice for them, and they started talking about anything and everything like the old times. It seemed as if seeing the Trolley Witch made them realise that even though they had lost people, live went on, and therefore, they could not let the loss of their love once reign their future, live continued, and being there was just like the past years. Yes, they were all different, but at least for Harry, they were still the same.
He was still praying when, suddenly, all went black.
I'll try to have the next chapter soon to compensate for it, but for now, I hope you like this one.
It had been a month since the trials, and during this month nothing much in their routines had changed. They had kept on going to the Weasley’s every Sunday for dinner, and even though Ron was still mad at them for testifying for the Malfoy family, he had mellowed a little. Harry had also gone a few times to Andromeda’s house to spend time getting to know his godson, and he couldn’t be prouder of the little man he was growing to be. During this month they had received their Hogwarts letter for their eighth year, and as much as Harry had wanted to refuse at first, Hermione had insisted in the fact that they needed their education, and therefore they had to attend for their final year and take their NEWTs. However, they had not managed to convince Ron, as he had decided that he would help George in managing Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. They had also received a very heartfelt letter from Mrs Malfoy thanking them for their help during the trials and for saving his son from a life in prison. During their last week of summer, they had gone to Diagon Alley to get their supplies for the year, and it had been as chaotic as it could get; once they had arrived at the Alley people had started bothering them and thanking them for defeating the Dark Lord, and it had only gotten worse once the reporters had arrived. Finally, they had opted to change their appearance with some charms, and they had managed to do their shopping with tranquillity.
“Hermione Jean Granger, your Honour.” – replied Hermione.
“Thank you, Mr Potter, for your statement. You may leave the stand and retake your seat. Mrs Tonks if you could come forward, and take the stand, please.” – said Minister Shacklebolt once he had finished with his statement.
“Harry, come on! Hurry up or we’ll be late!” – He heard Hermione yelling downstairs. He had been ready for more than an hour, but he was not mentally prepared. However, he did not want to face an angry Hermione again, so he adjusted his dress shirt once again, got out of their room and started descending the stairs.
“Please Stand”
I'm so sorry for taking so long to post this chapter, I had hoped to do it sooner, but at the beginning, I was swamped with uni exams, and then when they where done, due to everything happening I never got the chance to keep writing.
"Shush now Harry, do not force your voice and do not make me induce you with a Sleeping-Draught, please just be quiet for now."
He was left speechless with what he had heard. How could have Andromeda known everything he had been thinking? And what impressed him the most was that she was not blaming him, quite the contrary, she was giving him a second chance to be a part of Teddy’s life, and he would do nothing less but cherish it with all of his heart. Without any words to say, he decided to do the next best thing, he disentangled himself from Hermione, and went towards Andromeda to hug her, and express all his feelings of gratitude thought the hug.
“Harry, you know that we have to go to dinner, you make not like the idea, believe me, Molly’s food is not my ideal idea either, but you know that we have to go. We cannot avoid them anymore. Like it or not, they are our family, and they will always be by our side, no matter how far away we are, or how long we go without speaking, they will always be our family. They are the only family we have left, we cannot abandon them. Family is something we must cherish.”
- Harry Potter/Hermione Granger
"HARRY!! Oh, Harry, you are finally awake, I was so worried! Don't you ever try to do something like that again. You cannot imagine the heart attack that you gave me and Ron when we saw you falling off the Astronomy Tower. I don't know how we managed to stop you, but thankfully we did. Harry, don't you pull a stunt like that ever again! Everyone has been so worried!"
“It has to be in here somewhere, it has to…” – she kept murmuring on and on – “Found it! I knew it had to be here.”
They spent a few hours more together, just in the company of one another. There was no need for words, not anymore. It was another perk of having lived together for so long. You just knew when the other just needed the company, without anything to be said.
“Right Hermione, very right. As always” – he said between laughs. This was the breaking point for Hermione, and she started laughing too.
"But w-why would t-t-they worry? Why would a-a-anyone worry? No one c-c-cares about m-me, I've b-brought nothing but p-pain."
“You’ve been sleeping for five days. That’s why we were so worried, but I suppose that it was your body’s way of healing.”
So... I'm Back!!
“Well, I cannot say that I was not expecting that.” – said Hermione after a brave pause.
When the sorting started, Headmistress McGonagall raised from her seat and went into the stand to give her welcoming speech before the Feast started.
“Really? I must say that it was truly unexpected to me… I did not expect them to want to invite us to dinner and even less want to celebrate my birthday. Merlin knows I, at least, do not want to…”
“I don’t know Hermione…”
“I don’t really know, Headmistress McGonagall only told us that all the eighth years’ returning had to seat here and that we had to stay after the feast because she wanted to talk to us. I suppose that she will explain it all then. Now seat, the sorting is about to start, you arrived right on time.”
kidding me because as far as I can see, I’m am not the only one fucked up in here, and not the only one who has been hiding this from the other one. So don’t start mothering me Hermione because you are not my mum!”.
Apart from this slight misstep, the rest of the dinner went smoothly without any other incident. It was true, there were people missing, but what a better way of honouring them than living? So that was what they would do. After dinner, they went into the living room for a little bit more of light talking, and after a long time, they decided that it was time to go back home, but not before promising to come back the day of Harry’s birthday, which was in two days’ time, in which Molly intended to at least give Harry his presents even if he did not feel up to a full celebration, which he did not. Harry and Hermione walked those hundred meters towards the apparition point in silence, but both feeling lighter than they had felt when they had arrived at the Burrow mere hours before.
Finally, everyone had given their statement, therefore the Wizengamot left the courtroom in order to make a decision. Due to an intricate spell which manipulated time, the Wizengamot Members were able to take all the time they needed in order to make a decision, while for the people in the courtroom it seemed just like mere moments. Consequently, in just mere seconds the Members of the Wizengamot were back with their verdict and retook their places in the stands. They all looked tired, and with bags under their eyes, which could only mean that they had taken a lot of time to reach a decision, hence anything could happen. When they were all seated, Minister Shacklebolt spoke again.
“Welcome back, esteemed Members of the Wizengamot. Chief Warlock, if you could come forward and give your verdict please?”
Bright light filled his vision. Light as bright as when he had been with Dumbledore in King's Cross. Had he made it? Had he managed to die? Could it be possible that he was finally free? He heard a feminine voice around him and, with a choked voice, he managed to say a strangled -"Mum?"-. Something was not right. His voice had barely come out, and it had hurt so much to say it. Being dead was not supposed to hurt and he realized that everything about him hurt. Did that mean that he was still alive? Could it be that his torture continued?
“Thank you, Miss. Granger, for your testimony. You may leave the stand and retake your seat. Mr Potter if you may come to the stand now, please – Minister Shacklebolt said. Once he had taken his place in the stand and taken his oath, the Minister spoke again. – “Please state your full name to the Wizengamot.”
Once they were out the front door, Hermione side-apparated them. With the war and everything, Harry still had to learn how to apparate, though he was in no hurry, as he had never liked the feeling of being squeezed through space. Once they had apparated, he felt sick once again, though this time he did not know if it was due to the apparition or the sight of the Burrow a hundred meters away from him; probably it was a combination of both.
“Ronald Weasley you take that back right this moment! – said suddenly Molly Weasley, who up until that moment had been quiet and looking thoughtful – I cannot believe that I raised a young man with so much prejudices! Ginny’s mishap was due to Lucius Malfoy, not his son. Lucius Malfoy is at fault, no one is denying that, however, his son and wife have not done any real damage in this war, they were just trying to survive. For what you have told us, had it not been for them both none of us would be here, and for that alone, in my opinion, they do not deserve to be in Azkaban at all. Hermione, Harry, know that we support you both in your decision, and I couldn’t be prouder. If you want us to accompany you at the trial you just have to say it.”
I am so, so, so sorry. OMG, it has almost been a month since I last posted, and I promised to post within a week...
“Thank you, Minister Shacklebolt. First of all, I would like to start with Lucius Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy, you have been found guilty of all your crimes and therefore are sentenced to Twenty-Five years in Azkaban, with a possibility of parole after twenty years. Narcissa Malfoy, you have been found guilty of all your crimes, however, due to the testimonies given during this trial, the Wizengamot has decided to sentence you to five years of house arrest with a controlled used of your magic; if any dark spell was to be used you would be sent directly to Azkaban to serve for the rest of your sentence. And to finish with our verdicts, Draco Malfoy, you have been found guilty of all your crimes, but, ought to the testimonies and the proposition of Minerva McGonagall, we sentence you to a year of controlled use of magic, in which you will have to go to Hogwarts under de vigilance of Headmistress McGonagall. If at any point you used any Dark Spell, or cause harm to your classmates, you would be sent directly to Azkaban for the remaining of the year.  After the school year and depending on your behaviour it will be determined whether you will be given further years of house arrest or not. Any behaviour like the ones you have had in your past years will not be permitted. We have been lenient because you were just a child, but we will not give you another chance.”
~*~*~
By the time he finished responding to Neville, Harry saw that all the school had gone silent and that the sorting had stopped. It seemed as if everyone had been listening to him, and he lowered his head in shame. He did not want everyone to start seeing him as more of a role model as he, unfortunately, already was. He just wanted a peaceful year, and the first thing he had managed just as he had arrived at school had been to attract attention. Even though he was ashamed of all the attention bestowed upon him, he hoped that at least it served for something. As the sorting started once again, he looked up into the professors' table and he saw Headmistress McGonagall giving him a curt nod of approval.
Before any could notice, they realised that they were almost at Hogwarts, so they decided to change into their robes before it was too late. When they arrived, they descended the train, and they took a carriage just for the five of them. They could see a lot of people around them looking strangely at the carriages, and Harry realised that they were seeing the Thestrals for the first time. It was just another sign that they had gone through a war, that too many children had been fighting alongside it, and that despite their age, they had seen too much death. Seeing this brought his insecurities back to Harry, and he could see that his peers were the same, because the sombre feeling that they had initially in their compartment had returned. They were no longer cheerful, but expectant.  What would Hogwarts be like? Could they see the signs of destruction in the walls? Would they be reminded of that fateful night at every step they took? Harry was not sure he was ready to see Hogwarts again, but he could do nothing now. He had decided to return, and so he would put a brave face on, and we would not let the ghosts haunt him, whoever difficult it may be. If he let them, Merlin knows what could happen.
“It’s nice to see you too, Mrs Weasley.”
A man who appeared to be in his sixties stood up, though Harry did not know who he was.
Hermione, as always the voice of reason, had already deciphered where it was – “Well, it’s quite obvious don’t you think Harry” – at seeing the look of incredulity that he gave her, she decided to give him another little clue – “She has said that our dorms are in the third floor, Harry. Does that ring any bells?” – again, he just gave her a look of incredulity, but she was having fun leading them on, so she continued without telling where it was, and decided to give him a final clue – “Come on, Harry, it is not that hard. Now think quickly, because we managed not to get killed, so I would not like to get expelled, because we broke our curfew the first day, it would be so much worse”.
“So, you are looking for him to apologise?”
“I’m testifying on behalf of Mrs Malfoy as well as on behalf of Draco Malfoy.”
“Right? Which is absurd because he has not been here for seven years, but still… it’s just like he has to still be there, with the trapdoor and everything else… please could someone else just open it? We just… we just can’t…”
“I Swear on my Magic” – said Hermione. Swearing on your magic was not just a means to word an oath, but it was truly a swear to do whatever you had been asked, in this case, to tell the truth, or your magic would be taken away. Harry was thankful that they just had to give a statement, because if they had had to answer questions, Harry was not sure if he would’ve been able to answer without telling a lie, after all, no one could know about Horcruxes, and many things about the war revolved around them. The advantage of this oath was that it worked better than Veritaserum, because everything you said was known to be the truth, and you were not forced to just be able to answer direct questions. While he was musing in his thoughts, he heard Minister Schaklebolt speaking up again and asking Hermione to state her full name to the Wizengamot members.
When they descended the carriages, he could immediately feel a hand gripping his. He looked around expecting to see destruction everywhere but instead, he found Hogwarts just as it had ever been. Clearly a lot of effort had been put into the repairs during the summer, in order for Hogwarts to be the same for all the students coming back. At seeing everyone starting to go up into the castle Harry started to walk to, but he realised that Hermione was not moving; she was rooted in place gripping Harry’s hand for dear life. Harry saw that she had her eyes fixed into something, and when she followed her gaze, he saw that she was staring at the Astronomy Tower. He realised that she was clearly remembering the day that he had jumped and seemed lost in time. He quickly told his friends to keep going and he turned facing Hermione. With his free hand, she took gently Hermione’s face and made her look at him in the eyes.
Harry could not believe what he had heard. They had managed to avoid Draco and Narcissa being sent to Azkaban. Although it had been their intention when they testified, Harry had not truly believed that they would be able to do it, because the Malfoy’s had committed many crimes. Even though he was not ecstatic about them being out, he understood why it had to be done, and deep down, he was grateful for it. They did not deserve to go to Azkaban. The Members of the Wizengamot left the courtroom, and after them, the Malfoy’s were taken away. Finally, Minister Shacklebolt spoke again, dismissing everyone from the courtroom.
Once again, Hermione ignored what Blaise was saying, and instead said – “I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good”. – as she said this ink started spreading through the parchment until it formed the words “
“I guess that your letter more or less says the same, Hermione. So what do you think that we should do? Because I’m not certain whether or not we should help her…”
As she was saying this, it was then that she realised that she had had the answer to finding Harry in front of her all the time, but in all her stress she had not realised it.
“Oh, come on Harry! Merlin knows I would not have seen past that first Halloween had it not been for you two! So, don’t tell me that we would have been better without you, because we wouldn’t have. Just like you wouldn’t have been able to make it through if it had not been for us, and you know it. We needed each other then, and we need each other now.”
“I am testifying on behalf of Mrs Malfoy and Draco Malfoy”
As always, kudos and comments are always welcome.
As she left the dorms, she started running as fast as she could towards the Astronomy Tower, where the name

“Miss. Granger, you may make your statement.”
Professor McGonagall talked about how Draco Malfoy had always been an exemplary student, the top of his house, and one of the best of his year. She made emphasis in stating that Draco had just been a child, just like Harry had said, and she also said that during Draco’s last year, he had participated as little as he could in the tortures implemented by the Carrow Brothers. Instead, he tried to help the students every time he could. Finally, which highly surprised Harry, as well as Hermione for what he could see, was that Professor McGonagall said that she had decided to implement an eight-year for all those who had not been able to do properly their last year due to the war, in order for them to finish their studies and do their news, and she told in front of the whole Wizengamot, that she was willing to admit Draco Malfoy into Hogwarts, and that she was also willing to make sure that he followed all the rules and did not commit any more crimes, as well as follow everything implemented by the Wizengamot if they decided to give him the conditional.
Harry stood, as did Hermione. Surprisingly for him, he saw Professor McGonagall also stand up from the crowd assembled in the atrium, as well as Andromeda Tonks, who he had not seen in the crowd. He was surprised to see her because the day before she had not mentioned going to the trial, however, taking into account that Narcissa was her sister, he should not have been that surprised. No one else, apart from them four stood up. Harry silently tanked Merlin, that no one else stood, because he firmly believed that the four of them were there to defend rather than accuse, and he did not want anyone presenting more crimes if they wished to free both Narcissa and Draco.

“Merlin Harry, give a woman some warning please, you almost gave me a heart attack! I thought you were sleeping!”
Once again, an uproar could be heard around the courtroom. Once everyone had quieted down again, which took much longer this time, Kingsley Shacklebolt finally told him to make his statement, and so Harry commenced.
When there was only one hour left until curfew, Harry was still missing, and Hermione did not know where else to look. She had looked in the Room of Requirement, the Astronomy Tower, the Quidditch Pitch, the Owlery, and everywhere else where she could access, and Harry was nowhere to be found, so he either was managing to avoid them whenever they got near, or he was located in the only place left that Hermione had not been able to look at; the Chamber of Secrets, because, unfortunately, she had no way of entering it, as contrary to Ron, she did not know the necessary words to enter it.
“Oh, good, you are awake! Tell me, Mr. Potter, how are you feeling?”
“Okay, M-m-mum” – he managed to say between sobs.
Harry took his wand from the nightstand and with a faraway look, he cast a precise
Everyone in the courtroom stood up waiting for the Minister for Magic, who presided the trial, to enter and take his seat.
At hearing those words Harry started sobbing. Hearing the acceptance in Mrs Weasley – Molly – and hear her call him part of her family broke his heart. He truly belonged, even if he was not able to believe it before, he could see it now, he truly belonged with this family, his family.
“I don’t know Hermione, I’ve just caused so much pain to them since they met me that I could not fathom why they would like to keep in contact with me. I know that they care for me” – he said before Hermione could respond – “but sometimes is still hard for me to believe why anyone would care, even you… For Gryffindor, everyone knows that if you had not been friends with me you would not have been through that much!”
“Harry, when you're leaving here I’m coming home with you.”
Silently, Hermione walked down the steps of the atrium and walked up to the stand to the designed place for witnesses. After she had seat, an Auror came to the stand to take her oath.
“And who are you testifying for, Mr Potter?”
Kudos and comments are always welcome :)
”; however, as she looked up, instead of seeing emerald eyes, she saw herself face to face with the chocolate-brown eyes of Blaise Zabini. She immediately started apologizing, not having meant to bother anyone, much less if they were probably on their way to pick their books to go to class, - ‘Oh my god, I’m so, so sorry I hadn’t meant to bump into you; I was just trying to see if I could find Harry or if anyone had seen him. Oh wait; have you seen Harry anywhere?” – she asked as she realised that Blaise might have seen him leave or knew where he had gone to.
Okay, so I'm back.
Harry, as Hermione had suspected had not gone to class, and therefore, she hadn’t either. She could not shake the bad feeling that something bad was going to happen out of her body and therefore had been unable to concentrate in class. It was for that reason that she had gone to McGonagall and had told her that she did not know where Harry was and that she was worried and asked her to get a permit to miss class for that day while she looked for him. However, she had not told her what had happened that morning, because she did not want to break Harry’s trust, and also because she was not ready to admit that she might also have a problem, and that was why things had escalated so quickly… McGonagall had granted her the permit, being also worried about her honorary Grandson, and had told Hermione, that if by curfew she hadn’t found him, to tell her so that she could help her look.
Once she had finished her statement, Minerva McGonagall was called to the stand, in order to give the last statement for the trial.
“Well, it’s just that we kind of had a fight, and he left the dorm room and I have not seen him since…”
“Finally, Harry, I was starting to think that I would have to come and fetch you.”
“Yes, you do, Harry! Before the war you would have never avoided the Weasleys, you had never dreaded meeting them, the contrary! Why this change all of a sudden?”
“See, we told you it was here. It must have a glamour in it for those who are not allowed entrance.”
He went into the living room expecting to see a sombre ambient, but he was met with a scene which he had seen many times before. Everyone screaming to one another to be heard, chaos everywhere, and it was just like coming back home. It was difficult to ignore the evident void made by Fred but, even though every now and then you could see a sad face, even George was laughing again, like old times. He had been able to carry on, and this made Harry feel that if they had been able too, he could too. He could live for those whom they had lost, for those that couldn’t live anymore.
“Ron, Hermione is right… – said Harry – he might be a git, but everything that happened back in school was just childish rivalry between two people with different views. Beside, as Hermione said the other day to me, one is not born knowing what a mudblood is, but is taught so. If you had been in his place, you would have acted the same as him, and vice-versa.”
He left the living room, went up the stairs and entered their room. He got ready for bed, and then he tried to sleep. He tossed and turned, but he couldn’t settle his mind. He couldn’t stop thinking about Mrs Malfoy’s letter, and about what Hermione had said. It was true, without Malfoy’s and his mother’s help, they wouldn’t have been able to survive this war. The fights with Malfoy throughout the years had only been a childish rivalry, without really meaning any harm. They were not children anymore, it was not time for childish rivalries to guide his decisions. His testimony could save Malfoy’s life, who, though not innocent, had also helped the Light side win this war, and therefore deserved to, at least, not be sent to prison. With his mindset, he tried to sleep once more. Mere minutes later, he heard Hermione enter their room and wander towards her bed, and decided that now was an as good time as any to tell her his decision and give her, too, some peace of mind.
“Of course it is here. Now place your hands and you will see how we are right”
“Well said, George. I know more than anyone how hard it can be to abandon your family and, also, what it is like to be brought up in a Dark family. I was seventeen when I decided to marry Ted and leave my family behind. I, just like Draco, had been groomed into being the perfect heir since I was born; it is not an easy feat to leave all that you know behind. When Draco was forced into taking the Dark Mark, he had just celebrated his sixteenth birthday, he was just a young man forced to replace a much older person. That is no easy deed. His father was in prison and they had threatened to kill his mother, he had no other option. No one believes a Slytherin when they say that they want to change, believe me, I know that, everyone just believes that you are lying and are trying to spy, so he had no choice but follow his father’s steps and do the task given to him. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up for our enemies, Harry and Hermione, and for that reason, I thank you for agreeing to help not only my nephew but also my sister, because even though I might have had a strained relationship with them these past years, I would never wish them imprisonment in Azkaban.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, but he is also the one who refused to acknowledge Harry back in the Manor, Ron! You know that had it not been for him, we would not have been able to survive that day! And then what? Voldemort would’ve won.”
They sat at their table and immediately heard the doors of the Great Hall opening. In they came a line of nervous first years guided by Deputy Headmaster Flitwick. When they arrived at the front Professor Flitwick started calling them all for them to be sorted. The first to be sorted went into Gryffindor, and Harry applauded with all he had for the little boy. When the next boy was sorted into Slytherin, Harry applauded with as much might. Everyone in the Great Hall started staring at him, and when Neville asked him why he was applauding a Slytherin, he responded confidently.
- Draco Malfoy/Blaise Zabini
"What do I mean everyone? The whole Weasley family and all your friends, of course!"
With love,
I know, I know, it is a little short, however, it is longer than the last one, so that is something, I suppose.
“I get it, Hermione, believe me, I do. But I still don’t know for sure if his redemption act is enough for us to forgive everything that he has done to us through the years. Just let me think about it some more time and sleep it over, and tomorrow I’ll tell you what I think.”
Of course, there were days when it was truly hard to keep going on, like the day when Hermione found out that she could not reverse what she had done to her parents. That day was not only hard for Hermione, but also for Harry. He did not know what to do, how to calm her sister, he wanted to put a brave face for her, but inside he too was broken, remembering once again those who had lost along the way, all the sacrifices they had had to do to win this war. It was in days like this when it was harder to carry on, when he wondered whether if it would be best to end it all. But then he remembered Hermione, and he forced himself to keep trying, just for her. She, just like him, could not lose another person. It would be too much to bear. They had been through too much, been to too many funerals in a short time, and they would not be able to say goodbye to another family member, just like they had to do to Fred, Remus and Tonks.
It was true, Mrs Malfoy had saved his life by lying to Voldemort, but it had all been because of his son, not because she cared about him or his cause. However, he trusted Hermione with his life, and if she said that it was safe, he would believe her. So, taking a deep breath, he opened the letter and he started to read.
Love, Jem
It was true, and he knew it, but it was so hard to understand that. Even though he might have saved Ginny that second year, and had seen Mr Weasley being attacked, he had also been the cause of endangering Ron and his whole family so many times, like that one when they had burned the Burrow to the ground…
He suddenly lifted his head and realised that he had arrived at the Astronomy Tower. He did not know how he had arrived there, but he did not find the will to care anymore. Being in this tower always brought to his mind memories of the day that Dumbledore had died, how he had fallen down the Tower into his death, and once again he was brought to his remorseful thoughts. Dumbledore's death had been so simple, so sad. A quick Avada Kedavra and a quick fall and everything had stopped for him. What a simple death for such a powerful man. It filled him with impotency to think of his death because it was another one that he could have avoided, another place where he had failed; if he had not been trapped under his cloak he could have done something, been better, and Dumbledore might still be alive.
“Well, I know you probably won’t like this idea, but I truly think that we should testify in his favour, and not only for his but also for his Mother’s” – Harry was going to interrupt her when Hermione lifted her hand in a stopping motion – “No, wait a moment, just hear me out first, Harry. I know that Malfoy was a jerk to us in school, believe me, I know that. However, we cannot forget that he did not do this willingly. Yes, he is a Death Eater, but he was forced into being one, and you know that. You, better than anyone, know what Voldemort was capable of. Malfoy just wanted to protect his family, even if they were on the wrong side. He did not know any other means to protect them, no one had ever given him any other option but to follow his father’s steps. You saw how disturbed he was during sixth year when he had the mission to kill Dumbledore, and in the end, he was not capable of doing it. He just did everything that he could to protect his family, just like you went through everything to protect yours. And the same goes for Mrs Malfoy, she was just following her husband to protect herself as well as her son. She lied to Voldemort because of her son. She decided that it was worth it to give you a chance of defeating Voldemort for her son to have a better future than the one he would have gotten if Voldemort had won. Even though they did horrible things throughout this war, without them we would not have won, we would have lost long before the battle of Hogwarts and you know it. So yes, Harry, I believe that we should testify in their favour, even though I don’t believe that they should be given a full pardon, I do believe that maybe we should help them get parole.”
