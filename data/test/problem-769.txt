Harry frowned, remembering the moment right after Draco had pushed him off the chair and out of his realm, watching as the blond's brows furrowed.
There was a knock on the door, and Buxley poked his head in. "Sir, Lee wants you down at the clinic."
"You admitted yourself that you aren't on the top of your game. Besides, Jon—" Buxley grimaced at being addressed by his first name, "—you're the Deputy Head, for Merlin's sake. There's no
He gasped for breath, but the spike had punctured his lung, and he retched, splattering his already dirty shirt with blood. Collapsing onto his knees, he looked up into her icy eyes and swore, once and for all, that he would never make the mistake of working with evil bitches again.
"Camilla," Malfoy groaned, but the blonde witch had apparently had enough of listening to Malfoy because Harry heard the clacking of her heels moving towards him.
Kingsley shrugged a shoulder, the corner of his mouth twitching. "That you did all on your own. All I had to say was, 'Have you met Harry Potter? There's not a chance he'd be on vacation if he was involved in this,' and everyone believed me in no time."
"Hi, sweetheart! How are you?" Harry laughed as Lily barrelled into him, and he picked her up, twirling her around. "Did you miss me?"
She opened her mouth to say something, but there was a ping from the kitchen and she bustled away. He sipped on his tea slowly as he waited for her to come back, and she did, about five minutes later, with a tray of freshly-baked biscuits in her hands.
"Er," was the only response Draco could manage to that heartfelt and unexpected confession. "Why're you telling
"I've been great. Finally managed to get a day off today since I've been working all weekend. How about you?"
"I swear, Neville, if you start giving me a speech with apologies or telling me how grateful you are, I'll chuck you out of this truck right now."
"Buxley, I know you hate being stuck with paperwork, and trust me when I say I empathise with you pretending like you're interested in what I'm doing just to get out of doing paperwork, but I need those to be on Mrs Weasley's desk in an hour. So you may want to make some headway soon, or I won't be hearing the end of it from her, and you'll be doing paperwork all weekend."
"Right, then," he muttered, picking up the pen and pressing it to the parchment. He was about to sign his name—his
Harry squeezed his hand. "Exactly. Besides, you've been to the human realm before; why are you hesitating now?"
"No!" She stood up, grabbed her purse, the envelope, and the drawing, her eyes filling with tears once again. "No, sir! It has to be the Head Auror. Grandfather
He twirled the quill in his fingers, spraying droplets of ink around. Swearing under his breath, he Scoured the desk, but in the process, knocked over the pot of ink. It crashed to the floor, staining the beige carpet a deep blue so dark it was almost black.
"No, never mind. It's not important. I'll tell you once you get home. It's just something that cropped up at work. So, how're things there?"
He sighed. "Ginny's career picked up around the same time. The Harpies made it into the later rounds of the World Cup, went on tour, and she was gone for months at a time. I was offered the Head Auror position sooner than later, thanks to Ron and my effort in 'revolutionising the department', and that's when I sort of hit the brakes and thought about what I wanted from my personal life."
"She appears to be quite anxious," Kingsley commented as he watched Hermione disappear into Harry's office.
Malfoy sighed, looking tired, and finally nodded. "If that is your choice, I can barely argue with it, considering we've already put you through this ordeal of having to choose a different healer."
"There," she said, sitting back and pushing the drawing towards him. He looked to see what she'd done and saw that she'd drawn little arrow marks from the mouth, handles and support of the vase and written
Once the kids were all settled in, he switched the lights off and was about to go downstairs when Molly called up the stairs.
Draco smiled. Before he could stop himself, he asked, "Why didn't you and Ginny Weasley get married?"
She stopped struggling and stared at him for a long moment before sticking her nose in the air and saying, "You have no reason to apologise for a mistake that isn't yours, sir."
Draco blinked languidly, the skin between his brows crinkling in a frown as his gaze fell on Harry, the confusion evident in his gunmetal eyes.
"So, as I was saying," she began as she took off her oven mitts and placed them on the table. "You should tell Ginny."
Harry grinned as he watched Neville jog off. For all the brain and brawn the man had gained since the war, in the face of Robards, he was still reduced to the blustering boy he used to be back during their time at Hogwarts.
"Yeah. It got really bad at one point, and Gran demanded that I either go see a Mind Healer or have her dose my food and drink with dreamless sleep potions," Neville said with a wry smile.
"You hardly eat anything," Hermione commented as they cleaned their plates, drawing Draco out of his thoughts.
"What I don't understand," Harry said, trying to look as unfazed as possible, although his heart was beating faster by the minute, "is why you thought it necessary to keep something this important from me."
"I don't believe that," Harry said. "Your father told you to go into hiding, didn't he? For that, you would have to leave this—" he waved his hand, not wanting to say the word, "—birdcage, and he seemed quite confident in you being able to do that."
She broke off, unable to complete the train of thought, but Draco nodded anyway, knowing what she meant. Mr Simpson didn't look too happy, but he knew Astoria would take care of it and went off to call the authorities and inform them of his son's unexplainable disappearance.
"Did you come here for something, Parkinson, or am I simply obliged to bear with your obnoxious presence this morning?" I snap, hardly having the patience for her supercilious personality.
"It's a great school, if you ask me. You'll have to go and look at it for yourself to be convinced, though. And I'm sure they'll come up with a concession for you, seeing as how you're the One-Who-Slayed-The-Dark-Lord."
He didn't understand why Hermione had just so readily upped and decided to go with him either. She had
Malfoy shrugged. "Because you wouldn't be here if you wanted people to know, and I have enough pride as a Mind Healer to know when to keep my mouth shut."
"A little higher, Harry, that's right," Ginny said, ignoring his question. He raised his hand as she fiddled with the other end, moving her wand slowly so it didn't drop.
Smiling, he brushed the hair out of her face and was just about to Transfigure the cushion at her feet into a blanket when a soft tinkling caught his ear. Curious, he looked around till he found the source of the sound—which turned out to be a mobile phone, probably the one Ron had given her, in the pocket of her coat that hung on the stand by the front door.
"Yes, we are. Hermione!" he yelled. Hermione stepped into the car and slammed the door shut with a huff. Harry stared at her, and she bristled but rolled down the window anyway and had a hushed conversation with her husband.
"Stand up," Harry commanded, his voice booming in the silence of the night, and three Aurors burst in, wands brandished.
Harry grinned as he tore the parchment in half and wrote a second letter addressed to Neville. "Sounds about right."
Hermione stretched her arm out and pointed below the balcony, her eyes moving back and forth as she continued to read. Harry leant over and spotted the trio in a small space between the bushes, building what looked like a small kingdom, moats and all.
Harry nodded. "Thanks." As he stepped outside to take the call, he noticed Camilla grin at Malfoy, who shot her a furious look.
Hermione swallowed, tears having returned to her brown eyes. It hurt him to see her so distraught, especially considering he was the cause for it, but he knew that she understood his pain better than anyone else. "What can I do?" she asked.
She finally sat down, causing Buxley, who had been standing very close to the chair, to jump back when the chair scraped backwards. Hermione stared at Harry intently as she continued. "I remember being curious about them and doing a little out-of-text research, which is where I remember reading about the Barkridges."
He ducked into the Leaky Cauldron just as the rain started to come down hard. Taking off his coat and ruffling his wet hair, he scanned the crowded pub, trying to find Neville.
Stuffing his hands in his pockets, he stormed out of the castle and down to the Black Lake, thinking bitterly that the last thing he needed just then was
Harry looked down at himself. He sat forwards, looked around, moved his hands and legs. "I feel… fine. I don't feel any different than before, just that I'm calmer, now."
He sighed and caressed her cheek. "No. It's because I can't end up losing you as well." He turned her to face the fireplace so she could read the message over it. "Whoever kidnapped Scorpius is clearly after me, and I can't have him go after you too, in his pursuit of revenge." He turned her back to face him. "We may not be married anymore, but I still stand by my wedding vows, Astoria. And I wouldn't survive it if I lost you too."
He had just sat down when the door opened and Malfoy strode in, white robes billowing behind him. Harry sprang up, and, rubbing his sweaty palms on the side of his pants, stood staring at Malfoy nervously. The blond wizard simply shot him a curious look before motioning for him to take a seat. Harry nodded and sat on the edge of the plush armchair, consciously controlling his urge to bounce his knee. He was already in an awkward situation, and the last thing he needed was for Malfoy to think he was making Harry nervous.
"Oh, come on, Harry, you know why! You were looking forward to this trip so much and I just didn't have the heart to tell you!"
"Oh. Oh, that's because I'm the current owner of Grimmauld Place, and since the vase was stolen from there, it now belongs to me. Not that I want it, of course," he added, feeling like he had to defend himself for some reason.
"Don't give me cheek, Hermione, I'm really in no mood for it," he snapped as he strode into his office.
"It wasn't presumptuous of you." When Draco continued to squint at him, Harry chuckled and said, "I would've continued to hit on you all evening if you hadn't told me off."
Buxley eyed him with mild disgust and gestured towards Lisa. "You want me to bring her in for questioning?"
"It's so good to see you!" she exclaimed, surprising him with a warm hug before she sat down on the chair across from him. She took off her coat and muffler, laying them across her lap, and looked up at him with a smile. Although Audrey and he weren't all that close, since he had never really been close with Percy, she still greeted him like an old friend every time they met, and it made Harry feel much more comfortable than if she were awkward with him. "So, how've you been?"
Harry frowned as they paused in the foyer doorway and he observed a balding blond head from an armchair facing Malfoy and Professor Greengrass. "The reporter?" he asked, his blood beginning to boil at the thought of the notorious journalist who had a penchant for getting to witnesses before the Aurors did and publicising potential evidence in an exaggerated manner. "How'd he get inside?"
Initially, she hadn't really complained all that much, saying she understood that his work was important, but during the past couple months, she'd constantly been on edge. The stress from the upcoming tournaments she was supposed to cover was taking a toll on her. Considering that—and her already-fiery temper—Harry had decided to ship the children off to all their cousins' houses every chance he got. It was either that or deal with everyone screaming at the top of their lungs and Lily's incessant crying.
Harry raised his eyebrows at the name and glanced towards Malfoy, who said in an affectionate voice, "Scorpius hates leeks and she accidentally gave him leek soup on her first day."
"Right." He stood and walked across the room to where she was standing. "Anyway, I promise to keep you in the loop so you don't have to worry about me so much."
Camila looked up with a curious expression. "Actually, we recommend that they do. A lot of them retain their aliases through the course of their consultation, no matter how long it is. That allows them the freedom to go about their normal lives and doesn't tie them to us in any way other than their pseudonyms."
Pansy hums in thought, her expression sobering. "That's the first time you've spoken about her since the funeral, you know."
Just as he was coming to a decision, the two returned. As he took his seat, Malfoy said, "I apologise again. I understand that you would like to get to know the person you decide to confide in, so maybe there is some way for us to make that happen."
The blond then moved his hands so that he had his thumbs pressed against Harry's temples and had his fingers splayed across the sides of his head, applying pressure on different spots along the back. "Tell me when to stop," he said again as he began to massage the pressure points.
alone time. He had just reached his new favourite spot—a mangled old tree hidden behind a construction quay—when he found it to be already occupied.
“You are such a—” Draco laughed, Harry joining him, and the moment was so pure and full of happiness that Draco never wanted it to end.
He Apparated home, directly into the cellar, and hoped his parents wouldn’t notice he was back. Picking up a bottle of Firewhiskey, he popped the cork and took a long swig, hissing at the familiar burn that trailed down his throat.
Malfoy seemed to be holding back the urge to sigh. "I apologise for that comment—it was unprofessional. The reason I said your nightmares may not be random is that you said you've been sleeping restlessly for some time, now. It could just be that you don't recall them."
That relationship was one no one had really understood—not even the two in it, apparently—but they'd parted ways rather amicably. Luna now had twin boys and was happily frolicking around the world in her search for exotic, mythical creatures. Nobody had even known that Luna had gotten married until one day when she randomly invited them all to a party at her house and introduced her husband, Rolf, to them. Once she announced that he was a Magizoologist and Newt Scamander's grandson, though, nobody was really all that surprised.
Haryy held up his hands, and she threw her arms out in frustration before walking away. He sighed as he pulled on his clothes, feeling the beginning of a headache. Rummaging inside the cupboard, he pulled out a half-empty bottle of Firewhiskey and took long gulps, revelling at the feel of the burning trail as it slid smoothly down his throat. Who cared about drinking alcohol in the morning? If he was going to have to deal with bipolar-Ginny, hyperactive kids, Kingsley's mind games and everything else, he was going to need more than just a simple energising draught.
A flash of red eyes and limp hair, the feel of skeletal fingers against his throat, the smell of rotting flesh…
"The point is that I'm doing the same things I always do in a place that's not home," Hermione answered, barely pausing in her reading.
"'Til I pull a muscle or strain my back or do something else that gets me back in the hospital again?"
"Oh, the wizard in charge of the west gate just appeared with a whole battalion of guards. They're sending away the crowd. I'll be able to go in once the guards are sure no one managed to sneak in."
But, most of all, he hated the prolonged periods when Ginny would seem to forget that he and the rest of her family existed outside of her little world. In a way, it was a good thing that she could focus on her work so completely without any distractions, but it made him wonder…
"Oh, for heaven's sake." The blond snapped his fingers and a bucket appeared over Harry, overturning and dousing him with cold water. "There, that should clear your head."
Harry smiled, leaning back in his seat. "Speaking of your boss, where is he? I haven't seen him around since I came in."
For a second, Harry thought of lying, but he immediately decided against it. If there was anyone he could talk to about his nightmares, it was Neville.
She looked up, her cheeks now the colour of cherries, and her wide, hazel eyes filled with tears. He felt terrible for wanting to laugh at her as she was the perfect image of a damsel in distress, and he felt the intrinsic need to help her.
Harry shook his head as he stirred his tea. "No, I haven't. I was going to do that today when I…" he shrugged and trailed off, gesturing vaguely.
"Camilla," Malfoy said, his smile tight and his voice crisp. "That is for Mr Potter to decide. He's in a hurry right now, and I would rather he make an important decision such as this when he has had more time to consider his options."
Harry tuned them out as Hermione started to yell at Ron, his focus returning to Ginny—who had now wandered to the gate, still on the phone, having what seemed like a furious exchange with the caller. He was dying to know whom she was speaking with, to the extent of wondering whether he still had any Extendible Ears left, but just then, Angelina drove up and honked, and Ginny got off the phone.
That seemed to pique Draco's curiosity enough for him to look up from his ministrations. "How do you mean?"
Looking around, he found that he had come to a more residential part of the town, away from the main street. It was quieter, with trees and gardens and fences. Harry walked down the road and spotted a small park to the right. He hummed in thought as he walked towards the park, making as little noise as possible. Standing behind a tree, he looked around and found the boy. The blond was sitting behind a bench on the farthest side of the park, eating the bread.
He nodded, pulling Ginny close and kissing her. "I'll miss you," he said as they moved apart, and she gave him a sad little smile.
Images of his childhood before Hogwarts flashed through his mind, but now it was all much worse because his past self had juxtaposed over the boy he had seen, and coupled with the nightmare… he shuddered, feeling shaken up.
It didn't take him as long as the first time to find Malfoy's office, but the maze of corridors were still confusing and he almost lost his way a few times. He knocked on the door three times and waited to hear the familiar voice giving him permission to enter before he pushed it open and stepped in.
"I wasn't trying to mother you," Hermione said, her voice taking on a defensive tone. "I'm just concerned. I thought you had gotten over your trauma, like the rest of us."
"Oh, it was fantastic," Hermione said with a grin, pulling Neville into a hug. "Neville! So good to see you! How
George generally let his and his siblings' children use some of the less dangerous prototypes just to see their reactions and get their opinions on what they liked or disliked, or what could be added or removed. He used these inputs and made changes, because with the rather wide age-range of the next generation Potter-Weasley children, it helped him and Ron formulate merchandise for their target audience and devise appropriate marketing strategies, especially now that they were about to convert Zonko's into a second shop in Hogsmeade.
Harry raised his eyebrows and shook his head, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips. Never would he have thought that the day would come when he would be sitting across from Draco Malfoy, talking about their children, and hear Malfoy admit that he had been an annoying little prat back in the day.
Astoria crossed her arms. "No, he didn't. I've been waiting here this entire time and never saw him."
Draco's eyes were still wide, his grey irises shimmering with flecks of silver, and he reached up to place his hand on Harry's. "Why indeed."
She flushed, her face going red all the way to her hairline, and giggled in an embarrassed way. Harry smiled at her reaction. No matter how many years passed, it always amused him to see the way people reacted when he introduced himself. Almost every other time they never gave him a second glance, but the moment he told them he was
"I can't thank you enough," he said, his voice trembling. He pulled away, his eyes moist with unshed tears. "I feel like every time I see you, you end up saving me."
"Rosie and Lily'll be thrilled. They've been complaining about how there are too many boys and not enough girls."
She made a frustrated sound and pressed her handkerchief to her cheeks. After a moment, she started to say something else, but a sudden thought struck Harry.
"Harry, you know I love you and the children very much, and that we love having them here…" she paused, a conflicted expression on her face, and he turned towards her, worried.
Harry waved his hand. "Oh, yeah, yeah, nothing serious. Just some vase that got left behind from my previous case. He wanted to know I want to do with it."
Harry Potter, their entire demeanour did a 180 and they would treat him like he could walk on water.
She turned towards him with a smile. "And that's about it for this tour. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to take parents around when lessons are in session, so you'll have to come during an open day or schedule a special time for that. Maybe you can come with Ginny, too. What do you think?"
There was a long moment of silence, after which Buxley slowly raised his arms and pulled Harry's hands from his shoulder. "First of all, please stop doing that," he said as he let Harry's hands go. "And, second of all, if I may say so respectfully, you sound mad."
"Well," Harry said, "for starters, whoever targeted Lisa today and allegedly stole the blueprint not only knew that she was here, in London, but also where she was staying,
Malfoy only smiled and clapped his hands. Harry turned to the side, and just as expected, Leeky the House-Elf appeared, bowing low.
"That's right! I saw these on sale when I was out buying things for the shop and I thought why not, you know?"
He held it there, one hand clutching the broken lamp, stretched above his head, and the other placed palm up, pressed against the carpet. Staring at his palm, he let his arm drop as sobs wracked his body. He fell to the side, pulled his legs to his chest, curled into a foetal position, and sobbed into his knees. The screaming didn't stop. The undead creature didn't go away. The itching didn't desist.
He held his breath and closed his eyes, feeling the burn of exhaustion under his eyelids. "Yeah. He's the head of some department."
Malfoy's voice was deep and soothing, and Harry didn't want to open his eyes. He just wanted to lean back against the cool leather of the armchair and fall asleep. He was tired… so, so tired, and sleep seemed like the most wonderful solution to all of his problems.
Tapping the phone against his chin, he began to pace, his mind whirring from the new information he'd just received. So Ginny was going somewhere, but it wasn't with Angelina. Or maybe it
As though reading his mind, Camilla said, "Rest assured that Draco knows nothing about this. As I said in my message, this is an unofficial meeting that I deemed necessary for personal reasons."
Feeling guilty, Harry patted his son on the head and said, "She misses you, too, Al, but she's busy. You know that."
Trudging towards his study, barely noticing that he was wearing nothing but a damp towel on a cold November morning, he walked towards his desk. Pulling open the drawer, he took out an envelope and a sheet of parchment and placed them neatly on the tabletop. Sitting down on the edge of his seat, he picked up his quill, dipped it twice in the pot, touched the nib against the edge of the glass container to ensure it wouldn't drip, and placed it against the page.
Harry smiled and pulled her into a hug, inhaling deeply to keep his own emotions in check, and said, "You don't have to do anything. Just knowing you're here for me when I need you is more than enough."
Before Harry could react he was dry again, but as Draco had said, the fog he hadn't realised he was slipping into had disappeared. "How did you do that?"
She looked up at Harry, then, a hopeless expression on her face. "I couldn't save him. I did everything, I tried everything, but I barely had enough knowledge as a Healer to help him. I couldn't save him. And then, a few weeks later I received news that Ray had lost his life in a failed extraction and they had just managed to recover his body."
“Why, though?” Draco was still sceptical about Potter’s motives. His reasoning so far sounded like a load of hogwash.
He spun on his heel and stormed out, slamming the door shut behind him, the image of a wide-eyed, startled Harry bringing a smirk to his face.
Malfoy's expression shifted for an instant, and he seemed to expand, his eyes growing stormy. "Forgive me if I'm wrong, but did you perchance agree to this
She pursed her lips. "I don't just want to fill a vacant post, and I most definitely don't want this promotion for the
Harry had been ready for some sort of entertaining reaction or the like from the man, but Buxley's attention was fixed on Liz.
He pointed his wand at the box and the cardboard dissolved to reveal the vase that had brought him so much misery. The goblin's eyes widened at the sight of it and he took a moment to examine the vase from all angles, nodding and making sounds of appreciation every now and again, before turning his attention back at Harry.
"It's called the Placebo Effect." Malfoy pointed at the teacup. "The effects of the Calming Draught. Can you still feel it?"
Draco's eyes were dark and stormy as he struggled in Harry's hold, but Harry only breathed out a laugh, shaking his head in awe at the sight before him. Draco stilled then, perhaps having read Harry's thoughts again, the frown disappearing from his face and his beak slowly contorting back to form lips and cheeks. His eyes were like liquid silver as he said, "How are you not disturbed by any of this?"
"That's not what I'll be hearing when I keel over," Arthur muttered to Harry as he walked past and sat himself down in his favourite armchair.
"OK, OK, come on, you two, no fighting. Can you tell me where Grandma is, Lily?" Harry turned to his daughter as he held Albus back.
"Fair enough." Kingsley reached for his cup, decided against it, and then continued. "Well, I suppose you should know—"
"I eat when I'm hungry," Draco groused, but the matron continued to complain about how skinny and unwell he always looked, making Hermione laugh.
"Don't you think he's cold?" Nevile asked after a time, when Lestrange shuddered, and Harry shrugged.
"Please don't cry," he said, reaching up to brush away the tear stains. "It's not as bad as it seems."
Harry grabbed his hand and said slowly, "Draco, that isn't a tattoo. It's a scar from when I was a child. You know that; I've told you."
Hermione turned to him and pulled off her sunglasses, her brown eyes swimming with worry. "Harry, is there something I should know?"
Harry nodded. "I've got Buxley looking up the extent of truth behind her story, but that's apparently harder than we initially thought because of all the black markets and illegal antique dealers involved."
"What's the fragrance you're using in here?" he asked, and she glanced at him sideways, her eyebrows raised.
Harry nodded vigorously, his heart pounding in his chest. It had been a while since Robards had ordered him around, and he remembered, now, why he'd been so nervous around the man. Robards was more intimidating than Kingsley was, and that was saying something.
When he said as much to Malfoy, the blond agreed. "That would be the best course of action, for now. But, since we didn't really get much done today, would it be alright for you to come back tomorrow?"
He swept his hand in a sort of lofty gesture, making Harry cock an eyebrow. "Well, alright, then. Come along, kids."
He shrugged. "Sure, why not? Angelina's probably having a hard time as it is, being banned from Quidditch and all, plus I know you've been quite stressed out about covering the tournament this season, so it'll be good for you."
"Alright, that's it, we're returning all of these," Hermione said crisply, piling the boxes together and putting them back in the bag.
"I know," Malfoy said just as softly, and Harry peeked out to see him smiling down at her in a heart-broken sort of way that moved something deep within Harry.
He looked around the room as he waited for Malfoy to return from dealing with some urgent matter. Malfoy's office was larger than Harry's living room back at home and was furnished with the most expensive-looking things Harry could think of. He'd only ever been to Malfoy Manor once, and that hadn't exactly been a visit where he could admire the décor, so he'd never really thought about
Harry cleared his throat and shot his deputy a small smile. "Thanks." He continued to remain standing behind his desk, the tips of his fingers pressed against the cool glass, and Buxley eyed him curiously.
"—but I have a strong feeling about this. Buxley, if anyone knew about the vase and that it was going to be stolen, it would've been Hertzfeld. If anyone knew to question the causes of his employers' deaths, it would've been Hertzfeld. If anyone knew that Lisa was going to come to me for help, it would've been Hertzfeld. And if
The Auror nodded again and left the office, leaving Harry to sit back and stretch. It had been a long, long day, and he wanted nothing more than to go home and collapse on his bed.
Harry groaned, wiping away the tears as he held his head in his hands, wishing, for the millionth time, that he could just
"You don't have to lie, just…don't tell him the truth," he whispered back, giving her a furious look.
Humming to himself, he folded the page neatly and placed it in the envelope. Sealing it shut, he carefully wrote the name and address of the recipient, staring at it for a long moment.
Harry ground his teeth together as he tried to breathe, and then, reaching down, picked the bottle up and took a swig.
He was standing at the balcony sometime past midnight, eyes closed and enjoying the cool night air, Neville and Ron's cheers as they watched the match the only thing distracting him from the drunken stupor he was slipping into, when his mind wandered back to the first time he had met Harry.
Harry felt his heart lurch and had to focus on breathing in and out and keeping the images and visions of people being tortured out of his mind. Camilla shook her head and brushed a hand across her face, as though trying to pull a mask over her heart-broken expression, and then glanced towards him.
"She's so quiet now, though," Harry said as he hugged his daughter close and pressed a kiss to her hair. She mumbled quietly and snuggled against him, making him smile.
She opened her mouth several times and closed it, looking like a fish out of water, and as he waited for her, Harry Summoned two teacups and the pot of tea he'd kept ready before calling for her. He poured the tea into the cups and placed one in front of her. She picked it up, looking grateful, and took a long, slow swig. A few moments later, she placed the cup back on its saucer, and he saw her relax. The Calming Draught mixed in with her tea was taking effect.
"Astoria and I decided to finalise our separation when Scorpius left to Hogwarts. It wasn't that we absolutely couldn't stand each other—or maybe it was, considering how much we used to argue—but we had reached a point where we just wanted very different things in life." He shifted, crossing his legs and looking off into the distance, and there was something very serene about his demeanour that placated Harry. "Astoria had steadily gained popularity for her potion-making experiments and discoveries and was being invited all over the world to give talks and whatnot. And I… I was happy with my little charitable clinic, away from the limelight; being able to give back to the wizarding world was my way of atoning for my sins."
As they reached the little carts, the goblin motioned to one and said, "Get in, please." Harry stepped in and barely had time to clutch the handlebars tight before the cart zoomed off down the winding tracks and finally halted abruptly before a vault.
"I prefer it that way," Kingsley replied, motioning for Harry to step into the empty lift. "So, Robards has reassured me that everything is going according to plan and that the DMLE's top brass have high expectations for you."
Harry nodded towards the medic and let him check Lestrange's pulse and wound. After a few moments, the wizard shook his head. Harry sighed.
Except the woman before him looked to be in her late twenties or early thirties, had pale, flawless skin, piercing blue eyes, short, straight, light-coloured hair, and was wearing woollen stockings and a long, figure-hugging sweater under her overcoat. The fact that someone as good-looking as her worked for a secret, private organisation was sort of…
Another volunteer asked Hermione something just then, and Draco settled down, ready to tackle the day's work. As he sorted through the newest entries to the camp, his mind wandered to his final interaction with Harry.
Harry had a feeling she wasn't really talking about the surprise, but he didn't push it. After a time, though, he asked, "Why were you so nervous about the whole thing?"
An amused smirk much like his own tugged at the corner of her lips, and Draco straightened with hope, only to be crushed moments later when she said, "No."
From what he could see, everyone outside of Harry's barrier were collapsed on the floor, and there seemed to be smoke emanating from the far wall. They watched as the smoke slowly turned a sickly shade of green.
He led her around the tent to the back, where Hermione was partaking in the basket-weaving class that a few townspeople conducted every week.
The blond didn't seem too bothered by Harry's comment, however. "The elves work for us and are paid for their services as well as provided housing."
His eyes fell on the family portrait on the table, his smile faltering and his eyes turning glazed. "It's strange," he murmured, and he looked so heartbroken that Harry felt this immense need to embrace him and tell him that everything would be alright. "He looks just like me but his personality's just like his mother's. He really is both our son. It's such an odd feeling, thinking about him like this."
scribbled on it hurriedly. It was probably the paper she'd written the name on when he'd spoken with her the other day.
"Barkridge. Lisanna Barkridge." The girl raised her hand, as though she would offer it to him, but then reached up and tucked a strand of her dark curls behind her ear. She had a weird accent that he couldn't place; like a mixture of an English accent with something else.
The forensics team head glanced at Harry, who nodded, then explained, "The Floo Network has a magical trace connecting various fireplaces that allows people to Floo from one location to another. A person can only travel to the places that their Floo is connected to. But, the problem with public-access Floos like yours is that it allows anybody to create a trace to it as long as they know its exact location."
Padma returned his grin and held out a hand. "It was a real pleasure seeing you again, Harry, despite the circumstances." She jerked her head towards her patiently waiting retinue. "I have to take my leave now, but maybe we can catch up and swap stories over a drink, sometime?" She winked. "And this time, I'll even come all the way to London just for you."
The woman frowned, recognition glittering in her dark eyes, and just as he thought she would shut the door in his face, she pulled it open and moved aside. He nodded his thanks as he stepped in, eyes moving around the small room till they settled on the bed, where an exhausted-looking Buxley was sleeping peacefully.
Although Draco wouldn't admit it, the jab had had considerable effect on him, and he turned away with a sigh, proceeding around to the back entrance of his clinic-cum-townhouse to unlock it and step inside.
He grinned and relaxed, glad that he'd decided to come talk to her. "See? This is exactly why I came to you first. If you were Ginny, you'd be dragging me off to some Mind Healer just about now."
In his attempt to keep his nightmares at bay and handle them, he'd unconsciously been spending less and less time sleeping, and everything that had happened over the past week had just all come together and culminated in the huge blowout that had just occurred. Everything Ginny had said was right; they had both been too stressed out lately, he was just taking out his frustrations and inability to deal with things on her, she wasn't making it any better by being halfway across the country, and the kids falling sick and finding a pre-school on he own was the icing on the top.
"Er," Harry said, suddenly feeling awkward. "Well, I didn't get any nightmares last night thanks to the massage, so…"
He looked up with a forced smile as Malfoy made his way to the sofa, looking embarrassed but mostly relieved. "I really must apologise for that." The blond made a vague gesture with his hand, and Harry shook his head.
"Kids, dinner!" he called as he Levitated the plates over to the table, smiling as the trio raced into the room, exclaiming happily.
"Of course, of course." She looked around, as though making sure no one was listening, and then, pulling them to a corner, said, "I also got permission to help with the transfer paperwork. Isn't that wonderful?"
Swallowing, and mentally slapping himself for being so paranoid, he watched them drive away, a sense of foreboding settling in the pit of his stomach.
"Hey!" He grabbed Lisa when she lunged at Buxley and sat her down with some force, pushing her back down when she attempted to jump to her feet. "Easy, there," he said, trying not to physically restrain her.
the one that asked him to be friends," Harry said, coming to stand beside Draco and holding an arm out in front of him protectively. "Don't take it out on him; he has nothing to do with anything."
Harry threw his head back and guffawed as Ginny fumed. "How can I not laugh? That's bloody brilliant!" he said as she shot him a withering look.
He waited, knowing that she would tell him eventually. If there was one thing he had learnt from being married to her for a little over a decade, it was that Ginny was someone who needed to be given space and time, and lots of patience. She would come forth with whatever she wanted to say on her own, and pressurising her wouldn't help in the least. In fact, pushing her worked to the opposite effect.
Neville nodded and stared at the table for a long minute. "I went to see him," he murmured almost inaudibly, and Harry hissed, a surge of anger shooting through him as he leant forward and slammed his palm down on the table.
He ripped open the envelope and unfolded the letter, scanning its contents as he sipped on his coffee. It wasn't anything urgent, just an update of everything that had been going on at the office while Harry was away, and on the vandalism case, and that the higher ups had sent someone else that morning to ask, once again, if the vase had been taken care of. Sighing, Harry decided it was faster to just head over instead of replying to the letter, so he finished his coffee and stood up.
, Harry thought as she ran towards him, holding out whatever it was that James had been desperate to show him.
"The Barkridges are a very powerful family even in Germany. Only a month after old man Barkridge's death, the secret investigation was called off by the same someone who had authorised it, and everything related to the event was swept under the rug."
"A Malfoy always repays his debts," Draco said seriously. "And the ones I owe you seem to be piling up."
Malfoy quietly Summoned parchment and a Self-Writing Quill and said, "Would you mind if I took down some notes, just for my reference?"
Before Draco could even begin to process what was happening, his mother had already ushered them inside and shut the door behind them. He could tell that his mother approved of his marriage to Potter, especially because Potter had testified in favour of Draco at his trial.
“That sounds great,” Harry murmured, moving forward to nuzzle his nose against Draco’s cheek. “What sort of work will you do?”
His partner whistled and scratched his head. "At the station. Their getaway car broke down and the bloke that offered them a ride drove them straight over to us."
Taking a long swig from his mug, he let the angry burn of the Firewhiskey trail down his throat before he placed it down and sighed. He had expected this sooner or later, but he had hoped it would be later.
"Oh, my. Why're you all out of bed?" she asked, but the kids took no heed of her as they rushed past her.
So, about this week, what's the plan? Do you want me to drop you off at the station or somewhere nearby? And when am I picking you up, Thursday or Friday?"
He shrugged. "You'd made these plans a while back, I'm assuming, and I know how important your friendship with Angelina is… besides, I can still take the kids out, though it won't really be the same without you."
"Well, Ron only managed to get five tickets to the carnival and both Arthur and Molly wanted to go, so Hermione decided it'd do everyone a lot of good if she tagged along with the kids and me."
Harry glanced at Draco then looked away, and Draco thought he almost looked… guilty. "I've been doing a lot of thinking," Harry began, to which Weasley scoffed and said, "Yeah, I'm well aware of all the brooding and moping around you've been doing." Harry tensed and clenched his fists but continued, nonetheless. "And I decided that I want to put the past behind me and move on. Or do you want me to continue being unhappy and
He entered the room and motioned for Buxley to leave, who did just that after handing Draco a cup of tea. Harry came over to place the book on his desk and tapped it with his finger. "You found this."
Sipping on his drink, he watched as Ginny fumbled around, looking lost for words. He wasn't really sure
Buxley took her hand and shook it once, a grin on his face. "I'll forgive you if you promise to never set foot in this office again."
There was some sort of commotion outside the room, and they heard the sound of wings as Demitri swooped down and landed before them, his appearance beaten and bloody.
The blond sat up a little straighter at that, and Harry continued. "Will it be alright if I were to come along, too?" When Malfoy's eyes widened in the slightest, Harry quickly said, "Just to see who ends up with the vase. I mean, I don't want just anybody to get it, you know?"
She placed the things in her arms down and turned to face him, pushing her short hair out of her face.
"I don't care about your work! I gave up trying to pry anything out of you a long time ago. I realised all you needed was my silent support, and I have been giving you as much of it as humanly possible, but there's a limit to how much I can—"
“Do we haf to do thish right now?” Draco said and moved his lips up and down so it looked like a fish face. “I’m shleepy.”
better off with Malfoy as his healer since the man had actually witnessed everything Harry had been through for most of those seven years, and Harry knew that Malfoy had suffered more than enough at the hands of Voldemort. If anyone could understand what Harry was going through, it would be Malfoy.
"Yes, Mother," Harry said with an eyeroll, but she only smiled into her cup as she sipped her tea, shooing him off with her other hand.
Draco ran a hand through his hair as he eyed the name on the piece of paper, the brief exchanges he had had with the dead Death Eater Walden Macnair coming to mind as fragmented memories. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he asked, "But how're the other people that disappeared connected to me?"
Once he felt solid ground beneath his feet, Harry coughed for a moment, out of habit, and stepped out, looking around to find the familiar face.
Harry paced up and down the rather large room, muttering under his breath. He'd initially thought the room was a lounge of some sort, but it turned out to be Malfoy's office. Not that it surprised him; after all, this was Draco Malfoy, who, apparently, just so happened to be the founder of Antares.
He could see the hooded forms of Death Eaters with every movement of the curtains, and he could smell the burning of rotten flesh with every painful gasp of breath. He could feel an incessant itch just below his skin, and he wanted to tear himself up before putting himself back together again.
"But one month after the investigation had begun, Erhard suddenly sent a second letter, asking the investigation to be called off, and I only assumed that he had found whatever he had been looking for. A day after that, the vase was gone, and in its place was the envelope with the blueprint, except it also contained a letter. Erhard must've realised that I knew that he was innocent, so he wrote to me and told me to come to London and find you. I didn't understand why, but he wrote that both my grandfather and father spoke very highly of you and that if there was one person who could protect me when he couldn't, it would be you."
Her eyes softened in the slightest, and she offered him a small smile. "You're right. I'd forgotten what it was like to have a friend I could rely on. It isn't easy being a woman of colour fighting to hold the same position as powerful white men, and that seems to precede my every action, but it still isn't an excuse for my lapse of judgement." She scrunched up her nose and frowned, as though annoyed at herself. "Thanks for letting me off easy, by the way," she added. "I reckon neither of our superiors is going to be too pleased with us."
The sun had gone down, so he had been asleep for a good portion of the afternoon, and Ginny's decorations and banner were no longer strewn across the floor. In fact, it seemed like there had been no sign of activity in the room for quite a while.
Audrey had been the first to reply; her letter had arrived a little after eleven o'clock, saying she would be busy that afternoon, but was free around lunchtime. Malfoy's letter had arrived just as he was leaving to meet Audrey, and it just said that he would be in his office between two and four o'clock and would leave the Floo to his office fireplace open for Harry. So, Harry had decided to meet with Audrey first, then head over to Antares. He wanted to finish up the rather prolonged deal with who his Mind Healer would be, so he could start off with his treatment—or whatever it was called—and get it over with before people started asking questions.
Harry groaned. "Well, I wasn't planning to. But…" he trailed off and shrugged, slumping against the armrest. "I didn't really wanna come home to an empty house."
No sooner had the thought cross his mind, so did the memory of him having a panic attack, for reasons he could no longer remember, while waiting for Malfoy to return, and upon finding a strong Calming Draught, had drunk a little too much of it and promptly passed out from his body becoming too relaxed. He felt a surge of mortification and guilt as he stepped out from behind the divider—only to find a scrumptious lunch waiting for him on the coffee table. His stomach gurgled with urgency, and he settled in the armchair, mouth watering at the delicious smell and sight that assaulted his senses.
"You're making this harder for me, you know," she said in a teasing voice, although her brown eyes seemed suspiciously moist.
heartless. "How about this," he said, leaning forward with a smile. "I could make you a bouquet of assorted flowers that also signify love and happiness." When his customer didn't look too convinced, he added, "Don't mind me saying this, but don't you think it would look even better if you went with anything
He shrugged, and her eyes sparkled as she leant forwards. "Did you not expect someone so attractive because of the work I do?"
"Hi." Harry laughed as she all but ran up to them and threw herself into Harry's arms. "I take it that it went well, then?"
Her argument was so reasonable, that anything Harry said would've come across as him being stubborn for the heck of it. But he had boarded that train already, and he was going to ride it to the last station. So, he said, "Maybe so, but right now, you're on British ground, and you have no jurisdiction here. Besides, his employer is my client, so I suggest you back off, Agent Patil, before things turn ugly."
take all the necessary precautions. Whoever stole the vase must've found out that I'd come to you for help and stole the blueprint in order to threaten me."
"Like they care! Plus, it'll be dangerous if these crazy fans manage to sneak in behind me. I'm just going to have to deal with it till the wizard in charge of security gets here."
Harry gritted his teeth and gave her a strained smile. "I can Apparate on my own, Miss McMahon," he repeated, using her surname just in case he was right about her dislike of him.
James jutted his chin out and promptly went, "Little Lou!" earning a smack on the head from the older boy.
Pig squawked angrily from around the letter and took off—but not before leaving a nicely sized pellet on Harry's coat that was hanging on the chair.
believe it—" he paused, like a teenager spilling the school's hottest gossip, "—they didn't even stop! They just kept going at it, and I was just standing there like—"
“Where is he? Where is he?” she asked urgently, and the boy waved a finger in the direction of the fire. “Get on your feet if you want to live,” she commanded, startling him awake with a weak Stinging Hex. “Head to Hogwarts! The wards will keep you safe.”
"For the last time," Harry replied, trying not to snap, "your uncle's busy right now, so he can't babysit all three of you."
"Clothes were still in her suitcase, but we found a jewellery box in the safe." The blond pointed to the open safe.
Potter scratched his ear, looking uncomfortable. “Truth be told, I guess I just wanted a fresh start.”
He ran his free hand down his face and controlled his urge to sigh. "I thought you said you're coming back this weekend."
"I'm sorry," the volunteer beside him said, checking her list. "We don't seem to have anybody by that name at this camp. Do you know who was looking for them?"
Hermione laughed, and, as Harry pulled the car out the gate, said, "Kids, say thanks to your Uncle Ron for lending us his car."
Before he could stop his son, Albus had already jumped off the counter and was racing up the stairs.
"I also happen to have the advantage of being half your age," Harry retorted, straightening his back to give the illusion of being intimidating.
Harry looked at her sceptically. He wasn't sure what she meant since all he could see was a corridor before him and two on either side. She must have noticed his conflicted expression because she seemed like she was thoroughly enjoying herself.
"You know what I want, Harry," Weasley said, his voice suddenly quiet, like the silence following an explosion. He glanced at Draco and back at Harry. "And you being unhappy is the last thing on the list."
She tilted her head and said, "My sister isn't too pleased about having to play the role of my secretary and take down messages for me."
"Well, better Rogers than some other incompetent bloke, I s'pose." Buxley finally muttered. He then turned to stare at the ceiling, pulled the covers up to his chin, and said, "Thanks for visiting, boss."
Draco hugged her then, overcome by emotion. He hated that he was such a disappointment of a son. He hated that he brought his parents nothing but pain. He hated what an undeserving bastard he was that he lapped up their love without a trace of guilt or repentance.
He almost felt foolish for losing sleep over the man before him. If he had been having nightmares because of this man, who barely seemed to be clinging onto life and sanity, then he couldn't imagine what sort of torture the former Death Eater had to face within the walls of the formidable prison. Harry thanked the heavens that Dementors no longer guarded the penitentiary. This level of cruelty, even for a murderer, was
Hermione were in on it. He massaged his temples, cursing his sleeplessness and his nightmares for turning him into a paranoid wreck.
He gasped as he felt cool fingers wrap around his wrist and shake it, bringing him back to his senses. He stared at Camilla through the haze fogging his vision, taking in the worried expression on her face.
"Is it true?" Draco all but gasped, collapsing in the chair opposite Harry's. "Is Macnair really dead?"
Scorpius nodded, looking solemn. "I know I went too far today. Sometimes I say things without thinking and am sorry. It won't happen again."
"That makes the two of us," she replied in the exact same tone of voice as she slammed the door shut and crossed her arms. "So when exactly were you going to tell me about Lestrange?"
He was jolted awake by sharp raps on his door. Quickly rubbing a hand down his face and smacking his lips, he cleared his throat and straightened his shirt.
Draco woke up feeling a sense of immense emptiness. It was similar to the feeling he got when he had passed the point of being hungry and simply felt hollow inside. But this… this was more profound. It was almost as though his emotions had run dry and he could no longer feel anything anymore.
As Draco finished up the last of his mash, he glanced up to see that Hermione still had a little bit of soup left, and wondered if she was eating slowly for his sake. It reminded him of the time he had run into Harry—the first time in a long while—two years or so after the war.
"Yeah, I'm really glad that she was able to get the same week off as you. I'm so much more relaxed now that I know she'll be with you," Ginny said as she turned and waved at Hermione.
She looked up and smiled at him, but before she could tell him whatever she was supposed to, he asked, "Is that a cross-tech phone?"
Leaving Draco to be impressed by his presence of mind, Harry went about casting Bubble-Head Charms over all of the Aurors, and Draco joined him. Once the other witches and wizards regained consciousness while coughing and spluttering, Harry went over to the far wall and inspected it, possibly for any more trigger jinxes.
Potter's smile was a little more genuine this time. He stared at Draco for long enough to make the latter feel uncomfortable, and as Draco was wondering if running away just then would make him even more terrible a person than he already was, Potter held out his hand.
that she had asked for my help—if that threatening message meant for my eyes only was any indication."
She took a deep breath and smiled expectantly at him as she waited for everything to sink in. Harry sifted through the information, recollecting older knowledge regarding an organisation that sounded much like this one, and realised it might be the same. Wondering how many years it was since Neville started consulting them, he asked, "How long have you worked for Antares?"
"I take it back," he said, his eyes shimmering like raw, uncut emeralds. Draco frowned, confused, but Harry didn't give him a chance to speak as he leant closer to whisper, "The kiss. I'm not sorry about it." He then pecked Draco on the mouth before moving away with a wave. "Thanks for the coat!"
"No; the Floo Network has improved by leaps and bounds over the years. A slight mispronunciation couldn't have caused this."
And he was currently considering giving up as he sat in the middle of his room, surrounded by leaflets, brochures, magazines, newspapers and whatnot. He leant his head back and closed his eyes, inhaling deeply as the familiar sense of anxiety began to bubble in the pit of his stomach.
"So, Mr Potter," Malfoy said, drawing Harry out of his confused thoughts and, instead, leaving him wondering how long it had been since Malfoy had addressed him directly. Not just that, being addressed by him as
"You probably don't remember," she said as she waved her wand, and the procession of books that had followed her into the room slammed down on the desk. Harry sat back and coughed, eyeing the worn spines apprehensively. "But back when we were in Hogwarts," Hermione continued, patting the topmost book, "I was reading the original version of
"What in heaven's name is all this stuff?" Hermione exclaimed, helping to extricate Ron from under the bags.
"No, I did not," the blond said, his lips curling in a smug smirk at the way Harry followed every small movement. "But my suspicions have been confirmed." He rolled over to prop his chin in his hands, his elbows causing Harry's side of the mattress to dip. "You
The man approached them, emerald eyes glittering with mirth as he came to stand before Draco in a perfectly-tailored suit and miraculously neat hair, his spectacles reflecting the fluorescent lamp’s light and nearly blinding Draco. He held his arm out, and Draco stared at it before mechanically reaching up and shaking it.
She began to sob, and Harry grimaces, trying to shut the door as quietly as possible, when he heard Malfoy say, "Astoria, please. You know that's not true. I
Surprised, he pulled her against him and rocked back and forth, unsure of what exactly had caused his daughter to say such a thing. The kids absolutely adored their grandparents and loved their time at the Burrow—mostly because Arthur and Molly spoiled them rotten. Arthur bought them toys every chance he got, and Molly made them all their favourite food, and it was heaven on earth for all the grandchildren.
"What's Angie saying now?" he asked, trying to make his voice sound as nonchalant as possible, but there was a definite edge to it.
They sat in silence for a while, watching Lily feed her doll the pudding while making a mess around her, and Molly finally spoke up.
Behind the waiting area was a set of stairs that led to the upper floors, and directly opposite the stairs was a spacious cubicle that had 'Pharmacy' written above it in the same green lettering. Inside were rows of shelves and cabinets that held all sorts of bottles and containers full of Muggle medication. There were several people huddled before it, holding out prescriptions, while three frazzled-looking pharmacists bustled about, pulling various bottles and tablet strips off the shelves.
Just before he Floo-d to Antares, Harry made a quick call to Ginny just to placate his guilty conscience. He was dying to talk to her about his nightmares, but he kept putting it off with one excuse after the other, being the coward that he was.
to him about the tickets? It was such a stupid thing to do and seemed rather pointless. Had she not wanted him to feel guilty that Hermione was giving up on quality time with her family in order to replace Ginny?
Malfoy nodded. "This dose was stronger than the usual one because I noticed the last time around that the milder dosage wasn't really working as well as it was supposed to. Now that the initial, instantaneous effects of the potion are starting to wear off, you don't feel any different from before. But a dose as strong as this, if administered on someone who doesn't drink the draught as often, would have a more powerful effect on them—so much so that they would feel sluggish and lethargic rather than just calm." He shifted forwards again. "Tell me, do you feel alert? Like you could focus on several hours worth of paperwork?"
Walking a little away from the front of the store, he pressed a finger to his other ear and tried to make out what Ginny was saying.
Ginny nodded. "She came into our room, last night, before you got home, in tears. It took me a long time to put her to sleep. She hasn't been talking much all day." Ginny shook her head and swallowed. "I wouldn't have gone if I knew…"
"Yes, yes, and yes. I'll only be a few hours away, Harry, I won't even need half these things," Ginny said, wrapping her hands around his neck and kissing him.
"This is how you got my attention the first time," he said, as though, once again, reading Harry's mind. "And, yes, I
"Good. Well, I shall be getting timely reports from Robards regarding the situation, and I hope you remember—" He watched Harry in a way that seemed oddly reminiscent of Dumbledore, "—although you're leading the security detail, Robards is still in charge of this operation."
Our eyes meet. He seems just as surprised to see me as I am him. His green eyes widen in the slightest, and the corners of his lips pull upwards in an awkward smile.
He nodded finally and relaxed back in his seat. "Yeah. You still should've at least warned me before showing up here."
She cast Draco a sideways glance before grabbing her boyfriend and dragging him off with a, "Stop being a nuisance, Ron. I've lost too much valuable study time chasing after you."
leave. Your father is doing all that he can to keep the ones that seek your life from you." He turned his attention to Harry. "Can you protect him?"
His deputy only swallowed and nodded. "Fine. But, if I find something else that proves you wrong, then I'm going to bring that to you first."
"Not at all. I was actually on my way home, so you contacted me at the right time. And please, call me Harry."
"Harry," the man mused, the corners of his lips upturning in an amused smirk as he stepped closer. "And where are you from, Harry?"
needed a break, and he planned to make use of the upcoming week for just that, but somehow he had a feeling his wife had other plans.
Draco closed his eyes and inhaled a deep, steadying breath. He opened his eyes to see Harry's mouth move to form the words, "You OK?"
"Hermione wouldn't be too pleased to know that the Malfoys still enslave House-elves," Harry commented after a moment, for the simple reason that he hoped that annoying the man may get him to be more Malfoy-like. He realised that the reason for his agitation may be because the person sitting before him looked like Malfoy but was nothing at all like the man he once knew, and the lack of familiarity in their interactions was unnerving.
He had decided to take the week off from work when the kids got back from their weekend at the Burrow, and Ginny had promised to do the same as well, but he could sense that she wasn't wholly happy about it. In fact, she seemed to get grumpier by the hour, constantly complaining about something or the other and cleaning the house over and over again.
She looked at the file and said, "Well, let's just say, if I involve myself in this any further, I'll be putting my job on the line."
There was silence, and Harry waited with bated breath. Someone sighed, and he heard Malfoy say, "The only reason I told you was because you personally chose to be his Healer, and I don't want there to be any complications."
"Harry!" came the excited response from the other end, and he found himself feeling instantly relieved after hearing his wife's voice.
"The boys found it in the garden; I'm not sure what it is, yet," Harry said quickly, making to grab the pouch from her hand.
"No, I think I got bitten by something at the beach," he deadpanned. "It's been bothering me for a while now but I assumed it was sunburn. I should probably go see a Healer first thing in the morning."
Harry shook it once, the smile still on his face. "I hope I'm not bothering you with my consecutive visits."
Harry shrugged, and she made an agitated noise and began to pace across her office. "Harry, really, you need to stop obsessing over these things."
Hermione hummed. "You haven't actually relaxed at all today, have you? Molly told me you've been up and about, taking care of the kids and meeting Audrey about pre-schools and stuff. Speaking of, I kept meaning to ask you but kept forgetting—why not just put them in the same one Rosie and Hugh go to?"
He was amused that she'd asked him that, considering she'd already asked if it was the Head Auror's office before entering, even though there was a board on the outside of his door stating as much.
Just then the bell tinkled, and they hopped off the counter, both donning their trademark business smiles. "Saved by the bell," Harry muttered out of the corner of his mouth as he bent over the counter to place the Yum-Yums under it and picked up the paper bag. "Our plan for tonight's still on, yeah?"
"Well," Harry struggled for a moment as he tried to explain himself, "I suppose I could give you an example. Like, when I came here for the second time, very early in the morning, it was right after a nightmare. I remember it because I got a similar one when I passed out in your office a couple hours later."
The brunette pondered over it for a long moment, eyeing the racks of flowers lining the wall beside her and then the photographs behind him. Finally, she nodded. "Alright. That makes sense. It's not like my girlfriend loves roses or anything anyway." She smiled up at him. "Plus, I'm sure you'll do a splendid job."
"Yes. Acupressure therapy is one of the most foolproof ways to de-stress one's body, I've come to find. A good massage session will allow you to relax completely. Tell me, are you feeling sleepy right now?"
Macnair used the Auror's poor judgement to his advantage as he shoved past Harry and the other Auror in an attempt to escape but was Stunned before he reached the door.
Harry nodded. "Alright. You take over the cases I've been overseeing." He handed back the file. "Where are the Malfoys now?"
Biting back a sigh, Harry picked him up and sat him down on the kitchen counter. Looking over his shoulder to make sure Lily hadn't tripped and fallen on her way to her grandparents, he turned back to his son.
"I won't. Bye, Gin," he said hurriedly as he moved towards the sofas. Buxley was trying to calm her down, but it wasn't working.
He sighed and shook his head in exasperation, but his eyes shone with affection. And for the first time since he'd run into Malfoy about an hour ago, Harry came to realise the extent to which Malfoy had grown up from being the snotty git who used to harass the wits out of him during their time at Hogwarts to the calm, collected Mind Healer that he seemed to be.
*What Harry means by the pre-school in Diagon's not as close for Ginny and him is that they live in Godric's Hollow (according to me, anyway), so going back and forth between the two places is a pain. Especially since there's three kids, so Side-along Apparition isn't always a very viable option. Just wanted to clarify that in case you guys are wondering how that's possible since the Ministry's in London (Harry can't keep leaving his job to check on the kids like Ron usually can). That's all.
Harry returned to the call and belatedly realised that he might not have time for lunch after all. "All right. I'm on my way. Fill me in."
He hurried to where the blond was, caught in mid-transformation, the effects of the experimental serum kicking in a bit too late.
"Always eats well, this one," the matron said with a smile, patting Hermione on the back. "You should tell your friend here to eat more. Says he doesn't have an appetite."
Harry nodded. "For as long as I can remember. It sort of became a bad habit I couldn't get rid of, after a point of time, and I had to consciously stop resorting to it every time I had trouble sleeping."
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. "Yeah, no, I haven't. Last time we spoke she sounded really busy, so…"
She turned to him with a smile and asked him how she may be of assistance. He pointed at the address and asked her if he was at the right place. She glanced at the parchment and nodded slowly.
"You seem to be starting your day on an awfully strong note," Harry commented as Neville took several gulps before putting down his drink with a grimace.
Harry scoffed. "Why don't you take a crack at her while I go make sure she hasn't already destroyed evidence or something?"
Buxley nodded, not looking convinced. Harry continued, "I didn't put this down in the report because it didn't seem important—but when she first came to me, Lisa mentioned that her late grandfather had insisted that I'm the only one who could help her." He frowned thoughtfully. "I dismissed it as something unimportant, but now that I think about it, if her grandfather was murdered right after her seventeenth birthday, but still knew to tell her to come to me…" He looked up at his deputy. "Buxley, when exactly did she say the vase was stolen from her?"
"Wow, who would've thought I'd have Harry Potter as my own personal bodyguard. Wait 'til my father hears about this," Draco said sarcastically, to which Harry rolled his eyes.
His eyebrows shot up at the mention of the previous Head Auror. "Robards? What the hell does Robards have to do with anything?"
James whipped around so fast he nearly tripped over his own two feet. He trudged towards Harry looking more than relieved, as though someone had been forcing him to play with his brother and uncle. "Dad," he sniffled, pressing a large wad of napkins to his nose. "I do'd feel do good."
Buxley scoffed. "Says the man who won't sit behind his desk for more than a couple hours at a time."
The girl nodded and walked away, but not before throwing another suspicious glance in Harry's direction.
"A walk." Malfoy held two fingers upside down and made a back-and-forth motion to imitate walking. It was such a silly gesture, and Harry wondered if Malfoy was trying to distract him from his emotional turmoil.
The kids would be home in less than a day, and his nightmares weren't going anywhere, so the happier Ginny was, the better. It would be simpler to keep his insomnia a secret from her when she was busy doing whatever she wanted to do than when he could constantly feel her intent gaze follow him around all day long.
"So, if by some chance, someone else were to use my signature, the parchment would automatically record their magical imprint, recognise that it isn't the same as mine, and you'd be able to handle the situation immediately?"
Why had she hidden the fact that she wasn't going to go from him? Alright, sure, he had gotten upset when she had told him, but he had known that she didn't want to go anyway—and that's what didn't make sense to him.
“Oh, heavens,” she whispered, getting down on her knees beside the crumpled body on the ground. The moment she saw the mess of dark hair, her heart jolted in relief. “Gregory!” she hissed, shaking the boy’s hefty shoulder to wake him. “Gregory, wake up!”
"Looks like you can do it too," he says, and there's a depth to his voice that I'd never noticed previously—something profound yet comforting.
He had been rather upset by the whole ordeal and had gone back to the school to apologise for the trouble caused, but in the process, had found out that his kids
Flicking his wand to shut the door and lock it, he muttered a few protective charms for good measure. He looked back towards the spot on the floor and saw the madman's face, now more prominent than ever, the sound of the waves filling his ears. He touched his throat, almost feeling a tingling sensation where the skeletal fingers had choked him, and swallowed thickly.
A week of commuting by bus has taught me two things: one, that the bus I got on accidentally on my first day actually takes the quickest route, and two, that the bespectacled man that ruined my brand new shoes is a baker a few blocks over from my shop.
Harry stepped back, still holding onto her, and cleared his throat, feeling awkward all of a sudden. "Yeah, I know. And I feel the same way, but I just… I just need some space."
"Hello, I'm Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Chosen One, the Man-Who-Is-Now-Losing-His-Mind," he said in a mocking tone of voice. Gritting his teeth, he slapped his forehead and clenched his fist.
The cool breeze caressed his cheek and rustled through his hair, and he pulled the covers higher over him, shivering from the cold. Why hadn't he shut the window?
"Yo-You're really weird, you know that?" Draco exclaimed, brushing his hair out of his eyes. "Who just places their cheek in someone's hand?"
"Alright, you lot, off we go!" Harry said with a grin, the kids' infectious excitement temporarily causing him to forget his concerns.
She held out three large shells. James immediately grabbed a red, jagged, spiralled one and went, "This one's mine!"
He sighed in frustration and shrugged. "I probably didn't want to burn them or something so I must've buried it with the intention of finding them some day when I was ready." He couldn't be held responsible for the actions of his stupid past self—or so he would have liked to believe.
As we pull up at the sole bus stop in the middle of nowhere, my breath catches in my throat. A couple climbs on board, followed by a bespectacled man I knew a little too well. With his tousled, raven hair and eyes greener than the fields around us, he brings with him the usual wicker basket and the pungent aroma of something sweet.
Harry blinked, confused by the sudden compliment thrown at him, and, feeling slightly embarrassed, nodded his thanks.
Harry didn't know how to respond to that bit of personal information, surprised not only because the blond had decided to share such private details with him but also because there was no malice in his tone. He sounded genuinely relieved.
"This isn't a punishment, Buxley," Harry said. "I'm doing this for your sake. Besides, sooner or later the DMLE's gonna butt in and tell you to either step back or step down, anyway. This is the second time in a few months that you've been incapacitated."
"Sorry that I got you dragged into this," Neville leant towards him to whisper, and Harry shot him a look.
"I have work to do," he retorted, even though his brain was telling him that her argument was valid and that he was being the unreasonable one.
Harry stared at her, thoroughly confused by this sudden change in her demeanour, and he found himself wondering if she had made herself seem happy just to make him feel better. But when he looked into her earnest eyes, he could only see a person who had suffered great pain and loss, just like him, and had learnt to bear it with much more elegance and grace than he ever could.
Before I can argue further, the bus pulls up at a bus stop next to a quaint bakery, and Harry rises from his seat.
This was not what he had expected. He had expected to be able to gain some peace of mind, after seeing the relief and life in Lestrange's eyes. He had even been deluded into thinking that the former Death Eater would have been grateful for his pardon, but of all the many scenarios Harry had concocted in his head ever since learning about Lestrange's release, this was most definitely not one of them.
he said, holding the glass of water out to Draco, who took it shakily and gulped it down. He sighed, his eyes glassy, and Harry decided that the blond had done more than enough.
In all honesty, it didn't seem like Neville was actually going to pick a fight with Lestrange, considering how resolute and resigned he had seemed about it all. Robards had managed to get a confirmation from the top brass regarding Harry's leading the security detail during the course of the release and transfer. Harry still had a feeling they had done it rather begrudgingly, and that left a bad taste in his mouth.
Harry turns around with a wide smile, and I belatedly note that my heart skips a beat. "Hi," he says, cheerful as always.
Harry smiled as they walked back to the fireplace. Vanessa sprang to her feet immediately, and Harry nodded to her. "Thanks for the tour. I'll be in touch."
Harry nodded, motioning for the group behind him to swap places with the group around Lestrange. They paused for only a minute, just so the two groups could switch positions, but those sixty seconds happened as though in slow motion, allowing him to recollect everything that occurred as though he had paused time.
"Well, the brother mustn't have been too happy about it," Neville mumbled, reaching for the Firewhiskey.
Malfoy nodded, and Harry listened to the scratching sound of the quill against the parchment. After a long moment, Malfoy spoke up.
lot snooping around, saying they'd discovered the whereabouts of a certain international criminal," she replied smoothly, half a smile on her face and hands in the pockets of her pin-striped pantsuit.
I mean, my grandfather, bought that vase," she said, "he was paranoid that something would happen to it. I don't know why he was so obsessed with it, but he was. Even at home, it was heavily guarded by innumerous spells and the like. But right after my parents' deaths two years ago, his paranoia became so extreme that it started to have physical effects on his health. He was almost always ill, and without either of my parents or Erhard to look after the family matters, I had to step up and take things into my own hands."
and Ron appeared from out of the restaurant's back alley, looking frazzled. He looked around for a moment before his eyes landed on Harry, and he frowned, striding over with a menacing expression on his face.
Once Harry had owled the office that he'd be back after lunch, he proceeded to call Ginny to tell her about Silver Sprigs. They hadn't had that particular conversation, yet, and as he listened to the ringtone, he started to bounce his knee, his frustration building up when the call automatically got disconnected because she hadn't answered it. He wondered what she was doing because he was sure it was her lunch break and she always answered his calls then. Staring at the screen, he wondered if he should just call her later when the phone buzzed.
She huffed, and he rolled his eyes. For all either of them cared, Hermione's main intention in joining the DMLE was so she could tell people off for not following the rules.
"Good to know!" he said with a laugh as he practically skipped into the Floo. "See you on the other side, Dad!"
"My brothers, who were eight and twelve, then, raised me, with help from the townsfolk, until I was old enough to go to Hogwarts. The moment they were of age, my brothers went and joined the Aurors and took on the most difficult and dangerous missions there were, offering to help the Order when the Dark Lord rose again."
not the boy, so the faster he left, the better the chances that he could keep the child from getting involved. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a few crumpled notes of Muggle money and held them out to the boy.
Harry placed his cup down and held his hands up. "I know, and I apologise if I've offended you, but I really just thought it would help…" he trailed off, motioning between them again.
"Look, Liz," he said, glancing at his watch. As much as he had enjoyed the distraction, he didn't have the time for it. "I'm not entirely sure what you want me to do, but I'll send you to someone who can help—"
"I know that," Harry said, sounding a little more defensive than he had intended, and Kingsley nodded.
He shook his head, finding it hard to breathe, finding himself gasping for breath, his vision blurring, his head spinning, his heart racing, his ears ringing. A long-forgotten thought rose up from the depths of his consciousness as he struggled against it.
Potter patted the grass beside him, and Draco hesitated before sitting down. He glanced sideways at the other man, wary, wondering if he would be required to comfort him if he broke down crying or something.
Reaching up, he grabbed a hold of the table lamp and smashed it against the ground. Staring at the jagged edge, he placed his palm face up against the ground, and raised his other hand.
Before Draco could retort, Hermione stood up with a, "God, you two," and stormed over to the bathroom, where Ginny could be heard retching.
"Mr Potter," Malfoy said in a startled tone of voice before Harry could escape from the horrible situation he had gotten himself to. "Astoria," he continued, placing a hand on his wife's back and motioning to Harry with the other one. "I'm sure you know Harry Potter."
He thought he'd caught another glimpse of the cloaked form, but before he could do anything, fingers closed around his wrist, and he was forced to stop.
"No, Harry, that's not my point. My point is that if I were to have told you about this release, you wouldn't have taken that vacation, and trust me when I say
It took them a while to bundle the boys into the Floo with Ginny, and Harry waited till the smoke settled to step in, making sure he didn't knock Lily's head against the mantle. He looked around the living room one last time, and kissed his daughter's hair, before throwing down the Floo powder.
His plan had been to just tell her that, then gauge her reaction, and from the way she perked up and her eyes brightened, his suspicions were confirmed. He smiled and said, "So I want you to help me find him."
"You'd better." Harry picked up the file Hermione had handed him. He flipped through it, scanning the floor plans of Azkaban, the structure of the remodelled boat—whose interiors had been hollowed out and reinforced with enchanted metal—being used to transport them to and from the island the prison was on, the notes he had made regarding the unit's shifts, and other things she'd printed out.
"You, the one and only Draco Malfoy, taking the bus into town like a commoner?" She flaps her wrist and rolls her eyes with a pompous laugh. "What has the world come to?"
All in all, he was thoroughly convinced that he had stepped into a Muggle hospital and had probably gotten lost once again. He pulled out the letter from his coat pocket, which contained the address of the place he was supposed to meet Camilla at, and moved towards the reception desk. He waited for the receptionist to finish speaking to the mother and son who had entered before him and placed the letter on the desk.
“I’m not sure if you follow the news—or the news related to me, anyway—but they still won’t let me outlive this whole Chosen One nonsense and I’m frankly sick of it.”
"The vase," Buxley muttered, his dislike for it clear on his face. "I followed every trail that was connected to it in every way possible, just like you asked, and the only things I've managed to find so far are that the vase has a name—something related to purity—and
"Can I come pick it up this evening?" he asks as he pens down his information. "I have a big date with my girlfriend tonight." He's practically radiating happiness, and it makes me want to gag. "I'm going to propose."
Harry nodded to himself and made his way back to the Auror Office, feeling his stomach knot. He tried to wave it off as just the nerves of waiting for Hermione's interview to end, but he knew better than to kid himself.
She was wearing expensive-looking clothing, and her hair was done up like she was going to a fancy dinner. Her jewellery and purse didn't seem any less expensive, and from the way she held herself, he reckoned she was the daughter or granddaughter of some noble. Something about her surname rang a bell, but he wasn't sure where he'd come across it before.
Kingsley nodded some more, and Harry shifted, feeling like Kingsley was there for more than he was letting on. Deciding to breach the topic skilfully, he walked to the coffee machine Hermione had got him when he'd first moved into his office. It truly had saved him more than once.
Harry was about to retort that his naming skills were at least better than Malfoy's, but the smile the blond shot him seemed genuine enough that he decided to let it go.
His short, slicked-back hair gleamed like the purest of metals, his moon-bright skin glowing like fine diamond dust and his eyes shimmering like liquid silver. He wore some sort of flowing translucent tunic whose colours shifted with the light filtering down through the decorative foliage adorning the glass ceiling of the room they were in.
"It's this weekend." Neville seemed to struggle for a bit, as though he couldn't say whatever he wanted to. "His release."
Harry hesitated for a moment before he nodded. He shut his eyes as Malfoy reached up and carefully took off his glasses. He gripped the armrests tight, his heart beginning to race as Malfoy pressed his fingertips against Harry's temples. His fingertips were cool and soothing against Harry's flushed skin, but he still stiffened at the touch.
Ginny looked up at him then, and he instantly recognised the guilt and fear in her eyes. She thought she was doing something terrible. Knowing that itself placated him far more than anything she could have told him, would have. He could take a guess as to what this grand plan of Angelina's was, but he wanted to hear it from Ginny, so he relaxed his features into a reassuring smile and nodded.
Harry wasn't entirely sure if it looked so disproportionate due to the artist's lack of skill or if that was how it was meant to be. Either way, the person who made the vase seemed to have had a weird sense of what a vase should look like. He looked up from the parchment and into shining hazel eyes.
"Yeah, the same," he said, shifting forwards in his seat. "I'm sure you've heard the rumours of Rodolphus Lestrange begging for the Kiss just a few months after his imprisonment, right? Said he couldn't bear any more nightmares of his wife being tortured. Said he was done."
He had just turned around with a sigh to get to work when the shopkeeper's bell tinkled again. "Hi, welco—" he began, looking over his shoulder with a ready smile, but broke off when he saw who it was. "Ugh, get out, I'm busy."
their target," Draco whispered brokenly, the misery and guilt that had taken years of therapy to get over rising up beneath the surface.
She frowned as his words slowly sunk in, and then bolted out of the chair, nearly falling over in the process.
"Thank you for leading the investigation," he said, his voice soft. "I assume being the Head Auror doesn't give you all that much free time to personally handle simple kidnapping cases."
"Here," Harry said from behind him, making him jump. Draco placed his palm on the side of his neck, still feeling Harry's hot breath lingering, and frowned.
"I know, I know," Harry said, sounding like he had heard that enough times before. "But I just can't fall asleep while I'm here anyway, so one night, I decided to go to the office and get some work done, and I fell asleep on the sofa so peacefully that it turned into a habit."
Panicking, and still disoriented from his nightmare, he stumbled out of the armchair, calling for his wife.
Harry wasn't sure why Malfoy was making such a big deal about whether or not he wanted Camilla to continue being his Mind Healer, but he reckoned it had something to do with client-Healer confidentiality and whatnot.
Harry reached into his breast pocket and pulled out two small keys. One was bronze and the other was silver. He held them out to the goblin. "Here you go."
"There's something else, isn't there?" When Harry didn't reply, Draco added, "You can swear me to secrecy, if you'd like."
"Take him away," Harry said, and the others escorted him out, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the room.
Breathing deeply, he took several minutes to think about what he would say and do, about the different scenarios that could transpire, and if interfering really was the best decision.
"Got them right here." Harry held up a stack of paperwork. "How's your new post treating you, Rogers?"
Harry sniffed as he put the picture down and picked up the next one. This one was of him with his arms around George and Percy's shoulders—and they looked devastated. Percy was at least attempting to smile, although he looked extremely uncomfortable, but George was just staring off to the side, like he didn't even realise someone was taking a picture of him.
Harry mumbled his thanks as he sat on the chair closer to the end of the bed, while she took the other one. She reached over to hold her husband's hand, her eyes looking suspiciously moist, and Harry cleared his throat, feeling awkward.
“Hah!” Draco said, shaking his head. “If you know anything about my situation, you’ll know I don’t have the luxury to refuse.”
been meaning to quit working at my old pre-school since it was rather far off, and very hectic. This one's much more convenient to commute to, and there aren't all that many children, so it's easier. But, never mind all that, tell me more about you. How're the kids doing?" She leant forward, her warm, kind brown eyes shining.
"How've you been doing, Harry?" Molly asked as she came to sit beside him, wiping her hands on her apron.
"My intentions were more selfish. The last thing I need is for your wife to send me another Howler about how I'm overworking you."
He stumbled as he felt solid ground beneath his feet and used the wall to support himself. He was sweating now, and his breath was coming out in gasps. Quickly looking around, he realised he'd landed in the middle of the adjacent corridors of Antares, just beyond the Anti-Muggle spells. Thanking his lucky stars, he staggered down the left corridor. If he was going to hyperventilate and pass out, he didn't want to do it somewhere where people could see him.
