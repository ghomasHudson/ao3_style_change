They ended up back at Kettle Bottom, scrunched up in a corner by the stairs, their legs twined round the flimsy stools, their torsos bent over the little table. Blodwyn Bludd was still playing; a low murmur scratching on floors, crawling on walls.
'Not when there's no reason to,' Potter said. He'd backed up against the wall for balance, and it made something inside Draco itch - for Potter could very well have used
‘Oy- mind you, mate,’ Dean Thomas exclaimed as they clashed against each other on a tight corner. ‘You’re alright, sorry about that.’
'You're all red,' Harry chuckled, staring at Draco's lips. He brought a finger to his own, ghosting over the smeared lipstick. 'I think I fucked up your work.'
He swallowed. Perhaps Hermione had indeed told him. Perhaps he’d been playing oblivious all this time, taking pity on him, and now he’d broach the subject. Let him down gently. Laugh.
It was an improvement, sitting next to Potter. Surreal, when he thought back to all the times he’d loitered in the streets as he spied the Golden Group. Now, he had a space among it, and though he didn’t particularly care for many of the members - Ron and the way his voice went shrill from the alcohol, Alicia who insinuated into every conversation at least one Quidditch metaphor - it was worth it, because they were Harry’s friends, and he was there with them, listening absently and smiling politely like he almost
'You know, you really do lose your charm when you drink,' he said dryly, eyeing her with one arched brow; but Pansy simply smiled, the dark shimmer on her face glowing emerald green, and glanced towards the corner of the pub again.
Harry sent him a wry look. Something in Draco’s demeanour must have concerned him, because he asked:
‘That’s the bloody stupidest question you’ve ever asked,’ he breathed out, pulling him into another kiss. Slower than before, no less firm. Harry giggled against his lips, trying to suppress the sound, and enlaced his neck. He felt euphoric, having Harry in his arms like this, gentle in the beginnings of heat, intimate and hushed and without the urgent worry of being interrupted - this, he thought, was how it would feel if they were in a real relationship.
'I've never seen you like this,' Harry remarked. He didn't seem particularly shy about the situation: his legs were still slightly parted, showing a flash of a dusting of fur around a pink hole, just enough to drive Draco crazy with the possibility that he might get to be inside it that night.
And there was laughter around the table, Draco couldn’t quite get if it was agreeing or doubtful, and Ron made some sort of quip that had Harry shaking with an unwitting laugh, and the game moved on for Alicia to pick her flavour.
It was when Slughorn's speech had trailed off, and they'd begun their assignments, which had been left to ferment since last night, under the professor's lost, scattered words, that Ron sauntered up to him, incredible dark marks under his eyes, skin disturbingly pasty. Terribly hungover, in fact, and Draco couldn't find the smallest shred of sympathy for him.
‘Well? Go on, mate, bleachers, or you’ll get in the way,’ said Harper, ushering him away with a dismissive hand.
In response, Harry’s eyes lifted in the sharpest edge; he fought against Draco’s hold, but not to withdraw - he inched himself even closer, until Draco’s cock was entering the narrow, hot channel of his throat. He did gag then, and Draco let him go, but he didn’t stray too far. Through a bunch of laboured pants he kept licking along Draco’s cock, sucking lightly at the head like he couldn’t bear not to press his lips against it. At the sight, Draco couldn’t help but take himself in hand, moaning as he did it. He was close to the edge again - he reckoned he wasn’t meant to last when he was with Harry. And how was that a thought he got to have now, not fantasy but fact? How was it that he got to come not from Harry’s picture in his mind but from his mouth and fingers and precious little sounds? Draco knew the universe’s ways: it worked in a balanced succession of gifts and tests. He figured that, after this, a hellmouth should open just under his feet.
‘You look good in my jacket,’ he said, staring softly at the way the collar grazed Harry’s flushed neck.
'I-' Harry's smile was a bit crooked, a bit unsure as he rolled to his stomach. He looked at Draco over his shoulder. 'I don't think I've mentioned that I'm bloody nervous.'
… He'd decided to see it for himself and, well, once he caught sight of Potter's little group slouched in some seedy booth, old habits had kicked in. He'd loitered about until they went home, and he would have likely noticed if Potter and Finnigan
Idly, he wondered if Leanne was somewhere in the stands to support Potter. He'd nearly forgotten about her.
This time Harry laughed without sourness. ‘You arse. Just tell me what the fucking potion needs next. You’re a wretched teacher.’
‘You tasting yourself on me, Malfoy?’ Harry murmured, eyes twinkling, an echo of their first night in the bathroom of the Three Broomsticks. It made Draco’s heart clench to think that Harry might remember it as vividly as he did.
Or sometimes, most obnoxiously, he'd sit in front of him in class, shifting in his seat, dipping his head  to write something down - which really was just to spite Draco, could only be, because Potter used glasses but he surely wasn't that blind -, or leaning to whisper something into Weasley's ear and then sniggering against the muffle of his hand.
that you like it. Fuck, d'you like it too, when I said I'd fuck you in an alcove? Right where anyone could walk by and see?'
like it hadn't been his nightly fantasy during 4th year, when the Yule Ball was approaching and Draco could barely function with how jealous he was of that Chang girl and later, surprisingly enough, of Parvati, because Potter truly considered everyone but him, he went to stand beside him on the steps and held out his arm, 'Come along, then.'
Draco huffed. He didn’t quite mind it, actually. He saw the appeal of nights out, sure. The alcohol, the frenzy, the spontaneity of it all: enticing, addictive, and it had gotten him Harry. But he’d crawled into the quiet of his bed while the moon was still high and he’d liked that too. Preferred it, he thought. He’d have liked it even more if Harry had been laying with him.
Their pace was slow as they made their way to the Three Broomsticks. Draco put one arm around Harry's shoulders, and they stared lazily at the dark sky.
thought of Harry perched on that sink, legs spread so nicely to fit Draco between them, thighs trembling against Draco’s hips. He trailed a hand to Harry’s lower back, just an inch too low for innocent - two inches, maybe three, because he’d drunk too much, and control was already fickle in sobriety - and used it to start coaxing Harry through the crowd and towards the narrow stairs.
There was a beat of silence - in which Draco had to pin Harry’s hand to the mattress, because the git had no shred of self-control - before they heard Ron shout back:
Harry chuckled, turning away to look at the rest of the store, at his friends that walked around with full bags and eager tweezers. Draco, on the other hand, was transfixed by the pale curve of his profile.
‘Come on, Malfoy, what do you say? Brave enough to steal it, but not to drink it?’ Harry drawled, and it was that tone, so reminiscent - fucking identical - to the one with which he’d called Draco
Soon he was pushing back, curious, experimenting, growing more confident by the minute, and the noise he made when Draco dug fingers into his hips to snap back into him with a slick squelsh was utterly sinful.
‘Malfoy, mate, stop,’ Dean Thomas said. His forehead was glistening with sweat, his breath ragged, his gaze constantly flickering to the tight circle of crouched figures in the grass. ‘You’ll just make a scene. I mean, not
It was cold in the street. He hadn’t even bothered to get his coat back. He headed to Honeydukes, still planning on using the secret passage, and as he cut through the frozen night, enveloped in dark air, crushed by a sky of oppressive black, there creeped upon him the most frightened little thing, small and aching to be loved and sure it would never be; and this pulse of light went as quickly as it had come, and left behind something sour and resigned.
Wasn’t that a revelation? That Harry had fallen moments after foregoing Draco’s support? That, if Draco had kept things friendly inside the pub, Potter might have left their arms linked, and Draco could have helped him down the steps and onto the street? That he could have so easily
‘Mostly, though the Death Eater business was also a factor,’ Draco retorted, and smirked when he heard Potter laugh, before he leaned into Draco to swipe a tart out of the box, biting out half of it.
‘Of course they are. They’re bloody daft,’ Hermione huffed. Draco would have felt a pang of sympathy for her, if he wasn’t otherwise concerned - she really was the reason those nitwits had survived long enough to face the war.
‘I’m fine, man,’ Potter scoffed, and Draco wanted to roll his eyes. So Potter’s friends, inattentive Gryffindors as they were, had actually noticed his ungodly choice of clothes. It was Potter, of course, that refused to put on a decent amount of layers.
‘Potter,’ he warned once Harry had gone especially erratic. He was dangerously close to the edge himself, bucking into Harry’s fist. ‘You offered.’
Draco sighed, a sorry pretense at put-upon. He was already searching for his wallet with one hand, though, drinking the rest of his tea at once before they headed to the counter.
Draco stepped closer after the smallest pause and offered him the bottle. Harry took a brief sip - he didn’t seem especially in the mood for it - before placing the bottle on a dusty vanity. The round mirror had been shattered, flickering moonbeams in infinite directions.
‘No,’ Harry sighed. He seemed almost disappointed, but when he looked up at Draco and squeezed his hand, there was a gentle smile ghosting his lips. ‘I still think I like them better, though.’
‘Then you have another one,’ Ron shrugged and rested his hands on the bartop. ‘Harry, you too, Sue saw some friends and drank with them, so the rule’s off. And take my fucking coat already, you’re a breeze away from freezing.’
‘They ought to have waited here, then,’ Harry shrugged. They’d both gotten to the ending of the stairs, trying not to touch in the narrow step.
The shots were being poured in a row of shining glasses, countless elbows resting impatiently on the bartop. Ron scratched his nose, confused for a moment, before his eyes focused on Pansy.
‘Of course I did,’ Draco scoffed. ‘Don’t know if you noticed, but I was a bit obsessed with you at the time.’
Draco looked out one of the partially boarded up windows, catching a glimpse of the pitch black sky.
adrenaline junky with the natural eyesight of a mole? He was going to bloody topple off his broom and die, and honestly, after such a stupid decision, he
‘Oh no, I want to know the full story. You’re bloody shit at potions, Potter, there’s no way you brewed polyjuice in second year,’ he said, trying to pass the fondness in his tone for mockery.
When they came down from the edge, bodies spent and fingers sticky, Draco’s stomach was an insufferably painful knot high up in his throat.
‘I don’t think Slughorn considers it his to change,’ Draco shrugged. Severus Snape was still present somehow, an aura that lingered within the stone walls. That storage room still felt his, as did his seat at the professors’ table, the Potions classroom and the Slytherin house.
But Harry and Luna only laughed and came down themselves to join them in the dungeon hall. Harry stepped towards him, shifting his weight between his feet, a crooked,
‘Quit it, Granger,’ he snapped. He would have moved - he would have left that fucking place and gone back to Hogwarts, and gone up to the library, and spied on fucking Leanne until his eyes were blurry with unshed tears - but he was rooted to his spot, veins ice and muscles stone, Hermione’s gaze pinning him in place.
Draco bobbed a few more times before he eased out. The most obscene string of saliva dangled between the tip of Harry's cock and his own lip.
. Or maybe Draco was just biased - he didn’t think so, however. If there was such a thing as objective beauty, then Harry incarnated it.
‘I’d noticed,’ Harry snorted. For a moment, he stood by the door, his grin lopsided; then, he seemed to catch himself and walked closer. ‘Are those the ingredients?’
'Merlin, Potter, calm down, would you?' Draco said, overly casual, just to spite, 'I'm making you come, obviously. On a condition,' he forced himself to meet Potter's frustrated eyes, to keep his voice levelled as he spoke, 'Keep saying my name, yes? Scream it, Potter.'
‘Yes, I know,’ Draco sighed. He brushed their lips together again, one parting gesture. ‘Oh, and Harry?’
‘And all day tomorrow. They’re bringing in another Healer for advice. Oh, don’t give me that look, it’s not that bad.’
Harry huffed a laugh. ‘I’m sure it would. I just-’ he broke off, biting his lip. He didn’t seem very happy with himself when he spoke. ‘I’ve never done it before.’
He was watching the teams warm up, and trying to understand how was it that the Gryffindors, almost all of them hungover, were
'Defeats the purpose, love,' he said, mouth grazing his second bruise - and Harry tensed again at the name, thighs closing tighter against Draco's hips. Draco wished he could call him that forever: it was as honest as he could be. 'I want people to see.'
His curiosity as to how the test had gone grew; in unison, his bravery shrunk into something meek and lacking in spine. If Harry had told his friends - and Draco had asked him to, he remembered that, but had Harry actually agreed? -, then it’d be different. For that, Draco would swat all pesky unsureties and charge up to him and
Harry had his glass in his hand. Draco thought - idly, as one thinks of a disaster a millisecond before it happens - that if Harry drank he would most likely not think of anything else for the rest of his life.
Draco scoffed. ‘Surprisingly, Potter, I don’t plan to piss you off while my cock’s between your teeth,’ he said. Then, seeing that Harry had stopped, he ran a thumb softly through his forehead. ‘It’s hardly possible to fuck up, Potter. Lips like that, you’re practically made for it.’
to be hungover now, absolutely had to, every single basic law of biology, chemistry and physiology dictated it, so what on actual earth was he doing in his uniform, ready to play Quidditch, a bloody seeker about to zoom hundreds of feet into the air in search of a microscopic fleck of hyperactive gold, that irresponsible, reckless,
‘Spectacular display,’ drawled Blaise. ‘I’m sorry, Harry, but Draco did bully us into being nice to you. I suppose it simply doesn’t agree with poor Goyle.’
. And whenever they’d talked throughout the night, those thrilling exchanges that had meant so much to Draco, and figured to him so charged with
For one second, Draco could see Ron’s mouth contort easy and fluid, ready to spout some lazy comeback, the type of rudeness only natural for friends. It opened like that, then closed into something completely different, tense and sudden.
From the Astronomy tower, after dinner, Draco spied the group sauntering down the dark fields on their way to Hogsmeade. He closed his book with a snap and walked down the quiet halls to the lowest floor, planning to continue his reading in the windowless comfort of the Slytherin common room. He’d hardly finished his third page since he’d laid down on the sofa when Blaise and Pike came out of the dorms, their warmest cloaks donned.
‘That’s the plan, Malfoy,’ Ron scoffed - there was a hint of annoyance there, but subdued, without harm, and Draco figured it was a good start.
Harry looked at him quizzically - because he always got so wrapped up in things he could barely think, the twat - and Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry narrowed his eyes a bit. ‘We’re doing full honesty, I’ll have you know. And no refusing questions.’
Harry’s laugh was breathless. ‘I guess so. You answer, I’m a bit-’ he brought a hand to his cock, stroking it once. ‘-Yeah, busy.’
Harry shrugged. ‘She just said you were feeling ill. Thought maybe you’d backed out,’ he smirked, ‘Was it as hard as you thought it would be?’
Hermione’s smile was an unconvinced little thing. ‘I know it’s not easy for you, Malfoy. But it isn’t easy for us either,’ she looked at him at last, and there was some sort of sadness in her eye that made Draco feel small. ‘It’d help if you didn’t behave like a complete twat all the time.’
‘You’re mad regardless,’ Draco managed to say. He wasn't quite paying attention, however - all his focus was on Harry.
His mind was set, and he was waiting for the bartender, thrumming his fingers on the bartop to the rhythm of the song that was playing, which was low and hypnotizing and almost made him forget, when he felt fingers curl tightly around his shoulder.
, and Draco couldn’t bear it. ‘Up, up, Potter, come on,’ he urged, voice ragged, pulling Harry up by the hair. Harry dropped his cock with the most unbelievable reluctant noise, and Draco caught him for a desperate kiss.
Pansy sent him a pointed look which he primly ignored, focusing instead on the pieces of honey glazed pork on his plate that he'd been moving around with his fork.
And those words, the thrilled tone in it, the little twinkle of wonder in Harry’s eyes, lifted Draco’s spirits - because perhaps Harry had been there once before, perhaps it hadn’t been a complete surprise, perhaps Draco hadn’t quite impressed him by showing him this strange hall like he’d childishly hoped, but Harry didn’t exactly seem disappointed. Oh, Draco had worried that Harry would return to his dorm that night and regret not having gone to Hogsmeade with his friends, that he’d leave disillusioned with Draco’s life, disillusioned with Draco himself, but he rather seemed
That first day, he’d ended up turning on his heels and leaving the Great Hall without eating a thing. He’d holed up in his room instead and tried to forget.
‘You do realize,’ Harry started, tone measured. He seemed to be fighting off a smile. ‘That you wouldn’t be able to kiss me properly with this?’
A hand pressed slightly at Draco’s chest as Harry pushed himself up to regard him better. He looked serious now - had probably picked up on the pitifully frightened note in Draco’s tone.
He was going to, but Pansy spoke first, her gaze the most dangerous shade of amused from where she was sitting between Luna and Hermione.
‘What’s wrong with him?’ Draco frowned, but Finnigan had already turned away, and the table had been flooded by a wave of chatter that left no room for him. He couldn’t help the surge of disappointment: he’d been looking forward to seeing Harry, even if in a tense, hesitant way. Despite the anxiety there’d been excitement, some flush of colour in his skin whenever he remembered Harry inviting him in the greenhouse; curiosity as to what on earth Harry had done to show his House; a very selfish wish for Potter to notice the ever-shifting tattoos coiling around his arms - after all, he’d said once, that first night, that Draco looked good, that black
. How did he keep from laughing whenever he saw Harry, when he was shaken mute and breathless with the urge to touch? Crippling love. A joke.
. They'd spoken almost casually; laughed almost peacefully, and they seemed now, to an odd observer, very much like the ordinary pair of friends waiting for each other by the loo.
He could almost pretend, when Harry said his name, that they were doing this somewhere sober and planned and - because Draco truly was pathetic -
Pansy knew. He’d told Pansy and it hadn’t been a problem. It had been a relief, telling her. But this - and this was happening, he couldn’t take it back, could never undo it, could never wish it away - was entirely different, was impossibly worse.
and now the confirmation rested flushed and breathless between his legs, and Draco suddenly wished that Harry would end up with a girl whenever he got bored of him - maybe even bloody Ginny, so he could marry her and spend his life giving head to her all delicate and soft, and no one but Draco would ever get to see him stuffed full, his throat convulsing, breathless and flushed, his nipples still hardened into desperate rosy peaks.
The liquid looked like thick oil, and smelt acrid. Harry held each of his shots in one hand, while Draco looked at his with a hint of regret - he prided himself in drinking responsibly, he always kept his
She left, closing the door behind her. The dorm room plunged into silence once more, the air saturated, the other beds vacant and half-made. Draco settled into the warm peace of it, fitting his head on his pillow and shutting his eyes. He’d go back to sleep. He’d fly through the hours in his subconscious; when he managed to wake without his sight spinning he’d go for that tea, cold or not. Then, he’d trade his bed for the sofa in the common room and spend the rest of his day reading, staring into the void and wishing himself dead.
‘How many times have you lied to us about where you were going, because you were actually fooling around with Malfoy?’ asked Alicia.
, both Harry’s climax in his hand and his own - bloody sinful, fucking unbelievable, and Draco didn’t think he’d ever laughed as much in his life.
He did it quickly, like one who knows they’ve overstepped. Firmly, because he might as well have no doubts that he’d done it. His lip stung like hell. He could feel the layer of dust on the back of his neck as he craned it for a better angle - could feel, after a breathless millisecond, Harry move a little towards him, a brush of warmth, a flick of his tongue, before he withdrew. His eyes were wide, his smile more so.
They set it and Harry sauntered off with his little amused smile. Draco’s books were scattered all over the desk. He couldn’t quite bring himself to mind.
Harry didn’t falter at Draco’s unfriendly tone. His teeth were clenched resolutely, and he huffed in frustration. 'Why’d you do it, Malfoy?’
- where had Potter unearthed it from? -, an innocent question, Granger’s reliable passion for monologues, and all his friends knew just enough to make it through. Passive help. Ridiculously obvious; ridiculously devoid of proof. Just enough to look into Draco’s eyes and very proudly say he hadn’t told a soul.
‘Such a child,’ he repeated, smiling this time. ‘Answer me this, then: what you said about Hermione and Ron… Are we dating as well, then?’
Draco took a can out of the plastic net. Dean closed the door gingerly, and the four of them continued their way to the stairwell. Each of the other boys ended up taking their own beer, and Sean and Dean huddled together in their usual erratic whispers. Draco, taking big gulps of his beer for courage, neared Ron as they started up the stairs.
Harry laughed - he didn’t sound nervous anymore, he’d most likely forgotten Draco was even there. There were footsteps, then the swing of a door, a thud, silence.
'Malfoy, fuck, Malfoy,' Harry was saying, urgent, in a pitched tone. Complying, so unbelievably sweet, saying Malfoy's name like it was some kind of prayer, so genuine that Draco was absolutely certain he was pretending, but he didn't even care, because it sounded bloody wonderful.
Tracey’s gravelly voice cracked with how loud she projected it. Out the corner of his eye, Draco could see her approach with Blaise and Rowena.
Presently, he was there, feeling the early dew bead and soak through his robes where they splayed over short grass. He wasn't alone this time. Pansy stood next to him, an idle hand in his hair.
'It'd be difficult,' Draco conceded, the vicious start of a smirk forming on his lips. 'Then again, people would be more likely to hear you than me. You get quite high-pitched when you're hard, Harry.'
'You know what, Gryffindors are always so bloody condescending. Always waiting for everyone to be just
rise in his mind. Said it with the subtlest hint of suggestion and already with an overarch of smugness, for he
Besides, there was something delicious in seeing Harry squirm with the same lust that had cursed him for years. In a sense, it was only fair.
Blaise simply shrugged. He had Pike’s wrists in his hands now, neatly smoothing the fabric there. Pike, within his very limited portfolio of expressions, seemed incredibly embarrassed.
have it in for you? Hermione was apologizing,’ Harry shouted. Draco glanced up from the page at last: the other boy was soaked from head to toe, hair plastered to his forehead. It seemed blacker from the rain. His glasses were dripping, and his wet robes were pooling at his feet, hanging heavy from his arms.
At the genuinity of his words, Draco’s smile grew as well - too fond, too vulnerable, his orgasm having rendered him tired and open. He kissed Harry’s forehead, right over his right eyebrow, then under his eye, then his mouth, slipping his tongue inside.
‘I suppose that’s fair,’ she smirked, unearthing some sickles from her purse. ‘Now, I think we’ve brooded sufficiently, wouldn’t you agree? Let’s get back to the sunshine.’
Draco sighed. It was dreadfully easy to cast his memory back to that first day he’d seen Harry - seen
‘But infinitely more pleasant means,’ Draco smirked. Harry met his gaze with an amused fondness reminiscent of that tepid morning with the Alihotsy - and Draco had told him he
him - and she tried to push him forward again, to approach the group, but Draco set his feet firmly on the cobblestone.
'Malfoy's here?' Neville's voice was a nervous whisper, raising in waves from the alcohol. He turned his head to look at Harry in question, and his lips were almost on his cheek, and Harry laughed, and it was friendly and carefree and Draco
The idiot was going to try to play without one arm. Not to prove anything, not to unnerve Draco, not to show off how brave he was - rather because he genuinely thought he could; because he lived off that impulse, because he was always, at any given moment, unbridled energy and foolish confidence, and he was honestly going to kill himself, and Draco fucking
‘You just want to show off, don’t you?’ Harry mused. He let out the softest breath as Draco began nipping at his lip.
The problem was the lack of definition of it all. Draco liked order, and labels could be extremely reassuring. So, if they weren’t boyfriends, and they weren’t quite friends with benefits, what were they? When Harry had suggested they should do it again, he’d done it in the vague tone of someone throwing an idea into the air to see how they like it. It lacked details. There was no protocol. Draco doubted he was allowed to go ahead and kiss him whenever he crossed the tosser in the halls, no matter how lovely he seemed. He always ended up ogling him silently. Harry never looked back.
And Draco could wish, could hope Harry had kissed him because he’d wanted to, not because that wretched green thing, what was it called again?, had been poisoning his mind, but his own headache told him the truth: if Draco was like this, on the verge of dissolving right into the floorboards of the bleachers, and Harry had drunk more than him, then there was no way Harry could be
Pansy, meanwhile, had managed to turn in the little space she had, and she was inspecting the scene with a critical eye.
Draco laughed, his breath warm against Harry's arsehole, and spread his cheeks for better access. 'I'll carry on, then,' he mused, kissing the rim more firmly, swiping the tip of his tongue over it just to relish in Harry's gasp. It seemed so small in that moment, so
‘Funny how Granger is more furious about this than you,' Draco idly pointed out. The picture of Harry licking the filling of the treacle tarts was undeniably charming, and he was fighting the temptation of leaning in and kissing the sugar off his lips.
As time passed and the night deepened, Draco relaxed again, nursing his headache. He was awful drunk, that much was clear - and still, whenever he watched Harry share a few drinks with the others, he himself indulged in his firewhiskey. A compulsion, it was, to keep up with Harry. It blurred his vision even more, turned his hand into the peskiest jittery thing, and melted right into the dazed feeling from his earlier orgasm, weighing in his bones.
Harry chuckled. ‘Because,’ his eyes took on a mischievous twinkle. ‘No one likes to go about in the dungeons. Plus, after Ron threw that helmet in it, anyone who’s caught there again will be screwed.’
The nurse bowed her head in brisk goodbye and disappeared into the infirmary. Draco saw but a flash of white covers - no sight of Harry. Hermione regarded him coolly.  She had the type of quiet anger that made words sharp and not hot.
‘Oh, I’m bloody not,’ Ron said, a breath of disbelieving laughter escaping him like the very notion was preposterous. ‘I’m going to go meet her and forget all about… whatever this is.’
‘You’re always wandering around at night anyway,’ Draco ventured. ‘One would think you’d like the challenge of sneaking into the Slytherin area.’
‘One would think that you’d be familiar with the term ‘procrastination’. Or is the word too long for you?’
The students stifled their laughs in the crooks of their elbows and the backs of their hands. Pansy, always one for subtlety, kicked him under the table, then smiled sweetly when he faced her with a glare.
Draco chuckled. The sound came out a shade too breathless. He placed his hands lightly back on Harry’s hips. ‘Of course. But I assure you it’ll be very educational.’
Pansy laughed. 'Do you honestly think that boy does anything for attention? I imagine he's quite sick of it.'
- and so, if Draco loved the most, if he'd ached the most, couldn't it be that the cosmos had helped
His eyes glistened so enticingly, and his tongue was flicking out to lick his lips in nervous excitement, and it seemed, the idea of the game, in the complicit privacy of the dim storage room, unexplainably
Time went by slurred and sticky until Friday. Draco refused to disclose anything about their plans, and Harry soon gave up asking. Meanwhile, Draco made sure the 8th year Slytherins would be on their best behaviour - or a semblance of it, or an
He’d obviously said it as a partial jab, the littlest bit vindictive, because how could he not? For years Draco had lounged in the common room or laid on his bed with Blaise, and they’d trashed Harry, hated the perfect Gryffindor boy together, made rude jokes and pathetic plans, and now Draco was
‘I doubt anyone will notice. And even if they do, I’m sure Nearly Headless Nick has already told everyone that you’re a
‘Well, wipe your chin, mate, you look bloody ghastly,’ he muttered. Then, he addressed the whole group, ‘Seamus is back, let’s get going.’
Moments later, he heard the door open once more. Pansy leaned against the wall beside him, nudging him with her boot.
‘Of course I did. It was my turn, wasn’t it?’ Ron said while he shrugged out of his coat. ‘It’s in the cupboards.’
Harry seemed to understand. He gave a small apologetic smile, bit off a broken sound when Draco gently - and with overly lingering fingers - placed his softened cock back inside his underwear, and raised his voice:
Justin Fletchley finished paying his embarrassing amount of chocolate frogs, and they all left the shop. Outside, the wind had lifted up, and Ron began counting heads again as they shivered in the street.
Ron gave him a long look. Finally, his features eased, the guarded beginnings of a smile twitching in his lips.
Harry laughed, his leg jostling Draco’s, firm and hot against him, and Draco thought for the first time that night that perhaps House Parties could be fun after all.
hip and gripped a little tighter, inched a little closer. Harry, on his part, was looking around with wild eyes, a hand unsure on Draco’s upper arm.
Because that was Dean Thomas's unmistakably tall figure that had just walked in, and behind him Draco had seen a flash of fucking
‘One of us has to, or the game’ll never end and those idiots will all kill each other,’ Draco remarked, tilting his head down, where the frenzy of Chasers and Beaters went on in a cacophony of screams and groans and sharp hisses as the brooms cut through the air. Weasley had missed the Quaffle at the hoops - ten points to Slytherin.
Harry’s laughter was an exhausted, desperate little thing. ‘You’ll get- get smug if you hear it too much.’
At Hog’s Head, in the dim lighting, with his own arm slung over Harry’s shoulders. Harry’s head ever inching towards his shoulder, as if meaning to settle into its warmth, only to lunge forward with excitement at someone else’s words time and time again. Restless energy, a universe of chaos under black hair, beautiful,
With a smirk, Draco slicked his finger and pushed the tip of it inside. It slid in easily at first, halfway through, sucked in by the burning muscle. Harry moaned, Draco pressed further and couldn't resist stroking his own cock when the slick made an obscene sound at the rim. It was bloody
They went, Draco primly resisting the urge to look back at Harry from over his shoulder as he headed to the bar. There was only one stool empty: Pansy took it, crossing her legs, and Draco leaned on the bartop to her left.
that, but concern tended to fade when he saw Harry’s friends drink as much as he did. After all, it wasn’t like Harry was drinking alone at some measly hours in the morning, was he? He went out with his friends, they all drank, all had a bit too much, and it wasn’t properly unhealthy. A distraction. Stress relieving. It didn’t have to be more than that, but Pansy made it seem so
Nearly Headless Nick couldn’t know, however, the extent of it. For all his pretenses of omnipresence, his tendencies to float right through halls and spy on everyone, he could never know how often Draco had spied on Harry and his friends. Harry couldn’t know either. He could joke, but he couldn’t picture the hours wasted not batting an eye, watching with an aching heart, twisting fake hatred in his face until it hurt. He couldn’t picture the suffering, nor the tearful joy of being here now, holding him close, open and honest and
Draco snorted. Harry’s words made heat curl low inside him. ‘I do as well,’ he whispered, trailing back up to kiss his lips, ‘I think you’ll excell it. For now, though, you could stay still and let
Come Friday, the eighth years were a fit of nerves over Slughorn’s test. It was the Slytherin’s custom to play a modicum of stressed for appearance’s sake - in general, all students sat studying in the cold dungeon halls, a frantic, solidary mess of Gryffindors, Slytherins, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws between manuals, notebooks and loose, scribbled pages, until the hour finally came and Slughorn ushered them in.
The corridor was deserted. The classroom door was firmly shut. Draco leaned against one of the walls, brow furrowed and arms wrapped around himself. He’d resolved - perhaps presumptuously, but it wasn’t like Harry had been
‘Sod off,’ Draco muttered, squinting dizzily at the blur that was Pansy sitting besides his bed. ‘Put it on the table, would you? Thank you.’
Draco nodded absently. Thomas was eager to leave him and disappear in the circle of Gryffindors. They were all so huddled together, backs curved and arms over each other, that he couldn’t even see Harry on the grass.
‘Can’t get much worse,’ Harry chuckled. He was doing up the buttons of his shirt - really, it was a shame to hide all that skin.
'I didn't think anyone was allowed to touch your hair,' Harry said with a disbelieving, breathless laugh. He was squirming against the cold tiles, and when Draco looked up at him he'd forgotten the goddamn
Harry murmured, soft and broken between bouts of laughter, eyes clinging onto some shred of seriousness in a millisecond of sanity. But then Draco rewarded him with a quickening of his pace, filthy and frenzied and loud, and Harry was thrown into mindless euphoria as he came, spilling with needy little twitches in Draco’s hand. His fingers convulsed desperately around Draco’s cock, and that sent him over as well. It felt so
Upstairs, on an even smaller patch of space, people waited in lines for the loo. While the women's was relatively large, the men's had only two people, and Draco fitted himself in a corner behind them, letting himself breathe in the shadows.
- and wasn’t that terribly disconcerting? - while Harry tucked himself further into the curve of Draco’s side. In those cold, bare stone corridors they were the strangest picture of styled hairs, clashing colours and sweeping fabrics.
‘Oy! There’s tables here, hurry up!’ shouted Dean Thomas, already cutting through the crowd. Draco turned to speak to Potter - to ask, if he was bold enough, if he wanted to get a drink -, but then Harry was stepping forward in a wave of grey -
Draco hummed. Hermione and Ron were still staring; many others too, Draco reckoned. He wasn’t much inclined to let go of Harry’s wrist, however.
Pale sunlight filtered through, hitting off the polished pillars of the canopy beds. They weren’t made: the covers had been pulled down, showing white sheets over narrow mattresses and creased pillows. All were empty, except for one.
, and each one of Harry’s responses felt like rejection, and it was making something in Draco unbearably sad.
They pranced around like they were posing for the Daily Prophet, all smiles and laughter, with their robes just slightly dishevelled and their scarves dangling perilously from their shoulders, and their hair screwed up, and their glasses slipping from their nose - Merlin, why couldn't he just push them up?... In any sense, the students - all of them - were happy.
The sudden suction made him muffle a sound deep in his throat, a low and primitive thing akin to a growl; and the way his fingers worked in tandem with his mouth in a frenzy of stimulation, the sight of him red-faced and eager to please, the entire ecstasy of the situation pushed him right up to brink of his climax - pushed Harry too, because he was getting loud, or trying to, tears perfectly round in the corners of his eyes and neck tendons straining as he moaned long and desperate around Draco’s cock.
‘D’you think… d’you think we’d make a profit selling this?’ Harry mused. He was cut off by a moan when Draco nipped more harshly at his skin. ‘Fuck, Malfoy, I want to suck you off.’
Neville nodded, a flop of dark brown hair hanging from his forehead, and called the attention of the bartender.
Pansy laughed again as they turned a corner, the train station coming into view against the dark sky.
‘Alright, mates, we got enough beans for quite a few rounds, so everyone put some sickles up for shots,’ said Alicia, spreading a selection of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans on the table. An order of firewhiskey had already been placed, but everyone began searching their pockets all the same.
He zoomed past him in a blur; Draco turned to see him return to the bustling game, his battered arm limply dangling by his side.
'Are you fishing for compliments?'  Harry raised an eyebrow, his lips tweaking up. His eyes were twinkling, tired and glazed under the glitter.
Besides, no amount of elegance could distract from the red rash on his neck, the absolute discomfort of his demeanour as he sat in the back carriage, Pansy's hand steady on his forearm, shaking with each bump of the train as it trod along the tracks and Draco tried not to think about the fact that Potter was sitting a few carriages away.
Draco hid his smile in Harry’s hair. ‘Don’t be daft. You ought to have lost all your money in shots. Speaking of which - shall we go out with your friends tonight?’
‘We were Death Eaters, Harry,’ Draco snorted. ‘Compared to that, sneaking out our dorms didn’t really feel like overstepping.’
-’ Harry’s voice was tight, like he was trying not to scream; frustrated, desperate, and Draco really hadn’t thought their first conversation after the previous night would be like this, but he was happy it was. Frustrating Harry was normal, safe - he’d thrived on it for years. ‘I’m fine, I’m a fucking good flier, and I’m less hungover than you are. You don’t even have your gear.’
He could taste himself on Harry’s tongue, and the saliva coating Harry’s lips made the whole thing impossibly filthy. His cock, slick with spit, grinded against Harry’s bare stomach, sticking pearls of precum to the overheated skin, and Draco wanted to smear it in, embed it there like some childish mark of possession, but he couldn’t bring himself to untangle his fingers from Harry’s hair where they were gripping sharply and angling his head just right, fussing with it, keeping him in place. Harry let out a string of moans, too surprised to properly fight for control of the kiss. Draco abused his mouth, plunged a demanding tongue inside to taste all over, nipped persistent and vicious at the bottom lip of this boy he loved, this boy he now, at least for the night, could hold in his arms.
‘He doesn’t keep the essay prompts in his desk,’ Dean Thomas said, holding onto the doorknob with both hands, ‘Ron, mate, why are you holding a head?’
‘Yeah, and-’ Harry’s little cut off moan was drowned by the music and chattering around them. ‘-and a sink that’s- ah, that’s at a bloody great height.’
‘Then that settles it,’ Harry’s smile was easy, fucking excited, and he jostled their entwined fingers.
Harry snorted. He was still holding his glass close to his face, as if at any minute he’d need another sip, and in the red light his eyeshadow took on a sinful intensity, and he was Lust incarnate.
Harry bit his lip. He was fiddling with the zipper of the bag, all of him a mess of unbridled energy - and Draco was coming to find that Harry took on a dangerous level of restless when he drank, when the shred of sense within him was gone and he was nothing but that ridiculous, nonsensically charming urge to
Draco managed nothing more than a bitter laugh - and he didn’t look away from Potter, took it as a point of pride not to, because it might have been a terrible idea to go along with this game, but that didn’t mean he had to totally lose his dignity.
In the end, he chose to gather the necessary ingredients, placing them, after some consideration, on Harry’s desk. He ran a finger through the wood - the same wood he’d held onto as Harry swallowed around him - and smiled.
Yes, hissed that hardened voice inside him, in its bifurcated tongue: he’d done his best for the person he loved. Those bloody Gryffindors, with their ridiculously vague and inflexible sense of right and wrong, could be mad all they wanted; Harry himself could be furious, and Draco wouldn’t care - he rathered Harry never spoke to him again because he so chose than because he was dead.
There were spiderwebs everywhere; the moonlight was distilled through the cracked glass of the windows, bathing the dusty furniture in a gentle white. A chandelier hung perilously over the grand piano.
They all exchanged these looks, this wave of hesitance between them, and they fell into nervous silence. It was Harry's face, half obscured by shadows, this face that had once been so close to his, that had asked him to dance - 'You're so terribly uptight, Malfoy' - that drove Draco, as if by some irrepressible instinct, to speak up.
There was a small pause, Draco’s words hanging in the air, sounding very much like a plea. Then, Harry spoke, his voice clipped.
Neville nodded. His eyes really were frightening, charmed red like that. ‘In my calf, almost from knee to ankle. It’s nasty.’
When he managed to round the corner of the shelf and return to the center of the shop, the other members of the group were queued in front of the tired man, dangling bursting bags in their restless hands. Draco leaned against a wall, watching as each of them counted the coins on their palms with slow, fuzzy minds. He figured Honeydukes made a fortune out of drunk Hogwarts students.
Idly, in the logic side of his mind, he was sure Harry was doing this because he was drunk, and that he should stop this. As it was, he'd never felt happier in his life, so he just clamped his hand down harder on the back of Harry's neck - and
‘Our darling Draco is hungover, Greg,’ tittered Blaise, slim figure sliding so elegantly through the cold room. He lifted Draco’s legs and deposited them in his lap as he sat down, knotting his tie.
Harry twisted his lips in what Draco assumed was an attempt to lie, smugness quickly leaving his expression. He sighed,  shaking his head with a hint of amusement.
He’d said it mostly in amusement, but the subtle edge wasn’t lost to Draco. It truly was forsaken, wasn’t it? He’d ruined it.
He did. The alcohol was something he’d never tried before, horribly bitter, near acid in his throat, and one pesky tear formed in the corner of his eyes as he slammed the glass down. Beside him, he could feel Harry fidget.
The exact same, honestly. For years, Draco had watched in resentment as everyone fawned over the famous Harry Potter, and he’d seen in their eyes that worship, that devotion that bled so fluidly into subservience. They’d do anything he asked, though the stupid, foolish,
'I don't think-' another groan as Draco swallowed him midway, then withdrew, 'I don't think the point of this is to make it
And he pulled back to see it again, to witness just how perfect Harry’s arse was, clenching around his cock in this maddening standstill, until it wasn’t a standstill any longer - as he pulled back his cock slid halfway out, and he couldn’t help thrusting in again, slow but sure, bottoming out again. They both moaned, Draco did it again - just as slow, so he could
‘Rowena,’ Blaise said with something triumphant in his tone. Pike was still fussing over the upturned brims of his sleeves.
'Shouldn't Granger be here to help with that?' Draco asked, because that group, made almost entirely of idle courage, did not seem quite able to deal with incantations.
'Not a fan of pacing yourself?' he asked, shifting so he was with his back to the line of girls, a wall between them and Potter, so that only he could see the boy's smiles and rosy cheeks, because sometimes it was ridiculously too tempting to pretend like he had any right in doing things like that.
This was a terrible idea. An awful, awful impulse driven by the most archaic urge to show how brave he was. Draco was appalled at himself, in that personal way one's appalled without quite doing anything about it. The truth was he'd carry on with this little pathetic display, since in that part - half, really - of his brain where thought and emotion were reserved exclusively to Harry Potter, it all made a perfect deal of sense. Harry would see him neatly blended with his friends,
; for one sudden, heady moment, Harry reciprocating that blowjob.  They swirled almost simultaneously, and culminated in this very vague, overwhelming wish to see him, so he withstood her piercing gaze with one nonplussed eyebrow raised, and it was her, in the end, that broke the impasse.
'Oh, don't give me that look,' Ron interrupted. 'D'you think she'd keep it all to herself? She told me, and she said we should let you be, and I’m here thinking: did you like him when you tried to Crucio him in that bathroom? In fourth year, when you made those badges? Every single fucking day that you pestered him, bullied him, bullied
'Think we can last longer than them?' he asked with a smirk, tilting his head towards the other stalls, from where they could hear a string of muffled moans.
They walked together back to the castle. Some of the windows were already dotted bright, making it stand out against the snow.
Not that Draco had to tell him that. It was important to keep his gushing to a moderate level - not for the sake of Harry’s ego, no, Draco would spoil him to the point of narcissism if he could, Harry
He stood, flattening the creases of his shirt for one lingering moment. He was certain Harry was looking at him with some sort of pity, or worse - relief at being rid of him. It’d been a mistake going there. Harry didn’t cherish his apology as much as he cherished his absence. He ought to have stayed away, waited a few days, made sure not to overstep. What this little exercise had done was strain their relationship.
With the enlightenment of time, dissuading excitement and dulling perspectives with every ticking second, the memory of that surreal night dimmed down into something much more understandable. By the end of the weekend, and sobered under the tepid sunlight, Draco had already analyzed the entirety of the evening in so many different ways that he could strip down each digressing glimmer of hope and stick only with the facts.
He’d fantasized saying those words at least a thousand times. He’d never thought he’d actually say them, and they felt heavy in his tongue.
Draco did his best to shrug. His tie - which Blaise had tied for him - was snapping loudly at his chest.
‘Is that the Gryffindor argument for fucking everything? You’ll die next time, you absolute tosser!’
This vigor, rewarding as it was in the moment - especially when it made Harry buck upward - did result in a particular sharp pain, and the telling taste of iron seeping into his tongue.
, and how was it that this secret he’d kept since his first year of school could be destroyed so easily, with just a few drunken words and a pesky spurt of jealousy?
- he hadn’t understood, he’d never understand, because Draco had wished his love away for so long that he’d made it invisible.
‘I suppose that would depend on your definition of fucking,’ he told him, voice hopelessly tender - and he knew the others could hear him, he knew that Pansy would
‘You know, it’s cool, you know, that you’re here,’ Neville said, ‘We don’t mind. Most of us, that is.’
. He rewarded it with a small, perhaps overly sweet kiss on the dip of his hip bone. 'Good. Now, put your hands on my bloody hair, and let me do this, yes?'
‘We didn’t,’ Harry intervened. No, what they'd done at the Shrieking Shack couldn't be considered fucking. Draco reckoned it'd be more accurate to call it a cosmic test of his self-control.
Harry didn’t show up at all that day. Granger and Weasley were fleeting faces. A handful of younger students were planning to venture into the edges of the Forbidden Forest to pluck some flowers for the famous Harry Potter - now all the more popular because he was wounded, and with that came the exciting reminder of his mortality.
'What would you have had me do, then?' he asked absently, his eyes flittering around the Great Hall. The institutionalized habit of house-designated tables had mostly crumbled since the beginning of the year - friends sat with friends, independently of house, which meant Potter was much more difficult to pin these days: Draco had seen him sitting in every corner of the Hall by now - all except Draco's table, which remained still nearly exclusively Slytherin.
‘It’s here,’ Ron said, stopping by a heavy wooden door. ‘Don’t…’ he waved a hand around, then snapped his gaze stubbornly to the floor. ‘Whatever, mate. Don’t be a twat, I guess.’
What I have to tell you is that cooking would be much more fun if the ingredients had some of the names from the HP universe. Like, gillyweed? Yes, please.
'Nothing that matters,' Draco insisted, taking a sip from the glass of wizard's brew they were sharing.
Draco guessed that surviving the War really did put things into perspective: they'd all returned to retake their last year - because not all of them were
it into existence, perhaps the universe had taken pity on him, because surely no one had ever loved someone as much as Draco loved Harry - there was no possible way, it couldn't be, they'd
Potter laughed, something pretty and uninhibited that made him shake, ‘Come on, Malfoy, you were a tosser to everyone.’
Pansy sighed, taking a sip of her tea. ‘You can be so painfully dull, darling. At least tell me what you did, if you didn’t fuck.’
Potions before, but it was quickly sorted, and shortly they were putting the brew on a low simmer to help dissolve the powdered castor teeth.
Draco nodded absently, his gaze falling on the row of girls waiting in line. Some were throwing glimpses their way, and Draco
Moved by that thought, and hoping to get some kind of reaction from Harry - maybe his eyes would settle on him for more than five fucking seconds for the first time that night - he added:
It was when he was trailing down the narrow path of frosted grass and wet stone at the curve that showed the first glimpse of the field that he noticed a few too many broomsticks, an unusual amount of silhouettes scattered along the seats.
They weren’t exactly whispering, the three of them, and Draco wondered if anyone up in the dormitories, perhaps some other insomniac, would hear. He even had the temptation to wake his colleagues himself, or, even worse, to wake a teacher. But that was the echo of the pest he’d been years ago, set on making everyone else as miserable as he felt. Draco had adopted a much more detached outlook now, which consisted on letting everyone be as stupid as they pleased, as long as they did so away from him.
made - and his eyes lit in glitter. He liked the need of it, the imprinted memory of jutted hips against graffitied tile.
He was frustratedly pushing out of the way a bunch of pink, swirling vials, when there was a knock on the door, and a creak as it opened.
Harry hissed when he finally got a hand around himself. Draco’s own erection was sliding in dizzying friction against Harry’s shirt.
‘I think I’d quite like her to know as well, actually,’ Draco smirked, gently kissing the corner of Harry’s mouth.
Draco had searched in Hermione's ever-candid expression, when Pansy had so nonchalantly said 'we', for any signs of deject, but there were none, only a little disconcerted smile - and Pansy, by her account, seemed so gracefully smug already, as if there could be no further questioning that she'd won, that Draco didn't have it in him to argue.
He began to stroke Harry in earnest; full, firm movements with a little flick of his wrist, a gentle thumb teasing the slit just to make Harry hiss, to make his thighs convulse so prettily at each side of Draco's waist. Draco himself was beginning to feel a little desperate, spurred on by the sounds, the sensations, the bloody sinful sight of Harry in that position, all spread for him, welcoming him between the curve of his legs, squeezing around him… hadn't he said, just a moment ago, back at the pub, that he figured Draco would fuck him first? Did he think about it often? Did he know the answer as soon as Pansy had asked the question? Would he seem just as wanton, just as open when Draco was inching inside him? Would he keep his hands still by his sides, not touching his weeping cock, if Draco promised him a reward?
'Well, we got the keys,' he unearthed the rusty ring from the depths of his cloak. 'So it wasn't a complete failure, even if Ron woke half the school.'
'I really don't,' he drawled, 'Honestly, Potter, one would think The Boy Who Lived would have more stamina-'
Draco remembered those nights he’d spent loitering around Hogsmeade, wandering the streets and spying on this same group, and picturing he was there, next to Harry, an arm around him, or their fingers entwined, or simply the understanding that they were
There was a beat of expectant silence between them. Harry shook his head, an amused chuckle escaping him, and he looked at Draco squarely as he said, ‘Finnigan, fancy having a shot with me?’
He settled by plastering himself to Harry’s back gently, trying to control his hips and not thrust too deep. Harry was breathing deeply, and Draco nuzzled the back of his ear.
, Malfoy,' he gasped, rocking down against Malfoy's thigh. There was a thud as the door of the other stall fell open, and the other couple went zigzagging out the bathroom with ragged breaths. It was just as well - their noises were incredibly distracting, and far less interesting than the huffed little sounds spilling from Harry's lips.
It made Draco feel absurdly proud. He nuzzled absently at the soft flesh of Harry's leg, riding a high of his own - he couldn't believe he'd made Harry come, that Harry was sated and boneless because of him.
‘Oh, you like the hair, do you?’ Draco murmured, leading them smoothly through two twirling pairs. It was incredibly easy to dance when there was no fear of clashing with other people - they walked right through the dozens of ghosts, flickered in white static, only worrying to stay clear of the other flesh and bone figures.
‘It’s fine,’ Ginny said, an edge to her tone. She shook her head, then smiled a bitter, tight-lipped smile. ‘I’m going to check on the team,' turning to Draco, a subtle threat in her gaze, she added, 'I hope you play, Malfoy.’
. How could Harry not see that? How could he possibly be so reckless with his own life as to go into the game with the flimsy promise that his friends would watch over him?
‘Oh. Yes, well, I can’t bloody remember now, can I?’ Draco sighed, loosely encircling one of Harry’s wrists with his hand to pull him a bit closer. ‘You have distracting lips.’
'I'm not,' Draco said simply, and he reached for the glass again, only for Pansy to still his hand with a vicious grip.
He’d just thrown one random kink into the air, one easily popular and suitably tame, just to tease Harry a little. Predictably, almost everyone drank - there were some disturbingly heavy glances between Ron and Hermione that Draco forcefully ignored - but it wasn’t their answers that he was interested in. Instead, his eyes found Harry almost immediately after he’d spoken the words.
to be putting up a show, all rolling hips and slick red lips, liquid eyes and tousled hair, he was trying to
Draco quirked a brow. Potter thrummed his fingers - half-hidden by the sleeves of Draco’s jacket - on the bartop, his eyes dark green with something devilish.
Besides, the reality of the thing was that he was having tea with Harry at Madam Puddifoot’s. They’d said they loved each other the previous night. At this point he was so pitifully, overwhelmingly happy that Blaise and Tracey could walk in and he’d probably pay for their tea.
Inside, a grating song evoking of a carnival was playing, a short, bald man was half-dozing on the counter, and the group dispersed throughout the little corridors with bags and tongs, looking a lot like excited children. Pansy was swept into a conversation with Sue, something about the charms on one specific type of coloured lollipop that Draco had no interest in, so he wandered idly through the store, feeling very much out of place in his sombre features and black outfit, hoping for a glimpse of Harry.
‘Well, I wanted to make sure you were still alive,’ Draco drawled, though his tone was too soft to be properly teasing. Harry seemed to notice - his lips pressed lightly over Draco’s sternum through his uniform shirt, a warm touch to his cold skin.
better than that godawful absinthe. They sipped in silence for a moment, fingers wrapped around the warm ceramic, legs entangled below the table. Like a bloody pamphlet photo for the place - like all the sickly sweet couples he’d shied away from for years with envious eyes.
But Harry simply swallowed, smiled a little crooked, and offered lamely, 'You never bloody shut up,' before he was kissing him
Harry huffed, arms crossed like he was annoyed, which really just clashed with how vulnerable his lower half was, all bare and flushed and
‘Oh, fuck off,’ Harry laughed. He dabbed some of it on his fingertips and brushed it from the corner of his eyebrows to his temples. It was a hypnotizing vision. ‘You don’t like it?’
-, not to mention every other pathetic clue he’d already neatly laid out in front of him, like he wanted to get caught, from the impulsive treacle tarts to his coat to the veritaserum game, and truly, finally realize just how oblivious he’d always been, and how evident it was that Draco loved him.
'A game,'  Harry said simply, but his smile was lopsided, secretive. In any sense, a game involving veritaserum sounded dangerous - Draco had always cherished his ability to lie.
‘You looked ridiculous in your school robes, but you didn’t seem to know it. Or care, I suppose. You didn’t care, and I found it funny.’
Draco really did try not to smile. He didn’t want to seem lewd, wanted to preserve the warmth and intermittent sweetness of the night - but it hadn’t been intermittent, had it? Throughout the whole night there’d been something sugary in the air. Tenderness and a devoted notion of frailty. He’d cling to that in the innocence of the morning, and the filthier visions - Harry whimpering as he flicked his little nipples, the way his lips had glistened with his come, the desperate wet patch in his underwear - would be dug out in the privacy of his canopy bed.
Ron finished with a ragged breath. Finished with a look that was too heated for hostile. Finished, and Draco thought idly back to that exchange outside the greenhouses, where he’d mused that Ron could so easily plunge those pruning shears into his thigh. Perhaps the idea had really crossed Ron’s mind.
'Not if you're so smug about it,' Harry shot back, but he was fighting a smile and his fingers were already trailing the hems of his jacket. He chucked it on the floor - unceremonious, neglectful, and Draco had always defended a great care for good clothes, and he couldn't be bothered in the slightest at that moment - before moving on to the buttons of his shirt. All glorious skin underneath, so muted against the dark green covers, lean muscle from Quidditch and running around for seven years straight. The shirt went on the floor as well, and Harry leaned back on his elbows again. 'Will you quit staring and
‘You’re not the best at pretense, are you?’ Draco drawled. He shoved his hands in his pockets. Ron fiddled with the small pair of pruning shears he held in his.
That pitiful yearning had seeped into his tone, soaked him sickly sweet, and Harry’s eyes went wide. Draco searched in them for a sign that he could close the distance and kiss him, dispel the tension that had been building with soft touches and worshipping lips, but a moment after Harry’s eyes had slipped from his and onto the potion again.
‘Potter drank more than Weasley, is what I mean. And he’s a bloody idiot, he’ll fling himself right off his broom.’
‘You told me it on the train, love!’ Ron exclaimed. Hermione glared, Finnigan jostled her with his arm, and Ron shook against Draco’s side with silent laughter.
He hadn't said it in an unpleasant tone, but Draco had the frightening thought that perhaps Harry just wanted to hurry it up - that the drinking had made him aroused, and Draco had been the first warm body to cross his field of vision. He thought that, then primly discarded it, not because it was a silly thought, but because it didn't matter even if it was
After enough coffee, he was persuaded into going down to the Quidditch field. It didn’t even figure that bad a plan - he could lay in the bleachers, stare at the slow shifting grey clouds and try to fall back asleep. Maybe it’d start raining over him. Or snowing. Little flakes melting on his overheated skin. He could do with some snow.
Small bubbles were forming on the surface of the wretched, gelatinous rubbish he’d been cooking up. She stared at his potion, one eyebrow poised appraisingly. The bubbles burst, she rolled her eyes and lifted one arm gracefully.
‘The very same,’ Harry answered with a wry smile. ‘It broke in four different places. Gave me a concussion too.’
how often Draco had dreamt of kissing him, the millions of times he'd envisioned it and architected it with the hopefulness of a child, like he could wish it into existence. And perhaps he had
After a moment, Draco followed him in. What little focus he’d mustered was lost for the rest of the lesson; he’d have to return later to properly transplant his Bouncing Bulb. It hardly mattered, though - because when he’d walked in, across the leaves and stems and swaying heads of the other students, he’d seen Harry, and Harry had been staring back.
The group, like one sentient beast, began walking in synchronicity. Draco could spot Lovegood a few steps ahead, talking to some girl; Thomas and Finnigan, even further up, far from the crowd and whispering lamely in each other's ears between fits of laughter; in the center, a cluster of swaying heads, where Hermione and Ron were headed, that was most likely harbouring Potter. All these people, this well-oiled machine that walked with the surety of a millipede, inside which each cog and gear was invaluable in its dynamic with the others, where every component worked in a well-practised harmony - a few feet behind, Draco and Pansy, sharp-faced and dark-clothed, foreign, clashing, slowing the rhythm and staining the joy.
‘Yes,’ he whispered, nipping lazily at Harry’s bottom lip, tasting the spit and come there. He really wished they’d done this on a bed; envisioned them falling asleep somewhere soft and safe, entangled in each other’s arms. ‘You swallowed all of it.’
‘That’s the bloody stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, Potter,’ he sniggered, painfully aware of the hopeless fondness in his tone. Harry chuckled back, a tired little sound that made all of Draco’s guilt surface in an overwhelming wave: here Harry was, arm broken and skin red and purple, all because of him, and he was still friendly, still so impossibly warm, and Draco felt incredibly sorry that he’d confined him to this cold, sad, monotonous room.
Draco pulled away, drool dribbling down his chin. Some of the lipstick he’d gotten from kissing Harry was now smeared around Harry’s rim, colouring it even redder, the most obscene fucking sight Draco had ever seen. He kissed Harry’s arse right over one of the fresh bruises, a debauched kiss slick with saliva.
'I'll tell you what,' Pansy's eyes went black with challenge, 'You really want Potter to be your friend?'
'Well, I was quite bored while you were… otherwise occupied, and Granger and I got to talking… they're going to the Three Broomsticks, did you know? Hagrid's supposed to be there - we're going to meet him, isn't that lovely?'
When he did fall asleep, it was with the thought of that last contact between them: Harry’s fingers thrumming over his sternum, synching, for a single pulse, with the rhythm of his heart.
within him. He did cup Harry's arse with his hand though - it was very difficult, after all, to act unaffected when Harry was so
him, so perhaps he’d like the ink snakes, perhaps his gaze would be caught on them, even if only once, just like Draco’s gaze had been caught on him for years.
Draco scoffed, the words settling sour in his ears. ‘That’s a bloody shit argument, Weasley. Maybe next time you and Potter should just keep your arses in bed and leave me out of it, yes?
, Harry,' he said, words low; and then, just to try, just to tease, he added, 'You keep your hand there and I'll reward you, alright, sweetheart?'
Daisyroot Draught, by the conserved floral taste it left in his tongue. Mild, but worrying when added to what he’d already drunk. Neville, on the other hand, seemed to take it in stride, shaking his head and thrumming with energy.
‘Is this your first House Party, Draco?’ Luna asked. She was feeding her ghost raven peanuts. They disappeared somewhere between its beak and the translucent line of its throat.
He left. Draco sighed and made his own way through the crowd, searching for Pansy. Now she would surely be happy - he hadn’t talked that much to Potter since eighth grade had begun, hadn’t
'Oh, fuck off,' Harry said, but he was laughing, a giddy little sound. Draco had almost forgotten they were drunk - had almost let himself believe Harry was doing this sober, simply because he
And Draco swung his head to stare at Pansy, and in her eyes - for but a millisecond - was the most telltale warmth of fondness.
‘Honestly, I don’t know,’ Harry answered, looking up to give him a self-conscious smile, ‘Sorry, mate.’
him - how was it now that he’d forgiven him? Could he even extend this invitation in the name of the entire group? Would they want him there? Did
‘Hey,’ Harry said, tone slurred with amusement. His eyes were curious when he looked up at him. ‘I’ve been waiting for days to find out what this is.’
‘We haven’t, have we?’ Tracey hummed. Her eyes locked on Harry then, the darkest little slits. ‘Do you like dancing, Harry?’
‘We should,’ Draco hummed. He simply wound his arms tighter around Harry, though. ‘Tomorrow. We’ll go to Madam Puddifoot’s. I always wanted to take you there on a date.’
‘Yeah, okay,’ Harry laughed. Draco flew a little closer, so they were hovering in the air a feet from each other, still and intimate, isolated from the quick thrill of the game. ‘But you do know my team would have had my back, right?’
Pansy smirked. Her hand was on his knee over the covers, a soft pressure reminding him of bothersome legs and sickly insides, all twisted in knots and dry as deserts. No, he definitely wouldn’t drink the tea. He was nothing but a shrivelled mind at the moment.
‘I see that,’ Harry snorted, so utterly nonchalant. Granger hadn’t told him, then. Yes, it was all fine. He just had to excuse himself and leave. ‘Are you alright? Were you ill? Absinthe is wretched to keep in the first time.’
. Outside, clearer now that he was close to the door, the music still pulsed in its hypnotizing beats; the murmuring of chatter outside, promising a loud cacophony of voices as soon as he left the bathroom; and inside, in the dim lighting, within the dirty lines of tiles, Harry,
‘Formal?’ Harry asked, an eyebrow cocked. Draco simply nodded, disinclined to sate his curiosity. He’d find out soon enough, in any sense - and until then, his eyes would sparkle with that hint of impatience that looked so lovely on him.
tell me?’ Draco urged, his gaze snapping back to Pansy. She didn’t even have the decency to look contrite - simply smiled, eyes twinkling under a dark purple shimmer.
for Draco, and Draco was going to lose him again, and see him fly up into the skies looking for that sadistic spark of gold, and see him fall again, and this time he’d see in excruciatingly graphic detail as his arteries slashed in a red explosion; because this
Draco groaned. He would have liked to be subtle - not to mention names, specially with Hermione there to know the strain in his voice for what it was -, but everyone was being too fucking dense, slow-minded and so naively trusting, like the friends they’d allowed to play weren’t known for their recklessness, like they hadn’t been bloody sorted into a House that
to balance it, because his words, when he wasn’t careful, all spoke too much of love, he added with a smile, ‘You just sound it sometimes.’
It made for the prettiest sight - and with Draco generously teasing his prostate the unpleasantness from the stretch seemed to slip off Harry’s mind. All of him was eager and confident, thrusting back as Draco scissored his fingers wider, applied a bit more lube - partially for the lewd sounds, impossibly graphic in the quiet of the dorm - and added a third one. And he was trying to be careful, he was, but he ached so
And Harry had wanted to invite him. Willing to give him a chance - because he might not fully understand him but he
'Are you going already?' he asked. When he properly looked at Harry, his smile grew infinitely more amused. 'I dare say, the colour looks better on you than it does on Lovegood.'
‘I would have thought - if it was in fact one of you, of course - that you knew breaking into classrooms is strictly forbidden. And to leave this… this… blatant proof, is what it is, that the school’s conduct has been disrespected is beyond disgraceful. Disappointed, I tell you! Beyond disappointed, I am. Alas, the only reason I will not choose to investigate further is that nothing has been stolen. In fact,’ he brandished the dusty helmet in his hand again, ‘The mysterious trespasser has only added to what was here before,' he shook his head, floundered around the room, 'By Merlin's beard, in my days, thieves used to
him - made Draco shudder. He did reckon, though, from a practical view, that any blowjob he’d give in that state would be subpar. Enthusiasm would only get him so far, after all. He set out to undo Harry’s jeans and tug them midtigh, then the same with his underwear. Harry’s dick bobbed up unceremoniously, flushed a lovely red, urgent and begging for attention. Draco very primly kept his hands on Harry’s hips.
‘So you’ve said,’ Harry wheezed. Growing frustrated from the soft touches, he sought Draco’s mouth. Draco denied him, ducking down instead to kiss the underside of his chin, where the skin was soft and neglected and purely his to mark.
'Alright, then,' Pansy placed a handful of sickles on the bartop, then linked her arm with Draco's, 'I guess we'll walk around as well.'
Harry was counting the vials of veritaserum. His eyes flittered to Draco only for a second before returning to the shelf, but Draco could see him smile to himself.
had a sexual fantasy about one of the professors; Sue and Finnigan were the only ones who’d ever tried anal sex - a round that was particularly difficult to get through, because Harry was
And, inevitably, revising every little touch, every little word Harry said. Trying to conjure as many moments of that night as possible, for it’d been the night Harry had kissed him in front of his friends, and smiled so warmly when Draco had told him they were dating - and hadn’t there been some talk of a flat in London? Murky, grey in his mind, some mention of it, a lingering clench in his heart… he really shouldn’t have drunk that much. He should
‘I told you I’d be good at it,’ Harry’s smile was teasing. ‘Now get your fucking hand away, it’s not like I’m coming twice.’
‘Oy, mate, why’d it take you so bloody long?’ Ron said in a sorry excuse of a murmur once Draco had reached the circle of boys. Draco didn’t answer, didn’t even deem them a glance. Pace brisk, he ignored them, and went down to the comfort of the dungeons.
And still, when Harry stood to get a shot with Neville and Hermione, he promptly followed. Stumbled behind them, feeling each shaky step wounding his dignity, because his heart was hopelessly strung to Harry, and his urge to impress was too, and Pansy’s words were still ringing in his ears.
Of course it didn't. How could it? How could any lame, sorry trick ease Harry's nightmares? Solve his insomnia, appease his running thoughts - no, nothing short of leaving the bed entirely could do that. Nothing except for cold air and laughter and liquor.
Harry just nodded against his shoulder, more focused on following Draco's touch. At this point, Draco had to keep a vice like grip on his hip with his free hand to make sure he didn't topple off the sink.
‘I wasn’t aware there’d be so many answers, though,’ said Draco, ‘Who knew you were all so well versed in sex.’
- because perhaps Harry had seen the hunger in him, and toyed with it for his own amusement. What could be more entertaining than the pathetic Draco Malfoy hoping for a chance with the unattainable Potter?
'Please, Draco, you'd be going anyway to spy on him, what even is the difference?' Pansy's expression seemed fully unimpressed, and Draco felt himself shrink under her expectant gaze.
; their chests were plastered together, bleeding heat into each other; their lips moving in slick slides of saliva, Harry's parted open so Draco could flick his tongue between them, just to taste, just in honour of his past self, who'd thought about doing it a million times.
, with her ginger hair and resolute eyes and feminine features, had caught his eye; that she was the one Harry looked at, while Draco loitered in the background, begging to be seen; hated that her arms had been around him, that their lips had met; that Harry still probably thought about her, and had her face in his fantasies, while Draco had never thought about anyone else but him, or fallen asleep with anyone else’s name on his lips.
, which was incredibly rich seeing as Draco had wanted to do it since first year, but Draco was surely not going to complain.
Hermione glanced at him from the corner of her eye. She didn’t seem at all pleased to see him, which Draco thought was only fair. He wasn’t much happy to be there either.
That surely wasn’t what Draco had expected. He’d have guessed the unfamiliarity of the experience would have softened his erection, even despite how aroused he’d looked, how wanton and pink as he swallowed around his cock… but the thought that Harry had been so desperate that he couldn’t resist waiting, that he’d taken himself in hand as he sucked Draco off, that maybe he hadn’t even bothered to unbutton his slacks and simply palmed himself through the fabric, frantic and red-eyed and so utterly lustful... that was too perfect and too unlikely for Draco to actually consider.
It honestly was the most preposterous concept for a party that Draco had ever heard of and, if only Potter wasn’t on the other side of that door, Draco would never be standing on this side of it.
He didn’t, in any sense. At least, he didn’t in explicit words. In brave words. Instead, he inched a little closer, resting his forehead against Harry’s, and murmured in masked levity:
- except for the old Slytherins, it seemed. How disgraceful of the Chosen one to keep such a closed mind, honestly; to listen to stereotypes, to simply assume that none of them had changed, that none of them could be repentant, desperate to make amends, to shake his hand, to even hold it…
'What've you done with the young Weasley? I mean, I already know you're a virgin,' Draco saw Harry's little expression of embarrassment, and he went on with a smirk, 'Which is perfectly fine, but it makes me wonder how far you want to
It made it feel like the dancefloor was just for them. Like they were alone in the dark hall, swaying to the music.
Alicia said, ‘Never have I ever been in love’. Hermione and Ron were the first to drink, with saccharine smiles that were frankly sickening. Draco considered not drinking, but it felt like such a blatant lie, such a ridiculous pretense - he’d been in love since he was eleven, after all - that he ended up almost emptying his glass and ignoring the mildly questioning looks he got. There was a beat, Fletchley drank with his eyes trained on the table and his cheeks red, and, lastly, in almost silent agreement, and looking at everyone but each other, Harry and Ginny drank at the same time.
He kissed Harry’s temple, not really to tease but because he felt like he’d go absolutely mental if he didn’t. Harry fluttered under the soft touch, sending him something that was much too heated to be a proper glare. With a smug smirk, Draco noticed that Harry’s knuckles had gone white on the booth seat.
