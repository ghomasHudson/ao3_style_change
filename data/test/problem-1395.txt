“Hello Harry.” Hagrid said bending down to Harry’s level and smiling at him. “Yer a wizard, same as your parents; and Hogwarts is a special school for wizards and witches to learn.”
Draco signed Potter’s discharge papers in his usual flourish, he yawned and looked at his watch two hours until the end of this shift. He had a day off tomorrow from both St. Mungo’s and London Grace and planned to do absolutely nothing unless of course his planned worked and he could get Potter to go get a drink with him tomorrow night. He knocked on the door not wanting to walk in on Potter being indecent. “I have your discharge papers, I just need you to sign them.” He said handing Potter a self-inking quill.
After ten minutes and the right knee was perfect, and he looked at his watch and saw that it was 1730 and figured it was getting close to dinner and figured he’d go and put some more burn paste on Harry’s back before hand and talk to the child about tomorrow. He wasn’t going to mention Andromeda or Vivienne yet. “I’m going to go check on Harry and make sure he eats dinner. Grant, I hope you have a good evening. I’ll hopefully see you tomorrow.”
“Two of us.” Draco said winking at Harry who looked confused like he was the first time, Olivia a nurse friend of his, took him here. “Relax would you, there is a speakeasy downstairs.” Draco whispered to the tense Auror.
Kieran saw Bellatrix emerge from the elevator from getting her bag from the staff room and raise her eye at the obnoxious display of pinks scrubs which he understood if that pink were to get any brighter, he believed they’d be neon. He signed the last piece of paperwork and linked his arms with his own. “Ignore the pink.”
Ron winced at the mention of his mother. “You three are the only ones I’ve told, Padma and I had the first healer’s appointment yesterday and I just couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. We planned to announce it on Friday during our usual weekly get together at the Burrow. So, can you please act surprised when Padma and I announce it?” He asked not wanting his wife to be mad at him for announcing it earlier than expected.
“Thank you.” Harry muttered grabbing Lily, the dragon plush, he had officially named her after his mother. He liked the name when Regulus said it and found it suited the dragon plush. He reached for the edge of the blanket and pulled it up around him. “Sleep well.” He hoped he didn’t have to bother the nice adults during the night.
Draco shook his head what started out as a very boring shift had soon turned into a rather enjoyable shift. He chewed at his lip watching the Auror trying to get out of his robes, only for him to his in pain.
“That’s better I thought you were trying to give me grey hair.” Harry complained ticking him the room being filled with Teddy’s laughter, what Harry wouldn’t give to be Teddy’s age and the only thing he had to worry about was rather or not a certain blonde Weasley would also be there.
Bellatrix came into the room seeing that Harry was fast asleep in the bed and that Kieran was dealing with paperwork. “I’ve placed Harry’s lunch order, I figured with his size the only thing he might be able to get down is a protein shake, along with whatever nutrient potions you deem appropriate.”
Harry didn’t feel the usual pain he felt when a Healer reinflated his lung, it had to have been the pain potion and not Draco’s healing abilities. Merlin, he almost had to admit that Malfoy was easily one of the better healers that had ever attended to his injuries. “That surprisingly doesn’t hurt.” Harry admitted gritting his teeth like that statement physically hurt to say.
Harry sighed and buried his face in his hands he could only nod at Kieran’s two questions. “Yes, to both.” The words were barely above a whisper.
“Headmaster Dumbledore my husband worked hard for his degree and I would think as a Headmaster of an esteemed institution such as Hogwarts would understand the respect of one’s title. Please use either Healer Reid or Doctor Reid seeing as Healer Reid went on to study at the University of Oxford and earned his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree so he can practice both in the Muggle World and The Magical World.” Bellatrix was annoyed with Dumbledore basically insulting her husband’s education by using a title he’d use to refer to a male student at Hogwarts still receiving their education.
Bellatrix sighed at the mention of the nickname that he and Sirius were so fond of calling her growing up, her own husband had called her that a few times on accident. She didn’t mind it so much when it came from her husband, but when it came from the cousin it annoyed her. She took the potions back from Grant and floated the note into the trash watching as the note shredded itself into a bunch of tiny pieces.
Draco listening to Harry intently his auto quill was writing down all his complaints. “Wait Neville Longbottom is an Auror?” Out of everyone from his class the last person he would think would become an Auror was Neville; he always remembered that Neville was good with Herbology. He walked over to the cabinet looking for the potion to help with the aftereffects of the Cruciatus Curse. He grabbed the small phial and glided back to the bed. “Here this will help with shocks going through your body.” It would also help him examine the Auror easier but he left that part off. “I’d drink it in one go, it tastes pretty terrible.”
Ron shook his head glad that Harry was getting back into the dating pool. “I look forward to hearing more about this date, I too have news of my own.” He said grabbing his coffee order and paying. He sat down beside Harry. “Padma and I are expecting.”
“I love you to mother.” He said getting up a dusting off his robes. “I will certainly let you know how drinks go.” He said honestly navigating his way back to the fireplace. He stumbled into his own living room and nearly on his arse had it not been for a house elf.
Anyway enough of my rambling enjoy the new chapter and as always thank you so much for all the comments, kudos, and bookmarks. :)
Kieran gently grabbed the bottom hem of Harry’s jumper and gently pulled it up over Harry’s head. He felt rage rise in his chest upon seeing all the of the bruises and burns. He grabbed the hospital gown and helped Harry’s injured arm into the armhole. He saw Harry struggle with the belt he was wearing due to the wrist brace and grabbed the belt and pulled it through the pant loops. He helped Harry off the bed and the pants just fell without the aid of the belt. He could see the lack of nutrition every place he looked. He resisted the urge to sigh or curse at the sheer amount of visible damage on the child’s skin.
“I don’t want you or your spawn anywhere near my house, Snivellus---” Sirius was saying dangerously, his eyes black and frightening. His voice was laced with malice, and his breath was coming in quick, angry bursts. Even from here, Harry could see a red mark across Snape’s face.
“Yes,” Draco’s mother replied, her voice deceptively cool and even. “What does Draco have to say about all this?”
His mum must have known that Lucius wanted to see Draco, because all she did was greet him briefly and give him a small peck him on the cheek.
He was on his knees, alternatively rocking Jonathan and staring blankly at his best friend and lover’s body. He knew he had but moments if he wanted to take his son home. Only a few minutes until the damn mutt came to collect his godson.
who? “I like you, Snape. Anyone who can render my mother speechless is alright in my book. Welcome to the Junior Order!”
too much fun with this. “And Dad thinks everything is too soppy, so he’s hardly an unbiased source.”
So welcome to the "All That's Ours" 'verse! This is going to be a four book series, with a possible prequel in the works. I'm super, super proud of this baby, and I hope you find as much joy in reading it as I do in writing it! Some warnings before you proceed:
“Morning Master Teddy, I made chocolate waffles for breakfast.” He said placing the plate of waffles covered in chocolate syrup and whip cream in front of the child. “Harry is taking a shower, he’ll probably be down in a moment.” The elf heard the shower turn off. He went to cabinet to fix Harry a quick bowl of yogurt and berries.
So, Harry was to be placed with a nice Muggle family far away from the Wizarding World until he turned eleven in case someone was to come looking for him to finish the job. When all along that nice Muggle family was abusing him.
Harry laughed knowing that Hermione didn’t have a Dark Mark, but the person he was meeting up with later did. “No, she attended Koldovstoretz. Ron Hermione doesn’t have a Dark Mark, I think Neville would know if his future wife has one of those.”
“Wait what?” Harry questioned pulling him wrist back from the healer wondering how they were family. His parents had died in a car accident and he was sent to his Aunt Petunia due to having no other living family.
She had said almost ten years ago that the Dursley’s were terrible muggles and that Harry should have been placed with anyone else and now ten years later when it was finally time for the boy to attend Hogwarts, she learns that he was admitted to St. Mungo’s after Dumbledore sent Hagrid of all people to talk to Vernon and Petunia about the lack of response to the acceptance letter and school list.
“That dragon is an Antipodean Opaleye. They are usually found in New Zealand and occasionally Australia. Most Witches and Wizards consider them to be the most beautiful dragon since their scales have a pearlescent sheen and their eyes are multicolored that glitter in the light and unlike some other dragons isn’t particularly aggressive.” Regulus explained watching as the child held onto every word and taking a mental note of the politeness.
Dumbledore was feeling annoyed that they kept reciting the same things repeatedly about documentation. He needed to get them on his side so they wouldn’t go looking for James, Lily, or Sirius wills. “Was Harry abused? If those muggles abused him, I’m going to have a serious conversation with them regarding child abuse. Also, if they abused Harry, I know that the Weasley’s, his soulmate’s family, would gladly take him in. I know Ron and Harry would become fast friends.”
Harry wanted to curse at this nice Malfoy, his brain was sending shockwaves down his body every time Draco touched him. Merlin, he needed to get these stupid ideas out of head before he said something he might regret, and by regret ask the Slytherin on a date. He felt like a stupid love struck teenager and not at all like the twenty-five-year-old man that he was.
Harry looked confused for several seconds trying to process an adult asking him what he wanted to eat. Usually, he didn’t get anything for dinner, or he was able to eat the last roll that had gone cold. Occasionally when they weren’t watching he would let a can of fruit expire and eat the can of fruit when the Dursley’s were otherwise occupied with something. Fruit was the one thing Dudley never touched and Vernon rarely touched. “Alright.” He muttered he had never had Shepherd’s Pie before, but he still didn’t fully trust the nice man in green.
Sirius snorted before turning away from his hand and looking at Harry, his eyes dancing. “If Moony ever stopped being a boring old swot he’d know more,” he confided. “I’ve been listening to Snape’s conversations with Minerva and the like---”
Draco’s mum gasped, Rose’s braids falling apart in her hands as she moved to grab a throw pillow, chucking it at Severus’ head. So they were at that stage then. Draco very quickly got up off the couch and moved to the side of the room so he could avoid projectiles.
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Weasley,” Rose said to the woman apologetically, taking a cue from Lupin and her bright red hair to surmise the woman’s name. “I hope I didn’t insult you. I was just surprised. Dad doesn’t really keep anything from me, so I just assumed… Well it won’t happen again.”
Rosaline’s brow furrowed as she surveyed the room. Eventually, her gaze landed on Harry, and a jolt of electricity ran down Harry’s spine as they looked at one another properly for the first time. Her eyes were bright green, with thick lashes, and while they had been bright and laughing mere moments ago, when Rosaline looked at Harry, her gaze was sad, almost desperate. Her throat bobbed as she swallowed hard. Harry found himself unable to look away, caught up in the oddest sense of deja vu, and she was the one to break eye contact as she turned back to address the rest of the Order.
- For those that may have forgotten, Richard was a Muggle boy who kissed Diana Fitzgerald at the playpark. What the *fuck* Richard?
,” Rose retorted, pushing his hand away and crossing her arms. “I’d think you’d be more worried if I wasn’t. And I actually
“Must you, Rose?” he groused, glaring half-heartedly at his daughter. McGonagall covered her mouth with one hand, her eyes crinkling at the corners. “I have a reputation to maintain.”
“Maybe you’re going about it the wrong way,” Minerva wondered, her brow furrowing. “You’re coming to him first, giving him the chance to refuse.”
“But maybe it’s for the best,” her dad continued, taking a sip from his glass and grimacing. “There would hardly have been a welcome wagon waiting for you there.”
Until he could implement his exit strategy, Draco had a role to play, and he knew it. He mostly managed by limiting his most distasteful behavior to people he actually disliked for reasons other than blood-status-- the Weasleys and Granger and Longbottom and, of course,
“So, as some of you may know, visions aren’t always perfectly clear, but I’ve gotten pretty good at dissecting them. This one is confusing, but I’ve been able to glean enough that it should be useful in amending the Order’s strategy.”
Draco would have defended Severus had he not been so relieved. But after the insult, Lucius had dismissed him with a wave of his hand, and Draco didn’t want to push his luck. He bid his father goodbye and hastened back to his room.
“She’s got the Royal Sight, Sirius,” the boy said, pointing to the wand that Rose held in her hand. “I mean, look at her wand. If we were making tactical decisions based on Trelawney’s ‘visions,’ then you might have a point, but since she has the Sight--” he gave a low whistle. “Well, then we’ve got a hell of an edge over the other side if we use the information right.”
Right now she was smirking at him, having just won the first game with Draco’s new deck of cards. Draco idly wondered if this is how she looked when she was young, when she was the youngest of three sisters who loved each other fiercely. He’d only seen a few old photographs of her then, but while her hair had been shorter and her face a bit rounder, the mischievous glint in her blue eyes was the same. Draco loved it, and he loved her.
5) I do not appreciate Sirius Black, and if he were not fictional, I would find him and punch him in the face. While the fic is not outright bashing him, it will include some negative characterization.
Severus held his son to his chest, running his shaking hand over the boy’s shaggy black mop of hair, as he stared at Lily’s body, willing her to get up. Willing her to come home.
to stop you?” Snape asked incredulously, eyebrows raised, and Harry had to wonder if Snape was more affronted by his daughter’s secrecy or her seeming lack of faith in his thwarting skills. “You do know that I---”
Her dad unbuttoned his jacket and draped it over their leather couch. “It means that Albus, the old fool, will finally tell him about the Order, thank Merlin.”
“Rose Snape,” Minerva laughed and eased Rose off of her to grip her shoulders before looking her up and down with those flinty eyes of hers. “I think you’ve gotten taller since I saw you last. Prettier too.” Rose laughed and scrunched up her nose as the professor tapped it twice.
Rose snorted (somewhere in Wiltshire, Rose guessed, Narcissa winced, sensing that a young lady was acting distinctly unladylike-- poor lamb). One of the twins, the one sitting on the floor at Ron’s feet with a small scar bisecting his right eyebrow, grinned up at her in response.
Shaking himself, Draco stood up to help his mother gather her things. He was spending the night at the Cottage so that he could go with Rose to the train station, since it was her first time, but his mother had to get back to the Manor before it got too late.
But his mum didn’t know everything that there was under the sun, despite her own protestations of the fact, so she didn’t understand that he’d needed the conversation about fathers to end where she’s started it.
“Simple,” Snape replied haughtily, flicking a microscopic piece of lint off of his coat. “He attempted to frighten me.”
Harry snorted as Sirius gifted Remus a rather rude hand gesture before slamming his cards on the table. He smiled, all white teeth.
“Well, that’s understandable,” Remus said, a pensive look on his face. “He’s probably the most at risk out of the whole Order, being our only spy and all.”
“How was my daughter’s chess strategy this time, Draco?” Rose’s dad asked lightly, sauntering over to peer over her---
“That last one was always one of her favorites,” Severus murmured after Draco put the sheet music away. “She never loved the musical, but she adored that song.”
“Love you too, Snappy,” Draco smiled, burrowing under the covers so he could press his cold feet onto Rose’s ankles, making her squeal and flick his ear with her free hand. Laughing, he turned so he was laying on his back, eyes on the ceiling, and within moments Rose followed suit.
“Spawn?” Snape hissed, his voice slick with hatred. “Is that what you call a normal fifteen-year-old girl, Black? Spawn?”
“Delegating tasks that you cannot hope to accomplish on your own is a pragmatic way to tackle problems, Mother!” Draco cried, glaring good-naturedly at the old elf who shrugged his shoulders by way of apology. “Mindy is a much more effective spy than I could ever be.”
But the story was interrupted when a harried Minerva McGonagall stepped through the fireplace. Rose’s face lit up at the sight of the professor.
“I’m sorry, Dad,” she murmured, letting her elbow touch his. “I know that if it was up to you, I’d be allowed to go.”
(Rose had a preference for older musicals, and Draco had to prod her into letting him play anything from
“You had a vision?” He demanded, quickly kneeling down so that he was eye-level with his daughter. Dumbledore suddenly looked more alert as he focused his gaze on the Snape girl, his blue eyes sharp, while McGonagall began to look grave. “What of?”
certainly not going to doubt a Royal vision, and Dumbledore clearly won’t, which, ah probably matters more. Since I’m not an Order member. Like you. Wait. You’re an Order member. How old are you?”
“Minerva!” She crowed, scrambling out of her seated position to embrace the older woman. She smiled into Minerva’s robes as the woman huffed with mock indignation at the sudden welcome.
Lucius smiled and beckoned Draco forward with an outstretched arm. As he complied, Draco noted how his father pushed a paper underneath a red book on his desk with the other hand.
“Oh, phooey,” Mrs. Weasley huffed loudly. She was somehow making setting the table seem like a battle cry, slamming the plates down with all her strength before turning on Snape, sporting a frigid stare and poking her finger to his chest. “You, young man---”
or a book equally less macabre for that night. There was enough demented shit going on with the war. The two of them didn’t really need to read a psychological horror story about a man who the devil drove insane. It hit a bit too close to home.
Harry might have imagined it--- he certainly convinced himself that he did later on--- but in that moment, it looked like Snape’s hard eyes softened as he smirked.
“Should we--” Ron began forlornly, before shaking his head in resignation, a deeply depressed shadow passing over his face as he stared longingly at the couch for a moment. “We should, shouldn’t we?”
Rose smiled sadly before walking over to press a kiss to Severus’ cheek. Draco had to look away. He used to be able to look at his father the way Rose looked at Severus, before Lucius became so convinced of his only son’s inherent weakness. Draco missed those times, when he could call Lucius
Severus was supposedly a Death Eater, one who boasted a fearsome reputation. The Dark Lord was dead. The Ministry would undoubtedly hold trials against Riddle’s followers. Albus had promised that he would testify for Severus, but Merlin knew how long the hearings would take.
“Hello, Father,” Draco replied, carefully assessing the man in front of him. Lucius looked to be in a good mood, but that could mean a multitude of things, given his current loyalties. But Draco, not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, relaxed slightly. “What can I do for you?”
“C’mon, Rosie,” he whined, laying his forehead on her shoulder. “You have many other talents. Singing. Charms. I’ve heard you even managed to hang the moon.”
“Seventeen,” Draco replied, ignoring the warning. “Let me wait until I’m seventeen. Please, Father. I’ll be more help, then.”
The door opened, the world exploding in a rush of boxes and baby toys, but Lily only knew one thing.
Harry sighed and nodded as the two of them ran after the girl, bumping into each other all the way. Regardless of their rather clumsy and expletive-ridden chase, Ron and Harry managed to catch up to whoever she was just in time to see her in an argument with Fred and George. The twins had only been listening at the door last time Harry checked, but now they stood like sentries, their backs to the kitchen door.
“Your idiot father decided it would be a good idea to contact the actual Black heir,” Minerva told Rose, absent-mindedly smoothing Rose’s hair out of her face. “He wrote his old friend Narcissa Malfoy and very innocently asked about the state of Grimmauld Place. Which got Narcissa to ask a few pointed questions to the Ministry’s Inheritance Office about procuring it, which in turn spooked the Order’s liaison and forced Albus to run damage control. The official story is now that Number 12 was destroyed in a fight between the two Black brothers and was made Unplottable because of the amount of Dark Magic still in the foundations of the house. Very helpful for Order security, actually, which is the reason your father will give at the next meeting, but also very worrying for a one Sirius Black.”
Not that she was unaware of what an arse he was at school. Even Dad sometimes got put out from Draco’s comments, and he had a rather high tolerance for bullshit. Rose was too intelligent to ignore the possibility of how utterly bigoted those comments probably were. Never mind that they had drunk Muggle soda and played Muggle board games all summer. Never mind that they had listened to every Eternal album on repeat and could recite all the words to any Disney movie ever made. That was Cottage-Draco, and even though Cottage-Draco was the
Rose smirked and let the conversation lull into silence. That was the best thing about Draco--- sitting in silence was never awkward with him. Probably because they had met before either could do more than eat, cry, and shit, but Rose thought there was more to it than just being used to each other. Draco was less a friend and more a piece of her, a partner that she understood and who understood her. It was good, what they had. It always had been.
“Right then,” Rose took a deep breath. “I hope you enjoyed Dad and I’s little schtick. I promise he’s usually not that nice, so don’t worry, your previous assessment of him as a big, menacing arsehole can still stand if you want it to.”
This whole installment will be in the editing stages by the end of this year. I was going to keep this chapter in my pocket for a little longer, but I thought we could all use a boost.
“Rose,” Draco’s urgent voice startled her out of her reverie. “I just heard Severus open the front door.”
In the corner of the kitchen, Harry thought he saw McGonagall smile triumphantly, but that was probably a trick of the light. Snape, on the other hand, looked incredibly concerned.
“You’re brill,” Rose told him seriously, once she’d gotten her thoughts in order. “I really needed to just… sit for a moment. Thank you.”
. “You’re an utterly horrible embarrassment to me, your endlessly patient best mate, who has tried in vain for years to cultivate this useful skill within you.”
“Counted cards. It’s a way of keeping track of what card is where using memorization and logic. Very difficult to master, of course. I’m only a novice. But Severus learned from watching his father lose to a visitor at the local pub. And he taught himself.”
I am very much excited to begin this journey with all of you! Remember to leave a comment down below to tell me what you liked!
“Yes, of course,” Rose said, careful to remember what Jonathan still didn’t know. It wouldn’t do to make an enemy of a woman who was probably very important to her brother. “Basically, I Saw a few lines of text juxtaposed against… well, against the place everyone has been guarding. The text was moving pretty quickly through timelines, so I wasn’t sure at first if it was ours, but I was able to determine that this information is for
“Sit down this instant,” Lucius said softly, his gray eyes betraying hints of fury. “Do not force my wand.”
Silence. In Mrs. Weasley’s case, scandalized silence. Sirius looked like he was about to die. Snape was the one to break it as he huffed and ran a hand through his hair. Harry expected him to rage, but instead the man only looked petulant.
“She was already feeding the Order information,” Harry’s professor said. “It seemed only right that she visit Headquarters.”
Yet, Draco was shaking when his hand grasped the cool silver doorknob to his father’s study. Taking a deep, steadying breath, Draco opened the door and stepped through the threshold before he could lose his nerve.
Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to go upstairs, ignoring Sirius whispering for him to come back. He grabbed his towel from the top landing where he’d left it, and headed to finally take that shower. As he undressed, he looked at his ankle, which was as good as new. No swelling at all. Harry thought again about the red mark on Snape’s face and winced.
I am SO SO SORRY for the late update. I have had a lot on my plate recently (including way too many WIPs) so this fic hasn't been updated in months. I am finally figuring out a better schedule for my writing, so hopefully I will become a more consistent updater in the future. Thank you so much for your patience. Lots of love!
Rose heard her father shift forward, and she opened her mouth to stop him, but before she could get a word out, The-Boy-Assumed-To-Be-Ron-Weasley-Until-Further-Notice cut her off.
Rose shrugged good-naturedly and dragged Minerva over to one of the two armchairs in the living room, grinning at her father as he snapped his book shut while glaring at their guest. She herself plunked down at Minerva’s feet with crossed legs before leaning back against her legs.
The two of them fell asleep like that, hands tight in each other’s, and if Draco had any dreams that night, none of them were important enough to remember.
“Oh, I’ve heard about that project!” A short, dark haired girl exclaimed as she walked into the room, a taller redheaded girl hot on her heels. “Is it true you have to pick out the topics in October even though you only present in April?”
Harry was headed down the hall when he heard a bang and a flurry of whispers from down the stairs. He was going to ignore it and go shower, really he was, but he had had the most boring few weeks of his life. A peek couldn’t hurt--- in fact it might help him find out all the secrets the Order was keeping from him.
Ginny Weasley huffed out a laugh and even Harry Potter (it was easier to think of him as Harry Potter, as The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Drive-Draco-Up-The-Fucking-Wall, than as just
“What ever happened to relaxing summer holidays?” Harry muttered as he slipped out of the room. Ron still hadn’t stirred. Good.
“Not just a spy, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley told him firmly, but not unkindly. “He’s a father, too. A father who is terribly worried about his only child. A child who I might as well have called neglected. Like Severus wouldn’t move heaven and earth for that girl of his...” Mrs. Weasley trailed off, pained.
Lucius smiled viciously, nodding in satisfaction. “It is good to see that my tutelage has not gone to waste. You are correct. It would do no good for further negativity to be associated with our family. Your dirty-blooded godfather brings us enough shame as it is.”
Mrs. Weasley gave a shaky laugh, gripping his left hand, which had been absentmindedly tracing the grain of the table, in her right. She shook her head.
“One day, I pray,” Narcissa sighed morosely. “I will say something critical and you will not turn around and prove the point.”
They were sitting in their living room when the Floo roared to life, Rose’s dad’s long legs spread out on their raggedy sofa and Rose laying on her stomach, tracing patterns on their hardwood floor as he read aloud from
“Come then, my children,” Sirius crowed, slinging an arm around Harry’s shoulder and hauling him onto an overstuffed couch to sit next to him. “Let Grandpapa Sirius tell you his tale.”
explained the twitchy mouth. Times like this made Draco wonder if dear old dad was on the right track with the whole homicide thing. Rose had no right involving him in World War III. He’d been perfectly nice to her all day and only went on a rant about Gryffindor favoritism
“It would be a bad influence. We don’t need any more Slytherins lurking about. Bad enough we have Snivelly.”
He’d managed to delay the inevitable for two more years. He’d be able to stave off running for two more years. Until then, Draco would parade as the model son. A son Lucius Malfoy could be proud of.
But it would break his mother’s heart to learn the truth, Draco knew that deep in his once-broken bones. And Draco refused to be the cause of his mother’s pain. Narcissa was clever and sharp and loved with her whole heart and Draco would not ruin the few bits of happiness she held so closely to her chest. So he took another deep breath and smiled even more widely.
“Damn you, Dragon,” Rose groaned as she lost her rook to her god-brother's knight. “I told you to go easy on me, you prat.” She glared at him, but her awful excuse for a best mate didn’t react in the slightest.
“After learning the damage to his left wrist, I convinced Harry to let me perform an in-depth full body health scan on him to check for other signs of abuse.” Kieran said grabbing the parchment and making a copy for Vivienne and Andromeda. “As you can see from his health scan, he has severe injuries which Harry confirms were caused by child abuse.
“Seven works for me and I’ll text you the address.” Draco said placing the signed copy of the discharge order in his chart. “Do be careful, your ribs are still healing.” He warned as he showed Harry out of the exam rooms and out of St. Mungo’s A&E department.
Kieran let out of sigh of relief happy to be able to mark the no sexual abuse box. The abuse he was seeing was horrible he didn’t even want to think what would have happened if Vernon made good on that promise. It was clear the muggles hated everything this child ever did.
Teddy sighed and slid off the couch and trailed after his ‘father.’ “How long will it take for your ribs to feel better?” The child asked crawling into his bed so that Harry could tuck him in for the night.
“I don’t see why I would need to provide that. I am Harry’s Magical Guardian; he was placed with muggles. I or a Hogwarts Head of House will take over Magical Guardianship of the muggle child until they reach seventeen. Since Harry has yet to be sorted that makes me his Magical Guardian.”
“Mate If I were you I’d be checking Hermione for a Dark Mark.” Ron said looking at Neville. “So, who is she, anyone we’d know?” Ron asked turning his attention back to Harry wondering who the girl was that managed to catch his eye.
Regulus was feeling angry and on the more emotional side so best to question her in private instead in front of everyone.
He was a professional and this was his job, and this was his wing and if a Mediwitch was off the rails in her behavior he wanted to know about it. But at the same time Merlin it hurt so bad. This was Lily’s child, the same Lily who loved his husband like a brother. The same James who stood up for his relationship with Severus when Peter Pettigrew decided to go against his friends and make Severus’s life a living hell. He balled his fist and relaxed his fist. He saw the women in all pink gossiping with another staff member.
“I know love.” He whispered softly brushing back a stray piece of silver hair. He understood exactly what she was feeling because he was feeling the exact same feelings she was.
“It went well, I’m going to head to bed.” Harry said heading to his master bedroom for some Dreamless Sleep and downed the phial. He knew from first year potions that you weren’t supposed to take them after having alcohol but he didn’t care he needed sleep. He pulled out his contacts sticking them in their container by his bed and flopped his head against the pillow.
Adrien was a tall man with brown hair and brown eyes. “I have a moment but make it fast. I don’t usually have A&E Healers hunt me down personally so it must be bad.”
Harry sighed knowing there was several other issues lingering so he knew that he’d be getting sedated later to get everything fixed. He knew there were burns on his back from the fireplace poker and various bruises that were multicolor. “My wrist is pretty bad huh?” He knew his right wrist had been broken multiple times too.
She slid a black fingernail under the Ministry wax seal and opened the letter from Andromeda. She saw that Andy was working on finding the wills of James, Lily, or Sirius and would be coming to St. Mungo’s around 2pm to talk about everything. Bellatrix quickly scribbled that those times were perfect and sent the paper airplane note off to Regulus and tied her less glamorous response to the dark owl.
Harry raised an eyebrow at the question. “Vernon once threatened to show me what it meant to be a ‘pillow biter’ when he saw Draco’s name when I was around nine. But he never did anything. There were a lot of words like ‘fairy’ and ‘poof’ but never any touching outside of the whip and my bare butt.” Harry hurriedly said wanting to be done with this conversation.
“Shite!” Rose bolted upright, sweeping the old chess set into its box. Draco made a mad dash for their long-forgotten textbooks, grabbing quills and parchment out from his knapsack. They both arranged themselves and the mess of writing supplies on a nearby table, tripping over each other in their haste to act studious.
Her dad breathed deeply through his nose before taking the seat next to her, passing her some grated cheese from Mrs. Willow’s cart. That alone made Rose’s chest ache. That cheese was bloody expensive–– Dad had clearly been expecting her to be upset, must’ve been beyond stressed. And now Rose felt guilty, and she
Rose had spent years imagining what it would be like to finally meet her brother. In her daydreams, he was smiling, wet-eyed, as they clung to each other for dear life and their dad wiped away their happy tears with the pads of his thumbs. In her nightmares, Jonathan screamed at her, red-faced and furious, calling her a liar and a traitor and rejecting their father with pure hatred coloring his voice.
Ron Weasley had turned out to be, that the fact that Harry was still scowling darkly at her almost didn’t hurt one bit.
. It was an old favorite of his. Rose liked the story, too, of course, but she’d rather he’d chosen something like
When Rose’s dad walked into the sun room, Rose and Draco were in the middle of a rather riveting educational discussion about the care and keeping of flobberworms.
The second she had entered the kitchen, she’d begun speaking, her voice cutting through whatever argument the Order had been in the midst of loudly and clearly.
Harry bolted upright, breathing heavily. Sweat poured off of him as he ran a hand through his hair and tried to slow down his heart rate. Ron was still fast asleep, if the soft snoring under the mountain of quilts on the other side of the bedroom was any indication, but Harry didn’t think he’d be able to do the same for the rest of the night.
Severus almost dropped the baby in shock. Near his son’s temple, still raw and bleeding, was a lightning-shaped scar, one that reeked of magic so dark, Severus’ mark flared to life. He muttered a Summoning Spell to procure the wand he had let fall to the floor thoughtlessly when he had first seen the ruined nursery.
“You’ll do no such thing,” she snapped, breezing over to the Snapes from the corner of the room. She placed a thin hand on Rosaline’s shoulder. “Neither Rose or Severus did anything wrong. I invited her.”
- I have a very specific theory for how magic came to be and this AU literally started out as a way for me to write that theory out so get excited friends!!
Rose snorted and turned back to the Order, all of whom were still studying her as if she was a new exotic animal. The ginger from before and his twin both looked like Christmas had come early, and the boy next to Jonathan (she assumed he was Ron Weasley based on her father's information and Draco's long-winded rants, but she couldn't be completely sure) was looking at
In which Ron Weasley is brill, magical theory is discussed, and Rose talks too much without saying anything at all.
“We lost ours in 1642,” Ron said mournfully. “Bartholomew Thelonious Weasley tried to claim it for himself and ended up burning through the Gift and his own magical core in one fell swoop. And ours was wicked, too.”
Sirius looked at Snape’s daughter viciously, not even attempting to conceal his disdain as he continued, “I’ll throw them both out if they can’t abide by my rules.”
before closing her eyes and leaning back against his mum’s legs. Draco huffed out a quiet laugh, propping his head up on his knee to watch the show. The two of them had had this argument at least a dozen times, and while Draco was usually annoyed by it (especially when it happened during dinner, because Narcissa Malfoy had a bad habit of throwing things at Severus’ head when she was pissed, and when not using a wand, her aim was
Rose closed her eyes and centered herself, focusing on the steadfastness and purity of her father's love, before turning back to the four boys gaping at her.
“Sleep well, darling,” his mum whispered, cupping his face in one soft hand, “and take care of Rose. I’ll expect a full report of the Welcoming Feast by midnight tomorrow, do you understand me?”
Snape, dungeon bat extraordinaire, was a bloody father. As in, Severus Snape, the ugly, people-hating git, who had tormented countless children in his life, had an actual real life child.
Draco hummed and leaned his head on his mother’s shoulder, breathing deeply. She was wearing a new perfume, he noted, as he closed his eyes. She smelled like jasmine and vanilla and chamomile tea, and Draco felt at peace for the first time that day. When his mum was with him, Draco could pretend for a little while. He could pretend that he was in a normal family; that Draco and Narcissa were just waiting for his nice, normal father to come home from work and take them out to eat.
“Well there’s nothing else we can do in his study while you and Rose galavant around Robin Hood’s Bay,” Narcissa snorted indignantly, making Draco grin. “He refuses to drink anything I bring him. Why, last year, he binned a glass of the 1883 elf wine vintage I brought. He binned it, Draco! Can you imagine?”
That was all it took for her father, Severus bloody Snape, the man who struck fear in the hearts of Ministry workers, Death Eaters, and eleven-year-olds alike, to morph into the most irritating mother hen on the face of the earth.
“The Gifts were just myths!” Hermione argued, sitting down next to Ron (really, really next to Ron, Merlin, Draco was right, how were these two
Fred: “She’s already an actual Order member, George, what the fuck does she need a Junior Order for, what even
“I just don’t want you to die if you can avoid it,” her dad complained. “You know we can’t afford a funeral.”
up his Death Easter arse before the man was sweeping out of the room. Snape shouted “Snape Cottage!” as he Flooed away, and Harry failed to suppress a shiver at the thought of Snape’s home. Somehow, the prick even made the idea of a cottage sound dark and terrible.
She saw Sev’s deep black eyes smiling at her. She saw the little boy at the swingset, naming the species of wildflowers around them as she laid her head on his shoulder. She saw the man who had kissed her and entered her like she was a blessing, like she was something special and good. She saw the father of her babies, mouth proud, cheeks wet, and hands shaking as he counted their tiny fingers and toes.
Harry and Ron were sprawled together on the sofa, taking a well deserved nap during the weekly Order meeting when the fireplace roared to life, startling them both into falling off the couch and onto the floor with a flurry of groggy curses and moans. A girl with dark hair rushed out, nearly tripping over her own feet in her rush to get to the kitchen, though it was clear she had only the vaguest idea of where the room was. Blearily, Harry watched as she struggled with indecision before her eyes lit up and she turned down the correct corridor, satisfaction lighting up her delicate features.
, in fact, have something to say,” Severus insisted, leaning forward in his seat. “Because I know for a fact that Draco is a good, decent lad who respects his godfather and would
James is betrayed— in more ways than one. Lily shares her secret. Severus has to make the hardest choice of his life.
Rose made the mistake of finding this witty. She tried to keep the giggles threatening to spill out of her between her lips, but it was like she hadn’t even bothered. Soon, the two of them were laughing like mad, Draco’s head falling into her lap and her hand finding his hair.
She’d thought that the end of it, but then he silently spelled the rest of her food bright pink. Rose swore loudly, but smiled inwardly as he smirked, satisfied with his revenge. They’d have to keep talking about the situation, of course. But he was so clearly worried and so obviously stressed that she turned the conversation towards the merits of eating Transfigured food happily.
“Your brother had an…” her dad trailed off and sighed, eyes murky. “Incident, let’s say. He used some underage magic to repel some Dementors who just so happened to be drifting around Privet Drive.”
), the way Rose’s mouth twitched as it continued made him think that there might be some new developments this time around.
“I’ll have another, extremely valid and helpful reason to share,” her father finished succinctly, smiling at her deduction. But then his face clouded, and he leaned back into the sofa, its springs creaking loudly. “But it was for nothing, I suppose. That was my trump card, and he still won’t let you visit once.”
Yet, in all her imaginings, Rose had somehow never considered Jonathan looking at her without any hint of recognition, had never thought to contemplate what it would mean to look at her brother and feel like they were strangers. They’d shared a womb, for Merlin’s sake, and yet she only knew the bits and pieces she could glean from her heart-sick father and the nonsensical ramblings of her notably biased best friend. Rose wanted to scream, to rage, to throw things. But her father was all but quivering with unease as she told the Order that she’d had a vision, and she knew that this wasn’t the time for a tantrum-- no matter how cathartic and deserved it might be.
Carefully so as not to alert the other people to his presence, Harry went down the stairs, pleased to hear that the whispers were becoming clearer and to see that no one had yet thought to turn off the downstairs lights. But when he was about five steps from the landing, he saw who it was. Frankly, it was a little disappointing.
(Like anyone who actually did would have invented an entire holiday dedicated to the anniversary of Madonna’s
This boy was not Jonathan Snape, not really, not yet. He was Harry Potter, godson to Sirius Black and Remus Lupin’s favorite student. Rose’s dad had cultivated a negative relationship with Harry on purpose and took every opportunity to push him away. There was no reason for Harry to
“The Black King was my champion, you cretin,” she declared loudly, giggling as he shot her a venomous glare, rubbing his arse. “I am afraid you must pay for your crime.” Rose leapt on top of Draco and began to tickle him mercilessly.
“I am,” Draco replied simply, clearly struggling not to grin as he plucked her doomed rook off the chessboard. “It isn’t my fault you’re shite at chess.”
“Don’t you worry, Jonathan,” Severus told his son moments later, reassuring himself more than his son, who was as unconcerned as all hell having discovered the utter joy of yanking at Severus’ hair. Severus smiled softly. “We’ll get you checked up. You’ll be okay.”
) cracked a smile. Hermione, however, looked painfully affronted, turning around to glare at Ron fiercely.
It was one thing to know that his father hated Muggleborns and thought they were gaining too much power in society. It was another to know that he was willing to let a diary possess an eleven-year-old girl and risk his own son’s life just to unleash a monster to petrify them. What happened to Ginny Weasley had been a wake-up call in more ways than one, showing Draco not only how cold-blooded his beloved father could be but how

“Did you?” his mother asked, raising one perfectly manicured eyebrow and pursed her lips. “Are you sure you didn’t have Mindy keep an eye on me while we played?”
Snape didn’t even bother to hear Mrs. Weasley’s retort before he made to stalk out of the room. Harry hurriedly stepped out of the entryway to let him by, hoping that the professor wouldn’t notice him. But Harry should have known better. Snape never missed an opportunity to be vile.
“I didn’t give permission!” Sirius roared, interrupting the older man. Harry flinched. Sirius’ mood swings had been, well,
“I was,” Minerva accused, a bit of bite in her words. “And I was enjoying myself. But I received a letter from Albus last night regarding some impulsive decisions you’ve made recently and I thought it best that I deal with it instead of letting Albus make your life even more difficult.”
“It was just a dream,” he told himself, swinging his legs over so they dangled off the twin bed. “Just a horrible, terrifying, awful dream.”
Sirius laughed, but this time it seemed a little forced. “James and I used to eavesdrop all the time. Found out half of the information we needed for the map that way. Your father’s son, you are.”
Draco clenched his jaw. Until he was thirteen, Draco’s less-than-savory views on Muggles and Muggleborns was something they emphatically ignored-- Rose was good at evasion and Draco was a dab hand at compartmentalizing, so they made it work for years and probably could have kept making it work for many more. But Draco’s second year had shaken him to his core, opening doors to ideas that, once he accepted them, meant that he and Rose could actually talk about this sort of thing without risking their friendship.
“For one thing, underage wizards have the Trace. If I went out with a task force on a mission, that fool Fudge would be all over the group in seconds. Not to mention that I’d know loads more magic by then.”
“Have you had a glass of water? Does your head hurt? I know that happened last time... Do you need anything to eat? Fletcher–-” he turned his head to snap at the man dozing off next to them. “Make yourself useful for the first time in your godforsaken life and get something from the kitchen, will you? And you--” he turned back to Rose. “What were you
“I saw the report from St. Mungo’s on my desk, so who wants to explain how my three best Auror’s managed to get made by one Death Eater, the three of you should have been able to detain him and bring him in, instead one of you gets sent to the hospital, the other leaves a note on my desk about a failed raid, and the other prefers to remain quiet. I want Yaxley captured this year, I am sick of this.” Scamander roared wishing he could fire the lot, but he couldn’t since they were usually better than this. They weren’t called the Golden Auror Trio for nothing.
“I’m sure Andromeda will appreciate Minerva’s testimony. Also in the event Dumbledore is truly Harry’s Magical Guardian it would be a step in the right direction of getting his rights to Harry revoked. Not to mention the Weasley conversation. Has Dumbledore not seen Harry’s soulmate mark, or is it some sort of Dumbledore fantasy that Harry marries a redhead like his mother?”
“Shift change will be happening soon, and Bellatrix and I will be off duty. We will leave our badge numbers with the mediwitch or Mediwizard you get in case you need us. We will see you in the morning; but before that let’s go ahead and get a few more potions into you.”
Dumbledore glared at Grant when he mentioned that Kieran was unavailable. He figured that meant the bitch Bellatrix was also unavailable. He just hoped he had a few moments before Grant found a Healer and he could search around for any information on Harry Potter. “Do you mind helping me up?”
Bellatrix would have liked to have made up her own cot in the same room as Harry and keep a watchful eye on him; but she had to trust that the night shift would take care of him. Really, she just wanted to adopt the child and raise him as one of her own. No child deserved abuse, starvation, and whatever else those horrid muggles had managed to come up with. She needed to have the conversation with her husband she would not be letting Harry go back to the muggles even if she had to kidnap him herself. After all he was Sirius’s Godson and Draco’s Mate, he was a Black and she would not be taking no for an answer. Harry needed to grow up in a loving home with guardians who supported and were proud of everything he did. “Let’s go, I have something I’d like to discuss with you.”
“I’ve learned a few things, the first thing being when I asked him what flavoring he’d like his pain potion to be he had no idea as to what tasted good. The second happened just recently when I asked if he’d like to get the dirty clothes off and into a hospital gown he didn’t want to. The signs of abuse are all there.”
The waitress lead the two over to a old time ‘Smeg’ fridge. “He’s waiting for you down the spiral staircase.” She told them opening the fridge, but instead of food there was a spiral staircase leading into an abyss, the only source of light was a giant sign pointing downward that read ‘thrills’. Suddenly the two wizards were in a moodily-lit speakeasy with interesting things hanging on the walls. Overall it was lovely with the exposed brickwork and the great music lightly playing in the background. Harry never would have thought Draco would like a place like this. Someone led them to an empty table and he finally saw the name of the bar printed at the top of the menu. “The Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town?” He said laughing gently to not disturb the other patrons as he looked for something to drink.
“I’m not hungry, but I can try.” Harry muttered not wanting to upset the kind woman. He would gladly try and choke down a few bites of it to make her happy. He couldn’t remember the last time he had a proper meal. He was considered lucky if he got to eat the last roll from dinner. Which was a rare occurrence because usually Vernon and Dudley were fighting over who got to eat the last dinner roll.
Kieran nodded his head sadly when Adrien mentioned abuse. “I was hoping for tomorrow actually. I figured it is best to let him rest today.”
Harry snapped open the lid to his wrap. “Hey Hermione, how’s your day going?” He asked hoping her day was going better than the reports his desk was riddled with. He was half tempted to take a half day claiming his ribs were on fire.
The Auror looked up at the blonde standing in his door. “Malfoy?” He questioned wondering what in Merlin’s name he was doing as a Healer at St. Mungo’s. Harry had to secretly admit that Draco did look good in the Healer robes.
Bellatrix sighed internally poor kid had already been let down once before. “Harry.” She tilted his chin to meet her warm brown eyes. “My sister, Andy, is a social worker for The Ministry of Magic. Harry, we don’t like seeing child abuse. I understand that it isn’t easy to talk about and that the system has failed you once before but that was the muggle system; the magical system has a different way of handling things.”
Harry let out a large moan when the Healer asked how the food was. The roll was soft, the right amount of flakey, and buttery throughout the roll. The Shepherd’s Pie was heavy on the gravy, the carrots and peas were well incorporated with the beef and gravy. The potato crust had a nice texture to it, and he could taste some cheddar melted onto the potato crust.
“I’ll be right back with a bubblegum flavored potion to help with the pain.” Bellatrix left the room hoping the child didn’t try and get up and leave, not that he would have gotten far in St. Mungo’s, it was sprawling, and most places were locked off unless you were a St. Mungo’s staff member. She also was familiar with several spells that could easily track him down.
He landed neatly in one of the fireplaces seeing Hermione and Neville already waiting on them. “Hey guys.” He said pulling Hermione in for a small hug.
Regulus grabbed his wand and the Panther sprouted from his wand to alert Burke of the sudden development. He looked around the room and noticed a lack of dragon and blanket. “Kieran, did you and Bellatrix not provide him a blanket before you left?” He questioned getting down on his hands and knees and looking under the bed trying to find the plush. “The dragon I gave him is also missing.” Regulus muttered.
He wanted to apparate into Surrey and ‘Crucio’ the muggles in charge of the ten-year old’s care. He was just a child, a child who could perform magic. He sighed loudly remembering the day Rigel and Elara first showed the ability of magic. He and Bellatrix celebrated those instances it hurt to think that not even 48km away from their home that Harry was being starved, beaten, and forced to cook all because he was one of the precious ones that had the ability to perform magic.
Neville groaned as Hermione wandered off to her office. “I don’t want to deal with the fallout from yesterday, I’m really glad that even though you had to make a detour to St. Mungo’s that you are doing better. So, what did the healer officially diagnosis you with?”
“I’d like to just sleep.” Harry muttered it been far to long that he had been able to sleep in an actual bed, even though it wasn’t really a bed per say. It was still more comfortable than the crib mattress that he slept on in the cupboard. “I give permission for Kieran to talk about me.”
“Because mother you should meet our boss, he has no sense of personal boundaries.” Ron said coming out of the kitchen a piece of bacon hanging out of his mouth. “Are you feeling better today?” Ron asked giving him friend a worried expression. “You never did call me last night like I asked you to do. I was worried sick about you, mate.”
“What did you learn from Grant about the boy?” She asked knowing Kieran would find a few of the things she had discovered interesting.
“Ronald, please close your mouth.” Hermione sassed looking at Harry and her fiancé really some things just didn’t change and Ron’s manners were certainly one of them. “It’s fine what matters is that there is now one less wizard being abused.” After the war, she was the one who spearheaded the Department of Wizard Social Services and it was her idea about an all magical orphanage. After she learned about Voldemort growing up in an orphanage and everything that had happened to Harry as a child, she was determined to do something so that no magical children had to deal with such heartbreak. Kingsley had agreed wholeheartly and thus her department was born.
“You’d be surprised,” Draco corrected, his head clearly back in his Common Room. “The Slytherins are only tight-laced outside the dormitories.”
“That’s our Hermione,” Ron informed Rose in a mock-whisper, eyes twinkling. “We have the recipient of the Prince Family Gift sitting in this very room and she wants to bother my brother about a transfiguration project he hasn’t even started yet.”
The girl-- no, Rosaline Snape-- left the door open wide as she sauntered into the kitchen, shooting a wink in George’s direction as she did so, giving Harry and his friends full access to the meeting. Fred shrugged good-naturedly, and his answering smile seemed to indicate that he thought it right decent of her. Harry couldn’t bring himself to agree. The girl had just pulled a wand on George (not that he looked too put out, mind, but the point stood), and Harry had learned a long time ago that Snapes never did something nice just for the sake of it.
He walked closer, telling her again to stand down, as if it was an option. As if she wasn’t a mother. As if she hadn’t sworn to all the gods in every pantheon that she would protect the dear little bundle she had held to her breast that first night to her last breath. Lily would gladly forfeit her life if doing so granted Jonathan even five more heartbeats.
But Draco knew better than to advertise this change in heart. Most of his friends wouldn’t mind-- Blaise and Daphne didn’t give a whit about blood status, Sophie and Millie were Muggleborn and Muggle-raised, respectively, and while Pansy might not agree, she hated Lucius more than she hated Muggleborns. But Greg and Theo were firmly under their fathers’ thumbs and Vince was loudly and fiercely against Muggleborns. His letters to Draco this summer had been filled to the brim with his ambitions for the war, and it made Draco sick to realize that the quiet, careful boy who he’d grown up with was becoming a fanatic right before his eyes. Vince, at the very least, was on Draco’s father’s payroll, so Slytherin House was hardly a safe place to go against his father in any way, much less ideologically.
Rose cocked her head to one side as she leaned towards Ron, mentally paging through one of her old history books.
“Well you nixed Aunt Cissa for being too soppy,” she complained, tutting over the state of Rose’s braids and taking out the hair bobbles so that she could redo them. Rose shot Draco an amused look from the floor, and he grinned in response, shaking his head at their parents’ antics. “And if I can’t be an auntie or a godmother I’m practically nothing at all! She can’t keep referring to me as
He cast all the diagnostic spells he knew, spells that detected all kinds of injuries and damage, but found nothing of consequence. But the scar still remained stark and inflamed on his boy’s head.

Sirius snorted. “Wanted to discuss something with me. Could only make this time and Albus made me agree. Waste of time though.”
“May I interject?” Rose raised a hand hesitantly. All heads turned towards her. There was a nice stretch of silence before she continued, if by
Rosaline instantly tensed at the sound of the nickname, and a part Harry couldn’t help but sympathize. Snape was her
“Dad did tell me you were a skeptic,” Rose sighed a little as she shrugged. “Which I have to admit to finding a bit strange. Why it’s so easy for you to accept that brooms can fly and a person can kill someone else with one flick of a wooden rod but not even the
traveling after a vision? Are you mad? I didn’t raise a madwoman, Rose, I’m sure I’d have noticed. Now--”
Remus opened his mouth to protest, but seemingly thought better of rehashing the same old quarrel and shook his head before turning to Harry. “Minerva seems to think she’s a good kid. So try not to give her too hard a time, alright Harry?”
“I love you, Lily Marie Evans,” he murmured hoarsely, tears threatening to fall despite his shields. “Always have.”
(Unless she knew about the whole Richard thing. But seeing as Draco was still in possession of his bollocks, he was reasonably sure that the cat was still
Snape still hadn’t put down his wand, but Harry saw that his dark eyes were scanning the stairs, not him, so he relaxed a bit.
“The Royal Sight is a family Gift,” Lupin argued, his amber eyes looking Rose up and down. She pushed down her urge to fidget and raised her eyebrow in challenge as he did, staring him down in a way that was sure to have made Narcissa Black proud had she been there to see. The werewolf swallowed and looked back to the headmaster. “And Rosaline isn’t a Prince.”
“The Gifts aren’t just myths,” Rose cut her off impatiently. “As I said, I have one. I’m the current wielder of the Royal Sight. I literally just had a vision thirty minutes ago. I know that Rutger is considered by some to be a great political historian, but believe me, she way missed the mark in that sixth chapter. There’s a reason why
“I’ll miss this,” she decided, as she glanced over at Draco’s wide grin. “Seeing as I somehow doubt this behavior being deemed acceptable at Hogwarts.”
Rose rolled her eyes before studying the board, but Draco was right. She was absolute pants at chess. It was quite embarrassing, honestly. By the looks of things, the tosser was going to beat her in less than five moves. There was no hope left for her.
“Get out of my cabin.” Vernon roared advancing on the giant he wanted to keep Harry where he was and not send his favorite maid and punching bag away to that freak school for nine months out of the twelve; what else would take his frustration out in life? He supposed he could try drinking but that didn’t seem nearly as fun.
Harry James Potter hated his life. His parents were drunks who died in a car crash and he was sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley of 4 Privet Drive who treated him like a slave. He was the maid, he cooked, cleaned, gardened, and was Dudley Dursley’s personal punching bag. He sighed looking down at his left wrist where a black tattoo of the name Draco Lucius Malfoy was flanked by what looked to be two dragons. The name had been there for as long as he remembered and none of the Dursley’s had a tattoo of a name on them.
Harry had learned about age two to hide the tattoo because if he didn’t it just made Vernon incredibly angry and when he saw the tattoo it just made the abuse that much worse. He finished drying the plate in his hand when he heard Vernon’s voice from the living room. “Where the fuck is that freak?”
Regulus quickly charmed his trash receptacle to banish Vivienne’s vomit. He understood and would never tell a soul that he was witness to Vivienne Riddle unloading her stomach in his office. This case was especially horrid. It was a wonder Harry James Potter was still alive.
“Well in some ways it is just a stick.” Bellatrix teased the child knowing that Kieran’s exam would tell them if that wrist had been broken before and if they were right with their abuse assumption that wrist had been broken multiple times.
“I’ll also loop in a Mind Healer to your case; and before you get annoyed with me that I am suggesting you see a ‘shrink’ I’m not saying to have to have weekly appointments not if you don’t want to; but they can be greatly beneficial to have on one’s side during any abuse trials. All that I ask is that you give them a chance and if you hate it and don’t find it helpful you don’t have to if you don’t want to. Would you feel more comfortable meeting with a male or a female? Again, if you don’t like them; you don’t have to see them. Everything is entirely up to you. I’m just offering you someone to talk to.”
