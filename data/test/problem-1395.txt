He cast a couple of strong Warming Charms on himself and went outside in his robes as he was. He thought that perhaps a bit of fresh air would help clear his head of the alcohol. He had drunk a bit too much champagne.
"I did?" She frowned, obviously trying to recall the memory. "I don't remember. Everything from before is in such a fog. Still, ever since I woke up and have been trying to take a more active role in my life, Ron had been ignoring me, or placating me, or trying to make me drink that stupid fruit juice, when I told him I couldn't drink juice anymore. I just can't be with him! I don't want to be with him. I don't even remember why I married him in the first place!" She was desperately trying not to scream, but she obviously wanted to in her frustration.
"Okay."
The rest of the day was spent with the children, and with some swimming. Before he started to spend time in the pool room of Malfoy Manor, Harry hardly ever spent time in the water, but he realised that he really loved it. He was a bit clumsy when it came to the actual strokes, and Draco along with Hermione helped him to become better at them. Sometimes though, his clumsiness could be attributed to the fact that Draco in his tiny swim shorts was a very enticing sight. If Hermione had not been in the water with them, they would have had to lock the doors.
Back on the streets, the weather was getting worse. The last of the autumn leaves swirled around and Harry burrowed his face in his scarf. They hurried into Fairyland, one of the toy shops on Diagon Alley that opened after the war.
"Ginny, I've been thinking. Maybe I should move on from law enforcement," Harry started up The Conversation. They had drawn up discussion points with Draco, but he still had to improvise most of it.
"Members of the Wizengamot," began the Chief Warlock, "today we have the rare and pleasurable task of welcoming a new member amongst us. Harry Potter will be taking over the Potter and the Black votes from Arthur Weasley, who had been safeguarding them for him. Harry Potter," he looked straight at the young man, "please repeat the oath after me."
“You don’t want to kiss Mummy anymore?”
"So, can I join?" he asked.
"Hi," answered a shy voice and the child stepped out from the safety of the furniture. He put his hands behind his back and then looked up at the man before him.
"It may not mean anything."
"But you were both so happy together. Surely, now that you've had a few days without your family, you can see that without them, you are no one." He cringed internally at that part. Malfoy had insisted that Light Wizards regard an unattached woman as a person without aim or meaning. To them, the real purpose of a woman was attending to her husband and children.
"Yes, beautiful, isn't it?" He leaned over, seatbelt still fastened.
"It's five in the afternoon," he said, pointing at the clock on the mantle.
"Oh, did you exact revenge on her already?"
I'm gay." He swayed slightly, sitting on the couch. "Just a kiss."
As always, I thank my two betas for all their work. Faye, because she bares my moaning about my insecurities and keeps telling me that my chapters are good. Icicle, because she ruthlessly edits my mistakes and lets me know when something is weird. I need someone to tell me when I could improve.
"Very well, here you go." She shoved the
“Fine.” Harry was surprised at how readily he had agreed. “But you become a Dark Wizard once you get it and support my educational reform. In exchange, I’ll support your divorce law.”
"It was nice seeing you, Scorpius," he said, as a way of farewell, and then hurried to catch up with the older blond.
"No." He kissed a pale shoulder. "Never. I'm just...not sure if I can do that to the children. She's still their mother. The divorce will surely be in the papers, and what I do will reflect on them as well."
"Yes, of course." Harry tried not to grin.
"Yes, but there was a point when I thought of calling it off. Then everything got hazy, and I forgot about that. All I wanted to do was to please Ginny."
The following weeks went by uneventfully for Harry. The kids were back and he was glad for it. Even the short holiday from work made him happy, since he could just play all day with the children, at least when they weren't in school. Surprisingly, Ginny put a lot of effort into their relationship, more than she had since they'd gotten married, he noted. She would offer him sex at every opportunity, try to make his breakfast, even though she had always hated being in the kitchen. She called his diet silly and tried to feed him his regular fare of a full English with toast and juice, but he refused it and instead ate what Dinky had prepared for them. She tried again a few times, but eventually gave up. Once that came to pass, she focused all her energy on being very romantic instead. Picnic lunches in the park were a regular occurrence and Harry went along with them half-heartedly. He knew that he should have been happy with his wife's displays of affection and newfound enthusiasm for their relationship, but he was rather annoyed and weary of her sudden interest.
When Harry was done with the rest of the story of their stay, had passed the printed out pictures around, he took a deep breath, and plunged ahead with telling them what he had decided.
“Let’s sit down,” the host proposed as he felt awkward just standing around. At that Malfoy took a seat in the chair and the two friends occupied the sofa that was at a 90-degree angle to the other furniture. The blond man looked around the room with obvious distaste. Harry couldn’t understand why, Ginny had tried to put into that room an opulent elegance. Frankly, he didn’t care for it much, because all the seats were rather uncomfortable, but it was what Ginny had wanted. He had thought that Malfoy would be pleased with the room at any rate.
"So, Draco, do you want to run away with me then? We'll have 100 Galleons then," he proposed.
"Draco. I just want you to be honest once."
It had been a difficult day for Harry, but when his head hit the pillow, he felt oddly good. Things were happening and it was as though he had been standing still for many years. He was finally moving forward. He just hoped Hermione would get her children back in the end.
"It's just that ... since everything started to happen, I'm just seeing my marriage the way it is. She's always away, but even when she's here, she doesn't care for the kids much and ... for me neither. Lately, she had been acting more enthusiastic and loving, but I can't help remembering that before it was never like that since we got married." He sighed, remembering that up until a few days before, the last time they had gone on a picnic was still in his courting days. Not that he hadn't tried afterwards, but she always had an excuse.
"All right, we'll give it a try."
Always looking for likes to Zelda of Arel and Drarry Shippers on Facebook. Adults only!
"Not my partner," Harry mumbled, as he was picking up himself off the floor.
"Not good?"
"Draco," he breathed out as they broke for air. He opened his eyes, and his vision was once again filled with grey. Harry didn't want to stop, and he encouraged Draco with his hands to close the gap once more. His eyes closed again as the blond dove in for a second round. His mind shut down, and so did everything else, probably because he passed out.
know it."
"I suppose. Hermione should really get you a Barbie." He laughed, remembering the conversation they once had.
"Oh, Hermione, I miss the kids so much," Harry began, trying to sound as authentic as he could manage.
and munching on some toast. Narcissa was cutting into her eggs. The four children were behaving themselves, and trying not to shovel their cereals into their mouths. Harry looked around, observing the domestic scene before him. Perhaps, for a long time, all his mornings would look like that.
"I did."
"Fine, Hermione." Harry was speaking loudly enough by then so that all who wanted to could hear everything. "You are a disgrace as a woman, a wife and a mother. You have gone against the wishes of your husband and when he rightfully demanded that you do as told, you left him. Now you have the audacity to want to rip your children away from the Weasley family - where they belong. With such an attitude you are no longer welcome in my house."
The waiter came by with some menus, and they were in Italian as well. Harry was a bit frustrated, and could understand the couple that had left.
After he finished reciting the oath, the Scribe stepped behind him and helped him take off his green outer robe to reveal a black shirt and black trousers underneath. Then he helped Harry put on the official plum coloured robes of his new station. The Chief Warlock left his seat to stand before him and pinned the silver W onto his breast.
"I can't believe my father has a measly 50 Galleon-limit on my personal withdrawals. What am I supposed to do with this small pocket-money?"
"Next time." Harry grinned.
"No, Harry! Don't you try to send me home! That bitch is still wearing my name and as long as she does, whatever she is up to reflects on me."
"Hi, I'm Summer Holiday, this is Lillian's Kealoha and that is Prisha Basu. The red-head introducing herself to your boyfriend is Katrina Caliente," Summer said to Harry. "We are your neighbours. I live in the large house at the corner with my friends. If you want to have fun, meet other people, then just come around."
"No, but there are charms that can substitute electricity."
"She's probably on the beach."
"No," she admitted and let herself be dragged out.
"I'm sure that the kids love you no matter what," Draco injected in what Harry thought to be an unusual show of support. Hermione wasn't surprised by it though and only smiled at the man.
"Yes, well, … let's move onto the next agenda then," he began.
"What happened? I thought you would be shagging the Weaselette into a mattress about now."
"It wasn't serious. He'll probably be a bit disappointed that I'm off the market now, but he'll get over it."
"I'm going to divorce you," Harry told her.
Draco broke away, and taking Harry's face in his hands, he planted a long kiss on his lips.
The Thai witch looked up. She was very young and pretty. Harry wondered if there were any ugly Thai people, or they hid them somewhere.
strange," Draco noted.
"I'm terrrible! So she cheats on me." Harry took a big swallow, nearly choking in his haste. "She didn't love me. Just married Harry Potter. .... You were right, Drrracooo. You're smart. And I'm bad in bed. Bad, bed." He giggled at the sound of the two words together. He looked into the smiling grey eyes before him. "Wanna kiss me?"
"Not yet, Mr Blotts, but I was sure that we could find something for him here for Christmas," Harry informed him.
"Oh Harry! It's one of Draco's schemes. You see, we figured that if Ron heard that I was with a man, then he would assume that I was eager to get a divorce myself. Adrian is a great friend of Draco's and was the perfect candidate to play my anxious beau just waiting to find me single and available." She grinned and seemed most pleased with herself.
"Ginny, Ron! What are you two doing here?" he asked, innocently.
"This is Narcissa Malfoy. She saved my life during the war."
Once the letter was finished, Harry returned to the bedroom. Draco had prepared quite a picnic on the bed, and he sat down to have a naked lunch. Harry noticed how quiet Draco was.
"Draco, I know this is not champagne, but I want to toast to our new life. I'll be eternally grateful for meeting you at Gringotts yesterday. I have secretly dreamed of a life with you, but reality is far better than what I could have hoped for. Thank you Draco, for coming with me. So, I make a toast to you," Harry took his glass, Draco as well, and they chimed the two together, both taking a sip.
“Out on the street?” Harry asked, horrified.
“What did she tell you?”
"With Malfoy?" Ron spat out.
He hoped he could find her soon, but after a few hours the sun had begun to set and people seemed to be heading back to their hotels. He didn't hurry back though. As the sky turned orange and red, painting the sea with similar colours, he sat down on an abandoned lounge-chair and just stared at the magnificent scenery before him. He was alone. He wanted to have a warm person beside him, to hold and enjoy the brilliance with. Letting a sigh escape his lips, he tore his gaze away and spotted a blond head a few chairs down, also watching the sunset. For a second, he thought it was Draco and felt a rush of delight spread out in him, but as the man turned, his face was all wrong, chiseled and entirely too masculine. Harry shook himself, and stood up.
"I know. I always know. Maybe you not know and why you have problem with wife. Come with me and I show you."
The kitchen.
"Oh, can we go to that new restaurant just off of Diagon Alley, the Alchemist? Everyone is talking about it."
During their talk what they didn't see was that their neighbour, Summer, had crept to their curtainless window with a camcorder in hand. She was ready to hit record when the men started to make good use of the rather large couch. She didn't have long to wait.
"I can hear it in your voice that you don't like my plan. What do you think I should do?"
"No, it's just what she wanted. I ..." He fell silent. He just couldn't come up with a good excuse as to why he preferred his wife on some remote island rather than in his home. Ginny was his wife, the woman he wanted to share his life with. It's true that he had been very complacent in the past years and he did feel more energised since starting his diet. However, while he no longer wanted to go along with everything his wife wanted, he still didn't mind if she was away from him.
eyes." She motioned to the crowd around them. "They look after themselves and their families first. It's different, but I realised that while most of them are Slytherins, they are not bad people. Unlike their reputation."
"Sure. We love having them."
"And that." The blond grinned.
"True. However, once you get to know the dark families I'm sure you'll find people who will get close to you. It won't be the same, though. Is it too much to sacrifice?" Draco looked at him with an expression that allowed him to back out from all of it. Harry sighed and shook his head.
Arthur just nodded and then he was called away by Percy. Harry was glad that the conversation was over, as the subject of Ginny was an awkward one for him. However, he wasn't sure why exactly.
Harry was not in a hurry to see his future ex-wife, and she was already waiting for him in the parlour. She was standing next to the large hearth in the room, snow dripping from the bottom of her trousers. She looked up from the fire as he entered.
"Draco," Harry broke the silence.
"Oh, eh, yes." It all felt rather surreal to Harry, and he even considered that he had been transported into another universe. Lucius Malfoy was making small talk and still smiling. It was rather unnerving.
"Sorry Harry for snapping at you," he apologised.
"Could I leave something here for her after that? Just something small."
Both boys cheered.
"You know that no one will care if I'm gay. This isn't the Muggle world," Harry pointed out.
"Yes."
“Ron…” Harry tried, but was cut off.
"I know."
She was whining once more and it only served to irritate her husband all the more. She acted as if she were one of the children and Harry was not amused by it.
"However, for a wife to travel alone for so long..." came the interruption.
Harry woke up to the sound of the alarm clock going off. Like every other morning, he reached over to hit the snooze button. Just ten more minutes. Again, just as always, ten more minutes were not enough, but he got up anyway and headed to the bathroom to take care of his morning routine. After that he went down to the kitchen to find Dinky preparing breakfast and sat down at the head of the table. The same as every morning.
"No!" He purposefully downed another glass and almost broke the glass as he smacked it against the table. "Another one!"
Harry had enjoyed the meal, and afterwards they walked the streets a bit more. They took a lot of pictures, and Harry even tried to be somewhat artistic about it. He took close-ups of the balconies with sleeping ivy curving around the railings. A row of vespas in front of a shadowy eatery also caught his attention. They walked over the Tiber, the lights on the Tiber island flickering in the water. Harry found himself slipping an arm around his companion as they strolled down the bank of the river. Draco smiled at him, and Harry wanted to kiss him badly, but he was afraid. What if someone saw them? When they went more into the city, the constant honking from the cars took the romance quickly away.
They chose a small room on the floor of the courtroom for the meeting. It was obviously used for interrogations, with a table and two chairs around it. Ron sat on one chair, and Hermione on the one facing it. Harry and Draco stood behind her, silently supporting their friend.
Hermione winced at the remark and Harry felt sorry for her. It meant spending Christmas away from her children.
"Go on inside, Mr. Potter. I'm going to take Snowflake back to the stables," Lucius informed him.
"Yes." His voice was sad.
Then where was Harry?
"That's different. Or you regret last night." Harry could hear the start of a sulk in his voice.
"Yeah, we shagged. It was really phenomenal, don't you remember?"
Now, time to thank my lovely betas. Faye adored this chapter. She really liked the last bit. :P Icicle had less work with this one than the previous. She loved some of the imagery towards the end.
"Oh, well, yeah. I tried to be a good friend to Hermione and help her in seeing what was right, but it didn't work." He bowed his head in mock defeat.
"Would you divorce her and marry a man if you fell in love with him?" he was curious.
"Of course, Mr Potter. Just sign here." She gave him a blank sheet of paper.
“If it hadn’t escaped your attention, I’m very much in love with my wife.”
"All right." Harry was glad that he had suspected that in some foreign countries the American money would be more appreciated than their local one.
Most of the rooms were of course unremarkable sitting rooms. Harry wondered about why great houses tended to have so many, but couldn't really come up with an answer. Perhaps it was just a way of occupying space on the ground floor that was needed for the bedrooms above.
He left the room and in another found an open doorway to the gardens. The night was rather cold, but he cast a heating charm and walked out into the moonlight. There were a few lamps lighting the path, but they didn't give the harsh and bright light that electric ones did. He spotted some lovely autumn roses by a wall and went to smell them. They had a strong perfume that felt heavy compared to the light scents of the season. As he was enjoying their fragrance, he heard voices coming from above him. Looking up, he spotted Draco and another man, whom he didn't know, gazing at the full moon. Harry tried to recall if he had seen him somewhere, but it was rather dark and the man had dark hair as well, just like most people, so he didn't ring any bells. However, he was delighted by the chance to do some further eavesdropping, so he plastered himself to the wall and even did a small spell to stop the twinkling of his robes.
"That was incredible."
Harry completely forgot. He frowned and went back to their room. The day was not going well and he was hungry. As a child, he could live on a piece of toast for days; however, those times were long past and he was no longer used to hunger. He was slightly irritable. As he started to change into street clothes, he saw his wife follow him and begin to dress as well.
"All I could think about was trying to stay alive and keeping my parents alive as well." He shook his head, trying to make the memory go away.
"Harry Potter! How dare you take that awful woman into your house! Under the  same roof as my grandchildren! You bring shame upon us and on your own wife!  That woman is trying to leave my poor Ronnikins, who has never done a wrong  in his life! Who for years has only been slaving away at work to provide  everything for his family! Such a foul woman deserves to be out on the  streets! If you don't throw her out right this minute, you are no longer  welcome in my house!" As those last words came out through the magical  mouth, the Howler burned to ashes.
"But sir!"
* * *
"It is a large place," Harry admitted.
"Well, see you later, Draco."
"But you said ... you said you knew from a kiss."
"Of course, Hermione," Lucius answered. He even bowed a little and while executing it, he snuck a peek at Ron, who just sputtered incoherently. Malfoy offered his elbow to her and they both regally walked towards the Floo.
Their entrée was roast beef with equally roasted vegetables in a red wine reduction. Harry assumed the sauce was made from Malfoy wine as well. Finally, for afters, they had poached fruits with vanilla cream. Everyone was completely full and ready to find a nice bed for a few hours after eating the hearty meal.
"I'm not, but remember, I was great in Potions. So much so, that I became a
He left it though, and sucked on his own finger to lubricate it. Then he inserted one into Draco's opening, returning his mouth to its previous task. The sounds above him got even louder. He knew Draco just loved being stimulated on both sides. He glanced up to see the wanton look on the beautiful face above him, and the other man had one of his fingers in his own mouth, lightly sucking at it. Harry thought of turning around to give him something else to suck on, but he wouldn't have been able to last that way for what they wanted to do. Next time.
Harry just nodded and paid for the two books. After saying goodbye to Mr Blotts, who had clearly enjoyed witnessing a banter by the legendary rivals of Hogwarts, the pair left the shop.
Facing those three redheads, Harry didn't know what to say. Arthur looked disappointed. Ron's face was scarlet, clearly indicating barely suppressed rage that Harry just knew was going to come out in a tirade any moment and Ginny looked close to tears. Her expression disturbed him the most. Here was the woman he married, the one he thought was the love of his life and he made her cry.
"You see Draco, I did get something that's green," Harry said, then showed the bed to his boyfriend.
"I'm glad to be of help." The man grinned back. "You do need it, but I'm sure that given a bit of time, you'll become an excellent Wizengamot member and a proper Light Wizard."
Harry woke with a start. He looked around, then when he realised his vision was blurred, he scrambled to get his glasses from his nightstand.
"It's so... serene."
"Good morning, everyone," they both greeted and sat down, next to each other.
"Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Potter! Welcome to the Alchemist." She was extremely pleasant, but not in an annoying way. "I'll get a table for you right away," she said as she looked at the book in front of her. She seemed to nod to herself and gestured to her guests: "Right this way."
"Of course." Harry signed with great practice as he had given his autograph for many people before. He used another way to sign his name on official papers to distinguish the two.
"I remember you well, too.... I'd better go and sleep this off." Harry got up, wondering which way his room was.
"Here we are," the boy announced. "You sure not come to my room?" He wasn't giving up.
"Bye, Scorpius." He waved and then joined the older Malfoy on his way out of the room.
Draco just patted his hand on the table, and discussed what they were going to eat with the handsome dark skinned waiter. Harry thought he was just a bit too smiling, but said nothing.
"No, just ignore them," Draco said, enveloping him in a hug. "I know that this is strange for you, and that Muggles have issues with this, but you have lived your life according to what others wanted of you long enough," he whispered.
That was when Ginny walked down the stairs. Harry was surprised to see her  as he hadn't expected her to be back for a while. She looked at her husband  and her eyes narrowed.
Harry returned to his task, and was soon inserting three fingers in, stretching Draco. His lips left the beautiful cock, and he swiped his tongue around the rim of the hole he was preparing. That elicited another loud moan, and Harry teased the opening further.
They lapsed into silence. Draco was obviously waiting for Harry to start speaking. However, he had to wait a while as he was well on his way to consuming his second glass of Firewhisky by the time Harry opened his lips again.
"My parents suspected ever since I was little. However, when we had the Yule Ball, Pansy insisted on getting a goodnight kiss. It was the vilest thing I've ever done... Now when Anthony Goldstein pulled me into an alcove during that horrible seventh year, that was the highlight of the whole year." Draco remembered fondly.
"Yes. I have studied the positions of both sides on key issues and discovered that I agreed with the viewpoint of the Dark families. Therefore, I decided to join them." He gave the answer that they had discussed in preparation. They didn't expect to have to give them so soon, but they didn't rule the possibility out.
"I'm not sure. I'm not really comfortable taking your money," she said as the water stopped and she was getting out of the shower.
The only dark-haired man in the room nodded along, seemingly hanging onto the man's every word. Arthur's attention was also focused on him, his tea seemingly forgotten on the coffee table.
"Where are we going, Harry?" she asked, excitement appearing in her voice at the prospect of an outing.
Lily extracted herself from Draco’s lap, and she ran after her brothers to the playroom, who were being ushered out by Hermione.
As he got his new body, Voldemort wanted to put it to good use right away. He made some remarks about having wanted to do this for years, and he cut off Harry's clothes as he was lying spread on the altar. He pumped his rather impressive cock, ready to plunge into the boy unprepared, when Remus Lupin and some other Order members finally apparated to the scene. The usual fighting ensued with the Death Eaters gathered to witness the restoration of their Master's body. Remus died. Harry was heartbroken, but no one seemed to care.
Ginny entered their bedroom from the bathroom and smiled at him from behind old-fashioned spectacles. She was wearing a lot of tartan in her costume as McGonagall: tartan skirt, tartan robes, only her shirt was white. It was as if the clans of the Highlands had exploded on her, they all had a different pattern. Harry didn't think it was very flattering on her, but he didn't know anything about clothes, he reminded himself.
"How long do I have to keep up the ruse, do you think?" he asked Draco.
"Who would have thought," Hermione said as she looked back to her old friend from watching her new one leave.
He found himself in a sculptured garden lit by strategically placed torches. There were various paths leading around rose bushes and other flower beds that were empty at that time of the year. In the centre stood a large fountain, warm water cascading down in a cloud of steam. Stone benches surrounded it, and Harry decided to take a seat. However, as he approached, he noticed a lone figure already occupying one of the benches. His white blond hair gleamed in the faint torchlight and Harry recognised him as Draco.
"I don't know much about Wizarding Family Law myself," he continued, "nor do I know any solicitors who are good in the field. But, I had an idea last night. I ran into Draco Malfoy yesterday."
"Oh, Daddy, I have a great idea!" Ginny spoke up and she looked very excited about what she was going to suggest. "There is going to be a Ministry Ball for Halloween! I'm sure all the members are going to be there. It's one of the biggest events of the season! We could all go and you could introduce Harry formally. It would be a great opportunity to make an impression!"
Albus and Lily nodded, but James quickly spooned a few more mouthfuls of his breakfast in, and left the table.
"Ginny? What are you doing here?!" he exclaimed, trying to escape from the woman's mouth.
Hermione just blushed and smiled. She didn't know that she had caused him trouble at home.
"Follow me, mister," the boy said, his smile brightening.
"Limit?" Harry couldn't understand what the problem was. He had taken money out before, but never heard of a limit.
“The Wizengamot members don’t get paid. It’s a position of honour, not a job. Honestly. No wonder Weasley holds your positions for you,” he said in a huff.
"Yes, very likely. We'll have to discuss it tomorrow with her."
“So, what do you want, whore? I see you have your toyboys with you,” Ron said, very smug and confident.
"No, I'll be fine."
“You could help me get it back, Malfoy.”
"Yes, that'll be good." Harry was glad that he didn't have to pay attention to his trunk soon.
"Oh, so that's what you thought? No. I was famous myself. After all, I'm a Malfoy. I was fascinated by you, Harry. You destroyed the Dark Lord as a baby. Father said you had to be a wizard with great potential. I wanted to be near that. However, I had some other reasons as well, but those are a bit too personal," he revealed.
"They will need to get to know you more. I'm sure once they do they will have no doubt in their minds about just how suitable you are." Arthur smiled proudly at what he said.
"Okay, I'm not tired at all."
Wizarding world as it was in the Muggle one. I had no idea he could, or even would take them away,” she said into his shoulder.
Their eyes meet and communicated the feelings neither of them were ready to say out loud.
"But .... we were fourteen!" He was astounded. The least of his problems that year were hormones. Though there was that whole thing with Cho.
"What can we do indeed," he pretended to ponder the issue as he headed to the dining room, his wife close on his heels. "I don't think there really is anything we can actually do. There is nothing in the article that is strictly speaking untrue. Though it is malicious." He sat down at the head of the table, looking around expectantly. "All we can do is try to keep Ron from attacking people."
Besides looking at statues, what Harry really wanted to do was to get used to being with Draco in public. It wasn't always easy. Mostly it was just the occasional look, but there were some, who decided to express their problem with two men being together verbally. Harry had expected it, feared it, but realised he couldn't let it rule his life. Once he was divorced he could make the relationship public in Britain as well, and he wanted to be comfortable in it by then.
Once downstairs, the rants about "the whore" would start. Ron's rants were mostly focused on his wife's friendship with Malfoy. Draco had indeed started to introduce Hermione around the upper reaches of society. Ron was of course convinced that they were sleeping together. Harry did not even bother trying to convince him otherwise and just nodded along with both of them.
"Put on some really nice robes," Ginny told him as she disappeared into the bathroom. Harry really hoped she wasn't going to take an hour.
Said gorgeous person turned around to spot Potter laughing at him. He directed the glare at the green-eyed boy.
As they waited for their bill, the conversation turned to Hermione once more.
Harry looked into the grey orbs once again and gulped. However, the alcohol together with Gryffindor courage helped. He closed his eyes and waited.
"Did you talk to her about it?"
"I stopped being a child a long time before that. I don't even know if I ever was one," he added in a sad whisper.
"Hi, Hermione. Glad to see that you are doing so well," he said with a blush. He felt like a pauper amidst all the opulence. He had even put on his best robes that morning knowing that he would be coming.
They paid, though the manager gave them a hefty discount, and returned home.
Once they were done with the first stage, Draco and Harry gathered support for their bill. Harry groaned at the thought of courting wizards again for votes, but thanks to Draco he mostly just had to stand by and nod a lot. He also found that most of the Dark Families actually welcomed their idea and took little convincing. That was why in the month of February, they were already sitting in the Wizengamot, ready to vote on their joint proposal.
"I only ever really kissed Ginnnny. Cho once, but that was weiiird and doesn't really count." He shrugged. His words were becoming more slurred as the alcohol level rose.
"Harry, we only have to get the kids in the evening. We have hours ‘till then. What should we do?" She arrived to stand in front of him and was already undressing him. Harry wasn't very interested, but he scolded himself internally for being a bad husband. Eventually, he followed his wife upstairs, trying to seem as eager as he should have been.
"You don't love
"I spotted you while enjoying a ride. Do you ride as well?"
Hermione frowned at the name of the blond wizard.
"Harry." The blond sighed in frustration and got up. He headed to the bathroom. He turned back, halfway through the door. "We discussed this yesterday. You were on board. Perhaps, you're still clinging to that potion-induced complacency you had been under all these years."
Once they were hidden, he cast a few privacy charms. Hermione just smiled at him proudly.
"Watch it, Potter," he said as he looked down. "Watch your partner too.  Weasley is obviously off his rocker, accusing me of making illegal potions!"
Said boy sighed at the complexity of it all. Although, he was secretly glad to have one of the ultimate Slytherins around to plan everything.
"You can and you will!" Malfoy shouted. "It's the only way."
"I see." Harry nodded and pretended to mull over the words as he drank from his tea, but he was actually thinking about what his next step should be. "How do I gather the support?" he asked innocently.
"No, sir, I will not let my friend down," he said, straightening his spine.
Draco frowned again.
“What potion?” he shot back.
The place was clearly designed with girls in mind and followed the fairies theme to the letter. Most of the things around them were pink. Pink walls with flowers blossoming on the paper, darker pink soft carpeting under their feet that they could enjoy once they took off their shoes at the door according to the policy. As always, little girls were running about and the shopkeepers looked on with amusement. They probably cast Unbreakable Charms every day, as most of their merchandise would have suffered in their absence.
The witch didn't seem reassured by that.
"Yes. I know that among Dark wizards who have arranged marriages such a thing would not be a reason for divorce, but I can't live like that."
"We had the whole Manor refurbished after the War. Even the parts that hadn't been tainted by Voldemort just brought back bad memories. I oversaw most of the design along with my mother. My father was rather busy at the time."
Every wand on the side of the Dark went up. Harry was grinning as he saw that. He knew that it would go through. He hoped that perhaps some wands on the Light side would also make an appearance, but all he got was glares from the other side. The scribe counted the wands, taking Harry’s into account twice. Then the man handed the paper over to the Chief Warlock.
... together." He blushed at the memory.
"Oh, Harry, I'm sorry. Tell me."
“Is that even a word?” Harry wondered as Draco dragged him to the piano that sat empty on a small stage in the restaurant.
"Maybe you should have given it a try. You may never know."
Harry realised that the discovery he had just hear about had opened new dialogues among the purebloods. He also feared that it could give new reasons to fight about in their world, but he hoped that this time they would be limited to the debate table and not escalate into drawing wands over it. At that moment he decided that he would do everything to keep that from happening.
"Quite."
When he was completely out of sight, Harry allowed himself a sigh of relief. He decided to explore the house a bit, rather than going back and perhaps facing another one of those conversations, in case someone else had different concerns. Therefore, when he walked out of the door, he went down the corridor to the opposite direction than everybody else. He peeked into one room after the other. He felt like the old days when he would walk around Hogwarts, trying to find secret places. Of course, those excursions mostly revealed dusty and unused classrooms, but the fun was in the walk, not the findings. He saw a great, but empty library. It wasn't completely empty, some shelves were occupied, but Harry only saw Muggle romance novels and none with more substance. He remembered the great library in Malfoy Manor and estimated this one to be about the same size. Clearly, the previous occupants had either taken their books, or the new one just didn't need them. It was a bit sad, actually.
"What can I do? Those shorts should be illegal."
Harry guessed that there was something unpleasant in the rag and scoffed at it before finally locating the first page among the bits of paper. There was an unflattering picture of Ron right under the headline: "Weasley Goes Insane". It depicted him trying to attack Malfoy the previous night. Harry read the article and saw that it did not only describe Ron's actions as unsound, but his choice of attire as well. Harry tried not to laugh aloud at how true that happened to be. He did have to think about an appropriate way to handle the article that would be along the lines of his actions so far. Therefore, as he got up and put on a robe to go down for lunch, he put a scowl on his face.
“Right this way sirs,” the older man motioned them into the restaurant.
"Interesting colours."
* * *
"But ... but," she choked, holding back her tears. "I got you involved in all  of this. First Ron is angry with you, now Ginny is taking away your kids.  And there was that awful Howler from Mrs. Weasley. She's been my mum since I  couldn't make my own remember me! How could she say those dreadful things to  me?" She couldn't hold them in anymore, the tears came pouring out of her.
"Good evening. Can I travel to London, UK now?" Harry asked.
"I'm not sending you away, Harry." Their eyes met and Harry could see something in the grey orbs that he couldn't name.
"And then I named my son after him," Harry noted.
Their times in private were easy though. Harry found it fascinating that he hadn't realised he was gay up to that point, when he enjoyed everything that Draco's body had to offer so much. Except for letting the other man inside his body they tried everything, but the blond didn't seem to mind keeping it to touching and oral for the time being. He knew he would like the other man inside him, but the thought scared him. Draco did have more experience at gay sex though, and he knew that when the time came he would be in good hands. He also knew that Draco preferred to bottom anyway, so he expected the time for that to come sooner.
"Too bad we can't use hexes." They both laughed at that and headed towards  the interrogation rooms.
As he was nearing the house finally, he saw the albino peacocks he remembered prancing around a manicured lawn and on both sides great white fountains spurted out jets of water. They did not have any statues of people on them, even though he expected something like what he had seen during the war at the Ministry. The decorations on these fountains were just fish and flowers.
Draco narrowed his eyes, assessing the man before him.
The exercise outside got everyone hungry and they soon had dinner. After that, the children resolved to play inside and the adults scattered about the house, cleaning up or just chatting about things. Harry sought Arthur out and sat with him to talk about the Great Vote, as he had started to think about it.
"Absolutely."
"Not so fast," Malfoy said, holding up a perfectly manicured hand which was impossibly dainty, particularly since it belonged to a man. Harry wondered why he just couldn't barge in and take care of everything, then he realised that politics was a positively Slytherin territory, therefore dealing with it as a Gryffindor would probably not be productive.
Harry was astonished to see them kiss. He had never seen two men do that and a little voice in his head told him to look away - it was clearly a very intimate moment. However, it was like watching a train wreck; he just couldn't tear his eyes away. The men kissed languidly, clearly very familiar with each other's lips. They were taking their time, enjoying the sensations if their moans were any indication. At last, Draco ended it, but smiled coyly at Adrian.
"I can't decide that for you. You have two options. Either try to make it work, or let her go."
"That's just a nasty rumour," she rebuked and wrinkled her nose. "Voldemort spread it to make us think less of Dumbledore."
"Oh, he uses the pictures for colouring?"
"No. I've only been to Paris for my honeymoon, and now Thailand," Harry confessed.
The children could only be dragged into the house once night fell. Harry silently thanked whoever came up with Warming Charms; as without them, undoubtedly all of the kids would have gotten the cold. Even the promise of presents couldn't tear them away from their play. The bottom of the great Christmas tree in the living room was filled with packages. Everyone received a Weasley jumper, and they all quickly put them on to make the great Christmas family photo in front of the tree. Molly probably started to make them in January every year, since the family was so big with all the children, even though Charlie didn't have any, not even a wife, much to his mother's dismay, who never failed to bring it up at some point during the family gatherings. The dragon-keeper just shrugged and evaded the subject every time. The children also got a little something from their grandparents, but the adults didn't as by agreement.
"The ultimate goal of the Dark Families is to preserve Wizarding Culture. For the Light Families it's to preserve themselves. They are willing to sacrifice our way of life in order to continue on their names. They freely intermarry with Muggle-borns and use laws to make sure that these Muggle-borns are under their thumbs. If the majority of these magic-users leave the Wizarding world, it doesn't matter to them." He paused, readying himself for what he was about to reveal. "There has even been talk of revealing our existence to the Muggles. They think that the Muggles will just accept us and move on."
"Yes, she's staying until the divorce is final, which Ron doesn't want to be any time soon, so we do have time to carry out our plan. It is hard to lie to Ginny, but sometimes, not hard enough." He hung his head.
"No buts! You just confessed to not being fully aware of Wizarding Law. You  will be sitting at your desk, studying it, until I deem it necessary. Now  leave," Greer said and pointed to the door.
“Let her in, and take her to the green parlour,” he instructed. “Excuse me.” He left the table to wait for Ginny.
Harry glared at him for a second, and then his gaze dropped down to observe the amber liquid in his glass that he cradled in his hands.
"Because we'd die out, Potter." Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“So, what are you going to do now?” he wondered.
Harry frowned at what she was saying. Everyone had known that he would marry Ginny. Probably even sooner than he had known himself.
Harry winced. They still needed time to get him into the Wizengamot and change the law. However, it seemed like the divorce could be finalised soon, and once it was, it was doubtful that Hermione could get her children back. He was furiously trying to think of a way to stop Ron, but he was still half asleep and came up blank. He had to contact Draco and Hermione. Since he couldn't think of a way to stall him, Harry decided to support Ron.
"Ginny's in Thailand."
"I finally found something for one of the kids," she said as they met at the counter.
"No. She was..."
By the time they got to the Forum Romanum, Harry was tired. He never thought the hill had so many interesting ruins besides the Forum. However, that part was clearly the most fascinating one, and in spite of his exhaustion, he still kept walking. The lure of the ancient stones was too great to stop. At the end they got to a very decorated Arch.
* * *
Malfoy took a swallow of water from his glass.
“Isn’t that a surprise. I though with his temper he would let loose a few punches now and then. If he’s so great, why are you divorcing him anyway?” Malfoy gave her a smirk, making it obvious to her that she had made a mistake in marrying the man in the first place.
"Are you sure they're going to give me power over my votes?" he asked anxiously.
“Load of bollocks. She’s cheating on me with someone,” he said with conviction.
"No. Though I'm going to prove to you just how proficient I am at playing an instrument," the other said, wiggling his brow.
This is a bit short, and I tried to rewrite it several times, but I just feel that this is the place to end it. Thank you for reading everyone, and please review. Even if you didn't like it, and more so if you have constructive criticism. I'm not sure what I want to write now. I am working on a book, but for some reason it's not moving forward. I'm also translating a romance my mum wrote.
"No. I have set myself on this path, and I'm going to walk down on it. I have made peace with my decision. What the light families are doing is just not right."
"Maybe he will." Harry tried to set his father-in-law's mind at rest. However, he found that he didn't really care himself. The rift between him and Ron appeared to be final in his heart.
He tried to look around to see if he could buy a present from the shop while his wife got in a lively conversation with the proprietor over the Nimbus Apocalypse. Apparently, the broom got its name from the Muggle belief that the world was going to end that year.
Draco smiled to himself and quickly got dressed. He moaned at the few articles of clothing he could wear. Reaching the bottom of the stairs he noticed that Harry was just pouring food on plates from a pan and putting them on the dining-table.
Harry grinned as he read the letter. He had been afraid as to what Teddy would say. He spent so much time playing with the Weasleys as a child, Harry feared that he would see them more as a family than him. Without even bothering to put on clothes, he went to the desk in the small drawing room to compose a long letter.
"So you found out that it's all right to marry Muggle-borns?" Harry directed the conversation back to the previous topic. They still had a lot to cover.
"Good afternoon, Mother, Father," Draco greeted.
"Later, Harry. Once we are in the open, we could get all the kids together and have them play together."
Harry looked up and saw that the blond man was leaning over the railing of the veranda. His hair seemed to sparkle in the moonlight and his amused features were easy to make out. The hidden man wondered about what sort of fun they were talking about.
After a few minutes walk, he did actually reach his destination and arrived to the hotel. It was actually a collection of several buildings near the beach. He walked inside and found himself in a large lobby. The reception was located all the way in the back with many pretty Thai women standing behind the long desk. He walked there and introduced himself, and then inquired about his wife.
That night he returned home with an armful of books. It was rather unusual  for him and he almost fell out of the fireplace. It had been some time since  he learned not to stumble at the end of a Floo journey. Hermione had  volunteered to pick up the kids. She had hoped she could get a glimpse of  her own in the process as Harry's two younger ones were the same age as her  own.
"Oh, if I have men like you at my side, I'm sure of it." Harry hoped that he wasn't taking flattery a bit too far.
"Why?" Arthur asked after what seemed like ages just staring at each other.
"Yes, let's go," the two Gryffindors agreed.
"Perhaps she went to party straight away," the woman said and he had to agree with her. He didn't know it from his wife's accounts, but apparently Patong was party central.
"Yes, big day."
Harry tried to smile an agreement, but was actually not that happy about the comment. He usually thought Ron was too tough and quick to judge.
"Of course! The more children the better!" He grinned broadly. "What excellent advice! Thank you so much for that Mr. Mildew, I'll follow your guidance." Harry figured that the best policy in this case was to simply agree with the man and flatter him as much as possible. Draco had said in his brief teaching that flattery could always get you out of a tight situation.
"I hope you have all read through the extensive documentation that you got yesterday in preparation for the vote." The Chief Warlock glared at the members from above his spectacles. "Now, please raise your wands if you are for the new legislation and keep them in your pockets if you are against."
"But, Hermione, how would Ron find out?" he pressed.
Hermione turned white, then red, then white again, obviously unable to decide whether to be sad, or angry.
"Draco," he said, wanting to share the wonder of it all with his partner.
"No."
Valentine's Day!
Betad by Icicle.
"Good morning, Ron." He smiled at his best friend and turned back to the file he was looking at.
"Yeah. Good for the back."
Well, this is the last real chapter, just the epilogue to go. I started on that, but if you guys have any lingering questions, then tell that in a review, and I’ll put that into the epilogue.
"What's that?" Harry asked, not having a clue about what a 'Candida' was.
The Gryffindors agreed and soon they were discussing Harry's divorce.
Some weeks later, the Wizengamot was in session. Harry was a bit nervous again, sitting in his place, Draco beside him. It was the day that all their planning, all their hard labour would finally come into fruition. He had put on the plum robes in the first place for this very purpose.
"I just wanted to say goodbye and thank you again for taking Hermione in."
Harry saw Draco make a face at what Hermione was referring to. It was a bit childish, and he had to stifle a laugh.
"Yes. The knowledge is beneficial to purebloods. It addresses our concern about the magic weakening in the bloodlines. However, that is not the only reason why we're not inclined to choose Muggle-borns as spouses. Culturally the difference is rather large. You both grew up in the Muggle world and I'm sure you've had difficulties adapting to our way of life." He looked at them, seeking confirmation.
"All right, Harry," she said as she opened the door. She was probably wearing one of her newer robes, which meant it was only a few years old, but still looked rather worn. However, her hair fell down her back in long waves and her make-up was really nice. Over the past years, she had obviously learned some better grooming charms.
"Draco, what are you saying?"
"She said it was for Master's good health."
"Sir, I can assure you that I'm not involved with Ron's wife," Harry said,  trying not to sweat. He had the sudden urge to speak without pause and  reveal anything the man wanted. If Greer had asked about Horcruxes, Harry  would have told him everything.
"You also like that I'm hassle-free. I don't want you to leave your wife, or declare me your lover in front of others. All I want is to slide into you and feel you moving beneath me. I want to touch your alabaster skin. Run my fingers down your spine and watch as I disappear inside you. I want to hear your voice cry out 'more', 'harder'. Scream as you spray your seeds all over those green silk sheets you're so fond of. Mind you, I'm fond of them too. I love how they show off your body when you lie down - legs spread, hard and waiting."
"Harry, you were not ill," Draco said with confidence.
"Ha! You know why I never did? I didn't care. It didn't matter. It didn't matter that you kiss like a dog, slobbering all over me, or that you have no idea how to touch me. All that mattered was that it was you. Harry Potter, rich, famous and going somewhere. I got over my crush on you by the time I was fourteen. However, I wasn't going to let a great catch like you get away. So I endured it. I suffered through it. I bore you children and then I was free. I went out into the world to finally enjoy my life away from you and those brats!"
"They are fairly new inventions. I just read about them in a magazine. A Muggle-born is behind them. Very clever."
Harry knew his wife enough to determine that she would not give up. With a sigh, he sat up and looked at her with an annoyed expression.
The following day passed quickly. The Wizengamot had a short session, and afterwards Harry expected to return home with Draco, but the blond had other plans. Therefore, Harry enjoyed a nice afternoon at the Manor, first with Hermione, then the children joined them. In the evening, Draco arrived home with a large grin on his face, and asked Harry to join him in his study. He sat the other wizard down on his usual place on the sofa. Harry had very fond memories of the sofa, since they kissed on it the first time.
"Summon it."
"Please, just one at a time!" the blond took command of the crowd. "
"Would you still take her back?" Harry inquired, curious.
The children were very happy with their presents and wanted to enjoy them straight away, but Harry told them that they needed to have breakfast first. They grudgingly settled down at the table and ate their fill. Harry looked around and thought of Hermione. It was her first Christmas without her children and she must have been devastated. He hoped that it was going to be her last.
"Sugar. That is important in catalysing the effects of the potion," Draco said.
After a few more hours spent in the Burrow, the children were ready to sleep, and the adults decided to break up the party. They all returned to their homes, except for Charlie, who would take one of the International Floos the next day.
"I don't know his name, but he was at the party the night before," Harry explained as he turned back.
"Isn't that illegal?" Hermione spoke up. "Making a pact like that?"
"What?!"
Afterwards, they shared a glass of Firewhisky and Ginny promised that she would return with the kids and stay for a while. She felt that her husband just missed having a woman around. In return, Harry promised to take some time off from work to spend more time with his family. Soon enough, Ron excused himself and Ginny led her man upstairs for some fun before the kids came back.
On Hermione's diet. In 2008 I felt ill all the time, especially after eating. I was concerned, because I've had several problems like that and some involved rather nasty things, so I went to a doctor. After some tests they found that I have Candida in my blood, so I had too much in my system. I cut out all sugar, flour, and some other minor things, took fungi-killing medication. The blood test after 3 months of this revealed that I managed to bring down the levels to the normal one. I never slacked for one meal. If any of you have it too, then I suggest sticking to it religiously and not wavering. For those who had not had it, I have to tell you that it can be a very serious problem. If you have other conditions that weaken you, you can die from the combination. Actually, while I was on the diet, there was an actor in my country who died from a really severe case of Candida infection. So no, I'm not kidding. Anyone can have it.
"You see, Harry, the other members have to vote for it. They have a say in who sits among them. The Wizengamot is one of the most defining bodies of government in Our World, so it stands to reason that if there is such a significant change in their group that they should have a say in it."
"Draco, I meant something different by ‘moving’," Harry remarked.
"Relax. It's fine. Though, I have to admit, it's been a long time since anyone swooned when I kissed him." Draco smirked.
"You miss her?"
"Draco! We're not here to work, this is our Valentine's Day date!"
"This party is has been such a drag," the unknown man remarked. "Until you showed up that is." The grin was evident in his voice.
“I’m the deciding vote!” he shouted as he realised. Two votes meant that he would decide everything. “It’s simple, Malfoy. I take back my votes and change the law.” He grinned at Hermione and his eyes shined.
"I just... wanted to clear up what this is between us."
He was just starting on chapter two, when Scops landed on his nightstand and impatiently held his leg out. Harry took the message off the limb and the owl immediately flew off, not even waiting for a word from its owner. Harry remembered how he used to talk to Hedwig and felt a pang in his heart again. He chased it away with a sigh and opened the parchment.
"Exactly," Malfoy agreed. "In my generation most of the families have only one child. Now that we are at peace, some of the parents are attempting to have more children, but they're rarely successful. We've been trying to hide it, but we can't any longer. The majority of the purebloods are in trouble. That is why the educational reform is so important to us. We're trying to preserve what it means to be a wizard along with our bloodlines." Malfoy sighed. "So - I'm willing to support you in changing the family law if you help me."
When they were both exhausted, Ginny turned to him as was usual for their Christmas evening ritual. She had her own present for him. Harry eyed the small package and wondered what it was going to be. Before, she would usually have an exotic decorative piece for him, as if to say that she had thought of him while away. When he opened it, it was indeed a decorative thing, but in this case it happened to be a golden 'W' pin with what appeared to be gemstones covering it. It glittered in the candlelight and Harry had to force back the grimace that was threatening to break out over his face. It was a garish ornament and he bemoaned the fact that she would probably make him wear it all the time. He could just hear how Draco would ridicule it. However, he did what every husband would do to keep peace; he thanked her and assured her he loved it.
He woke the kids up at 8am and they had breakfast together. All three children were soon dressed in some of their nicest clothes as Harry didn't want them to feel frumpy next to the Malfoys. They Flooed straight to a welcoming chamber as they no longer had anything to hide. Once they emerged from the flames, they were greeted by the whole Malfoy family. Well, except for Astoria, who carefully seemed to avoid everyone else. Hermione was also waiting for them. The kids gleefully attacked their Aunt Hermione and she hugged them to herself with a huge grin on her face. Harry was a bit afraid that the Malfoys would be annoyed by the breach of protocol, but as he looked at them, they were all smiles.
"No. Why would I?" Harry couldn't understand what she was on about.
Harry knew she was angry with him, so he left her alone and went to talk to  Hermione. She was sitting on her bed in the guest room, her eyes sad, almost  crying. The dark-haired man sat down next to her and put a comforting arm  around her shoulder.
Harry made short work of his clothes, he was so eager to get on with it. When they were both down to their underwear, they crashed together, lips locking. However, there was nothing gentle about it. It felt like a battle as to who could consume the other one. When Harry kissed Ginny before, he never felt the tension. She was the passive one, but there wasn't anything passive about Draco. Either of them could win the battle for dominance and it was a challenge. The fight thrilled Harry.
"You run along now. Tell Hermione that we are in my office," Draco instructed and walked away, expecting Harry to follow as always.
"No, Harry. We love having all four of you around."
Draco woke up and found that Harry had disappeared from his bed. For a moment he panicked. Did Harry decide that he was a crappy lover and left him to find someone better? Was his cock too small? He frowned at his own stupid self-doubt. Harry came three times last night and otherwise made unmistakable sounds of pleasure. Also, Draco was hardly a virgin and from experience knew that his cock was in fact on the large side.
They boarded the flight ahead of a long queue. The other passengers grumbled a bit, but they had first class tickets. Harry sat down in the very comfortable seat next to Draco, and accepted the complementary Champagne. He just hoped that the combination of whiskey and Champagne wouldn't make him sick. They were instructed to fasten their seatbelts, and then the emergency guidelines were shown. As the plane smoothly started to move, Harry could feel the drunken butterflies in his stomach sloshing about in the alcohol. He sincerely hoped he wouldn't vomit. The plane taxied to the end of the long runway, and paused. Harry felt a hand on his, and turned from the window to see Draco smiling at him. Harry held the hand tighter.
Meanwhile, Harry tried to think through what he was going to actually say to Arthur that evening and tried to make himself comfortable on the sofa in the living room. However, his thoughts kept returning to the little boy had had met. Scorpius looked a lot like his father, but he was much nicer than Draco was as a boy. He was younger than when they first met, so maybe Draco was like that at one time. Harry shook his head, dismissing the idea of Draco ever being so sweet as his son. It must have come from somewhere though. The dark-haired man tried to recall Astoria Malfoy, wondering if she influenced her son. They had not met often, just a few times during Ministry balls. She hadn't seemed like a particularly warm person, a lot like Narcissa. Of course, the older Malfoy woman had only displayed her warmth in a time of crisis, so perhaps Astoria was like that as well.
"Wanna go interrogate Malfoy?" Harry heard Ron say as the redhead got up.
"He discovered his wife cheating on him and rushed back," Draco blurted out. Harry blushed.
“I loved you, Ron, but you destroyed that with your actions.” Hermione looked down on the table, saddened by what she had heard. “You should have trusted that, and me, and us. You didn’t give us a chance. Now here we are, and it all ended, and I can’t trust you anymore. Maybe someday. Sign it, and at least save yourself some of the dignity you have left after everything that has appeared in the papers.”
Harry looked at the arm first, then at the wizard standing next to him. His eyes were shining with wonder, his blond hair tousled in the slight wind that blew on the hill. He had never seen anyone so beautiful, and he leaned over to give a quick kiss on the other man's lips. Then he realised what he'd done, and looked around, a bit scared of the reaction of the people around him. Most ignored him, but a tourist couple looked at them with disgust. Harry reddened and looked away, trying to untangle himself from the embrace they have ended up in.
"All right, let's get down to business," Draco began. "Obviously, since you're here, you've started the next phase."
Harry got the feeling Draco was going to say something else, but he left it at that.
"You're right."
"Yes. She told me to sleep on it."
“However, I’m willing to ignore that, if you do a few things for me.” She reached into her bag next to her and drew out a stack of papers. “This is a divorce settlement. You sign it, and it’ll seem like we parted amicably. I get the children, and you can see them if you want to, but under my supervision. I won’t let you say bad things about me in front of them.”
"Children, let your aunt go for a bit, I want to introduce you to the Malfoys," Harry spoke up once he thought they had crowded their aunt enough.
"Sorry, I thought you'd at least have a towel."
"Draco, how did
Harry wondered why they had brought Malfoy in for interrogation. He couldn't  remember the blond man being tied to any of their cases. He shrugged and  made his way to the little corner desk. He noted that it was probably the  oldest one in the room, covered with carvings made by obviously bored  previous owners. He lit the candle on it, noting that it was a very small  stub. He looked around for a bigger piece, but couldn't find one. He sighed  again, wondering who he had pissed off to have such a bloody awful day, and  headed to the supply closet to retrieve some more candles.
Harry just laughed and stepped out the door while waving goodbye. He almost skipped down the way to the gates, but still managed to put his invisibility cloak on once he neared it. Perhaps, the Malfoy family was even better than he had imagined.
"Half an hour?"
"I'm not drunk enough for this."
"The Light is wrong. I … I don't see things the way you do." Harry bit his lip. They hadn't prepared anything for this scene. They knew it was coming, but it wasn't something that they could prepare for. "Arthur, I know that you and the Light see things in a certain way. Women, family, where the wizarding world is headed, but I don't. I think like the Dark does. I swore to listen to my consciousness, to represent all the people in our world equally, but I don't think the Light does. For years, I had been blind, not seeing the subtle undertones of your way of life. When Hermione left, it was all made so apparent … even I couldn't close my eyes to it. I just had to do something. The way you treat women is not right. Many of your ideals are not right. I'm going to change it to the way it should be. All equal." Harry stopped his rant as he ran out of steam.
"Alicia Morag, Witches' Weekly. How did your wife's family handle the news of you changing sides?" asked a pretty witch that Harry recognised as she regularly covered him for the WW.
Finally inside, they hiked up the small hill. On the top, they saw an arena. It stretched out before them like a Quidditch stadium, and Harry wondered what wizards played in those times. Probably something a lot more brutal than Quidditch. After that they went into the museum to have a look at some statues that were found on the hill. It mostly had heads, or headless torsos.
They had worked hard for a month. They wrote a bill that would change the family law in their world. Of course, first they had to map out just what was missing in their legislation. Harry was quite shocked to discover that women had no right to individual property in a marriage. They could make contracts before a marriage as to what they should be getting once it ended, but it could never be more than 10% of the husband's overall wealth. In the absence of a contract, they would be getting nothing. Once they entered a marriage, everything they owned became the property of their husband. Except for one thing, in case they had children from another man. Of course, Harry knew from the start what laws there were regarding the children who
"Thanks. I'm Harry and that is Draco. We just rented this house," Harry introduced themselves, leaving the last names off on purpose. "How did you know Draco is my boyfriend?"
"Did you say anything to her about it?"
Their food arrived, and they enjoyed the homemade pasta in basil pesto with some local wine. That was just the first course, as their main was a hot veal stew. They finished with a small serving of panna cotta with caramel.
"Oh, let me think now." Hermione paused, gathering her thoughts "It was some time ago. We really got together after he returned and saved Harry during that year. We were together during the supplementary year at school and it was all going well. I was thinking about what sort of an apprenticeship I should apply for. I had my eye on a healer, or perhaps some sort of a research position. It was at that time that Ron started pushing me about marrying straight out of school. I loved him, of course, but wasn't so sure about that. We had been through so much, but we were still so young. Rationally, it didn't seem wise. I also thought of living on my own for a while. I was so dependent on the Weasleys. If I got a job, I didn't have to move to the Burrow after school."
"You did at Madam Malkin's. You had clothes that were too big for you and old, awful glasses, hair that hadn't been cut properly ever." He paused for a moment, looking pensive. "I'll never forget that day."
Ginny frowned at him and moved next to Harry to place her intended purchase on the counter.
"Of course, it's not as easy as me just giving you the seats, son," Arthur began to explain. "I would love to hand them over, but I'm afraid that the law doesn't allow for that."
"I would like to buy this dragon, but I need it delivered to my home tomorrow morning," he explained.
"I think we both discovered that the other person is not all that they seemed," she revealed.
"Not my partner anymore, Malfoy."
"That she is."
"Ginny wished to travel for a while after Lily was born. Of course, I had to stay home with my duties as an Auror," he began.
"Fine, Harry. Have it your way. I'm going home. Tomorrow, I'm speeding things up," Ron swore.
"There are a few things I still don't understand, Malfoy."
"Gin, they weren't a couple," Harry had to point out.
"I like going to school," Lily spoke up, tired of being ignored. Everyone chuckled a bit at that.
There was a knock on the door and Draco called out to the person to enter. It was Scorpius, who upon seeing Harry, greeted him enthusiastically.
They had a fun, work-free day together, and decided to have a party for New Year’s Eve next week. They set about the task of inviting all their neighbourhood friends. They realised just how many they had. Harry was looking forward to the party, as he had never organised one before.
"I know, but you may have to. They'll understand that you love them."
Harry and Draco didn't use magical transportation to reach Rome. They used a Muggle aeroplane, to Harry's surprise. Draco told him to leave all the organising to him, so when he was presented with an aeroplane ticket, and asked if he had a passport, he was gobsmacked. Luckily, he did own a passport.
"Yeah, Malfoy, sorry. I'm just realising that it's not going to be as easy as me walking in there, demanding a vote and going out with my Wizengamot seats, is it?"
"Draco, we need to talk about this."
"You're right, Harry," Draco admitted, his tantrum deflated. "I'm sorry for being a prat, Harry," Draco said and
They went on to discuss many things that day, but mostly they just enjoyed each other's company. Harry barely got home before the others.
He looked around the living-room and dropped the books on the coffee table.  He gave an exhausted sigh and looked around. It seemed awfully quiet.
When they got back to the house, Ginny immediately called her brother to inform him. He was livid, but she told him not to come over. Ron vowed to delay the divorce as long as possible. He assumed that they were just itching for Hermione to be free. Harry heard everything and smiled to himself at how well the plan worked.
"You don't know that." Harry was staying calm. He found it so easy to stay calm since the war; it just came naturally to him. He was not even the least tempted to mention how he had saved Malfoy’s life, or how Narcissa Malfoy saved his.
"We have to walk down to the entrance of the hill, but you can already see some things to your left." Draco pointed, looking like almost a professional.
The ninth of January couldn't roll around fast enough for Harry. He didn't have a spare minute to sneak away to see his friends and Ginny was being especially demanding. Harry hoped that his wife got the urge to travel again soon. Then he chided himself for thinking like that. Ginny was his wife, but things weren't the same as they had been before she decided to take on the world. However, deep down, he knew that he wasn't ready to face just what that meant, and therefore, refused to go there in his thoughts. Thus, his days seemed to consist of at least 36 hours, and he was getting very restless.
After a quick shower, where they managed to only kiss, Harry fell asleep with Draco Malfoy in his arms. He had never slept so peacefully.
"Why would they do this to us?" Hermione wondered out loud.
Ron looked towards the interruption, threw an accusatory glance towards the man still sitting on the couch and walked over to the fireplace.
“First of all, I want to thank everyone for coming,” Harry began, and had to wait for the cheer to die down. “Since we moved here, you have all welcomed us with open arms. As you all know, we left our families because we couldn’t be together, and this wasn’t the reception we expected. So I thank you all for that as well,” he included the story they agreed on with Draco. “Draco, you are the love of my life,” a collective ‘aw’ reverberated through the room, but Harry only had eyes for the cute blush on Draco’s cheeks. “You can be infuriating at times. You never clean, you never cook, and you whine every time something is red,” their guests snickered at this, and so did the blond. “You are my prince, and I will happily clean and cook for you, as long as you let me have red things,” he concluded, and everybody clapped.
The eldest Weasley seemed very proud at being asked and Harry had to hide his smile behind his cup. So far, all was going according to Malfoy's plan. He had suggested that some flattery would entice the Weasleys to be as helpful as possible.
Harry cringed a little at the sudden light. He was looking at Draco a bit perplexed, as the fog that the dream had created slowly lifted from his mind. Then he recalled that the dream was actually a memory of his last birthday.
"You're right, Ron. However, you need to calm down first. It wouldn't look good if you showed up in front of a person of importance not having slept and in the same robes you had on for the Ball," Harry tried to reason with the man. He really was still in his costume and he had obviously spent the night drinking.
"Adrian Conti. Son of an old Italian family. His parents were immigrants. Very well known in the upper circles of society." Draco waved a dismissing hand. "He loves to play games, so in case we need more help, he would be happy to provide it. I am glad to hear that you progress so well with the Wizengamot. What you need to do now is follow up on the contacts you made at the ball."
"I'm going to hazard a guess and say that you enjoyed that."
That evening Hermione got her children back. She returned to the Manor with them, grinning and the happiest she had been in months. They were both in awe of the place, and enjoyed exploring it with their three friends, and their new friend, Scorpius. They were a bit suspicious of ‘Malfoy’ at first, but with the urging of the Potter children they quickly saw past the name and the things their father had taught them. Only the unbreakable charms kept the place intact for the next months as six children seemed determined to test them to their limits.
