In his periphery, Draco saw his mother roll her eyes and studiously ignored her. “I’ve always called him ‘Potter’,” he said. “We went to school together, and people often call each other by their surnames in school.”
They didn’t hold the elimination ceremony until the next morning, everyone being too tired by the time they’d returned to shower and change and wait through the filming like they didn’t already know what was going to happen.
When Draco was sure they had spent half of the remaining Malfoy fortune, they stopped for a late lunch at a small cafe. Draco was sipping at a glass of wine and gazing out the window, his thoughts drifting back to the night before and that perfect kiss at the end of the evening, when Narcissa pounced.
Pansy ignored the question. “So, you’re going to actually try on all of these dates, yes? You can’t half-arse this on me.”
Harry laughed wetly. “How like five of my top ten worst days involved horrifying mazes and puzzles? Including one where you almost died?” This time he was positive that he felt Draco cringe, but he shook his head. “I didn’t really put it together myself until… well.”
Draco had made the order and was waiting for it to come through when Hermione Flooed in, looking harried. “I’m so sorry, Harry, thank you
He was closer, now, than the Falcon’s Seeker, and the win was in his sights. In his peripheral vision, he was vaguely aware of multiple shapes barreling toward him. He could hear people yelling, but he tuned them out. He had this.
“What are we even doing, Harry?” he asks. His voice is stuffy and miserable. He’s definitely been crying, then. He’s also just called me ‘Harry’, which is new, and I think it might even be exciting if it weren’t for the rest of the sentence. Because, apparently, we’re going to talk about this.
Potter let out a surprised bark of laughter, trying to cover it with a cough. “Well. Then congratulations, I suppose.” His eyes widened just a bit as something seemed to occur to him. “Wait, is that why you keep going through boyfriends so quickly? They’re boring in bed?” He sounded both incredulous and entertained, and Draco sniffed.
“Right. Yes.” Draco finally opened his eyes and pulled himself into a seated position. His face was rather pink, and Harry tried very hard not to find it appealing. “I’ll just…” He gestured awkwardly at the door and cleared his throat.
Harry didn’t go back to the main house, even though Sadiyah had left. He wasn’t sure if she’d just gone back to the mansion or if she’d actually gone home, but either way, he wasn’t ready to face anyone yet.
“Well, don’t you clean up nicely?” Draco greeted him as he made his way to the hightop table Draco had commandeered. “I’m almost convinced you actually mean to give this a go and aren’t just here to make a point.”
Draco escorted him to the door, and after closing it behind him, found himself leaning against it, his mind whirling.
Well, ‘been incinerated’ might be a bit more accurate than ‘burned down’. ‘Been vaporized’, maybe? ‘Burned’ implied an act over a period of time, Harry thinks, whereas this was more… a flash of fire and a moment of heat followed abruptly by a surprisingly minimal amount of ash, considering how large the house is. Was. Had been.
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say as they walked along, side by side, but luckily they didn’t have very far to go. By the time he had a beer in hand, Harry was feeling a little less nervy and a little more ready to start a conversation. He had so many questions for this mysterious person, he didn’t know where to start. When he opened his mouth, however, what came out was “Aren’t you hot?”
“Well, it’s… abstract,” Harry finally said, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he held back his mirth. “And Luna did say that my aura was colorful.”
“That’s actually what I was hoping to talk to you about.” Chris leaned back in her chair, giving him a calculating look. “You know that the firm is still growing rapidly, yes?”
They all stayed in the front, finishing their food and making small talk, until people’s timers began to go off. Harry and Perry’s was one of the first, and they pulled the oven rack out to check the doneness with a toothpick as they’d been instructed.
“Yeah. I really fucking do.” He closed his eyes and leant his forehead against Draco’s, huffing out a quiet laugh. “Fuck, this day, I swear. I’ve got bloody whiplash. Merlin.”
“Oh, I was in the woods, mostly,” she told him, waiting patiently as he climbed out of bed and began rooting through his suitcase for clean clothes; after his shower, he’d collapsed on the bed and fallen asleep almost immediately, towel still wrapped around his waist. Not all that long ago, he thought he would have felt self conscious changing in front of Luna, but now that the lot of them had witnessed Blaise prancing around in the buff, it felt rather unremarkable.
Draco, to Harry’s delight, blushed slightly. “Well I’m hardly going to go out with just anyone who asks, am I?”
“I mean, we’re not really taking care of them, just hanging out and playing with them for a bit, and then we’ll have dinner after.”
“Careful, there,” Harry said, catching Draco by the waistband without thinking, his fingers falling half on sodden fabric and half on bare skin, hot and slippery against his hands. Draco’s shorts were clinging even more noticeably to his form, now, and his torso was
Almost everyone nodded, although one young woman’s eyes went wide, and she rushed back to her station before returning, looking sheepish, a few moments later. “Sorry.”
“Harry.” He sounds tired in a way he hasn’t in a while, and I know I played it too safe. “You know what I mean.” I can feel him shift next to me. “Does...
“How very unreasonable, holding a grudge over a teeny little hole bashing through several stories and Salazar knows how many cart tracks that had been in use for centuries.” Draco smirked, and Harry shrugged unapologetically.
“Well, no, it was technically before he left.” Harry raised an eyebrow, and Perry added defensively, “It was really soft! He shouldn’t have left it laying around. I would have given it back before we all left. Probably.”
Draco hesitated. He was tempted to give an excuse, but Harry’s face looked like a chastised crup and he heard himself agreeing before his brain could completely catch up with his mouth. “You weren’t heading to Puddifoot’s, though, were you? I’m not sure I can handle a room full of besotted teenagers today.”
“I know you said you skipped Hogwarts because you were already in a dance program, but I’ve been meaning to ask, how did you end up learning magic? I sort of assumed that you were Muggleborn, at first, but you’re a natural with a wand, and you’re obviously living at least partially in the wizarding world now or you wouldn’t have known about this show or who I am.”
Even over the tang of sweat and stale alcohol, Harry could smell the leather of Jack’s jacket as they wrapped an arm around him. Their hand slid up his chest as they pulled him into a slow, sensual grind, their other hand clasping his hip. Harry’s eyes soon fell closed, the proximity overwhelming. One of his hands met the one on his hip; the other, he looped backward around their neck. As they danced, the hand on Harry’s chest splayed out, making his skin tingle. At one point, he felt their fingers sliding across his skin as though searching for something. He could feel his heart pounding under their palm. As the song came to a close, Harry turned to face them, but they’d already melted back into the crowd.
When she finally instructed him to break his pose, Harry grabbed the robe off the floor and wrapped it back around himself. He hazarded a glance over at the ‘students’, only to have Jack wink at him. He wondered if it was possible to actually spontaneously combust from embarrassment.
“Oh, it’s alright. My uncle’s yacht is larger than this one, but this is still pretty nice, I suppose.”
“This was really nice,” he said once they were facing one another. “I have to admit, I wasn’t expecting much, but I had a really good time.”
Harry felt his stomach drop. He pulled out of Sullivan’s grasp, looking at him. “It all turned out okay?” he repeated disbelievingly.
Now that Sadiyah had informed Harry that the contestants talked about him while he wasn’t there (which was, in retrospect, completely obvious, but still uncomfortable to know), he realized that both she and Leela had made oblique references to how they apparently thought he felt about Draco in the past. And then there had been Blaise’s line of questions during their interview after Draco had stepped in for Jack, and Pansy’s odd insistence on confirming that he was still invested in the show… Hell, apparently even the
Harry huffed out a laugh, feeling himself finally begin to relax. “Fair.” He paused. “Wait, if you knew, why did you keep trying to set me up with people?”
“Well. We can’t actually let you see Neville now that you’re on to your solo dates, obviously, but I thought that children would be safe. They’re too young to care about your love life, so they won’t go running around to the press with anything.”
Harry followed her obediently over to the sofa, taking the opposite corner from her and turning inward. It was more of a loveseat than a sofa, really, short enough that when they faced inwards, their knees touched. “Is this going to be Leela round two, then?” he asked cautiously, unsure how he should feel.
“I mean,” Harry said, considering, “there were a few moments that were hard to watch. I was a bit upset that Pansy went ahead and aired the footage from the escape room, at first, for instance; and the fight about Perry was rough. But, overall, seeing everything laid out like that made it feel... sort of inevitable? And there’s something kind of nice about knowing that what we have was clear enough that Pansy bothered to record those moments in the first place.”
They were soon joined by the girls, followed by Draco, whom Harry had to force himself to look away from; his pale skin fairly shone against the darkening sky, and his shorts really were much shorter—and much tighter—than Harry thought was necessary. He was trying his best not to stare at Draco sliding into the water next to him when he was distracted by the sight of Blaise Zabini sauntering out the door, completely in the nude.
“How’s Cassie?” he asked Blaise, changing the subject to the younger Zabini sibling. “Any plans for post-graduation yet?”
Aside from Cormac, the blue team had been comprised of Romilda, Gabrielle, Sullivan, Leela, Hilde, and Dermot, and Harry found himself relieved at the smaller group — trying to navigate talking to fourteen people in one go the night before had been extremely draining. He hoped that, this way, he would get to talk to people in a bit more depth.
“Thanks,” Harry answered wryly. “Glad to know I look as terrible as I feel.” He grimaced. “I got called in for emergency babysitting duty again.”
It was Narcissa’s turn to sigh. “Darling. I loved your father, but he was— well, you know how he was. There was no reasoning with him. We did what we had to to stay safe. Nobody blames you for what happened, not anymore. You were a child.”
“So, what are we supposed to—” Leela’s voice began from somewhere ahead of Harry, but she was interrupted by light suddenly flooding the room. He let out a breath of relief as the size of the room became evident. Not so small after all. A voice came from above them.
He was several chapters in, Draco still fast asleep with his head on Harry’s lap, when the others began to trickle into the room in various states of drowsy disarray. Everyone seemed to have had the same idea as Harry, opting for pajamas or cozy loungewear. No one gave Harry and Draco a second look, although Greg did offer to refill Harry’s tea while he was in the kitchen, which Harry accepted gratefully.
He wasn’t terribly tall, perhaps a few inches shorter than Draco, but he had filled out significantly from the wraith of a boy he’d been at the end of the war; if pressed, Draco thought he might describe the man as ‘compactly athletic.’ His hands were stuffed sheepishly into the pockets of a pair of worn jeans that hugged his thighs in an extremely distracting manner. His thick cable-knit sweater was loose across his stomach, but clung nicely to his chest and shoulders, emphasizing their muscularity. His hair was the same disaster it had always been, and his eyes were still distressingly green behind his thin wire glasses. His apologetic smile, however, was nothing like the expressions Draco remembered having directed at him over the years.
“Never would have pegged you as a cappuccino sort of man,” Draco observed, trying to fill the mildly uncomfortable silence that had fallen between them.
Harry put a hesitant arm around her, and when she didn’t flinch away, pulled her into a hug. She buried her face in his chest, and he rested his chin on her head. “You are going to find someone amazing, Gabrielle, I promise you. Trust me, you can do
“Gabrielle…” But Gabrielle would say nothing more, steering the conversation instead toward Bill and Fleur and their children.
“Yeah, same,” Harry said, feeling warmth spreading through his chest at the mental image of Perry running around playing with a pair of small children.
Harry sighed in relief as he approached and saw that the light was on in Draco’s window. Flying up next to it, he knocked on the glass. He waited impatiently for what felt like ages, but soon enough saw Draco approaching. When he slid the window open, looking around in confusion at the seemingly-empty air in front of him, Harry spoke softly, hoping not to startle him too badly. “Hey, it’s me.”
“I had to think on my feet! It’s not like I took all that much. Just one measly cup.” He paused. “Well, and the dragon, I suppose,” he finished with a grin.
Once Nancy’s muffins were in the oven, she sent everyone back to their own stations, where the ingredients and tools they would need had been set up for them along with a printed page of detailed step by step instructions.
“You’re such a prick,” Draco told him with a glare. Still, he pulled Harry closer by two fingers in his collar and kissed him back, biting his lip just hard enough to make him gasp before slipping his tongue into his mouth. He tasted sugar-sweet, and Draco laughed. “Been sampling the products, have we?”
As they climbed from the car, Harry happily breathing in the spicy smell of pine, the crunch of gravel announced the arrival of the rest of their party. “Oh, Harry, this is lovely!” Hermione called as she slammed her car door shut.
The heavy mood eventually lifted, and Harry and Draco’s conversation fell into a now-familiar pattern of teasing and flirting. Draco found it increasingly difficult not to just snog Harry senseless right there on the ice, much to his own chagrin. Their earlier kiss had left him wishing for more time and privacy, and spending hours being taunted by Harry’s unsubtle looks and knowing smirks was not helping matters.
I can’t—” He looked close to tears, and Harry suddenly remembered the complicated instructions the house guide had included that he hadn’t thought to have Draco review.
“Oh fuck,” he groaned, letting himself fall backwards until he was lying flat on the counter, using his hands to help hold his legs in place. Harry focused his full attention on Draco’s leaking cock, taking it fully into his mouth and sucking.
“Sadly, no.” Draco spun in his chair a bit to face him. “Max and I have parted ways. Do put me down for a plus one, though.” Colin gave him a pitying look before making a mark on his clipboard, excusing himself, and heading off to harass the next unsuspecting colleague.
Rather than laughing at him, as Draco has assumed he might, Harry blushed as well. “Right. Let’s uh… let’s get back to decorating, then, shall we?” He cleared his throat and seemed to be aiming for a lighter tone as he added, “Teddy’s made some impressively hideous baubles at school that he’s keen to hang.”
There was no way that he could sort out the tangle in his mind tonight, Harry knew. Impulsively, he rang for an elf and requested a vial of Dreamless Sleep. Regardless of how he might or might not feel about Draco, Draco wasn’t an option—and there was still one person left here who actually was. A person whom Harry actually liked a lot. So, if nothing else, he told himself as he downed the potion, he could make sure that he was well rested for his date with Perry tomorrow.
It was beyond frustrating, made more so by the fact that the more Harry wrote to him, the more Draco wanted to spend time with him. The man was funny, sharp, and self-deprecating, and his letters made Draco glad that he had his own suite of rooms to hide in, because he was sure that his constant dopey smiles would be utterly humiliating to have anyone witness.
“I didn’t, actually,” William told him, sounding as bored as ever. “My mother did. She’s been after me for ages to settle down, but I just never had the time, what with managing the manor. She was quite disappointed by my departure, but she’s delighted about dear Hilde, so it all worked out in the end.”
“Sorry, what?” Harry looked over to find Cormac even closer than before. Before he could say anything else, however, Cormac had leaned in and planted a wet, sloppy kiss right on his lips. When Harry tried to protest, Cormac thrust his tongue into his mouth.
Shrugging internally, he looked away before he could get caught staring and allowed himself a moment to absorb and appreciate the turn the night had taken.
to make Harry blush like that every time they made accidental eye contact? Teddy, luckily, seemed blissfully unaware of the tension, but Andromeda and his mother watched them with undisguised curiosity. Finally, Draco couldn’t take it anymore.
Draco dropped the expression when it failed to produce the desired reaction. “Nothing too exciting. Yourself?”
Harry was slightly taken aback, but after a moment, gave an internal shrug. It was unlikely to be worse than fresh pickled toads. “Sure.”
Tonight, he comes to my room instead of going to the one he usually uses. Under cover of darkness, he maps every inch of my skin until my entire body is on fire, and by the time he’s pushing into me, the only thing left in my mind, on my lips, is his name.
“Mmm.” Harry let his eyes fall back closed, and Draco reached out to push a lock of chaotic hair from his face. Harry’s lips turned up in a smile. The thought flitted across Draco’s mind that he could get used to waking up to this, but he pushed it firmly away.
“Have a shield charm ready, okay?” Harry knew there was no sense in trying to talk her out of her explorations, but he hoped he could at least convince her to keep her guard up.
The sentence was cut off abruptly as Harry just managed to dodge another blow from Smith, not realizing the trajectory of the punch until it smashed into the side of Lee’s head. Harry’s eyes went wide in horror as Lee’s hand flew to his temple, and he wavered worryingly on his broom. “Oh, absolutely fuck all of you,” he managed, before slipping sideways.
“So, Harry, now that you’ve met our contestants, how are you feeling? Anyone standing out to you?” He gave a knowing grin. “You seemed rather enamoured of Jack.”
When they’d finished breakfast (and good lord, Harry made amazing French toast), Harry said regretfully that he had a few more projects that he needed to finish and deliver before the end of the day, and Draco admitted that he should get home to help with food preparation for the party if he didn’t want his mother to murder him with passive aggression. With a lingering kiss goodbye and a promise that they’d see each other at the party tomorrow, they parted ways.
Once the door closed behind Pansy, leaving the two of them alone, Draco turned his full attention back to Harry. “It really will only be a few minutes, I promise. I just want to make sure I’m seeing all of the angles while I’m setting things up tomorrow.”
“Absolutely not.” Draco pulled the bottle of anti-nausea potion from the bag and took a large gulp, closing his eyes and tilting his head back as it took effect. “Salazar, that’s so much better.” His head dropped to Harry’s shoulder in relief. “Really, thank you.”
“Yeah, that’s pretty embarrassing for you,” Leela agreed. Now that they’d sorted themselves out, she was in a buoyant, playful mood; Harry thought that her decision to ask him not to choose her must really have been weighing on her. “What should we even ask them for?”
Draco took his shoulder and turned him, holding on to him so that he couldn’t move away again, and, with his other hand, tipped his chin back to force him to make eye contact. “I put in for a transfer.”
Blaise asked Perry a few more questions about what he’d been up to since the show ended and what he was looking forward to about the next season, which apparently had even more applications to participate than Harry’s had. Perry seemed to have won the hearts of rather a lot of viewers over the course of the show. Eventually, Blaise gestured for him to take his seat amongst the others. Standing, he turned to the group.
“Is that so? How interesting.” Her voice stayed calm, but Draco could see the glint of intrigue in her eyes. She never had been able to resist a bit of scandal, and although the unexpected pairing wasn’t quite that, it would certainly horrify Pansy’s parents if they knew. George Weasley might be a pureblood (if the Parkinsons even cared about such things anymore; he wasn’t honestly sure where the elders stood), but he was also
Teddy’s decorating style was every bit as chaotic and energetic as he was. He painted Christmas trees with blue and red stripes, put polka dots on bells, and dunked wreaths in the edible glitter that Draco had desperately tried to talk his mother out of. Draco, meanwhile, was entertaining himself immensely by decorating the gingerbread people to look like various party guests. He was particularly pleased with his messy haired, bespectacled Harry-biscuit.
“Of course,” Perry told him. “If it makes you feel any better, I stole his favorite hoodie before he left.”
At the back of the room, a door was propped open, leading to a space that seemed to be something between a courtyard and an alley; it was well lit and didn’t smell of trash or piss, but it wasn’t particularly welcoming, either, without any sort of tables or places to sit. Harry leaned against the wall, breathing in the cool night air for a moment, before looking down at his companion.
Snapping back to himself, Harry looked up at Draco and nodded. “Yeah, I’ll be here for presents in the morning before I head to the Weasleys.”
“Teddy!” came a hiss from the hall, and a panicked looking Harry Potter appeared at the door, his expression turning sheepish when he saw that Draco was both awake and under attack. “Fuck, sorry Malfoy. I tried to stop him, I swear.”
“Seriously, though, I’m sorry we haven’t gotten much time,” Harry told him. “It’s been pretty bonkers so far, and this whole group dating thing is just
“Definitely.” Harry’s smile was tired but genuine. “Come through the Floo whenever you’re ready; I’ll leave it open. I don’t want the chime to wake her up.”
Draco didn’t answer, and Harry was afraid to breathe. After a moment, though, Harry felt a warm hand brush tentatively against his, pausing as though waiting to be stopped before carefully linking their fingers together. Harry closed his eyes, suddenly aware of every square millimeter of his skin as his captured hand was lifted toward Draco and warm lips pressed softly against his knuckles. His heart gave a little stutter. “You’re a fucking idiot,” Draco said, but his voice wobbled slightly. Harry opened his eyes and turned his head to find Draco watching him.
“Of course.” Draco tried to hide his discomfort at the idea of seeing his young cousin. He’d only met the boy once, at Lucius’ funeral, when he’d been appropriately subdued—presumably either because he could detect the sober nature of the event or because he had been warned beforehand to behave himself. Draco wasn’t… good with children, particularly. He hadn’t really known any since he’d been an adult, if he was honest, and he wasn’t entirely sure how he was supposed to interact with the young Lupin boy. He himself had been horrifically spoiled, at least in terms of material goods—much to his own later detriment—but had otherwise been left to his own devices when he was not being trotted out as a political prop for his father. What did one
Eschewing caution, he decided to go to the Manor. In a brief moment of foresight, he donned his invisibility cloak before flying toward Wiltshire, letting the cool night air soothe his frazzled nerves. It was well into the evening, so he was hopeful that Draco would have escaped his parents’ clutches by now and returned to his rooms.
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” came the overlapping responses, and then the Floo flared once more, and he was gone—and Draco realized, with an aching surety, that a part of his heart had gone with him and was, in all likelihood, not coming back.
“Ooh, Harry, look!” Luna said, taking Harry’s arm and pointing at the board of specials. “They’ve got blood!”
Harry couldn’t figure out where to settle his eyes: on Draco’s pale hand moving over them both, on the flush rising up his chest, on his face, where his eyes had fallen closed and his mouth hung slightly open. He was beautiful, and Harry was getting close much faster than he would have liked. He bit down hard on his lip to try to bring himself back down again. “Fuck, Draco. Is this— ah, stop, wait.”
Harry’s heart ached a little at her concern. He reached over and pulled her into a hug. “You’re not. It’s not the same at all.”
“Great,” Harry said, inexplicably relieved. He hesitated. “This was a lot of fun, though. I had a really good time.”
Depressingly, ‘okay’ had been the kindest thing he could call any of the relationships he’d entered—and subsequently (and often quite rapidly) exited—over the past few years. There was never any
“In an ‘I’m going to send you home right now’ way or an ‘I also think we could be good together’ way?” Perry asked, obviously aiming for teasing but not quite managing to hide his nerves.
Harry sipped at his wine, tracking one of the fairies above them with his eyes as he pondered the question. “Curiosity, I suppose,” he finally said. “I’ve always been curious about you, even in school.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, feeling suddenly warm all over. “Thanks, mate. Both of you,” he added, looking over at Hermione. “I don’t deserve friends as good as you two.”
They spent the rest of the afternoon bickering good naturedly as Draco bossed Harry around, directing him to separate the pieces by color and then grabbing them out of his hand half the time to do it himself.
Draco considered him for a moment. “Well, as much as I’m sure everyone here would love to start day-drinking with you, the tour was only booked for two, so I don’t think they’d let us all in. But it’d be a shame to let it go to waste entirely.” He hesitated for a moment. “I suppose Pansy or I could go with you, though.”
Soon, Harry was on his back once more, Draco kissing him deeply even as he slid freshly-lubed fingers past resisting muscle, patiently working Harry open. By the time he’d slid a third finger in, brushing teasingly against Harry’s prostate and making him gasp, they were both fully hard again.
“Oh, I’m a chef!’ she announced, kicking off a lively conversation amongst all of them on their favorite cuisines and what restaurants they’d tried. Dermot and Romilda, it turned out, were both self-identified foodies, and Cormac had been to every fine dining establishment in the UK if he was to be believed (although Harry wasn’t sure if he was). Sullivan kept to a much stricter diet than the rest of them but was happy to share his favorite cheat foods and guilty pleasures. Soon, their half hour had disappeared, and the rest of the group was joining them.
Draco had meant it when he’d said he was content with his life in New York—his flat, his job, his routines. But being here, now, it was harder not to see the large hole that he’d been ignoring: the one that was shaped like people who cared about him, and whom he cared about in return. He hadn’t missed it here when he’d been in New York; when he’d left, he’d been fleeing, and he hadn’t believed that anything would be different when he returned. But it was. His family was different. His friends were different. The
Harry laughed. “No, they pretty much do, actually. Everyone comes to play from time to time, don’t they?”
Harry couldn’t help it. He burst into laughter. “Oh Merlin,” he managed eventually. “I’m going to have to set aside a whole wall for them.” He thought for a second and then snorted. “Perry’s might have to go behind a curtain or something. And I think Sullivan actually went for the wire and beads thing, so who even knows how I’m supposed to display that.”
“Wonderful!” she said, again. “Now we’ll move on to the long pose. For this, you have free choice of what materials you’d like to use. We have charcoal, of course, but there’s also paint or pastels or even a quill and parchment if you prefer. We also have some beads and wire if you’d like to do a more abstract interpretation. Harry has a very colorful aura.”
“Ah, the old house rivalries,” Harry said, smiling wryly. He had the vaguest memory of a peppy blonde ponytail occasionally visible in his peripheral vision as he spent an, in retrospect, somewhat obsessive amount of time watching Draco in the hopes of catching him doing something shifty. “Really limited our social circles, didn’t they?”
Draco thought about the Manor, and how hard it had been for his mother to finally let it go, even after everything that had happened there. “Yes, that makes sense.”
In an uncharacteristic show of sympathy, Pansy allowed Harry to return to the camp on his day off to actually enjoy the experience he had been promised the day before. He got a bit choked up at the offer, his emotions already all over the place from the past week, but when he tried to thank her, she waved him off, looking bored.
Harry raised an eyebrow and, when Draco didn’t drop his legs or his gaze, smacked him once more, making him groan and his head flop back as his cock twitched, giving him away. “Fuck.”
“Yeah, sure. Let’s head in.” Harry fished the theatrically ornate, oversized key from his pocket. “I actually have no idea what’s in here,” he confessed as he unlocked the door. “I sort of zoned out when Pansy was explaining it all.”
“God, please,” he heard himself gasp, moments away from coming but needing just that tiniest bit more. Obligingly, Harry reached between them with one hand, grabbing his cock and swiftly pulling it in firm strokes until, with a yell, Draco finally fell.
Draco watched as Potter was dragged to a spot beyond his hearing where he and Weasley immediately got into what looked to be a rather heated conversation.
Draco’s eyes flashed at the challenge, and Harry grinned, knowing he’d won, even before Draco thrust almost viciously back into him.
God I miss brunch. (Yes, this is all you’re gonna get on the whole societal healing process. I almost didn’t put it in, but I wanted to at least vaguely reference why Draco is apprehensive to be home but doesn’t need to be.
Sadiyah sighed and pulled her hand back. She curled her legs underneath herself, somehow managing to make the move look elegant. “Look, Harry. If I thought there was a chance—a real chance—for us to build something together, I would take it. But I’m not going to start something with someone whose heart already belongs to someone else. It’s not fair to any of us.”
“Nothing to worry over, I told you,” Luna said serenely from over by the window. “You might need to rest for a few weeks, though. Ribs are tricky things.”
Hermione rolled her eyes at his indignation. “Honestly, Harry, it’s not like you’re a particularly chatty correspondent. How else were we supposed to keep up with your life?”
“I promised Teddy I’d take him Christmas shopping. And he wants to get something for you, too, so actually you aren’t invited after all.”
Draco just stood, unable to come up with anything to say to any of this. He’d... known, sort of. Or at least, he’d thought he’d known. Maybe. But he hadn’t believed.
Draco opened his eyes again, seeming to steel himself as they met Harry’s. “No. Not yet. And certainly not like that. But I do. Love you.” He took a breath and then let it out shakily. “I love you, Harry.”
Apparently, the crowd cover was enough for her to be comfortable showing herself for a few moments—just long enough to wordlessly threaten his existence. With a sigh, he gestured for a third drink but obediently took it with him out onto the dance floor.
“Of course,” Smith continued, undeterred by the lack of reaction, “you never have minded trading off your fame, have you? Same goes for your little friends, riding along on your robe-tails.”
“I noticed that at Gladrags,” Draco agreed. “I can’t say I’m disappointed; most robes are incredibly unflattering, and they’re a bitch to maintain.”
“Is that so?” Malfoy returned the smirk, his eyes glittering with something promising. “Well then, good riddance. Definitely his loss—and our gain.”
“Don’t be self conscious, Draco, it’s perfectly natural. Harry likes to look at you, too. Why, just last night—”
Harry squinted at Draco, trying to parse his tone of voice before shrugging internally. He pushed the button for elf service and flopped into one of his armchairs, yawning widely. “Everything okay?”
good legs, Draco had to admit. It had been part of his initial attraction. It was a pity they were attached to such an oblivious bore.
Once they’d received their drinks—they’d both decided to try the house take on an old fashioned, which featured a peaty scotch rather than the traditional bourbon—Harry led them to one of the tall tables. Draco fiddled with his glass as he realized that, much like on their impromptu coffee date, he had no idea what to talk about—especially since he would maybe prefer for this to be an
“Thank you.” Draco stepped inside and closed the door behind him, slowly wiping the slush that had accumulated on the street off his shoes and smoothing his hair before deciding that procrastinating was not making this any easier. “I wanted to apologize,” he said bluntly, finally meeting Harry’s eyes. He wasn’t sure how to explain exactly what it was that he was sorry for, but thankfully, Harry seemed to understand.
Draco was still staring at the puzzle. “Based on this, something I think you might sorely need at this point.” He looked up. “You and Hilde are going to go volunteer at that children’s summer program you’re always on about.”
“Sounds good,” Harry agreed, letting Romilda’s hand on his arm guide him. As they walked, they chatted about the game earlier, Harry trying desperately not to laugh at Romilda’s impressions of Cormac. It eased the slight apprehension still hovering around the edges of his mind. Romilda wasn’t so bad. She was quite funny, actually, and she liked Quidditch, which was nice. Maybe they wouldn’t be a terrible match.
The group relaxed, chatting about the various activities they had open to them in the coming days. Harry allowed himself to tune out, watching tendrils of steam rise around them. He laid his arms along the edge of the tub, enjoying the juxtaposition of the nearly-too-hot water against the cooling night air. The heat eased the tension his muscles had built over the course of their travels, and he allowed his eyes to close as he took everything in—the smells of night air, pine, and the faint memory of woodsmoke; the sounds of bubbling water, crickets, and his friends’ chatter. Draco’s knee drifted to rest against his, thrilling and comforting at the same time—an odd mix of sensations that Harry had gotten used to experiencing in conjunction when it came to Draco.
Credit to therunningfoxes for the idea of Draco buying himself the little owl! I was already planning to have him go back for the snowglobe, and I loved the thought of him picking up a little remembrance for himself while he was there.
the outlines of what he wanted—someone who balanced but didn’t match him, who was caring but not sweet, full of sharp humor and soft touches—but every time he tried to plug the form of one of them into that space, to imagine building a home and a life with them, he couldn’t quite manage it.
Draco looked down again, feeling overwhelmed with emotion. “It’s gorgeous, Harry.” He swallowed thickly. “It’s perfect.” Harry smiled, looking relieved. Draco cleared his throat. “Well, go on, open yours, then.”
“I don’t know how she does it.” Ron’s voice came from Harry’s left, pulling him out of the almost-meditative state he’d fallen into as they walked. His breathing was heavy and his brow was damp with sweat. “She’s not even a little bit winded.”
“We just want you to be happy, Harry,” she’d told him earnestly, taking his free hand in hers and looking at him with eyes damp from a day of heightened emotions. “I know that you don’t like to be in the spotlight, but wouldn’t it be worth it for the chance to finally find someone? You deserve to be loved.” The words, the warm hand in his, the alcohol, the loneliness… they’d all come together in a perfect storm of vulnerability.
“I know.” He seemed to have already lost interest, however, and was off looking at a display case of games.
“Well, Cormac’s always been a bit of a tit, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he got on people’s nerves pretty quickly. Other than that? I can’t figure out a damned thing about Jack, so who knows, maybe they’ll get up to something sketchy when they think no one’s looking.”
“Shit, hold on.” Harry stepped through the open panel of the huge shower, wincing at the contrasting streams of hot and frigid water as he fumbled with the knobs until they returned to a warm, gentle rain. He let out a breath, pushing his once-again-soaking hair out of his face. “There, now it should be—”
The two disappeared into the house, returning shortly with several boxes of odd, unfamiliar-looking rectangular biscuits, bars of chocolate, and bags of marshmallows.
Tension broken, Draco rolled his eyes. “Good lord, Mother. Yes, fine, your party. What have you got so far?
“So these dates are completely off camera?” Harry asked Pansy. It was several hours later, and they were once again in his suite. He was growing sick of these rooms. Hell, he was growing sick of this whole experience. “What are you even going to put in the episodes, then?”
“That must be hard.” Blaise gave him a more theatrical look of sympathy for the cameras. “Was there anything else about today that made it all worthwhile? It looked like you had some good moments before all the drama.”
“Well, like I’ve said before, life is generally pretty crazy right now with my work schedule, so it would probably be kind of hard at first, I won’t lie. But I really am hoping to get my own practice going in the next year or two, which would give us a bit more space to breathe. So for now, it would probably mostly be evenings in—”
Harry reached out on panicked instinct, grabbing one of Lee’s arms before he could tilt off of his broom completely and slinging it over his shoulder. Katie Bell, having seen the scene unfold, dashed forward to grab his other arm, and together, the pair got him down to the pitch, where Luna and the Arrows’ Healer—an older witch called Gertrude Arzt—were waiting with their med bags. The rest of the players descended in somber silence as the gravity of what had just occurred dawned on them all.
Pansy sighed. “I was hoping to contact the Portkey station for Blaise’s luggage.” Blaise raised an eyebrow and she made a face. “I just don’t want to lend you my clothes! This whole… gender-fuckery fashionplate thing is cheating.”
Harry took a deep breath and tried to smile through his nerves. “Right. Well. Thank you all for humoring me today in my Quidditch adventure. It was certainly one of the less conventional games I’ve been to! And it was great getting to know some of you a bit more tonight.” He stopped and cleared his throat. “Unfortunately, though, as Blaise said, I have to send two of you home. When I call your name, please step forward.”
It was like a hazy mirror of the moment when Draco had first seen him—head held still, eyes searching his face, but instead of anger, they held something else, something Harry couldn’t identify.
Malfoy laughed. “Touché.” His smile turned wryly sympathetic as he went on. “Speaking of, I’m sorry about—” he gestured dismissively— “whatever his name was. What a dick.”
Harry obeyed, unwrapping the final gift in his lap. He took the snowglobe from its box and lifted it up to his eye level, taking it in. When he noticed the trio of little sledders among the other figures, he huffed out a surprised laugh. “Where on earth—?”
A choking sound came from the left, and Harry looked over to see Draco pounding his chest, red in the face.
Draco shrugged awkwardly. “It seemed a shame to leave it. And the elves had already packed your things; I didn’t think you’d be back, so I thought I might as well do it myself.”
“I know an excellent stasis charm.” Draco rolled his hips against Harry’s, sliding his erection against Harry’s groin and feeling immensely satisfied to find an answering hardness.
The British Quidditch League was small enough that, in order to keep the stadiums filled, a good number of friendly matches were held between tournament games. These were an opportunity to mix things up a bit—to try new moves, sub in reserve players, and play for the love of playing. Or that was the idea.
Harry had been starting to feel a bit flustered at Draco’s sincerity and was grateful at his abrupt return to form. “Prat,” he said, but he was smiling. And then, “Thank you.”
His resolve lasted less than thirty seconds, and he cursed his stupid brain even as he pulled himself to a rapid, spine-tingling completion. Determinedly, he decided that he would not allow himself to think of Potter for the rest of the day.
“Yeah, I think so,” Harry said, letting her pull his attention back from Ron’s endearingly odd explanation. “I mean, not right away; we want to wait for everything from yesterday to blow over, and he needs to tell his parents so that they don’t murder him when it gets out. And it’s still complicated. I mean, Merlin knows Montague has reason enough to kick me off the team already; this will be the final straw for sure if he hasn’t already decided to fire me. I have to figure out what to do if… well.” He grimaced, feeling himself slump. “If my Quidditch career is over.”
Draco stepped into the doorway, leaning against the frame and raising an eyebrow at Harry’s submerged form. His clothes were much more casual that he’d been sporting since they arrived — a well fitted but plain tee shirt and jeans — and Harry couldn’t help but think that it suited him extremely well. “Dilly didn’t say what you wanted. I thought I should check in now in case it was urgent. I’m going to wager no?”
Harry attempted a glare—which wasn’t remotely convincing given his obvious state of arousal and the fact that he was clearly trying not to laugh—but caved. “Cast your charm. But if the consistencies are off, it’s your own fault.”
It had been all over the papers and wireless, of course, and neither team had come out looking particularly favorable. Draco had been at least mildly gratified to see that Harry wasn’t being painted as the instigator; a few spectators had been interviewed who had seen Smith tailing him, and one woman had apparently been watching them through her Omnioculars and could see that he’d been keeping up a constant stream of taunting, although she couldn’t make out what it was. There was wild speculation as to what he could have said that would have driven Harry to hit him, balancing out the gleeful remonstrances against his ‘notoriously fiery temper.’
Harry kissed Draco’s lips, his cheeks, his forehead, his neck, and Draco laughed and pulled him closer, rolling his hips up invitingly. Harry ground down in response, and the friction was almost too much. Draco seemed to agree, as he pulled back from where he had begun kissing along Harry’s shoulder to say, “you didn’t happen to bring lube with you, did you?”
Harry’s jaw dropped, and his face went blazingly hot. She laughed, and Ron snorted as he grabbed his cloak to head out the door.
“You said it yourself, Harry. Every week, someone new. They don’t matter. They’ve never mattered. It’s…” And now it was Draco’s eyes welling, Draco’s lids dropping closed to hide his vulnerability, Draco’s voice sounding rough. “It’s just an outlet.” He swallowed and opened his eyes again, watching whatever series of emotions was likely flashing across Harry’s face, now that all his walls had been torn down. “I didn’t think that you. I didn’t—” He traced a thumb under Harry’s eye again, over his uninjured cheek, sliding his hand down the length of his neck and around until he was cupping his nape, but he didn’t lean back in.
And there we have it! I hope you all enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. If you want to say hi, you can find me over on
look normal, a skeevy bastard with a head the size of Jupiter, and an undercover reporter. Can’t say I’m particularly impressed.”
Malfoy shuddered. “Worse. They’re trying to arrange a marriage.” He gestured across the room with his head towards where Ginny Weasley was chatting with a pretty, petite brunette. “Not that Astoria seems particularly interested in that plan either, thank Merlin.”
“Much nicer than our last place in the woods,” Ron joked, coming up beside Harry and clapping him on the shoulder.
“Which is why I don’t,” William said with a sniff. “If I want to be outdoors, I can take one of the horses out or take my tea on the veranda. This is plebeian nonsense.”
“Hmm. I’ll just have to teach you, then, won’t I?” She gave him a flirtatious look, and Harry couldn’t help but notice again how pretty she was, her wide blue eyes glinting in the candlelight.
And then there was what Sadiyah had shared about how Hilde had treated Gabrielle sometimes. Hell, Nathalie had even accused her of trying to cause drama, although he hadn’t given it any credence at the time, as she was in the middle of being exposed as a mole. The whole thing left him feeling worn out, and he was hard pressed to pay much attention to what she said as they ate. What little he did catch seemed to be yet more about the places she wanted to visit and things she wanted to do there that, now that he was paying attention, Harry couldn’t help but notice sounded rather expensive.
“Oh, I don’t know. Contestants trying to poison each other to gain the advantage. Bachelors wandering into prohibited areas. You know. The usual.” Draco gave him a mischievous look, and Harry groaned.
Harry blinked silently at the vague silhouette he could now see highlighted just slightly by the moonlight filtering in through the glass doors. The wan light caught the barest hints of pale hair and skin but left the rest of him in shadow.
“Yes, I’m sure it will, once you spend the entire month planning and replanning every detail until you’ve got the whole household in tears.”
Shaking his head, Harry made his way downstairs, thinking that it might be time to pull out one of those nice wheat beers they’d found that went so well with a slice of orange. He’d barely reached the bottom, however, when an ear-piercing shriek had him rushing back up again.
Their final activity, it turned out, was a tour of the best Christmas lights in London. The bus meandered from place to place, stopping by the massive Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square, coasting under the glittering lights of Regent Street and Oxford Street, and gliding past the decadent window displays at Hamleys, all while a man with a microphone wove them tales of the city’s holiday history. Draco looked at the various displays appreciatively, but he found himself much more interested in watching the look of awe on Teddy’s face as they traveled from sight to sight and Harry’s delighted grin.
“Christmas Eve and housewarming combined,” Narcissa corrected. “We haven’t had a chance to share our new home yet, so this seemed the perfect opportunity.”
Near them, Blaise and Pansy were deep in conversation about something, while Ginny and Draco seemed to be having some sort of very intense debate, if their flashing eyes and gesticulating hands were anything to go by. Harry watched them for a while, his chest feeling a bit tight at the way the firelight flickered across Draco’s almost-white hair and high cheekbones. It was really fucking inconvenient how beautiful he was.
done had been vastly different than what he was doing now, most notably because the sledding of his youth had not involved him having Harry Potter settled firmly between his legs.
“So?” Harry asked, turning on his side to fully face him, not releasing his hand. His heart was beating so loudly that he thought it might be drowning out the crickets.
Harry grinned, helplessly fond. He crossed his fingers behind his back and stepped to a corner of the room. He had his suspicions about what had just happened, but he wanted to be sure. When he felt a slight brush against his arm, he asked quietly from the corner of his mouth, “Was that you?’
are you picking fights in bars with strangers? And when the hell is this happening that I’m not aware of it?! For Merlin’s sake, Harry, we’ve lived together for almost
“Oh.” Harry’s heart plummeted back downward, taking his stomach with it to land somewhere near his feet. “That’s… right, it’s fine, don’t—” He slid his hands from Draco’s neck and moved to step away from him, trying to hide his disappointment.
He’d brought it up with his friends once or twice, but he hadn’t really expected them to have a solution—so it had taken him completely by surprise when Neville Longbottom had approached him about an idea he’d had for a summer day camp for kids with difficult family situations. “Not only kids who are mistreated, although that would be part of it, but… anyone who could use somewhere to go, you know? Kids who struggle to make friends on their own. Kids whose parents both work. Kids who are a bit lonely.”
The bathroom was only slightly less suggestive, also lit with myriads of candles and with a huge tub very clearly sized for two, but at least there were no more rose petals. Harry wrinkled his nose. “At least there’s a toilet?” he tried.
“Let’s put you to sleep for a bit while we transport you, yes?” Luna offered, holding out a small bottle full of deep purple liquid.
Draco gave a put-upon sigh. “I suppose not. Although I do have a suggestion, should you get the urge to repeat the experience.”
“We’re going to start the class with a series of gesture drawings. Gesture drawings are where the artist has a short amount of time—generally thirty seconds to a few minutes—to complete a sketch of a model. It’s a good way to warm up and to begin to recognize the general shapes of a body without getting too caught up in the details. A light gesture sketch can also be a great skeleton for a longer figure study. I’ll demonstrate. Harry? Would you disrobe and step onto the platform, please?”
Draco laughed and held up his hands in surrender. “Fine, fine, I’m getting up. Go ahead downstairs and let me get dressed.” He lifted Teddy off of himself and pulled the covers back, swinging his legs over the side of the bed.
“I won’t make you stay much longer if you’re really miserable, okay? Let me just say hi to a few more of the kids and then we can leave for dinner early.”
“Wonder if it grows around here?” Ginny said speculatively, looking around as though expecting to see the rare plant sprouting from the nearby shore.
“I’m just glad she wasn’t allergic or anything,” Harry told Blaise. “That would’ve really put a damper on the day.”
Back inside, Harry went to visit the last few kids he hadn’t gotten a chance to see, leaving Hilde near the door. As he made his way back, he caught the tail end of something she was saying to one of the kids who was painting, looking down at them with a derisive expression on her face. “—not at all what a lion looks like.”
Harry pulled back again, his hands coming to Draco’s face, still looking like he didn’t quite believe what was happening. “You’re really staying? Like, permanently?”
” Harry laughed, and he closed the small distance between them, still smiling even as he pressed their mouths together.
After they had settled in, Blaise opened with his usual “How are you feeling, Harry?”, a phrase which Harry now associated with the uncomfortable sensation of trying to share enough to make Pansy happy while not giving enough to potentially embarrass himself later. “This will be your first one-on-one date of the show. Are you nervous?”
“Merlin, I haven’t been to Honeydukes in ages. I should stop in sometime, maybe pick up some sweets for Teddy.” He smiled, remembering afternoons full of sampling the strangest new confections with Greg and Vince, back before their world got so complicated.
The vast majority of the ground floor was made up of one huge, two-story tall room, framed on one side by the wall of windows they’d seen from the outside. It held a huge fireplace and an assortment of comfortable-looking furniture. The open plan led into a large, modern kitchen full of the latest magic-electric hybrid appliances, and a short flight of stairs led down to a games room and a mud room with a door to the patio. Harry was delighted by every bit of it.
a personal trainer. He chatted Quidditch with Perry and Romilda (who was working for the Department of Magical Games and Sports), gallantly did not roll his eyes as William went on about the many stresses of managing his family estate, and began to develop a string of theories as to what Jack’s deal was as they gave nothing but vague answers and mysterious smiles in response to any questions he tried to ask them. He even had a fairly normal conversation with Cormac, much to his surprise. He was still pretentious, talking about his supposedly rising star as a life coach, but he did also make an effort to ask Harry about himself, which was something. By the time things were wrapping up, he had successfully engaged with everybody and had not once done anything that he thought would haunt him forever.
Draco had arrived at breakfast sated, a tad sore, and almost impossibly happy. He should really, he supposed, have predicted that his father would manage to immediately ruin it.
He was glad of his prescience when they landed and Draco promptly fell to his knees over the toilet and vomited spectacularly. Harry grimaced, but crouched next to him, rubbing circles on his back. “What can I do?”
Sitting and watching the pair converse while Andromeda and Narcissa exchanged bits of news, occasionally looping him in to share tidbits about people he knew or ask about his upcoming plans was, again, bittersweet. Basking in the feelings of family, of belonging, but knowing that it was only for now; that he would be leaving in two short weeks. Still, he would do his best to enjoy it while he could.
Draco’s eyes fell shut at the sensation of it—the burn, the stretch, the unbelievable fullness. It had been a few months since he’d done this, but he would swear that it had never been this intense. Wrapping his legs around Harry’s hips, he pulled him down until there was no space left between them at all. Breathing heavily, he opened his eyes to find Harry’s face still inches from his, his green eyes burning. Harry leaned in, kissing him again, long and slow, and Draco let himself fall into it, sliding his hands into chaotic black curls and tugging lightly. Harry groaned, pulling back just enough to ask “Can I move?”
“I’m only one person, Harry. Me putting myself in danger for no reason wouldn’t have… how much difference would a single person have made?”
Malfoy looked up from where he was examining the Billiards table. “Much, thank you. Those automobiles are evil; I can’t understand how Muggles stand them.”
“Yeah?” Leela asked, lighting up. “I wondered, but you’re fairly ethnically ambiguous overall, and it felt rude to ask.”
The elf that they called was perfectly happy to bring them a Wizard Chess set, which relieved Harry; he’d been half afraid that Pansy would have instructed them not to give Harry anything to do in order to force him and his date to spend the entire night talking or doing… other things. They played—evenly matched in their complete inability to plan their moves ahead—until they were sleepy. He was grateful, when they said goodnight, that the bed was so huge; it made things much less awkward than they could have been.
stop.” Draco closed his eyes for a moment. “I did not need that mental picture even a little bit,” he sighed. Still, he couldn’t help glancing over his shoulder in the direction that the ginger had retreated. George was leaning against the bar, talking animatedly to—
Perry stayed silent for a moment. Then, “Was I being shitty?” he asked, quieter. “When the sprinklers went off?”
Lucius didn’t deign to look back up at his son. “I signed on your behalf. As patriarch, that is my right.”
Blaise gestured for Harry to continue, so he did, running through the list he’d been consciously building in his head over the last couple weeks and unconsciously for quite a long time before that, when he thought about it. “Compassion and empathy are top. I don’t think I could be with someone who didn’t truly care about other people. Someone who believes in equality, and fairness, and doing what’s right. So much of my life has been, and still is, about making the world a better place, so finding someone who understands that is important to me. I’d also like to find someone who values family, whether blood or chosen—someone who takes care of the people they care about and will be happy to spend time with all the people who are important to me.”
“Hardly,” Blaise sighed. “She’s too busy trying to make sure she snogs every single person in her year. I think perhaps she’s planning to follow in Mother’s footsteps and marry rich.”
“You’re welcome to tell me,” Draco answered on a gasp as Harry began to move, biting his clavicle before kissing down his chest. When he licked over one nipple, Draco’s hands flew to his hair of their own volition. “Fucking hell.”
“Why on earth aren’t you just hiring a house elf agency to handle this?” Draco asked in exasperation as he sorted through the stack of parchment his mother had dropped in front of him. “This is absolutely ludicrous.”
“Yeah. She’s sleeping now, thank god, but I don’t think I’m going to make it out for dinner tonight. I’m exhausted, and I’m not sure when Ron’s going to be here to pick her up.”
“Well.” Draco took a breath to regain his composure and then rolled onto his side so that he was facing Harry, meeting his gaze. “I was hoping that you might let me fuck you into this very comfortable mattress, but I’m open to suggestions.” He sounded confident, but he was biting his lower lip nervously.
“I mean, not really,” Harry said, startling himself with his own surety. “He’s had my back the whole time I’ve been here. He’s done a really great job making sure I’m comfortable and managing things when they start to get out of hand.”
Draco’s eye snapped open, and Harry witnessed the impressively rapid succession of expressions from irritation to realization to mortification before he squeezed his eyes back shut and groaned. “Fuck.”
Sadiyah nodded. “Yes, but luckily, I haven’t had to hide anything from him—we got together after I witnessed his son having an accidental magic incident. They were both so panicked; I was really glad to be able to help them understand what was happening. I ended up getting really close with both of them, and—” She shrugged, and Blaise smiled.
“There you are, Draco,” Blaise drawled. “I wondered what was taking you so long up in Harry’s room.” He’d donned a black, satiny blazer that he was wearing open over his skirt; Harry immediately recognized it as the one Draco had worn to Pansy and Ginny’s New Year’s Eve party several months ago. Much to Harry’s amusement, Blaise still wasn’t wearing a shirt.
Draco seemed to be somewhere else entirely as Pansy continued with her instructions, standing at the window and looking out at the grounds, where it was once again raining. Harry watched him, something tugging oddly in his chest.
Harry said, and then trailed off, unsure how to continue. “And,” he said, finally, “I’m honestly scared of answering that question.”
Harry snorted. “Fair point.” Glancing behind himself, he asked, “Is it okay for me to do this here? We haven’t really talked about…” he gestured vaguely, presumably to indicate the rest of the house and the people therein.
Narcissa opened her mouth to respond, but Draco was saved by the chime of the floo in the next room. Andromeda had left to collect Teddy from school, so Draco gratefully took the excuse to cut the conversation short to answer the call.
“Well, first things first,” Blaise opened, “how are things between the two of you? Still going strong?”
As soon as the cameras shut off, Harry let his head flop against the back of his uncomfortable armchair. He was exhausted, but he knew he had a final debrief with Pansy and Draco to get through before he was allowed to pass out.
Harry just continued looking at her. He felt numb. Wasn’t it enough that he was here, putting his heart on the line in front of the whole country just for a chance to find love? The humiliation of realizing that even people who were supposedly here because they wanted a chance with him didn’t actually want him was too much.
Blaise smirked right back, unphased. “You can comment on my sailing when you’ve learned how to so much as start the boat yourself, darling.”
“Fair enough.” Harry grinned, a dimple appearing in one cheek that Draco found he very much wanted to lick. “I was pretty much just afraid that I’d hit on you and made a fool of myself. You?”
Luna straightened and shrugged. “Gregory’s just put the first pizza in the oven, if you’d like to come down.”
Draco obliged, sliding up until he was properly settled with his head on the pillows. Harry followed, climbing over him to brace on his forearms, his knees between Draco’s legs and his chest brushing Draco’s chest, every touch of skin on skin lighting Draco up from the inside. He leaned down and kissed Draco again. “You’re so fucking gorgeous,” he breathed against his lips before dipping to once again run his mouth over Draco’s neck. “You have no idea.”
friendly, per se. Not antagonistic, at any rate. But certainly not platonic. He blushed at the memories and then held a pillow to his face and groaned in frustration, willing his erection to go down.
. Draco leaned into it, bringing his hands to Harry’s waist, the rough wool of the coat beneath his fingers grounding him as his mind threatened to float away entirely. His tongue darted out just slightly, flickering against Harry’s lips, and Harry met him: a touch, a hint, a promise.  It was, Draco decided, the most perfect kiss he’d ever had. He bit Harry’s full bottom lip lightly before pulling back, and Harry shivered. “So…
“It’s an American Muggle television programme,” Hermione tried, and he shook his head at them, clearly baffled and too far gone to do anything about it.
When they eventually separated, with a peremptory kiss on the cheek and a brave attempt at a sincere ‘good night’, Harry went back to his room and flopped on his bed, staring morosely up at the ceiling. He was not looking forward to tomorrow’s debrief. It was fairly clear to him that he was going to be sending Hilde home at the end of this round; they obviously wanted very different things from their lives. But even beyond that, there was the lingering doubt he kept coming back to that nobody at all was here because they were genuinely interested in him. Did everyone have ulterior motives that he just hadn’t seen yet?
“As much as I love a good warm ale in a dirty glass,” Harry smirked, and Draco laughed. “So, see you tomorrow, then?
“I know, I know!” Harry sat back up and gave them both a pleading look. “It’s just too soon to say, okay? I need some time to process tonight, first. It’s a lot to think through, and I’m exhausted.”
“Duly noted.” Harry flattened his palm, caressing down Draco’s side and then up his arm, his neck, finally cupping his face and leaning down to kiss him. “That was really nice,” he murmured against his lips.
“Aunt Narcissa likes to play chess sometimes, but I think she likes her pieces,” Teddy said, watching a set of little knights threaten each other. “Do you think she’d want Gobstones?”
“I…” Harry was a bit at a loss for how to answer that. “I mean, I guess I can understand that this isn’t what you expected. I didn’t plan these dates, so I didn’t know this was happening until yesterday, either. But it’s the most personal thing I’ve gotten to take anyone to do since I’ve been here. You’re getting the truest look into my life of anyone. That’s romantic in its own right, isn’t it?”
“Hmm. I attend them from time to time, I suppose, but truthfully, I can’t think of anyone I would want to invite to something like that. The people I know are more… ‘networking cocktails’ acquaintances than ‘invite into your home’ acquaintances.” Draco felt a twinge of loneliness in his chest as he said it, even though he was currently surrounded by people. Remembered loneliness, he supposed—or possibly anticipatory. How had he spent eight years in New York without making one friend close enough to have over for dinner?
“I was a Black, once,” she said. “I, as much as anyone, know what it is to be raised in a family of pureblood idealogues. And I also know what it is to wish to protect your family at all costs.”
Draco was silent for a moment before answering. “I don’t think it’s stupid to want to find love. And I’m absolutely positive that there are at least some people here who came because they’re genuinely interested in you. You just have to filter out the idiots, first.”
“I never said— That is to say, why would you think—” Draco could feel a nervous sweat beginning to bead his forehead. How could they possibly have been caught already?
“‘Fraid not,” Harry said as he smoothed Draco’s jacket sleeves down and stepped back. He was smiling, but it looked almost apologetic. “Goodnight, Draco.” And he Disapparated with a
“I can imagine.” Blaise gave an obviously well-rehearsed (to Harry, anyway), genial little laugh. “Would you say that otherwise it was one of your better dates?”
Once they had thoroughly explored the market stalls and Teddy’s energy appeared to be waning, they got their hot chocolate and found a small table where they could rest for a bit before Harry ushered them onto Platform 9 3/4 to the Apparition point. Draco raised an eyebrow and Harry gave a sheepish grin. “Next stop is half an hour away by bus, and I’m a bit knackered. I figured it would be fine to cheat just this once.”
once and for all. Cheers!” Raising his glass of champagne, he toasted the room at large, hearing his
Their dinner arrived shortly after Hermione departed, baby in tow, and Draco grabbed two plates from the kitchen to divide up their food. Harry had already set up a DVD for them to watch, and Draco examined his television with interest. “I’ve heard about these magi-electric hybrids, but I haven’t seen one. I live in a mixed building, so we just have standard Muggle electronics.”
“You’re not wrong.” Harry went to take a sip of his champagne and realized it was empty. “Do you want another drink?”
Harry leaned against a wall at the back of the large ballroom, observing the crowd. The space was teeming with players, sponsors, higher-ups from the Department of Magical Games and Sports, and—of course—press. Everyone was dressed to the nines, Muggle formalwear and dress robes blurring into an indistinguishable mass of expensive fabrics.
Potter’s eyebrows rose just a fraction, but he didn’t comment, which Draco found himself oddly pleased by. “Okay. It’s a date.”
Ginny returned the look with interest. “Never been my style. Never been yours, either, I don’t think.”
I tell him I was almost sorted Slytherin, but that he pissed me off so much that I begged the hat not to put me there, and he looks shocked for a moment before he starts laughing.
with one another. He’d even talked at some length with Neville Longbottom about the trials of being the last heir in a long line of purebloods with no interest in reproducing, Neville tipsily admitting that he had never had much interest in romantic relationships and was perfectly happy with his kneazle and his plants, despite his grandmother’s growing frustration.
A selection of lounge chairs had been requisitioned from somewhere—probably the boat house—and Draco, Pansy, and Blaise were all lying prone in various states of undress, apparently enjoying the summer sun. Hermione was on a fourth chair, an umbrella shielding her as she studied the house guide, and Ginny sat on the edge of the pier, legs dangling in the water, looking bored. Luna was nowhere to be seen.
Harry stopped mid-sentence, eyeing him as though trying to read the truth of his statement on his face. “You don’t?”
Harry laughed. “Well, my mum’s family came from a pretty disappointingly bland suburban British neighborhood, so I don’t really feel the need to visit there, and the Potters seem to have been here for centuries, from what I could find. But I dunno, India might be cool.”
was not something he was even ready to contemplate. “It doesn't matter. The point is that that doesn’t mean that
of the crew would be, actually; the remote cameras in the cabin meant that they hadn’t been around for days. After searching the gardens fruitlessly for what felt like hours, cursing their size, he checked the pool area, still coming up empty. He decided to head back to the house to check if Draco was in his rooms, only to remember that he had no clue where in the house Draco was even staying. Finally, he decided to just do what he probably should have in the first place—go back to his room and call an elf to ask for their help.
Their next bust, they were on together. A small Neo-Death Eater group that the department had been keeping an eye on, but who hadn’t done much of anything until now, had suddenly decided to make a grand statement by threatening a large-scale attack on Diagon Alley if their (entirely insane) demands weren’t met. Needless to say, the Ministry was not interested in negotiation, and the whole Auror force had been called out en masse.
“I am NOT the only person here who didn’t grow up with Muggle stuff,” Ron grumped. “In fact, you two are the only ones who did!”
They returned to shore as the sun was setting, and as soon as they were out of their safety gear, Harry flopping onto his back right there on the dock, utterly exhausted.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and looked up at the sky. “I dunno, ask if you wanted to get out of there and then try to sneak off while Ron wasn’t looking?”
The Falcons were up by 120 points when Draco saw it. Unfortunately, his opponent had spotted it as well, if her sprint across the field was anything to go by. Draco swore and flattened himself against his broom, speeding forward as fast as he had ever flown, determined.
“Yup! I was telling him all about this gorgeous bloke I met whose attention I can’t seem to hold because so many people are trying to seduce him all at once.” He grinned mischievously, and Harry blushed but managed to keep his composure.
, and now he was faced with the prospect of spending several hours with a man whom he might have made any number of horrifying confessions to—some of which he wasn’t even ready to confess to himself. All he knew for sure was that there had been enough physical contact that he could feel the ghost of Harry’s heat against his shoulder, down his arm, along his palm. He ardently wished that he could forget that, as well.
Ron smiled fondly. “That’s my girl.” Harry bumped his shoulder against Ron’s and they continued apace.
She rolled her entire head back in apparent disbelief. “Oh my god, how are you this stupid?” she muttered.
The door opened, and Andromeda leaned against the doorway, an unreadable look on her face. “Care to tell me what that was about?”
Harry didn’t think it was all that much later when they made their way downstairs, but realized that it must be further along in the morning than he’d thought when seven heads turned to look at them as soon as they reached the foot of the stairs. Before he could think of anything to say, Pansy, Ginny, and Blaise broke into a round of applause and wolf whistles. Luna was smiling, and Hermione and Greg both looked quietly pleased, if a tad embarrassed.
Harry (“We’re on a date, Draco; that’s a bit past surnames, don’t you think?”) had shown up in a casual but flattering ensemble of well-fitted blazer, jumper, and dark-washed jeans, looking comfortable, confident, and not at all like he’d scoffed at the idea of going out with Draco just two days before.
“Alright there, Harry?” He leaned against the railing as well, a bit closer than was probably strictly necessary. He was once again shirtless, and Harry couldn’t help but glance at his chiseled abs before meeting his eyes. Cormac looked extremely self satisfied at that, adjusting his position slightly to better show off his musculature.
Draco sighed. “I was coming to see if you’d eaten anything. Luna said that you would probably need food after posing for that long. Apparently, it’s harder on your body than one would imagine.” Harry nodded, grimacing at the still-present pain. Draco shot him a disapproving look. “I’ll have the elves send a pain potion up to your room. Can you make it on your own?”
Despite the constant teasing and touching, Draco managed to learn a lot about Harry over the course of the evening. In turn, he shared quite a bit about himself. Harry seemed to be an interesting mix of adrenaline junkie and home body. Half of his weekends were made up of babysitting and gardening and quiet nights in alone or with friends, while the others were filled with hiking adventures interrupted by terrifying wildlife, or attempting to fly places he’d never been only to get blown off course by a blizzard, or getting his arm hair singed off while visiting a dragon reserve. Draco was sure that some of the stories must be made up, but Harry swore up and down that he wasn’t embellishing a thing. Draco thought his own stories might pale in comparison, but Harry still seemed entranced by his tales of spontaneous travels abroad and museums full of strange and obscure artifacts and hidden restaurants or clubs that one could only find if they were in the know.
“Of course you are. The contract has been signed,” Lucius said dismissively. He opened his paper once more.
“I’m not giving it up,” Harry reassured her, and now he was smiling for the first time since he’d entered the room. “I just came from a meeting with Oliver Wood.” Her eyes widened in understanding, and then she was grinning, too. Harry turned so that he was facing Draco and took his hand, squeezing it. “Their Seeker is retiring at the end of the season. He wants me for Puddlemere next year.”
After breakfast, Harry, Ron, and Greg—as the three who were likeliest to cook—ended up going to the small grocery store in the town nearest to the cabin. The refrigerator would supposedly let you order your groceries directly, but all three had agreed that they much preferred to select their own ingredients rather than trust the reliability of relatively new magic-electric technology. Draco and Hermione had both offered to come with them, but Harry had managed to convince them that three people were more than enough to do the shopping. Draco had pouted, but capitulated when Harry promised to bring back cocktail ingredients. Hermione had offered to write a detailed meal plan and shopping list, but Ron managed to dissuade her.
“Everyone thinks we should just let you idiots figure yourselves out on your own,” she said with a glare, “but it’s our last night here, and I’ve had rather a lot to drink, and I am going to murder you both if you don’t get your shit together.”
Draco watched him for a moment before mentally shaking himself. “I need more coffee,” he declared. “Anyone else?”
“Don’t be a stranger,” Blaise told Harry with a wink, biting his lip suggestively. Harry shook his head, laughing as he wandered off toward his friends.
