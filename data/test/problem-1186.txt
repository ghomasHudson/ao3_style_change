His face is splashed on at least two thirds of all their issues with accompanying headlines that range anywhere from 'Harry Potter, Savior Thrice-fold?' to 'Harry Potter's secret relation to neo-Death Eater Jack Willows!'
“Right!” Sophia exclaims. “The project!”
She claps her hands together - which makes a slightly odd noise, due to all the rings on her right hand clinking with all the rings on her left hand. “Oh, then I
“Come on,” Harry says, walking over to pull his friend up. “Let’s get to bed.”
Their family has been active recently - their parents, their uncle and aunt and grandfather, all alighting one by one on the beach. Hatchings are a delicate time. As a caretaker, Draco must ensure their safety during the event, but he can only approach the nest alone, and under the close supervision of a half a dozen anxious, fire-breathing dragons. Thus, most of the set up - the food and the baths and towels for washing - must be prepared beforehand, off site, and then transported there the day-of. And no one, not even the family, knows the exact day.
“And the Dursley’s, too.” Harry lets out a little chuckle, laced with bitterness. “Maybe Dudley, my cousin, I could forgive, since he was so young, but my aunt and uncle…I just...don’t understand why they would-” He stops.
"Er, it's not my first time hearing him perform. But his playing is still impressive."
“Malfoy!” Malfoy does not stop. “Oi!” Harry runs to catch up with him.
The blonde turns around and only has a split-second's notice to prevent the package from smacking him full in the face, but he does it - barely. "Merlin, Harry. What is this?"
Harry gives her his information - he has long chosen to carry around at least one Muggle credit card in case of situations such as these. Granted, opening a tab at the jazz club that Draco works at has happened precisely once in his life, and otherwise he hasn't really had much use for the card, but the paranoia of being caught without money is a persistent one of his. He suspects it has something to do with never having an allowance from the Dursley's, but Harry tries to never linger too long on that train of thought.
“No,” Malfoy admits, “But I wasn’t straight either,  so I could tell.” He’s still lying on the ice, completely ignoring Harry’s extended hand. “Lie down with me.”
That's right, Harry gets presents during Christmas as well. He was so caught up in his hangover and in explaining his situation with Draco to the Weasleys that he'd forgotten.
“...Yeah?”
It’s gotten to the point where she and Molly have a running rivalry for who can cook the closest to the James Potter from Harry’s memories. They’re an odd sight to behold in Chinatown: two bonafide white grandmothers walking the streets, haggling with amazing results, and dining at almost every single eatery available to them. Thanks to them, Harry’s gotten to taste not just food from the Hunan province - where his father was from - but also food from Sichuan, Canton, Shanghai, Xi’An, and more. Never in his life has he been so well-fed.
She sits back and smiles, regarding not just Malfoy, but both of them. "Very well. I take it both of you have somewhere to be...?"
There's not much recognition of the name among them - except for Hermione and Arthur.
"We really enjoyed the pre-reading you assigned."
“Harry.”
They sit in silence for a few, heavy moments. The house is dark and quiet, not even Kreacher’s feet scrabbling on the wooden floor can be heard.
“This is where the staff lives. That is Amira’s cabin, that is Prasad and Walker’s, and this is mine.” Draco points to each one in turn. “Since Prasad and Walker share, and Amira shares with her wife, the dragon veterinarian who visits occasionally, you’ll be staying with me.”
“No,” his voice a growl, “it’s not okay.” Harry throws his arms around Draco and squeezes tightly. “It’s not okay at all.”
"No, no, no," Ginny snatches the pair of trousers from his hands and thrusts what looks to Harry to be an identical pair into his arms to replace it, "These are much better."
The snow is freshly fallen here, unbroken and thick. Little vegetation. Far from anything that could be broken. In other words, the perfect snowball fight battleground.
"The Death Eaters, they came to recruit me," he gasps. "I didn't want to, but after the arson, I was afraid. Please, Robards, Minister, you have to understand - my wife is pregnant. I couldn't-I didn't-"
He doesn’t answer, and reaches for the trowel. “You should go back.” The sunlight beats down on them both. “It’s hot out.”
“Yeah, I think so. ‘Mione’s still here, though. She should be waiting outside.”
Sophia and Lucas, having finally decided on a topic, beam up at him. “Well, professor! We’ve decided to research chord progressions,” Sophia explains.
"You lo-o-o-ve it."
Harry wonders how Draco is doing, but never owls him. He hopes that he's okay. That the children and Pat are doing okay as well. He wonders how they're carrying on with their lives even after everything they’ve known has turned into ash. Sometimes he even envies them; at least they have a concrete reason to want to cry, to want to disappear.
“I think that I forgive you.”
The rest of the group nod in assent and they begin the trek back to the castle. While doing so, Malfoy falls to the back of the group to join Harry.
For lunch, they picnic on the beach. The wind that blows is warm, today, and it carries brine and salt. The storm has completely dissipated now, unhindering the sun’s shine. Draco watches the men stretch out in the afternoon light. Thomas takes off his jacket and lays it on Finnigan’s dozing body. Weasley begins to snore openly, his head a mop of red in Harry’s lap.
Though Harry’s all-too-aware of every single pair of eyes on him in this moment, he steps forward anyway for Draco’s sake; he deserves a proper introduction. “Everyone, this is Draco, my date tonight.”
A Muggle man with a moustache jumps in, tears in his eyes, "I've been following you for ages. Tonight was indubitably your best concert yet. Thank you so much."
“You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.” Harry holds up his hands. “I was just wondering.”
He begins to feel very hot all of a sudden. This is what they get, being so annoying. Harry tries to convince himself that this is actually an advantageous development in his friendships with Ron and Hermione: maybe now they'll finally leave me alone. Maybe this will teach them to mind their own business.
“I’ve...never thought about that before.” Malfoy’s hands are carefully folded in his lap, and he’s staring intently down on them.
The castle looms at last, after the sun has begun its descent. Harry touches down at the Lake and walks the rest of the way.
“Yeah.”
“Did I wake you?”
“No, it’s not.”
And there it is. Their wands, in the open at last.
Harry’s painfully aware of the barista at the counter, who’s cleaning out one of the machines and probably listening  in.
“How is it different?” Draco presses.
"I don't blame you, then," She says as he winks and takes a sip of her drink.
Harry takes the hint and nods, though secretly uncertain that he’ll be able to make it tomorrow, either. “Yeah. Be careful.” With a wave, he’s off, walking briskly through the halls, heading for Kingsley’s office.
The door closes behind her, and it's just Harry, Ginny, and Luna in the bedroom now. It's past six now, and the sun has long set, but Luna is still looking out the window, into the darkness.
It's either Hermione or Ron. Those are the only people in the world for whom his wards allow access.
“The Nursery,” Draco speaks, just loud enough to beat the wind, but no louder.
“They think you’ve changed.”
“...Fine.”
Taunting him, Draco calls back to Harry over his shoulder, "Need some guidance,  Harry?"
“Do you both…know what you’re doing?”
the sleepyhead?”
He’s right, but Harry’s already in too deep; he has no choice but to push on. “Don’t worry! They’ll love you!” Malfoy raises an eyebrow at that, but strangely, Harry finds himself believing his words. “I promise! It’ll be fun.”
For one brief moment, Harry even entertains the idea of going to see him at the jazz club tonight, but quickly trashes it when he reassesses his mental and physical capabilities at the moment and finds that he will most likely not even have the will to leave the bed today, let alone get dressed fancy again and going to a Muggle jazz club in the middle of London. Harry feels bad for one moment before it passes just as quickly as it came.
When Draco sneaks a look again, Harry’s head is drooped low and his quick fingers knitted together at his forehead - a man defeated, a man stripped away.
From the water, a shriek rings out. “Fuck, it’s cold!” Finnigan exclaims. Weasley splashes him, and the two begin chasing each other, fighting and getting wet.
“What are your other ones?”
“A bit nippy, though.”
A hand shoots up. It's Jenny, one of the most veteran and respected people in the department, other than Robards and Kingsley. Harry's always liked her, though they never really have any contact with each other. Due to her experience, Kingsley's always sending her on high-level, top secret missions - the details of which even Robards can't access. Harry really only ever sees her back in the office once or twice the entire year.
Robards is there in a flash. He knocks Harry's door open, sees Edwards on the ground, and crouches over him. "Edwards," he barks. "For Merlin's sake, stop your crying."
Harry settles on the couch; the blankets are warm and the pillow is soft and when he closes his eyes, he’s completely enveloped in Malfoy’s scent.
Harry can't hold back a yawn. "Good morning, Lucy. Who's that one from?"
Draco hums in response and falls silent. Harry crawls into bed with him and hugs him from behind. “Thinking about kids, huh? Who’s the father?”
"Sorry," Harry blurts out. "I can change. It was a long day."
He savors their looks of confusion. It has always been his favorite part: the drawing back of the curtain.
Harry’s face, in the near-dark, is unreadable. “Okay. I won’t.” His fingers turn a sprig of grass over and over. “Sorry.”
Lucy has returned to her parents and now joins the rest of them in eagerly watching the match and anticipating the winner. Both Draco and Harry have a broom in hand: two Cleansweeps, which are extraordinarily old school by now, what with all the fancy "Pulsar 3000"s and "Andromeda 4000"s nowadays, but they still get the job done. They're reliable and have the same specs as each other, which is all they really need for this contest.
Another long sip. "That was only a bonus."
The second half of the performance is noticeably different from the first. While even a musical novice like Harry could tell that the first half was mostly mainstream music - crowd pleasers - the second half is composed of stranger sounds. It still sounds like jazz: it still has the flashy parts and it still makes Harry want to sway and tap his foot, but the sounds are...different. In a a good way. It's like the notes are heavier than usual, like sponges filled with water.
Harry’s technically supposed to be helping Hagrid around the castle, but
Outside the room, Harry suddenly hears an avalanche of footsteps and muffled shrieks. Draco groans and nestles further into the covers. It must be present opening time.
"Bullshit."
“Is it dinner time yet?” Rose yells as she continues swinging.
“You think I was born knowing? It’s part of the job.”
Draco touches Harry’s cheek, cool fingers on warm skin. “Harry. Someone’s calling us, love.”
Dreams come full force like they do nearly every night, but it’s been ages since Harry dreamed of
“Th-that’s not true-”
wedding. With Ginny.”
Arthur thinks to himself for a moment. "I don't think so. We put the children to bed soon afterwards, anyways."
“W-why would he faint?”
Harry and Malfoy walk inside, the former heading straight to the living room, where he knows everyone will be. Molly and Arthur; Bill and Fleur and their daughters Victoire and Dominique; Charlie and his boyfriend, fellow dragon researcher Ion; Percy and his wife Audrey and their daughters Molly II and Lucy; George and Angelina and their children Fred II and Roxanne; and Hermione and Ron and Rose.
"That's fantastic!" Bill enthuses. "They're perfect together."
In the middle of a crowded elevator, Harry Potter is stunned out of his reverie.
"Er, yeah, hang on." He pushes the door open a little wider and takes the bouquet. "You can come in." Then, he turns into his house and searches for something not-ugly to house such a nice gift.
“It’s starting. Prasad and Amira are already there, and Dr. Khanyile is on her way. We should hurry.”
“I am going to owl her. Soon,” Draco speaks his promise to the sky.
When the men stumble out of their cottages the next morning, bleary eyed and hands up to shield from the rising light, Draco is already packed and scanning the horizon. A V of geese slash through the low-lying clouds, and the sun has begun to lift the dewdrops to its embrace.
"What will it be, sir?" Her eyes reflect the blue and purple rays of light bouncing all over the place.
Charlie gives his two cents, glancing at Ion. "Romania's already been working on something similar for a while - their Ministry of Magic, or their equivalent anyway, is pretty liberal."
While Ginny, Luna, Hermione, Ron, Molly, and Arthur contribute to that chatter and try to pass off as Muggles, Harry nods along and listens in on the Muggles' conversations. He perks up when they mention Draco.
Rose can’t resist piping up, “I’m gonna be a sister!”
“It is wonderful to be able to meet all of you - and it’s the first time here for all of you, correct?”
The defensive fort member can't even react. A snowball hits him between the eyes - courtesy of Sophia - and he goes down too.
Maybe he should get a dog.
"No," Harry glances back at his group and catches Hermione's eye, which gives him a wink, "It's okay. Do you want to sit down somewhere?"
A week passes, then two. After a few days of training, Harry seems to settle into his new job; he organizes the paperwork and makes schedules and charms every guest that steps through the doors.
bachelor’s trip-”
Something in Draco stirs, then. An animal waking, its maw opening pink as it yawns. The glint of recognition as it lifts its head, and sees, across the way, another creature rising, too.
Draco takes Harry’s hand, and lets himself be lifted.
Harry replies on reflex, “Can’t next week, ‘m helping Hagrid out over at Hogwarts. For Christmas decorating.”
“I was in the fores’ with Gawp when it came! Read the letter an’ maybe got a little too excited - I think the centaurs are mad at me again.” He shrugs. “Oh well. More tea?”
Harry would like to comply with her order, but Malfoy's giving him a look that indicates that he may have some serious trouble doing so. The blonde sends a snowball Harry's way, and it splatters at his feet, gets on his sock, and proceeds to rapidly melt. Wincing but undeterred, Harry throws the two snowballs he's made not at Malfoy, but at one of the fort-builders. The poor student yells an expletive as the snow seems to fall down his shirt and touch his bare back, but continues building.
Hermione waves a hand dismissively. “It doesn’t matter. Names are just names.”
Draco begins flying away from Harry immediately, though it seems more like he's also searching rather than he's already found the Snitch. However, Harry doesn't want to take the risk - Draco was less distracted than him after the release - so he begins to cruise right behind him just in case it's the right direction after all.
Harry looks over to Draco. He’s smiling, but it's tight-lipped. "Fantastic. But I am sorry to say that the children cannot join us, as the bar is still 18+." This elicits a round of disappointed groans from the children.
For once, Harry's isn't the last one to make it to the meeting. One by one, the teams either trek in, faces grim and feet dragging slush all over the floor, or skid in, out of breath and robes haphazardly thrown over their clothes. In comparison, Harry seems completely put together. The only people missing when the meeting begins are Jenny and Ash, but Harry assumes that they're currently working hard trying to negotiate with the Muggles.
that he was involved in something like
Gordon stops speaking with Robin and turns to the group. "Time's up." Harry notices that he has a Muggle watch strapped to his wrist. Things have definitely changed from when he was in school.
“Er….yes?”
Besides, Draco swears the third floor is haunted.
The entire elevator is silent save for the two witches squished in the corner.
“But-”
It's just Harry again. Just Harry Potter buried in his bed with the windows drawn in his empty bedroom at Grimmauld Place. The house is mostly silent, save for the occasional groaning of the infrastructure as it settles in. And the neighborhood is usually quiet as well, even though Harry seems to have a lot of families with children for neighbors.
"Yes." Hermione beams. "And she's overjoyed."
Shush, shush, the rain brushes the shingled roof, and collects at the edges.
s and the occasional Kreacher, who mostly just tries to rescue and organize the piles of unidentified rotting foods. In between cleaning, Harry stands, half-propped up by the kitchen table, and watches the sun’s decline.
In the distance, he notices the reporters inch closer and closer, eyes gleaming by the light of the dying fire.
He draws their history, their ancient rivalries and epic battles, their clashes with wizardkind; each claw and fang and tearing howl. They crowd forth with their questions. Draco answers all. Surrounded by behemoths and a staggering, untouchable history, every guest Draco has led to this location becomes childlike in their wonder. Their bodies shrink, but their eyes grow with firelight. Curiosity, so often pushed down in their adulthood, rises again like sparks in the dark air.
Malfoy meets her in the middle and they shake hands. "Good game," he repeats to her with a warm smile on his face.
Malfoy moves on to other students after that, and Harry spends the rest of class trying to help Sophia and Lucas with their project mostly by obeying their instructions (“Can you look up the definition of these words on page 93 and repeat them back to me?” “Can you call over Professor Malfoy for us?”). By the end, Harry has gained little-to-no knowledge about chord progressions - though he does figure out that music has some kind of connection with magic through physics - but he has thoroughly enjoyed himself. It’s quite freeing to be in a classroom environment again without any of the actual responsibilities of being a student. And not to mention the attractive professor who always seems to be looking at him.
The game of House that the children have been playing seems to be winding down as well - Victoire, the oldest of them all, is reading a bedtime story to the rest, who are laying perfectly still on the floor. Harry can’t tell if they’re playing bedtime, or actually going to bed.
A beat.
As soon as he turns the corner into the sitting room, the music stops. Andromeda is sitting in her favorite cushy chair, right in front of the fireplace, with her knitting piled in her lap and the basket next to her. Draco Malfoy is seated at the piano. Both of them are openly staring at Harry.
But now is not the time. Harry bustles over to the bathroom to shave and wash his face and take a piss - not necessarily in that order. Not even bothering with his bedhead, Harry inspects the contents of his closet afterwards and emerges with the only button down shirt he owns - the one Hermione made him buy when they went to a fancy Muggle restaurant for Rose’s birthday last year.
Suddenly, Harry realizes the background noise at the table - Rose’s enthusiastic slurps, Hermione and Ron’s conversation, and the gentle clinks their spoons made against the bowl - have all stopped. He looks up, and all three of them are looking right back at him.
Harry looks up, his brows furrowed. “It isn’t that simple.”
"Oh, I'm sure. I think that even the Ministry would be very impressed with the idea." Hermione leans forward. "I've heard rumors for years now that they're trying to expand the Ministry's Magical Research department. They're just rumors, but I think that they have a lot of truth in them. In comparison to Ministries globally, Great Britain's is near the bottom - research-wise, at least. But don't tell Arthur, and especially not Percy, that I told you this. I heard it from Ron."
“...Yeah.” Harry knows better than to lie.
Andromeda smiles and speaks slowly and softly, “Draco is family. We’ve been in contact for a while now. I just...didn’t know how to bring it up to you. Don’t worry, Harry.”
“Dra-”
“You and Longbottom…”
of fabric. “Don’t stay out too late.”
Now that they're done eating, the children dash off into the living and continue their game from before dinner. Only Lucy remains, still sitting comfortably in Harry's lap and finishing off her dinner. Harry has been regularly cutting up the scraps of food too big for her so she can actually eat.
“Yeah, it’s getting late,” Hermione says, never once taking her eyes off of Harry. “We’ll go now, but call us if you need anything, okay? Our fireplace is open - the wards will let you in.”
“I’m glad you like it. It’s one of my favourite Muggle restaurants in London.”
“Draco…” Angelica begins to cry again.
True to his word, once the last of the dishes are cleaned and stowed away, Harry dashes into their bedroom and comes out with a box - simply wrapped, with a poor attempt at a ribbon bow on top. He holds it out to Draco. Draco takes it.
"Fine. He's thinking about proposing."
"So, Potter. What do you think? Have I converted you?" His gaze is so earnest, so open. It throws Harry off a little bit; it's a look that he never felt comfortable sharing with Harry during Hogwarts, after all.
They laugh and settle into sleep.
"I felt it. Me and Hermione and the others - we all felt it."
But he’s a fool. Hermione catches up easily and takes both his hands into her own. “Harry,” her voice catches with hesitation for a moment, “I think you need to see someone. I’m-” Harry groans. “-worried about you.”
“I heard from Ron. That you were thinking of skipping work today.” Her hands are rested on her hips.
“Wh-where did you find this?” Draco breathes.
So he makes the executive decision to, basically, not give a fuck.
On cue, the lights dim and people begin to find their seats. Harry slips into a small table at the very back of the club; he knows he should greet Belle, Ava, Pat, and the children, but he convinces himself that there's no time. That they're busy right now and he shouldn't bother them.
Harry listens to Draco’s heartbeat. His head rises and falls as the blonde’s chest rises and falls.
"What do you mean?"
“School? Do you mean the private one that he speaks of occasionally?”
“Malfoy…?”
Next Friday is Draco’s 38th birthday, and Harry’s been planning a surprise party for months. Andromeda and Teddy are hosting and the guest list has gotten long. The Weasley’s are coming, of course. Belle and Ava are too, along with Jonathan, whom they adopted from the Harmony Orphanage two years ago. He’ll be joined by Pat and the rest of his friends from the orphanage who haven’t aged out already. Angelica’s flying down from University of Edinburgh, where she’s taking summer classes, and Dan’s taking off from his part-time job at
When class ends, the students pack up and leave one by one until it’s only Malfoy and Harry left. “Would you mind collecting the books with me?” Malfoy asks.
Harry leans in close, and Draco leans away. “Not the part about you being a prick.”
Sophia reaches the fort first and faces off against the one fort builder who managed to get back on his feet. He turns around and in his hands are dozens of snowballs that he starts throwing one by one in a wild barrage of exploding snow. Since his back is turned to Harry and his attention is focused on Sophia, Harry tries to use this chance to sneak up and grab the wands from behind their fort - the unfinished section, but a particularly hard snowball explodes against the back of his knees and Harry goes down.
To Harry's surprise, Draco reaches him in one stride of his long legs and takes Harry's hand, sending tingles up and down his spine. "I think I can bear it for one night. Next time, I'll choose your outfit, if you let me."
Harry braces himself for the obvious follow up question, but it doesn’t come. In fact, Malfoy doesn’t seem to react at all - the look on his face, at least from the side, is faraway, distracted.
One by one, he goes through the rest of the clutch the same way, until finally, when the fifth baby is drooling over its food, he lets himself fall to the ground, body outstretched and chest heaving. The shards of broken eggs lay around him, like black snow, and the babies stumble through them and sniff at Draco’s head.
The piano is beautiful, too. Even from the back, Harry can tell how shiny the paint is, how easily it reflects the spotlight. Even the bench is nice. Harry vaguely remembers the one from the orphanage being a flat wooden one with chipping black paint, but this one looks more comfortable - the seat itself seems to be a cushion rather than just pure wood.
A drop. Then two. Then all at once.
Molly is the first to speak. "My. He's certainly as good as they all say he is."
The drastic change in topic gives Harry a bit of whiplash. "You mean during the War?"
Draco turns away, that gray fatigue still curled around his shoulders.
Footsteps sound from the stairs, and moments later, Draco appears in the doorway. He's still wearing the same clothes from last night, but the buttons are all done up now, the wrinkles from sleeping in them are gone, and his hair is once again styled in an elegant blonde swoop. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and Harry can't take his eyes off the skin it exposes - and the Dark Mark that remains there, unfaded and as ominous as ever.
Draco sobers up in record time. And then proceeds to blush. "You've got to stop that," he says so seriously that Harry panics, trying to figure out what he did wrong.
Ron checks his watch - Harry’s wedding present to him - and says, “You’d better hurry up. It’s 6:50.” Harry idly wonders why he got Ron a watch but didn’t bother getting one for himself.
With horror, Harry realizes that Draco and his gaggle of fans have gotten dangerously close to his location without him noticing. He doubts that Draco will be fooled by his pitiful disguise, so he quickly ducks away, toward the donation table.
“What have you found so far?” Harry can’t help but ask.
“I’ll owl you.” Neville stands and makes for the door, but turns at the last moment and says, “I care about you, Harry. I hope you’re happy.”
in number, in volume, in everything. Harry swears he sees Headmistress McGonagall choke a little on her pumpkin juice.
"That's wonderful!" Fleur exclaims with a slight French accent, faint now after years spent in Britain.
As they step off, Ron waves to the man he's been chatting with in the lift, "Bye, tell Henry I said Merry Christmas!"
"As you all know," Kingsley begins, "Jack Willows, one of the main leaders of the recent neo-Death Eater movement has escaped from custody after he turned himself in claiming the
“Potter.”
“Hey,” Draco says, looking up at Harry through his lashes.
“Oh.” Harry never knew Narcissa to be particularly altruistic. But then again, he’d thought that about Malfoy too.
The blonde smiles slyly, as if he’s sharing some inside joke with himself. “A few things. I’m currently following a lead that seems to be very promising.” Harry has to stop himself from flinching at the memories of the all-too familiar cubicle that the words “following a lead” conjure up for him.
“Explain, then.” Harry’s voice is hoarse, thick with an intense emotion, and it coils in the pit of his stomach - shaking his insides up with every passing second that his eyes stay latched onto Malfoy.
Following the address written for Harry, the group find a nearby apparition point and walk the rest of the way to the club. The street it's located on - Ravel Avenue - seems to be a hub for music clubs of all kinds - jazz, blues, and some others that Harry doesn't recognize or remember ever hearing about. It's a niche place for sure, and most likely even more so for the Wizarding community. Harry wonders how Draco learned about it.
“Wow…” Harry looks back at Draco, a wide grin on his face, then gestures to the ground they walk on, the grass crowding the riverbank, the goliaths of stone cutting the sky.
“Hey,” Harry whispers, nudging Draco, who’s slowly but surely nodding off in his arms.
Fang’s successor, Cane, hears Harry before Hagrid does; he paws and whines at the door, already smelling and recognizing his friend.
Draco washes and towels off the baby. Its clawless paws cycle the air, and little mewls escape from its jaws. Through the towel, Draco can feel the nubs on its skull - the beginnings of the lustrous horns that take hundreds, even thousands of years to grow to their full length. When he’s done, he sets it down in front of the food. It snuffles at it, its eyes still wrinkled closed, but dutifully eats the first meal of its little life.
She beams at him and replies, "Of course, dear. I hope it keeps you warm."
He has a point, most of their school years have been premised on competition - from Quidditch to schoolwork, everything has been grounds for fights, for comparison. Hell, just the other day they faced off in an intense snowball fight! Despite all the years in between now and Hogwarts, this, at least, has remained a constant in their relationship.
"Thank Merlin you're alright." Ron sits on Harry's bed and leans over and gives him a tight hug. "You're lucky i haven't told 'Mione yet."
Ron rubs the back of his neck with agitation. "It's Jack Willows. He's escaped."
Just that thought alone manages to send Harry into a fairly peaceful sleep that night, the first one he has in weeks.
The same fears.
on him, that’s how receptive he is to his unspoken thoughts, but he knows he would never without his consent.
Ginny sighs and rolls her eyes, "Sometimes I swear
With every sentence she speaks, Harry watches as Malfoy's eyebrows rise higher.
Rifling through the files as he walks, he grows more and more bored by the page. Their knowledge about the group seems to have remained relatively unchanged; they know the identities of most of the leaders, but not much else, no knows relations, addresses - nothing. There’s nothing for the field groups to go off of, which is the key to a successful arrest or bust.
"I try to come most nights that he's here, and I know that he has something special planned tonight. I couldn't make it to the one last Christmas, but I heard it was incredible - he even started planning with his elbows at one point!"
This close, Draco smells Harry. A fresh scent. Heady.
Harry plops down on the chair opposite Hagrid. "Tell me what?"
“Do you still remember how to ice skate?” Malfoy asks without turning around. Harry looks out the window and realizes he’s looking at the Great Lake on the horizon.
“I mean
“I think I understand, a little bit.” Harry pauses, then begins again, slowly this time, “Since before I was born, most of my life was already laid out for me. There was a prophecy. About someone killing Voldemort.”
Somehow, the thought settles Draco - that his mother also dreads the empty letters, and dull, careful small talk. That she stares too much at the vial as well, and touches it just to remember what it was like to touch the real thing. That she, too, walks her waking hours and lies unsleeping at night with torment and love warring in her heart.
Draco’s silent for so long that Harry thinks that he’s fallen asleep. And when he does speak again, it’s only a whisper, “Only if you invite me again.”
More than once, Draco had come stomping into the house, cursing and peeling off his stained, sweat-soaked work gloves. They were the ones he used to do everything, from gardening to manure collection, but although he has grown accustomed to almost all the dirty realities of his job and lifestyle - muddied, sweaty hands remained a sticking point.
As he does every week, he walks the cobbled path to the small house, listening for the tinkling of the piano. But he doesn’t hear it today.
All these clues, Draco has hoarded, and slowly, he has begun to piece together a terrible, terrible image.
The professor next to her turns to look at whoever she just nodded at. He’s familiar: blond, snooty-looking with an ever-present smirk. So familiar, in fact, that Harry swears he saw him just yesterday.
"What's Malfoy doing here?"
“I love that one!” Says the older girl from before.
"I completely agree-oh, after you." The two people Harry has been eavesdropping on reach the door at this point, wave at the man posted there who Harry assumes is the bouncer, and walk in.
Just one simple noise, one finger to his lips, and Harry obeys without question. Harry doesn’t know if he can bring himself to say anything even if he wanted to.
She nods, hops off his lap, and follows her gang of noisy cousins into the kitchen. Hermione and Ron stand and Ron looks back on them before going through the archway. "You two coming?"
George gasps in response. "Oh, that's right! I’d forgotten about that." Angelina swats at him.
"Good game." Harry smiles wide. "You had fun, right?"
“We’re friends from school,” Hermione explains to her brightly. “The rest of the group are three other of his peers and my in-laws.”
He turns to the pair of students working beside him and asks, “Could I just watch you two for a bit?”
want?” he barks at him.
Slowly, Harry traces patterns on Draco’s skin. “I don’t think she knows what to say, either.”
“Merlin.” Harry rubs his face wearily. “Mind helping me up?” Ron obliges and the two just stand in the bathroom, leaning side by side on the counter for a while.
Malfoy summons up a small smile and reassures her, “There’s nothing to apologize for.”
"Right. I don't know...green?"
The two leave the bedroom and head into the living room, where only his fireplace, liquor cabinet, television, and dusty couch sit. Kreacher is nowhere to be seen, and he doesn't come to wave Harry off. Not that Harry really cares.
The older girl and the older boy that the woman had walked in with scramble for the door in a panic. Malfoy asks above the pandemonium, “Where are you two going?”
Dinner goes well.
“Draco?”
“Not true. You remember
Draco goes to use the washroom, and when he opens the door to step out, Prasad and Walker block him, and they crowd him back in and close the door.
Voices float in from the outside - raised voices. Draco is certain the one yelling the most is Weasley, though the individual words cannot breach the walls.
“Hi.”
“Er…” Harry’s caught off guard for a moment. He’d expected Neville to fly into some sort of rage, not speak so quietly that he has to strain to hear. Not sit calmly in his seat, hands to himself. “I don’t know. What do
“Wait.” With one arm, Harry stops Malfoy in his tracks. The latter twists around, his face cold. A wave of realization hits Harry and he emerges from its froth with his head suddenly clear. “You think Neville and I are dating?”
A thin, feeble whisper, Draco says, “Maybe she didn’t
"H-hello." Harry whispers.
“It’s okay,” Draco lies.
Spring comes. The streams flush with snowmelt, and on their banks, the wildflowers begin to bud. Once shriveled and gray, the grasses fill and thicken with green - and when it rains, a sweet smell lingers on the wind for days afterward. When Draco walks the valleys and hills, now, the foxes rustle the brush. When he walks the birch forests, deer dart at the corners of his vision. Snowdonia unfurls like long petaled blossoms beneath his feet, and the clouds above crisscross the bright sky.
He’s sitting in a cushy armchair in front of the fire with a spotted cat on his lap. The clock on the mantle ticks away the seconds and the flames crackle and snap. Distantly, Harry hears the rumble of thunder, but no rain.
Harry tightens his embrace. Draco is warm. The room is warm. The sun has set and fog hasn’t quite lifted, but there is still something burning, here, between them.
“Yep,” Sophia chirps. “Now let’s go strategize.”
"We're doing well. It's my first time hearing Draco perform, and I'm pleasantly surprised so far." Hermione stands up and the two women exchange a handshake.
Ron grins, “Yup. Said he was
“I-er-I’m good.” With more confidence: “Yeah, I’m actually doing pretty well.”
“Well, sometime after that then.”
The dream slips away from him as Harry gasps and wipes away a bead of sweat on his brow. When he reaches for the glass of water perched on his nightstand - probably courtesy of Kreacher - the dream is almost completely gone. The only trace remaining is Malfoy’s face at the very end: a little bit greener than usual, eyebrows drawn, and eyes wide.
“When I go, promise me something.”
"I second that." Ginny turns to face him, and her face is serious.
Draco doesn't wrinkle his nose in disgust like Harry half-expects him to at the mention of Hagrid; instead, he looks thoughtful. "I can understand that. Even if the Manor weren't seized, I think my mother and I would've gotten rid of it anyways. It was too big, even for three people. And not to mention the memories that lived there..." He trails off and takes another sip of wine from his glass.
Harry nods.
The textbooks in Harry’s arms are beginning to painfully cut into his flesh. “Yes…? Why else did you think-”
A pause. Then, slowly, “We could have been friends. If at Madam Malkin’s…”
12 Grimmauld Place is quiet and empty when Harry gets in. As usual. He flops on his couch, not bothering to shrug off his robes or changing for his date, and dozes as he waits for a knock at his door.
It used to happen more frequently when they were in school together - namely fifth year, but those dreams either bordered on nightmares or turned into something else entirely, something more...embarrassing.
Robards still looks pissed - like a tea kettle boiling with the lid sealed shut - but he can't let out any steam yet, not in front of Kingsley. Taking a deep breath, he begins. "Brown, Jones, Robinson, you three are our main connection between the agents in the field and the Ministry - me and the Minister. Each of you will be in charge of closely monitoring a group, and you will be responsible with reporting and documenting their movements as well as staying up to date with their safety.
He nods slowly, not trusting himself to say anything.
Draco moans after he swallows. “Delightful.”
“Of course.” Malfoy looks at Harry. “Can you handle this one?”
“Start from the beginning, then.”
"Oh? You have good taste," Draco jokes.
” He shakes his head before handing Harry a steaming cup of tea and taking a long sip from his own.
“Goodnight, Draco,” Harry whispers, pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Heat rises to his cheeks. “It’s really...nice.” And it really is. The atmosphere is quiet, intimate, practically engineered for romantic dates. It also helps that there aren’t many patrons on a Tuesday night, so the staff seems relaxed and content and the ambient conversation never gets too loud. Harry sips on his glass of ice water to give his hands something to do.
Draco takes them to the coast, where the grass and rocks turn to fine-grained sand, and the sky kisses bae ceredigion - Cardigan Bay.
Harry's leg begins to shake violently under the table, and he has to consciously stop himself from rattling his chair and disturbing others. No wonder the field teams look so knackered. After the war, the Auror department has shrunk by quite a lot. There simply wasn't much of a use for them anymore other than the occasional contraband item bust, guard duty for top ranking Ministry officials, and ongoing criminal investigations - that is, until very recently.
"I'm guessing this is about Hermione." Harry feigns ignorance, but Ron knows him better than that. He doesn't respond, just stares at him with an eyebrow raised.
"That's sounds incredible!" Hermione looks at Harry. "How did you know about it?"
They glance up from the desk, peering through each glass wall. “They’re really taking their time, aren’t they?”
"Come in?"
They don’t walk very far. Draco opts to take them to Llyn Trawsfynydd, instead of his originally planned, more treacherous hike.
"I have an idea!" Rose shouts, and the yard quiets down at once. She sticks a finger up in the air and declares, "I think both Uncle Harry and Uncle Draco should fly with me. Like what they just did."
“Bloody hell.” Malfoy says as soon as they’re back out in the hallway and the secret corridor has sealed itself once again. He sighs, runs his hand through his hair, once, twice, and straightens up to face Harry. “Right. Now off to the Burrow?”
“She’ll love that.”
"These are for you." Using his wand, he levitates a good majority of the pile over to him.
"Yes. I take it you didn't renovate it?" His voice is light, joking.
“And you’ve met Draco already, haven’t you?”
The entire Ministry buzzes with activity around Harry; after such a high-profile event like the orphanage burning, it was impossible to keep the investigation a secret any longer. The media - save for The Quibbler, which has kept its reporting serious and unbiased - has gone mad from pure glee. They revel in every attack. They rejoice at every failed arrest. But most of all, they salivate at any and all sightings of Harry Potter, the Auror they believe to be at the front of the entire investigation.
Malfoy fiddles with his scarf and mumbles. “There wasn’t a piano, obviously. And I was a bit busy around that time, if you’ll recall.”
“Yeah, thanks,” Harry replies, scratching Cane’s stomach. The dog whines and wriggles on the floor in pure ecstasy - his tail hitting the floor so hard Harry can feel its vibrations through his boots. He’s smaller than Fang was, and even though he’s undoubtedly an adult dog, Hagrid insists that he still has some growing to do.
Draco’s namesake seems to twinkle in greeting. Most other constellations come and go, depending on the time of year, but Draco never sets. Always and forever, whether Draco looks up or not, the dragon twists on in the dark.
“Through study.”
He thinks. "Well, I did my best. Couldn't protect everyone, though." Mad-Eye Moody. Tonks. Remus. Sirius. Fred. Just thinking about them gives him a tender ache in his chest - it's gotten less piercing over the years, but never has it gone away entirely. He doubts it ever will.
“N-not at all! Everyone stays through Christmas Day.”
His bitterness poisons his voice. Draco isn’t sure who it’s indicting.
“Ready?”
"Dad..." Bill, Charlie, George, and Ron groan in unison.
He could-
He groans and rubs his face.
Harry unfolds the paper he left him, and scrawled inside is indeed the address of the Amber Tap. He refolds it and stuffs it into his jean pocket.
“Take it.”
Hermione and Ron are beaming, practically glowing with happiness. This is basically what happened when they announced they were pregnant with Rose - only Molly had actually fainted then. Progress.
“Let’s go, then.” Malfoy stands and buttons his coat. Pointing to the uneaten half of Harry’s portion of sandwich, he asks, “Are you going to finish that?”
The gully between Draco and the others shrinks a bit. When before, Draco could see the other side, but never cross the staggering jump, he joins in on the fun, now - ribbing and joking and flashing his silver tongue. And when he banters with Prasad, he finds it hard to stop. Especially when Harry is laughing and laughing and looking at Draco like he never wants to look anywhere else.
"Ash, Jenny - sorry Gawain - I'm changing your initial order. You two are with me now. I think that if I am going to try to communicate with the Muggle Prime Minister, I will require your assistance."
His coat is gone, his green collared shirt is untucked, and his hair is even messier than it was at the beginning of the night when Ginny purposely messed it up. Below his dark eyes lie a darker-than-usual set of bags, and his lips are cracked and dry. He moistens them, a little bit self-consciously, even though no one is there to see him anymore. Except for maybe Kreacher. But he’s seen him at his worst anyways, and is probably used to it.
Prasad cuts him off, “I wouldn’t doubt it.” A beat. “Seriously, though, are you going to be okay?”
“It probably would’ve made more sense to me if I had done the reading. I wish I had known about it earlier.”
"And what you were doing in Auror Potter's office?" Kingsley asks.
“Let’s get this over with.”
Internally cringing, Harry tries to answer his question as best he can without revealing too much, “Oh...you know...working at the Ministry.”
"Hermione calls it my 'Hero Complex."
Afterwards, the group of men quickly make their excuses and retire early: Thomas and Finnigan into the left cottage, and Longbottom and Weasley into the right. Only Harry remains.
coat - and brushes past Harry as he leaves. After a second’s delay, Malfoy’s cologne washes over him and it’s minty. Harry unwittingly takes a deep breath of it. As soon as the front door clicks shut, Harry slumps into a chair.
“...Thank you for reaching out, Harry.” Neville’s suddenly all sobered up, looking intently at Harry.
Harry cradles his head in his hands, forlorn. "I don't know what I did wrong!"
Draco inclined his head. So that was how they were going to play it.
“I mean - you must think this is all so...dumb. She didn’t even live with us. It was only an occasional thing and even during the War when she was there at the Manor she was busy with other things anyways and you were
“Yes,” Harry says without hesitation. “I promise.”
Ginny runs up to Rose and scoops her up in her arms, sending the child into a fit of giggles. "Rosie, I think that's a great idea. You're so smart!"
Hope you enjoyed this fun little chapter as much as I did writing it! Next chapter is going to be a long one, so get ready for that!
From downstairs somewhere, Harry hears some dishes clatter and hopes that it's Kreacher. And also hopes that he's making breakfast to take up for him.
“Maybe. I don’t think I would.”
That night, they gather in Draco’s cottage to play Muggle cards - poker, mostly, though they switch to Old Maid after everyone takes pity on Longbottom’s losing streak. The rain has mostly abated, though thunder still strikes out in the valley from time to time, an open threat.
After gently prying his arm out of Draco's grasp, Harry sits up and surveys the scene. His jeans are draped on the edge of the bed - which he actually remembers taking off. He scoops them up, gets out of bed, and wiggles them back onto his body. This way, at least, his snitch boxers won't be on full display to Draco and anyone who could walk in at a moment's notice.
” Lucas rolls his eyes and doesn’t rise to the bait.
Draco starts, meeting Harry's eyes again in surprise. "What?"
"Shh. I have more to say." Draco clears his throat. "I hope you want the same. Because even though we're both... a little fucked up-"
“I don’t know much about all of this. I didn’t get out much as a child. And the last time I went camping…” Harry trails off. “Well. It was a long time ago.”
“That sounds fun. I've always wanted to go ice skating.” She yawns. “I’ll leave you to it, Draco. Going to lie down for a bit. Nice to meet you Harry.” With a wave of the hand, she’s gone, leaving Harry alone in the kitchen with Draco Malfoy, a baby, and a few small children who’ve been tinkering away at the piano during their conversation. Harry is beginning to sweat a little.
His words seem to have set Draco alight. His eyes sparkle as they open wider than Harry's ever seen them. "Are you sure? A magical energy?" He digs into his small shoulder bag and produces a notebook. "Tell me everything, in as much detail as you can remember."
And Harry suspects that Draco would've happily taught late into the night, had Arthur not poked his head out of the door and called them in: "Food's ready!"
"Musical Theory. The class focused on my own research surrounding music and its roots in and effects on magic."
Her voice is a whisper. “Harry. You know why I’m concerned about you. Last time you did this y-”
They take their leave, and with one final wave to Pat and the children crowded on the doorstep, they round the corner and are alone again.
There is nothing in the box, as is Malfoy family tradition. Everything that once was Lucius Malfoy is now contained in two vials: one in Narcissa’s coat pocket, the other in Draco’s. He fingers it, the glass warm with body heat.
Harry looks down at it, but says nothing. It’s not a secret - Draco keeps it in the open, and he still, occasionally, takes it with him. A few times, he has caught Harry staring, perhaps trying to make sense of it. But he has never asked outright.
“The Giant Squid.”
So they walk, unsteadily through the dunes, the wind pulling at their jackets.
"Splendid. She'll be a great big sister."
Headmistress McGonagall, in the years that she's occupied the Headmistress/master office, has really made it her own. The entire space is neater, cleaner, with fewer papers and knickknacks and other magical artifacts lying about. The desk still sits in front, as well as two armchairs facing it. The bookshelves form a perimeter around the room, and the portraits line the back. A nice, ornate rug is the only thing decorating the floor and the fireplace burns bright and crackles in the silence of the room.
“Neville. Listen.”
“Rose, this is Mr. Malfoy, my-uh-guest.” Harry winces internally at the slight stutter he couldn’t stop from slipping out. “Mr. Malfoy, this is Rose Granger-Weasley.”
“Ye-yeah. I can do that.” Harry pretends to leave and make a call, but really sends a Patronus Draco’s way, wincing at what his response might be. He tries to make his message seem like everything is alright, but he can’t stop his voice from sounding panicky.
"I don't know!" Harry flounders. "You said you wanted to talk about ‘us,’ and that it was serious. I just assumed-"
“Y-e-s?” Without meaning to, Harry’s voice rises at the end as he’s practically grappling with Draco, trying to keep him steady and on his feet. “It’s fine. Goodnight everyone.”
Harry had sent a Patronus ahead of their arrival, giving them a brief rundown of the situation, and asking them to refrain from potentially inflammatory comments. And a promise to explain once it's all over. But again, in hindsight, maybe he could've explained a little better.
Harry thinks while adjusting his broom in preparation to kick off,
“Malfoy?”
"Fine," Harry whines, but his cheeks are red.
“Exactly the one." A sigh. "We were so sure that he'd been
"Hey," the redhead greets Harry as she plops onto the couch next to him.
“So, what about you, Potter? What have
They both step back as a reaction to the pain, cursing and wincing. Malfoy stares at the books scattered on the floor in silence before his shoulders hunch in defeat. “You’re in charge of the heavy ones. And hurry up, I’m already late,” he quips at Harry. He then scoops up the smaller, flimsier paperbacks and continues stomping down the hall again - maybe with a little limp this time.
Robards opens his mouth, clearly about to go off on one of his infamous tirades, but Kingsley raises his hand and he falls silent. Even Robards, the arrogant, pompous bastard he is, doesn’t dare cross the literal Minister of Magic.
"Harry," Hermione whispers, leaning close to him to that her mouth is close to his ear. "Do you feel it too?"
"Wow." Hermione leans back in her chair, her plate clean. "I'm guessing you drew a lot from Arithmancy?"
Harry grunts noncommittally. “So, your mum.”
"The owner of The Amber Tap, yes," She confirms, gesturing at the entire club with a big sweeping motion of her arm. "The best, most authentic jazz club with the best, most authentic jazz players in London."
They don’t speak much, which, to Draco, is even stranger than his new, domestic reality with Harry Potter. Since the conversation they had in the cabin, when Harry first arrived at work, they haven’t conversed about anything more personal than the warming weather, work, or food. Anytime they’re alone together, Draco keeps bracing himself for the inevitable, intrusive question, but it never comes.
Draco rubs his face. "What I'm trying to say is - it would be easy for us to fall back into our old habits. And to enable each other. Which is not what I want out of this."
Harry's attention snaps back to his group. "Huh?"
“Good.” Hermione gestures to the food laid out on the table. “Would Rosie kindly try my cooking? It’s a new recipe.” Rose practically leaps into her chair.
Malfoy’s smile moves to one side and his eyes are suddenly downcast. “I haven’t practiced the piece since the show…”
"What about you? What's your dream home?"
Never once, in all the years that Harry's been working with the Auror's, has Kingsley ever called a meeting after hours. Harry knows that he should be worried or even excited at the prospect of some potentially breakthrough update to the Death Eater situation, but instead dread sits in his stomach, making him want to eject all of the food that Draco just treated him to. Pity, he decides as he patiently waits for the elevator to deliver him to the correct floor, is probably what spurred Kingsley to call for him. Maybe he thought Harry would feel jealous if he weren't invited to the meeting. Why else would he call in someone who is wholly un-involved in the entire investigation?
Harry just smiles, shakes his head, and focuses on eating his food.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry sees Malfoy finish his breakfast and make to leave. Harry quickly scarfs down the scrambled eggs and sausage in front of him, whispers “I’ll explain later” to Hagrid,  and follows close behind.
“Books here, Potter,” Malfoy commands Harry with a finger jabbing at an empty spot on his desk at the front of the room. He has already set down the paperbacks and is deftly unbuttoning the top buttons of his robe and unwinding the scarf coiled around his neck.
"Merry Christmas, Molly," he says as he kisses her cheek.
Harry smiles, leans forward, and Draco meets him halfway.
“I agree. ‘s why I quit the Ministry.” Draco didn’t even know Harry had worked there to begin with. “Those white walls and windows that lead nowhere…” Harry shakes his head.
“Harry, you know that’s not what I mean.”
And that's a WRAP!!! (Sorry for the late ass update, I overestimated my access to quality Internet)
Harry doesn't say anything. He doesn't think he can say anything. The last time he and Draco were on a broom together, he almost died too. The memory of Harry, Draco, the Room of Requirement, and Fiendfyre is an all-too familiar visitor to Harry's dreams. It's one of the worst, which is saying something.
Unused to this kind of high-society treatment, all Rose can do is giggle at Malfoy’s strangeness. “That tickles!”
“How-?”
With one, strong kick, Harry's up in the air and flying higher and higher with Draco doing the same at his side. He knows that the Snitch initially flew off to the back-right of the garden, but since he took his eyes off the area for a few moments, it could've flown off to anywhere by now. Desperate, both to win and to do so quickly, Harry scans the scene in search of just a small glint of light reflecting off of gold.
But Harry continues, trampling through as he always does. “I’ve thought about you a lot since the War. I was so angry in the early years.” He takes a breath. “I never wanted to see you again.”
Harry nods into her shoulder and she lets him go. The last thing he sees before the green flames whisk him away is his best-friend waving at him, concern etched on her face.
, Harry thinks. They've all remained close over the years, and sometimes Kreacher spends the night with them, helping them cook and clean.
His office door swings open and hits the wall with a muffled
Draco nods and passes her his cup. “Please.”
Draco holds out his arm without a word, and his mother takes it. Together, they tear away, carrying the man they loved between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry squeezes back, but remains silent. By the light of the stars, Draco sees the pain rising from him like smoke - choking him thick and heavy.
He shrugs and gives her a small smile. "I'm used to them, I suppose." Ron opens the door and they all crowd into the warmth of the house. Everyone else’s gathered around the dining table, and they wave at them as they enter. Almost every square inch of the table's area is covered at this point, but dishes are still floating in from the kitchen, directed by Molly's wand. "Take a seat, we're almost beginning. Hope all that flying has worked up an appetite!" A particularly attractive bowl full of mashed potatoes lands on the table in front of Harry.
Looking at him is like looking at memory.
But Draco doesn’t crack. “I was just telling Gran-Hermione what I’ve been doing since the War, Ma’am.”
He sighs and gets up from the bench. “Let’s go.”
"Yes, that's correct, at least from my experience. But I enjoy it, so it doesn't make it so bad."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s arms are warm. His body is warm. His breath smells like alcohol, but Harry doesn’t mind it as much as he usually would.
Near the end of their meal, Draco suddenly looks up from his food. "Harry."
“Wh-when is she going to wake up?” Thomas asks, seemingly so stunned that he forgets who he is speaking to.
Weeks pass but Harry barely notices. The days and nights blend into one - sunrises, sunsets, dawn, dusk, Harry can't tell the difference anymore. All he knows is to lay unsleeping in his bed when it is dark - or when Kreacher gently hints at him to - rise after some time, dress, go to work, and come back and repeat the process when he feels he has sat at his desk for enough to be counted present and working.
Lucas, who’s been silent throughout this exchange, suddenly speaks with a light in his eyes. “You’re an Auror, right?”
“Oh, I’m sure.”
“But you didn’t hear any specifics?”
- the cafe that he’d met Draco in what seems like ages ago, he spots Neville, who catches his eye but does not wave. Harry walks over and takes his seat.
But the Muggles in the club don't seem confused at all. They nod and rock and tap their foot just like they did in the first half, and if Harry were just judging from their reactions, he would think that nothing had changed at all. But something had.
Now, all was quiet. The stars above shine their faint lights, and the constellations they build together pulse with life.
Just as he bites into his last cookie - butterscotch, his favorite kind - Harry hears the sound of the Floo activating from outside his room.
WHAM!
Slowly, Malfoy speaks, “It’s an interesting idea, but I don’t think my work is all that groundbreaking yet. Or interesting, even.” He stands and walks to the window. “It’s late. And it looks bad out there.” With a twirl, he’s facing Harry again. “Where are you staying again?”
"Quidditch again." The blonde finishes the thought for him.
“What’s this?” Harry asks, pointing to the soup.
Molly’s completely plastered now, her face almost as red as her hair, but she’s still sober enough to shout out the answer: “Second floor right!” before practically faceplanting on the table. Arthur and Charlie hover over her worringly, but she seems to be fine - just falling asleep.
Harry doesn’t know what to do, what to say, so he just stands awkwardly to the side and watches the entire exchange.
Her eyebrows shoot up. "Certainly."
“Yes,” Draco murmurs, “that would be for the best.”
But before either Harry or Ron can react, Draco adds, looking Harry up and down, "Oh, and you may need to lose the Muggle blue jeans before tonight, Harry."
Draco answers readily, his words flowing smoothly off his tongue and into the ears of the some dozen Weasleys gathered around the table, "Volunteering at a Muggle War orphanage, sir."
The stairs are the hardest part; all along the way, the blonde alternates between periods of trying to squirm out of Harry’s grasp and becoming a dead weight by relaxing and not moving at all. Somehow, they get into the room and Harry wrestles Draco onto the bed.
"Go! Look, he's coming out now." She points and Harry follows her finger to see just that: Draco leaving through a door on the side of the stage. A crowd immediately coalesces around him, clambering for his attention and autograph.
This one's a Hefty one folks! Hope you enjoy Weasley family Christmas shenanigans!!
A moan escapes Draco's mouth at that, and he clutches at the back of Harry's shirt. "Thank Merlin. Thank God."
“I’m sorry, Lucas.”
“I would really like that.”
“No need to mask your disappointment, Potter.”
“...I’ll send you an owl. Later.” He raises his eyebrows and jerks his head. Harry takes the hint and leaves quickly, and the crowd of reporters promptly swarm back around Robards, and their group shouting match begins again.
Draco nods. At his signal, his mother flicks her wand and the polished wooden box in front of them floats off the ground, and gently settles into the hole. Another flick, and the pile of soil that lay beside lifts as well, and covers the box - smoothing over until the seam of the hole’s border disappears.
Draco feels Harry struggle to find words for a moment, before he settles on a weak: “I didn’t know you were in touch.”
“Hurry
But before Harry can speak a single word, a robed old man stands up from his bench at the front and intones, “5 years in Azkaban followed by 500 hours of community service. No chance of parole,” and suddenly the muscular men on either side of Malfoy who bear a striking resemblance to Crabbe and Goyle grab both of his arms and start dragging him out of the room.
Slowly, gingerly, Draco extracts himself from the hug after a few minutes. He’s now speaking to the children in tones so hushed that Harry can’t hear, but his face is earnest and serious, and the children’s faces reflect his.
They shake hands, and Harry smiles warmly at her. “Mrs. Felding, good to see you in person.”
They make their way back to the house, and while walking Hermione asks Draco with awe on her face, "Draco, I didn't know you were so good with children."
Because for three nights now, including the first, Draco has lain awake as Harry and Weasley have the same argument outside his cottage. On the second and third night, Draco instinctively threw silencing charms at his wall and tunneled back into his covers, but sleep never came easy after that. Because he knew, and that knowing was enough.
"Wonderful." Arthur shakes his head while smiling. "I wish I could learn, but I've heard that, if piano is difficult, then jazz piano is even more so. Especially improvisation!"
In short, the Aurors are fucked.
At that moment, the door opens and Hermione and Ron step in. Ron's dressed in a black suit and a red bowtie, and a white, folded pocket square is poking out of his breast pocket.
But Edwards suddenly becomes completely unresponsive, just sobbing and mumbling about Azkaban on the floor. There's nothing to be done. Harry sends a Patronus to Robards, telling him about the situation.
“You two are…” He adjusts his scarf and clears his throat. “...together, are you not?”
Walker nods, then takes her hands off. “Allow yourself this.” She turns to the door. “And have a happy birthday.”
Harry whips his head around to look and sure enough, the one remaining offensive member of the other team - Lucas - has gathered up their bundle of wands and is sprinting for his life back across the field. Their fort has collapsed in on itself, and under its crumbled structure lie both what looks to be Gordon and Robin. Stella is also covered in snow, but she's not out yet - trying to scramble to her feet while making snowballs at the same time.
Harry can’t figure out why-
"Why?"
In the corner, people continuously stream in from the outside. All the tables have been filled, so now there's a line of people posted on the back wall and utterly enraptured by Draco's playing.
"You flatter me, but no, I do not bartend. A friend of mine does. I-uh-actually perform."
"Nice. Think it's going to be a sweater?"
“Just come sit. Please?”
[Reference to attempted suicide in next two paragraphs]
“Yeah. It wasn’t always a dragon refuge, right?”
And sorry for the late update! I’m currently in an area with extremely spotty wifi so it took me a long while to get this up.
“No? Know what?”
"That's...so surprising. He never brings friends around here. In fact, I think you're the first that I've known about." She looks past Harry, into the crowd, and points at a woman across the room with black hair down to her waist and a smart blazer and slacks set on. She's chatting amiably with an old white couple. "That's Belle. She's the owner of the place. And we always joke that we're the only friends that he has, but I'm pretty happy that's not true." She chuckles at that and shakes her head while she wipes down the counter.
All three are nearly identical - the middle one simply has two less beds. The interior is simple in each: dark wood paneling and white carpet, photographs of Snowdonia hung on the walls and thick rugs underfoot. Each opens to a living space, a half kitchen, and a bedroom. The porch in the back overlooks the wide-flung wild behind, its brush and tall grass and sweeping backs of mountains in the far distance.
They take a right and Malfoy stops in front of the tall brown building on the corner. “This is it.” He rings the bell and they wait.
Harry shifts against him in shock. “Ginny?”
s. The hundreds of nights he lay awake - before, during, and after the War - conjuring Madame Malkin’s once more, the memory like a blade held to his skin.
Spread on the table are several dishes - sauteed greens, a cold noodle dish, and a whole fish that’s practically buried in chives and ginger.
Kingsley calls on her, "Yes, Jenny."
Footsteps. In seconds, Draco Malfoy steps onto the stage and the crowd goes dead silent - even the children stop squirming in their seats and stare, fixed, at the stage.
He opens his mouth. “I don’t know why Snape and Dumbledore and your aunt and uncle did those things to you. If I did, I would tell you. I promise you I would.” Draco closes his eyes. “But I do know that Snape and Dumbledore had to carry the consequences with them for the rest of their lives, and your aunt and uncle will have to do the same.”
“Are you okay?”
"Pl-please....Don't send me to Azkaban..." He pleads, eyes meeting Harry's wild and desperate. "I'll do anything. Please....Ple-ease...."
But now, nearly two hours later, it’s 6:35PM and Harry still has a whole section to go. Or maybe several. It isn’t his fault that he’s unused to working on Fridays. Or working much at all, for that matter.
“It isn’t that.” Harry pauses. “Or, actually, it is that.”
He nods to confirm, and behind him Bill and Fleur have to hide their snickering. “Really.”
"Welcome back." Hagrid greets Harry at the door, one big hand holding Cane back from slobbering all over Harry's face.
"Oh no you don't!" A snowball flies by Harry, and for a moment he's distracted by the sheer amount of force put behind the throw. Malfoy's getting down to business. A second one clips Harry's ear, and he takes it as a hint to begin running in a zig-zag pattern.
"Well, I'm coming as your date, right? And I think w-we've known each other for long enough that...it wouldn't be..." he falters, "it wouldn't be weird, right?"
was the best Seeker at Hogwarts when we went to school?”
A similar reaction from the audience.
Malfoy gives Harry a strange look before saying, “I don’t think I could take it.” He carefully climbs to his feet and offers a hand to Harry. “Let’s skate some more before it gets dark.”
“When’s the Portkey again?”
“‘Night.” Footsteps trudge off.
“His favorite is lime, I think.”
"Er, sorry about that. Listen, did you...notice anything strange last night? I'm afraid I...don't remember much." It's not completely a lie. Harry's fairly certain that his memory is mostly intact, but if he was awake when his sweater was taken off, then maybe he's wrong.
“We are not. We will stop at the next rise and have supper, before turning back.”
“I dunno, seven?”
His arms elbow deep in the crumbling dirt, Draco turns slightly. “Yes?”
“Good question,” Draco replies, “It very basically means their bloodlines diverged from mainland dragons thousands of years ago, and now they are unique, existing nowhere else in the world.”
But Harry is a simple man, and maybe a little bit dumb. "And save you a loss? Not a chance." He stands, with Lucy still in his arms. "After you."
The line between them stretches taut and with every breath, Draco hears its vibration - the song it spins out of nothing.
Draco considers lying. “Most everything. Muffliato is a very useful charm, Potter.”
“I’m glad you agree.” He hesitates before continuing. “And I apologize for being so short with you. I was a little...stressed and shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
"So tonight I'm going to play several of my own compositions - all of which exist thanks to the upright piano that burned down with the orphanage. I hope you enjoy them, and I hope you consider donating. Thank you." He gives a slight bow amid deafening applause and takes a seat at the piano. After a moment, he flexes his wrists and begins to play.
“Out of the question.”
Suddenly, as Harry's settling down on the floor again with his drink, he spots the stack of textbooks they used for class on the table and realizes something. "Malfoy."
Malfoy takes it and stows it in the inner pocket of his coat without checking its contents. He is unblinking and unflinching in front of her. "Thank you for the opportunity."
Malfoy opens his mouth to reply, but just then the woman yelps in alarm while staring at the clock over the piano. “Dan, Angelica, you’re going to be late!”
“Can I kiss you?” Harry asks.
Draco remembers learning about hibernation as a child, from his mother at bedtime. He remembers asking:
“You have some explaining to do.” His robes have dried now.
The first gift he opens is from Molly, and it's one of her traditional sweaters. He must have about a dozen of them by now, all with different designs. This one is navy blue with a white letter 'H' on the front and a white silhouette of a stag on the back. "Thank you, Molly. This is amazing."
“Curious choice for a bachelor’s trip.”
“If you remember,” Draco seethes, “I had other priorities back then.”
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! And remember to sleep and eat properly even (especially) when you're stressed!
“I know you said wizards used to fight dragons here, but did any live here?”
They're cheering.
"House!" Several children say in unison.
Harry and Malfoy take the hint and make to leave. When Harry looks back at the last moment, Snape has returned to his frame, and both he and Dumbledore are watching on as they leave - and not unkindly.
“Well,” Hagrid stands, “Yeh wanna head over now? Before the snow gets bad.”
And the rest of the staff seem to acclimate themselves to him, as well. More than once, Draco has heard laughter and cheery conversation float in from the breakroom - Harry and Prasad bonding over some new Weird Sisters single, Harry and Walker talking Quidditch, Harry and Amira chatting about embroidery.
“I-what?” Whatever Malfoy had been expecting him to say, this clearly wasn’t it.
"Well," Malfoy jokes, "It seems I've beaten you to the punch."
“Yikes.” Arthur says, which earns him a swat on the shoulder by his wife.
“This is as far as we will go,” Draco says, during a lull in the group’s conversation. “It is as far as we are allowed, by Glyder Fawr and the others.”
He starts on his sandwich and Harry follows suit with his half. “Well, I completed my 500 hours of community service, as you know.”
She doesn’t say anything. Of course she doesn’t. Owls don’t
"Uh?"
"I don't know how you do it, Draco," Fleur says breezily. She stands up and walks to the kitchen. "I'll just go and make some tea."
After donning his robes and scarf and stashing the books under his desk for class the next day, Malfoy links arms with Harry and promptly half-drags him out of the castle, through the snow, and to the Lake.
The sky above him is lightening - turning from deep black, to purple, to blue.
It’s long dark when Harry throws a pinch of Floo powder into the fireplace, announces, “The Granger-Weasley House” loudly and clearly, and steps through. Before Harry can gather his wits and stop his head from spinning, however, something collides into his legs and almost sends him back into the fireplace.
Then he blows the candles out.
He thinks to himself furiously, dumping the scrolls onto the coffee table. What sound like cups clinking, a murmured
“I-you-”
“Uncle Harry! Push harder!” Rose screams as she flies back and forth on the Muggle swing. He’s taken them to the park near Grimmauld place. There are a few other children there, swinging and playing on the slide, but they pay them little attention.
George lets out a burp and follows it with a lethargic "Excuse me," but Molly still scowls at him anyway. "Manners!" She reprimands him, but the rest of the family laugh anyways.
“Happy Birthday, by the way.”
The papers strewn on his desk rustle violently before flying everywhere and suddenly Harry's being drenched by all the papers and files raining down in his office. His hands clench and unclench. Wandless magic tends to get away from him in moments of high emotion. One of the spare quills on his desk splits neatly in half, longways.
disappointed in their masters.
“Mm?”
“Almost,” Prasad confirms, “The mothers are getting restless, I think they hear them scratching the insides. You need to get down there now.”
"Really? That's too bad."
“What is it then,” Draco asks, not at all like a question.
Some run up and ask, “Do you need help with these, sir?” referring to the small stack of paperbacks Malfoy’s holding in one hand.
“Nothing,” Harry responds as he watches the snow fall gently from the window. It’s looking to be a very white Christmas this year, as the snow from the storms the past week haven’t even gotten close to clearing up yet.
Harry knows that he’s never really been good at the investigative side of Auror work - he almost failed his practical during his time in the Academy - but he can’t help feeling antsy knowing the department is struggling. Knowing that nonwhite Muggle and Muggleborn lives are at stake.
“This isn’t about me,” he says, as gently as he can manage. “They’re coming to celebrate
, Harry thinks as his eyes droop wearily,
“Please,” Draco interrupts, “Leave.”
Shaking his head in amusement, Harry obliges and places a foot on the ice - charmed to be able to skate effectively, of course.
They set off.
"Are you ready to leave now?" The blonde's better dressed than usual, which is really saying something. He's wearing a fitted, collared maroon shirt with a black overcoat, slacks, and polished shoes. His hair is coiffed and swept back in an elegant swoop gathering at the back of his head, but still allowing for some volume in the front. Harry swallows.
“What orphans were attacked? Are they alright? Where was-”
"Yes," Molly sets her knitting down, "How long have you two been together, Harry? And why didn't you tell us?" Her brows are drawn, her eyes kind.
It all starts when he tells Harry before he goes to work that he wants to have a serious talk after dinner that night. For the rest of the day, Harry can barely stomach any of his food, can't concentrate on work, can't muster up a smile for when Ron takes him out to lunch. The possibilities for what he wants to talk about swirl in Harry's head, but he's no fool. Neither is Ron.
When he speaks, his voice is thin and shaky. “This is m-my fault.”
"You need to stop...being so talented."
"Seriously though? Kind of. But maybe not a jazz fan. Maybe just a Draco Malfoy fan."
“Wh-what?”
“Yes, well. Longbottom was kind enough to reach out after the trip - the original one. We’ve kept in contact ever since.”
“Sorry to bother you.” It’s his supervisor, Amira Felding, robes still as neat as Draco had seen it that morning. “There’s been a changeup. The tour group tomorrow changed their plan to a camping trip last minute. Walker can’t do it - her knee - so it will have to be you.”
“You can come, if you want. To the wedding.” For the first time all night, Harry sounds unsure. He looks away.
Inside, is a pair of snakeskin work gloves. Red with black diamonds, the scales are oil-slick and gleaming in the warm light.
“I’ll see you all after Christmas. I’ll get you something.” He goes to wake Pat, who stumbles into the kitchen a little blearily and takes the baby from Harry.
“I-” Draco pauses, then bows his head. “Thank you, everyone.” When he looks back up, Harry is beaming, his smile scorching.
A sly smile. “Nevermind.”
help. I’ve just been…busy. Overworked, you know? I’m
"And it's even worse since both of us were so involved. I've seen a lot of relationships between survivors where it's gone wrong. They hurt each other just by being together."
For the first time the entire night, anxiety shows up in Draco's face and he suddenly looks every bit as exhausted as he probably feels. "How did you do it? Protect everyone you love and still save the world?"
“What are your plans?”
He can hear the smile in Draco's voice. "You're a Saviour without even trying. You should have expected this."
Welcome! This fic is completely finished and is comprised of a total of 6 chapters, 16k words. I will be updating Mon/Wed/Fri until the end.
Molly picks up the conversation from where they left off. "So, Draco, how is working there? You must meet many interesting Muggles."
“They have one scheduled the day after.”
Harry stops and turns around, brow furrowed and holding his hand out “Are you okay?”
!" Edwards shouts. A beam of red light chases toward Harry, but he deflects it with a quick
Then, he pulls out several towels - one for each egg - and the water basin, enchanted to retain water and replace it automatically.
Hagrid explained once, but Harry never fully grasped the logic.
They’re still giggling when they sit down and Harry resists a powerful urge to roll his eyes. These days, he’s not sure if he’s mildly disgusted or immensely jealous at their display. He wonders how they still seem so young. Fifteen fears after the war, one baby later, and they’re still in the honeymoon phase.
A minute passes. The sirens have gone away and the fire has died down a little bit, but the smoke it generates is still thick in the air.
"Play on three?"
I love Hagrid so much.......he and Madame Maxine are my otp tbh
“Yes.” He points into the valley, where, a little ways away, sits a small huddle of black-roofed cottages. “That is our destination. We should reach it by sundown.”
“Come sit with me.”
Draco leans forward and squints at the phone. "Why can't you apparate? If you don't mind my asking."
While he's waiting for a reply, Harry doodles some shapes in the corner of Jack Willow's case folder. No one would care to look twice at his reports, anyways, so it doesn't matter what he does with it as long as he maintains the illusion of productivity.
Harry bites and drops the topic. "Er....I actually didn't see him while I was there, but Hagrid said he was doing well. He's living in the forest for the winter.
“F-for Christmas. I didn’t mean just in general, though I’m sure that’d be okay-”
Malfoy covers Harry’s hand with his own. “They’re dating, Harry,” he tells him under his breath.
The blonde is gripping his arm like a vice, even though he's (presumably) asleep. Small, quiet snores spill from his open mouth. A small spot of nearly-dried drool rests near his head, on the pillow.
They begin sleeping in the same bed at night - Draco’s bed. Harry on the right, Draco on the left. The sound of Harry’s breathing becomes as familiar to Draco as the fluxes of Snowdonia; the rains and droughts, the tides of the seasons. Before he slips into sleep, Harry’s warmth is the last thing he takes comfort in. And when he wakes, Harry is the first thing his hands reach for.
"What was that for? I spent an hour trying to get it kind of flat."
“Fu-watch it!”
“Harry?”
“This must be pissing you off so much…”
Harry thinks, but doesn’t voice.
“And she didn’t cheat on me either.” Harry adds, finishing Malfoy’s next thought.
Lucas grins at her, but doesn’t try to defend himself. Harry gingerly takes his still-outstretched hand and shakes it.
Ron just smiles and shakes his head, "This is just like when Hermione snips at me for wearing trainers with dress robes, even though no one can see them. Sometimes, in a relationship, you just have to learn to compromise."
“What did you just say, dear?” Molly inquires. The whole family’s listening in now, and Harry can almost feel secondhand pressure.
But this catches Draco off guard, and he practically flinches. "Uh. Yes, they do. But the longer ones are Tuesdays and Fridays."
Ginny helps Harry up and pats him on the back. "I guess your talent extends to catching Dracos as well as Snitches." Her tone is light and joking, but her hand is slightly trembling. "I'm really sorry I got careless like that."
“Okay, okay!” Harry holds up his hands in defeat. “I did promise you.”
“Thank you.” With a grunt, he pulls up a long-stemmed weed.
Their objective is pretty simple: catch the Snitch. With the magic wards in place, there's no chance of it escaping from the Weasley property, but it also means Harry and Draco have a smaller space to work with, which might result in more intense, cutthroat competition - not like they needed more of that or anything.
“Where?” The question slips out before Harry’s common sense has a chance to stop him.
Alt (The Onion) chapter title: "Man Knows He Must Ride Unexpected Urge To Clean As Far As It Will Take Him"
"I agree," Arthur adds, "We weren't sure if you were just...making fun or not."
Belle doesn't respond to that, but merely smiles slow and wide before turning on her heel and gliding away.
A flock at the corner of Draco’s eye suddenly takes off, and when he looks over, it’s Harry, looking sheepish.
“She’s doing alright?”
It’s still snowing when Harry wakes up the next morning. The flakes mind their own business on the other side of the glass as Harry gets dressed, pushes away the cuppa Kreacher offers him, and summons his broom - the Pulsar, the newest model, gifted to Harry free of charge so long as he rides it everywhere.
"It's ready!" Malfoy calls from the kitchen. "Potter, come help me take the mugs."
His fans come and go and Harry watches all of their interactions. It seems that many of his longtime, most devoted fans showed up tonight, judging from the way Draco would banter with them as if he's met them many times before. Many are crying when they approach them. Some burst into tears as soon as they hug him. The atmosphere is significantly more serious that it was during the Christmas concert, but the level of the fans' love remains the same.
“Wanker.”
“Good night then.” He slides off the arm of the couch and extinguishes the the flame of the candle on the coffee table. Harry hears him pause somewhere before reaching his room, and he strains to hear what he may be doing, but nothing comes. A moment of baited breath later, the door of Malfoy’s bedroom finally closes with a
They lock eyes.  “Yes,” Harry says, breathless, “I have.”
Harry nods, and presses a kiss to his cheek in affirmation. They sit in companionable silence for several long moments, feeling the sand between their toes and the wind tousling their hair, before Draco speaks again:
Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s hands. “I don’t know either. Family just...can be weird.” Harry thinks about Aunt Petunia, Uncle Dursley, and Dudley. After they reconnected with him and asked for forgiveness two years ago, Harry has since been able to cultivate the saplings of a familial relationship with them - even to the point of inviting them to his and Draco’s wedding - but it hasn’t been all sunshine and flowers. It’s taken hard work and at least a dozen tearful breakdowns in Draco’s arms.
Harry feels like a fish, gasping for water.
“The good and the bad,” Draco affirms.
And they’re off. First stop is Malfoy’s living quarters, where Harry and Malfoy pick up a trunk each.
“Good job! Now the other one-?” Before Harry even finishes his question, Malfoy’s completely on the ice.
Without Harry noticing, the students seemed to have already separated out into teams. “Be on my team?” Sophia asks Harry sweetly.
Longbottom manages a nod. “I’ll go let the others know, then.” He starts back towards the entrance, and, after a brief, hushed conversation with Harry, they two of them leave and go toward the argument outside that hasn’t subsided in the slightest.
The two make eye contact and hold it all while Draco takes the flowers from him and hold them close to his chest. Their fingers touch briefly in the exchange, and it sends shivers through Harry's body. He can sense the others behind him, watching his every move and analyzing their interaction.
” Harry sits back, stunned. “Narcissa
He’s only gotten through three of the readings when a shadow suddenly falls across the page. He looks up and is face-to-face with an upside down Draco Malfoy, his blonde hair falling around his face and his sharp eyes looking into Harry’s. “Is that the one I wrote? I put it in there because I thought we’d get to it, but...” He climbs over the back of the couch, sits right next to Harry, and takes the scroll of parchment out of his hands before he can protest.
With all the excitement about the pregnancy and baby talk, Harry didn’t get a chance to bring him up. It seems so unimportant anyways, in comparison. Hermione and Ron’s family is growing.
Harry winces. “Understandable. I’d deserve it.”
exactly she thinks Harry would be worrying about, she doesn’t say. But rather than demand an explanation, Harry simply says, “Okay.” The fire crackles in the fireplace. “Sorry,” he tries to rub away the sudden weariness from his face, “Had a rough day at work today. I didn’t mean to drive him away.”
“I knew you’d like it,” Draco smiles triumphantly. “See? It’s never too late to experience culture.”
Draco buries his head in his pillow, and when he speaks, his voice is muffled. “Just...answer the question.”
“How are you two faring” He asks, completely ignoring Harry.
The kids look at Harry expectantly. All he can manage is a small wave and: “Er. Hi. Name’s Harry.”
Draco draws his hands from his pockets and begins rechecking his pack, making sure he’s bringing enough water, food, first aid. “Don’t start now. It doesn’t suit you.”
Andromeda moves first, standing up and walking towards Harry with her hands up as if preparing for an attack. “Harry, let me explain.”
“Alright, let’s move on.”
“Even though it’s a Muggle instrument?”
Alarmed, Harry sits up and whips his head around, figuring it was the work of some rogue student out to sabotage them.
Harry kisses him - the press of their lips hot and passionate. "Yes," he breathes before kissing him again. "Yes, I agree. I want that. I want you, Draco."
“Are you not?”
“Yeah, I guess. It seems…freeing.”
Pulling back, “What?”
“No one, piss off!” He growls.
Steeling himself, Harry throws himself out of bed and stalks over to his window. His barn owl, affectionately known as Spotty, blinks her eyes at him in confusion.
“I’m going to the Burrow. Why?”
Malfoy smirks a little bit, though not unkindly. “Never heard of jazz before, Potter?”
They relapse into silence. Out of the corner of Harry's eye, he sees the waitress coming with a dessert menu, but before she reaches them, a silver Lynx bounds through the walls of the restaurant, startling all the Muggles, and stops at their table.
As soon as Harry finishes the last “P,” Spotty swoops in, grabs the letter in her claws, and silently beats out of the room without being told. Harry sits back in his chair and prays.
Harry rubs soothing circles into Draco’s back as the latter slouches in the face of defeat on both physical and spiritual levels.
Harry casts
“Yes. A distraction sounds great.”
Harry Potter shoots to his feet, along with hundreds of other witches and wizards, and claps as loudly as he can manage. On the stage, Hermione’s smiling and posing for a photo with Kingsley, and hanging around her neck is the Kingsley Shacklebolt Medal for Extraordinary Dedication to Equality between Creature, Muggle, and Wizardkind.
Harry grasps her hand cautiously. “Harry Potter.”
He's definitely late to work by now, but the anxiety still doesn't lessen very much.
Third stop is right outside Hogwart’s grounds, where Harry and Malfoy link arms, take one last look at the castle, and apparate.
“Yes..?”
Without hesitation, without any orders, Harry picks up the snowballs that tumbled to the ground when he fell, throws them all at Malfoy with ferocious force, and barrels forward without any thought to his own well-being.
The wave of rolling eyes around the table is almost audible; after the War, Arthur's interest in Muggle technologies expanded full force into the realm of music. One of his favorite genres is jazz, Harry suddenly remembers from a very animated conversation he had with him once - during most of which Harry was completely lost.
“Harry!”
The Ministry is quiet Monday mornings; many of its workers take their time coming in after a weekend of relaxation and fun. Harry used to be one of them, but he's trying not to be any longer. His department needs all active Aurors now more than ever - the public is growing antsy and desperate for some kind of concrete progress in the neo-Death Eater case. Harry doesn't blame them. Just this last week alone, there were two failed bombings in London. Failed only because the field teams efficiently tracked them down and disarmed them before any more Muggle lives were claimed. The hunt for the bastards behind it all has reached a fever pitch, both in the Wizarding and the Muggle worlds.
"It is." Draco's voice has suddenly taken on a dreamy quality to it. "I joked to her once that I might consider building an identical cottage right beside hers and live there for the rest of my days. To my horror, she was not immediately opposed." Harry chuckles at that, consciously aware of how Draco's fond smile has settled on him, warming him from the tips of his toes to the ends of his hair.
Harry stops, looking down at Malfoy sitting on the couch.
Malfoy sits on the bench, back straight and stock still, staring straight ahead at nothing. His hair is matted with sweat but he’s shivering slightly - the only signs that Malfoy is nervous at all. Harry wants him to relax, to just incline his head just a little bit so Harry can properly catch his eye. If he does, Harry will point to the pile of papers sitting in front of him - his testimony that he and Hermione had spent many long nights writing - so Malfoy can see that Harry’s got his back.
After they settle down, Draco speaks again. "So happy to hear that. Have good Christmases and holidays, everyone?"
Stella and Sophia immediately dash not forward, but sideways in opposite directions. From the corner of his eye, Harry spots Gordon and Robin disappearing behind him to begin the fort.
music genre). He wants Draco to look that way at him; he wants to please him. He clears his throat and digs into his mashed potatoes, feeling his face heat up.
Harry flinches at his words. "I just told her to piss off."
After dinner, Draco and Teddy decide to practice a piano duet that they’ve wanted to perform for forever, and Harry takes the opportunity to talk over some plans with Andromeda.
“Yes, I do. Why do you ask?” Harry looks up and meets Draco’s mischievous gaze.
Luna nods. "Let's."
But Harry can see Malfoy’s arms trembling under his robes and hear the tension in his voice - naturally, he points it out.
"What are you doing in Potter's office?"
Harry thinks to himself, but doesn’t add.
It seems foolish to classify the Christmas Day crowd as 'large' now. While the line was out the door that night, it's coiled tightly up and down the street tonight, and the club itself seems like it's bursting at the seams. The two bouncers at the door are working frantically trying to let in as many people as possible while also ordering the people already inside to make room.
A slight note of desperation enters Harry’s voice. “You have prepare fo- no.
"It's alright," Draco says, offering up a weak smile. Though it's the dead of winter, beads of perspiration trickles down from Malfoy's hairline and onto his forehead.
Draco bites his lip and looks around. All is quiet, the lights in the other two cottages are off. The moon, shrouded - air, thick with anticipation.
And Harry does.
Once they gather their breath and quench their thirst, Draco watches them begin to take notice of their surroundings. Their eyes trace the sloping mountainside, to their unattainable culmination. Then, they slip down, and follow the range as it rises and falls, curves and straightens. They suspect nothing, Draco knows this. No one ever does.
His face now especially red in the light of the fire, he tugs at his beard and mutters, “She’s alrigh’.”
“Oh. Well. It was nice.”
Harry tries not to stare too hard at his Adam’s apple as he swallows. “And from then on, like I mentioned before, I’ve been in and out of all kinds of jobs. I’m currently playing regularly for a Muggle jazz club.” Malfoy says the last sentence casually, as if it were completely
The final letter of their exchange comes at last:
But today, Edwards doesn't look half as mean as he usually does. His face is almost deflated, empty, devoid of much emotion. And when Robards addresses him, he only flinches and nothing else. Hughes is similarly silent, only nodding in acknowledgement of Robards' orders, but that’s in character. Ron nudges Harry under the table and the two share a fleeting, confused look. It looks like Ron doesn't know what's going on either.
He does, and sees a massive, dark shape moving underneath the layers upon layers of ice. It’s…
This makes Harry laugh, but he quickly sobers up when he realizes what Malfoy’s alluding to. “I know what you’re talking about.”
After eating his last bite of food, Bill swallows and asks, "What did you teach?"
Harry nods and takes the baby from his arms. An hour passes in relative peace. While Malfoy chats animatedly with the children and show them the proper hand form, Harry sits the baby on his leg and watches the two toddlers as they play some sort of wobbly game of tag through the rooms.
At this small morsel of information, the group of students burst into noise and activity again. They hurl question after question at Malfoy, and he patiently answers every single one as they walk through the corridors. When they turn a corner at the end of a corridor, Harry lets them go. It doesn't seem that he'll get a chance to talk to Malfoy alone - at least not tonight.
"Good morning to you too."
the research.”
Harry scarfs it down in record time, and the two leave the cafe.
Harry doesn't know how he does it.
Neither one moves to pull their hand away. Neither one breaks eye contact. Neither one breathes.
“I di-did this...I did th-this…” Draco begins to repeat the phrase over and over again as he cries. Harry says nothing. Harry has nothing to say.
To be honest, Harry's a bit lost. If Draco's breaking up with him, this is a hell of a roundabout to do it.
“Yeh really think so?”
Despite himself, Draco feels his lips quirk up. “No, Weasley, she will not ‘blast us,’ as you say. There is a reason we are here in winter. You are right that they are very protective when they are awake, which is why we don’t usually come here as caretakers - much less bring guests.”
“Yes.”
At the end of the fifteen minutes, Malfoy pushes his sleeve back and checks his watch. His
“Would you-” he cuts off.
She casts
Robards shakes his head, his arms crossed and his face stern and condescending. What a bastard, Harry thinks. Jenny has at least ten more years of experience on him but he still treats her like a trainee at times. "No, they don't need to know about any of this. We're going to warn our community and encourage everyone to be on the lookout for suspicious activity."
“I wonder if it ever gets lonely down there in the winter,” Malfoy muses as he peers down into the depths of the Lake. The dark shape dives out of sight.
"But what about work, Draco?" Ginny inquires casually. Before the War, such a question directed at any Malfoy would be wholly unusual - and even insulting - but everyone knows that most Malfoy assets were seized after 2/3rds of the immediate family were sentenced to Azkaban. The name no longer holds the weight it once did, and the media had a good time with that story for solid months.
But he still feigns ignorance. "I don't know what you're talking about."
Although he told Ron he was sober earlier, the truth is that he still feels dizzy and slow. And he can’t really tell if his slight feeling of out-of-bodyness is actual dissociation or just his brain reacting to the leftover alcohol.
When Draco finishes it and the concert at large, the crowd doesn't hesitate to collectively shoot to its feet, the hands of every shape, size, and color creating a wave of sound, of clapping, to meet Draco as he stands and bows. There's a big smile on his face and Harry catches a little sparkle falling from his hair. For a moment, he wonders how a sequin got in his hair, but then Harry realizes it was a bead of sweat. Several beads, in fact. But Draco's still smiling, still laughing, still graciously accepting the enormous bouquet of flowers that Belle presents him. Harry suddenly feels self-conscious that he didn't think to bring anything too.
Draco leans in as soon as the waitress leaves to get their wine and place their orders. “So,” he begins, “what do you think so far?”
To their left comes running Prasad and Walker, followed by Amira and Dr. Khanyile. Walker yelps and screams as Prasad grabs at her waist, and the two wade deep into the pulling water. Amira flashes her wife a wicked grin, before rolling herself into the water as well - her enchanted wheelchair taking to the waves easily. Dr. Khanyile laughs and yells, “Wait for-” the rest of her sentence whirled away by the wind.
Harry sucks in a breath.
“Potter.”
He keeps his father’s ashes on his person, often. He takes it out sometimes, on windy days or while standing over a calm stretch of river, and considers releasing its contents. But he never does. Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t appreciate being spread so thin. He’s always liked his constraints - they shaped him, so to speak.
“How long has it been since you’ve skated?”
“I’m comin’, I’m comin’. Hold
“Hey, Malfoy.”
Harry turns around, smiling. “Well?”
right now.
Harry gives her the list of drink requests from the group, and she wastes no time in making them. As she does so, Harry doesn't try to strike up a conversation. He's too nervous - opting instead to rubbing his hands and staring at the stage, which is completely empty.
!” He snaps at her, jaw clenching. “Are you going to hold that over my head forever?”
“What about the rumor that it was due to Auror negligence?”
In contrast to previous years, the Great Hall is surprisingly full. It looks as if almost a fourth of the school had elected to stay, when only a handful did last year. Very few are sitting segregated by House. A mixed group of Slytherins, Hufflepuffs, Gryffindors, and Ravenclaws are playing what looks to be a very tense game of Exploding Snap at the end of the Hufflepuff table.
"Congratulations!" "Congrats!" "When did you find out?" A chorus of voices explode with noise all at once, and Harry blinks slowly, trying to sort through it all. Molly seems on the verge of tears, and Arthur is rubbing her back in circles.
If what Ava said about Draco’s behavior working at the club is true, then Harry doesn’t blame either hers or Belle’s curiosity. Draco has always been mysterious in his motives and thoughts, and he still is, but Harry thinks that he’s slowly coming to understand him.
Before he can stop himself, Harry blurts out, “You should come back sometime.”
Harry quickly folds up the note and sends Spotty off with it before he can think too much about what he has just done, but the regret creeps in as soon as Harry collapses back onto his bed.
He considers this. “You’re right, people used to live here. Mostly likely Muggles - ancestors of the Welsh.”
Defeated, Robards has no choice but to collapse in his chair in defeat. Harry watches him try to make eye contact with Edwards, but the man is still sitting in the exact same position as he was before, unmoving and staring at the table. It doesn't even look like he heard any of the exchange that just happened.
“Yes?”
"I hope so," she says as she begins to peel back the paper. "I hope it's in green this time." Green is her favorite color.
Andromeda laughs lightly. “Well let’s hope it tastes just as good. Come, let’s eat.”
Harry’s head snaps up. “Huh?”
“Are you going to be alright going by yourself?” Hermione’s looking at the pair with her brows furrowed. Behind her, Bill and George have gotten into a heated debate with Audrey and Percy over Quidditch, which the latter pair has only recently gotten into.
"Mr. Potter." Stella calls out to him.
"Yes."
nice!”
“Already?” The children complain and plead, but Malfoy shakes his head, smiling his soft smile, and takes his coat and scarf back from Harry.
"What do you mean?" Harry thinks back to the conversation he and Hermione had about Draco's playing midway through.
“...I apologize.” He says stiffly, his eyes trained on what lies ahead. “It seems that I’ve misunderstood the situation.”
They begin eating, and don’t stop until the plates are practically licked clean. Groaning, Harry sits back in his seat, tempted to pop open his fly to give his stomach more room - which he’d seen Jackie Chan do in one of his old martial arts movies that he and Draco had watched once. “For the culture!” Harry had said, brandishing the Muggle VCR tape in front of a doubtful Draco.
When the laughter dies down, she continues. “And big thanks to my husband, Ron, and my family. You all kept me sane and made me go to bed on time, however against my will.” Ron, Rose, and Hugo are to Harry’s left, and they cheer and laugh at their mention.
"Like you can talk."
He imagines Ron would be confused - maybe even cross about it - but he hopes Hermione would have a better reaction. She was the one who helped him prepare his testimony for Malfoy’s trial, after all.
Suddenly, a spotlight opens center stage, and sound of squeaky wheels follows shortly afterwards.
"Of course."
“Goodbye, Potter.” But before Malfoy can leave, Harry grabs his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I understand,” he replies instantaneously.
“No not really. And I-I think so,” Harry says lamely. Malfoy snorts a little, but doesn’t comment.
And that's all, folks! Hope you enjoyed this little sequel. If you want to learn more about the process of writing this fic, check out my tumblr @Inofaro!
Harry and Malfoy's heads.
When it’s time to leave, Harry gives Andromeda a kiss on the cheek, and apparates away once he steps on the other side of the gates. The last thing he sees is a lone silhouette shadowed by the light behind her, waving.
"My present to you."
“But of course I could not die. I would live on, through each scalding moment to the next.”
Sophia lets out a little gasp. “You’re not coming back?”
"Still, you didn't notice all his time?" He snarls. "This was your one job, Pott-"
The next gift is a bumpy package from Hermione. After a confused look at her, to which she meets with a mysterious shrug, he opens it. It's several tubes of paint and a bundle of paintbrushes.
"-I think we can still grow. And I want to be here, watching that happen. Helping you."
"Merlin, are we really doing this?" Harry’s pulse jumps at the thought of competing just like old times.
Hermione closes her book quickly, walks into the bathroom, and wraps Harry in a hug. “Welcome back to the living.”
Harry continues glaring at him, his eyes drooping. “Where are you going to sleep?”
It’s Draco’s favorite hike. At Glyder Fawr, the earth is carved deep, and the mountains are pushed high. A product of millions of years of tension and grinding rock, but still the range is calm on the surface.
Something rises in Draco, then, as it often did these days. A rushing, daring feeling that only came when Harry was around.
The first rain of the year portends fresh growth, snowmelt flushing the streams, and all manner of creatures - magical and not - poking their heads from their burrows.
“Semantically -
“No thank you. Just take your seats, please.” Malfoy brushes past them and breezes into the classroom. The kids follow suit all-too eagerly. Only a few glance at Harry and none of them offer to help with the ridiculously and probably pointlessly thick Muggle textbooks he’d managed to lug up several staircases.
isn't. Which is alarming, to say the least.
“Wait, wait, wait,” Harry butts in, shaking off Draco’s hand, “Don’t listen to him, Rose.”
“His parents. The way he was raised - that also played a part.”
give you all a tour. Please, follow me. And have you met my girlfriend, Ava, the bartender?” And with that she leads most of them away, chatting amiably with Ginny and Luna in particular, but as Harry turns to follow them, a hand around his wrist stops him.
“Oh. A few years.” Malfoy begins to skate counterclockwise around the perimeter of the Lake and Harry skates so that they’re stay side-by-side as they make conversation. “I think the last time was when I took my mother out skating at the pond near her house.”
The next morning, Harry wakes up comfortable and warm in his sheets and surprisingly refreshed. When he throws open the dusty curtains, he’s surprised to find that snow had fallen overnight.
be sitting with Andromeda at her dining room table right now, enjoying whatever delicious meal she’d prepared today. Mashed Potatoes? Sauteed asparagus? Harry’s stomach rumbles with yearning and he pats it sympathetically.
Stella gives a wide, toothy grin. "Fantastic. We're gonna wreck 'em."
The castle is mostly quiet - ghosts floating from one room to the next, some, like Nearly Headless Nick, are even wearing holiday gear like ghostly tinsel. Harry has no idea where the students are, but his thoughts don’t linger on them for too long. In fact, his thoughts can’t linger on anything for too long. Time and time again, they keep returning to the obvious, to the memory of him and his big mouth last night, to Malfoy, and to their
Sophia laughs nervously, looking between Harry and her friend. “Sh-shouldn’t we get started on the project? At this rate, we won’t finish.”
The first rain is always the heaviest. And Draco didn’t bring his wand.
for the heir to the Malfoy line to be a jazz musician for a living.
Draco dismisses him with a wave of his hand. "You had a choice the whole time."
Vaguely, Harry realizes that Draco's probably working his magic again, but it feels different from the Christmas concert. Then, Draco's magic teased the corners of his consciousness with a certain hesitation. Now, it's confident, controlled, and Harry can't help but to be swept up in it.
When Harry looks at Sophia, she grins and announces proudly, "I'm offense with Stella. Gordon and Robin are taking defense and building our fort."
"I should be the one thanking you," she says while taking off her glasses. "You seemed to have sparked quite a passion for learning - and for researching - in the students. That's a rarity in all the years I've been in magical education."
The fourth day of the trip, Draco runs them ragged, showing them the steepest slopes and most difficult hikes, hoping pure exhaustion manages to deter Harry and Weasley, but that night, his eyes once again fly open to the deep purple of the dark and murmuring voices out back.
They stay like that for a while, limbs intertwined, speaking only when there is something to say.
“Er, no?”
Laughing, Arthur replies, "That's going to be quite a big wedding then." After a moment, he adds, "That was a good pun."
“A week. Though at this rate, they may as well change that at a moment’s notice, too.” The bitterness hangs from her words. Rare, for her to be so frustrated.
"...I see. Sorry again about that." Harry moves on.
Luna, who Harry only just noticed has been sitting on the floor, leaning up against Ginny, muses. "They're a beautiful couple."
Harry shakes his head. “No, you’re probably right. Things at work have been...hectic.”
It was at that point that Malfoy began to research more deeply into the two topics - all in his free time, of course - which eventually led him to Muggle topics like physics. More specifically, the physics of sound.
But Harry and Ron did, and they both send triumphant grins Kingsley's way, but he pretends has if he doesn't see them.
"For this next half, I want to do something a little bit different."
Draco rises from the desk, and walks over. He extends a hand, and they shake - Harry’s warm, smooth palm against Draco’s. His ringless fingers, touching Draco’s. “Good to have you,” he says.
With a slight shudder, all three of them think back on when they told Molly about Rose. It was during Christmas, which was their first mistake, and it was after a lot of wine - which was their second.
“Look, Draco.” His gaze follows to where Harry is pointing. Through a thicket, it’s where one of the main tributaries in this area should be. “It’s dried out.”
"It's full tonight."
Now, when Draco speaks, the men turn their faces and crowd close, like cubs to their mother's warmth. Thomas shows an interest in history. Finnigan asks often about the particulars of dragon caretaking. Longbottom, naturally, is fascinated by the plants native to Snowdonia that, according to the legends, mark the footsteps of the most ancient dragons. Weasley wonders about the possibility of reviving the cross-species friendship, and of wizardkind taking flight once more. But when he turns to remark on that one time in Gringotts with his best friend, the conversation dies.
"-ir? Sir?"
At times, they skate in silence, each lost in their own thoughts or admiring the view. Other times, they chat animatedly, leaning into each other and smiling like old friends. Like the War never happened. Like Malfoy and Harry actually became friends after meeting at Madame Malkin’s for the first time all those years ago.
"Yeah."
Draco looks away. He squints against the falling sun instead, and says, “We should return. It will be good weather, tonight, for stargazing.”
"Merry Christmas."
Harry watches as some eyebrows climb higher and higher and some jaws drop lower and lower. Since he went through the same shock only a week or so before, Harry understands what they must be thinking now. The Malfoy name has been tied up in money, connections, and inherited power for so long that the assumption is often that the individual members aren't really that talented, or even worthy of any of those things. And to be fair, there's a definite argument to be made there about how no one family, not even the most gifted or talented, deserve the sheer amount of power and privilege that the Malfoys had possessed before the war, but what Harry's rapidly learning is that Draco has the true talent to rebuild his family name from scratch. Harry can almost see some of the last dregs of resentment towards Draco melt away from the faces of the Weasleys. The Malfoy family as a concept will never garner full forgiveness - the past there is too painful for that to ever happen - but Draco Malfoy as an individual is proving himself to be different from his family. Harry feels an odd sense of pride, though he had nothing to do with any of it.
He spends the rest of the day half-dazed with delight at his desk, filling out paperwork at a snail's pace. For the first time in a while, he knows the current day of the week: Wednesday. Which means the event is in two days.
Longbottom practically faints at the sight of their camp. Already half-asleep on their feet, Weasley, Thomas, Finnigan file inside their respective cottages, and Longbottom follows close behind - but not before throwing Draco a quick, “Thank you for today, Malfoy.”
Robards, the bastard, grinned, “Exactly. Can you do it?” It was a rhetorical question, of course.
He does just that. And then they spend the next thirty or so minutes teaching the basics of flying to Rose - and ultimately to most of the other children, who, upon seeing her having so much fun, naturally want to join in. The adults leave for the warmth of the house as time goes on, all save for Hermione, Ron, Ginny, and Luna, who stand in a circle a little ways off, partly in conversation with each other, partly watching Draco and Harry and their impromptu flying workshop.
"Charlie," Ion speaks up for the first time tonight. "Let's go. I want to see what this...jazz is."
And with that, without even waiting for a reaction, Draco leaves them, walks into the kitchen and says his goodbyes there, and glides out the front door with his trunks floating along behind him. The 'pop' of Apparition sounds moments later, and he's gone.
They only receive visitors sporadically, especially in wintertime, and not all of them are assigned to Draco, but the ones that are...There is a particular campsite that is still uninhabitable. Amira was almost impressed by the level of destruction.
But luckily enough, the next owl is from Draco and not Harry's much-detested boss.
"Malfoy--!" With one, rage-fueled-motion, Harry uses his entire arm to wipe his glasses clean and uses his other arm to launch his snowballs.
Anxiously, Harry asks, “Do you like it?”
“Uh. Yeah.”
The car arrives, and pulls into the parking lot, out of sight. A door opens and slams, and the car locks with a chirp. Harry Potter walks into view.
Harry’s mostly just glad Hagrid has been able to move on from Fang’s passing a few years ago.
"There's much the Wizarding community can learn from Muggle science, I believe. It has a lot of overlap with magic."
Rolling his eyes, Lucas rolls up the sleeves of his robe and opens the hefty physics textbook. “This is what you get for not doing the reading, Sophia.”
"Yeah."
the letter begins. A good start.
"And how long have you been doing this?"
But he knows that he won’t. He never does.
Harry's head hits his desk with a soft thunk. He knows this is his fault. He knows what he did. A nasty voice in the back of his mind tries to convince him that he was justified, but was he? Probably not.
He doesn't respond, but simply laughs and starts to circle the yard faster.
“Thanks.”
Supper passes peacefully. Professor Gill, who joined the staff only a year ago, is easy-going and a never-ending well of good conversation. They explain to Harry their research into Wolfsbane and its scores of properties still unknown to Potion Masters around the world. A few students summon the courage to approach Harry for autographs on their copy of the final volume of Harry Potter’s seven-volume biography and he obliges.
To be perfectly honest, Harry doesn't understand music that much.
“Just drop it!
“Harry!” “Harry, are you involved with-” “Do you have any comment about-” “Do you know anything-” “Have you-” Are-” They’ve left the door now, swarming Harry instead, but that doesn’t stop him from walking toward Robards and Kingsley’s office.
Harry can physically feel his face go white. “Am I-can I go? And help?”
“Good. Send her my condolences.”
"Can I-" Another kiss. "finally call you my boyfriend?"
An hour - or maybe two - passes like that; Harry slumped at his desk, alternating between staring at the inside of his eyelids and the office carpet. He knows that he should be working on paperwork, but he can’t see the point.
"Hey, when this all blows over, let's have a pity party, alright? 'Mione can't drink but we still can," Ron says, trying to keep his tone light.
One-by-one, they file into the club. Harry's excited, but a little anxious - and his hands can't stop shaking. He doesn't know what to expect, not only because he has never been in a Muggle jazz club before, but also because he simply hasn't been in any sort of club in years.
Harry takes Draco’s hand - it’s rough and scarred now, from years of volunteering at the National Scottish Dragon Reserve, but Harry wouldn’t have it any other way. “Just think about it,” he says, “it helps. I promise you it helps.”
"Wow! I've never heard of anyone doing that before! So you've seen him play?"
“But…” A note of doubt enters his voice. “I’ve been rethinking that recently. The whole Auror thing. Especially with all the rumors about neo-Death Eaters...”
“I know. Shh.. It’s alright now. It’s going to be alright.” He soothes while trying and failing to mask the own fear in his voice.
After their brief spell of drowsiness, Weasley rises, and wipes his eyes blearily. “Where to, next, Malfoy?”
"Thank Merlin." They reach the meeting room and find that most everyone has arrived before them. The double doors are propped open and inside is seated all the Aurors with Kingsley at the head of the long table. All heads turn to look at them as Ron and Harry draw close.
Everyone’s expressions are hard to read. Bill, Fleur, Audrey, and Percy smile politely, Molly and Arthur’s faces are inscrutable, Charlie and Ion don’t react much - probably because neither have had much interaction with Draco in the first place - Ginny attempts a smile, but it falls into a half-grimace instead - and Hermione and Ron beam at him.
Nearly thirty minutes and a second coffee pass before Harry spots Malfoy walking down the street in a long, dark blue coat and complementary gray scarf. Harry waves at him through the glass but Malfoy doesn’t seem to see him.
Molly blinks in surprise at being suddenly addressed, and nods her head. "Y-yes, it should be ready in forty-five minutes or so."
It must be, it can’t be.
Harry snorts.
Harry smiles. “Good to be back.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Can I...uh...open a tab?"
“About what, the class?”
"Bloody hell." Harry mutters.
Thomas whistles. Weasley exclaims, “Without magic? There’s no way.”
The smile in her voice is dulled and sad. “Then correct me.”
” She opens her mouth to argue some more, but Harry cuts her off. “Why can’t you guys just
“Sweat wicking, on the inside,” Harry says. “And the outside is stain, water, and fire resistant.”
As he comes closer to the building, his panic increases. It roots him to the spot until all he can do is watch the fire eat away more and more of the structure. He was right.
“What’d you play?” The other girl asks.
In the end, Harry takes a mostly unintentional nap while trying to pass the time. The owl with instructions from Robards never comes, but Harry doesn't care. As soon as it's 5:00PM, Harry heads out his office, not even bothering to spell it locked behind him.
Potter,” Malfoy snaps in between labored breaths. They’re both a bit breathless after the two flights of stairs they practically flew down.
“Yes. About this date. About me. Anything.”
Follow me on tumblr @bonsoirpunpun if you want to keep up with what I'm doing/want to know the lunatic behind this fic jhfaksdkjk
“Yeah, of course.”
“I think the clutch is hatching.”
Hagrid gasps and slams his cup down on the table, jolting Cane awake for a split second, before he huffs in annoyance and his head falls back on his arms. “Abou’ the baby, innit?”
"...I will," Malfoy manages. "And I will let you know my answer by owl soon."
“No. Or Mother didn’t think so, at least. If they did, they never said anything.” Draco’s voice goes a little bit wobbly at the end.
Harry stops struggling now and takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. He listens for any further movement from within Malfoy’s room, but only hears what seems like the creak of his bed springs as he climbs in and no further noise.
For a long moment, neither men speak. They just breathe in the night air, filtering in from the open window.
“Malfoy! Wake up!”
The opposite team seems to have a similar plan in mind: Malfoy seems to be on defense, and with him are two students following his building instructions. Their two offensive players dash exactly as Stella and Sophia did, so now each pair is facing off. Lucas is one of them, but he’s facing off against Stella and not Sophia - but Harry feels like a Sophia-Lucas battle would be much more interesting to see.
Overhead, the gray hides the light, but Draco still feels warmed.
The Muggle in lines are excited, but not as much as they were at the Christmas concert. The wind makes it hard for Harry to listen in, so he just watches their stony, serious faces as they talk to each other.
Draco takes Rose’s small hand and kisses its back before saying, his voice silky-smooth, “Enchante. And please call me Draco.”
But he feels it still: a cord tugging, always tugging, in Harry’s direction.
Draco feels his pulse jump. “Do they?”
When the picture frame is mostly dust-free, Harry puts it back down on his desk and picks up the folder laying on top of dozens of unfinished reports. He peels back the front flap and the escaped Neo-Death Eater, Jack Willows, stares up at him with his dull blue eyes. Harry inspects his file with a small spark of interest, but quickly finds after thumbing through his information for a few seconds that there's nothing too interesting to be found.
look like she was the one who was raised by Muggles. Ginny’s ready already - dressed in a full black tuxedo with a blue-green - or “turquoise” as Ginny would call it - vest and a matching bowtie while sporting an impressive, slicked back mane of red hair. Her date for the night, Luna, is adhering to a couple-coordinated color scheme; she’s currently seated at the window seat and looking out the window in a form-hugging blue-green (turquoise!) dress with her long blonde hair styled in a high ponytail.
"What?"
“I...think you play well. And I’m curious.”
“It’s us now,” Hermione whispers, interrupting the group’s current conversation about their limited knowledge of music.
Looks alone, it
Even drunk, Draco’s language is just as posh as ever.
But when he looks across the table at him, into his features drawn with concern and earnest eyes, he can’t bring himself to be the paranoid jerk he often was in Hogwarts. They’ve graduated. It’s been fifteen, long years, since the War, and Malfoy has already paid his price.
“What?!” She practically climbs into Draco’s lap in her eagerness to hear slander against Harry. “Really?!”
"Do you want to be defense or offense?"
When Malfoy enters the coffee shop with a jingle of the bell, the barista looks up and calls to him: “Hey Draco. Your friend’s over there.” Malfoy’s head turns and, seeing his impassive face and piercing eyes, Harry shrinks into his jacket. Malfoy turns back around, orders with a voice so soft he’s inaudible, and walks over to Harry.
“That’s really interesting.”
"I hope you all had a good time tonight," Draco says into the microphone, trying to hold it in a way that the flowers of the bouquet don't end up tangled in it. "The bar will close in half an hour, and the club an hour, so please stay with us for a little bit more. And Happy Holidays." And with that, Draco walks off the stage, followed close behind by Belle, the spotlight dims, and the house lights come back out with bright ferocity.
"Let's go, then." Draco shifts from holding Harry's hand to linking their arms together. They exit the door as one and Draco turns on his heel and suddenly Harry is whisked away.
"Right? And I'm pretty sure the staff meeting will be about his group's further movements and not just about his break out." Seeing Harry's confused face, Ron explains, "I overheard Kingsley and Robards' one-on-one earlier today."
“Coming,” she calls back. A moment later, she wheels into view and stops to watch with Draco. “Right on time.” Draco hears the smile in her voice.
He cries harder.
“How do you two know Draco, then?” She glances at the empty glasses all around the rest of the table. “And the rest of your party?”
A sigh. But when he speaks, Draco hears the reluctant smile in his voice: “What did you get me?”
"Yes! Especially the chapter about the chord progressions, that was incredible."
"No shit. I want to know what you said to her that messed her up so bad. When she came home last night she didn't stop crying until two in the morning."
person despite being a nasty human being any other time of day, and said, “Potter.”
They will come when they come, Draco reminds himself. He stashes the rest of the invoices in the desk drawer and bangs it shut. He sighs, and when his eyes inevitably snap to the blistering outside, that agonizing blue of sky, he sees it.
"I'll take offense." Harry's never been much of a defense guy. Even in Auror training, which required him to be comfortable with both, he got away with mostly "playing offense": going on raids, stakeouts, duels, etc. It annoyed Ron to no end, as he hated defense too, but was always caught sneaking to the other side. Harry supposes it's cruel irony that he sits in a cubicle day-in and day-out now, unable to play either.
"However should I know? He arose in the early hours of the morning, looked at me, took your sweater off, and threw it at me. I certainly did nothing to offend."
When he finally makes it into the warmth of the club, he realizes that the mood inside is similar; the conversations are subdued and the people move with less energy than they did before, preferring to stand or sit in one place and stare at the empty stage.
Amira is there to greet him when he enters. “Harry Potter, is it? Good to meet you.”
Arthur seems to be at a complete loss for words, opening and closing his mouth repeatedly but not a sound escaping it.
"You do not have to decide now. I would just like you to think about it."
"These kids are very dear to my heart. I’ve seen them nearly everyday for the past ten years. I changed their diapers. I watched them grow up. And without them and Patricia, their caretaker, I don't think I would be where I am now. They have given so much to me," Draco pauses, choking up a little. "This is the least I can do."
." Ties bind Edwards until he's laying on the floor, unable to move.
The owl came a month ago - the one that invited Draco to be the main speaker of the inaugural International Music-Magic conference, held in Bucharest. Draco had practically torn the piece of parchment to shreds while reading it, which greatly annoyed Narcissa, who wanted it intact and in her scrapbook.
Fourth and last stop is the Burrow.
"Harry."
Before either of them can say anything more, Ron materializes at their table. "Yes, yes, you did." His voice is about half an octave higher than it usually is. He grips Harry's arm and helps him stand up. "Maybe we should call it a night?" His words are structured like a question, but it sounds more like a command than anything.
"I've heard that painting is a good coping mechanism," she explains briefly. She doesn't need to say anything more. Everyone knows the kind of coping she’s talking about.
He regards the group of men before him, the people he grew up with, the people who despised him for half a decade. He watches them smile at him and he speaks with them easily. And all the while, memories of their hatred, of
A beat.
Hermione tells him about her future plans for her nonprofit, which is very close to relaunching. She doesn’t ask, but Harry offers to be a spokesperson for it, anyways, and when he does, she beams at him.
When Harry speaks again, the words come slowly, “We separated on good terms. She and I both realized certain things about ourselves and decided that we were better off as friends.”
“This was a team effort!” Prasad announces, proudly. “Lin and Amira baked the cake, Harry made the icing, and I spelled the snake!”
Aurors are a nice concept, but new recruits quickly find that the work is less than desirable. Chasing “bad guys” and enacting justice are certainly part of the job description, but so are long nights away from home, without food, sleep, friends, mounds of paperwork, and not to mention the grueling training that 90% of all trainees fail or drop out of.
“...You’re a coward, Potter.”
At Harry's voice, Edwards spins around and draws his wand. Harry only has a split second to react, and even though it's been a while since he dueled, his reflexes are still pretty good.
“You’re loud. And heavy.”
But Hermione just shakes her head. "That's not what I mean. Are you sure you want to be romantically involved?"
“I see.”
No one answers. No one moves. Prasad looks between them like they’re watching a particularly rousing Quidditch match.
“Oh, is it? That’s good to know.”
"No, I-uh. It's my first time here."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes?”
The "kids" look around at each other. "I think I want to stay a little while longer," Ginny voices her opinion. Luna, seated beside her, nods in agreement.
“Well…” Malfoy’s eyebrows draw up slightly. He looks extremely weary, all of a sudden. “I’ll try to. But this class is only a trial run for now.”
He doesn't have the Snitch. He never reached it, so it's still flying out in front of them, but Harry doesn't care about that now. While pulling the broom back into a sudden stop with only his legs, Harry uses both hands to grab onto Draco's. He's heavy, and Harry vaguely notices Draco’s broom falling to the ground beneath them, but by utilizing all the muscles he hasn't worked out in years, Harry somehow manages to secure Draco onto his broom. And by secured, he means the blonde isn’t falling anymore - but with the way he's desperately trying not to slip off, grasping at the twigs and at Harry's arms, he doesn't seem any less anxious about his situation. He's more slung over the broom than actually riding it; he's balancing on his stomach and his legs are dangling off the side. Harry knows he can't hold that position for long.
"You're...probably right. There's no other explanation."
” Harry instinctually catches Draco in his arms when he slumps forward. “But I should've known they w-wouldn't give up. Merlin I’m such an
Malfoy bites his lip. "I am certainly interested in your proposal..?"
“What?”
"Tom-" Arthur begins, but Ginny cuts him off. "Let's go, then!" She looks to Luna; their hands are still intertwined. "Would you like to?"
“I didn’t know Draco was a constellation,” Harry says, so softly that Draco barely catches it.
But the fire burns on, shooting sparks like stars.
"Let's just go eat."
Hermione sighs in exasperation. “Harry-” she begins, but that’s when Ron strikes: winding his arms around her middle and hugging. She shrieks, but once she sees who it is, they both dissolve into laughter.
Harry almost has to wrestle the grin off his face. “Really?”
In the middle of what seems to be a continuation of their game of "House" from last night, Draco stops to examine a pile of untouched packages in the corner.
At the mention of something Muggle, Arthur perks up. "Muggle physics?"
“...Yeah, sure. I’d like that.”
Harry trudges up to the front and plunks the books down on the desk. Without thanking Harry, Malfoy picks up the first textbook of the top and wastes no time in launching into his lecture.
With a heavy sigh and a blooming smile, Malfoy shrugs off his coat and unwinds his scarf. “Fine.” He tosses the coat and scarf to Harry, who catches them out of reflex. They’re warm with Malfoy’s body heat. Malfoy casts a small glance at Harry with a twinkle in his eye.
Hopefully, no one will say anything. He knows that Malfoy won't do anything to offend the family - even he if he doesn't like them, Malfoy, from what Harry's seen, would remain dignified. He's really just worried that this experience will sour his and Malfoy's relationship - not that they’re anything more than friends or even friendly acquaintances in the first place-
"I got you," She assures him and gently pats his calf on their way down. "You alright, Draco?"
But it doesn’t come. “I’m going ahead with Ginny,” Harry blurts out.
“Sure. And Malfoy…?”
“Oh no, you were plenty help! And thank you.” He hesitates. “Mr. Harry...the other day...I seem to have upset you. When we were talking about the Auror department. I apologize for that.” He bows his slightly, his eyes downcast.
He waits until Belle and Ava are distracted processing other donations before approaching the bouncer manning the table. In the end, he donates a couple thousand pounds from his Muggle bank account, casts one last look at Draco, and pushes out the door into the quiet street.
Draco learns Harry’s favorite foods, how he likes his tea. At lunchtime, when they are both working the office that day, they sit outside to eat. After, they lay in the grass - head to head - and let the sun fall on their faces.
“Wow.”
And it feels different too. Some pieces leave Harry feeling warm, some give him shivers. When Harry glances at the others seated at his table - Ginny, Luna, Molly, Arthur, Hermione, Ron - they all have the same, surprised but pleased expression.
Y i k e s!!
“Goodness. You all have been friends for quite some time, then.”
They skate silently for a few seconds before Malfoy speaks again. “Do you feel comfortable sharing?”
Just then, Harry realizes why he was so off-put by seeing Malfoy. "Wait. There is something."
“Follow me.”
They chat about name possibilities for the rest of dinner, though it seems that not much has changed since last time - when they were naming Rose. Hermione leans towards names of famous wizards, authors, and Muggle scientists, while Ron seems set on naming the child after some ancient Weasley to, as he claims, “make Mum happy.”
“You wouldn’t understand.”
"Uh, actually, yesterday night was our first date. Of sorts."
Kingsley continues. "I just have a few updates: one, we've been getting dozens of anonymous tips about Muggle attacks all over England, but they seem to all be false. We're assuming their strategy is to spread our resources as thin as possible. For the time being, we're closing off the anonymous option when sending us tips and posting Auror trainees around the country to call in reinforcements in case one of the tips ends up being true."
“W-when are these going to hatch? Is that their parent?” Finnigan asks, transfixed.
Though he told him not to that morning, Draco is waiting up for Harry, hunched over his keyboard, composing like mad. He twists to look at Harry when he comes in. “Hey.”
The door bursts open to reveal his freckled friend standing in the doorway, his hair windblown, cheeks and nose red, and dressed in full, scarlet Auror robes.
“Oh. I’m sorry.”
Harry brings up his earlier conversation with Neville, and Hermione and Ron don’t look too surprised. “We’re so proud of you, Harry.” Hermione tells him. “Yeah, you did something really difficult,” Ron agrees. A warmth settles in Harry’s chest.
"Cut the bullshit Harry. You and Draco? Sneaking off?" She playfully digs an elbow into his ribs and he winces.
As Harry approaches the empty seat next to the new Potions professor - Professor Gill - the students behind him quiet a little and stare at his back. Hagrid is already seated at the High Table, talking animatedly with Professor Sprout. Neville doesn’t seem to be here yet, Harry notices - or maybe he has already gone home for the holidays. Harry hopes it’s the latter. Headmistress McGonagall catches Harry’s eye and nods slightly.
“The only negligence that happens in the department is because everyone has to deal with you annoying wankers instead of doing their work.” After he finishes that sentence, Robards locks eyes with Harry. “What do
They eat in comfortable silence for most of the rest of their meal, only occasionally commenting on the food, the restaurant, or asking after each other's lives. At one point their shared connection of Andromeda and Teddy is brought up, and they both agree to all meet up together for supper sometime.
Harry checks his watch; Draco got so sick of him casting
Feeling slightly awkward, but also stubbornly unwilling to display any kind of weakness in front of the bastards in the room - especially Robards - Harry strides in with Ron following him and they take their seats. As soon as they do, the doors swing shut and the meeting begins.
It’s not a small thing. It carries a weight. The light picks up on it, making the glass shine and the contents pale.
"It's about time, too." Ron adds.
"And we’ve been wondering - where are you conducting your research?"
“Yes.”
Around dinnertime, the students file out, stomachs rumbling, leaving just Harry and Malfoy alone in the living room together.
"It's fine," he mumbles. "If he wants to break up, then it's his choice. I have to respect that." He gathers his trash and stands up. "Let's go back."
A little POV change ;)
"Hm?" Hagrid has a mouth full of tea.
"What took you so long?" Ginny whispers to him as he slides into his chair and turns it to face the stage.
Draco's eyes are so dark. His blonde hair too - maybe it's the lighting, but it seems less platinum like it normally is, and more like a dirty blonde. His narrow nose, his sensuous pink lips, his slightly pointed chin; everything seems...different up close. But maybe it's just the alcohol talking.
Talks like a hero, plays the part, too. Draco is tired of needing to be saved.
"Wow." She takes a deep breath and then sticks her hand out. "Ava, sorry I forgot to introduce myself earlier. I'm his coworker here."
