“Very well.” He pulled the container of sugar cubes closer, dropping one into his tea before withdrawing his wand from the back pocket of his trousers, pointing it at Aedan as he waited for the sugar to dissolve. “I’m afraid that you have given me really no choice. You will tell me exactly what has happened for the Ministry to suddenly care so much about my wellbeing, or I will ensure that you are fed to our estate’s peacocks and the many other delightful creatures the Dark Lord entrusted to my family’s care.” The auror looked apprehensive for the first time they had set foot into the manor, and Draco tilted his head, watching them. “Do I make myself clear?”
Aedan passed the letter back, Draco opening his eyes, carefully folding it and slipping it into the envelope again. “I don’t know what you mean, I get loads of fresh air,” he said with more defensiveness than he intended, but he knew that wasn’t what they meant.
“Did Mister Malfoy attempt to cast an Unforgivable at you, the Cruciatus, but it failed?”
night, swallowing hard. “Could I get a cup of chai as well, please?”
. I will submit to questioning but I don’t require the need of potions to tell the truth.”
“He tried to kill me the morning of that final trial day,” he replied bluntly, pushing his hands into his pockets because they seemed to be constantly shaking now. “You probably saved my life just now. Savior Potter, back again from the dead.” He couldn’t muster up any of the bite he used to have, now that his secret was out and they knew it was all fake anyway. “So. What now?”
He shook his head harshly, eyes squeezed shut as he tried to force his heart to slow down. “No, he - he wouldn’t,” Draco managed, and the bitterness in his voice surprised him. Good, saintly Harry Potter wouldn’t poison him, would never do something so subtle - he’d just throw a curse right at his face.
that can ruin this for you, if you don’t agree to questioning there is a very good chance they are going to send you to Azkaban.”
“Oh, and a menu. He hasn’t had Indian in years, needs a bit of a refresher on how good it all looks.” Draco looked up in time to see Potter wink up at Amber as he said it and she giggled, lightly swatting their shoulder with her notepad.
Potter hesitated for a few moments, almost as if they were waiting for Aedan to get out of earshot, before speaking again in a slightly harsher tone. “Ron and Hermione both think I’m mad for talking to you about all this but I’ve decided to give you a second chance, Malfoy. Hey.
“Excuse me?”
He watched them turn and walk to the cafe entrance, dipping his head on instinct as they glanced back at him, and he didn’t dare blink until they were out of sight because otherwise he would swear it had been his imagination. Then the glass door shut behind Potter with a gentle clang, the hem of their robe vanishing around the corner, and Draco let out a sigh so large his body nearly collapsed from the weight of it all. “The Great Harry Potter wants to get drinks with me, a confirmed Death Eater.” Even in a barely-audible whisper, hearing the words out loud sent an electric spark up his spine. “Merlin this is ridiculous, there is no way this is real and happening, it - my luck is not this good,” he groaned, rubbing at his eyes and quickly opening them again when Potter’s limp body reappeared in the darkness.
would have a field day tearing apart our every move, it would - it’s the last thing we need, after the war.” He looked up just long enough to see them nod and take a large swig of their beer, and he knows he’s gone and fucked it all up, they’d changed their mind about the whole second chance thing and they were going to finish that drink then walk out the door and owl
“Mister Potter, I do have another question for you, something that was brought up to me by some of your former classmates at Hogwarts.” In unison both pairs of eyes flicked over to the witch as she rifled through her stack of parchment, pulling out a sheet from the middle with a wider smile than before, the rest of the room drifting back to silence. The same stroke of concern for his mother’s safety reappeared, this time on his own behalf. “When you announced you were going to be speaking at Mister Malfoy’s trial with the Ministry, some... concerned parties reached out to me on your behalf, in an effort to negate any peace-making attempts you may be attempting. They assured me that they hold no ill will towards you, Mister Potter, or Mister Malfoy, but they wanted to make sure that the
“Merlin’s tits Potter, I’ve explained it all pretty damn clearly,” he snapped, cutting them off. “Are you really that fucking daft? Do you really need me to come out and say I’ve fancied you for the last three years, or will that not make it through your fucking thick skull either?”
More and more he found himself aimlessly wandering down the empty halls, the memories from when You-Know-Who took up residency flickering over him sometimes, and lately he had started to reemerge from those trances on the roof. He was never near the edge, the wind mussing his hair as he swayed gently, a random book in one of his hands; it was peaceful in a way he couldn’t explain. He’d tend to stay up there reading, legs crossed comfortably beneath him, and unless Aedan sought him out, reminded him of the time, or shoved a plate of food at him, he’d stay up there long past sunset, casting a soft
“I know, I know, I’m sorry. Tell your mum I say hi.” He watched them pull a few muggle bills from a wallet, holding them out to her. “Keep the change, you deserve the tip.”
” in a warm red and yellow glow. “Well, here we are. I’m paying, by the way, since I can assume you’ve never handled muggle money before,” the Gryffindor said, holding the door open for him with a little bow, and there was only a little bit of mocking in their tone. “You can get it next time.”
peered down at him, and Draco swallowed the nagging pull he felt towards the stairs leading to the roof of the manor; it always came at this time of the night, but his mother would notice his absence the next morning. He couldn’t let her lose her child and husband so close together.
, under his watch, it was threatening to smother him completely, stealing most of the air from each of his gasped breaths. “Fuck fuck fuck.”
in favor of writing a
, every possible scenario he had run through was thrown out the window; in fact, the only coherent thought he could form was
“Yeah, yeah that’s right.” Draco watched their gaze flick down to their drink before becoming unfocused for a moment. “I mean I don’t really remember anything from that first time, back when I was a baby, but everyone’s pretty sure I did then, and now I’ve got that new time, from the Battle of Hogwarts.”
“Perfect, grab me if you need something!” She was immediately waved to another table, hair bouncing behind her as she walked, and the door chimed as another couple came in. “I’ll be with you in one second!” Amber called over her shoulder, bending to listen to the table, and Draco turned his gaze down to the food.
That image of Potter, sprawled onto the forest floor and not breathing, of them carried to the castle and limply falling from the half-giant’s arms to the ground, of them never waking up and the Dark Lord winning the war and those empty green orbs staring into his soul screaming that it’s all his fault - it flashed in front of his eyes for what felt like an eternity and a second at the same time.
“I’m really not,” Saviour Potter replied almost immediately, and their matter-of-fact tone stung Draco more than it should have. “I’m definitely not Mrs. Malfoy, I don’t have kids, and he and I were just in the same classes, it’s not like we were mates. I don’t really care what her motivations used to be, or what they are now, all that mattered is that she wanted me alive, so here I am.” They raised a hand, waving towards the audience absently. His jaw was set, eyes flashing with a defiant expression that Draco remembered from potions, the familiarity of it almost making him smile. “Her son is the one on trial, so she is here, you know, if you want to ask her yourself.”
“Excuse me,” Draco said stiffly, standing up, and he tried to steady himself with deep breaths as the world started to sway and darken around him. It felt like someone was pushing on his chest, compressing his ribs to the point where it hurt, and he struggled to take in any air at all. “I’ll be right back.” He carefully made his way into the restroom, weaving around whatever was in his way and barely managed to keep himself composed before locking himself in a stall.
“Well hello, Mister Malfoy.” Her voice was pitched higher than normal and sickly sweet, and she drew out his name in a way that made a nervous flutter appear in his gut. “Nice of you to join me.” Her dress is skin-tight and made of black silk, a slit cutting high up her thigh and revealing a decent amount of skin as she recrossed her legs when he sat down in the chair opposite her, unbuttoning his jacket as he did. “I’ve taken the liberty to order some wine, since you took your sweet time in joining me.”
That was the question, wasn’t it - it wasn’t about whether he did awful things, everyone already knew the answer to that, it was more about whether he felt some remorse about any of them.
around the room in an attempt to hide its contents from his mother, not that he expected it to help, and then he took a deep breath before breaking the wax seal.
of yours would get out of hand and this is only the beginning of it, he is going to hurt you even if you do just stay friends, don’t you get that? He’s already cut you open and left you to die once, is he going to have to try to kill you again in order for you to open your damn eyes?”
, this was - it seemed like speaking terms now. Most of the words didn’t stick in his brain for the first few read-throughs, only the underlined bits and the greeting, the
He saw them do a double-take before leaning back in their chair. “You’re early,” Potter said, seeming somewhat confused. Draco noticed they were reading the same book, the title still not appearing familiar, but he watched them put the paperback down without marking their page; that level of attention directed his way sent a warmth flowing through him for a moment.
He turned towards them, holding the parchment up and shaking it a bit. “I’ve been summoned to coffee tomorrow by some unknown party that managed to sneak a letter through the Ministry’s defenses.”
threatening to burn holes into his robes. “Then, Mister Potter, can you explain to me why you’re here testifying on Mister Malfoy’s behalf? He treated you horribly for so many years, he stood by and participated in the torture of your friends, yet you’re vouching for his innocence and freedom. Is it some sort of hero complex from the wizarding saviour, missing the spotlight now that the war has ended and the fame is starting to fall away?”
“Fine, mum,” he answered on instinct, and then he realized his hands were shaking so he quickly stuffed them into his pockets. “I’m guessing the Ministry opened a lot more like this during the trial.”
Ah. He was mildly surprised by the question, wondering where Potter had been hearing gossip about him. “It was called off shortly before my trial started,” he said coolly, watching as their expression changed to confusion. “Her family didn’t want my tainted blood to be mixed with her respectable family name.”
had sung tales of how the great Harry Potter had defied death not once but twice, but it would be different, hearing it from the mouth of Saint Potter himself.
Their defense of his abilities left him completely stunned, and he worried that his jaw was hanging down to the floor. What could he possibly say to that? “Thanks,” he managed in a strangled-sounding voice, nodding and trying to look composed, and inside he was about to burst with how pleased he was at their support. “No rest for the wicked and all, you know how it is.”
“Hey,” they replied, shifting a receipt paper to mark their place before closing the book. “I wasn’t sure if you’d want coffee or tea or anything, but they gave me a few water glasses when I got my drink.” He gestured to a black-lidded cup in front of him and the two smaller, clear glasses next to it. “I can go up to get you something.”
“Hey, Amber, can I have my regular?” Potter’s moving now, passing him to wander down the aisle, and she’s pulled out a small notepad from her apron. “But with chai instead of tea, it’s a bit chilly out.”
“I told you Malfoy, I don’t think you’re all bad. I think your dad and friend choices are pretty shit, but I am going to actively try to give you that second chance.” They shifted, taking a sip of water before pushing on the table to stand, and gazing up at Potter was a view he hadn’t known he wanted. There was definitely a hint of something gold shining in their dark, birdsnest of hair - if Draco did believe in the muggle idea of angels, he was sure that the Boy Who Lived was the most revered of them all. “Just - if you want it,” they continued, pulling his mind back into the cafe. “There is an open invitation for drinks when you can get regular owls again, my schedule is - it’s pretty flexible now.”
Potter carefully stood up, stretching a bit. “That was really good, I needed that.” Draco silently nodded his agreement, finishing the last swallow of chai before pushing to stand as well. “Hey, I want to show you something.” If it had been anyone else alarm bells would have been going off, warning him away from following into a trap, but this was Potter - if the idiot Gryffindor wanted him gone there had been plenty of other chances.
Draco was only kept waiting outside the pub for a few minutes before Potter came strolling up, wearing a soft-looking T-shirt under a yellow-and-cream flannel button-up, and he could barely resist making a comment about Hufflepuff as he nodded his head in greeting.
“Great. Okay, well, see you around then.” Harry waved awkwardly before apparating with a quiet pop, and Draco collapsed back down onto the bench, burying his face in his hands. They knew, they had to know what they were doing and it was payback for everything he had done when they were children, this leading him on was intentional and he deserved it and he wanted nothing more than to be reading up on the roof of the Malfoy manor where if he looked over the gutter he could nearly see himself sprawled out on the grass below; certainly that wouldn’t be as painful as whatever game this was that the two of them were playing.
So they wanted there to be a next time, despite it all, and something inside him settled with a quiet purr. The inside was surprisingly spacious, a few tables and booths lining the walls, pictures of various plants and landscapes framed around the room, and he awkwardly stepped up to the empty host podium. From what he could see, they were the only people in the restaurant. “Hello?” he hesitantly called, instinctively taking a step back as someone peeked out from a side door where he assumed the kitchens were.
That was the first time in his life, the first time he had ever said his dirty little secret out loud to anyone, including himself, and it was to the very object of his affection. His face felt hot as he just sat there, hands twisting in his lap so tightly that his fingers started to go numb. Merlin he was so fucking stupid, why did he say that, why did he sit down when they told him to-
”, fingers holding the rim as the water stream flowed from his palm, setting the cup down after it was three-quarters full. Merlin, his hands were shaking enough to splash some of the liquid onto the tabletop. When he raised his head Potter’s eyes flicked over to the auror on Draco’s left, and he waved his free hand in their general direction. “This is Aedan Firethron, he’s with the aurors. I’ve apparently been assigned a guard for the duration of the hearing.”
, he privately corrects, but he doesn’t think this confessional is the right place for it.
The apprehension was obvious on their face. “Draco, are you... Are you sure that’s wise? It could be a trap by someone intending to - to finish you off, perhaps on behalf of He Who Must Not Be Named.”
started whispering amongst themselves, noise bolstered by the rustling of robes and soft creaks of the wooden benches. On the edges of his vision he could see some members of the

It seemed to shoot him an impatient glare before gliding away, vanishing into the afternoon sky with a silent, single flap of its wings, and Draco watched it go with only a slight turn of his stomach.
Draco froze, and he swore that his entire life flashed before his eyes. “I... I was scared of what I would say under

“Sorry, I -” The sound of their voice pulled him out of the nightmare with a sharp inhale and he could hear them shift to stand. “I should let you get going, we’ve been out here for longer than I thought.”
Draco laughed, but there was no humor in it. “I have learned that there is no real rest for the wicked, not even death.” He looked up at them, the pad of his thumb running back and forth over one of the ridged edges of the saucer, and he took a moment to choose his next words carefully. “Do you believe them?” he said quietly, and he knew they needed no clarification on what he was asking about.

will meet on their own and decide how to proceed, and we will send an owl when we have come to a decision.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” The man was only a few inches shorter than him but Draco enjoyed it, crouching slightly so they were eye level. “Next time, try to mind your own business. Don’t be a hero.” He straightened, circling to stand behind them with his wand tip pressing gently into the back of their head, and he could hear a muffled sob come from the man. “
pretty much dead on, and then he’d wanted to make sure I was actually dead, yknow, since I am the Boy Who Lived.”
peering down at him with thinly veiled pity. He realizes the loud throbbing in his head is his heartbeat thudding in his ears. “You sounded like you were in distress,” she added primly, and Draco quickly shook his head.
The morning after his charges were cleared, three things happened all at once. First, his mother officially apparated back to Malfoy Manor with her normal excessive flair and zero warning, trunk landing in the entryway with a loud thud that made him nearly jump out of his skin mid-swallow; second, three different owls came down the unlit fireplace in a loud whoosh, settling onto various perches on chair backs and sculptures around the grand hallway, their large eyes following his every move; and third, through really no fault of his own, he spilled the tea and completely soaked the front of his only maroon-colored jumper.
The owl, a large Great Horned with wide eyes that seemed to see through to his soul, had followed him throughout the house by hopping between windowsills, tapping impatiently on the glass panes of the study. “I’m coming,” he muttered, stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, message facing outwards, and crossed out the
“Draco listen to yourself! He’s what you used to be, he’s got all the power and admiration of the whole wizarding world behind him, he’s just leading you on until he gets what he wants!”
“Oh fuck off Potter, you don’t have to pretend like you care for my sake.” They visibly flinched and he swallowed the guilt with a large mouthful of chai. It was warm, the cardamom lingering in a way that tasted of fall, and he found himself longing for the last family orchard trip when he was thirteen. “It wasn’t this elaborate assassination plot that you could’ve prevented. I walked into the bookstore, got my things, left, and got dragged into an alley by a couple of people calling me foul names and talking about how I’d pay for my family’s crimes during the war, the usual. I managed to break free and apparated out the moment I could, no harm done.” He was lying, and he was sure Potter knew, but for now he could hold back the memories of the fingers threatening to scalp him, of the punches and kicks and bruised ribs he was hiding under his turtleneck.
“How long has it been?”
was hearing about the horrors that people - no, that children, had to go through during the war. The only sound is the light scratching of what had to be Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes-Quill against parchment somewhere in the audience section behind him, and he’s staring at the marble floor as if he could force it to open and swallow him whole by sheer will alone. Then someone coughed quietly, Draco isn’t sure where, and it was like a spell had been broken: some members of the audience and the
Her face shifted through a myriad of expressions, finally settling on a wrinkled nose as she looked him over. “And what did the Golden Boy want?”
“Crystal-” she choked out and he instantly stepped back to release her, arms out and ready to catch her as she slumped back against the wall with a gasp. “Merlin’s dick Draco, I’m not - I’m not as alive as Potter, you can’t keep doing this...”
. Draco didn’t dare breathe, but he could hear them shifting in their wooden chair, and he swore there was a Dementor cape hem flitting along the edge of his vision. “Said my testimony gave some mixed reviews and he wanted to talk.”
Draco was pulled from his thoughts as Aedan knocked softly on the doorframe, turning and looking up enough to meet the auror’s gaze, and he could see his own wishes reflected back in their eyes. “I’m not going to get my hopes up,” he lied, stepping back from the window. “It’s not - I’m not stupid you know, it’s never going to happen.”
Hearing You-Know-Who’s name again paired with thoughts of the war almost immediately sent him spiraling into a panic attack, and beneath the table his fingers clawed at his thighs as he tried to calm his heart down. “Are you really sure you want to hear it?” he asked quietly, not that he’d tell them much, and after they nodded he closed his eyes. “For starters, he wanted me to kill you, or at least bring you to him. Drilled it into me every time I came home for breaks. Had me lure and
“Is it true that he has intentionally gone out of his way to make your life much more difficult than it should have been, including giving a highly dangerous, cursed item to a member of your Quidditch team, and interfering with your time spent in classes?”
“Always are. It’s nice to be doing this with you again.” He waved his wand to vanish the ropes and gag before slipping it back into his sleeve, waiting for her to catch up as they started towards the entrance of the alley. “Next time I have news I’ll save it for after you’ve eaten and are too tired to come after me.”
Draco silently raised an eyebrow at the obvious affection between the two of them, moving back again to give them some space. A jealous, pathetic side of him wondered if this girl was why Potter and the Weasley girl didn’t work out but he immediately dismissed it; she was far too young, definitely didn’t fit their shoulder-length-hair-older-brothers-always-about-to-cry type of girl the Chosen One always seemed to chase after. He’d know, having spent so many years watching them from afar.
The ache from before, when they had figured it out, reappeared in his chest, and Draco dropped his head to look at his hands as they circled the plastic cup. “Since the end of our fifth year at Hogwarts, just over three years,” he replied quietly, and he hated himself more for each day that passed. “Too long. It’s - it’s been too long.”
“Draco you need to testify,” she said in a low, fierce voice, and by the movement of her head, he could tell she shifted her attention to the members of the
There was a moment of silence, then the witch whose voice he would hear in his sleep tonight started speaking again. “Our next round of questioning will be with the accused, Mister Draco Malfoy, in order to verify Mister Potter’s recounting of events and offer his own explanation for certain situations during the war. Because of his alleged crimes, talent for potion-making, and family history, the
“So, have you decided what you want to eat?” Amber had crept up on them, hands on her hips. “Harry stop distracting him, Draco needs to eat too.”
The witch smiled down at him, and this time it struck a chord of fear into his bones. “If Mister Malfoy has nothing to say to us then I suggest we end the hearing here for the time being. The
Potter seemed to pause for a moment before returning the smile, shoving their hands into the pockets of their robes. “Works for me. I’ve, uhm, I’ve got to get going, auror stuff, but I look forward to hearing that you’re cleared of everything. See you around, Malfoy.”
“Fine,” he and Potter snapped back in unison, sitting down hard, and he could see Aedan’s eyes narrowing suspiciously.
was struck by a swarm of low whispers.
“Your hand in marriage.”
He watched Potter make a show of rolling their eyes, clasping his hands behind his back to fidget with his ring. What would they say about him? ‘He’s tried to kill me a couple of times, worked for this other guy that tried to kill me, last week he told me he loves me so it’s complicated’? “Amber, this is Draco Malfoy, we were in the same year of that boarding school I told you about,” they said, gesturing vaguely towards him. “We never really had the chance to talk, what with classes and house rivalries and all, but now that we’re out we’ve got a bit of time to properly catch up.”
“Interesting, what sort of business? Who’re you hiding under there?”
He stared at them. “You’ve gone mad. Dying killed off any brain cells you had left.”
“Well yeah, he murdered all the house elves after I escaped and you all needed to eat.” Potter shrugged, and Draco knew they were both thinking about Dobby - his mother had told him what happened, how Potter had set up an official grave on the coast somewhere, but the only thing he could picture was the stern scolding the house elf had given him when he had whipped around the manor on his first broomstick and knocked himself unconscious on a lower-than-average door frame. “I spend enough time at this restaurant for the owners to know me by name, so just brace yourself for that.”
He mimicked them despite how shaky he felt after the visions, rolling his shoulders back. “Don’t worry about it. I’m not out long enough to see the sunset much anymore, this was nice.” Almost on instinct, he turned to face them, finally able to look them over completely. The wind had picked up a little more, tousling their hair in the way a Quidditch game used to, something lost and distant in the Gryffindor’s gaze when they finally met his eyes.
What a way to wake up, threatened in his own home. His eyes followed the wand up to the face of a man only a few years older than he was. He was handsome, in his own way, a hint of sandy stubble lining their jaw, and he noticed the edge of a tattoo peeking out of the edge of the neckline of their clothes. “You must be with the Ministry of Magic,” he replied, giving no sign he heard their instructions and choosing to duck under their arm as he started towards the kitchen. Part of him was hesitant about turning his back to the man, but really, he barely had any reason to keep living anymore; let the curses come. “I’d appreciate an explanation as to who exactly you are and why you were trying to break down my door at such an ungodly hour.”
There was a murmur that rippled throughout the room, and then suddenly some members of the
Just the thought made his stomach grumble eagerly. It had been so, so long since he had eaten something other than a homecooked meal from his mother or himself, especially a dish with as much flavour as a curry. “I don’t think I’ve had Indian food since before the war,” he admitted, shrugging when their head whipped around to reveal an astonished expression. “Don’t look at me like that, I was virtually on house arrest for the last few years. You really think the Dark Lord would just let us get takeaway for dinner?”
Their reply made him pause for a moment; there was one person that was here on his side, that didn’t believe he was the same degree of monster as his father. “Thank you,” Draco replied with a small nod, pushing away from the counter and starting towards the hall. “If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go get ready for the hearing. Help yourself to any tea or biscuits, I’m sure such a talented auror like yourself should be able to find everything without too much trouble.” He waved aimlessly at the cupboards behind him as he passed through the doorway, slipping his wand into his back pocket, and before he had even reached the stairs his mind was already trying to come up with realistic reasons why Potter wanted to come to his rescue.
and be damned to Azkaban for the rest of his life than watch them get hurt anymore, but Potter just sat there, staring out at the mess with only a hint of apprehension on his face. An unrecognizable voice in the audience section behind him was shouting loud enough to nearly drown out the other noise, going on about the real monster in the room.
, it could be cursed - he didn’t know why he suddenly cared about living, but the idea of having his head blown off didn’t appeal to him too much. “Alright.” He held the envelope at arm’s length and carefully popped the seal, bracing himself, bringing it closer when nothing happened. “It’s a normal letter?” From the corner of his eye he could see Aedan getting his wand at the ready. Gingerly Draco pulled the parchment free of the envelope, unfolding it, and after a quick scan of the recognizable handwriting he felt like he might faint.
“I’m fine,” he replied quickly, closing his eyes to steady himself and shaking his head. “We’re just - we’re going to London again soon.” Potter had written to him again, had even asked to meet, he hadn’t messed everything up, and the world spun for a moment.
Draco held up a hand to stop them, standing up suddenly. “I would like to go home now,” he said stiffly. His head was spinning from the fast movement but he couldn’t stand it, he couldn’t let them finish their thought and feed the false hope that lived inside of him. “Please.”
“Yeah yeah, you’ve already used that line tonight,” she replied impatiently, waving her hand. “Look, Draco I just - I don’t want to watch you get dragged down by his stupid hero antics, alright? I told you a long time ago that this- this
and pointedly ignoring the article written about his trial, when the large black-and-grey speckled owl tapped impatiently on the glass of his window with its beak and made him jump. The sound startled him, much more than he’d care to admit, and he turned the envelope over in his hands after taking it from the bird. There was no family crest or identifying image stamped into the wax seal, nothing interesting or different about the parchment, and after gently opening the letter he tossed the owl a treat from the jar on his desk. It took him a few read-throughs to decipher the messy, looping handwriting, and the lines slanted up to the right corner of the scrap of parchment.
Draco swallowed hard, trying to come up with the right words to say and finally just nodding. “My, uhm-” He cleared his throat and hated himself for the way his voice shook. “It would have been disastrous for - for the both of us, our reputations and the trials and everything. My mother would have disowned me on the spot,
“Shit.” She looked at him then back towards the main street, and the shadows on her face looked deeper than before. “Well. I suppose if anyone could confess to a murder and get off, it would be him.”
was on the tip of his tongue but thought better of it, shaking his head. “You’re the savior of the wizarding world,” he finished awkwardly, and the slight wince they made at the title didn’t go unnoticed. “It’s not like we can just visit Hogsmede together on a weekend off.”
reactions and witnesses testimonies, then suddenly I see ‘Harry Potter Clears Young Malfoy of Death Eater Charges’ as a headline? Who did you pay off?”
Fuck. His gaze seemed drawn to Potter as he clung to the arms of the chair like a lifeline, and when their eyes shifted over, he flushed and quickly looked down after nearly being caught staring. He remembered the night they were referring to; he remembered every single second of it, and it had been one of the most terrifying evenings of his entire existence. Bellatrix had known, she had to have known that it really was Potter and that of course Draco would be able to identify him, and that’s why she had shoved him up close and dangled Potter’s life in his hands and made sure he’d be the one to suffer for letting him slip through their fingers.
Their emerald eyes moved up to meet his own, and the searching way they gazed at him made Draco want to take a step back. “Yeah - I mean yeah I do. I blacked out for a minute, and then I ended up at this train station, Dumbledore was there, and we talked for a bit, but basically, he told me I had a choice, about coming back or not. I think the - the option I chose is pretty obvious, I came back, it felt like I got run over by the Knight Bus a couple of times but it was better than just staying dead, you know?”
He cleared his throat awkwardly, but Potter stayed quiet until stopping outside a small restaurant on one corner of a strip mall, gesturing up to a large, minimalist neon sign above the entrance that read “
That had been a mistake. She whirled to face him, marching up until they were nearly toe-to-toe, her voice going dangerously low. “He is going to use you, you stupid walnut. He’s an auror now, and if you don’t think priority number one on all their lists is ‘get rid of all the Malfoys that are left’, then you’ve got nothing but rocks sloshing about for a brain.”
, there to make a proper first impression. They wanted to meet in three nights, at some pub named The Lion & The Snake in some village just outside London, and the irony of the name wasn't lost on him.
Draco nodded, still keeping his head turned as he looked at the next letter, held by a cross-looking Snowy owl. Even at first glance he could tell this was from Pansy; it had her signature, excessively-looped cursive on the front, and the edges were creased as sharp as a knife blade. He broke the deep purple, stamped seal and pulled out a short yet vaguely threatening invitation to a celebration dinner, her treat, scheduled a few days after his meeting with Potter. Her written goodbye made him roll his eyes, swearing she would give
“Oh.” His cheeks turned warm and he cleared his throat, pointedly avoiding their eyes again. “I, uhm, I haven’t yet, thank you for reminding me.” Merlin he was pathetic - he would need a glass of wine before bed if he was expecting to sleep tonight.
Again they paused and inwardly Draco groaned, using one hand to gently massage his temples. “I am truly sorry, Mister Malfoy, but I don’t think I am able to discuss such things with you, even if it does concern you and your safety,” the auror said slowly, shaking their head.
Why did he hesitate? She was his best friend, really one of his only friends, and she would rather die than tell any of his secrets. “Potter did,” he admitted, trying to swallow the blush that was already threatening to creep onto his cheeks, and her laugh made it appear faster.
“I see.” Draco winced inwardly at the formality of everything, slowly taking a sip from the glass of water in front of him. “It should be a quick recovery, I believe. I’m already starting to feel better.” He could feel eyes on him and turned, catching Aedan’s gaze with a raised eyebrow before they could pull it away. “What?”
“Fucking hell, can’t I just bloody sleep!” The punch to the sturdy wooden mantle barely registered until after it happened and he pulled his hand back to cut knuckles, smearing the blood with his other hand as the wounds stung. The trial slideshow started again, and he could hear his mother in the viewing section, openly and quietly weeping for the first time in his life. Rita Skeeter had finished a Quick-Quotes-Quill page before anyone had spoken, and that first time he twisted around he had found a set of fern-colored, haunted eyes at the back of the room. Draco had never felt as small as he did in that moment.
“I am sorry.” Their voice is soft, and full of more compassion and empathy than he had heard in a long, long time. “He is the one that contacted you about today, yes? Perhaps there is a chance-”
from across the table.
Draco looked up from his drink to meet their gaze. “You are allowed to call me Draco, if you insist on trying this ‘friend’ thing out.”
He could hear them suck in a sharp breath, like they wanted to shout something, and then Amber reappeared with steaming bowls. “Alrighty, here’s your paneer makhani Harry, and the lamb biryani for you, and a naan for each... Either of you want more chai?”
his baby pictures if he didn’t show up, signing it with a glittering “
”, and he felt a swell of affection towards her. These few weeks during the trial had been incredibly lonely, especially without mail of any sort, and it was flattering to have two separate event invitations waiting.
“Are you sorry?” The cafe chair creaked, and he opened his eyes to see Potter staring at him intently, arms resting gently on the table. “Because I don’t think you are. I can think of one- no, two, literally only two good things you’ve ever done in your life, and I can tell you only did them because they’d benefit you too.”
This surprising topic change sent a hint of concern coursing through him: his mother had somehow remained free of any charges from the Ministry for her roles before and during the war, and Draco didn’t want to picture her locked in Azkaban, growing old in a cell like his father. He raised his head to watch the court proceedings again, and the concern was magnified when he saw Potter hesitate. “Well,” they said slowly, and Draco found himself gnawing on the inside of his cheek. “I don’t really feel like that’s - like it’s my place to say, yknow. I don’t exactly know what goes on in her head, that was always Voldemort’s kind of style.”
“I told you, I don’t get it either, okay?” he replied quietly, and he dug his nails into his palms when she closed her eyes on her next deep inhale. “He’s the reason I’m not in Azkaban Pans, he testified about that time with the Snatchers and said that if they were going to persecute me for doing things out of fear for my life and the lives of my family, they were going to have to come after him too. He brought up leaving Crabbe behind.”
“Absolutely not.” Potter ducked his hand under hers to shove the bills into the front pocket of her apron, shaking his head, but there was an easy, relaxed upwards curve to their lips. “You keep it. Use it for something good, or else.”
. Look at me, idiot.” They snapped their fingers at him and Draco pulled himself out of the daze that their words sent him to, slowly lifting his eyes up to meet theirs. “Don’t you get it? I think you’re an annoying prat, but I don’t - I really don’t think you deserve Azkaban, I think you deserve a chance to get out of your stupid house and see that pretty much everything about you and everything you do is bigoted and cruel and get to maybe change that. We both know the only way you’d get that is if me, the Boy Who Lived, the great Harry Potter, spoke at your trial on your behalf.”
Aedan held out his hand and Draco pushed the letter into it, trying to focus on breathing as his knees threatened to buckle from beneath him. Flashes of memories rippled through his mind’s eye, of black hair and crimson Quidditch robes and glimpses of the golden snitch, and then when he realized the auror was calling his name it sounded far away.
They looked grown up now, like all their proportions had worked themselves out nicely; their shoulders had broadened, some stubble had grown along the jawline that had appeared in the last few months, and he could even see faint outlines of pectoral muscles beneath their shirt as they breathed. However, the dark, bruise-coloured circles under Potter’s eyes didn't go unnoticed either - Draco privately thought that they had started to rival his own.
Draco waved a hand dismissively, turning back towards his desk and picking up the paper again. “It’s a muggle place, surely it can’t be too dangerous.” And if the mysterious sender really did want to finish him off, he might thank them first.
“But.” That one word made his heart skip and Draco didn’t know how he felt about it, because there was something different in it, a tone he’d never heard from them before. “They’re all gone, all those bad influences are gone, well at least most of them are, and I’m hoping now that they’re all out of the picture you’ll change.”
“Don’t say it,” Draco said harshly, and the thought brought an ugly warmth to his cheeks.
“Yes.” Draco couldn’t look at anyone, focusing on the floor just past his feet instead - he just kept seeing the lifeless expression Potter had on his face at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and if these memories stuck around for much longer he might lose what little composure he had with three hours of sleep. “Before I was on the ground,” they continued, “he’d hit me with
Harry attempted to fix the birdsnest atop his head with his fingers, and Draco smiled a bit because any work they did was almost immediately messed up by the breeze. “I had a brilliant time,” they admitted, and he was frozen in shock even as he noticed the faint blush on their cheeks. “Would you like to do this again, maybe next week? Same time, place, everything?”
“Oh my, Mister Potter, is that you? What are you doing all the way out here? This is a muggle town, shouldn’t you be back in London?” Instantly his blood ran cold - it was the same ballsy auror that had tried to kill him, in the Ministry of Magic no less, a Teddy Fel-something.
Hello everyone! I apologize for the long break, university started up again and then holidays happened, but here is another chapter! Hope you enjoy!
It suddenly hit him that Potter -
Their words are stiff and polite, more to fill the silence than actual interest. “A bit. Went to Diagon Alley to pick up some textbook to study from and was almost killed,” he admitted, and he lifted his gaze in time to see their eyes flash with something that he thought looked like fury. “What’s the story behind his place, Potter? It’s clear you’re a bit more than just a regular customer.”
as the trial drawing goosebumps to his skin and seeping through his bones. Draco opened his mouth to talk, didn't even have a plan for what to say, but Potter held up a hand to stop him before he could utter a sound. “Don’t you dare Malfoy, I don’t want to hear your voice, not until I’m finished, or I’m leaving and you’ll be left alone again.”
“Everything okay, Mister Malfoy?” The witch’s high-pitched voice jerks him back into the courtroom, wrists instinctively pushing up against the manacles holding them to the chair, and when he opens his eyes the fifty faces of the
“Ugh, absolutely not! Mum would kill me if she knew I let you pay for your food!” She pushed the money back towards his chest, crossing her arms, and briefly Draco wondered if this was how normal cousins interacted; the familiarity between the two was obvious. “Keep it, Harry!”
“Draco this is more than a bug, is it poison? Do you think there was something in your cup? Would Harry Potter try to -”
They smiled a little, shrugging and shifting to lean on the table with one arm. “Her dad died last year, some brain aneurysm they couldn’t catch until he passed away, and her and her mum fell on hard times. I came here a decent amount before then, but I had enough saved in the fund from my parents, and the reward money from the Ministry and everything to help support them until they could be back on their feet. I think her mum considers me to be some miracle son she never had.” They paused to take a sip of the chai and Draco waited patiently, wrapping his hands around the mug to let the warmth seep into his fingers. “They spoil me with good food, and if I ever need to go underground again, they would do whatever it took to get me out of the country.”
There was no change in Potter’s expression when he brought up Aedan, not that he’d been expecting one, and he stayed standing when the auror took the cup and settled into the chair diagonal to the Boy Who Lived. “He is the easiest assignment I have had in a long time,” they commented, silently mimicking Draco and filling his glass, the water moving much quicker from his hand. “You are Harry Potter, yes? You spoke at Draco’s trial.”
Their hands, looking much more worn and used than his own, appeared on the table not far from his glass. “After the trial the Minister pulled me to the side and asked for an individual statement.”
“Hermione made me a modified charm for it, like a long-term glamour almost, she’s quite good at that sort of thing.” He looked up just in time to see them tilt their head back for a large, last swallow of beer, and their hair fell just right to where it looked halfway decent in the pub’s dim lighting. “She’ll make a brilliant Minister when she actually has time to run.”
and absolutely towering over the room once he was on his feet. The tip of their wand pressed into his cheek and then his voice boomed. “Silence!” they roared, voice magnified enough to echo around inside Draco’s skull, and the wizards and witches he could see had their hands clapped over their ears. Everything became so quiet he swore he could hear the blood rushing through his body. “There will be no one speaking apart from the investigator and the witness, and if there are any further outbursts, I will not hesitate to remove people from this courtroom.” As they sank down into their seat again they gazed over everyone with a stern expression, pulling their wand away from their cheek and nodding at the witch on their right. “You may continue.”
Draco delicately separated the cups, keeping his gaze down, shaking his head and holding out one to Aedan. “Water is fine for me, thank you. I’ve been drinking far too much tea lately.” He mumbled an “
She turned her attention back to Potter, taking a quick glance at the stack of parchment before speaking again. “So, as you were saying, she lied and kept you alive despite a direct order?”
They shrugged and stood, grabbing their jacket and draping it over their left arm. “I’ve said everything that needs to be said.” Draco felt frozen in place, watching as Saviour Potter made their way out of the witness seats and brushed past his chair with a side glance, most likely going to a seat in the back of the audience section. This was the closest they had been since that time in the manor, and the faint smell of their cologne, something warm and familiar, drifted into his lungs and clung to his insides like thorns, making him swallow hard and shift his gaze to the floor again. He wasn’t - he hadn’t been ready for this, to see
Draco resisted rolling his eyes in favour of shrugging. “It’s in part my fault as well, I wasn’t wearing proper glamours or anything.”
Draco was starting to spiral into yet another panic attack, fingers digging into his thighs so hard the muscles in his hands were starting to cramp. Would Potter be able to fight this Ferlet guy off if he did get found out? How stupid would that be, declared free by the Ministry then killed off by one of their employees. He froze when there was a hand threateningly placed on his shoulder, holding his breath, then there was a string of curses coming from the auror and the hand left.
“Hey! Hey, get off her, stop!” Draco turned his head enough to trace the shouting to some muggle man running down the alley at them. “Let her go!”
“We’d better not, I don’t think I’m quite ready to wear boots again.” Draco slipped into the booth seat across from the Gryffindor and was instantly reminded of
“Leaving already?” Amber is suddenly back at their table, pouting a little with her hands on her hips. “It feels like you just got here...”
? Someone’s gone and carved something into your skin??” Their small nod made his stomach turn and he felt nauseous. “I must hot - no, wait - I must not tell lies,” he sounded out quietly, leaning forward to see it clearer. “Merlin... Who did this? And when? It looks fresh.” Without thinking he reached out to brush his fingertips over the marks, the area more raised and rough than he expected, but the undamaged parts were soft, and then he jerked his hand back as if he was burned because he was nearly holding hands with
. He glanced over at Aedan, nodding slowly after snapping his jaw shut, and beneath the table his hands knotted together, thumb rubbing along a rough scratch on his knuckle.
A short, half-hearted laugh came from Potter and they took a sip from their lidded drink, nodding. “The one and only.” He noticed they seemed to be bracing for something.
lately.” He could see the way Potter’s face tightened a bit as he talked and he was silently thankful he had enough sense to not call her the Weaslette like he tended to do.
The same witch that spoke earlier shuffled through a stack of parchment held in one arm before looking up. “Now, Mister Potter, can you give us a little background about yourself please? Explain your relationship with Mister Malfoy, that sort of thing, whenever you’re ready.” She gave him a short nod, and Draco noticed that Potter looked slightly uncomfortable.
“I -” He struggled to keep his voice nonchalant, wracking his brain for a way to brush off his mess of an appearance, and he can feel nothing but the loud, hurried thudding in his chest. “I’m fine, just - just a stomach bug, I’m sure.” The words came out as shaky as he felt. Another gag shuddered its way through him and he could barely swallow it down, the effort nearly making his knees give out.
“Sorry, sorry,” they apologized, but it seemed like an afterthought, and they had their hand out as if they were planning to catch him. “I was trying to find you before the owl left, this - this was just delivered for you.” It took him a moment but his eyes focused on the envelope held in their other hand, taking a step forward before all but snatching it.
wouldn’t take kindly to being mocked by a war criminal.
“I hate you,” she snapped back, and then she sighed and gave them a tight hug. “Mum misses you, stop by after close sometime so we can all catch up.” Then to Draco’s surprise, Amber pulled him into a hug as well, her head not even reaching his shoulders, and he hesitantly returned it before she stepped back, smile mimicking Potter’s. “It was lovely to meet you, Draco,” she said with a wink before turning away to go back to the kitchens, and his heart skipped a beat because it sounded like she meant it.
all stood, talking amongst themselves, more than a few shooting furtive glances at him, and his cheeks burned as he stayed trapped in the chair.
A wave of quiet laughter traveled around the room, and he could picture Saviour Potter’s stupid, polite smile that Slughorn loved being flashed in the witness box. His eyes followed along a faint, spidering crack in the granite in front of him. “Mrs. Malfoy was told to come and check, to make sure I really was dead, um, and there’s literally no way she missed me breathing. So she kind of - she crouched down, almost like she was hiding me so no one could really see what was happening, and she asked me if Draco was still alive at the castle, and I had just seen him so I told her the truth, I told her yes. Next thing I know she’s up, she’s standing up and still kind of hiding me, and she looked him - she looked Voldemort right in the eyes and told him I was dead, she lied straight to his face. I’m pretty sure that if he had sent anyone, literally anyone else in his little camp thing, to come to check on me or even like double-check her work, I would not be sitting here right now. I bet she would’ve been murdered right after me, actually.”
The wine glass shattered in Pansy’s hand. He had enough time to throw his arms up over his face before shards flew everywhere, and in an instant no less than three of the wait staff appeared at their table, brushing the pieces off their laps in a chorus of apologies, and even as the adrenaline kept his heart racing, he recognized Pansy’s dangerous look, the one that had flashed in her eyes before one of the students that spilt their tea on her ended up in the lake with the giant squid. “We’re fine, we just - let’s get some air, Pans- ” Draco essentially shoved the closest waiter out of the way as he grabbed her hand and bolted for the door, feeling the eyes of the other diners on their backs as they fled, and he was incredibly thankful that she waited until they were in a side alley to speak.
Something inside him snapped, and Draco saw red. “Don’t,” he said loudly, and when she didn’t acknowledge that he spoke he rushed her, using a hand on her shoulder to spin her to face him before shoving her back into the restaurant’s brick wall with his arm pressing into her neck. There was a loud huff, like all the air in her lungs was forced out on impact. “Don’t you ever compare me to my father again,” he hissed, pushing a little more of his weight into her windpipe, and a strangled sound slipped past her lips. Their faces were so close he could feel each of her heavy, desperate breaths on his cheek, her eyes wide and filled with a mix between pity and something else that made his stomach turn, and she had her hands wrapped around his forearm as if she meant to fight him off. “I am nothing like him, nothing.” The words came out as a low snarl, harsh enough to hurt his throat on the way out. His heart was pounding, thudding loudly in his ears, drawing out the sound of the main street completely. “Got it?”
He started towards them and the rest of the patrons went back to their drinks, groaning to himself when he got closer and can see they’re wearing the stupid leather jacket again. “Hello.”
Draco couldn’t hold back the shiver that whipped through him at hearing the Dark Lord’s name out loud, shaking his head. Him, a Malfoy, joining the aurors? Working for the Ministry? Potter couldn’t be serious, he’d be thrown out with a popular vote. “I’d never fit in there, not with everything that happened during the war. I have thought about joining the Healers though, I’m sure they need all the help they can get, and I’m at least decent with those types of potions. It’s more of a backstage role so there can’t be too many people trying to hex me all the time.”
Pansy locked eyes with him the moment he stepped foot in the lobby of
He closed his eyes again. The guilt for everything, for existing in such an awful way for so long, rushed him all at once. “I-” His voice cracked and beneath the table his too-short nails pushed crescents into his palms. “I’m sorry,” he managed to whisper, and he was, he had never felt more sorry in his entire life than in this muggle coffee shop chair with the Boy Who Lived sitting across from him as if they were friends.
Before Draco could even process what had happened Shacklebolt pounded his gavel on the top of his podium, nodding. “Court adjourned.” The members of the
When he recovered, face burning red from losing himself, he realized Potter - Merlin, were their cheeks pink as well? “It’s from - uhm -” They seemed a bit flustered. “It’s from Umbridge, actually, she uhm, she wasn’t a very big fan of me talking about Voldemort’s second coming.”
The clock on the mantle showed half-past three in the morning, and yet here he was, still awake. The trial flitted in front of his eyes like a hummingbird, hovering in flashes of color and a frantic pulse before vanishing again. He can still feel the tens of gazes trained on a healing bruise along his jaw from the attack just outside the Ministry, feel the manacles tightening on his wrists as the leader of the
, I even stole his wand for a bit. And - and I recently got his father thrown into Azkaban for the rest of his life, so there’s that, and I kind of reckon we’re a bit even now.”
Potter looked like he wanted to protest, then bit his tongue, covering his right hand with his left for a moment, and Draco watched as the skin was revealed without the concealment charm over it. The center of it was scarred, looking like it’s just beginning to fade from a raw, red color to a healing pink, and the longer he stared at it the worse he felt because there was nothing natural about this mark, not about any of their marks. “Merlin’s beard, is that - are those
A tear openly slid down his cheek before he could stop it and Draco quickly brushed it away, managing to give them a small smile. “Thank you.” If what they were saying was correct, he’d be free: no more threats, no more Ministry around every corner, no more worrying about what would happen to his mother if he’s gone. He’d get the chance to properly grow up, like they said.
They sighed, and the angle of the light above their head sent dramatic shadows stretching beneath their eyes. “What do you mean, what now? We’re trying to be friends, Malfoy, it's that sort of thing.”
“Right.” They didn’t sound convinced, and as if on cue, both of them raised their drink to their lips at the same time. Silence settled over the table again and it felt a bit lighter than last time, like some of the air had cleared, and he found himself smiling a bit at it all as another pair on the other side of the pub laughed. “Hey, Malfoy.”
Aedan’s storm-eyes sought out his own. “I believe that you were just a boy,” they replied simply, and Draco let out a slow breath as the words settled beneath his skin. “With your father, there is no question, as the courts have already decided. But you - who is to say how much control a boy has on his actions.”
“And?” The question slipped out before he could stop it so he sniffed once, hastily wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, then lifted his chin to meet their gaze. “Should I even bother returning home today, or are you going to just arrest me right here?”
Was it really that obvious, did it show in his eyes during the trial, did he slip up and say something because
After fifteen minutes of bouncing around that topic, it turned to something that caught his attention. “Is it true, what you said at the trial? You survived the killing curse head-on?” Aedan’s voice didn’t have any of the reverence Draco typically heard people use with the Boy Who Lived; it was full of curiosity and respect, but the words themselves were delivered as if they were part of a casual conversation. He was admittedly curious as well, eyes shifting up to watch as they spoke.
“Many of your former peers have claimed that Mister Malfoy has terrorized you and your friends on many occasions during your time at school, potentially starting the moment you first set foot on Hogwarts grounds. Is there any truth in those claims, Mister Potter?”
Hey everyone, hope you enjoyed! Please consider leaving a comment or kudos, I love hearing everyone's thoughts as time goes on.
from Hogwarts, he just hadn’t realized it until now, it had taken three years and far too many interactions for it to register.
He watched in disbelief, then embarrassment, as the auror laughed a little, shaking their head. “I am not here to pry into your thoughts, Draco. I just wanted to see if you had eaten lunch.”
They were looking at him strangely, some horror and pity starting to seep into their features, and Draco didn’t want to see it anymore so he took another long sip of his drink. “Did you recognize any of them? Any identifying marks, like a tattoo or family crest or anything? They can’t just do that, you were cleared by the Ministry!”
and tucking the handle of the wand behind his ear.
“Well then at least we know he doesn’t want me!” he shouted back, and any anger he had quickly seeped out as Pansy took a step backwards, expression dropping into something sadder that made him look away, and he tried to pretend he hadn’t said that out loud. “If he did intend to sell me out, don’t you think he would’ve done it that night? Or the day after? He’s not a Slytherin, he’s got no endgame Pans, he’s called Saint Potter for a bloody reason.”
The witch smiled again, but this time it never reached her eyes. She looked at her papers and cleared her throat softly before speaking. “Excellent, thank you Mister Potter. During our preliminary discussions, you mentioned that the Malfoy family helped protect you from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at multiple points throughout the war. One of these times serves as a sort of character testimony, discussing actions of one of his parents, and the other directly involves the actions of Mister Malfoy himself, is that correct?” After a short nod from Potter she continued. “Would you care to tell us about those, maybe starting with the Battle of Hogwarts and the character witness, then moving into the one discussing the Snatchers incident?”
Potter opened his mouth to start speaking and Draco dropped his gaze to the marbled floor, not even trying to pay attention to whatever they’re saying. He knows about the two instances she’s referring to and he can’t do it, he can’t think about those memories of the Dark Lord looming over his shoulder like a shadow or the times where he held so many lives in his palms and slept with a knife beneath his pillow, and he closed his eyes in an attempt to catch the breath that’s suddenly escaped him but all he can see is a lifeless hand dangling from the groundskeeper’s arms and everywhere he looks reeks of blood and death and-
It felt like he had only been there for a few moments before there was a hesitant knock on the stall door, echoing around the bathroom and making his entire body tense on instinct. Draco prayed to someone, anyone, to be left alone with his nightmares - he didn’t want to try to deal with a muggle in this state.
Even before he had handed over his reply his mind had been racing through his closet, trying to figure out what to wear for the meeting the next day. He had finally settled on a green turtleneck jumper and black blazer, maybe with some dark trousers, when he realized he was acting like some lovestruck teenage girl; he was an adult, old enough to not be fawning over the Chosen One like every other schoolgirl in the wizarding world. He was being ridiculous.
They sat in silence for a while as they ate, the restaurant soon humming with soft conversations from the other guests, and then Potter tried to get him talking again; all these small-talk topics, the news from
Wearily pushing up on the armrests to stand, Draco nodded at them. “Thank you,” he said quietly, rubbing at the red marks circling his wrists, and he turned towards the exit just in time to see his mother approaching him as Aedan backed away a bit. She looked as distraught as he’d expected, and he avoided her gaze for fear she’d see something reflected in his eyes.
Hey everyone, thank you for being patient with me! There is some choking/suffocation in the first half of this chapter. Hope you enjoy!
“If it was an invitation from someone that wanted to cause me harm, why would the Ministry actually allow it through?”
calls Mister Harry Potter to the witness area to speak on behalf of the accused, Mister Draco Malfoy.” The surprise must have shown on his face because some of the wizards in the lofted pews laughed softly amongst themselves. Shacklebolt, the Chief Warlock in this case, hadn’t said a word despite leading the first day of the trial completely on his own, and instead the speaker was a short, pudgy witch sitting to the right of Shacklebolt’s tall seat. Her blonde hair was stick-straight, barely reaching the tops of her robes and greasier than his own, but there was something in her eyes that made him want to take a step back, like when he had met Dolores Umbridge the first time.
“Brilliant.” The door to the pub swung open, something in Potter’s eyes growing dark when he saw the new person coming in the door, and Draco resisted the urge to spin around and see who it was. “It’s getting a bit late and I’ve got training tomorrow, you alright with heading out now?”
When Draco arrived outside the pub, he had to double-check Potter’s letter twice for the correct address. The building was tucked away into an alley, front weathered horribly and with windows that looked to be clouded with age, so much so that he could barely see the yellow light through them and thought it was abandoned. From what he had seen the village itself was quaint and mainly muggle, only a faint hum of magic in the air, and the main street was all small shops he’d never heard of.
He flinched at the memory of it, closing his eyes to get away from the desperation in hers and opening them quickly when Potter’s dead body appeared in the darkness. “It’s not going to be like that,” he tried, and she rolled her eyes, digging in her small clutch only to pull out a pack of cigarettes he didn’t know she still carried. “I thought you quit.”
“We’re on a break,” they said in a way that made his tiny flame of hope grow brighter and made him sure it was something a lot more permanent than a break. “She lost one of her brothers in the Battle of Hogwarts, we both survived a war, we needed time and space to figure ourselves out. She hated the spotlight anyway, wasn’t a fan of all the press that tends to follow me around.” Draco was quiet when they took a large, sighing drink from their bottle, but he didn’t miss the way they leaned heavily into the back wall of the booth - there was something else there, something that they seemed to be holding back, but he didn’t push it, especially not when he could feel those green eyes gazing at him so intently. “What’re you doing, now that you’re graduated and freed? I could help you get a proper new start with the aurors or something, your times with Voldemort would be a big help to the department.”
“So they trust it during the war when it was run by bloody Death Eaters, and now that it’s cleaned up its act they hate it? At least muggle loyalty makes sense.”
“There is always going to be a chance of that, regardless of if I testify or not.” She had reached for his hands and he pulled them away, carefully stepping around her and going towards the door. “I refuse to take a potion just to tell the truth about how the war went. It’s - it’s humiliating.”
“Yes.” Draco’s blood ran cold. No one, absolutely no one knew about that exchange apart from Professor Snape, and that had been because the man had saved him from bleeding to death on the bathroom floor - unless Potter had told someone. The spell itself had barely even landed, and any pain they had felt was from his sheer panic because of the
dissolved into conspiratorial whispers. “No,” he breathed, and the what-ifs ran through his mind faster than anything ever had: they’d question his motives, his reasons for lying to Bellatrix and for saving Potter, for not killing them when he had the chance, for letting them live when their death would have benefitted him so much, then his - his
“I know.” Draco risked another glance over at them and their face is unreadable, eyes distant as they stared out, and the sun is nearly gone from the sky. “Sometimes I think the living, the surviving of everything - sometimes I think that’s worse.” The words sank into his gut and the memories surface again, this time of icy, pale fingers and the deafening crackling of fire taller than he is, greedily engulfing the very air he needed to breathe, and then they both spun into the crystalline image of Potter’s - Harry’s - dead body in the Forbidden Forest that haunted him endlessly.
“Draco?” Aedan’s voice was filled with concern and Draco quickly wiped at his eyes with his sleeve, mouth still burning with the remnants of acid. Of course, of course it was him, his own guardian angel. “Are you okay? You have been gone longer than expected, it’s been nearly fifteen minutes. We got worried.” How had it been so long, it didn’t feel like he’d been breaking down for so long... His heart was pounding hard against his ribs at the threat of being found like this, caught being so pathetic he was sitting on the floor of a muggle bathroom and
When he finally pushed the door open and stepped inside, it was just as he expected - dusty lamps hung over wooden booths, soft music played from speakers in different parts of the room, and a few grizzled, tired-looking regulars raised their heads at the bar as he entered. He was out of place, that much was obvious - his black trousers and turtleneck were probably worth more Galleons than this building’s rent - and he awkwardly waited by the door for some sign of what to do next.
Potter had left - Draco wasn’t sure when, or how he felt about it, but their chair had been neatly pushed into the table and their funny cup with a lid was gone. Aedan was in the same spot as before, reading through a small black notebook with his brow furrowed, and they looked up as Draco gingerly sat down in the chair next to him. “He had a meeting to attend,” the auror said, nodding at the empty space across the table. “He sends his apologies, and said he’d owl about a better time, after you’re well again.”
“Me? Poison you? Are you accusing me of-”
As they paused to take a breath Draco closed his eyes. They were right - he was a bully, riding the high from his family’s wealth and bloodline as an excuse to torment everyone he had ever interacted with. He also would admit to himself, albeit hesitantly, that he hadn’t really changed since his school days. He had grown quieter, but a Ministry-imposed solitude would do that to anyone; his few conversations with Potter, with Aedan, even his own mother, still carried the cruel undertones they always had. Brief flashes of memories came and went, of their second-year duel and bickering in the Forbidden Forest and interrupting the final meeting of Dumbledore’s Army, and the same bit of fear from the hearing started to seep up closer to his chest.
- they didn’t like men, didn’t like him, didn’t like war criminals, it would never be anything more than that. Harry’s the one that breaks the stillness after a few minutes, the sky a glowing pink. Somehow the sounds of the city have faded around them. “Have you ever killed anyone, Malfoy?”
After they left the restaurant Harry silently led him through the village’s winding, weathered streets up to a park, finally stopping near a bench that overlooked a carefully kept pond and a perfect view of the sunset within a grove of trees. They both sat down almost simultaneously, not close enough to touch but close enough that it’s not seen as avoidance, and Draco was conscious of how much warmth the Chosen One was giving off compared to the evening chill of the air. He’s not sure when he changed his mind, moved from thinking of them as Potter-the-enemy to Harry-normal-guy-from-school, as if they were on a first-name basis, but he silently rolled the word around on his tongue and decided he liked the feel of it.
“They did. Your family has been very busy over the course of their existence.”
“Can I, uhm... Can I ask you something? About the trial?”
This sounded like a Ministry trap. “Does it matter?” he asked hesitantly, and when he snuck a glance at them their eyes were glazed over.
He could hear the soft click of her heels as she followed, and he assumed Aedan had fallen in-step behind both. “Draco, please,” she tried. “Be reasonable, I just don’t want you to end up like your father.”
. “Draco,” Aedan said again, more urgently this time, then they mumbled “

“No, I’m - I’m brilliant,” he managed after clearing his throat. “Brilliant.” His voice sounded foreign and raw, but she seemed to accept his response. Memories of the fight still flashed on the backs of his eyelids every time he blinked, still stealing some of his air each time.
“Ah. I see.”
“Draco?” He turned and his mother was standing in the doorway, hand against the weathered frame, her concern only showing in the faint crease of her forehead; she must have erased the silencing charm after sneaking up on him. “Are you alright?”
