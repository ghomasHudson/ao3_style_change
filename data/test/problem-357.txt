Draco cracked open one eye. “I would ask that you stop being a wanker and let me sleep in peace, considering how late
“It’s Malfoy. Being a prat is basically built into his genes. And besides, there are more important questions at hand here.” Ron’s tone shifted to something more serious, causing Harry to pause.
He intertwined his fingers with one of Draco’s hands and lifted it up, placing a soft kiss on the palm of Draco’s hand. “You act as though you weren’t enjoying every minute of it.
Harry awoke, sweaty and gasping from a nightmare, and felt the pangs of phantom pain around his scar. He sat up and pulled the bedcovers off, rubbing at his eyes tiredly.  Rather than return to a dreamscape full of flashes of green light and dying mothers, he opted to leave his apartments and go for a late night walk through the school again. The itch under his skin and the buzzing in his ears had returned, and returned with a vengeance, and he thought that maybe exercise of some sort would serve as a cure-all.
And why was he even upset? Why did he care so much about Draco fucking Malfoy talking to him anyway? He honestly felt like tearing his hair out from the roots, or setting something on fire.
That hadn’t been the response he was expecting from her, but it also gave him pause for a moment. Since when had he, really? He hadn’t given much thought about it, and the way they were right now felt like they way they had always been. But obviously this wasn’t true, and he was in unexplored territory with Draco.
“Nothing!” Harry waved his hands frantically. “I didn’t do anything. In fact, I tried to start a conversation with him, but he wasn’t interested. And then he asked me something and it startled me so I sort of...spilled pumpkin juice all over my plate. Then things got weird and he left the feast early and now I’m here, repeating the tale for you to laugh at me instead.”
Harry for his part, stayed silent and munched on his sandwich, watching Draco thoughtfully. The man had returned his gaze to the stars. He looked lost, and distant. Harry wanted to know what was on his mind, what had him inhabiting the Astronomy Tower for all this time, but part of him felt like maybe it wasn’t his place to ask. And he found that he was okay with that, that he was fine with just being near Draco.
“First of all, sod off for that comment about ‘Mione. Second of all, I just meant that you’re very, academic-minded, like her, and she always prepares and gets things done far in advance. So yes, I guess you could say I was complimenting you,” Harry said petulantly.
Malfoy pouted, but said nothing. They lapsed into silence, the air rather tense around them. Harry’s skin began to itch.
“I feel like this is where I ought to point out again I was almost a Slytherin,” said Harry as he unwrapped his own sandwich.
Hermione’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really? Oh, you must find out why, Harry. And then tell me, of course.”
“Now, form a line behind me and follow along. We’ll be entering the Great Hall shortly, where you’ll be sorted in front of your peers. I promise you all have nothing to worry about. In fact...well, you’ll just have to see for yourselves.” He gave them a promising wink, and turned on his foot, making his way across the flagged stone floor of the hall, and through the double doors leading to the Great Hall. He led the students to the stool where the Sorting Hat lay, but when he turned to McGonagall to grab the scroll with the list of student’s names, he stopped dead.
Something in Malfoy’s eyes hardened at Amara’s words, and he pulled her into a fierce hug. “Sweetheart, I’m so sorry.” He pulled out of the hug, and still holding her arms with both of his hands, looked her in the eyes. “I can tell you that I know what it’s like, not living up to your parents’ expectations. Perhaps it was good in the end that I did not live up to mine, and perhaps it will be good in the end, if your parents treat you the way they do for something not fully in your control, that you do not live up to theirs.”
Harry slunk out from where he was standing to where Malfoy was seated. “Er, how’d you know it was me, then?”
This year promised more excitement than most - Flitwick had finally retired, and along with the departure of the Slytherin head Caprine, that meant new staff members arriving. They hadn’t come to the school prior to the start of term like most of the other Professors usually did, and all McGonagall would tell him about the new Charms Professor was that they were renowned for their work in France. In wondering over his new peer, Harry felt like a small kid come Christmas Eve, bubbling over with curiosity that couldn’t be sated.
“I should have told you Draco was to be a professor here sooner. I can only imagine that his presence brings up a lot of rather conflicted feelings for you, but at the end of the day he will be a professor here and you must learn to accept that.” She steepled her fingers together and gave Harry a pleading look.
“Er, is that all you have to say, then?” Hermione usually didn’t choose to be cryptic and vague, she’d always been more to the point and blunt about the state of things, so Harry was irritated that it seemed this was all she felt the need to say right now.
“Oh, Amara,” Harry sighed. “Just because I lost my parents doesn’t mean you can’t complain about yours. My best friends complain about theirs all the time and I don’t mind. If you feel comfortable, you can tell me what’s going on with you and yours.” He finished filling her bowl with soup and set it down in front of her.
When things got to be too much, when the buzzing began to build up under Harry’s skin and he grew restless, Draco managed to just...know. He’d stop what he was doing and all but drag Harry by the ear out of the staffroom for a walk. And he never pressured Harry to talk, either. He filled the silence with his own mindless chatter.
A wave of guilt washed over Harry at that. He opened his mouth to apologize but Malfoy raised a hand to stop him. “Oh, don’t drown yourself in pity over something that happened twelve years ago. Anyway, I was going to toss the Cruciatus Curse at you, so we’ll call it even.”
“Yes, well. If I had to hazard a guess, you are not the only one,” Malfoy responded coolly. There was an odd note to his voice, a mixture of resignation and what Harry almost wanted to say was disappointment. Malfoy’s attention was directed firmly on his plate of food, his eyes refusing to meet Harry’s. They lapsed into silence, Malfoy seemingly uninterested in continuing the conversation and Harry not really knowing where to go with it.
Draco gave a suspiciously wet cough to clear his throat. “Well, then what was it?” he asked expectantly.
“The four houses are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. Each has its own unique history, and each has - no matter what you may have heard or been told - created many outstanding wixen.” Harry gave the students a meaningful stare, hoping that they had just got the message he had tried to impress upon them, before continuing on. “While at Hogwarts, your good deeds earn you house points and your bad ones take them away. At year’s end, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup. I am certain each of you will be a credit to the house you enter.”
“That’s literally why I’m here, Amara,” said Harry, gently this time. “To help you. I want to see you succeed, because I know that you can. You showed it yourself today, in class. So, tell me, please, Amara - what is going on?”
Like a freight train, the answer to Ron and Hermione’s questions hit him: He was in love with Draco Malfoy.
As he made his way through the halls, past empty classroom after empty classroom, his mind wandered to his parents. He wondered about their lives as students, wondered about what went through their heads as they walked the halls. There was only so much that secondhand accounts of their time at school could give him, and it was never enough.
“Uh-huh,” said Hermione, in a tone that implied the opposite was true. She gave him a long-suffering sigh. “You know, sometimes Harry, you’re incredibly thick.”
“So, did you bring this all the way from the feast then?” Harry asked, rifling around in his cupboards for some extra utensils and plates for Amara to use.
What made it worse was that now, when he wanted to avoid Draco, it seemed the man was omnipresent. Enter the library? Draco’s there, sitting by a window, reading some ancient Charms text. Stop by the kitchens? Draco’s there, making himself a cup of tea. Go for a walk around the lake? Draco’s there, seated under a large tree by the lake, despite it snowing.
The other man pursed his lips and frowned, a furrow appearing between his brows. “Do you really have so little faith in him, and in yourself, Harry?”
Draco glared at him from over the sandwich, but chewed in angry silence. He swallowed and then: “Didn’t I tell you not to come looking for me if you valued our friendship?”
“I...think this is something you need to figure out on your own. Just think about it. I think if you do, you’ll understand soon enough,” she promised. “Look, think about it this way. You spend as much time with Malfoy as you do with us when we’re around in person. Do the feelings you have about Malfoy apply to the way you feel about Ron and I?”
“You know. There are several great Slytherin wizards and so on and so forth and that even I almost was one.”
“Personally, I’d be all for hearing your suspicions, ‘Mione. It’d probably help me,” said Harry, with what he would not admit was a tinge of desperation in his voice.
“No, I have these things called eyes, and another thing most humans have called peripheral vision. I know you’re quite dense so you may never have heard of them before.”
Malfoy opened his mouth, but then paused, hesitation crossing his features. He schooled himself back into a more composed look, and then coughed to clear his throat. “I best take my leave early. I only arrived this morning, after all. Much is needed to prepare for the start of term. If you’ll excuse me then, Potter.” He placed his utensils down on his plate, got up, gave a nod to McGonagall and simply...walked out of the Great Hall.
“Your boundless wit never ceases to amuse.” Harry placed his head in one hand and leaned forward on one elbow, trying to see what Malfoy was writing. “What are you doing?”
“Hey, Miss Zinke,” Harry said sternly. “You are never a bother. And besides, if I really thought of you that way, I wouldn’t ask you to join me. Come on, you must be hungry.” He turned around and made his way to his desk, setting the tray down on it. Then he went and dragged the armchair next to the fireplace over to his desk. When he was finished, he saw that Amara was still standing in the doorway, watching him with hesitation in her eyes.
Harry felt eyes on him and he turned to the side. Malfoy was watching him, with an unreadable look in his eyes. Harry wanted to say it was one of concern, but that would require a level of hope that Harry didn’t have in him today. Instead, he just felt irritated at being examined like an insect under a microscope.
Harry turned his gaze toward the lake. Snow was falling in fast flakes, coating the ice on the surface of the lake. He stayed silent for another moment, thinking. He’d hurt Draco, already. Made him think he wasn’t wanted, made him spiral over being a bad person when he was far from it. Perhaps it wasn’t right for him to hold back any longer, even if it meant losing Draco. Maybe that was okay.
“Do you understand how utterly and completely infuriating you are sometimes? Just...just why? Why won’t you talk to me normally? What did I do?” Harry felt his voice getting shrill, and heard the crazed desperation in it. He’d be cringing at himself if he wasn’t so upset right now.
Harry chewed on the question for some time. “I mean...I want to say yes. It’s easy to slip back into old habits but...I talked with her, and I’m pretty sure she talks more frequently with her head of house. From what I can tell, I think it’s a permanent behavioural change, you know?”
He could not, for the life of him, corner Malfoy. And frankly, he was at his wits end. He even had gone so far as to memorise Malfoy’s schedule, in order to pin the man down, but it was to no avail. Harry felt like if he did finally manage to capture Malfoy, he’d end up strangling him as a way to release his pent up frustration.
“But, er, you’re not really dressed for it? It’s been snowing all day…” Harry trailed off, eyeing Draco’s wardrobe.
It was probably Hagrid or McGonagall who had asked her, though why they wouldn’t want him to know was something Harry didn’t have an explanation for.
“Now, Miss Zinke, do you think you can try that for me?” He asked softly. She nodded furiously and turned to try it herself, looking somehow uncertain and yet more sure of herself than before. Harry quickly reset the books for her, and watched carefully.
It was almost like he was doing it on purpose. It had been a week of this, and he must have taken note by now. Whenever he thought about it, it made Harry’s stomach turn with guilt, but it just made it clear to Harry he had to get over his feelings, and he had to get over them fast. Besides, Draco hadn’t confronted him over it, so he must not have cared that much anyway. And as much as that thought did sting, it’s what Harry kept repeating to himself ad infinitum.
“I thought,” Draco said, punctuating each word with another kiss, “I was the only one who felt that way.” He paused, resting his forehead against Harry’s. His eyes were still bright with tears, but Harry found comfort in knowing that they were happy ones.
Ron sighed. “And before I go, I know Halloween is tomorrow. Remember that me and ‘Mione are here for you if you need anything, the whole day. You know that, right, Harry?”
“Hmm,” was all Hermione said. She gave Harry a look, and raised her eyebrow. “That’s interesting, Harry.”
“Well, regardless, it was still very sweet of you to bring it to me. And to join me. Halloween isn’t an easy day for me, and your presence definitely brightened it a bit,” he said sincerely.
“Oh, I couldn’t Professor. I know it’s your favourite,” she said. She gave him a tentative smile, to indicate she’d heard what he said.
“Er, well, yes. I mean. No?” Harry shrugged helplessly. “The thought just crosses my mind sometimes. It’d cross yours too, if you saw him,” he added defensively.
So maybe if it was the right person, Harry could entertain the thought of being with someone. It just had to happen that it was Draco Malfoy.
If Harry had thought that this new development would lead to a change in Malfoy’s behaviour toward him, he was sorely mistaken. Well, partially. Malfoy still didn’t acknowledge him outside the occasional nod here or there, and he still seemed to avoid him. But Harry had taken to sending him letters at night and the swift responses he received were usually short, sharp and biting, and always managed to poke fun at Harry in some way, but he found that he didn’t mind. It reminded him much more of the Malfoy Harry had known, than the one his tenure at Hogwarts had shown him. It was comfortable, and easy, and he poked back at Malfoy just as hard. He found himself collecting the letters, and keeping them in his bedside drawer. Sometimes, when he couldn’t sleep, he took to reading through them.
“The almost-Slytherin sense of self-preservation in me has won out,” grumbled Harry. “Look, I’ll get over it. I just need space from him. If I distance myself enough, I’ll get over my feelings, and then things can go back to normal.”
He called the last name out, and watched as the last student - a nervous and twitchy-looking girl, named Amara Zinke - was sorted into Slytherin. The poor thing looked like she was about to burst into tears at the announcement, and before she could he quickly shielded her from view with his body and knelt down in front of her, gently grabbing her by the shoulder. He wasn’t surprised by the reaction. In the years since the war and his time as a professor, at least one student sorted into Slytherin reacted this way to the news.
“Welcome to Hogwarts, kids. The start of term banquet will begin soon, but before that happens it’s time for you to get sorted into your houses. The sorting ceremony is important because while here at Hogwarts, your house is your family away from home - you have classes with your house, sleep in the house dorms, and will spend much of your free time in your house common rooms.”
Malfoy set his quill down and looked up at Harry, eyebrow raised. “Do you normally think such detailed thoughts about my personal behaviour, or are you just like this with everyone?”
Draco whipped his head around, eyes wide. “I...er...well when you put it that way it sounds...it sounds-”
“No, no, I’m not, Ron.” Harry took in a deep breath to prepare himself. “I’m in love with Draco Malfoy.” He held his breath, afraid of Ron’s response.
All right. So. Maybe Harry was lying to himself, and in fact all of these things and more plagued his mind. He told himself that this had nothing to do with the fact that it was Malfoy, and that if it were anyone else, he’d be having the same thoughts and concerns.
If her eyebrows could raise further, they probably would have. “You find yourself thinking of Draco as a parent often, then?”
The other man’s face flushed a pretty shade of pale pink, and he tried to bury his head in his pillow. Harry let out a bright laugh. Draco was oddly shy sometimes, and he found it endeared him even more to the man. “Come on, the sooner you get up, the sooner we can give Amara her gift and see her reaction. I know how anxious you’ve been about the whole thing.”
Harry watched as the students filed out of the Great Hall, first years following prefects, and felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see McGonagall, looking weary and for the first time in a while, like her age.
Harry doused the flames and stared at the embers of the fire for a bit, Ron’s words ringing in his head. The thought of telling Draco how he felt...it was far too much. He didn’t know how he’d go about it, where he’d tell him, what he’d even say to mitigate the risk. And he couldn’t lose Draco, he just genuinely refused to let him go. So there was no other option but to hide, and shove his feelings away, until they disappeared like they were never there in the first place.
He turned to look and saw that Draco was right. Snow had begun gently falling in the night sky. He turned back to Draco, whose head was still out the window. Snowflakes had made an icy crown in his hair, and some were caught in the wisps of his eyelashes. The tip of his pointy nose was red, flushed from the cold. The smile on his face, however, was pure and genuine and frankly put, one of the most beautiful things Harry had ever seen.
), and climbed into her office right after her. She motioned for him to take a seat in one of the tartan-covered chairs in front of her desk, which he dutifully did. From the portraits up above, Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled down at him, while Snape’s glared. Harry hated visiting her office, because it always made him feel like a misbehaving child instead of the grown adult he knew he was.
The blond drummed his fingers against the windowsill and looked away. “I...in France, things were okay. Good, great even. I was well-loved by my students and respected by my peers. But everything felt off-kilter. It didn’t matter if they thought that well of me, because I knew that I hadn’t done anything to deserve that praise. And Mother, well, she’d pretend like everything was the same. Like nothing had changed for us, when in reality...well, everything had. I couldn’t take it anymore. So I left.”
“All right, everyone,” Harry said, at the end of class. “I want ten inches on the history of the Knockback Jinx and its creation, usage, and technique. Due one week from now, at the start of class.” The students all let out a series of disgruntled groans and complaints. “Would you like me to make it fifteen inches? Because I can and I will if you keep it up.” That quietened them down considerably, and any residual complaints were whispered between the students as they filed out of the classroom, leaving just Harry and Amara.
He found himself wondering what they’d be doing now, if they were still alive. Would they have retired or still working? Would they be proud of him? Harry liked to think that they would, but he’d never know for certain. The chance to know had been taken away from him.
So in lieu of a serious reply, he went with: “Don’t you think it’s odd that we spent years hating each other and now we’re pouring out our deepest insecurities to one another?” Although, Harry realized belatedly, he may have just opened a new can of worms.
She took a forkful of shepherds pie into her mouth, and chewed thoughtfully. Amara swallowed, and then daintily patted her mouth with a napkin. “Well,” she said, and then paused.
She tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, and bit her lip uncertainly. “Um, well. They asked me not to say, so I really can’t. I’m sorry, Professor.”
Well. Perhaps Harry had been wrong in his earlier assumptions. He made his way over to the door, and opened it to a rather disheveled and frantic looking Draco. His hair was ruffled, like someone’s hands had been run through it multiple times, and his normally pristinely-pressed robes were ruffled and wrinkled, as though they’d been put on haphazardly. Even the laces of one of his boots were untied. He was wild-eyed as he pushed his way into Harry’s rooms.
The students shared nervous glances with one another, and some of them broke out into worried whispers. It reminded Harry of his first year - how nervous he’d been, how he thought there was some exam he’d have to take, and how scared he was he’d be made a fool of in front of all his peers. He felt for the kids. He did every year. Harry coughed to get their attention again, and the students quieted themselves.
Harry wasn’t stupid - he wasn’t going to deny the possibility that Malfoy was Flitwick’s replacement because, well, he was literally sitting in Flitwick’s old spot. The question was why McGonagall had chosen him. When had he even gotten a Charms mastery? The last Harry had seen, from before he had finally cancelled his subscription to the
Harry didn’t mean this in a negative way - all right, maybe he did, actually - but Malfoy was as slippery as an eel. If, prior to this, Harry had convinced himself Malfoy wasn’t purposefully avoiding him, he had been thoroughly disabused of that notion.
They lapsed into a silence that was not quite awkward and not quite comfortable. Malfoy continued scritching away at his parchment. Without much else to do, Harry found his gaze drawn toward the other man. Every now and then Malfoy would scrunch up his nose in distaste, and mutter something about the state of students' education at Hogwarts. Less frequently, a soft smile would slip onto his face as he read something that clearly pleased him. Harry noted how his fingers were ink stained - he even had a splotch of ink on the bridge of his nose. Harry felt a sudden urge to reach forward and wipe it clean. He shook his head to clear himself of that...odd thought. Instead, he laid his head down on the table and directed his gaze toward the fireplace, watching the flames flicker and dance. It was hypnotic, in a sense.
“Oh, Draco,” said Harry, resigned to his fate. “That’s not it at all. Couldn’t be further from the truth, in fact.”
Malfoy seemed to...jump a little, as though surprised that Harry was speaking to him. But he regained his composure quickly, and had a look about him that was oddly...serene, in a way that felt off. Like he was faking a level of calm that he did not have.
Harry felt like she owed him one too, but he’d come to realize in his ancient twenty-eight years of life that sometimes shutting his mouth was actually the best option after hearing what usually came out of it, so he shoved another biscuit into his mouth and chewed furiously.
It’s fine. That’s fine. It would be fine. He’d be fine. Everything was going to be fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
“That’s wonderful, Harry. I know you were fretting over her for a while, but it looks like things have smoothed out. Do you think she’ll keep it up then?”
Harry felt like this was a moment where he should get offended, but seeing as he wasn’t sure what Hermione was trying to imply, she might have a point. There was a tap at his windowsill, and he glanced over to see Draco’s owl, a snowy owl named Xue, at the window.
“Yes, well, that was only with your help, Professor. When it was just me I was doing miserably,” Amara trailed off, voice breaking into a wobble.
“It’s only my job to make sure you can accomplish this, you know,” he said, teasing her lightly. She let out a soft giggle, before nervously clapping a hand over her mouth. “I’ll leave you to it for the rest of class then, yeah?” Amara dutifully nodded and turned back to practice the jinx some more.
“Look,” he began. “You...may be right. I’ve not known Malfoy for a long time, and to be fair, I don’t think I’ve ever really known him to begin with.” He pulled at a loose thread on the arm of the chair he was sitting in. “And I know my past with him is...difficult, but I spoke for him at the trials. I gave him his wand back. If he’s a good teacher, he’s a good teacher, and I won’t let myself interfere with that.”
The lesson at hand was one Harry had been looking forward to teaching for a while - the ins and outs of the Knockback Jinx. Though, with Harry’s manner of teaching, it was more of a demonstration followed by the students practicing it themselves. Not on each other, of course, but on a stack of heavy textbooks he’d set up prior to the lesson start. Hermione would have a fit if she saw what he was letting his students do to those books, already bruised and battered with age. As he made his way around the room, stopping here and there to lend pointers and adjust stances, it made him smile to think of it.
“Amara,” said Harry firmly. “That is not true. Look at how well you did today in practical applications.”
, Malfoy was a quintessential socialite, and in France no less. The last he had heard from him personally was after having owled Malfoy his old wand again, having received a brief thank you note in return.
, but if not that, you really ought to start reading some form of wizarding news so that these things don’t take you by surprise. Though you sped through yours, Draco completed his Charms mastery four years ago, and has been teaching ever since. He’s not the ‘party-boy’ you seem to think he is, and he hasn’t been for quite some time.”
She looked down at her feet, ashamed. “I’m just...I’m just not very good at this class, Professor. I wasn’t cut out for this sort of thing, is all.”
Harry awoke on Halloween, the day of his parent’s death, with a restless itch under his skin. This was par for the course. If it were any other day, he’d get rid of the restlessness by going for a run, or flying on the quidditch pitch if it were empty. But it was, of course, Halloween, and so he couldn’t.
Harry shrank back down into his chair, and chose to stare at the portraits hanging up above her head instead of at the stern visage of the woman currently scolding him. Snape was smirking at him, likely pleased he’d made a fool of himself. Dumbledore was smiling gently at him, in that knowing way of a teacher outwaiting a student too scared to admit having done something wrong. Not that Harry would admit to being any of these things, of course.
“Wait, Miss Zinke, come back here,” Harry called out. She paused in her tracks and slunk back shyly to the doorway. “I can’t eat all this by myself. Care to join me?” He smiled at her.
“Yes. Well, no.” She shook her head and her curls bounced. “If you think there’s something missing from your relationship with him, there probably is. But you know yourself better than I do - you’re the only one that has the answers to those questions, really. Even if I have my own suspicions.”
“Just. Think about it, Harry,” urged Ron. “You don’t even need to give me an answer. I just want you to think about it.”
“It’s just...why not talk to me during the day? It’s like he’s two different people entirely. I don’t understand it, Ron,” Harry complained.
Malfoy’s hands paused in the patterns they were drawing on the table, and his gaze snapped up to meet Harry’s. “Why...Harry, why are you telling me this?”
Harry swallowed down the remains of the second biscuit and wiped the crumbs from his hands on the front of his pants. McGonagall, for her part, did not look very impressed. “Look, I just want to know one thing and I’ll leave it: why him?”
In an instance like this, normally Harry would refrain from rolling his eyes. But it was Malfoy, so of course, he didn’t.
Harry scratched at the nape of his neck sheepishly. “Er, well, to tell the truth, I spilled pumpkin juice over most of my food. So I didn’t get to taste much of it.”
There was a loud banging on his door that startled him out of his thoughts. He jumped in his chair, and nearly knocked his cup of tea over. The banging stopped as abruptly as it had started.
If he entered the staffroom while Malfoy was there, the man would promptly end whatever he was doing and leave. Even if it meant leaving a confused fellow professor halfway through a conversation.
the point, actually,” Ron responded. “Look, Harry. The man owes you a life debt - two, if you include him speaking for you at the trials. And now he’s your colleague? Any normal bloke would feel awkward about the whole thing, but this is Malfoy we’re talking about. His pride probably can’t take it.”
He was sad, and he was lonely, and he was angry, and he was uncomfortable and he was tired and he just wanted his brain to shut up. Harry sighed and stared at the ceiling, perhaps not in despair, but something close to it.
Amara fiddled anxiously with the sleeves of her robes and shifted a bit on her feet. “Oh, I don’t know Professor...I wouldn’t want to bother you tonight.”
He settled down to eat his own food, but found his gaze helplessly drawn to Malfoy again and again. The way the man ate was very different from Harry. Where Harry ate as much as he could, as quick as he could - old traumas never die easily, after all - Malfoy was the picture of propriety. He cut into the food delicately, and took small, precise bites. Each forkful was laden with an equivalent amount of all that was on his plate - nothing threatened to overwhelm the other. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen someone eat in such a...posh way, before.
“Whoa there, mate. You all right?” Ron asked, concerned at what must have been Harry’s increasingly panicked expression.
Stormy gray eyes pierced his own, giving Harry an unfathomable look, distracting Harry, so it took him a few seconds to process the question. “Yeah,” he said. “The hat almost Sorted me there. It would have Sorted me there if I hadn’t refused.”
Harry entered the Great Hall on the morning of December 1st to find Draco conspicuously absent. He frowned as he ate his breakfast, wondering if Draco would show up for any of his classes. Draco was missing during lunch, too. And during his afternoon classes, Harry found out through one of his students that Draco had been missing from his classes, too. When dinner arrived and Draco still had not shown up, Harry decided to ignore the note he’d received from Draco and go searching for him.
“No, I got it from the kitchens, actually. I wasn’t really planning on attending the feast anyway,” she responded.
“He is,” replied Harry. “I never thought I’d say this but...I’m glad McGonagall took him up on his offer, you know? He’s really good with kids. Like, really good, ‘Mione. I don’t know how he does it.” His mind flashed back to that night with Amara and Draco, and how gently he had spoken to her, like she’d shatter into pieces if he breathed wrong. It stirred something inside him, made him wonder if Draco would be like this with his future kids. “He’d probably make a great father.”
“I just...miss them so much, Professor,” Amara whimpered. “I’m homesick, but I can’t write to them, because ever since being placed into Slytherin they’ve been so mad at me. I just want my parents to be proud of me.”
“Hush, darling, it’s okay,” said Malfoy, wiping the tears from her eyes. “Let it all out if you need to. That’s what I’m here for. You.”
“I’m fine,” said Harry, from his seat on the floor. “That was an answer to both your questions, by the way.”
“Well, you’re not wrong. I used to. But I find that now I get most of my work done at night,” Malfoy answered, with a surprising amount of honesty.
There was a pause and then Draco ran up to Harry and yanked on his cloak, pulling him into a ferocious kiss. His lips were cold as ice but Harry’s body felt as if it were on fire. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and pulled him closer, such that their chests were flush against one another. They pulled apart for air and then Draco dove back in, busying himself by peppering Harry’s forehead, nose, cheeks, and jaw with kisses. Each spot Draco kissed felt alive with searing heat.
He finished the job as the sun began to dip in the sky, bathing his rooms in the glow of twilight. Harry stood in the middle of the room and surveyed his work. Everything was spotless, the buzzing in his ears had gone down, and he was exhausted enough from the work that he felt he could fall asleep standing up. So all in all, cleaning had done for him what he wanted it to do. He knew that the buzzing would probably rear its head again, and he knew the inevitability of having nightmares tonight existed, but for now he felt somewhat at peace.
“Except you kind of do,” said Draco, echoing Harry. “You seem to think your sole function is to exist as an object to serve others before yourself, and you seem to forget that it’s okay for you to be human. Merlin knows if anyone’s earned that right, it’s you.”
Harry felt his skin begin to prickle, discomfited by the whole situation. Hogwarts was his home, where he was always on sure footing - but with Malfoy here now, the ground had shifted underneath him and rearranged into new, unfamiliar territory.
Sitting in Flitwick’s seat was Draco Malfoy. Sitting tall, and looking a lot more confident and angular than the last time Harry had seen him (at the trials), but it was Malfoy, all right.
“Harry,” said Draco, looking like he was in pain at having to say this, “you are...oddly intelligent sometimes, and perhaps too kind to boot.”
By all accounts, it was as though Malfoy was scared of Harry. Which couldn’t be the case, because they were both grown adults, and Malfoy wouldn’t have accepted a job here, or come to McGonagall asking for one rather, if he really were scared of Harry.
And when Harry walked into the Great Hall the next morning, Malfoy was seated in Flitwick’s old chair.
“I won’t push you to. But I want you to know that I’m here if you need an ear. I know you can do better, Amara, and I think you know you can too. Now go on, wouldn’t want you to be late to your next class.”
So Harry could deal with Malfoy avoiding him. And besides, it wasn’t like Harry wasn’t busy himself. He had students to teach, and a house to look after, and he’d learn to deal with the uncomfortable itch building under his skin at Malfoy’s avoidance of him in time.
“Uh, well,” said Amara, looking somewhat sheepish. “I have to admit that it wasn’t my idea to bring you food. I ran into Prof-someone in the kitchens who told me you weren’t feeling well and asked if I’d bring you some food, and they knew all your favourites.”
Harry felt like he was hit with whiplash. “How do you know that Amara brought me food?” he asked, eyes narrowed.
“Thank you, Professor,” she said. Her tone belied a quiet sort of pride in herself. It was moments like this that were really demonstrative of why Harry had chosen to teach. It filled Harry himself with his own sense of pride.
“I can’t talk about it with you,” she said. Amara wiped at her nose, which was now red and threatening to run, with the sleeve of her robe.
After a time, even the sound of quill against parchment stopped. Harry looked back at Malfoy, who was staring at him with an unfathomable expression on his face. “What is it?”
? Because all of that’s true, but saying it aloud doesn’t change anything.” He let it all out in a rush, feeling winded.
He perked up at the chance to talk about who was now, admittedly, his favorite student. “Yes, actually. She’s been turning in her work on time, and participating more frequently in class. She also seems to be struggling with the theory less and less, too. I have my own suspicions someone is tutoring her, but that’s not a bad thing. I’m quite happy for it, really.”
As married couples are wont to do sometimes, both Hermione and Ron narrowed their eyes at Harry simultaneously.
“Yeah, I do. But I’ll be fine, Ron.” Harry was lying, of course. The look on Ron’s face indicated that he knew Harry was too.
He excused himself and told McGonagall he was feeling particularly ill today. By the look on her face, she knew he was lying, but to her credit said nothing. He returned to his rooms and threw himself atop his bed. With no idea how to get rid of the buzzing in his ears, or the itch underneath his skin, he tried to force himself into a restless sleep.
Harry felt himself flushing and he started to sputter. “Er, no, yes, well, I mean you’re like Hermione, you know?”
“Then just...think about why that is. What makes him different from Ron and I? That’s what you need to ask yourself.”
It turned out that Harry didn’t have to try hard to leave Malfoy be, as Malfoy seemed to have made it his personal mission to make himself scarce whenever Harry was present. Upon entering the Great Hall on the first day of term, Harry found that Malfoy had switched seats with Hagrid. That alone wouldn’t have bothered Harry, though after a few days it dawned on him that it was a permanent switch.
Harry took a moment to digest this information. What he’d expected was something insulting, and snide, that beat around the bush and didn’t really answer his questions. Instead he had got something raw and incredibly vulnerable and unexpected. He was at the edge of a precipice and what he said next would either toss Malfoy into a black abyss from which there was no return, or pull him away into the arms of someone safe.
If he ran into Malfoy in the halls, he would try to exchange pleasantries with the man, only to receive a brush off and some poor excuse for why Malfoy had to run off, before the man would promptly scuttle away in the opposite direction.
The look that Harry received from McGonagall was one of deep disapproval. Maybe he should have taken a third biscuit. “You know, Harry, I know how much you hate the
Malfoy sat there, in the hallway, illuminated by the moonlight and watched Amara leave. Harry stood there, behind a pillar, hidden in the dark, and watched Malfoy. He sat there quietly and after a moment’s pause, turned to let his face bathe in the moonlight, eyes closed. It looked almost as if he were glowing, to Harry. Harry, for his part, stood rooted to the spot, somewhat entranced.
“I’m starting to think that you...might have a point, Professor. Prof-someone else told me something similar.”
Amara blushed and ducked her head shyly. “Y-you’re welcome, Professor.” She glanced at the clock, and then nearly tumbled out of her seat. “Oh, shoot. I told my friends I’d meet them in the library and I’m incredibly late. Sorry, Professor, but I have to go. Is that okay?”
Despite having been a Professor for a good few years at this point, the start of a new term always filled Harry with the same sense of anticipation it had as when he had first come to Hogwarts. The sense of excitement amongst the new students was electric and palpable, and always transferred to him. He shifted on his feet and crossed his arms, leaning back against the wall of the entrance hall where the first years were to arrive, led by Hagrid as per usual.
After what seemed like an eternity of silence, Malfoy, eyes still closed, opened his mouth to speak. “You can come out now, Potter.”
He came to a stop in front of the staffroom. The door was slightly ajar, and light spilled out of the cracks, alerting Harry to someone else’s presence. It looked like he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t sleep tonight. He peeked his head in and saw Malfoy seated at the table near the fireplace, scratching away at some parchment with a quill. His internal debate on whether or not to enter the room was interrupted by Malfoy himself.
His newfound friendship with Draco seemed to have satisfied a yearning ache deep within Harry’s bones, one that he hadn’t realized he’d had in the first place. A sort of loneliness he’d never examined before, that perhaps his subconscious had buried for him, and now it was fading. But there was still something within him that hungered for more from Draco, but what it was, exactly, wasn’t something that he could put a finger on.
Instead of answering, Malfoy simply pursed his lips and turned back to the book he was reading. That just irritated Harry more. He wanted to break something, to start a fight, to scream. But he couldn’t. He felt his ears begin to buzz.
Harry did not take the whole tin, but he did shove a good few in his trouser pockets before leaving her office.
She took off her glasses and took out a tartan patterned handkerchief - one that matched the seats he was sitting in - and cleaned the lenses of her glasses. “You should know that he came to me, actually. But he came with an impeccable recommendation from the person he received his Charms mastery from, and he has experience teaching at Beauxbatons.”
For the first time since he’d known her, she gave him a bright smile, looking less like a wilted plant and more like a blooming flower for once. It made his heart feel warm at the sight of it. She nodded again, and then hurried off. As she left, any residual energy Harry had in his body sapped itself from him. He could bring the tray back to the kitchens now, or he could toss himself into a bed that looked incredibly, incredibly inviting. The only danger lay in the fact that he knew sleep tonight would only bring nightmares, but he was so tired. There was the option of forcing himself to stay awake through the night, which he did for some years, but in this instance it felt like it would be a losing battle.
Why or what he needed to prepare himself for was not something that he had an answer for. But the annoyance bubbling up inside him at McGonagall felt well-founded, nonetheless.
“Follow me to my office, would you, Harry?” she sighed. She turned on foot and started walking at a rather quick, no-nonsense pace, and Harry scrambled out of his seat to catch up. He followed her through the halls and to the Gargoyle in front of her office, watching as she gave the password (
Once the little ones lined themselves up in front of him as neat and proper as any children were able to, Harry ran his fingers through the curls of his hair and prepared himself to speak. He gave Hagrid a quick nod of acknowledgement, and received a hearty smile in return. Channelling his memories of McGonagall’s speech from his first year, he offered what he hoped was an encouraging smile, and began to speak.
“I have not been anxious,” Draco said, voice muffled from the pillow. “I just wanted to ensure everything was perfect. When she told me her parents told her not to come home for the holidays, I had half a mind to just adopt her right then and there. Honestly, what kind of people are they?”
She nodded and all but ran out of the room. Harry sighed as he watched her go. He needed to talk with the other professors to see if they were having similar issues with her, but most of all, he needed to speak with Malfoy, her head of house.
Like a turtle tentatively poking its head out of its shell, she carefully made her way into the room and over to his desk, where she took a seat.
Harry sighed and pulled on a winter cloak, scarf, gloves, and some heavier boots. It looked like there was no worming his way out of this interaction. He slunk out of his rooms, Draco following shortly behind. They walked in silence for a time as they made their way onto the grounds. Near the lake that had by now frozen over, Draco stopped and reached out, grabbing one of Harry’s arms to get his attention.
Harry sighed, and pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. “Yes, Miss Zinke. All the homework you’ve been turning has been half-complete at best, non-existent at worst. I’m worried about you - what’s been going on? Are you all right?”
“Er, actually, I was just about to go for a walk around the grounds,” said Harry. He was lying of course, but it was the only excuse he could think of to get rid of Draco.
As October slid into November, as the air turned crisper and the beginnings of a winter chill began to settle over the school grounds, and as the leaves fell from the trees, Harry found that the seeds of friendship he hand planted with Draco finally began to blossom and flower.
“Hi, Professor! Um, for you,” she said, pushing the tray toward Harry. He swooped down and grabbed it from her before she fell over from the weight of it all. “Well, um, have a good dinner. Bye then.” Amara turned on her heel and made to scurry away.
“Well, Amara, when I was younger. I did some very bad things. I actively chose to do those things. And I chose to do them, every day, for a long, long time.”
Harry sighed and placed his fork down on his plate. “Amara, it’s okay. I don’t blame you. It’s hard, when family is unkind to you. Even though I wish you’d told me sooner, I’m glad that you trusted me enough to tell me at all.”
Harry looked up at Ron’s face in the fireplace, unamused. “We’ve known each other for seventeen years, Ron.”
Looking over at him, Draco let out a sigh and sort of...awkwardly shuffled over to Harry, and wrapped him in his cloak. Harry eyed him, and watched as his face began to flush red. “Not a word, Harry,” he grit out.
“I’m a wizard, I’ll use a warming charm. It’ll be fine,” Draco sniffed. “Come on then, haven’t got all night, have we?”
Her movements weren’t as smooth and practiced as Harry’s, but he didn’t expect them to be. The books didn’t fly back with the same force as they had when Harry had shot the jinx, but they still fell over. He clapped Amara on her back enthusiastically. “See? I knew you could do it, Amara.”
Harry fell flat on his back and stared up at the ceiling. “What do you want me to say, Draco? That there’s a restlessness in my bones and a buzzing in my ears and an itch under my skin that’s been here the whole week and won’t go away? That despite everything I do, I can’t stop thinking about what was taken from me? That I can’t stop resenting that I never got to have a choice in any of it, that I was signed up for something I never wanted before I was even born, that it feels like all I’m made for is to give, and give, and give and that there’s a selfish part of me that wishes I could just…
Maybe he should put his nervous energy to use and clean his apartments. Rolling off the bed with a thump, he picked himself up off the floor and examined his surroundings. Books were stacked not on shelves but in jumbled messes upon various pieces of furniture. His desk was a mess of student’s homework and lesson plans. Harriet’s cage by the window was sort of disgusting to look at. The collection of pictures he had by his bedside and on the fireplace mantle were collecting dust. It was admittedly filthy, and nothing really burned out his energy the way a good deep cleaning could. So, he rolled up his sleeves and got to work.
But then he’d see Draco interact with one of their students, and his mind would flash to what it would be like to parent with him. He’d do his work in the company of Draco and he’d get it done faster just by having someone there with him. He’d feel that angry itch under his skin but then Draco would take him on a walk around the lake and chatter endlessly about the way students had irritated him that day, and the itching would subside, and Harry’s sleep would be more peaceful.
“You absolute fucking wanker,” Harry shot back. “You can’t just sit there and ignore and avoid me for months, choose only to speak to me through letters or when I’m lucky enough to catch you off guard at night, and then pull shit like...like this!”
“They’re terrible, but she’s got us now.” He planted a kiss on Draco’s head. “Besides, if it’s from you, she’ll think it’s perfect. I know I would.”
He said all this and more to Hermione one late November evening, hoping that perhaps she’d know what was going on. Because, well, it was Hermione. She watched him with a calculated stare through the fireplace, but stayed silent.
“Er, well, you know I would for you ‘Mione, but. I’m not so sure that’ll be happening anytime soon.”
All it boiled down to was Harry realizing he was a right shit of a person. Malfoy really hadn’t done anything wrong, but already Harry was treating him with suspicion. He wondered if many other people treated Malfoy that way, such that his response was to become restrained and withdrawn. He wondered how many people treated Malfoy even worse. Harry found that he didn’t like the answers his mind came up with.
“I told her what I tell every Slytherin who gets upset about their placement: that Merlin was one, that Snape was one, and that I almost was one, too.”
Harry felt his face flush with a sudden warmth that blossomed from within him. It was odd, but he’d never really...told anyone those thoughts before. Not even Ron or Hermione. And being validated in a way he hadn’t expected to be was disconcerting. Usually he felt sure-footed but now it was like he’d been thrust into something new and unfamiliar, though he couldn’t say it was an unwelcome feeling.
The other man turned pink and began to sputter something that Harry wasn’t in the mood to listen to, so he unwrapped one of the sandwiches he had brought from the kitchen and shoved it in Draco’s mouth. “For you. I assume you’ve spent the whole day moping up here and haven’t eaten dinner, yeah?”
Ultimately, he gave in, climbing into bed and letting the waves of what he knew would be a restless sleep wash over him and pull him under.
He knew she was talking about Malfoy, but thought it best to leave that knowledge a secret. “Glad to hear you’ve been talking to someone else about this, Amara,” he said, meaningfully. “Can I ask you a question, though?”
“How do you know that?” He asked, confused and wondering for a brief moment if he’d ever accidentally waxed lyrically about the wonders of treacle tart during class.
Much to his surprise, he did not have to wait long. Harriet returned, with a new letter attached to her foot. He fed her a treat and untied the letter. It read:
However, this time he was prepared. “Miss Zinke, if I could have a word with you at the end of class, please?” The poor thing looked frightened as a mouse, but she nodded her assent. He smiled at her gently, trying to reassure her, but if anything she grew to look more scared. Harry stopped to wonder for a moment if he was really that intimidating of a teacher, but surely he’d have been told by one of the other professors if he were, wouldn’t he? Perhaps he’d ask around, just to check.
“Harry, how many people besides us, save for Dumbledore, knew you were almost a Slytherin?” she asked.
“Well, I knew someone was watching me, and it felt eerily familiar to when you were obsessed with me back in sixth year, if you must know. Not going to curse me again, are you?” Malfoy still hadn’t opened his eyes, but a smile played at the corner of his lips.
But, every time he had the urge to go and poke and prod at Malfoy, he refrained. He repeated Ron’s mantra of “Let it be” over and over in his head, ad infinitum. He would not bother Malfoy, and Malfoy would not bother him. They could co-exist peacefully, and that’s what they were doing. Even if it left a trail of confused professors in its wake, they were managing.
“Miss Zinke, if you’ll pause for a moment?” Amara jumped at the sound of Harry’s voice and dropped her wand, where it rolled over to a stop in front of Harry’s feet. He picked up the wand and walked it back over to her, placing it into her hands. “Think of the wand as an extension of your own arm - you’re treating it like it’s a separate entity from yourself. That’s why the jinx isn’t working for you. Watch the way my arm moves carefully, now:
Harry clutched his chest in mock-offence, and toppled over onto the floor. “My heart has never known such pain.”
He was met with silence. Harry turned his head to glance at Draco, and the other man was staring at him, mouth agape. He winced internally, preparing for the worst but was met with a very quiet: “Say that again.”
Now it was Hermione’s turn to roll her eyes. She let out a huff of annoyance. “Honestly, you two really ought to keep up with the
He clucked his tongue. “I’m serious, Amara. I would love the pleasure of your company, even if you don’t want to eat.”
“It’s not about having faith in him or myself, it’s about not destroying the very fragile relationship that I’ve been nurturing into existence,” argued Harry. Ron was missing the point, entirely. He didn’t understand the deep-seated fear Harry felt in his bones, he couldn’t understand the stakes at play right now.
Before his mind could wander too far in its daydreams, three knocks were heard on castle doors. Harry swung them open and Hagrid came bustling in with a load of nervous first years following behind, like little ducklings after their mother. Harry straightened his posture and stood tall, trying to resemble the picture of a responsible and serious Professor, though he knew he was probably failing.
He forced himself to grab the scroll from McGonagall - very nearly dropping it - and made his way back to the stool. The hat had finished singing its song, and it was time for Harry to begin the sorting. He dutifully read the names out one by one, but found that his mind kept wandering back to the man sitting behind him.
It was in that manner that before the blink of an eye, a whole month had passed, and the school was heading into October. The leaves of the trees had turned from various shades of green to burnt orange, red, and yellow and littered the grounds of the school. The crisp air bit the noses of those who lingered outside, and students and professors alike switched out their clothes for heavier weight fabrics. It wasn’t Harry’s favourite time of year, as Halloween was up and coming, and with it brought more restlessness and night time wanderings. But he had to admit that Hogwarts was a beautiful place during autumn.
“What in the bloody hell is wrong with you, Malfoy?” Harry asked, a sort of quiet fury laced into the tone of his voice.
“Shouldn’t you know by now that I’m not the type to listen to that if I think it’s stupid?” retorted Harry.
Harry took off his glasses and began to wipe them clean. “So,” he said tentatively, “does this mean you’re going to start talking to me during the day now, or do I still have to resort to communicating to you through letters where you insult me for no reason?”
“Well that’s a shame, isn’t it? Waste of good food if you ask me,” said Ron, looking the picture of disappointment.
Draco looked away and worried his lip, and then looked back at Harry. There was less wild-eyed anger in his eyes and more...fear and sadness. “What did I do?” he asked, and oh, was his tone so fragile. Harry thought that if he wanted, he could reach out and snap him in half in this moment.
At that, Ron let out a snort. “Malfoy the reason why you dumped pumpkin juice all over your plate then, eh? I’ll bet it is.”
