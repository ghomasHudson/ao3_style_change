------------------------------------------------
"Oh. It's not only Potter's concern. Actually." He pauses as he dramatically drops the next words. "It is, after all, you - Gryffindors' business," Malfoy smirked in the most confident and eerie way as he fans gently the notebook near his face.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yes, indeed. Albus." Snape sneered at the headmaster. He turned towards the door while he slowly pulled Malfoy to leave. As they did so, Professor McGonagall turns to us. "Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, and Ms. Granger will you be needing me in this discussion?"
"Lucian died at around 13 years of age" Mrs. Weasley uttered, solemnly.
"Herms, I have been meaning to ask," I said. "Where are we?"
Weak and tired, I laid down on the soft grass. Panting from exhaustion, I felt that I have released all the pain, fear, and anger into the wind. It felt good.
"I think it was his way of thanking us for not revealing the things that had to happen in Headmaster Dumbeldore's office." She answered. "He just didn't want to say it at us so he uses action. You know man's pride. And all about that Pureblood's superiority."
Just peace.
"How about you, Harry?" He asked as he struts towards us.
How single-minded am I!
Chapter 19: Overwhelmed and Captivated
"I mean I'm having an affair here with Draco, a man," I answered in a more stupid way that I almost wanted to hit myself into the wall for my stupidity.
"Let me think about it." He answered.
"Are sure you can tell me all of these things, Malfoy?" I asked seriously.
' If there will ever be a cure,' I thought to myself.
"Harry," Oliver called out. "You shouldn't bother them. We still have a match to take care of."
As she runs in fright and crying for me to stop. My best friend at my mercy.
"Okay," I muttered as I kneel beside him and bend my waist to bite on the open flesh of the animal. It was disturbing but for the sake of our safety and my sanity, I have to do this. As I suck on the animal's blood, I felt little satisfaction as I try to savor the taste of blood but to my dismay, it has no great effect on me. I raised my head to Draco as my bite my lower lips and I felt inside corners of my eyebrows slanting upward.
"Yes. She just keeps on visiting and urging me to eat." I continue.
"Yes," I answered as I refocus my mind on Hermione, away from the negative thoughts that have entered my head.
"Ah. You meant this beauty?" Malfoy smiled for the first time. A true smile. It was beautiful on him. "She is the queen."
Again raising one of his eyebrows, Malfoy putting his spoon down and taking a napkin to dab his clean lips. Those pinkish lips. Gulping loudly as I caught myself gawking at Malfoy's lips.
A scent of a familiar person's blood spread throughout the area before I heard Hermione's frantic shout.
"Here I am, Harry." She spoke in her most sensual voice. "Did you like the dream?"
It was still controllable but I was getting irritated more often since I could not understand why.
"GETTING SICK ARE WE, POTTER?" Exclaimed a crude voice.
My lips form into a smirk, I felt an inflate in my ego and it definitely feels good. Michael who was facing Ginny at that time saw the change in my expression and he realized that I have found out his secret. His face turned red from anger and his eyes promise murder as if he have forgotten Ginny or anyone in the Great hall - he charged at me.
The real panic mode here!
"That's good!" Hermione said in a cheerful tone. "That meant that I am on the right track."
Cursing, I am truly unfortunate as if all the gods and goddesses had been playing with my life. In all the time for my hunger strike to come back in a form of full-blown pain is this TIME... Really when will fate give me a break!!!
It made me forgot the intense hunger that I felt instead it was replaced by the aching hollow inside my chest. Then someone out of nowhere came to a voice shouting with accusation. "MONSTER! ITS A MONSTER!"
"Harry..." She muttered, lost on what she can say to comfort me.
05. Alice's Domain
After being lost in thoughts as I gazed over the professors, I glanced up the ceiling. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside that is now stormy. The clouds swarmed and block any light from the sky, with its darkness.
"Yes," I answered again. Sadness dwelling inside of me. Silence then ruled over us as we tried to nurse the growing pain inside of us. Only the birds that tweets as they passed us by and the rustling of the leaves on the trees as it sways from the gentle breeze were heard.
My heart is hammering inside my ribcage. I could hear my heavy breathing and the sweat had soaked me, was enough to fill a bottle. But I could still feel her presence as she runs the chilling knife around my neck, digging deeper as it slides over my skin - even though the nightmare already ended. I shivered as I remember the way she took the knife and show it to me then she made me hold it with both of my hands, guiding me to slice a piece of flesh from the chunk of meat in front me. Oddly, the upper part was cover with a cloth. And as the flesh was cut off, my demon took the fallen piece and slowly made me open my mouth, to shove the meat inside.
Just following the instinct that I have long suppressed within me.
This is frustrating!!!
"That's enough" Mr. Weasley pouted. "I'm getting jealous over here"
'What do you mean dead, asshole?" I screamed in my mind. 'I am very much alive if only I could get up. I'm gonna kill you.'
-----------------------------------------------
"What?" I utter in confusion. "Rob of what?"
'Hmmm...He knows about it but he won't tell you.' The demon whispered in my head. 'What could it be? That he couldn't tell you, his best friend's son.'
"I see." He said, laced with disappointment.
As we made past the barrier, the sight of the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine with ashes and smoke coming out from the pipe greeted us. Around it was a mob of Hogwarts students with their parents along with trollies and caged pets. We bid goodbye as we went inside to find our sits. We separated from George and Fred as they went with Jordan, their friend. Ginny also when to her group of friends that were in the same year as her. That left the three of us. Upon reaching an empty compartment, we settled down our luggage and trollies.
With the question at the tip of my tongue, I silently pass over my plate towards him. He reaches out and places it on his side. “Tiffany, can you get the cooked bacon over the sink?”
"Stop doubting me. Let's say. Some of the pureblood families have creature blood - like the Bulstrodes are said to have giant's blood that can be seen with their physical attributes or the Zabinis are rumored to have sirens' blood that is associated with their allure. So, I know things, Granger." He stated nonchalantly.
To keep my mind from thinking, away from the worries and the fear, I took the liberty of taking a long bath and changing my clothes. I need to do something, to save me from becoming insane with my current situation. A morning run can't be that all bad.
A grimace found its way to my face as I thought of what is happening to my body.
'Hmm... Your down-fall? I'm not sure. but for now, I am going to enjoy You, Harry.' She giggled and her voice faded in the back of my mind.
I lose my best-mate, Ron.
"I have other theories that I want to try, Harry. Is that alright with you?" She asked me.
"Harry, wake up," He said in a soothing and enthralling manner.
From the previous chapter:
"I really want to tell you about our experiment when you are done with your food." Hermione sighed heavily. "Draco, you should have waited."
"Mr. Weasley, please do pick the cup of Mr. Potter and tell us what do you see?" she said in a faked high misty voice.
Ron peeks from his assignment to Hermione's books and made a face. "This is a bit?"
A hearty laugh came out of Mr. Weasley as he also took Sirius' hand and shook it. "Sirius, I told you to call me Arthur and it is also good to see you."
A bird screeched, cutting the silence. No one relaxed until the bird flew past by. After a few minutes of wandering in the forest had turned into hours. I smell a scent tantalizing this time. Excited, I signaled at Hermione and Draco to get ready, my whole body vibrating. Like it was getting ready to hunt, different in the way I respond to the great moose that Draco killed. I heard the rustling of the bushes and creaks of the branches that broke from being step on. A faint shadow emerged from the darkness and advanced down the thick trees.
But I can not blame her, she must have kept it for a long time from me and just burst out from her when her emotions were high.
I still find Professor Dumbledore's office the most unique one that I have ever seen. As I glanced around, I can see it was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noise. Weird silver instruments stood on the spindle-legged table, as they emit all kinds of sounds, whirring and forming little puffs of white and black smoke. The wall was almost covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, that were either watching us curiously or snoring quietly in some wonderland. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and sitting on the shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard's hat - the Sorting Hat.
Sighing, I smiled at her. "It helps, Hermione." Relief flash within my chest which was full of anxiety, pain, and tiredness. "You do help a lot, Hermione. Thank you."
It was embarrassing enough that we bring him so much trouble but it was a relief, that we have a place to stay. But even, all the guilt that I have that doesn't stop me from the feeling of 'not wanting' Draco to leave.
I smiled at her then decide to make her twirl. Gasping, she manages to catch up with what I was trying to do. Jokingly and awkwardly, trying to dance with her like the rhythm of the song speed up. Taking turns to make each other twirl into the music, jumping and bouncing like a couple of children. Laughing once awhile as we trip with our careless steps. And as the song slowly comes to an end, we end-up embracing each other; knowingly trying to comfort one another.
The reality was harsh as the hunger pains again awaken me. Inside me, something is ripping me - breaking my whole being and replacing it with someone new. It felt like my whole body is being sawed into half as the twisting and flipping motion in my guts tells me to eat.
"Hmm..." Ron took my teacup and stared at it. With his blue eyes, he observes the shape formed by the tea leaves trying to make up something of it.
Mr. Weasley dash towards their room and after a moment, he went out fully clothed; wizardry office attire and was combing his hair. "Molly and kids, I'll be going now. Molly, are going to be alright taking the kids to the King's Cross?"
She grinned at me,  as she knows why I still irritated at her. Dressed in her light brown hunting gear: long sleeves shirt with black leather armor patches on her vital areas and tight leather pants with a dragon -scaled boots, courtesy of Draco, she was sitting down in one of the cushioned-sofa as she was waiting for me beside was Draco with his black turtle-neck long sleeves shirt emphasizing his pale skin, skin-tight cargo pants - leaving no need for imagination what was beneath them, and a  half-metal chest plate covering only his left pectoral as the leather straps tied and wrapped his upper torso enhancing his muscles.
The other professors were already settled and were all chatting with each other. Hagrid, who landed the job as the professor of care of magical creatures, was talking animatedly about something to Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher and the Head of Ravenclaw house, that Hagrid's movements made Professor Flitwick bounce in his chair just from the force of it. A funny sight if I am honest to be.
Then out of nowhere, Malfoy laughs. His laughter was like bells - chiming like music. Like ripples in a still pond after a stone had been thrown in. It radiated outward through the forest. I could see his stomach shaking as he fights a new gale of laughter. He was slapping both of his hands up and down almost involuntarily and could barely breathe from laughing. Fat tears would roll down his cheeks and it seems it would take a long time for him to subside his laughter.
"Goddamn it!!!" I shouted at Hermione. "Hermione run!"
Mr. Weasley came rushing in and grab the two -mirror from Mrs. Weasley. In a hushed voice, he talked to the person on the other of the mirror. "Yes, what happens?"
Wait! Then where did my demon came from?
"But?" She asked as she looks up to me.
I was flabbergasted by the fabricated lies that were written all-over the newspaper that when reached the port of Corner's interview, I have almost torn the newspaper into pieces.
"Harry Potter catches the snitch!!!" Lee Jordon announced in excitement. "150 points to Gryffindor!"
I stared at her.
Then the door opened.
"Female demon?"
"Hmm..." Draco hummed then he raised both of his hands as he cupped my face and his thumbs caress my cheeks in a lovingly way then he slowly leans closer making my already cold and tired body, ignite in flame, his lips lightly touched mine then he raised his head away from me. "Not at all."
"That's-" Hermione stood up, shocked.
"Really? I think I was lenient enough," Draco said casually.
I feel hot as I stutter: "Y-yes, just tired."
I almost smiled with his casual greeting when it's dripping with sarcasm. Instead of feeling irritated just like I usually feel, what I felt surprised me - I felt happy just to see him. Like I have become one of his butterflies, wanting to swarm around him.
'Dang' I thought, it didn't work. 'It's a good thing Sirius and Remus wasn't here'
"Yes it is. I saw them hiding there on the back of the audience sit as they were watching you all." He said.
"He is super pissed off" Hermione whispered. "It's scary."

Hermione raised one of her eyebrows and send Ron a nasty look then she turns to me. "So Harry... about this morning?..." She halted waiting for me if I would like to open up regarding this morning's incident.
Snickering, Malfoy raised the said small notebook above his head as his stance changed. His manners seem to remind me of that arrogant brat that I am used to seeing. "I like to see you try."
End of the previous chapter.
“Harry!” Hermione gasped in surprise as she ogled at me with her wide eyes open. “You look good in that outfit.”
Can I trust him?
"I guess" I agreed. "How about you Moine? How're the nightmares?"
Hesitating and unsure, I clobber down the stairs as I peek out the window. It was already late at night, the stars and the moon were already high above the sky.
He, suddenly, laughed softly. "Harry, wait." He said as he walks towards me with an amused smile plastered on his face.
P.S: You can Goggle the Gulon if you want there are other facts about it as well as its pictures as for the voice please imagine the cat's voice in Alice in wonderland.
----------------------------------------------
Hermione wasn't all happy for the Captain's decision as she was still complaining about my sake. "Harry is still in pain from those injuries. How can you say?" Which was totally ignored by Wood. Making Hermione angrier. Poor Ron had to receive the angry shouts and the jabs from the elbow just to calm down Hermione.
“Is it delicious?” She asked mischievously as she sauntered towards me.
The blonde sighs. "Alright. But be prepared, it's a good thing you're a Gryffindor because this is not a pretty sight to see." He warns. "I want you to be ready with anything I ask for Granger. Anything." He emphasizes.
And even though, I haven't decided on accepting his help, I still wish that I could thank him for saving me from going insane with hunger. I just couldn't think of anything or anyway to show my gratitude to him. It's gonna be awkward if I just pop out of nowhere and act friendly with him, right?! Not the mention, embarrassing to just say 'thanks' upfront to your rival.
"Minerva, we still have to hear out, young Malfoy's side." The headmaster spoke in a serious tone.
Message
FUCK HER!
From the previous chapter:
He stops from his track then he slightly turns his head towards me. "What, Potter?"
Dazed by what is actually happening and looking like a fool as I am standing on the side. When I heard Ginny's hurt voice spoke loud at Michael. "Michael, are you calling me a bitch? Is that what I am to you?"
"Am what?" I muttered as I was in a confused state as to what is the meaning of the word was uttered.
Those eyes were like a gem, dazzling me into a chaotic state.
Quidditch against the Ravenclaw will be a week after. Shit! A match when I wasn't really feeling it.
"What do you think is the meaning of these dreams?" I asked. I had to admitted I am greatly disturbed by the constant visit of these dreams but also it was weird, scary and it felt real.
From afar, a female voice cried out.
"That kind of hurt a bit, Johnson," Malfoy said but was easily ignored by Angelina as she was facing the Ravenclaws that were looking worried and in panic as they were busted of spying - underhand method.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
As I lay my head on my pillow, sleep overtook me. Then I dreamed differently for the first time after these weeks.
I don't know how many hours that Hermione and I had stayed like that - lock in each other arms. I needed her support and she needed my courage as we had each other's backs.
End of the previous chapter.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
Silence reign over. A minute had pass by. Yet no one spoke. No sound can be heard except for the sobs that once in a while came from Ginny as she embraces my right hand, hard.
Then he left. Walking away as he took his bottle and his bag, towards the castle, followed by his butterflies and oddly, followed by his housemates.
"Are  you alright?" She worriedly approached me.
"Show off!" Ron grumbled and glared at Malfoy. "His father must have bought it again for gloating"
Appalled by Oliver's attitude of unconcern for Malfoy's safety, I struggled to understand her logic. For him, Malfoy is someone unworthy of his attention because he was not His friend, not Gryffindor, and not beneficially to him in winning in our upcoming match thus he doesn't interest him to save him. Simply as that.
Sighing heavily, Malfoy pushed me back on the bed, gently; trying to make me, laid down.
I snapped out of my mellowing and just look at his face as he asked me. My heart went different kinds of seizure as I thought of the possibility of a relationship with Draco but my mind throws me off, with a 'How about Ginny?'
"What do you mean? Make something up?" I said suspiciously as I also stretch up and leaned towards the chair then pull my muscles from my shoulder.
Chapter 12: The Hunt
"Buffy?" I muttered as I raised one of my eyebrows, puzzled by his claim.
"Hobgoblin,"  Draco whispered, crouching down slowly.
"Yes, Mu- Granger." He turns with a snort.
"Hmm..." I replied nonchalantly as I slowly sat up to give her space to sit on the bed. Hermione sat beside me as she offered me the other mug.
I stared at him as my eyes widen and whispered in a baritone voice, "Yes."
"Oh, Dad would be jealous." George snickered as he made eye contact with Fred.
Panic and fear erupted from within me. It was true that I was weakening, my heart was in frantic beating and my breath was about to halt. Maddening dread course within my every vein. Despair keeps me locked in. As I could feel my body becoming cold-like icicles had sprouted within my flesh and my heart slowed from beating. Darkness came invading my mind. That's when I know - that death was upon me.
'Shut up!' I shouted at her in mind but I can't help as almost agreed with her. Ron's plate is a mess. The plate was shoved under my nose and as I caught the scent of chicken. I, suddenly, became sick. My stomach turned and twisted horribly. Perspiration broke out from my skin and drenched me, my head begins to swim and I felt dizzy and cold.
Disclaimer: This scripture was based from the characters and scenes from the astonishing novels: Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling, and as an aspiring writer, I have no rights and claims to these fantastic novels but I dare say, what I only own are the ideas in this tale: HUMAN.
"Arrogant prick!" Ron snapped at them along with Fred and George who also started to grumble.
Then Professor Snape raised one of his hand and laid them on Malfoy's shoulder, a gesture that I thought the potion master could never make.
"Calm down, Harry!" Ron said as he went to me trying to put both of his hands on both my shoulders and guide me to sit in the lounge.
"I don't need it." I pressed my lips hard as it forms a line.
"Silly, Harry! No. You're alive.'
My home, Hogwarts, and the Wizardry world.
Malfoy is surrounded by 24 miniature crimson butterflies as they dance encircling him, and a king-size crimson designed by black and blue patterns rested on the left side of his head, looking like a hair accessory. Malfoy looked so beautiful to me that it disturbed and made me think if I am actually crazy.
"Are you sure about this, Draco?" Hermione asked as we trudged the wild bushes and the ancient trees of the forest. "Should we just hunt in the meadow, like the other day?"
Thankfully, Ron isn't here. He will be super jealous.
"Hmmm..ahk...mmh..mmmmmh...agh!" I could hear his muffled moans and his ragged breaths as he shuddered continuously while I licked every corner of his sweet and seductive crevice. His legs were shaking as he sliding down to the floor. I released my hold on his face and grasp his hips as I raised him and made him leaned against my body, creating no space between us. I shiver with anticipation as I move forward to make him mine
My run had slowed down as my blood slowly gushed out from my wound. Cold-sweat poured from my forehead if I could only let Hermione escape to safety. "I'm f-fine" I rasped out, wincing from the pain.
And Harry, I am also capable. I am after your rival. So that's why for this incident instead of an apology, I really would like for you to thank me."
"Yes!" Ron seized his utensils and look at his plate with anticipation. Professor Dumbledore had gotten on his feet and with his twinkling eyes said. "I have only two words for you all. Tuck in."
--------------------------------------------------
"So, what is this experiment that both of you are talking about?" I asked at last as I couldn't handle the quietness and my curiosity is killing me.
We have become fugitive. It's a problem that we have to face, eventually.
'I know that I'll never be the same again.
"Potter. We're waiting here for your answer and close that mouth of yours - that is so not attractive." Malfoy said in a bored tone.
"Harry, do you have a minute?" Remus stood against the door, as he was looking at me. I was packing my things in my trolley, a day before our departure to Hogwarts.
"So as I was saying, what did Ms. Vane had done to earn her a lawsuit against her." Headmaster Dumbledore repeated for the sake of re-opening the topic.
"What, Malfoy?" He asked with an impatient tone.
Clutching my abused head as kneeling on the floor, crying out. Nursing my injury, I glared at Draco with all my might.
' You'll find out very soon, Harry - darling! Soon you will.' She giggled, dark as it sounded. 'For now, open your eyes, Harry. And have a feast, fill yourself to your heart's dark desire.'
"Ah, wait," Malfoy called after I was out of the woods and I was walking towards the castle.
"I have to go," I said as I back towards the woods to escape from him.
After seeing my grotesque abdomen as it was paled with purple patches and flesh that bulged forming an eerie screaming face of a woman, both - me and Hermione, decided to go straight to Professor Dumbeldore and made our way to his office. Unfortunately, Oliver had happened to appear at the next turn of the corridor and took hold of one of my arms.
We started to walk towards the door to wait outside when Malfoy said. "Why not let them stay to listen. Whatever decision that this meeting will come up anyway will surely spread around the school after a few hours. Why not let them hear it out so the word will spread faster but this time maybe, it would be more accurate than the widely spread rumors that will be mixed with lies. Right?" Malfoy said in a bored tone.
I drank and I drank. Easily finishing the two acromantulas. But I wasn't satisfied, the taste was lacking. Then I started to indulge myself with the flesh of the others that were brave enough to attack me. Abruptly, a  blast of cold came out of my body, making the temperature go down a few degrees. And with the show of power, the other acromantulas flight in fear, leaving me alone with nothing to eat.
"I thought I stop caring, Hermione." I croaked as I enclose my face with both my hands, unable to stop the painful assault of the unexpected emotions that just burst into my chest, like a shotgun - fast and deadly. "In all of those years, how can they leave me because of a single moment? Was our relationship, Ginny and I, was up to this point? Replaceable? Meant to be abandoned? Was my friendship with Ron has an expiration date to suddenly disappear just like that? Does he not trust me or was I not trustworthy?"
Then she stops suddenly. Still coughing and trying to inhale as many airs as I can, I watched her as she froze in place staring beyond the horizon. She whispered. "Someone else is here"
"Always happy to correct you, Granger." He said finally, with a hint of teasing in his voice.
"Really?" Ron asked as his blue eyes grew wide. "Blimey...I think I should also start working out. That's why you got buffy this year."
"Huh?" Idiotically, I uttered. "Your not upset?"
That's the last thought in my mind as darkness invaded and I heard Malfoy's shouts as I fell asleep.
"Not only that! even Ginny." Fred guffawed at his own joke along with his twin.
A few of our friends came looking for us as the afternoon progressed. Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan, and Dean Thomas sat with us talking about the latest Quidditch games and the recent updates.
A grim smile spread across Malfoy's face.
I blushed at the sight of him as I felt my whole face burn, hotly. Dumbfounded by his beauty, I stood there like an idiot.
His soft blonde hair that wasn't gelled back, his elegant pose as he sips his chocolate drink looks beautiful and sexy, his skin that was healthy pale and smooth as I had felt when I've held him, his grey eyes that brightens in interest or darkens with desire when we kissed and those lips...
In an instant, I was nothing but a beast hungry for the blood and flesh that I sought. No trace of theme, Harry Potter, the human being. No shred of human remains within me.
"Harry Potter, The New Dark Lord has Risen!!!"
“You’re crying” he accused. “Please, don’t.”
“I know.” He said in a matter-fact tone.
"Why can't you all let it be?" Malfoy said quietly.
"Don't be a spoiled sport, Severus." The Headmaster said calmly as he smiled at Snape.
"Was he alright?" I asked, timidly.
"Harry, rest for the meantime." Moine always the mother hen. "Will be going to Diagon Alley, today."
"Hermione!!!" Ron shouted out. "You're the best."
I wonder in awe. While I was busy thinking, a knock sounded from the door.
I smiled at him as he tried to smoothen my worries. "Thanks, for calling me handsome."
"I said you are in a daze again." Hermione repeated.
I woke up, gulping for air. As if I was drowning instead of being awoken from a slumber. I, frantically, searched for my glasses. Anything to dispel my dream and to clear my disillusioned mind.
"Inheritance is something that you have accepted from your magical blood either a trait, a creature power, or a level up. Basing from your family background, I suppose it came from your Father's side as he was from a pureblood family - the Potters. An Inheritance may come to you by age due to the strong magic that had to linger in the blood or the heir of the family that naturally happens to the pureblood family. While in your case since your mother is a muggle-born. Thus it only came to you because you have unnature high magical power." He explains it to me with detailed entail that almost all my worries had been washed away.
I was woken that early morning by the nudging of Mrs. Weasley, whispering to me to wake up. I felt that I barely had lain and slept in Ron's room. I slept late last night because I couldn't sleep at all. Not because of a nightmare this time around but because I had a lot think of, especially about my demon and Remus's reaction yesterday. Apparently, It was time to wake up and prepare for the departure to Hogwarts.
Then they went off.
"What do you mean guys?" Hermione looked at us with confusion and alertness.
My stomach yet again sounded out. Ugh! I don't know if I could survive this humiliation.
And it's not helping that we are being chased by giant man-eating spiders and Hermione, who is in my arms has a mouth-watering scent that it's making it hard for me to focus enough.  I forced myself to keep going on, weaving through the trees, avoiding the pincers and the legs of the Acromantulas that did manage to get near us.
A creature that resembled a man with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms and twisted face with rows of sharp teeth emerged from the darkness, grunting as it scavenges the area for food. It was holding a club as a weapon as it swings around beating the bushes to scare the small creatures that were hidden.
"Well, it's not so bad... our schedule for today," I said as I examine the column of subjects under Monday, tracing my finger until it stops at a subject in the afternoon. "Double Divination, Ugh!"
-------------------------------------------
I dreamed of Draco.
"Harry are you okay?" Hermione said as she saw my face pale and sick.
Hermione sat beside me. "Do you need some medicine?"
Chapter 11: A Monster
"Yes, she said so herself." Professor McGonagall said.
Headmaster Dumbledore coughed behind us, stealing our attention. Blushing, the three of us, turned to him.
"Har...ry, let me b-breathe..." He whispered in a breathy and raspy tone as his lips were so red and pulp from kissing.
"Symbol?" Ron mouthed looking over the two tunnels ahead of us.
"What do you mean 'I guess'?" Hermione snapped at me. She suddenly grabbed my shoulder and urge me to stand up. "Let me see them. Let's go to Myrtle's bathroom."
= v =
"The barrier broke." I said then I took her hand and pulled her. Hermione screams in surprise. I had no time to explain to her my plan, so I just executed it. When Hermione was in my arms, I carried her in bridal style and speed up my run.
"Granger, what do you think is the creature that Potter has become?" He finally inquires me.
"Yes. We are." Snape's whole body stiffly turned to Malfoy.
"Thanks, Gin," I said, smiling at her.
"Shut it, Hag!!!" Michael shouted with ferocity. It seems Michael hadn't still gotten in his head that such could lead to Ravenclaws' disqualification or Ravenclaws' reputation being questioned. "Even so, you have a notebook but you cannot deny that I am sporting damage. Making you all in the Gryffindor committed an act that may also lead to your disqualification."
I took the tray and put it over my lap, the warmth radiating from the food, could be felt from the metal tray. I started to scoop the porridge and tasted it. It was warm and delicious.
"Potter, you might be a Strigoi"
Hermione had a second of surprise expression on her face as she didn't expect Malfoy to hand the notebook willingly and to be called with her surname instead of mudblood. But the surprised look on her face, dissolve as soon as she opens the notebook and began scanning for the content.
"Whoa, Harry your green" One of the twins, George commented about me, his voices are laced with heavy concern.
(Hermione's POV)
But one scent remains, the aromatic one - that was far more appetizing. Promising a delicious meal, flesh, and bones. I turn around in search of that smell.
"Like what you see?" He suddenly told me as he smirked at me apparently he caught me staring at him or more like ogling in a perverted way.
'Close to submerge into your reality' She sang in my head as it bounced and echoed. 'My body has already fused with yours, right? Around that time, remember?'
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Thanks," I said as I smiled at her. I slowly laid my hands on her shoulder. "Let's go, Hermione."
Possible creatures:
It hurts! I gasped as I forced my lungs to take as much air as it could handle. The ache shoot from my legs as I ran as fast as I can - blindly scrambling away from the creature. I could hear my heart pounding loudly that I could feel it slam against my chest walls.
So, that why here I am! Sighing, I just have to suck it up until the match ended.
4. Lich (Are you serious, Moine? by Harry) (Yes, I am by Hermione) (dead with magical enhanced ability, intelligent, reawaken by a dark wizard/witch - so it could be?! by Hermione)
"Yeah." I answered. "We plan to find and trace his tracks of where he might be."
Turning to my side, I closed my eyes. "Night, Ron."
The hunters found us!
"Hey!!!" Ron complained but seemed to lighten up as the misunderstanding on his part had been cleared. "Sorry, Harry. I guess I was just tired."
"I'm okay. Just tell me where the kitchen is." I said, smiling to the house-elf.
"Malfoy," Hermione said in a less provoking tone.
The grey sky grew darker as it restlessly grumbled. The clouds were thick and blackened as they float above the sky, they struggle to withstand the heavyweight as they held the rain, which was soon to fall. Then the rain poured down; the drops fell on the leaves and to the ground.
It's cold.
"Yes, do that please," Malfoy mumbled with such intense sincerity. "I'll be waiting for you."
"Yes, do that please." Malfoy mumbled with such intense sincerity. "I'll be waiting for you."
Realizing that she couldn't defend herself, she lift her upper body facing me. Her face was full of terror as she was waiting for me to end her life. Begging me, with her cries and calling out for the name - 'Harry'. I was happy as I slowly approach the human. At last, I could finally eat.
I laid on my bed, It felt warm and comfortable as I listened for the rain outside and the breathing of my roommates.
"We should do must we could do." Ron said as he yawned then stretch both of his arms then slightly curved his back backward.
----------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
"Stop insulting my father." I snapped at him as I glared.
Blushing as she was embarrassed with my praising, she just shyly pats my right shoulder. "Stop that, Harry."
"Harry, dear." She sobbed as her grips tighten. "Where have you been? Are you hurt? Are you hungry? We were worried about you!"
From afar, a female voice cried out. "Harry!" She weeping as she walks weakly towards me then abruptly running towards the blonde male. "Malfoy, what should I do? I have done all the things that the books had to describe, the ones that I got from Hogwarts. Some of their suggestions have work. But this...I just don't know what to do. Please Malfoy help us!"
With my praising words, it has completely shut her up as she looked away and blushed.
Then out of nowhere, the alarms sound out. Hermione and I were on full alert as we immediately stood and pulled out our wands.
'Tsk. Tsk. Harryyyyy.' The voice giggled. 'Lying again, you're a very very bad boy'
What's happening to me?
Madam Hooch flew by my side and saw the Golden snitch inside my clutch hand. "With 210 points. Gryffindor WINS!" She yelled. As soon she speaks out, the whole Gryffindor cheered with shouts and howls.
"And you believe everything she said." Malfoy snapped with a wild smile on his face. "HHAHAHAHAH...."
I snorted.
"I know. You were too tired and you needed the sleep." She said as she sat across me, between us was a small table. "No harm is done."
"Granger, can you hear me?" Malfoy spoke gently at me as I stood there, staring at them in a complete daze. Blinking to awareness, I moved towards quickly.
"No. That's not it." I said, aggravated as to why he can't understand my stand.
"I am sorry, Malfoy. I got distracted." Hermione apologized to him.
"Nothing, Headmaster," Ron replied.
Pansy had found him as she appeared from the doorway with a worried look written all over her face and gestures. "I've been looking for you. Why are you here?"
"I agree," Draco said with urgency in his voice. I guess he was also aware of the upcoming danger.
"Good Morning, Hagrid," I replied back.
"Goodnight Harry," Ron mumbled sleepily as he soon snored, having fallen asleep.
Malfoy sighs. "Alright. but be prepared, it's a good thing you're a Gryffindor because this is not a pretty sight to see." He warns me. "I want you to be ready with anything I ask for, Granger. Anything." He emphasizes.
Sighing, I took a spoonful and took a bite. I gasp in surprise. Immediately, the taste of flesh and blood took over my mouth. The slight thick consistency of the blood with a metallic tinge in it, followed by the soft and mouth-melting meat, it was pure heaven. I almost purred with happiness.
In past days, I found out that Tiffany, was the personal elf of Malfoy and it was also bonded to him. A relationship between master and servant. At first, I was appalled by the said relationship and reprimanded Malfoy for making this poor creature force bonded to him - which eventually back-fired at me as it was really Tiffany, who ask for the bond contract and was the one, who brutally informed me about it. Adding that she sarcastically called me - Know it all Miss, when Malfoy is not around. I also found out that they seem to be innocent and smiling Tiffany is more sarcastic than her master.
I know that my actions were childish but they should have known better than to hide it from me. No person that wouldn't be fire up if one of their loved ones is in danger.
I smiled at Ron and let it be my answer to his question.
From the previous chapter:
'Oh, feisty.' She giggled in my ears. 'But I can't leave you alone, Harry because I love to stay and mess you up.'
"Nothing" I squeaked in embarrassment then more laughter followed.
It was almost noon when all of us decided to have a late lunch. Coming out from Quality Quidditch Supplies shop, huddled up to The Leaky Caudron. When an unwelcome voice sounded out.
Rolling her eyes, not believing me a single bit. Hermione continued. "She means you look healthier."
"Harry?" A red-haired girl called out as she slowly stood up from where she was, timidly. A male was beside her, with the same red hair. My guess, they were brother-sister. And another female, who was on guard,  with busy brown hair.
Everyone's attention turns to us as soon as I spoke. The whole class has gone quiet and been looking over our table as Professor Trelawney speculate my teacup in wonder, turning it over and over - trying to decipher the image in the cup.
We reached King's Cross safely. I was already used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. As for me, Hermione and Ron walked by the group, walking straight through the barrier between platforms nine and ten. We have to do it in an unobtrusive way to avoid any attention from the muggles. Chatting and being relaxed is the best way to do it.
My sanity was questioned by many. I shuddered, remembering the look on the faces of the people that surrounded me upon the discovery of my transformation.
'Well?' She asked, waiting and expecting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"And do you know that you could be expelled for what have you done?" She spoke more sternly.
Then out of nowhere, the alarms sound out. Hermione and I were on full alert as we immediately stood and pulled out our wands.
A pang of guilt that I have confessed to Hermione for causing her to jeopardize her life for me in which she denied forcefully.
"Let's just say, I have some experience and theories." He flipped a page and took a sip from his coffee.
"Slow down!" He spoke in a fast, hasty tone as he presses one finger from his uninjured hand on his lips; a gesture to indicate to keep quiet. "You don't want your friend to go loony just after I made him go to sleep."
'Stop taunting me!' I replied back.
Ugh! I got so frustrated as I started to gnaw at my nails, a new bad hobby that I have developed from these past few weeks.
"Here." He reached out then took my hand placing a small pouch. "These could help you to curb your hunger for the meantime."
The heaviness on my head and the ache on my legs are the first things that greeted me, as soon as I woke from my slumber. I slowly sat from where I had laid and brought my hand to massage my throbbing temples.  It's a good thing, the bed was soft, which helps me to have a good sleep. I sighed as I let my other hand, appreciate the soft fabric of the mattress.

"I guess." I sighed as I almost made a U-turn.
"Yes, please do, Hermione." I said as I am intrigued.
I stayed like that withdrawn, bent, and hidden in my hands for how long, as I can't remember.
"Plan?" I was startled by his unexpected question.
I slowly sat up as Mrs. Weasley went over to Ron to wake him up next. I almost forgot to put my glasses on since my vision got cleared up. There was no to little light that is passing through the window's curtain as I got dressed in my old pair of jeans and oversized faded red t-shirt, courtesy of Dudley; We would change to our uniform in the Hogwarts Express within the duration of our travel.
"Are you alright?" He asked as he saw me acting strangely.
"Yes, he added a few drops of his blood a while ago," Hermione answered as she was still reading her newspaper. Her eyebrows were drawn in together as she was contemplating the latest news that Draco's eagle owl delivered this morning. "I guess somebody gossip to the tabloids our situation, Harry"
"Yes," I answered back without hesitation after walking out from where I was hidden.
The silence in the entire room was making me nervous as I gulped my own saliva and my sweat broke out, even Ron and Hermione waited unnervingly for the Headmaster's next words.
“No, I am not,” I said, rubbing away the tears and as I tried to make my voice steady but the more I struggle, the more it comes out hoarse. We held each other’s hands, I become aware that he was cold; his hands felt like ice. I tremble as a surge of panic and a wave of despair came crashing down on me as I comprehend what is to come. I told him that everything will be alright, that he’ll live on. That help will come, eventually. I recited words of comfort to him but it was only to soothe the growing fear inside of me.
"Har...ry, let me b-breathe..." He whispered in a breathy and raspy tone as his lips were so red and pulp from kissing.
"No. Different. A girl with pale skin, dark hair and-d -" I stuttered. "Red eyes."
Malfoy just raised one of his eyebrows and nodded. "They can't. Basically."
"What do you think is all about the incident this morning?" I asked looking for an answer.
I could see that both Hermione and Ron's face both have an expression of amused and disbelief, even Snape has one on his face but he was more of horror.
I felt miserable. As I felt my fears, worries and I am beaten-down inside. I am sick and tired of all of this. I want to have some peace. Tearing up as I face down with my palms covering my face.
"Looking good there, little prongs!" said a deep masculine voice that I was so familiar with.
'A jolly conversation between a giant and a goblin.'
"HARRY! HARRY!" came a voice, waking me from the darkness. That voice! It was Hermione!
Author: Metis’ mischief
"What?" Hermione asked as she gasped for air. It seems Hermione wasn't able to hear it from this distance.
"I see" I mumbled. Disappointed, I couldn't do anything about that. "What was the mission?"
After giving me the small leather pouch, he walked away from me. Inside the pouch, were the same blood pebbles that he was feeding his butterflies.
I know I am being a hypocrite with my growing affection towards Draco but Ginny is my first love and my girlfriend. That's why, I want us to be together then maybe, this crush that I have for Draco will vanish or turn into a love for a friend.
I stretch out my hand to clutch hers.
"What?" He blinked at me with genuine surprise.
Malfoy suddenly spoke. " Granger, are you thinking about where you will be staying then have no fear, I have a cabin, which I am staying in right now. I'm fine making accommodation for both of you.
It's a good thing, that there were no classes this day. I could lay down here as much as I like. A moment of peace and silence.
"Then tell me in the way you can." Hermione urged me.
"It was by the use of the twins' pranks, right?" Ron smiled as he remembers that. "Mom got to compliment them for that."
I was in darkness again. As I burn in pain, in hunger, and the hollow bottomless pit of insanity. I just want to end this all. I beg anyone to douse the black fire within me - relieve me by letting me eat or by death.
"Stop being stubborn, Granger." He said as he rolled his eyes at me. "Rest. One, dead last, and the troublesome brat are enough. I don't need another Gryffindor to drop dead on me."
"What does that mean?" I asked more seriously.
After giving me the small leather pouch, he walked away from me. Inside the pouch, were the same blood pebbles that he was feeding his butterflies.
Remus released me as he also greets Mr. Wealsey. "Sirius, Remus. You both came" Mrs. Molly Wealsey had just arrived. A woman with the gushing of motherly aura, clothed with a duster and Home-made sweater from colorful yarns, reddish hair just like Ginny.
"Are your injuries still hurting, Harry?" Hermione asked as she saw my irritation on my face.
"Harry," Draco called out as he stood up from crouching position and gaze at the dead moose with deep thought.
"That is something you have to discuss with Sirius, himself. It's about his family" Remus said in a serious tone that I couldn't disagree with. "It is something personal for him. Please understand," he added, seeing my reaction.
Author’s message: It would be a great pleasure and help, if you would give a bit of advice or comment about this Chapter 2: Enshroud by the wicked, as a way of giving me support and a form of guide in the improvement of this story. Stay tune for the next update. That’s all.
I immediately open my eyes at the sound of my stomach rumbling. Malfoy was looking at me with a weird expression on his face, a crossover of 'wanting to laugh' and 'staring at a fool' look. I know that my whole face must be so red from blushing. This is so embarrassing!
"Potter, I didn't know that you have become an animal." An arrogant voice said. "Seriously, you should have chosen a better meal."
Confused, I uttered, "What?"
My heart soared. 'How many times does this guy plan to stop my heart from beating?'
Letting out a sigh of relief, as Hermione relaxes then she turns to me. "How about you? Are you all alright? Hungry yet?"
"I wish we could forget the outside world. Stay as we were." Hermione muttered as she flips the pages of the book without actually reading it. "Grow old, the three of us. Together."
I felt frustrated with his reply then sighed. 'Of course, Malfoy is still Malfoy.' I thought.
A wave of raging anger flushes out of me as I remember how my friends turn their back at me. The memory of it was so strong that I snarled. "What about them?!"
My demon suddenly runs up to me, with that wild cackle. Her hands encircle around my neck then she pushes me down. As I hit the ground, her hands begin to squeeze. I couldn't breathe, the pain of her hold and of my inability to take in the air begin to flood me. I started to kick and hit her with my fists but nothing fazes her. Her weight on my body seems able to unbelievably immobilized me. And as I struggle more, the more she laughs and enjoyed my weakness and my inability to defend myself.
"Spit it out, Draco. Don't kill us with anticipation." Hermione rolled her eyes as soon as she saw his childish expression.
Fortunately, Draco was still level-headed as he struts to the unfortunate prey that I just killed. He observed for several long minutes before he patted on my shoulder, making released the tension that I didn't know that I had.
"I'm still a fan of Bulgarian," Ron said proudly.
A frown appeared on my face as I remember and learned never to judge by the appearance of any creature, be it a human or an elf.
I don't even know that I would react like that. It's like a dam, which was full of water, had broken down and all the emotions that I have been keeping just flowed in and drown all the rational thoughts in my brain.
"Ouch!!!" Ron pouted as he jumps up and down, stroking his injured foot."That really hurts."
I waited for the bomb to explode. Disgust. Fear. Awkwardness. Or worse...
His fist hit me hard!
I froze in my seat as I tried to process the story. Beside me, Ron muttered. "Bloody hell" Malfoy cut off someone's tongue? Wasn't that a bit too much? I mean I know Malfoy is a bastard and a meany, but he wasn't a sadistic maniac to be able to cut up a girl. This is not Malfoy that I know of.
Out of nowhere, a large Acromantula about half the size of an adult elephant leaped unto us. It's a good thing, my instinct had kicked in as I automatically skidded to my right thus I was able to avoid being crash to the ground. As the black acromantula realizes that his prey escapes him, his pincers clicked more vigorously in anger then came for us. Behind it, were others racing to reach us as well.
"What do you mean that Sirius has been missing for three months already?" I shouted as I stood up abruptly that my chair slumped to the floor from the force of me standing up.
"Sucess? Experiment? What the hell are you two talking about?" I complained as I getting irritated about being left behind by these two geniuses. "Do care to explain, Hermione?"
"Okay. If you say so, my love." I said as I put one arm around her shoulder and putting a light kiss on her cheek, making her blush again.
"Mate! I have been shouting your name for million times." He grumbled as he had reached my destination. "You have been distracted these past days. What's wrong, Harry?"
Then suddenly, Loud cheers erupted as the Lee Jordan bellowed in his Microphone: "GRYFFINDOR!!!"
"What, Potter?" He bites off.
"Thanks, Draco," I whispered as I stared affectionately at the teacup in my hand.
"We got company."
I woke up, surprised. It was very rare that I would have a good night's sleep without any dreams or disturbances with my overwhelming senses. Maybe that tea did help.
"SLYTHERIN" the hat shouted, after a few seconds.
I came to realize her inquiry as I stared at my hands and taste it in my mouth. A panic surge within me then denial.
Mr. Malfoy, speechless, step back with a solemn face as he was reminded of something. A minute passes before he spoke again. "Draco, I understand"
“What?!” I shouted in shock as I returned my gaze on the meat, with disbelief. “For real? Is there such a creature?”
"Upset?" She asked in confusion. "Why would I be upset?"
"What's this, Potter?" He smirked at me, with much arrogance. "Our brave Hero is shaking!"
"The flower among the parcel." Hermione pointed one with sadness in her voice.
"Oh, well. I bare good news that might brighten your day." He said casually, like he speaking about the weather today. He then took my hand and pulled me towards the couch to sit beside him.
Draco raised his eyebrows with some surprise.  Seeing my serious face, he nodded after a moment.
Standing up from the bed as I stretch my body; twisting my hips and pulling my back muscles with ease. Again, no ache. Usually, my body would have some pain from adjusting because of my transformation.
My entire body stiffened. "Yes..."
"I can't seem to remember anything, Professor," I answered. "I block out as I was falling."
Ron charged like a bull, lunging with his fists and kicks but was hindered by a group of Ravenclaws that came to save Corner. After seeing their brother being gang up by a couple of Ravenclaw players, the twins came charging with their snarls and battle cries.
"Are you alright?" He asked as he saw me acting strangely.
-----------------------------------------------
A human girl with bushy brown hair, as she warily came close to me, a stick on her hand. "Harry?" She said as she approached me.
No! it's too dangerous. But maybe a bit...
'Then I am really dead now?'
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred and, revenge along with it is love and hope. You have been warned!
"Professor Hagrid," Malfoy said, trying to catch Hagrid's attention.
After a few minutes of him reading, he finally looks up at me and slowly smirks in a lazy but sexy way as he found out my ogling. Out of embarrassment, I just fake cough and turned away from him, hiding my reddening face.
"I don't think that's the reason, Ron," Hermione said as she too peeked at the Slytherin table.
Uncertain with what I am actually experiencing or what could Hermione's reaction be, I mumbled out. "I can...actually hear them. Those people... T-the footsteps. The rustling of leaves... Their breaths. Hermione, I can hear them, loud and clear."
My eyes snap open as I turned around to assess my present situation. I was sitting on a sky blue queen size bed and underneath my feet was a velvet soft carpet that caresses my skin. The whole room was a mixture of shades and colors of light blue, creams, and hints of white. A balcony with curtains, draping over the windows and glass door.
Why don't just kill me and be done with it?
After a long 5 minutes of silence, Malfoy sat down with grace and poise. The aura in the whole office lightens up immediately as everyone had calm down. We also took our sit as we waited for the next discussion.
"No. You're absolutely wrong about that." Malfoy suddenly spoke as he was silent awhile aback. "You can't disqualify them from the game."
"It was just too late," Pomfrey muttered sadly. "His body had not able to withstand the stress of the large wound and cause a shock. Harry had a Hypovolemic shock due to severe and rapid blood loss, dear."
"I see." He said with half-lidded eyes and a frown on lips.
I couldn't stop myself from staring at Draco. The whole scenario is so surreal but what made me oggled at the sincere look on Draco's face.
Desperate, she took hold of his jacket and yank it. "I'll do anything for my best friend," she said in a tone that was hard and strong.
"Let's get our things, Harry. I felt an alarm that I have set eight meters away from us was triggered by someone or something. It's best if we get on packing before they could reach us." She whispered with authority as she moves around with agility.
Around us, a whole population of different hues of colors - red, blue, yellow, and green. Mingling in the air, the scents that made my hunger stir more. I want to eat so badly...
From the previous chapter:
The meat and bread inside my mouth were like heaven to my taste buds.
Professor McGonagall raised her hand to pinched between her eyebrows as if there was an incoming headache, then she sighed deeply and raised her head. "Very well, Mr. Malfoy as you wish."
I tried to breathe slowly as I push the boiling feeling in my stomach and clench both of my fists to prevent me from grabbing on to Draco because I might just lose it and just ravage him right here and then.
Reluctantly, Hermione continued in a more determined tone as the topic shifted to the possible solutions that they have theorized.
"He had an emergency to attend to," Mrs. Weasley said, quietly.
Disclaimer: This scripture was based from the characters and scenes from the astonishing novels: Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling, and as an aspiring writer, I have no rights and claims to these fantastic novels but I dare say, what I only own are the ideas in this tale: HUMAN
Sighing, I finally took pity on Ron,  as I turn to him again. "I'm hungry, Ron. Let's go downstairs."
"Really?" Malfoy's face had turned into a fake confused state before smiling and then he spoke in a sweet sickly fashion at me. " I glad for Potter. Really! I do. So, where are they?"
Underneath the cloth was a dead person. Not just any dead person.
I let that comment go. I knew it is really atypical. Dreaming about that strange girl that I have never met is definitely not a definition of normal. I must admit I have never seen anything like her. She was beautiful than any other girl I have known but at the same time, there was something eccentric and exuding of coldness in the way she speaks and moves.
Then, he raised his head to separate our lips as he heard me.  I gasp and whine with the sudden interruption of this addictive feeling.
I sighed again as I climbed down the stairs and reached the living room while I re-arrange my dark grey shirt, black baggy cargo pants, and laced up high cut hunting boots.
"I disagree with that Albus," Snape grumbled.
Turning away, He walks at the center of the field, holding the bottle filled with butterflies and placing it in front of him. Waiting for the whole class to pay attention to. As the others gathered around him. Malfoy began his lecture.
Seamus was already quiet and his face was hidden as he bows his head, clearly embarrassed.
I hated my life for what Fate took from me. First, my parents, who I never met and only knew through the stories of others then my childhood, which I spend with unloving relatives that prefer to make me feel unworthy of anything, and now, my life that I just earn recently by turning me into this monster that craves to eat even my best friends and my adopted family.
With eyes burning red, a face that had morphed into a monster that only seeks flesh and blood to feed on, a body that can withstand days of no food, nails that tear trunks of trees like paper and teeth that gnaws.
"I know Harry. But maybe we missed a turn. That is why we need to turn back." Hermione muttered.
We all settled in for the night, there had been an awkward silence after the talk about the Malfoys. As we have learned some things about them. Before Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley were friendly rivals in politics but never had that level of animosity between them that they have now. But after the death of Mr. Malfoy's heir, Lucius begins his mission to get rid of all the muggles from the wizardry world, calling them dangerous, barbaric, and animals, that Mr. Weasley opposed as being unfair. Resulting in their fight, thus Mr. Malfoy started calling the Weasleys - Blood traitors. While Mrs. Malfoy, who had some sort of relationship with Mrs. Weasley also became cold towards them and Draco a sweet polite child turned into a rude cruel teenager, a part which Ron and I couldn't imagine. All the younger Weasleys had no idea regarding this manner since it was a personal issue and painful to talk about, that's why it was avoided to discuss.
"Password?" She said as we approached her.
"We are tampering your food to finally see if all the theories we had come up with, so far, were true and as we saw your reaction to the soup that you are eating then that concludes that our experiment is a success." This time, Hermione answered my question.
"I don't know, Ron," Hermine said seriously. "I need to research about that locket and even Britain's old council of wizards and witches."
'Gurg..gu..gurgg...'
A moment of silence pass by between us, instead of feeling out of place, I felt more at peace than I ever felt. I lean on the tree that was nearby and I again close my eyes wanting to fully maximize the opportunity of relaxing even if it had to be with Malfoy. Well, Malfoy didn't seem to mind my being there. So, I taking advantage of it.
He drew his fist back again and came charging; for a brief instant, his eyes widened as I dodged his fist before he managed to tilt his head back and slam it into mine. Blood erupted from the cut that was made from the impact on the side of my head, right above my left ear. As we stood apart from each other, I realized that all of our teammates were surrounding us. Hermione and Ginny shouted in vain to stop us. The Professors were coming towards us, yelling words of promised punishments, if we don't stop from our fistfight, right now.
Elegantly but at the same time, a laid-back aura came from him, as he gently opens the said letter and his eyes silently scan the contents which made him, raised an eyebrow then later a smile. Making me forget my previous dilemma as I was fascinated by his expressions.
----------------------------------------------
Malfoy didn't panic or flinch away but instead walk slowly towards Harry. And with that unusual action, it might have stunned Harry as he ceases all of his movements. Upon reaching Harry, Malfoy, unexpectedly, brought his cut-up hand to Harry's lips.
I choked as his words comforted me more genuinely. I felt like crying and for some reason, at the same time, happy. My chest lightens up, all of a sudden.
From the distance, I could hear Ginny crying for me. Hermione's screams of horror. Ron's shriek for my safety. My teammates' panic chatters. Professor McGonagall's strict instructions as her voice waver from I suspect fear. And I could hear the coward Michael Corner stuttering as he says 'I didn't mean to-'. I was coughing out blood. My head was buzzing like static on the radio. My consciousness was fading. I... I don't want to die yet...
"So, we were able to find the suggested areas that where we could find Sirius and we went to those places, one by one. Searched those places but ended up as a dead-end until..." I halted unsure if I could continue.
"Then it means you don't lust over me?" He asked innocently as he flutters his eyelashes but his words made me choke on my saliva as I felt a cluster of emotional cocktail had just shot in all through-out my veins which were lust, exasperation, excitement, and annoyance. 'He is testing my control.'
A minute has gone by after I spoke. Maybe, both Hermione and I had not thought of any option regarding the proposition of Professor Dumbledor's letter that causes me to be speechless in the said matter.
"I wasn't able to protect you," I confessed. "You were wounded because of my carelessness."
"Oh my, Mione. I do not spit that is so uncivilized but I do love the idea of you dying to know what I have in mind." His eyes curved more as he smiled deeply, his teeth showed as he snickering evilly at us. "It's not every day that the smartest witch and the golden boy hungrily await for me to speak."
I still have Ginny and... Draco might not be into guys. Especially, not a male monster.
Hermione, from my side, raised one of her eyebrows in confusion and skeptically looks at me which made me calmed down. I scold myself for making an uncomfortable scene.
Sweating and feeling cold, I looked down at my food and pretended to be interested in it. "No, I'm fine"
"HARRY! HARRY!" came a voice, waking me from the darkness. That voice! It was Hermione!
"Yes. Yes, Of course.' Sirius said. "I have to thank you for those wonderful pastries. you have always sent out for us, Remus and I. Without those I would have died in St. Mungo for the lack of taste of their foods."
I sat there, listening absent-mindedly to Hermione as she retells how she and Malfoy had spent the time together researching and finally coming to understand each other while I was in a deep sleep for the past 3 days. The conversation soon started to go into a more serious topic and my mind went into an alert mode. Apparently, Malfoy let Hermione took the initiative in slowly revealing the cruel truth of the possibility of me becoming a dark creature, specifically, maybe a strigoi but there was no certainty. He left the room, giving the privacy we need.
I might lose my adopted family, the Weasley.
"Oh little master, you have arrived." The she-elf cheerfully greeted Malfoy, with its surprisingly clean light blue dress. "Almost, little master," it answered the question that Malfoy had asked with glee.
"Try drinking this moose's blood." He said as he tilted his head to look at me but my vision strayed unto his pale neck that wasn't covered by his winter coat. To me, his neck was more tempting than the moose's blood.
"Harry!" She weeps as she walks weakly towards me then abruptly running towards the blonde male. "Malfoy, what should I do? I have done all the things that the books had to describe, the ones that I got from Hogwarts. Some of their suggestions have work. But this...I just don't know what to do. Please Malfoy help us!"
With determination set in my mind, I stared at him and felt pain as I clenched my fists, saying word by word, like a vow. "This kind of thing...I definitely won't let it happen a second time."
"HARRY JAMES POTTER!!!" Hermione shouted at my ear. "I will NEVER abandon my best friend for my own safety. Remember that!"
"Yes, Uncle" Draco answered, quietly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' But you said I was dead.'
"Let see" Ginny turned the book upfront and read. "Enshroud by the wicked"
"I don't know, Harry."
I swallowed painfully as my throat dried up from this unexpected intense questioning. The fact that I absolutely have no idea is also painfully.
My demon spoke in my mind than like an electric zap in my head and booming pain spread through me. I clutch both my hands over my head as I gasp in pain.
Divination is second to my least favorite subject aside from Potion as Professor Trelawney kept on predicting my death, which is very annoying.
'Close?' I had to ask to stop myself from doing something as drastic as telling the others that a voice is talking in my head. They'll think that I'm just joking or even worse they'll think that I am becoming crazy. It's getting hard to breathe as I inhale and exhale faster. I think I am hyperventilating.
"Come again?" Ron's mouth was opened wide in a state of shock. "MALFOY is WHAT?"
"Bloody hell! What is that?" Ron stumbled as the cave gave another shook.
"Blood! Where did that blood come from? My eyes! What did you to my eyes, YOU DEMON?!" I shouted at myself through the mirror.  "SPEAK DEMON!"
"Maybe, your right," Hermione whispered as her eyebrows draw together in stress.
Well.
"You know very well, that endangered magical creature cannot be kept as a pet, Malfoy," Hermione said as she gritted her teeth.
A terrified voice spoke. "Call Headmaster Dumbeldore from his office." It was Professor McGonagall. "I don't care if he is in a meeting with the officials. Tell him that a student is down!"
---------------------------------------
"Hmmm...Might I give different sets of solutions to your problem? Harry? Hermione?" Draco carefully folded the said letter and gave it back to Tiffany, who went away after a snap of her finger.
"Okay," Hermoine apparently let it go as she had gone back to her conversation with Ron and Ginny with her Mother.
"Why?" I asked her briefly.
"Mr. Malfoy, she just hurled insults to you. I will give the due punishment to her bad behavior, rest assured. But in your case, injuring a student is a means of expulsion." She said sternly.
After two weeks of being confined, it felt good to be outside again.  Hermione came by my side with the same relief smile as mine. We both gone through the same ordeal so we understand each other the most these past few days. Being under the surveillance by the adults, who either think that I'm too fragile to even hold a glass of water by myself or thinks I'm too unsafe to sleep in the same room with my best friend, it was so suffocating and frustrating. It was almost a miracle they let me and Hermione be out in the open.
"Another creature," Hermione whispered in realization. "Feared by the Gulon itself!"

She was the one who also took the liberty to extract the blood from the bodies of the hobgoblins while I was knocked out and I only woke up after an hour. Draco was resting beside me as we were under the tree, waiting for me. My strength returned to me when Hermione gave me some extracted blood from the bodies of the creatures. I burned their bodies afterward and carried Draco on my back while I silently submerged in guilt and the feeling of uselessness.
"Ron. Hermione. Let's go." I said hoarsely from the exhaustion.
He slowly turned to Hermione and sweep one of hand directing at her as if he was telling her that she will be the one to explain the current situation to me. Reluctantly, Hermione nodded at him then turn to stare at me with absolute determination. A look at Hermione that I fear for it means that whatever I have become or whatever she and Draco have discovered is utterly serious.
He looked at me as one of his eyebrows was raised and his lips curved into a half-smirk. Sighing, he said to me. " I guess I have to make the first move."
More of the distress had sketched though Mrs. Weasley's face. The twins, who were just jostling around earlier also had tone down and were listening.
Ginny's whole face turned in a whole new level of red and started to mumbled about things that didn't seem to make sense. Taking pity on my girlfriend, Hermione came to her rescue as she calls out my name for my attention. "Harry! Stop teasing Ginny."
'Deal? What kind of?'
"Hold your horses there, kid. I don't want you hurting yourself" He laughed as he took a hold of my shoulders and embraced me, gently.
"There is still some." Hermione said as one of her eyebrows raised up and with a 'You're weird' expression on her face as she stared at Ron. "Here, I saved some for you guys."
"A strigoi, Potter and that's just a guess but the convincing out of all our theories," Draco uttered once again as he intensely stared at me, waiting for my reaction as patiently as his expression showed. Unfortunately for him, I am not familiar with that word nor the about said a creature that he is speaking about.
"I don't know, Harry," Remus said as his eyes evaded eye contact with mine. My eyes narrowed in suspicion.
"Eight meters away from us?" I asked in shock. Then why could I hear them as if they were very near?
Draco nods at Hermione as a sign of agreeing to her conclusion.
You told me that you'll love me no matter what, GINNY!
"Harry, dear, what's wrong?" Mrs. Weasley asked as she seems to have noticed the untouched food on my plate. Frowning, she pushed it towards me. "You're not even eating, dear. Is the food not to your liking?"
We laughed at our banter, lighten the intense mood. I felt relaxed after our conversation but then Draco seems to think more deeply as he raised his head.
No fear.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The Daily Prophet's headlines were about Dead-eaters attack a small muggle village a little far from Hogwarts" Hermione muttered as she straightens up, she took one of her books, to have a light reading. "But that was two weeks ago."
I stayed like that sit bent and hidden in my hands for how long, I don't remember. I just cried my heart out in front of Hermione and Draco.
Professor Trelawney was smiling at me as she looks at my cup in a loving manner, which was extremely disturbing. Whatever Jade means, it seems to be something Professor thinks of as precious in the way how her face glows with the prospect of it. Lavender suddenly giggled and then whispered something at seatmate, Padma Patil Then they both burst into feminine giggles.
The human girl stood up and slowly walk to the blonde male. "Malfoy?"
I stared at the steam from the cup of tea then eventually took a hold of it, with both of my hands. It took me for a while but the first question that came out from me was - where was Harry?
"HARRY!" She screeched in distress and fear. "Let's get out of here"
"What's with that goofy smile on your face? Wipe that thing off!" Malfoy grumbled at me as soon as he saw my face. He was still blushing as he made a irritable face.
"I took these books under the permission of Professor Dumbledore from the library." She uttered as she places the stacks of books on the wooden small table and took one for herself then began scanning it. "Here, Harry." She said as she took another book and gave it to me. "We need all the resources, we could get to find any clue or any information on regards to your condition."
"Really?!" Ron exclaimed. "So, No more food?" He quickly examined the long table.
"Ron..."Hermione grumbled. "I was helping Harry. He had a nightmare and got sick." She helped me as we made our way to my bed. Ignoring Ron as he skidded over. " Unlike you, who is sleeping beside him, slept through his screaming like a dead pig."
"I don't know" Ron croaked out, awkwardly. "But my guess is it's very bad. Mom and Dad are both shaken from whatever news they heard about Dad's workmate."
"Yes," Remus replied.
“Yes, I guess here in our country, such creatures are rare but in the warm climate continents, they are mostly seen. The frustrating part is that the meat on your plate is from an old one. We can’t buy the young ones because that would be breaking the protection act on these guys but since eating it has good effects for the magical development of a wizard that’s why even old beasts are still popular within the wizardry community. Don’t worry it’s not that expensive. Father bought it from the black market, which was sold at half the original price.” He explained as he took a bite from his cut croissant.
“Sure,” I muttered as I hop towards the drawers to grab some clothes. Pulling out a fresh pair of undies, a woolly fitted pair of black pants, and a faded red turtle neck sweater matching it with a pair of black rubber shoes. Then finally, checking myself in front of the mirror as I try to fix my helpless hair. It took me 6 minutes to finally give up on this bird nest hair of mine. At least, I am decent looking. I wouldn’t want Malfoy to think less of me; If I am wearing something sloppy. I went out of my room as I descended the stairs and walk with a skip in my feet as I slowly approached the kitchen.
From the previous chapter:
Panic and terror struck me.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Okay," Hermione uttered. "After all, I feed you almost half of the supply I had. I think we should really consider what is most of your diet? how many hours or days before your next hunger strike? or Can you still eat other things?"
End of the previous chapter.
"Tampering?" Shocked, I asked him.
Sighing, I let myself calm down before I started to walk away.
"Narcissistic brat," I uttered.
Pansy went beside him and offered his bag. Malfoy took out a small ancestry knife and held it, in front of us.
Ron and I groaned, quietly. So these are the days that we will be bored with searching our true selves through what? Ugh! Tea leaves, apparently. Yup! The joy... Bollocks!!!
Author's message: I am grateful for the music of Beauty and Beast's EVERMORE by Dan Stevens for inspiring me with  new ideas to put into this chapter
"Thank you, Malfoy for enlightening me," I uttered after inhaling and exhaling as I come in terms of my arrogance and lack of knowledge.
"Okay." Hermione rasped and took out a quill, ink and, a parchment. "Then tell me, Harry. What are the things that you have observed about yourself or what did you feel these past days before I found you?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Harry," Malfoy said in a gentle tone that almost took my breath away. "You don't have to suffer anymore. You can eat and drink as much as you want. Go on, eat."
"Good morning." She murmured with lingering sadness in her voice.
The famous Malfoy's smirk.
"There is some truth to what you speak but do you know that you are also robbing them of something else when you asked for their freedom?" He spoke gently but his eyes tell me of something else as he glare at me.
Disgust.
Glaring at Draco as soon as I heard his insulting words at me, but he was unfazed by my grimace as he continues to eat with a smirk on lips as he picks up his spoon again.
"No!" I rolled my eyes at him, as my blush deepen. "Actually, I was thinking about the Malfoys."
"Really, Severus. Stop bothering them." Malfoy spoke maturely. "I thought we are to discuss an important matter with the Headmaster."
"Tiffany is my bonded house-elf. She has much right to sit and eat beside me." Malfoy replied with a hint of coldness in his voice. "And this is my cabin, my father's rules do not apply here. My rules only matter in this property."
Out from nowhere, he took out a shiny object, it was his ceremonial knife!
"Well then, I will be leaving first." She said as she turns towards the door and closing it afterward.
I rubbed my face and shifted in my seat as the silence reign between the three of us as the reminiscing ended. Hermione and Ron were found by Sirius as they keep on shouting for my name when I have fallen in the dark pit. For some reason, Sirius was able to go around the said cave to find me while avoiding the Gulon. I was found unmarred at the very bottom of the pit with no memory regarding my fall. We also found out that Sirius was able to escape the death eaters by hiding in the Gulon's cave. Thanks to Sirius's animagus form, he was able to avoid and evaded the said creature while staying there. It was also fortunate that he was able to stumble on Ron and Hermione as they were planning to climb down the pit to search for me.
"And might I ask, if why does my mirror deserve such treatment?" He asked casually.
Then we have reached Hogwarts at last.
"Ah! Young Miss wants to bring those to the kitchen?" The She-elf asked in her tiny voice.
"It's information about our team's strategy," Hermione said as loud as she could.
"Malfoy, either explain to us the commotion outside or get out and go to them to make them shut up," Hermione said testily, look up from the book, she was reading awhile ago.
Something broke through our perimeter. I started hearing the clicking and the crawling sounds.
I was dying.
"Thanks," I whispered to her. Ginny only simper at me. As she took a cold towel and put it on my forehead.
Snarling, Sirius stomped as he strides to confront Mr. Malfoy. "Yeah, too bad ain't it  because then no one is going to smack that mouth of yours."
"I-is he dead?" Came a voice that had to cause my blood to boil, Michael. His scent makes me wanna puke as he smells bad like he was drenched by something, like a heavy emotion - fear.
Ginny's whole body tensed up then a whimper escaped from her. Turning her to face me, I saw her face painted with so many emotions - pouring out of her as her unrestrained tears fall from her eyes. A whole new feeling was born from within me upon seeing her in so much pain. A scourging heat of dark emotion. Hatred, that's what emotion bloom inside my chest.
'My emotions are all in the rollercoaster ride, this day. Being down then he brings me high.'
The wind blew from the other direction, shifting the scents away from me. Freeing me from the inviting smell of my prey - that had cleared my mind.
End of the previous chapter.
"Uncle" Draco uttered as he took Sirius' fist in both of his hands, holding it gently.
"Hey, Ron," I called out, curiosity made me.
My eyes turn to bulge as the offer was given by no other than Draco Malfoy, the heir of a pureblood family, that hated muggles. Especially, since, I have come to know the reason behind the said animosity. With no other choice and I am too stunned to say anything, I just nod my head at him.

"I see that you are awake, Granger." He spoke with a hint of surprise and a sharp tone.
Not this.
Then I found it.
"Not really, Mr. Corner" Hermione said in a determined voice. "Yes, it is true that you are injured because of Harry, a member of our quidditch team but you also inflict the same injuries on Harry. And Mr. Corner, you are also a member of the Ravenclaw quidditch team. Thus both will be disqualified from both respective teams. And let's add that evidence (small notebook) that you have been spying us - that may lead to another thing which also bad for your team."
Ron gulped loudly as he back away from the tunnels that he courageous almost marched on the earlier minute. "That's just statue, right? It can be that there's one here?"
"Y-your fangirls and fanboys were going on about it in every corridor of Hogwarts. To the point that it got so irritating. That's why I know." Malfoy hurriedly said as he turn his attention to his butterflies.
Then the first name was called.
(Hermione's POV)
"Thank you, Sirius, but call me Molly" Mrs. Weasley automatically responded with her motherly affection.
Then she laughs maniacally. It was maddening to hear it- as a sharp knife had just violated my whole being. I trembled in terror. “Harry…Oh, Harry…” she sang my name, savoring my defeat and my fear.
Malfoy slowly turns to Hermione and walks towards her. He placed the notebook on her reaching hand. "Read for yourself, Granger."
Disclaimer: This scripture was based on the characters and scenes from the astonishing novels: Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling, and as an aspiring writer, I have no rights and claims to these fantastic novels but I dare say, what I only own are the ideas in this tale: HUMAN
My attention was suddenly diverted as I heard voices that call out a name - Harry, they say. I also can hear the rushing of blood from everybody that is near me, even the thudding rhythm of their hearts that made me salivate and grind my teeth with anticipation.
Sirius raised his fist but was held back by Remus by an arm around his waist. "Let Go, Remus!" as he grabs Remus' hand trying to remove it. I can hear cheers of  'fight' and egging from the twins and Ron.
Telling him my secret regarding my demon is just too risky! And there is an issue of trust.
After that nerve-wracking and butterfly fluttering long kiss between us, Draco and I, finally separated in favor of wanting to ...hmm... calm down and think before doing anything drastic which I almost couldn't do as I couldn't stop kissing or thinking of Draco.
A bottomless pit of dread came falling in my stomach as I slowly faced the entrance of the tunnel, the Gulon warped its snarl into a vicious smile as its eyes were filled with deep satisfaction. The delight of our misfortune and our apparent tear-filled eyes, shaking figures, and the fear that it smelled from us. I stared at it as it sadistically made its walk slower like strut to its prey, playing as it already knows of our death that would fill its stomach with us being its food.
"It's n-not Harry's fault" Still trembling, the female said. "He just went out of control from the Acromantulas' attack."
“Then, the second agenda is we should hunt some creatures for your consumption, Harry.” He said afterward as he took out his wand and casting a spell to let us out from the barrier of his huge cabin.
"I thought I was invited for a cup of chocolate and some cookies but I guess I was wrong."
Remus' facial expression changed, abruptly, when I ask the last question. The flicker of the emotions was so fast but I caught one in particular which is - off guard.
Except it didn't came.
"My nightmares have been getting worse in these past weeks." I finally muttered.
"Hermione," I said.
Message: I cutting this chapter into 2 parts for research issues. Sorry for the long wait.
End of the previous chapter.
Feared.
I can tell that Ron was trying to rack his brain for something to cheer me up as I saw his reflection from the window's glass pane, fidgetting his fingers and shifting his weight from one leg to another.
A blast of strong magic came from my core flowing to my wand then shifted to the Hobgoblin. Unable to react on time, the Hobgoblin got sliced into half separating his upper body from his lower body, making tremble in fright. I was not ready for the strength of my magic. I cursed and spun around with disbelief in my eyes as I look at Draco and Hermione for answers.
"Maybe. It is said that it lives in Sweden." Hermione said as she sends a small ball of light towards the two tunnels.
I laughed in a delirious state.  Imagine, a pureblood, bully, and a Slytherin is now taking care of a Muggle-born, a lowborn, and a Gryffindor. Ron will have a fit if he knew. Sadness crept in as I remember him.
' But you said I was dead.'
Tiffany levitates the basket filled with bread, the pot of hot soup, and the teapot on to the table. Everybody settled down as each took a seat and serve themselves with a bowl of soup and a piece of hot pipping croissant, smearing with either butter or blueberry jam, and pouring for themselves a cup of tea to go along with their meal.
I realize that I was too forceful as I muttered an apology but my mind was still on kissing him.
I stared at his feet, as I can't seem to face him.
"H-Ha-Harry?" Someone called out.
I leaned back against my chair, letting the noise of the whole class and the drone-like voice of Professor Flitwick drown my head. The discussion was interesting and exciting. It would have been if I'd been able to really hear it. Instead, I was preoccupied with early events. My hands gripped under the edge of the table as I tried to hold myself in my chair. It's a good thing, Charms is with Ravenclaw. If it would have been with the Slytherins, I shuddered and shivered - fear of what could have happened if it were. I could still feel it - my hunger and my blood lust - for his blood. It wasn't getting any better. My stomach is still twisting in hunger.
"Maybe it's about that terrible accident that was in the news on the Daily Prophet." Hermione huffed weakly as she moved her enormous handbag beside her.
"Your Welcome, Harry" He smiled at me.
Then not for long, cracks could be heard as the barrier started to fall apart.
"You caught that,  Ms. Granger," Malfoy said, still with a cold smile. "As I said they are harmless as long as they didn't evolve. The thing is they are called Blood Dragon and it is not just a name. In every place, situation, or climate change, they have the capacity to transform can survive. They are the ever-evolving creatures."
A burst of hot searing anger filled my lungs as the air that I breathe in, turns painful. I just want to punch his stupid face. To fucking hit so many times. To see blood flow from every hit I inflicted on him. To make him feel pain. I felt my whole body quiver in ecstasy as the mere thought of making Michael bleed. Then I step towards him with much interest to make it all happen.
"Y-yes." Sighing, I kept my eyes close, trying vaguely to control my upset stomach.
Chapter 18: Fleeting feelings
"Yeah, Ron" I sighed. "Just follow Hermione"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"My nightmares..." I grunted out. Trying to calm my fear inside of me. Fear of being rejected and fear of accepting my current situation as true. "My nightmares had been getting worse."
I stood up slowly with quiet resolved under the dusky sunlight, then strode towards my intended prey. Hermione grabbed a hold of my shirt as she shook her head trying to convince me to stop but I gently shook her hands off and silently signal her my determination which eventually made her understood as she sighed and nod.
------------------------------------------
I tensed as I heard him. My heart slam against my chest and my throat dried up, almost immediately. "What have I become, Draco?"
"Potter, you're really a piece of work, aren't you?" He grumbled as he walks towards me, kneeling in front of me, and took my injured hand as he examined it. He took out his wand as he uttered a spell to remove the debris of glass shards, cleanse it, and lastly, healed it with a potion from his pocket as he added a few drops on my hand. Hissing as the potion took effect, the flesh mended together then he finally let go of my hand.
"Then, be best to go now. So, you won't be late. Tell Lyra that I say Hi" Sirius simply said as if all the anger from the earlier events had disappeared.
I open my mouth and took a bite. Heaven. That's the word that entered my mind as soon as the flesh and blood entered my mouth. Bite after bite, my consciousness slowly returns me. I was becoming aware that I was eating Malfoy's hand and he offered it to me, with no fear in his eyes or disgust. Even though, I vaguely remember his conversation with Hermione, his eyes that were watching as I feed was the only concern. That emotion that he was showing had hit me so much that my eyes unwillingly let out tears.
Then the back door open with a slam, Mr. Weasley almost run into Mrs. Weasley in rush, his face was pale and beads of cold sweat trickle on his forehead, but what was so prominent in his feature and expression is full-blown panic.
"Yeah, right!" Ron muttered sarcastically.
"I don't mean that," Draco answered back with contemplation.
I think if I don't pinch my nose now, I might have a nosebleed.
I look up at my savior. It was Draco Malfoy. He held out a hand and I took it. I slowly stood up and as I rise, all the blood had seemed to have vanished. Puzzled, I again faced Draco to ask how and why he was here in my dream but as I saw the same sincere look on his face, I just couldn't. I was mesmerized and have become speechless.
"Yes," I answered again. Sadness dwelling inside of me. Silence then ruled over us as we tried to nurse the growing pain inside of us. Only the birds that tweets as they passed us by and the rustling of the leaves on the trees as it sways from the gentle breeze were heard.
"To the Headmaster," Hermione whispered as she let go of me to speak and explain to them what was going on but alas someone else took their attention. Michael Corner appears with a crunch up expression.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Laughing the both of them, Fred and George started to hop and jump up and down around me and Ginny. "We won't - " George started. "- Promise, Little sister" Fred finishes then they started to run towards the boys' tower as Ginny chased them as she flares up.
Just like that.
"Arthur!" Mrs. Weasley gashed and grew redder. "You know that Sirius was just playing around."
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
"Thanks," I whispered. After a while, he waves his wand again as he fixes the broken mirror - restoring it to its original form.
"Whatever, Potter." He replied with a hint of a smirk in his voice.
"Yeah, I am," I said as to let some of my weight lent on her. "Thank you for your concern. But..."
"He is dangerous, Hermione!" He replied as he was still staring at me, with - some kind of emotion - disgust!
"Worse?" Hermione said with concern as her hand went to grab both of my fidgeting hands
With much force in my legs, I push forward and raised my left claw as I reach for her, hitting her by the left shoulder. As I have hit hard, she stumbled and fall to the ground. Seeing that she had let go of that dangerous stick, I took and throw it.
I’ve become too conscious upon discovering my new profound emotion towards my so-called savior, a long-time rival, and now my ex-enemy. I subconsciously, glance towards him and couldn’t stop myself from fidgeting about my appearance and I, even, watch out on how I should act in front of him, despite my reluctance to accept that – this is happening to me at this point of my life.
I become dizzy and almost fainted on the spot if not for Hermione gently breaking down the facts and details when she got to the part that I might transform my features into what was describe as a monstrous being - a mixture of a wolf, bat, lizard or even a scorpion - that Hermione has to stop as I almost fell out from my chair.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Ginny, who is now my girlfriend. And he was jealous of me. Huh!
It's a good thing, Billy and Charlie were both home and had some sort of vehicle to help us be transported to our destination. A small car from Charlie and a motorcycle from Billy. Of course, all the trunks were put in the car while the twins immediately took the sit on the motorcycle and all the rest got jammed pack in Charlie's car even with the help of magic to make it spacious.
Hermione nodded as she looks at me, intensely while Ron just leaned back in his sit - imitating me.
"I still need some proofs and of course your help for additional information in regards to what did exactly happen to him."
'Thank you, Malfoy for saving Harry! Thank you! Thank you!'  I continuously thanks Malfoy, my voice cracked and my sobs suddenly erupted from my body, as at last the reality of almost losing Harry hits me hard.
"Where are you going?" Ron spoke aloud. Ron, Ginny, and with twins look at us with a questioning gaze.
Feeding time that was my body saying to me.
"Malfoy. I got it." Angelina Johnson, another team member said with an impatient tone in her voice. "Give me a notebook."
I blushed in embarrassment as I remember how I took out my anger on his mirror.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco just let one tired but amused laughter as he said, "I'm fine."
"Hallucinations!?" Hermione's voice went a little high as she stood up immediately then kneeled in front of me to look into my eyes.
'Oh, we're safe.'
"Ron?" I asked, confused.
A surprised look appeared on his face.
"Then why are you terrorizing them in this very minute?" Malfoy said coldly. A perfect imitation of his father. "Aren't you the adult one, Severus?"
"Knock. Knock. A knut for a thought?" A feminine voice sounded out from the direction of my open door. Hermione stood there holding two steaming hot mugs with I suppose to be chocolate, I could tell from the smell.
The blonde sighs. "Alright. But be prepared, it's a good thing you're a Gryffindor because this is not a pretty sight to see." He warns. "I want you to be ready with anything I ask for Granger. Anything." He emphasizes.
"Hey!!!" Ron who heard the comment snapped at his sister to shut up.
"Yes. Thank you, Draco." I repeated as I smile at him.
During the ride, the rain again poured down this time harder and heavier. The long procession of the carriage was rumbling and splashing its way up towards Hogwarts Castle. Luna cracked the window open and she looks up to the sky. She said in a serious tone. "Look at the sky, Harry. It seems that the dragon is crying."
"The result of our experiment meant you are most likely to hunt and eat beings that have high magical power, as the soup was from a horned rabbit, a magical creature of the east. That would also include us, wizards, and witches along with other magical creatures." Draco replied with seriousness in his voice. "With it, we also concluded what creature you might have become."
' Why does he have to look so good?' I grumbled to myself.
He was dragging a large glass bottle and he pulled the stopper as he did so, a flock of butterflies flew out from the bottle. Ah, I remember the blood dragon butterflies. The butterflies swarm around Malfoy, dancing and fluttering.
I raised an eyebrow at him. As his playful manner, erase the awkwardness and tension in the air.
Blinking into awareness, I slowly sat up. What greeted me was a jaw-dropping scene - Draco Malfoy, carrying a tray of food. Wow! I knew it! The world is really coming to an end. This just does not make any sense!
In my last-minute decision, I did what I had to do. Throwing her out - to be able to save her then I fell into the dark hole. Knowing I saved my friend, I turned towards the pit, complete darkness engulfs me as I fall further than I slowly lost my consciousness as I hear the voice again.
"What did you think I was talking about, Harry?!" Hermione answered with another question as a smirk appeared on her lips. A familiar smirk that I know too well.
"We are to meet the Headmaster," I said, putting a brave front.
"Hmmm..."
"I guess...not really" I replied as I return to my brooding, staring yet again outside the window.
"Mmmhh..." Draco replied as a slow and seductive smile appeared on his face. "Is that so."
'Who are you?' I asked.
"Why are you here, Malfoy?" I asked coolly. Looking at him, his face was so pale, and had a weary look on him, like he was very tired, harassed maybe. Unlike the last time, I saw him. Malfoy just made a small movement as he peered at me with that cold look, as if he speaks to me with his eyes to 'shut up.'
I swallow with great difficulty as I shudder at the idea of eating any part of my best friend. I'm suddenly felt disgusted with myself and felt bottomless despair as there seem to no cure to this curse.
Oliver and Angelinarace over to take the notebook but Angelina was faster to grab it with force and started flipping the notebook. "So, you Ravenclaws have been spying on us. And this little notebook contains all of our strategies that you all have gathered. When did the Ravenclaws act like a Slytherin?"
Inhaling and exhaling deeply, Malfoy took another cup of tea then push it towards me. "Tea, Granger?!" he offered. "For the nerves."
"How-" I began to utter but caught myself from asking. I blushed as I realize I was about to open up, of all people, is with Malfoy.
Embarrassed, as I was caught off guard by the one and only Malfoy, I, immediately close my mouth shut and started to look at our surroundings as we are still in the forest.
"So. Harry, what had been burdening you?" Hermione whispered after ten minutes of whole silence.
"Well then, I will be leaving first." She said as she turns towards the door and closing it afterward.
"I know." I said but at the same time, wishing that it will always stay like this.
"I see." He spoke more sympathetically.
"Yes, Master Draco." The she-elf happily hop towards him.
Then a chortle of laughter sounded out - Fred and George. They immediately stood up and started acting.
A red-haired boy, with freckles across his two cheeks, was peeking from the gap of the door. Ron, my other best friend, was giving that suspicious look, shaded by the color green of jealousy. I had to stop my eyes from rolling. Seriously, up until now, he still thinks that I would take up an interest in Hermione.
Simply amazing!
"He's not worth it" Remus gritted. "Mr. Malfoy, I would appreciate if you would stop this and be best be in our own ways"
Grinning at him, I slowly roll my question in my tongue. "Malfoy, I having dreams with a female creature..."
'Disgusting! Pig!'
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
"Stupefy!" Hermione shouted, successfully knocking down one goblin near her. Making it, only four remaining to face off.
I could feel my jaws slacked and opened at what I had heard. If Ron was here, he would also do the same.
"What are you doing here, Corner?" Ron grumbled as he stumps towards us. The smile that had invaded Ron's face had long gone as soon as he saw Michael Corner from the distance. "You're not welcome here!"
Sighing heavily, at least Hermione and I have come up with ideas and that's a start! I didn't want to be more depressed with my situation. I needed to be strong for myself and Hermione. It was the less, I could do for her, she has been sacrificing her education, her time, and her dedication - to be with me.
"I'm already fine, Sirius" I scowled at him as I returned the embrace.
"Well, those subjects are too..." Ron stumbled for the right word.
"Then, how about us?" He uttered, with a quiet voice.
I feel hot as I stutter: "Yes, just tired.
P.S: This chapter was inspired by the animes that I have been binged watching lately.
My nightmare ended.
"What?!" I snapped at him. Unable to believe that he still insist to be arrogant after admitting to being caught doing something so unacceptable.
Then it spoke in a sing-along voice that sends fear in all of us.
"Harry, I am so sorry," Hermione whispered as she tried to approach me. Remorse was painted on her face as she drew closer and patted my back.
"Basing on the things you have told me, I can't tell you anything yet on why and what is going on." Headmaster Dumbledore said. "But I have an idea that I am to explore on. I would like the three of you to wait for my summon on what I could find out. Would that be okay, Harry, my boy?"
"I had been meaning to ask, Draco why are you here?" I asked as I put down my fork and tried to focus on his hands rather than his face.
"I suggest for you not to touch the knife, Professor Hagrid." Malfoy moved it away. "This is an ancestry knife, and only the ones with the blood of the Malfoy clan can touch it and if it is then held by someone less, the blade will automatically cut the holder."
End of the previous chapter.
(Harry's POV)
"Yes..." Malfoy said slowly, like how the snail moves as it creeps over the leaves and grasses, a manner that wasn't unnoticed. "So, Granger, as much as I would let you indulged yourself from wanting to stay look stupid as your mouth is still hanging open for any bug to enter it, I would rather not let you as I am seeing the back of your throat quite disturbing."
Slowly, the halls were filled by the wet, slurping of our tongues, smacking of our lips and deep moans and groans sounded from us and when we were finally out of breath, regretfully, we had to separate with harsh pants, not before Draco give me one last soft bite on my lower lip. And like a Slytherin he is, Draco released me and slowly back away as he said; "Good night, Harry. Sweet dreams..."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
' I did say you were dead but now you're alive. I made you possible to be alive. After all, we made a deal.'
She spoke again but no pain erupted. Just slight nausea.
"I have fixed his abdomen as I had put back his guts inside him but-' Mediwitch Pomprey said as she must have been near.
Hagrid was standing outside his hut, with his enormous dog, Fang.
I took him in my embrace in an eager, passionate way and my tongue seemed to disappear inside his mouth as he let my tongue slip past his redden lips and I dive desperately as if I needed a part of him to breathe.
End of the previous chapter.
He coming with a full swing from his right, ready to ram his fist into my face. I clearly saw the move and waited for it to come but before he could land it on me, a spell hit him. Michael ended on the floor with ropes tightly wrapped around him, he was bound and gagged.  I look up to see, who did, expecting it to be a Hermione or one of the twins but instead it turned out to be Malfoy.
"Then why are you not eating that much in these past few days?" He asked me.
I was lay at the center of the queen-sized bed, still in a daze. I slowly stood up and walk up to the door then I realized that I don't have my wand in my person. I started to contemplate what should I do when I don't have anything on me to defend myself or anyone to tell me what is going on.
Michael still likes Ginny.
"Thanks, Draco. Finally, there is somebody who can retort against Hermione." I turned expecting Draco but what I did not expect is what he would look like but soon I did see him. My whole body froze as well as my mind. My eyes never stray again.
"How-" I began to utter but caught myself from asking. I blushed as I realize I was about to open up, of all people, is with Malfoy.
After the incident yesterday, she suddenly disappears from my mind and had not spoken until I went to bed and strangely, I also didn't have a nightmare last night.
After hearing that name, both Mrs. Weasley and Mr. Weasley along with Remus and Sirius's faces morphed into shock then into an unreadable expression.
----------------------------------------------------------------
"Harry, I am so sorry," Hermione whispered as she tried to approach me. Remorse was painted on her face as she drew closer and patted my back.
"Ron" I called.
"Mr. Malfoy!!!" A younger male voice, like a first-year, called out. Then a female with must older sound, like the 6th year. Then another sounded out. It seems the whole Slytherin was trying to find Malfoy and from the tone of their calls- they are worrying or some of them are in panic tones.
"Harry! HARRY, PLEASE STOP!," A weak voice shrilled from afar. "THAT'S ENOUGH."
I rose from my slumber trying to leap up and twist to turn away from her but my body wouldn't budge from where I lay. As I open my eyes, I saw thin silver chains had wrapped around my body, which was hindering me from moving.
Realizing what I have said, a sudden burst of fear erupted inside my chest. I look up to see her face - it was filled with confusion and worry. I sighed relief at what I saw. Hah! I have been doing that a lot - sighing.
"Bloody hell! What is that?" Ron stumbled as the cave gave another shook.
Additional note from the author: This chapter is representing the level of relationship of Harry's friends with each other. This is intended for the sole purpose of you feeling the emotion that Harry is actually feeling in regards to his friends and loved ones.
'He knows about it'
I could feel my face turn to a surprised expression as I heard Draco called Sirius - Uncle. Sirius was also stunned as he stood there with a hanging jaw. Apparently, Mr. Malfoy was also astonished as well as the rest of the Weasleys and Hermione.
I cried.
This duo is always in tandem.
Note: I am sorry for the delay. Busy as hell because of the Quarantine And COVID cases uprising here in my place, especially when you a health care provider. Oh well! On to the story.
"Sorry about that,  Harry. I want to make sure to keep us both safe. Don't worry, I will remove those chains when I am sure that you are in full control of your urges." Hermione said she came sitting beside me.
Amazed by his proposal. All both opposing sides started at him, unbelievingly. Fred reacted faster than any of us. "Are you crazy, Malfoy?"
How single-minded am I!
"He needs strength, Granger. After rampaging like that and his very first-time real meal, his body is adjusting." He said confidently with a book in his hand as he sat on the lounge of his living room.
"I think Harry is sick, Mom." Fred intervened as he went up to my side.
Flabbergasted, I kept on staring at him even Tiffany, the she-elf took the tray from me and have been giggling non-stop at my antics.
Healthier? That perked up my curiosity.
"Yes, I do," Malfoy said again, calmly.
"I guess the golden trio isn't much of kind and generous heroes as they say. You can turn away people that are in need if you don't like them" He said as he gazed at Hermione with accusation in his eyes.
'Ugh, disgusting!' The voice sneered as I eyed Ron's plate. 'Pig!'
Hope you like it. Please leave comments or advice. Thank you.
"What's this?" I asked as I smelled the fragrance, it was surprisingly mouthwatering and had a calming effect on me.
“Yesssh…” He smirked at us as he slowly answered, prolonging the ‘s’-sound of the word, making me gulped so hard. He trudged through the forest path and we hurriedly follow him.
If the situation wasn't too dire, I would laugh with Hermione's panicking - her facial expression and her worrying like mom. I almost crack a smile.
' You'll find out very soon, Harry - darling! Soon you will.' She giggled, dark as it sounded. 'For now, open your eyes, Harry. And have a feast, fill yourself to your heart's dark desire.'
"They are called FRIENDS. Unlike the people behind you, who you considered as part of YOUR gang." I said with much more bite in my voice. I stood up and faced him with a much rage within me. He was getting on my nerves. Talking shit about me is fine but to talk bad about my friends is another thing.
"Do we have to climb those damn stairs every time we have a Divination class?" Ron grumbled breathlessly.
"Y-you know Potter, a-as I like to laugh at yo-your being foolish. Hehehe... You really need to eat. I don't want to be accused of preventing the golden boy from eating thus YOU fainting from hunger." He said as he had to finish his fit of giggles.
Laughter invaded the whole common room as relief and gratitude spread in my chest. I'm really blessed to have them.
"Your welcome, Harry." He smiled at me, warmly.
I nod, understandingly.
Did my eyes had the capacity to see in sharp and detailed sight?
"And she is the dangerous one," Hermione confirmed sternly. "The evolve one"
"I can distract them." I muttered as I avoided looking at her. "You can escape to safety."
"Bloody hell! What now?" Ron shouted as he fell on his back.
Me - Bloodshot eyes, sharp razor teeth gnawing, wild from insanity and hunger. Darkness and madness.
----------------------------------------------------------------
"I have to leave," I muttered to myself, pale and weak I felt.
"Harry, run!" Draco snarled as he cleaved another Hobglobin with a spell. The creature in front of me roared and swung his club with great strength. I jerked back as the club missed my head within an inch. I spun around as I grab my wand which I had accidentally let go when I dived and grab the hobgoblin.
'Oh, we're safe.'
"Hmm..." He muttered as he turns his attention to his butterflies. Throwing again a handful of blood beads, making them swoop down for it.
"Because I care for her. She had been with me since I was 10 years old." He said with very intense emotion within his voice. "Just because her nature is to eat flesh and drink blood, should I abandon her? Even if she never inflicted any pain to others, should I fear her? It's just a part of her and not her whole being."
"That's good to know." He smiled as he took out his wand and whispered a warming spell onto the pot of chocolate. "Here." He handed me my cup. "That will help."
I shrugged as I really didn't know what kind of creature Malfoy brought with him. I turned to Ron to ask him if he knew but Ron just raised both his shoulder and had the 'I don't know' expression.
Raising his eyebrow at me, he grumbled. "Maybe, your fever had really wrecked you up, Granger."
I know I am being pessimistic but there is a gut feeling inside of me that just won't go away.
"Really?" Malfoy slowly rolls the word in his tongue as he glanced with a peculiar glint in his eyes from the Headmaster to Professor McGonagall then to us. It was suffocating to be under his gaze, the pressure was too much - that I started to believe that Malfoy could do something bizarre.
"Thank you, Ron," I said as smiled at him. "That felt better."
'Oh, I have no doubt that they will.' She giggled in my head, sarcastic as it sounds. 'But it will be too late for you then.' Then her laughter bounced inside my skull, taunting me even more. 'Poor. Poor Harry. Dead. Just like your parents. Like your poor mother dead from saving you.'
She waited for me to nod my head before continuing. "I'll start from when Draco found us in the forest."
I didn't know who threw the first punch, but suddenly my fist was slamming into his face while he plowed into my stomach. Blood surged from his mouth as I gagged from the pain erupted from his hit. We stumbled apart for a brief second to catch our breaths before diving back at each other. He threw his body weight behind the fist that edged closer to my face, it hit my jaw with such force, that blood pooled into my mouth, pain erupted from the point of impact. Stars burst in my vision but I shook it off, blinding throwing a sloppy kick. He stepped back, easily evading the kick.
"I'm sorry" I offered with nothing more to say but those words.
' I am happy for Harry.' She said as she dances gracefully around me, making her long black hair twirl with her movements.
"Draco!" Hermione grumbled. "Burned off a girl's tongue!"
"I guess, the days when I didn't eat much had a bad effect on me." I, timidly, scratch the back of my head. Trying to reason out of what is happening to me. "That's why my body is trying to compensate right now."
"Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, and Ms. Granger. What are you all doing here?" She asked in a surprised tone as if she didn't saw the three of us as she entered the room earlier.
"Harry, Is sleeping?" I uttered in a puzzled state but, that's impossible! Harry, ever since he had been turned, he was never able to sleep.
"Shall we go?" Draco said as he heads outside.
'I can't let you leave now that you're all here'
With a start, I questioned myself - how can I hear so much?
"Then, we will go tomorrow" I sighed with relief. "Thanks, guys"
"The little plain crimson ones won't attack anyone. They will feed on blood but only on open wounds or the ones that are scattered." As Malfoy said this, many relax and breathe out relief. Then Malfoy faced us. "Seamus, to answer that question of yours: Do they have any use except on beautifying me?" He dramatically halted as many laughed and Seamus blushed in embarrassment. "Yes, they do. To prove that, I will demonstrate it to you."
"No." I answered. "Sorry, Hermione but we need to out-run them as fast as we can and this is the only way I can think of."
"Shut it, Ron." Ginny barked as she stood from her seat, making my arm fall off from her shoulder. "I can do what I want to do!"
"Yes," She answered startled.
"I..." Sighing as I try to think of any ideas that pop out of my head. "To be honest, Hermione. I am not sure as well."
A voice with a sing-song tone said. I blinked open my eyes to stare at our room's ceiling, as I am still bunking with Ron. The dim light that is passing through the curtains of our window indicates that it is still early morning, maybe, around five to six o'clock. I slowly sat up and went to find the eyeglasses that I usually set on the bedside table before sleeping but halted. I realized that instead of a blurry vision, I am seeing clearly without them on. What the?!
Malfoy stood there, dressed with a white loose shirt and soft-looking dark brown khaki pants that fitted him like gloves, with his hand holding the stirring spoon and his other hand on his waist, emitting that calm, elegant, and mature aura that looks so temptingly sexy.
"Is that so..." Mrs. Weasley said. "Well, try to eat a bit, Harry. You need it. So you could recover from what had happened to you"
"Yes, it does." Draco's answer brimming with confidence and a smirk appeared on his lips as if he was telling us that 'He was the best'.
I jerk up, awaken suddenly, as the sound of the rustling of the leaves and, a group of footsteps can be heard. Every thought of mine was in high definition as my eyes focus at the entrance of our tent unto the thick woods of the forest of Dean. My heart was pumping, my mind was empty as I was still dazed from being startled awake but my instinct was at its edge. As my head loses its cloudiness and everything became clear. My newly upgraded senses tell me that we, Hermione and I were not the only ones in the woods, right now. I could hear it from the outside of the tent, the sounds of breathing that wasn't mine or Hermione's. I don't know how did they have found us even with Moine's quick thinking that we should set-up a tent surround by concealing charm. I listen intently, as I slowly move to Hermione's sleeping area to wake her up.
Ginny's face came to my mind, clear as a television scene. I saw her frighten eyes that stared at me. Her pale skin as all the blood drains from her. Her cry as she scrambled backward trying to get away from me as far as she can. I remember her disgust. And I remember I smell her fear.
“Harry, are you awake?” Hermione asked through the door.
'That is a dangerous stick'
As the stall opened and Hermione gazed upon my stomach, horror wrapped her face as she suppressed a scream.
"What?!" Ron bellowed as he stood up and stared at us in disbelief. It had been a while before both Hermione and I could stop our laughter. As I took a breath, Hermione was also wiping a  tear from her eye from too much giggling. Ron was still standing with a red and pouting face.
I took a moment to rearrange my thoughts and inhale air and slowly release my breath as I also try to release my nerves with it.
I stared at the cup as I debated if I should take it or decline the offer more gently.
Eat something.
Lavender smiled at me, blushing. "Jade, according to the book, means eternal love, Harry."
"Hoy, Malfoy. Get out. You're not welcome here." Ron stood from his seat as he marched up to Malfoy. Malfoy stood there without a word, a bored look etched across his face as he stared down at Ron. Then a commotion was heard outside.
Chapter 08.  Small Pebbles
"E-Excuse me!" I shot up from my seat and headed out to the nearest comfort room. I almost didn't reach it as I stumbled on the way. Fred and George were already on my side and helped me until I reached the toilet bowl and I gave a heaved. I sank to my knees, feeling weak. Tears begin to form. My throat hurts from the acid of my stomach. My stomach kept churning and twisting. One hurl after another, it keeps coming. Until I could feel relief as all the contents of my stomach were out.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Stop being stubborn, Potter." He said as he pushed me to sit on my bed. "Here, drink this."  He snaps his middle finger and thumb then out from thin air - a teacup with the warm concoction appeared on his hand.
Hermione silently turns towards me. I studied her face, she had dark eye bags and a washed-out expression. I suppose she was still having them.
"Not fair?" He asked in a gruff voice then laughed in a cold and unhappy tone. "When does our world had the complete concept of justice and fairness? Did you not know that you also belong in that particular group - the light."
After we escape from whoever was trying to break into our camp that morning, Hermione and I were able to set-up our tent on another site that perfectly hides us from animals and humans, alike. Under the concealing charms, anti-detection charms, alarms set around the camp, and add to that- the camouflage that both of us created from the leaves, branches, and bushes, I think we'll be safe for now.
Thankfully, Mrs. Weasley took over the situation, since all the males are all frozen in place. "I also would like to apologize for this childish banter on our part"
How in the world should I tell him and the next question is Why should I tell him?
3. Speed (I can run faster than before by Harry) (Around 28 seconds for an approximately 100-meter dash by Hermione)
The cave was enormous and intimidating - with impenetrable darkness at its entrance. No plants grew near it but what surrounds it is a jungle. The black and gray rocks formed the mouth of the cave and stalagmites at the ceilings the floor made the cave look-like a sleeping beast with its toothed-mouth open, waiting for its prey to willing walk inside to be devoured.
Hermione's hand harshly pulled my jacket as she tried to direct me to move but I stayed grounded on my spot that had yanked back Hermione. She slammed her shoulder against my newly developed body. Surprised, she scrambled to stand up straight and look at me as she directed her questioning gaze at me.
As the three started to move out, a loud rumble sounded out. Shaking the ground with ferocity, making us fall to the ground.
She took a step forward and I notice that she wasn't wearing anything. She was truly beautiful with her body- she was lean, had the right muscles, pale and soft looking skin, unmarred, smooth, and flawless. Her voluptuous body, Slender and narrow-waisted, lascivious curves with ever nooks and corners. I admire the body but I couldn't desire it instead I fear it.
Then a taste of pleasure as blood and flesh explode in my mouth. Satisfying my hunger and emptiness inside of me.
"What?" Surprised by his question, I flinched and raised my head.
After all the classes ended that day, Ron and I walked back to our dormitory. Changing into a more comfortable attire and out from our uniforms. Both of us went down to the common rooms to do our due assignments. We found ourselves a table near the fireplace and started our divination assignment coming up with different predictions for the upcoming month. After an hour, we made small progress although our table is full of scraps of paper full of symbols and bearing symbols.
Then he lookup. I saw something in his eyes. Despair, hatred, and pain. Hatred in the whole world. The despair that I could understand very much. I felt compassion at the pain that Malfoy is feeling.
Professor McGonagall turned to us and pointed at the couch in the corner of the room to let us sit as they discussed. Silently, We sat down to wait for our turn. It could be over soon. Knowing Malfoy, he might complain that he is being treated unfairly or he did something to a Gryffindor that had caught our head's attention.
"I guess even Gryffindors do get sick, too." He spoke after a while with his arrogant tone.
I stared at the white ceiling of my temporary room as I recalled the whole day. After finding out my chosen and specific food which is magical creatures it also includes wizards and witches in the menu, ('Horray!' I screamed sarcastically.)  the rest of the day was spend on re-evaluating my skills. so far, all of the previous data was still the same except for my regeneration ability, according to Hermione, I healed 5 times faster than an average human being.
"Then, tell me, Hermione. What will you do if you ever meet Corner again?" He asked with a wide smile that was too far from a kind one.
"Yeah, me too." I sighed as the mixed emotion inside of me unravel. Ron is my best friend and my brother. We are brothers not by blood but by the bond. His family had become my second family. We have been together through all the struggles and dangers, that is why I couldn't possibly know what should I do or how should I feel about Ron. When it was easy for him to push me away. Should I understand him because I might really endanger his family and even Hermione or should I see this as a way of his little faith and trust in me as one of his best friends? I guess I'll find out sooner or later because I am certain that Hermione and I can't stay hidden forever. And when the time comes that I really need to present myself to my loved ones once again, I will have to face them on how will they react. Will it be acceptance or rejection? I realize that I fear that confrontation more than death itself.
"What it is, Hermione?" Angelina asked as she went beside Hermione to peek into the said notebook.
"Its confidential, Ginny. I can't tell you." Mrs. Weasley had laid down the bacon that was newly cooked in the serving plate, with a great sigh. " I just wish that it will be solved immediately."
"Why?" I didn't answer her but instead asked her back. I have no idea what is her intention. Yes, I would be beyond than happy for the gain of clear sight that I always wish for but this my demon, the one who had been torturing me for the past three weeks. A gift like this is never without a consequence.
Blue crackling like tiny lightning started to emit around my body as I snarled in anger. "Don't touch him!" I charge without care, as I was fueled by anger and at my hand, I whipped out my wand and gritted out a spell, "Fiendfyre!!!"
I can smell it, like rust and salt.
Confound by the overbearing pain in my stomach - like a bottomless pit that is aching to be filled. Terrible pain, constant, grinding. I seek to relieve it. I seek food -anything just to alleviate the hunger that I feel.
"You have researched well, Granger," Malfoy spoke suddenly as he strides toward us with his amused smirk that didn't touch his cold grey eyes.
Trying to calm down my instinct, I kept myself from fighting the chains but instead settled down to sit up as I tried to gaze upon Hermione, now my only friend. "It's alright, Hermione. I understand."
"Come. Join us." He said as he walks off towards the gargoyle.
"What was that, M-Michael?" I breathe heavily. "Weak? I think not."
I took a deep breath and brace myself. "When I eat raw meat. That's the only time, that the food had some taste in it."
"Hey," I uttered.
-----------------------------------------
"Percy should just marry his Boss" George grumbled as soon as Percy disappears.
"That's a Gulon," Hermione said as her eyes enlarge with disbelief as she continues to stare at it.
"Hell!" I answered with a grunt. "Surprise that I am in control for the first time but still disgustingly hungry."
Seeing his calm but the concerned face, some of my anger faded. I was able to calm down. "What it is, Malfoy?' I said in a gentle tone.
As the train doors opened, We gathered and left the train. Unaware, I started to search for the pale blond hair in the midst of the thick crowd but couldn't find him.
She told me, that it was not my fault.
"I didn't see any creatures or trace of a nest, Professor," Hermione said. "But I saw a graffiti or runes of some kind."

"But this is our last clue to where Sirius is," I argue with them.
'STOP that! I am not going to die. I have to live.' I screamed with all my might.
"Stop this Mr. Potter. This is immaturity!" Alastor Moody bellowed as he marched up to me with a wooden leg.
"You better be!" She giggled as she pretended to scowled at me then walk away. Ron stood between the door and the bed where I laid. As he can't decide if it's okay to leave me and go after Hermonie or should he stay with me as a good friend.
Shaking, I inhaled deeply and realize that my every encounter of the house-elves that I tried to save clearly fear it and I am angry with my ignorance and arrogance. Now, I know what was Malfoy was talking about. I was only seeing the light side, My own point of view.
Some reacted immediately upon hearing the food of choice of the butterflies. The girls that were lingering close to the bottle, backed off a yard away. Some took out their wands in a ready stance. But almost half of the Slytherins were relaxed and didn't made a move or flinch like they already know about it.
Snickers and whispered voices came about from Michael's group as they're eyes that look over me, are watching with much judgment.
"The queen is evolved? in what way?" I asked, out of curiosity.
"What is this? Acting Hero even towards a prospect Deatheater." Michael growled and made a rude gesture at me. "Becoming dark now, Harry. What can you say, you're showing now your true colors?"
"Better?" I asked, reaching out for the strayed strand of her hair and tucking it under her ear. As I did so, she blushed, adoringly, making her more beautiful. She seems had forgotten her own question as I raise one of my eyebrows to urge her to continue but when she didn't say anything. I smirked at her.
My entire body moved by instinct as I run in front of Malfoy and caught the raging Michael. I tried to shove him off with all my strength but instead, I was brought down with his weight. I can hear all the cheers and the egging from the boys and the shout of protests from the girls for us to stop. As I fell on the ground, Michael made to punch my face. His fist hit my jaw with full force that made my head sway and swims.
'I... I don't know anymore what to do. I am lost. I need... I need help. I don't want to do this match. I just want to... stop this! I need a break. Hang on there! Hermione and Ron are still there by your side...' I muttered repeatedly inside my head as I stood still in the midst of my teammates. It was a good thing, that all of them were nervous that even the twins: Fred and George, had not noticed my weird behavior.
The Gulon, it was still following us as its smiles in glee and giggled like a hyena. 'One...Two...Three...' It sang as it pounces onto us. Even with its size and weight, it still manages to glide with agile in the narrow tunnel of the cave, not hindered by the stalagmites and rock pillars. It could morph its shape to enter any small spaces.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
We had a productive afternoon that day as we actually listed down and summaries the things about the possibility of what creature I may have become and the list of the observed abilities that I have again. Hermione jots it down on a long parchment- written with remarks on parenthesis. I took it to re-read it again, not wanting to miss anything.
'A wish that won't come true.'
"Let's find something to break this...thing off you, Harry" Hermione declared with so much conviction.
"Hermione, good morning," I called out as I sat across her, leaning against another tree.
Sighing, I surrender in with their sound arguments. I followed them obediently out of the room, in which I am staying in, going down the stairs to the kitchen. Upon arriving in the kitchen, the warm aura and wafting smell of the cooked meal spread throughout the room, reminding me of the warmth that I have missed from the Weasleys' home. The kitchen itself was not grandiose, unlike what I have imagined that a Malfoy would own but it was still elegant, the walls were made of fine white wood while the cabinets and cupboards were made up with light brown pine wood, the floor made of white stones and, tables and chairs made of warm brown Narra wood. On the stove, a steaming pot was being stirred by a small being that was trying not to fall-off from the high chair, it was standing on.
After everything had calm down, Draco had invited us, Hermione and I for an early lunch since I had already woke from my sleep. Hermione also wanted me to be immediately fed upon my waking.
Fear clogged my throat. I have gone too far. This dangerous! I should stop it now. Malfoy is much like Hermione. Intelligent enough to puzzle out my current condition. The relief that I had just felt, disappears immediately. Instead panic replaces it in my chest.
"Malfoy-"I try to argue but was cut short as he raises his hand towards me.
Chapter 16: The Slytherin and The Gryffindor
"Harry?" Ginny called out beside me.
Hermione was about to answer my question, as her mouth opened to speak when a very familiar voice sounded out from the doorway.
Hermione shook her head at us - as Ron and I sat to catch our breaths. Pulling us to continue our run with her panic look on her face - Ron and I oblige her request.
"I'm sorry." I can only offer an apology. I heard a sigh from across the room, I fidget as blood drips from my hand.
"I see. The mongrel has the audacity to spew unbelievable things about you and his even trying to elicit the sympathy of the general public." He said with disgust in his voice. "Basic tactics. Boring..."
Ron sat heavily, rolling his eyes to us. "Your welcome. Glad to be comic relief to the both of you." He grumbled. "So as you were saying 'she spoke'?"
"With all of these happening to you, what are you planning to do?" He clarified as he set down his cup and face his whole body towards me. Giving me his full attention.
"I am..." I whispered. "...not sure."
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Still nursing my head, I stood up as I glared at him.
Hermione was also flabbergasted as her mouth was wide open in shock.
Grimace started to invade my face as I heard his words. "You forgot Ron, Malfoy. He is still Harry's best friend and Ginny, who is his girlfriend. Also, there are many more who are friends and who cares for Harry." I retorted.
"But an insult towards My family, especially to my dead brother, Lucian is not something I will never let go." He continues with much hostility in his way of speaking. "Ms. Vane repeatedly flaunt to everyone, to me on how my brother's death had happened. On how Lucian was a stab to death by a group of muggles and left to die in the woods. On how before his death, he was-"
"That's good and all but that doesn't explain why are you tampering with my food," I said, still confused with the whole situation.
"She can eat flesh." Malfoy murmured. The others started to back away again in fear.
"Mate! Red eyes. Then it could be Voldermort, again, giving you nightmares! Except for this time, he using a girl. That's really disturbing!!!" Ron abruptly stood up and walk towards me as he laid one of his hands on my left shoulder. "We have to tell the Headmaster."
Gulp! Here goes nothing!
"I will start with what had been reported to me. Mr. Malfoy, you are accused of inflicting injury to a fellow student, who is in Gryffindor, am I correct?" Professor McGonagall asked.
"I might have an idea of what creature he had turned to. Judging from his behavior as well as the physical signs that he was showing but..." he stopped in the middle of his sentence.
"Sexual way?" He teased as he leaned closer and slowly breathed over my ear, making me, shivering in anticipation.
"I agree," Ron said as he also was tired and bored.
Oliver said in a grouchy manner. "Suck it up, Harry. It is for our team's win."
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Harry," Moine spoke in a hard but warm tone at me. "I want you to listen to me, calmly and don't let your emotion best you."
"Huh," I replied like an idiot.
"So... care to share your thoughts?" Hermione asked as she took a sip of her chocolate drink.
"Yes, Mom." Smirking as I lay down on my bed.
"Hello," She said. "Just done a bit of reading"
'Yeah, like a boar' My demon came intruding in my mind.
Why me?! A question that I continue to ask to no one, over and over again.
He remained silent as he stop-midway his steps. "For what?"
Malfoy stood there with his wand, contemplating and trying to come to decision. Minutes pass by so slowly, then finally Malfoy's expression changed into something else.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Why?" I asked him after a minute of processing his suggestion. Him being generous so suddenly is hard to take in for me.
The hair on my skin raised as a premonition of the danger of that action, by instinct I avoided the hit as I skid to the other side.
My heart was like a wild animal that was running at 100 kilometers per minute as I began to feel dizzy while my body is burning up. I trembled with excitement and almost growl with my growing arousal.
"PUT ME DOWN." She said in anger."THIS INSTANT."
Little that I know that these were the start of my upcoming doom and I wasn't ready for it when it finally came at me.
The voice said. As another quake shook and the ground under Hermione began to crack open. Hermione screamed in fear as she started to fall between the cracks on the ground. Being near her, I jump towards her then grab her hand but the shaking of the ground was too strong, making me difficult to maintain my balance and to lose my grip - the only way to save her was to pull her out with my strength and then throw her against my weight but as soon as I did that - I will be the one to fall into the pit that had formed.
I just wish we can reconcile with each other, after all, I still love her and she loves me.
Her face turns red again from embarrassment. Then I slowly bowed my head to her face as I did so. She tiptoes and closed her eyes waiting for me. I let my lips touched hers. I felt a chill travel around my body as we kissed.
I started to wander will my suffering ever ends. Sometimes, I wish for any beast or creature in the forbidden forest to just end my misery but alas, they seem to avoid me in fear that I might feast on them in my burning hunger.
"I understand." I finally said as I had processed everything in my head. "Thank you, Hermione."

Then she slapped me across my face. Hard.
"Geez. Thanks, Hermione for the whole work-up." I sarcastically murmured as I gave her a sardonic smile.
'It is a nice day.' I thought
"Hmmm.." Malfoy took a moment to think. "It could be their use. You know, to beautify me." He said sarcastically. "But that would be too much, right?"
A drowsy silence lay over us, as it continues to rain. The grass that spread over the forest's floor was once emerald green had turned to dark green - almost black as they drown from the water from the rain. Deprived by the sun's ray, we retreated to our favorite past time, listening to the old radio that Hermione brought along her. The radio aired the recent news in the wizardry world, once in a while would pop out some interesting topics, that's how we spend our whole morning until out of nowhere in the middle of advertisement - breaking news was announced.
Then a roar was heard - like a lion with a bark of a vicious wolf. I saw it as it had reached us at last. From where the tunnel that we came from was ahead of a dog with the cat's ears and eyes, along with three horns on the top its head was peeking - as hideous it was and frightening - it was nothing against its expression it showed when it finally saw us. Its face turns into a gleeful look - eyes that held hunger and absolute happiness as its mouth warp into a human-like smile and inside its mouth were three rows at the upper and another two rows of razor-sharp teeth at the bottom part. I held my breath as chills run up and down my body. I could move from my spot along with Ron and Hermione.
The next day as the sun starts to rise, a small ray of light was able to pass through the gape of the tent's entrance - the ray of light-filled my face with its warmth, waking me up from my slumber. It had been 4 days straight that the rain poured, denying us of the heat and light. It filled me with happiness to finally have a bit of the sun. As I stood out from my bed and change my clothes, I went over to Hermione's bed to find out she wasn't there anymore. Sensing some movements from outside and smelling her scent, I assumed she must have awoken earlier than me. I slowly went outside and shield my eyes from the sun's ray as I was adjusting to the brightness of the daylight. Walking more, I soon spotted Hermione sitting against a tree as she was reading some thick book.
"Ehmmm.." I hummed in agreement.
“My. My. Hermione, I won’t even suggest it. If, I didn’t know how to. To answer your question. Yes, I do know-how and to answer the other question: where. We’ll just have to find them, right?!”
A fire rose as the flames formed a shape of a giant serpent, its mouth was wide open as it swooped down the running hobgoblins enclosing them within as its fanged pierced them, one by one until there was no more of them. Their screams please me as I laughed like a lunatic. I watched the flames roaring and burning the surrounding trees as well.
The hobgoblin beside Draco chortled in triumph and grinned evilly as he raised his club for the kill. My blood boiled and anger flowed within me as I saw Draco was in grave danger. I gave a ferocious scream as it tore from my chest and run out from my mouth. A kind of sound, which I might never able to make if I were still a human, startling the creatures as they turned towards me. They made a guarded stance as they were alerted by my presence. I stood tall and straight as all my fear and hesitation disappeared that instant. Replaced by energy waiting to burst out, as I growled in an animalistic way. The remaining hobgoblins realized that there was something wrong as they slowly back step away from us.
As if inspecting me, he took his time searching through every feature of mine then he grabs my arm and pulled me towards the bed.
My answer is...
I just want to grab his hand and start drinking from it. Next, I will bite the flesh, pulling from the gap then chewing the -
'Well, if you want something. I could make it happen.' she teased me. 'You just have to ask.'
Deep, seething hatred.
"Who are you?" I shouted as my voice also echoed throughout the cave. "What do you mean Grim? Is Sirius is here?"
"You do look horrible, Harry" Hermione observed as she sat across me. "I think you should go to Ms. Pomfrey. You have been acting weird lately." Then she added in a hushed tone.  "It's been weeks since we met the Headmaster, Harry. Are you still having the nightmares?"
"But?!" Ginny's hysterical voice sounded out. "BUT WHAT?!" I can still feel her hands gripping my right hand. She was desperate and her tears keep on falling onto my knuckles.
I suddenly felt the urge to kick his ass. That evil thought came to me again.  My desire to make him bleed. To kill him. Shit! I hate HIM. I want to hit him. I took my fist and balled it. I took a swing making it hit his stomach. As I hit him, he shouted with pain. Coughing as he couldn't recover from my punch. He wheezes on the side as I took the opportunity to stand up and back away from him. As I did so, I tasted blood in my mouth as his punch did cut the side of lips. I spilled the blood on the ground near him.
“Yes, I’m up!” I answered. “Let me change first and I’ll be out.”
But the look on the Headmaster and Professor McGonagall gave away a clue that the locket was not a simple one but indicated it was important. "Once I found out that she took the locket of inheritance from me. I went to find her and demanded that it be returned, immediately. Not understanding the importance of this locket to my family nor me, she spoke back at me that it should belong to a beautiful LIVING person and not to a DEAD one. So, I cut off her disgusting tongue."
Hermione walked up beside me and murmured something.
With her faces still ablaze, she cleared her throat, trying desperately not to be affected by my words. And Hermione was failing to hide it. " Anyway, I already showed those things to you, yesterday. Your quite late for the praising," She teased me.
Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher and the head of Hufflepuff house, a squat little witch who wore a hat over her flyaway hair, was also with a deep conversation with professor Hooch, the flying instructor, who had a short, grey hair and yellow eyes like a hawk and Professor Trelawney, who teaches divination, is a thin woman with thick glasses that magnified her eyes and was drowning in her shawls and cloaks and bangles.
'I want...I want to live.' I trembled.
"So. What is your plan, Harry?" He asked.
Message: I am so SORRY for the delayed update. Writer's block. You get them once in a while and I have been doing other things to inspire me.  I am thankful for my small collection of novels and the music on the internet to be my source material for inspiring me. So let's get on with the story...
Professor Minerva McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor house had come to guide us into the Great Hall. She was a tall, black-haired witch with a stern expression, who always wore her favorite emerald green robes.
Chapter 13: Blood And Flesh
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred and, revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
"Yes, please do, Hermione," I said as I am intrigued.
That comment about me 'becoming dark' hit me harder than I have expected it to be. Something within my chest boiled and my entire body shakes with fear and anger. Fear for the possibility of being discovered and lastly, anger for his hitting near my insecurity and accusing me of being evil.
He entered his room and as close his door, he smirked at me in a confident but erotic way.
'Oh, I just hate seeing through your eyes with those hideous things. I just have to fix those iris of yours. There are no visible changes. So, stop with that panic look.'
"I think we should bring you to St. Mungo, Harry," Mrs. Weasley said as she approached and appraised my ashen face before handing me a glass of cold water.
“Yes, master, with pleasure.” Tiffany bounces from her sit as she was in the middle of her biting her bread and zoom towards the sink near the stove, coming back with a plate big slabs of meat semi-cooked to Draco.
Headmaster Dumbledore coughed behind us, stealing our attention. Blushing, the three of us, turned to him.
"Harry, stop making out with my sister." Ron grumbled at us he made a face, discolored by green tint. "It's really disturbing for a brother."
"And what is about me, Weasley?" A cold voice said.
"Ever since that incident, both of us." I pointed at Hermione and then myself. "We were having nightmares. Am I right, Hermione?"
'Harry' She called out once again, with a different tone - gentle and kind. I know that it was only to trick me.
"Bring it back, Malfoy or I'll knock you all over!!!" Michael shouted with vigor, panic is written all over his face as profuse sweat pours from his body.
"How about your friends, Harry?" He asked again. "The others? Professor Lupin? Sirius, your godfather?"
A dark brown hair boy walked forward with so much confidence, picked the hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.
"Harry!" Ron called out of nowhere. I immediately snap out into attention as the call, wake me up in my daydreaming. I look around to see if I miss anything, I saw Ron flying towards me.
02. Enshroud by the wicked
"Let's move Hermione to her room." He said casually as if he didn't just make me feel like a hundred butterflies are flying inside my stomach. "I'll bet she'll complain of back-ache in the morning if she keeps sleeping in that position."
"Mate! MATE! HARRY!" Ron's recognizable voice bellowed as he too came near me, he must have been kneeling above my head as his sweaty scent, a mix of pumpkin and meat, tingle my nose. "Professor, he was healed already then why?"
As if the human girl had understood that it was no avail to hinder me with words, she runs. As fast as she can. But not fast enough to out-run me. I leap with force as I run after my prey. I can imagine it now, how the blood would flow - spurting and gushing as I bite and tore the flesh on her neck. I snicker in excitement and anticipation. Then the human girl turns and waves the stick in her, shouting: "Petrificus totalus."
I could feel it again the heat all over my face and my body as embarrassed as I am. I am grateful that both of them are making the effort to cheer me up.
Ron snarled and took off, as he shouted Corner's name in rage, Hermione cried at my side while Ginny wailed as she started hugging my body.

"Draco!" "Malfoy!" Crabbe and Goyle also shouted, desperately and in panic.
"What?" He blinked at me with genuine surprise.
"I'm still unsure," Neville said.
"What do you mean by BASICALLY, Malfoy?" Hermione took a stand as Malfoy's statement intrigued her.
Ï wish I could just ask Hermione what to do. But then, again that would be a bad idea. I could just imagine Hermione recommending a book to me, which is entitled 'How not to fall in love with your ex-rival.', right?

------------------------------------------------------------------
"Ms. Granger." He said in a bitter tone as he looks down intimidatingly at Hermione. "Do I need to remind you not to run along the hallway? Apparently, even being the brightest witch in your year, you were not able to learn the simple rules in Hogwarts."
I open my mouth and took a bite. Heaven. That's the word that entered my mind as soon as the flesh and blood entered my mouth. Bite after bite, my consciousness slowly returns to me. I was becoming aware that I was eating Malfoy's hand and he offered it to me, with no fear in his eyes or disgust. Even though, I vaguely remember his conversation with Hermione, his eyes that were watching me as I feed was my only concern. That emotion that he was showing had hit me so much that my eyes unwillingly let out tears.
'I guess you'll do'
This is confusing and frustrating.
I already scolded myself for feeling this way and I am weird out with myself when I know that Draco was just going back to Hogwarts. I could still see him in summer break or maybe in the Christmas break. If he could spare a bit of his time to see us.
"But?" I asked impatiently.
I tried to separate myself from the pain. I tried to enter the darkness to lose myself in the black world. Where no pain greets me. But my body wouldn't obey my will as it forces my mind into reality - I trembled as I was forced to wake up.
Ugh. Why do I feel like a lovestruck fool?!
"Where's Remus and Sirius?" I asked as looked around.
I don't know why but I want the owner of that scent -to be hurt. Be killed. I turn in that direction. What I saw was a male in blue sports gear, desperately trying to hide from me. I have chosen him. I made the stance to spring, as I am to hunt him down.
And it's all coming back to me - realizing my nightmares and my fears.
Seamus' face turned red in anger but he just kicks the dirt towards Malfoy.
"Why would I?" Malfoy answered back. "I have all the right to evoked a lawsuit against her in the ancient ways of the old wizardly law."
"Captain Wood of the Gryffindor," Malfoy called in his most regal tone. He waited for Oliver to turn his head to pay attention to him as the rest of the team started to arrive.
"Go on" I urged him. He seems to have gotten my message, hesitantly, he slides towards the door. "Are you already alright?
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is hope and love. You have been warned!
My whole world started to twist in a strange and dark dimension. 'Dead, who? Me? It can't be! I can still hear them. I am still alive.'
Please release me and just let me die.
Hermione and I couldn't go back.
"What creatures are we in for today?" Ron asked as he looks suspiciously around for any cages.
The hunger was bewildering.
You look awful, Harry" George said as he sat near us in the Great hall. We were all eating for breakfast that morning before our first class. Well, to be exact, They were eating while I was trying to eat, putting all my effort not to puke.
'I need blood. I need flesh. Let me eat! Eat!'
His arms that I held up as soon as they were released, enclosed around my neck, and then he whispered to my ear, "Please continue, Harry."
Only Hermione was my ally now.
Hermione gasped as her eyes widen with realization. "Maybe, the cave that we accidentally entered before is an ancestral burial, Harry! Pureblood family with magical creature inheritance!"
It was Michael Corner. I still remember his face frozen from the terror that came and had taken his life, mouth open from the screams - blood oozing from his body, that was brutality torn apart. But the one that had me, shaking from fright and guilt was his hollow eyes that were staring blankly at me.
"Dragon!" Hagrid surprised with the prospect of seeing his long-time dream pet cried out. "Wha' Dragon?"
Eying for a good measure, he started to swirl the content of his cup in a rhythmic manner, I can see a calculating eye.
I shiver.
I sighed. I can't keep doing this.
"Gosh, Draco! Your still a brat." Hermione gasped as she jokingly smacks Draco on his shoulder. "Come on, just say it."
It was a male. His white - silver like hair covered his face. He laid a hand on my demon's head just as he did with Sirius' hand, that morning and said in a voice that I am very familiar with. "Go."
'Just Great!'
End of the previous chapter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I obediently laid down on the bed. Still unbelieving of the events unfolding in front of me, I slowly slip into a dream state as I saw him leave the room.
"Well, Harry had just added a new category in his type list just recently," Hermione spoke confidently that I felt all the alerts going off inside my head. I tried making signals at her to make her stop from saying anything nonsense about this topic.
Thus, my suffering continues. A never-ending cycle of burning, agony, and pain.
"Your welcome," Hermione said after she took a spoonful of her soup.
A knowing look! Wait! Does he have a clue what is going on? He seems to! Oh my god!
After thinking for some time, I finally come in terms. "Please, help us. Malfoy"
"Hmm... You right. His actions are very unusual but I have a theory for that." She said confidentially.
"Prick!" Ron muttered as he was looking at Corner, glowering, and glaring.
Another voice came with a hint of spice and smell of dry pages of books. "HARRY, please don't leave us. Wake up!" It was Hermione.
Suddenly, Malfoy's face turned serious and stared at me, with much intensity. "To eat what?"
'Life is good'
I shiver.
"But before that, Tiffany please take the things from Granger. She might drop it from shock." He said in an annoyed tone as he took a glimpse at me. "And Granger, pick up your jaw, would you?! This is becoming a habit of yours."
"Thanks." I took the cup with both of my hands and took a long sip. As take the hot chocolate it warms my body as it passes by my throat to the pit of my stomach. I release a sigh of relief.
"Here, to put you in a good sleep." He grabs my collar and pulled me as his lips closing in on me.  This time, my heart beats with so much more force as his tongue licked my lips as if asking for permission to explore inside of me. I, gasped in shock as my eyes widen and saw him looking at me with a smothering look, with a pink hue under his eyes. Draco took his opportunity to enter inside my mouth when I had gasped and as his tongue touched mine, ecstasy runs through my body and my toes curl in bliss.
'Well, that's about right' I couldn't help but agree with her.
Raising one of his eyebrows, Malfoy spoke in a deadly serious tone.  "Explain."
Disclaimer: This scripture was based from the characters and scenes from the astonishing novels: Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling, and as an aspiring writer, I have no rights and claims to these fantastic novels but I dare say, what I only own are the ideas in this tale: HUMAN
All the time.
"Your welcome, Hermione." He spoke in an uncertain voice.
"Malfoy, I don't mean to rude to you but is it really okay for you to have a house-elf eating with us? No offense. I am okay with it but for you as a Malfoy to..." I asked but gradually losing words to describe what I am actually seeing.
I blushed as I heard him then I just cleared my throat but didn't deny his accusation. He seems to like my silent yes to his question as he smiled brightly at me and slide towards me, making it that no space was between us.
"It's good to see you, too" Remus muttered as he encircles both of his arms around me.

5. Appetite (Not an ability, Hermione!) (Harry, stop it with the comments) (Raw animal blood, Raw animal meat and needs more information by Hermione)
_____________________________________________________________________
"You're telling me to calm down when Sirius has been missing for THREE MONTHS! THREE MONTHS!" I snapped at the Adults, who were under the Order of the Phoenix. "And they did not even tell me once!!!"
Even though my situation is very dire, I was able to laugh at Hermione. Then Hermione joined me in laughing our worries away.
"Yes!" I answered back, making a little jump.
"Ah...Well, they left me with no choice, so I run for it." Hermione blushed as she sheepishly twirls a bit of her hair.
"Harry." Hermione spoke for the first time after I have started running with her in my arms as we were trying to escape the Acromantulas that are still chasing us. "Are you all right?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
Sighing as I walk across the Gryffindor's common room, towards my friends, wanting to clear my mind. I sat beside Ginny as I took my notes ready to distract myself. Potions really take up your time, much to my chagrin with our Potion professor.
"So much for the mighty Potter! HA!" He sneered as he hit me again on my chest. Pain erupted as his fist made an impact. And another one hit me. "Weak!"
English is not my first language and this is my first fanfiction, so please be patient with me. I haven't found someone that could help with the editing.
Emerging the dark woods, nine figures came with grunting and with their clubs. One of the hobgoblins, was leery over us as he held his enormous club high up then settling it over his shoulder with confidence and glee.
I turn to my side as the sound of whimpering captured me. Ginny stood there, shaking. I slowly walk towards her - knowing that she might understand me but I stop from tracks as she started to step back and fell to the ground, screaming in fright. "NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!"
I squinted as the brilliant light from the sky had almost blinded my eyes and yet, I felt no pain from being dazzled by the sun's rays but instead the pain in my stomach was unbearable as it catches all my attention, leaving no other room for any other thought.
Hermione was still standing in-front of me with her hands stretched out towards me, wary and determined - I froze, appalled of what I was about to do, and what was I doing.
"Cut-off, Hermione." He answered back with a calm tone.
After, what seems to be an eternity of waiting, Draco finally looks at me and chuckles breathlessly. "Do you still want to kiss me?"
Sighing heavily while rolling his eyes, he made an expression that looks like 'I am talking to idiots.' He turned to the Ravenclaws as well. "I think it will turn better for anyone, especially to your team, Corner."
"Hey, you two! What are you doing inside the comfort room?"
"A success on what?" I asked as I was trying to understand them,
"What in the world would you suggest that?" George asked bewildered.
It was so delicious!
Hermione and Draco could not see very well like me but at least, Draco brought two pair of his enchanted dark vision goggles for them to use. They also held their wands with their dominant hands.
"Harry, are you okay?" Hermione asked as her face morphed into a concerned one.
I am overwhelmed and captivated by this man.
"I wish we could forget the outside world. Stay as we were." Hermione muttered as she flips the pages of the book without actually reading it. "Grow old, the three of us. Together."
Message: Thank you for staying in tune with my story and if I am bothering you with my style of writing, I am sorry.
I grinned back at him. Really Ron is always hungry.

I am already at the end of my wits as I am finally admitting to myself that I am officially aware that I am attracted to my ex-rival.
'or is it really?' A female voice spoke.
'Wakey wakey... I have a gift for you'
"Yes. Alice's Domain." I repeated. "That's the place."
So I run - I scrambled to the second floor and to get my broomstick.  Somebody called my name I think it was Hermione but I could not care less. I climbed out of the window and ride away on my firebolt as fast as I can. I didn't care where I was going. I just flew - fast and hard. All the different techniques in the broom, I just did it all. My knuckles turn white as I gripped my broom too hard and gritted my teeth. I allowed the wind blow my face, the whistle of the harsh wind deafened my ear and the pain in my muscles erupted from the strained of being abused - swallow me whole - calming me from my head to my toes. I emerged from my rage and I slowed down my fly. Having the anger dissipate from me, I felt nice and free. I was calm.
"Harry!" Hermione came. She was trying to enter the crowd as she elbows the twins with much strength. Her face was still worried but yet she was grinning as she was captured by the happiness that had erupted in her housemates. "Congrats."
"I guess you can tap in your modified magic core now, Harry." He said casually. "Which makes me wonder if after the creature you are becoming  might be from an inheritance after all."
She tapping her left foot as she was patiently waiting for more while her hands were so busy with the plant that we were fertilizing.
----------------------------------
"I said 'Let's go.' It getting rowdy in here" She said with a peculiar expression on her.
"That's good" Remus smiled. "Sirius is very worried about you since you never talk about these things with him"
"Helro, Harry!" Hagrid bellowed, waving cheerfully as spotted me. "Ar all right'?"
"BOMBARDA!!" I shouted as the spell blast the said beast.
And yet I have to survive this or should I say that fate just won't let me die.
Hermione looked up from her work and must have seen the disbelief in my eyes. She started to giggle. "I know it's hard to get used to it. Seeing him like that. Believe me, on my first day here, I was also too shocked to move when I saw him being nice to his house-elf and cleaning the house, voluntarily." She smiled at me as her gaze returned to Malfoy as he was now stirring the hot pot of soup instead of his house-elf while the house-elf started to open the oven and took out the freshly baked loaves of bread.
"Come you all, These little buggers can't harm you." Hagrid chuckled with good nature than for a minute turn to Malfoy with a bit of doubt. "Right, Mr. Malfoy?"
"Sit down, Draco." He said in the most gentle tone that I have ever heard him speak.
Unwilling, my body started to shudder and there was a heavy feeling in my chest, so I gasp out for air and as it filled my lungs, the scents hit me hard - Hunger, that was the first thing I could think. A rumbled came within me, like a snarling wolf. My mouth filled up with saliva and my teeth sharpened. I don't know what was happening to me but I know that I am hungry and their food out there to eat.
I tensed myself for the first leap and my muscles bunched in preparation. The hunting instinct and yearning to eat ruled me completely. I singled-minded took off and landed on the prey as it screams and scrambled away from the sharp nails of my hands. The hunger got worse, it was so painful as it erases any other thoughts and conquers my mind to end my hunger as it urges me to take a bite.  My hands held him down by his neck and my mouth opened in anticipation as I brought it, near the nearest flesh. I was suddenly alarm by the presence that was behind me. The pull of my hunger and the irresistible scent of my prey warred with the impulse to defend myself and my intended prey.
