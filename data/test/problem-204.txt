“Then you break, and there’s a variation to the usual pattern for a set. It’s more like eight beats for two movements in one set—but you’ll see. Both partners, moving to face opposite directions, 1-2-3-and,” Draco made the slow turn that had been depicted in the garden statues, ending up halfway around the circle he was dancing, glancing over towards Harry. Merlin, he hoped Potter’s mystified expression was only due to Draco’s grace, not the steps themselves. Though that was flattery he doubted he deserved. Without missing a beat, he continued revolving around the circle through the third and fourth movements of the set, returning to his original position.
“So… Want to teach me some ‘proper dancing’?” And something about the thought of getting to see Potter making a fool of himself at something Draco knew well did sound almost fun.
“That’s a relief,” Harry said with a grin that made Draco’s chest ache to look at, “I thought maybe you still didn’t like me.” Draco couldn’t say anything to that. He let his eyes fall down towards the decaying leaf litter, soft beneath their feet, and continued down the sloping path that led into the edge of the forest that populated the valley.
The bed was warm from Harry’s body heat, and the harp was playing quiet and sweet on the bedside table. The room was full of the rich, soothing aroma of the incense, and the tea and calming draught flowed through his veins, easing his muscles and gentling his thoughts. His wand was within sight on the bedside table, and at his side, Harry gave a gentle groan, and burrowed into the pillows. “Night, Draco,” he said.
“Probably a ferret,” Draco said darkly, remembering in a flash the pain and humiliation of that transformation in fourth year. Harry snorted with laughter.
“I used to go to a few every summer,” Draco mused, meandering around the perimeter of the courtyard to scorch a few weeds climbing up the low hedges, “But no, not anymore. Not since the war. You can’t tell me you don’t get invitations. You must be swimming in them.”
wanted the truth—not when it came to things like that. “You can’t just let it alone, can you? Or come to your own conclusions, at least? How do you
Harry shrugged, trailing Draco around the statues at a distance, looking out over the deep green of the garden. It should have been bright in all seasons, but Draco had failed there as a steward. At least Potter didn’t have a basis for comparison, and it did still look alright. Just freer. Wilder. “If I have, I haven’t opened them,” He said, “People I don’t know send me letters all the time. I got sick of reading them ages ago. I just chuck them now. I don’t want to become the new Gilderoy Lockhart.” It was at once so absurd and so like Potter to throw out invitations to the parties of influential people that Draco laughed. A real laugh, and not even one that came at too high a cost for Harry. That had to be a sign of just how desperate he was for human contact. Potter just grinned back at him, though, before nodding to a spot of the empty courtyard. “That seems like a decent place. Let’s get started.”
“Okay. So, what you have to do is think of something that makes you feel safe and happy. Something that reminds you of how good life is, and how good it will be in the future. Something that fills you with hope or love or joy. And the stronger the thought is that you can summon up, and the better you can focus on it and let it warm you up, the stronger your Patronus will be. It will be easier now than it will be when you actually need it, since you’ll probably been scared then, but the more you practice finding that thought or memory and focusing on it, the easier it will get. So, just take a minute and try to find the strongest happy thought you can,” Harry said. Draco stared at him, thoughts churning for five silent seconds. When Harry just looked back at him, Draco finally opened his mouth.
“And she’d have an idea of where to start researching, even if she hasn’t,” Potter pointed out, and finally Weasley looked away from Draco and towards Harry.
They finished the set off-beat, and with the song starting to end, but Draco didn’t want to cut Potter a break just yet. He was having more fun than he’d expected to have, watching Harry butcher a dance. Draco let go of him, and Harry’s look of mild surprise broke into understanding as he let his hand drop from Draco’s back, “Oh right. The turn thing.”
“It got away again. Turned into smoke,” He said, smoothing back his sleep-mussed hair, “I didn’t even cast a spell, this time. It just kind of dissolved. And then this hit the floor.” Harry held out Draco’s wand. Well, that part was unexpected. Draco started at him, before slowly extending a hand to take it back. The wood of its handle was as warm and comfortable as ever against his palm. So, the thing had, indeed, stolen his wand. That had not been part of the trick. Could it really have cast a spell, then? Dark creatures rarely needed external foci to channel their magic. They were usually potent enough as it was. Perhaps it was all part of some twisted game to torment him—killing him with his own wand. Brow furrowed, Harry joined Draco on the bed, fiddling with his own holly wand. He was shaking, ever so slightly. “I saw what you did again, I think. It looked like you, but older and wrong. It seems like it doesn’t change shape for me, only for you,” He said. Draco wet his lips; his mouth tasted vile. Absent-mindedly, he tapped his wand to his cheek and murmured a tooth-cleaning charm, before summoning a glass from the en suite, and conjuring a stream of water to fill it. He drank long and deep, until his insides felt cold and clean, before noticing that Harry was watching him with a curious light in his green eyes. As their eyes met, Harry managed a small grin, “It’s like you’ve got a spell for everything.” In any other situation, Draco would have been flattered. In that moment, he could only store the compliment away for later, and refill the glass before offering it to Harry, who took it and drank, too.  Draco’s hands had steadied, and the wavering of the water was the only sign that Harry wasn’t quite back to normal.
“The balance of probability is never in his favor,” He said, “But I don’t know what you’re referring to, specifically.”
“Like I said, anytime I get asked to do something like that, I ask myself if Lockhart would do it, and if he would, then I don’t,” Harry said, and stepped out into the hallway, looking both ways into the dark, “Where are we going?”
Drifting through indistinguishable night and day a week dragged into a month, and one month multiplied to two. His mother’s letters kept coming of course, and he answered them, and occasionally Pansy would come to visit and criticize the state of the furniture or the shine of the silverware, but for the most part little changed. The house seemed to slump lower and lower in its foundations, but Draco stopped caring. There was no one around to impress. The library was unbearable these days, but Draco didn’t ever really feel like reading. Mimsy kept on cleaning, and the food looked as nice as ever, but even if it hadn’t, he didn’t think it would have made much difference. Nothing appealed to him, anyway. Mimsy fretted and tried to ply him with little glasses of mulled wine and mugs of thick, spiced drinking chocolate. She put warming pans in his bed every night, slipped tonics into his bath, and would sometimes leave a particularly nice and freshly pressed set of his robes hanging on the hook in his room in a way she must have hoped was enticing. Sometimes Draco would even force down the drinks or put the robes on, just to stop her from peering nervously at him for a little while. But he was never in the mood for the drinks, and he had nowhere to wear the robes to. Nowhere he wanted to go, at least. He was only waiting. For what, he wasn’t sure. For his parents to come back, though their stay in France didn’t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon. Until everyone had forgotten about him, maybe, however many decades that would take. Or perhaps for the house to give up and swallow him whole, subsume him into the peeling wallpaper and stained grout. It was all fine, all good enough for him and more than he probably deserved. So, Draco let it continue without any further intervention—until the Boggart.
"He sent an owl when he thought it was a Boggart!" Weasley said, "He definitely can't cast a Patronus charm."
“I apologized, obviously. Extensively. I told her that this was her home, and I was happy to share it with her; that I valued her work and was sorry if I had appeared ungrateful. I was fairly certain that she’d despise the suggestion in the first place, but after Dobby, and after Granger had been right about so much else, I thought that I should extend the offer,” Draco said, exhaling a slow, deflated breath. Beyond that, too, he’d been ashamed of his own condition. He hadn’t wanted any more witnesses to his disgrace. “That put her in a good mood straight away, and she’s been incredibly doting ever since. I’ll tell you this, house elves aren’t shy about showing when they’re displeased with their situation. Everyone could tell Dobby was miserable. Mimsy was upset when I suggested she might prefer to be on her own, and punished me for my insolence. You saw how the Black Family house elf responded when he felt he was being pawned off to an unworthy wizard. And surely Granger received some form of complaint from the Hogwarts house elves during her campaigning?” Harry laughed at that.
“You mean to tell me,” He began slowly, “It really is that touchy-feely? I’ve read books that mention the charm, of course, but I had no idea that was all true. I thought it was just sentimentality around a romantic charm, or some sort of thought exercise or something.”
“I like winding you up,” Draco said, smoothing back his silver hair, freshly clean under his fingers for the first time in a week.
“Right,” Harry said, “D’you want to stay behind me or stay here?” He could barely breathe, and didn’t trust his legs to support him, much less move him in a straight line. And that was before even facing the thought of the wand-bearing wraith in his bedroom.
“Yeah. You too,” Harry said as he sat up, eyes glittering, and caught Draco’s mouth in another kiss before yanking his shirt off over his head. Draco shucked off his own shirt, tossing it across the room before dragging Harry back into their breathless embrace.
“You’re an Auror, not a groundskeeper,” Draco said, but apparently Harry didn’t care about that any more than he did getting wet feet or risking a fall on the slick rocks. He just kept wading deeper.
“Hey. Hey,” Harry said, voice still quiet but bright with laughter, “S’alright. Come on. That’s not the first time I’ve had a dick pressed against me, and I hope it’s not the last, either.” The sound Draco choked out was halfway between a laugh and a groan, but the opportunistic part of him had made a gleeful note: rumor confirmed. Potter wasn’t straight. He opened his eyes to level what he hoped was a withering look at Harry, though it was very early in the morning. Harry just looked back with a face full of honest curiosity. “You know, Draco,” he said, “It’s like you’re so smooth and poised until you do something a bit vulnerable or foolish or embarrassing, and then it all goes to hell, and you start acting like a wet cat.”
“I might be able to find someone to take you up on that,” Harry said with his familiar brand of firm, obnoxious confidence, “Come on, Ron.”
Clutching his belly with one arm, breathless with laugher, Draco managed to wheeze out, “Is that what I looked like, to you?” His stomach muscles were starting to ache, and his eyes were tearing up with the delightful madness of Harry spinning around and around on the spot like a figure in a music box in Draco’s sitting room, trying earnestly to get his approval. He swooned against the chaise lounge, letting his laughter ease gradually. Dabbing at his eyes with his sleeve, he looked across at Harry, who was surveying the room, smiling still but looking nonplussed.
Despite the tea and water, and his now twice-cleaned teeth, Draco’s mouth went dry all over again. “I wouldn’t want to impose,” He said, scrambling for anything to say that would save him from sounding desperate for company and comfort against the terror of his own bedroom.
“Exactly, you got something,” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder with a strong, warm hand, “That’s brilliant! Now you know you can do it. It just takes finding a better memory and getting in the right frame of mind. We’ll get there. Now come on. Give it another go. Just to get a feel for it.”
There was a long moment of still after Weasley disappeared from the fireplace. Draco stood, watching the green flames flicker and die, very aware of Harry standing a couple yards away, watching him. When he looked up to meet his gaze, Harry had a quizzical expression on his face, and a little furrow between his brows. “Do you want someone to explain the Floo Network to you?” Draco asked with a saccharine smile, taking refuge in the familiarity of the rivalry he’d one shared with Harry. Except this time, instead of making some sharp retort or glowering back at him, Potter only gave a snort of laughter and shook his head.
“I know the history of my own house,” Draco said, scowling, “There’s not a single record of anything like this happening in any of the estate’s records. One thousand years of pristine accounts I searched through, and this is unprecedented.”
“Yeah? You’re sure about that? He wanted you dead for years. He acts like something other than scum one time and—”
“I wouldn’t say no to one,” Harry said, cracking a smile, “Just don’t tell Hermione. I’m meant to be trying to wean off, and practice meditation.”
“Mimsy, could Auror Potter and I each get a calming draught, please?” Draco asked the air, and ten seconds later, wearing a floral pillowcase as a nightgown and a deeply concerned expression, Mimsy appeared with a pop in the guest bedroom with a calming draught in either hand.
“I never could have imagined you taking cock so well,” he’d murmured, just able to catch the corner of Harry’s mouth tugging up into a smile, “But you’re taking mine marvelously. You torture me to no end, do you know that, Harry? Even good at this. And who had the audacity to put you in those dragonhide trousers? It’s not
“Merlin. It hasn’t looked this good in ages,” Draco said, standing up to take a turn around the room, sliding his fingers over the dust-free lid of the piano, “It wasn’t like this when we came in, I’m sure of it. I would have noticed.”
“I wouldn’t ask you to. Sounds miserable, what you’ve been feeling. You should definitely eat,” Harry said. Poached salmon in white wine sauce over pilaf and roast vegetables in a balsamic glaze followed the soup, and while as he’d predicted, the portion sizes were notably smaller for Harry than they were for Draco, Harry stalwartly refused to swap. “Listen,” He said, gesturing with a Brussels sprout speared on the end of his fork, “You got though all the soup okay, didn’t you? If you start to feel sick, I mean, stop eating. But I promise, I’m fine! I ate loads for breakfast this morning. And being well-fed will probably help you with the Patronus Charm.”
“I mean, I can’t promise I’ll fix it,” He said over his shoulder. Knee-deep in water. Thigh-deep in water. The opalescent fish diverted their courses to avoid Harry’s legs without a ripple. Trapped on the shore, Draco crossed his arms and watched. Potter had always been a meddler. Even when it came to other people’s fountains, it seemed he couldn’t help himself. Harry stopped when he reached the deepest part of the pond. Water was lapping at the hem of his fine red jacket, and Draco was sure he could detect a shiver in his voice. “About here?” Harry called, and Draco nodded.
It was Harry’s turn to laugh. “Alright, alright! Sorry. Something with your family, then. You can’t tell me you’ve never been happy. I don’t believe that.”
“They’re pretty,” Harry said, touching a fluttering blue-tinged leaf, “Are they useful for anything?”
“Rubbish,” Draco said, even as he cut his fish, “You don’t expect me to believe that, do you?” He raised his eyebrows at Harry, who nodded.
“Yeah,” Weasley said, without conviction, and with one last suspicious glance over his shoulder at Malfoy, he was gone again in another burst of green flame.
“Yes,” Draco said, taking a few steps forward to singe a tendril of ivy that was climbing out of its bed, tickling the feet of the wizard, “Fiachra and Quirinus Malfoy. My great-great-great-great grandparents, or something. They were responsible for the last major renovation of Malfoy Manor and its grounds, though, of course, my other ancestors have done this and that to it since then. Their grandchildren commissioned these statues of them. They work in a defensive capacity, as well. I’m rather fond of the piece.”
“No idea,” Draco said, and his fingers drifted towards his wand with a mind to cast a time-telling charm, but Harry was already tugging up his sleeve a bit to peer at a golden, star-spangled wrist-watch.
Weasley shot him a venomous look, eyes narrowed in suspicion, and Draco really felt the calm, sweet smile he gave in response. Potter ignored both. “Yeah, it’s no trouble,” And then, “Come on, Ron. It shouldn’t take more than a few hours. Someone should keep an eye open around here to see if anything else happens, anyway. Go ask around the office. I think someone should know something.”
“Look, Ron, Malfoy hasn’t mastered the Patronus charm yet, and I think this whole thing has something to do with him. Not that he’s causing it,” He clarified as Ron’s eyes widened, “But I think whatever it is is sort of… targeting him. It responds to his emotions. It picks up on his fears. I’m going to stay here to investigate and see if I can find out anymore. It’s the best way to investigate this case.”
“I have first-hand accounts of what an excellent teacher you were in fifth year,” Draco reminded him. He was almost positive Harry flushed with embarrassed pride. Merlin, he had to stop that.
Draco tried again to open his mouth, or to scream, but his lips only parted a fraction, his breath catching in his throat. He was suffocating. He was surely going to die for want of air, if this dark beast didn’t kill him first. As though reading his thoughts, Draco’s mimic drew a wand out of the sleeve of its motheaten robe and brandished it in its hand. White and spidery. So much like the Dark Lord’s hand. “Little weasel,” it said, voice threadbare and dusty, “What are you doing in my bed?” Draco’s lungs forced out a breath of mist. He twitched a finger. He was going to die. He was seconds from death. He had been waiting for eons, but the precipice was terrifying. “Little weasels don’t belong here. There is no room for pests.” The weight on his body was lessening, though it was like being dragged up from an ocean trench. He clenched one fist, and felt a tear spill from the corner of his eye and down his cheek. The doppelganger lowered the wand—Draco’s wand—until it hovered above his nose. “Don’t cry, weasel. It’s pathetic, and it won’t save you.”
“Oh yeah? Kreacher—the house elf who lives in Grimmauld Place with me—sent me maggots for Christmas the year after Sirius died. So, what did you do?”
"'Feels like there's maybe something here'?" Weasley echoed, "This whole place is a nightmare. I was more asking if you thought this was a trap or something. It feels horrible here. There's got to be something wrong with--ah!" Draco's heart squeezed tight as a fist in his chest.
“If this is your way of comforting me, Potter, you’re doing a rotten job of it,” Draco said, curling his lip. But he didn’t move away. Harry heaved a great breath.
“I’ve felt that way,” said Harry, “And Ron and Hermione. Lupin. Fred and George. Dumbledore. McGonagall. Snape, too. And I know they all have, because they’ve produced Patronuses, and that’s what you have to draw on to do that.”
“Do they have—” Draco began, before realizing that, against all odds, they were almost certainly here in response to the letter he’d sent yesterday. Why would they send Potter out on a minor errand like banishing a Boggart, partner in tow? Unless, of course, they wanted to check up on the ex-Death Eater and the Malfoy Estate at the same time. Draco sighed, tossed the paper aside and rose. “Show them in,” He said, “I wrote to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement yesterday. Tell them I’ll be down in a minute,” He paused, wrestling with his old grudge against Weasley in particular, before adding, “They have the hospitality of the estate, if they want it. Tea, coffee, a bite to eat. Whatever they like. I may be a little while. And try not to look so horrified, Mimsy. Potter will think I’m abusing you and engineer a way to set you free.” With a full-body shudder, Mimsy disapparated.
“A variety of koi. Imported from Japan, I believe. I don’t know, really, they’re at least thirty years old,” Draco said, “It really isn’t that nice, though. The fountain isn’t even working.”
you. Good riddance, obviously. But they were her family. Understandable that she’s still protective. And I’m sure she’s heard only terrible things about you.” Harry looked troubled, and Draco hid a smile in his cup of tea. All the better that he could pry his eyes away from Harry. Draco had heard nothing of the Aurors’ physical training regimen, but someone must have been prodding Harry into doing something strenuous, because people had to work to get chests that looked like that.
So Draco started playing. Once the piece, long as it was, had been second nature to him; he could have played it blindfolded, or while keeping up a conversation. Now, even playing it more slowly, enunciating the rhythm so that it would be easy to dance to, it took concentration. Still, the piano itself remained lovely as ever. The notes flowed rich and clear from its body and filled the room up with the light, sweet song. Once he’d begun, it came more easily, too. His fingers remembered most of the old movements, and within a minute, the piano was almost playing itself. And then a minute later it was playing itself, obeying his modifications to the written piece, and Draco removed his hands from the keys “There we are,” Draco said, smiling at the look of surprise on Harry’s face as he stood from the bench, “The piece is a long one, and there are three more of Léandrés’s works for it to continue on with if it finishes. That should be enough to give you a basic grounding, I hope. If we were being old-fashioned, we’d be using each other’s wands. If we were being utterly medieval, we’d be using our own wands—”
“Do you like being sad and bitter, is that what it is?” Harry asked, holding Draco’s gaze like a bear trap with his own.
Draco broke the surface. He took a choked breath of air and threw up his arm to knock aside the wand before throwing himself bodily from the bed. His hip and elbow hit the ground hard, but Draco could barely feel it. Through the wall, a muffled shout told Draco that he had just startled Harry out of sleep. Dizzy with panic, Draco’s hands scrabbled at the wood as he rolled onto hands and knees. “Just sit still, weasel. I’ll take care of you,” said the creature behind him, and Draco stumbled over himself, hit the door, “Avada—” Draco threw the door open and lunged sideways out of view of the door into the pitch black of the hall. He was running, vision gone grey at the edges. He caught himself against the next door, his sweaty palm slipping against the polished brass doorknob.  After a precious second, the latch yielded, and Draco fell headlong into the room, gasping for breath, every muscle shaking. He lurched, hand flying to his hip, at a touch between his shoulders, but within a moment he recognized the source of the touch. Harry had wrapped an arm around Draco, and his wand was drawn and trained on the open doorway.
“You’d be surprised,” Harry said, and finally looked away from Draco. That was enough to puncture his rage but left him buzzing still with a dulled sort of electricity. He didn’t know what to say to that. Potter was confounding without even seeming to try. Harry took another deep, slow breath, and then nodded towards the hedges. “Come on. We’re not getting anywhere right now. Want to show me around the gardens for a bit? I’d like a walk.” And for reasons Draco didn’t entirely understand, that didn’t sound like the worst thing in the world.
“Right, so… Let’s get started with the lesson then, okay? Sooner we get it done, sooner it’s off your mind. I’d sort of like to do it in the house, so I could keep an eye out for that thing,” Harry said, and Draco, with effort, managed not to cast a nervous glance over his shoulder. Harry seemed to guess at his apprehension anyway, “But, err… maybe it would be easier for you if we started off outside? Since you don’t seem very happy with your house right now.”
“Pleasure to see you again, Weasley,” Draco said in tones of perfect civility, glad when Ron grimaced at him, “I’m sorry to keep you waiting. I didn’t expect the Ministry would send someone so promptly. I hope Mimsy made you comfortable.” Harry set down his tea and stood up. He was wearing his full Auror uniform too. Horrible thing. Much too trendy, with its dragonhide trousers and sleek, asymmetrical red jacket. It had clearly been designed with Harry and the members of his student militia in mind. It was a complete abandonment of tradition. But as much as the color of the jacket clashed with Weasley’s hair, the uniform did wonders on Harry. It made his skin warmer, his hair blacker, his eyes brighter with the contrast. Looking at the gold and jet buttons on the sleeve, inches from Harry’s hand, the way the cut of the jacket brought attention to the squareness of his shoulders and drew the eye to the clean line of Harry’s jaw, Draco was sure that if the uniform had not been modeled on Potter himself, at very least the designer had been referencing a full-body picture of him while creating it. Merlin, the trousers were pandering, plain and simple. Draco redirected his attention to the safety of the bridge of Potter’s glasses.
Malfoy Manor was wilting. It had started slowly. Draco had been walking through a corridor on the first floor without purpose or destination in mind when he’d noticed a curve in the arm of a wall sconce that he hadn’t seen there before. In fact, all the sconces in the hallway had it; a dejected slump. Just a lapse in his knowledge of the Manor, he thought. After all, it wasn’t as though taking careful note of the wall fixtures had been his top priority in recent years. Maybe an original had been damaged and couldn’t be repaired or replaced for whatever reason, so his parents had bought all new ones that happened to be a touch more dismal. That was all the thought he gave to it, at first. Then the doors had become uncooperative. They swelled in their frames, stuck and warped and scraped across the floor, hinges complaining. Draco had sent Mimsy, the house elf he’d inherited from the Lestrange Estate, after them with a jar of powdered Shushabye root. But, they only developed a new habit of slamming closed when he left them unlatched, or opening slowly to let in draughts. Then there were the curtains. Draco had meandered, barefoot and clinging to his housecoat, into the larger of the two formal dining rooms, only to see Mimsy daubing frantically at the curtains. They had shriveled. A dull brown discoloration had eaten into the rich gold brocade curtains, climbing nearly a third of the way up their length.
“So—” Harry began, and Draco’s eyes flew towards him, yanked suddenly out of his wandering thoughts, “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you. I was just wondering, where do you want me to sleep, while I’m here. I’m not picky or anything. Just curious. On the sofa down here?”
Still chortling, Draco aimed a non-verbal cleaning spell at the table, followed by Harry’s shirt, and finally the carpet. “Alright there, Potter?” He asked, once Harry had slid his bowl back to where Mimsy had placed it and sat down.
“I’m not afraid of Malfoy. I think he’s sorry. I think he learned better. We already talked about this ages ago.”
“And then?” Draco asked, looking over Harry’s shoulder towards the piano, still playing the sweet melody, to spare himself the butterflies he was guaranteed to feel if he looked Harry in the face right now. He could enjoy this moment and hold himself together at the same time.
“Absolutely. Go on, Ron,” Harry urged with a touch of exasperation this time, and Weasley frowned, but stepped over the grate.
Draco gave her a cool look as the teapot floated off the tea tray Mimsy was carrying and poured each of them a cup of fragrant Darjeeling. A silver tower of dainty finger sandwiches and French pastries hovered to land at the center of the small table. He lifted the china cup to his lips and took a sip. The tea, at least, was as good as it had ever been. It smelled like a flower garden after a rain and tasted like a soft spring evening. “Hardly,” He said at last, but then a bit of helplessness slipped out without his permission, “I have no idea what’s the matter with it. Nothing I do seems to help. It’s only getting worse. I’d write to Mother about it, but I don’t want to worry her. She has more than enough to cope with already.”
It had been a while since Draco had felt a nice, purging wash of loathing directed at someone other than himself. He hated being looked down on. He hated it even more when the derision was well-founded. His smile and voice were still fixed to the gold standard of civility, "I'm afraid I never mastered it, no." At least that particular charm was not part of the Hogwarts curriculum. He could feel a little less foolish for not having learned it.
“Do you think she liked me pouring soup on myself?” Harry said as Draco shepherded him towards the stairs, “She definitely seems to hate me less than she did before.”
“Yes…” He said haltingly, looking away from Harry. At the fireplace, at the gardens, anywhere but at him, at an utter loss for words. He had no guidelines to interact with Harry in this context. Potter finally cleared his throat and rumpled up his hair.
. Draco was considering how ‘not bad’ things were going when Harry put his free hand boldly on his hip. His gaze jolted up to Harry’s, as though expecting that Potter was making an odd joke, but of course he wasn’t. Harry was looking at him with all the innocence in the world. “Wrong spot, Potter,” Draco said, and Harry frowned.
“About the house,” Harry said, nodding at the sad curtains and the windows, which had become increasingly opaque, week by week, “Is there really something the matter with it?” It would have been a relief that someone, at least, didn’t think anything of all the Manor’s glaring defects if it hadn’t been such a horrible thought that this is what Potter believed it was meant to look like. After weeks of staring at it and despairing over it, watching it grow worse and worse, as though it was rotting around him, with Mimsy in a tizzy no matter how many times he told her he didn’t think the state of the house was a statement on her work ethic. Considering what his parents would say if they saw it now, what his father would say—and maybe that was even optimistic, since his father hadn’t said a word to anyone since shortly after his trial. It had become an unbearable place, yet somehow also the only place Draco could bear to be, even though it seemed intent on driving him out with Shades and Vampiric Moths and now some unnamed horror… Draco gave a high, humorless laugh; a manic substitute for tears.
“Holding your own wand implies you think you might have to use it,” Draco explained, “Warring clans or families. All that rot, before we handled disputes in court for the most part. Holding your partner’s wand is—well, it’s not chivalrous, exactly, but… Give me your wand.” Harry handed it over without hesitation, clearly nonplussed, apparently unconcerned. That was not at all the reaction Draco had been expecting. Draco gave it a quick flick in the air, feeling the magic of the wand—eager and unfamiliar, brash—in his hand, and looking back at Potter. When there was no change in his expression, Draco went so far as to send a burst of blue sparks gushing from it. But Harry was still just standing there, looking confused.
The air had a hearty wetness to it—dirt and verdant life—and Draco breathed it in. The stagnant air of the house still felt stuck in his lungs. He cleared his throat, brushing out the cobwebs. Harry kept kicking at the leaves as they walked. His boots were looking dirtier by the second. No wonder Potter was almost always a mess: even if he started out in something fresh-pressed, clean and perfectly tailored, he couldn’t leave it be. Anything in proximity to Potter, he mussed. Draco shot a hard look at Harry’s boots and suppressed the urge to shoot a cleaning charm at them. Eventually they came to a pond tucked into a cleft of the valley, with a rocky shore and a slow brook feeding it. Algae grew green on the pebbles at the bottom of the pond, and the still places furthest from the brook’s mouth were choked with waterlilies. It certainly needed some looking-after. But the Silver-Leaf Willows at its bank still draped their trailing branches into the water, and great, pearly fish swam languorously in the depths. Potter looked… impressed. Which said more about him than the state of the water gardens, Draco was sure.
“Whatever you want, honestly,” Harry said. And the warm look in his eyes was nothing short of an invitation. In a rush—before he could think better of it—Draco had half thrown off the blankets and rolled up, onto his knees, grabbing the back of Harry’s head to drag him into a fierce kiss. Harry’s hair was thick and soft in his hand, and in his eagerness, their teeth hit painfully. But Draco couldn’t let himself relent for a moment. Their lips moved together, and Draco tasted the warmth of Harry’s tongue against his own. Stress, embarrassment, and months of sexual frustration found some escape through the shuddering groan that Harry made against his mouth as Draco dragged his fingernails down the back of Harry’s neck. There was a deepening color on Harry’s tan cheeks, and a wildness in his eyes that Draco felt mirrored in the eager beating of his own heart.
"So, it's gone for now," Harry said when no one else spoke, "We're not sure what it was, though. It definitely wasn't a Boggart." That much Draco had gathered from the conversation he'd overheard.
“Well, yeah. I do okay,” He said, grinning at Draco and rumpling up his hair again. Damn, damn, damn.
“Can’t you do anything about that, Mimsy?” Draco asked, staring listlessly at the floor of the drawing room, which had adopted a greyish tinge.
Mimsy’s thinly veiled displeasure that Harry would be staying the night was balanced by her delight that Draco was asking for dinner. 	“It doesn’t have to be anything special,” he said, though her eyes were gleaming with discomforting brightness, “Soup and salad, or something. Don’t trouble yourself.”
Draco stopped a few feet away from the bolted sitting room door and gestured towards it. “It’s in there,” He said, keeping his voice level, though the thought of so much as opening the door, even with two Aurors at his back, filled him with dread, “It’s in the piano, actually. If I could trouble you not to damage it—it’s an antique, you see. Priceless.”
“It was just an idea. Okay. Your mum loves you a whole lot. And you love her, right?” Draco had no idea where this was going.
Draco gave an inelegant snort, “Potter, the Manor hasn’t lost its guest rooms: you don’t have to kip on a sofa. You can take the room next to mine. It hasn’t been used in quite a while, but I’m sure you’ll find it agreeable enough.” That way, too, if something did try to kill him in the night, at least Harry wouldn’t be able to sleep through it peacefully.
"I dunno, Harry," Weasley said, sounding dubious, "That's the sort of thing you'd hear about, isn't it? I hope it's not something new." Draco opened his eyes as Weasley and Potter, both looking a little greyer than they had a few moments ago, walked out of the sitting room. Weasley looked stunned: Potter, perplexed.
“—if you’d heard of it you wouldn’t—” They were shouting at each other, struggling not to stumble over words in the jumble.
“It might be close enough to fool people who don’t know me, or care to,” Draco said, dragging his fingertips along the rumpled comforter, “It started to cast the killing curse on me. I ran before it finished. If it’s capable of spellcraft… I don’t understand it. Why it’s here. Why it wants to kill me, but seems almost indifferent towards you. The Ministry all but tore up the floorboards, stripping the house of all dark objects and artifacts of esoteric magic, so I don’t think I could have activated a curse in that way.”
“I is not knowing, Master Malfoy,” Mimsy said, patting more Gilfrey’s Gentle Silk-Safe Stain Remover onto the once-bright fabric, “It is not me doing it.”
They made their way back down to the ground floor and into the Manor’s great hall. A tortoiseshell box of Floo Powder sat on the mantle, ready for just such an occasion, and Draco gestured at it. “Help yourself,” He said blandly, and Weasley gave him a look like he’d just called him a pejorative name. He probably didn’t enjoy being given permission to do something by Draco—probably wanted to prove he didn’t need it. Still, Weasley did step forward, pop open the lid of the box, and grab a fistful of powder.
“Draco’s a decent dueler,” Harry said, looking suddenly uncomfortable in his tight dragonhide trousers and sleek coat and leather dueling gloves, scratching at his ear, “And anyway, err... Look, Ron, it’s alright. I’ll be fine. I want to do it. If things get really bad, I can just apparate us. It’ll be fine.”
“Oh… I’ll eat that in a moment,” He said, waving a hand. Harry set in gleefully on his own fool, and Draco watched with perverse delight as Harry licked custard off his spoon; grey eyes soft, face relaxed, “Tell me—how is the whole Auror thing treating you?”
He threw the powder down, said, “Ronald Weasley for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,” and was whisked away in a burst of green flames.
Draco woke slowly, sleep clinging to his mind. He was cozy and comfortable, though it felt as though the night must have killed the fire in the grate, and the room beyond was colder than he would have liked. Through his eyelids, he could see sunlight, and he turned his face away from it, into the pillows, determined to remain in his lovely daze. The bedclothes were all scented with the sweet smoke of incense, and he was curled against a warm body. His cock was hard, as it so often was upon first waking, and with a lazy tilt of his hips, he pressed it forward, granting himself a little bit of friction and pressure. A low heat of arousal simmered under his skin, but Draco wasn’t really ready to wake up yet. A small voice in the back of his head told him that he didn’t really want to regain his wits, and he believed it. Better not to wake to harsh reality. He was drifting through a dream; basking in sensual pleasure.
“Is Master Malfoy wanting anything? Mimsy could be making a trifle for him. Or perhaps a pigeon pie?” She said, pointedly putting her back to Harry.
“Don’t move the place—” Draco cut himself off with a laugh. His advice had come too late. As fragrant curried carrot soup had appeared in his own bowl, a considerably less generous amount appeared in the spot where Harry’s bowl had been and splashed onto the table. The sleeve of Harry’s dress shirt was splattered, and Harry gave a small yelp of pain, snatching away his hand.
“What is this tosh you’re spouting?” He asked with the clearest possible enunciation, “That’s not what life is like at all, Potter. That’s not how it is for people. If it was, everyone would be skipping along the streets with pockets full of wildflowers, singing at the top of their lungs.”
They walked a few dozen feet to the open space, and Draco turned to look at Harry, arching one pale eyebrow. He had no intention of showing Potter that he was curious about how he’d conducted his defense against the dark arts lessons. “Okay. We don’t have to bother with wands for a minute,” Potter said, back seeming a bit straighter, shoulders set with a confident firmness that Draco hadn’t noticed a moment ago. “It’s not like the incantation or the wand movement is tricky at all. The hard part is—I know there’s not a Dementor in your house, but you know how Dementors make you feel?” Draco nodded. As much as he’d given Harry hell for his reaction to the Dementors their third year, he hadn’t been immune then, any more than he’d been spared when they drew close to Voldemort, trailing him and his followers like perverse shadows. “How do they make you feel, then?”
"That's okay. Do you want me to teach you?" Potter asked, and for all the world his smile looked legitimate. Weasley and Potter then proceeded to get into a discussion, which devolved quickly into an argument, right there in the corridor.
“Okay… Well, do you have a good imagination? Could you tell yourself you’re going to banish the thing in your house, and it’s going to feel fantastic? You’ll have your home back. You’ll feel safe and powerful. It’ll be brilliant.” Harry was talking like a particularly enthusiastic quidditch captain—one who believed in the power of positive thinking.
“Weren’t you listening?” Draco asked, but he couldn’t help but smile. Oh, he relished being better at something than Potter. And Harry happened to be rather charming when he was confused. He was also charming when he was self-possessed, and incandescent with loveliness when he was angry or brooding. It was difficult for Draco to think of a time when Potter didn’t look his own personal brand of scruffy-beautiful. Draco was hopeless. And in terms of the lesson, so was Harry.
“I did, but there was a lot of steps. Forward and backwards and revolving and counting. And this bit was just at the beginning. Was it the waist? No—” He slid his hand to Draco’s back, and Draco gave him a small nod, putting his own hand on Potter’s shoulder. Through the dress shirt, he could feel Harry’s warmth, and a firm bulge of muscle. Merlin, he’d filled out nicely since becoming an Auror.
“Thank you, Mimsy,” Draco said, not failing to notice the tiny turn towards Harry that Mimsy had performed during the last sentence, “I’ll call you if I need you. And thank you again for an excellent dinner.” With a curtsey and a pop, Mimsy dissapparated--presumably back to her bedroom.
“You don’t mind, do you?” Harry said, though he’d already walked forward and was ankle-deep in the water, “Just thought I’d take a look, since I’m here. Where is it? Right in the middle?”
“Right,” said Harry, though nothing about his tone of voice inspired confidence. But then, maybe Potter was a visual learner. Draco pressed on, more to give himself something to focus on than anything else. Right arm curled around an imaginary partner, left hand to the side, Draco glanced at Harry.
To his credit, Harry did start on the correct beat and with the right step. With the song swelling towards its midpoint, Harry adjusted his hand on Draco’s shoulder, and stepped forwards, if not confidently, then at least correctly. Draco usually led, but he’d followed now and then too, and matched Potter’s step backwards with an equal one of his own, a gentle turn. The second step—Draco moved to step forward, just as Potter also took a step forward. They crashed together, chests and noses bumping, Harry trodding on Draco’s foot, and then a roll in the carpet, catching his balance just in time, though nearly dragging Draco along with him. “Ouch,” Draco said, hand flying reflexively from Harry’s shoulder to clutch at his nose. It didn’t actually hurt; he realized a second later. It had only been a little bump. Harry’s glasses were askew as he righted himself, looking concerned. He set his glasses straight and took a step closer, peering at Draco’s face.
“I swear I’ll dismiss you from the—” He spoke louder, trying to drown out Harry, but Harry raised his voice, too.
“Of course I am. That wasn’t the point,” Draco said, holding the wand out to Harry, who wasn’t over-quick in taking it back, “It doesn’t make you feel vulnerable, not to have it with you? It doesn’t make your skin crawl?”
Draco watched, silent and growing queasy, as Weasley and Potter walked to the sitting room door. "Alohomora," Weasley said, jabbing his wand at the handle, and the latch clicked open. Draco leaned back against the wall of the corridor, feigning disinterest as he looked back towards the stairs, but acutely aware of the two Aurors strolling through the door in his peripheral vision. "Bloody hell, look at that thing," Weasley said, sounding disgusted, and at first Draco was sure the Boggart had revealed itself, until he continued, "What kind of person owns a gold piano?" Harry, at least, only chuckled. "Right, let's just get this over with," Weasley said, "Bestiae revelio." The pause that followed stagnated into uncomfortable silence. "You think he was trying to trick us, somehow?" Weasley asked, but there was a tension in his voice that sounded like uncertainty. The air was alive and hungry for heat. Draco closed his eyes and gripped tight to his wand.
“I suppose we should have some music, then,” Draco said, staring at the piano with some mistrust. There was nothing quite like the thought of your parents’ dead bodies crammed into the frame of an instrument to make it unappealing to play. But the room didn’t have the same menacing chill that it had suffered with the other day, and Harry was watching him with thrilling curiosity, so Draco seated himself at the bench, fingers stroking the conditioned ivory. It was almost as warm as a living being, itself. He looked at book on the piano’s music rack and cleared his throat, “Léandrés’s
“Do it without damaging the room and I’ll take any Muggle-born witch or wizard who accepts my invitation out for dinner in a public location and give them a personal apology. If you find anyone who’s interested, I’ll be shocked. Even more shocked than I will be if you two manage to deal with the Boggart without causing property damage.” Weasley looked venomous and ready to retort, but Potter grabbed his shoulder.
Weasley puffed up like an angry cat, but Harry cut in before he got a chance to make a retort, "Don't worry, we're going to look into it. Do you have anywhere else you can stay?" For one moment, Draco imagined admitting to Pansy he was desperate enough to need to sleep on the couch in her studio apartment in Diagon Alley.
“No,” He said dismally, “And if this is all my fault somehow, for being miserable, then why didn’t happen sooner? I’ve been miserable in the Manor since You-Know-Who started popping by for Sunday roasts.”
“Isn’t it a little early in the morning to fight me? We can just settle back down and relax for a bit.”
“I’m certain my father’s abuse didn’t help,” Draco said dully, remembering with no small amount of shame how happy he had been any time his father’s anger found Dobby as its target, instead of himself, “Honestly, I have no idea. They have feelings, of course. They can love, and they are quite clever; powerful enough to rival a witch or wizard in a duel. And they can be horribly taken advantage of. But I think what your friend Granger never grasped is that, while they are beings, house elves aren’t human. Not to say that they deserve abuse, or to excuse the way my father treated Dobby, but their motivations are their own. It doesn’t seem a good life to me, but Mimsy turned mutinous when I suggested she might not want to serve me. I offered her the Lestrange Estate as her home, and a monthly pension. She dissappareted and refused to speak to me the rest of the day. The next morning, she served me dead cockroaches in my porridge.”
“You taught them all Patronus charms,” Draco said, grabbing the stem of his crystal goblet and dragging it closer to himself, “Don’t give me that humble rot, Potter. I don’t believe it for a second.” Not trusting his mouth any further, Draco started in on his blackberry fool.
“There’s nothing yet,” Weasley said, and shrugged, “But we’re doing everything we can.” Of course, he could afford to be flippant about it; not even bother to address him. After all, what did Weasley care if Draco was killed in his bed as he slept? “Hermione’s bringing home some ‘light reading’ for me and her to do tonight, so we’ll be working overtime and everything. You can pop by if you want to take a couple books off my hands.”
“I mean, they have us run and do other agility stuff. But I’ve gotten into sport, actually, and been training up for that—going to the gym and everything. Been playing rugby, if you’ve heard of it. Muggle game. Just for fun: I’m only okay at it. But it’s distracting, and it’s nice, having friends who don’t think of anything when they see my scar. The muscles have gotten me attention in the wizarding world that I didn’t really want, though. Witch Weekly wanted me to do a pin-up photo shoot for a charity calendar.”
“The turn thing,” he said, and moved to begin his walk around the circle, only to see Harry perform a sort of lazy pirouette on the spot, holding his arms like a ballerina in first position. Draco stopped, choking out a laugh.
“Well, Potter, I can tell you without question that if what attacked me wasn’t a Boggart, I haven’t a clue what it could be, and I’ve been studying the nature of dark creatures and magic since I was old enough to read. I don’t know what you saw in here, but what I saw surely would have been the form a Boggart would have taken for me. Regardless, I’m not surprised that even Granger didn’t manage to turn something up over the course of a few hours,” He said. Harry straightened up on the lounge, hands clasped together.
Draco studied his cuticles and the shamefully ragged edges of his nails, trying not to show an ounce of the fear he felt as Harry stood up from the sofa where they had been waiting. Maybe he had moved, or given some other, subtle sign, because Harry had not taken a step before he turned and fixed Draco with a long, hard look. Draco remained resolutely focused on nudging the cuticle of his thumb back, face smooth and expressionless as a death mask. He was not going to be driven out of his own home. He would not show fear or weakness. He would press on against the dark as he always had, with a hopeless, tired determination: one step further, one day more, turning through the wash of time like a cog in a clock. He was Draco Malfoy, fallen and ill-favored, but if nothing else, still here.
They started out around the cobbled paths bordered by low hedges and bushes, mostly not in season, rather weedy and in need of pruning, but still lush and lively. Draco pointed out several beds containing St. Gertrude’s Butterfly Bushes, which were rustling too much to be muggle plants, considering how little wind there was. “At one point, they were nearly extinct,” He said, “Almost every one grown today is a descendent of grafts donated by the Estate.”
Despite the unfamiliar bed company and the events that had passed just an hour earlier, it had been a long time since Draco had been swept to sleep so quickly and peacefully.
Draco closed his eyes, torn between frustration and emotional exhaustion. Why would Potter ask for the truth? No one
“I wasn’t trying to insult you. I’m just saying, it seems like it upsets you so much, when it’s only being human,” Harry said, unabashed. Draco’s ears were smarting from the heat of his own blush. That much was true, maybe. Whatever standards for avoiding embarrassment others set up for themselves were worlds away from what Draco’s were.
“Wow, this place is nice, isn’t it?” Harry said, strolling down onto the shore to peer more closely at the fish, “What are these?”
“What? No good?” Harry said, and he did it again, swinging his leg around in a mad attempt at grace, turning his palms out to ask for approval. Draco couldn’t help himself. Potter, for all his skill on a broom and dexterity in dueling, might as well have been a hippogriff trying to dance
Eventually, Harry nudged Draco’s cheek with his shoulder, and gently extricated himself from his arms. Silhouetted by brilliant sunlight, Harry stretched, then turned towards the bathroom. “I’m going to take a shower, if that’s alright,” he said, “Breakfast after?”
“Fuck,” He muttered, pushing himself backwards to put some empty space between their bodies, feeling blood rise to his cheeks. Was it too much to hope that Harry hadn’t noticed? Harry’s chuckle told him that yes, in fact, it was. “Merlin and Morgana,” Draco said, and squeezed his eyes shut.
“I’m a bit of a Boggart expert, I guess,” Harry said with a smile Draco didn’t find convincing, “Are you doing alright?” Out of nowhere, as though that was just the sort of question you could ask someone.
to help himself. Draco crowed with laughter as Harry coughed and dashed water from his eyes, then pointed at the fountain which had gentled into a cascade and declared, “Fixed it!” Only a second later, he clutched at his nose, “Damn, dropped my glasses.” Draco was nearly sobbing with mirth as Harry dunked himself back under the water to retrieve his glasses.
“Malfoy’s not going to hurt me, Ron. If he wanted to, this would be a really stupid way to do it, anyway.”
“Right,” Harry said, sounding no more convinced than last time, “Right… It can’t be that bad, can it? Let’s just give it a go.”
Draco had no expectation that the DMLE would respond to his owl. He expected to have to wait a few days to give them a reasonable time to ignore him before marching down to the Ministry to demand to be seen. He might not have been at the height of British Wizarding society anymore, but he was still a taxpayer. But it was less than twelve hours later when Mimsy appeared with a crack in his bedroom, clutching her ears in alarm. Draco stared at her over the top of the
“Seems great to me,” He said, setting the boots down by the footboard and looking around with what looked like sincere appreciation, “Honestly, Draco, your whole house is so posh that it’s hard for me to see what’s wrong with it. My aunt and uncle would probably find something to complain about, after they got done drooling over the crown molding and the chandeliers and the number of fireplaces. I mean, it seems old. But it is old, right? You were talking about your great-great-great grandparents, or whatever. So I don’t even think it’s a bad thing. Not that I don’t think it should be fixed—” Harry said quickly, as Draco opened his mouth to protest, “But I’m just saying, it looks like something a historical society would care about preserving. So to me, someone who’s never lived here, it looks fine. And whatever Ron was talking about—it feeling bad, or whatever—I’m not getting it. Except for that first attack, I’ve been having a pretty good time, actually.” Was that heartfelt too? A simple compliment to cheer him up? Was he actually flirting? Harry’s eyes glittered, pupils wide in the shadow of the room, “You’re not a bad host, you know.” Pixie shit, he was flirting. Why in the heavens would he do a thing like that? Feeling like a tea kettle about to start whistling with panic rising from his heart to his ears, Draco cleared his throat.
He put a leg over Harry’s waist, reaching his free hand up under Harry’s shirt to feel muscle and a rasp of chest hair against his palm. “Get your shirt off,” he said, freeing his hands.
“So you’ve noticed my fragile ego,” Draco said in icy tones, “Thank you ever so much for pointing it out.”
“Blimey. It’s past four. I was sure Ron would be back by now,” Harry said. The bothered little crease was back between Harry’s eyebrows. Clearly Harry had been expecting Weasley and Granger to work their magic quicker. Maybe Draco had held out hope despite himself, too, because something chilly settled in his guts, and his tongue felt tacky against the roof of his mouth. Aurors and other Ministry employees working first shift clocked out at 5:00 PM. In less than an hour, Harry was going to be off-duty, and but for Mimsy, Draco was going to be alone in the house. The thought of returning to his room and rousing in a cold sweat in the dead of night to face a living nightmare turned his stomach quite sour. He tensed his jaw, holding his shoulders firm.
They drew together again, Harry holding Draco’s hand, his other arm curled around his back, Draco with his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Together they took the first set one movement at a time, with Harry moving haltingly, Draco always anticipating the correct steps and sometimes finding himself offbeat as Harry figured out how to move his feet, his hand drawing Draco forward at the wrong time, but still comforting in its steadiness and warmth.  Forestalling failure in the second part of the dance as they returned to where they’d begun, Draco tilted his head, in the direction of the next step, “Left, then a turn.”
“I’ve already told you I’m alright,” He said shortly, looking pointedly away into the fire, “What more do you want from me?” And that should have been the end of it. But Potter could never just let well enough be; it was what had thrown him into danger, and into the spotlight, so often at school.
“It’s my personality,” Draco said, following a path that wove down the hill on which the Manor stood, towards the orchards full of apple and pear trees, barren this time of year, and the less structured gardens beyond.
Harry began slowly moving around the center of the pond with an odd, shuffling gait, arms held out for balance. After about a minute, Draco got bored of watching Harry muck about and turned away to meander up to the stream instead. A couple late-season dragonflies danced above the water, and Draco squatted down to watch the spill of the water over the rocks. It might not have been well-manicured anymore, but at least it was peaceful and pretty. Draco took another deep breath of wild air and closed his eyes. Wind played across his face—his lips, his brow, his eyelids—and he let his shoulders relax. Behind him, Harry made a satisfied sound. Then, “Scourgify!” The pond made a noise like an enormous belch, and with the force of a geyser, a solid shaft of water erupted from it, catching Harry’s front and sending him toppling backwards into the pond. Potter shot up, drenched and spluttering, as water rained down around him, and Draco didn’t even
He felt like he was standing there a very long time. He must have been, because Harry made eye contact with him. “Think of something?” He asked, and Draco had to shake his head.
Just a quick CW: Draco discusses his difficulty eating related to his depression. I know that sort of content can be triggering for some people. Just wanted to give you a heads up.
“If you is saying so, Master Malfoy,” Mimsy said tersely, bobbing a quick curtsy before dissapperating.
“I’m staying.” Harry might as well have shouted them. Draco started with sheer surprise. Weasley’s mouth fell open.
“So? He knows what he did. He isn’t a complete sack of dragon bollocks one time and you just forget all the other stuff he did?”
Draco wanted to open his mouth. To run. To grab his wand. But he was helpless to so much as blink. He lay paralyzed at the foot of his bed, as a pale face looked down at him. Skin like a cave creature, whose great-grandparents had died knowing only stories of the sun, translucent and mildew-damp, was pulled over harsh bones. Its cheeks were webbed with fine venules, and blue veins bulged in its neck and under its eyes. Great, grey eyes, wet and bloodshot in the red emberlight. Its hair was long, long as his father’s, lank and matted as it had been in the weeks following the trial. But its pointed chin and finely chiseled nose were not his father’s. And those eyes—those eyes were not his father’s either. His own twisted doppelganger stared down at him.
“Master Malfoy,” She said, voice a half-octave shriller than usual, “There is two Aurors at the gate. Auror Weasley and Auror Potter.
It wasn’t that Draco had always had a deep, exasperating thirst for Harry’s attention. It wasn’t that he’d been seethingly jealous of the members of Potter’s defensive magic classes fifth year. It wasn’t that Draco was now living in terror of whatever was haunting the halls of his own home, or that he sometimes was burning up for contact with the outside world and other times so sick to death at the thought of it that he shut all the curtains in his room and let himself slip into a blissful, forgetful nothing. It wasn’t even that Harry’s thighs looked delicious in those trousers and it had been months since Draco had gotten to leech on anyone. The comfortable reason for agreeing to Potter’s plan was that he was curious to see if a fountain of blood would erupt from Weasley’s ears if he got angrier. “I wouldn’t want to impose, of course,” He said silkily, “But if you could spare the time, I would appreciate the lesson.”
“Hermione and Ron are on it, I’m sure of it,” Harry said, “There’s nothing much I can do unless it comes back, until we know what it is, I mean. Until then… Well, it left that room upstairs. I figure it’s as safe as any other room in the house.” As he had no clue where Harry was going with this, suspicion was the only rational response. He stared at Harry, appraising him.
Draco didn’t have friends he loved to conjure up in his mind. He had fair-weather friends who came and went as it benefited them, as he would expect them to: allies against common enemies, knots in a net of contacts. He loved his parents, but he couldn’t think about them now without anxiety and guilt, bitterness and uncertainty. They loved each other, but love was all they had. Affection had always been stilted, at best. Draco could think of a time he’d felt a gut-wrenching moment of relief—when neither he nor his parents had been sentenced to Azkaban at their trial—but he hadn’t felt safe or happy then. More like crying. Quidditch victories—not a one against Potter, even—felt hollow and petty now. He’d been expecting his Hogwarts letter for years when it came. There were no baby-holding revelations in his life. His first kiss, with Pansy, had left him feeling nothing but a crawling discomfort. All his best school memories centered around humiliating Harry, which was probably too cruel to be used to fuel this sort of magic. There had been holidays to the French Riviera or to ski in the Alps, or flying over the vast, wind-bitten tundra of the Russian steppe. But all of that had been expected, and only comfortable or nice or empty, physical bliss. A good fly would probably only do him as well as a thorough fucking, and he didn’t think either would cut it.
"Well... Do you know the Patronus charm?" Harry said slowly, "That seemed to drive it off right away."
Draco’s face felt bright and hot; his heart alive with rigorous indignation. Harry was breathing hard, eyes bright behind his glasses. If he wasn’t angry, at least he was frustrated, and that was something Draco liked a hand and a foot over pity. He smiled, sharp and slender, and felt like himself for the first time in a long time.
Fingernails digging into his palms, Draco dragged himself to his own bedroom. The room had a distinctive scent of Mrs Skower's, partially covered by sage and lavender: three dried bouquets of the stuff were arranged in porcelain vases around the room. It was obvious Mimsy had gone to work here, taking advantage of Draco’s longest sojourn away from his bedroom in nearly a year. But the place still looked like hell. Though not the first affected place in the manor, his bedroom was certainly one of the worst hit. The warmth and heat of the fire died just feet away from the grate. The floors seemed scuffed by the dragging of iron-shod feet. Mimsy had pulled the curtains closed here, to shut out the night and hide the disastrous glass, but they looked moth-eaten, and Draco could smell the bittersweetness of rot rolling off them, even through the cleaning product and the dried bouquets. The wallpaper—green vines on cream—that had once appeared to flutter in a breeze at his command, now looked wilted and sickly. Along the walls, there were brief flashes of movement. Here. There. Always in the corners of his eyes. Not like the wind in leaves. Much more like furtive, darting insects. Feeling like a puppet with its strings cut, Draco fell heavily onto his bed. The bedframe lurched and groaned, shifted, but held. Draco closed his eyes and rubbed his knuckles into them. Even when something was handed to him, he was helpless to do anything but fuck it up. He lay there for a long time in the chill dim, on top of the covers, not able to pull together the energy to even remove his own boots. Amazing, really, how he could be so useless.
smile. But he wasted no time in doing as he was asked. Draco set a brutal pace for fifteen minutes that left them both sweating and his veins singing with a cleansing fire. With one arm wrapped around Harry’s chest, and the other playing at his throat, stroking his arms, his stomach, tugging at his cock, Draco kept his mouth busy biting Harry’s shoulder, or laving his throat with his tongue—that divine taste of sweat mid-sex—or else whispering sweet profanities into Harry’s ear.
“Someone who wanted to please the public, I guess. Saw you looking,” Harry had shot back, “Ah, there. Just like that...” After that, he’d pinned Harry down on his stomach with a pillow under his hips to work him over for another seven minutes, watching Harry rut against it with razor-sharp delight. He delayed his own satisfaction for as long as possible, until Harry had grated out a sound of post-orgasmic overstimulation, put his face in the crook of his arm and groaned, “
"Ron would love that. Doubt it is, since you’ve got a grudge against them. Might be a cat. Seems like you’re a bit aloof sometimes, like a cat. Do you only want a scratch behind the ears when everyone’s working?” Harry asked, with a tone that Draco might have taken as flirtation if he hadn’t been grinning quite so widely. As it was, stuck between the understatement of ‘a bit aloof sometimes’ and the sheer ridiculousness of the ear-scratching question, Draco found himself open-mouthed and tongue-tied. Harry cut in again before Draco managed to get a word out, “Oh, don’t look like that. I was only playing around… Look at that. It’s dark out. What time is it?”
“Not bad, Malfoy,” Harry said as Draco lowered his wand, and tucked it back into the loop on his hip, “That’s loads of progress from just this morning. I bet you could do it even in a pinch, now. And you can work on finding a stronger memory, so it’ll do a better job... Wonder what your Patronus will be.”
“Heavens, no!” Draco spluttered, feeling his ears go pink. Infatuated? Obsessed? Tangled up in lust and jealous passion? Yes. But in love? That was something else entirely.
“So. How have you been doing?” Harry asked, and Draco shot him a reproachful look through the waft of steam from his cup. There Potter went again, asking questions where he shouldn’t, with answers that didn’t warrant being given.
“Couldn’t tell you,” Draco drawled, flicking his wand threateningly at a Welsh Pixie who was approaching with too much enthusiasm to be trusted, “The last time I was here it was working fine.” But that had been nearly a year ago. And before Draco could even mull over just how pathetic his guardianship of his family’s property was, Potter was on his arse on the wet rocks, tugging off his boots. “What
“Why would she want to carry tureens of soup around when she can just apport the soup over?” Draco pointed out, gazing down at the design in crème fraiche decorating his soup. It smelled lovely, and for the first time in a long time, he rather wanted to eat. Under Harry’s gaze, he took a spoonful. It was rich, hot and perfectly spiced. He sighed with something close to satisfaction as it settled warmly into his stomach. “Sorry to eat in front of you, Potter,” He said, looking up from his bowl, “But I have to take my meals when I can stand them. And I believe Mimsy is serving four courses. If she under-serves you, we can swap plates. I doubt I’ll be in the mood for too much.” Harry’s brow furrowed, and Draco felt the intensity of those green eyes sharpen on him. Draco was very glad he had showered and dressed, but half an hour of work could not undo months of neglect. He knew he was paler than ever, that his eyes no longer looked quite right in his head—dull, shadowed, tired. He had lost weight that he couldn’t really afford to, and had been getting no exercise. He looked frail and sickly in ways that a fresh shave and clean hair could not disguise. Even Harry, unobservant as he was, must have noticed by now. He watched Harry press his lips together then relax them, rather enchanted by the way the color flushed in them.
“No,” Harry said blankly, and then, “I trust you.” Draco stared at him. The argument that Potter had used on Weasley to coax him into leaving was that he wasn’t
“Auror Potter,” He said with the smallest inclination of his head, “I’m surprised this warranted your time.”
Draco took a deep breath, “If this thing is stealing my face, if it’s intelligent, then it might intend to parasitize my life, somehow. Act as my doppelganger. I don’t know.”
“Do you have any childhood memories with her you really treasure? Bedtime stories, walks together, cooking together, anything like that?” And once again Draco had to laugh, because Potter certainly had no idea how a proper wizarding house was run.
"Hey, Malfoy, I think things have gotten brighter in here. Look at the windows,” Harry said. And he was right. Draco sat up, staring at the clear glass of the windows, as transparent as they had ever been, not distorting the color of the sunlight or the gardens beyond. The floors looked richer too, gleaming darkly in the light, and the chaise lounge didn’t look so faded anymore.
“Of course, Auror Potter,” Draco said, with a primness of tone that made Weasley turn an incredible shade of puce, “What hospitality the Manor has, I extend to you. I appreciate your dedication.”
. The laughter bubbled up from somewhere inside of him, bright and ticklish, and Draco gave himself up to it. Harry was looking at him, amused but still hopelessly confused too, “Is it the arms I’m doing wrong?” And Harry spun around again, moving his arms and wrists to the slow beat of the closing melody, like a mockery of a bird flapping its wings. Draco sank down into a crouch, sobbing with laugher as Harry stopped and threw his hands up, “Am I that bad?”
Feeling warm and full, with the Armagnac tickling his fingertips and toes, Draco thanked Mimsy for the meal. Her attitude towards Harry was slightly but noticeably warmer after dinner. She went so far as to cast a sidelong look at him that communicated something other than scorn before beaming at Draco. “I is very glad you is eating well. You is eating better than you has all year. Mimsy has tidied the bedroom by Master Malfoy’s for Auror Potter,” She told him, “And if you is wanting anything else, you can be calling. Chamomile tea, or a bath, or a calming draught, or anything.”
‘You are of course welcome to join us any time,’ The most recent one had read, Draco crouched over a writing desk that felt as though it had shrunk by a decent ten percent, ‘The Mediterranean air is doing wonders for your father’s health, and the gardens at the cottage are in full bloom.’ They had gone to the smaller French estate after the trials to escape the unpleasantness lingering in Britain, and in the hope that the change in climate would benefit his father’s flagging health. Either out of pride or sheer indifference, Draco had not accompanied them. He was still not sure which.
.” Obediently, the music book opened to the correct page. “You won’t be getting my best performance,” Draco said, eyes fixed on the first stanza, “It’s been a while since I’ve practiced.”
“Have you asked anyone else, then?” Pansy asked, sparing one distasteful glance for the carpet, which had developed a sickly hue and a few rolls that refused to be coaxed down, “You can’t live like this.” Draco hadn’t. So, after enduring an hour of Pansy’s critical perception, he resolved to go to an expert on the restoration and maintenance of old wizarding houses in Diagon Alley on Monday. Except Monday was grey and dismal, Tuesday was worse, and when Wednesday brought sunshine, Draco just couldn’t bring himself around to the idea of getting dressed and parading himself down a sure-to-be-bustling street, facing the disgust he was sure to receive. He just didn’t need it. So, he stayed home instead, pretending to read a book in the musty library and sending hexes at the Vampiric Moths that fluttered threateningly close to his ears. He put a cursory sort of effort into looking for the nest but couldn’t find it. Then he sent Mimsy to find it, but her search hadn’t turned up anything either. Draco locked up the library after that and resolved to deal with the problem tomorrow, when he had just a little more energy.
“Okay, we don’t have to be really traditional, if you don’t want to. What do we do, then?” Trying to ignore the sensory memory of Harry’s wand in his hand, and that warm jolt of realizing for how long he’d been holding it, Draco threw himself into more comfortable thoughts about choreography.
“Since my parents left for France, I have found that my appetite has failed me. It was on shaky legs before they left, but it’s only been getting worse. I have stomachaches quite often.  But even more than that, no food appeals to me. I eat every day—whatever I can stand. But so much of the time it feels horrible in my mouth, or the taste grinds on my nerves, or I feel as though my stomach is already quite full of rocks. Mimsy is constantly trying to offer me things. Sometimes I can manage a proper meal. But half of the time, all I can get through is an apple, or bread and butter, or oatmeal, or broth. Desserts, sometimes. But I used to love sweets, Potter. Now, nothing appeals. This soup is rather lovely, though. So I’m not going to be polite and abstain for your sake,” Draco said, giving a thin smile that was returned by a heart-squeezing grin.
“Oh, it’s not your fault,” Draco sighed, moving to sprawl on the loveseat, “Don’t obsess over it. I doubt that will help anything.”
“Oh, never mind,” Draco said, swallowing down a smile, “Do you want to see the water gardens? I haven’t been that way in months. They’re a little bit of a walk.”
He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move. At least, not until her fingers were reaching out towards his ankle. Then suddenly, he could. With a mad burst of movement, Draco leaped out of the creature’s reach and bolted for the door. He was just a moment too slow in reaching it, in closing it, to miss seeing a second hand reaching out of the piano. He slammed it shut, grabbed his wand from his sleeve and leveled it at the lock, “Colloportus!” The spell flashed and the door locked with a click. Breathless, cold sweat beading on his brow and breaking out all down his back, Draco collapsed against the wall of the corridor, stunned. And then the fear was breaking, bubbling over into overwhelming guilt and loathing and loneliness and misery, and Draco put his head into his arms and shook with silent sobs. That was how Mimsy found him fifteen minutes later, and she helped him up to bed, and brought him a calming draught, and under its influence Draco fell asleep.
“Okay,” Harry agreed, stepping to the left in perfect time, and then following it with a turn—but only a quarter turn.
“Wait, Malfoy,” Harry said, expression still too tender for comfort, “I wasn’t trying to put you down, or anything. I was just saying, it’s not that unusual: Luna Lovegood. Both my parents. Umbridge, and she was a horrible toad.”
“Lumos mobilis,” Harry said, and an orb of yellow light darted out to hang in the hallway, revealing nothing. “What’s going on?” He asked with a tone of firm urgency, neither relinquishing his hold on Draco nor lowering his wand.
“No, that’s quite alright, Mimsy, thank you,” Draco said, scrubbing a hand over his brow and eyes, recomposing himself. The elf didn’t look pleased with that response, but she bobbed a quick curtsey nonetheless, and exited back out into the hall. When Draco looked back at Harry, he was buttoning up his shirt. “It’s been difficult. But time goes on,” Draco said at last.
“No, it happened just now. I saw it happening while you were laughing,” Harry said, brow furrowing just a little, “Hey, Malfoy. Why don’t you try the Patronus charm again? You’re in a better mood now. It should be easier. It probably won’t be a powerful enough memory for a full Patronus, but try the dancing one, okay? I think you could some mist out of it, anyway.”  It was difficult to imagine that laughing at Harry would be enough to power any emotion-driven spell, but Draco couldn’t deny that he did feel much more buoyant now than he had in the garden. He drew his wand, rolling the hawthorn shaft in his fingers, contemplating the warmth in his chest, and the pleasant soreness of his sides. He’d been having fun, that was all. Just having fun. “S’just Expecto Patronum,” Harry prompted. As if Draco would have forgotten the incantation. But Draco didn’t snap back, instead conjuring up the image of Harry flapping and twirling like a duck attempting ballet in his mind. Oh,
