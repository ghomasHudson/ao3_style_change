Draco clicks his tongue, familiar annoyance creeping back up now that Potter is no longer crying, along with the barest hint of relief, because he never knows what he should be doing when someone cries. "It's not what you're saying, it's how you're framing it. You have to use
“I’ve already managed well enough these past two days,” Potter spits. “Hagrid taught us invisibility spells for animals and she’s smart enough to not make trouble in class.”
"Yes, but it was my spell and my teacup," Draco hisses back, petting the top of her head gently. "And look at the state of
Draco raises an eyebrow, grinning. "Disappointed that you won't be able to murder me, Potter? All of your scheming gone to waste?"
he thinks at his stupid friend as he strides through the halls before Pansy can catch upto him, the younger students hurriedly moving out of his way as he passes.
AND Im so excited abt the Blaise part because ppl are always much more willing to change for their friends so this is gonna be fun.
"Hogwarts has a system in place that utilizes the water from the lake, passes it through the cleaning spells set up at the centre of the school and sends it back into the river," Granger lectures while Draco stares at the thundering cascade of water pouring out from gaps between the bridge's pillars. Now that he's here in the daylight, it's a much more intimidating task than he'd thought it would be, and it's also a wonder the whole Viaduct hasn't come crashing down already with the force of the flow. "It's an extremely innovative mashup of Muggle powerplants and magic,
But they'd never talked about it, horrible situation that it was, because everyone had assumed Theo would eventually come to his senses, because he was usually the closest thing they had to a voice of reason- stopping them from gallivanting off to Switzerland by convincing them that sneaking into the Neone’s first-of-its-kind completely airborne party overlooking a rare Doxy migration would be much more fun, for example- but if anything, his infatuation only seemed to get worse over time, until the only person not aware of it was Greg himself.
They don’t get a chance to talk about it the next day, because Granger ambushes him in the school's daily early morning run around the castle to talk about the Triwizard, and ten minutes later the rest of her group accosts them as well.
"My life does not revolve around Harry Potter," He says indignantly. "I don't have to be paying attention to him every single day, do I? I don't want to deal with his stupidity today, that's all."
"Because I
“No,” Pansy says slowly, “But he has Veela blood, doesn’t he?”
“So many things make sense now,” Blaise whispers back in an awed tone, and Draco stops listening.
“Yea, but food tastes so much more nicer when y’r hungry,” Abbott says, smacking the table in tune with her words.
Blaise spells his tears away gracefully and sniffs, pulling his wings back in with a roll of his shoulders, walls suddenly up again. Draco feels cold at the abrupt loss of him, curling his fingers into the blankets and trying not to sound pleading. “Blaise.”
that earlier?"
"See you," Draco murmurs uselessly to no one, blinking hard a few times before he can get his legs to start working again to go back to the dorms.
“And I’m not letting you curse her with the most basic names to exist,” he retorts. They glare at each other for a moment, fists curled, before Mother's etiquette lessons come to mind and Draco takes a deep, steadying breath.
,” He sings out as they move in a coordinated attack onto the girl, who’s still staring intensely after Abbott and rubbing the place where she was punched, mindlessly holding her arm up in half-wave after her new crush.
"Well obviously, it's because the Death Eaters are trying to kill him," Draco says without thinking.
“Was it noticeable?” He breathes, a bit scared of the answer.
to stifle my words with your
Potter doesn't reply, still holding onto the outcropping of the wall he'd grabbed onto, head down and breathing hard.
He forgets the apples, but his queer heart can only take so much, so he forgives himself and he goes to lie face-down on his bed between a snoring Vince and Greg for the rest of the afternoon instead.
“But isn’t it a place in the castle?” Thomas says in confusion. “Why are we researching famines again?”
"A Death Eater came to my house," Draco sputters out, alarmed, which is true enough to satisfy the quick Legilimency sweep Severus makes. Draco carefully puts his shields back up before he continues, making sure there's no one else in his head before he lies, "Father threw them out immediately, but they mentioned 'letting the Triwizard take care of it before he arrives.'"
“Pansy, love,” He repeats, all of their smirks glinting sharp in the sunset as she jerks back to life and looks around at them with the clear expression of someone who’s just realized they’ve fucked up. “Do you have anything you want to tell us?”
” Draco says, feeling vaguely panicked and very uncomfortable all of a sudden. “He has to know we don’t mean
"Yeah, but that makes no sense, does it?" Abbott fires up suddenly. "If the Wizarding World only had y'r pureblood families, sooner or later you'd end up marrying your own sister to keep the lines fresh, wouldn't ya?"
“Don’t shout, Blaise,” Granger murmurs into the table and hiccups. Astoria starts mimicking her immediately, giggling.
“What the fuck,” he says out loud and Ethalia pecks at his fingers for the bag of snacks.
Potter relaxes. "Great."
He forces himself not to squirm as everyone in the room stares at him, because a Malfoy should never display any self-consciousness. But his lip twitches slightly in a defensive snarl anyway and his hands curl slightly into fists. "What?"
"You'd have two ears," Thomas sniggers, "And the eyes of both your parents and the nose from the distant family of your second cousins."
Draco has two options. One, say of course not, it was all a sham to get into the Gryffindors' good books to let them participate, however indirectly, in the Triwizard. It's perfectly acceptable under Slytherin's ambitious principles, keeps in harmony with his parent's teachings and family's ideologies, and he'll let one of his closest friends down irreparably, making
“Brenda?” Draco says, aghast. Even
Dumbledore is the first person who manages to get themselves together, asking neutrally, "What are you doing here, Mr. Malfoy?"
“Um-” Someone in front of him says questioningly and his temper snaps back up just as fast as it had disappeared, and he curls his wand up to cast a low-level blasting charm at the floor between him and Potter.
“What?” he hears someone say, which sums up their collective bewilderment pretty well.
They chuckle in unison, petting different parts of her body, and the room slowly comes back into focus.
Because every single curse that has ever befallen the Malfoy line has landed on his shoulders for having the misfortune of being the outcome of a decision to have a single child, Draco ends up with his books in the same shelf as Potter’s.
his office, the champions and headmasters are supposed to meet in the first-year's Transfiguration classroom in two minutes."
. Here, hold."
“Eleven languages, and for what?” Blaise says teasingly and ducks away from her sharp hand. He jogs around the table to escape her and leans in from the opposite side, resting his body weight on Granger and Weasley’s shoulders. “No, I don’t know that one.”
Draco sneers at him and reminds himself that his mother would be very disappointed if he defaced a rare Katawixi book with his nails, or threw it at Potter's head and it somehow got corrupted by the other's stupidity. "Oh, shut the fuck up" He snaps, "Or would you rather rope in twenty more people to fill in for the job the eight of us are doing?"
all these years, right? None of us have," Draco evades, pushing concern into his voice. Blaise pushes his head further into Draco's pajamas silently and the half-fake concern twists into genuine distress. "
With a nigh near stupendous show of either obliviousness or straight-up turning a blind eye to everyone staring at him, Potter ignores them all and walks back to the same table, pulling out worms to steal Cora’s loyalty with.
At least Potter has the decency to look a bit abashed at this one. "Yeah, well," He says and then doesn't explain anything. "Remember how Dumbledore said I could get help for the tournament from some of my friends? Well, the first riddle came in and Hermione said to come ask for your help because even if you are a twat, you might be able to figure it out."
“Thanks for the help,” He says, “It’s almost not bad having you around when you’re not being a prejudiced terror.”
“That’s not very nice, Pansy,” She says quietly.
Potter actually laughs at that, cheeks still blush-dark, smile bright and blinding, eyes crinkling at the corners for a few moments. Draco's amusement dies a stuttering death to make way for flaming homosexuality because fucking
. Plus, Draco's pretty sure he'll somehow get implicated if he leaves the other here and the idiot drives himself into the Janus Thickey ward, so he says carefully, in case the last bit of sanity holding Potter together snaps and the other turns on him, "Can't you just… tell them you don't want to participate?"
"Don't be fucking rude," He snaps and Draco's temper sparks back up immediately, hands curling into fists.
Draco glances at Abbott while everyone else- regardless of Houses- silently cheers and shoots Pansy thumbs-ups and makes aggressive hand movements for her to accept the proposal- some of which could be passably interpreted as an imitation of the flight of a newborn Bludger let loose on a party. Abbott is blushing as well, fingers tugging nervously at her skirt the longer Pansy stays silent, eyes flicking down to where Pansy is ruining their collective reputations by having her mouth open like a dead fish.
when it came down to it, why did this idiot care so much about them anyway?
"Even-"
Blaise puts a hand on Draco's forehead, which practically covers his entire face (he has big, slender,

is not what Draco would call the next two hours in the slightest. The Gryffindors, to no one’s surprise, are lightweights, and also apparently have never had alcohol before, so Draco is forced to babysit them.
"I'M NOT THAT IDIOTIC!" He yells back.
” Potter says smugly, turning the dinosaur on her back so swiftly that Draco’s heart actually skips a beat in fear, pulling out one long black foot to flash it at him. She doesn’t protest at the rough treatment which is the only reason Draco doesn't murder Potter there and then. She coos happily instead, and the insufferably righteous expression on Potter’s face wavers as he glances down at her and cracks into besotted staring.
“I absolutely cannot wait,” he says, but Draco’s so relieved he doesn’t pay attention to whatever Blaise is babbling on about, instead grabbing onto the arm around him and mushing his cheek into Blaise’s comfortable warmth. “For the day you figure it out. It’s going to be
"The library?" Astoria says dismally, though quiet enough to not get them kicked out. "Why are we- oh.
“Why don’t you lot search for them then, if you’re so worried?” Draco interrupts Granger with a snarl, and Finnigan looks at him belligerently and then straightens up with an air of determination and garbs a parchment to start scribbling. Draco assumes he's listing possible hiding places to be checked, which means there’s one less thing for the rest of them to be worried about. Even if the idiot gets killed, at least they’ll have an answer to if there
Potter scowls back at him, but doesn't say anything, because Draco is, as usual, correct.
"She's not that bad!" She protests vehemently, and Draco raises his eyebrows and exchanges a glance with an amused Blaise. He ignores the guilt-threaded mess of emotions that shoot through him as their gazes catch, that have been plaguing him every time he makes eye contact with the other, instead smirking over the free blackmail Astoria had given to them on a silver platter.
Harry, watching Draco's attention go to the Slytherin for 0.5 seconds after they wasted an hour of everyone's time because he had Draco's attention, and then seeing him kiss Pansy on the cheek platonically: I am filled with unbridled rage. This is normal.
- YOU STUPID BALLBAGS!”
at his stupid face.
Draco growls, making the third year shrink back satisfyingly even as Vince grabs his hands tightly. "No hexing the babies," He says firmly, ignoring Draco kicking him.
“Let's get back to it then, shall we?” He interrupts frigidly, and flies off before anyone can answer.
Unfortunately, any ground-breaking inventions Draco might make in the one minute of pure euphoria he experiences die a sad death as Potter recovers and gives him his best glare- probably in the Top Ten Glares in the country, with how long he spends practicing it on Draco. It would be absolutely terrifying for anyone else, but Draco, who’s been subjected to the horrid expression for four years running and at this point doesn’t think there’s a glare in the world that can faze him anymore, just rolls his eyes and flies along.
that had thickened the air when they'd walked in
is that you’re all-” Draco starts to shout back, but his magic abruptly lurches back and fizzles out, taking his voice with it, anger draining away. The word ‘Muggleborns’ had been about to pass his lips, before he almost violently remembered Blaise curled tight in a ball and practically howling to the ceiling that morning, gone half-harpy in distress.
" He says in surprise, looking around. "Weasley! Is the curse of your family affecting us now too?"
Draco actually cannot speak for the sheer amount of stupidity being exhibited in front of him right now. Potter's finished half the roof by the time he gets a handle on his speechlessness and flies forward to smack the prat up the head.
Draco shakes him by the grip on his arm for a lack of better things to do and Potter blinks, the glaze over his eyes disappearing, and he straightens back up in a manner that suggests he hadn't even realized he was shrinking away from the others in the room. Draco frowns.
They stare at each other for a few moments in the empty classroom, for enough time that it would be off-putting and awkward with anyone else, and then turn to stare at the hybrid creature as she jumps down and starts nibbling at the corner of the desk.
And then fingers wrap around his wrist and he's being yanked painfully backwards and turned around. Draco pulls his hand away with a wordless snarl and glares.
"He's saying he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire," Draco continues when no one says anything.
(See the end of the chapter for

Draco might have gotten a bit carried away.

A second hand twists in the front of Draco's robes, and he fleetingly thanks Merlin that everyone is in class and the hallway is empty, before his entire awareness boils down to the person in front of him when Potter growls straight in his face, "I can keep up
He sneers and sits down next to him, snatching up a quill and drawing quick margins. Around them, the others are already one cup into the vintage firewhiskey Millicent had smuggled in, much more amiable in their conversations than they would usually be.
Blaise shakes the entire bed as he sobs, feathers molting wildly around them, and Draco holds him as tight as he can and whispers nonsense calming sounds at him, one hand petting the other’s wings.
"To get them to
“I’ll knock off two favours from all your ledgers,” She says loftily.
“Now do you believe us?” Granger snaps. “I looked up past events- this stupid Tournament is not a joke! Did you know-”
Potter, fuck you very much, Greg- vaguely implied otherwise, even though he'd made a New Year's resolution to stop with the habit.
“That’s that?” Millicent sputters.
"That just brings up the question if it's just accents that are sexy or if it is just the thrill of not knowing what is being said," Thomas says thoughtfully, with all the seriousness of a wise scholar. "What makes someone hot?"
“No, you fell off the roof, is what you did,” Draco says sharply. “And you didn’t cast any spells, you obviously have to check if they’ve charmed any of the rooftiles, you utter cretin.”
“...Yeah, probably,” Potter says. “Move out, everyone. Keep an eye out for anything that might look like it doesn’t belong on the Viaduct.”
Of course, annoying idiot that he is, Weasley doesn't answer, waving a hand dismissively. “Never mind that,” he says, “Are you telling me actual

“No, that’s Cyrillic,” Draco murmurs, skimming the paper. Across the table, Finnigan says in a surprised tone, “Oh right, I forgot you were a Pureblood, Ron.”

His brain was a mess
he chants to himself as he chases down Finnigan, who is chasing after Thomas, who is chasing after Millicent, who is trying to get into the forbidden section to look for good sets of clothing for the three of them.
"But why were you trying to add snake scales in the first place?" Granger demands and Draco pauses.
"You know I haven't meant

"Do you know how overcrowded those rooms are already?" Draco complains, "I don't need more trash in my house, thank you."
"What?" He says, buying himself time as he rubs his overstretched side with a grimace.
"Yes, well I didn't tamper with the instructions, did I? I just replaced one of the ingredients."
," Blaise sobs, and Draco feels guilt burrow into his heart, wanting desperately to go back in time and slap all of their younger selves hard for never noticing. "Every time you- you all talked about Mudbloods, I would- always wonder if you secretly thought that of me-"
"Well, sometimes tradition and values shouldn't be followed," He says finally, looking down at where he's let the ink blot the page and turning to a new one.
“Sorry,” Potter mutters and Draco pinks in embarrassment and looks away with a scowl.
“What the fuck is asunder?” Greg asks.
as I can, enough to fit even
“What is that supposed to mean?” Granger says indignantly and Draco derails the conversation before it starts.
“They obviously tampered with the cup, so they must be in the castle!” Finnigan cries out, “They could be waiting to kill us all in our sleep!”
"You'll owe me three and I want to know all of the secret passages in the castle that you mentioned," Draco returns promptly. The bird shudders a bit before turning into a dragon this time, and he narrows his eyes at it.
" Draco says, and absolutely nothing proceeds to happen. The thing bites his finger in reproach. "...Throw it away, I guess."
“I’m not,” Draco snaps, even though he is. “I just don’t think that if we’re going to hate each other, it should be over something I no longer believe in.”
couldn't they tell he was just sucking up to the other side for profit? But he can't say it, or even imply it with a well-timed glance without being caught, so he keeps silent and tries his best to look foreboding.
“Oh will you piss off, the lot of you,” Draco snaps crossly as he goes to shove his quills in his bag. He refuses to stay here as long as these idiots are tainting the peacefulness of the place. "Go play Exploding Snap with the murderous creatures of the forest, or whatever is it you do in your free time. At least that way you'll be inflicting your presence on living things at your level of intelligence."
"If it turns out that she hasn't been joking this whole time and is actually conducting social experiments on us, I'm turning her into a clock and throwing her in the cursed rooms of Malfoy Manor," Millicent calls out as she jogs up to them, bottles clinking in her bag as she moves.
Draco resolves, feeling slightly shaken. He reaches out to grab the paper and quills kept in the middle of the table and slides them out to the others to hide the discomfort sinking its cold claws into his chest.
“Not that the thought of that isn’t absolutely delightful,” Draco interrupts, grimacing, “But can you three nutters get out of the Great Lake before-”
, it’s just something that's common sense. If we keep breeding with Muggles, the pure magic that we've inherited, that doesn't
He bites his lip hard as he tries to shake the vision and the echo of the heart-rending sobs stuck in his head. Potter frowns at him, his own fire-hot magic sizzling down when Draco doesn’t respond, and he stands there uselessly in the hallway, not being able to take in enough air.
“Oh, like you don’t eat strawberry candies like they’re your last meal before you’re due to hang,” Potter says nastily, crossing his arms.
“Yes, well, there are always different ways to do potions,” Draco says shortly. "Now give that
"Hey, think of it this way,” Longbottom says with a grin, putting a hand around her shoulders. “At least now you know you also like girls.”
"Have we
“Hannah, you fucking genius,” Potter says, tottering alarmingly before grabbing onto Abott’s sleeve. Draco stops Vanishing the bottles to run over and grab them before they both overbalance and shoves them both down onto a beanbag, before running off to grab Greg from the windowsill as he tries to ‘fly with the sheer power of free will’. “You solved it!”
"You do that," Draco says, already planning to do his own research. "See you at five, Potter."
Potter hears anyway and the quill in his hand bends a little. He exhales loudly and says through gritted teeth, "I

bitter rivals of legend, work together on something! Somebody call the papers!”
"Could have fooled me," Draco says under his breath, turning a page and scanning it.
His own allies are similarly dumbstruck as he hits at their shoulders to corral them into sitting down, taking his own place in front of Potter at the center.
Draco doesn't think the other is one for crying either, come to think of it. He hasn't seen the other cry even once in over three years.
Draco snorts as she flies away, mounting his own broom and flying up abruptly so Potter has to swerve to the side to avoid getting knocked out of the sky. He hears a low growl from the heathen behind them and smirks over his shoulder as he casts a Notice-me-not on himself.
"Herbology?!" Neville asked quite loudly. They all turned to him as he flushed. "I quite like Herbology. I've never practiced with the plants themselves. Nan never let me get one."
He ran all the way out of the entrance hall and towards the Quidditch field. It was completely empty, to none of his surprise.
"Should you?" The hat asked. "Is that what you want? Well you don't have much ambition...you have a lot of intelligence and loyalty...oh, and a caring nature...maybe Hufflepuff? No, I think you'd do far better in another house... RAVENCLAW!" The hat yelled out to the hall. It was then that Draco realised his sorting had taken the longest out of all of them.
Draco thought for a moment.
Danny tried to Alohomora the lock on the door, successfully, as the creaking wood opened for them at a push.
“Uh, okay...”
"Well if you insist. You do really need my help. So, I believe we're going to...Gladrags Wizardwear? I heard that they've started selling muggle clothing, so you can still mantain your casual "style"." He replied sarcastically, using quotation marks. I snorted and shook my head.
He began to nod. “Yeah, you’re probably right. Just another overreaction. I just hate Granger.” He convinced himself and Octavia nodded.
And don't get in a flap!
The school day was okay. The friends were okay. Studying in the library was fun. But it still felt a bit bleak, covered in a layer of grey from Lucius' letter.
“Absolutely plastered. How much alcohol did you drink?” Blaise asked him. Draco hummed into his shoulder.
“Core, you really are blind!” Draco exclaimed and laughed openly. “If this is what you need to see, I can’t imagine what you’re seeing now!” Draco leant the glasses on his nose to look at Potter and was greeted with angry squinting. Draco laughed again.
"Uh, hi?" The boy replied anxiously, cowering in on himself a bit. "My name's Harry."
“Hmm?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Better than calling them ‘the mermaid’” Martha pointed out. The other two nodded in agreement, facing Shelly once again.
"It looks okay, I think. Looks fine. Weird because, you know, it's usually super neat and combed through and covered in gel or whatever, but it's different. A good different! But still, you know, different..." I started rambling. His face took on a faint pink flush high on his cheekbones, making him look sort of kind of angelic. In a way. Because of the halo hair! Obviously.
“Hello Weasley, having a good morning are you?” He asked in his smuggest, most satisfied voice.
Everyone knew what a mistake he was.
Because Pansy was gone and he wasn’t with mother, he had no one who knew how to bring him back down to earth. He’d been having one of his moments for two days now. Over 48 hours of being trapped in his head.
Rumours of what had happened in the entrance hall swept throughout the school, and whenever he saw the Golden Trio he got a whispered “ferret” from the Weasel. Which was just plain ridiculous. Weasley was the weasel here, not him. It wasn’t his fault their new DADA teacher was psychotic. So far he’d avoided Snape’s attempts to talk with him about it and had tried to get on with his school life. Primarily the task of getting Octavia friends.
The kid then kneeled down on the bed and reached pathetically for a pillow. His arms were still tied awkwardly, but then he managed to grab the pillow and hold it. He closed his eyes in focus and his brows furrowed. Sirius raised an eyebrow.
"I appreciate your intentions Granger, but you're going to have to go further than giving an odd house elf a sock to make a difference."
“Sirius, are you okay?” The boy asked the man, sending a deathly glare towards Draco. Draco smiled and waved patronisingly.
Blaise immediately yelled “NO! Damn it, NO!” And collapsed with his head face down on the table in some real theatrics. His disappointment was barely heard past the shrieking excitement coming from the Hufflepuff table. Many were standing up and cheering, patting Cedric on the back and giving him many congratulations.
Draco tentatively reaches for Potter’s hand.
“The VIBES.”
"Well, we don't know that Father had something to do with this..." he knew he was spitting bullshit and one raised eyebrow showed that so did she. He thought for a moment. "Do you want a piggy back?"
“Well it certainly isn’t a Samhain ball.” She squeezes his side. “But doesn’t this seem more fun?” She turned his head to the dancing and singing crowd of kids and his scowl faded somewhat. She squeezed his cheeks. “See you in a bit, I need a drink.” She disappeared through the crowd, leaving Draco a bit confused and feeling awkward. He nearly rubbed at his left forearm again, a stupid habit he’d picked up as of late.
“Yeah, right...um, I’ll think of a favour soon, I promise. And I’ll tell you when I do.”
Although Blaise did have a fond memory of Draco standing on the common room table and yelling that he was “the baddest bitch in this goddamn house” before giving half the year a strip show by taking of his shirt and jacket and throwing it into the catcalling audience.
“Stop please-“
"Veela..." Octavia looked through her Omnioculars, and sure enough, the pretty ladies had a more supernatural tone to their beauty. More enchanting. Less human. Octavia looked to the other boys staring over the edge and snorted at their drooling.
“I think I’m gay!” He blurted out.
“I mean, the biggest issue seems to be everyone thinking that you wanted this, and are being a smug little bitch about it.” Potter scowled. “Which you obviously aren’t being!” Draco defended. “But that’s the story going around. To stop that misconception, you’d have to be
"Son of Lucius Malfoy, a Slytherin and a death eater through and through."
"Via, you've got to play quidditch with me when we get back to the Manor! I've got to learn how to do that!" He yelled excitedly, his Omnioculars probably making marks around his eyes.
"-are you? Oh, this is stupid - Lumos!" Granger's bossy voice rang out.
“Why did you agree to Potter’s truce?” Draco froze.
He might find Potter’s sass to be funny and charming.
"How do you know how to do that?"
okay this has basically turned into me appreciating you guys so I'll see you in the next chapter, remember to share your thoughts and input because i care about what you think okay bye
"Father."
He handed her the bag with her dress in with a smile. "Now we'll both be incredibly fashionable. Together." She grinned widely up at him.
"What do you mean? You're the first in a long line of Slytherin ponces to be a Ravenclaw. That's a pretty big deal, but it doesn't mean it's a bad deal!" Anthony butted in.
He would work. He would study. He would keep his head down.
“Dating?”
After ten minutes of idle discussion, owls began to fill the roof of the great hall. Hundreds of them swooping down to deliver to students, some simply dropping letters off before flying right back out, others stopping by the students to steal food and get petted.
Draco slid it open to a plump happy woman who reminded her of Ron's mother.
to show me that move you were doing!” Draco flushed.
“You’re not just going to be a Veela.” Draco looked confused. “You’re also going to be a cheerleader for the Bulgarian National Team!” Draco’s face lit up in a hot red.
My shoulders immediately flinched up at the contact. Mr It's-Only-7-But-I'm-Still-Going-To-Sleep didn't care, and instead chose snuggle his face into one of my raised shoulders. I heard Luna snicker at this, to which I glared in response. I could feel my cheeks growing hotter as I looked down at Malfoy's peaceful face. It was odd to say the least.
Until next time, leave a kudo and a comment and keep strong in quarantine amigos!
"You've already been to Hogwarts, Mother, years ago. Don't you remember?"
“Okay, I no longer wish to be carried by you. Put me down, I’ll limp my way to Pomfrey.” He told the smirking idiot and struggled a bit in his grip.
"We are pretty messed up."
"You were so easy to wind up, especially Weasley. It was just so fun trying to think up insults or schemes to bother you. Life was pretty boring at Hogwarts when you're not involved in the conspiracies and had finished with all your homework. I either studied a whole lot for the exams, or I sought you out to bully. It was especially boring during in Fourth year, when Quidditch was cancelled due to the tournament. Looking back, I think I was a little obsessed with you, and Pansy can definately vouch for that." My head snapped round to look at him surprised. He carried on, sounding as casual as all hell, but while sporting a faint blush. "I mean, the Potter Stinks badges?! Those were originally just me messing around with my free time during charms, but it took real time and effort to charm and make allllll of them. Time that probably could have been spent doing something more useful. But I was determined. I kept thinking 'This'll show Potter' even though you hadn't really done anything. I was just mad at you for getting more attention than me, and for not paying as much attention to me at the same time."
“Eh, I can’t trust him not to cop a feel.”
A group of teenagers in pajamas stood muttering to each other a while along the path. When they saw the golden trio plus him and Via, a girl with thick curly blonde hair walked over to them.
"Malfoy!" Both Potter and Granger scolded, while Weasley began laughing.
She walked to her room quickly before he could get another comment in.
“Sure, go after me for wanting someone experienced! That’s real supportive of you
She gagged and quickly began to walk away before she heard Blaise say something. Something that didn’t sound quite right.
Because that moment comes with the realisation that he really *really* likes Potter.
They continued to bicker in the common room, but Octavia’s mind was elsewhere.
“An evil little shit I’m related to.” Sirius kept it vague. “Do you mind holding the cat?” He picked up the ugly thing and passed it to Harry, who took it confusedly. Sirius then picked up the limp body and walked towards the house.
“Drako! How vas s’e Hallow’s Eve party? Vas it very fun?” Borislav sat across from and asked. Draco thought that Borislav was one of his favourite Durmstrangs. He was very sweet.
A lot of the things on the list were simply wishes. Practically all of them really. The only one that seemed the least bit feasible was to eat a cake, but Aunt Bella hated desserts of all kind, so it’d take a lot of begging.
"Just what I wanted. Can I have the money pouch back please?" She smiled and shook her head.
Ugh, he feels like a house elf. Or a peasant. This wasn’t Malfoy work at all, and he ought to be thanked handsomely by his housemates for his sacrifice. This was all very disgusting.
“Ugh...” he groaned.
Blaise went onto his knees and leaned over towards Draco to whisper in his ear as well. His breath tickled. Draco giggled.
The footsteps as he was lead away were deafening on the tiled floor. Every eye stayed glued on him, judging him, following his every movement. The door of the chamber closed.
"Okay it's my turn for a question. Does Hogwarts really not teach Maths or English?"
“The champion for Durmstrang...will be Viktor Krum.” Shrieks of excitement ran across the Slytherin table, and Octavia caught Draco fawning over Krum as he stood, looking extremely happy, and practically rejecting all of his other...suitors...
It would be far too loud to move the chair closer to the sofa where Sirius was resting, it would surely wake him up. Draco’s hands weren’t at a good angle to Accio the wand towards him either, and he doubted he could muster the strength to do more wandless magic anyway. What did he have at his disposal...
Blaise waggled his eyebrows. “Filthy in the good way, my friend.” Draco gagged in disgust as he waved the other boy away.
The next chapter will have more drarry I promise! I can’t wait to get it to you even tho it’ll feature a Halloween party and Halloween has already passed but that doesn’t matter ssshhhhh
“And Vince has been helping Greg with his homework anyway he can. That’s why he’s falling behind a bit more, he’s constantly trying to help out Greg!”
“Stop trying to make everything straight you Manor Child. And she could never be, she’s dating
"No, I don't think they would. The school's way has always been to admit as many magical children as possible. I doubt they'd start throwing people out if your magic wasn't strong enough. Besides, it's not like you have anything to worry about." He nudged her shoulder teasingly. She smiled.
Anthony and Michael had separated and were now working with Hufflepuffs, but Draco and Terry managed to stick together. Snape liked to add plenty of scrutiny and quips to those who were making their potions, but he'd had only positive things to say about Draco, even giving 5 points to Ravenclaw for the way he'd stewed the horned slugs. Draco felt uncomfortable with the attention, and kept his head down the entire time.
Octavia peeked over the side to see about a hundred really pretty women on the pitch, all dancing. A lot of the men, mostly the boys, had gone closer to the edge to look at them better. Draco stayed where he was though, looking at them with interest, but not really attraction.
“Won’t be taken as seriously if we just give them away for free.” He nudged her. “And if you stop complaining, I’ll share some of the cash. Pocket money you don’t have to beg mum for.” She sighed.
"Hellooooooo? Am I going to walk you to class or should I leave you two to it." Pansy broke the silence. Malfoy was first to back out of our weird staring competition to smack the giggling witch on the arm.
"Rules are overrated. I prefer to spend time with you guys, so I will." She replied simply, sitting down carefully, her large blue and white polka dotted skirt being smoothed down with small hands. She had her hair in a messy bun, two knitting needles sticking out of it. Her hair was currently light blue, so I guessed that she'd used the dye Malfoy had bought for her. It suited her. She had large earrings in, one earring being a very small spiral bound notepad, the other being a tiny quill. I absentmindedly wondered if the notebook and quill could be used. Who am I kidding, this is Luna, of course they are functional.
Excitement filled Neville's face as he raced off the stool with the ratty old hat still on his head. After sorting that situation out to many bouts of laughter, he sat next to Hermione. Draco guiltily felt the same things he'd felt about Hermione's sorting. Sure he'd make other friends in Slytherin, but he rather liked those two.
“Alone at night?”
“Vhy does that matter?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco huffed. “Greg dancing with Pansy.” He encouraged. Vince looked down at the floor.
“Is that ungratefulness I’m hearing?” Aunt Bella smiled threateningly. Draco shook his head rapidly. “I thought not. My little Draco, I have given you the privilege of not needing to deal with the hardships of life. I keep you here to protect you. I stole you away out of the beauty in my heart, knowing you’d be far happier with me than if you were raised with your disgusting traitor parents.” She spat the last word with venom.
"They're probably after muggles. Muggleborns don't look so great either, so I wouldn't wave my knickers about, Granger."
“He’s hurting Draco!”
He might find Potter’s jokes to be terrible in the best way.
“Of course it is.” He agreed. “But its the fun kind of Loony. Like Lovegood’s hats or earrings.” He mimed large earrings. “She may be completely barmy but at least she has a taste for attention and grandeur. Those are traits I can respect.”
“I heard that!” Draco yelled.
"Give me a moment Mother, I have to wash this bloo- jam, I have to wash this jam off of my arms." He slipped his hand out of hers and went over to the sink. He turned the tap to cold water and let it flow over his gash. It had mostly dried up by now, so he opened up the cupboard under the sink and got out the first aid kit. Ordinarily it could be fixed easily with a couple of spells, but Draco didn't have his wand yet, and he didn't want to bother his father anymore.
SIBLING POV CHANGE
It leaves Draco and Octavia. Draco sighs.
Today was different.
They both spoke at the same time. They turned back to each other before rushing out the door to meet them.
“Bleeding Theo.” Pansy mutters. She stands up and brushes off her skirt before wiping away any stray tears. She holds Octavia and Draco’s heads in each of her hands for a minute and smiles. “Goodnight angels.” She gives them a perfect smile and walks away.
Draco leaned forward on his knees and went next to Blaise’s ear to whisper it. His breath hovered over the shell and Draco noticed Blaise shiver.
I have all of these songs, as well as some others which remind me of the fic’s vibe, in a Spotify playlist labelled — Double Trouble (drarry fanfic) — so go check it if you want! ❤️❤️❤️
“A lot of practice and research. We’re nearly there. I’d try a Lumos.” They lit their wands to guide them through the darkened passageway, the eeriness feeling truly Halloween.
Especially one that wasn’t related to stupid twats like Draco Malfoy.
“Oh, he’ll be out in a bit. He’s helping Blaise with some difficult transfiguration on his costume. I don’t know who he’s going to be. Some muggle celebrity I think?” Greg cocked his head. “I have no clue.”
Draco clasped his hands together nervously, but followed after McGonagall, staying right behind an eager Hermione and right before an anxious Neville.
“This hickey-or bruise-or whatever! Isn’t covered up.” He turned to Theo, who was sporting a matching one, and flushed. He pointed to the ‘bruise’ on Theo’s neck. “Did I do that?” He asked nervously.
"I should sell tickets. It would make a fortune."
“Did you jus’ call me Drake?” Draco asked him, slurring slightly. Blaise loosened his hand in Draco’s grip.
“That’s because it comes from a place of love!”
"Um Draco, why do you have to talk to Potter every train ride?"
“Aww, Drakey you seem tense.” Pansy distracted him from his thoughts by popping herself down on his lap, sidesaddle.
“You did mean well.” Octavia says. “But he is stubborn. You two aren’t really good at the whole...”
“I guess so?”
"And I'll become Minister of Magic. We'll rule the world together, you and I." They giggled. Draco wasn't sure that he wanted to become Minister, but he knew he wanted to make a good difference.
He pursed his lips and didn’t answer. She nodded.
The mess had all began when the great Lord Voldemort had been defeated by the baby boy Harry Potter. His defeat had sent a ripple of shock, mostly relief, throughout the wizarding community. You know the story.
“Okay Octopus, I won’t call you Octi anymore.” He raised a thumb to correct her makeup. He felt like a right mother hen, but he supposed it was worth the weird feeling for Via’s embarrassment.
Octavia raised an eyebrow. “I take it you’re dressed as...a cat?”
“And I thank you Auntie. I am sorry if I came across as ungrateful I am just...becoming stir crazy in leu of the Dark Lord’s return. I only wish it could happen sooner. I am so looking forward to serving him.” And he was! It was what he had been training for since he was very young. It was his purpose.
“So what you looking for in that book?” Martha asked her.
The day continued at the Malfoy's tent, Octavia finally finishing her book and Draco convincing her to cheer for Ireland at the match, when finally dusk had settled over the campsite. The air was alive with anticipation, and as Octavia witnessed, Draco was practically levitating in his seat. He was bouncing off the walls quizzing Octavia about her quidditch knowledge and filling up on chocolate, though he denied spending a lot of his time staring at the Viktor Krum poster, Octavia knew better.
Cheers were let out, hands were shaken and bets were settled. Draco looked practically euphoric in the aftermath, and continued to pester Octavia about complicated quidditch moves or "did you see that one part when-", and as much as Octavia liked her brother being happy, she was getting kind of sick of it.
She could probably be labelled as the most loyal to Voldemort, insanely so, and this insanity drove her to do one last goal in order to spite her sister and spouse. She wanted to avenge those who turned their backs on the all powerful Dark Lord as soon as the going got tough. So what he was dead? There were ways around that!
“But baby,” Blaise reacts to the nickname by practically melting, “you said you were comfortable with it. Would be a bit mean now. Wouldn’t it?” Theo asks, that damn pout. For once Octavia hates the puppy dog eyes with a venom.
“Yeah? What of it?” The two of his stared at him, daring him to admit to his discomfort. He blew a strand of hair out his eye with a huff.
"I already did in Fourth year, what more do you want?"
He hoped.

"What did you need me for Father?"
“Then go cuddle Blaise.
He explained what the champions would do when they were chosen, where they going, the goblet needed another minute
“Practice magic. I never want to fall behind. I want to be perfect.” He snickered.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Everyone ready?" He asked, face gleaming with excitement. "Minister - ready to go?"
Draco dragged himself to his feet and limped slightly. “That was almost as bad as the ferret incident.” He glared at Blaise. The three of them walked the short rest of the way to Madame Pomfrey’s. Or, two of them did. Draco gave in and let Blaise carry him again.
"Alright, enough!" Astoria says crossly, pulling them apart by the robes like she's scuffing kits. "Have

Pansy ducks her head down into her arms, as upset as he is, whispering, “Yeah, yeah, I know.”

“We’re on a truce,” Blaise declares, “Apparently.”
“That’s not what I meant!” Draco snaps, scrambling to get his books and parchment out of the way before they stomp all over them like the brainless trolls they are. “I don’t want people to find- Granger, if you drip water over my essay, I swear to Merlin I will
“Ambrosia! Famine!”
"And the fact that it'll be your dead boyfriend's corpse means nothing to you?" Finnigan changes his tune immediately, crossing his arms and glaring, sounding for all the world an offended new wife chiding her husband for forgetting their one-week anniversary of buying their first bed.
Draco jerks in surprise, because what, since when were these two
"Consider this: no," Draco replies, looking up at where Professor Binns has moved onto the sixth century wars. "And if you're going to stay here and annoy me, take my notes."
"You kinda are," A third-year says and Blaise stops checking his pulse to burst into laughter. "Luckily, he's just as bad, otherwise you'd be an embarrassment to the whole house."
"The Hufflepuff head of house said that he'd be-" Potter doesn't get any further than that, because Draco calmly sets his wand down on the table and then gracefully pounces clean across it and tackles him to the ground.
"-We thought you'd be able to decipher what language it was and save us a bit of time," Potter barrels on, squinting at the board, "What's after 'ruin'?"
"I NEVER WANTED THE FUCKING SPOTLIGHT," Potter roars, throwing the bag in his hand to the ground in anger. "I NEVER PUT MY NAME IN THAT RUSTY OLD CUP, I NEVER WANTED TO BE A CHAMPION, I NEVER WANTED TO TAKE PART IN THIS FUCK-ALL COMPETITION!"
sound.
"It was
"Someone turned Vince's legs into a mermaid tail," Draco replies and Professor McGonagall sighs and walks out of the classroom.
"Nothing," Potter says finally, and Draco checks the sky for flying whales or anything that would suggest he’s in an alternate dimension. Potter seems to understand what he's implies immediately even though he hasn’t said a word, and he narrows his eyes and thickens the air with the ozone of his magic in irritation, but only grits out, "Take a bath and rest. We meet at the Gryffindor tower at ten.”
"But how did they even get in the castle?" Potter frowns. "Dumbledore says at the very least the wards would have notified them if someone with the Dark Mark walked through them."
. Potter could go fuck himself.
By third period, he’s in a truly terrifying mood, not bothering to wait for anyone as he storms out of the classroom, head still throbbing from it's introduction to the bathroom tile and getting worse.
Granger whisper-shouts, looking such a mix of disgusted and confused that Draco can see Pansy choking back laughter.
He groans deep in his throat, but as he looks around at everyone else, there seems to be no help for it- he lets go of his broom and reaches out to bodily pry out his piece from the wall. It takes a bit of effort, and he nearly gags at the thought of the centuries-old muck that's gathering under his fingernails as he scrapes it off, but in the end he goes sprawling back as it comes free, and the spell on it dissolves, leaving Draco clutching a beautiful metal plate, embossed nifflers and jewels on one side, writing in Latin on the other.
"Wait, really?" She asks, sounding so unmistakably happy that everyone turns to stare at her. She practically runs over to Pansy. "I'm dyscalculic! Like, numbers are absolute
Potter scowls at him again. "I'm not that bloody incompetent."
“Is she a sixty year old
“Yeah, is there a time limit on the riddle, by the way?” Lavender Brown asks as the last of them casts their spell and flies up into the sky. “Like, can the other champions get to them first and get a head start?”
"I WAS
by the
“You’re such an asshole,” Potter says through gritted teeth. “What the fuck got shoved up your ass this morning?”
“I’m so sorry!” Blaise says, sounding mortified and panicked for probably the first time since Draco’s known him. He’s shining slightly as he pulls his hands off Granger and Weasley’s shoulders, both of whom are completely blissed out, staring into space with the dopey grins of people under the influence of a happy Veela. "Sorry, sorry, my bad!"
“Three,” some of them say and she rolls her eyes with a quite fantastic sneer.
"Fine with me," Draco mutters and flies away quickly. He very valiantly ignores the odd cold sense of loss that comes with finally getting rid of Potter, like preparing for a fight with a Devil's Snare that's invaded your front yard while your parents were out, arming yourself and the house-elves for a match to the death, and then finally finding out it was actually a bunch of manure spelled purple and covered in the pollen you're allergic to, leaving an irritating prickling sensation over your entire body for a week, the only thing that makes you feel less restless being almost falling into the fire to absorb its heat.
Murmurs of assent follow, and Potter stretches his hands in the air with a sigh, showing a sliver of skin as his shirt rises, because for some reason he does not wear the school robes after classes are done, like most of the Muggleborns in the school.

Madam Pince does a double-take when she sees them spread around the general area a few hours later, raising an eyebrow at them. They stare back, silent as owls, all of them concentrating too long and too hard on what they were reading to remember how to function as human beings, and she quickly seems to decide that it’s above her paygrade and wordlessly transfigures up a few beanbags for them before placing a key on the table and walking out of the library.
Draco, you heard how they were talking about us at the World Cup. My blood is worse than the worst of the Muggleborns, it's-"
"Wondering if you can kidnap and stash me away in a Body-Bind to lengthen the lifespan of darling Regina, yes, I see," Draco nods. "It won't work, by the way. I did not have the only blemishes on every single report card I've received be 'He talks too much in class', for the likes of

"This is of utmost fucking importance, so listen up, everyone," Weasley declares as they stand at the edge of the Lake with their brooms in hand. "No one can ever see us doing this."

fine.
"What are you doing here?" Finnigan demands when Draco finally succeeds and manages to get the paralyzed idiots he's with to the edge of where Potter has pushed a few tables together and left one side empty for them. The Gryffindors seemingly realize that at that exact moment, all of them looking over to Potter in betrayal, who ignores them so thoroughly Draco is slightly impressed.
can convince them, can you?" Potter snaps, putting his hands on his waist and moving closer. He smells of shampoo, the wildness of the forbidden forest and the enticing sparks of fire when you get close enough, possibly a side effect of the Firebolt. "Get them to listen to your every whim?"
The badly timed joke falls flat, but Blaise at least seems to be listening to him, face the slightest bit tilted his way. He continues, "And yes, Potter did tell me to apologize to- to Granger, but-" He takes a deep breath, "I truly don't know if blood purity is a very important thing anymore."
“And feel free to never return to that fashionably-challenged building once you see our dorm,” Draco tells her primly and Potter scoffs and rolls his eyes.
She sighs. “What do you jerks want?”
“Obviously, it was good alcohol, we’re not letting it go to waste,” Draco says, rolling his neck with a wince. Weasley had mistaken him for someone else at one point and hit him cheerfully on the back so hard that he’d gone stumbling into a table at a wrong angle. “You, house elf, get us something to eat.”
Everyone looks up at him immediately, the clattering of their spoons and plates coming to a halt, and more than a few conversations around them die out.
Potter opens his mouth, but Blaise smoothly interrupts him in his most calm tone, eyes firmly fixed on the Gryffindors who stare back suspiciously, all fifteen of them as tense as predators waiting to strike. "Draco darling, did you drag us all the way…
He snatches up Potter's bag and wand from the floor- His wand on the
, Malfoy?”
“What if it’s in the water?” Longbottom muses, and Draco has to bite back many choice words he’s not supposed to know.
Unfortunately his good mood barely has time to sink in, because a moment later as he rounds the corner someone crashes into him at full speed and nearly knocks them both to the ground.
"I thought you all knew so many languages," Potter smirks insufferably as he pulls out multiple books on Old English. "Not so useful after all, are you?"
"Where's my creature?" He demands immediately.
what the fuck you are, I don't care what
"Nevertheless, your name was still in the Goblet," Professor McGonagall sighs, although she looks slightly sympathetic. "How else can you explain that?"
Draco likes Sirius because he is also gay and trans and has the Vibes. Also i just think the wix should all fistfight each other a bit. Builds character.
“Until we find something better, it’s at least worth checking out,” Potter says, shrugging at her. “Malfoy, get those notes too, it had stuff about famines in it.”
like the Mudbloods and Muggleborns, how could you ever think-"
Potter goes down with a yelp, and Draco smiles even as people around him start yelling. Except everyone falls silent when Potter catches himself midway down and Draco looks around in confusion before looking behind him and realizing that parts of the Viaduct suddenly start glowing different colors.
Draco clears his throat, busy resorting to desperately begging his body to stay under control, and says coolly, "Well, good. Maybe you'll finally pick up on some useful knowledge and vocabulary skills then."
, not yell out the first bull-headed sentence that comes to mind; no teacher is going to listen to you that way. Then again, you are a Gryffindor, so I suppose the curse of bull-headedness is incurable."
harder to fool his Slytherins than it is the teachers and the Gryffindors- you don’t grow up playing cards and stealing each other’s clothes and convincing each other’s parents that they’re at each other’s Manors while secretly trying to fly to Switzerland to see the Aurora Borealis without knowing everyone’s tells and tics when they’re lying.
Potter glares. "You're supposed to be wearing a raincoat."

“Are you insane?” He demands when he gets his voice back, wondering how the hell Potter plans to live past nineteen if he's going to constantly pull off stunts like that without any regard for personal safety. “Are you

Blaise turns around and buries his face into Draco's thighs. It would be normal, if his fingers weren't as tense as they were, betraying the other's apprehension. "Did you mean it when you said you no longer cared about blood purity?"
Hannah Abbott barks out a loud laugh, grinning at Pansy. "Well, you got us there."

"Be that as it may," Professor Spout pipes up. "The Goblet of Fire, no matter if it's been tampered with or not, is a binding artifact. You cannot back out once chosen."
"But if you put in snake scales, it'll react with the crushed aconite!" She exclaims in distress.
“For the last

Granger looks ready to faint into the lake in shock. "
"Oh, wow," Potter stumbles back in fake shock, putting a hand on his chest. "You? Admitting you were wrong?" He puts a rough, calloused hand to Draco's forehead and says in the most mockingly caring tone Draco has ever heard, "Are you feeling okay, dear? Need to see Pomfrey?"
“Shut up, Weasley.”
Potter rolls his eyes, "Obviously not. But we have no idea what the riddle they've given us means and we need your help."
"What?" He thinks he hears from behind him, but he just rolls his eyes and walks off to hide the fact that he was doing it
Draco fumes and wishes his arms hurt less so he could gesture them around angrily to make his point. "I am

actually dyslexic."
"Oh come on, it can't have hurt that badly," He snaps, pinning the unruly hands down, collapsing onto Blaise with his full body weight and moving in close for some aggressive cuddling.
, I am not-”
"We'll work out a schedule," Potter grins as he undoes the silencing charm on her, and she chirps at Draco as he folds the notes properly and puts them in his bag. "Although, there is one condition, though."
"I'm just saying, you could have found them speaking in Irish hot!" Astoria protests, though at a much lower volume than before.
Finnigan’s mouth falls open, everyone around him choking and sputtering because
"I called him a stick," Crabbe explains and Goyle snorts and gestures for Draco to hand him over. "A small, little stick."
"Ingrates!" He announces, and Potter growls at him even as it successfully captures everyone's attention.
"Dinosaurs came in all sizes," Potter says, so confidently that Draco's eyes slide to him without his permission. He's staring intensely at the creature preening under Draco's hand, running his fingers over her long cerulean tail idly. "At the peak of their evolution, there were dinosaurs the size of chickens and the size of small buildings- with hundreds of variations in shapes and species. The main consensus is that they looked like a mixture of birds and reptiles, so technically this one here can classify as a dinosaur, even if fossils exactly like hers don’t exist. Isn’t that right, Brenda?” he coos down at her, “Aren’t you the most unique creature in the world?”
"I wasn't lying," Draco blurts out and Blaise goes silent and still. "I-" He racks his brains, "-made a Muggle friend over the holidays, when I was going out to Diagon Alley and terrifyingly enough, he didn't seem to be any stupider than the lot of you."
"I'm so confused," Parkinson wails, hanging off of him like an overgrown sloth. Forget Quidditch training, he was going to end up built like a bodybuilder just by lugging all his stupid heavy friends around this bloody school all day.
Weasley cries out and Granger narrows her eyes at the last of their trio.

Draco deflates and looks at her. She probably needs that, doesn't she? "Fine, but I'm taking her during the day, then."
There's something so firm and brittle in his voice that Draco doesn't argue. "What-" He starts, then decides he doesn't care and starts casting again. "What will I get out of it?"
When he finally manages to compose himself and look over, Potter is aiming a hundred-watt smile at him, whole face lit up with joy, blinding in its intensity. Draco stumbles a bit over his robes as he comes to a halt and Potter somehow gets
is Potter approaching him and aiming the softest smile at Lucina in his arms, petting her head with a single finger. “Sleep well, Amy. If Malfoy or any of the Slytherins give you trouble, just fly over to our tower, hm?”
“I already checked there,” Potter follows him up and says right into his ear. “There’s nothing to be found.”
There’s a sharp intake of breath from around the table and Draco hesitates. He curls his fingers over the bird-dragon’s little head and his voice drops as he remembers the terrifying chill of the hooded figure’s presence, the pervasive feeling of
"Uh huh," Draco says, dazed, feeling rather like he's been staring at the sun for too long. "Sure."
"So what, I do the
"Maybe I would have had time to, if you didn't stride along like your underpants were on fire," Potter snaps.
Draco surprises them both by laughing, amused, cutting off almost immediately, staring at Potter in mutual horror.
He remembers Blaise at ten, brown-white-grey wings splayed around him, sitting on the floor and crying after he'd saved himself from falling off his broom and not responding to any of their worried yelling and pleading until his mother rushed over to them and explained what Veela were. He remembers how scared Blaise had looked that day when they found out about his wings, can’t remember what expressions have been on his face when they talked about Purebloods and Muggles ever since.
“But- it doesn’t include
"I don't know if you hit your head on your way into bed last night and it was the last straw for even
Although, now that Draco thinks about it, why the fuck did Blaise run off in the end? He tries to recollect what he’d said-
“Plus we- we haven’t finished-” Granger waves a hand morosely at all the books strewn over the table, then slumps back down against Astoria and sniffles, apparently a sad drunk.
, when I'm just as much of a Mudblood as Granger is!"
“And the teachers also say not to cheat in exams," Pansy replies testily. "People still do that, don't they?"
Also, yes, I did get carried away with the Theo/Greg subplot. I do not control this story- it controls me.
I didn't ever think of that," Astoria cackles next to him, "Oh
Potter rolls his eyes and Draco moves the inkwell out of the way right before his elbow would have knocked it over. "Yeah, yeah, alright you great bloody show-off. We get it, you all like posh stuff and old things."
They walk to the end of the hallway, at the base of the Gryffindor tower, and lean against the railing to look out at the night sky.
Her eyes widen, as do everyone’s at the table, and he adds quickly, “There are much better things to insult you about- I can name ten right now- but blood purity shouldn’t have been one of them.”
Draco takes a long breath to fortify himself, thinking up a few arguments. Normally, he wouldn't go into such a situation without a plan of attack and at least three back-up ones and five ways to exit in a dignified manner, but Potter always
“Shorts will be fine!”
His thoughts were impeded by one large Blaise Zabini crashing through his curtains next to him, crushing his leg in the process.
Harry took it. "Friends." The shook on it.
"We have that same issue with Gryffindor. With anywhere in this castle really. It's so big! What does your schedule look like?" Draco internally sighed in relief. She hadn't forgotten about him!
After a moment she walks round the corner and acts surprised.
"Hiya Luna, how are you?" I greeted in return, giving her a lazy grin.
"I think it means combat or duel. Pretty cool name for an owl. The family owl I'm allowed to use is called Pluto. He's an Eurasian Eagle-Owl. Very big and can carry large packages, but it's quite painful if he lands on your shoulder. And he's no where as pretty as yours." Draco says as he helps Harry with piling their luggage in the compartment. Once they'd piled all of their suitcases and things under the seats, they sat down. On instinct, Draco straightened his back and locked his knees, keeping his hands neatly on his lap.
“Are you friends with her?”
Nott glared and walked off angrily. Draco scowled after him.
“Oh yeah, I’m kidnapping you. I don’t care what you think, any place would be better for you than here. Gives me the creeps personally.” Sirius shivered. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Malfoy!" Potter and Granger repeated louder while Weasley sounded like he was having an asthma attack.
“What an awful acronym. For the promotion of elfish welfare? Trust Granger to bother herself with something like that. They enjoy serving!”
"And me! I want to learn how to levitate a greater object!" Hermione added. Draco smiled.
He'd just need to study. Get the best grades in the class. Be perfect in academics. Deep down he knew it wouldn't be enough to abide by his father, but mentally stuck to that plan.
They continued walking until they were in the heart of the wood.
"RAVENCLAW!"
It was then that Draco noticed a tapping on his right shoulder. He turned around to see the first Ravenclaw boy, Terry, sitting by his side. At the sudden eye contact Terry smiled at him and put two thumbs up, and Draco couldn't help but feel endeared. Draco breathed in deeply and gave Terry two shaky thumbs up in return. At this, his grin grew wider. An applause from a sorting Draco didn't pay attention to rang out and Draco watched as Terry dropped his thumbs up to cover his ears. Draco, still not handling the noise great either, copied Terry. Terry smiled and him wordlessly and focused his gaze onto the sorting.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making," he spoke in a quiet tone, pulling in the audience to hear. An effortless bid for control. "As there is little foolish wand-waving here," Draco saw Anthony scowl, "many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses...I can even teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death – if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach." Draco had to stop himself from snorting at sheer dramatics of the speech. He exchanged a look with Michael and saw he felt the same. He bit his lip.
"Ugh, fiiiiiiiiiiiiinnneee...but next year I'm free to go wild? Right?"
“Why are you helping out Potter anyway?” Pansy asked him, dragging the two from their odd little conversation.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
“That yelling was you? Who was the other one?”
“You’d better. Being indebted to you feels like torture and I’d rather end it as soon as possible.” With that last word, he turned back to his Skrewt.
"And what else?"
"Hey, wake up kid," Draco felt a shaking on his shoulder. Draco batted it away with tired limbs. "Wake up." He opened his eyes a slit to see Meredith looking at him.
“No.”
Martha began digging through her trunk. “Like a makeover! To style our hair real pretty, or to put on a bit of classy makeup. To style our uniforms! A makeover always cheers me up, and I’ve gotten real good at using a hair curler!” She pulled out a funny looking contraption. Octavia pulled away from it slightly.
After ten minutes of experiencing the agony of climbing the spiral staircase late at night, the boys came up to the top of the tower. Here there were three blue doorways with miniture eagles on the doorknobs, as well as all their luggage. Draco grabbed his suitcases and turned to Terry.
"Thanks. Her name is Hedwig."
His stupid cousin was asleep on one of the sofas, probably asleep from keeping guard. What a moron.
"C-can I ask you something?" Draco said hesitantly.
After they both ate their ‘barely acceptable but not worth killing Kreacher over’ soup, Aunt Bella went right into birthday talk.
The mother and the daughter looked to be bickering slightly, while the twins appeared to be 'consoling' the nervous boy, not very well by how his expression was growing more fearful.
“Well that was...something.”
Draco raised his eyebrow higher. “Well from what I haven’t heard about you from Via, you’re unimportant.” Both girls flushed.
“Why Malfoy, does this happen to be a romantic sort of novel?” Potter continued to tease.
Pansy gasped. “There was a girl involved!” Draco spluttered.
Set Gryffindors apart;
“Hah, my brother used to have ringlets. The curliest blonde hair you’d ever seen. Many people thought he was my older sister!” Said Octavia, grinning.
“Well I’m sorry I cared-“
It was a flash of bright purple, wedged in between some plainer, more subdued tones of fabric on a rack. Like a moth to a lamp, she was drawn to it, grabbing Draco's wrist and dragging him to the rack.
“Oh Draco, as smart as you are, you can be so stupid.” She poked his nose again condescendingly. “Of course I wish you could darling, but everything is incredibly delicate at the moment. And you won’t even be needing to leave anyway, as I have more brilliant news!” She rose her arms victoriously. “Once the Dark Lord is reborn, we will be using Grimmauld as the official base of operations. Just imagine it Draco, the Dark Lord himself and all of his followers, in our own home!” She smiled dreamily. “The stars are aligning.”
"That's amazing! I wish I had siblings!" Draco said quite loudly. Terry flinched at the sudden volume and the tapping to his leg carried on. Draco smiled awkwardly as an apology. He didn't think Terry got the message he was trying to convey.
"Oh, yeah, they definitely do. My cousin always had piles and piles of presents for Christmas and his birthday. I...didn't. Usually. I mean it's fine, I don't deserve them anyway, and Hagrid shouldn't have spent money on it, I could have paid, it would have been fine but he insisted...I should probably pay him back when I see him again he shouldn't have worried..."
“Magnus Libro De Plantis Quod Augendam Amor?” He read the title to Potter.
“If it’s a way to stop people being hostile to Harry then yes.” Her eyes met Draco’s. “Tell me the plan.”
“Harry Potter.”
"So Potter, back to the castle it is? I expect Granger and the Weasel will be missing their little Golden boy."
Octavia debated with herself with a few seconds before deciding to go after him. She had a lot of questions about him. He was becoming friends with her older brother, she better at least know that he’s not going to mess. Or that if he does, he knows he’s going to get the hexing of his life.
In one corner there was a gathering of first and second years, all wearing fake vampire teeth or fake blood, pulling horrid faces at each other and pretending to turn each other into vampires. It was frightfully inaccurate to what actual vampires were like, but he supposed it looked...fun.
"Dragons are cooler than octopuses. Just facts, sorry Octi."
“Oi! Potter!” He snapped his fingers in front of the speccy git’s face. His eyes focused again.
“Doesn’t matter. You look tired.” He commented.
Potter sighted himself again and looked at Draco oddly.
"Nonsense! I'm sure you are! First, let's check your pronounciation. Tell me the spell name." Draco go right down to business. On the other table, Hermione sat down and began practicing it herself on heavier items.
“You mean the rumours are true?” Pansy giggled a bit in shock.
By this point it was about 10 o'clock, so we could hear some people discussing plans out in the hallway. We came out of the door as some sort of weird double act, both sporting messy black hair and hoodies, yet I still felt below the mark standing next to Malfoy, his stupid perfect posture and stupid unwrinkled clothes and stupid STUPID lack of eyebags.
"Hey, do you wanna go explore? I'm getting bored." Draco shook his head.
"Wow then, real party animals down in Slytherin."
“And then you’ll stick your Viktor Krum poster to a plain shirt. Boom! Veela Cheerleader costume!” She levelled his gaze at her.
"Well I doubt Hogwarts would want a Slytherin champion anyway. We're all 'evil'." Greg scowled disappointedly.
“Operimentum.” He cast and the bruise seemed to fade. It still hurt, but at least it wasn’t visible anymore.
He avoided any extra conversation with Potter by keeping at least two steps ahead of him on the journey back, and being sure to shush him every time he even thought of speaking so as not to alert Filch or Peeves. This technique guaranteed making it back to the dorm entrance without exchanging a single word.
"Stop! STOP! That's my son!" He heard the voice of Mr Weasley call out from behind him.
"You can't be serious Lucius-" Narcissa tried.
"You do know how to compliment someone." Draco rolled his eyes at her sourly, going back into the changing rooms. He returned with all his items, ready to go to the till to buy. It was then that Octavia spotted something out of the corner of her eye.
“The ferret incident wasn’t very...” Potter trailed off.
“Ugh. I did NOT expect that kiss to be that bad!” Pansy said out loud, much to everyone who was watching’s hilarity as they laughed. Draco nodded in agreement.
Blaise leant towards Draco. “Who ever said anything about eloping? Our ceremony shall be loud and proud.” He embraced Pansy and rested his head on hers.
She trained herself rigorously in chess until she was the very best in Slytherin. Those were her guaranteed wins. Ones which she was certain in.
“I ‘ope ‘e will be mon ami!”
"Ah, so nice to see two siblings have wands with something in common. Usually a sign that their bond is very strong." Octavia beamed.
This was the second ‘movie’ they were watching, the first one being Ghost Busters, but the experience was still very odd and wonderful.
“Pity mostly. This poor little orphan boy lost a best friend to jealousy and now most of the school hates him. Not to mention he’s entered in a death tournament against Viktor Krum, Diggory and Delacour as an ickle tween.” He shrugged. “Even monsters can be moved by the saddest sob stories.”
Where they are just and loyal,
Draco was rolling a trolley down King's Cross, looking up at the platforms as he went. He was searching for the plastic board that would say Platform 9 and Platform 10. He tried to remember what his father had told him.
Pansy scrunched her nose at the nickname. “Since you’re sooooo talented and amazing at everything and good at magic-“
I hope you enjoyed the chapter! The next one will be posted a week from now, so look out for that. If you enjoyed then please leave a kudo and comments are just so dang appreciated they make my day! Feel free to ask any questions and I may add some art to the next chapter.
The Sorting Hat can't see,
As they entered the top box, they found it to already be quite crowded, full of a large redheaded family.
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
His right hand rolled up his sleeve, revealing his pale white forearm.
overly tough on himself. And I don’t like it when my baby boy treats himself wrong.” He clutches his heart and looks up dramatically. “He deserves someone who’ll treat him right. Like Potter. Or that Durmstrang boy uhhh...what is his name...Borislav! He seems to dote on Draco.”
He thought oddly for a moment what it would be like to die there, to go to sleep in the snow and not wake up. To close his eyes and let the frost take him.
“Sounds perfect. I’m going to go change clothes. I’ll be back soon.” She blew him a kiss before staggering away to her dorm. He knew he wouldn’t be back soon. She took almost as long as him to get ready. He continued to clean.
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
“Yeah Draco, it seems perfectly innocent, and, lets all be honest, Draco isn’t the type to have a secret snog or shag.” Draco went even redder, a few Octavia didn’t know was possible. He then gave a sad attempt to kick Blaise in the groin.
He had heard things from Aunt Bella’s mutterings about a great resistance, and how that made every plan they seemed to gather pointless. He already didn’t like this Harry Potter character.
"So I asked Professor Snape about your progress in Slytherin, and do you know what he said?" Draco clenched his fists tighter. "He said that you weren't in his house. That you were in RAVENCLAW." His father's voice boomed. This entire time the Howler hadn't howled as much as it talked to him. Dracos suspected this was going to stop very soon. "DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE TO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US DRACO?! IT MEANS A LINEAGE THAT HAS LASTED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS, SINCE HOGWARTS FIRST BEGAN, IS BROKEN! BECAUSE OF YOUR REPULSIVE LOVE OF BOOKS. I ALWAYS KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED YOUR BLATHERING ABOUT BOOKS WHEN IT BEGAN! I WAS TOO LENIENT WITH YOU! I SHOULD HAVE BEAT IT OUT OF YOU WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE!" The calm was gone. The control was gone. Everything was gone. Draco could practically feel the books slamming onto his head. "BUT NOW YOU'VE DISHONOURED YOUR FAMILY, HAVE DISSAPOINTED YOUR ANCESTORS AND HAVE DISOBEYED ME! YOU HAVE EVEN DISHONOURED SALAZAR SLYTHERIN HIMSELF! THE MAFLOY FAMILY HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN SLYTHERIN, THEY HAVE BEEN CUNNING, THEY HAVE BEEN AMBITIOUS, THEY HAVE BEEN SHREWD, ACHIEVMENT ORIENTED AND ESPECIALLY STRONG LEADERS! AND NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE NONE OF THOSE THINGS!" Draco's eyes welled up. He was nothing, he'd done everything wrong, he was a failure, he was a Ravenclaw, he wasn't a Malfoy, he was nothing-
“Ugh, shut up. Continue.”
“Am I a ferret?!” He shrieked but it only came out as a series of small dooks.
“And the Harry Potter, he is friends with Hermy-own-ee?” Draco stifled his amusement at the mispronunciation.
New game! Take a shot every time Draco calls something stupid! (Jk I not want you to get alcohol poisoning).
"Huh, I guess Bulgaria brought along Veela." He noted neutrally.
Then of course her beloved brother woke up with a hangover, like the stupid drunk he was.
Draco chuckled. “I never cursed Potter, Moody just thought I did. That’s why he transfigured me into a ferret. And Octavia did threaten to curse Moody, my knight in shining armour.” He lifted his head up and smiled at he and she blushed happily.
“What are you doing?” Potter asked.
"Okay then." He grabbed onto his trolley and looked at the barrier, getting ready. Much like he remembered the confident older boy do so, he marched up to it. He saw the brick getting closer and closer, but he pushed forward proudly, faster and faster and -
"This here is a MALFOY," he spat, shaking Draco again. "And his father is a Death Eater. And the Dark Mark appeared right where this

Party aftermath, Krum finds out about Hermione, and Octavia has shenanigans.
“Let us say zat boys are not really my type.” She winked and he chuckled.
“It’s that or you’ll have to torture it out of me. Final offer.” This intruder seemed to have great confidence for someone in their situation. Draco grimaced to himself slightly. He would hate to have to torture somebody, especially the first person he’s met since...forever. He sighed.
"Hold on, why did you go shopping with Harry?! Why would you buy clothes and hair stuff for him? Do you feel guilty or something? Or is that part of your parole as a death eater?" Malfoy's eyes turned dangerous and I shifted away imperceptibly, slowly getting out of reach of where his clenched fists might go flying.
“Sure.” Before the table would run out of booze, Draco filled two white plastic cups with wine and passed one to Potter. Potter looked surprised yet grateful.
“Stop looking at me with pity, I don’t need it. It’s perfectly normal.”
It all seemed to be solved when Viktor said, “Aleksander! Dobromir! Borislav! Stop the attempts to seduce Drako! He is a friend and you are causing uncomfort!” Draco didn’t even mind that Viktor mispronounced his name, a detail he would have stressed over plenty any other time, instead choosing to look up at his prince in shaggy furs adoringly.
“Our little octopus!” Draco fake sobs.
“Are you alright?” Potter asked him as he ran up to him. Draco brushed the dirt from his clothes.
They were wearing many furs and came in two lines, one of girls, and one of boys. Some looked far older than the Beauxbatons, being both taller and broader, reminding Octavia of Greg and Vince. The man leading them was who Octavia guessed was headmaster Karkaroff, and some stilted banter with Dumbledore confirmed it.
"Far too ostentatious for a Malfoy, right?"
"I'm not sure, I just saw the name in A History Of Magic. It sounded nice."
He drove the motorcycle for a couple hundred metres before taking off. It had gotten very dark by this point, so it wasn’t as dangerous as beforehand. He still risked a couple glances towards the sidecar to check the kid hadn’t jumped or anything else crazy like that.
As suspected, it was a boring class. Since it was the first lesson of the year, it was merely a recap of what they’d learnt last year, with sparce activities. Draco remembered everything from last year anyway, and so burnt through the work assigned. He took out one of his sugar quills and chewed on the end of it absentmindedly, doodling on a sheet of paper. In the doodle, he was flying on his broom against Victor Krum. He then the charmed the paper to make him do a Wronski Feint. He folded it into a paper crane.
“What, no! He didn’t do anything!”
He was completely drained and held Cushion tightly as he regained his breath. He felt like being sick.
He’d never had his face held like this before, being the sole attention for the one person he constantly bothered for such validation. And even though Potter was squinting slightly, Draco still knew the exact shade of Potter’s eyes.
“Hey Via.” He greets, sandwiched between the two drama queens.
"How was Potions?" Hermione asked him once they were face to face.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
"Well then I guess I'm in trouble, if our local fashionista chose them out." Blaise smirked.
Stress wasn't a good look for him. He was used to feeling bored or cool. Being very stressed made him feel all off kilter. But he put on a brave face for Octavia and tried to push his paranoia down. He absolutely refused to be acting like Mad Eye Moody of all people!
Oh how he wished he could.
"I don't know why the Weasleys are here, but surprise, the annoying ginger is in the family of annoying gingers. Granger is his girlfriend or something, and Potter is too famous not to be the top box, I suppose. They're all the 'Gryffindor Golden Trio', so if you hear something big happened in Hogwarts, like a teacher got fired or killed, or the school's closing down, or a murderer's on the loose, it probably had something to do with those three."
He would be the best Ravenclaw a Malfoy could be!
“I think calling me Octi is bad enough.” Octavia rolls her eyes. At a concerned look from her boys Greg and Vince, she takes it back. “Not from you two! I don’t mind when my favourite brothers call me it. Just when it’s these three awful ones.”
“Ve are all staying on the ship, I am thinking. There is a lot of space.” Draco hummed interestedly and continued to try and discuss everything. The tournament, dark magic, the subjects at Durmstrang, and Bulgaria. The last topic got Viktor very passionate to talk. He was obviously very passionate about his homeland and in school pride. All this time Draco tried not to be obvious as he gazed at the other boy. It
"Wingardium Leviosa!" The boy tried to cast the spell.
"Well for as long as you're shorter than you're brother, you'll always be mini Malfoy to us!" The other Weasley-boy-(possibly-twin) told her.
There on the Slytherin sofa, with Draco asleep and nuzzling into him, was boy wonder Harry Potter.
“You alright? You look a little shaken.” She asked innocently. Blaise shrugs it off.
His eyes drifted from his own reflection to be locked on mine. His eyes widened partially, but other than that his face kept a perfect neutral mask. He picked up his wand and muttered "Finite Incantatem", and all the items which were active gently floated back onto the counter. He pulled out his earphones before turning the music off, so I could hear a gentle "Ain't nothing but a heart break..." before he put them away.
“Alright Granger, I don’t see how it concerns you.” He picked up a bottle and poked Potter in the chest with it. Then he stopped and narrowed his eyes. “Unless you’re going to tell?”
“I vasn’t, and I hadn’t had a plan yet. I think I vill adjourn to the library. Hogwarts has one?” Draco nodded, and nearly got up with Viktor.
It looked so different. It was neat. Neat and tidy. Clean. No longer knotted.
Then he spotted the ice cream shop.
A few second passed as the tap ran before Blaise heard a loud squeal.
“Yeah...maybe...” he replied weakly, breathing in deeply. He tried to take another step, but the bad leg gave out on him, again.
"Well then class, it is now time for break. You have 20 minutes until your next lessons. I can't wait to see you all again!" Professor Flitwick said, dismissing them all. "And another well done to you Mr Malfoy, great work!" He smiled as he put away the register.
The ink from his arm was gone, but it still felt tainted. He’d washed it with the school taps for thirty minutes straight, and had used about a billion cleaning charms, but no matter how red raw his arm was scrubbed, he still felt as if there was a dark mark there.
They were greeted on the front steps by Professor McGonagall. She gave them a speech on Hogwarts and the Sorting Ceremony, before shoving them all into an empty chamber off the hall. Octavia fiddled with her fingers subconsciously and took a deep breath. She'd be fine either way. There was no pressure, just like Draco had said. It didn't matter.
"Pansy, stop laughing, it's not that funny." Malfoy's voice whined from the wardrobe. Pansy responded with bursting into cackles most befitting for a witch.
"I couldn't pay for the ice cream." She shook her head, her golden hair flowing this way and that.
"The wizarding world is weird."
"Do you mind if I ask what's going on with your mum? I mean- obviously I don't believe what Ron said on the train, but I saw her in Diagon Alley and it just...it looked more like you were the parent." Harry looked at him imploringly, begging him to answer.
“I did get a little idea a while ago, something I think would annoy you.” Potter gave him a look and Draco shrugged. “I wasn’t going to do it, obviously, it’s just a habit. But maybe now we can use the plan as an advantage.” He bit his thumb as he thought. “Do you know anyone who owns a badge presser?”
He continued to push Blaise, easing him onto his back before pinning him to the bed between Draco’s legs.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Draco was thrown off at the...nice tone? And his smirk fell slightly.
“A bit of warning next time please!” Sirius told him, but saw the kid try and hide a smirk. What a smug little bitch.
After Martha was done combing through Octavia’s hair, she asked Octavia to do the same for her. The roles didn’t switch exactly though, as Martha still continued to word vomit while Octavia listened. She didn’t mind. Draco always going on about Potter had gotten her well used to just sitting back and listening. Besides, Martha’s stories were far more interesting.
“Awwww, you guys match? That’s so adorable!” Pansy squealed at the two of them. Greg grinned brightly.
The sorting ceremony commenced, and although they were so few in numbers, there was quite a bid of indecisiveness between houses. They were pretty evenly split between the them, though I noticed any first years who got put in Slytherin got very little applause, and even some booing from other houses, but was quickly shushed by McGonagall. I couldn't help but feel bad for them. One girl, Amy Gates, who was put into Slytherin started crying and saying that she didn't want to be evil, and had to be coaxed to the table by a Slytherin Prefect.
"Wingardium Leviosa." The feather shifted, and then began to float upwards. It reached a foot off the table before Harry dropped it. "I did it! How did you know?" He asked Draco excitedly, his face going close to Draco's.
The cold wetness continued to seep through his coat.
"That washes you out, try black?"
“I’m smoking hot. Breathtaking even. When I’m older I could be the highest class prostitute, but I won’t. It’ll be a great loss for the sex work community worldwide. Highly mourned.”
"I mean we have Arithmancy which I suppose deals with numeracy in a sense, but is more focused around Divination. All wizard children learnt about what you would consider the basic muggle subjects from a young age, and then we drop them when we come to Hogwarts."
He was invested in the drama of the book, how the leads had once again reunited after being apart for so long. Their parents disapproved, but they rebelled regardless to be with each other.
“Hmm?” Draco hummed, looking to where she pointed. “Oh that? That’s just my project I’m working on. They’re not finished yet.” He closed the box with his hand.
"Hagrid!"
So yeah that was chapter two I hope you enjoyed it! By the way the password for the door was just 'Open Sesame' in Latin if you were wondering. I hope I can update ASAP so leave a comment and a kudo if you liked it and want to continue reading. Until next time, ba bye!
“Another project,” Pansy gasps, “tell us what it is.” She sits beside the box.
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
They sat down in the remaining seats, seeming to be pretty split in the middle via house. Draco sat near the front in the middle of Pansy and Blaise. Waiting for Professor Moody come in. Draco took out his textbook almost robotically, flipping it to the first page and reading over the introductory notes. He hated that he gave Moody this much power, but fuck him, he was kind of scared. Anyone who was willing to transfigure a student without hesitation shouldn’t be a teacher. Or should at least get their head checked.
“I’ll be asking you questions later.” He told it, though he doubt it heard. The wind took away his voice as he flew through the night.
“Wow. You are definitely drunk.” Blaise told him.
She wasn’t used to losing.
He thinks that being quiet is the best part of his moments. Means that other people get a break. He ought to have his brain stop working more often.
But they had a terrible secret...they loved each other! Both being men, this was looked down upon by muggles, so they had to hide this from their town. Ordinarily the wizarding community would be fine with it, but they were going through a terrible drop in the wizarding population, and needed new magical children as soon as possible. Both being great wizards, they needed to give on their genes to the next generation, and so could not be together.
“I’m not pretty.” He muttered darkly. Pansy put a finger on his lip to shush him.
He opened up The Sorting Ceremony's Sanctity to the first page and began reading. It had a lot of repetition from the last book, on the origins and house traits and whatnot, but soon began to get onto the topic Draco needed. By the 44th page Draco had found what he was looking for, the sacred chapter on possible sorting hat mistakes. His eyelids were heavy but he still turned the page. He needed to get into Slytherin. Just one more page. Just one more...
"Which gnome stand?"
"Wait, mate, he might try to hex you. I'll go with." Weasley tried to intervene, but was stopped by Potter.
“You’ll find out tonight at the party. See ya!” They moved on back to their dorms. Draco shook his head.
“What about a werewolf?” Pansy asked. Draco made a face.
“Stop changing the subject. The subject is on Greg and Vince being totally into each other.”
By the time we'd gotten to Hogsmeade it was 11 o'clock. The village was very quiet and the sky was cloudy. I looked over to "Tom", who had pulled the drawstring of his hood a little tighter, lowering his head slightly, eyes darting about. I smiled and tugged on his arm.
“But you weren’t!” Octavia was getting desperate.
"Well, what are you doing near my room, Potter? And please move to the side a bit so I don't bury you in my luggage. I don't think it would be the ideal way to go after all you've been through, don't you think Chosen One?" I nodded dumbly an stepped closer to the wall as he examined the door names.
Because even though he hasn’t lived it yet, and is so deep in his own denial, he understands that he can’t do anything about those feelings. He won’t let himself get crushed and fall of the tracks. He won’t let Potter break him.
“You see, I can’t though. Because you’re threatening to tell someone? Remember?” Potter looked puzzled.
“I love them so much but I’m done with their drama. They’ve been going at each other for days. I’m kind of relieved it finally reached a breaking point.” He sighs again. “That sounds kind of mean but whatever. Those drama queens need to talk it out properly.” Octavia snorts.
I'd picked out a green T-shirt, a maroon hoodie, an average pair of blue jeans and a pair of blue trainers. All brand new. All mine.
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
"Draco!" Another voice called. A voice that was familiar.
It felt
“Hello, uh, girls?” Granger greeted them with a small wave. Draco was about to add another comment before he was interrupted by a loud squeal.
“Cry about it nerd.” Draco ruffles her hair. She scowls at him.
“You wanna know a secret?” Draco interrupted him.
It was scarcely a caress, it was such a small and insignificant movement as he held Draco’s face, but Draco could have sworn he was about to break down as soon as it happened.
She was Pansy Parkinson. Draco’s right hand woman, the theorised girlfriend, the Slytherin princess.
"Yeah, definitely. In the library."
"Hey! You were in my boat! Octavia, right?" Martha greeted her happily.
But Potter is taking back his glasses and putting them back on and moving away while Draco is yearning to move back towards him and to grab his collar and do what every romantic protagonist does and kiss him fiercely.
She was interrupted by a large door swinging open. On the other side of it was a tall, harsh looking woman in emerald green robes. She had black hair, a pointed hat and a stern face. She was all sharp edges and had an presence that demanded respect.
Only commit to things when you know they’ll benefit you.
"U-um, yeah I-I'm fine." Damn his stuttering.
“It seems so. Lets save him. He’s in the boys dorm.” Pansy took Octavia’s arm.
"-that's not even including the incredible medicinal properties of crocodile vines, though the reason they aren't used as much in potions is because of the sheer mass needed for a proper reaction. They're very rare, and subsequently very expensive, as they can only be found in specific areas of the Amazon, although I heard the scientist Millie Fensworth is learning how to grow them in captivity. Isn't that great?! Just imagine what-" The other three boys had tuned him out by then. Terry looked oddly calm, and hadn't had a physical reaction for the entire lesson. Draco looked over to him, and realised that he was now holding Anthony's hand. The position of his wrist looked a bit uncomfortable, but Anthony looked to be okay with it.
“Why are you in Grimmauld place? And if you’re the Malfoy kid, why can I get through the wards? I would think that you’d be considered ‘precious goods’.”
“Potter.”
“Tell me something I don’t know. Now go.” He pushed her away and she waved goodbye in a huff. As soon as she left Blaise slid next to him.
Pansy had gone home for the holidays, and and selfish as it had been, Draco couldn’t stand returning to Malfoy Manor so soon. Even for mother, everything was too painful, and he didn’t want to spend the holidays having panic attacks and living it all in a blur.
"Huh. Cool." Michael responded simply. "Thanks for sharing buddy." He smiled. "So back to the evil greasy haired topic, Snape. Why must we call for his downfall Anthony?" His voiced raised in a dramatic fashion.
So I slept.
"I'm okay. Me and Father were just playing today and it got a bit out of hand." He lied smoothly. He didn't want to fill her mind with troubles when she was in this fragile state. Her hand was soft and caring as she held onto his, so he gave hers a quick squeeze. She'd be better soon. He just had to help.
“The uh, the person is awake...” the boy tells him. Sirius looks at him sleepily and then turns to Draco. His eyebrows raise.
It really was an ugly cat.
“Or you could just leave and I'll never think of you again. I’m trying to do it right now.” The kid closed his eyes.
Draco coughed as he felt she was gong off topic. “So when I turn eighteen, I...don’t get to leave?”
“What are you doing, boy, class hasn’t ended yet-“ Draco ignored Moody’s protests and left.
He gasped at me dramatically. "You shall NOT bring that event up in or out of my presence ever again, you hear me. That was a hallucination nothing more. A dream, a nightmare, it didn't happen. Never." I laughed at his denial and relaxed into the comfy atmosphere that was in the room. "Or at least, don't bring it up unless you want me to bring up your Sixth year stalking." He continued and I could feel my face heating up.
”Hello Harry!" An airy and delighted voice greeted me from behind. I leaned back over the back of the sofa to see Luna smiling at me sweetly, knitting needles and wool in hand.
"Thanks."
"Well, why did you call me her name?" Hermione prompted.
“It’s really not a big deal Pansy, I don’t know why you’re so obsessed-“
The silence was broken  by what sounded like a spell being uttered. Draco covered Octavia on instinct.
Octavia snorted and crossed her arms. “You do realise that you’re the only one who really cares about that, right?” Draco stuck his tongue out tiredly at her and shakily rose to his feet, a heavy pounding in his head.
I jumped slightly on the...sofa? Yeah the sofa. The sofa was comfortable...
“Drakey!” Pansy flung herself over Draco, nearly squashing Octavia.
To try and fight this numbness, Draco had left the castle to go for a walk.
"Ow! Ow, ow, ow I feel like I'm on f-fire!" The girl sobbed out. "It hurts, it hurts a l-o-ot! Agh!" The girl's brown skin began turning a shade of awful red.
Draco made a 'so-so' motion with his hand and grimaced.
"Well they were nice." Draco snorted.
She gaped at him. “It may be ‘just a word’ for YOU Malfoy, because it could never effect you in any way. It may have become just a word’ because you’ve always seemed so adamant on using it to try and put me in my place like you’d ever have that right. It’s a filthy word that you don’t have the right to use on me, or any other muggeborns.”
Potter pretended to surrender. “Yeah yeah, I know, I’m just saying. The fact that we get on okay almost feels like the last three years of rivalry were a waste.” Draco shifted uncomfortably.
"...All right Percy, you go first."
Immediately the words on the screen were appearing and highlighting themselves. Draco did as Pansy said and tried to keep up. “How you doing, young lady? The feeling that you're giving really drives me crazy. You don't have a player 'bout to choke, I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke.” He tried to sing out fluidly, and got a couple cheers from the audience.
The ones in lesser pain, such as Pansy and Greg, had attempted to smuggle some hangover potions out of Snape’s office, but alas, the bat-resembling professor had charmed his stores well.
Weellll....that was quick update. I just find this fic so easy to right for at the moment, so I'm going to keep doing that until I found normal writing inspiration, is that okay? This chapter's a little bit shorter, but my chapter minimum will be set at 5000 words. I hope you enjoy the chapter!
“Oh, eet ees you! Ze boy from ze Cup!” She greeted him with delight. He grinned back.
"I'm guessing this is the 'big dangerous event' that will be hosted at Hogwarts this year?" Octavia nudged her starstruck brother. He smirked.
Where was he?
After a short telling off and spiel about subtlety, he allowed them to drag him out of bed at far too early a time on a Saturday to have breakfast.
"How to get onto the Platform?" She asked kindly, the understanding face seeming to be her default. Harry nodded. "Not to worry. All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between Platforms 9 and 10. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous." She turned to Draco. "How about you do it first." She said. "You look smart enough to be an example for how it works". He smiled happily.
"Aw no, and here I was looking so forward to hexing you into oblivion. It's what I've been looking forward to all summer." He smirked at me, folding his arms. "I also have one condition."
'There's a brick wall between the platforms. You need to run through it with speed and confidence to go through to the other side where the Hogwarts Express is. If you're late, you will only run into a wall and look like a fool, all while attracting the attention of muggles. Do not be late!'
It’s comical.
“Yes!” She pumped her fist. “Danny and Martha really wanted some help.”
She snorted. “Wouldn’t that be something!”
to be such a selfish killjoy.
"Perfect!" He held up a median sized purple tube with an indistinguishable label. He shoved it in my face and I read the label aloud.
After Hagrid explained how and what the class would be feeding the Skrewts, the chaos began. It seemed not even the golden trio could enjoy this class. Everyone was on edge and feeling at least a bit disgusted, especially after the discovery was made that the Blast-Ended Skrewts could burn, sting and bite.
Potter was inching ahead, a look of pure determination on his face. But Draco ploughed forward. He willed the broom to pick up speed as it careened down the pitch. He pushed his body weight forward and eventually it began pulling ahead of Potter.
"The manor? You live in a manor?!" Harry asked, flabbergasted. Draco nodded, keeping his eye out for a free compartment.
"Potter, do shut up. I am trying to be a good person, and as usual, you are making it difficult. And please, when we get to Hogsmeade, do not call me Malfoy. Call me . . .Tom or something. I've been out of the public's eye for a while now, and don't plan on hopping back into it. So I beg of you, don't be an idiotic Gryffindor and waste what is a fantastic disguise." His poncy voice still rang true and Malfoy, and I nodded in agreement with him.
“Yes! Yes, I’m quite alright. Thank you Krum.” He focused I’m gaze on Dumbledore. He scratched at his left forearm to ease his stress. Pansy grabbed the hand he was using to claw at it and held it. They continued to listen.
"Aren't you going to join them?" She asked her brother and he snorted too.
“Didn’t take you for that type of person Potter.” He teased.
"What are you looking at? Something on my face?" She leered and they all turned away. Narcissa stepped in.
“Like...what?” Octavia asked hesitantly.
'Maybe, but I hope not.'
“I can.” Octavia said, smirking.
"Pfft, I'm way too strong for that, hop on!" He bent down as she jumped onto his back, wrapping her arms around his neck. He stumbled for a second. "Wow you're heavy!"
“Blaise is right on the money!”
“The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang have already arrived, and on Halloween we will have the Champion Selections. An impartial judge will decide which students, are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school and a thousand galleon personal prize money.” The whispers grew more excited at the mention of prize money, though Octavia and Draco focused more on the schools that'd be joining them.
Professor McGonogall filed them all into a small empty chamber off the hall, and Draco found himself having the tug on Neville and Hermione's robes to keep them moving as they were still taking in the castle. The castle so far had only reminded Draco of the East wing of the manor, and had made him a bit uncomfortable. He hoped all of the castle wasn't like this.
“Vould you really? You are a vonderful friend Drako.” Draco tried to hide his excitement as he got out of his seat with Viktor
“Ooh speaking of dance or ball or whatever, if it is, you’ll have to go with me Draco!” Draco groaned and hid his face in his hands.
“It’s called being Slytherin.”
"Can't...c-can't...can't breath...can't breath." He stuttered out through tears, beginning to panic as his throat closed up on him.
“Potter, do you think I’m hot?” Blaise asked tearfully. You could see the moment Potter’s brain stuttered in his eyes.
"Thanks Drake!"
“No, of me, because you seem pretty obsessed with Theo!”
He managed to guide it down.
Danny grinned widely. “Over the past couple of weeks I’ve been exploring some secret passages and I found one that’s really special. You’ve got to see it.”
“I’m his sister. There is a difference.” She bumps shoulders with him, or tries to but the height difference doesn’t let her. “And as if you’re any better! I know for a fact that you’re a menace to him all the time, I’ve witnessed it.”
“Yes, I have no choice but to invite you along because you might tell someone. Now help me with these bottles, my arms are beginning to hurt.”
His magic was pretty drained, but he had to try. He thought about what he could work with.
“If you’re not going to take it the I’d be happy to keep it for another time.” Draco said. Potter popped the cap of the bottle and took a sip, before grimacing greatly. “You’re not meant to sip it, you’re supposed to chug it you idiot!” Draco nearly laughed at the boy’s stupidity.
Draco’s eyes met Cushion’s.
I hope you enjoyed this little installment to the story which I literally wrote at midnight because of a comment I saw from a reader called Sarah. Thanks for giving me the drive to get off of my keister and write another chapter, I love doing this. Please leave comments and kudos if you enjoyed, and any constructive criticisms and ideas are welcome. I'd love to know any ideas you could have because I'm playing it by ear and just want to keep this easy going. See you next time, I will hopefully update soon. Keep strong in quarantine my amigos!
Octavia headed over to Draco, where he was guiding Greg and Vince through some of their homework.
"I'm alright. B-but Hermione and Anthony did practically teach themselves." He gave credit to them. He sat down on the table next to Harry. "What are you having trouble with?" He asked.
"He'll be fine, I promise. Just try."
"10 points from Ravenclaw. Get her out of my classroom and tell Madame Pomfrey it's a venom burn." Snape directed harshly. Michael nodded and escorted the crying girl out of the classroom. He turned back to Draco and Terry. "5 more points from Ravenclaw for your ridiculousness. Next lesson I will not see you handflapping or anything of the sort." Terry nodded miserably. Snape looked to the rest of the class. "Get on with your potions or it's 5 points away from each student!" Everyone got back to work immediately.
The Slytherin Halloween Party.
“It’s not even a relationship, it’s just hooking up-“
“Well yeah, obviously.” Draco said. Potter looked surprised.
“I think you do.” Draco gagged harder and shivered.
"I've told you not to call me that!"
"Oh, um, I saw my cousin Dudley doing it, I think it's called a high five."
“Sirius Black,” it was Draco’s eyes’ turn to widen, “soon to be owner of Twelve Grimmauld Place, one of the remaining heirs to the Noble and most Ancient House of Black.” He recited. That’s how he got through these bloody wards! For once Kreacher wasn’t pulling his leg.
He dismounted his broom triumphantly.
"Yeah Ireland! Kick Bulagria's ars-" Draco cut himself off at a harsh look from Lucius. Octavia laughed at him. The three weirdos started to stare again.
Martha called her crazy. Danny understood it more, although he was more focused on the history of Hogwarts. He was still filling in what seemed like a very detailed map of the Slytherin common rooms, with every secret passage he could find. There was even one that went into the kitchens! And a particularly hilarious one that opened up at a stone right in the ceiling of Snape’s office.
"But I have to say, running away from Crouch and the Aurors didn't look very innocent." Potter mentioned, smirking. Draco grimaced.
"Well, at least now you know what to focus on! Your intention. The object more than the spell. And you've got the spell down perfectly!"
As they all sat down, Potter sat with them to one side of Draco. Draco looked at him with bemusement and slight horror.
But don't judge on what you see,
“She’s...nice.” Potter said.
By Friday she’d had enough of everything. She wasn’t going to talk to Draco, but she was going to sit with the friend group at dinner. She missed Pansy and the boys. Even Blaise a tiny bit.
“Well...yes. Of course.” Draco said confusedly, taking a bite of toast. The other boy clapped his hands.
He mounted the broom and ascended into the empty pitch.
"Ackerly, Stewart!"
They all piled into the room. It was a strange shape, and circular round the edge. There was a slight tilt at the ceiling, from the shape of the turret. It was larger than expected, but space must have been saved by having two bunkbeds. The room looked to be a square with a curve on the outer side, but if you were to add the shape of the en suite you would realise it resembled more a quarter circle. To the left of the door, both bunkbeds were against the wall. Next to them were four sets of silver drawers, one for each of them, each with a  small ceramic bowl full of mint imperials on top of it. Draco couldn't tell if they were fake on not. Straight ahead there was a window that showed the night sky, with thick black curtains beside it. The bunkbeds were wooden and painted white, and the sheets were navy and grey. The walls were painted a soft sky blue, with little white clouds littering them. Lastly, the carpet was a circular striped pattern, going between bronze and royal blue.
“But why?”
“You wanna get in my world, get lost in it. Boy, I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute.” Pansy clacked towards him, a hand on her hip.
Draco couldn’t help but feel it was the hardships that made life...life, but he didn’t speak up on that. He only nodded.
“Um, where’s Octavia?” Potter tried to make conversation.
"Er, what?" The Weasley idiot replied. Both Draco and Octavia rolled their eyes.
"Yeah right. And what's with your name? Draaaacoooo. It sounds pretentious." Draco felt anger curl up inside him.
“-not my kidnapper-”
More silence.
Draco’s warm breath consumed Blaise’s ear.
After dinner and a slice of Victoria sponge that was subpar at best, the Ravenclaw boys decided to head up to the dormitories.
“That was grim.”
I titled my head to the side. With this hair I kind of look like how Malfoy did yesterday.
The night of the Yule Ball and Blaise and Draco are drunk. Draco more so. A bit of romance between them plays out.
He stayed awake until 2 in the morning reading through it, before his head finally hit the pillow.
“Right.” Theo grins again. “So I’m just thinking we take this a bit further. And of course you’re comfortable with it, since you’re such a slag and all.”
“Have you been studying hard my little Death Eater in training.” She cooed and he beamed.
The Halloween had been pretty great so far, but Octavia was most excited about the feast. She’d had a lot of fun with Martha and the other first years, playing Halloween games and picking things to dress up as. Some of the muggleborns were sad that they couldn’t go ‘Trick or Treating’ but they did want to dress up scarily, so Martha was flooded with people wanting her to do their horror makeup for the party.
"Really? I had no idea!" She said sarcastically. "I heard one year they dropped their contestants into the tundra and tracked their progress. It was the final task, so they just let the losers perish. It was pretty brutal."
“Well he is often pretty awful.” She points out.
“What do you mean?” Potter asked him, still focusing on Draco. Everyone was staring t him. Draco turned down slowly, getting used to being on four limbs, and looked up at Octavia and Blaise. Blaise, for once, was speechless, staring at him in abject horror. Octavia was staring at him with similar horror, with more confusion. He hands twitched towards him, as if she was going to pick him up.
“Your brother? What an argument. Usually me and Felix’s fights are never that bad. Usually just because he gets paint on my things or steals my dresses.”
So he shrugged.
“You didn’t see anything.” He hissed. “It was a one time thing. Tell Blaise that.” He jabbed Draco in the chest and Draco scowled as he remembered why he never really spoke with Theo Nott.
. “And what about why you are here? How do I know you weren’t stalking me?” He accused Draco.
Of course.
At that point, Blaise, Vince and Greg walked into the cart. Blaise gave them all a sauve grin.
She then tried to compliment him and told him he had pretty eyes. He only smiled and said he got them from his mum. Oblivious.
He gasped and snatched up the wand quickly, as if I was going to take away the box at any second. Wordlessly he tried a charm to unpack his case. It happened fluidly and naturally, his clothes flying to the racks and drawers in the wardrobe provided. He grinned at me, his pearly whites shining.
Octavia shrieked as Draco vomited over a section of the entrance hall, just missing her shoes. He clenched his fist and wiped away at what was on his face, feeling disgusted with himself.
He didn’t pull up fast enough and the end of the broom ended up digging itself into dirt. The loss of momentum flew him forward off of the dastardly twig, where he lay a good ten meters away in a pile.
"Come on, it's 2 in the morning, time to go up to bed." She held out a hand for him to take and pulled him onto his feet. In her free hand she held a candle which glow Draco was thankful for, as other than that the library stayed dark and unfamiliar. He grabbed onto The Sorting Ceremony's Sanctity and held it close to his chest. Meredith watched him but didn't comment.
It was winter. December 21st to be exact. And Draco was at Hogwarts.
Speaking of, Potter really ought to eat some more. He’s terribly skinny and thin all the time, and he comes back from the summer holidays looking practically starved. Makes Draco wonder what that muggle family are feeding him. Or maybe he just has a high metabolism like Draco, and Draco isn’t one to judge something that he has. He’s many things, a fashion icon, a Slytherin , a bully, a star quidditch player, the heir to an enormous fortune, a bitch, but Draco is not a hypocrite.
"Fucking hell, why is everything out to get me?" I hissed under my breath, followed by a couple more swears. I looked into the mirror. Yeowch. I'd managed to uncover a huge knot at the front of my fringe. I sighed. This is going to take a while.
"Oh? Es-tu français aussi?" The girl asked him, surprised.
Draco played with his hands. “I just-“
"I still can't believe you live in a manor! A whole mansion and more...I bet you have quails or something. You've definitely learnt how to ride a horse and how to fire an arrow, and play polo and own a vineyard...and you definitely have some sort of exotic pet!" Hermione said smugly.
It was about freedom!
He’d been outside too much. He hadn’t even seen any names being entered into the cup. He wanted to go back to his dorm.
“But, that looked like a pretty bad fall. Are you sure you didn’t break anything?”
“Oh yeah, that whole Avada Kedavra thing. That kind of sucks. Seeing what happened to your parents happen to a spider just as easily. Knowing they died like that spider.”
Lunch continued until it was time for class. Draco bid goodbye to Octavia again and promised to meet her in the entrance hall later on. The next lesson for Draco and his friends was Transfiguration, for fear of being late. They may not love McGonagall, but that didn’t meet they didn’t...respect her greatly. That and she was sharp as all hell and would cut through them like paper if they were late.
"Y-yes Father." Draco took off the pile of books and fled to his room.
"To the library?" He's met with agreement. So they all walk to the library.
Draco returned to the common room at about half past nine, looking windswept and lost in thought. He collapsed on his green velvet chair with a tired huff. Octavia walked over to him.
“It works perfectly well thank you. Finely tuned, had it sent in for repairs the other day.”
"There'll probably be a school dance or something. I hope it's an 'I'm Sorry For Traumatising You At School' ball. I know a lot of people who could use one of those." She giggled.
"Well, we're getting somewhere at least..."
"What do you need to do that for?"
"Hey, do you guys reckon Malfoy's coming back for Eighth year?" I asked the happy couple, who were so lost in romantic bliss that I almost felt guilty breaking it.
"Kind of. It means you have an extensive heritage of wizardry on both sides. Mine goes wayyyyyyy back. So anyway, you're a muggleborn. I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask you about the muggle world." He said, getting right to the point.
As I entered the bathroom, everything seemed to be happening at once. Malfoy was really getting a use from his wand, enchanting a razor to shave his face, a hairdryer to dry his newly dyed black locks, a pencil was putting eyeliner on the top of his eyes, and a towel was scrubbing away at some black residue left in the sink. While all this was happening, Malfoy was focused on brushing the knots out of his hair while it was being dried, quietly singing something while a pair of white earphones attached to a small white box hung from his ears. It was quite an odd picture, and I tried to keep my vision to his neck up, ignoring his half shirtlessness the best I could.
"Où est Madame Maxime? Nous l'avons perdue-"
"No Via, we can't go too far, Mother and Father may get worried," She waved him off.
He loved Pansy to bits, he really did, he just wasn’t in love with her. He liked her a lot, she was his best friend since early childhood after all. He just didn’t like her romantically.
The lesson ended shortly after and lunch arrived. Octavia was already at the table, and making her way through her food at great pace.he sat down next to her.
"I highly doubt it. They've been apart all summer, so they're probably shagging like bunnies."
“Oh, I’m selfish now, am I? I’m so sorry that at the age of eleven, I didn’t think far enough ahead for what my action’s effect would have ON YOU! So, SO sorry for that. And by the way, who’s fault was it that we were near the Dark Mark at the Quidditch Cup? Couldn’t have been me, I was listening to YOU, the SELFISH PRAT that I am!”
“Cheers!” Potter nudged his plastic cup against Draco’s awkwardly
They were a little bit early, so they got a good choice on seating. Draco asked Octavia whether she'd like to sit further down with the other first years, but she adamantly refused, claiming she wanted to see Pansy, Blaise, Greg and Vince again. Draco knew she had a slight problem with talking to people her own age, being pretty starved of children her age when she was younger. He let her follow him until they found where Pansy was. The other's hadn't arrived yet.
Fortunately or unfortunately, however you may phrase it, Draco and Potter did not run out of alcohol. This is because (luckily or unluckily) Draco had kept a small bottle of vodka in his pocket, and they’d been mixing it with pumpkin juice for much of the night.
“Hey Via!” He walked over to her and tucked the newspaper under his arm. “So what do you want to do?”
"Fine, lets have a look then. But first I want to get into a clearing, I keep nearly tripping over tent pegs." They begin to veer over to a section on the left which held less tents.
"I have two eyes but cannot see; what am I?" The eagle asked in a deep voice. Meredith turned back to the first years.
“Well in a week we will be welcoming the Dark Lord into our home. I don’t suppose he’d be able to enter if it was so limited.” Draco said.
"Well...they never said not to bring dress robes if you're a first year...who knows? Maybe there was a mistake on your list and you do need them. Or maybe something will happen that'll mean you're in desperate need of this specific dress? You just never know...therefore..." He snatched the dress out of her hands and put it in the pile of his clothing. He ran over to the till and bought it before Octavia could stop him.
“Such a dark secret, Draco, I’m surprised with you.” Draco nods at this assessment.
Th fire in the goblet had returned to a red colour, stray sparks flying out of it. A sudden flame suddenly shot out from it, carrying another stray piece of parchment. The entire hall held their breath silently, waiting for Dumbledore’s next move. Dumbledore caught the parchment between his fingers.
He opened the book and flicked through absentmindedly as he checked his reflection. The curse had worn off, but had caused a light paralysis in his left leg. As well as that, he needed to treat a bruise on his cheek and a split lip. He needed to get rid of them. Aunt Bella never wanted reminders of his transgressions. As soon as the punishment was dealt, he was perfect again. It was a good system.
“I guess. I probably have a sprained leg or something, might have to live in crutches forever.” He milked the injury dramatically. At Octavia’s scared look he changed the subject. “But you, you little troll, you threatened a teacher! You rebel! So much for being a rule abiding swot, you threatened to curse a teacher in front of a bunch of people! I bet it’ll only take a few days for rumours to start spreading around the school!” Draco tried to ignore the weird looks he was getting from other people in the hallways. Octavia flushed.
I love love love reading the walls of love you guys give me but seriously every heart emoji or offhand remark makes my week! I love you all, until the next chapter <3 xxxx
"Yeah."
I floundered at the question and just tried shrugging weakly.
“Alcohol at our age is still irresponsible.” Potter said like the boring do-gooder twat he was.
I turned back around to Malfoy to see him looking at me in disgust.
Pansy froze. So did he.
“To the Malfoy siblings.”
“And why not? It’s obvious I’m more powerful than you.” He pointed out, being a slight lie as at that moment he was definitely magically drained. Unfortunately Sirius saw through this too.
Then Weasley's voice. "Tripped over a tree root." He could see them all now, Weasley, Granger and Potter.
Malfoy smirked. "Okay then. Dean and Seamus, in that case you may call me Draco."
"Which part of it? Them bringing back the tournament, the schools that'll be coming to Hogwarts, or the age limit?" Pansy asked.
Once he shot upward, he could already tell the broom was old. He aimed for upper centre, and tried to shoot upwards vertically. Once he felt he was high enough he let one leg loose and while grasping tightly with one arm, let the other arm go. He floated for a strong second at the height of the sky before he let himself free fall. The broom swerved upside down as it tumbled dow, before he grasped at it with his other arm to steady it before it hit the ground. It nearly worked.
“Those aren’t the words.”
After a moment of deliberation, he shrugged. “We’re on a truce. We’re not enemies anymore.”
"Well then, if it's so 'important', go on ahead." Granger told him.
“Donc beau!”
“It was actually a great party.” Blaise corrected. “Right Theo?” He asked the boy sat next to him with exactly no subtlety. Theo shrugged noncommittally, refusing to look Blaise in the eyes.
“See you later Drako.”
“I hope you know I have many questions.” Harry told him flatly as he held a cat.
"My favourite pages were about the Amortentia cases!"
That is, until you got to the Slytherin 4th years. Whom all woke up with headaches akin to boulders pressing down onto their heads, a distinct lack of hangover potion, and a multitude of gaps in their memories. In short, they all woke up with regrets.
And here he thought they were British!
“Oh definitely, especially if they’re ringlets.”
Maybe he should of told her properly before he’d committed to this dying in the snow idea.
Vince nods. “Thanks Draco, I will.” He stood up and offered his hand for Draco to take. Draco waved it away.
“And you certainly didn’t stop learning about it, did you?” Blaise picked up a book with a purple cover and a generic name from Draco’s bedside.
“Really? Not going to think of a better lie?”
“Drako! I-I-I- ‘ave failed! I am no longer a man!” He let out a soft sob into an extremely uncomfortable looking Draco’s chest. Draco pat the boy’s back awkwardly and averted his gaze anywhere else, with the faraway look of someone who desperately wanted to dissolve into the tiled floor.
They took their seats at the Ravenclaw table, all waiting for the post. Draco was nervous, but thought that if nothing had come yesterday, then his father probably wouldn't know about his housing situation until he fixed it. Once he had some free time away from the others, he would read the chapter he'd found in The Sorting Ceremony's Sanctity. He didn't want the others to know he wanted to switch houses yet. He didn't want to offend them. But he knew that he had to.
“Whatever Malfoy, you could just say no.”
"They're not implants you rotten bitch! Ask Blaise!"
“A mermaid!” She shrieked at what had appeared on the other side of the glass. A mermaid, with grey scaly skin and long green seaweed-esque hair. It floated around their head and tangled together magically. Their eyes were a glowing yellow, no pupils to be seen, only a pure gold glowing yellow that seemed almost hypnotic. The mermaid grinned at Octavia, or grimaced, it was difficult to tell, and revealed a mouth of pointed shark like teeth. Their tale was more scaled than their body, and took on a more silver colouring as it flapped from side to side. It seemed to be the length of Octavia, and the end of it had a farther span than Octavia could of ever imagined. Right from the illustrations in her books and in front of her.
She went behind him, looking over his shoulder, while he mimicked her from the front.
"Nice glasses, Drake."
"Really grumpy? Who cares what he looks like?" Weasley asked rhetorically. Draco thought h could hear Octavia mutter 'Draco does' so he elbowed her. "He's unbelievable. He's really young, too. only just eighteen or something. He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see."
What lay inside was incredible.
?” He fake glared at Blaise.
“How the hell did you find me?” Draco hissed and Potter had the audacity to smirk.
Draco nodded against the boy’s chest. It was.
Before he could comment, Borislav butted in.
Every head in the room turned silently to face the fourth year sat at the Gryffindor table. Octavia glanced at Draco. His eyes were wide and stuck on the boy who lived, focused like never before. He had an oddly blank expression, one where his thoughts could be racing or quiet and slow. No one could tell.
The second and last film they watched was called ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’. Even though it had Christmas in the title, it was very Halloween-ish, with the main character being called the Pumpkin King. The movie was was very odd. It didn’t include real people who looked like they were trapped in the box, they looked like drawings. Jack, ever so informative, told her that this was called ‘animation’, and the way they did it for this movie was that they made tiny models of the characters, and then moved them ever so slightly, took a picture, moved them again, took a picture, until it looked like they were moving on their own. Octavia supposed the muggles had to handle not being able to spell things in their own silly little ways.
"I'm so sorry."
“I will see you later! And when I do, you better be on the arm of the stud Gregory Goyle!” Draco yelled as the other boy re-entered the party. He stood up and brushed himself off but stayed to lean against the wall. Eventually some wizarding musicians began to play, and with more children knowing these, more began to sing and dance.
"Double Potions." Anthony answered him, packing away the charms book he used to practice Wingardium Leviosa.
"Oooh, peppermint, my favourite. How did you remember?" She asked happily, popping her knitting needles into the loose bun atop her head.
“Was that your tongue?!”
“Um, Draco...”
"Is that really real, or are you pulling my leg?" At this rate I was going to get a concussion.
The first sign of trouble was giggling. Lots of it. High pitch and low pitch giggling, which meant multiple people were involved.
"That was incredible, my boy!" Flitwick said in elation. He did a happy little dance. "Absolutely incredible! Where you intention needs some work, your control and magic were tremendous! I've never seen such utter control from a pupil, especially a first year on their first day! My my my am I happy to have you in my house!" Draco could feel himself turning pink. Everyone's eyes were glued to him. Oh Zeus...
The sang the next verse similarly, tensions slowly rising. Draco was totally handling this. He was definitely cool. He tried not to glance at the screen too often, very involved in the scene he’d created. Eventually the second chorus came around.
His half of the room was as tidy and immaculate as he seemed to be, a place for everything, and everything in it's place. This made my side of the room look even more like a pigsty, and I was almost embarrassed.
"Yeah mate, that was awesome! Scary but awesome!" Anthony agreed from behind. Terry, who in a slightly more frazzled state had taken to holding Anthony's hand, nodded. As did Neville, though looking a bit more scared.
“I’m still convinced you cheated.” Vince mentioned sourly, being the one to lose the most chocolate frogs.
"Terrible band name."
The sign read 'Please keep quiet while in the Ravenclaw library. If you are not Ravenclaw, please leave while you still can'. Underneath the vaguely threatening sign lay a basket with some books inside it. The basket was labelled 'For books that are no longer wanted.' Draco assumed this was the reason the library was so big. Because it could keep filling up.
“Excuse me?”
Even if it meant dancing about in new jeans for Hermione and Luna to catcall at.
“How come you care?”
And after they got to Hogwarts.
“-I have no choice but to take you with me. I can be your new kidnapper, won’t that be fun!” Sirius smiled maliciously. The kid looked like he wanted to die.
Draco leapt away from the destruction, and hid behind a drawer from whatever the home invader was. He snuck a gaze past the drawer and saw a figure in the doorframe. The person was now in the house.
After another hour of monotony Aunt Bella burst into his room. He looked up and smiled.
Only two people clapped, and that was the Gameskeeper and Dumbledore. The rest of them were dead silent. Draco's hands were digging into his legs and trousers, so Octavia slapped his wrist lightly to get him to stop.
“Are you and Draco friends?” Octavia asked, moving the conversation further.
She was wandering the dungeons, admittedly looking for a new passageway Danny hadn’t discovered yet so she could rub it in his face, when she thought she heard Blaise.
"He hurt our friends!" Another slam on the table. Draco tried not to flinch with the familiar sound of a book slamming down, and dug his nails into his recovered arm.
"You really don't have to Malfoy, I'm okay with my clothing, there's no reason for me to waste any money." I tried insisting that it really wasn't worth it, but he blocked me out and immediately started charming his face. Before I could stop him further, he'd already given himself a softer chin, freckles, and light brown eyes in a look that honestly suited the black hair much more. I could barely recognize him, as he had turned into a completely different person. Which I guess was the point.

Octavia circled him like a vulture.
Look, this isn’t going to be the same story that you’re familiar with. But where’s the fun in that? So lets start where all good stories start.
"This isn't getting us anywhere." Draco croaked out. Harry snapped his head to Draco at the unexpected sound. "I'll just tell you why he sent me a Howler." He wiped at his face and cleared his throat. Harry scooted closer. He absentmindedly unclasped their hands and laid his on his knees. "The reason he was so mad at me is because...I'm in Ravenclaw."
"Let's just keep moving!" Weasley decided and led them further along the dark path into the wood. Draco only hoped Narcissa wasn't looking for them.
Draco double checked his muffling charms worked. “No way!”
"Fine, what is it?" I rolled my eyes.
"Oh, uh...talk to you tomorrow!" Octavia ignored the girl, and turned towards the wall. She had plenty of time to make friends, just not right now. In her little cut off section she changed into her pajamas. She slipped her trunk under her bed and fell onto her pillow.

The 2 times Pansy tries to ask out Draco and the 0 times it actually works.
And Potter isn’t even attractive. Draco has no idea why so many teen girls flock to him. And Potter’s so awkward he doesn’t even notice, and breaks all the pretty girls’ hearts.
“No no no, you’re the one that always brings up something ridiculous-“
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry that Professor Moody thought you were going to curse me. And then turned you into a ferret. And then threw you around.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Blaise eventually let go and stormed back into the party like a man on a mission. Potter stared after him confused.
“Yep, probably just, uh, dehydrated.” It wasn’t a lie because he probably was.
"Nothing at all?" Ron looked eager.
“Where is your kidnapper currently?”
Dumbledore continued, "This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers' time and energy - but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts -"
"Um, yes. He is." Draco said, experiencing second hand embarrassment that he probably acted exactly as this boy was.
“Are you really fluent in french?” Granger steered the conversation.
“What’s this one then?” Blaise asked and Draco sulked. Of course one of the only songs he actually knew of Blaise had no idea of. Thankfully Pansy came in to save him. She clasped his hand in hers and raised them both before belting “EVERY NOW AND THEN I FALL APART!”
"So, um, you're also going to Hogwarts?" The boy asked. Draco nodded. "What is it like?"
Draco had told her that the hat had scarcely spent any time on him before sorting him, so suspected it was a family thing. But the hat listened to her.
Uh...
"Oh no, this is far too much, this is. It's fine, 'onestly!" Hagrid tried insisting, but Draco insisted more and shoved the coins into a large open hand.
“Oh, I’m doing charms right now!” Greg told her from where he was laying on the floor surrounded by parchment. “And I’m pretty good at it if you want some help?” He had ink on his face. She wiped it off.
“That’s a weird name. Draco what?”
“I’m glad to see you’ve matured in your handling of an injury since last year.” Draco flushed at nodded, leading the other two outside.
“WHAT?!”
"If you Ravenclaws were to sit down then maybe I could get on with the lesson." Professor Snape said in an even but threatening tone. They quickly shuffled into four seats that were next to each other. Draco was between Michael and Terry, with Anthony on Michael's right.
I quickly brushed my teeth and then picked up a hairdryer. I kept it at arms length and fiddled with the buttons on it, trying to figure out what to do. It suddenly roared to life in my hands and I dropped it in a panic with a yelp. Onto my foot.
"Do you need any backup?" Greg asked him, getting ready to stand up.
“Go on.”
“Pree-tee boy! ‘Ow was your party?” Aleksander sat down at the table, immediately reaching for some toast. Draco smiled with a slight flush.
The feast was incredible, with all of her favourite foods and desserts. And the
“But that’s the thing, Felix is so terrible at singing but he does it all the time-“
“I’m a bit worried. Were you in his class when Professor Moody...m-made him do that? To his arm?” She admitted, looking at him with what she hoped were guarded eyes
"Not really, you were just loud."
“I-I’m fine Potter, I’m fine.” He swatted a concerned outreached hand away.
He racked his tired mind whether a re-sorting could be arranged, but the hat had been said to never make a mistake. Besides, he'd never heard of any kind of ceremony to re-sort a student, and didn't want to cause that big of a fuss.
“-and I spread rumours about you being the Heir of Slytherin! My torment took effort!”
Blaise ignored this comment. “So Potter was there?”
“Mr Zabini here seems to have stolen my heart.” She clutched hers dramatically. “We are due to be wed in good time.”
"Anything off the trolley dears?" She asked them while pushing along a cart piled high with sweets.
“Who are you, and what are you doing here?” Draco grit, struggling slightly to keep the person there. The intruder met his eyes and Draco couldn’t help but feel like he recognised them from somewhere. The person was taller than Draco and had grey eyes, with long black hair tied in a loose ponytail. They were wearing a leather jacket and large black boots that kept on trying to step on Draco’s feet.
It was a Sunday, so they didn’t have to commit to any work until that evening’s homework. Lazy day.
"I needed to...formally thank you for telling Mr Crouch that I wasn't responsible for the Dark Mark..."
A set of hands gripped his, and pulled them from his legs. If you looked closely you could make out little holes dug into the fabric of his trousers. One of his legs was probably bleeding. The set of hands were soft as they cupped his and stroked them. His tears kept falling and his face crumpled again. It was such a strange gesture, but it was comforting. It was soft. He let out another sob. He could live forever as long as he had this. He wasn't used to it, but he wished he was.
"It's only a little bit further," she pointed to a red, green and white flag fluttering a ways away, "and I remember the path back to our tent."
"I didn't do anything!" Draco protested.
Further still along the path, the group came across some Veela, all shining a silver light. They were surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, women and men, all trying to loudly chat them up.
Octavia giggled. “Yeah, my and Draco never really fight.” She sniffed loudly and Martha handed her a tissue. She took it thankfully. “So whenever we do fight, it’s about something more than paint stains or stealing. This time it got pretty bad. Escalated terribly.”
"Because you're going about it all wrong. I was raised in a household filled with house elves of all kinds, and I've seen some stuff. From what I've seen and heard, many of them enjoy serving Wizards. It's what gives them meaning. Occasionally a house elf may wish to be freed, but that is a rare occurrence. They've been trained to see someone freeing them as a punishment. Like being fired from a job. Have you ever witnessed how mcuh they punish themselves when they think they disappointed you in someway? For being a 'bad house elf'." Hermione was now watching Malfoy explain curiously, anger diminishing the more he talked, brow furrowed.

So sorry for the wait as usual, I hope you enjoy the chapter ❤️❤️❤️
Draco shrugged. “The first three years went to bed. Or, at least back to their dorms. She’s probably watching a ‘movie’ with friends.” Potter looked at him surprised.
"But Father-"
“They’re of a lesser pedigree.” He said. Granger raised an eyebrow.
“That’s like asking whether or not I have lungs. What are you planning girlie?” Pansy asked her. Octavia smirked.
“Oh, I don’t care who’s entered. I’m not old enough, and I’m glad I’m not because it’s nothing more than a death trap. At least if you’re not entering I know for a fact you’ll stay alive.” Draco told the other boy a-matter-of-factly. The other boy wore another grin.
Pansy snickered. "It looked so bad that he's decided to quit Hogwarts and continue life as a designer handbag."
“I can still tell that his has this weird pretty boy thing going on. He hair looks plasticly perfect.”
“Draco?” Draco’s eye flickered upwards to meet Vince’s. His breathing was heavy and his left arm hurt.
Draco loved reading.
"You're fifteen." Potter pointed out. Draco shrugged awkwardly.
“Stop lying to yourself, its very sad. No one can resist the B-man!” Blaise flexed his muscles and Octavia snorted.
“I think we’re being a bit impolite to Shelly.” Martha interrupts them, pointing to the mermaid. Octavia raised her eyebrow.
"And now, kindly put your wands in the air...for the  Irish National Team Mascots!"
"Well then, you didn't think to-" The Professor was interrupted by a sudden howl. Draco looked over to see a Hufflepuff girl shaking violently in pain next to an extremely concerned Michael.
“But what about that girl from the summer? You’ve been bragging about it since September! And what about that girl on Halloween? You said you and Carrie snogged in the defence classroom?” Draco questions him. Blaise shrugged.
"And why ever not?!"
Which is why it was obviously true.
“I doubt you could get kissing like this from just about anyone.” He said confidently.
He cocked his head confusedly.
“For your brother?”
“I think that might have been Voldemort.”
"To the left is the girls' dormitories, and to the right is the boys'. I wouldn't mix them up if I were you." She said, gesturing to either side. "There is a spiral staircase going up to the first years dorms. The older you get, the closer to the ground you get. You are all at the very top, so you get all of those wonderful stairs." She clasped her hands together while grinning as everyone groaned in pain. "There are three different rooms between you all, each with 4 beds. You can sort all of that out between yourselves, as long as you're sleeping a bed, I don't care where. Okay, you eight girls, come with me, I'll lead you up. Boys, just carry on going upwards, and at the top there'll be four doors and all of your luggage. Please don't fall down the stairs. Come on then, girls!" She led them up the left staircase. The remaining 7 boys went up the right one.
He looked to the cat in the sidecar. It was as pink as the pillow had been, and the fur looked a bit matted. It had a squashed face and lazy eyes, and the triangles that were supposed to be it’s ears were too big for it’s head.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, speaking of shopping, I got you something from Dervish and Banges," he rifled through one of the bags full of bottles and cosmetics. He pulled out a small pink plastic tube and handed it to Luna. "You were wanting to dye your hair, but your hair is already such a lovely blonde that I didn't want to risk anything with the unpredictable muggle stuff. So I got you a wizard one, with a twist. Gives it a bit more off an affect." He shrugged.
“I didn’t say that...” Potter looked at him expectantly. Draco sighed. “I do know some muggle songs. Pansy and Blaise insisted I learnt a couple of them. They can be rather fun. Better than Celestina Warbeck at least, but that isn’t a high bar anyway.” He snorted slightly.
“Ugh, Felix’s hair is the worst. He never brushes it and has kept using the same shampoo since he was toddler. It looks like a mop at the best of times.”
"Thanks for the great wake up, Malfoy. Really appreciate being blind." I said sarcastically, getting up off the floor.
“Oh absolutely, you’re such a gentleman.”
“I know this and I’m proud.”
Luna smiled widely and tossed the bottle to me before trapping Malfoy in a big embrace. His face was awkwardly squished against her, uh, chest area, and the whole thing looked awkward because of the position difference of the sofa and floor. He looked like he didn't know what to do, so he set about giving her some dorky shoulder pats, a mug still precariously in one hand.
He couldn't wait until they got to Hogwarts.
His appetite lost, he turned to his empty plate. He nibbled on his sugar quill anyway.
“Well, if you insist. I suppose that was part of the deal.” After Draco’s done organising his hair again, he remounts his broom.
Draco felt a bit stupid that only then had it occurred to him that he hadn’t added a truce with Granger. And without one, she would no doubt be very reluctant to help.
McGonagall took the hat off his head and pushed him towards a quiet Ravenclaw table. Some muggleborns and first years gave a confused applause as he sat down. It was then  that his panic broke loose from the drawer in his mind to his entire body.
"Why? Are you very cunning ambitious and resourceful?" Truthfully, he wasn't. He tried to be ambitious, but he wasn't very cunning. He didn't really have much drive for what to do once he was older, since he knew he'd just continue the Malfoy line and have many little Pureblood babies and sit on top of his fortune doing nothing. It was bland but he'd accepted it. He was quite resourceful in the sense of gathering knowledge to further his own tasks, but other than that, he didn't think so. He hoped that his Pureblood heritage would be enough to shoehorn him into Slytherin. His ancestors had.
“Speaking of gay-“
And it isn’t weird to know a lot of facts about Potter! Such as his entire timetable, or that his favourite subject is Defence Against the Dark Arts, or that his favourite food is treacle tart, or that he’s allergic to strawberries, or that his favourite colour is red, or that his middle name is James, or that his wand is a holly Phoenix feather core, or that he enjoys long walks on the beach, or any of that! It isn’t weird! It’s called *knowing your enemy* and it’s perfectly reasonable considering he’s Draco’s arch nemesis. Keep your friends close, stalk your enemies closer and all that.
, it said stubbornly, and Draco’s right arm began to slowly move the quill over his left forearm.
Draco was still. It felt strange. Relaxed. His mind began to fill with a fog of ease. That definitely wasn’t normal. His eyes flittered to everyone, making a great deal of eye contact as everyone stared. Then he heard a faint voice.
“Well I’m certainly not Celestina Warbeck. Who are you?”
“Yep, and the boys. Greg might be close to tears. He hates seeing his little sister get angry.” Draco huffed at that and buried his face in his pillow.
The cat stuck it’s tongue out and blepped lazily in response.
'Beloved Chosen One Loses His Chosen One'
"That won't work either. Fudge might be gone, but that doesn't mean idiots don't still work at the Ministry. To make the change you're looking for, you'd have to change it from the inside. Work your way up from inside the Ministry, and take apart the house elf laws from there. That way, not only would your say need to be heard, but you could have control to change other Creature's lives for the better, such as half breeds and Werewolves, You'd need a respected investor to back up your changes, and to at least have a friendly acquaintance on the Wizengamot, or become a part of it." He paused. "I mean, that's the law abiding way.
"Well...I think I remember a lot of green light. But nothing else. I was just a baby."
==============
“Are you going to back out? Now that you’re at the entrance of the lair?” He smirked teasingly. Potter took this seriously and glanced at the snake. He nodded hesitantly and Draco grinned.
"What can you break, even if you never pick it up or touch it?" The eagle knocker asked.
“They have not yet reached that stage, but at this rate, anyone with blood from the Noble and most Ancient House of Black could enter.” The house elf then smiled sadistically. “With being cursed by Mistress Lestrange of course. Even Mistress Malfoy could enter, although she took that name.”
“Oh tits on a treadmill that’s wild! Dragons, dragons have got to be real! Harpies?! Werewolves?! VAMPIRES!?!?” Danny continued with growing excitement.
“Oh la la, don’t get me started on ‘is sens de la mode!”
"Who's Melindarea?" He flushed pink.
"A vase if you used a shattering charm?" Terry asked. The eagle grumbled a bit before opening up the door. "Thank you Bernie."
“Mmhmm, yes, very convincing,” she patted him on the head condescendingly. He scowled at her. She smirked and tucked herself into he crook of his arm. “Keeping up the appearance of dating is tiring work, you’re so bony.”
Professor Moody’s lessons and a night on the quidditch pitch.
Draco scoffed. “I hardly think you’re in the position to be negotiating, especially when you’re a grimy trespasser.”
“It’s not really ideal but...” Draco took a sip of his drink, “it makes Octavia happy. And muggle music isn’t that bad.” He took another sip and shrugged. “I suppose.”
Draco grimaced. "Ugh, I regret teaching you how to whine." She continued to make puppy dog eyes at him. "Ugh, FINE! Fine, I'll chaperone you, lets go 'exploring', or whatever." He crossed his arms grumpily. Octavia smirked.
* No Scrubs - TLC
"Shut it Via!" He hissed at her, feeling a pink grow on his cheeks to his ears. Then she licked his hand. "Geurrg! Via, you're disgusting!" He shrieked, lifting his now saliva covered hand with antipathy. Potter watched this whole scene play out with confusion, as Weasley once again looked one bad knock knock joke away from bursting out laughing. Then Weasley's face went serious.
They exited through the floo.
"My parents always wanted me to go to Hogwarts, because it's where You-Know-Who went." Greg said, as if it was no big deal. Everyone went quiet.
“I’m surprised she wasn’t in Ravenclaw, she’s very smart. But it’s not like she’s the first very smart Slytherin.” He hoped Potter would catch on and get that he was referring to himself.
I don't like it.
“Does this mean that when I turn eighteen I’ll be allowed to leave Grimmauld?” He asked excitedly. Aunt Bella’s smile dropped a bit.
"Yeah, Malfoy took one look at my wardrobe and took me shopping. I think he's trying to give me a full makeover, because he bought hair products and makeup as well." She tilted her head curiously.
On the 4th of July, Draco was in Diagon Alley shopping for his school supplies, being accompanied by his mother. Looking at them, you'd think Narcissa was there to look after Draco. She thought she was as well. The actuality of the situation was Draco chaperoning Narcissa and holding her hand so she wouldn't wander off. He had been ticking down the items on his list one by one and had just finished buying his wand. The man in the shop, Ollivander, had gone on quite a bit about the unicorn hair core and how special it was. Draco appreciated the sentiment in trying to make a first wand exciting but Mother had almost had one of her turns from boredom, so he'd had to politely excuse them both. She was now quite restless.
“Right, and when did you learn about sex?” Draco huffed.
"What did you do to your hair? It looks crazy! This must be the first time I'm seeing your with orderly hair! How long did it take to train that mop?" He exclaimed loudly, drawing attention from the other people scattered about the table. I put my head in my hands and thumped onto the wooden table with a thud.
"Great idea duckling! We can bring Andy some fairy cakes! Oh you are so sweet!" She clasped her hands together in excitement. Oh Merlin.
“Hi! You’re in my dorm! My name is Martha!” She knew.
That isn’t the story we’re telling.
"I was shopping for my Hogwarts school supplies in Diagon Alley."
Or maybe don’t learn poetry...it would be funnier...
Aunt Bella noticed this and her grin sharpened. As Draco started to collapse to the floor slightly, the imaginary weight of his body being too much, he still tried to look at her. She took his chin in one hand and tipped it upwards.
“Good.” She stated. “B-because you need to watch after him.”
“Do you want to do something fun?” Martha interrupted the steady silence.
"Where were you today Draco?" His cold voice asked in a careful tone. Draco knew better than to trust that voice.
"A test? I didn't know there was going to be a test! Which spell would I need. I only practiced the ones that were in the school books, but does it rely on more of an improvisational tone? Is it altered to fit each student, or would it be the same throughout? Is it a duel or practical?" She rambled on, seemingly to herself. Draco nudged her shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
He chose Hogwarts Houses And Their Meaning to read next. It was rather compelling, and he got bit distracted from what he was looking for as he read over the Founders' lives, trials and tribulations, and how they chose their animals. After he'd gotten to the 79th page he realised there wasn't a whole lot on if the sorting hat were to make a mistake, and was more focused on the house trait origins instead of how someone is sorted. Another unfortunate dud. At this point it was getting rather late in the night but Draco powered on.
He fiddled with his hands a bit, hugging his forearms slightly. She kept her eyes there making sure he didn’t begin his nervous tick of scratching his arm again.
“Are you really sure Pansy?” Vince asked.
“Nice singing, really sounded great, later you should definitely do another song!” He told Draco. Draco rose an eyebrow and crossed his hands dubiously.
Sirius sighed again and sat down on a sofa, while Potter sat down on another, trapping Draco on the floor between them.
Both of their families nearly ripped them apart; Gale coming from muggles and Rowan being a Pureblood. Rowan couldn't ever step away from his family, he had to carry on the lineage. So he agreed to everyone that he would sacrifice his happiness and marry Madamoiselle Margeaux Denaelle. The decision broke both of their hearts but Rowan new it was for the best.
“Keep dreaming Blaise!” Pansy told the jester as he fake sobbed.
"Yes, but I have extensions! Never mind, I can decide that later. What about you Blaise? What are your dress robes like?"
“Hey Malfoy!” A voice yelled from behind them. “Malfoy!” The person ran up to them.
"I'll help you find him then. I'm Draco, what's your name?" Draco asked, holding out a hand for the boy to take.
"Well well well Draco, what a shame this is. You appear to have dropped every. Single. Book." The man smiled cruelly, hitting the boy on the head with his cane at each pause. He used a hand to yank the boy's head to face him, daring him to disagree. "What do you have to say for yourself, Draco?"
“I’m not. You’ve got me curious now, you seemed so invested.” Draco flushed. “Just give me a short synopsis. Please.” He looked up at Draco and
"How...how did you know all of that?" I asked him, slightly weirded out and at the same time getting a lot of Hermione vibes.
"Wingardium Leviosa."
"Remind me to never have children." Draco said.
"Octi!"
"Dammit no, let me pay!" I tried to run after him, but it was too late, the Galleons were on the desk.
When he saw me he smirked. "See that new clothes confidence you got there Potter? That's because of me and my great fashion skills. Now change and give the shirt here, we can put that in the basket." He shooed me back into the booth.
“Via, if you’d please entertain us with embarrassing sibling stories.”
"Gah!" Draco shrieked in surprise. "You were so quiet!"
Draco hated his friends. If he could even call them that. He’d disowned them all.
They’ll see.
“From your room.”
“I dislike you because are full of disrespect. Just like Mistress Lestrange says.” The house elf seemed gleeful. “Your ‘stir craze’ will soon cause you to be punished, I know so. You will have wished that you could be kidnapped.” A strange wheezy laugh came out of Kreacher. Draco rolled his eyes again.
"Salazar Potter, I knew that your fashion sense was appalling, but really now. There is nothing good in your entire closet!" He exclaimed dramatically, holding Dudder's old grey shirt by his finger tips with an outstretched arm. while giving my closet another sneer. "Since we have a truce Potter, there is a chance that we'd be seen together around the castle, and there is no way I am being seen near someone with such an appalling choice of clothing. Which is why today I will be taking you into Hogsmeade to try and get you a new wardrobe that isn't as distasteful." I opened my mouth to protest but was silenced by him throwing the disgusting grey shirt onto my face, blinding me.
“What’s going on?” Octavia asked them all, or more specifically, Draco.
“Anyone who was paying any actual attention to you when your name was drawn would believe you. You looked terrified.” And Draco had payed attention to that expression so much to the point of short circuiting. Not that he’d ever in a million years admit that.
“On the count of three,” Draco announced. “One...two....three!” And they kicked off.
“Well, whatever his name is just messed up royally at work. And here I thought the Weasleys couldn’t get any poorer!” Draco looked behind Blaise and saw an angry redhead looking right at him. Oops.
"Oh no, oh
“What is going on?” he asks, walking backwards to look at them. “Are you all ill?"
“You have
, and Slytherins do make friends that will be more loyal than any living thing on Earth, but only until the point where it stunts their ambitions irreparably, until it’s guided by pure emotion. There is no way he can concede further to Blaise’s arguments without damaging his own morals, his parent’s teachings, his family’s ideologies, changing the outview of all their- their friends.
"Ugh," Potter says in disgust, then goes a bit red in embarrassment. "No, wait-"
is having some.”
Draco grabs Potter by the arm as he goes to walk away and thinks for a moment before hissing, “I haven't agreed to your suggestion yet. Let’s work out a schedule first, shall we?”
, what's the use of all those fanclubs if they can't even get this small thing right?
“Fine,” He grits out. “I’ll take her on Saturdays and every alternate holiday that we have. We’ll discuss vacations afterwards.”
"Of course," Draco sniffs, "It's not that hard."
, but even he doesn't deserve to pine forever."
"A stick, Draco, yes," Goyle says reassuringly, and Draco crosses his arms and hisses at him to show that he hasn't missed how 'small' and 'little' haven't been denied. Again, it's not
What many people don't know is that it's only the Malfoy albino hair that makes Draco seem paler than everyone else- Pansy is just as light-skinned, and it's
“How long can it take?” Pansy agrees, pulling her paper closer, “Ten minutes?”
Draco calmly slices a bit of the
“He’s a fourth year,” Cedric Diggory says before the teachers can finish opening their mouths, “Fourteen years old.”
They stand there in silence helplessly until the Bell rings out, the torches on the fall going out one by one.
Draco?”
They eat in silence, half-asleep and tipsy, until the Bell rings out and they have to go.
Potter smiles at that and Draco knocks over his cup in retaliation.
Blaise hooks his foot around Draco's ankle and he smiles.
Potter surprisingly doesn’t look as overwhelmed as everyone else does when Draco talks for a bit too long, and says, “You’re insane, at what age were those French aristocrats guillotined and is it soon, I’ll eat as much as I damn well want to, I want Jenna on both, and how do I know you won’t stand me up again like you did in First Year?”
"Showing you how Slytherins do things," Draco says archly, "The

have tripled after the most recent publicity stunt of yours- you couldn't let the tournament happen without pulling the spotlight to yourself, could you?"
"And they're very nice dungeons, thank you very much," Draco sniffs. "You can take her for now to get her acclimatized, but I want her back tomorrow morning."
